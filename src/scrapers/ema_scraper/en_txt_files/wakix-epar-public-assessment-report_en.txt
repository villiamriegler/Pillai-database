1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Bioprojet Pharma submitted on 7 May 2014 an application for Marketing Authorisation to 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Wakix, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 21 July 2011. 
Wakix was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/07/459 on 10 July 2007, in the following 
indication: treatment of narcolepsy. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Wakix as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: 
ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/Rare disease designations. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that pitolisant was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P0200/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). The PIP includes a waiver for all 
subsets of the paediatric population from birth to less than 6 years of age.  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Narcolepsy is a rare and disabling disorder affecting the sleep and wakefulness regulation. A deficit of 
hypocretin (orexin), a wake stimulating peptide produced by thalamic nuclei, is hypothesized to be the 
key underlying mechanism. The two cardinal clinical features of narcolepsy are excessive daytime 
sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy. It is a chronic and often extremely incapacitating disease with 
negative impact on the quality of life of affected patients, interfering with every aspect of life, in work 
and social settings. The prevalence of narcolepsy with cataplexy is estimated to be between 25 and 50 
per 100,000 people.  
Treatment strategies rely on relief of symptoms. With EDS being the most prevalent and the most 
problematic for the patients, most of the treatments target this particular symptom. Stimulant 
medications, by increasing monoaminergic activity, have been the milestone of therapy for many 
decades. Modafinil is approved for the treatment of excessive sleepiness related to narcolepsy, but its 
mechanism of action is not fully understood. It is considered as the first line pharmacological treatment 
for EDS, but there is discrepancy on its effect on cataplexy. Amphetamines and methylphenidate, 
acting on dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, have been commonly used in this indication. 
However, these medications can have serious side effects, mostly on cardiovascular and nervous 
systems (hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, depression, mania, motor tics, etc.) and could lead to 
abuse disorders and weight loss. Cataplexy is treated by sodium oxybate and antidepressants. Sodium 
oxybate is also approved for the treatment of EDS in narcolepsy but it is associated with significant 
abuse, dependence and withdrawal symptoms. 
About the product 
Histaminergic neurons are mainly located in the posterior hypothalamus. They play a role in arousal 
mechanisms. It has been shown that histamine H3 receptors (H3R), only activated by inverse agonists, 
were able to promote activation of cerebral histamine neurons. 
Pitolisant is an orally active antagonist/inverse agonist of the human histamine H3 receptor. It works 
by enhancing the histaminergic transmissions in brain, acetylcholine release in prefrontal cortex and 
hippocampus and dopamine release in prefrontal cortex but not in striatum.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 4.5 mg of pitolisant (equivalent to 5 
mg of pitolisant hydrochloride) and 18 mg of pitolisant (equivalent to 20 mg of pitolisant 
hydrochloride) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose, crospovidone Type A, talc, magnesium stearate, colloidal 
anhydrous silica. 
Coating: polyvinyl alcohol, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol 3350, and talc. 
The product is available in high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a tamper evident, child-
resistant, polypropylene screw cap fitted with silica gel desiccant. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of pitolisant hydrochloride is 1-{3-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)propoxy]propyl}piperidine, 
hydrochloride and has the following structure: 
Pitolisant is a white or almost white crystalline powder. Hygroscopicity was confirmed by dynamic 
vapor sorption studies and therefore water is controlled in the specifications, the active substance is 
very soluble in water, ethanol and methylene chloride, freely soluble in acetone, and practically 
insoluble in cyclohexane. The active substance is the crystalline pitolisant hydrochloride obtained as a 
stable polymorphic form. A polymorphism study was carried out using methods such as XRPD, DSC, 
TGA as well as thermal treatments and milling. Pitolisant has a non - chiral molecular structure. 
Therefore, the active substance does not exhibit stereoisomerism. 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File 
(ASMF) procedure. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is provided by two commercial suppliers; the quality of the AS from both is 
considered as equivalent. Only one supplier will be used for commercial batches. 
The active substance pitolisant hydrochloride is obtained in two reaction steps followed by a salt 
formation and a recrystallization. Two starting materials are used. One of the starting materials 
proposed is commercially available well defined with acceptable specifications. Regarding the other 
starting material, the information provided showed that genotoxic compounds were involved in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 9/102 
  
  
 
manufacturing process and therefore this step is considered as critical and should be part of the 
manufacturing process performed under GMP. Additionally, the proposed controlled strategy was not 
considered satisfactory since the starting material specifications did not include tests and acceptance 
criteria for potential genotoxic impurities. Therefore, the redefinition of this starting material was 
requested. The ASMFH agreed to redefine this stating material and update the ASMF accordingly. 
However, since setting a new GMP synthesis with validation batches is a long process; this issue will be 
handled as post approval change in June 2016. The ASMFH committed to stop manufacturing of new 
batches of API from current non GMP starting material. There is no immediate concern with the quality 
of the product as future batches of finished product will be manufactured with active substance 
manufactured following redefinition. This was considered satisfactory. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised.  
An exhaustive discussion on potential impurities was provided. The impurities were mainly controlled in 
the active substance specifications or the absence of control in routine was properly justified by 
experimental results and spiking experiments.  
All syntheses, from early laboratory research up to current process have been run with the same 
general scheme.  
Pitolisant hydrochloride is stored in double food-grade low density polyethylene bags (internal bags) 
closed by a tamper-evident plastic tie, overwrapped in a foil liner (external bags) hermetically sealed 
and placed in a fiberboard drum. Specifications of the polyethylene bags have been provided and 
include an identification test by IR. The polyethylene bags comply with EU foodstuffs regulation 
Directive 2002/72/EC). 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility (Ph Eur), identification (IR, 
melting point, and LC), identification of chlorides (Ph Eur), appearance of solution (Ph Eur), pH 
(Ph Eur), water content (Ph Eur), residue of ignition (Ph Eur), heavy metals (Ph Eur), related 
substances (LC-UV), residual solvents (GC), assay (LC), and particle size (laser diffraction). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for testing has been presented.    
Batch analysis data for commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of the active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 24 months under long term conditions at 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 10/102 
  
  
25ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC / 75% RH according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided.   
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
No significant changes have been observed up to 24 months in any parameters tested. 
Results on stress conditions including exposure to neutral, acid, basic, oxidative conditions, heating 
and high intensity UV light (solid and solution) were also provided on one commercial scale batch. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets dosed respectively at 4.5 mg - White, round, 
biconvex film-coated tablet of approximately 3.7 mm in diameter engraved 5 on one side - and 18 mg 
- White, round, biconvex film-coated tablet of approximately 7.5 mm in diameter engraved 20 on one 
side - of active ingredient with the same qualitative and relative quantitative composition of excipients. 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop an immediate release solid dosage form to 
achieve the following objectives: 
 - An oral dosage form suitable for administration of approximately less than 20% concentration of the 
tablet weight with quantity of excipients as low as possible to obtain a tablet as small as possible. 
- Using well known and compatible excipients providing satisfactory chemical stability of the active 
substance  
- Leading to the objective of mean percent of active substance dissolved of 100% at 30 minutes with 
slight inter and intra batch variation 
- A film-coating was applied to mask the bitter taste of the drug substance.  
The choice of dosage form took into account the following characteristics of the active substance: a 
fine crystalline powder with good compressibility properties and satisfactory density which is not 
hygroscopic until 75 % RH, is very soluble in water until pH 7.5, is sensitive to excessive oxidative 
conditions leading to the main identified degradation product, i.e. N-oxide derivative, and has a very 
strong and prolonged bitter taste. 
The pharmaceutical form intended for commercial use is an immediate release film-coated tablet which 
could be divided into four equal parts by applying a pressure to the centre of the tablet placed on a flat 
surface. One quarter of a tablet contains a dose of 4.5 mg of pitolisant. The recommended dose is 18 
mg once-a-day. However, according to personal variations in sensitivity to the daytime waking and 
nocturnal insomnia of the patients under treatment, the dose could be reduced. . 
However, during the assessment of the dossier, the CHMP considered that the need for the patient to 
break the 18 mg cross-scored film-coated tablet (especially into quarters) to obtain the required dose 
was not acceptable. Additionally searching in the bottle, for subsequent doses, was found unreasonable 
to remaining quarters in amongst the whole tablets. Therefore, a 4.5 mg strength was developed and 
consequently the format of tablets was changed from cross-scored to biconvex tablets which is the 
pharmaceutical form intended to be marketed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 11/102 
  
  
All excipients are well known and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards with the exception of 
film-coating agent which is controlled by an in-house specifications and compatible for use in 
pharmaceuticals. Standard ingredients in tablet formulations.  The concentration of each excipient in 
the tablet core lies within the usual range in such a dosage form.  In order to efficiently mask the bitter 
taste of the active substance, the film-coating agent, Opadry, is applied. There are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The manufacturing process by direct tabletting has remained unchanged throughout clinical 
development and the film-coating process was introduced at start of phase III The film-coated tablets 
are packed in plastic bottle (HDPE) with a tamper evident, child-resistant polypropylene (PP) screw cap 
fitted with a desiccant. The plastic material complies with the EU regulations on food contact 
applications and Ph.Eur. 3.1.3 “Polyolefines” and Ph.Eur. 3.2.2 “Plastic containers and closures for 
pharmaceutical use”. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Wakix is manufactured by direct compression and film-coating of the core tablets 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: blending 1, blending 2, compression, 
preparation of coating suspension, coating and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. 
Critical steps of the process have been identified and are considered as well controlled. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process (blending, compression, coating suspension, film coating and 
packaging) have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a 
reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification (LC, UV), average mass (Ph Eur), uniformity of mass (Ph Eur), uniformity of 
dosage units (Ph Eur), water content (Ph Eur), disintegration time (Ph Eur), dissolution test (Ph Eur), 
assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC, GC), microbiological quality (Ph Eur).  The product release and shelf 
life specifications and acceptance criteria are in line with the current relevant guidelines. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for testing has been presented. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing.  
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial batches per strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three 18 mg strength, cross-scored film-coated tablets commercial scale batches of 
finished product from two manufacturers stored under long term conditions for 36 and 18 months 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 12/102 
  
  
respectively at 25ºC / 60% RH, and intermediate conditions for up 12 months at 30°C / 75% RH for 
one manufacturer and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40ºC / 75% RH for both 
manufacturers according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal product 
are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. 
Additional stability studies have been performed on three 18 mg dosage strength biconvex film coated 
tablets commercial scale batches stored under long term conditions for 6 months at 25ºC / 60% RH, 
and intermediate conditions at 30°C / 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 
40ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines. The batches of the medicinal product are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Regarding the 18 mg strength, cross-scored film-coated tablets, no significant change of the physical 
characteristics change is observed. 
Regarding the 18 mg strength, stability studies have been performed as well on three commercial 
scale batches of pitolisant 4.5 mg strength, stored for 6 months at 25°C / 60% RH, 30°C / 75% RH, 
and 40°C / 75% RH. A trend is observed for the main degradation product at 40°C/75% RH. This trend 
is similar to the observed results for the 18 mg strength. The absence of special storage conditions is 
accepted, but the shelf life with the current provided data justify a shorter than the shelf life of the 18 
mg strength. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability-indicating. 
A forced degradation study on one commercial scale batch was performed under the following stress 
conditions: thermal stress for 1 week at 50°C, acidic conditions in HCl 0.1 M at 50°C for 24 hours, 
alkaline conditions in NaOH 0.1 M at 50°C for 24 hours, oxidative stress in H 2O2 0.9 % m/v (3 vol) at 
room temperature for 24 hours. 
An in-use stability study has been performed on the pitolisant 18 mg, biconvex film coated tablets, and 
on the three commercial scale batches of pitolisant 4.5 mg, film coated tablet. After one month daily 
opening, pitolisant 18 mg and 4.5 mg, film-coated tablets packed in 20-mL bottle (HDPE) with child 
resistant, tamper evident polypropylene (PP) closure fitted with 2.4-G desiccant (30 tablets per bottle) 
and stored under 30°C / 75% RH showed no change of physical nor chemical characteristics of the 
product. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. 
No significant change of the physical characteristics was observed, i.e. appearance, disintegration time, 
average mass, water content, hardness, dissolution profile which remain far below the acceptance 
criteria. 
Based on stability data provided, a shelf life of 30 months without any special storage conditions for 
the 18 mg strength and 12 months without any special storage conditions for the 4.5 mg strength are 
acceptable at the time of the authorisation. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To redefine the starting material and update the ASMF accordingly. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical pharmacology programme for pitolisant consisted of in vitro assays and in vivo 
pharmacodynamic studies. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed to determine ADME and drug-drug 
interaction potential. The nonclinical toxicology programme consisted of acute and repeated dose 
studies, genotoxicity assays, carcinogenicity studies, and the evaluation of reproductive and 
developmental toxicity. Abuse liability studies were also conducted.  
All pivotal toxicology studies were performed in accordance with GLP.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Pitolisant binds human histamine 3 receptor (H3R) with Ki values ranging from 1.0 to 2.4 nM 
(corresponding to IC50 values of 3.8-5.2 nM). Significant inter-species variation in the affinity for the 
H3R was observed since pitolisant binds mouse, rat and monkey H3R with Ki values reaching 5.7-14 
nM, 7.3 nM and 1.6 nM, respectively. This was attributed to small difference in receptor sequences 
between species. In functional assays, pitolisant behaved as an antagonist/inverse agonist at the H3R, 
notably in one study showing a concentration-dependent decrease in the coupling to human H3R to G-
protein with an EC50 and Emax values reaching 1.5 nM and 25%, respectively. 
Pitolisant was not specific for H3R over sigma σ 1 and σ2 receptors.  Pitolisant binds to human sigma-1 
receptor with a subnanomolar Ki (Ki = 0.5 nM). It showed a functional activity on sigma-1 receptor-
mediated calcium flux demonstrating agonism with an EC50 of 402 nM. In vivo, it showed an

antidepressant effect in the mouse tail suspension test at a dose of 10 mg/kg, i.p. Regarding sigma-2 
receptors, no in-vivo functional tests are available but the in vitro test showed that pitolisant binds to 
sigma-2 receptors with a Ki of 6.5 nM and an IC50 of 8.55 nM. In a sigma-2 receptor-mediated 
calcium flux functional assay, pitolisant did not elicit agonist activity but behaved as an antagonist as it 
decreased haloperidol-induced calcium release with an IC50 of 10 µM.  
In vivo studies showed that pitolisant enhanced the activity of histaminergic neurons as shown by the 
increase in brain levels of t-MeHA with oral ED50 values reaching 1.6-2.6 mg/kg in mice and 3 mg/kg 
in rats. In mice treated subchronically, the effect was similar and no tachyphylaxis was observed. In 
other microdialysis experiments, pitolisant (10 mg/kg, i.p.) activated dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and 
cholinergic neuronal projections to the prefrontal cortex as well as histaminergic projections to the 
hippocampus in rats. However, pitolisant was devoid of any effect on the dopamine release in the 
nucleus accumbens (in contrast to modafinil). In line with these results, pitolisant (10 mg/kg, p.o.) 
increased the turnover of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, as well as the turnover of noradrenaline in 
hypothalamus, hippocampus and cortex of mice.  
To support the use of pitolisant in narcoleptic patients, its effects on the sleep/wake cycle and on EEG 
pattern were investigated in healthy mice and cats, as well as in a mouse model of narcolepsy (orexin 
KO mouse). It was shown that it increased the duration of waking at the expense of SWS and PS with 
corroborating EEG changes at oral doses ≥10 mg/kg. In orexin KO mice, the results suggested also 
that pitolisant may have an anti-cataplectic effect. 
In MPTP-treated cats, a model of Parkinson’s disease, pitolisant exerted a wake-promoting effect. In 
this model the motor and sleep-wake disorders could be reversed partially by administration of current 
dopaminergic anti-PD compounds such as L-DOPA or ropinirole. Both compounds improved the MPTP-
induced SWS hypersomnia and tended to suppress the increase in REM sleep, with such effects 
differing slightly according the delay after MPTP treatment. Their wake-enhancing effect was, however, 
less potent than that seen with pitolisant at the oral dose of 10 mg/kg.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Pitolisant (15 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed scopolamine-induced learning deficit and the natural forgetting in 
mice. These pro-cognitive effects are hypothesized to be related to treatment-related direct arousing 
effect and/or increase in brain acetylcholine.  
The effects of pitolisant on different types of seizures were investigated in rodents. The results 
suggested that it has anti-epileptic effect on absence seizures (rat model, 20 mg/kg, p.o.), and on 
temporal lobe seizures (kainate mice) at 10 mg/kg, p.o. In the latter model, results at 20 mg/kg, p.o. 
suggested however that it may trigger generalized clonic seizures in epileptic subjects. In addition, 
pitolisant was not active on generalized tonic-clonic seizures in mice (20 mg/kg, p.o.). 
In mice, pitolisant attenuated the hyperlocomotion induced by moderate doses of methamphetamine 
and by MK-801 (dizocilpine), reduced the apomorphine-induced disruption of the pre-pulse inhibition 
(84 dB), and normalized the cognitive performance of dopamine transporter KO mice (no significant 
effect in wild-type mice). These experiments suggest that pitolisant may modulate dopaminergic and 
glutamatergic transmissions.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies showed that pitolisant has the ability to prolong the QT interval in 
humans. In vitro, it blocked hERG currents with an IC50 of 1.3 µM and affected action potential 
parameters in rabbit Purkinje fibres with effects suggesting that it blocks sodium, calcium and 
potassium channels at concentrations higher than 1 µM.  
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 15/102 
  
  
In anaesthetized rabbits, pitolisant was without any effect on the QTc interval. In telemetered dogs, a 
first study using the oral route did not show any adverse effect, but the systemic exposure to pitolisant 
was low and therefore additional studies were performed using the intravenous route. At 1.5 mg/kg, 
i.v., the QTc intervals (QTcF and QTcV) were prolonged slightly (+10%) but significantly up to 6 hours 
post-dosing when compared to pre-dose values, but not when compared to the vehicle control group. 
However, the effect in pitolisant-treated animals was more long-lasting and the values of the QTc 
interval observed following the administration of pitolisant were overall slightly higher than those 
observed following the vehicle administration. Therefore, a slight effect on QTc (prolongation) interval 
could not be excluded in this study. In the second intravenous telemetered dog study, a 3-fold higher 
dose caused rapid shortenings of PR, QTcF, and QTcV intervals which occurred together with rapid and 
marked increases in blood pressure and heart rate. 
The effect of pitolisant on respiratory parameters was investigated in pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats 
treated i.v. at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 mg/kg. No adverse effect on measured parameters was noted at up 
to 4 mg/kg. At 6 mg/kg, a clear increase of the tidal volume was noted. 
The Irwin test showed signs of central excitation from the low dose level (3 mg/kg, p.o.), with 
additional findings of muscular hypotony and sedation, and changes in state of mood at 30 mg/kg and 
above. Trace of tremors was observed at 60 mg/kg and minimal appearance of opisthotonus and few 
tonic and clonic convulsions at 100 mg/kg. Furthermore, pitolisant was shown to display a pro-
convulsant activity at doses higher than 30 mg/kg, p.o. in the pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsion 
mouse model. Overall, pitolisant induced a dose-dependent increase in central excitation leading to the 
appearance of convulsions.  
No treatment-related effect on barbital-induced sleep was shown in rats at up to 60 mg/kg, p.o. 
however this result should be interpreted with caution since the oral route of administration used is a 
source of high inter-individual variability due to the poor oral bioavailability of pitolisant in rats (1.5%). 
Drug abuse liability studies were conducted and evaluated as part of the toxicology section. 
Since the secretion of endogenous histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells of the stomach is 
involved in the trigger of HCl secretion and is partly controlled by H3R, specific studies were performed 
with an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, rivastigmine, which is known to increase gastric acid secretion. 
Pitolisant at up to 10 mg/kg p.o did not induce gastric ulcer when given alone or in combination with 
rivastigmine. Since rivastigmine alone did not induce gastric ulcer in the experimental conditions of 
this assay, a conclusion on the lack of potentiation of rivastigmine’s effect on gastric mucosa is 
questionable. Pitolisant did not affect gastric secretion volume and gastric acid secretion in the Shay 
ulcer model, contrary to cimetidine. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
In animal models, synergistic effects of pitolisant with olanzapine were shown as regards their ability 
to block the hyperlocomotion induced by D-amphetamine or MK-801, and apomorphine-induced 
climbing behaviour. In the latter case, a synergistic effect was also shown with risperidone. The 
combination of pitolisant with rivastigmine enhanced the ability of both compound to increase 
extracellular acetylcholine levels. Some interactions were found with lisuride and ropinirole (D2 
agonists used in the treatment of PD), but were assessed to be caused by PK interactions. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In rats dosed with [14C]-pitolisant the bioavailability was only 1.5% when unchanged pitolisant was 
considered and nearly 100% when total [14C] was considered. This can be explained by an active first-
Assessment report

pass metabolism by CYP3A4 in gut In Cynomolgus monkeys, the oral bioavailability of unchanged 
pitolisant in plasma was 27% and nearly 100% when total [14C] was considered.   
Tissue distribution studies revealed that pitolisant was widely distributed into the body in all the tested 
species. In mice, pitolisant was mainly distributed in liver, lung, kidney and bile. In rats, drug-related 
radioactivity was widely distributed with the highest concentrations found in GI tract and significant 
ones in the liver and kidney. Distribution to melanin containing structures (skin, uveal tract) was also 
reported in partially pigmented rats. In male Cynomolgus monkeys, high radioactivity levels were 
identified in GI tract, liver, kidneys, seminal vesicles and prostate. In both rats and monkeys receiving 
[14C]-pitolisant i.v., the apparent volume of distribution of pitolisant at steady state was approximately 
10-fold greater than total body water, indicating extensive tissue distribution. Pitolisant was highly 
bound (above 88%) to serum protein in human, monkey, dog, rat and mouse; over the concentration 
range of 100 nM to 1 μM, the main phase I human metabolite BP2.951 exhibited moderate serum 
protein binding compared to pitolisant.  
Pitolisant crosses the placenta and was found in milk in rats. 
In vitro metabolism studies of pitolisant using microsomes and hepatocytes, have shown that the two 
major non-conjugated metabolites were BP2.941 and BP2.951 in monkeys and humans. Other oxidized 
metabolites of pitolisant such as BP1.2525 and BP1.2526 were present but to a minor extent. In 
contrast, the drug metabolism in rats was different, wherein BP1.2526 presents in very low levels in 
humans, being the major non-conjugated metabolite whereas BP2.951 and BP2.941 found in minor 
quantities. Pharmacological activity of the main metabolites over human H3 receptors revealed that 
only BP1.2526 and BP1.2525 at a lesser extent have an affinity towards human H3 receptor. 
In rats, main metabolites in these samples are mostly conjugated entities; however non-conjugated 
metabolite such as BP1.2526 was also abundant and in a lesser extent BP1.2525 in tested matrices. 
From the comparison of metabolites formed in vivo in Cynomolgus monkeys and in humans, the 
applicant did conclude that Cynomolgus monkeys could be used as the non-rodent species for toxicity 
studies. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the metabolite BP1.8054, a glycine conjugate of a phase 
I metabolite, was only detected in humans and neither in monkeys nor rats. Therefore the toxicity 
species were not considered fully validated and the applicant was asked to submit additional studies to 
characterize this metabolite toxicity. These studies were performed and data submitted to the 
authorities (see Toxicology section 2.3.4). 
Excretion/elimination was characterized in mass-balance studies performed after oral and intravenous 
dosing in rats and monkeys. In the rat, following oral and intravenous administration, there was high 
recovery of radioactivity within the collection period with a majority of the radioactivity in urine and 
faeces (98.4 and 92.6%, respectively). Some difference was reported in function of the route, however 
there were both urinary and biliary excretions following oral and intravenous administration with low 
levels of radioactivity detected in expired air (3.6% (oral) and 4.4%(i.v.)). 
Following oral and intravenous administration of [14C]-pitolisant to monkeys, the majority of the dose 
was recovered in urine (69.9% and 63.3%, respectively). As less than 5% of the dose was recovered 
in the faeces up to 168 h post-dose (both administration routes), it can be concluded that biliary 
elimination was a minor route of excretion. The presence of expired [14C]-CO 2 indicates that formation 
of [14C]-CO 2 is occurring (~8.5% of the administered dose over the 0-24h period), which accounts for 
most of the shortfall in recovery.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single and repeat dose toxicity 
The acute toxicity of pitolisant was evaluated by the oral and intravenous route in mice and rats. In 
mice, the no effect dose was > 30 mg/kg orally and > 5 mg/kg, i.v., with a maximum non-lethal oral 
dose of 100 mg/kg. The minimum lethal doses were 150 mg/kg, p.o. and 10 mg/kg, i.v. In rats, the no 
effect dose was > 50 mg/kg, orally and 12 mg/kg, i.v., with a maximum non-lethal oral dose of 100 
mg/kg.

The single dose toxicity studies demonstrated the central nervous system to be the main target organ. 
One of the metabolites tested, the BP1.2526, was shown to be a convulsant. In repeated doses 
studies, effects were observed at the highest doses in the central nervous system (hypoactivity, 
ptylalism, abnormal gait, tremors and clonic convulsions) of mice, rats and monkeys. Reversible 
changes in some organ weights and limited histopathological changes in some organs in rodents (liver, 
duodenum, thymus, adrenal gland and lung) were recorded. The NOAEL by oral route were 75, 30 and 
12 mg/kg/day in mice, rats and monkeys, respectively with safety margins based on AUC for male and 
female of 9, 1 and 0.4, respectively.  
A comparison of non-clinical and clinical metabolism data showed that one metabolite of pitolisant, 
BP1.8054, occurred only in humans as a major metabolite. The toxicology data for BP1.8054 showed 
no activity on human and rat recombinant H3 receptor, it was also inactive on hERG channel. It 
showed no genotoxicity in vitro in an Ames test and a micronucleus test on human lymphocytes. In a 
14-day study, it was well tolerated up to several hundred times the human exposure at 20 mg/day and 
only induced haematological and biochemical modifications. In the 13-week study, BP1.8054 did not 
induce any significant toxic effect up to the dose of 300 mg/kg/day representing several hundred times

Pitolisant and two metabolites (BP1.2526, BP2.951) did not cause any gene mutation in Ames test in 
absence or presence of microsomal activation at concentrations up to cytotoxic levels. In the MLA 
assay, pitolisant did not induce gene mutation or chromosomal damage when tested up to cytotoxic 
concentrations in the presence or absence of microsomal activation. Concerning the in vivo studies, in 
the micronucleus test, no increase in the number of micronucleated erythrocytes (MPE/PET) was 
observed in Swiss mice treated at 150 mg/kg of pitolisant per os with evidence of exposure. This

Clinical signs:

Pitolisant did not reveal any neoplastic potential up to a level of 30 mg/kg/day and 75 mg/kg/day in 
rats and transgenic mice. Taking into account the proposed maximum clinical dose of 36 mg, the 
safety margins based on the AUC were 1.9 and 11 in rats and mice, respectively.  
Reproduction toxicity 
In a fertility study in rats, there was reduced sperm motility (4/22 and 4/23 males at 90 and 52 
mg/kg/day, respectively). Sperm morphological alterations occurred at 90 and 52 mg/kg/day (18% 
and 17% of males respectively).  The main alterations were sperm with isolated head, misshapen 
head, bent tail and degenerating tail but these changes did not affect fertility in males.  In view of the 
results, 30 mg/kg/day was considered to be the NOAEL for both sexes. Therefore, the safety margin 
calculated taking into account AUC was around 1 in males and females.  
Embryofoetal toxicity of pitolisant was evaluated in rats and rabbits following administration during the 
organogenesis period. In rat treated with 30, 52, 90 and 110 mg/kg/day, no mortality was recorded in 
females. A slight decrease in body weight was reported at doses of 30, 90 and 110 mg/kg/day. A 
statistically significant decrease of food consumption was observed at 90 and 110 mg/kg/day. There 
were no statistically significant related treatment foetal malformations up to 110 mg/kg/day. Maternal 
toxicity and foetal weight reductions were noted at 90 and 110 mg/kg. NOAELs were 52 and 90 mg/kg

for females and litters, respectively. The safety margins at 52 and 90 mg/kg were of 0.6 and 2.3, 
respectively. 
In rabbits treated by oral dose at 30, 67 and 150 mg/kg/day, there were at 150 mg/kg the following 
clinical signs in dams: pronounced decreased food consumption, a slight diminution of body weight. In 
litters, at 150 mg/kg, slight delayed ossification, anasacarna, acaudate, cleft palate and cerebral 
ventricle in foetuses were reported. These malformations were observed with maternal toxicity. The 
NOAEL for both females and litters was 67 mg/kg (safety margins based on AUC <0.2). Taking into 
account the limited exposure to pitolisant by oral route administration, another study was carried out 
by intramuscular (IM) route.   
In additional study performed in rabbit by IM route at 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg, a general retardation in 
skeletal development was observed at 16 mg/kg, but this effect was associated with the maternal 
toxicity. The NOAEL for dams and foetuses were 4 and 8 mg/kg, respectively. The safety margins are 
0.6 for the dose of 4 mg/kg and 1.3 for the dose of 8 mg/kg. Nevertheless, in this study, foetal 
examination at terminal necropsy on DG29 revealed at that at 16 mg/kg/day pre-implantation loss was 
slightly increased and both the number of implantations and the number of live foetuses was 
decreased. Skeletal examination revealed an increased incidence of foetuses fused sternebrae and with 
findings indicative of retardation in foetal development (supernumerary rib(s), incomplete / unossified 
median phalanx of the forepaw and/or 1st metacarpal(s)), at 16 mg/kg/day, but not at 4 or 8 
mg/kg/day. The retardation in skeletal development was claimed to be associated with maternal 
toxicity.  
In the pre-natal and post-natal development study conducted in the rat using the oral route of 
administration potential treatment related effects were investigated in the F0, F1 and F2 generations.  
In the F0 generation, at 90 mg/kg (top-dose) there were 9 deaths recorded at the end of pregnancy of 
which 7 were attributed to dystocia during delivery. In this group most animals showed clinical central 
nervous system signs. Body-weight gain was reduced as well as food consumption. At 52 mg/kg and 
30 mg/kg, no mortality and no noteworthy clinical signs were recorded. In the top dose-group 
surviving females did not produce milk and did not nurse their pups, which all died or were eaten by 
the mothers. In the mid dose-group (52 mg/kg) some alterations in maternal behaviour were recorded 
in two females. One female had no milk and did not nurse for 3 days and its pups died. In the F1 
generation, at 90 mg/kg there was a reduction of live-born pups and an increase of post-implantation 
losses and dead-born pups. After delivery, surviving pups died within 4 days postpartum. Eighteen 
pups from 4 litters showed a major malformation (cleft palate) and 5 pups from 2 litters showed a 
minor malformation (abnormal flexure of the extremities). Among the 52 mg/kg litters the viability 
index on day 4 postpartum was slightly reduced (5%). During the first days postpartum, physical and 
motor developments were slightly reduced at 52 mg/kg. Pup size and physical development were 
slightly reduced until day 30 postpartum. Motor development (postural reflex and righting tests) was 
delayed between day 1 and day 17 of lactation.   
Taken together, these results indicate that pitolisant had effects on reproductive function and 
embryofoetal development at clinically relevant exposures. These results and precautions for use in 
pregnant and breast-feeding women have been reflected in appropriate sections of the SmPC. 
Juvenile toxicity  
In juvenile toxicity studies in rats, mortality and convulsions were observed at highest doses by 
intraperitoneal route (30 and 60 mg/kg). There was no effect on the reproductive and development 
function of the treated animals. Pathological changes were limited to a slight increase of alveolar 
macrophages in lungs at two doses of 30 and 60 mg/kg. The NOAEL was 15 mg/kg for male and 
female rats with a safety margin based on the AUC of 1.8 and 1, respectively.

* The steady state Cmax and AUC0-t used in the margin calculations for pitolisant were 72 ng/mL and 804 ng/mL*h, respectively at maximum therapeutic 
dose of 40 mg per day (study P04-06). For BP2.951, the Cmax and AUC0-t were 26 ng/mL and 173 ng/mL*h, respectively. These values were from the 
Study P-03-03 performed in humans following 40 mg daily dosing.  
Regarding the metabolites, evidence of exposure of metabolites (BP2.951, BP1.2526, BP1.2525) were 
shown in mice, rats and monkeys. BP2.951, BP1.2526 were compared to pharmacokinetic parameters 
of pitolisant in humans at therapeutic dose of 20 mg per day. BP2.951 metabolite was measured 
during clinical trial P03-03 (at 40 mg per day). For this metabolite, the safety margins based on AUC 
(at NOAEL) were in mice, rats and monkeys for male and female: 3.7/2.4, 0.96/1.9 and 6.5/6.5, 
respectively. The BP1.2526 and BP1.2525 were measured in the P03-03 clinical study and were found 
at very low levels (trace levels). Furthermore, the major glucuronide metabolite in human species was 
measured in monkey (9-month) samples leading to satisfying safety margins. 
In regards to the toxicity mainly related to CNS effects (convulsions), the applicant argued that a 
safety margin based on C max is more relevant than based on AUC leading to safety margins around 25, 
10 and 1 for mice, rats and monkeys, respectively (convulsions occur at around the Tmax). However, it 
would be more reliable to have a statistically significant correlation between convulsions and the C max 
taking into account high levels of pitolisant and overall metabolites in any species. Nevertheless, the 
safety margin based upon the C max was still 1 for monkey. Whatever based on C max or AUC, there was 
no safety margin in monkey.  
Local Tolerance  
As the intended administration route is oral, the CHMP agreed that no local tolerance studies are 
necessary. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Pitolisant is a new chemical entity of low molecular weight and of non peptidic nature. It is unlikely 
that any antigenicity potential appeared following the chronic administration. Therefore, antigenicity 
aspects were not investigated further. 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015

Immunotoxicity 
Chronic administration (6 months in rats, 9 months in monkeys) evidenced no significant change on 
the following parameters: haematology, immune system organ weights and histology, frequency of 
infections and tumours including in the two carcinogenicity studies. Therefore, immunotoxicity aspects 
were not investigated further. 
Abuse potential and dependence 
Regarding the abuse potential, studies (discrimination, conditioned-place preference, locomotor 
sensitization and self administration) were performed in several species (rodents and primates), by 
several route of administration (IV, SC, i.p., p.o.), at different doses including high doses, and with 
negative and positive control groups (modafinil, cocaine, and vehicle saline). Dependence potential of 
pitolisant was assessed in rats with morphine, cocaine or amphetamine as positive reference. The 
Gellert-Holzmann scale, anxiety and depression behavioural tests and physical indices (body weight, 
temperature) were used to assess withdrawal symptoms. Results were not in favour of an abuse and 
dependence potential of pitolisant, except for the self-administration study in rhesus monkeys, as the 
higher pitolisant tested dose served as a reinforcer for 2 of the 4 monkeys. In the self-administration 
study, there were two test conditions with individual monkeys (M1288 and M1344) in which mean 
numbers of pitolisant infusions obtained exceed those of saline and their range did not overlap at 
0.3 mg/kg. However, mean number of pitolisant infusions were below saline levels at 0.56 mg/kg, the 
highest dose tested. Although these two monkeys seem to present an increase in the mean infusion at 
0.3 mg/kg of pitolisant during regular testing, an additional saline test condition conducted at the end 
of the study as is usual in such studies, showed numbers of infusions which overlap the 0.3 mg/kg 
dose for monkey M1288 and was similar to the 0.3 mg/kg dose for monkey M1344. No conclusion 
could be drawn. 
For tolerance, the Applicant did not provide a dose-effect curve but the changes in t-MeHA brain level, 
a reliable index of the activation of the histaminergic neurons via histamine H3 receptors measured in 
the brain 90 min after a single oral administration of vehicle or pitolisant to mice following a 4-, 10- 
and 17-day subchronic treatment. Results showed a significant decrease in the t-MeHA level as 
compared to control mice, 17 hours after the last pitolisant administration following a 4-day subchronic 
treatment. However, decrease in the t-MeHA level observed following 10-day and 17-day subchronic 
treatment was non-significant. No conclusion on tolerance could be drawn. 
In the literature, reinforcing effects of sigma receptor agonists in rats that had a history of cocaine 
self-administration has been reported, while some review focused on the potential of sigma receptor 
antagonists as treatments for stimulant abuse. Additionally, sigma receptor agonists were found to 
increase dopamine concentrations in nucleus accumbens shell. In view of the binding affinities of 
pitolisant for histamine non-H3R and for a series of non-histamine receptors, the Applicant concluded 
to a good selectivity profile of pitolisant for the H3R. However, pitolisant binds to sigma 1 and 2 
receptors with similar or higher affinity than to H3R. It acts as an agonist to sigma-1 and antagonist to 
sigma-2 with functional IC50 values of 402 nM and 10 µM, respectively. The data do not exclude a risk 
of abuse potential. 
Furthermore, according to pitolisant capacity to increase memory performance and the duration of 
acquisition of animals, diversion of pitolisant to increase intellectual performance was considered as a 
potential risk in humans. 
Studies on impurities 
No impurities have been found higher than the qualification threshold of the ICH 3QA guideline on 
impurities in new drug substances. Other impurities with structural alert were not found higher than 
the threshold of toxicological concern concept of 1.5 µg per day (CPMP/SWP/5199/02-June 25, 2006).

Photosafety 
As pitolisant does not absorb light in the UVA, UVB and visible range, the investigation of photosafety 
was not conducted.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant has submitted an ERA based on the EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 guideline. For the Phase I 
PEC calculation, Fpen was refined based on the prevalence of narcolepsy in the European Union.  
Pitolisant PEC surfacewater value is below the action limit of 0.01 μg/L and is not a PBT substance as 
log Kow does not exceed 4.5. Therefore pitolisant is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pitolisant is a potent histamine 3 receptor (H3R) antagonist/inverse agonist. The H3R was first 
characterized as an auto-receptor, regulating the electrical activity of histaminergic neurons as well as 
the synthesis and release of histamine. Histaminergic neurons are arranged in the tuberomamillary 
nucleus in the hypothalamus, from which they send highly divergent axons to the brain and the spinal 
cord. These neurons are mainly active during day, almost silent during night and their main function is 
to promote wakefulness, attention and cognitive functions. Hence, pharmacological blockade of the H3-
autoreceptor enhances histaminergic neuron activity and results in promotion of wakefulness and pro-
cognitive effects.

In vivo studies in wild-type and orexin KO mice, and in cats showed that pitolisant increased the 
duration of waking at the expense of SWS and PS with corroborating EEG changes at ≥10 mg/kg 
(p.o.), thereby supporting a proof-of-concept for its use in narcoleptic patients.  
The CHMP identified a concern for potential effects at sigma σ1 and σ2 receptors since the IC50 of 
pitolisant at these receptors (0.01 and 0.085 µM, respectively) is lower than the clinical Cmax at 
therapeutic doses of 20 mg (34.9 ng/mL or 0.118 µM) and 40 mg (72 ng/mL or 0.243 µM).   
As pitolisant is a sigma-1 agonist, antidepressant activity and an abuse potential are theoretically 
plausible in humans. However, based on clinical data, a relationship between treatment with pitolisant 
and depressive symptoms cannot be excluded. Consequently, the risk of depression has been included 
as an important identified risk in the RMP and will be further characterized in the proposed PASS (see 
Clinical Safety). 
Although pitolisant is sigma-2 antagonist and can theoretically attenuate some behavioural effects of 
cocaine, conflicting hypothesis regarding abuse potential could not lead to a definite conclusion. 
Therefore, abuse potential has been included in the RMP as important potential risk (see Clinical 
Safety).  
In a mouse 4-week repeated dose toxicity study, conducted at doses of 30, 75 and 100 mg/kg/day the 
dose-level of 75 mg/kg/day of BF2.649 given by oral gavage to CB6F1-nonTgrasH2 mice was 
considered to be the NOAEL and elicited CNS signs of toxicity (mainly transient hypoactivity) in a 
limited number of mice. The incidence and severity of pale basophilic round bodies in the tubular 
lumen of the testes was increased at both 75 and 100 mg/kg/day. This finding was probably mouse-
specific and did not appear to be associated with any other degenerative changes.  The metabolite 
BP1.2526 was the major metabolite in both sexes over the study.  
In the rat 13-week repeated dose toxicity study there was a lower heart weight. The aetiology of this 
finding and significance of the heart weight changes is not clear since they were stated not to be 
associated with any histopathological changes and no effect was found after the recovery period. At 
the top dose, which was reduced from 150 to 100 to finally 75 mg/kg/day, 30% of males and 20% of 
females were found dead as was one female (10%) in the recovery group. The cause of death is 
unknown, and necropsy did not reveal any apparent cause of death. The applicant speculated that the 
deaths could be due to a direct cardio-respiratory, or to a secondary CNS origin. The Applicant’s 
conclusion that the cause of death in the rat has been identified as the convulsive activity of 
metabolites found in high concentrations in the rat (but humans) is not endorsed and is considered to 
be a hypothesis. However, in view of the fact that no signs of CNS toxicity similar to that observed in 
the rat have been reported in clinical studies or healthy volunteers at high doses provides some 
reassurance. 
In the rat 6-month toxicity study the administration of 60 mg/kg/day for 6 months resulted in the 
death of several animals and was associated with severe overt signs of CNS toxicity such as 
convulsions, tremors and abnormal gait. The applicant proposed that the convulsive episodes could be 
linked to high Cmax values since they occurred close to the Tmax. Focal increased alveolar macrophages 
(associated with pale foci at necropsy) were observed in 15/18 females at the top dose as compared to 
a limited number in other groups (4/20 in controls and 6/20 at 5 and 30 mg/kg/day). These changes 
were still present in the recovery 60 mg/kg/day females. However, males were almost not affected by 
these changes in lungs. In the 13-week rat study there were histopathological changes in lungs 
(pneumonia foci) in the top dose animals which were still present in the corresponding recovery 
animals. When these non-clinical findings are considered together with the clinical reports, it appears 
that there is no major pulmonary concern for the clinical use of pitolisant.

EMA/828546/2015

In the monkey 13-week study there appeared to be no treatment related effects at 5 mg/kg/day. At 12 
mg/kg/day, occasional emesis and slight changes (within the normal range of values) in serum 
biochemistry were recorded in some animals and these effects stopped on treatment discontinuation. 
This dose was the NOAEL. In addition the main findings observed in several animals treated at 30 
mg/kg/day were CNS signs (emesis, tremors), and slight changes in serum biochemistry. There was 
inter-day and inter individual variability in the toxicokinetics. Also drug exposure was not linear in the 
low part of the dose range. This could be related to a saturation of metabolic routes. 
In the monkey 9-month study, central nervous system signs (tremors, unsteady gait and convulsions) 
were recorded at 30 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL dose was 12 mg/kg/day. 
In regards to the CNS effects (convulsions), the applicant argued that a safety margin based on Cmax is 
more relevant than based on AUC leading to safety margins around 25, 10 and 1 for mice, rats and 
monkeys, respectively (convulsions occur at around the Tmax). However, it would be more reliable to 
have a statistically significant correlation between convulsions and the Cmax taking into account high 
levels of pitolisant and overall metabolites in any species. Nevertheless, even based on Cmax, the safety 
margin based upon the Cmax was still 1 for monkey.  
Considering all of the toxicity studies overall, it is noteworthy that the adverse CNS effects occurred in 
all 3 animal species, in particular in the monkey. In the monkey the major in vivo metabolites are 
similar to humans qualitatively and quantitatively: the 2 major metabolites are the BP2.951 and the 
BP2.941. The metabolite BP1.2526 appeared to be more potent than pitolisant as pro-convulsive 
agent. Its serum and brain concentrations in rats are higher than those of pitolisant. However, this 
compound is present at very low levels in monkeys and therefore most probably only has a very 
limited role in CNS toxicity in this species. Therefore the entity responsible for the convulsions in 
monkey has not been clearly elucidated.  
In general, low or no safety margins (based on AUC) were determined in toxicity studies. The main 
target organ was the CNS, with findings in line with safety pharmacology data showing that pitolisant 
induced a dose-dependent increase in central excitation leading to the appearance of convulsions. 
Safety pharmacology studies highlighted the ability of pitolisant to affect the QT interval in humans (a 
thorough QT/QTc study was conducted further, see clinical section), as well as its pro-convulsant 
potential. The impact of this finding on the overall safety profile is discussed in the Clinical Safety 
section.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies in rodents with drugs likely to be co-administered clinically, 
revealed no significant interactions. 
Finally, there are no issues in relation to the impurity profile of the drug substance or drug product 
from a non-clinical perspective.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Following single and multiple oral dosing of pitolisant to healthy male adults at doses between 1 and 
240 mg, absorption was reasonably rapid with C max typically achieved between 2 and 4 hours after 
dosing. Exposure to pitolisant showed moderate to high interindividual variability and increased more 
than proportionally with dose up to 240 mg after once daily dosing. In the therapeutic dose range, 
AUC 0-∞ increased by about 2.3 when pitolisant dose is doubled from 30 to 60 mg. 
According to a mass-balance study conducted in 6 healthy male subjects dosed with 20 mg in fasting 
state, a mean recovery of at least 88% of administered radioactivity was recovered, primarily from 
urine (approximately 63%) with approximately 25% of the dose excreted through expired air and a 
small fraction (<3%) recovered in faeces. The absolute bioavailability of pitolisant has not been 
determined.  
The food intake significantly decreases the systemic exposure of pitolisant (significant decrease in C max 
and AUC). A delay of absorption was observed (significant increase in Tmax with food intake). 
Nevertheless, the extent of absorption (AUC) remains bioequivalent with or without food. 
Basing on the results above, it can be considered that there is a potential effect of food intake on the 
bioavailability, specifically on the rate of absorption, of pitolisant. However, no clinical consequences 
are expected. The SmPC of pitolisant recommends taking pitolisant during breakfast for tolerability and 
not PK reasons. This recommendation was endorsed by the CHMP.   
Based on PK parameters estimated using NCA approach, pitolisant PK parameters exhibit a moderate 
to high between-subjects variability. Within-subjects variability (%CV) could not be estimated from the 
available data.  
Distribution 
Pitolisant was moderately bound to serum proteins at therapeutic concentrations (~78-96%). The 
parent drug has a high apparent volume of distribution (V/F; 1100 to 2825 L). However, there was no 
reliable estimation of pitolisant apparent Vd due to discrepancies between studies. This seems to be 
linked to the high intersubject variability and to the nonlinear PK of pitolisant (mainly time-
dependency). As the bioavailability of the drug is unknown, it was not possible to say whether the high 
apparent volume of distribution is due to large extent of distribution or low bioavailability. In vitro 
investigations showed that pitolisant distributes to red blood cells (RBC) with equal affinity to that of 
plasma proteins. Pitolisant crosses the blood-barrier barrier in animal models. 
The half-life of pitolisant was estimated to be between 8-11 hours (median values).  
Elimination 
The main route of elimination of pitolisant is hepatic metabolism. The mass balance study showed that 
excretion (renal or biliary) does not play an important part in the elimination of parent drug. The 
metabolites were excreted in urine and presumably expired air (as CO 2). It is claimed that 
approximately 25% of administered radioactivity could be accounted for in expired air, however the 
methods, assumptions and impact on study conclusions were not detailed and therefore could not be 
endorsed by the CHMP. The Applicant committed to perform a new mass-balance study with the drug 
radiolabelled at a non-labile position.

A human metabolic pathway for pitolisant based on the in vivo and in vitro investigations was 
submitted to the authorities. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
No investigation on pitolisant PK has been made on the target population. No marked differences are 
expected in target patients compared to healthy volunteers. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Analysis of the available data indicates that pitolisant PKs is not linear. The drug exposure appeared to 
be greater than proportional to dose and may also be time-dependent. After repeated dose 
administration, the drug accumulated more than expected from single dose studies.  
Special populations 
In both renal and hepatic impairment, drug exposure increased. After single dose administration, in 
mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, total drug exposure increased approximately 2-fold. In 
moderate hepatic impairment, unbound drug exposure increased by 3.3-fold.  
Most studies were performed in healthy male subjects. Therefore, no conclusion could be made 
regarding the influence of gender on pitolisant pharmacokinetics.  
All pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in European countries and the potential effect of ethnicity 
on pitolisant pharmacokinetics has not been investigated. There was also no investigation on the 
influence of body weight or body surface area.  
Study P09-12 conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic profile in healthy elderly subjects and a young 
adult control group showed that pitolisant exposure was higher in the elderly whilst apparent clearance 
was lower. Moreover, a high variability and therefore important fluctuation were observed.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vivo PK interactions studies were conducted by the Applicant to assess the clinical impact of the 
combination of pitolisant with potent CYP3A4 and 2D6 inhibitors or inducers.  
The co-administration of multiple doses of itraconazole (200 mg for 7 days), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, 
with pitolisant (single dose of 20 mg) in 18 healthy subjects had no significant impact on rate of 
absorption and extent of exposure of the parent drug. It induced a slight decrease of exposure to the 
metabolite BP2.951 (14 and 11% for AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞ geometric means, respectively). Cmax for the 
metabolite was decreased (about 27%). Tmax was not modified. 
The co-administration of multiple doses of rifampicin (600 mg for 7 days), a potent CYP3A4 inducer, 
with pitolisant in 18 healthy male subjects significantly decreases extent of exposure of pitolisant 
(39%, 47% and 48% for C max, AUC0-t and AUC 0-∞ geometric means, respectively); the 90% CIs being 
excluded from the reference range [0.80-1.25]. It did not modify BP2.951 C max and decreases 
exposure to BP2.951 (38% and 37% for AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ geometric means, respectively). Given the 
approximately 50% decrease of pitolisant exposure with rifampicin, it can be concluded that co-
administration of pitolisant with inducers of CYP3A4 should be done with caution. 
The co-administration of multiple doses of paroxetine (20 mg for 8 days and 10 mg for 1 day), a 
potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, with pitolisant (20 mg, single dose) in 18 healthy subjects significantly 
increases the rate of absorption and extent of exposure of pitolisant (47%, 105% and 121% for C max, 
AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞ geometric means, respectively). It resulted also in a slight decrease of C max of the 
metabolite (about 4.6%) and in a significant increase of exposure to BP2.951 (63% and 84% for AUC0-
t and AUC 0-∞ geometric means, respectively).

In vitro data showed inhibition of CYP2D6 by pitolisant but at concentrations higher than the worst 
calculated cases. Nonetheless, a study performed in mice showed a 2.3-fold increase of olanzapine 
exposure in serum and a 3.2-fold increase in the brain after a co-administration with pitolisant (n=9). 
Then, according to these results, a clinical study was planned to see if such effect may occur in human. 
Surprisingly, when olanzapine 5 mg was co-administered with pitolisant 60mg in 6 healthy subjects, a 
significant decrease of olanzapine plasma concentrations (around 20%) was observed with a significant 
increase of pitolisant plasma concentrations (around 20%, with 90% confidence interval outside the 
bioequivalence bounds of [0,8-1,25]). 
On the contrary, the exposure of olanzapine 2.5 mg was a little higher than with 5mg (i.e. ratio for the 
AUC 1.38 versus 1.18). These results support the previous assumption that interaction data in animals 
cannot be extrapolated to human. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
CYP450 isoenzymes study set up was generally appropriate with adequate cell models (human liver 
microsomes or primary culture of human hepatocytes) and control substrates for each studied 
cytochrome (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A).  
Studies assessing the inhibitory potential of pitolisant were performed with acceptable range of 
pitolisant concentrations (0 up to 25 µM) covering the worst systemic concentrations of 50 × Cmax,u, 
i.e. 1.25 µM. Nonetheless, for CYP3A4, the tested concentrations would have considered the worst 
intestinal one (i.e. 0.1 × D/250 ml or 54 µM) since this isoenzyme is also located in enterocytes. 
Results showed a moderate inhibitory potential of pitolisant, IC50s being >100 and 2.6 μM with 
CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isoforms, respectively. These values are notably higher than the estimated cut-off 
values, i.e. 1.25 µm and 54 µM at the systemic and the intestinal level, respectively, suggesting that 
pitolisant is not expected to modify the metabolism of drugs substrates of these isoenzymes. In this 
respect, it should be underlined that inhibition of CYP2D6 by pitolisant was not a mechanism-based 
inhibition. In agreement with the in vitro data, degradation of drugs like midazolam, phenacetin, 
diclofenac and S-mephenytoin by human microsomes was not modified in presence of pitolisant. Then, 
clinically relevant interactions related to CYP3A4, 1A2, 2C9 and 2C19 inhibition by pitolisant is unlikely. 
In vitro studies show no ability for pitolisant and of its three major metabolites in human to be UGT 
inhibitors or inducers.  
Pitolisant has been shown to have high permeability in Caco-2 cells assay.  It is neither a P-gp nor a 
BCRP substrate, each efflux ratio (ER) < 2. Therefore, no drug-drug interactions related to an 
inhibition or induction of these transporters are expected. 
With regards to P-gp and BCRP inhibition, pitolisant displayed an IC50>270 µM for both efflux 
transporters. With cut-off values at the intestinal and systemic level of 1.25 µM (50×C max, u  for the 
highest therapeutic dose = 40 mg/day) and 54µM (0.1× D/250mL), respectively, the IC50 is higher 
than theses values. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions due to P-gp and BCRP inhibition by 
pitolisant are unlikely.  
Additional in vitro studies were performed to investigate the ability of pitolisant to be a substrate of the 
uptake transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, and efflux transporters MATE-1 
and MATE-2K. Based on the provided results, the following conclusions and in vitro-in vivo 
extrapolation were made according to the EU Guideline of Drug Interaction Investigations: 
- Pitolisant is neither an OATP1B1, OATP1B3 nor an OCT1 substrate. Therefore, no drug-drug 
interactions related to an inhibition these transporters are expected. 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 36/102 
  
  
- Pitolisant does not inhibit MATE-1, MATE-2K, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 at a concentration higher than 
the worst expected concentration at the systemic level, i.e.50× C max,u ~1,~25 µM. Therefore no 
interaction related to inhibition of these transporters by pitolisant is expected at the therapeutic 
concentrations. 
- Pitolisant inhibits OATP1B1 and 1B3 with an IC50> 322 µM and 181 µM, respectively. According to 
the estimated cut-off value at the hepatocyte level, for both uptake transporters, of 21.5 µM (25×C inletu 
 for the highest therapeutic dose = 40 mg/day), these IC50 are far higher. Therefore, a clinically 
relevant interaction due to OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibition by pitolisant is unlikely.  
- Pitolisant inhibits OCT1, with an IC50<1.33 µM (the lowest concentration tested) which is close to the 
estimated cut-off value at the hepatocyte level, for this transporter, of 21.5 µM (25×C inlet u  for the 
highest therapeutic dose = 40 mg/day).  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Pitolisant is an active antagonist/inverse agonist (Ki of 0.3 nM) of the human histamine H3 receptor 
(H3R). It triggers a long-lasting activation of histaminergic neurons in brain, a neuronal system 
involved in the maintenance of wakefulness, attention and cognition. Pitolisant crosses the blood-brain 
barrier and elicits histamine release in the whole CNS accompanied by release of other wake-
promoting neurotransmitters (dopamine, noradrenaline and acetylcholine) in cerebral cortex, 
presumably via an indirect mechanism. Dopamine release in nucleus accumbens is not affected, which 
differentiates it from other wake-promoting agents i.e. amphetamine-like psychostimulants. 
Primary pharmacology  
Studies in healthy volunteers after single and repeated doses of pitolisant have included various 
psychometric tests as well as quantitative EEG recording to investigate the effects of Pitolisant on 
vigilance, attention, coordination, memory, sleep and satiety. 
In study P02-02 (double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled single dose study), 36 healthy 
volunteers received single oral dose of pitolisant (1, 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 mg) or placebo. Results from 
qEEG showed that activities increased two hours after single 40 and 60 mg of pitolisant oral 
administration on anterior leads (20-30 Hz band) and posterior leads (16 to 40 Hz bands). 
In study P03-03 (double-blind, ascending, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study), 8 healthy 
volunteers received repeated oral dose of pitolisant 40 mg/d (n=6) or placebo (n=2) for 9 days. 
Results from qEEG records indicate that pitolisant is associated with a trend of increasing beta 
frequencies in the anterior leads, and decreasing the alpha frequencies more markedly in the posterior 
leads.  
Secondary pharmacology 
A dedicated QT study (a randomised, double-blind, 4-periods, crossover study), comparing single 
doses of 40 mg and 120 mg of pitolisant to a single dose of 400 mg of moxifloxacin and to placebo was 
conducted to assess the effect of pitolisant on ventricular repolarization. This study showed that 
pitolisant at 40 mg/d did not increase the QTc (mean observed variation of 3.7 ms; with 5.9 ms for 
upper bound of the CI90%). However, at the supra-therapeutic dose of 120 mg/d, the mean change 
was ~10 ms, with an upper bound of the CI 90% of 12.2 ms, suggesting a risk of QT/QTc prolongation 
at this dose of 120 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 37/102 
  
  
Effects of pitolisant on QTcF interval at supra-therapeutic doses are confirmed by results from the 
additional Phase I study, where following pitolisant doses of 160 mg, 200 mg and 240 mg, the ΔΔQTcF 
was >5 ms at the three 3 doses, with a 95% upper bound of the predicted effect above 10 ms (11.9, 
13.3 and 9.9 ms respectively). 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
Concomitant administration of tri or tetracyclic antidepressants (e.g. imipramine, clomipramine, 
mirtazapine) and anti-histamines (H1-receptor antagonists) crossing the hemato-encephalic barrier 
(e.g. pheniramine maleate, chlorpheniramine, diphenydramine, promethazine, mepyramine) with 
pitolisant is not recommended since the endogenous histamine released in brain by these treatments 
could be altered. 
No clinical data supporting this assumption were provided. However, this interaction is 
pharmacologically plausible since pitolisant and these two classes of products target the same 
histamine brain receptors. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In addition to nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies (in vitro metabolite profiling, CYP inhibition and 
induction, P-gp substrate evaluation and protein binding), clinical pharmacology investigation has been 
performed in humans. Full PK profiling has been performed in a total of 14 PK studies. A population PK 
analysis of pooled data of healthy subjects (male and female, young and elderly) has been submitted 
and showed that i) pitolisant could be modelled according to a bi-compartmental model with a 0-order 
absorption, ii) pitolisant t1/2 was within a range centered on 10-11 h. This means that, considering a 
once daily administration, steady-state should be reached within less than one week; and iii) CL/F was 
found to decrease with both pitolisant dose and duration of administration 
The primary pharmacology data were obtained from qEEG recording in healthy volunteers. Even 
though limited, these data suggest an effect of pitolisant on vigilance and arousal. 
Several analytical methods by liquid chromatography were developed to measure pitolisant and/or its 
metabolites. All methods employed in the PK studies (except those used in the mass-balance study) 
have been validated and their performances were fit for purpose. 
The CHMP identified several shortcomings in the documentation provided on the pharmacokinetics of 
pitolisant. There were many discrepancies between the values of PK parameters in the different studies 
reports. Despite further analysis of the available data provided by the Applicant, there still are gaps in 
the understanding of the pharmacokinetics of the drug, introducing uncertainty in the assessment of 
the safety and efficacy of the product when administered to different subgroups or when co-
administered with other drugs. These gaps include basic pharmacokinetic properties of pitolisant.  
Major elimination pathways are insufficiently understood for the drug and require additional 
investigations. Therefore, the Applicant has been requested to perform a new balance study after 
repeated dose administration in order to identify the major metabolites and characterize their PK 
behaviour and the mechanisms underlying their formation. This study will be conducted as a post-
approval measure.  
Considering the non-linearity of pitolisant and the pronounced time-dependency, the PK of the drug in 
patients with renal and hepatic impairment could not be safely predicted from the single-dose study 
data, especially as the mechanism underlying this non linearity is still unknown. Therefore, the SPC has 
been amended in order to reflect the lack of data in these sub-groups of patients. Influence of severe 
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) on pitolisant PK was not investigated. Consequently, a 
corresponding contraindication has been introduced in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 38/102 
  
  
Understanding of the pharmacokinetics of pitolisant in the elderly was considered insufficient, 
particularly noting the doubling of drug exposure noted in renal impairment patients (mild to severe). 
Very limited data are available in this sub-group of patients precluding safe recommendations. This 
lack of information has been reflected in the SPC. 
PK investigations have been carried out on the three major metabolites in humans BP2.951, BP1.8054 
and BP1.9733. Based on calculated IC50, the major metabolite BP2.951 showed a weak inhibitory 
potential on CYP2D6 and 2C19 but this is not expected to have any clinically relevant impact at the 
circulating concentrations. The two other major metabolites are devoid of inhibitory potential on major 
CYP and UGT isoforms.  
In vitro studies have shown the inducing effect of pitolisant as well as of BP2.951 and BP1.8054, two of 
the three main metabolites, on CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. Only with CYP3A4 and CYP2B6, this 
effect is expected to be clinically relevant. Therefore, the CHMP requested that the impact of pitolisant 
on CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 will be investigated in a DDI study with probe CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrates 
post-approval. 
The CHMP also requested that the Applicants conducts post-approval study assessing pitolisant 
pharmacokinetics in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. This issue has been considered to be an important 
safety risk knowing the major involvement of CYP2D6 in the overall metabolic clearance of pitolisant. 
Based on the results of itraconazole study, the CHMP concluded that clinically relevant interactions 
following the co-administration of pitolisant with inhibitors of CYP3A4 is unlikely. However, these 
results were not expected since in vitro data demonstrated the major role of CYP3A4 (and CYP2D6) in 
the metabolism of pitolisant, in accordance to the significant decrease (about 50%) of pitolisant 
exposure observed with rifampicin. 
The results of paroxetine study were consistent with in vitro data that showed the involvement of 
CYP2D6 in the metabolism pathway of pitolisant. Given the 2-fold increase of pitolisant exposure when 
co-administered with paroxetine and the safety profile of pitolisant from phase II and III trials, the 
CHMP concluded that co-administration of pitolisant with inhibitors of CYP2D6 (including some 
antidepressants) should be done with caution and appropriate warning was included in the SmPC. 
The mechanism explaining results of olanzapine study is unclear. The Applicant proposed a possible 
competition between olanzapine and pitolisant 60mg on the intestinal sites of the P-gp efflux proteins. 
Olanzapine would have a higher affinity for this protein, leading to an increase of pitolisant exposure. 
However, the current non clinical data show that pitolisant is not P-gp substrate. Additionally, as 
regard to olanzapine, a CYP2D6 inhibition by pitolisant cannot be supported because olanzapine is 
mainly metabolized by UGT1A4 and CYP1A2.  
Furthermore, even though DDI studies are not sufficiently powered to assess the safety profile of a 
combination, this study did not indicate any clinically meaningful trend. Indeed, the co-administration 
of pitolisant 60 mg with olanzapine 5 mg appeared to reduce the deleterious effects of olanzapine on 
vigilance and satiety, while maintaining a good tolerance. No clear correlation between the pitolisant 
and olanzapine co-administration dose level could be established when investigating the 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles.  
The pharmacokinetic interactions of pitolisant on olanzapine, and vice versa, were statistically 
significant but the low number of subjects included, the conflicting results with both olanzapine doses 
2.5 and 5 mg, compared to in vitro and theoretical data, do not allow a conclusion to be drawn. Based 
on in vitro data, the CHMP agreed that pitolisant and its main metabolites are not expected to inhibit 
CYP2D6 in a clinically relevant way.  
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 39/102 
  
  
No data have been submitted around potential interactions related to UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT) in the original application. However, several glucuronide and sulphate conjugated metabolites 
were identified in humans with two major ones (greater than 10%) corresponding to a glycine 
conjugate and a glucuronide metabolite of pitolisant. Furthermore, considering pitolisant as a victim 
drug, clinical data related to CYP3A4 appeared inconsistent compared to in vitro data. The co-
administration of rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer, with pitolisant decreased the extent of exposure 
of pitolisant by about 50%, while itraconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, did not significantly affect PK 
of pitolisant. As rifampicin also induces 2C8/2C9, not originally identified as contributing to the 
elimination of pitolisant, these results raised a concern on the possible involvement of other enzymes 
in the metabolism of pitolisant such as UGTs (rifampicin acts also as an inducer of UGTs). 
Consequently, the lack of any data from in vitro interaction studies with UGTs has been identified as an 
important gap. The in vitro study submitted in response to this concern showed no ability for pitolisant 
and of its three major metabolites to be an UGT inhibitor. The Applicant has also submitted in vitro 
study data showing that pitolisant and its three major metabolites are devoid of induction potential of 
UGT isoforms.  
As pitolisant undergoes glucuronidation mainly by UGT 2B7, the CHMP was of the opinion that impact 
of an inhibitor on this enzyme should be assessed. Consequently, a DDI study investigating this issue 
has been included in the RMP as post-approval measure.  
The genetic polymorphism of the iso-enzyme CYP2D6 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase is known to 
modulate the enzyme capability. The CHMP noted that in a number of pharmacokinetic studies samples 
were collected to determine 2D6, 3A4 and PgP genotype. CYP2D6 seems to be involved in pitolisant 
metabolism so in order to evaluate the impact of CYP2D6 polymorphism, 3 PMs will be investigated in 
the above mentioned new mass-balance study. 
Pitolisant may be administered with modafinil or oxybate. It is expected that modafinil, as a moderate 
enzyme inducer, would give rise to decrease pitolisant exposure. Therefore, the interaction potential 
between these drugs will be investigated in a currently ongoing clinical interaction study. This study 
has been included as post-authorisation measure in the RMP.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
The Applicant should perform the following studies: 
- A mass balance study with drug radiolabelled in a non-labile position. This ADME investigation should 
be performed at steady state. 
- A study assessing pitolisant pharmacokinetics in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. 
- DDI study with CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 probe substrates. 
- DDI study with an UGT2B7 inhibitor. In case of inconclusive results, the Applicant will have to further 
investigate the elimination profile of pitolisant. 
- DDI studies with modafinil and sodium oxybate. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
In the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), pitolisant was tested in Obstructive Sleep 
Apnoea (OSA) disease, Parkinson disease and narcolepsy.

Four phase II studies were conducted in Parkinson disease (P05-05, P06-10, P06-11 and P07-02) and 
three in OSA (P04-01, P05-01 and P09-16).  
Narcolepsy development program included 8 phase II/III open-label, simple or double-blind studies 
(see Table 7 below), of which two (P07-03 [Harmony I] and P09-15 [Harmony Ibis]) were considered 
pivotal for the claimed indication in the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in adults.

No formal dose-finding study in narcolepsy was performed which was justified by the Applicant by the 
difficulties to recruit patients in this orphan indication. 
The data available from two phase II studies (P05-03 and P06-06) in narcoleptic patients support the 
use of pitolisant in a titration scheme, i.e. instauration at a progressive increase-dose until the 
normalisation of symptomatology and as far as no adverse event occurs; and in case of signs of over-
dosage, reduction of the dose to the immediate lower level.

In P05-03 study, a sequential 2-week single arm, single-blind, phase II trial, pitolisant was given at an 
oral dose of 40 mg for one week (after one week of placebo) in 22 narcoleptic patients. In this study, 
pitolisant reduced the excessive diurnal somnolence with an improvement of the ESS score of 4.89 ± 
1.32 compared to placebo period (p=0.0006). The reported adverse events in this study were more 
frequently observed during the 3 first days of treatment supporting a titration therapeutic scheme, 
starting with a lower dose than 40 mg/day. 
P06-06 study was a multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled phase II study.  In this study, pitolisant was 
given in an escalating dose regimen (10, 20 or 40 mg/day) for up to 9 months in 26 narcoleptic 
patients. Pitolisant was started at the dose of 10 mg/day during the first week and this dose was 
continued or increased up to 40 mg/d during the next three weeks according to the opinion of the 
investigator on the basis of the efficacy and the tolerance. Pitolisant reduced the mean ESS scores by 
4.8, 5.3 points and 6.9 points after 1, 3 and 9 months of treatment, respectively. 
In addition, the Applicant provided results from two dose-finding studies conducted in EDS in Parkinson 
disease (P07-02) and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) (P09-16) to justify the dose selection.  
Study P07-02 was a double-blind parallel group trial comparing placebo to four daily doses of pitolisant 
(5, 10, 20 and 40 mg) in the treatment of EDS in Parkinson disease patients. The primary endpoint 
was ESS scores change between the treatments groups, on the 4-week treatment period. In the IT 
population, the ESS score change between inclusion and final visits (primary endpoint) did not show 
significant difference between the 5 treatment groups (p=0.069). However, it was concluded that on 
an IT basis, using Linear Contrasts (analysis used for the assessment of a monotonic increase of 
measured endpoints with different doses), a significant increasing effect of dose on efficacy was found 
(p=0.0176) with pitolisant on ESS: the higher was the dose, the better was the efficacy, and by using 
step-down contrasts, the 20 mg dosage was identified as the MED (minimum effective dose), 
p=0.0357. 
Study P09-16 was a double-blind parallel group trial comparing placebo to four daily doses of pitolisant 
(5, 10, 20 and 40 mg) in the treatment of EDS in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. The primary 
endpoint was ESS scores change between the treatments groups over 2 weeks. The results from this 
study showed that pitolisant decreased daytime sleepiness in a dose-dependent manner (p=0.0003). 
ESS reduction between baseline and final visit was: -4 for 5 mg/d group, -4.7 for 10 mg/d group, -7 
for 20 mg/d, and -8.2 for 40 mg/d in patients with nCPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure). 
Similar results were observed in patients refusing nCPAP and overall population. 
Since narcolepsy, Parkinson and OSA are different diseases, the “extrapolation” of results from the two 
later studies should be used with caution. Study P09-16 was conducted after the completion of the first 
pivotal study (Harmony I), but before the second pivotal study (Harmony Ibis). 
Results from study P04-06 (PK study conducted in 6 healthy volunteers receiving a repeated oral dose 
of 40 mg of pitolisant for 14 days, and according to the tolerability, were to receive a repeated oral 
dose of 50 mg or 30 mg for other 14 days) showed that the repeated dose of 50 mg/d of pitolisant 
during 14 days after other 14 days at 40 mg/d was well-tolerated.  
The justification for not using the upper dose (40 mg/d) in the second pivotal study was related to the 
results from the first pivotal study (Harmony I) showing that 12 out of 32 (37.5%) patients from 
pitolisant arm stayed at this dose until the end of the study. Moreover, the 20 mg/d group showed 
numerically better results on ESS scores (mean final score=8.1; reduction of 9.1 points from baseline) 
than 40 mg/d group (mean final score=12.9; reduction of 5.3 points from baseline) (see results of 
Harmony I and Ibis in the respective sections).

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study 07-03 Prospective, randomized double-blind study, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
multi-center trial assessing the effects of BF2.649 in treatment of excessive daytime 
sleepiness in narcolepsy (Harmony I) 
Methods 
Study design 
The schematic representation of study design is presented in Figure 1 below.  
Figure 1. Study P07-03 (Harmony I) design. 
Study Participants  
Adult male and female subjects in good physical health who met the International Classification of 
Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) criteria for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy were eligible for inclusion in 
this study. The required EDS score was > 14 points/24 at baseline.  
Patients had to be free of drugs or discontinue any psychostimulant medications for at least 14 days at 
the start of baseline period. Patients with severe cataplexy were permitted to remain on stable dose of 
their anticataplectic (oxybate) or supposed anticataplectic medications (antidepressant or SSRIs).  
Treatments 
Pitolisant, modafinil and placebo were provided as capsules. Each capsule contained either tablets 
(pitolisant or modafinil plus lactose as filler) or lactose only (placebo).  
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015

A study drug regimen involving increasing doses of pitolisant and modafinil was chosen in order to 
determine the best individual dosage based on clinical efficacy and tolerance criteria (individual dose 
titration). The dosing regimen was once daily in the morning for pitolisant, and twice daily in the 
morning and at noon for modafinil.  
Objectives 
The main efficacy objective was to demonstrate superiority of pitolisant compared to placebo on 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score in narcoleptic patients with Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) 
treated for 3 weeks with dose adaptation and followed by 5-week stable doses. 
Secondary efficacy objectives were:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
to explore non-inferiority of pitolisant as compared to modafinil on ESS score, 
to evaluate responders rate on ESS score, 
to  evaluate  drug  effects  on  daytime  sleepiness  via  measurements  including  Maintenance  of 
Wakefulness Test (MWT), patient’s sleep diaries and sustained attention to response task (SART),  
to  evaluate  drug  effects  on  cataplexy  by  measurement  of  frequency  of  cataplexy  crisis  on  the 
“sleep diary”.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint was a comparison, using a linear mixed effect model, of the difference in ESSF 
between the pitolisant and placebo groups, adjusted for ESSB and using treatment and centre as fixed 
and random effects, respectively. 
Main secondary endpoints were ESS Responder Rate (≤ 10), MWT, Sustained Attention to Response 
Task (SART), Number/Severity of Cataplexy Attacks (Total & Partial), Clinical Global Impressions of 
Change (CGI-C) and European Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D). 
Sample size 
The sample size was calculated under the following hypotheses derived from historical trials; the 
minimum clinically relevant difference on ESSF was 3, ESS Standard Deviation assumed to be σ=5, 
estimated coefficient of correlation r(ESSB, ESSF) = ρ=0.65, and compound symmetry for the 
repeated measurements. The Non-inferiority Margin (NIM) was estimated by the Applicant as a small 
proportion of the difference between the reference and placebo and less than the minimum clinically 
important difference. From meta-analytical results on historical trials of modafinil this difference was 
∆=4.12, 95%CI [0.14, 7.09], a value of NIM=2 was considered as a relevant value. Using the power 
function of ANCOVA, and under the above assumptions, the sample size was determined by separately 
examining the two hierarchical tests: 1) A difference as large as ∆=3 with the following parameters 
(two-sided α=0.05, pre-visits=2, post-visits=2, r=0.65) was found detectable with a power of at least 
95%, once the sample size exceeds n=30 patients/group. 2) Assuming that the two drugs have the 
same efficacy, the probability to reject at a pre-determined fixed margin NIM=2 associated with the 
following parameters (α=0.025, pre-visits=2, post-visits=2, r=0.65) will be at least 80%, once the 
sample size exceeds n=30 patients/group. Thus, to satisfy the requirement of the two tests, 30 
patients per group were planned. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was centralised and performed in blocks of 6: 2 pitolisant, 2 modafinil and 2 placebo.  
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 44/102 
  
  
Blinding (masking) 
The investigational treatments were provided as non-openable capsules that were identical in 
appearance to ensure that neither the patient nor the investigator or the clinical staff knew the identity 
of the study medication. Since it was a dose adjusted trial, the existence of “low”, “middle” and “high” 
packs for each treatment arm of treatment allowed up- and down-titration of treatment.  
Statistical methods 
All statistical analyses conducted for the evaluation of efficacy were performed on the EIT, IT, and PP 
populations. 
- IT Population (Main selection): The Intent-to-Treat (IT) population consisted of all randomized 
patients having taken at least one dose of drug and provided at least one value after baseline.  
- EIT Population: The Extended Intent-to-Treat (EIT) population consisted of all randomized patients, 
regardless if treatment was initiated and irrespective of their outcome.  
- PP Population: The Per-Protocol (PP) population consisted of all patients in the IT population who 
completed the study until at least V6, (i.e. having one value at V6 or V7), and without any major 
protocol deviation related to primary endpoint. 
Main analysis - EDS measured by ESS: The significance of the active tested drug compared with 
placebo was assessed by Analysis of Covariance on Final ESS adjusted for baseline ESS. ANCOVA was 
conducted with a Mixed Linear Model taking into account centre heterogeneity. Due to multiple 
comparisons of treatments, the multiplicity of type 1 error has been taken into account using a step-
down approach: the two subsequent tests of superiority (pitolisant>placebo) and non-inferiority 
(pitolisant vs modafinil) on a fixed Non-Inferiority margin (NIM) were tested using the same alpha 
level. 
More precisely, the non-inferiority testing was to be performed following two subsequent steps: Step 1. 
H01: pitolisant ≤ placebo had to be rejected at α= 0.025. The comparison between pitolisant and 
modafinil was to be only assessed when H01 was rejected. Step 2: H02: pitolisant ≤ modafinil – θ (θ 
being the non-inferiority margin) had to be tested at the same pre-specified significance level. If both 
hypotheses were rejected, the gold standard non-inferiority trial should, as a general rule, be termed 
successful. The main ANCOVA model assumed no treatment-baseline interaction term (CPMP 2003). 
Other efficacy criteria 
Two-way comparisons between treatment groups were planned via ANCOVA, where baseline 
adjustment on associated baseline values had to be conducted where appropriate. 
Parameters involving duration of time, standard survival analysis were planned with adjustment on 
baseline values where appropriate. 
For MWT and SART, the significance of treatment difference was tested according to a Mann Whitney 
test, as from previous studies, the measured endpoint could not be considered as normally distributed. 
The difference between placebo and pitolisant, and pitolisant and modafinil was tested by calculating 
absolute risk difference (and 95%CI) of the proportion of patients for which the increase of the 
measured endpoint from V3 to V7 exceeded a pre-determined Minimum Clinical Relevance.  
Handling of dropouts or missing data 
For patients without ESS scores at V6 or V7, ESSF was the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
value. Missing data for secondary endpoints were not imputed.

Results 
Participant flow 
Disposition of patients in Harmony I study. 
Recruitment 
This study was conducted in 24 centres in Europe. The first patient was enrolled on 26 May 2009 and 
last study visit was performed on 30 June 2010. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol has been amended three times. The modifications included removal of the upper age limit 
for inclusion and modification of statistical analysis from superiority to non-inferiority versus 
comparator (modafinil). 
Baseline data 
There were no clinically relevant differences between groups for any of the characteristics examined. 
The median age of the included patients ranged from 33 to 40 years in the 3 treatment groups. More 
Assessment report

than 90% of the population was Caucasian and approximately 50% was male, with no statistical 
differences between groups, as for the body weight, height and BMI.  
The baseline characteristics of narcolepsy by treatment group for patients in the IT population showed 
no statistically significant differences for any of the parameters evaluated (p>0.05 for all 
comparisons). The median duration since the diagnosis of narcolepsy was 14.9 years in the placebo 
group, 10.6 years in the pitolisant group and 11.7 years in the modafinil group. 80% of the enrolled 
patients reported a history of cataplexy. No patients reported a history of drug abuse or dependence 
disorder. More than one-half of the enrolled patients reported histories of sleep paralysis, 
hallucinations or dyssomnia. Less than half reported automatic behaviour. A Multiple Sleep Latency 
Test (MSLT) was performed in 58 patients out of 94. Mean latency time at baseline seemed to be 
shorter in the pitolisant group (p>0.05). There were no statistical differences between groups on ESS, 
CGI-S EDS, CGI-S cataplexy, EQ-5D, SART-NOGO, SART-GO, SART-TOTAL and MWT baseline mean 
scores. 
Patients with severe cataplexy were permitted to remain on their anticataplectic (sodium oxybate) or 
supposed anticataplectic medications (antidepressive drugs e.g. venlafaxine) at stable doses. Such 
treatments were administered for at least 1 month prior to the trial and maintained at stable dose for 
the duration of the trial in 33 patients. There were no statistically significant differences between 
treatment groups with respect to this parameter. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 110 patients were considered eligible to participate to the study and to initiate the wash-out 
period. Of these, 95 were randomized to receive treatment (EIT sample). The IT population (all 
randomized patients having taken at least one dose of drug and provided at least one value after 
baseline) included all patients (30/30) from placebo group, 31 of 32 patients from pitolisant group 
(one patient excluded from the IT analysis since they did not take study treatment and did not go to 
the visits after randomization) and all patients (33/33) from modafinil group.  
The PP Population (all patients in the IT population who completed the study until at least V6 and 
without any major protocol deviation related to primary endpoint) was composed of 25 (of 30) patients 
from placebo group, 26 (of 31) patients from pitolisant group and 28 (of 33) patients from modafinil 
group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The mean ESSB were 18.9 ± 2.5 (SD), 17.8 ± 2.5 and 18.5 ± 2.7 in the placebo (PL), pitolisant (BF) 
and modafinil (MD) groups respectively (IT population). By study end, mean ESS score reductions from 
baseline were -3.4 ± 4.2 in the placebo group, -5.8 ± 6.2 in the pitolisant group and -6.9 ± 6.2 in the 
modafinil group.  
The results of the primary endpoint analysis are presented in Table 8 below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 47/102 
  
  
Table 8. Efficacy analysis results for ESS scores in Harmony I study (IT, EIT, PP populations). 
Results from the IT analysis of the primary endpoint showed that pitolisant was clinically and 
statistically significant compared to placebo (-3.33 points; 95%IC [-5.83; -0.83]; p < 0.05). These 
results were based on baseline observation carried forward analysis.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
As the analysis on primary endpoint met pre-defined criteria, showing that pitolisant was better than 
placebo on adjusted ESSF difference, a second analysis of non-inferiority of pitolisant with respect to 
modafinil was performed. 
The mean difference between the two active treatments was of 0.12 (95%CI: -2.5 to 2.7), rejecting 
the hypothesis of non-inferiority of pitolisant compared to modafinil based on a non-inferiority margin 
(NIM) of 2. 
The robustness of these data was confirmed when a fixed effects ANCOVA model was used on the 
primary endpoint in the IT and PP populations for both pitolisant vs placebo and pitolisant vs modafinil, 
adjusting for baseline ESS and with and without centre adjustment.  
Responder rate on ESS scores (ESS < 10 points), showed that pitolisant was significantly superior to 
placebo (OR=9.24 [3.82-22.35]; p<0.001), and not statistically different from modafinil (OR=1.06 
[0.44; 2.54]; p=0.894), supporting results from primary endpoint.

Superiority of pitolisant compared to placebo was also observed on MWT (objective secondary 
endpoint), pitolisant significantly increased wakefulness maintenance time by 1.47 min (p=0.044) 
compared to placebo. 
The effect of pitolisant was also assessed on cataplexy in this study by measuring the daily cataplexy 
rate (DCR). According to the results using a reciprocal of the number of days of exposure as an 
imputation method, pitolisant showed statistically significant reduction of DCR compared to the placebo

(RR=0.38, 95%CI [0.16; 0.93]; p=0.034), when no significant difference was observed between 
pitolisant and modafinil on this parameter (RR=0.70, 95%CI [0.297; 1.629]; p=0.396).  
Results from quality of life measurements (EQ5D) did not show statistically significant differences 
among the three arms treatment (placebo, pitolisant and modafinil), but the estimates of the 
differences in EQ5D of pitolisant compared to placebo and modafinil were positive (in favour of 
pitolisant). 
The CGI-S on cataplexy was assessed by the investigator. At baseline, the CGI-S of cataplexy mean 
score was around 3.3 (max = 6 points) reflecting “slight to moderate” form of cataplexy and was 
homogeneous between all 3 therapeutic groups (p=0.440). The results of the CGI-C on cataplexy were 
assessed only in the patients who experienced cataplexy during the trial. There was no significant 
difference between treatment groups at all visits, including V7. 
Ancillary analyses 
Patients with a “stable dose” were those who received the same dose of medication from the titration 
visit through the final visit (last 5 weeks of treatment). In pitolisant arm, low, medium and high doses 
were respectively 10, 20 and 40 mg/d, and in modafinil arm 100, 200 and 400 mg/d, respectively, as 
shown in Table 10 below.  
Table 10. Summary of stable dose stage [% (n)] in Harmony I study. 
In pitolisant group, more than 60% of the patients reached and pursued the study at the stable dose 
of 40 mg/d, as compared to ~26% and 6.5% of patients stabilised at the doses of 20 and 10 mg/d, 
respectively.  
When analyzing ESS results in the medium and the high stable doses groups in pitolisant population, 
the medium stable dose (20 mg/d) showed numerically better results on ESS scores (mean final 
score=8.1; reduction of 9.1 points from baseline) than the high stable dose (40 mg/d; mean final 
score=12.9; reduction of 5.3 points from baseline). The same trend was also seen on responder rate, 
where 62.5% of patients from the medium stable dose subgroup compared to 36.8% of patients from 
the high stable dose subgroup were considered as responders (ESS ≤ 10) at final visit.

The design of Harmony Ibis study was similar to Harmony I design. The difference was the initiation 
dose and the maximal dose of pitolisant used the Harmony Ibis, 5 mg and 20 mg/d, respectively 
compared to 10 and 40 mg/d in Harmony I study. 
The choice of the maximal dose of 20 mg/d was justified by the Applicant as follows: 
1.  a  dose-range  study  conducted  in  patients  with  Parkinson’s  Disease  and  diurnal  sleepiness 
showed that 20 mg OD was the minimum effective dose and its effect on ESS was not different 
to the effect observed with the 40 mg OD dose,  
2. 
in Harmony I study (P07-03), one quarter of patients received the 20 mg OD dose during the 
6-week stable dose phase and had their ESS score dramatically improved,  
3.  the  comparison  of  results  of  both  studies  Harmony  I  (P07-03)  and  Harmony  Ibis  (P09-10) 
conducted  according  to  similar  protocols,  with  the  exception  of  the  dose,  replaces  a  dose-
finding study in the indication of narcolepsy. 
Study Participants  
Patient population in this study was similar to Harmony I study. The baseline ESS score had to be ≥ 
14/24.  
Treatments 
Pitolisant, modafinil and placebo were provided as capsules. Each capsule contained either tablets 
(pitolisant or modafinil plus lactose as filler) or lactose only (placebo).  
Objectives 
The efficacy objectives were similar to those of Harmony I study: demonstrate superiority of pitolisant 
compared to placebo on ESS score in narcoleptic patients with EDS after 8 weeks of treatment; explore 
non-inferiority of pitolisant as compared to modafinil on ESS score and evaluate drug effects via 
measurements including MWT, SART and cataplexy rate.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary and key secondary endpoints were the same as in Harmony I study.  
In addition, polysomnographic (PSG) recording was performed in the sleep laboratory the night before 
V3 (at baseline) and before V7 (at endpoint) for the first 20 patients enrolled in three selected centres; 
3 patients in the placebo group, 8 in the pitolisant group and 9 in the modafinil group. PSG was 
performed to evaluate the study drug effect on the different sleep parameters in patients with 
narcolepsy, and especially whether pitolisant could induce insomnia or sleep disturbance. 
Sample size 
The sample size was designed under a step-down analysis using the power function of ANCOVA, to 
assess two hierarchical tests: 
a.  Superiority  of  pitolisant  compared  to  placebo,  with  a  difference  on  ESSF  of  at  least  D=3  and 
the  following  parameters  [two-sided  α  =  0.05,  estimated  coefficient  of  correlation  r(ESSB, 
ESSF) = ρ= 0.7, σ=5] with a power of 95%. 
b.  Non-inferiority of pitolisant compared to modafinil, with a non-inferiority margin (NIM) fixed to 
2 and the following parameters (α = 0.05, r = 0.7, σ=5). 
To satisfy the requirement of the two tests, sample sizes of 20 (placebo), 40 (modafinil) and 40 
(pitolisant) was suggested. A 1:2:2 randomization ratio was chosen because: a) this was a superiority 
test (placebo><verum), and a non-inferiority test (verum><modafinil). Because the non-inferiority 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 51/102 
  
  
test requires more patients, the size of the placebo arm was reduced, b) the size of the two verum 
arms was increased. However, as non-inferiority had to be concluded both on Intent to Treat and Per 
Protocol bases, it was necessary to increase the sample sizes by 20%. In these conditions, the sample 
sizes was initially 25 (placebo), 50 (pitolisant), 50 (modafinil). 
The estimation of sample size was modified following the preliminary results of Harmony I study. The 
Pearson Linear Coefficient Study R was evaluated at R=0.37 [95%CI 0.151 to 0.508], a value not 
compatible with the original assumption of R=0.7, planned in this study. This sample size was 
calculated on this new basis: A smaller value of R was fixed to its observed upper bound R=0.5. 
As a result of these calculations, the total sample size in modafinil and pitolisant groups had to be at 
least 75/group and the sample size of the placebo group had to be at least 35. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was centralized and performed via an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) which 
was set up in blocks of 5: 2 pitolisant, 2 modafinil and 1 placebo. Attribution of treatments to the 
centres was performed by treatment units according to the randomization list.  
Blinding (masking) 
Pitolisant, modafinil and placebo were provided in sealed capsules. The capsules were identical in 
appearance and taste to ensure that neither the patient nor the investigator or members of the clinical 
staff knew the identity of the study medication. The therapeutic units were prescribed to patients in 
accordance with an individual titration program and the posology determined during the titration 
phase.  
Statistical methods 
Statistical methods were similar to those used in Harmony I study.  Statistical analyses were 
conducted on the EIT, IT, and PP populations. For the main efficacy endpoint analysis of covariance on 
final ESS adjusted for baseline with treatment considered as a fixed factor and centre as a random 
effect was used. Superiority test of pitolisant compared with placebo and Non-inferiority test of 
pitolisant compared with modafinil were simultaneously tested by a hierarchical procedure (step-down 
approach). For the secondary efficacy endpoint logistic regression model adjusted on baseline (ESS 
responders), Student’s t-test and geometric mean (MWT, SART), quasi-Poisson regression model 
(Daily Cataplexy Rate) were used.

Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled in 26 centres in 8 countries. The first patient was enrolled in the study on 
October 25th, 2010; the last study visit was on July 24th, 2012.  
Conduct of the study 
The protocol has been amended on May 4th 2011. The major modifications concerned change in the 
planned sample size and changes regarding the analysis of patients’ sleep diaries. Among the data 
collected by patients in their sleep diaries, only cataplexies (partial and total crisis) were analysed. 
Baseline data 
Patients included in this study were in majority Caucasian (~85%). The average age was 40 years. 
Around 53% of the patients were female. There was no statistically significant difference between 
treatment groups with regards to the baseline demographic characteristics. 
The baseline characteristics of narcolepsy showed no statistically significant differences between 
treatment groups for any of the parameters evaluated. The time elapsed since narcolepsy diagnosis 
was between 0 and 62 years at baseline and was not statistically significantly different between 
treatment groups (median=11, 15, 10 years in the placebo, pitolisant, modafinil groups respectively; 
p=0.715). Mean baseline ESS score was 18 in each treatment group. The proportion of patients with 
history of cataplexy was between 75 and 81% and similar between treatment groups.  
Numbers analysed 
183 patients were selected, of which 166 were randomized (EIT population): 33 in the placebo group, 
67 in the pitolisant group and 66 in the modafinil group. 
IIT population included 164 patients. 152 patients had no major protocol violation and did not 
prematurely withdrew the study and therefore constitute PP population; 30 patients (93.9%) in 
placebo group, 60 (89.6%) in the pitolisant group and 62 (95.4%) in the modafinil group. 
The number of premature withdrawals was higher in pitolisant group (n=7) compared to modafinil 
(n=3) and placebo groups (n=2). In pitolisant group, adverse events were main reason for a 
premature withdrawal (4 out of 7). 
Withdrawal for lack of efficacy was limited in Harmony Ibis study (n=2): one in placebo group and the 
other in pitolisant group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Mean ESS score reductions from baseline were -3.6 ± 5.6 in the placebo group, -4.6 ± 4.6 in the 
pitolisant group and -7.8 ± 5.9 in the modafinil group as shown in Table 12 below.

* ESSBL = (ESSV2 + ESSV3)/2; ** ESSF = (ESSV6 + ESSV7)/2; ‡ MEAN = Arithmetic mean across all visits 
between ESSBL and ESSF. 
The primary endpoint analysis showed non-significant ESS score decrease with pitolisant compared to 
placebo [-1.94 (-4.05, 0.07); p=0.065].  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Responder rate on ESS scores, according to responder definition in this study (“ESS final ≤ 10 points 
or ESS baseline – ESS final > 3 points”), showed that pitolisant was significantly superior to placebo 
(RR=0.60 [0.41-0.88]; p=0.008).  
According to MWT results, pitolisant significantly increased the maintenance of wakefulness compared 
to placebo (p=0.009). At final visit, the duration of the maintenance of wakefulness increased in 
pitolisant group (7.79 min; ∆=+1.14 min) where it decreased in placebo group (6.51 min; ∆=-1.39 
min). However, the mean final MWT value in pitolisant group was still less than the threshold of normal 
value of 8 min. 
These results were confirmed by SART scores, where the ratio of mean change between pitolisant and 
placebo was statistically significant (0.83; 95%CI [0.69; 0.99]; p=0.043). 
When non-inferiority analysis of pitolisant compared to modafinil was performed, it was concluded that 
this hypothesis could not be retained, the lower bound of the 95%CI of the difference being smaller 
than the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -2 points (difference=-2.75; 95%CI [-4.48 to -1.02]).

The DCR increased in this study from baseline to final visit in pitolisant group (mean pre-post 
difference of +0.85), but this difference was not significant between pitolisant and placebo groups. 
Meanwhile, in modafinil group, DCR deceased between baseline and final visit (-0.33). These results 
were not consistent with those observed in Harmony I study, where pitolisant performed significantly 
better than placebo and where modafinil was not significantly different from the placebo.  
As for Harmony I study, results from quality of life measurements (EQ5D) did not show statistically 
significant differences among the three arms treatment (placebo, pitolisant and modafinil), but the 
estimates of the differences in EQ5D of pitolisant compared to placebo was positive whereas the 
difference compared to modafinil were negative, but the direction of the observed difference was not 
specified. 
The results on CGI-C on EDS (significant improvement by pitolisant and modafinil compared to 
placebo) and CGI-C on cataplexy (non-significant change between treatment groups) were consistent 
with those observed in Harmony I study.  
Polysomnography was not considered as an efficacy endpoint, since its aim was to evaluate if the 
treatment with pitolisant or modafinil impairs the sleep parameters. PSG was performed in the first 20 
patients enrolled in three selected centres. The results showed that PSG parameters did not 
statistically significantly differ between groups at V3 and at V7. The change between V3 and V7 did not 
also significantly differ between groups, which suggests that pitolisant and modafinil did not impair the 
diurnal sleep. 
Ancillary analyses 
Stable dose analysis 
The daily doses administered during the stable dose phase of the study are presented in Table 13.  
Table 13. Summary of stable dose stage [% (n)] in Harmony Ibis study. 
Analysis of the stable dose range reached in pitolisant groups in both pivotal studies show that 61.3% 
and 62.7% of patients were on the upper stable dose of 40 mg/d and 20 mg/d in Harmony I and Ibis 
studies, respectively. 
Small centres reallocation 
Because there were sites where the 3 treatment groups were unbalanced, the 36 active sites were 
randomly assigned to 5 clusters which replaced the original sites as covariates in regression analyses.  
The results of the IT analysis of the primary endpoint after small-centres reallocation showed a 
significant improvement of -2.19 (95%CI [-4.17 to -0.22]; p=0.030) for pitolisant compared with 
placebo, this difference remained similar across the IT and PP populations.  This difference was not 
clinically relevant as it was lower than the pre-defined threshold of 3 points.

primary endpoint adjusted on original sites (MOD-BF2=-3.1 with p-value=0.0002) would even tend to 
demonstrate the inferiority of pitolisant compared to modafinil with clinically relevant significance.

The  objective  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  to  demonstrate  the 
superiority  of  pitolisant  up  to  40  mg/d  over  placebo  after  8  weeks  of 
treatment (3-week titration period followed by 5-week stable dose). This aim 
was  achieved  allowing  a  second  analysis  of  non-inferiority  of  pitolisant 
compared  to  modafinil  (up  to  400  mg/d)  with  a  predefined  non-inferiority 
margin  threshold  of  2  points.  Since  the  95%IC  interval  of  the  observed 
difference  between  the  two  treatments  included  this  value  [-2.5;  2.7],  this 
hypothesis of non-inferiority of pitolisant compared to modafinil is rejected.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pivotal studies endpoints analysis 
The observed result on the primary endpoint (∆ESS) was clinically relevant (> 3 points) and 
statistically significant (p < 0.05) in the first study where pitolisant was used up to 40 mg/d but 
neither clinically relevant (around 2 points) nor statistically significant [p=0.065] in the second larger 
pivotal study where pitolisant was used up to 20 mg/d. To address this contradiction between results, 
the applicant conducted a pooled statistical analysis of the two pivotal studies based on a general 
Individual Patient Data Analysis model using multiple endpoint O’Brien OLS test combining ESS, MWT 
and SART together. This analysis showed that both low and high doses (20 and 40 mg) were better 
than placebo. The Z score (aggregating ESS, MWT and SART) was significant for both 20mg (Main 
effect Z=-0.56, 95%CI -0.86,-0.27, p<0.001), and 40mg (Main 40mg effect Z=-0.43, 95%CI 0-.83,-
0.03, p=0.04). The separate analyses based on each endpoint alone (ESS, MWT, SART) provided a 
similar trend, even though the results were not statistically significant for 40 mg/d on ESS and MWT 
(p=0.3 and 0.071, respectively).  
Responder definition 
To override the inconsistency in responder definition across pivotal studies the applicant provided a 
post-hoc analysis of responders in both pivotal studies using both responder definitions (“ESS final ≤ 
10 points” and “ESS final ≤ 10 points or ESS final – ESS baseline ≥ 3 points”). This analysis is 
presented in the table below and showed the same trend of responders' rate across pivotal studies 
regardless of responder definition.

Clinical relevance 
To better characterise the efficacy of pitolisant on EDS in narcolepsy, pitolisant results on ESS and 
MWT were compared to those of modafinil issued from 6 historical randomised controlled trails to 
which results from Harmony I and Ibis studies were added. Regarding ESS results, the difference 
between pitolisant 40mg and modafinil was -0.15, 95%CI [-2.89, 2.42], in favour of pitolisant (not 
statistically significant). Based on the same calculation, the difference in ESS between pitolisant 20mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 62/102 
  
  
 
 
 
 
and modafinil was 0.66, 95%CI [-1.42, 2.74], at the advantage of modafinil (not statistically 
significant). Modafinil was characterized by mean increase over baseline of MWT weighted mean 
difference (positive effect) of 3.12 minutes (95%CI [2.32, 3.93], p<.001) compared with placebo. The 
difference in MWT between pitolisant 40mg or 20mg compared with placebo was 5.67 minutes (95%CI 
0.933; 10.42) and 1.57 minutes (95%CI 1.12; 2.20), respectively. When compared to modafinil, the 
differences were not significant for both doses.  
Cataplexy sub-group analysis 
Patients enrolled in pivotal clinical trials were in ~80% cataplectic, which consolidated the diagnosis of 
narcolepsy but raised the question about the effectiveness of pitolisant in both subgroups. This issues 
was resolved as sub-group analysis showed no significant difference on ESS between patients with or 
without cataplexy. 
Patients with cataplexy were allowed to use anticataplectic (sodium oxybate) or supposed 
anticataplectic medications (antidepressive drugs like SSRIs, venlafaxine…) at stable doses in both 
studies. The distribution of concomitant anticataplectic medications was homogenous among the 
treatment arms in both pivotal studies. The potential impact of anticataplectic treatments on overall 
treatment effect of EDS was raised since some anticataplectic (like sodium oxybate) have an 
antinarcoleptic effect. To address this point, a post-hoc analysis was conducted by the applicant 
showing that no additional nor interaction effect of concomitant medication with pitolisant were 
observed in pivotal studies (based on the results of the primary endpoint [ESS] and other secondary 
endpoints [MWT, SART and responders rate]).  
Supportive studies 
Study P09-10 (Harmony III) 
This was a phase III, naturalistic, open-label, prospective, longitudinal, uncontrolled, multicenter trial 
to assess the long-term safety of pitolisant in the treatment of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) in 
narcolepsy (prolonged follow-up).  
This study enrolled patients who completed a double blind controlled study with pitolisant (Harmony I, 
Harmony II [prematurely stopped], Harmony Ibis, or other phase II study in narcolepsy), patients who 
in the opinion of the investigator would not have been able to participate in a double-blind study but 
could benefit from pitolisant or patients receiving pitolisant under French “ATU nominative” procedure. 
The study duration was 12 months.  
Unbiased conclusions on efficacy from this study could not be drawn (open-label study, no reference 
therapy, psychostimulant concomitant treatments, association of naive and already treated patients) 
However, the data analysis allowed to compare the effect of pitolisant in the naturalistic study with 
effects observed in pivotal trials as well as confirm if this effect is maintained over a longer period. 
In this study, 102 narcoleptic patients with or without cataplexy were included, aged 18 to 69 years 
old, with a required baseline ESS score at inclusion ≥12 (mild to severe form of disease).  
The main results showed that: 
- The maximal dose received during the study was 40 mg/d in 88% of patients; 
- The ESS change from baseline to final visit was about -4.3 points, overall of the same magnitude of 
what was observed in Harmony I (-5.8 points) and Harmony Ibis (-4.6 points); 
- Responders’ rate (ESS ≤ 10 or ESSF-ESSB ≥ 3) was of the same magnitude as in Harmony Ibis 
(68.2%), using the same definition of responders.

P11-05 (Harmony CTP) 
This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study of pitolisant versus placebo in narcoleptic 
patients (n=105, aged 18 to 66, mean age ~36 years). The enrolled patients had a high frequency of 
cataplexy (geometric mean weekly cataplexy rate ~8) and a mean ESS baseline value of about 17.  
The primary endpoint was the change in the average number of cataplexy attacks per week (Weekly 
Rate Cataplexy: WRC) between the 2 weeks of baseline (Day-14 to Day 0) and the 4 weeks of stable 
treatment period (D21 to D49). 
Overall, the results showed a beneficial effect of pitolisant on cataplexy: 
• 
The primary analysis on IT population showed a significant improvement in the pitolisant group 
at end of the stable dose treatment period. The WRC has decreased from 7.31 and 9.15 for 
placebo and pitolisant respectively to 6.79 and 3.28 for placebo and pitolisant respectively, 
with a ratio rate rR(Pt/Pb), rR=0.512 (95%CI = 0.435, 0.603, p<0.0001). These results were 
confirmed by a BOCF analysis. 
•  At the end of the treatment, the distribution of patients with very high cataplexy rate 
(WRC>15) was significantly different between placebo (23.5% [12/51]) and pitolisant (5.6% 
[3/54]) groups, in favour of pitolisant (p<0.0001). 
•  When analysing the effect of the stable dose received of pitolisant, - 20mg (9 patients) and 
40mg (35 patients), a significant decrease on the WRC was observed with both the 20 mg 
(from 8.42 to 3.38) and 40 mg (from 8.46 to 3.57) stable doses - as compared to placebo 
(from 7.09 to 6.28), with a rR for 20 mg dose= 0.392 (95% CI 0.270, 0.571; p<0.0001), and 
rR for 40 mg dose= 0.623 (95% CI 0.510, 0.761, p < 0.0001).  
• 
The CGI-C score regarding cataplexy significantly decreased with pitolisant in comparison with 
placebo (mean reduction -0.95; 95%CI -1.36, -0.54; p<0.0001), as well as the proportion of 
patients responding to treatment (CGI score ≤ 3) which was significantly greater with pitolisant 
(66.7%) than with placebo (33.3%) (OR=4.00; 95%CI 1.54, 10.4; p=0.004). 
The results from this supportive study showed a superior efficacy of pitolisant compared to placebo on 
EDS symptoms assessed with the ESS scores (observed mean changes were -1.9 ± 4.3 and -5.4 ± 4.3 
for placebo and pitolisant groups, respectively). The difference was statistically significant (p<0.001) 
and clinically relevant (the mean decrease in ESS score was above 3 units in pitolisant group).  
This effect on ESS was confirmed by: 
•  MWT results: From baseline geometric means of 4.08 min and 3.58 min at baseline, the 
observed final MWTf values were 4.46 min and 6.69 min for placebo and pitolisant, 
respectively. The geometric mean of the ratios (MWTF/MWTB) for pitolisant compared to 
placebo was 1.8 (95%CI 1.19; 2.71, p=0.005); 
• 
• 
the proportion of responders type 1 (ESSF≤10) and 2 on ESS (ESSF≤10 or ESSF-ESSBL≥3) 
showing OR=3.28 (95%CI = 1.08; 9.92, p=.035) for the first and OR=4.26 (95%CI = 1.72; 
10.5, p= 0.002) for the second responder type (18.0% compared with 39.2% for responders 
type 1 and 34.0% compared with 68.6% for responders type 2 in placebo and pitolisant 
groups, respectively); 
the perceived change on EDS (CGI-C), with a mean reduction of the CGI-C score of pitolisant 
compared with placebo was -0.99 and was statistically significant in favour of pitolisant (mean 
CGI-C score was 3.7±1.4 with placebo versus 2.6±1.1 with pitolisant showing a mean 
reduction of 0.99;; 95%CI -1.45, -0.52; p<0.0001) and patients responders (CGI-C ≤ 3 at V6

[very much, much, or minimally improved]) were 23.5% (12/51) in placebo group compared 
with 68.5% (37/54) in pitolisant group, with an OR=7.07 (95%CI 2.55, 19.6; p=0.0002); 
• 
the aggregated Z-score (combining ESS and MWT), showing a final Z-score of 0.97 (SD=1.35) 
in pitolisant group compared with 0.22 (SD=1.29) in placebo group. 
All these endpoints showed superiority of pitolisant over placebo, and the magnitude of the changes on 
EDS scales was comparable to those observed in Harmony I, a trial on less severely affected patients 
(regarding cataplexy rate, i.e. mean weekly cataplexy rate~3.5) and in which the same maximal 
dosage (40 mg/d) was used. 
The data from this study were considered to support the data from the pivotal studies.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design (randomized, multicentre, double-blind versus placebo and active-control) and the number 
of pivotal studies was considered appropriate for this application in an orphan indication.  
The population chosen in the two pivotal studies was representative of primary narcoleptic population 
with or without cataplexy according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2; 
2005). Included patients were suffering from moderate to severe forms of narcolepsy (according to 
ESS > 14/24, CGI-S on EDS > 5/6 and MSLT < 5.5 min/20 min scores at baseline), and were 
cataplectic in ~80% of the cases. 
The titration scheme adopted by the Applicant was considered acceptable based on tolerance results 
from study P05-03 which showed that adverse events were more frequent during the 3 first days of 
treatment. This finding was also confirmed by the results of the pilot study P06-06 which used the 
escalating dose scheme, later applied in Harmony I and Ibis studies. 
The primary endpoint in the pivotal studies was the comparison of final ESS scores between pitolisant 
and placebo (first step), then if a superiority was approved in the first step, the comparison between 
pitolisant and modafinil was allowed (second step). The use of ESS score (a subjective endpoint) as 
primary endpoint was adequate for the assessment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy and 
it has been often studied and used in earlier clinical trials with other treatments. A minimal clinically 
relevant difference of 3 points on final ESS scores between pitolisant and placebo groups was defined, 
which was appropriate according to results seen with comparators (modafinil and sodium oxybate).  
Since ESS is a subjective endpoint, the Applicant used the MWT (an objective criterion) as secondary 
endpoint in the two pivotal studies, which was suitable. Analysis of responder rate on ESS was 
conducted to further elucidate clinical relevance of the effects observed with pitolisant. 
For the comparison between pitolisant and modafinil, a margin of non-inferiority (MNI) of 2 points was 
selected by the Applicant. This was done to preserve a fraction of the relative efficacy of the control 
active treatment as shown from historical studies. As the point estimate of the mean ESS change for 
modafinil was close to 4 points, a possible value of the MNI was to keep half of this value (MNI=2). 
This was accepted by the CHMP, especially since both tested and reference products demonstrated 
statistically significant advantage over placebo and the observed difference from placebo was clinically 
relevant.

EMA/828546/2015 
Page 65/102 
  
  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
According to the pre-specified minimal clinically relevant difference in both pivotal studies, pitolisant 
showed an improvement on the ESS final score compared to placebo only in Harmony I study (-3.3 
points), but not in Harmony Ibis (-2.19 points, with small centres re-allocation and -1.94 points with 
original centres). The effect of clustering did not improve the modest effect of pitolisant on ESS 
changes (-1.94 versus 2.19) in Harmony Ibis as it was clinically not relevant in both analysis. 
However, the clustering artificially improved the p value, from non-significant (p=0.07) to significant 
(p=0.03).  
The CHMP noted that Harmony Ibis study was most likely underpowered due to improper estimations 
of SD (standard deviation) and R (correlation) values of ESS as well as the number of included patients 
which was lower than the planned one (166 instead of 188). In addition to these two factors, the use 
of the 20 mg/d dose, which seems to be sufficient in only a part of narcoleptic patients (almost 1/3 of 
them according to Harmony I study), could have been responsible for inconsistency in ESS results 
between pivotal studies.  
When MWT results (an objective endpoint) from both studies were considered, they showed that 
pitolisant significantly increased wakefulness maintenance time compared to placebo in Harmony I and 
Harmony Ibis studies (p=0.044 and p=0.009, respectively). In the responder rate analysis in Harmony 
Ibis, up to 66% of pitolisant patients showed an improvement ≥ 3 points of their ESS score from 
baseline.  These results were also confirmed by the pooled analysis on separate endpoints, suggesting 
that pitolisant is effective on the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy with or 
without cataplexy.  
The additional analysis of pivotal trials was accepted by CHMP as an alternative to a three arms dose 
ranging study. The results of pooled analysis of the pivotal trials were not statistically significant for 40 
mg/d dose for ESS and MWT, which could have been related to the sample size after pooling the 
patients to their final dose. The 40mg group was limited to 24 patients, whereas the 20mg sample 
grew up to 75 patients, with consequence on precision of the estimates and a lower power for 
comparing the 40mg group. The overall results showed that in a significant proportion of the patients 
(8/32=25% from Harmony I study), the 20mg dose could be considered as clinically relevant. 
However, dose needed to be increased in some patients confirming the proposed therapy strategy of 
escalating dose, and enabling a patient to benefit from the drug, without reaching the higher dose. 
The overall results from phase 2 studies, pivotal and supportive studies and pooled statistical analysis 
of data, support the recommendation that the dose should be set to the lowest effective dose, 
depending on individual patient response and tolerance according to an up-titration scheme, without 
exceeding the dose of 40 mg per day. This has been reflected in the SmPC.  
The results on cataplexy rates were not consistent between both pivotal studies. Although daily 
cataplexy rate was decreased from baseline to final visit in Harmony I study (from >0.6 crisis at 
baseline to <0.2 crisis in pitolisant group, significantly better than the changes observed in placebo 
group; RR=0.38; 95%IC [0.16; 0.93]; p=0.034), it seemed to have increased in Harmony Ibis study 
(from 0.84 crisis at baseline to 1.69 crisis in pitolisant group, with no statistical difference between 
pitolisant and placebo; p=0.077). However, the results of the supportive double-blind study (Harmony 
CTP) conducted in patients with high frequency of cataplexy where pitolisant was used up to 40mg/d 
were positive and confirmed the effect of pitolisant on cataplexy.  
The non-inferiority of pitolisant compared to modafinil (according to ESS score changes) was rejected 
in both pivotal studies based on a non-inferiority margin of 2 points. To address this issue, the 
Applicant conducted a historical comparison from 6 randomised controlled trials with modafinil to which 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 66/102 
  
  
Harmony I study were added and results from ESS and MWT in modafinil and pitolisant were 
compared. This analysis seems to indicate that pitolisant effect on EDS in narcolepsy, when used up to 
40 mg/day, is of the same size of modafinil. When data from Harmony Ibis were added to this 
analysis, similar trends were observed.  
The effect of pitolisant on quality of life showed a trend (positive difference without statistical 
significance) in favour of pitolisant compared to placebo in both pivotal studies and compared to 
modafinil in the first pivotal study, but in favour of modafinil in the second pivotal study. 
The design of the long-term trial (Harmony III) was suitable to assess the long-term safety of 
pitolisant in narcolepsy but efficacy data from this study could only be considered as supportive, due to 
methodological limitations. Therefore, section 4.2 of the SmPC includes a recommendation that the 
maintenance of effect should be evaluated by the physician on regular basis.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that there is sufficient evidence supporting pitolisant efficacy in treatment of 
narcolepsy with or without cataplexy in adults 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Clinical safety assessment has been mainly based on the pooled data generated from narcolepsy 
studies, including 2 phase III studies that compared pitolisant to placebo and modafinil. Additional data 
from clinical trials in other indications (EDS associated with Parkinson disease, EDS secondary to OSA, 
epilepsy, schizophrenia, dementia and ADHD) were also submitted and evaluated. 
Patient exposure 
The clinical development program included a total of 1837 subjects. Out of these, 1385 were exposed 
to pitolisant (291 healthy volunteers, 1094 patients including 342 patients in the treatment of 
narcolepsy and 752 in other indications); 98 patients received modafinil as control drug and 354 
received placebo.  
Taking into account all available data in September 2015, including currently ongoing trials and 
compassionate use program, 2015 subjects have been exposed to pitolisant.

33.1% of all patients treated with pitolisant were female and 66.9% male. This sex ratio was more 
balanced when only narcolepsy studies were taken into account. In this indication males represented 
54.1 % of treated patients, which is representative of sex distribution in narcolepsy. 
Out of 1094 patients treated by pitolisant, 781 were aged 18 to 65 years and 313 were aged over 65 
years  (234  subjects  over  65  years  and  77  subjects  over  74  years).  The  median  age  was  58  years  in 
the overall population and 36.5 years in the narcolepsy studies.

The median duration of exposure to pitolisant was 84.5 days in the overall population and 64 days in 
narcolepsy studies (range 3 to 834 days). Cumulative duration of exposure to pitolisant was 1 year and 
above in 219 patients, between 6 months to 1 year in 150 and less than 6 months in 725 subjects 
(358 patients treated 1 month or less).   
Data on long-term exposure (up to 12 months) in narcoleptic patients was available from non-pivotal 
study P09-10 (Harmony III). 104 patients were included and 102 took at least one dose of study 
treatment. 68 patients completed the first 12-month treatment period and 34 withdrew from the study 
prematurely.  
In most studies, pitolisant was initially administered using an individual dosage titration scheme over 
three to four weeks. The most frequently received maximal daily dose was 20 mg (48.4% of total 
exposed patients) followed by 40 mg (34.8%) and 10 mg (11.3%). In narcolepsy studies, most of 
patients received a maximal daily dose of 40 mg (218 out of 342) whereas those receiving 20 mg 
mainly took part in non-narcolepsy trials (433 out of 529 vs 96 out of 342 in narcolepsy studies).

Regarding long-term exposure, 108 patients were treated from 6 months to 1 year at 20mg and 35 
patients at 40mg; 164 patients were treated one year and above at 20mg, and 48 at 40mg. 
Adverse events 
In studies conducted in narcolepsy, the percentage of patients treated with pitolisant (52.3%) who 
reported at least one adverse event was slightly higher compared to placebo (41.1%), and similar 
compared to modafinil (55.1%).  
In studies conducted in other indications, the percentage of patients presenting with at least one AE 
was higher compared to the narcoleptic population (68.6% vs. 52.3%), and this applied also for the 
placebo treated population (45.7% vs. 41.1%). This might be explained by the overall longer duration 
of studies and older patients population with various concomitant and often severe diseases (e.g. 
Parkinson, OSA). 
When considering all studies pooled, headache (11.4%) and insomnia (9.0%) were the most frequently 
reported events in patients treated with pitolisant, or placebo (7.6% and 2.9%, respectively). Gastro-
intestinal AEs, in particular nausea, were also frequently observed with pitolisant but to a lesser 
extent.  
A similar safety profile was observed when considering only pooled data from narcolepsy studies. 
However the percentage of patients who reported weight increase (2.9%), anxiety (3.5%), vomiting 
(2.3%), diarrhea (2.0%) and irritability (3.2%) were slightly more pronounced than when considering 
pooled data from all indications. Psychiatric disorders (21.9%) were reported more frequently with 
pitolisant, compared to placebo (8.9%) and modafinil (13.3%). As expected, gastro-intestinal

disorders were also more frequently reported with pitolisant (16.1%) than with placebo (8.2%). 
Inversely, nervous system disorders were slightly less reported with pitolisant (22.8% vs 23.5%

Numbers of reported AEs according to pitolisant daily dose support a dose-dependence in all 
narcolepsy studies pooled (20.3% at 10mg; 32.5% at 20mg; 36.4% at 40mg). Most common AEs 
appeared to be more frequently reported with the higher pitolisant daily dose (40 mg). Other possible 
dose-relation was observed in overall pooled studies for 20mg and 40mg for headache, insomnia, 
nausea, anxiety, irritability, abdominal pain upper and weight increased. However, no clear dose-
relation was observed for 10 mg and 20 mg for majority of reported AEs, in particular for GI disorders.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In narcolepsy studies, 17 serious AEs were reported by 13 patients. All were considered by 
investigators as unrelated to studied treatment except for a case of miscarriage where causality was 
noted as possible. No deaths were reported. 
In other pitolisant studies, 68 serious AEs (including 3 cases of death unrelated to the study drug) 
were reported in 56 patients. For 4 cases (psychosis, one case of syncope, one case of anxiety, one 
case of weight decreased) causality was assessed as possible, 3 cases (abdominal pain, one case of 
constipation and one case of general physical condition abnormal) as not very likely and one case of 
syncope noted as unlikely.  
Other significant AEs 
• 
Neuropsychiatric AEs 
The most frequent reported neuropsychiatric AEs were headache, insomnia, depression, irritability, 
anxiety, dizziness, vertigo and malaise.  
o 
Depression 
When considering the pooled safety database (all indications), 41 events of depression were reported 
(4 with placebo, 1 with modafinil, 36 with pitolisant). Most of these events came from Parkinson 
studies (29 out of 41).  
Depression was reported by 2.3% (n=8) of patients treated by pitolisant for narcolepsy, which is 
higher than observed for modafinil (1.0%; n=1) or placebo (0.8% all indications; 0% narcolepsy). In 
Harmony III study, in five cases a causal relationship with pitolisant cannot be totally excluded. In 
addition to data from pooled studies, article by Leu et al; 2014, described 2 patients in French ATU 
procedure with emerging depressive ideation under pitolisant: one with suicidal ideation after one 
week with 5mg/day and another with onset of sadness, low self-esteem and pessimism after 18 
months with 40mg/day. Symptoms stopped one to two weeks after pitolisant was withdrawn.  
o 
Anxiety/irritability 
Compared to placebo, a higher proportion of patients treated with pitolisant experienced irritability 
(0.6% vs 3.2% in narcolepsy studies) and anxiety (0% vs 3.5% in narcolepsy studies). Both adverse 
events seemed to be dose dependent (0.8% at 20 mg and 2.4% at 40 mg for irritability in all 
indications studies; 1.3% at 20mg and 2.9% at 40mg for anxiety in all indications studies).  
o 
Headache/insomnia 
In the clinical program, headache (11.4% vs 7.6% placebo) and insomnia 9.0% (versus 2.9% placebo) 
were the most frequently reported AEs with pitolisant. These AEs were mainly mild to moderate in 
severity (81% and 90% respectively), and appear to be likely dose-dependent. Improvement occurred 
in majority of cases after dose reduction. Most of them resulted in a favourable outcome without 
sequelae (headache 93% and insomnia 72%).  
• 
Gastrointestinal AEs 
Pitolisant induces histamine release onto central vomiting center, and induces an increase of stomach 
acidity that may explain the number of TEAEs reported within the SOC “gastrointestinal disorders” 
during clinical studies (18.6% vs 10.7% for placebo). In clinical trials (all indications) in addition to 
nausea (6.6% of all pitolisant-treated patients), vomiting (1.9% of all pitolisant-treated patients) and 
diarrhoea (1.6% of all pitolisant-treated patients), gastric disorders caused by hyperacidity adverse 
effects included mainly dyspepsia (1.4% of patients in all indications), gastro-oesophageal reflux 
disease (1.2% of narcoleptic patients) and abdominal pain upper (1.2% of all pitolisant-treated 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 74/102 
  
  
patients) and in lesser extent (less than 1% of all pitolisant-treated patients), hyperacidity, 
oesophageal burn, stomach discomfort, and abdominal discomfort. These effects were mostly mild to 
moderate in intensity, and none were serious. Two were severe but the patients fully recovered. 
• 
Cardiovascular AEs 
Among all pitolisant-treated patients, cardiac disorders were representing 2.1% versus 1.7% for 
pitolisant and placebo groups respectively. Hypertension was reported in 15 patients (1.4%), including 
one serious case in Parkinson P06-10 study. It was considered unrelated as the AE occurred 3 days 
after last drug intake. 
All 8 serious cardiovascular events were reported in Parkinson studies (P06-10, P06-11 and P07-02) 
and were considered unlikely or unrelated, except for one case of lypothymia malaise that occurred 
after an effort.  
In Harmony III (P09-10) 10.8% of patients (n=11) had ongoing cardiovascular disease (hypertension, 
right branch block, mitral valve prolapsus, cardiac rhythmic disorders) at study inclusion. Analysis of 
data in this sub-group of 11 patients does not identify specific safety signal, even though in the case of 
mild sinus bradycardia causality of pitolisant cannot be totally excluded. 
• 
Effects on weight and appetite 
No clear pattern on weight effect could be determined from available clinical data, as weight increase 
(2.9% in narcolepsy studies vs 1.3% placebo vs 0% modafinil), but also to a lesser extent weight 
decrease, have been observed in patients treated with pitolisant in clinical studies. Increased appetite 
was also reported in some patients but was not always associated with weight increase and or 
inversely. A dose-dependence for weight increase seemed to be observed in all pooled studies (1.86% 
at 40mg vs 0.54% at 20mg vs 0.13% at 10mg). 
In study Harmony I, weight changes between last visit under allocated treatment and baseline did not 
differ statistically between groups. An incremental moderate increase in mean weight (kg) was 
observed between baseline V3 and end of treatment V7 in all groups, +3.7kg, +1.6kg and +0.2kg in 
placebo, pitolisant and modafinil groups respectively.

Data from phase II study P06-06 are rather in favour of a weight increase after continuous exposure 
as during all three phases of this study a statistically significant weight increase was identified (+0.9kg 
at the end of the initial 1 month treatment, p-value = 0.094; +1.4kg at the end of 3-month extension 
phase, p-value = 0.080; +3.7kg at the end of 9-month extension phase, p-value = 0.025). In 
addition, in long-term P09-10 study, a weight increase considered possibly or likely related to the 
study drug, except for one, was reported in 5.9% of patients.

Withdrawal symptoms 
The occurrence of an amphetamine-like withdrawal syndrome during the 1-week wash-out period 
following abrupt discontinuation of treatment, was assessed through an amphetamine-like withdrawal 
questionnaire which stated the presence of a series of symptoms according to DSM4 i.e. dysphoria 
accompanied by at least 3 symptoms among: fatigue, insomnia, psychomotor agitation, increase 
appetite and vivid unpleasant dreams. 
This questionnaire was used in 4 Phase III narcolepsy studies [P07-03 (HARMONY I), P09-15 
(HARMONY Ibis), P10-01 (HARMONY IV), P11-05 (HARMONY CTP)] to investigate the withdrawal 
symptoms in patients treated with pitolisant, defined according to the DSM-IV.  
In these 4 narcoleptic studies: 1 patient (0.6%) in pitolisant group (add-on sodium oxybate), 2 
patients (1.5%) in placebo group and 4 patients (4.1%) in modafinil group reported amphetamine-like 
withdrawal syndrome. Because of one patient treated with pitolisant reporting amphetamine-like 
withdrawal symptoms, and because long term treatment did not include sufficient number of patients, 
withdrawal symptoms could not be excluded. 
An amphetamine-like withdrawal symptoms questionnaire was also used in Parkinson studies (P06-10, 
P06-11). In both studies none of the patients treated with pitolisant presented an amphetamine-like 
withdrawal syndrome since none of them displayed dysphoria.  
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory parameters’ abnormalities observed through the clinical program did not raise any 
particular safety signal.  
No evidence of signal with regards to lipids abnormalities could be raised from available data, 
nevertheless it should be noted that TG and total cholesterol measurements were made only in studies 
P04-07 (epilepsy), P09-16 (OSA), and P09-15 (narcolepsy). These measurements in all studies would 
have been particularly justified as being overweight is a frequent co-morbidity in narcoleptic patients, 
and could be associated with dyslipidemia. 
In study Harmony I (P07-03) there was a higher proportion of patients in the pitolisant group with 
abnormal levels of eosinophils compared to placebo and modafinil groups, at V1 (respectively 16.1% 
vs 6.7% and 6.1%, p-value=0.454) and at V7 (respectively 16.1% vs 6.7% and 0%, p-value=0.027). 
The four cases with abnormal levels of eosinophils under pitolisant treatment were described as 
hypoeosinophilia. This was not associated with any specific adverse events. 
No clinically relevant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, or in heart rate, have been 
detected in narcolepsy studies. A total of ECG 8289 recordings were assessed from the studies in all 
indications. The longest QTcF value from any Phase III study was 462 msec. There was no QTcF 
greater than 500 msec after manual adjudication and the largest change from baseline in the QTcF 
interval was 50 msec. Thus, no signal on QT prolongation was identified based on ECGs performed 
during the clinical development program. 
Safety in special populations 
The safety analysis in specific subgroups including elderly, or patients with renal impairment or hepatic 
impairment, did not reveal any relevant specific safety concerns with pitolisant, except for the 
frequency of insomnia that was slightly higher for elderly. 
An analysis of most common AEs according to age groups could not be performed in narcolepsy studies 
as only 8 patients were older than 65 years. When considering OSA, Parkinson and Dementia 
populations treated with pitolisant, no significant difference between age groups emerged except for a 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 76/102 
  
  
slightly higher number of reported insomnia noticed in patients aged over 75 years (8.8% vs 5.7% for 
66-75 years group, vs 5.6% for 18-65 years group) which is expected for this age group. 
The main exclusion criteria across the clinical trial development program included paediatric 
population, pregnant and/or breast feeding women, population with severe renal or hepatic impairment 
or with any other significant abnormality in the physical examination or clinical laboratory results, 
Thus, these populations were considered as “missing information” in the RMP and will be closely 
monitored. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The review of the frequency of events reported in the different subgroups of patients with concomitant 
treatments in long-term study Harmony III P09-10 did not show any difference in the pitolisant safety 
profile as compared with the overall study population, with the exception of a greater frequency of 
insomnia in the subgroup of patients taking concomitant modafinil. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In narcolepsy studies, the discontinuation rate due to AE occurrence was similar for pitolisant treated 
patients (5%), and modafinil treated patients (5.1%) and lower in the placebo arm (3.2%). The rate of 
discontinuation due to AE was higher in non-narcoleptic populations (12% and 4.9% in pitolisant and 
placebo treated patients respectively).  
Insomnia, headache, nausea, anxiety, vertigo and depression were the most frequent adverse events 
causing pitolisant discontinuation.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Pitolisant is the first inverse agonist/antagonist H3R to be introduced in clinics, thus its safety profile 
could not be directly compared with drugs from similar pharmacologic class. The safety data seem 
exhaustive as they were collected from subjects who participated in all pitolisant clinical studies.  
Even if all treated populations have been taken into consideration for the analysis of the safety profile 
of pitolisant, it could be expected to be different in narcoleptic and non-narcoleptic patients, in relation 
with the background disease. Therefore, clinical safety assessment for this application was mainly 
based on pooled data generated from clinical trials in narcolepsy. The number of patients receiving 
pitolisant in this indication was low, but acceptable considering that narcolepsy is an orphan disorder 
(0.026% of the general population). 
The number of patients treated for narcolepsy long-term appears limited, in particular in study P09-10 
(Harmony III) where only 10 patients received a 20 mg daily dose and 87 received the 40 mg daily 
dose. Data from this 12 months study showed an occurrence of TEAEs/ADRs mainly within the first 6 
months. There was a small increase in the proportion of patients reporting in the period 1-3 months as 
opposed to up to 1 month, both for TEAE or for ADR. It was difficult to analyse the type of adverse 
events with delayed reporting (i.e. after a month of treatment) although it might have been linked to 
“headache” and “anxiety”. These adverse events seem to subside in the periods 6-9 months and 9-12 
months. More importantly, no such temporal effect could be seen for severe and serious AE and it 
seemed to be related to treatment with the lower dose of 20 mg. Although these data are reassuring, 
it does not detract from the fact that the safety database for pitolisant is limited. The number of 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 77/102 
  
  
patients treated for one year or more at the recommended dose is limited which has consequences for 
the evaluation of the safety as the numbers reported in this response are equally low in each time 
subgroup. Therefore, definite conclusion cannot be drawn on pitolisant long-term safety and it was 
noted as missing information in the RMP. In the opinion of CHMP, the impact of uncertainties regarding 
long-term safety profile in the overall benefit-risk balance of pitolisant justifies a PASS that should be 
an obligation for marketing authorisation and adequately designed to further characterize pitolisant in 
real conditions of use. 
Headache and insomnia constituted a frequent cause of permanent or temporary treatment 
interruption. Headache, that was reported with a similar frequency in pitolisant and placebo treated 
patients, does not constitute an important safety concern and is identified as a common associated 
symptom of narcolepsy [Billiard 2006]. A statement in the SmPC that a reduced daily dose or 
discontinuation should be considered if symptoms persist has been introduced.   
Insomnia is a potential side-effect for any psychostimulant drug with a long half-life. Considering 
pitolisant half-life of 8-11 hours, this adverse effect is expected. In controlled clinical trials no patient 
developed insomnia with modafinil (0%) compared to 6 with pitolisant (6.6%). This is unexpected as in 
these studies pitolisant appeared to be less effective than modafinil on vigilance, particularly in study 
Harmony Ibis. The frequency of insomnia was slightly higher in elderly which is expected in this sub-
population. 
The difference between modafinil and pitolisant, apart from the distinct mechanisms of action, may 
rely upon the shorter half-life of modafinil which results in twice daily administration. Pitolisant can be 
administered once per day, which could be a positive factor for compliance. Pitolisant-related 
insomnias are presumably related to its potent activation of wake promoting neurons. Nevertheless, 
insomnia is adequately considered as an important identified risk in the RMP and its preventability is 
based on dosage reduction, as stated in the SmPC.  
The possible effects of pitolisant on weight and appetite are unclear. Weight increase did not appear to 
be systematically associated in clinical trials with appetite increase. However, there seemed to be a 
dose relationship for weight increase with a reporting of 0.13% for the 10mg dose, 0.54% with the 
20mg and 1.86% with the 40mg dose. A possible dose effect is also suggested by data related to 
TEAEs by SOC in narcoleptic patients, with 7 weight increased with pitolisant 40mg vs 3 cases with 
pitolisant 20mg.  
It was seen mainly in the first three months of treatment and seemed to stabilize thereafter. Although 
the changes were seen mainly in women and early after the start of treatment, the weight increase 
was seen over a longer time period in men. No particular concern has been raised in the obese 
patients. 
The weight increased in patients with an increase of 5% body weight and above was 7.6 % +/- 2.7% 
but no clear effect on body weight could be seen, which was made more difficult by the low numbers in 
the database and the maximum of 52 weeks treatment duration. 
When considering long-term study Harmony III, the mean body weight from all narcoleptic patients 
remained stable during the pitolisant treatment period. In this study, the Applicant identified 
seventeen patients with medical history associated with risk factors. Most frequent medical risk factors 
included depression or anxiety (9/17), however no conclusion could be drawn as these risk factors 
were associated with either increase of decrease in body weight.  
In addition to pooled data from submitted clinical trials, according to publication from Leu et al, 2014, 
14% of 78 narcoleptic patients treated by pitolisant in French ATU program experienced increased 
appetite and weight gain. The observed weight gain was progressive over time and ranged from 2 to 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 78/102 
  
  
15kg after 2 years of treatment. However, all patients with weight gain had been previously treated by 
methylphenidate, mazindol or D-amphetamine and have reported anorexia under these treatments.  
As tendency for increased weight is intrinsic to narcolepsy, causal relationship with pitolisant is difficult 
to establish. However, despite no clear patterns shown in clinical trials, weight increase was a detected 
AE and has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. In addition, the CHMP recommended including a 
warning in section 4.4 for treatment of patients with severe obesity or severe anorexia and need for 
re-evaluation in case of significant weight changes.  
Uncertainty remains on the risk of depression/anxiety under pitolisant treatment as psychiatric AEs 
represent frequent comorbidities in narcolepsy that make analysis of causal relationship difficult. 
Narcolepsy is associated with a high prevalence of self-reported depressive symptoms [Mosko, 1989]. 
The prevalence of moderate to severe depression or anxiety ranged from 15% to 37% in the 
narcoleptic population [Vandeputte, 2003].  
Anxiety, a possible depressive symptom, has been reported in some patients with depression and is 
considered as an important identified risk in the proposed RMP. Consequently, anxiety has been 
included as an important identified risk in the RMP. The SmPC states that a reduced daily dose or 
discontinuation should be considered if symptoms persist. 
The Applicant has paid a special attention to detect potential impact on depression, and used the Beck 
Depression Inventory instrument (BDI) to assess patients’ mood in majority of studies. No significant 
changes in BDI scores were detected in pitolisant-treated patients. However, bearing in mind the 
neurochemical action of pitolisant, equal attention should also be paid on the risk of switch in mood 
polarity in patients with bipolar affective disorder. Uncertainties remain also on a potential anxiety or 
depression aggravation in population with severe anxiety, severe depression (BDI ≥ 16) with suicidal 
risk (item G BDI > 0) excluded from the clinical trial program, and which will be potentially treated by 
pitolisant in real conditions of use.   
In addition, pitolisant appears to be a sigma-1 agonist. Therefore, an antidepressant activity is 
theoretically plausible in humans. However, based on clinical data, a relationship between treatment 
with pitolisant and depressive symptoms cannot be excluded, therefore the risk of depression has been 
considered as an important identified risk in the RMP and will be further characterized through the 
PASS by regular evaluation of BDI score during medical visit. Section 4.4 of the SPC was also amended 
to recommend administering Wakix with caution in patients with history of psychiatric disorders such 
as severe anxiety or severe depression with suicidal risk ideation.   
Consideration should be made on the concomitant exposure of pitolisant and antidepressants. 
Antidepressants used for cataplexy (e.g. SSRIs), and anxiolytic drugs are frequently prescribed in 
narcoleptic patients. In Harmony III study, 14% of patients were treated for depression or anxiety 
(3.9% of patients took SSRIs and 3.9% took venlafaxine). According to publication by Leu et al, 2014 
concomitant use of antidepressant was observed in 24 % patients with individual ATU procedure. Thus, 
a probable frequent concomitant exposure to antidepressants and pitolisant is expected in real 
conditions of use. 
SSRIs are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, pitolisant is a substrate and a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. The 
inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine could lead to 2-fold increase of pitolisant exposure. Given the 
safety profile of pitolisant from phase II and III trials, it can be concluded that co-administration of 
pitolisant with inhibitors of CYP2D6 should be done with caution.  
Dizziness, vertigo and malaise were reported slightly more frequently with pitolisant than with placebo 
but were not serious. In the narcoleptic patients starting the treatment at the dose of 40mg in study 
P05-03, two malaises were severe but recovered. The potential public health impact could be 
considered to be low since it is recommended to start the treatment progressively. Patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 79/102 
  
  
abnormal levels of sleepiness who take pitolisant should be advised that their level of wakefulness may 
not return to normal. Patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, including those taking pitolisant 
should be frequently reassessed for their degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, advised to avoid 
driving or any other potentially dangerous activity. 
The adverse event of “fall” was reported more often in studies in non-narcoleptic patients. Data has 
been provided regarding specific adverse events occurring in patients 65 years of age and older. 
However this data was difficult to interpret as comparison to the placebo or modafinil group has not 
been discussed.  
As there are very few data on pregnancy (4 cases with a known outcome) and the lack of breast 
feeding data, no clinical conclusion can be drawn regarding pregnancy and lactation. However, based 
on the reprotoxicity results (concerning fertility, abortions, pre and post-natal losses, malformations, 
agalactorrhea, delay in development, etc.) observed in non-clinical studies at maternotoxic doses but 
with low or no margin of safety (at the NOAEL), the CHMP has introduced a number of precautionary 
measures.  
Pitolisant is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
effective contraception in accordance with the Guideline on risk assessment of medicinal products on 
human reproduction and lactation: from data to labelling  (EMEA/CHMP/203927/2005). Moreover, as 
pitolisant/metabolites could reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, the CHMP proposed 
to advise an alternative method of contraception and to upgrade the level of recommendation to avoid 
pregnancy during treatment with pitolisant.  
A duration of contraception measures after treatment discontinuation has been added in section 4.6 of 
the SmPC, based on the worst case scenario;  taking into account 7 times the highest elimination half-
life (t½) of pitolisant, ie 7*24h (= 7 days). Nevertheless, because uncertainties remain regarding the 
PK of metabolites of pitolisant an additional washout period should be considered and the Applicant has 
been asked to commit to update this duration when the results of the post-approval PK investigations 
are available.  
The CHMP also recommended that as pitolisant and its metabolites are excreted in milk, it should be 
contra-indicated during breast-feeding. “Fertility disorders” and “Exposure during pregnancy and/or 
lactation” have been classified as “important potential risk” in the RMP and will be closely monitored 
post approval.  
In addition to their presence in cerebral neurons supporting effect on vigilance, H3-receptors are found 
in non-histaminergic neurons in brain as well as in lungs and in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Consequently, in addition to psychiatric and neurologic AEs, special attention has been paid to 
potential pulmonary and GI AEs. Based on non-clinical results, pro-convulsive potential, cardiac toxicity 
(QT prolongation) and dependence potential were also considered particularly pertinent to analyze in 
the clinical safety assessment.  
The effects of pitolisant on the gastric ulcer formation were investigated in the rat and did not show 
any effect. No ulcer lesions were reported as TEAEs. However, such events were not specifically 
searched for as no systemic endoscopy was performed during the clinical development. In addition, 
long-term data are insufficient to conclude on the absence of this risk after prolonged pitolisant 
exposure. Thus, uncertainties remain regarding gastric ulcer formation after pitolisant long-term 
exposure. The CHMP requested that this issue should be further characterized through the PASS. 
Gastric disorders caused by hyperacidity have been considered an important identified risk in the RMP. 
With regards to this risk preventability, SPC section 4.4. and 4.8 state that a corrective treatment with 
H2-receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor could be initiated if these effects persist, and that 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 80/102 
  
  
pitolisant should be administered with caution in patients with acid related gastric disorders or when 
co-administered with gastric irritants such as corticosteroids or NSAID.  
Special consideration for pulmonary and respiratory events has been made as histamine H3R receptors 
are also expressed in the lungs. Their stimulation might inhibit pulmonary neurogenetic and 
inflammatory process. Among all pitolisant-treated patients, pulmonary and respiratory events were 
not reported as representing 1% or more of all events. All serious respiratory events reported with 
pitolisant occurred in Parkinson patients. Thus, available data from clinical studies are rather 
reassuring with regards to a potential effect of pitolisant on lung. 
In narcolepsy clinical trials, no AEs of convulsions or seizures were reported. In epilepsy P04-07 clinical 
trial conducted in 22 patients, one patient prematurely discontinued pitolisant treatment because of a 
moderate and intermittent increase and modification of seizures. Although the investigator felt this 
event was doubtfully related to study drug, (as such events are frequent in pharmacoresistant 
epilepsy), a causal relationship for pitolisant cannot be totally excluded.  
A pro-convulsive potential was observed in safety pharmacology studies conducted in mice as well as 
in toxicity studies performed in mice, rats and monkeys (see Non-clinical section), thereby supporting 
the inclusion of a warning in the SmPC section 4.4 regarding administration of pitolisant to epileptic 
patients. 
In vitro studies showed that pitolisant might exert inhibitory effects on potassium channel and calcium 
channel (HERG currents) at high concentrations. The safety margins are however high enough to 
consider a limited QT prolongation potential in humans at therapeutic doses. ICH E14 TQT study in 
healthy volunteers, where moderate QT/QTc were observed, supported an effect on the QT at supra-
therapeutic doses (120mg). Effects of pitolisant on QTcF interval at supra-therapeutic doses are 
confirmed by results from the Phase I study additionally submitted by the Applicant. In this study (ICH 
E14 analysis), following pitolisant doses of 160 mg, 200 mg and 240 mg, the ΔΔQTcF was >5 ms at 
the three 3 doses, with a 95% upper bound of the predicted effect above 10 ms (11.9, 13.3 and 9.9 
ms respectively), that is comparable and even higher than for the positive control moxifloxacin (10.7 
ms).  
In Phase III pivotal studies no specific cardiac safety signal was identified, in particular with regards to 
QT prolongation based on ECG performed during the studies. However, the CHMP noted that exclusion 
criteria included patients with unstable cardiovascular illness, patients with a known history of long QTc 
syndrome or presenting any significant serious abnormality of the ECG or QTc interval strictly higher 
than 450ms. These populations excluded in clinical trials are not contra-indicated for pitolisant use in 
the SmPC and will be potentially exposed to pitolisant in real conditions of use. 
Thus, based on available pre-clinical and clinical data, potential for QT interval prolongation has been 
considered as an important potential risk in the RMP. The SmPC section 4.4 has been updated to 
minimize this risk to patients with cardiac disease, co-medicated with other QT-prolonging drugs or 
known to be at risk of repolarization disorders. Patients should be also monitored in clinical situations 
which could result in pitolisant reaching supra-therapeutic doses, e.g. patients co-medicated with 
drugs that significantly increase pitolisant Cmax and AUC ratio or patients with severe renal or 
moderate hepatic impairment. 
With regards to abuse and dependence potential of pitolisant, although self-administration study in 
monkeys suggested that pitolisant has reinforcing properties, no abuse study was performed according 
to the Guidance for Industry “Assessment of abuse potential of drugs” (January 2010). No significant 
effect was seen on cognition following treatment with pitolisant for up to 9 months and no significant 
difference was seen with patients receiving modafinil. As no data is available over a longer period, 
uncertainty remains on long-term procognitive effect. Given pitolisant’s pharmacological properties 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 81/102 
  
  
(CNS stimulant, increasing dopamine release in prefrontal cortex) and capacities to increase memory 
performance and the duration of acquisition of animals, abuse and dependence liability could not be 
excluded. Consequently, “Drug abuse and misuse” and “Drug dependence” were included as important 
potential risks in the RMP. It is recommended that pitolisant should be administered by a physician 
experienced in the treatment of sleep disorders but currently available data do not warrant a need for 
special medical prescription.  
In addition, despite the lack of signal in 4 narcolepsy clinical trials (Harmony I, Ibis, IV and CTP), 
where amphetamine-like withdrawal syndrome was investigated through questionnaires, the risk of 
withdrawal syndrome cannot be excluded as withdrawal symptoms not associated with dysphoria were 
observed in Parkinson studies and as one withdrawal syndrome was observed in narcoleptic study in 
add-on to sodium oxybate (Harmony IV). 
The review of the frequency or events reported in the different subgroups of patients with concomitant 
treatments in long-term study Harmony III P09-10 did not show any difference in the pitolisant safety 
profile as compared with the overall study population, with the exception of a greater frequency of 
insomnia in the subgroup of patients taking concomitant modafinil. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of pitolisant is consistent with its mechanism of action and is considered acceptable 
in the treatment of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. No major safety concern was identified in the 
clinical trials and adverse events can be often managed by individual dose adaptation.  
As narcolepsy is an orphan disease, the clinical studies included a small number of patients. 
Consequently, their ability to detect rare adverse reactions, or to detect adverse reactions due to 
prolonged exposure was low. Some uncertainties remain with regards to pitolisant’s effects on 
depression, weight and appetite, ulcer formation, and more generally on adverse events that might 
occur after long-term exposure. These considerations justify a long-term safety study in narcoleptic 
patients for the recommended 20 and 40mg doses. Therefore, the CHMP considers the following 
measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
The Applicant will conduct a Post-Authorisation Safety Study in order to further investigate the long 
term safety of Wakix in the treatment of narcolepsy in adult patients. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found unacceptable by the QRD Group. 
The majority of the Member States affected by the proposal for English only labelling (outer carton and 
bottle labels) were of the opinion that first option should be the creation of multilingual packs; an 
attempt should be made to accommodate as many languages as feasible from a readability point of 
view. 
Certain countries would already accept English only labelling, therefore, there was still the option for 
the applicant to contact Member States individually in line with art. 63.3 to request a translation 
exemption on the basis of severe problems of availability.

2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Wakix (pitolisant) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The efficacy on excessive daytime sleepiness was measured on subjective (ESS) and objective (MWT) 
endpoints. The statistically significant improvement on ESS was shown against placebo in Harmony I 
study (-3.0 points; 95%IC [-5.6; -0.4]; p=0.024) and in Harmony CTP (3.41 [-4.95; -1.87]; 
p<0.0001).  The effect was also shown on MWT in Harmony I, Ibis and CTP. In Harmony I, no 
significant difference in comparison to modafinil (first line treatment in narcolepsy) was observed.  
The responder rate on ESS was also used as secondary endpoint. For both responders definitions 
(DEF1 = normalisation of the symptom; DEF2 = normalisation or clinically significant improvement) 
pitolisant showed significant results in both pivotal studies and in the supportive CTP study.  
The effect on cataplexy was observed in the first pivotal study (Harmony I) and the supportive study 
(Harmony CTP) conducted in patients with high cataplexy frequency. The daily cataplexy rate in 
Harmony I improved against placebo with a rate ratio rR=0.38 whilst in the Harmony CTP the ratio of 
improvement on weekly cataplexy rate against placebo was 0.512.  
The results of quality-of-life measurements showed an improvement in patients treated by pitolisant 
compared to placebo group, even though the difference was not statistically significant. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Results of primary endpoints analysis in the Harmony Ibis study were not statistically significant. In 
this study, pitolisant was also significantly inferior on ESS final score when compared to modafinil in 
post-hoc sensitivity analysis. The upper dose of 20 mg/d of pitolisant used in this study, even though 
efficacious in almost 1/3 of patients in Harmony I, seems to have been insufficient in the remaining 
patients. This conclusion was supported by the results from cataplexy rate analysis:  pitolisant at 20 
mg/d did not show positive effect compared to placebo, which was not consistent with the results on 
cataplexy from Harmony I.  
However, the results of the supportive Harmony CTP study provided supportive evidence as to 
pitolisant’s efficacy, especially with regards to the effect on cataplexy. Accordingly, they were included 
in SmPC section 5.1.  
The 8-week duration of the pivotal trials was considered sufficient to demonstrate efficacy. Long-term 
efficacy data were collected from an extension open-label study and compassionate use program and 
suggest the maintenance of effect. However, no formal withdrawal or controlled long term efficacy 
study was performed. The information regarding maintenance of effect has been included in section 
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 96/102 
  
  
 
5.1 of the SmPC and the physicians have been advised that the continued efficacy of treatment should 
be regularly evaluated. 
No evidence on the effect of pitolisant on disease course is available. Pitolisant does not reverse the 
loss of orexin neurones, but instead acts by circumventing this and activating the neurones 
downstream from the damaged ones. In that respect, the treatment is purely symptomatic.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
No major safety concern was identified in clinical trials conducted in heterogeneous adult populations 
(291 healthy volunteers, 1094 patients including 342 patients in the treatment of narcolepsy and 752 
in other indications). Cumulative duration of exposure to pitolisant was 1 year and above in 219 
patients, between 6 months to 1 year in 150 and less than 6 months in 725 subjects (335 patients 
treated 1 month or less). 
Pitolisant was associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events, which was expected as the histamine 
H3R receptors are almost exclusively expressed in the central nervous system. The most frequently 
reported neuropsychiatric AEs were headache (8%), insomnia (6%), depression (2%), anxiety 
(1.57%), dizziness (1.6%), irritability (1%), vertigo (1%) and malaise (0.5%). Gastro-intestinal AEs, 
in particular nausea (4%), vomiting (1%) and diarrhoea (1%) were also frequently observed. 
There was apparently a dose-dependent relationship between the daily dose used of pitolisant and the 
incidence of overall AEs (10.4% at 5 mg/d; 20.6% at 10 mg/d; 32.9% at 20 mg/d; 36.1% at 40 
mg/d). Therefore, the titration of the dose is recommended when initiating the treatment with 
pitolisant and the dose can be decreased if needed, depending on individual patient’s response.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Pitolisant acts as an agonist to sigma-1 and antagonist to sigma-2 with very low Ki. Therefore, an 
effect on depression and abuse potential is theoretically plausible in humans. These risks could not be 
excluded by currently available non-clinical and clinical data. Consequently, relevant information and 
warnings have been included in the SmPC. It has been also stated that pitolisant should be prescribed 
by a physician experienced in the treatment of sleep disorders.  
Based on non-clinical and clinical pharmacology results, fertility disorders, exposure during pregnancy 
and/or lactation, pro-convulsive potential and cardiac toxicity (QT prolongation) were considered as 
potential risks and will be closely monitored post-approval via routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
Appropriate warnings have been included in the SmPC.  
There are still some gaps in the understanding of the pharmacokinetics of the drug. Therefore, the 
Applicant has been requested to conduct as post-approval measures a number of PK studies in order to 
further elucidate the contribution of different enzyme pathways to pitolisant’s metabolism and 
characterise the risk of drug-drug interactions.  
No clear pattern on weight change could be determined from available clinical data, as weight increase 
(2.7% in narcolepsy studies), but also to a lesser extent weight decrease, have been observed in 
patients treated with pitolisant. The excess body mass index and obesity are co-morbidities frequently 
encountered in narcolepsy. However, the potential effect of pitolisant on weight and appetite is 
unclear. A warning has been included in section 4.4 and in case of significant weight change treatment 
should be re-evaluated by the physician.  
Assessment report  
EMA/828546/2015 
Page 97/102 
  
  
 
Uncertainties remain on long-term effects, in particular on cognition, depression and ulcer formation. 
Given the relatively low number of patients exposed to pitolisant longer than 6 months, long term 
safety has been considered as missing information in the RMP and will be further characterised through 
a Post Authorisation Safety Study, in addition to routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
Pitolisant was not investigated in paediatric population, pregnant and/or breast feeding women, 
population with severe renal or hepatic impairment or with any other significant abnormality in the 
physical examination or clinical laboratory results. Thus, these populations were also considered as 
missing information in the RMP and will be closely monitored via routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The results of the short-term studies support an effect of pitolisant in the treatment of narcolepsy with 
or without cataplexy. The minimal difference of 3 points on final ESS score between pitolisant and 
placebo groups pre-defined in clinical trials and exceeded in Harmony I and Harmony CTP studies is 
considered to be clinically relevant. The cataplexy rate (weekly in Harmony CTP and daily in Harmony 
I) was reduced significantly compared to placebo after 5 to 6 weeks of stable dose treatment.  
Based on available data, the safety profile of pitolisant is acceptable in the treatment of narcolepsy 
with or without cataplexy. No major safety concern was identified in the clinical trials and adverse 
events can be often managed by individual dose adaptation.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of pitolisant is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Narcolepsy is an orphan debilitating disease, with limited therapeutic options.   Pitolisant is a first-in-
class drug acting on histamine H3 receptors mainly present in the brain. Its mechanism of action is 
different from the currently available treatments: CNS psychostimulants (i.e. modafinil) or CNS 
depressant (sodium oxybate) so it can offer an alternative option for the patients and physicians.   
Efficacy of pitolisant has been demonstrated on both major clinical symptoms of narcolepsy; excessive 
daytime sleepiness and cataplexy.  Therefore, the approved indication is the treatment of narcolepsy 
with or without cataplexy.  
As pitolisant is intended to be administered chronically, the benefit-risk balance in the long term 
treatment will be further characterised by a Post Authorisation Safety Study.

significant reduction of cataplexy rate (daily and weekly 
rate in H1 and HCTP, respectively) compared to placebo 
after 5 to 6 weeks of stable dose treatment. While in 
Harmony I and CTP studies, the effect of Wakix on

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Enspryng is indicated as a monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for 
the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) in adult and adolescent patients 
from 12 years of age who are anti-aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4-IgG) seropositive (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
neuromyelitis optica (NMO) or NMOSD.  
Posology 
Enspryng can be used as a monotherapy or in combination with oral corticosteroids (OCs), 
azathioprine (AZA) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (see section 5.1). The posology in adolescent 
patients ≥12 years of age with body weight ≥ 40 kg and adult patients is the same. 
Loading doses 
The recommended loading dose is 120 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection every two weeks for the first 
three administrations (first dose at week 0, second dose at week 2 and third dose at week 4). 
Maintenance doses 
The recommended maintenance dose is 120 mg SC injection every four weeks.

Duration of treatment 
Enspryng is intended for long-term treatment. 
Delayed or missed doses 
If an injection is missed, for any reason other than increases in liver enzymes, it should be 
administered as described in table 1. 
Table 1:  Recommended dosage for delayed or missed doses 
Last dose administered 
Recommended dosage for delayed or missed doses 
Missed a loading dose or less 
than 8 weeks during the 
maintenance period 
The recommended dose should be administered as soon as 
possible without waiting until the next planned dose. 
Loading period 
If the second loading dose is delayed or missed, this dose should 
be administered as soon as possible and the third and final 
loading dose 2 weeks later. 
If the third loading dose is delayed or missed, this dose should be 
administered as soon as possible and the first maintenance dose 4 
weeks later. 
Maintenance period 
After the delayed or missed dose is administered, the dosing 
schedule should be reset to every 4 weeks. 
8 weeks to less than 12 weeks 
The recommended dose should be administered at 0*, 2 weeks 
and every 4 weeks thereafter. 
12 weeks or longer 
The recommended dose should be administered at 0*, 2, 4 weeks 
and every 4 weeks thereafter. 
* 
“0 weeks” refers to time of the first administration after the missed dose. 
Dose modification advice for liver enzyme abnormalities 
If the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) elevation is >5 x upper limit of 
normal (ULN) and associated with any bilirubin elevation, treatment must be discontinued, and 
reinitiation is not recommended. 
If the ALT or AST elevation is >5 x ULN and not associated with any bilirubin elevation, treatment 
should be discontinued. Treatment can be restarted at a dose of 120 mg SC injection every four weeks 
when the ALT and AST levels have returned to the normal range and based on assessment of benefit-
risk of treatment in the patient. If the decision is taken to restart treatment, liver parameters must be 
closely monitored, and if any subsequent increase in ALT/AST and/or bilirubin is observed, treatment 
must be discontinued, and reinitiation is not recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Last dose administered 
Recommended dose for restart of treatment 
Less than 12 weeks 
Treatment should be restarted using the recommended dose, given every 
4 weeks.  
12 weeks or longer 
Treatment should be restarted using the recommended dose, given at 
weeks 0*, 2, 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter. 
* 
“0 weeks” refers to time of the first administration after the restart of treatment. 
Dose modification advice for neutropenia 
If the neutrophil count is below 1.0 x 109/L and confirmed by repeat testing, treatment should be 
interrupted until the neutrophil count is >1.0 x 109/L. 
Dose modification advice for low platelet count 
If the platelet count is below 75 x 109/L and confirmed by repeat testing, treatment should be 
interrupted until the platelet count is ≥75 x 109/L. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The posology in adolescent patients ≥12 years of age with body weight ≥ 40 kg and adult patients is 
the same (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). The safety and efficacy of satralizumab in children with body 
weight < 40 kg have not yet been established. No data are available.  
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients ≥65 years of age (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
The safety and efficacy of satralizumab have not been formally studied in patients with renal 
impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild renal impairment (see section 
5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of satralizumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No 
data are available (see section 5.2).  
Elevations of liver enzymes have been observed during treatment with satralizumab (see sections 4.4 
and 4.8). For dose adjustment, see above section Dose modification advice for liver enzyme 
abnormalities. 
Method of administration 
Satralizumab 120 mg is administered by SC injection using a single-dose PFS. The total content 
(1 mL) of the PFS should be administered. 
The recommended injection sites are the abdomen and thigh. Injection sites should be rotated and 
injections should never be given into moles, scars, or areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, hard, 
or not intact.

Comprehensive instructions for the administration of satralizumab are given at the end of the package 
leaflet. 
Administration by the patient and/or caregiver 
The first injection must be performed under the supervision of a qualified Healthcare Professional 
(HCP).  
After adequate training on how to prepare and perform the injection, an adult patient/caregiver may 
administer all other doses at home if the treating physician determines that it is appropriate and the 
adult patient/caregiver can perform the injection technique. 
Patients/caregivers should seek immediate medical attention if the patient develops symptoms of 
serious allergic reactions and should check with their HCP to confirm whether treatment can be 
continued or not.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the 
administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Infections 
Administration of satralizumab should be delayed in patients with an active infection until the 
infection is controlled (see section 4.2). 
Vigilance for the timely detection and diagnosis of infection is recommended for patients receiving 
treatment with satralizumab. Treatment should be delayed in case the patient develops any serious or 
opportunistic infection and appropriate therapy should be initiated under further monitoring. Patients 
should be instructed on seeking early medical attention in case of signs and symptoms of infections to 
facilitate timely diagnosis of infections. Patients should be provided with a patient alert card. 
Vaccinations 
Live and live-attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with satralizumab as clinical safety 
has not been established. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of satralizumab 
treatment should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunomodulatory 
or immunosuppressive agents. 
No data are available on the effects of vaccination in patients receiving satralizumab. It is 
recommended that all patients be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current 
immunisation guidelines prior to initiating satralizumab treatment.  
Liver enzymes 
Mild and moderate elevations of liver transaminases have been observed with satralizumab treatment, 
most elevations were below 5 x ULN (see section 4.8). 
ALT and AST levels should be monitored every four weeks for the first three months of treatment, 
followed by every three months for one year, thereafter as clinically indicated. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with satralizumab should be discontinued in patients with ALT or AST >5 x ULN (see 
section 4.2). 
Neutrophil count 
Decreases in neutrophil counts have occurred following treatment with satralizumab (see section 4.8). 
Neutrophil counts should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of treatment and thereafter as clinically 
indicated. For recommended dose interruption see section 4.2. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses did not detect any effect of azathioprine (AZA), oral 
corticosteroids (OCs) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on the clearance of satralizumab. 
Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the expression of specific hepatic CYP450 enzymes 
(CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) is suppressed by cytokines such as IL-6.  
Therefore caution should be exercised when starting or discontinuing satralizumab treatment in 
patients also receiving substrates of CYP450 3A4, 1A2, 2C9 or 2C19, particularly those with a narrow 
therapeutic index (such as warfarin, carbamazepine, phenytoin and theophylline), and doses adjusted if 
needed. 
Given the prolonged terminal half-life of satralizumab, the effect of satralizumab may persist for 
several weeks after stopping treatment. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of satralizumab in pregnant women. Studies in monkeys do not indicate 
harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Enspryng during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether satralizumab is excreted in human breast milk. Human IgG is known to be 
excreted in breast milk during the first days after birth, which is decreasing to low concentrations soon 
afterwards; consequently, a risk to breast-fed infants cannot be excluded during this short period. 
Afterwards, use of Enspryng could be considered during breast-feeding only if clinically needed. 
Fertility 
No clinical data are available on the effect of satralizumab on human fertility. Animal studies showed 
no impairment of male or female fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Enspryng has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Body weight 
In the double-blinded treatment period, body weight increase ≥15% from baseline were observed in 
3.8% of patients treated with satralizumab (monotherapy or in combination with IST) as compared 
with 2.7% of patients receiving placebo (or plus IST). 
Laboratory abnormalities 
Neutrophils 
In the double-blinded treatment period, decreased neutrophils were observed in 31.7% of patients 
treated with satralizumab (monotherapy or in combination with IST) as compared with 21.6% of 
patients receiving placebo (or placebo plus IST). The majority of neutrophil decreases were transient 
or intermittent. 
9.6% of patients receiving satralizumab had neutrophils below 1 x 109/L, compared with 5.4% 
receiving placebo (or placebo plus IST). 
Platelets 
In the double-blinded treatment period, decreases in platelet count (below 150 × 109/l) occurred in 
24.0% of patients on satralizumab (monotherapy or in combination with IST) as compared with 9.5% 
of patients receiving placebo or placebo plus IST. The decreased platelet count was not associated 
with bleeding events. 
The majority of the decreased platelets were transient and not below 75 × 109/l. 
Liver enzymes 
In the double-blinded treatment period, elevations in ALT or AST occurred in 27.9% and 18.3% of 
patients treated with satralizumab (monotherapy or in combination with IST) respectively, compared 
with 12.2% and 13.5% of patients receiving placebo or placebo plus IST. The majority of the 
elevations were below 3 x ULN, were transient and resolved without interruption of satralizumab. 
Elevations in ALT or AST >3 x ULN occurred in 2.9% and 1.9% of patients treated with satralizumab 
(monotherapy or in combination with IST) respectively. These elevations were not associated with 
increases in total bilirubin.  
Elevations of ALT above 5 x ULN were observed 4 weeks after initiation of therapy in one (1%) 
patient receiving satralizumab in combination with IST; normalising after discontinuation of 
treatment, and satralizumab was not reintroduced in this patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).  
Lipid parameters 
In the double-blinded treatment period, 10.6% of patients receiving satralizumab (monotherapy or in 
combination with IST) experienced elevations in total cholesterol above 7.75 mmol/l as compared 
with 1.4% of patients receiving placebo (or placebo plus IST); 20.2% of patients receiving 
satralizumab experienced elevations in triglycerides above 3.42 mmol/l as compared with 10.8% of 
patients receiving placebo. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of satralizumab have been studied in 9 children ≥12 years of age. Frequency, 
type and severity of adverse reactions in children from 12 years of age are expected to be the same as 
in adults.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be closely supervised, treated symptomatically, and 
supportive measures instituted as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressants, interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC19 
Mechanism of action 
Satralizumab is a recombinant humanised immunoglobuline G2 (IgG2) monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
that binds to soluble and membrane-bound human IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and thereby prevents IL-6 
downstream signalling through these receptors. 
IL-6 levels are increased in cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients with NMO and NMOSD during 
periods of disease activity. IL-6 functions have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NMO and 
NMOSD, including B-cell activation, differentiation of B-cells to plasmablasts and production of 
pathological autoantibodies, e.g. against AQP4, a water channel protein mainly expressed by 
astrocytes in the CNS, Th17-cell activation and differentiation, T-regulatory cell inhibition, and 
changes in blood-brain-barrier permeability. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In clinical studies with satralizumab in NMO and NMOSD, decreases in C-reactive protein (CRP), 
fibrinogen and complement (C3, C4 and CH50) were observed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of satralizumab were evaluated in two pivotal phase III clinical trials in 
patients with NMOSD (diagnosed as AQP4-IgG seropositive or seronegative NMO [Wingerchuck 
2006 criteria], or as AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD [Wingerchuk 2007 criteria
.  
Study BN40898 included adult and adolescent NMOSD patients aged 12-74 years treated with stable 
IST, with at least 2 relapses in the last 2 years prior screening (with at least one relapse within the 12 
months prior to screening) and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) of 0 to 6.5, whereas study 
BN40900 included adult patients aged 18-74 years on no background IST, with at least 1 relapse or 
first attack within the last 12 months prior to screening and EDSS of 0 to 6.5.  
])
Both studies included approximately 30% AQP4-IgG seronegative NMO patients.  
Efficacy in both studies was evaluated based on time to first relapse as adjudicated by an independent 
Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC), with relapse defined by pre-specified worsening in the EDSS 
and functional system score (FSS) criteria, evaluated within 7 days after the patient reported 
symptoms (adjudicated relapse). 
Study BN40898 (also known as SA-307JG or SAkuraSky) 
Study BN40898 was a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to 
evaluate the effect of satralizumab in combination with stable IST (OCs up to 15 mg/day 
[prednisolone equivalent], AZA up to 3 mg/kg/day or MMF up to 3000 mg/day, adolescents received

a combination of AZA and OCs or MMF and OCs). The double blind period of the study included 83 
AQP4-IgG seropositive and seronegative patients (76 adults and 7 adolescents). Patients received the 
first 3 single doses of satralizumab 120 mg or matching placebo by SC injection in the abdominal or 
femoral region every 2 weeks for the first 4 weeks and once every 4 weeks thereafter.

In AQP4-IgG seropositive patients the relative risk of experiencing an adjudicated relapse in study 
BN40898 was reduced by 79% (Hazard Ratio, HR [95% CI]: 0.21 [0.06-0.75]), in study BN40900 by 
74% (HR [95% CI]: 0.26 [0.11-0.63]) (see Figures 1 and 2). When data across studies BN40898 and 
BN40900 were pooled, treatment with satralizumab with or without IST led to an overall risk 
reduction of 75% (HR [95% CI]; 0.25 (0.12-0.50]) in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients. At 48 weeks, 
85.7% of satralizumab-treated AQP4-IgG seropositive patients remained adjudicated relapse-free 
when used in combination with IST or as monotherapy compared to 58.7% in the placebo group. At 
96 weeks, 81.4% of satralizumab-treated AQP4-IgG seropositive patients remained adjudicated 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relapse-free when used in combination with IST or as monotherapy compared to 47.2% in the placebo 
group. Efficacy was not significant in AQP4-IgG seronegative patients.

AQP4-IgG seropositive patients 
Figure 2: Study BN40900 - time to first adjudicated relapse during the double-blind period in 
AQP4-IgG seropositive patients 
Treatment with satralizumab in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients reduced the annualized rate of 
adjudicated relapses (ARR) by 88% (rate ratio [RR]=0.122, 95% CI: 0.027 - 0.546; p=0.0039) in study 
BN40898 and 90% (RR=0.096, 95% CI: 0.020 - 0.473; p= 0.0086) in study BN40900 compared to 
treatment with placebo.

As compared to placebo-treated patients, the need for rescue therapy (e.g., corticosteroids, intravenous 
immunoglobulin, and/or apheresis [including plasmapheresis or plasma exchange]) was reduced in 
satralizumab-treated AQP4-IgG seropositive patients by 61% (odds ratio [OR]= 0.3930, 95% CI: 
0.1343 -1.1502; p=0.0883) in study BN40898 and by 74% (OR = 0.2617, 95% CI: 0.0862 - 0.7943; 
p=0.0180) in study BN40900.  
Treatment with satralizumab in AQP4-IgG seropositive patients reduced the risk of experiencing a 
severe relapse defined as an EDSS increase ≥ 2 points from the previous EDSS assessment by 85% 
(time to severe adjudicated relapse during the double blind period; HR=0.15, 95% CI: 0.02 -1.25; 
p=0.0441) in study BN40898 and by 79% (HR=0.21, 95% CI: 0.05 - 0.91; p=0.0231) in study 
BN40900 compared to treatment with placebo. 
Key secondary endpoints 
Change from baseline to week 24 in pain or fatigue were not met in studies BN40898 and BN40900. 
Open-label extension 
Analyses of longer term data including the OLE period (based on relapse treated with rescue therapy) 
showed that 58% and 73% of AQP4-IgG seropositive patients treated with satralizumab remained 
relapse-free after 120 weeks of treatment, when satralizumab was administered as add-on therapy or as 
monotherapy, respectively. 
Immunogenicity 
In phase III study BN40898 (in combination with IST) and in phase III study BN40900 (in 
monotherapy), anti-drug-antibodies (ADAs) were observed in 41% and 71% of patients receiving 
satralizumab in the double-blind period, respectively. The ability of ADAs to neutralise satralizumab 
binding is unknown. 
Exposure was lower in ADA positive patients, however there was no impact of ADAs on safety and 
no clear impact on efficacy nor pharmacodynamic markers indicative of target engagement. 
Treatment with satralizumab led to a similar reduction in the risk of experiencing an adjudicated 
relapse in patients in the phase III studies despite different ADA rates between those studies.  
Paediatric population 
In study BN40898, there were 7 adolescent patients enrolled during the double blind period. Their 
mean age was 15.4 years and the median body weight was 79.6 kg. The majority were female (n=6). 
Four patients were White, 2 were Black/African American, and 1 was Asian. Three (42.9%) 
adolescent patients were AQP4-IgG seropositive at screening (2 in the placebo group and 1 in the 
satralizumab group). During the double-blind period, 1 of 3 adolescents in the placebo group and 1 of 
4 adolescents in the satralizumab group experienced an adjudicated relapse. Due to the small sample 
size, the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint of time to first adjudicated relapse in this subgroup was 
not calculated. Two additional adolescent patients were enrolled in the open-label period of the study. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Enspryng in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of NMOSD (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of satralizumab have been characterised both in Japanese and Caucasian healthy 
volunteers, and in NMO and NMOSD patients. The pharmacokinetics in NMO and NMOSD patients 
using the recommended dose were characterised using population PK analysis methods based on a 
database of 154 patients. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The concentration-time course of satralizumab in patients with NMO or NMOSD was accurately 
described by a two-compartment population PK model with parallel linear and target-mediated 
(Michaelis-Menten) elimination and first-order SC absorption. Satralizumab clearance and volume 
parameters allometrically scaled by body weight (through power function with the fixed power 
coefficient of 0.75 and 1 for clearance and volume parameters, respectively). Bodyweight was shown 
to be a significant covariate, with clearance and Vc for patients weighing 123 kg (97.5th percentile of 
the weight distribution) increased by 71.3% and 105%, respectively, compared to a 60 kg patient. 
Steady state pharmacokinetics were achieved after the loading period (8 weeks) for Cmin, Cmax and 
AUC as follows (mean (±SD): Cmin: 19.7 (12.2) mcg/mL, Cmax: 31.5 (14.9) mcg/mL and AUC: 737 
(386) mcg. mL/day.  
Absorption 
The absorption rate constant of satralizumab was 0.0104/h equating to an absorption half-life of 
around 3 days (66 hours) at the recommended dose (see section 4.2). The bioavailability was high 
(85.4%). 
Distribution 
Satralizumab undergoes biphasic distribution. The central volume of distribution was 3.46 L, the 
peripheral volume of distribution was 2.07 L. The inter-compartmental clearance was 14 mL/h. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolism of satralizumab has not been directly studied, as monoclonal antibodies are 
principally cleared by catabolism. 
Elimination 
The total clearance of satralizumab is concentration-dependent. Linear clearance (accounting for 
approximately half of the total clearance at steady state using the recommended dose in NMO and 
NMOSD patients) is estimated to be 2.50 mL/h. The associated terminal t1/2 is approximately 30 days 
(range 22-37 days) based on data pooled from the phase 3 studies.  
Special populations 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses in adult patients with NMO or NMOSD showed that age, 
gender, and race did not meaningfully influence the pharmacokinetics of satralizumab. Although body 
weight influenced the pharmacokinetics of satralizumab, no dose adjustments are recommended for 
any of these demographics. 
Paediatric population 
Data obtained in 8 adolescent patients [13-17 years of age] who received the adult dosing regimen 
show that population PK parameters for satralizumab are not significantly different from those in the 
adult population. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary. 
Elderly 
No dedicated studies have been conducted to investigate the PK of satralizumab in patients ≥65 years 
of age, however patients with NMO or NMOSD between 65 and 74 years of age were included in the 
BN40898 and BN40900 clinical studies. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the PK of satralizumab has been conducted. 
However, patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min and <80 mL/min) 
were included in the phase III studies. Based on population PK analysis there is no impact of renal 
impairment on the PK of satralizumab which is in line with the known mechanisms of clearance for 
satralizumab. Therefore no dose adjustment is required. 
Hepatic impairment 
No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of satralizumab has been conducted 
(see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
Carcinogenicity 
No rodent carcinogenicity studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of 
satralizumab. Proliferative lesions have not been observed in a chronic cynomolgus monkey 6-month 
toxicity study. 
Genotoxicity 
No studies have been performed to establish the mutagenic potential of satralizumab. Antibodies are 
not expected to cause effects on DNA. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Prenatal treatment and postnatal exposure with satralizumab in pregnant monkeys and their offspring 
did not elicit any adverse effects on maternal animals, foetal development, pregnancy outcome or 
infant survival and development including learning ability.  
The concentrations of satralizumab in breast milk were very low (<0.9% of the corresponding 
maternal plasma levels). 
Fertility  
No effects on male or female reproductive organs were seen with chronic treatment of satralizumab in 
monkeys. 
Cytokine release syndrome 
Based on in vitro studies with human blood, the risk of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines with 
satralizumab is considered low in terms of incidence and increase in cytokines.

Instructions for use 
1.  What Enspryng is and what it is used for 
What Enspryng is 
Enspryng contains the active substance satralizumab. It is a type of protein called a monoclonal 
antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are designed to recognise and attach to a specific substance in the 
body. 
What Enspryng is used for 
Enspryng is a medicine for treating neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) in adults and 
young people from 12 years of age. 
What is NMOSD  
NMOSD is a disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. 
It is caused by the immune system (the body’s defences) working incorrectly and attacking nerves in 
the body. 
• 
• 
The damage to the optic nerves causes swelling, leading to pain and loss of sight. 
The damage to the spinal cord causes weakness or loss of movement in the legs or arms, loss of 
feeling, and problems with bladder and bowel function. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In an attack of NMOSD, there is swelling in the nervous system. This also happens when the disease 
comes back (relapse). The swelling causes new symptoms or a return of previous symptoms. 
How Enspryng works 
Enspryng blocks the action of a protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is involved in the processes 
that lead to damage and swelling in the nervous system. By blocking its effects, Enspryng reduces the 
risk of a relapse or attack of NMOSD. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Enspryng  
Do not use Enspryng 
• 
if you are allergic to satralizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If the above applies to you or you are not sure, do not use Enspryng and talk to your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor immediately if you experience any allergic reaction (see section 4. Possible side 
effects). 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Enspryng if any of the below apply to you (or if 
you are not sure). 
Infections 
You cannot use Enspryng while you have an infection. Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if 
you think you have any signs of infection before, during, or after Enspryng treatment such as:

Liver enzymes 
Enspryng can have effects on your liver and increase the amount of some liver enzymes in your blood. 
Your doctor will do blood tests before you are given Enspryng, and during your treatment, to check 
how well your liver is working. Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any of these 
signs of liver damage during or after Enspryng treatment:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) 
dark-coloured urine 
feeling and being sick 
abdominal pain 
White blood cell count 
Your doctor will perform blood tests before you are given Enspryng, and during your treatment, to 
check your white blood cell count. 
Children and young people 
Do not give this medicine to children under 12 years of age. This is because it has not yet been studied 
in this age group. 
Other medicines and Enspryng 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking medicines such as warfarin, carbamazepine, phenytoin 
and theophylline as doses might need to be adjusted. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Your doctor may advise you to stop breast-feeding if you are to be given Enspryng. It is not known 
whether Enspryng passes into breast milk. 
Driving and using machines 
Enspryng is not likely to affect you being able to drive, cycle or use any tools or machines. 
3. 
How to use Enspryng 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How much Enspryng to use 
Each injection contains 120 mg of satralizumab. The first injection will be given under the supervision 
of your doctor or nurse. 
• 
• 
The first three injections are given once every 2 weeks. These are called ‘loading doses’.  
After this, the injection is given every 4 weeks. This is called the ‘maintenance dose’. Continue 
with the injections once every 4 weeks for as long as your doctor tells you to. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How to use Enspryng 
• 
• 
Enspryng is given by injection under the skin (sub-cutaneously).  
Inject the entire content of the syringe each time. 
At the start, your doctor or nurse may inject Enspryng. However, your doctor may decide that you or 
an adult caregiver can inject Enspryng.  
• 
• 
You or your caregiver will get training on how to inject Enspryng.  
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you or your caregiver have any questions about giving injections.  
Read carefully and follow the “Instructions for use” at the end of this leaflet on how to inject 
Enspryng. 
If you use more Enspryng than you should 
Because Enspryng is in a pre-filled syringe, it is unlikely that you will receive too much. However, if 
you are worried, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you accidentally inject more doses than you should, call your doctor. Always take the outer carton 
with you when you go to see the doctor. 
If you forget to use Enspryng 
For the treatment to be fully effective, it is very important to keep having the injections.  
If your doctor or nurse is giving your injections and you miss an appointment, make another one 
straight away.  
If you are injecting Enspryng yourself and you miss an injection, inject it as soon as possible. Do not 
wait until the next planned dose. After you have had the injection for the missed dose, your next 
injection should be either: 
• 
• 
for loading doses – 2 weeks later 
for maintenance doses – 4 weeks later 
Check with your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are not sure.  
If you stop using Enspryng 
Do not suddenly stop using Enspryng without asking your doctor first. If you have any further 
questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Instructions for use 
Read these instructions for use: 
• 
• 
Before you start using your pre-filled syringe 
Each time you get a prescription refill, because it may contain new information. 
• 
• 
• 
This information does not take the place of talking to your doctor or nurse about your medical 
condition or treatment. 
Your doctor or nurse will decide if you or a caregiver can give you injections of Enspryng at 
home. They will also show you or a caregiver the correct and safe way to use the syringe 
before you use it for the first time. 
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any questions.

Prepare to use Enspryng 
1.  Take the carton containing the syringe out of the refrigerator and place it on a clean, flat work 
surface (like a table). 
2.  Check the expiry date on the back of the carton (see Figure C). Do not use if the carton has 
expired. 
3.  Check that the front of the carton is sealed (see Figure C). Do not use if the seal is broken. 
If the expiry date has passed or the seal is broken, go to step 21 “Disposing of Enspryng” and 
contact your doctor or nurse. 
• Check expiration date (back) 
• Check if carton is sealed 
Figure C 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.  Open the sealed carton (see Figure D). 
Figure D 
5.  Carefully lift the syringe out of the carton by holding the barrel (see Figure E). 
•  Do not turn the carton upside down to remove the syringe. 
•  Do not touch the activation guards. This may damage the syringe. 
•  Do not hold the plunger or needle cap. 
Figure E 
Check the syringe 
(See Figure F) 
6.  Check the expiry date on the syringe. Do not use the syringe if it has expired. 
7.  Check the syringe for any damage. Do not use if it is cracked or broken. 
8.  Check that the liquid through the viewing window is clear and colourless to slightly yellow. Do 
not inject the medicine if the liquid is cloudy, discoloured, or has particles in it. 
•  There may be some small air bubbles in the syringe. This is normal and you should not try to 
remove them. 
• Check expiration date 
• Check liquid 
• Check syringe for damage 
Figure F 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If the expiry date has passed, the syringe is damaged or the liquid is cloudy, discoloured or has 
particles in it, do not use. Then go to step 21 “Disposing of Enspryng” and contact your doctor 
or nurse. 
Let your syringe get to room temperature 
9.  Once you have checked the syringe, place it on a clean, flat work surface (like a table) for 
30 minutes. This will allow it to reach room temperature (see Figure G). 
It is important to let the syringe gently reach room temperature because injecting cold medicine 
may feel uncomfortable and make it harder to push the plunger. 
•  Do not speed up the warming process by heating the syringe in any way.  
•  Do not remove the needle cover while the syringe is reaching room temperature. 
Figure G 
Wash your hands 
10.  Wash your hands with soap and water (see Figure H). 
Figure H 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Choose the injection site 
11.  Choose your injection site in either: 
• 
• 
the lower part of your stomach (abdomen) or, 
the front and middle of your thighs (see Figure I). 
Injection site areas 
Figure I 
•  Do not inject into the 5 cm area around your belly button. 
•  Do not inject into moles, scars, bruises, or areas where the skin is tender, red, hard or broken. 
Choose a different injection site for each new injection. Choose a different site for each new 
injection at least 2.5 cm away from the place used last time. 
Clean the injection site 
12.  Wipe the injection site with an alcohol pad and let it air dry. 
•  Do not fan or blow on the area which you have cleaned. 
•  Do not touch the injection site again before you give the injection. 
Figure J 
Inject Enspryng 
13.  Hold the barrel of the syringe between your thumb and index finger. With your other hand, pull 
the needle cap straight off. You may see a drop of liquid at the end of the needle. This is normal 
and will not affect your dose (see Figure K). 
•  Use the syringe within 5 minutes of removing the cap or the needle may clog. 
•  Do not take the needle cap off until you are ready to inject Enspryng. 
•  Do not put the needle cap back on once it has been removed as this may damage the needle. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Do not touch the needle or let it touch any surfaces after removing the needle cap. 
Figure K 
14.  Throw away the needle cap in a puncture-resistant sharps container immediately. See step 21 
“Disposing of Enspryng”. 
15.  Hold the barrel of the syringe using your thumb and index finger. With your other hand, pinch the 
area of skin you have cleaned (see Figure L). 
16.  Use a quick, dart-like motion to insert the needle at an angle between 45° to 90° (see Figure L). 
•  Do not change the angle of the injection while performing the injection.  
•  Do not insert the needle again. 
17.  After the needle is inserted, let go of the pinched skin. 
Figure L 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18.  Slowly inject all of the medicine by gently pushing the plunger all the way down until it touches 
the activation guards (see Figure M). 
Figure M 
19.  Gently release the plunger and allow the needle to come out of the skin at the same angle it was 
inserted (see Figure N). 
Figure N 
•  The needle will now be covered by the automatic needle-guard. If the needle is not 
covered, carefully place the syringe into a puncture-resistant sharps container to avoid injury. 
See step 21 “Disposing of Enspryng”. 
Taking care of the injection site 
20.  There may be a little bleeding at the injection site. You can press a cotton ball or gauze over the 
injection site until any bleeding stops but do not rub it. If needed, you may also cover the area you 
injected with a small bandage. If the medicine comes into contact with your skin, wash the area 
with water. 
Disposing of Enspryng 
21.  Do not try to re-cap your syringe. Put your used syringe in a sharps disposal container 
immediately after use (see Figure O). Do not throw the syringe in your household waste and do 
not recycle it. 
Figure O 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Ask your doctor or nurse or pharmacist for information about where you can get a "sharps" 
container or what other types of puncture-resistant containers you can use to safely dispose of 
your used syringes and needle caps. 
•  Dispose of the used sharps disposal container as instructed by your healthcare provider or 
pharmacist . 
•  Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household waste. 
•  Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container.

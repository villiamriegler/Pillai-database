1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Endoceutics Ltd. submitted on 18 December 2015 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Intrarosa, through the centralised procedure 
under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 22 January 2015.  
The applicant applied for the following indication (as initially proposed):  
“Intrarosa is indicated for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.” 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that prasterone was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance prasterone contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance in comparison to prasterone previously authorised in the 
European Union as Gynodian Depot (prasterone enanthate), DHEA Eljot, Stymen and Biosteron. The 
applicant claimed that prasterone differs significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy 
from the already authorised active substance.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a relatively common condition symptomatically affecting 
approximately 50% of postmenopausal women. It is the consequence of reduced estrogen levels in 
urogenital and pelvic tissue resulting in a loss of vaginal elasticity, dryness, decreased lubrication with 
associated irritation, dyspareunia and urinary symptoms.  
Vulvovaginal atrophy can occur at any time in a woman's life cycle, although it is more common in the 
postmenopausal phase, a time of hypoestrogenism. Other causes of a hypoestrogenic state include 
lactation, various breast cancer treatments, and use of certain medications. In situations other than 
menopause, VVA may resolve spontaneously when estrogen levels are restored. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Numerous retrospective studies have evaluated the prevalence of symptoms of VVA. Although these 
studies differ in type of symptoms elicited, study design, and study population, they provide a range of 
estimates of VVA prevalence. They all used self-reported symptoms of vaginal dryness to determine 
the prevalence of VVA. In general, the prevalence ranged from about 4% in the early premenopausal 
groups to 47% in the late postmenopausal group.  
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
The initial symptom is often lack of lubrication during intercourse. Eventually, persistent vaginal 
dryness may occur. Thinning of the epithelial lining may also cause pruritus, soreness, and a stinging 
pain in the vaginal and vulvar area, which, in turn, may further contribute to dyspareunia. Vaginal 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 9/94 
  
  
spotting, due to small tears in the vaginal epithelium, may also occur. Women with VVA may report a 
thin yellow or grey watery discharge secondary to the rise in pH that accompanies VVA. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Available therapies are either non-hormonal or hormonal treatments.  
Non-hormonal treatments:  
Current OTC treatments include non-hormonal vaginal moisturizers for VVA symptoms and lubricants 
for dyspareunia.  
Vaginal moisturizers are water based, available as liquids, gels, or pessaries inserted every few days. 
Vaginal moisturizers can be safely used long term, but they need to be used regularly for optimal 
effect. 
Vaginal lubricants are shorter acting than moisturizers and are applied at the time of sexual activity to 
reduce dyspareunia. They can be either water or silicone based, with the water-based products being 
the most widely available. They are applied to the vaginal opening and/or to the penis and often 
require repeated application during sexual activity. Silicone-based lubricants require application of only 
a very small amount and last longer. The choice of lubricant may depend on individual preferences and 
product availability. 
Hormonal treatments: 
Because the lack of circulating natural estrogens is the primary cause of atrophic vaginitis, the use of 
estrogen orally, transdermally or vaginally has been shown to be effective in improving symptoms and 
signs of VVA. Estrogen replacement restores normal pH levels and thickens and re vascularizes the 
epithelium. Adequate estrogen replacement therapy increases the number of superficial cells, may 
alleviate existing symptoms or even prevent development of urogenital symptoms if initiated at the 
time of menopause.  
Although vaginal estrogens applied as a cream, vaginal tablets, or a low-dose vaginal ring are 
systemically absorbed, the rise in serum estrogen levels appears to remain well below premenopausal 
levels. Nonetheless, this may be of concern to women with a history of breast or other hormonally 
sensitive cancers. 
About the product 
Intrarosa is presented as vaginal pessaries containing 6.5 mg of active substance prasterone (DHEA), 
to be administered in the vagina, with or without the use of an applicator.  
The approved indication is the “treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women 
having moderate to severe symptoms”.  
The product is to be administered once a day, preferably at bed time.  
No limited treatment duration is proposed by the Applicant. A careful appraisal of the risks and benefits 
should be reassessed at least every 6 months and Intrarosa should only be continued as long as the 
benefit outweighs the risk. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Development program 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 10/94 
  
  
The clinical efficacy of Intrarosa on the symptoms and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) has been 
evaluated in 6 clinical studies performed in Canada and the USA. Within the 6 studies, there were two 
pivotal 12-week efficacy studies (ERC-231 and ERC-238) which support the proposed indication. The 
pivotal efficacy studies were performed in postmenopausal women who have self-identified moderate 
to severe (MS) dyspareunia (pain at sexual activity) as their most bothersome symptom (MBS) of VVA. 
In addition, the clinical programme includes one 7-day PK study (ERC–213), one dose-response study 
(ERC-210), and one placebo-controlled efficacy study performed with a different (reduced) regimen 
(ERC-234).  
The study ERC–230 was an open-label long term (52 weeks) safety study in which efficacy parameters 
were only regarded as secondary endpoints.  
Compliance with CHMP guidance 
There are no specific CHMP guidelines or recommendations for the proposed indication. The US 
“Guidance for Industry: Estrogen and Estrogen/Progestin Drug Products to Treat Vasomotor Symptoms 
and Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy Symptoms – Recommendations for Clinical Evaluation” of January 
2003 was considered by the Applicant for the product development. 
Compliance with scientific advice 
Between 2009 and 2011, Scientific Advices have been given by the following agencies: EMA (initial 
scientific advice on 2009 and a follow-up on 2010), France, Germany, The Netherland, United-
Kingdom, and Sweden. The questions discussed were related to the toxico–pharmacological 
development and clinical development. These Scientific Advices were granted before the entire clinical 
development of the drug product was terminated, leading to changes in the clinical programme.  
During the different scientific advice discussions, the Applicant was encouraged to consider the conduct 
of a 3-arm phase III trial with a placebo arm and an active-controlled arm (e.g. intravaginal estradiol 
considered as the standard treatment). Indeed, comparison to an active treatment was considered as a 
preferable design than only a placebo-controlled trial, in order to put into perspective the efficacy 
compared to a “standard” treatment.  
No active comparator was included in the study development.  
The selection of the 4 co-primary efficacy endpoints was discussed as well as the population to be 
considered for the primary analysis (ITT).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of prasterone, also known as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), is 3β-Hydroxy-5-
androsten-17-one corresponding to the molecular formula C 19H28O2. The active substance has a 
relative molecular mass 288.43 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Chemical structure of prasterone. 
Prasterone is a steroid, which consists of three six-membered rings (A, B and C) and one five-
membered ring (D).  
The molecular structure of prasterone has been confirmed by a combination of spectroscopic methods: 
IR spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, CD-spectroscopy, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, mass 
spectrometry and X-ray diffraction, following a major objection on the lack of characterization data to 
unequivocally demonstrate the structure of the molecule that results from the proposed synthesis. 
Prasterone exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of six chiral centres. These centres originate 
from the proposed starting material, which proceeds from a natural source and provides a well-defined 
stereochemistry of the steroidal system (cyclopentane perhydrophenantrene) which remains 
unchanged during the subsequent chemical transformations leading to the active substance. 
Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by specific optical rotation. 
The active substance is a white to yellowish white non hygroscopic powder, practically insoluble in 
water, soluble in methanol, freely soluble in isopropanol and dichloromethane. 
The active substance exhibits polymorphism. Six polymorphs (Forms I, II, III, IV, V and VI), a ¼ 
hydrate (S1), two polymorphic monohydrates S2 and S3, and a methanol hemisolvate (S4) have been 
described in literature. In internal investigations, a further monohydrate (S5), a 
⅓ hydrate (S  
unstable acetone solvate (S7) were found. According to X-ray diffraction analysis on prasterone 
batches manufactured by the proposed manufacturing process, the active substance produced by the 
proposed manufacturer is mainly composed of one form with traces of a second form. Given that the 
active substance is solubilized in the excipient during the manufacturing process of the finished 
product, polymorphism is considered a non-critical quality attribute.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Prasterone is synthesized in three main steps from a well-defined starting material with acceptable 
specifications, followed by purification and crystallization. Detailed information on the manufacturing of 
the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered 
satisfactory. 
During the evaluation, a major objection on the proposed starting material was raised since there were 
concerns regarding the impurity profile of the compound, its proposed specification, the information on 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 12/94 
  
  
 
 
 
the fate and purge of impurities, and the criticality of the synthetic steps prior to the proposed starting 
material. These concerns were adequately addressed by the ASMF holder, who provided data on the 
potential carry-over of impurities and the criticality of the steps prior to the proposed starting material, 
revised the starting material specification and provided information on the plant species, 
region/location, harvesting, storage conditions and extractions and solvents used. Based on the 
additional information provided, the proposed API starting material was accepted. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged into a polyethylene bag which is then sealed and placed into another 
polyethylene-aluminium laminated bag. The polyethylene-aluminium laminated bag is shipped within a 
fiber drum, properly labelled, and provided with a plastic seal. The polyethylene complies with 
Regulations 1935/2004/EC, 2023/2006/EC and 10/2011/EC. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance/description, identification (IR, HPLC), 
loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), total ash (Ph. Eur.), water content (KF), heavy metals (Ph. Eur. Method C), 
optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), hydroxylamine (UV/Vis), and residual 
solvents (GC; GC-HS). 
The specification of Prasterone complies with the requirements defined in the guidelines ICH Q6A 
Specifications: Test procedures and acceptance criteria for new drug substances and new drug 
products: Chemical substances, ICH Q3A Impurities in new drug substances and Q3C Impurities: 
Guideline for residual solvents. A specification limit for hydroxylamine in line with the French 
Pharmacopoeia was introduced during the marketing authorisation evaluation as requested by the 
CHMP. 
The two impurities with noted alerting structures are controlled to the TTC level.  
The omission of benzene and polymorphism from the active substance specification was adequately 
justified. Benzene is included in the specifications of the relevant solvents (isopropanol and methanol), 
and the active substance is solubilised in the excipient, so polymorphism is not a critical quality 
attribute (CQA).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three commercial scale of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for 60 months under long term conditions at 25 ± 2°C / 60 
± 5 % RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ± 2°C / 75 ± 5 % RH according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided.

The following parameters were tested: description, identification (IR), start of melting, end of melting, 
specific optical rotation, loss on drying, water content, impurities and assay. The specifications limits 
and analytical procedures for the parameters tested during stability are identical to those employed by 
the ASMF holder for release testing.  
The stability results presented are all within the proposed specifications. Although a slight increase in 
loss on drying and  water  content was observed, both under long term and accelerated conditions, all 
results complied with the specifications. No trends were observed in any of the other tests. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. This study 
indicated that the active substance is photolabile. 
In addition, a forced degradation study under high temperature, high humidity, acidic and alkali 
conditions, oxidative condition, exposure to light was performed on five batches. Samples were tested 
for appearance, assay, specific impurities and unknown impurities. High degradation was observed 
upon exposure to high temperatures (above 80°C) or oxidation. Prasterone, both solid and in aqueous 
suspension, showed degradation under the light influence.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a pessary for vaginal use containing 6.5 mg of prasterone as active substance. 
The pessary is approximately 28 mm long and 8.6 mm in diameter at its widest end.  
The pessaries are packaged in sealed PVC/PE blisters. 
The pessary is administered using the finger or a vaginal applicator made with LDPE and 1% of white 
colorant.  The  applicant  provided  a  self-declaration  for  Class  I  device  that  the  applicator  meets  the 
provisions of Council Directive 93/42/EEC as amended by 2007/47/EC. The applicators are individually 
wrapped with a plastic film.  
The qualitative composition of Intrarosa is presented in Table 1 below.

The physical characteristics of the active substance after re-solidification step were examined by X-Ray 
Powder Diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Scanning Electron Microscopy 
(SEM), demonstrating that prasterone is completely solubilized in the excipient.  
As mentioned above, the only excipient in the formulation is hard fat, a compendial (EP) mixture of 
fatty acid esters. Its melting point is in the range of 33.5–35.5°C, which allows having solid pessaries 
at room temperature that melt rapidly when introduced into the vaginal cavity at 37°C permitting the 
release of the active substance. This is a well-known pharmaceutical ingredient and its quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The only excipient is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this 
report. 
The same qualitative composition and container closure system were used for the manufacture of the 
finished product at all sites during all clinical studies; the only difference was the batch size. Different 
strengths were manufactured to support pre-clinical and clinical studies: 0% (placebo), 0.25% 
(3.25 mg), 0.5% (6.5 mg), 1% (13 mg) and 1.8% (23.4 mg) prasterone. Based on the results from 
these studies, the 0.5% (6.5 mg) strength was selected for commercialization. 
Following a major objection on the rationale for the choice of the dissolution method and its 
discriminatory nature, the applicant provided a historical summary of the dissolution method regarding 
dissolution apparatus (paddle versus flow-through cell), paddle speed effect, effect of medium (pH), 
sink conditions and SLS concentration. In addition, the discriminating ability of the proposed QC 
dissolution method was demonstrated using different batches of pessaries manufactured with different 
grades of hard fat and different amounts of prasterone (from 0.5% to 1.8%) in hard fat . The data 
presented addressed the concerns and the proposed quality control (QC) dissolution method was 
considered acceptable. 
Since initial development, the manufacturing process had been scaled up two times and transferred to 
four different manufacturing facilities. Prior to manufacturing clinical trial batches, the manufacturing 
process was optimized. The primary focus of the study was on the three interdependent variables that 
impact converting the sealed product dosage form from its liquid phase to its solid phase (product 
temperature, cooling temperature, and machine speed). Based on the results of these experiments the 
temperatures/settings to manufacture clinical supplies were defined.  
The impact of critical process parameters (CPPs) on the product critical quality attributes (CQAs) was 
evaluated.  
Two manufacturing sites are proposed for marketing. In order to support the pre-approval 
manufacturing site transfer from one site to the other, appropriate validation batches and profile 
comparison was performed between the two sites. The primary packaging is PVC/PE blister. The 
polyethylene lamina, which is the drug contact surface, conforms to Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product. As mentioned above, the product is administered using the finger or a CE 
marked vaginal applicator that is made of LDPE material and a white colorant (approximately 1%). 
The applicators should be re-used during one week and then discarded (2 back-up applicators are 
included, if needed). A study was conducted to identify the best suitable cleaning procedure and to 
demonstrate that this cleaning procedure results in a sufficient reduction of the micro-organisms. The 
cleaning procedure is described in section 4.2 of the SmPC.

EMA/793337/2017 
Page 15/94 
  
  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: melting the hard fat, adding and dissolving the 
prasterone active substance, filling the PVC/PE formed cavities, cooling and sealing alveoli, packaging 
strips in a carton box. 
The applicant did not define critical steps and relevant operating process parameters in the original 
submission, which resulted in a major objection. This information was added during the procedure and 
the concerns were satisfactorily addressed. 
The  in-process  controls  comprise:  clarity  of  solution  (of  the  active  substance  dissolved  in  the 
excipient),  appearance  and  weigh  of  the  pessaries  and  molds  seal.  The  in-process  controls  are 
adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Process 
validation data from three commercial scale batches manufactured at each of the proposed 
manufacturing sites according to the production protocol and validation plan were presented. It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specification includes appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification (HPLC, UV), melting temperature (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurities 
(HPLC), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), average weight, dissolution (Ph. Eur.), microbial limit tests: 
TAMC, yeast and molds, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. 
The limits of known and unknown impurities were established in accordance with ICH Q3B and the 
total impurities limit was established to cover the limits of individual known impurities which are known 
metabolites of DHEA. 
The dissolution specification was defined to cover the dissolution behavior observed in the stability 
studies, which was evaluated and concluded to have no impact on the in vivo effect of the drug product 
in women. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis results are provided for eighteen batches of different strengths used in first clinical 
studies, as well as three commercial scale batches from each of the proposed manufacturing sites 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of finished product produced by each of the proposed 
finished product manufacturers stored under long term and intermediate conditions for 36 months at 
5°C ± 3°C, 25 ºC / 60% RH and 30°C /75% RH, and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of Intrarosa are 
representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed 
for marketing.  
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 16/94 
  
  
Supportive data from four additional batches from another manufacturer used during development 
were also provided. The only difference of these batches is that they were filled in larger blisters, 
instead of the smaller size used of the commercial blisters, which represent a worst case condition.  
Samples were tested for appearance, package integrity, melting range, assay, impurities, dissolution 
and microbial tests. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
All test results were within the specification limits except assay at 30°C / 75% RH which droped below 
the proposed specification at 36 months. However, this condition at 36 months is not used to support 
the proposed storage conditions in the EU. 
All other parameters were stable under the conditions and showed no trend during storage except for 
dissolution of samples stored at 5°C, 25°C / 60% RH and 30°C / 75% RH which showed slight 
deceleration in dissolution over time due to known partial and progressing crystallisation of the hard 
fat during storage.  
Under accelerated conditions, 40°C/75% RH out of specification results were observed for appearance 
after 6 months storage and for assay for some batches. No change of dissolution behaviour occured 
with samples stored at 40°C/75% RH because the pessaries are completely molten during this arm of 
the study and no hard fat crystallization can therefore develop. 
The photostability of the finished product was assessed in line with ICH Q1B “Guideline Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Product” on one batch. Unprotected vaginal pessaries exposed to 
light stress exhibited increased levels of degradation products as well as decrease of the assay and 
dissolution, with out of specification results; whereas dark controls and pessaries protected in the 
commercial primary packaging showed comparable results within the specifications. Therefore, the 
finished product is not stable when exposed to light (as per ICH photostability conditions) outside of its 
primary packaging, but the proposed commercial primary packaging is suitable for light protection.  
Based on the results presented, the proposed shelf-life is of 36 months. The drug product can also be 
stored refrigerated at 5°C (optional). 
Forced degradation studies were also conducted as part of the validation of the analytical HPLC method 
for assay. Samples were exposed to temperature (200°C for 1h), base (1N NaOH, 24h), acid (1N HCl, 
24h), and oxidation (30% H2O2, 24h). Major oxidative compounds were observed after exposure of 
the active substance and finished product to thermal conditions.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of three years with the special storage 
condition “Store below 30°C. Do not freeze.” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Although there were several major objections during the 
procedure, namely on the selection of the starting material, control of hydroxylamine in the active 
substance specification, choice and discriminatory nature of the QC dissolution method and omission of 
critical steps and operating process parameters from the finished product manufacturing process 
description, these were satisfactorily addressed during the evaluation procedure. The results of tests 
carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 17/94 
  
  
in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Five non-clinical studies have been submitted in support of the application; the Applicant has indicated 
that these are GLP-compliant. All other non-clinical evidence has been derived from the published 
literature; the GLP status could not be verified from these publications. 
The pharmacology part of the dossier is only based on scientific publications. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacology data are limited to in vivo studies in OVX rat model, no in vitro data have been 
submitted.  
A 2-week study has been performed by the Applicant in the OVX rat model with intravaginal 
administration of prasterone (DHEA) as pessaries using the same formulation used in clinical (Study 
URMA-r-70-05).  
Three doses of DHEA have been tested in this study: 0.33, 0.66 and 1 mg/pessary. The efficacy 
endpoints were only limited to histological assessment without measurement of the vaginal epithelial 
thickness. No vaginal smears were performed and no active estrogen comparator was included in the 
design of the study. Results are only reported in the context of a publication (Berger et al, 2008) with 
limited details. Based on morphological assessment, the vehicle appears to produce an effect of its own 
with no significant differences between DHEA treated animals and placebo after 2 weeks. Sex steroid 
expression was used by the Applicant to assess the extent of androgenic and estrogenic response. 
However, given the high expression in all groups it is not possible to evaluate and interpret these data.   
Other pharmacodynamic data in the OVX rat model are available from 2 published studies investigating 
the effects of percutaneous administration or vaginal application of DHEA up to 9 and 3 months, 
respectively. In these studies, efficacy criteria were also limited to histological assessment and vaginal 
weight. Vaginal epithelial thickness was only determined in the 9-month study performed with a higher 
dose of 80 mg/kg in which DHEA increased thickness of the vaginal epithelium. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 18/94 
  
  
In all studies, DHEA administration caused mucification and vacuolization typical of an androgenic 
effect.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The effects of intravaginal DHEA administration on the uterus and mammary gland have been 
investigated in the context of the primary pharmacodynamics studies conducted in OVX rats.  
In the 2-week study performed with intravaginal administration as pessaries (Study URMA-r-70-05), 
no significant morphological effects attributable to DHEA treatment were observed in the uterus and 
mammary gland. A small non-significant increase in AR expression was recorded in the two higher 
DHEA dose-groups.  
In a 12-month study performed with DHEA applied on the dorsal skin (Sourla, Martel et al 1998), a 
dose of 30 mg stimulated lobuloalveolar and ductal growth.  
The applicant has not performed receptor binding screening. Literature data suggest that DHEA could 
bind to some receptors and/or ion channels at exposure levels, which are not clinically relevant. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology data have been provided regarding potential effects of systemic availability of 
exogenous DHEA on the peripheral, central and autonomic nervous systems, respiratory and/or 
cardiovascular systems. The Applicant justifies this lack given the mode of administration.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific studies have been provided, but the applicant has reviewed the pharmacological effect of 
DHEA in combination with the anti-estrogens and SERMs (EM-800 and acolbifene) or anti-androgens 
(Flutamide). These did not reveal any concerns for the proposed use and no further data were 
requested. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No specific ADME studies have been performed. The submitted data are from scientific publications. 
The serum levels of DHEA and some of its metabolites have been determined in the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies performed by oral route in rats and monkeys. 
Method of analysis 
Validated GC-MS and LC-MS/MS methods were used to quantify DHEA and its metabolites in repeat 
dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys and in the PD/PK study performed in OVX rats. The stability 
in rat and monkey serum under analysis and storage conditions has been investigated. Long term 
stability in monkey serum at -80°C for ADT-G, 3α-diol-3G and 3α-diol-17G was not assessed.   
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetic data following single intravaginal administration are available in the context of the 
primary pharmacodynamics study performed in the OVX rats (Study URMA-r-70-05). The serum levels 
of DHEA and some of its metabolites: DHEA-S, 5-DIOL, 4-DIONE, TESTO, DHT, E2 and E1 have been 
determined up to 4 hours. A systemic exposure to DHEA was clearly demonstrated with a rapid 
absorption.  
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 19/94 
  
  
Distribution 
No specific data have been provided. 
Metabolism 
The  metabolic  fate  of  DHEA  is  well  characterized.  However,  there  are  significant  inter-species 
differences regarding patterns/rate of DHEA transformation to androgenic or estrogenic hormones.  
Excretion 
No specific data have been provided. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies were not conducted.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies have not been performed via intravaginal route, which is the 
intended route of administration in clinical. Repeat-dose toxicity studies have been performed in rats 
and monkeys via the oral route up to 26 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. The oral route was 
selected by the Applicant to permit high exposure multiples relative to humans. This approach was 
discussed and agreed during the scientific advice given by the EMA. However, the performed repeat 
dose toxicity studies were not specifically designed to assess the safety profile of DHEA as a single 
compound.  
In female monkeys treated with DHEA alone, no adverse effects were observed on any parameters 
evaluated at both doses. At the highest dose tested of 10 mg/kg, the exposure to DHEA and DHEA-S 
was 7,8 and 3,4 fold compared to human exposure.   
In female rats exposed to DHEA as a single compound, lower serum bilirubin concentrations, higher 
serum alkaline phosphatase and higher liver weights were observed at 100 mg/kg without histological 
changes. Minimal to slight squamous metaplasia of the glandular epithelium was observed in some 
animal (3-4 per group) at both doses. At the lowest dose tested of 10 mg/kg, the exposure to DHEA 
and DHEA-S was 2,5 and 1 fold compared to human exposure.   
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
Prasterone did not reveal a genotoxic potential in a standard battery of genotoxicity. A carcinogenicity 
study was not conducted. The applicant has provided adequate justification utilising available 
knowledge regarding the potential impact of DHEA-derived hormones on carcinogenic risk. However, 
as outlined during the scientific advice, given the route of administration there is a concern for local 
carcinogenic effects since DHEA is converted locally into androgens and estrogens, a local carcinogenic 
effect cannot be excluded (please refer to discussion on abnormal Pap smears (MedDRA term: cervical 
dysplasia) in the clinical section of this assessment report). 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 20/94 
  
  
Reproduction Toxicity 
No specific studies were performed, which is agreed because of the indication.  
Local Tolerance  
A non-clinical study investigating the local tolerance in the vagina was not performed. However, clinical 
data on local tolerance were obtained from women treated with prasterone pessaries up to 52 weeks 
as well as from women who received placebo pessaries containing the excipient up to 12 weeks; no 
further non-clinical data were requested.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Log Kow has been determined experimentally and is ‹ 4,5.  
The PECsw is above the trigger value of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore a phase II environmental fate and effects 
analysis would in principle be required. The Applicant has not performed specific studies as described 
in the Guideline and used available data on the European Chemical website.  
As DHEA can be considered as a pro-drug and is nearly fully metabolized, additional studies are not 
necessary. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology  
Pharmacodynamics studies submitted in support of this application are limited to scientific publications.  
The applicant claims that DHEA is converted intracellularly into active sex steroids in the vagina, and 
thus the active steroids exert their effects locally on the vagina. However, the actual formation of 
these active steroids in the vagina has not been clearly demonstrated. 
Only one study was performed in OVX rat via intravaginal administration. This study was a 2-week 
PD/PK performed by the applicant (Study URMA-r-70-05). However, results are only available in the 
context of a publication. Based on morphological assessment, the vehicle appears to produce an effect 
of its own with no significant differences between DHEA treated animals and placebo after 2 weeks. No 
significant morphological effects attributable to DHEA treatment were observed in the uterus and 
mammary gland.  
In relation to secondary pharmacodynamics, the applicant has not performed receptor binding 
screening. Literature data suggest that DHEA could bind to some receptors and/or ion channels at 
exposure levels, which are not clinically relevant.   
Safety pharmacology data have not been provided. This lack is acceptable given the limited 
bioavailability demonstrated in clinical studies.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Validated methods were used to quantify DHEA and its metabolites in repeat dose toxicity studies.  
The metabolic fate of DHEA appears well elucidated. Considering the significant inter-species 
differences highlighted by the applicant in relation to endogenous DHEA levels, additional non-human 
characterisation of DHEA metabolism would likely be of little value. Specific distribution or excretion 
studies were not under taken by the applicant.  
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 21/94 
  
  
As evaluated in vitro using pooled human liver microsomes, up to the highest tested drug 
concentration (IC50 > 10 μM), co-incubation with DHEA did not affect the activities of CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4, thus indicating that drug-drug interactions due to inhibition 
of these enzymes by DHEA is unlikely. Specific CYP450 induction studies were not performed. 
However, this lack is justified.  
Toxicology 
The toxicology of DHEA was evaluated in two long-term repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted under 
GLP conditions in rats and monkeys. DHEA was given orally in these studies to permit sufficiently high 
exposure multiples relative to humans, since such high exposures were not possible to achieve using 
the intended intravaginal route in animal models. However, these studies were not specifically 
designed to study the safety profile of DHEA as single compound. The species were selected according 
to previous studies performed with acolbifene and estradiol. Moreover, only two doses of DHEA have 
been tested in the repeat-dose toxicity studies performed in both species, whereas three doses are 
generally recommended.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been conducted, which is agreed given the clinical 
indication.  
DHEA was not genotoxic in a standard battery and formal carcinogenicity studies were not conducted.  
As agreed during the scientific advice, local or systemic rodent long term carcinogenicity studies are 
not necessary nor appropriate and were not performed by the Applicant. The Applicant claims that the 
increase of DHEA and its metabolites observed is in the normal ranges of post-menopausal women and 
has no clinical significance, and thus a carcinogenic risk is unlikely. However, given the route of 
administration there is a concern for local carcinogenic effects since DHEA is supposed to be converted 
locally into androgens and estrogens. A local carcinogenic effect at the cervix or via diffusion to the 
endometrium cannot be excluded and clinical data are limited. This issue has been included in the risk 
management plan.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no unresolved issues from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
One study, Study ERC-213, was performed to evaluate an eventual absorption of DHEA and systemic 
exposure. This study was performed in 2006 to assess efficacy, safety and PK of prasterone 
administered intra-vaginally. It included 40 subjects, 10 for each treatment groups. Subjects received 
a placebo, or 0.5% prasterone pessaries (strength intended for commercialisation), or 1% prasterone 
pessaries, or 1.8% prasterone pessaries, once daily for seven days. PK data were available at Day 1 
and Day 7. 
Lack of ISR (incurred sample reanalysis) was incompletely justified (as compared to the PKWP Q and A 
recommendations), but further explanations provided by the applicant are considered sufficient. Data 
excluded from the PK analysis set were properly justified. 
Compared to placebo, the AUC0-24 of DHEA increased: 
* 2.68 fold, 3.06 fold and 5.05 fold at Day 1 for 0.5%, 1% and 1.8%, respectively, 
* 2.26 fold, 3.07 fold and 4.61 fold at Day 7 for 0.5%, 1% and 1.8%, respectively. 
Discussion on average serum level comparisons (AUC0-24 / 24 hours) was much less pertinent and 
was not pursued further. Based on comparisons of AUC0-24, a systemic passage of DHEA cannot be 
excluded. However, the following elements must be taken into account: 
* The small sample size (10 subjects per strength investigated), 
* A very large inter-individual variability found in literature, 
* A parallel design that allows only for an indirect comparison of a treated subject versus a placebo 
subject. A crossover design would have allowed for individual comparison of DHEA with each subject as 
their own reference, 
The applicant`s main argument is that the DHEA serum concentrations after administration of 0.5% 
prasterone pessaries are in the same range as those in post-menopausal women in literature (Labrie, 
Bélanger et al, The journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology, vol. 99, p 182-188, June 
2006). But this does not account for the higher DHEA serum concentrations after the 1.8% prasterone 
pessaries. It is to be noted that the literature data comes from the same research team that performed 
study ERC-213. Sampling time and analytical methods were provided by the applicant further to CHMP 
request, but the age range in the referenced literature (55-65 years) differs from that in study ERC-
213 (44-72 years; median age: 62 years), making comparison of those concentrations problematic.  
Study ERC-230 and the safety (ISS) report provided additional data for serum DHEA and metabolites. 
The applicant was asked for an additional table summarizing those exposures and the comparative 
descriptive statistics attached to it. The applicant’s answer was incomplete, as they did not separate 
the effects of different weeks. However, when comparing this additional table with the summary of 
data presented in the initial submission, several changes from baseline become statistically significant 
once Study ERC-234 was taken off. Additionally, the changes from baseline for placebo are never 
statistically significant, asserting that variability does not prevent comparison of data.

In  the  state  of  knowledge  described  by  those  data,  it  can  be  concluded  that  there  is  a  statistically 
significant  increase  of  exposure  in  DHEA,  E1,  testosterone  and  other  analytes  for  all  the  different 
strengths of DHEA tested.  
During  the  procedure,  the  Applicant  was  asked  to  compare  the  observed  increases  in  systemic 
exposure  at  week  52  to  an  independent  reliable  public  source/guidelines  presenting  normal 
postmenopausal ranges that are commonly used in clinical practice. Results showed that the increase 
of  DHEA  &  related  metabolites  levels  observed  during  the  clinical  trials  with  a  dose  of  6.5  mg  of 
prasterone  was  indeed  statistically  significant  compared  to  the  baseline  (and  to  placebo)  but  this 
increase  remains  within  normal  post-menopausal  steroid  concentration  ranges  (as  per  usual 
observations and guidelines). 
Finally, there are additional safety signs that point to systemic exposure (please refer to the discussion 
on safety regarding TEAE related to androgenic and estrogenic exposure). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The potential of dehydroepiandrosterone to act as a direct inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 
isoforms (CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) was evaluated in vitro using 
pooled human liver microsomes. In addition, the potential of DHEA to act as a time-dependent inhibitor 
of CYP3A4 was evaluated by comparing the inhibitory potential of DHEA after 30 min pre-incubation 
with NADPH-supplemented human liver microsomes with those of obtained after co-incubation. 
Based on the results, drug-drug interactions through inhibition of CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 by dehydroepiandrosterone are unlikely. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The pharmacological effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; prasterone) on the vagina were 
evaluated by the Applicant in R&D studies performed in virgin female rats following intravaginal 
administration of DHEA by pessaries or topical application on the vaginal mucosa as well as following 
percutaneous application of DHEA on the skin which is similar to the vaginal mucosa. At daily doses of 
0.33 mg, 0.66 mg or 1 mg DHEA/pessary in ovariectomized animals for two weeks, the objective was 
to induce local beneficial effects in the vagina without significant systemic action. The results show that 
the morphological effects of DHEA on the vaginal mucosa were observed at the lowest dose used (0.33 
mg DHEA/pessary) and consisted mainly of a typical androgenic effect of epithelial mucification. No 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 25/94 
  
  
 
 
change in morphological features related to cell proliferation was observed at any DHEA dose used (up 
to 1 mg DHEA/pessary) on the uterus, mammary gland and skin. Immunohistochemistry for androgen, 
estrogen alpha and progesterone receptors did not reveal any significant systemic effects in the uterus, 
mammary gland and skin except some suggestion of increased androgen receptor labeling in 
mammary gland and skin at the highest DHEA dose. The data obtained from this preclinical study 
shows that intravaginal DHEA can exert beneficial effects limited to the vagina. Two other studies 
performed in rats following topical application of DHEA on the vaginal mucosa and on the skin have 
also demonstrated the beneficial effects of DHEA on the vagina. 
No specific clinical studies of phase I were performed to clarify the pharmacological effect of DHEA on 
the human vagina. The Applicant hypothesis and conclusions with regard to the DHEA mechanism of 
action repose on results obtained at pre-clinical level from studies performed in female rat.  
The mechanism of action of DHEA administered intravaginally is based on the hypothesis of 
intracrinology. This hypothesis - proposed by the Applicant - suggests that DHEA, an inactive 
compound by itself, is converted in peripheral tissues (vaginal cells) under the action of specific 
enzymes into sex steroids and then inactivated locally thus avoiding an increase of systemic exposure 
to sex steroids. However, a clear proof of this concept (intracrinology) is neither sustained by 
dedicated studies in the dossier nor confirmed by data of the literature (if we exclude all the published 
articles related to the submitted dossier). In addition, increase in systemic exposure of DHEA 
metabolite after treatment with prasterone is observed (see PK section of the report).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Regarding primary pharmacology, no specific phase I or phase II study was performed by the 
Applicant to elucidate the DHEA primary pharmacology. Data are obtained from the phase III studies 
(in particular pharmacodynamics parameters of efficacy and values of serum sex steroid after 
intravaginal exposure to DHEA).  
The concept of intracrinology proposed by the Applicant suggests that steroid-forming and steroid-
inactivating enzymes expressed in peripheral tissues permit to each cell to synthesize a small amount 
of androgens and/or estrogens in order to meet the local physiological needs, without affecting the 
other tissues of the organism. However, a systemic increase in serum sex steroids, further to 
administration to DHEA intravaginally, cannot be excluded (see PK section and increase in DHEA AUC 
after vaginal exposure).  
In conclusion, a proof of the intracrinology concept (conversion of DHEA to active metabolites inside 
the vaginal cells and local action) is not provided in the dossier. No formal phase I or phase II studies 
were performed. Clarification of DHEA pharmacodynamics is based on analysis of DHEA effect on 
vaginal mucosa (increase in superficial cells and decrease in parabasal cells).  
Treatment with prasterone is associated with systemic exposure as an increase in serum levels of 
DHEA metabolites is observed (see PK section above for more details). When compared to the 
extended literature data, the increase of DHEA & related metabolites levels observed during the clinical 
trials with a dose of 6.5 mg of prasterone was indeed statistically significant compared to the baseline 
(and to placebo) but this increase remains within normal post-menopausal steroids concentration 
ranges (as per usual observations and guidelines). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamic effects of the vaginal DHEA observed in the phase II PK study ERC-213 consist 
of a change in vaginal maturation index (increase in percentage of superficial cells, decrease in 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 26/94 
  
  
percentage of parabasal cells) and vaginal pH. However, the mechanism of action of DHEA 
administered intravaginally is not fully elucidated.  
DHEA (prasterone) is an endogenous steroid secreted by the adrenal cortex having no intrinsic 
estrogenic or androgenic activity. It is an inactive precursor of testosterone and oestradiol. Serum 
DHEA and DHEA-S progressively decrease from the age of 30-50 years with a 60% decrease at 
menopause. The Applicant suggests that intravaginal DHEA provides the appropriate levels of 
androgens and/or oestrogens delivered exclusively in specific tissues by ‘intracrine’ mechanisms, while 
avoiding systemic effects of the active sex steroids. Based on the Applicant hypothesis, oestradiol 
would contribute to an increase in superficial cells, while androgens strengthen the other two layers of 
the vaginal wall. The “Intracrinology” concept proposed by the Applicant to clarify the mechanism of 
action is based on the hypothesis that steroid-forming and steroid-inactivating enzymes expressed in 
peripheral tissues permit to each cell to synthesize a small amount of androgens and/or estrogens in 
order to meet the local physiological needs, without affecting the other tissues of the organism. 
However, it is unclear to what extent DHEA is metabolised to estradiol and testosterone.  
In addition, the “intracrinology” concept is supposed to exclude increase in sex steroid serum levels 
after administration of vaginal DHEA. However, from the PK study ERC–213, increases were observed 
in AUC (0 - 24 hours) of DHEA of 127%, 207% and 361% over control at 6.5 mg, 13 mg and 23.4 mg 
doses of DHEA, respectively. Similar increases of the AUC (0-24 hours) for all other steroids were 
observed on Day 1 and Day 7. 
The applicant has compared the estrogen levels of Intrarosa pessaries to Vagifem 25 micrograms 
estradiol containing vaginal tablets and Premarin 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens containing vaginal 
cream. Due to the relatively high oestrogen exposure, the use of the Vagifem 25 micrograms dose has 
been mostly abandoned and the Premarin cream is not approved anymore. Therefore, the selected 
comparators are not supported. At day 120 of the procedure the company was asked to compare the 
systemic estradiol and oestrone levels of Intrarosa pessaries to literature data on Vagifem 10 
micrograms, which is commonly used for vaginal atrophy. Results of this comparison were provided by 
the Applicant and data showed that the levels of estradiol, estrone & estrone sulphate after 12 weeks 
treatment with prasterone are comparable to treatment with 10 µg of vaginal estradiol (Vagifem). 
The percent aromatization of DHEA to estradiol and oestrone positively correlates with body weight. At 
day 120 of the procedure, the Applicant was requested to discuss whether obesity and subsequently 
aromatization of the androgens could have an effect on serum levels of estradiol and oestrone 
metabolites. The Applicant has presented the change in co-primary endpoint from baseline in subjects 
based on their BMI. There is no difference in change of primary efficacy endpoint. The Applicant has 
also presented a subgroup analysis & forest plot assessing the effect of BMI on the co-primary 
endpoints and noticeable treatment effect differences between investigated subgroups were not found. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The intracrinology concept proposed by the Applicant to explain the mechanism of action is based on 
the hypothesis that steroid-forming and steroid-inactivating enzymes expressed in peripheral tissues 
permit to each cell to synthesize a small amount of androgens and/or oestrogens in order to meet the 
local physiological needs, without affecting the other tissues of the organism. However, PK data 
showed a statistically significant increase in serum levels (compared to baseline) of DHEA and its 
metabolites, sustaining systemic exposure after intravaginal administration of DHEA but further 
comparison with independent reliable public sources/guidelines presenting normal postmenopausal 
ranges that are commonly used in clinical practice led to the conclusion that those increases were 
actually within normal post-menopausal ranges.

Clinical safety consequences on long term cannot be excluded.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Dose – response study (ERC–210) 
Design and objectives 
This dose-response study was a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized study conducted in 
Canada and US to evaluate the effectiveness of vaginal suppositories (pessaries) at four different DHEA 
concentrations on the symptoms and signs of vaginal atrophy.  
The primary objective was to determine the dose-response of vaginal mucosa parameters to the local 
action of DHEA in postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy. Secondary objective was to 
investigate the effect of DHEA on sexual dysfunction and libido.  
The treatment groups were placebo and 3 DHEA doses: 0.25% (3.25 mg), 0.5% (6.5 mg) or 1.0% (13 
mg).  
The study included postmenopausal women from 40 to 75 years old with vulvovaginal atrophy (low 
vaginal maturation index and vaginal pH over 5). They should have self-identified at least one 
moderate to severe clinical symptom related to VVA (vaginal dryness, irritation or vaginal pain during 
intercourse).  
No baseline information about frequency of intercourse in study participants was available.  
Following randomization, two-hundred eighteen (218) evaluable participants (54-56 subjects per arm) 
were to be treated daily for 12 weeks.  
The Applicant considered this study as a phase III study; however, given the limited population size 
and the study objective, it should be considered as a phase II dose-response (supportive) study. 
Endpoints: 
There were four co-primary endpoints consisting of three pharmacodynamics parameters (decrease in 
parabasal cells, increase in superficial cells, change in vaginal pH) and one clinical parameter (change 
in severity score of the vaginal clinical symptom self-assessed at 12 weeks via a questionnaire).  
Change in parabasal and superficial cell percentage was assessed using a 100-cell count to classify 
cells as superficial (S), intermediate (I) and parabasal (P) squamous cell types. Vaginal pH was 
measured by applying a pH indicator strip directly to the lateral wall of the vagina with a forceps. 
As secondary endpoints, sexual function as well as quality of life were evaluated at screening, day 1 
and weeks 4, 8 and 12 by the MENQOL, ASF, PGWB and SC questionnaires. 
The primary time point for analysis was the 12-week assessment. The change from baseline to each 
post-baseline assessment was calculated and used for statistical analysis for the comparison of each 
DHEA dose group to placebo; additionally, the significance of the change from baseline within each 
treatment group was also statistically assessed. 
Statistics: 
The dose-response analysis was carried out for each co-primary endpoints in the ITT population 
consisting in subjects presenting with a moderate to severe dyspareunia as the most bothersome 
Assessment report

symptom. This is the population of interest for the targeted indication. No dose-response analysis was 
performed in the per-protocol population. The statistical analysis was mainly based upon an analysis of 
variance adjusted on endpoint’s baseline, testing for the overall heterogeneity of the 4 treatment 
groups (including the placebo), followed by pairwise comparisons between each DHEA group and the 
placebo group. Adjustment for multiple testing was ensured by the Bonferroni type-1 error correction, 
taking into account the number of comparisons (x3) between DHEA doses and the placebo, but not the 
number of co-primary endpoints involved. It did not weakened though authors’ conclusion, most of p-
values associated DHEA vs placebo comparisons (3x4) in the primary analysis, being lower than 0.005.  
Results 
Study participants are white subjects, mean age of 58 years old, mean BMI of 26. No European subject 
was included. Proportion of subjects with prior HRT treatment is balanced in the groups. It should be 
confirmed that a proper wash-out procedure was respected for these subjects.  
Efficacy data: At the time interval of 2 weeks of treatment, no change was observed in the placebo 
group in the percentage of parabasal cells. In all DHEA groups, the following decreases were observed: 
28.6 ± 4.95 from 56.9 ± 5.54 to 28.3 ± 4.34 with the lowest dose of 3.25 mg  
37.1 ± 4.55 (from 58.8 ± 5.37 to 21.6 ± 3.47) with the dose of 6.5 mg and  
36.0 ± 4.91 (from 48.9 ± 5.46 to 12.9 ± 2.81) with the dose of 13 mg.  
At the standard duration of 12 weeks of treatment, decreases of 39.8 ± 5.33 (p<0.0001), 45.9 ± 5.31 
(p<0.0001) and 44.5 ± 5.19 (p<0.0001) were observed in the percentage of parabasal cells with the 
3.25 mg, 6.5 mg and 13 mg DHEA doses, respectively, while no change was observed on this 
parameter in the placebo group.  
Regarding the superficial cells, their percentage increased in a statistically significant manner at 2 
weeks in the groups 6.5 mg and 13 mg, but not in the DHEA group of 3.25 mg.  
At 12 weeks, increases of 4.3 ± 0.96 (from 0.7 ± 0.26 to 5.0 ± 0.90, p<0.0001), 6.8 ± 1.29 (from 0.5 
± 0.16 to 7.2 ± 1.29, p<0.0001) and 5.8 ± 1.13 (from 0.9 ± 0.24 to 6.7 ± 1.16 p<0.0001) were 
measured in the 3.25 mg, 6.5 mg and 13 mg of DHEA groups, respectively. No change was observed 
in the placebo group. 
Of note, the change in parabasal and superficial cell percentage was assessed by one cytopathologist 
blinded to the treatment regimen. There was no double assessment of this count performed to confirm 
the outcome. Thus, the reproducibility of the assessment is questionable.  
A statistically significant decrease was observed on the vaginal pH since 2 weeks (p<0.001) in the 3 
DHEA groups. At week 12 vaginal pH decreased by 1.1 ± 0.12 (p<0.0001) pH unit from 6.5 ± 0.09 
units, by 1.3 ± 0.13 (p<0.0001) from 6.6 ± 0.07 pH units, and by 1.4 ± 0.13 (p<0.0001) from 6.3 ± 
0.09 pH units in the 0.25%, 0.50% and 1.0% DHEA-treated groups, respectively, while no change was 
observed in the placebo group. 
Regarding the 4th co-primary endpoint, after 2 weeks of treatment, there was a significant change 
(decrease) observed in the severity score of most bothersome symptom regardless the type of 
symptom (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, irritation/itching) in all the treatment groups including 
placebo (decrease of 0.4, 0.6, 0.6 and 0.8 points versus baseline with the placebo, 3.25 mg, 6.5 mg 
and 13 mg, respectively).  
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 29/94 
  
  
Table  4:  Analysis  of  most  bothersome  symptom  at  week  12.  Change  from  Baseline  (ITT 
population) (study ERC–210) 
This decrease appears to be more time dependent than dose dependent. At week 12, the size effect on 
the clinical symptom (severity score) was larger in all DHEA treatment groups (decrease of 0.6, 1.2, 
1.5 and 1.3 points with the placebo, 3.25, 6.5 and 13 mg, respectively).  
Overall, this dose-finding study is supposed to identify the lowest effective dose having the most 
acceptable safety pattern. Results showed that at the standard 12-week time interval, for all co-
primary endpoints, a clear difference in responses between the 3 DHEA arms was observed versus the 
placebo arm, but no clear trend to higher response with higher dose was observed when considering 
only the 3 DHEA doses.  
There was no placebo effect at any time point on the PD parameters (parabasal and superficial cells, 
vaginal pH) while a clear placebo effect was observed at all the time points on the clinical symptom.  
There was no major difference in the safety pattern between the treatment groups. 
Based on the lack of marked difference between the doses 6.5 and 13 mg regarding the efficacy 
parameters, the dose of 13 mg was ruled out for the rest of the clinical studies.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The phase 3 programme consisted of two 12 weeks pivotal studies with similar design and objectives 
(ERC-231 and ERC–238). In addition, there were 2 supportive studies: one efficacy/safety study using 
a reduced regimen (ERC–234) and one open-label long term safety study conducted for 52 weeks 
(ERC-230). 
Pivotal study ERC–231: DHEA against Vaginal Atrophy (Placebo-Controlled, 
Double-Blind and Randomized Phase III Study of 3-Month Intravaginal 
DHEA).

•  Treatments 
This was a Phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind and randomized study to confirm the efficacy of 
daily intravaginal administration of a 0.25% (3.25 mg) DHEA and 0.50% (6.5 mg) DHEA suppositories 
for 12 weeks compared to placebo in postmenopausal women. Women were randomized between 3 
treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. The study was divided into two phases, namely a screening period of 
4 to 6 weeks followed by a treatment period of 12 weeks. 
Women were instructed to apply one intravaginal ovule (suppository, pessary) containing placebo (0 
%), 0.25% (3.25 mg) prasterone or 0.50% (6.5 mg) prasterone daily before bedtime (usually 
evening) during 12 weeks.

Figure 2: Study design ERC-231 
Clinical study ERC-210 had shown highly significant effects at the three doses used, namely daily 
intravaginal administration of 0.25%, 0.50% and 1.0% prasterone with no clear difference between 
the 0.50% and 1.0% doses on dyspareunia. It was thus decided to compare the 0.50% and 0.25% 
prasterone doses with placebo, thus being well below the 1.0% (13 mg) prasterone dose shown to 
maintain serum estradiol and testosterone below the threshold of biological activity. 
•  Objectives 
Primary objective was to confirm the efficacy of daily intravaginal administration of DHEA on the 
symptoms and signs of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women suffering from moderate to severe 
pain at sexual activity (dyspareunia) as their MBS of VVA at baseline.  
Secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy on arousal/lubrication, subjective arousal, desire, 
pain at sexual activity, satisfaction and orgasm using the female sexual function index (FSFI) 
questionnaire as well as to examine the tolerance to local administration of DHEA. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
In agreement with the FDA guidelines, the four co-primary endpoints compared to placebo are: 
1. A statistically significant decrease in percentage of parabasal cells. 
2. A statistically significant increase in percentage of superficial cells. 
3. A statistically significant decrease in vaginal pH. 
4. A statistically significant improvement of moderate to severe dyspareunia self-identified by subjects 
as the most bothersome VVA symptom to her at screening and at baseline (Day 1). 
Self-assessment of the other symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause were 
evaluated by a questionnaire but were not co-primary objectives: 
-  Vaginal dryness (none, mild, moderate or severe) and 
-  Vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching (none, mild, moderate or severe) 
Secondary efficacy variables included: dryness and irritation as symptoms of vaginal atrophy, 
observations at vaginal examination related to local tolerance to DHEA (vaginal secretions, vaginal 
epithelial integrity, vaginal epithelial surface thickness, vaginal color, menopause-specific quality of life 
questionnaire (MENQOL), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and safety variables, vital signs.  
In order to confirm that all sex steroids remained within the normal postmenopausal range following 
intravaginal administration of prasterone, serum concentrations of DHEA and its main metabolites 
(namely dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), testosterone (Testo), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 
androstenedione (4-dione), androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol (5-diol), estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), 
estrone sulfate (E1-S), androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G) and androstane-3α, 17β-diol 3- and 17-
glucuronide (3α-diol-3G and 3α-diol-17G)) were determined at baseline and at Week 12 (or at 
discontinuation visit, if applicable).

•  Statistical Methods and sample size 
Statistical analyses were performed at the two-sided significance level of 0.025 unless otherwise 
stated. The categories for summarization for the analysis of data from baseline through Week 12 
consist of the placebo, the 0.25% DHEA and the 0.50% DHEA treatment groups. The co-primary 
objectives analyzed are the changes in % of parabasal and superficial cells, vaginal pH and severity 
score of pain at sexual activity (dyspareunia). 
Sample size calculations for the 4 co-primary endpoints were based on the results of study ERC-210, 
where statistical significance was seen for all DHEA treatment groups (0.25%, 0.50% and 1.0% 
intravaginal ovule) compared to placebo for change from baseline to 12 weeks. The population of 
women used in this analysis consisted of those who satisfied the entry criterion of having moderate to

severe vaginal pain at intercourse as the MBS, at both the screening and baseline visits. The 0-3 
scores (in increasing severity) were analyzed as continuous data. 
Sample sizes per group would provide power of 95% for a t-test at a 2-sided significance level (alpha-
level) of 0.025 for each co-primary endpoint, to detect similar differences in the current study between 
the DHEA 0.50% and DHEA 0.25% treatment groups and placebo. Therefore, the maximum sample 
size over all 4 co-primary endpoints of 60 would be required per arm; to be conservative, and to 
provide increased safety data, a sample size of 70 subjects was planned to be enrolled in each DHEA 
arm and 70 in the placebo arm (accounting for drop-outs). 
Efficacy analyses were performed primarily on the Intent to Treat population (all subjects who have 
received at least one dose of study drug with a baseline (Day 1) evaluation meeting the entry criteria), 
with additional secondary analysis done on the Per-Protocol population. Safety analyses were 
performed on the Safety population (subjects who receive any amount of study treatment). 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were summarized and presented by treatment groups. 
The primary time point for analysis and data presentation is the 12-week assessment, with additional 
secondary presentations of the data at 6 weeks. The change from baseline (Day 1) to post-baseline 
assessments as well as differences from placebo was used for analysis. Analyses of differences 
between DHEA 0.25%, DHEA 0.50% and Placebo were performed using an analysis of covariance with 
baseline as the covariate. All available safety data were used for analysis. For adverse events and 
laboratory data, standard methods of analysis were used. 
•  Randomisation 
The randomization was done centrally. Treatment codes were generated using a permuted block 
design utilizing PROC PLAN of SAS. Blocks of 3 women were generated to ensure a balanced allocation 
to the three treatment arms by investigational site, with each block sequence randomly allocated. 
Treatment allocation follows the sequence configuration within each block with codes A, B and C 
denoting Placebo, 0.25% DHEA and 0.50% DHEA, respectively. This translates to a random allocation 
within each block with a 1:1:1 ratio for the 3 treatment arms.  
•  Blinding 
One (1) set of sealed envelopes identified with the medication number and containing information 
about the treatment (Placebo or DHEA containing medication) for each particular subject was 
prepared. The DHEA concentration (0.25% or 0.50%) was not documented on the form F-UCPO0230 
(EndoCeutics Code Breaking Notification Sheet). This set was kept at the trial site (during the entire 
trial period) and the randomization list was kept by the Sponsor. The trial site envelopes were returned 
to the Sponsor at study close-out using the form F-URC027. 
Results of the study ERC-231: 
•  Participants flow: 
464 subjects were screened and 255 were enrolled and randomized to this study. 222 subjects have 
completed the study. Among the 33 subjects who prematurely discontinued from study treatment, 
15 subjects discontinued early as they did not meet the inclusion criteria (vaginal maturation index, 
vaginal pH and/or vulvovaginal atrophy symptom). 
The ITT population (all subjects who have received at least one dose of study drug (based on diary) 
with a baseline (Day 1) evaluation meeting the entry criteria) is the primary analysis population of 
efficacy analyses and includes a total of 237 subjects with 77, 79 and 81 subjects in the placebo, 
0.25% and 0.50% prasterone groups, respectively. The ITT population is composed of postmenopausal 
women aged 58.84 ± 0.38 years (mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM)) and includes 93% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 35/94 
  
  
White Caucasian, 5% of Black or African American, 1% Asian and 1% other race while the ethnicity of 
94% of this population is not Hispanic or Latino. In this population, 63% had an hysterectomy and 
33% had undergone an ovariectomy prior to the study. 
The Per Protocol (PP) Population consists of a subset of 204 subjects of the ITT population that 
completed the study through the time points of 12 weeks with no major protocol violations considered 
to compromise efficacy data. Subjects in this population have received at least 90% of the required 
number of applications of study treatment, based on the subject diary data. The PP population is a 
supportive population for efficacy data analysis.

•  Recruitment 
The first subject first visit was on 30 November 2010 and the last subject last visit was on 29 July 
2011. The end of the study date was 30 January 2014. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviation 
There were a similar number of subjects with protocol deviations in each treatment group (8 – 9 
subjects per group). These deviations did not affect the integrity of the study data. The following table 
summarizes subjects with major protocol deviation. 
Table 6: Number of subjects with major protocol deviation (ERC–231) 
Three subjects were excluded from the ITT and PP analyses because they were enrolled in the study 
despite the fact that they did not meet Inclusion Criteria No. 2 (VVA) while two subjects were excluded 
from the ITT and PP analyses because they were enrolled in the study despite the fact that they did 
not meet Inclusion Criteria No. 5 (vaginal pH>5.0). 
The following deviations to inclusion/exclusion criteria and excluded concomitant treatments were not 
considered significant enough to warrant exclusion: 
Exclusion criterion No. 2: One subject (14-001) enrolled in the study had a prior history of melanoma. 
The site was instructed to terminate this subject but the subject could not be reached before she 
completed the study. The subject was included in the ITT and PP analyses. 
Exclusion criterion No.19: Contrary to Exclusion Criteria No. 19, subject 15-014 (placebo) was 
randomized despite the presence of an endometrial polyp at Screening. The subject was withdrawn 
from the study and included in the ITT analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 37/94 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exclusion criterion No.20: Vulvar lichen sclerosis was added as an exclusion criterion in the 07 March 
2011 version of the protocol. Subject 14-012 (0.50% DHEA) was enrolled in the study with active 
lichen sclerosis five days after the effective date of the protocol amendment. This may have brought a 
bias to the self-assessment of symptoms given the similarity of some symptoms like itching and 
irritation. It had no impact on subject safety. The subject was included in all statistical analysis (PP, 
ITT and Safety). 
Prohibited concomitant treatments 
Six subjects took an intravaginal product (antifungal medication or equivalent) during the study: 
subject 04-004 (placebo) took clotrimazole on Days 66 and 67, subject 05-025 (placebo) took 
miconazole 5 days prior to Day 1, subject 09-002 (0.50% DHEA) took miconazole cream at Week 12, 
subject 18-011 (placebo) took clotrimazole on Days 79 to 81 and subject 01-011 (0.25% DHEA) took 
petroleum jelly on Day 46. These deviations were not considered significant. Subject 12-006 (0.25% 
DHEA) was withdrawn from the study and included only in the safety analysis. Subjects 01-011, 09-
002 and 18-011 took the intravaginal products 48 hrs of a scheduled study visit so the MI, vaginal pH 
and vaginal observations data collected at those visits were considered invalid and they were replaced 
with the corresponding data from the previous visit in accordance with the SAP. 
Premature emergency unblindings at the study site:  
There were no premature unblindings in this study. 
•  Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics: 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the subjects enrolled in the different treatment 
groups were similar. The study population consisted mainly of White Caucasian non-Hispanic women. 
The proportion of White Caucasian women ranged from 86% (Placebo) to 95% (0.50% DHEA) per 
group. Black or African American women were the second most represented race with 3% (0.50% 
DHEA) to 11% (Placebo) of the women in each treatment group. Non-Hispanic women made up 90% 
(0.50% DHEA) to 99% (Placebo) of the women in each treatment group. Overall, the average age of 
the women enrolled in the study was 58.55 years with a median age of 59 and a range of 40 to 75 
years. Similar age distributions were observed in all three treatment groups. On average, the women 
measured 160.75 cm and weighed 67.49 kg with a BMI of 26.08. 
The women assigned to the different treatment groups had similar reproductive histories. An average 
of 14.47 years (13.88 [Placebo] to 15.47 [0.25% DHEA]) had elapsed between their last menses and 
their participation in this study. Menstrual cycles ceased naturally in approximately half the population 
(48% [Placebo] to 50% [0.25% DHEA]). The average age at which the women had their last menstrual 
period ranged from 47.42 [Placebo] to 49.05 [0.25% DHEA] years in women who had a natural 
menopause and from 38.68 [0.50% DHEA] to 42.69 [Placebo] in women who had a surgical 
menopause. 
•  Numbers analysed 
Overall, data corresponding to 237 subjects was analysed in the ITT set. Of them, 77 correspond to 
placebo group and 160 to DHEA groups.

•  Outcomes and estimations 
Vaginal Atrophy: 
Effect on parabasal cells: There was no effect of placebo on the percentage of parabasal cells in 
women from the ITT population treated with daily intravaginal placebo at week 12 of the treatment. 
Regarding DHEA groups; 
 
 
The 3.25 mg prasterone decreased the % of parabasal cells from 65.72 ± 4.56% at baseline to 
31.76 ± 3.78% at 6 weeks (p<0.0001 over placebo) and 28.43±3.62% at 12 weeks 
(p<0.0001 vs placebo).  
The 6.5 mg decreased the % of parabasal cells from 65.05 ± 4.63% at baseline to 
26.31 ± 3.38% (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 6 weeks and 17.65 ± 2.87% at 12 weeks 
(p<0.0001 vs placebo). 
Figure 4: Effect of prasterone on % of parabasal cells at 6 and 12 weeks (ITT, ERC–231) 
Five women of the ITT population had a pattern of sex steroids typical of women having taken 
estrogens (a situation most likely associated with a bias in the VVA data). An additional analysis of co-
primary endpoints and VVA symptoms was performed where these 5 subjects were excluded from the

ITT population analysis (corrected ITT population, cITT). Results showed no significant change versus 
initial ITT population.  
Effect on superficial cells: There was a slight increase in the % of superficial cells in the ITT placebo 
group of 77 women from 0.73 ± 0.15% at baseline to 1.13 ± 0.24% (p=0.028 versus baseline) and 
1.64 ± 0.33% (p=0.004 versus baseline) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively.  
Regarding DHEA groups; 
 
 
In the group of 79 women ITT population who received daily 3.25 mg prasterone, the % of 
superficial cells increased from 0.68 ± 0.13% at baseline to 4.33 ± 0.50 (p<0.0001 versus 
placebo) and 5.43 ± 0.57% (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively.  
In the ITT group of 81 women who received a daily dose of 6.5 mg prasterone, the % of 
superficial cells increased from 0.68 ± 0.12% at baseline to 5.11 ± 0.57% (p<0.0001 versus 
placebo) and 6.30 ± 0.59% (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively.

Similarly, in the group of 77 women of the corrected ITT population who received daily 3.25 mg, the % 
of superficial cells increased from 0.68 ± 0.14% at baseline to 4.42 ± 0.51 (p<0.0001 versus placebo) 
and 5.51 ± 0.58% (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. On the other hand, for 
the cITT group of 80 women who received a daily intravaginal dose of 6.5 mg (0.50%) prasterone, the 
% of superficial cells increased from 0.69 ± 0.12% at baseline to 5.15 ± 0.58% (p<0.0001 versus 
placebo) and 6.26 ± 0.60% (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. 
Effect on vaginal pH: A slight decrease was observed in the placebo group.  
Regarding the DHEA groups; 
 
 
with 3.25 mg prasterone, the pH decreased from 6.48 ± 0.07 pH units at baseline to 5.81 ± 
0.10 (p=0.0008 vs placebo) and 5.70 ± 0.11 (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 6 and 12 weeks, 
respectively. 
with 6.5 mg prasterone, the pH decreased from 6.47 ± 0.07 at baseline to 5.52 ± 0.10 
(p<0.0001 vs placebo) at 6 weeks and then to 5.43 ± 0.10 (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 12 
weeks.

Figure 6: Effect of prasterone on vaginal pH (ITT, study ERC–231) 
When the 5 women who had a pattern of sex steroids typical of women having taken estrogens were 
excluded from the analysis (cITT), the pH decreased, in women treated with the dose of 3.25 mg, from 
6.48 ± 0.07 pH at baseline to 5.81 ± 0.10 (p=0.0001 versus placebo) and 5.70 ± 0.11 (p<0.0001 
versus placebo) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. In the group of women treated daily with 6.5 mg, the 
pH decreased from 6.46 ± 0.07 at baseline to 5.52 ± 0.10 (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 6 weeks and 
then to 5.45 ± 0.10 (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 12 weeks. 
Effect on dyspareunia: Women were enrolled on the basis of having pain at sexual activity 
considered as most bothersome symptom. The self-reported symptom score takes the following 
values: none, mild, moderate or severe to be analyzed using values of 0, 1, 2 or 3, respectively. All 
subjects must have this symptom at screening and Day 1 graded as 2 or 3.  
In the placebo group, there was a decrease in the severity score of dyspareunia from 2.58 at baseline 
to 1.87 and 1.71 at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively (p<0.0001 versus baseline at both time intervals).  
 
 
At the 3.25 mg dose, the severity score of dyspareunia decreased from 2.56 at baseline to 
1.86 (NS versus placebo) and 1.54 (NS versus placebo) at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively.  
At the 6.5 mg dose, the severity score of dyspareunia decreased from 2.63 ± 0.05 at baseline 
to 1.63 ± 0.13 (p=0.066 versus placebo) and 1.36 ± 0.12 (p=0.013 versus placebo) at 6 and 
12 weeks, respectively. An improvement of 0.40 severity score unit was thus observed or a 
46% improvement over placebo (p=0.013 versus placebo). 
When the 5 women who had a pattern of sex steroids typical of women having taken estrogens were 
excluded (cITT), the severity score of dyspareunia in women (n=80) treated with 6.5 mg decreased 
from 2.63 ± 0.05 units at baseline to 1.64 ± 0.13 (p=0.0389 versus placebo) at 6 weeks and to 1.36 
± 0.12 (p=0.0069 versus placebo) at 12 weeks, thus showing lower p values (than in the ITT 
population analysis) at both 6 and 12 weeks due to the smaller improvement in the placebo group in 
the cITT analysis. In fact, by excluding 2 women showing a signature of estrogen intake from the ITT 
placebo group, the severity score decreased from 2.59 ± 0.06 units at baseline to 1.92 ± 0.12 and 
1.76 ± 0.11 at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively (p<0.0001 versus baseline) at both time intervals. Thus, 
the severity score improved by 0.44 unit following treatment with 0.50% DHEA for a 53% increase 
over placebo (p=0.007 over placebo).

Ancillary analyses 
Self-assessment of the other symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause were 
evaluated by a severity score questionnaire but were not co-primary objectives: 
-  Vaginal dryness (none, mild, moderate or severe) and 
-  Vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching (none, mild, moderate or severe)

In the ITT population of 237 women who had pain at sexual activity as moderate to severe and VVA, 
192 women also had MS vaginal dryness at baseline. 
The following figure shows that regarding vaginal dryness, the decrease in DHEA groups became 
statistically significant (versus placebo) at week 12 of the study. 
Figure 9: Effect of prasterone on vaginal dryness (ERC-231) 
Regarding irritation/itching, the number of women in the ITT population who had moderate to 
severe irritation/itching at baseline was small (23 in the placebo group and 25 at each dose of 
prasterone). At 12 weeks, in the ITT population the differences from placebo have shown p values of 
0.091 and 0.198, respectively, for the 0.25% and 0.50% doses at prasterone.  
Figure 10: Effect of prasterone on irritation/itching 
At each visit (baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks), the physician performed a vaginal examination with 
speculum to evaluate the severity of the four main signs of VVA (severity evaluated as none, mild,

moderate or severe and using the values 1, 2, 3 or 4 respectively, to calculate responses). These signs 
are vaginal secretions, vaginal epithelial integrity, vaginal epithelial surface thickness and vaginal 
color. 
For vaginal secretions, the difference from placebo was already significant for both doses of 
prasterone at 6 weeks. At 12 weeks, in the placebo group, the standard time interval, the score 
decreased from 2.78 ± 0.08 at baseline to 2.36 ± 0.08 (p<0.0001 versus baseline) at 12 weeks 
(15.1% difference). For the 0.25% dose, the score decreased from 2.81 ± 0.07 at baseline to 2.10 ± 
0.09 at Week 12 (p=0.016 versus placebo, 25.3% difference) while in the group receiving 0.50% 
prasterone, the severity score decreased from 2.83 ± 0.08 at baseline to 1.95 ± 0.08 (p=0.0002 
versus placebo, 31% decrease) at 12 weeks 
Figure 11: Effect of prasterone on vaginal secretions (ERC-231) 
For vaginal epithelial integrity, at Week 12 for the placebo group (n=77), the severity score improved 
from 2.58 ± 0.09 at baseline to 2.13 ± 0.09 at 12 weeks (p<0.0001 versus baseline, 17.4%). In the 
group of women receiving daily 0.25% prasterone intravaginally, the severity score decreased from 
2.57 ± 0.10 at baseline to 1.92 ± 0.09 at 12 weeks (p=0.076 versus placebo, 25.3% change). 
However, in the group of women treated with the daily 0.50% dose, the severity score decreased from 
2.57 ± 0.10 at baseline to 1.69 ± 0.09 at 12 weeks (p=0.0001 versus placebo, 34.2% change).

As a complementary estimate by Investigators blinded to the treatment received, the epithelium 
surface thickness has shown an improvement of the severity score from 2.91 ± 0.07 at baseline to 
2.57 ± 0.08 at 12 weeks (p<0.0001 versus baseline, -11.7%) in the placebo group. In the group of 
women who received 0.25% prasterone (n=79), the severity score of vaginal epithelial integrity 
decreased from 2.90 ± 0.08 at baseline to 2.32 ± 0.09 at Week 12 (p=0.0153 versus placebo, -
20.0%) while the score decreased from 2.89 ± 0.07 at baseline to 2.14 ± 0.08 at Week 12 in the 
group of women who received 0.50% prasterone (p<0.0001 versus placebo, -25.9%).

Concerning vaginal color in the placebo group, the score decreased from 2.82 ± 0.08 at baseline to 
2.56 ± 0.08 at 12 weeks (p=0.0003 versus baseline, 9.2% decrease). For the 79 women who received 
0.25% prasterone, the score related to vaginal color decreased from 2.94 ± 0.08 at baseline to 2.27 ±

decrease in the severity score (p<0.0001 versus placebo) was observed in the group of women 
receiving a daily dose of 0.50% prasterone with values decreasing from 2.94 ± 0.08 to 2.05 ± 0.09.

Methods: 
•  Study participants 
The subject population was postmenopausal women (non-hysterectomized or hysterectomized),

-  Treatments 
Clinical phase III study ERC-231 has compared the effect of 0.25% (3.25 mg) and 0.50% (6.5 mg) 
prasterone doses with placebo. The co-primary endpoints for analysis in that study were the change 
from baseline to Week 12 in pain at sexual activity (dyspareunia) as MBS at baseline, percentage of 
parabasal and superficial cells, and vaginal pH. In ERC-231, with the 3.25 mg (0.25%) dose of 
prasterone, statistical significance was not reached over placebo for one co-primary endpoint, namely 
dyspareunia, thus indicating that the appropriate prasterone dose was 6.5 mg (0.50%).  
The confirmatory efficacy study ERC-238 was then performed with the selected 6.5 mg (0.50%) 
prasterone dose. 
Women were randomized in a 2:1 ratio between the 0.50% DHEA and placebo DHEA groups as 
follows:

•  Objectives 
Primary objectives 
To confirm the efficacy of intravaginal DHEA on moderate to severe (MS) pain at sexual activity 
(dyspareunia) as most bothersome symptom (MBS) of VVA due to menopause and to collect further 
data on subjects exposed to intravaginal DHEA at the dose or dose range believed to be efficacious in 
order to meet the ICH E1 guideline requirement so that the "total number of individuals treated with 
the investigational drug, including short-term exposure, will be about 1500.” 
Secondary objectives 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Examine the tolerance to intravaginal administration of DHEA; 
Investigate a possible influence of treatment on the male partner; 
Evaluate the efficacy on the other two symptoms of VVA (dryness and irritation/itching); 
Evaluate  the  efficacy  on  arousal/lubrication,  subjective  arousal,  desire,  satisfaction  and  orgasm 
by  the  Female  Sexual  Function  Index  (FSFI)  questionnaire  according  to  the  indicated  priority 
design;  
Obtain information on the usability of the applicator used to insert the medication. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints: 
The four co-primary endpoints compared to placebo are: 
-  A statistically significant decrease in percentage of parabasal cells; 
-  A statistically significant increase in percentage of superficial cells; 
-  A statistically significant decrease in vaginal pH; and 
-  A  statistically  significant  improvement  of  moderate  to  severe  dyspareunia  self-identified  by 
subjects as the most bothersome VVA symptom to her at screening and at baseline (Day 1). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
Self-assessment of the other symptoms of VVA associated with menopause were evaluated by a 
questionnaire but were not co-primary objectives: 
•  Vaginal dryness (none, mild, moderate or severe); and 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 50/94 
  
  
 
 
 
 
•  Vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching (none, mild, moderate or severe) 
Other secondary efficacy variables included: observations at vaginal examinations, local tolerance, 
Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI).

Table 9: Schedule of the procedures (study ERC–238). 
•  Statistical methods and sample size 
Sample size calculation was based on the results from study ERC-231 using values of DHEA 0.50% 
versus placebo. 
The sample size which would be the maximum required for all 4 efficacy parameters for the DHEA to 
placebo comparison at a 2:1 ratio of DHEA:placebo would be 274 and 137, respectively, based on the 
endpoint of dyspareunia in the DHEA and placebo groups. An allowance of 15% for not completing the 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 52/94 
  
  
 
 
 
study was added, resulting in n=322:161 for the DHEA:placebo groups. The sample size of 322 DHEA-
treated subjects also permitted to achieve the total number of 1500 subjects exposed to intravaginal 
DHEA across all studies, as requested by the ICH E1 guideline. The power for pH, superficial cells and 
parabasal cells would be > 99.99%, therefore the overall power for all 4 endpoints (calculated as the 
product of the power for each of the 4 endpoints) would be > 97%. 
The sample size required to detect these same differences between DHEA and placebo in the current 
study ERC-238, at a one-sided alpha-level of 0.025 and power of 97.7%, are provided in the table 
below. 
Table 10: Power calculation based on ERC–231 (change from baseline to week 12). 
•  Randomisation 
The randomization was done centrally. Treatment codes were generated using a permuted block 
design utilizing PROC PLAN of Statistical Analysis System (SAS). Taking into account the 2:1 ratio 
between the DHEA group (group B) and the placebo group (group A), in order to keep the blind at 
each investigational site, two different lots of DHEA were used and were identified as B1 and B2. 
Blocks of 3 women (A, B1 and B2) were then generated to ensure a balanced allocation by 
investigational site between the treatment arms DHEA and placebo, in the corresponding 2:1 ratio, 
with each block sequence randomly allocated.  
•  Blinding 
One (1) sealed envelope identified with the medication number and containing information about the 
treatment (Placebo or DHEA containing medication) for each particular subject was prepared. The 
envelope was kept at the trial site (during the entire trial period) and the randomization list was kept 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 53/94 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
by the Sponsor. The trial site envelopes were returned to the Sponsor at the end of the study using the 
appropriate form. 
The blind has not been broken for any subject during the course of this study. 
Results: 
•  Participants flow 
A total of 1226 postmenopausal women were screened and 558 subjects were enrolled and randomized 
to this study in a 2:1 ratio. A total of 527 subjects (94%) have completed the study (DHEA = 356 and 
Placebo = 171). 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which consists of all subjects who have received at least one dose 
of study drug (based on the diary card) with a baseline (Day 1) evaluation meeting the study entry 
criteria, is the primary analysis population of efficacy analyses and includes a total of 482 subjects with 
157 and 325 women in the placebo and 0.50% DHEA (prasterone) groups, respectively. 
The Per Protocol (PP) Population consists of a subset of 373 subjects (DHEA = 254 and Placebo = 119) 
of the ITT population that completed the study through the time point of 12 weeks with no major 
protocol violations considered to compromise efficacy data. Subjects in this population have received 
at least 90% of the required number of applications of study treatment, based on the subject diary 
data and they have valid data entry at Week 12 for the 4 co-primary efficacy endpoints (superficial and 
parabasal cells, pH and pain at sexual activity).

In the placebo and the 0.50% DHEA groups, there were respectively 11 (6.0%) and 35 (9.3%) 
subjects with major protocol deviations. These deviations did not affect the integrity of the study data.  
Table 12: Number of the subjects with major protocol deviations (ERC-238) 
Prohibited Concomitant Treatments 
Six subjects took intravaginal products after Day 1: 
Four subjects took vaginal lubricants.  
One subject used Monistat Cream to treat a vaginal yeast infection.  
Another subject used Terazol 0.4% intra-vaginal cream to treat a vaginitis.  
These deviations were not considered to have impact on study data because they were used punctually 
and not within 48 hours of any scheduled visit and study procedures. 
•  Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics: 
The demographics and baseline characteristics of the subjects enrolled in the two treatment groups 
were similar.

•  Numbers analysed 
The ITT population set contains data from 157 subjects exposed to the placebo and 325 subjects 
exposed to DHEA 6.5 mg. The treatment duration was 12 weeks. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy variables: 
Effect on parabasal cells: There was a slight effect of intravaginal placebo on the percentage of 
parabasal cells. At baseline, percentage of parabasal cells was 51.66 ± 3.00%, and decreased to: 
 
 
42.35 ± 2.73% (p<0.0001 versus baseline) at week 6 
39.68 ± 2.68% (p<0.0001 versus baseline) at week 12  
With  the  daily  6.5  mg  (0.50%)  intravaginal  prasterone,  the  %  of  parabasal  cells  decreased  from 
54.25 ± 2.14% at baseline to:  
  14.72 ± 1.09% (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 6 weeks  
  12.74 ± 1.02% (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 12 weeks

Figure 16: Effect of prasterone on percentage of parabasal cells (ERC-238) 
Effect on superficial cells: Percentage of superficial cells increased slightly in the ITT placebo group 
of 157 women from 1.04 ± 0.11% at baseline to: 
  2.60 ± 0.27% (p<0.0001 versus baseline) at week 6 
  2.78 ± 0.27% (p<0.0001 versus baseline) at week 12 
In the group who received daily 6.5 mg prasterone, the % of superficial cells increased from 1.02 ± 
0.08% at baseline to: 
  11.71 ± 0.61% (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at week 6 
  11.22 ± 0.56% (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at week 12

Effect on vaginal pH: A relatively small decrease was observed in the placebo group. Vagina pH 
decreased from 6.32 ± 0.05 pH units at baseline to: 
  6.06 ± 0.07 (p<0.0001 versus baseline) at 6 weeks 
  6.05 ± 0.07 (p<0.0001 versus baseline) at 12 weeks 
In the dose group of 6.5 mg prasterone, the pH decreased from 6.34 ± 0.04 at baseline to:  
  5.47 ± 0.05 (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 6 weeks  
  5.39 ± 0.05 (p<0.0001 versus placebo) at 12 weeks

Effect on dyspareunia (as MBS): In the ITT placebo group, (N=157), the severity score of 
dyspareunia decreased from 2.56 ± 0.04 units at baseline to 1.61 ± 0.08 at 6 weeks and 1.50 ± 0.08 
unit at 6 and 12 weeks, (p<0.0001 versus baseline at both time intervals).  
With the daily 6.5 mg (0.50%) prasterone dose (N=325), the severity score of dyspareunia decreased 
from 2.54 ± 0.03 units at baseline to: 
  1.41 ± 0.06 (p=0.036 versus placebo) at 6 weeks 
  1.13 ± 0.05 (p=0.0002 versus placebo) at 12 weeks 
An improvement of 0.35 point in the severity score unit was thus observed or a 33% improvement 
over placebo (p=0.0002 versus placebo).

It was expected, based on inclusion criterion no. 6, that subjects would have sexual activity at least 
once during the 12-week treatment and evaluation period. However, it has happened that 14 and 20 
women in the placebo and DHEA groups, respectively, have not engaged in sexual activity after Day 1. 
In order to examine unbiased data for the co-primary endpoint dyspareunia, an additional analysis was 
performed on a modified ITT (mITT) composed of women from the ITT population who had post-
baseline sexual activity at least once before evaluation of dyspareunia. Data obtained from the mITT 
population were very similar to those of the ITT population, with an improvement of dyspareunia 
following DHEA treatment (N=305) of 0.34 severity score unit over placebo (N=143; p=0.0003 versus 
placebo). 
Secondary efficacy variables 
Moderate to severe vaginal dryness 
The severity score of vaginal dryness in the ITT population decreased from 2.30 ± 0.04 units at 
baseline in the placebo group to: 
  1.13 ± 0.08 at 6 weeks, (p<0.0001 vs baseline) 
  1.13 ± 0.08 unit at 12 weeks (p<0.0001 versus baseline)  
In women treated with daily 6.5 mg prasterone group the severity score of vaginal dryness decreased 
from 2.30 ± 0.03 units at baseline to: 
  1.05 ± 0.05 (p=0.3984 versus placebo) at 6 weeks  
  0.86 ± 0.05 unit (p=0.004 versus placebo) at 12 weeks  
The improvement over placebo was 0.27 severity score unit at 12 weeks or 23% (p=0.004 versus 
placebo), an effect similar to that observed on MBS dyspareunia in the same ITT population where the 
improvement of MBS dyspareunia was 0.35 severity score unit or 33% over placebo (p=0.0002 versus 
placebo).

Other efficacy findings: 
The FSFI questionnaire was filled at baseline, Week 6 and Week 12. The FSFI domain desire increased 
over placebo by 0.24 unit (+49.0%, p=0.0105), arousal by 0.42 unit (+56.8%, p=0.0022), lubrication 
by 0.57 unit (+36.1%, p=0.0005), orgasm by 0.32 unit (+33.0%, p=0.047), satisfaction by 0.44 unit 
(+48.3%, p=0.0012) and pain at sexual activity by 0.62 unit (+39.2%, p=0.001). The total FSFI 
score, on the other hand, has shown a superiority of 2.59 units in the DHEA group over placebo or a 
41.3% greater change than placebo (p=0.0006) over placebo. The present data on the FSFI show a 
33.0% (orgasm, p=0.047) to 56.8% (arousal, p=0.0022) increase over placebo in all the six domains 
of the FSFI, thus confirming the previous benefits of intravaginal DHEA on female sexual dysfunction 
by an action exerted exclusively at the level of the vagina.

Notes 
p-value 
<0.0001  
For dyspareunia = 0.0002 
The placebo effect at week 12 was more important than expected in 
particular on the PD endpoints.  
A clear placebo effect on dyspareunia was observed at week 12. The 
clinical relevance of the DHEA effect over placebo is unknown. 
Overall,  the  results  are  comparable  to  those  obtained  with  the 
ERC-231 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
N/A 
Clinical studies in special populations 
In this application, the target population is postmenopausal women with VVA. No clinical studies were 
performed in special population. Based on the inclusion criteria of the phase III clinical studies, 
subjects enrolled are postmenopausal women with VVA aged from 40 and 75-80 years old. This 
represents a large population of postmenopausal women. Inside this population, no difference is made 
with regard to any specific age range.  
The following subgroup analyses (Forest plots) were requested at day 120 of the procedure for the 4 
co-primary endpoints: Canada and USA, BMI =< 25 and BMI > 25, Age =< 55 and age > 55, duration 
of menopause (1-2 y, 2-5y and >5y). Results show no noticeable treatment effect differences between 
investigated subgroups, except for the duration of menopause. It seems that women with 1-2y 
menopause could benefit more of prasterone compared to other subgroups (3-5y, >=6y); however, 
this discrepancy could also be explained by the small size of the 1-2y subgroup (33 subjects vs 86 in 
3-5y and 521 in >=6y) rather than a true interaction effect across subgroups. 
Supportive study(ies) 
Study ERC-234 was a phase III efficacy and safety study where two doses of DHEA were compared to 
placebo using an administration regimen different from the pivotal studies ERC-231 and ERC-238. 
Indeed, in this study, treatment was administrated intravaginally once daily during 2 weeks then 
biweekly during 10 weeks and time points for assessment of efficacy variables were week 2, 6 and 12. 
Decrease in dyspareunia severity score was the clinical co-primary endpoint in the mentioned pivotal 
studies ERC-231 and 238, while the decrease in vaginal dryness severity score was the clinical co-
primary endpoint in this study ERC-234 considered as supportive.  
Apart from these two differences, the study design and inclusion/exclusion criteria were similar to the 
pivotal studies ERC-231 and 238. Here also, the study was conducted in Canada and USA and no 
European subjects were included. Thus, the extrapolation of the findings to European population is 
questionable given the cultural dimension of menopause and sexual activities.  
No active control group (local oestrogens) was included in the study design. Comparison was 
performed versus placebo.

15 women of the ITT population had a pattern of sex steroids typical of women having taken estrogens 
(a situation most likely associated with a bias in the data). These subjects were excluded from the 
corrected ITT population set. Analysis of efficacy endpoints was performed on ITT and corrected ITT 
population including 132 subjects who received placebo, 127 subjects who received DHEA 3.25 mg and 
133 who received DHEA 6.5 mg.  
Results showed that the effect on PD parameters (percentage of parabasal cells, superficial cells and 
vaginal pH) was maximal at 2 weeks with a loss in efficacy at further time intervals. This is due to the 
reduced regimen after 2 weeks of daily administration.  
With regard to vaginal dryness considered as the most bothersome symptom in this study (clinical co-
primary endpoint), with 3.25 mg DHEA, the severity score in ITT population decreased from 2.37 ± 
0.04 at baseline to 1.06 ± 0.07 at 6 weeks (p=0.02 versus placebo) and then increased slightly to 
1.10 ± 0.07 (p=0.108 versus placebo) at 12 weeks. In the 6.5 mg DHEA, the severity score decreased 
from a value of 2.35 ± 0.04 at baseline to 1.12 ± 0.07 (p=0.090 versus placebo) at 6 weeks and then 
to 1.13 ± 0.08 (p=0.198 versus placebo) at 12 weeks.  
In conclusion based on this supportive study outcome, the reduced regimen (twice weekly; 3.25 mg 
and 6.5 mg) is associated with a loss in efficacy on all co primary endpoints, with results on vaginal 
dryness at week 12 being not statistically different from placebo. Thus, this reduced regimen was ruled 
out.  
Study ERC–230 was a phase III multi-center open label safety study of 52 weeks performed to 
assess the long term safety of intravaginal 6.5 mg DHEA. 
This study was performed in USA and Canada. The study was divided into 2 phases, namely a 
screening period up to 6 weeks followed by a treatment period of 12 months. Subject population to be 
studied was postmenopausal women (non-hysterectomized), between 40 and 75 years of age having 
self-identified at least mild to severe vaginal dryness or vaginal or vulvar irritation, or vaginal pain at 
sexual activity. Overall, 530 subjects were enrolled and a total of 487 women were part of the 
population for evaluation of efficacy. Efficacy variables were part of the secondary objectives. Analysis 
of efficacy outcomes showed that the effect on MS dyspareunia, MS vaginal dryness and MS 
irritation/itching is the same whether each MS symptom is considered MBS or not MBS by the women. 
Limited improvement in the severity scores of dyspareunia, vaginal dryness and irritation/itching is 
observed when daily intravaginal administration of 0.50% prasterone is extended from 12 weeks to 52 
weeks. In fact, 19.4%, 15.1% and 6.5% of the 52-week effect was obtained for MS dyspareunia, MS 
vaginal dryness and MS irritation/itching between Week 12 and Week 52 of treatment. 
The similar and parallel effects of prasterone treatment on dyspareunia, dryness and irritation/itching 
strongly suggest that prasterone is acting directly on the cause(s) of VVA itself while the changes 
observed on the symptoms are secondary to the improvement of the VVA pathology. 
In conclusion, from this long term non comparative open-label safety study, analysis of efficacy 
outcomes as secondary endpoints showed an improvement versus baseline in each efficacy criteria 
until week 26 of the treatment and a maintenance of this effect from week 26 to week 52 of the 
treatment. In other words, there is no loss on efficacy after 26 weeks of treatment.  
No additional conclusion can be drawn from this long term study with regard to efficacy parameters.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical study (ERC–210)  
The primary objective was to determine the dose-response of vaginal mucosa parameters to the local 
action of DHEA in postmenopausal women with vaginal atrophy. The treatment groups were placebo 
and 3 DHEA doses: 0.25% (3.25 mg), 0.5% (6.5 mg) or 1.0% (13 mg). The Applicant considered this 
study as a phase III study. However, given the limited population size and the study objective, it 
should be considered as a phase II dose-response (supportive) study. 
There were four co-primary endpoints consisting of three pharmacodynamics parameters (decrease in 
parabasal cells, increase in superficial cells, change in vaginal pH) and one clinical parameter (change 
in severity score of the vaginal clinical symptom self-assessed at 12 weeks via a questionnaire). 
Change in parabasal and superficial cell percentage was assessed using a 100-cell count to classify 
cells as superficial (S), intermediate (I) and parabasal (P) squamous cell types. Vaginal pH was 
measured by applying a pH indicator strip directly to the lateral wall of the vagina with a forceps. 
As secondary endpoints, sexual function as well as quality of life were evaluated at screening, day 1 
and weeks 4, 8 and 12 by the MENQOL, ASF, PGWB and SC questionnaires. 
The primary time point for analysis was the 12-week assessment. The change from baseline to each 
post-baseline assessment was calculated and used for statistical analysis for the comparison of each 
DHEA dose group to placebo; additionally, the significance of the change from baseline within each 
treatment group was also statistically assessed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses (ERC–210) 
This dose-finding study was intended to identify the lowest effective dose having the most acceptable 
safety pattern. Results showed that at the standard 12-week time interval, for all co-primary 
endpoints, a clear difference in responses between the 3 DHEA arms was observed versus the placebo 
arm, but no clear trend to higher response with higher dose was observed when considering only the 3 
DHEA doses.  
In this study there was no placebo effect at any time point on the PD parameters (parabasal and 
superficial cells, vaginal pH) while a clear placebo effect was observed at all the time points on the 
clinical symptoms.  
Based on the lack of marked difference between the doses 6.5 and 13 mg regarding the efficacy 
parameters, the dose of 13 mg was ruled out for the rest of the clinical studies.  
Design and conduct of clinical study (Pivotal study ERC-231) 
This was a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized study to confirm the efficacy of daily 
intravaginal administration of a 0.25% (3.25 mg) DHEA and 0.50% (6.5 mg) DHEA vaginal 
suppositories (pessaries) for 12 weeks compared to placebo in postmenopausal women. 
Although local oestrogens are considered as a “standard” treatment of VVA in postmenopausal women, 
DHEA was only compared to placebo and no active comparator group was included. The lack of such 
comparator was not justified with robust arguments. Indeed, the use of active comparator group was 
recommended during SA discussion at EMA and at national level. Instead, the Applicant provided 
further to day 120 of the procedure an indirect comparison between prasterone, Vagifem 10 µg and 
conjugated estrogens (vaginal administration) and comparison showed a trend to comparable efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 67/94 
  
  
No safety data are available. On PK level, an increase was noted in serum E2 levels after 83 days 
treatment of 4.64 and 9.41 pg/ml, respectively, for the 10 µg and 25 µg estradiol doses (Vagifem). 
Regarding the change in mean Estradiol, Estrone & Estrone-sulphate in the treatment groups in the 
principal studies (prasterone): Estradiol mean levels were 4.2 pg/ml range for the 0.5% (6.5 mg) 
prasterone dose. Mean Estrone levels increased by 1.9 pg/ml to 19 pg/ml after 12 weeks treatment. 
Estrone-sulphate levels increased by 20.1 pg/ml to 241pg/ml. These ranges are within those in the 
published literature. 
Therefore the levels of estradiol, estrone & estrone-sulphate after 12 weeks treatment with prasterone 
are comparable to treatment with 10 µg of vaginal estradiol Vagifem. 
The claimed indication is considered large with regard to the population enrolled in the phase III 
pivotal trials; indeed, some categories of subjects were excluded from the clinical study without clear 
rational (e.g. subjects with previous diagnosis of cancer - except skin-, thromboembolic disease, 
uncontrolled diabetes mellitus). Thus, the lack of information regarding the exposure of these subjects 
has been addressed in the product information.  
The four co-primary endpoints are: decrease in percentage of parabasal cells, increase in percentage 
of superficial cells, decrease in vaginal pH, improvement in dyspareunia self-identified by subjects as 
the most bothersome VVA symptom to her at screening and at baseline (Day 1). 
Of note, change in percentage of superficial and parabasal cells was examined on vaginal smears by an 
experienced cytopathologist blinded to the treatment regimens. A 100-cell count was performed to 
classify cells as parabasal, intermediate and superficial squamous cell types. Given the lack of a second 
confirmatory assessment by another cytopathologist, the reproducibility of the results (cell count) is 
questioned.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses (ERC–231) 
This study was conducted in Canada and in USA; no European women were included. Given the 
cultural dimension related to menopause and sexual activities, comparability between Canadian/US 
women and European women is questioned as well as the validity of extrapolation of the results 
obtained with studies having included only North American subjects.  
At 12 weeks, a dose–dependent effect on percentage of parabasal cells, superficial cells and level of 
vaginal pH was observed in both dose groups (3.25 mg and 6.5 mg). Both doses had highly significant 
effect versus placebo. No placebo effect was observed on these PD parameters in study ERC-231.  
Regarding the 4th co-primary endpoint considered as the only clinical parameter (improvement in the 
severity score of dyspareunia considered by the subjects as the most bothersome symptom), this 
parameter was self-assessed at predefined time points via a questionnaire, leading to a severity score 
from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Of note, validation of the questionnaire was not provided in the dossier. 
At week 12, there was a placebo effect observed: a decrease in the dyspareunia severity score from a 
mean baseline value of 2.58 to 1.71 (-0.87 point).  
The decrease of severity score in the DHEA group of 3.25 mg was from 2.56 to 1.54 (-1.01) and with 
the DHEA 6.5 mg, from 2.63 to 1.36 (-1.27). In this study, the percentages of subjects with an 
improvement in their dyspareunia symptom at week 12 (improvement, substantial improvement, 
relief) were not statistically different between placebo and Intrarosa groups.  
Also, there is no information on frequency of intercourse in the efficacy population set. Indeed, women 
with VVA could be enrolled if they declared having sexual activity at least once a month. However, 
frequency of intercourse is an important parameter with regard to the clinical endpoint (dyspareunia).  
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 68/94 
  
  
Design and conduct of clinical study (Pivotal study ERC-238) 
This was a (larger) phase III double-blind placebo-controlled study aimed to confirm the efficacy and 
safety outcomes obtained in the ERC-231 and to have sufficient exposure to DHEA, in line with the 
requirement of ICH E1 (exposure of at least 1500 subjects given the non-rare, non-life threatening 
disease).  
Study design, population characteristics and treatment duration were similar to the study ERC-231. 
However, only one DHEA dose (6.5 mg) was compared to the placebo. No active comparator group 
was included and this despite the scientific advice recommendation. 
The study was also conducted in Canada and US and extrapolation of the findings to European 
population is also questioned given the cultural dimension of questions related to menopause and 
sexual activities.  
Subjects enrolled were postmenopausal women from 40 to 80 years old having VVA and having 
identified moderate to severe dyspareunia as most bothersome symptom.  
A total of 558 subjects were enrolled and randomized to this study in a 2:1 ratio. The analysis of the 
primary endpoints was performed on ITT population composed of 325 subjects in the DHEA group and 
157 in the placebo group. The compliance of subjects with regard to the number of treatment doses 
provided are not clear. Anyway, these data do not jeopardize the overall study outcomes as supported 
by the ITT former analysis and the randomized analysis newly provided by the Applicant, which take 
into account these protocol deviations. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses (ERC–238) 
The study was conducted in USA and Canada and no European subjects were included. As for the 
pivotal study ERC–231, the extrapolation of findings to European population is questionable, given the 
cultural dimension of questions related to menopause and sexual activities.  
At week 12, there was a slight placebo effect on decrease in percentage of parabasal cells (-11.98% vs 
baseline) and increase in percentage of superficial cells (+1.75% vs baseline) and decrease in vaginal 
pH was -0.27. Surprisingly, this placebo effect on the aforementioned PD parameters was more 
important than the effect expected, based on the study ERC-231. The Applicant has no supported 
explanation of this difference.  
With the daily DHEA 6.5 mg, the effect on PD parameters (at 12 weeks) was as follows: decrease in % 
of parabasal cells of -41.51 (p<0.0001 versus placebo), increase in % of superficial cells of + 10.20 
(p<0.0001 versus placebo) and decrease in vaginal pH of -0.94 point.  
Regarding dyspareunia (4th co-primary endpoint), a placebo effect was observed at week 12 with a 
decrease from baseline of 1.06 in the severity score. With the 6.5 mg of DHEA, the decrease in 
dyspareunia severity score of 1.42 point was observed, thus, 0.35 point over placebo. The clinical 
relevance of this difference over placebo is unknown.  
This placebo effect is likely to be related to the vehicle effect on the vaginal epithelium, leading to a 
relief in some clinical parameters like dyspareunia (lubricant-like effect).  
Results obtained on vaginal dryness (secondary endpoint) were comparable to those obtained on 
dyspareunia. At 12 weeks, the decrease in vaginal dryness severity score versus baseline became 
higher with DHEA: 0.27 point over placebo. Here also, the clinical relevance of this difference over 
placebo is unknown. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 69/94 
  
  
Also, the frequency of intercourse in the efficacy population is unknown. The change in number of 
intercourses before treatment/after treatment is not available. This parameter is important given the 
clinical endpoint (dyspareunia).  
As a conclusion, ERC-238 was a pivotal clinical study which included a larger population than ERC-231 
and had a comparable design and similar treatment duration than ERC–231. Efficacy results obtained 
at week 12 are in line with those obtained with the ERC-231. The size effect observed with placebo was 
more important than expected in this study.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
To select the optimal DHEA daily dose for the claimed indication (treatment of VVA in post-menopausal 
women), a dose–response study was conducted comparing the efficacy and safety outcomes of 4 DHEA 
doses: 0 mg (placebo), 3.25 mg, 6.5 mg and 13 mg. At the standard 12-week time interval, there was 
a difference in responses to all co-primary endpoints between the 3 DHEA arms and the placebo arm, 
but no clear trend to higher response with higher dose when considering only the 3 DHEA doses. Also, 
analysis of the 4th co-primary endpoint (dyspareunia) showed a clear placebo effect likely to be related 
to the excipients. There was no major difference in the safety pattern between the dose treatment 
groups.  
The DHEA efficacy profile is based on two placebo-controlled phase III studies. Although local 
oestrogens are the “standard” VVA treatment in this population (postmenopausal women), no active 
comparator group was included in the study design and this point was not sufficiently justified. From 
the main pivotal studies ERC-231 and ERC-238, a slight placebo effect was observed on the PD 
endpoints (parabasal and superficial cell, vaginal pH). However, this placebo effect was more important 
than expected in the study ERC-238 compared to ERC-231. Regarding the 4th co primary outcome 
which is the clinical parameter in both phase III studies (dyspareunia), there was a clear improvement 
of this parameter (decrease in severity score of dyspareunia) with the placebo at the end of treatment 
period compared to baseline in both studies. This placebo effect on dyspareunia is probably related to 
the excipients (lubricant-like). Although the change versus baseline in the DHEA group was more 
important than the change versus baseline in the placebo group, the clinical relevance of this effect 
over placebo is unknown. Also, the frequency of intercourse in the efficacy population is unknown.  
The phase III pivotal studies ERC–231 and ERC-238 were conducted in Canada and in USA. There were 
no European women exposed to the drug. Given the cultural dimension related to menopause and 
sexual activities, comparability between Canadian/US women and European women can be questioned 
as a different perception of the benefit in European women cannot be excluded. 
Overall, clinical efficacy as demonstrated in the clinical trials was modest. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Subject exposure 
The safety population consisted of 1,542 women exposed to the 0.25%, 0.50% or 1.0% intravaginal 
DHEA doses in studies ERC-210, ERC-213, ERC-230, ERC-231, ERC-234 and ERC-238 and 474 women 
who have received placebo. There were 1,196 women exposed to the 0.5% dose including 435 women 
exposed up to 52 weeks. Of note, more than 300 biopsies were available after week 52 to assess 
endometrial safety. Overall, regarding the number of subjects exposed, the applicant respected the 
requirement from ICH–E1 population exposure in clinical trials.  
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 70/94 
  
  
Overall, the average age of the women enrolled in the safety population was 58.6 years with a median 
age of 58 years and a range of 40 to 80 years. Similar age distributions were observed in all the 
treatment groups. On average, the women measured 160.6 cm and weighed 68.2 kg with a BMI of 
26.4. Similar BMI were observed between groups.  
The women assigned to the different treatment groups had similar reproductive histories except for 
surgical history. In the 6.5 mg DHEA group, less women were hysterectomized or ovariectomized 
compared to placebo. This difference may be explained by the inclusion criteria of the Study ERC-230 
(6.5 mg DHEA) that include only non-hysterectomized postmenopausal women. An average of 11.9 
years (13.2 [Placebo] and 11.4 [0.50% DHEA]) have elapsed since their last menses. Menstrual cycles 
ceased naturally in more than half the population (61.4% [Placebo] and 78.3% [0.50% DHEA]). The 
average age at which the women in all treatment groups had their last menstrual period was 46.7 
[49.1 years in women who had a natural menopause and 39.7 years in women who had a surgical 
menopause]. The mean age at menopause is lower than the expected average even in the group with 
natural menopause.  
As Prasterone’s metabolites are mainly androgens (see laboratory findings) which could have an 
action on cardiovascular system and oestrogens (to a lesser degree) which could be involved in 
thromboembolic events and development of hormonal cancers, women with history of 
thromboembolic accident, cancer (including hormonal cancer), cardiac failure or coronary heart disease 
and hypertension (>140/90 mmHg) were excluded from the studies. Thus, women with cardiovascular 
risk or cancer history or with gynaecological abnormalities have not been studied.  
Similarly, subjects’ concomitant medications excluded any form of hormonal replacement therapy 
(oral, implants, vaginal cream, pessary, transdermal, rings, gels, tablets, pellet, injectable, 
intrauterine) including contraceptives, as well as androgens and anabolic steroids products. 
Approximately 50 % of subjects across all groups had been treated with previous hormonal therapy. 
Adverse events 
The applicant submitted pooled data of all AEs reported during clinical trials. Only treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) reported up to week 16 were analysed in the summary of safety. A TEAEs is 
defined as AEs that started or worsened after the first dose administration through 30 days after the 
last dose of study treatment. Applicant provided a summary table with the most frequent TEAEs 
(>1%) by treatment group up to 52 weeks. The presentation of TEAEs by age and by treatment group 
does not reveal differences in TEAEs incidence between age-class. 
Half of the subjects in the safety population experienced at least one TEAE of any nature with 
frequencies ranging from 47.7% (placebo) to 64.1% (1.0% DHEA) of subjects. According to the 
Investigator’s assessment, the majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. 
The assessment focused mainly on women treated with the dose of 6.5 mg of DHEA.  
Up to week 52, the most frequent TEAEs belong to the following MedDRA SOC (incidence in treatment 
arm 6.5 mg > placebo): 
Infection and infestation (27.7 vs 16.9%): mainly urinary tract infection  
• 
•  Reproductive  and  breast  disorders  (18.0  vs  12.4%):  mainly  cervical  dysplasia  and 
vaginal discharge 
•  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (11.9  vs  6.5%):  mainly 
application site discharge 
Investigations (9.3 vs 4.0%): mainly weight increase or decrease 
• 
•  Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders  (6.9  vs  3.2%):  mainly  acne,  erythema, 
hypertrichosis

Application site/Vaginal discharge and urinary tract infection (UTI) were frequently reported, with 
respective incidence of 11% and 7.4%. The Applicant clarified the cause of UTI which were from fecal 
flora origin rather than skin or insertion technique. According to the Applicant, the cause of the 
application site/vaginal discharge is due to an increase in physiological discharge due to the improved 
pH & estrogenic status of the vaginal cells in women treated, in addition to the effect of liquid hard fat 
excipient. It was not due to infection.  
The incidence of TEAEs by period of 3 months is only available for ERC-230 study. The following TEAEs 
were more frequent during the 16 first weeks: “application site discharge” and “hot flush”. On the 
contrary, “cervical dysplasia” (MedDRA term) occurred more frequently at the end of treatment (44-46 
weeks). 
Regarding long-term data, TEAEs observed up to week 52 are globally the same than those observed 
at week 16. However, several serious AEs occurred during ERC-230 (52 weeks study) were not 
previously reported at week 16: hypertension, breast cancer, breast hyperplasia, ovarian cancer, 
cervical/uterine polyps.  
DHEA is mainly a precursor of androgens and secondary of estrogens. Since DHEA and its metabolites 
are significantly increased in serum of treated subjects, AEs related to exposure to sexual steroids are 
expected. Estrogenic effects include vaginal bleedings and hormonal tumours development 
(endometrial, breast, or ovarian cancers, cervix modifications). Androgenic effects include AEs such 
as acne, hypertrichosis, hirsutism, alopecia, metabolic changes (lipids increase, weight increase), 
cardiovascular disorders and psychiatric disorders are also expected.  
The causal relationship between an AE and the investigational product was assessed by the 
Investigator based on his judgment. However, many frequent local AEs considered as not related or 
possibly related to prasterone seem likely related to prasterone pharmaceutical form, contrary to the 
applicant’s assessment. For example, only one case of vaginal discharge among the 27 reported has 
been related to prasterone and only 4 cases of vulvovaginal burning sensation on the 16 recorded. In 
this respect, an imbalance in the number of AEs regarding local tolerance is observed between treated 
women and placebo.  
Similarly, several TEAEs classified as non-related or possibly related by investigators could be related 
to prasterone with regards its mechanism of action. Although the Applicant provided additional 
information, the role of prasterone could not be excluded in the occurrence of the following AEs: 
- Androgen effects: hypertension 
- Estrogen effects: Abnormal Pap smear (MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia), hormonal tumours 
development (breast, ovarian), uterine and cervical polyps, weight fluctuations, breast mass and 
breast tenderness. 
Overall, the most frequent drug–related AEs were local effects (application site/vaginal discharge) 
which are considered by the applicant related to prasterone effect on vaginal secretions/pH and to the 
melting of the hard fat excipient. However, since the incidence is higher in the treated group than in 
the placebo (15% for 6.5 mg DHEA vs 8.4% in placebo) a causal relationship to prasterone seems to 
have been minimised for local AEs. Similarly, several AEs for which the pharmacology of prasterone 
could suggest direct imputability have also been assessed as not-related. These effects are either 
androgenic (hypertension) or estrogenic (Abnormal Pap smear (MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia), 
hormonal tumours development (breast, ovarian), uterine/cervical polyps, weight fluctuations, breast 
mass, breast tenderness).

Serious adverse events and deaths 
No death was reported during clinical trials.  
In women exposed to 6.5 mg DHEA, 26 (2.2%) experienced serious TEAE (including 16 cases up to 
week 16 of treatment) vs 5 in the placebo group (1%). The most frequently affected primary SOCs 
were “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” (0.3%) and “Surgical and medical procedures” 
(0.3%), followed by “Gastrointestinal disorders” (0.2%) and “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders” (0.2%) and are not related to prasterone.  
However, among the serious TEAS, the responsibility of prasterone cannot be excluded in 3 cases: 
pulmonary embolism, ovarian cancer and breast cancer. Indeed a role of DHEA’s oestrogens 
derivatives cannot be excluded in the apparition (or worsening) of both hormonal tumours (breast or 
ovarian cancers) and thromboembolic events. Indeed, androgens and estrone concentration were 
significantly increased in the 6.5 mg treated group compared to placebo. A peripheral transformation 
of androgens into estrogens (aromatase) or Estrone transformation into estradiol are two possible 
pathways which can explain estrogenic AEs despite moderate elevation of estrogens in the serum of 
subjects.  
Adverse events of special interest 
As previously mentioned, the assessment of the causality was not considered relevant. Indeed, local 
tolerance AEs such as application site discharge or vulvovaginal disorders have not been assessed as 
related despite the high reporting rate and difference with the placebo arm (15% vs 8.4%).  
Similarly, a higher incidence was observed for the following AEs suggesting DHEA systemic exposure:  
1/ estrogenic effects 
Due to the transformation of DHEA into estrogens (including estradiol and estrone), the main concern 
is the potential risk of hormonal tumours development. During the clinical trials, the following AEs were 
pointed out because they were more frequently reported in the active treatment arm (6.5 mg DHEA) 
than in placebo: 
-  Cervical dysplasia (MedDRA term) from vaginal and Pap smears (40 cases (3.3%) in 6.5 mg DHEA 
vs 6 cases (1.3%) in placebo): According to the Applicant, Pap smear was performed at screening 
only in ERC-231/234/238 studies whereas Pap smear was performed both at screening and at the 
end of the long-term study ERC-230 (52 weeks). Additionally, in all studies, additional vaginal 
smears were performed at week 2, 6 and/or 12 to assess vaginal cell maturation index (efficacy 
parameter). Vaginal smears were collected at the second third of the lateral wall of the vagina. Of 
note, a vaginal smear does not allow to detect “cervical dysplasia” (MedDRA term) contrary to a 
Pap smear. In the 6.5 mg treated subjects group, 40 (3.3%) cases of “cervical dysplasia” (MedDRA 
term) have been reported. The cases of “cervical dysplasia” (MedDRA term) were mainly detected 
on vaginal smears (29 cases on 40) and not from Pap smears which is the gold standard method to 
screen cervix abnormalities (11 cases on 40). Overall, 7 subjects were detected with ASCUS on 
Pap smears at week 52 with a negative HPV status and the outcome of these subjects is unknown. 
-  Breast safety and endometrial safety were monitored during the long-term study (ERC-230) up to 
12 months in 435 women.  
o  Regarding breast safety, one case of high grade ductal carcinoma and one intraductal 
epithelial hyperplasia were reported. All subjects had normal findings at screening, 
therefore, the lesions appeared during prasterone treatment. Preclinical data showed an 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 73/94 
  
  
effect of prasterone on ductal growth in female rats. Prasterone role cannot be excluded in 
the occurrence of breast cancer and breast hyperplasia. 
o  Regarding endometrial safety, the 389 exploitable biopsies at week 52 did not reveal 
abnormalities. Women not eligible to the endometrial biopsy or unwilling to undergo 
biopsies, underwent a transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS). Five women had a thickness 
measurement above 4 mm. The endometrial histology was normal in two cases; in 2 cases, 
subjects had taken HRT (known to induce endometrial thickness) before the TVUS and in 
one case, no information was available. Data on endometrial safety are lacking in 37 
women who had neither an end-of-study biopsy nor a TVUS. The reasons were mainly the 
discontinuation of the study and loss of follow-up. No further information are available on 
these 37 women. However, Applicant fulfilled the EMEA requirements (Scientific advice 
2009) with a total of 389 exploitable biopsies at week 52, and the results of these biopsies 
did not reveal abnormalities. 
-  One ovarian cancer occurred in a woman treated with 6.5 mg DHEA. This cancer was diagnosed 
after the 52 weeks of treatment. The subject had a BRCA1 mutation which is a risk factor in the 
occurrence of ovarian cancer. However, the role of prasterone and its metabolites cannot be 
categorically excluded.   
-  Cervical and uterine polyps, ovarian cysts, breast mass and breast tenderness were more frequent 
in the treated women than in placebo (overall incidence 1.4% vs 0.2%). In all cases the 
polyps/masses were non-malignant; this is reassuring. The incidence of these gynaecological 
findings is in line with the expected incidence in this age group. However it is still greater than the 
incidence in the placebo control group and their occurrence may be hormone dependent. 
-  Vaginal bleedings occurred during clinical trials with similar incidence between the 6.5 mg DHEA 
treated-women and the placebo group (1.6% vs 1.3%). The histology of the endometrium was 
benign in all cases. No safety issue was thus identified.  
One pulmonary embolism has been reported in the 6.5 mg DHEA treated group (one case also 
reported in placebo arm).  
Finally, regarding AEs possibly related to estrogenic effects, the main issue pointed out is the cervical 
safety for which uncertainties remain about the outcome of 14 subjects. Cervical or uterine 
polyps/mass were not malignant but the greater incidence observed in the treated subjects vs placebo 
is of concern and could be related to local estrogenic impregnation. Moreover, three cases of possible 
hormonal tumours development were reported (two in breast and one in ovary) and should be 
considered in the frame of the consequences of a long-term systemic and local exposure to DHEA and 
its metabolites.  
2/ Androgenic effects 
Due to the transformation of DHEA into androgens including testosterone, the occurrence of 
cardiovascular disorders or skin problems (such as acne, hypertrichosis) has to be monitored. 
Regarding the following TEAEs, the incidence was higher in treated subjects with 6.5 mg DHEA than in 
placebo: 
• 
Hypertension was more frequently reported in treated subjects (17 cases, 1.42% vs 0.8%). Of 
note, 8/17 subjects had pre-existing hypertension and 10 subjects received anti-hypertensive 
drugs as corrective treatments. A role of prasterone and its metabolites cannot be excluded in 
the occurrence or worsening of hypertension. Androgens are known to induce increase in blood 
pressure. The level of androgens in treated subjects (6.5 mg DHEA) was significantly increased 
compared to placebo. Safety data are limited in women with hypertension > 140/90 mmHg since 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 74/94 
  
  
it was an exclusion criteria. Therefore, it is not possible to exclude the role of prasterone in the 
occurrence of hypertension especially in women with a history of hypertension. 
• 
• 
Skin effects (acne, hypertrichosis) were more frequent in treated subject but the overall 
incidence remains low (acne: 1.25% vs 0.42% / hypertrichosis: 0.59% vs 0.42%) and no causal 
relationship can be drawn.  
Lipids profile was modified in treated women who experienced more hypercholesterolemia and 
blood cholesterol increase than in placebo. The lipids modifications observed and their incidence 
seem rather related to the women`s condition (age, comorbidities and medical history) than to 
prasterone administration.  
Weight modifications (increase or decrease) were reported more frequently in treated subjects than in 
placebo with incidence of 2.5% vs 1.3% for weight increase and 2.6% vs 1.3% for weight decrease.  
The safety profile, after a daily vaginal administration of prasterone, shows that there are AEs which 
could be the clinical manifestation of the significant increase (as compared to baseline levels) of DHEA 
and metabolites in serum of treated subjects.  
Laboratory findings 
DHEA and related steroids 
One of the most important safety parameter in the development of this product is the evaluation of the 
systemic crossing of DHEA and its metabolites. 
The applicant performed measurements of DHEA and its metabolites in serum (DHEA, Androst-5-ene-
3β,17β-diol; Androstenedione; Testosterone; Dihydrotestosterone; Estrone; Estradiol; DHEA-sulfate; 
Estrone Sulfate; Androsterone Glucuronide; Androstan-3α, 17β-diol 17-glucuronide) in all studies at 
baseline and at the end-of study. The data presented included data from studies up to 16 weeks.  
First, a comparison between post-baseline and baseline serum concentration mean was performed 
(using a t-test). Then a comparison between the serum values in the treated group (either 0.25% or 
0.5% or 1.0% group) and the placebo group was done using an ANCOVA test.  
Vaginal administration of DHEA increases serum androgens concentrations compared to baseline and 
to placebo as shown by the increase of the following metabolites [Androst-5-ene-3β, 17β-diol (5-diol), 
Androstenedione (4-dione), Testosterone (Testo), Dihydrotetosterone (DHT), DHEA Sulfate (DHEA-S), 
Androsterone Glucuronide (ADT-G) and Androstane-3α, 17β-diol 17-Glucuronide (17G)].  
Estrogenic metabolites are also increased compared to baseline and placebo (to a lesser degree than 
androgenic metabolites) as shown by the increase of Estrone (E1) and Estrone-Sulfate (E1-S). 
Moreover, the more the DHEA concentration administered is high, the more the androgen metabolites 
serum concentrations increase as shown by pharmacokinetics. Therefore, contrary to the Applicant’s 
claim, the CHMP is of the opinion that DHEA crosses the vagina and is retrieved in blood.  
An increase in DHEA AUC0-24 (2.26 fold on Day 7 in ERC-213 study) was observed after vaginal 
administration of prasterone which reflects a systemic exposure. The applicant considers the variation 
of the serum concentrations of DHEA and metabolites as not clinically significant based on a 
comparison to usual concentration references. 
At this stage, a significant increase of DHEA and metabolites has been observed. The clinical meaning 
of this increase could be manifested by the occurrence of AEs such as abnormal Pap smear (MedDRA 
term: cervical dysplasia), uterine/cervical polyps, or hypertension.

Other laboratory parameters (urinalysis, haematology and chemistry): 
There was a statistically significant change from baseline in haematocrit in the group treated with 
0.5% prasterone. 
Regarding chemistry, haematology and urinalysis parameters no specific issue was identified.  
Safety in special populations 
No specific analysis was performed in specific populations. The monitoring of the male partners did not 
reveal safety issues. Of note, in clinical trials age ranges from 40 to 80 years. The analysis of the 
TEAEs according to the age did not reveal difference in Aes incidence. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The potential of dehydroepiandrosterone to act as a direct inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 
isoforms (CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) was evaluated in vitro using 
pooled human liver microsomes. In addition, the potential of DHEA to act as a time-dependent inhibitor 
of CYP3A4 was evaluated by comparing the inhibitory potential of DHEA after 30 min preincubation 
with NADPH-supplemented human liver microsomes with those of obtained after co-incubation. 
Co-incubation of DHEA did not affect the activities of CYP1A2 (phenacetin O-deethylation), CYP2A6 
(coumarin 7-hydroxylation), CYP2B6 (bupropion hydroxylation), CYP2C8 (amodiaquine N-
deethylation), CYP2C9 (diclofenac 4’-hydroxylation), CYP2C19 (mephenytoin 4’-hydroxylation, CYP2D6 
(dextromethorphan O-demethylation), CYP2E1 (chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation), and CYP3A4 
(midazolam 1’-hydroxylation, testosterone 6β-hydroxylation) up to the highest tested concentration 
(IC50 >10 μM). 
Furthermore, preincubation (30 min.) of DHEA with NADPH-supplemented human liver microsomes did 
not affect testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activity (82% after preincubation vs. 80% after coincubation 
in the presence of 10 μM DHEA) and midazolam 1’-hydroxylation activity (93% after preincubation vs. 
89% after co-incubation in the presence of 10 μM DHEA), giving no evidence for time dependent 
inhibition of CYP3A4. 
In conclusion, drug-drug interactions through inhibition of CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 
2E1, and 3A4 by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are unlikely. It is agreed from the results that the 
possibility that prasterone could inhibit human cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) is unlikely. Therefore no particular interactions are expected. 
No Aes related to drug-drug interactions were reported from the clinical studies. The Applicant 
considers that such Aes are not expected given the local action of DHEA. However, since the following 
medications were excluded in subjects during clinical trials (oral and local hormone replacement 
therapy, hormonal therapy, vaginal lubricant, cream and shower) the clinical consequences of their 
concomitant use with prasterone is not known. This is reflected in the PI and RMP safety concerns. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Of the total of 220 subjects who discontinued the studies, 62 discontinued due to TEAEs representing 
28% of all cases. Of these 62 subjects who discontinued from the studies due to TEAEs, 10 (16%) 
were in the placebo group, 11 (18%) were in the 0.25% DHEA group, 40 (65%) were in the 0.50% 
DHEA group and 1 (1.6%) was in the 1.0% DHEA group. A total of 14 subjects discontinued due to 
Serious TEAEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 76/94 
  
  
The frequencies of the preferred MedDRA terms for the most frequently recorded TEAEs showed no 
relevant differences between the treatment groups. The most commonly reported preferred terms for 
the TEAEs that led subjects to discontinuations were application site discharge (0.5% of subjects) and 
Human papilloma virus test positive (0.2% of subjects). Vulvovaginal disorders (such as burning 
sensation, discomfort, pruritus, and erythema) were also reasons for treatment discontinuation. No 
specific TEAE which led to discontinuation arose after 16 weeks of treatment compared to the first 16 
weeks of treatment.  
These Aes were not serious but were troublesome enough to lead to discontinuations.  
Post marketing experience 
In Japan, prasterone pessaries have been marketed for 18 years in labor induction indication. A 
formulation of prasterone, known as KB 60, was developed by Kanebo in Japan for labour induction. It 
is a vaginal suppository formulation of sodium prasterone sulphate (600 mg) and was launched in 
Japan as Mylis®. During the marketing period, adverse effects were reported (shock, respiratory 
depression). The withdrawal from the market was due to doubtful efficacy and serious adverse effects 
observed in the foetus (bradycardia or foetal distress and cases of death have been reported). The 
effects observed concerned foetal AEs in a specific indication (cervical ripening). Of note, this medicinal 
product contained a much higher prasterone strength than Intrarosa. 
Vaginal prasterone was licensed for Europe to Innothera where it was in phase Iib trials in France, 
Italy, Germany and Spain. However, Innothera discontinued development of this drug.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Clinical safety has been assessed on the results of the 6 clinical studies. Every clinical trial had 
recorded Aes. However, among the 6 studies, four are clinically interesting, because of the time of 
exposure, the dose and the number of subjects. ERC-231, ERC-234 and ERC-238 encompasses 609 
women exposed up to week 12. The strength of these studies is the design of the study: double-blind, 
placebo-controlled and randomized allowing a relevant comparison of prasterone safety profile to a 
placebo group. These studies were initially performed to assess efficacy and the safety are only 
secondary endpoints. Long term use of prasterone pessary has been studied in ERC-230 study where 
435 non hysterectomized women were exposed up to week 52. Despite the long duration of this study 
(52 weeks), it is open-label and does not allow a comparison to placebo after a long-term exposure. It 
cannot be regarded as a pivotal study. Globally, these clinical studies allow a safety evaluation but an 
important limitation is the absence of an active comparator in the design to compare the safety profile 
of prasterone pessary with local oestrogens.  
Prasterone and its metabolites have androgenic and estrogenic effects. The exclusion criteria applied 
during clinical trials reduce the risk of occurrence of adverse events such as Thromboembolic disorders, 
history of cancers, cardiac failure and hypertension above 140/90 mmHg. Moreover, the target 
population as proposed by the applicant generally is expected to have risk factors excluded in the CT. 
Therefore the CHMP considered that the limited safety data in these specific populations, due to 
exclusion criteria, should be reflected in the product information (contraindications; precautions and 
warnings).  
During Intrarosa clinical trials, 1542 women have been exposed to various doses of DHEA (from 3.25 
to 13 mg) and 474 to the placebo. On the 1542 women, 1196 were exposed to the 6.5 mg. Therefore, 
more than 1500 subjects were exposed fulfilling the EMA guidance on population exposure 
requirements (CPMP/ICH/375/95). Regarding the long-term safety, 435 subjects completed the 52 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 77/94 
  
  
weeks study. More than 300 biopsies were available and thus satisfying to CHMP guideline on clinical 
investigation of HRT products (EMEA/CHMP/021/97).  
Regarding subject characteristics, women’s mean age was 58.6 years with an average age of 
menopause of 46.7 years. Similar BMI were retrieved between groups but it was slightly high (26.4 
kg/m²). Globally, demographic features are similar between placebo and the 6.5 mg treatment arm 
except for hysterectomized and ovariectomized women which is lower in 6.5 mg treatment group than 
in placebo (23.4% vs 41.6%). This discrepancy does not constitute a problem since pathological 
findings are more expected in non-hysterectomized women. However, the type of hysterectomy 
(partial with cervix preservation or total) was not mentioned.  
A few TEAEs were assessed as drug-related by the investigator and concerned mainly local tolerance 
Aes. A higher incidence of such AEs has been observed in the 6.5 mg DHEA treatment group than in 
placebo (15% vs 8.4%). The most frequent AE assessed as drug-related was application site discharge 
which seems related (in the applicant opinion) to improved pH & estrogenic status of the vaginal cells 
in women treated in addition to the effect of liquid hard fat excipient. This explanation seems 
reasonable. 
Similarly, the higher incidence of urinary tract infections is more related to contamination by fecal flora 
than to the use of applicator.  
The TEAEs profile by age-class reveals that the safety profile is similar regardless of the age. 
The intracrinology concept, as claimed by the Applicant, has not been demonstrated. During clinical 
trials, serum steroid concentrations were significantly increased (AUC and means Cmax) meaning that 
prasterone and its metabolites cross the vagina and are retrieved in blood. Despite a statistically 
significant increase of androgen metabolites and estrone in serum (after a treatment of 6.5 mg of 
DHEA), this increase is considered to be in the range of expected concentrations for the population of 
post-menopausal women. 
Among TEAEs which could be related to estrogenic exposure, the following were reported in clinical 
trials: Abnormal Pap and vaginal smears (MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia) (40), hormonal cancers 
such as ovarian (1) or breast (1) cancer, breast hyperplasia (1), cervical or uterine polyps (4) and 
pulmonary embolism (1).  
The abnormal smears (MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia) were mainly detected on vaginal smears 
(performed for maturation index evaluation) and not from Pap smears which is the gold standard 
method to screen cervix abnormalities. In placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of abnormal 
vaginal smears (MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia), is higher in treated subjects (6.5 mg DHEA) than in 
placebo.  In ERC-230 study (no placebo arm), follow-up information on 7 subjects with abnormal Pap 
smears at week 52 with a HPV negative status is lacking. There is thus still limited data about the 
consequences of a long-term use of Prasterone on cervical safety. 
Regarding endometrial safety, no abnormal findings were detected after 52 weeks in the 389 
exploitable biopsies available. Sixty-three (63) women, who completed the study or not, did not have 
results of end-of–study biopsy due to bad samples or ineligibility to biopsy or subject’s reluctance. For 
these women, a TVUS to measure endometrial thickness was performed. On the 43 women who 
underwent TVUS, five had thickness > 4 mm and the endometrial histology was normal for 4 cases 
(unknown in 1 case). However, data are lacking for 37 women who did not have endometrial biopsy 
nor TVUS due to consent withdrawal or loss of follow-up. However, despite the absence of information 
in these 37 women, the EU requirement to provide more than 300 exploitable biopsies after 12 months 
is fulfilled.

A causal role of prasterone in one case of breast cancer, one case of ovarian cancer, and one case of 
breast hyperplasia cannot be excluded. At screening none of these subjects had abnormal or malignant 
findings except microcalcifications in both cases of breast cancer and breast hyperplasia. Events 
occurred one year after prasterone beginning thus time to onset is compatible. Moreover, pre-clinical 
data showed abnormal proliferation of mammary ductal cells in female rats after 12 months of skin 
exposure to high dose (30 mg) of prasterone. In the case of ovarian cancer, although the subject had 
a BRCA1 mutation which is a risk factor in the development of ovarian cancer, a role of prasterone 
cannot be excluded.  
The histology performed in women with gynaecological findings (such as cervical or uterine polyps) 
were non-malignant. The incidence of these gynaecological findings is in line with the expected 
incidence in this age group. However it is still greater than the incidence in the placebo control group 
and their occurrence may be hormone dependent. 
Regarding androgen impregnation, some AEs were slightly increased in 6.5 mg treated women 
compared to placebo: Acne (1.25% vs 0.42%) and hypertrichosis (0.59% vs 0.42%). Considering the 
low incidence and the weak difference between the incidences in treated subject and the placebo, no 
conclusions can be drawn.  
Cardiovascular AEs analysis showed that hypertension was more frequently reported in treated 
subjects than in placebo (1.4% vs 0.8%). However, when taking into account the number of 
treatment-days, the incidence is similar between both groups (7.9 vs 6.6 / 100,000 subjects-days). Of 
note, the incidence provided by the Applicant is expressed by subjects/days and not subjects/years, 
the incidence is 3,000/100,000 subjects-years in the placebo group and 2,400/100,000 subjects-years 
in the 6.5 mg DHEA group. Of note, subjects with history of cardiac diseases or hypertension (140/90 
mmHg) were excluded in both pivotal studies and ERC-230. Half of women who had hypertension 
during prasterone treatment had previous hypertension. More than half of the women received anti-
hypertensive medicine as a corrective measure, which can explain the high recovery level in 
hypertensive women. In 6 cases, blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg was reported fulfilling the 
criteria of hypertension. The calculated incidence in the treated group is thus (6/1196 i.e., 0.5%). It is 
thus not possible to rule out prasterone in the occurrence of hypertension.  
The lipid modifications reported during clinical trials concerned mainly obese and overweighed women 
and thus prasterone role can hardly be drawn. Analysis of psychiatric disorders did not reveal safety 
issues. Weight modifications occurred (increase or decrease in weight) without a specific trend. The 
incidence of weight fluctuations was more frequent in treated subjects. 
Twenty-six serious cases were reported in the 6.5 mg prasterone group (2.2%) compared to 5 in the 
placebo group (1.1%). Most cases were related to surgical or procedures but not to prasterone use. 
Prasterone role cannot be excluded in 3 serious cases: one pulmonary embolism, one ovarian cancer 
and one breast carcinoma. No death was reported in clinical studies.  
Similar incidence of discontinuation due to TEAEs was found for the 6.5 mg DHEA treatment arm and 
placebo (28% vs 23%). Application site discharge and vulvovaginal disorders (burning sensation, 
discomfort, etc.) were the most frequent reason for discontinuation.  
TEAEs observed up to week 52 are globally the same than those observed at week 16. However, 
several serious AEs occurred during ERC-230 (52 weeks study) were not previously reported at week 
16: hypertension, breast cancer, breast hyperplasia, ovarian cancer, cervical/uterine polyps. 
Pharmacokinetics data provided by the applicant showed a systemic passage of prasterone, androgens 
and estrone (see PK section). A peripheral transformation of androgens into estrogens is possible (via 
aromatase in the adipose tissue, in breast etc.). The comparison to daily administration of Vagifem 
(estradiol vaginal tablets) showed similar estrogen levels in serum (indirect comparison with literature 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 79/94 
  
  
data). However, the increase observed remains within the normal ranges observed for this population 
(post-menopausal women) according to several literature sources independent from the Applicant.  
The clinical relevance of this systemic exposure could be manifested by the occurrence of androgenic-
related AEs (hypertension) and of estrogenic-related problems (uterine and cervical polyps, abnormal 
Pap smear (MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia). 
Remaining uncertainties persist regarding the occurrence of hormonal-dependant cancers. 
These uncertainties regarding the long-term safety of vaginal prasterone administration have been 
reflected in the product information and the Risk management plan, especially regarding the 
population to be contraindicated and the warning and precautions which have to be taken (see PI).  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of prasterone is still uncertain.  
Although the most frequent TEAEs were non serious and concerned local AEs such as vaginal 
discharge, a higher incidence of local AEs is observed in the treated group compared to placebo (15% 
vs 8.4%) suggesting a role of prasterone and not only a role of the pharmaceutical form (pessary).  
Pharmacokinetics data confirmed the systemic exposure to DHEA and its androgenic and estrogenic 
metabolites. However, the concentrations observed after an administration of a daily dose of 6.5 mg 
prasterone (vaginally) remain within the normal ranges observed for the post-menopausal women. The 
hypothesis that prasterone has a local effect via intracrinology mechanism of action (as claimed by the 
applicant) is not supported. Contrary to what the applicant said (i.e. that the statistical difference in 
serum concentration has no clinical relevance since it is in the normal post-menopausal range), the 
systemic exposure observed could have a clinical relevance. Indeed, AEs suggesting an estrogenic 
exposure were observed in the DHEA group, mainly driven by frequent AEs such as abnormal Pap 
smears (MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia) and uterine/cervical polyps. Other serious AEs suggesting 
an estrogenic-like effect were reported, such as breast and ovarian cancers. AEs suggesting androgenic 
effect such as hypertension were observed in the DHEA group.  
The broad exclusion criteria applied during clinical trials excluded women with cardiovascular disorders, 
previous history of cancers or gynaecological abnormal findings. Therefore, limited data on long-term 
safety of intravaginal administration of prasterone are available in the target-population. A Drug 
Utilisation study is planned to assess compliance with the mandatory contra-indications in the product 
information, i.e. to evaluate whether EU prescribers abide by the contraindications as stated in the EU 
SmPC. 
An oral explanation was held at the CHMP meeting on 13 September 2017, where the applicant was 
given the opportunity to discuss the outstanding issues in view of addressing uncertainties in the long-
term safety profile of Intrarosa, in summary:  
• 
To reflect in the Intrarosa SmPC the information contained in the annex I to the Core SmPC for 
‘oestrogen products for vaginal application of which the systemic exposure to the oestrogen 
remains within the normal postmenopausal range’, along with the exclusion criteria applied 
during the clinical development.  
•  Regarding the RMP:  
o 
Inclusion of abnormal Pap smear (ASCUS) (MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia) as an 
important identified risk, and inclusion of development of oestrogen-dependent cancers 
such as ovarian cancer or breast cancer as an important potential risk. Revisions to the

proposed DUS synopsis (primary objectives, databases to be used, sample size and 
statistics description). 
Further to the oral explanation, the applicant committed to comply with the CHMP requests and the 
uncertainties are thus managed by the product and the DUS which is planned.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.6 is acceptable.  
In addition, with regard to the Drug Utilisation Study (category 1 study in the RMP), the CHMP and 
PRAC considered that further clarifications about the sample size (proposal for a minimum number of 
subjects that would be needed to provide reliable estimate of on label/off label use) and the data 
analysis plan (submission of a separate data analysis plan including statistical methods and tables 
and clarification to which analyses are precluded to be performed in which countries, based on 
limitations in database availability or validity) should be discussed in the framework of the study 
protocol assessment after the granting of the Marketing Authorisation.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the lengthy frequency of the PSUR submission for the already existing entry for prasterone in 
the EURD list, the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for Intrarosa is needed, 
as it cannot follow the already existing entry for prasterone. The requirements for submission of 
periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the 
CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international 
birth date (IBD). The IBD is 16.11.2016. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of prasterone with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers that prasterone is not a new active substance. 
Prasterone, is a constituent of three medicinal products previously authorised within the European 
Union (Biosteron, Stymen and DHEA Eljot). In addition, prastone enanthate, an ester of prasterone, is 
used as active substance in Gynodian Depot, which is registered in Europe.  
As the proposed active substance is exactly the same as in other authorised medicinal products in the 
EU, it can be concluded that prasterone is not a NAS. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Intrarosa (prasterone) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it has an imposed category 1 PASS at the time of authorisation. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is a relatively common condition symptomatically affecting 
approximately 50% of postmenopausal women. It is the consequence of reduced estrogenization of 
urogenital and pelvic tissue that results in a loss of vaginal elasticity, dryness, decreased lubrication 
with associated irritation, dyspareunia and urinary symptoms.  
Vulvovaginal atrophy can occur at any time in a woman's life cycle, although it is more common in the 
postmenopausal phase, a time of hypoestrogenism. Other causes of a hypoestrogenic state include 
lactation, various breast cancer treatments, and use of certain medications. In situations other than 
menopause, VVA may resolve spontaneously when estrogen levels are restored. 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 85/94 
  
  
 
 
Numerous retrospective studies have evaluated the prevalence of symptoms of VVA. Although these 
studies differ in type of symptoms elicited, study design, and study population, they provide a range of 
estimates of VVA prevalence. They all used self-reported symptoms of vaginal dryness to determine 
the prevalence of VVA. In general, the prevalence ranged from about 4% in the early premenopausal 
groups to 47% in the late postmenopausal group.  
The initial symptom is often lack of lubrication during intercourse. Eventually, persistent vaginal 
dryness may occur. Thinning of the epithelial lining may also cause pruritus, soreness, and a stinging 
pain in the vaginal and vulvar area, which, in turn, may further contribute to dyspareunia. Vaginal 
spotting, due to small tears in the vaginal epithelium, may also occur. Women with VVA may report a 
thin yellow or grey watery discharge secondary to the rise in pH that accompanies VVA. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Non-hormonal treatment:  
Current OTC treatments include non-hormonal vaginal moisturizers for VVA symptoms and lubricants 
for dyspareunia.  
- 
- 
Vaginal moisturizers are water based, available as liquids, gels, or pessaries inserted every few 
days. Vaginal moisturizers can be safely used long term, but they need to be used regularly for 
optimal effect. 
Vaginal lubricants are shorter acting than moisturizers and are applied at the time of sexual 
activity to reduce dyspareunia. They can be either water or silicone based, with the water-based 
products being the most widely available. They are applied to the vaginal opening and/or to the 
penis and often require repeated application during sexual activity. Silicone-based lubricants 
require application of only a very small amount and last longer. The choice of lubricant may 
depend on individual preferences and product availability. 
Hormonal treatments: 
Because the lack of circulating natural estrogens is the primary cause of atrophic vaginitis, the use of 
estrogen orally, transdermally or vaginally has been shown to be effective in improving symptoms and 
signs of VVA. Estrogen replacement restores normal pH levels and thickens and re vascularizes the 
epithelium. Adequate estrogen replacement therapy increases the number of superficial cells, may 
alleviate existing symptoms or even prevent development of urogenital symptoms if initiated at the 
time of menopause.  
Although vaginal estrogens applied as a cream, vaginal tablets, or a low-dose vaginal ring are to some 
extent systemically absorbed, the rise in serum estrogen levels appears to remain well below 
premenopausal levels. Nonetheless, this may be of concern to women with a history of breast or other 
hormonally sensitive cancers 
In addition, Senshio is a daily oral SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulator) recently approved in 
Europe in the treatment of moderate to severe symptomatic VVA in postmenopausal women who are 
not candidate to local estrogen therapy. Senshio is available on the market in some countries of the 
EU.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  clinical  development  of  prasterone  contains  mainly  two  pivotal  phase  III  studies  ERC-231  and 
ERC-238,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  conducted  to  assess  efficacy  of  6.5  mg  of 
vaginal  prasterone  in  postmenopausal  women  with  VVA,  who  have  dyspareunia  as  most  bothersome 
symptom. In study ERC-231, 81/87/87 subjects were randomized respectively to placebo, prasterone 
3.25 mg and prasterone 6.5 mg. In study ERC-238, 157/325 subjects were randomized respectively to 
placebo and prasterone 6.5 mg. Based on the exclusion criteria, several categories of populations were 
not exposed to prasterone during the development.  
Prasterone was administered vaginally once a day for 12 weeks. The design of both studies was 
comparable, as well as population characteristics and treatment duration. There were 4 co-primary 
endpoints including change in vaginal maturation index (increase in % of superficial cells, decrease in 
% of parabasal cells), change in vaginal pH and improvement in dyspareunia. The selected efficacy 
endpoints are relevant as they combine PD parameters and clinical criterion. The clinical criterion 
(dyspareunia) was self-assessed using a severity score. Other criteria as vaginal dryness and 
improvement in quality of life were part of the secondary endpoints. No active comparator group was 
included in the clinical programme of prasterone. The design of the studies was adequate, though a 
weakness was the lack of an active comparator arm. 
In addition, an open label safety study (ERC-230) was conducted during 52 weeks to assess the safety 
outcome of long term administration. Overall, 530 subjects were enrolled in this study.  
An  additional  phase  III  efficacy  and  safety  study  (ERC-234)  was  conducted  where  two  doses  of 
prasterone  were  compared  to  placebo.  However,  the  administration  regimen  was  different  from  the 
claimed one and from the regimen used in the studies ERC-231 and ERC-238.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The clinical efficacy of intravaginal DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone, or prasterone) on the symptoms 
and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) has been mainly evaluated in 2 pivotal clinical studies 
conducted in Canada and USA. Efficacy was assessed using co-primary endpoints consisting of three 
PD parameters (change on characteristics of cells in vaginal epithelium) and one clinical parameter 
(severity of pain at sexual intercourse, or vaginal dryness). The selection of these efficacy endpoints is 
in line with the US Guidance for Industry on assessment of products in vulvar and vaginal atrophy. No 
specific European guideline with regard to this indication is available.  
From the clinical development, the extent of exposure to vaginal prasterone was in line with the ICH 
E1 guideline as “the total number of individuals treated with the investigational drug, including short-
term exposure, was about 1500.” 
Phase III efficacy studies ERC-231 and ERC-238 showed a statistically significant difference in 
response to all co-primary endpoints between the DHEA arms and the placebo arm. This difference was 
clear with regard to the three PD parameters (effect on % of parabasal and superficial cells of a vaginal 
smear, effect on vaginal pH) at the 12 week time-interval. Please refer to the effects table in section 
3.6 for details on effect size for each parameter.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
-  Mechanism of action: the hypothesis of “intracrinology” is proposed by the Applicant to explain 
the mechanism of action on VVA. This hypothesis suggests a conversion of DHEA to active 
metabolites inside the vagina cells and a local action on the different epithelium layers, followed 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 87/94 
  
  
by negligible systemic absorption. However, data of serum levels shows an increase in DHEA and 
metabolites in subjects treated with prasterone. The length of this increase is unknown. In case of 
long-term use, clinical consequences of this exposure cannot be excluded.  
- 
The lack of active comparator: No active comparator group (local oestrogens) was included in 
the clinical development. Prasterone was only compared to placebo. Absence of comparison to the 
gold standard is an additional efficacy uncertainty in the overall dossier.  
- 
Regarding the clinical endpoint (dyspareunia): the clinical relevance of the improvement on 
dyspareunia over the vehicle is modest. Decrease (versus baseline) in severity score of 
dyspareunia at week 12 for prasterone 6.5 mg and placebo respectively was -1.42 and -1.06 in 
study ERC-238, and -1.27 and -0.87 in study ERC-231. The effect observed following a local 
administration of a drug includes also the influence of the vehicle (liquefied hard fat excipient in 
the case of intravaginal DHEA) which can add to the effect of the drug itself. Data submitted by 
the Applicant (Responder analysis) show also an improvement in symptoms in the placebo group 
probably due to the fat component of the pessary. In other words, results of the pivotal studies 
ERC-231 and ERC-238 showed an improvement versus baseline in the clinical criterion 
(dyspareunia) in both the placebo and Prasterone groups. Although the length of improvement in 
the prasterone group was larger compared to the length of improvement with placebo, the clinical 
benefit of Intrarosa on dyspareunia is modest.  
- 
Absence of European population exposed to the product: The clinical development of 
prasterone was performed in USA and Canada and European populations were not exposed to the 
drug. Although a recent international survey (Nappi and Kokot-Lierepa 2010) has shown that 
subjects from various European countries are not essentially different from those in the USA or 
Canada with regard to issues related to vaginal atrophy, given the cultural dimension of the 
questions related to menopause and to sexual activities, a different perception of the benefit in 
European women cannot be excluded.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Safety data were collected during the 6 clinical trials performed. Regarding the duration of exposure, 
four studies had a 12 weeks design and one study concerned a long-term treatment of 52 weeks.  
Application site discharge was the most frequently ADR reported (8.7% DHEA and 3.4 % placebo). 
It was also the main reason for treatment discontinuation in 6.5 mg DHEA group. This ADRs could be 
the consequence of increased physiological discharge due to the improved pH following Prasterone 
administration.  
Uterine or cervical polyps (benign) have been reported more frequently in treated subjects but 
with a low frequency. Breast mass (benign)/ breast tenderness were also reported (0.7% vs 
0.2%). Considering the higher frequency and the increased serum concentration of DHEA and its 
metabolites (including estrone) the causal relationship is at least a reasonable possibility.  
Abnormal smears (MedDRA term: Cervical dysplasia) detected by vaginal smears were more 
frequently reported in subjects exposed to DHEA 6.5 mg than in placebo. Considering only the cases 
diagnosed by Pap smears (gold standard method to screen cervix abnormalities) in the open-label 
ERC-230 study with no placebo arm, 7 cases are of special interest. The frequency reaches 1.6% 
(7/435 women exposed up to 52 weeks). In these subjects, the HPV status is negative. The 
abnormalities are all classified as ASCUS (Atypia of squamous cells of undetermined significance) and 
were detected at W52. No follow-up were available for these subjects (no additional Pap smears nor 
colposcopy). The outcome of these subjects is unknown. Cervical abnormalities were exclusion criteria 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 88/94 
  
  
during clinical trials and all subjects had normal Pap smear at screening before the start of the studies. 
Therefore the abnormalities occurred during Intrarosa treatment. The causal relationship is at least a 
reasonable possibility.  
Hypertension was more frequently reported in treated subjects (17 cases, 1.42% vs 0.8%). 
However, when the incidence is calculated on the number of treatment-days basis, the incidence is 
similar between both groups. Six subjects fulfil the definition of hypertension (i.e., >140/90 mmHg) in 
the treated group. 8/17 subjects had pre-existing hypertension and 10 subjects received anti-
hypertensive drugs as corrective treatments. Prasterone and its metabolites role cannot be excluded in 
the occurrence or worsening of hypertension. Androgens are known to induce increase in blood 
pressure. The level of androgens in treated subjects (6.5 mg DHEA) was significantly increased 
compared to placebo. Safety data are limited in women with hypertension > 140/90 mmHg since it 
was an exclusion criteria. Therefore, it is not possible to exclude the role of prasterone in the 
occurrence of hypertension especially in women with a history of hypertension. 
Weight increase or decrease were reported more frequently in the subjects treated with DHEA 
6.5 mg than in placebo (respectively 2.5% vs 1.3% and respectively 2.6% vs 1.3%). Weight may be 
modified by hormonal fluctuations and given the increase of DHEA and its metabolites in serum of 
treated subjects, the causal relationship is at least a reasonable possibility. 
No death was reported from the phase III studies.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Several uncertainties remain with regard to the safety profile of prasterone: 
-  Serious AEs suggesting estrogenic effects were observed in the 6.5 mg prasterone group and 
none in placebo: breast cancer (1), breast hyperplasia (1), ovarian cancer (1). These AEs were 
detected at week 52 in the long-term safety study (ERC-230; no placebo arm). Of note, PK data 
showed significant increase in androgens and estrone serum concentrations after vaginal 
administration of prasterone 6.5 mg. This increase remains within the normal ranges observed for this 
population (post-menopausal women). It cannot be excluded that the systemic exposure after 
treatment with prasterone may induce a malignant cell proliferation or a worsening of a pre-existing 
hormonal tumour. Moreover, for breast cancer, a preclinical study on female rates showed abnormal 
mammary ductal growth which is close from the clinical findings (intraductal epithelial hyperplasia and 
high grade ductal carcinoma). 
-  The outcome of cervical safety remains unknown; overall, in placebo-controlled studies, 
frequency of abnormal vaginal smears (MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia) was more elevated in women 
exposed to DHEA (6.5 mg) than in placebo and a role of Prasterone in the occurrence of these AEs is 
considered possible. However, the long-term consequences of such findings is still unknown. In the 
open-label ERC-230 study (no placebo arm), the outcome of 7 subjects with results of ASCUS or LGSIL 
(on Pap smears) is not available because no follow-ups were performed after the end of the study. This 
concern is important given the possible long-term use and the risk of cervical cancer. 
-  The exclusion criteria applied in the clinical development were large as subjects with risk factors 
such as cardiac disorders, gynaecological findings (polyps, cervical abnormalities, and genital 
bleedings) or hormonal cancers were excluded. In the “real life”, postmenopausal women to be treated 
for VVA are likely to have such co morbidities.  
-  No active comparator group was included in the clinical development (local estrogens). 
Only indirect comparison (of limited reliability) with local estrogens is provided with no clinical safety 
data. Considering the safety results from the clinical development (see above) and the PK data 
Assessment report  
EMA/793337/2017 
Page 89/94 
  
  
showing a systemic exposure, there are no reasons to expect a better safety pattern with prasterone 
than local estrogens, in particular with long-term use.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The claimed indication of prasterone is the “treatment of VVA in postmenopausal women”. VVA is a 
non-life threatening condition, relatively common symptomatically, affecting approximately 50% of 
postmenopausal women. 
Alternative treatments include non-hormonal OTC products (vaginal moisturizers for VVA symptoms 
and lubricants for dyspareunia) and hormonal drugs, as HRT or local estrogens.

EMA/793337/2017

No European population was exposed to the treatment. 
From prasterone clinical development, a placebo effect was observed on the clinical parameter. The 
proper clinical benefit of Intrarosa is therefore modest.  
The safety pattern observed from the clinical development shows AEs suggesting androgenic 
(hypertension) and estrogenic effects (uterine and cervical polyps, abnormal Pap smear (MedDRA 
term: cervical dysplasia)). These adverse events observed are likely to be the clinical result of the 
increase in DHEA and metabolites serum levels - observed from PK data - after intravaginal 
administration.  
In the placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of abnormal vaginal smears (MedDRA term: cervical 
dysplasia) is higher in the subjects exposed to Prasterone 6.5 mg than in placebo and the causal 
relationship is considered at least possible. However, the long-term consequences of the abnormalities 
detected on Pap smears (ASCUS or LGSIL) in the long-term study ERC-230 (no placebo arm) is 
unknown since no follow-ups are available.  
Also, 1 case of breast cancer, 1 case of breast hyperplasia and 1 case of ovarian cancer were observed 
with prasterone. Although strict causal relationship cannot be confirmed, we cannot exclude the role of 
(increased) hormonal serum levels in the occurrence of such hormonal dependant cancers. 
Of note, given the treated condition (VVA in postmenopausal women), a long-term use is expected. 
Also, exclusion criteria were large and women with risk factors with regard to androgenic effects (CV 
disorders) and estrogenic effects (hormone dependant disorders) were excluded. Moreover safety in 
women treated with Intrarosa and other hormonal treatments such as androgens, estrogens or 
progestins is not known since such concomitant treatments were excluded in clinical trials. Exposure of 
these populations in case of approval cannot be excluded. 
Thus, long-term use of prasterone in the target population (post-menopausal women with VVA) has 
unknown consequences especially regarding the hormonal dependant cancers. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
For a long term treatment of non-life-threatening disease, a strong benefit/risk balance would have 
been expected, including an important effect on vaginal symptoms and a reassuring safety pattern. 
Efficacy demonstrated for prasterone is modest. A statistically significant difference in response to all 
co-primary endpoints has been shown between the DHEA arms and the placebo arm in the main 
efficacy studies (ERC-231 and ERC-238). The difference at the 12 week time-interval was clear for the 
three pharmacodynamic parameters (effect on % of parabasal and superficial cells of a vaginal smear, 
effect on vaginal pH); it was more modest for the clinical parameter (improvement in dyspareunia), as 
in particular for dyspareunia a placebo-effect was observed.  
Regarding safety, application site discharge was the most frequently observed adverse event with 
higher incidence with Intrarosa versus placebo. Other AEs related to estrogenic and androgenic 
exposure (abnormal Pap smears (MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia), uterine and cervical polyps, HT) 
were more reported with Intrarosa, although their frequencies were limited. The causality between 
these AEs and Intrarosa is considered at least possible. Therefore, abnormal Pap smears (ASCUS) 
(MedDRA term: cervical dysplasia) constitutes a safety concern which warrants inclusion in the safety 
specification of the RMP as an important identified risk.  
Rare cases of breast and ovarian cancers were reported with Intrarosa during the clinical trial 
programme. None of these cases were reported with the placebo group, although there was no placebo 
arm in the long-term study ERC-230. No firm conclusion can be drawn given the limited number of

cases; however breast and ovarian cancers constitute a potential safety concern which warrants 
inclusion in the safety specification of the RMP as an important potential risk.  
In order to address limitations around the benefit-risk, additional warnings and contraindications in the 
product information were implemented and a Drug Utilisation Study (DUS) was imposed as a category 
1 study (condition to the MA). The main objective of this DUS is to assess compliance with the contra-
indications in the product information, i.e. to evaluate whether EU prescribers abide by the 
contraindications as stated in the EU SmPC. The results of this DUS are considered relevant and key to 
the B/R balance of the product in its actual use (real-life situation).  
In conclusion, the benefit-risk of Intrarosa is considered positive based on modest clinical efficacy and 
an acceptable safety profile.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Intrarosa for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women 
having moderate to severe symptoms is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Intrarosa is favourable in the following indication: 
Intrarosa is indicated for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women 
having moderate to severe symptoms.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measure: 
Description 
Non-interventional PASS - Drug Utilisation Study (DUS) to describe the baseline 
characteristics, utilisation patterns of EU postmenopausal women initiating treatment 
with Intrarosa and to assess whether EU prescribers abide by the contraindications 
stated in the EU SmPC.

New Active Substance Status 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers that prasterone is not a new active substance. 
Prasterone, is a constituent of three medicinal products previously authorised within the European 
Union (Biosteron, Stymen and DHEA Eljot). 
In addition, prastone enanthate, an ester of prasterone, is used as active substance in Gynodian 
Depot, which is registered in Europe.  
As the proposed active substance is exactly the same as in other authorised medicinal products in the 
EU, it can be concluded that prasterone is not a NAS.

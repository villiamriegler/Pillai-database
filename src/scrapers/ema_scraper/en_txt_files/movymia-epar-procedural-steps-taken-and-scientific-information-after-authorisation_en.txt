SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Movymia in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. The RMP has been 
also updated (version 2.2).

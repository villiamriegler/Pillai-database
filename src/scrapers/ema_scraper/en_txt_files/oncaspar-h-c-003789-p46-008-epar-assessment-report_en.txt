2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information  on  the  development  program  and  the  pharmaceutical 
formulation used in the study 
Pegaspargase is a pegylated formulation of native L-asparaginase with polyethylene glycol (PEG). In this 
document pegaspargase is also called S095014 (Servier code). The use of pegaspargase in the treatment 
of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) is very well established in clinical practice and this product is 
currently approved (under the trade name Oncaspar®) in 73 countries.  
The initial marketing authorisation approvals were with the liquid presentation (i.e. USA in 01/02/1994). 
On  14  January  2016,  pegaspargase  solution  received  approval  as  a  component  of  antineoplastic 
combination  therapy  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients  with  ALL  via  the  centralised  procedure  in  the 
European Union (EU).  
The  lyophilised  powder  formulation  of  Oncaspar®,  was  approved  in  the  EU  on  08 December 2017. 
Consequently,  the  Applicant  decided  to  discontinue  the  liquid  pegaspargase  presentation;  this 
pharmaceutical  form  is  no  longer  marketed,  and  the  deletion  was  approved  on  02  June  2022.    The 
estimated cumulative exposure to Oncaspar® since the first Marketing Authorisation (MA) 01/02/1994 
to 14/01/2023 is at 193 544 patients. 
The  previously  reported  phase  2  clinical  study,  CL2-095014-002,  compared  the  PK  of  the  lyophilized 
formulation of Oncaspar® to liquid formulation during the induction phase (approximately 30 days) in 
newly diagnosed paediatric patients with ALL.  
The present study, CL2-095014-003, was designed as a roll-over study to provide continued access to 
lyophilized  formulation  of  Oncaspar®  for  patients  who  were  clinically  benefitting  from  the  study  drug 
without major toxicity and wished to continue this treatment in the following consolidation phase. 
The IV infusions of Oncaspar® were given in combination with other backbone chemotherapy agents as 
per the ALL-MB 2015 protocol.

The CL2-095014-003 study falls into the scope of article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as this is 
a  Paediatric  Study  Sponsored  by  Servier.  This  study  was  conducted  in  Russia,  where  lyophilized 
formulation of Oncaspar® was approved on 04 February 2022. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for CL2-095014-003 study. CL2-095014-003 is a multicentre, open-
label, roll-over study from the previously completed CL2-095014-002 study. It was designed to provide 
continued access to lyophilized formulation of pegaspargase (S095014) during the consolidation phase 
in  patients  who  were  clinically  benefitting  from  pegaspargase  (from  the  CL2-095014-002  study)  and 
without major toxicity following the induction phase. No efficacy or PK endpoints were assessed. 
2.2.2.  Clinical study 
CL2-095014-003 study 
Description 
A multicenter, roll-over study to provide continued treatment with lyophilized pegaspargase (S95014) 
in Pediatric Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). 
Methods 
The safety assessments (laboratory tests, ECG, cardiac imaging) and pregnancy tests performed during 
the withdrawal visit of the initial CL2-95014-002 study were used to assess the eligibility for this roll-
over study. 
75 informed consents were signed; 74 patients were treated and analyzed. 
The  study  planned  to  enroll  75  patients.  Overall  74  patients  were  treated  and  analyzed.  The  study 
duration was approximately 7 months, including the treatment and follow-up periods.  
The study plan is shown in (Figure (3.4.2) 1). The study duration was approximately 7 months, including 
the  treatment  and  follow-up  periods.  Pegaspargase  was  administered  every  two  weeks  during  the 
consolidation  phase  for  a  total  of  9  infusions,  at  weeks  7,  9,  11,  15,  17,  19,  23,  25  and  27.  The 
investigators had the choice of administering a dose of 1000, 2000 or 2500 U/m².Patients also received 
other  backbone  chemotherapy  agents  as  per  the  ALL-MB  2015  protocol.  After  completing  the 
consolidation  phase,  patients  were  discontinued  from  the  study  and  treated  as  per  investigator’s 
judgment.

The inclusion visit of CL2-095014-003 study corresponded to the withdrawal visit of the initial 
CL2-095014-002 study. 
A withdrawal visit was performed no later than 30 days after the last dose of pegaspargase during the 
consolidation phase. Patients then continued to receive the backbone chemotherapeutic regimen as per 
ALL MB 2015 protocol, and according to the physician’s judgment. A follow-up visit (either direct contact 
or by telephone) was carried out not earlier than 30 days after the last infusion of pegaspargase, except 
in case of consent withdrawal. Any follow-up of adverse events and the patient survival was recorded. 
Objective(s) 
The study was initiated on the May 15th, 2021 and completed on January 23rd, 2023. 
The primary objective of the study was: 
To provide continued access to lyophilized pegaspargase during the consolidation phase. 
A secondary objective was: 
To assess the safety profile of pegaspargase during the consolidation phase. The study was initiated on 
the May 15th, 2021 and completed on January 23rd, 2023.

Assessor’s comments 
This  roll-over  study  design  included  paediatric  population  with  newly  diagnosed,  untreated  acute 
lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL)  who  had  completed  the  CL2-95014-002  study  and  who  were  clinically 
benefitting from S95014 without major toxicity. 74 patients out of 89 patients included in the CL1-95014-
002 study continued in this roll-over study. The study indication and population are in line with the EU 
marketing authorisation of oncaspar. 
No  statistical  analysis  were  performed  in  this  study  and  the  focus  was  only on  safety  endpoints.  This 
study design is appropriate. 
Clinical Results 
Disposition of subjects 
A total of 74 patients were treated and analysed in the study. Of these, 22 (29.7%) were prematurely 
withdrawn (Table (3.4.3.1) 1): 18 due to an adverse event and 4 due to the physician’s decision. All 
analyses were performed on the Safety Analysis Set (SAS). 
In the SAS, the mean age (± SD) at baseline was 6.1 ± 3.8 years (min - max: 2 - 18), with 81.1% 
aged < 10 years old and 97.3% aged < 16 years old. Male patients represented 51.4% of the SAS. 
The majority of patients were of Caucasian origin (95.9%). The mean (± SD) BMI was 16.45 ± 3.51 
kg/m2 and mean (± SD) BSA was 0.90 ± 0.36 m2. Most patients (62.2%) had an ECOG PS of 1 at 
baseline. 
All of the investigators decided to administer pegaspargase at a dose of 1000 U/m², over a1-hour IV 
infusion (on weeks 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 23, 25 and 27). A single dose was received by 7 patients, 2 
doses only were received by 10 patients, and 3 doses only were received by 3 patients. Thus, 20/74 
patients (27%) received 3 doses or less. Except for 2 patients who received 8 doses, the remaining 
patients (52/74 [70%]) received 9 doses, as per protocol.

 Assessor’s comments 
In the CL2-095014-003 study, 74 of paediatric patients with age range of 1-18 years were treated with 
oncaspar at known therapeutic doses (1000, 2000, or 2500 UI/m2 ) every 2 weeks . 22 were withdrawn 
from the study among which 18 due to an AE and 4 due to the physician’s decision. The AEs leading to 
the study withdrawal are discussed in the section 2.2.3. 
The study paediatric population and indication are in accordance with oncaspar’s EU authorised indication 
scope.

The reported TEAEs were consistent with the known adverse reactions of S95014 and with the underlying 
pathology (ALL). 
Assessor’s comments 
The  table  12.1.2  showed  that  the  most  frequently  reported  PTs  are:  antithrombin  III  decreased  (53 
patients, 71.6%) neutropenia/ Neutrophil count decreased (62 patients, 83,7 %) and blood fibrinogen 
decreased (48 patients, 64.9%). The MAH concluded that the reported TEAEs are in accordance with the 
known profile of adverse events with S95014. 
According to oncaspar’ s SmPC, the AE antithrombin III decreased is not listed in the sections 4.8 and 
4.4 of the smpc. In the other hand, neutropenia / Neutrophil count decreased reported in 62 patients,

(83,7%)is  listed  with  unknown  frequency  in  the  section  4.8  of  the  smpc,  only  febrile  neutropenia  is 
considered as very common in the EU SmPC.  
The MAH provided as part of the study annexes the listing of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events in the 
Safety Analysis  Set  with details  concerning  AE’s  seriousness,  outcome  and  severity.  According  to  this 
data, none of the AEs in relation with antithrombin III decreased were serious, nevertheless, the MAH is 
requested  to  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  AE  and  the  need  to  update  the  product  smpc 
accordingly.  Moreover,  the  MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  the  increase  of  neutropenia/neutrophil  count 
decreased  frequencies  reported  in  this  study  which  is  not  in  accordance  with  Oncaspar’s  SmPc.  This 
discussion should be based on the cases causality assessment as well as the clinical relevance of those 
events. Update of the Smpc should be also discussed accordingly. 
We noted ,among the most frequently reported PT, the PT toxic neuropathy which concerned 5 different 
patients. This AE is not listed in the oncaspar smpc, thus, the MAH is requested to provide more details 
concerning those cases (case narratives with seriousness, causality assessment, action taken with study 
treatment, outcome and clinical relevance of those events). 
Analysis of TEAEs by intensity 
Overall, most TEAEs were rated Grade 2 (37.9%) or Grade 3 (39.0%); 11.9% of TEAEs were Grade 4 
and none were fatal. Grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported for 72 patients (97.3%).  
The  most  frequent  Grade  3/4  events  were  neutropenia  and  certain  events  pertaining  to  the  SOC 
investigations (concerning mainly coagulation parameters and raised liver enzymes). 
Grade 3/4 TEAEs were reported for 72 patients (97.3%).Grade 3/4 TEAEs reported in at least 3 patients 
are presented in Table (12.1.3) 2 by SOC and PT.

Assessor’s comments 
The analysis of TEAEs by severity regardless of the events seriousness revealed that Grade 3/4 TEAEs 
were reported for 72 (97.3%) patients. No fatal events were reported.  
The most frequent Grade 3/4 events were neutropenia (98% of the patients reporting neutropenia AEs), 
antithrombin  III  decreased  (84%  of  the  patients  reporting  antithrombin  III  AEs)  and  certain  events 
related to the SOC investigations especially ASAT increase (77% of the patients with ASAT increased), 
gamma-GT increase (87% of patients with gamma-GT increase) and blood fibrinogen decreased (43.75% 
of patients with blood fibrinogen decreased). 
Those results should be interpreted with caution regarding the number of patients included in this study 
sample  and  the  underlying  disease.  AEs  related  to  hepatotoxicity  are  in  accordance  to  the  study 
treatment  known  safety  profile.  Nevertheless  more  clarifications  are  requested  regarding  the  AEs 
neutropenia and antithrombin III as discussed previously (section Analysis of TEAEs by frequency). 
Analysis of treatment-related emergent adverse events 
Relationships of TEAEs were assessed by the investigators as: 
-Not related. 
-Related to the IMP. 
-Related to the backbone therapies. 
-Related to the study protocol (except IMP and backbone therapies).

Treatment-emergent AEs related to pegaspargase were frequent, with all patients reporting at least 
one event with a total of 546 IMP-related TEAEs.  
The  most  frequent  IMP-related  TEAEs  were  PTs  related  to  the  SOC  investigations  (mostly  concerning 
blood  coagulation)  and  PTs  related  to  the  SOC  blood  system  disorders  (low  blood  cell  counts).  These 
were mostly Grade 2 (43.0%) or Grade 3 (39.7%); 11.0% were of Grade 4. 
A total of 68 patients (91.9%) had at least one TEAE related to the IMP that was considered to be of 
Grade 3 or 4 severity. The most frequently reported events of this type were antithrombin III decreased 
(59.5%), neutropenia (48.6%), and blood fibrinogen decreased (28.4%). 
A  total  of  41  TEAEs  were  reported  for  either  hypersensitivity,  drug  hypersensitivity,  or  anaphylactic 
reaction (4.3% of all TEAEs) and these affected a total of 28 patients (37.8%). These included 32 events 
of hypersensitivity in 24 patients (31 events in 23 patients, being related to the IMP), 8 events of drug 
hypersensitivity in 6 patients (IMP related), and a single event of anaphylactic reaction (IMP related). 
Most patients (60, 81.1%) also reported at least one TEAE considered as related to backbone therapies, 
with a total of 371 events. These also mostly concerned the SOCs blood and lymphatic system disorders, 
and investigations. There were no TEAEs considered as related to the study protocol. 
Assessor’s comments

94,4% (68 out of 72) of patients experienced grade 3/4 TEAEs that were considered as related to the 
IMP.  The  most  frequently  reported  events  of  this  type  were  antithrombin  III  decreased  (59.5%), 
neutropenia (48.6%), and blood fibrinogen decreased (28.4%). 
29 (39%) of patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions (hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity, or 
anaphylactic reaction) and all TEAEs were related to IMP.  
Apart from hypersensitivity reactions and blood fibrinogen decreased that are considered as known risks 
with  oncaspar,  antithrombin  III  decreased  (not  listed  in  oncaspar  SmPC)and  neutropenia  (listed  with 
undetermined frequency) appear as the most frequently related grade ¾ TEAEs in this study. Thus, the 
MAH is requested to further discuss the cases in relation with both risks as specified previously (section 
Analysis of TEAEs by frequency). 
Emergent serious adverse events 
There were 27 patients (36.5%) who reported at least one emergent SAE during the study, with 
a total of 56 emergent SAEs. 
Most frequently, these events concerned the SOC immune system disorders (14 patients, 18.9%), mostly 
concerning  different  types  of  allergic  reactions.  This  was  followed  by  infections  and  infestations  (11 
patients, 14.9%) and blood and lymphatic system disorders (10 patients, 13.5%). 
For 14 of these events (11 patients) the upgrade to serious was made by the Sponsor: 
-Neutropenia–  6  events:  2  events  in  one  patient  in  a  context  of  laryngitis;  one  event  in  a  context  of 
sepsis SAE; one in a context of bronchitis SAE; one in a context of COVID-19 infection SAE; and one in 
a context of upper respiratory tract infection. 
-Febrile neutropenia – 2 events: one in a context of device infection; and one without any underlying 
pathology, signs or symptoms. 
-Ejection fraction decreased 1 event: asymptomatic, but LVEF of 27%. 
-Neutrophil count decreased 1 event. 
-One event each of sepsis and pneumonia fungal in a patient who had previously reported sepsis. 
-One event of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: in the patient with cellulitis gangrenous. 
-One event of leukopenia G4. 
Hypersensitivity events (including anaphylaxis) affected a total of 28 patients for 41 events. Among 
them, 15 events were serious (12 events of hypersensitivity, 2 events of drug hypersensitivity, and the 
event of anaphylactic reaction; 13 patients affected); all considered to be related to the IMP; all were 
reported as recovered. As indicated above, a total of 17 patients (23.0%) had an allergic reaction TEAE 
(related  to  the  IMP)  that  led  to  IMP  discontinuation  (8  of  the  events  were  serious).  The  incidence  of 
hypersensitivity  in  affected  individuals  did  not  appear  to  be  influenced  by  the  formulation  of 
pegaspargase they received in the qualifying study (CL2-95014-002): for 9/28 patients, the induction 
treatment in the qualifying study was the lyophilized formulation and for 19/28 patients it was the liquid 
formulation. 
Treatment-emergent  SAEs  considered  to  be  related  to  pegaspargase  affected  16  patients 
(21,6%) with   total of 18 events: 
Hypersensitivity: 12 events of 11 patients (14.9%). 
Drug hypersensitivity: 2 events in 1 patient (1.4%). 
Anaphylactic reaction: 1 event in 1 patient (1.4%). 
Oedematous pancreatitis: 1 event in 1 patient (1.4%). 
Hepatotoxicity: 1 event in 1 patient (1.4%). 
Neutropenia: 1 event in 1 patient (1.4%).

For 10 patients, the action taken was “IMP discontinuation”; the 8 patients reporting hypersensitivity, 
and the patients reporting drug hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reaction. 
No deaths were reported during the study. 
Assessor’s comments 
Serious adverse events related to IMP concerned 16 patients (21,6%). 15 (83,33%)  out of the 18 total 
number  of  serious  adverse  events  related  to  the  IMP  reported  hypersensitivity  reactions 
(hypersensitivity,  drug  hypersensitivity,  or  anaphylactic  reaction)  in  13  patients.  among  which  10 
patients discontinued IMP treatment.  
The remaining 3 events reported respectively 1 event of Oedematous pancreatitis, 1 of hepatotoxicity 
and 1 event of neutropenia in 3 different patients. 
Related SAEs reported are in accordance with the known safety profile of oncaspar. 
Analysis of emergent adverse events according to action taken 
Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation affected 18 patients 
(24.3%; for 18 events):

A  total  of  67  patients  (90.5%)  reported  a  TEAE  requiring  additional  therapy.  In  addition,  5  patients 
(6.8%) reported a total of 8 TEAEs requiring a surgical or medical procedure. 
In addition, 4 patients were withdrawn from treatment due to the investigator’s decision: 
Patient 1: had hypersensitivity reactions (3 events), of grade 1 or 2 and was withdrawn on day 64. 
Patient  2:  had  a  drug  hypersensitivity  reaction  and  a  hypersensitivity  reaction  (2  separate  visits),  of 
grade 2 and was withdrawn on day 56. 
Patient 3: had numerous TEAEs (mostly under the SOC investigations) but more importantly neutropenic 
sepsis  (2  events),  cellulitis  gangrenous  and  haemophagocytic  lymphohistiocytosis  (all  4  events  were 
SAE); the action taken was “new treatment or dose modification of ongoing treatment other than IMP 
and backbone therapies” and the patient was withdrawn on day 246. 
Patient  4:  had  several  blood  related  disorders  (grade  2  or  3)  including  neutropenia,anaemia, 
hypertriglyceridaemia, as well as increased liver enzymes. A change of treatment protocol was advised 
at W11 and the patient was withdrawn. 
Assessor’s comments 
We  noted  18  patients  with  AEs  leading  to  treatment  withdrawal.  17  out  of  18  treatment  withdrawals 
were related to hypersensitivity reactions. 10 out of the 17 events /patients were serious adverse events 
related  to  IMP.  The  risk  of  hypersensitivity  and  anaphylactic  reaction  is  known  with  oncaspar  and 
considered as a very common risk. Thus, no new signal emerges from the provided data. 
  Clinical laboratory results 
Emergent abnormal laboratory values were generally reported as AEs and analyzed as such. There were 
no unexpected changes observed in the mean values of observed parameters. 
The mean values for biochemistry parameters were generally consistent with ALL. 
Clinically significant abnormal values

The most frequently reported emergent Grade ≥ 3 abnormal values concerned GGT (32 patients overall, 
43.2%), ALT (25 patients, 33.8%) and hypertriglyceridemia (14 patients, 18.9%). No emergent Grade 
≥  3  values  were  observed  for  bicarbonate,  glucose,  alkaline  phosphatase,  creatinine  or  lactate 
dehydrogenase. 
The  most  frequently  reported  emergent  Grade  ≥  3  abnormal  values  concerned  anemia  (16  patients, 
21.6%;  all  Grade  3),  white  blood  cells  decreased  (16  patients  overall,  21.6%),  hemoglobin  increased 
(10 patients, 13.5%) and low lymphocyte counts (9 patients overall, 12.2%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  emergent  Grade  3  values  concerned  low  fibrinogen  levels  (16  patients, 
21.6%). There were no Grade 4 events. 
  Vital signs and ECOG PS 
The assessments of vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP, HR and body temperature) indicated no clinically 
relevant  differences  over  time  from  baseline.  There  was  no  deterioration  in  ECOG  PS  over  time.  The 
analyses of the change in systolic and diastolic BP, HR and body temperature, from baseline to each visit 
as well as baseline to withdrawal/end-of-study show no meaningful trends or issues 
Assessor’s comments 
The most frequently reported emergent Grade ≥ 3 abnormal values are in line with the known safety 
profile of S95014. No grade 4 values were reported. We noted also no deterioration in ECOG performance 
status over time. However, the MAH did not mention the antithrombine III decreased among the most 
frequently reported abnormal values while it was reported as the most frequently Grade 3/4 events. This 
should be clarified. 
Conclusion on Safety 
No new safety concerns for S95014 were detected and it was well tolerated. No fatal events were 
reported during the study. Hypersensitivity reactions were the main AE leading withdrawal of the study 
treatment, with a total of 17 patients (23.0%) being withdrawn for these reactions. The safety profile 
observed in this study is consistent with the known safety profile of pegaspargase. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  CL2-95014-003  study  was  a  “roll-over”  study,  designed  to  provide  continued  access  to  S95014 
during  the  consolidation  phase  in  patients  who  completed  the  CL2-95014-002  study  and  who  were 
clinically benefitting from S95014 without major toxicity. The CL2-95014-003 study was initiated on the 
May 15th, 2021 and completed on January 23rd, 2023. 
No efficacy or PK endpoints were assessed and the safety endpoints were analysed in the Safety Analysis 
Set (SAS). 
The  study  planned  to  enroll  75  patients.  Overall  74  patients  were  treated  and  analysed.  The  study 
duration was approximately 7 months, including the treatment and follow-up periods. In the SAS, the 
mean age (± SD) at baseline was 6.1 ± 3.8 years (min - max: 2 - 18), with 81.1% aged < 10 years old 
and 97.3% aged < 16 years old. Male patients represented 51.4% of the SAS. The majority of patients 
were of Caucasian origin (95.9%).  
Pegaspargase was administered every two weeks during the consolidation phase for a total of 9 infusions, 
Patients  also  received  other  backbone  chemotherapy  agents  as  per  the  ALL-MB  2015  protocol.  20/74 
patients  (27%)  received  3  doses  or  less.  Except  for  2  patients  who  received  8  doses,  the  remaining 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/56595/2024  
Page 16/25 
 
 
 
 
patients  (52/74  [70%])  received  9  doses,  as  per  protocol.  After  completing  the  consolidation  phase, 
patients were discontinued from the study and treated as per investigator’s judgment. 
22  (29.7%)  were  prematurely  withdrawn:  18  due  to  an  adverse  event  and  4  due  to  the  physician’s 
decision. 
Regarding the safety results, all 74 (100%) patients of the SAS had at least one TEAE during the study, 
for a total of 954 events. There were 56 serious emergent events, none fatal.  
The most frequently affected SOCs were Investigations (59 patients, 79.7%) and Blood and lymphatic 
systemic disorders (55 patients, 74.3%). Overall, most TEAEs were rated Grade 2 (37.9%) or Grade 3 
(39.0%);  11.9%  of  TEAEs  were  Grade  4  and  none  was  fatal.  Nevertheless,  Grade  3/4  TEAEs  were 
reported for 72 patients (97.3%) and 94,4% (68 out of 72) of patients experienced grade 3/4 TEAEs 
that were considered as related to the IMP. Those results should be interpreted with caution because of 
the study sample size and the patient’s underlying disease. 
The  most  frequently  reported  PTs  are:  antithrombin  III  decreased  (53  patients,  71.6%)  neutropenia/ 
Neutrophil count decreased (62 patients, 83,7 %) and blood fibrinogen decreased (48 patients, 64.9%).  
According to oncaspar’ s SmPC, Only blood fibrinogen decreased is listed with frequency “very common” 
in  oncaspar  Smpc.  the  AE  antithrombin  III  decreased  is  not  listed  in  the  sections  4.8  and  4.4  of  the 
smpc. In the other hand, neutropenia / Neutrophil count decreased reported in 62 patients, (83,7%)is 
listed with unknown frequency in the section 4.8 of the smpc and only febrile neutropenia is considered 
as very common in the EU SmPC.  
The MAH is requested to discuss the clinical relevance of AEs reporting antithrombin III decreased with 
regard to the cases causality assessment and severity in order to evaluate the need to update the product 
smpc accordingly. Moreover, the MAH is also requested to discuss the increase of neutropenia/neutrophil 
count decreased’s frequency reported in this study which is not in accordance with Oncaspar’s SmPc. 
This discussion should be based on the cases causality assessment as well as the clinical relevance of 
those events. Smpc ‘s update should be also discussed accordingly. 
Toxic neuropathy were reported among the most frequently reported PT in this study and was reported 
in 5 patients. Considering that this AE is not listed in the oncaspar smpc,, the MAH is requested to provide 
more  details  concerning  those  cases  (case  narratives  with  seriousness,  causality  assessment,  action 
taken with study treatment, outcome and clinical relevance of those events). 
29  out  of  74  (39%)  patients  experienced  hypersensitivity  reactions  (hypersensitivity,  drug 
hypersensitivity, or anaphylactic reaction) and all TEAEs were related to IMP. 
Serious adverse events related to IMP concerned 16 patients (21,6%). 15 (83,33%)  out of the 18 total 
number of serious adverse events related to the IMP reported hypersensitivity reactions.  
We  noted  18  patients  with  AEs  leading  to  treatment  withdrawal.  17  out  of  18  treatment  withdrawals 
were related to hypersensitivity reactions. 10 out of the 17 events /patients were serious adverse events 
related to IMP. 
Hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) concerned 39% of the patients (29 patients) among which 55% reported 
serious  related  adverse  events.  34.5%  of  the  patients  (10  patients)  with  HSR  reactions  have  been 
discontinued  due  to  these  SAEs.  HSR  are  a  known  risk  of  oncaspar  and  are  listed  in  the  SmPC  with 
frequency “very common”. The results of this study doesn’t reveal a new trend concerning this risk. 
With regards to lab data, the most frequently reported emergent Grade ≥ 3 abnormal values are in line 
with the known safety profile of S95014. No grade 4 values were reported. However, the MAH did not 
mention the antithrombine III decreased among the most frequently reported abnormal values while it 
was reported as the most frequently Grade 3/4 events. This should be clarified.

We noted also no deterioration in ECOG performance status over time. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
The safety results of lyophilized Oncaspar in the CL2-095014-003 paediatric study should be interpreted 
with  caution  regarding  the  study  descriptive  design,  the  population  sample  size  and  the  underlying 
disease.  Moreover,  more  clarifications  are  needed  from  the  MAH  to  better  conclude  about  the  SmPC 
amendments required at this stage. 
  Fulfilled 
  Not fulfilled 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide clarification for considering the reported TEAEs 
as consistent with the known adverse reactions of S95014 as part of this procedure. (see section 
“Request for supplementary information”) 
4.  Request for supplementary information (RSI) 
4.1.  Major objections 
NA 
4.2.  Other concerns 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure: 
1)  Low  antithrombin  activity  is  considered  as  the  most  frequently  reported  AEs  with  oncaspar  in 
this  study.  Of  note,  results  of  the  previous  study,  CL2-095014-002  showed  also  a  higher 
frequency  of  Low  antithrombin  activity  with  lyophilized  formulation  (LYO)  of  Oncaspar® 
compared to the liquid formulation.  
According to oncaspar’s SmPC, the AE antithrombin III decreased is not listed in the sections 4.8 
and  4.4  of  the  smpc.  The  MAH  is  requested  to  discuss  the  clinical  relevance  of  AEs  reporting 
antithrombin III decreased with regard to the cases causality assessment and severity in order 
to evaluate the need to update the product smpc accordingly. 
2)  The  MAH  is  also  requested  to  discuss  the  increase  of  neutropenia/neutrophil  count  decreased 
frequency reported in this study which is not in accordance with Oncaspar’s SmPc. This discussion 
should  be  based  on  the  cases  causality  assessment  as  well  as  the  clinical  relevance  of  those 
events. Update of Smpc should be also discussed accordingly. 
3)  Toxic  neuropathy  were  reported  among  the  most  frequently  reported  PT  in  this  study  and 
concerned  5  patients. Considering that this AE is not listed in the oncaspar  smpc, the MAH is 
requested  to  provide  more  details  concerning  those  cases  (case  narratives  with  seriousness, 
causality assessment, action taken with study treatment, outcome and clinical relevance of those 
events). 
4.3.  MS comment

RSI question 1 is supported. Furthermore, in the previously reported phase 2 clinical study, CL2-095014-
002, where lyophilized formulation (LYO) of Oncaspar®  was compared against the liquid formulation 
(LIQ), the frequency of Low antithrombin activity was seen more often in the LYO group than the LIQ 
group: 35/43 patients (81.4%) versus 27/43 patients (62.8%) at Day 10; 35/41 patients (85.4%) versus 
25/43 patients (58.1%) at Day 17; and 26/41 patients (63.4%) versus 17/42 patients (40.5%) at Day 
24. The applicant should also discuss the possible reasons for this difference in frequencies between the 
two formulations and the clinical relevance of this finding.  
In addition, the results of the studies CL2-095014-002 and CL2-095014-003 should be discussed within 
the  next  PSUR,  particularly  with  respect  to  the  detected  inconsistencies'  with  the  current  SmPC  of 
Oncaspar. 
Rapp comment 
Rapp thanks the MS for the raised comment. It’s agreed that the results of the study CL2-095014-002 
showed higher frequency of Low antithrombin activity with lyophilized formulation (LYO) of Oncaspar® 
compared to the liquid formulation. Nevertheless, in the CL2-095014-003 study, the study design and 
treatment regimen are different (non- comparative study, different study drug dosage), thus we would 
suggest to keep the question focused on the latter study context and results.  
Moreover, as suggested, further discussion is anticipated in the next PSUR.   
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop 
4.4.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question N°1: 
Low antithrombin activity is considered as the most frequently reported AEs with oncaspar in this study. 
Of  note,  results  of  the  previous  study,  CL2-095014-002,showed  also  a  higher  frequency  of  Low 
antithrombin activity with lyophilized formulation (LYO) of Oncaspar® compared to the liquid formulation.  
According to oncaspar’s SmPC, the AE antithrombin III decreased is not listed in the sections 4.8 and 
4.4 of the smpc. The MAH is requested to discuss the clinical relevance of AEs reporting antithrombin III 
decreased with regard to the cases causality assessment and severity in order to evaluate the need to 
update the product smpc accordingly. 
MAH’s response: 
In study CL2-95014-003, 74 patients were treated with Oncaspar lyophilized formulation. One hundred 
and fifty-seven (157) “antithrombin III decreased” treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related 
to Oncaspar (i.e., related to Oncaspar only or to Oncaspar and backbone therapy) were reported for 53 
patients, which represents 71.6% of treated patients. This is indeed the most frequent related TEAEs for 
this  study.  None  of  these  AEs  were  reported  as  serious.  Among  the  53  patients,  31  had  received 
corticosteroids  (dexamethasone,  methylprednisolone,  prednisolone)  to  prevent  or  relieve  allergic 
reactions while under treatment with Oncaspar. This observation is aligned with current EU SmPC Section 
4.5: When glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) and pegaspargase are given at the same time, alterations 
in coagulation parameters (e.g., fall in fibrinogen and antithrombin III deficiency, ATIII) can be more 
pronounced. For the remaining 22 patients, no glucocorticoid was taken as concomitant medication. Yet, 
all  patients  were  treated  with  dexamethasone  as  part  of  the  backbone  therapy  of  the  ALL-MB  2015 
protocol.  
In study CL2-95014-002, 88 patients received one infusion of Oncaspar (43 with lyophilizate formulation 
and 45 with liquid formulation). Fifty-nine (59) “antithrombin III decrease” TEAEs related to Oncaspar 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/56595/2024  
Page 19/25 
 
 
 
 
 
were reported for 59 patients (one event per patient), which represents 67% of treated patients. Among 
the 59 AE, 31 AEs for 31 patients are reported in the lyophilized arm (72.1% of patients) and 28 AEs for 
28  patients  (62.2%  of  patients)  are  reported  in  the  liquid  arm.  This  AE  is  the  second  most  frequent 
related TEAE of this study, whatever the treatment arm. Similarly to study CL2-95014-003, 5 patients 
among the 59 received corticosteroids while under treatment with Oncaspar (3 from the lyophilized arm, 
and 2 from the liquid arm) and all patients received dexamethasone as part of ALL-MB 2015 protocol. 
There were 3 treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) of antithrombin III decreased reported 
for 3 patients (3.4% of treated patients): they were not reported as serious by investigators, and were 
upgraded to “serious” by the sponsor. These three related SAE were of Grade 4 in severity and concerned 
2 patients in the lyophilized arm and 1 patient in the liquid arm.  
Thus, occurrence of “Antithrombin III decreased” in both studies is related to Oncaspar but two factors 
could partly explain the relatively high occurrence in these trials: 
- 
- 
intake of glucocorticoids as concomitant medication or as part of the backbone chemotherapy 
agents outlined in the ALL-MB 2015 protocol on top of Oncaspar, 
ALLMB 2015 protocol requiring a measurement of antithrombin III levels before each infusion 
(MB-protocol section 29.8 / 29.13), which can lead to a higher AE detection compared to other 
protocols using asparaginase at same dose of 1000 IU/m2 (e.g. the UKALL and NOPHO protocols 
require follow-up of thromboembolism AEs but not specifically level in antithrombin III before 
each infusion).  
Currently, risks of “coagulopathy” and “blood fibrinogen decreased” associated with Oncaspar are listed 
in  the  EU  SmPC  sections  4.4  and  4.8.    It  is  also  mentioned  in  section  4.4:  “When  there  is  a  marked 
decrease in fibrinogen or antithrombin III (ATIII) deficiency, consider appropriate replacement therapy”. 
The risk of antithrombin III decreased is reported when Oncaspar is associated with glucocorticoids in 
the EU SmPC section 4.5.  
Despite these potential reasons, relationship to Oncaspar cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the MAH agrees 
to add AE “Antithrombin III decreased” based on frequency observed in the CL2-95014-002 and CL2-
95014-003  studies.  As  the  frequency  of  antithrombin  III  AE  related  to  Oncaspar  is  67%  of  treated 
patients (59 over 88 treated patients) in the 002 study, and 71.6 % of patients (53 over 74 patients) in 
the 003 study. Thus, the MAH proposes to add the AE “antithrombin III decrease” with the frequency 
“very common” (frequency ≥1/10) in section 4.8 of the EU SmPC.   
Proposed Updates of the Product Information: 
MAH proposes to update sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the EU SmPC of Oncaspar as follows: 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
(…) 
Coagulopathy 
Serious  thrombotic  events,  including  sagittal  sinus  thrombosis  can  occur  in  patients  receiving 
pegaspargase  (see  section 4.8).  Oncaspar  should  be  discontinued  in  patients  with  serious  thrombotic 
events. 
Increased prothrombin time (PT), increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and hypofibrinogenaemia 
and antithrombin III decrease can occur in patients receiving pegaspargase. Coagulation parameters 
should  be  monitored  at  baseline  and  periodically  during  and  after  treatment,  particularly  when  other 
medicinal  products  with  anticoagulant  effects  (such  as  acetylsalicylic  acid  and  non-steroidal  anti-
inflammatory  medicinal  products)  are  used  simultaneously  (see  section  4.5),  or  when  concomitant

there  is  a  marked  decrease  in  fibrinogen  or  antithrombin  III  (ATIII)  deficiency,  consider  appropriate

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The adverse reactions described in this section are derived from clinical studies data and post-marketing 
experience  of  Oncaspar  in  ALL  patients.  The  safety  profile  is  based  on  randomised,  controlled, 
prospective,  open  label  multicentre  studies  using  Oncaspar  at  a  dose  of  2500 U/m2  administered 
intravenously as a comparative treatment (studies DFCI 11-001 and AALL07P4). In addition, the safety 
profile included data from other Oncaspar studies such as the study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 
the liquid and the lyophilized formulations of pegaspargase (CL2-95014-002), its roll-over study (CL2-
95014-003)  and  studies  using  the  intramuscular  route  of  administration  (studies  CCG-1962  and 
CCG-1991) (see section 5.1 for CCG-1962 and CCG-1991).

The MAH proposes not to update the Patient Leaflet because blood clots are mentioned as “very common” 
in section 4 “possible side effects”. In addition, a warning about the risk of coagulopathy is explained in 
section 2 under paragraph “Warnings and precautions” as follows:  
“This medicine can lead to fluctuations in clotting factors and may increase the risk of bleeding and/or 
clotting.”  
Assessor’s comments 
The MAH confirmed that “antithrombin III decreased” treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are 
the most frequent related TEAEs with oncaspar in both studies CL2-95014-003 and CL2-95014-002 and 
proposed consequently an update of the oncaspar smpc in order to include this risk in the section 4.4 as 
follows: 
Coagulopathy: 
Serious  thrombotic  events,  including  sagittal  sinus  thrombosis  can  occur  in  patients  receiving 
pegaspargase  (see  section  4.8).  Oncaspar  should  be  discontinued  in  patients  with  serious  thrombotic 
events. 
Increased prothrombin time (PT), increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and hypofibrinogenaemia 
and antithrombin III decrease can occur in patients receiving pegaspargase. Coagulation parameters 
should  be  monitored  at  baseline  and  periodically  during  and  after  treatment,  particularly  when  other 
medicinal  products  with  anticoagulant  effects  (such  as  acetylsalicylic  acid  and  non-steroidal  anti-

inflammatory  medicinal  products)  are  used  simultaneously  (see  section  4.5),  or  when  concomitant 
chemotherapy regimen including methotrexate, daunorubicin, corticosteroids is administered.  
When  there  is  a  marked  decrease  in  fibrinogen  or  antithrombin  III  (ATIII)  deficiency,  consider 
appropriate replacement therapy. 
The MAH proposed also to update the section 4.8 in order to add the risk of “antithrombin III decreased” 
among  the  most  commonly  reported  AEs  in  the  SOC  “investigations”  according  to  the  recent  clinical 
studies (CL2-95014-002 and CL2-95014-003) data. 
We agree with the MAH’s proposal to update both product SmPC’s sections 4.4 and 4.8. 
The MAH should submit a relevant variation in a timely manner to update the product SmPC accordingly. 
Question N°2: 
The MAH is also requested to discuss the increase of neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased frequency 
reported in this study which is not in accordance with Oncaspar’s SmPC. This discussion should be based 
on  the  cases  causality  assessment  as  well  as  the  clinical  relevance  of  those  events.  Update  of  Smpc 
should be also discussed accordingly. 
MAH’s response: 
In  study  CL2-95014-003,  74  patients  were  treated  with  Oncaspar.  Seventy-two  (72)  “neutropenia” 
TEAEs related to Oncaspar (i.e. related to Oncaspar only or to Oncaspar and backbone therapy) were 
reported  for  37  patients,  which  represents  50.0%  of  treated  patients.  Seven  (7)  “neutrophil  count 
decreased”  TEAEs  related  to  Oncaspar  (i.e.,  related  to  Oncaspar  only  or  to  Oncaspar  and  backbone 
therapy)  were  reported  for  5  patients,  which  represents  6.8%  of  treated  patients.  Thus,  the  total 
frequency  of  “neutropenia”  and  “neutrophil  count  decrease”  related  to  Oncaspar  is  56.8%  of  treated 
patients (42 patients with these related TEAEs over 74 treated patients). 
The 72 related TEAEs with preferred term “neutropenia” were of grade 2 to 4 and all reported as non-
serious except for one patient where event “neutropenia” of grade 4 seriousness was upgraded by the 
sponsor to “serious” as following an event of sepsis. The 7 TEAEs with preferred term “neutrophil count 
decreased”  were  of  grade  3  to  4  and  all  reported  as  non-serious  AEs  associated  with 
neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased are reported with no associated symptom. No action taken with 
study treatment (referred as “IMP” in the CSR) was reported for these events. Thus, these AEs do not 
have a significant clinical relevance on patients. 
Considering  the  overall  frequency  of  56.8%  for  treatment-related  neutropenia  and  neutrophil  count 
decreases reported in the CL2-95014-003 study, the MAH agrees to update the frequency of neutrophil 
count decrease in the Oncaspar SmPC from “not known” to “very common” (frequency ≥1/10) in section 
4.8 of the EU SmPC. As neutropenia is a synonym of neutrophil counts decrease, only neutrophil count 
decrease terminology is used for update in the Oncaspar EU SmPC. 
Proposed Updates of the Product Information: 
The MAH proposes to update section 4.8 of the EU SmPC of Oncaspar as follows:

Assessor’s comments 
The  MAH  confirmed 
that  50%  of 
the  CL2-95014-003  study  population  experimented 
neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased related to oncaspar and proposed to amend the frequency of 
this risk in the section 4.8 from “not known” to “very common”. Moreover, the MAH proposed to amend 
the section 4 of the patient’s leaflet accordingly. The MAH’s proposals FOR SmPC update are endorsed. 
The MAH should submit a relevant variation in a timely manner to update the product SmPC accordingly. 
Question N°3: 
Toxic neuropathy were reported among the most frequently reported PT in this study and concerned 5 
patients. Considering that this AE is not listed in the oncaspar smpc, the MAH is requested to provide 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/56595/2024  
Page 23/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more  details  concerning  those  cases  (case  narratives  with  seriousness,  causality  assessment,  action 
taken with study treatment, outcome and clinical relevance of those events). 
MAH’s response: 
In the study CL2-95014-003, 5 “toxic neuropathy” TEAE were reported for 5 patients, which represent 
6.8%  of  treated  patients.    None  of  the  cases  of  toxic  neuropathy  reported  were  related  to  Oncaspar. 
Summary information contained in CSR listing provide the following information: preferred term, grade, 
start/stop dates, seriousness, causality assessment, outcome, and action taken with study treatment. 
All AEs were reported as related to the backbone therapies, mostly vincristine, for which neurotoxicity is 
a known AE. These AE severities varied from grade 1 to 2 and were reported as “non-serious”. No dose 
interruption or dose modification of Oncaspar occurred due to these events. All AE are recovered, and 
no sequelae was reported. No narrative is available for these events as they did not meet criteria for 
narrative  writing  (criteria  such  as  death,  serious  AE,  event  of  special  interest,  AE  leading  to  study 
treatment discontinuation).  
Oncaspar EU SmPC contains information regarding central nervous system disorders: 
-  Section  4.4:  “Oncaspar  may  cause  central  nervous  system  signs  and  symptoms  manifesting  as 
somnolence, confusion, convulsions. Patients should be closely monitored for such symptoms, especially 
if Oncaspar is used in association with neurotoxic products (such as vincristine and methotrexate; see 
section 4.5);  
-  section  4.5:  “Immediately  preceding  or  simultaneous  treatment  with  vincristine  can  increase  the 
toxicity of pegaspargase. Administration of Oncaspar before vincristine may increase the neurotoxicity 
of vincristine. Therefore, vincristine should be given at least 12 hours prior to administration of Oncaspar 
in order to minimise toxicity.”, 
- section 4.8: “peripheral motor neuropathy” is listed, 
In summary, AE of toxic neuropathy are reported by investigators as not related to Oncaspar but rather 
to concomitant chemotherapy known to induce neurotoxicity. Thus, the MAH proposes not to add the AE 
"toxic neuropathy" to the EU SmPC. 
Assessor’s comments 
The MAH clarified that the 5 cases of toxic neuropathy were not serious, not related to  oncaspar and 
didn’t require oncaspar’s  interruption  or dose modification. The narratives were not provided  because 
the cases did not meet criteria for narrative writing. The MAH added also that neurological disorders are 
adequately described in oncaspar’s SmPC (section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). 
The MAH’s response is approvable. 
4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects after first RSI assessment 
The MAH was requested to discuss the clinical relevance of AEs reporting antithrombin III decreased with 
regard to the cases causality assessment and severity in order to evaluate the need to update the product 
smpc  accordingly.  Moreover, 
the  MAH  was  also  requested 
to  discuss 
the 
increase  of 
neutropenia/neutrophil  count  decreased’s  frequency  reported  in  this  study  which  is  not  in  accordance 
with Oncaspar’s SmPc. The MAH confirmed as part of the RSI responses that “antithrombin III decreased” 
treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are the most frequent related TEAEs with oncaspar in both 
studies CL2-95014-003 and CL2-95014-002 and proposed consequently an update of the oncaspar smpc 
in order to include this risk in the section 4.4 and in the section 4.8 of the SmPC. In the other hand, the 
MAH confirmed that 50% of the CL2-95014-003 study population experimented neutropenia/neutrophil 
count decreased related to oncaspar and proposed to amend the frequency of this risk in the section 4.8 
from “not known” to “very common” and to amend the PL accordingly.

Toxic neuropathy was reported among the most frequently reported PT in this study and was reported 
in 5 patients. Considering that this AE is not listed in the oncaspar SmPC, the MAH was requested to 
provide  more  details  concerning  those  cases  (case  narratives  with  seriousness,  causality  assessment, 
action taken with study treatment, outcome and clinical relevance of those events). The MAH clarified 
that  the  5  cases  of  toxic  neuropathy  were  not  serious,  not  related  to  Oncaspar  and  didn’t  require 
oncaspar’s  interruption  or  dose  modification.  The  narratives  were  not  provided  because  the  cases  did 
not meet criteria for narrative writing. The MAH added also that neurological disorders are adequately 
described in oncaspar’s SmpC (section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). 
The proposed change in the SmPC are agreed and the relevant variation to include them as per general 
guidance on P46 procedure should be provided in a timely manner. 
5.  Overall conclusion and recommendation after first RSI 
The safety results of lyophilized Oncaspar in the CL2-095014-003 paediatric study should be interpreted 
with  caution  regarding  the  study  descriptive  design,  the  population  sample  size  and  the  underlying 
disease. SmPc amendments were proposed by the MAH as part of RSI response and are approved. The 
MAH should submit a relevant variation in a timely manner to update the product SmPC accordingly.

Update of Section 4.4 of the SmPC with a subsection 
14/10/2021 
18/11/2021 
SmPC and PL 
A higher number of intraocular inflammation events were 
on intraocular inflammation and update of the 
warning on intraocular inflammation including retinal 
vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, and 
update of Section 4.8 of the SmPC to update the 
frequency of the ADRs “Retinal vasculitis” and 
“Retinal vascular occlusion” to “uncommon”; to 
merge “Retinal artery occlusion” and “retinal vascular 
occlusion” into “retinal vascular occlusion”; and to 
update the description of immunogenicity. All of this 
is based on the final results of 2 retrospective real 
world studies that evaluated patients with nAMD for 
up to 6 months after initiating treatment with 
brolucizumab and a mechanistic study BASICHR0049 
that identified an immune cause of intraocular 
inflammation including retinal vasculitis and retinal 
vascular occlusion. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. The updated RMP version 7.0 has also 
been submitted. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
observed among patients with treatment-emergent 
antibodies. After investigation, retinal vasculitis and/or 
retinal vascular occlusion were found to be immune 
mediated events. Intraocular inflammation, including 
retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, may 
occur following the first intravitreal injection and at any 
time of treatment. These events were observed more 
frequently at the beginning of the treatment. 
Based on clinical studies, these events were more frequent 
in female patients treated with Beovu than male patients 
(e.g. 5.3% females vs. 3.2% males in HAWK and HARRIER) 
and in Japanese patients. 
Patients treated with Beovu with a medical history of 
intraocular inflammation and/or retinal vascular occlusion 
(within 12 months prior to the first brolucizumab injection) 
should be closely monitored, since they are at increased 
risk of developing retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular 
occlusion. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

Update of section 4.2 of the SmPC to update the 
14/10/2021

SmPC and PL 
The interval between two Beovu doses during maintenance 
wording of the posology, following the assessment of 
procedure EMEA/H/C/004913/II/0002. In addition, 
section 4.4 of the SmPC is updated to inform that the 
interval between two Beovu doses during 
maintenance treatment should not be less than every 
treatment should not be less than 8 weeks considering that 
a higher incidence of intraocular inflammation (including 
retinal vasculitis) and retinal vascular occlusion was 
reported in patients with nAMD who received Beovu every 4 
week maintenance dosing in a clinical study compared to 
Page 5/8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 weeks as warranted and the Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. Furthermore, the marketing 
authorisation holder has taken the opportunity to 
implement minor editorial changes in section 6.5 of 
the SmPC. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that this variation 
implements changes to the decision granting the 
marketing authorisation due to a significant public 
health concern. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

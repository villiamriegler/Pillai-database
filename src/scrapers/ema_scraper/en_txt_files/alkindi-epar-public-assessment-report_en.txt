authorisation to Alkindi on 14 December 2017. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The  reference  medicinal  product  for  Alkindi  is  Hydrocortisone  Tablets,  10  mg  (United  Kingdom)  –  PL 
17507/0246 (1989).  
In indication of the reference medicinal product is the following: 
“Corticosteroid. 
For use as replacement therapy in primary, secondary, or acute adrenocortical insufficiency. 
Preoperatively, and during serious trauma or illness in patients with known adrenal insufficiency or doubtful 
adrenocortical reserve. “ 
The main differences in Alkindi compared to the reference medicinal product are: 
•  Change in pharmaceutical form 
•  Change in strength 
• 
Indication in replacement therapy in paediatric patients only.   
The present hybrid application for a PUMA (Paediatric use marketing authorisation) concerns a paediatric-
specific  formulation  (granules  in  capsules  for  opening)  of  immediate-release  hydrocortisone  (IRHC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 9/59 
  
  
 
The  initial  indication  claimed  by  the  Applicant  was  “for  treatment  of  the  0-6  year  patient  group”.  Upon 
request of the CHMP the indication has been widened to contain the full paediatric population (from birth to 
<18 years old).  
The clinical development plan for Alkindi comprised of two key components: (1) an investigation of the safety 
and  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  of  Alkindi  in  adults  to  ascertain  the  exposure  and  optimal  dosing  in  the 
target paediatric population and to establish bioequivalence to the current standard IRHC, and (2) an 
investigation  of  cortisol  levels  after  dosing  with  Alkindi  in  the  target  paediatric  population  with  reference  to 
the  established  PK  and  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  knowledge  already  in  place  for  the  use  of  hydrocortisone  in 
the AI indication and palatability in the 0-6 years patient group.  
The initially proposed therapeutic indication was (identical to the reference medicinal product): 
“Alkindi is indicated in neonates, infants and children less than 6 years. 
• 
• 
For use as replacement therapy in primary, secondary, or acute adrenal insufficiency. 
Pre-operatively, and during serious trauma or illness in patients with known adrenal insufficiency or 
doubtful adrenal reserve.” 
During the procedure the CHMP has suggested that a more simplified wording of the therapeutic indication 
could be agreed and proposed the “Replacement therapy of adrenal insufficiency in infants, children and 
adolescents (from birth to < 18 years old).” The CHMP considered that “preoperatively, and during serious 
trauma or illness in patients with known adrenal insufficiency or doubtful adrenocortical reserve” included in 
the wording of the indication of the reference medicinal product is covered by “replacement therapy of 
adrenal insufficiency” wording of the indication.    
Also, the applicant has addressed the extrapolation of the available data for the initial claim of the indication 
to the group of children > 6 years (see Conclusions on clinical efficacy section of this report). The CHMP 
agreed with the extrapolation exercise and that the product could be indicated in the entire age spectrum of 
the paediatric population. The following indication was approved for Alkindi:  
“Replacement therapy of adrenal insufficiency in infants, children and adolescents (from birth to < 18 years 
old).”  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Primary  adrenal  insufficiency  (PAI)  is  defined  by  the  inability  of  the  adrenal  cortex  to  produce  sufficient 
amounts  of  glucocorticoids  and/or  mineralocorticoids.  PAI  is  a  severe  and  potentially  life-threatening 
condition due to the central role of these hormones in energy, salt, and fluid homeostasis. Cortisol deficiency 
results in a decrease in feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and subsequent enhanced stimulation of 
the adrenal cortex by elevated levels of plasma ACTH. The signs of PAI are mainly based on the deficiency of 
gluco-  and  mineralocorticoids  and  the  resultant  weight  loss,  orthostatic  hypotension  due  to 
dehydration,  hyponatremia,  hyperkalemia,  changes  in  blood  count  (anemia,  eosinophilia, 
lymphocytosis), and hypoglycaemia. 
The most common cause of PAI is autoimmunity (up to 90% in Western countries), followed by infectious 
diseases  such  as  tuberculosis,  adrenalectomy,  neoplasia,  and  various  genetic  causes;  the  last  are 
more  likely  to  be  present  and  diagnosed  in  children.  In  fact,  the  non-autoimmune  cases  of  PAI  are  more 
frequently  seen  among  children  and  the  elderly  and  congenital  adrenal  hyperplasia  (CAH)  due  to  21-
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 10/59 
  
  
 
hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of adrenal insufficiency in infancy (Bornstein et al., 2016; 
Speiser et al., 2010). This is reflected in the patient group recruited for the pivotal Infacort trial, where 23/24 
patients presented with CAH.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Primary adrenal insufficiency PAI is a rare disease with a reported prevalence of about 100 to 140 cases per 
million and an incidence of 4:1 000 000 per year in Western societies (Bornstein et al., 2016). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Except  for  salt  craving,  the  symptoms  of  PAI  are  rather  nonspecific  and  include  weakness,  fatigue, 
musculoskeletal  pain,  weight  loss,  abdominal  pain,  depression,  and  anxiety.  As  a  result,  the  diagnosis  is 
frequently delayed, resulting in a clinical presentation with an acute life-threatening adrenal crisis (Bornstein 
et al., 2016). 
Considering  the  proposed  therapeutic  indication,  most  paediatric  patients  will  suffer  from  CAH  due  to 
genetic mutations, and genetic screening is an appropriate tool for early diagnosis, which greatly reduces 
the time to diagnosis, morbidity and mortality. The death rate in salt-wasting CAH without screening is 
between 4-10% (Speiser et al., 2010).  
2.1.4.  Management 
Immediate release hydrocortisone is the standard of care therapy in PAI and CAH. The goal of therapy is 
to  reduce  excessive  androgen  secretion  by  replacing  the  deficient  hormones.  Proper  treatment  with 
glucocorticoids  (GCs)  prevents  adrenal  crisis  and  virilization,  allowing  normal  growth  and  development. 
Clinical  management  of  classic  CAH  is  a  difficult  balance  between  hyperandrogenism  and 
hypercortisolism. 
Under treatment carries the risk of adrenal crisis and allows increased adrenal androgen production, with 
accelerated bone age and loss of growth potential; overtreatment may suppress growth, increase blood 
pressure, and cause iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome. 
Recent  clinical  practice  guidelines  have  been  published  by  the  endocrine  society  (Bornstein  et  al.,  2016; 
Speiser et al., 2010).  
An  unmet  need  was  identified,  by  the  PDCO,  for  an  age-appropriate  oral  formulation  for  hydrocortisone  for 
the treatment of PAI in the 0-2 years age group. 
2.1.5.  About the product 
Alkindi  formulation  is  coated  granules  containing  the  active  substance  hydrocortisone.  The  granules 
are provided with a coating for masking of the bitter taste of the active substance. Granules are provided in 
hard capsules containing 0.5, 1, 2 or 5 mg hydrocortisone coated  granules. The capsules are not 
for consumption. These presentations and novel formulation should sustain a precise dosing for use in the 
target population of patients 0-6 years of age.  
The pharmaceutical form is granules in capsules for opening.

2.1.6.  The development programme/Compliance with CHMP guidance/Scientific 
advice 
No  formal  scientific  advice  was  requested  prior  to  the  initiation  of  the  clinical  development  program.  The 
clinical  program  was  based  on  the  PIP  developed  in  collaboration  with  the  PDCO  (EMEA-001283-PIP01-12). 
The  plan  includes  a  bioequivalence  study  in  healthy  adults  to  compare  the  newly  developed  granule 
formulation  to  the  marketed  tablet  formulation  and  a  single-dose  pharmacokinetics  and  palatability 
study  in  infants  and  children  less  than  6  years  of  age.  A  PIP  waiver  was  granted  for  the  paediatric 
population from 6 years to less than 18 years. PIP compliance was confirmed in 2016 by the PDCO.  
2.2.  Quality aspects

Figure 1. Structural formula of hydrocortisone. 
The active substance is a white to almost white crystalline powder which is not hygroscopic. 
Hydrocortisone is practically insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in acetone and in ethanol (96 per cent), 
slightly soluble in methylene chloride.  
Hydrocortisone exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by specific optical rotation. 
Polymorphism has been observed for hydrocortisone. Three different polymorphic forms (Forms I, II and III) 
have been reported in the literature. Form I is the thermodynamically most stable form. It has been 
confirmed that the active substance is provided as a single polymorphic form 1, which is stable after more 
than 86 months in the stability program. 
As there is a monograph of hydrocortisone in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for this active 
substance which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
The substance is packed in a polyethylene (PE) bag or double polyethylene bags placed in a metal can or 
fibre drum as described in the CEP. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, HPLC), assay (UV), 
specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents 
(GC), chromium (ICP), particle size (electrical sensing zone method).  
This specification is in line with the CEP, which in turn is consistent with the current version of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph for hydrocortisone no. 335, and the additional tests for residual solvents (methanol), residual 
catalyst (chromium) and particle size distribution described in the CEP. 
The active substance particle size is tightly controlled by the specification. The specification limit has been 
justified based on the proposed manufacturing process for the finished product.  
The polymorphic form of hydrocortisone is controlled in the specification of the active substance 
manufacturer by infra-red (IR) spectroscopy test form and additional periodic testing using X-Ray Diffraction 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 13/59 
  
  
 
(XRD). Based on this and the stability of the polymorphic form, the absence of a test for polymorphic form by 
the finished product manufacturer is considered justified. 
The non-compendial analytical methods were assessed by EDQM during the certification procedure and are 
covered by the CEP. 
Batch analysis data for 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in a container closure 
system representative of that intended for the market for up to 60 months under long term conditions at 
25ºC / 60% RH (17 batches) or for up to 24 months under intermediate conditions 30ºC / 65% RH (2 
batches) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The active substance was packaged in two PE bags, 
twist-tied inside a fibre drum. 
The following parameters were tested: assay (Ph.Eur.), loss on drying (Ph.Eur.) and related substances. An 
additional test for total impurities was implemented after initiation of the stability study. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications at all time points and no trends were observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. No significant changes in 
appearance, colour in solution and assay were observed. Impurities were at or below 0.10%, and all results 
were within the specification. Therefore it was concluded that hydrocortisone is photostable and no additional 
light protective measures for the active substance during storage or during manufacture of the finished 
product are required. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months at controlled room temperature in 
the proposed container with the storage recommendation “do not store above 30°C”. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product

1 mg capsules: shellac, propylene glycol, concentrated ammonia solution, indigotine (E132).   
2 mg capsules: shellac, propylene glycol, concentrated ammonia solution, indigotine (E132), yellow iron 
oxide (E172), titanium dioxide (E171).

This pharmaceutical form has been specifically developed for use in children aged less than 6 years as 
replacement therapy of adrenal insufficiency. It may also be used by older children unwilling or unable to 
swallow the traditional tablet formulation. 
The  granules  are  placed  into  hard  transparent  capsules  (size  00el)  which  are  packaged  in  HDPE  bottles, 
closed with a PP child-resistant, tamper-evident closure with 2 g integrated desiccant, as described in section 
6.5 of the SmPC.  
The  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  of  the  granules  is  the  same  for  all  strengths  but  the  hard 
capsules are filled at different fill weights to achieve the required dose. The coloured imprint on the capsule, 
which is different for each strength, differentiates the strengths. The imprints are: 
“INF-0.5” (in red ink) for the 0.5 mg strength  
“INF-1.0” (in blue ink) for the 1.0 mg strength  
“INF-2.0” (in green ink) for the 2.0 mg strength  
“INF-5.0” (in grey ink) for the 5.0 mg strength  
The hard capsule itself is used as a carrier and is not intended to be consumed.   
As  indicated  previously,  the  active  substance,  hydrocortisone  micronised  is  covered  by  a  CEP.  The  active 
substance  is  provided  as  a  single  polymorphic  form  and  its  particle  size  is  tightly  controlled  by  the  active 
substance specification.  
As the proposed product is intended to be used for very young children, the initial selection of the potential 
excipients for use within the proposed finished product was based upon two key factors: the excipient should 
be “Generally Recognized As Safe” (GRAS) approved, and the excipient will have been previously used within 
a licensed paediatric medicinal product. All excipients selected are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and 
their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. The microcrystalline cellulose spheres and the hard capsules 
conform  to  the  suppliers  specifications  presented.  Microcrystalline  cellulose  used  in  the  manufacture  of  the 
microcrystalline cellulose spheres and hypromellose used to manufacture the hard capsules comply with the 
current  Ph.  Eur.  monographs.  Additional  functionality  related  tests  for  the  cellulose  spheres  (particle  size 
distribution,  loss  on  drying,  friability  and  swelling  index)  have  been  described  and  validated.  There  are  no 
novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of  excipients  is  included  in  section  6.1  of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The compatibility of hydrocortisone and the proposed excipients was confirmed in a formulation development 
study. Furthermore, the overall compatibility between the active substance and the excipients, and between 
the  finished  product  and  the  packaging  materials  has  been  demonstrated  by  the  stability  testing  program 
carried out on the finished product. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop an age-appropriate formulation of hydrocortisone 
for  the  treatment  of  children.  The  unmet  medical  need  identified  by  the  applicant  included  a  lack  of

appropriate dosage strength. The smallest current tablet strength of 10mg has to be crushed and then split 
into smaller doses, resulting in inaccurate dosing; the bitter taste of hydrocortisone in the crushed tablet; the 
absence  of  safety,  efficacy  or  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  data  in  subjects  aged  below  18  years;  and  serious 
potential consequences of under- or over-dosing children with the currently available preparations.  
As  a  result,  the  quality  target  product  profile  (QTPP)  was  to  develop  an  oral  immediate  release  formulation 
which  would  provide  taste  masking,  is  suitable  for  paediatric  patients,  provides  an  accurate  dosing  at  low 
paediatric  dose  strengths  and  can  be  mixed  and  administered  with  suitable  fluids  and  foods.  In  order  to 
achieve the desired product characteristics, a multiparticulate granule was selected. The selected formulation 
and  pharmaceutical  form  has  been  adequately  justified  by  the  applicant  providing  reference  to  relevant 
regulatory  guidance,  scientific  literature,  other  marketed  products  and  previous  consultation  as  part  of  the 
Paediatric  Investigation  Plan.  The  swallowability  of  the  granules,  the  potential  risk  of  choking,  and  the 
possibility that some of the granules are retained in the mouth and will be absorbed buccally has also been 
discussed.  No  difference  in  bioavailability  is  claimed  being  expected  since  hydrocortisone  has  a  mean 
bioavailability of 96% by the oral route.  
The  choice  of  the  core  microspheres,  drug  layering,  seal  coat  and  taste  masking  coat  were  investigated  as 
part of the formulation development. 
Different spheres were evaluated for their suitability as the carrier for the Alkindi formulation. The selection 
of  the  microcrystalline  spheres  was  justified  For  drug  layering,  different  binders  were  discussed.  The 
hypromellose  binder  was  shown  to  provide  greater  efficiency  for  drug  layering.  Relevant  information  was 
provided  to  justify  the  proposed  seal  coat.  Different  taste  masking  systems  were  evaluated.  the  final 
composition of the system was selected.  
In  order  to  deliver  the  granules  to  the  patient  a  carrier  capable  of  containing  an  accurate  dose  for  all  dose 
strengths and easy to be handled by the patient caregiver was pursued. A hypromellose (vegetable-derived) 
size “00el” hard capsule carrier was preferred. The hard capsule size of ‘00el’ was chosen for ease of handling 
and  opening.  A  transparent  shell  was  chosen,  to  visually  certify  the  capsule  is  empty.    There  are  no  toxic 
components in the capsules and they comply with EP, USP and JP standards. 
The Alkindi granules in capsules for opening are packaged in HDPE bottles sealed with a PP lid with integrated 
desiccant. The primary packaging protects the granules in capsules from moisture. 
The  composition  of  the  product  used  in  the  clinical  trials  is  identical  to  the  one  proposed  for 
commercialisation.  
Bioequivalence of the Alkindi granules to the reference hydrocortisone tablet product (hydrocortisone 10 mg 
tablets Auden Mckenzie)has been demonstrated in clinical studies Comparative in vitro dissolution profiles for 
the  reference  product  from  the  European  market  and  the  biobatch  (Alkindi  5  mg),  at  pH  1.2,  4.5  and  6.8, 
using  the  QC  method  have  been  presented.  The  results  indicate  that  both  products  meet  the  dissolution 
criteria  as  defined  for  an  immediate  release  product  (Q=75%  at  45  minutes). Bioequivalence between  both 
products  has  been  demonstratedData  has  been  provided  to    demonstrate  that  even  though  biobatch  and 
industrial  batch  are  vastly  different  in  size,  their  dissolution  profiles  and  manufacturing  process  can  be 
considered as comparable. In fact, in order to demonstrate that the Alkindi investigational medicinal product 
used  in  the  clinical  study,,  is  representative  of  the  product  to  be  marketed,a  larger  scale,  a  comparative  in 
vitro  dissolution  profile  testing  study  was  undertaken.  The  dissolution  profiles  produced  in  each  media 
demonstrate  that the  batches  of  Alkindi  granules  produced  at  the  different  scales  have  a  similar  dissolution 
performance (f2>50) in all three media tested, namely pH 1.2 ),4.5 and 6.8. It was also confirmed that the 
composition and manufacturing process parameters are comparable.

Clinical study Infacort 003 was performed with industrial batches of the four strengths. 
The  active  substance,  hydrocortisone,  is  a  BCS  (Biopharmaceutics  Classification  System)  class  1  molecule, 
being  highly  soluble  and  highly  permeable.  Its  bioavailability  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract  has  been 
determined to be 96% for an oral 20 mg dose (Derendorf, 1991) and its solubility is not significantly affected 
by pH.  Hydrocortisone has been shown to be soluble across the physiological pH range (pH 1 to 7). There is 
no  significant  difference  in  solubility  across  this  pH  which  would  present  a  risk  to  the  physicochemical 
performance of the finished product.  
The  influence  of  the  particle  size  distribution  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  granules  on 
dissolution performance was considered when developing Alkindi granules. As mentioned above, particle size 
distribution is controlled in the active substance specification. The method of manufacture of the granules is a 
standard fluidised bed spray-layering technique. The particle size of the granule is adequately controlled.  
Dissolution development studies were conducted to ensure that the dissolution conditions were optimised to 
be discriminatory to detect changes in the product and could, therefore, control batch to batch consistency. 
The  method  was  developed  to  detect  changes  in  the  granule  formulation  which  may  impact  hydrocortisone 
release in vivo. To verify the discriminatory nature of the QC dissolution test, batches of the finished product 
manufactured at different were evaluated during the development programme.  
The  granule  taste  mask  coating  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  effective  in  the  oral  cavity;  following 
administration  in  clinical  studies  Infacort  001  and  Infacort  002  the  majority  of  subjects  confirmed  Alkindi 
granules were acceptable and palatable, and in clinical study Infacort 003 the majority of paediatric patients 
also confirmed the palatability of Alkindi granules. To verify the in situ integrity and correct application of the 
taste-masking  layer,  for  the  purposes  of  supporting  the  dosing  posology  for  the  product  to  paediatric 
patients,  and  batch  to  batch  consistency,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  add  an  early  time  point  to  the 
proposed  dissolution  test  or  to  develop  an  alternative  test  to  control  the  functionality  of  the  taste  masking 
layer.  The  applicant  conducted  dissolution  studies  in  a  separate  biorelevant  model.  Based  on  this 
investigation an alternative in vitro dissolution method to control the functionality of the taste masking layer 
was introduced as an in-process control (IPC) with the results being part of the release specification. This test 
was demonstrated to be discriminatory against the amount of taste mask coating. This test is used to support 
the  applicant’s  claim  that  Alkindi  granules  maintain  their  taste  masking  integrity.  The  proposed  limit  is 
clinically acceptable since the method of administration described in the SmPC indicates that that dosing with 
dry granules should be followed immediately by a drink to wash the product down; or, where sprinkled onto a 
spoonful of soft food, this should be given within 5 minutes and not stored for future use, as explained above. 
In order to manufacture the multiparticulate granules, a fluidised bed bottom spray coating (Wurster coating) 
process was chosen for each of the layering steps. The rationale for developing this process was justified. The 
manufacturing  process  development  data  presented  demonstrate  the  consistent  quality  of  the  granules 
following scaling-up from the development batch size to the industrial batch size. 
The proposed granules have low bioburden potential due to the use of the organic solvent in the final taste 
mask coating step of the multiparticulate granules manufacturing process. Microbial limit acceptance 
according to the Ph Eur/USP harmonised method for the microbiological examination of non-sterile products 
has been established. 
As  indicated  above,  Alkindi  granules  are  designed  for  oral  administration  into  the  mouth  and  washed  down 
immediately  with  fluids,  or  mixed  with  a  spoonful  of  soft-food  and  washed  down  with  fluids  immediately 
following  administration.  Compatibility  of  the  Alkindi  granules  with  administration  fluids  (including  breast 
milk,  whole  milk,  formula  (artificial)  milk  and  water)  and  soft-food  matrices  commonly  used  for  co-

administration  of  medicines  (yoghurt  and  apple  sauce)  was  demonstrated  through  in  vitro  dissolution  and 
compatibility  studies.  The  results  obtained  confirm  the  compatibility  of  Alkindi  with  commonly  used 
administration  fluids  like  water,  breast  milk,  formula  milk  and  whole  milk  and  support  the  proposed 
administration  instructions  for  use  included  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC.  In  most  of  the  simulated  dosing 
scenarios in vitro dissolution was rapid and complete with no drug precipitation observed over the experiment 
duration.  These  results  indicate  that  it  is  likely  that  in  vivo  dissolution  and  bioavailability  of  hydrocortisone 
from Alkindi granules will not be adversely affected by the composition of the co-administered dosing fluids or 
co-administered soft-foods studied, particularly when the method of administration instructions in the SmPC 
are  followed  and  the  granules  mixed  in  soft-food  are  washed  down  immediately  with  fluid  after  oral 
administration.  
The potential administration of the granules through nasogastric tubes was also investigated. The results 
obtained indicate that the granules stick to the tubes (6 Fr and 8 Fr) and are not expelled following flushing. 
Therefore, it was concluded that the smaller tubes do not allow proper administration of Alkindi. This is 
reflected in the SmPC section 4.3 and leaflet section 2. 
The  containers  used  for  bulk  hydrocortisone  immediate  release  granules  and  bulk  capsules  have  been 
described They comply with the relevant Ph. Eur. Monograph.  
The  primary  packaging  of  the  finished  product  consists  of  an  opaque  HDPE  bottle  containing  50  capsules. 
Bottles  are  closed  with  a  child-resistant,  tamper-evident  PP  screw  cap  with  2  g  integrated  desiccant.  The 
sealed bottles are placed into a secondary cardboard carton. All packaging materials are commonly used for 
packaging  of  solid  oral  dosage  forms  and  conform  to  EU  Directives  for  pharmaceutical  packaging  materials. 
The  resins  in  the  bottles  meet  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  3.1.3  (Polyolefines).  The  HDPE  in  the  bottles  are  in 
compliance  with  EU  regulation  10/2011  on  plastic materials  and  articles  intended  to  come  into  contact with 
food.  The  closure  is  a  round,  polypropylene,  child-resistant,  tamper-evident  screw  cap  with  integrated 
desiccant.  The  resins  in  the  closures  meet  the  EP  Monographs  3.1.6  (Polypropylene  for  containers  and 
closures for parenteral preparations and ophthalmic preparations) and 3.1.3 (Polyolefines). The closure is in 
compliance  with  EU  regulation  10/2011  and  is  certified  child  resistant  according  to  ISO8317  (2003).  The 
desiccant complies with Regulation (EC) 1935/2004 and EU regulation 10/2011. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three coating steps: preparation of hydrocortisone coated granules, 
seal coating and taste mask coating of the granules by fluid bed spray-layering, followed by capsule filling at 
different fill weights to produce the different dose strengths and packaging. The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process. The hold time for the granules has been validated during process validation. 
The IPCs are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  through  the  manufacture  of  one  process 
validation  campaign  consisting  of  three  consecutive  commercial  scale  finished  product  batches,  including  all 
capsule  strengths,  in  accordance  to  a  pre-approved  protocol.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible 
manner.

Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
identification  (UV,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  by  content  uniformity  (Ph.  Eur.), 
dissolution  (both  release  characteristics  and  taste  mask  functionality),  residual  solvents  (GC),  impurities 
(HPLC), microbiology (TAMC, TYMC, E.coli- Ph. Eur.).  
During the review, there was a major objection by the CHMP and the applicant was requested  to revise the 
dissolution  specification.  This  resulted  in  the  development  of  an  alternative  in  vitro  dissolution  method  to 
verify the in situ integrity and correct application of the taste-masking layer to support the dosing posology 
to paediatric patients and batch to batch consistency. The applicant was also requested to demonstrate that 
the  proposed  dissolution  limit  and  acceptance  criteria  had  been  set  with  reference  to the  dissolution  results 
obtained with the batches used in the bioequivalence studies.  
The absence for a limit for water content/loss on drying in the finished product specification has been justified 
by the applicant.  
The  specifications  for  Alkindi  have  been  chosen  in  line  with  the  requirements  of  ICH  Q6A.  Due  to  the 
concentration  of  the  active  within  the  dosage  form,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  is  confirmed  by  content 
uniformity testing. The limit has been set in line with the Ph. Eur. test. The related substance specification is 
based  on  the  hydrocortisone  Ph.  Eur.  monograph  and  is  set  in  accordance  with  ICH  Impurities  Guideline 
Q3B(R2). The residual solvent specification has been set against ICH Q3C (R4). 
In  line  with  ICHQ3D  an  assessment  of  the  potential  for  the  presence  of  elemental  impurities  within  the 
finished product has been undertaken. Based on the findings of the risk assessment, the applicant concluded 
that the controls in place for the active substance and excipients are appropriate and justified to control the 
potential elemental impurity content in the finished product.  
The impurity profile for hydrocortisone complies with the Ph. Eur. monograph for hydrocortisone.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. The stability indicating nature of the HPLC method for related substances has been 
demonstrated through stress studies. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for 
assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  on  hydrocortisone  immediate  release  granules  filled  in  capsules  have  been  conducted  in 
accordance with ICH Q1A and Q1B.  
Stability  data  of  three  registration  batches  of  Alkindi  0.5  mg  and  5.0  mg  batches  stored  under  long  term 
conditions for up to 24 months at 30 ºC/75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 
ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  The use of the 30°C/75% RH long term storage 
condition,  instead  of  30°C/65%  RH,  has  been  justified  support  registration  of  the  product  in  other  global 
territories, including those defined as Climatic Zone IVb.

A  bracketing  approach  using  the  highest  and  lowest  available  dose  strengths  for  the  long  term  stability 
studies has been followed and is considered acceptable  
The  batches  of  Alkindi  were  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  100  ml  HDPE 
bottles sealed with PP screw cap with desiccant containing 25 or 40 capsule fill count. The stability data for 
the 40-count in 100 ml HDPE bottles is claimed to be fully representative of the stability of capsules packed 
as  proposed  for  marketing  since  the  material  composition  is  the  same  and  the  ratio  of  fill  count  to  bottle 
volume and headspace is maintained constant.  
Supportive  stability  studies  on  two  development  batches  of  Alkindi  0.5  mg  and  5.0  mg  stored  at 
25ºC/60%RH for up to 24 months and 40ºC/75%RH for up to 6 months have also been presented.  
Stability  batches  were  tested  for  appearance,  assay,  purity,  dissolution  and  microbiology  (annually), 
according to the limits and methods described above.  
Results of all the stability studies conducted showed good stability of the proposed product over time under 
the conditions studied. Under long term study conditions no significant changes and no trend were observed 
in most of the parameters controlled over the tested period of 24 months. Under accelerated test conditions, 
a slight increase of some impurities was observed but all results remained within the proposed specification 
On the basis of the note for guidance on evaluation of stability data the applicant proposed a shelf-life of 30 
month.  In  line  with  the  requirements  of  the  Ph.Eur.  general  monograph  for  Capsules,  the  special  storage 
condition “Do not store above 30°C” is applied.  
A  photostability  study  has  also  been  conducted  on  one  commercial  scale  batch  of  Alkindi  5.0  mg.  Samples 
were  exposed  to  light  without  the  primary  packaging  or  packaged  in  HDPE  bottles.  Photostability  batches 
were  tested  for  appearance,  assay  and  purity.  The  product  showed  signs  of  degradation  after  exposure  to 
light  without  the  protection  of  the  HDPE  container,  and  some  impurity  levels  were  out  of  specification. 
Therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  the  finished  product  is  photosensitive  and  should  be  stored  in  the  original 
bottle in order to protect from light. 
Stability  studies to  support  bulk  granule  storage  prior  to  encapsulation  were also  conducted.  The  data after 
storage for the proposed holding period at the warehouse storage conditions were all within the specification 
and no trends were observed. The stability results from this bulk hold study support the proposed storage of 
the granules in bulk prior to encapsulation. In addition, stability studies were conducted on one commercial 
scale  batch  of  Alkindi  0.5  mg  and  5.0  mg  to  support  bulk  capsule  storage  and  transport  prior  to  primary 
bottle  packaging.  The  data  after  storage  for  the  proposed  holding  period  showed  that  all  results  are  within 
specification and no trends in data were observed. The stability results from each study support the proposed 
storage holding period and storage conditions for the bulk capsules prior to primary packaging. 
In-use shelf life stability testing of hydrocortisone immediate release granules filled in capsules packaged in 
the packaging material proposed for marketing and stored at 25ºC/60%RH was also studied. The study was 
conducted in accordance with EMA Guidance on in-use stability testing of human medicinal products stored in 
multidose  containers  (CPMP/QWP/2934/99).  Two  batches  of  0.5  mg  dose  strength  capsules  stored  in  50-
count  HDPE  bottles/PP  screw  cap  with  desiccant  were  tested.  Samples  were  stored  at  25°C/60%RH,  the 
bottles were opened daily and capsules removed at defined intervals to simulate routine use. Capsules were 
tested after 0, 7, 14, 28, 42 and 60 days for appearance and after 0, 28 and 60 days for appearance, assay, 
purity,  dissolution  and  microbiology.  The  data  after  storage  for  28  and  60  days  showed  that  all  results  are 
within specification and no trends in data were observed. The in-use stability data demonstrates the quality 
of the product remains constant over the proposed in-use shelf-life of 60 days once the HDPE bottle has been 
opened.

Satisfactory data has been generated to support in-use stability, photostability and bulk storage of granules 
and capsules. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the proposed  shelf-life of  30 months  and  storage  conditions  “do  not  store 
above 30°C” and “store in the original bottle in order to protect from light”, as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The information on the active substance micronized hydrocortisone refers to the valid CEP and therefore 
raised no comment. The stability data presented by the applicant supports the 24 month retest period in the 
proposed container with the storage recommendation “do not store above 30°C”. 
Alkindi  granules  in  capsules  for  opening  constitutes  new  paediatric-specific  presentation  of  the  established 
active  pharmaceutical ingredient,  hydrocortisone to  improve its dosing  and overcome  the bitter  taste of  the 
crushed tablets. Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  Bioequivalence  with  the  reference  product  has  been 
demonstrated.  Although  the  bioequivalence  studies  were  performed  with  a  development  batch  of  2  kg  an 
appropriate justification to demonstrate that this batch is representative for the industrial batch size has been 
presented.  Two dissolution  methods  were developed,  one  to  control the  taste  mask  coating  and the  second 
one to control hydrocortisone release. The dissolution method for hydrocortisone release is discriminant and 
the  limits  were  set  with  reference  to  the  dissolution  results  obtained  with  the  batches  used  in  the 
bioequivalence studies.   
The  manufacturing  process  description  is  provided  with  sufficient  details,  including  in-process  controls  and 
possible  holding  steps.  The  process  was  suitably  validated.  The  tests  proposed  in  the  specifications  are 
appropriate  and a  summary  of  the  risk  assessment  of  the  elemental  impurities  is  included,  in  line  with  ICH 
Q3D.   
Stability studies were conducted in accordance with the ICH recommendations, including long term (up to 24 
months) and accelerated conditions, in-use study, photostability and bulk stability. These justify the proposed 
shelf life and storage recommendations.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Alkindi  consists  of  uniform  multiparticulates,  which  have  an  inert  core,  a  hydrocortisone  drug  layer,  a 
hydroxypropylmethyl  cellulose  seal  coating  layer  and  an  outer ethyl  cellulose/hydroxypropylmethyl  cellulose 
taste  masking  layer  All  of  the  pharmaceutical  excipients  are  well  known  and  commonly  used  in  the 
pharmaceutical industry and fulfil the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.).  
Dosage must be individualised according to the response of the individual patient. 
Evaluation of the PK, PD and safety of Alkindi has been conducted through clinical studies. 
A  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  has  been  provided. 
Pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  properties  of  hydrocortisone  are  well  known.  As 
hydrocortisone  is  a  widely  used,  well-known  active  substance,  the  applicant  has  not  provided  additional 
studies and further studies were not required. Overview based on literature review was, thus, appropriate.  
The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC were in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies were required.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No  non-clinical  pharmacology  studies  have  been  performed  with  Alkindi  granules,  which  is  acceptable. 
Hydrocortisone  is  a  synthetic  glucocorticoid  and  the  pharmaceutical  form  of  the  major  endogenous 
glucocorticoid  in  man,  cortisol.  Thus,  the  pharmacological  effects  of  hydrocortisone  in  man  are  identical  to 
cortisol  e.g.  metabolic  actions  on  carbohydrates,  proteins  and  fat  as  well  as  anti-inflammatory  and 
immunosuppressive  actions.  Moreover,  the  pharmacological  properties  of  hydrocortisone,  both  primary  and 
secondary  are  well-known  given  the  extensive  clinical  experience  with  hydrocortisone  in  the  proposed 
indication.  
No  drug interaction  studies  or  GLP  safety  pharmacology  studies  have  been  performed  with  Alkindi,  which  is 
acceptable given the long experience of use of hydrocortisone in man, including at immunosuppressant and 
anti-inflammatory  doses  many  times  higher  than  those  which  will  be  needed  for  replacement  therapy  in 
adrenal  insufficiency  where  the  peak  systemic  levels  obtained  with  the  treatment  will  be  within  the  normal 
levels of cortisol in healthy humans. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No  non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed  using  Hydrocortisone  granules  and  there  is  only 
limited  information  available  on  the  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  (ADME)  of 
hydrocortisone in animals in the published literature. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 22/59 
  
  
Hydrocortisone  presents  low  solubility  but  high  permeability  through  the  intestinal  membrane  with  inter-
individual  variability.  The  distribution  phase  is  very  rapid,  with  a  terminal  half-life  of  1.28±1.6  hours.  In 
pregnant  mice  transfer  to  the  embryos  has  been  described.  Hydrocortisone  undergoes  hepatic  metabolic 
clearance in rats and dogs. In rats, it is excreted mainly via the faeces and also in the urine. Other drugs may 
affect cortisol clearance by inducing or inhibiting the various enzymes involved in the metabolism of cortisol. 
No study assessing the excretion of hydrocortisone in human milk has been identified. Endogenous cortisol is, 
however,  excreted  in  breast  milk  at  a  stable  rate  throughout  the  lactation  period,  so  it  is  reasonable  to 
assume that hydrocortisone can also be present in breast milk. 
For the purpose of this marketing authorisation application and in line with the agreed paediatric investigation 
plan, the pharmacokinetics of Alkindi have been investigated in clinical studies. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No standard repeat-dose toxicity studies or information regarding toxicokinetics or interspecies comparisons 
has been identified in the literature. In single dose toxicity studies in rats, adverse effects included infections 
possibly  related  to  the  immunosuppressive  properties  of  hydrocortisone,  reduced  adrenal  weights,  liver 
damage,  lung  consolidation  and  gastrointestinal  changes.  Repeated-dose  toxicity  studies in  rats  and  rabbits 
reported the liver as target organ. Hepatotoxicity is a known effect of high dose glucocorticosteroids. 
With  respect  to  genotoxicity,  older  studies  in  mice  indicate  a  clastogenic  potential  of  hydrocortisone. 
However,  a  more  recent  standard  battery  of  GLP  compliant  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  genotoxicity  studies  do  not 
indicate a genotoxic potential of hydrocortisone.  
Carcinogenicity studies have not been identified. However, an abstract of a life span study in rats reports that 
no evidence of a carcinogenic potential was found for hydrocortisone. 
The  available  reproductive  toxicity  data  demonstrate  that  hydrocortisone  and  other  glucocorticoids  in  high 
doses  have  teratogenic  and  embryotoxic  potential  in  various  animal  species.  Adverse  effects  on  offspring 
include  cleft  palate,  sex  organ  anomalies,  polycystic  kidney  disease,  reduced  lung  and  body  weight.  In  a 
prenatal study in pregnant rats, indications of hormonal disturbances in the adult offspring were seen. 
Juvenile  animals  studies  have  not  been  conducted  to  support  this  paediatric  use  marketing  authorisation, 
which is considered acceptable in view of the clinical experience in children and which is also in line with the 
agreed  PIP  where  no  further  non-clinical  studies  were  requested  to  support  the  paediatric  development  of 
hydrocortisone. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Alkindi manufactured by DIURNAL LTD is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the 
combined sales volumes for all hydrocortisone containing products and the exposure of the environment to 
the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
As  the  current  product  is  an  alternative  formulation  for  hydrocortisone  preparations  that  are  currently 
authorised, a shift towards this formulation is anticipated, without impacting overall environmental exposure. 
Furthermore, the use of precise dose units as offered by Alkindi may reduce environmental exposure 
compared to existing hydrocortisone products used in this formulation, as there is the potential to prevent 
Assessment report

wastage from leftover portions after currently available tablets are cut up. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
There  is  limited information  in  the  published  literature  on  the  (safety)  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics and 
toxicological properties of hydrocortisone in animal studies. Hydrocortisone is the pharmaceutical form of the 
endogenous  glucocorticoid,  cortisol.  It  has  been  used  in  clinical  settings  for  decades  and  the  overall 
knowledge of its pharmaco-toxicological properties in humans is extensive. In addition, Alkindi is indicated for 
treatment  of  adrenal  insufficiency  and  the  peak  systemic  levels  obtained  are  within  the  normal  levels  of 
cortisol in healthy humans.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Alkindi granules in capsules for opening and 
justifications that the different formulation of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties 
with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. 
This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non-clinical studies were not considered 
necessary. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for Alkindi granules in capsules for opening containing hydrocortisone. To support the 
marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted two bioequivalence studies Infacort 001 and 
Infacort 002: both single centre, single dose, open-label, randomised with cross-over studies design under 
fasting conditions.  
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment 
EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/ Corr **  is of 
particular relevance. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
Two  bioequivalence  studies  Infacort  001  and  Infacort  002  using  10  and  20  mg  dose  levels  administered  as 
2x5 mg and 4x5 mg granules have been conducted while the procedure concerns the strengths 0.5 mg, 1.0 
mg,  2.0  mg  and  5  mg.  The  following  general  biowaiver  criteria  described  in  the  EMA  Guideline  on  the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/ Corr ** were considered fulfilled:

c) 
the pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process.  
the qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same; 
the composition of the strengths are quantitatively proportional because the same immediate release 
granules are filled at different fill weights in the hard capsule to achieve the required dose; 
d)  
the  dissolution  profiles  of  the  0.5  mg,  1  mg  and  2  mg  appears  to  be  visually  rather  similar  to  the 
biobatch 5 mg used in the bioequivalence studies. 
Regarding  the  linearity  of  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  active  substance,  a  less  than  proportional  to  dose-
exposure  relationship  with  increasing  doses  of  Alkindi  over  the  dose  range  from  0.5mg  to  10mg  has  been 
shown, with a difference in dose-adjusted mean AUCs of more than 25% (study Infacort 001 – see the table 
below).  The  mechanism  behind  the  non-linearity  has  been  attributed  by  the  Applicant  to  saturation  of  the 
protein-binding  at  higher  doses.  The  absorption  that  was  almost  complete  at  the  high  dose  of  20  mg 
(absolute  bioavailability  of  87%  -  study  Infacort  002)  supports  that  saturation  of  the  absorption  cannot  be 
the main reason for the non-linearity.  
In  case  of  a  less  than  proportional  increase  in  AUC  with  increasing  dose  over  the  therapeutic  dose  range, 
bioequivalence should in most cases be established at the highest and at the lowest strength (or a strength in 
the  linear  range)  (EMA  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1/ 
Corr **). However, the lowest available strength of an immediate release hydrocortisone product for which a 
marketing  authorisation  has  been  granted  in  the  Union  is  the  10  mg  strength  used  in  the  bioequivalence 
study Infacort 001 in healthy adult volunteers. A bioequivalence study at the lowest strength of Alkindi®, 0.5 
mg,  is  thus  not  feasible.  The  applied  product  is  appropriate  for  paediatric  dosing  and  the  granules  are  the 
same  in  all  strengths  of  the  product.  Also,  the  theoretical  uncertainty  of  bioequivalence  between  the  lower 
strengths  of  Alkindi  and  the  corresponding  dose  of  the  reference  product  is  likely  minor  in  relation  to  the 
overall  uncertainty  in  the  off-label  crushing  and  dividing  of  the  reference  product,  which  is  the  common 
practice used in the clinical settings today. Even if some uncertainties remained on the determination of the 
Cmax  in  the  study  Infacort  001  (see  below),  taking  into  account  the  results  from  the  bioequivalence  study 
Infacort 002 conducted with the 20 mg strength and from the clinical studies Infacort 003 and 004, because 
the  development  of  this  new  formulation  with  the  same  granules  for  all  capsule  strengths  respond  to  an 
unmet  medical  need  in  paediatric  patients  and  since  the  dose  is  individually  titrated  based  on  the  clinical 
response, this issue was not further pursued.

first quarter of 2018. As a prerequisite, the data analysis plan should be submitted as soon as possible.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Two  bioequivalence  studies  Infacort  001  and  Infacort  002  have  been  conducted  to  compare  the 
pharmacokinetics  of  the  new  formulation  Alkindi  2X5mg  and  4X5mg  with  Hydrocortisone 
immediate  release  tablets  10  mg  and  20  mg,  respectively  (see  the  tables  below).  The  dose 
proportionality  of  Alkindi  at  doses  of  0.5  mg,  2  mg,  5  mg  and  10  mg  was  also  investigated  in  the  study 
Infacort  001  (see  before).  Another  primary  aim  of  the  study  Infacort  002  was  to  determine  the  absolute 
bioavailability of cortisol from Alkindi® granules and hydrocortisone tablets using intravenous hydrocortisone 
as  the  reference  injection.  Secondary  objectives  of  the  study  Infacort  002  included  building  a  model  of 
hydrocortisone  metabolism  and  evaluating  relationship  to  metabolic  parameters  of  hydrocortisone  and 
Alkindi.

Table 5: Summary of study design (Infacort 002) 
The two bioequivalence studies were single centre, single dose, open-label, randomised, cross-over studies. 
The sample size was appropriate. However, for the study Infacort 001, the infrequent sampling around 
tmax  casted  doubts  on  the  measurement  of  true  Cmax  since  about  half  of  the  volunteers  in  each 
treatment  group presented the Cmax  being the first point of the concentration time curve (0.5 h) 
for  the  10  mg  Alkindi  and  10  mg test  reference tablet  and even  more  subjects  for  Alkindi  0.5  mg,  2  mg,  5 
mg.  The  reasons  for  this  “shift”  in  t max  couldn’t  be  identified.  The  reassessment  of  the  bioequivalence  after 
the  exclusion  of  these  subjects  was  not  possible  as  it  would  lead  to  a  number  of  evaluable  subjects  of  less 
than  12,  the  minimum  number  of  subjects  requested  in  the  EMA  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of 
Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1/  Corr  **).  The  Cmax  could  therefore  not  be  reliably 
estimated in the study Infacort 001 and conclusions done for the bioequivalence between 2x5 mg Alkindi 
and Hydrocortisone 10 mg as well as the dose proportionality of the different strengths of Alkindi for this PK 
parameter could not be relied upon. However, even if some uncertainties remained on the determination 
of  the  Cmax  in  the  study  Infacort  001,  taking  into  account  (1)  the  results  from  the  bioequivalence  study 
Infacort  002  with  tmax  not  being  the  first  sampling  point  for  any  subjects  (see  also  comment  on  statistical 
analysis below) and (2) the results from the clinical phase III studies Infacort 003 and 004, (3) because the 
development  of  this  new  formulation  respond  to  an  unmet  medical  need  in  paediatric  patients  and  (4)  a 
monitoring of the clinical response is recommended in the section 4.2 of the SPC, this issue was not further 
pursued.  
Auden  Mckenzie  (Pharma  Division)  Limited  10  mg  Hydrocortisone  tablets  PL  17507/0246  and  20  mg 
Hydrocortisone tablets PL 1707/00098 are the reference products used in the study Infacort 001 and Infacort 
002,  respectively.  They  have  been  granted  market  authorisation  in  the  European  Union  on  the  basis  of  a 
complete  dossier  in  accordance  with  Articles  8(3),  of  Directive  2001/83/EC.  Both  reference  products 
(Hydrocortisone  Auden  Mckenzie  10  mg  and  20  mg  tablets)  have  the  same  indications  and  the  same 
posology and method of administration in adults and children.

**  further  stability  results  covered  the  period  of  the  study  Infacort  002  conducted  after  the  study  Infacort 
001 
The comparative dissolution profiles with the biobatches of the test product Alkindi 20 mg and the reference 
product  hydrocortisone  20  mg  tablet  used  in  the  study  Infacort  002  were  lacking  and  a  number  of  issues 
have been identified regarding the comparative dissolution profiles provided for the comparison between the 
10  mg  strength  of  the  test  and  reference  products  used  in  the  study  Infacort  001.  Because  in  vivo 
bioequivalence conclusions prevail, these issues raised were not pursued.  
Alkindi  used  in  the  clinical  study  was  manufactured  at  pilot  scale  while  the  product  to  be  marketed  is 
manufactured  at  a  larger  scale.  However,  appropriate  justification  has  been  presented  to  demonstrate  that 
this batch is representative for the industrial batch size (see quality aspects before).  
The CRO used in the bioequivalence studies, has been routinely inspected by the MHRA.  
The studies Infacort 001 and Infacort 002 were conducted under close to fasting conditions (a meal has 
been  given  one  hour  after  drug  administration,  while  the  EMA  guideline  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev. 
1/Corr**  required  that  no  food  allowed  at  least  4  hours  post-dose).  Because  no  food  effect  related 
recommendation  is  available  in  the  SmPC  of  the  reference  product  Hydrocortisone  10  mg  Auden 
MacKenzie  (PL  17507/0246  -  study  Infacort  001),  the  bioequivalence  should  preferably  be  tested  under 
fasting conditions as this situation will be more sensitive to difference in pharmacokinetics. In the literature 
(Barbhaiya  R.H.  et  al,  Drug-Nutrient  Interactions,  1982;  vol.1,  p.103-112),  a  food  effect  have  been 
reported with a reduction in the peak plasma concentrations and an increase in the time required to attain 
peak plasma concentrations for the administration of 3 x 20 mg hydrocortisone tablets after an overnight fast 
and  following  a  standard  breakfast  in  10  healthy  adult  volunteers.  However,  the  impact  on  the  peak  drug 
level  appears  to  be  rather  limited  with  the  peak  drug  level  under  fed  conditions  representing  about 
85% of the peak drug level observed under fasting conditions and after administration with 250 ml of 
water  (Cmax  =  0.57  µg/ml  and  0.48  µg/ml  under  fasting  and  fed  conditions  respectively).  The  data

gathered up to now on efficacy and safety in the phase III clinical studies Infacort 004 conducted 
under real life conditions are reassuring. The Applicant has reported that the interim data from the long-
term follow-up study do not suggest any gastrointestinal concerns in practice with this replacement dosage. 
Finally, a monitoring of the clinical response is recommended in the section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Different  methods  are  proposed  in  the  SmPC  by  the  Applicant  for  the  administration  of  Alkindi®: 
administration  of  dry  granules  with  a  drink  (water,  milk,  breast-milk,  or  formula  milk)  or 
sprinkled into soft foods, recommendation to dose promptly and then to give a drink (water, milk, 
breast-milk, or formula milk). The volunteers and the majority of the patients included in phase I and III 
studies  were  administered  Alkindi  followed  by  water.  Only  two  patients  were  described  to  receive  Alkindi 
sprinkled into fruit mousse and 1 patient with (breast) milk. In vivo data available for these two last methods 
of  administration  are  therefore  limited.  The  different  methods  proposed  are  however  adapted  to 
paediatric patients and can help to promote the medication compliance. Regarding co-administration 
with meals, the impact of food will be probably rather limited. Efficacy/safety data from study Infacort 
004  collected  in  patients  under  real-life  conditions  are  reassuring.  In  addition,  in  vitro  dissolution 
results in the presence of milk or soft food indicate that the presence of milk or soft food has no significant 
impact on  the  dissolution profiles:  they  are  very  similar to  the profiles obtained  in  the  absence of  food,  i.e. 
release  is  complete  and  rapid.  In  a  context  of  close  clinical  monitoring  allowing  the  adaptation  of  the 
dose  administered  according  to  the  response  of  the  individual  patient,  the  methods  of  administration 
described  in  the  SmPC  were  endorsed.  Regarding  the  administration  with  soft  food,  the  Applicant  has 
reflected the results of the in vitro dissolution study in Section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
The  use  of  healthy  adult  male  volunteers  was  considered  appropriate  for  initial  investigation  of  PK.  This 
population was endorsed in the PIP. Another clinical study Infacort 003 (efficacy study) has been conducted 
to  evaluate  whether  Alkindi®  provide  adequate  serum  cortisol  levels  in  paediatric  patients  (see  below). 
Endogenous  secretion  of  the  hormone  in  healthy  adult  volunteers  has  been  suppressed  by  dexamethasone 
pre-treatment. 
The calculation of the PK parameters was performed using a baseline correction. In the study Infacort 002, a 
range  of  total  serum  cortisol  concentrations  from  7.67  to  40.94  nmol/L  was  found  when  the  volunteers 
received only dexamethasone to suppress endogenous cortisol production and supports the use of a baseline 
correction. Two different pre-specified methods have been used for baseline correction for the calculation of 
the pharmacokinetic  parameters for the clinical studies Infacort 001 and Infacort 002. For the study Infacort 
001,  the  mean  of  the  three  pre-dose  concentrations  was  subtracted  from  all  post-dose  concentrations  for 
each period for each subject. It is one of the two methods for baseline correction proposed in the Guideline 
on  the  investigation  of  bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1/Corr**)  when  the  substance  being 
studied  is  endogenous:  subtraction  of  the  mean  of  individual  endogenous  pre-dose  concentrations.  The 
literature describes that in this case, the baseline level is usually taken as the mean of three or so levels in 
the  24  h  prior to  dosing  (Dissanayake  S.  et  al,  BJCP,  2010,  vol.69,  p.238-244).  The  study  Infacort  002  did 
not  apply  these  recommendations.  Indeed,  all  total  serum  cortisol  concentrations  were  adjusted  by 
subtracting only one pre-dose time point (the - 10 min sample) for each study period. Because the objectives 
of the study Infacort 002 were wider than the assessment of the bioavailability, the Applicant has chosen to 
reduce the number time points in order to keep the amount of blood taken for each period to a reasonable 
amount,  including  the  number  of  pre-dose  time  points.  The  Applicant  has  however  shown  that  the 
suppressed  cortisol  values  in  subjects  were  very  stable  when  cortisol  was  suppressed  with  dexamethasone 
and  can  be  considered  as  successfully  suppressed  as  they  were  less  than  50  nmol/l  cortisol  over  the  same 
period of 12 hours (study period 2 of the study Infacort 002) than the Alkindi® and hydrocortisone reference

tablet periods (study periods 3 and 4). Therefore it was concluded that no real difference can be expected 
between the mean cortisol of three pre-dose values and the single cortisol value at pre-dose (-10 
minutes). It is considered acceptable taking into account that the Applicant has also reviewed the pre-dose 
cortisol concentration data for all subjects and all periods of the study Infacort 002.  
Beside  the  use of  a  baseline  correction,  the  Applicant  has  also  realized  the  statistical  analysis  using  ANOVA 
model  including  and  excluding  individual  profiles  from  subjects  where  the  pre-dose  cortisol  demonstrates 
inadequate  suppression.  No  cut-off  values  for  cortisol  or  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH)  suppression 
were  specifically  defined  in  the  Infacort  001  and  Infacort  002  studies.  For  the  study  Infacort  001,  the 
Applicant  has  demonstrated  the  lack  of  impact  of  the  subjects  with  inadequate  cortisol  suppression  on  the 
bioequivalence conclusion with the 90% interval confidence of the baseline adjusted PK parameters evaluated 
being within the interval acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% when the subjects are included or not included 
from  the  statistical  analysis.  For  the  study  Infacort  002,  when  the  subject  where  pre-dose  cortisol 
demonstrated  inadequate  suppression  was  included  in  the  statistical  analysis,  the  90%  confidence  interval 
around  the  geometric  LS  means  ratio  T/R  was  outside  the  upper  acceptance  limit  for  Cmax  (100.45-129.15 
%). The underlying reason behind the high inadequate endogenous cortisol suppression value shown for this 
subject is unknown. However, no relevant difference to the concentration measured for other subjects in the 
study Infacort 002 has been shown for all other cortisol concentrations of this subject determined during the 
5  treatment  periods.  The  Applicant  has  therefore  decided  to  exclude  this  subject  in  view  of  the 
magnitude  of  unsuppressed  endogenous  cortisol  and  its  impact  on  bioequivalence  conclusion.  In 
comparison  to  the  study  Infacort  001,  the  Applicant  has  explained  the  lack  of  impact  of  the 
inclusion/exclusion of the subjects with inadequate cortisol suppression on the bioequivalence conclusions by 
the smaller magnitude of the unsuppressed endogenous cortisol than the one observed in the study Infacort 
002 for the subject 005. Even if the exclusion of the subject 005 should have been done according to criteria 
previously described in the protocol of the study, the analysis has been conducted using the 13 subjects and 
14  subjects  without  inadequate  endogenous  cortisol  suppression  for  the  hydrocortisone  20  mg  tablet 
treatment and the Infacort 20 mg treatment, respectively. This is still in accordance with the Guideline on the 
investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1), where the only criterion on the number of 
subjects  is the  minimum number,  which  is 12 evaluable subjects.  With  the  number  of  evaluable  subjects 
still  being  in  accordance  with  the  BE-guideline  and  the  clinical  monitoring  and  individualization  of  the 
hydrocortisone dose according to the patient response with the aim to give to the patient the lowest effective 
dosage,  knowing  that  the  90%CI  for  AUC  is  well  within  this  interval  and  the  unmet  medical  need,  it  is 
concluded  that  the  evidence  base  obtained  through  the  Phase  3  studies  is  relevant  to  the  proposed  hybrid 
application.  The  results  of  the  planned  population  PK  analysis  of  study  Infacort  003  will  also  help  to 
determine the optimal dosing regimen for this replacement therapy which is available in a dose-appropriate 
form designed for children. Results using baseline adjusted data excluding individual treatment profiles from 
subjects where the pre-dose cortisol demonstrated inadequate suppression were shown in the tables below.

Regarding the bioanalytical methods, the applied LC-MS-MS assay for the determination of cortisol in samples 
from studies Infacort 001, Infacort 002 and Infacort 003 was properly validated before sample analysis. No 
interference  was  observed  in  the  presence  of  dexamethasone,  which  was  co-administered  to  subjects  in 
Infacort 001 and 002. The potential interference of prednisolone is actually not an issue, since this compound 
was not taken by any patient in Infacort 003 (and prescribed drugs are not allowed in Infacort 001 and 002). 
The  absence  of  an  incurred  sample  reanalysis  in  Infacort  001  and  Infacort  002  was  accepted,  taken  into 
account that ISR acceptance was met in Infacort 003, even if reanalysis of solely samples initially analysed in 
a  single  batch  was  not  considered  to  be  fully  in  accordance  to  the  Guideline  on  bioanalytical  method 
validation’ (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). 
Despite  the  fact  that  the  assay  was  considered  sufficiently  validated,  it  was  noted  in  the  provided 
chromatograms  that  several  samples  were  re-integrated.  Reintegration  of  the  chromatograms  has  been 
performed  according  to  the  procedure  described  in  the  SOP.  They  led  to  only  small  adjustments  in 
concentrations  or  confirmed  the  absence  of  a  detectable  concentration.  The  impact  of  the  reintegrations  on 
the conclusions was therefore rather limited.  
No  drug-drug  interaction  study  has  been  conducted.  The  Applicant  mainly  focused  on  the  potential  of 
inhibitors  or  inducers  of  CYP3A4  on  the  PK  of  Alkindi®  and  the  need  for  dose  adjustment  in  case  of  co-
administration.  
The  Applicant  has  not  conducted  any  studies  in  patients  with  impaired  hepatic  or  renal  impaired  functions. 
This  has  been  adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  It  was  considered  acceptable  given  that  the  SmPC 
recommends  to  dose  the  patients  according  to  their  individual  response  and  to  monitor  them  clinically 
regardless of renal or hepatic status.

Conclusions on Pharmacokinetics  
Even if some uncertainties remained on the bioequivalence conclusions for Cmax for the studies Infacort 001 
and 002, knowing that bioequivalence could be confirmed with regards to AUC (0-t) and taking into account the 
results  from  the  clinical  studies  Infacort  003  and  004,  it  was  concluded  that  Alkindi  is  therapeutically 
equivalent  to  the  reference  products.  In  addition,  the  development  of  this  new  formulation  with  the  same 
type of granules for all capsule strengths fulfilled an unmet medical need in paediatric patients and each dose 
is  individually  titrated  based  on  the  actively  monitored  individual  clinical  response.  Altogether,  Alkindi  was 
considered to be  approvable.  CHMP  recommended that  the  results of  the  planned  population  PK  analysis  of 
study Infacort 003 are submitted in the first quarter of 2018 to help to determine the optimal dosing regimen 
for  this  replacement  therapy  which  is  available  in  a  dose-appropriate  form  designed  for  children;  the  data 
analysis  plan  should  be  submitted  as  well.  The  applicant  has  committed  to  address  and  implement  these 
CHMP Recommendations. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
In  study  Infacort  002,  one  of  the  arms  in  the  5-arm  healthy  adult  male  volunteer  crossover  study  was  no 
treatment,  which  allowed  endogenous  cortisol  levels  to  be  assessed.  These  results  showed  that  cortisol 
exhibits a circadian rhythm in serum, with peak concentrations occurring around 07:00 and the lowest levels 
occurring  at  around  24:00.  This  is  in  line  with  the  published  literature,  where  the  diurnal  pattern  of 
cortisol  is  well  established.  Additional  clinical  pharmacology  testing  in  study  Infacort  002  showed  that  the 
same  circadian  rhythm  for  cortisol  is  seen  in  saliva,  with  peak  concentrations  for  free  salivary  cortisol 
and cortisone occurring around 07:00 hours and the lowest levels seen at around 22:00 in saliva (compared 
to 24:00 hours in serum). Determination of serum cortisol, serum cortisone and free cortisol by a specialist 
laboratory using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry also showed the same circadian rhythm. 
When the free salivary cortisol Cmax was compared for endogenous levels (no treatment), oral Alkindi, IRHC 
tablets  and  i.v.  hydrocortisone,  values  were  higher  following  oral  Alkindi  (granules  in  capsules  for 
opening),  IRHC  tablets  and  i.v.  hydrocortisone  compared  to  endogenous  levels,  with  the  highest 
Cmax observed following Alkindi treatment. The high levels seen after Alkindi treatment occurred within the 
first hour post-dose (the majority of which occurred between 15 and 30 minutes post-dose). It is likely that 
these  high  readings  result  from  residual  matter  in  the  mouth  following  oral  dosing  rather  than  a  ‘true’ 
measurement  of  free  salivary  cortisol.  When  the  salivary  cortisone  Cmax  was  compared  for  endogenous 
levels,  oral  Alkindi,  IRHC  tablets  and  i.v.  hydrocortisone,  values  following  treatment  were  higher  than 
endogenous  levels,  with  the  highest  Cmax  following  i.v.  hydrocortisone.  No  oral  contamination  of  salivary 
cortisone was observed following treatment with the IRHC tablet and Alkindi. The free cortisol index (FCI), a 
surrogate  biomarker  for  serum-free  cortisol,  also  increased  with  salivary  cortisone  concentrations,  thus 
indicating  that  serum  cortisol  has  a  strong  correlation  with  salivary  cortisone  after  hydrocortisone 
administration. Thus salivary cortisone may be a better marker in saliva of circulating cortisol than 
salivary cortisol itself. 
The  PD  mechanism  of  action  of  hydrocortisone is  well documented  in the  literature  and  it  is  known  to  have 
profound  and  varied  metabolic  actions  on  carbohydrates,  proteins  and  fat,  anti-inflammatory  and 
immunosuppressive  functions.  Hydrocortisone,  in  common  with  other  glucocorticoids,  binds  to  the  cytosolic 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is activated by ligand binding. The newly formed receptor-ligand complex 
translocates into the cell nucleus, where it binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter 
region of the target genes, resulting in the regulation of gene expression. This process is commonly referred 
to  as  transactivation.  The  opposite  mechanism  is  called  transrepression.  The  activated  hormone  receptor 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 36/59 
  
  
interacts  with  specific  transcription  factors  (such  as  activator  protein  1  [AP-1]  and  nuclear  factor  kappa  B 
[NF-κB]) and prevents the transcription of targeted genes. Glucocorticoids (GC) are able to prevent the 
transcription of pro-inflammatory genes, including interleukins IL-1B, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-8, chemokines, 
cytokines,  granulocyte-macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor  (GM-CSF),  and  tumour  necrosis  factor  alpha 
(TNFα)  genes.  Glucocorticoids  have  also  been  shown  to  exert  a  number  of  rapid  actions  that  are 
independent  of  the  regulation  of  gene  transcription.  Binding  of  corticosteroids  to  the  GR  stimulates 
phosphatidylinositol  3-kinase  and  protein  kinase  B,  leading  to  endothelial  nitric  oxide  synthase  (eNOS) 
activation and nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation.  
Membrane-associated GR has been shown to mediate lymphocytolysis. 
The  physiological  effects  of  cortisol  and  hydrocortisone  are  also  well  documented.  Cortisol  has  widespread 
actions  on  metabolism  and  the  functioning  of  various  organs.  It  is  released  naturally  in  response  to  stress, 
acting  to  restore  homeostasis  in  a  number  of  body  systems,  including  glucose  metabolism  and  gastric  and 
renal secretion.  
In  addition  to  the  effects  of  cortisol  produced  by  binding  to  the  glucocorticoid  receptor,  because  of  its 
molecular similarity to aldosterone it also produces effects by binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor. 
Aldosterone  and  cortisol  have  a  similar  affinity  for  the  mineralocorticoid  receptor,  however,  glucocorticoids 
circulate at roughly 100 times the level of mineralocorticoids.  
These  PD  effects  of  Infacort  were  assessed  to  a  limited  extent  in  study  Infacort  002.  Cortisol 
circulates bound to plasma proteins, CBG, and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. Under basal conditions about 
5-10%  of  circulating  cortisol  is  free,  about  80%  is  bound  to  CBG,  and  the  remainder  is  bound  to  albumin. 
However,  it  is  the  free  hormone  that  is  active.  Normal  CBG  has  a  cortisol-binding  capacity  of  25μg/dL, 
with increases in total plasma cortisol concentrations above this level resulting in rapid increases in levels of 
free  cortisol  concentration.  The  cortisol-binding  capacity  of  albumin  is  greater  than  that  of  CBG,  but  its 
affinity  is  lower.  In  normal  individuals  there  are  circadian  fluctuations  in  the  capacity  of  CBG  for 
cortisol which are lost in patients on chronic replacement therapy. Levels of CBG are substantially lower in 
the  plasma  of  newborn  infants  than  those  found  in  adult  subjects  or  in  older  children.  Total  serum  cortisol 
levels are significantly affected by variation in CBG, therefore CBG (and albumin) levels were measured in the 
Infacort 002 study. Treatment with oral Alkindi, IRHC tablets and i.v. hydrocortisone was shown to have no 
effect on serum albumin and CBG levels, with similar values reported pre-dose and throughout the sampling 
period when compared to endogenous levels. 
Given  the  effects  of  cortisol/hydrocortisone  on  glucose  metabolism,  the  effects  of  treatment  with  oral 
Infacort, IRHC tablets and i.v. hydrocortisone on glucose levels and insulin sensitivity were evaluated in study 
Infacort 002. Very little effect on glucose and insulin levels or insulin sensitivity was seen after a single dose 
of Infacort, IRHC tablets and i.v. hydrocortisone  
In addition to the analyses conducted and reported in the main Infacort 002 study report, highly exploratory 
supplementary studies were conducted by academic groups to determine serum and urine metabolites, using 
the  samples  collected  within  study  Infacort  002.  Evaluation  of  metabolites  in  urine  showed  that 
administration  of  hydrocortisone  (Alkindi,  IRHC  tablet  and  i.v.  hydrocortisone)  increased  glucocorticoid 
metabolite excretion  into  the  urine  that  exceeded  endogenous levels of  metabolite production.  Increased  or 
decreased cortisol levels also induced changes in multiple metabolic pathways, primarily focused on catabolic 
metabolism, which are primarily regulated by cortisol. Interestingly, all of these metabolite classes were also 
perturbed  following  dexamethasone  administration,  showing  an  effect  of  low  cortisol  levels  interacting  with 
high  dexamethasone  levels.  It  is  important  to  emphasise  the  highly  exploratory  and  unconfirmed  nature  of

the  findings,  based  on  data  from  a  very  small  sample  of  healthy  adult  male  volunteers  measuring  a  large 
number of variables in the metabolome.  
Metabolomics is a very new, as yet unproven, and  developing area in medical science for which the current 
clinical value and utility is undetermined. The results from this exploratory study show that the metabolome 
is altered by the glucocorticoids dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, as would be expected. All 3 formulations 
of  hydrocortisone  show  similar  changes  in  the  metabolome,  although  for  Alkindi  some  of  these  changes  did 
not reach statistical significance, but this may simply be a reflection of the small number of subjects. Overall, 
there  were  not  thought  to  be  meaningful  differences  between  the  different  hydrocortisone  preparations, 
specifically between Infacort and IRHC tablets. 
2.4.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Main clinical study Infacort 003 
Hydrocortisone is an established treatment in humans and has been used as replacement therapy since 
the  1950s  [Kupperman  1955].  When  it  was  first  introduced  it  was  shown  to  rapidly  improve  prognosis  in 
patients  with  AI  [Dunlop  1963]  and  it  remains  the  mainstay  for  cortisol  replacement  therapy  to  this  day 
[Bancos  2014;  Martindale  2007].  A  global  survey  of  more  than  1000  patients,  mostly  with  primary  AI, 
showed that hydrocortisone was the most common treatment (75%), followed by prednisone or prednisolone 
(11%), cortisone (6%), and dexamethasone (4%) [Forss 2012]. 
Since  Alkindi  (granules  in  capsules  for  opening)  is  aimed  to  be  bioequivalent  to  IRHC,  its  efficacy  is 
expected  to  reflect  that  of  standard  hydrocortisone.  In  line  with  the  agreed  PIP,  the  only  study  needed  to 
evaluate  efficacy  in  the  target  patient  population  was  an  open-label, single  dose  study in children less 
than  6  years  of  age  (study  Infacort  003).  Study  Infacort  003  started  recruitment  in  March  2015,  and 
recruitment was completed in May 2016. The study was conducted at Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, or 
at  remote  satellite  sites  managed  by  Charité-Universitätsmedizin  Berlin,  in  a  total  of  24  paediatric 
patients under the age  of 6 years with diagnosed AI.  Each  child  received  a  single  oral  dose of  Alkindi 
based  on  their  previously  administered  standardised  dose  of  hydrocortisone.  Serum  cortisol  measurements 
from  the  1-hour  sample  were  taken  as  representative  of  peak  values  and  those  from  the  4-hour  sample  as 
being the best predictor of the AUC [Mah 2004]. In the oldest age group, additional samples were taken 
for population PK analysis.    
2.4.4.1.  Study population 
At entry into study Infacort 003, male or female subjects aged less than 6 years of age, with a diagnosis of 
AI  (as  confirmed  by  an  inappropriately  low  cortisol  level  plus  any  other  supporting  tests)  who  had  been 
receiving  appropriate  adrenal  replacement  therapy  (hydrocortisone  with/without  fludrocortisone)  were 
enrolled. The exclusion criteria for the trial program were limited to safety issues and so excluded subjects at 
risk  of  acute  adrenal  crisis,  those  who  had  an  intercurrent  illness,  or  if  they  were  receiving  a  medication  or 
had an underlying condition that might interfere with the trial procedures. None of these are thought to have 
a major impact on the target population, as any serious intercurrent illness, particularly if leading to inability 
to take oral medication, would indicate possible adrenal crisis and the patient would be switched to parenteral 
hydrocortisone therapy as per usual practice in paediatric endocrine centres. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 38/59 
  
  
The median ages of subjects entered into study Infacort 003 were in line with the recommended age cohorts 
of the study: median age of 1197.0 days (approximately 3 years, 3 months) in Cohort 1 (protocol 
defined as subjects 2 years to <6 years), 496.5 days (approximately 1 year, 4 months) in Cohort 2 
(protocol defined as subjects 28 days to <2 years), and 23.0 days in Cohort 3 (protocol defined as 
subjects <28 days). The majority of subjects (95.8%) were diagnosed with CAH, which reflects the usual 
diagnosis  of  AI  in  paediatric  patients.  Approximately  half  the  subjects  were  male,  which  again  reflects  the 
expected trend in this population. 
All of the subjects entered into study Infacort 003 were white, which reflects the predominant ethnicity of the 
patient population attending the study centre in Berlin, Germany. However, there is no indication that other 
ethnic groups would respond any differently to oral hydrocortisone. 
2.4.4.2.  Serum cortisol concentrations (primary endpoint) 
In study Infacort 003, the primary endpoint was the maximum level of serum cortisol concentration 
up to 240 minutes after intake of study drug (using samples taken at 0, 60 and 240 minutes post-dose), 
as  determined  by  the  central  laboratory.  This  endpoint  of  cortisol  levels  is  the  usual  measurement  in 
clinical  practice  for  ensuring  that  patients  with  AI  are  receiving  sufficient  cortisol  replacement  for 
exogenous  hydrocortisone  dosing.  The  Cmax  was  observed  at  60  minutes  post-dose  in  each  cohort 
and  this  was  selected  as a  representation  of  the  peak  values  (although  this  may  reflect  the  sampling times 
rather than the true Cmax).  
At Cmax a statistically significant increase was seen in cortisol levels compared to baseline for all 
cohorts combined (p<0.0001). Thus the primary endpoint of the study was met. When each cohort 
was  analysed  separately,  a  statistically  significant  difference  compared  to  baseline  was  seen  in  Cohort  1 
(p=0.0005), but for Cohorts 2 and 3, although all subjects showed an increase in cortisol, the difference from 
baseline  was  not  statistically  significant  (p=0.0313  at  the  1%  level).  This  lack  of  statistical  significance  is 
likely  to  be  due  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  and  it  should  be  noted  that  the  study  was  not  powered  to 
determine a difference in the individual cohort.  
A  secondary  analysis  of  the  serum  cortisol  levels  was  conducted  using  the  paired  t-test  to  assess  the 
sensitivity  of  the  data  to  a  different  statistical  test,  with  these  results  reflecting  those  seen  in  the  primary 
analysis, thus demonstrating the robustness of the study results. At Cmax (i.e. 60 minutes after Alkindi 
dosing),  serum  cortisol  levels  were  ≥150nmol/L  in  all  24  subjects,  with  the  level  of  150nmol/L 
(5.2 μg/dL) being reported as the median cortisol level in adults. It has been suggested [Mah 2004] 
that  adult  patients  should  be  dosed  at  a  level  to  achieve  a  peak  plasma  cortisol  concentration  in 
the  range  400-1000nmol/L  at  60  minutes  post-dose,  since  this  level  is  thought  to  be  associated  with 
optimal  replacement  therapy.  In  study  Infacort  003,  mean  peak  values  at  60  minutes  post-dose  were 
597nmol/L (based on the central laboratory analysis), thus achieving the limits set by Mah. 
The  second  timepoint  analysed  in  this  study  was  4  hours  post-dose,  which  is  thought  to  be  the 
best  predictor  of  the  AUC  [Mah  2004].  When  all  cohorts  were  combined,  the  overall  change  at  240 
minutes was still significantly greater than baseline (p=0.0026), but again when analysed by cohort, Cohorts 
2  and  3  did  not  show  a  statistically  significant  difference  from  baseline.  This  was  also  reflected  in  the 
categorical  analysis,  where  at  240  minutes  after  dosing,  10  subjects  (43.5%)  had  serum  cortisol  levels 
<50nmol/L,  10  subjects  (43.5%)  had  levels  of  50  to  <100nmol/L,  1  subject  (4.3%)  had  a  level  of  100  to 
<150nmol/L,  and  2  subjects  (8.7%)  had  levels  ≥150nmol/L  (only  23  subjects  had  evaluable  data  at  this 
timepoint). However, the number of subjects in each cohort was low and these cohorts were not individually

powered  for  statistical  significance.  In  addition,  it  is  known  that  there  is  wide  inter-individual  variability  in 
cortisol  AUC  following  administration  of  oral  hydrocortisone,  with  the  time  taken  to  reach  a  plasma 
concentration of <100nmol/L being documented as 289 minutes (range 140 -540 minutes). It is also known 
that  children  treated  with  hydrocortisone  experience  several  spikes  in  cortisol  concentrations 
throughout the day, but this is not associated with any acute detrimental clinical endpoints such 
as  hypoglycaemia,  lethargy,  or  change  in  cognitive  function.  Food  can  also  play  a  part  in  delaying 
hydrocortisone absorption and so prolong the response, so the fasting required pre- and post-dosing in this 
study  may  also  have  been  responsible  for  the  quicker  absorption  of  Alkindi.  Thus  it  is  difficult  to  attribute 
clinical significance to these findings. 
In  study  Infacort  003,  serum  cortisol  concentrations  were  evaluated  for  the  primary  analysis  using  i.v. 
sampling  and  the  results  were  analysed  by  the  central  laboratory  using  liquid  chromatography-tandem 
mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) methods. In addition, i.v. samples were analysed by the local laboratory at 
baseline and 60 minutes post-dose as a safety measure using radioimmunoassay kits to ensure all subjects 
achieved  adequate  cortisol  levels  post-dose.  In  addition,  blood  spots were  analysed  using  LC-MS-MS  for  a 
range  of  hormones  at  the  local  laboratory  as  an  exploratory  safety  measure.  A  summary  of  the  change 
from baseline for all these results is provided in Table 11.  
All the results showed the same trend, with high cortisol levels being seen in all 3 cohorts at 60 minutes post-
dose,  but  with  levels  falling  to  near  baseline  levels  by  240  minutes  post-dose.  The  youngest  children  in 
Cohort 3 showed the highest levels at both 60 and 240 minutes post-dose, which is probably related 
to  clinical  practice  where  neonates  are  usually  given  a  higher  dose  per  body  weight  compared  to  older 
children to stabilise their cortisol levels. This is supported by the fact that the neonates in Cohort 3 received a 
median  dose  of  2.0mg,  which  was  the  same  median  dose  as  the  older  infants  in  Cohort  2  (see  Table  10  in 
Infacort  003  CSR).  This  practice  of  a  higher  initial  dose  in  neonates  is  in  line  with  the  Lawson  Wilkins 
Paediatric  Endocrine  Society  and  The  European  Society  for  Paediatric  Endocrinology  Guidelines  that  suggest 
during infancy an initial reduction of markedly elevated adrenal sex hormones may require up to 25/m2/day 
hydrocortisone. Although the results using the different methods showed the same pattern, it is of note that 
the  results  for  serum  cortisol  using  the  local  laboratory  were  higher  than  those  recorded  by  the  central 
laboratory.  This  is  likely  to  be  attributable  to  different  methodologies  used  by  the  2  laboratories  for  the 
analysis,  since 
the  central 
laboratory  used  LC-MS-MS  and 
the 
local 
laboratory  used 
radioimmunoassay.  The  LC-MS-MS  method  is  the  gold  standard  method  for  steroid  analysis  and 
has high sensitivity and specificity, but not all local laboratories have this equipment. Thus it is an important 
point  for  clinicians  to  note  when  hydrocortisone  is  titrated  to  a  dose  that  sustains  the  serum  cortisol  levels 
within a set range, that different analytical methods can provide different absolute values. It is also of note 
that  the  results  using  blood  spot  analysis  were  notably  lower  than  the  results  obtained  using 
venous samples. The blood spot methodology is still exploratory and is not yet fully validated, but the aim 
was to see if cortisol levels could be adequately assessed using blood spots rather than having to take venous 
samples. This exploratory technique of blood spot analysis has been used in research studies in infants and 
has also been successfully taught to parents and used in the home to monitor paediatric cortisol levels in one 
study. The blood spot data from the Infacort 003 study, along with the blood spot data collected at 
the  end  of  the  Infacort  004  study  will  therefore  be  combined  and  analysed  at  a  later  date;  initial 
indications are that, possibly with the application of a conversion factor, cortisol levels could be monitored in 
the future using blood spot analysis.

2.4.4.3.  Palatability (secondary endpoint) 
In  studies  Infacort  001,  002  (in  healthy  adults)  and  003  (paediatric  with  AI)  all  patients  were  asked  to 
complete an age-appropriate assessment of acceptability and palatability [based on Davies 2008]. 
In  the  heathy  adult  studies,  the  majority  of  subjects  described  Alkindi  as  ‘not good  or  bad’  for  smell  (78.6-
87.5%  of  subjects),  feel  in  the  mouth  (42.9-68.8%  of  subjects)  and  taste  (57.1-81.3%  of  subjects),  with 
42.9-81.3%  of  subjects  describing  the  taste  as  ‘neutral’.  One  adult  subject  did  not  like  the  taste  of  the 
Infacort  granules  and  reported  an  adverse  event  (AE)  of  dysgeusia  following  the  2mg  Infacort  dose  and 
nausea after taking the 0.5mg dose. 
In  study  Infacort  003,  Alkindi  was  positively  received  by  parents/carers,  with  82.6%  of  parents/carers 
agreeing or strongly agreeing that their child found swallowing easy; 65.2% agreed or strongly agreed that 
their  child  showed  a  positive  reaction  after  Alkindi  was  given;  95.5%  would  be  happy  to  give  their  child 
Alkindi in the future; and 95.5% preferred Alkindi to the usual hydrocortisone medication. Positive responses 
predominated in all cohorts, even in Cohort 3 where subjects were aged <28 days: in this cohort all 6 of the 
parents/carers would be happy to give their child Alkindi in the future and all 6 preferred Alkindi to the usual 
hydrocortisone  medication.  In  study  Alkindi  003,  6  of  the  12  subjects  in  Cohort  1  completed  a  palatability 
questionnaire  (these  6  subjects  ranged  in  age  from  2.6  years  to  4.7  years).  The  subjects  generally  gave 
positive or neutral responses to the questions. It should be noted that the questionnaires used in this study 
were developed by the Sponsor for this study and are not validated in any way. There is a lack of validated 
questionnaires for the assessment of patient reported outcomes in children <5 years, and assessing patient 
perception in pre-school children is difficult.  
Although  the  majority  of  responses  were  neutral  or  positive,  some  subjects  did  not  like  the  taste,  with  this 
being attributable in some cases to the granules sticking in the mouth and so the taste-masking layer of the 
granules  wearing  off  before  the  granules  were  swallowed.  It  is  also  of  note  that  in  the  extension  study 
Infacort 004, 6 subjects withdrew from the study at the request of the parents/carers. In addition, one child 
refused  even  to  try  the  medicine  at  the  first  visit.  This  issue  was  investigated,  and  the  withdrawals  were 
attributable  to  the  8-hourly  dosing  regimen  used  by  this  centre,  which  means  that  the  children  had  to  be 
woken up late at night for their last dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 41/59 
  
  
 
Historically, these children received their night-time dose of hydrocortisone as an extemporaneously prepared 
sweetened  liquid  via  a  syringe  which  generally  did  not  result  in  the  child  being  woken  up  to  full 
consciousness. When this regime of night-time dosing was continued in the Infacort 004 study, replacing the 
locally prepared liquid formulation in a syringe with Alkindi  multiparticulate granules, the children had to be 
woken up to take the Alkindi dose but they were still sleepy and therefore less cooperative and took longer to 
swallow  their  dose  and  so  allowed  the  taste-masking  layer  to  start  to  dissolve.  This  problem  was  seen  in 
older children but did not appear to be a concern for younger children who had not yet become used to any 
particular  approach.  Carers  were  advised  to  contact  a  doctor  if the  patient  refused  medication  and  this was 
done  in  all  cases.  Following  on  from  these  cases,  and  based  on  in  vitro  data  that  has  recently  become 
available, a protocol amendment was implemented to allow parents/carers to mix Alkindi with yoghurt or fruit 
purees  to  facilitate  administration,  and  improve  the  acceptability  and  palatability  of  dosing  to  children.  This 
sprinkle approach is utilised for many paediatric products. 
Since  this  protocol  amendment  has  been  implemented,  there  have  been  no  further  withdrawals  from  the 
study. Diurnal is continuing its pre-planned work program of food compatibility testing to permit dosing of the 
multiparticulate granules with a variety of soft foods. 
2.4.4.4.  Efficacy data supporting dose selection 
There  is  no  reliable  biochemical  marker  to  assess  the  appropriateness  of  dose  in  glucocorticoid 
replacement treatment, and so dose modification is guided by clinical judgement and subjective perception 
of  symptoms  and  signs  of  glucocorticoid  under-replacement  and  over-replacement.  The  goal  is  to  achieve 
the best clinical result with the lowest possible daily dose of steroid. Since Alkindi is intended to be 
bioequivalent to IRHC, it should also be dosed based on the individual needs of the subject, but usually at a 
dosing interval of 3 times a day. 
The  lowest  possible  dosage  should  be  used  to  avoid  unwanted  effects  as  a  result  of  over-exposure  to 
hydrocortisone.  Typical  maintenance  doses  of  Alkindi  are  8-10mg/m2/day  for  patients  with  AI 
alone and 10-15mg/m2/day in patients with CAH, in 3 divided doses. This is based on the half-life of 
hydrocortisone  of  approximately  100  minutes.  In  patients  with  some  remaining  endogenous  cortisol 
production, a lower dose may be sufficient. This recommended dosing in study Infacort 003 yielded a mean 
peak  plasma  cortisol  concentration  of  597nmol/L,  which  is  within  the  optimal  replacement  therapy  range 
suggested by Mah [Mah 2004]. The highest maintenance dose of Alkindi studied in the clinical trials to date is 
31mg/m2/day (calculated by extrapolating the single dose exposure in the cohort to a 3 times a day regime 
as  used  at  the  study  site).  All  patients  should  be  observed  closely  for  signs  that  might  indicate  dosage 
adjustment is required, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or exacerbations of the 
disease, individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of stress (e.g. surgery, infection, trauma) since during 
stress, or when stress is anticipated, it may be necessary to increase the dose temporarily.

2.4.4.5.  Long-term efficacy data 
Despite  Study  Infacort  004  was  at  an  early  stage,  and  a  formal  analysis  of  efficacy  had  not  been 
conducted, it was noted that overall the children in the study seemed well. In particular, it was of note that 
no  cases  of  adrenal  crisis  have  been  reported,  despite,  as  would  be  expected  in  this  age  group,  numerous 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 42/59 
  
  
intercurrent illnesses being reported that needed a temporary increase in the dose of Alkindi. This preliminary 
information provided further supportive evidence of the efficacy of Alkindi.  
However, 7 of 18 enrolled patients have dropped out already from study Infacort 004 without detailing 
the  reasons  for  dropout  other  than  ‘withdrawal  of  consent’.  The  applicant  stated  that  since  changing  the 
method  of  administration,  allowing  the  product  to  be  administered  with  soft  food  or  yoghurt,  no  further 
dropouts have been reported.  
2.4.4.6.  Long-term use and development of tolerance 
AI  is  a  chronic  condition  and  all  subjects  will  require  replacement  hydrocortisone  for  life.  There  is  no 
evidence that the efficacy of hydrocortisone changes over time, thus there is no expectation that the 
efficacy  of  Alkindi  will  change  over time,  since  Alkindi  is  a  paediatric-specific presentation  of  hydrocortisone 
and is to be bioequivalent to IRHC (Refer to PK MO and OC).  
Only  preliminary,  unvalidated,  interim  safety  data  were  available  for  study  Infacort  004,  with  the 
mean duration of treatment up to the cut-off date of 26 August 2016 being 102 days (approximately 
3.5  months),  with  a  range  from  1-169 days  (1  day  to  5.6  months).  However,  there  was  no  indication  from 
the available data that there were any detrimental effects with long-term use or that tolerance develops over 
time.  
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study Infacort 003 was designed in line with the recommendations issued by the PDCO in the associated PIP 
(EMEA-001283-PIP01-12)  which  served  as  basis  for  the  development  plan  supporting  current  PUMA 
application. PIP compliance was confirmed by the PDCO in October 2016.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Infacort  003  was  designed  to  assess  peak  and  4  hour  cortisol  levels in  paediatric  patients  0-6  year 
following  a  single  dose  administration  of  Alkindi  identical  to  the  personalised  IRHC  doses  these  patients 
receive. Palatability was assessed as a secondary endpoint.  
Cmax cortisol levels were in the expected range at 1 hour following the single dose administration, but lower 
than expected at 4 hours following administration in a substantial number of patients. Since the product was 
administered  in  fasting  conditions,  which  are  unlikely  to  reflect  daily  practice,  and  a  limited  food  effect  on 
hydrocortisone is reported, cortisol levels might be different when administered with food.  
The impact of food on the peak drug level appears to be however limited with the peak drug level under 
fed  conditions  representing  about  85%  of  the  peak  drug  level  observed  under  fasting  conditions  and  after 
administration with 250 ml of water. In addition, a monitoring of the clinical response is recommended in 
the  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC.  No  food  effect  related  recommendation  was  available  in  the  SmPC  of  the 
reference product Hydrocortisone 10 mg Auden MacKenzie (PL 17507/0246 - study Infacort 001). Therefore, 
bioequivalence  should  preferably  be  tested  under  fasting  conditions  as  this  situation  would  be 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 43/59 
  
  
more sensitive to difference in pharmacokinetics. The bioequivalence studies Infacort 001 and Infacort 
002 were conducted under close to fasting conditions (a light meal or a standard breakfast have been given 
one hour after drug administration, while the EMA Guideline CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr** requires 
for fasting condition that no food is allowed at least 4 hours post-dose). Finally, the data gathered on efficacy 
and safety in the phase III clinical study Infacort 004 conducted under real life conditions were reassuring. 
It was initially unclear how palatability data from a single dose study could be extrapolated to reflect 
long  term  triple  daily  administration  of  the  product.  In  addition,  palatability  was  assessed  in  study  Infacort 
003  using  non-validated  questionnaires,  so  uncertainties  on  the  general  validity  of  these  data  were  raised. 
The palatability questionnaire used in study  Infacort 003 was not used in study Infacort 004, since Infacort 
004 was primarily designed as a safety study but practical experience from study Infacort 004 suggested that 
palatability might be less an issue than initially feared, as the administration was proposed to be modified on 
a  patient  per  patient  basis  ensuring  proper  administration  according  to  the  patient’s  preferences.  It  was 
noted that 2 patients dropped out of study Infacort 004 because they refused or spat out the medicine at the 
first  visit,  5  others  dropped  out  since  the  night  time  dosing  schedule  they  were  used  to,  could  not  be 
transposed onto the use of Alkindi as it interfered with the willingness to take up the medicine and the child’s 
sleeping pattern. 11 patients have since been taking Alkindi for about one year.  
The choices open to parents/carers to administer Alkindi either as dry granules washed down with fluid, or 
sprinkled onto soft foods, increase the acceptability of dosing of a medicine per se in this challenging age 
group and is expected to enhance palatability where necessary. The method of administration implies the use 
of yoghurt or fruit puree in children older than 6 months. Following practical experience, the method of 
administration in the SmPC was updated which now prefers sprinkling of the medicine onto soft food 
rather than mixing it, to further minimise palatability issues.  
It was considered that this approach should minimise palatability issues as much as possible in practice, as 
there were no further dropouts from the study reported further to the 5 patients that dropped out because of 
issues  with  the  night  time  dosing.  In  the  worst  case  scenario,  it  is  however  possible  that  these  5  patients 
represent the fraction of patients with most uptake issues for which none of the administration modifications 
would have made a difference. Nevertheless, this appeared hard to prove or to predict. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The  pivotal  efficacy  study  Infacort  003  in  children  aged  <6  years  of  age  with  primary  adrenal  insufficiency 
(PAI) was conducted in line with the agreed PIP. The patient population recruited in this study was considered 
representative  of  the  target  population.  The  primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  met,  with  a  statistically 
significant increase in serum cortisol levels observed at Cmax (60 min) compared to baseline serum cortisol 
levels with all subjects having cortisol levels above the clinically relevant limit at Cmax. The results were also 
supported  by  secondary  analyses.  Cortisol  levels  at  4  hour  post  administration  were  lower  than  projected. 
Limited long term data from study Infacort 004 support clinical efficacy. 
The  applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  how  the  currently  available  data  could  support  extrapolation  of 
efficacy and safety to the group of children > 6 years. as there are older children who are either unwilling or 
unable to swallow a solid tablet dose form and for whom, in the current treatment paradigm, oral dosing will 
require  compounding  the  hydrocortisone  tablets,  which  may  result  in  lack  of  dosing  precision.  In  addition 
dosage is individualised according to the clinical response of the individual patient. The applicant stated that 
bioequivalence to the well-established reference product has been confirmed using 10 mg and 20 mg doses 
and  suitable  strengths  of  Alkindi  (0.5mg,  1mg,  2mg  and  5mg)  are  available  for  use  by  older  and  therefore 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 44/59 
  
  
larger  children  dosed  on  a  mg/m2/day  basis,  and  thus  it  was  considered  that  the  current  dataset  could  be 
extrapolated to the >6 year-old paediatric age groups where clinically appropriate. The CHMP confirmed that 
current data do support the use also in children 6 year and older based on adult PK data and experience in 
the  0-6  year  age  patient group.  Therefore the therapeutic indication  was  amended  as  follows:  Replacement 
therapy of adrenal insufficiency in infants, children and adolescents (from birth to < 18 years old). 
Palatability questionnaires showed that Alkindi was positively received by healthy volunteers, parents/carers 
of paediatric subjects, and by the paediatric subjects themselves where subjects were old enough to respond 
to  a  specific  questionnaire.  It  is  of  note  that  95.5%  of  parents/carers  would  be  happy  to  give  their  child 
Alkindi in the future and 95.5% preferred Alkindi to the usual hydrocortisone medication. Limited data from 
Infacort 003 do point to possible palatability issues in the long term.  
2.4.7.   Clinical safety 
Immediate-release oral tablets of hydrocortisone have been approved and marketed worldwide (including in 
all  EU  countries)  for  more  than  50  years  and  the  safety  profile  of  hydrocortisone  immediate-release 
oral products has been extensively established [Martindale 2007]. As the physiological roles of cortisol 
are  fundamentally  similar  at  all  ages,  there  were  no  grounds  for  supposing  that  appropriately-dosed 
replacement  therapy  will  exhibit  any  differences  in  safety  between  adults  and  children  or  between  different 
paediatric  age  subgroups.  Also,  given  that  the  doses  of  hydrocortisone  in  all  the  studies  produced  serum 
cortisol concentrations that encompassed the physiological range, no new safety concerns were envisaged. 
The  risks  associated  with  Alkindi  use  described  in  the  following  sections  have  been  tailored  to  those 
associated  with  the  use  of  hydrocortisone  at  replacement  therapy  levels,  rather  than  including  all  effects 
associated with high therapeutic dosing as well. This should help to identify those risks that are most relevant 
to the use of Alkindi as replacement therapy in children. 
2.4.7.1.  Adverse effects characteristic of the pharmacological class 
Hydrocortisone  is  a  naturally-occurring  glucocorticoid  hormone  secreted  by  the  healthy  adrenal  cortex.  The 
goal of therapy in patients with AI is to replace this hormone to physiological levels in conditions where it is 
deficient. Such replacement therapy has been a routine part of medical care in both adults and children for 
more than 50 years and its safety profile is well understood [Martindale 2007]. Class effects of corticosteroids 
are well established and are dose-related.  
Although well established at high or therapeutic dose, the interactions and side-effects are not so commonly 
seen  at  replacement  doses  of  steroids  in  patients  lacking  innate  steroid  secretion.  In  the  SmPC  for  the 
reference  medicinal  product  (IRHC  manufactured  by  Auden  Mckenzie  PL  17507/0246),  the  adverse  effects 
were  separated  into  those  associated  or  potentially  associated  with  replacement  therapy  (and  therefore 
applicable for Alkindi) and those associated or potentially associated with use of high therapeutic doses (and 
therefore not considered applicable for Alkindi and therefore was not included in the SmPC.   
2.4.7.2.  Relevant animal toxicology and product quality information 
No non-clinical safety pharmacology studies have been performed with Alkindi owing to the well-established 
use of hydrocortisone in humans. A summary of published non-clinical data for hydrocortisone was provided, 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 45/59 
  
  
with the results showing no unexpected toxicity findings. There were no product quality issues that would be 
likely to impact on the safety of Alkindi. 
2.4.7.3.  Safety population and extent of exposure 
Four clinical studies contributed safety data in this dossier. Two of the studies (Infacort 001 and Infacort 002) 
were  single  dose  studies  in  healthy  adult  male  volunteers,  and  2  clinical  studies  (Infacort  003  and  Infacort 
004)  were  conducted  in  neonates,  infants  and  children  less  than  6  years  of  age.  Infacort  003  was  a  single 
dose  study  and  Infacort  004  was  a  long-term  multiple  dosing  extension  study  to  allow  subjects  treated  in 
Infacort 003 to continue treatment. Safety was evaluated in all 4 clinical studies by the collection of adrenal 
crisis  events;  implementation  of  sick  day  rules;  occurrence  of  AEs,  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  and  AEs 
leading  to  treatment  withdrawal;  and  changes  in  vital  signs,  safety  laboratory  parameters,  and 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), where evaluated.  
Studies Infacort 001 and Infacort 002 were single dose crossover studies in 30 healthy adult male volunteers 
and used single doses of Alkindi at 0.5mg, 2mg, 5mg, 10mg and 20mg. Study Infacort 003 was also a single 
dose study in which 24 children with AI were given a single dose of Alkindi at the same dose as their usual 
IRHC. The median individual doses of Alkindi were 2.50mg in Cohort 1 (children aged 2 years to <6 years), 
2.00mg in Cohort 2 (children aged 28 days to <2 years) and 2.00mg in Cohort 3 (infants aged <28 days). 
The only study to evaluate multiple dosing was study Infacort 004, in which subjects were dosed with Alkindi 
3  times  a  day.  To  date,  18  subjects  have  been  enrolled  in  this  study,  of  which  17  have  been  treated  (1 
subject refused the first dose and so was withdrawn from the study) and 11 subjects continuing in the study 
following the withdrawal of additional 6 subjects. 
The safety database on Alkindi itself is limited, with data collected on 30 healthy volunteers and 24 subjects 
<6 years of age with AI. However, since Alkindi is a new formulation of the established IRHC, and given the 
proposed bioequivalence of Alkindi to IRHC, this safety database is considered sufficient to demonstrate that 
treatment  with  Alkindi  does  not  raise  any  new  safety  issues  compared  to  IRHC.  Interim  data  from  study 
Infacort 004 provided some preliminary longer-term data after a mean of 102 days treatment (range 1-169 
days) up to the cut-off date of 26 August 2016. 
No subgroup analyses were performed regarding the safety data due to the small number of AEs reported. 
2.4.7.4.  Summary of common and non-serious adverse events 
In  the  healthy  volunteer  studies,  the only  treatment-emergent  adverse  event (TEAE)  that  occurred  in  more 
than 1 subject treated with Alkindi was oral hypoaesthesia, with this being reported by 2 subjects following 
administration of  10mg  Alkindi.  Both  events  were  considered  mild  and  of  probable  relationship  to the study 
medication  since  the  events  were  thought  to  reflect  increased  oral  sensitivity  to  the  larger  number  of 
granules  administered  at  the  10mg  Alkindi  dose  level.  Other  treatment-related  AEs  reported  in  the  healthy 
volunteer  studies  were  1  subject  who  reported  mild  dysgeusia  immediately  after  taking  the  2mg  dose  of 
Alkindi and mild nausea immediately after taking the 0.5mg dose of Alkindi. No action was taken for either of 
these AEs and the subject recovered from these events. In study Infacort 001, where 4 dose levels of 0.5mg, 
2mg,  5mg  and  10mg  Alkindi  were  used,  there  did  not  appear  to  be  any  dose-related  changes  in  the  TEAE 
profile. 
The most common TEAEs reported following a single dose of Alkindi in subjects with AI (study Infacort 003) 
were  diarrhoea  (3  subjects,  12.5%),  vomiting,  and  rash  (2  subjects,  8.3%  for  each  TEAE).  The  majority  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 46/59 
  
  
the  events  were  considered  mild,  with  only  1  subject  reporting  moderate  events  (moderate  vomiting  and 
moderate fatigue). None of the events were considered related to Alkindi treatment and all of the events are 
typically seen in young children. 
In study Infacort 004, where repeated dosing of Alkindi was carried out, the most common TEAE was pyrexia, 
which  occurred  in  almost  half  of  the  subjects  (47.1%).  In  the  majority  of  these  cases  the  pyrexia  was 
associated with a concomitant infection such as a viral infection, bronchitis, otitis media and nasopharyngitis 
and in all cases the dose of Alkindi was increased to prevent an adrenal crisis. All subjects recovered from the 
pyrexia  and  none  of  the  events  were  considered  related  to  Alkindi  treatment.  Five  TEAEs  reported  in  2 
subjects were considered of moderate severity: 1 subject reported moderate tooth injury, stomach ache and 
nausea, and another subject reported moderate bronchitis and pyrexia. 
No cases of subjects choking on the granules were reported. No TEAEs of adrenal crisis were reported in any 
of  the  studies.  As  noted  above,  8  subjects  in  study  Infacort  004  had  their  dose  of  Alkindi  temporarily 
increased when the child developed a fever, associated in most cases with an infection. This is usual clinical 
practice in the event of illness to prevent an adrenal crisis occurring and is in line with the sick day rules that 
are issued to the parents/carers of all children with AI. No subjects were withdrawn from the study due to an 
AE. No special approaches are needed for the monitoring of AEs with Alkindi beyond those that are used in 
routine clinical practice.  
2.4.7.5.  Serious adverse events 
No subjects in any of the studies reported an SAE or died during the study. 
2.4.7.6.  Clinical laboratory findings 
In  studies  Infacort  001  and  Infacort  002,  routine  biochemistry,  haematology  and  urinalysis  profiles  were 
evaluated for safety purposes. On several occasions isolated values were seen outside of the study centre’s 
normal ranges but none of these were considered to be clinically significant in the opinion of the examining 
physician. 
In  studies  Infacort  003  and  004,  routine  safety  biochemistry,  haematology  and  urinalysis  profiles  were  not 
evaluated. In study Infacort 003, cortisol levels were assessed at the local laboratory 60 minutes after dosing 
with Alkindi to ensure adequate cortisol levels were achieved, with this being seen in all subjects. 
No changes in laboratory parameters in any study were reported as an AE. 
2.4.7.7.  Other safety observations 
Isolated  vital  signs  and  ECG  values  outside  of  the  study  centre’s  normal  ranges  were  seen  in  the  studies 
where  these  were  measured,  but  none  of  these  changes  were  considered  to  be  clinically  significant  in  the 
opinion of the examining physician. No changes in vital signs or ECGs in any study were reported as an AE. 
No changes in vital signs or ECG parameters have been reported in the published literature following use of 
hydrocortisone. 
2.4.7.8.  Methods to prevent, mitigate, or manage adverse events 
Adrenal  crisis  occurs  in  patients  with  AI  who  have  an  intercurrent  illness  or  stress.  Adrenal  crisis  is  a  life-
threatening  emergency  and  therefore  prevention  is  of  key  importance.  The  frequency  of  adrenal  crisis  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 47/59 
  
  
patients with AI has been reported as 6-8 for 100 patient years, with about half of patients with AI reporting 
at least one previous adrenal crisis. The most frequent precipitating causes are gastroenteritis and fever (60-
70%),  but  other  stressful  events  can  also  cause  crises,  such  as  trauma,  surgery,  a  dental  procedure,  and 
major psychological distress. 
No  events  of  adrenal  crisis  were  seen  in  the  Alkindi  clinical  studies.  Where  events  that  could  lead  to  an 
adrenal crisis occur, they can be managed by the implementation of sick day rules. These sick day rules are 
given to all patients and describe the procedure in the event of an intercurrent illness, which usually involves 
additional  doses  of  hydrocortisone.  This  is  usual  clinical  practice  for  patients  receiving  hydrocortisone 
replacement therapy. 
Although the majority of responses to the palatability questionnaire were neutral or positive, some subjects 
in  Cohort  1  (aged  2  to  6  years  of  age)  who  completed  the  children’s  questionnaire  did  not  like  the  taste, 
particularly if the granules stuck in the mouth and so the taste-masking layer of the hydrocortisone wore off 
before  the  granules  were  swallowed.  Previously  it  was  advised  that  the  granules  were  washed  down  with 
water,  breast  milk,  formula  milk  or  whole  milk.  However,  new  in  vitro  food  compatibility  studies  have  been 
conducted, and it was agreed that for children who are able to take soft food, the granules may be sprinkled 
onto  a  spoonful  of  cold  or  room  temperature  soft  food  (such  as  yoghurt  or  fruit  puree)  and  given 
immediately. 
2.4.7.9.  Overdose, dependence, rebound effects, or drug abuse 
Reports  of  acute  toxicity  and/or  deaths  following  hydrocortisone  overdose  are  rare.  Overdose  or  prolonged 
use  of  hydrocortisone  (in  common  with  other  corticosteroids)  can  exaggerate  some  of  the  normal 
physiological actions of cortisol leading to mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid side-effects. Mineralocorticoid 
side-effects include hypertension, sodium and water retention, and potassium and calcium loss. These side-
effects can be significant with hydrocortisone. 
Glucocorticoid  side-effects  include  diabetes  and  osteoporosis  (particularly  in  the  elderly).  Muscle  wasting 
(proximal myopathy) may also occur. Corticosteroid therapy is also weakly linked with peptic ulceration and 
perforation. High doses of corticosteroid can cause Cushing’s syndrome with moon face, striae and acne. In 
children, administration of corticosteroids may result in the suppression of growth. 
No cases of overdose were reported in any of the clinical studies. As noted in the Alkindi SmPC the biological 
half-life of hydrocortisone is approximately 100 minutes. No antidote is available.  
Treatment is probably not indicated for reactions due to chronic overdosing unless the subject has a condition 
that  would  render  him/her  unusually  susceptible  to  ill  effects  from  hydrocortisone.  In  which  case, 
symptomatic treatment should be instituted as necessary and if necessary hydrocortisone can be removed by 
dialysis.  Anaphylactic  and  hypersensitivity  reactions  may  be  treated  with  adrenaline,  positive-pressure 
artificial respiration and aminophylline.  
AI is a chronic condition and all subjects will require replacement hydrocortisone for life so dependence is not 
a real consideration. However, there are no data to suggest that hydrocortisone has dependence potential. 
Since Alkindi was considered to be bioequivalent to IRHC, no withdrawal or rebound effects were anticipated 
when  Alkindi  treatment  was  switched  to  IRHC  treatment  or  vice  versa.  Psychological  effects  have  been 
reported on withdrawal of corticosteroids, but the relevance of this to withdrawal of Alkindi is unlikely in view 
of the indication (replacement therapy). 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 48/59 
  
  
Drug abuse was not expected with Alkindi. No studies have been undertaken to investigate the dependence 
potential of Alkindi. 
2.4.8.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Alkindi, in the low number of patients included in Infacort 003, was in line with the 
historical experience with IRHC. No choking events have been reported. 
The statements regarding high therapeutic dosing that are included in Special warnings and precautions for 
use section of the SmPC of the reference medicinal product were removed from the product information of 
Alkindi during the procedure as high therapeutic dosing (e.g. for immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory 
effect) is not recommended for Alkindi. 
2.4.9.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Immediate-release oral tablets of hydrocortisone have been approved and marketed worldwide (including in 
all  EU  countries)  for  more  than  50  years  and  the  safety  profile  of  hydrocortisone  immediate-release  oral 
products  has  been  extensively  established  [Martindale  2007].  As  the  physiological  roles  of  cortisol  are 
fundamentally similar at all ages, there were no grounds for supposing that appropriately-dosed replacement 
therapy  would  exhibit  any  differences  in  safety  between  adults  and  children  or  between  different  paediatric 
age  subgroups.  Also,  given  that  the  doses  of  hydrocortisone  in  all  the  studies  produced  serum  cortisol 
concentrations  that  encompassed  the  physiological  range,  no  new  safety  concerns  were  envisaged.  The 
choking risk was further addressed in the RMP.

2.6.  Pharmacovigilance  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the fact that the current application concerns only population of paediatric patients and paediatric-
specific formulation, the CHMP is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for Alkindi is needed, 
as it cannot follow the already existing entry for hydrocortisone. The requirements for submission of 
periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP 
Opinion. The applicant did not request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international birth date 
(IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
Disease or condition 
Congenital primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is the most common aetiology of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in 
infants and children from birth to <6 years age group for which Alkindi was developed, and is mostly due to 
congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which results from a deficiency in one of several enzymes (most 
commonly 21-hydroxylase) required for adrenal synthesis of cortisol. 
CAH accounts for 95% of AI cases in children and has an incidence of 1:10,000 to 1:16,000 live births in the 
European and North American populations [Nimkarn 2002]. Symptoms of AI most often develop with 
combined deficiencies of cortisol and aldosterone and result in androgen excess that clinically manifests in 
disordered sexual development in girls, precocious pseudopuberty with clitoral and penile enlargement, and 
short stature, and in adulthood with hirsutism in females and fertility problems in both sexes. With proper 
treatment and compliance, patients with cortisol deficiency can live a near normal life span without 
limitations. However, the prognosis for an untreated patient is poor. Death is a common outcome, usually 
from adrenal crisis precipitated by infection. 
Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The usual treatment for AI is glucocorticoid replacement using hydrocortisone, which has been a routine part 
of medical care in both adults and children with AI for more than 50 years. The aim of treatment is to replace 
cortisol and, in CAH, prevent ACTH-driven androgen excess [Dauber 2010]. 
This  is  challenging,  since  therapy  aimed  at  normalising  ACTH  and  reducing  androgen  levels  can  result  in 
excess  glucocorticoid  exposure  with  associated  complications  including  short  stature,  obesity,  hypertension 
and  an  adverse  metabolic  profile.  Striking  the  balance  between  too  much  and  too  little  glucocorticoid 
treatment  is  especially  difficult  as  currently  available  glucocorticoid  formulations  cannot  replicate  the 
circadian  rhythm  of  cortisol  secretion  and  are  not  formulated  for  the  paediatric  population.  Thus  adult 
hydrocortisone tablets have to be ground to a powder by a pharmacist and the estimated dose encapsulated 
and provided to the parents, who must then try to administer the bitter-tasting crushed tablet as best as they 
can. This leads to imprecise dosing and the associated risks of under- or over-dosing. 
Main clinical studies 
This  application  concerns  a  hybrid  version  of  hydrocortisone  tablets.  The  reference  product  Hydrocortisone 
10mg  Tablets  is  indicated  for  use  as  re-placement  therapy  in  primary,  secondary,  or  acute  adrenocortical 
insufficiency  and  preoperatively,  and  during  serious  trauma  or  illness  in  patients  with  known  adrenal 
insufficiency  or  doubtful  adrenocortical  reserve.  Nonclinical  studies  have  not  been  provided  for  this 
application  and  this  was  not  considered  necessary.  From  a  clinical  perspective,  this  application  did  contain 
new  data  on  the  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  as  well  as  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  active 
substance. 
Two  bioequivalence  studies  Infacort  001  and  Infacort  002  have  been  conducted  in  healthy  adult  male 
volunteers  to  compare  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  new  formulation  Alkindi  2x5mg  and  4x5mg  with 
hydrocortisone immediate release tablets 10 mg and 20 mg, respectively. The dose proportionality of Alkindi 
at doses of 0.5 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg was also investigated in the study Infacort 001. Another primary 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 51/59 
  
  
aim of the study Infacort 002 was to determine the absolute bioavailability of cortisol from Alkindi granules 
and hydrocortisone tablets using intravenous hydrocortisone as the reference injection. 
The main clinical efficacy study was Infacort 003 in neonates, infants and children younger than 6 years with 
PAI, in which Cmax levels of serum cortisol following a single administration was the primary endpoint. 
Infacort 003 included 24 AI patients and convincingly met the primary endpoint. Palatability was a secondary 
endpoint in the above study. 
Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Quality 
To mask the bitter taste of hydrocortisone, the granules are coated with a taste-masking layer. The originally 
proposed  dissolution  test  did  not  demonstrate  that  the  taste-masking  layer  is  effective  and  consistent  from 
batch to batch. This issue was considered resolved since an additional dissolution test was developed by the 
applicant to control the taste mask coating. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Even if some uncertainties remained on the bioequivalence conclusions for Cmax for the studies Infacort 001 
and 002, knowing that bioequivalence has been shown for AUC(0-t) and taking into account the results from 
the  clinical  studies  Infacort  003  and  004,  it  was  concluded  that  Alkindi  is  therapeutically  equivalent  to  the 
reference products. In addition, the development of this new formulation with the same type of granules for 
all  capsule  strengths  responds  to  an  unmet  medical  need  in  paediatric  patients  and  each  dose  should  be 
individually  titrated  based  on  the  actively  monitored  individual  clinical  response.  The  results  of  the  planned 
population  PK  analysis  of  study  Infacort  003  that  is  planned  to  be  submitted  post-authorisation  will  help  to 
determine the optimal dosing regimen for this replacement therapy which is available in a dose-appropriate 
form designed for children. 
Clinical 
The  new  formulation  was  developed  to  ensure  proper  dosing  and  replacement  therapy  for  children  with  AI, 
from birth on. In the drug development program presented in the PIP, it was stated that the pharmacokinetic 
data collected in the adult healthy volunteers studies will be used to determine a dose (in terms of mg/m2 of 
body surface area) that can be expected to yield both (i) a peak plasma cortisol concentration in the range 
400-1000  nmol/l  and  (ii)  a  concentration  at  4  hours  post-dose  of  100-300  nmol/l.  These  were  the  values 
found by Mah et al (2004) to be associated with optimal replacement therapy. The observed cortisol levels 
at 4 hour following dosing were lower than projected and could theoretically point to efficacy concerns 
of the product; however no such signals were observed in the long term study Infacort 004.  
Palatability  was  another  important  aspect  identified  in  the  efficacy  testing  of  the  new  hydrocortisone 
formulation.  Hydrocortisone  by  itself  has  a  bitter  taste,  therefore,  the  granules  are  coated  with  a  taste-
masking  layer.  Palatability  was  tested  in  the  target  population  through  company  developed  questionnaires, 
either for carers/parents or for the patients in cohort 1 aged >2 to 6 years. The questionnaires’ results were 
considered  encouraging.  However,  it  was  unclear  whether  there  has  been  a  formal  quality  testing  of  these 
questionnaires, which were developed specifically for the Infacort 003 study. Such testing would at least add 
some  validity  to  the  questionnaire  results,  as  for  now  it  is  unclear  to  what  extent  these  questionnaires 
capture  the  full  palatability  spectrum  as  experienced  by  patients  and  carers/parents.  The  issue  was 
considered resolved since long term data from study Infacort 004 indicated that a patient-tailored method of 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 52/59 
  
  
administration is the preferred approach to ensure adequate uptake of the medicine by the young patients. A 
major drawback of the current program is the absence of long term palatability data. The shear nature 
of  the  disease  implies  lifelong,  multiple  daily  administrations  of  hydrocortisone.  Therefore,  palatability 
conclusions  based  on  the  administration  of  a  single  dose  only  were  considered  insufficient  to  support  long 
term  treatment  recommendations  for  hydrocortisone  granules.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  list  and  discuss 
long-term palatability issues already encountered in clinical study Infacort 004 and all actions undertaken to 
address these. In addition, long term (1 year) Infacort 004 palatability data were provided and reviewed in 
the  subsequent  steps of  the  MAA  procedure.  There was  no  formal palatability  testing in  study  Infacort 004. 
However, by applying a patient-tailored method of administration, adequate uptake of the medicine could be 
ensured.  
Long-term experience with Alkindi administration in study Infacort 004 did not indicate that administration 
with soft food or washing down with liquid would  interfere  with  efficacy of  the  treatment.  Fasting was 
imposed  pre  and  post  dosing  in  study  Infacort  003.  In  study  Infacort  004  and  in  the  agreed  SmPC, 
administration  of  the  drug  sprinkled  over  food  was  supported.  However,  such  administration  is  not 
applicable  in  the  youngest  age  group,  i.e.  neonates  and  infants  0-6  months.  The  EMA  Guideline  on 
pharmaceutical  development  of  medicines  for  paediatric  use  (EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012  Rev.  2)  states 
that powders and granules may be given to children from birth provided they can be administered as a liquid 
preparation. This would enhance safety and ease of administration compared to current clinical practice. The 
applicant  was  asked  to  comment  whether  administration  of  granules  suspended  in  a  small  volume  of  liquid 
can  be  recommended  for  neonates  and  infants  0-6  months,  taking  into  account  the  effect  on  the  taste-
masking  coating,  and  administration  problems  encountered  in  daily  practice  in  the  youngest  patient  group. 
Following  the  experience  with  administration  of  the  study  drug  in  the  long  term  study  Infacort  004,  it  was 
recommended to sprinkle the drug onto soft food for administration in the older segment of the patient group 
(6  months  to  6  year),  in  case  this  was  considered  to  improve  drug  administration.  In  the  youngest  patient 
group,  the  granules  are  either  poured  directly  onto  the  child’s  tongue,  or  the  granules  are  poured  onto  a 
spoon  and  placed  in  the  child’s  mouth.  In  both  patient  groups  administration  is  immediately  followed  by 
washing down with liquid. The experience from study Infacort 004 indicated that both methods were suitable 
for  administration  and  no  safety  issues  related  to  the  method  of  administration  were  detected  in  this  small 
patient group.  
It should be noted that Alkindi has not been studied in pre-term infants. Pre-term infants born with AI would 
need replacement hydrocortisone and there was no evidence to suggest that Alkindi would present a greater 
risk in this age group compared to neonates and older children. However, caution is recommended in treating 
this  age  group.  The  product  is  contra-indicated  in  pre-term  patients  where  oral  feeding  has  not  yet  been 
established.  
The  applicant  was  requested  to  discuss  how  the  currently  available  data  could  support  extrapolation  of 
efficacy and safety to the group of children > 6 years as there are older children who are either unwilling or 
unable to swallow a solid tablet dose form and for whom, in the current treatment paradigm, oral dosing will 
require  compounding  the  hydrocortisone  tablets,  which  may  result  in  lack  of  dosing  precision.  In  addition 
dosage is individualised according to the clinical response of the individual patient. The applicant stated that 
bioequivalence to the well-established reference product has been confirmed using 10 mg and 20 mg doses 
and  suitable  strengths  of  Alkindi  (0.5mg,  1mg,  2mg  and  5mg)  are  available  for  use  by  older  and  therefore 
larger  children  dosed  on  a  mg/m2/day  basis,  and  thus  it  was  considered  that  the  current  dataset  could  be 
extrapolated to the >6 year-old paediatric age groups where clinically appropriate. The CHMP confirmed that 
current data do support the use also in children 6 year and older based on adult PK data and experience in 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 53/59 
  
  
the  0-6  year  age  patient group.  Therefore the therapeutic indication  was  amended  as  follows:  Replacement 
therapy of adrenal insufficiency in infants, children and adolescents (from birth to < 18 years old). 
Unfavourable effects 
The  risks  associated  with  the  use  of  oral  hydrocortisone  are  well  established.  However,  at  physiological 
replacement doses there are no major-concern side-effects of hydrocortisone therapy. 
The doses of hydrocortisone used in all the studies submitted in this dossier resulted in serum concentrations 
that  are  within  the  physiological  range.  IRHC  oral  tablets  have  been  approved  and  marketed  worldwide 
(including  in  all  EU  countries)  for  more  than  50  years.  Alkindi  hydrocortisone  multiparticulate  granules  are 
not considered to present any additional important safety risks when used at physiological replacement doses 
in paediatric patients with AI. 
Whilst there is evidence that Alkindi is absorbed in adults to the same extent as conventional hydrocortisone, 
investigators  should  be  alert  to  failure  of  Alkindi  to  be  absorbed,  e.g.  if  the  child  vomits  or  spits  out  the 
granules.  This  may  manifest  as  symptoms  of  relative  AI.  This  should  be  treated  with  supplemental 
hydrocortisone  in  the  normal  clinical  manner.  Patients  should  be  observed  closely  for  signs  that  dose 
adjustment might be required, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or exacerbations 
of  the  disease,  individual  drug  responsiveness,  and  the  effect  of  stress  (e.g.  surgery,  infection,  trauma). 
During stress it may be necessary to increase the dose temporarily. It should be noted that these risks are 
applicable to all forms of hydrocortisone administered to the child and are not Alkindi-specific.  
Discontinuation of Alkindi because the child does not like the taste can be considered as a potential risk, as 
discontinuation  of  Alkindi  without  immediate  replacement  with  another  hydrocortisone  formulation  could 
result in re-emergence of AI symptoms. However, parents of children with AI are aware of the importance of 
hydrocortisone  replacement  and  are  in  close  contact  with  their  endocrinology  team.  As  such,  the  risk  with 
Alkindi  is  no  greater  than  the  risk  with  any  other  hydrocortisone  product,  including  extemporaneous 
compounded products. 
A possible risk from swallowing Alkindi granules is the risk of choking. Since it has been shown that children 
above  6  months  of  age  can  safely  swallow  pellets  of  2mm  diameter,  the  applicant  considers  the  Alkindi 
granule diameter of <800μm  acceptable to all the age groups planned to be treated with Alkindi and the risk 
of choking is low. It is also worthy of note that some other products used in neonates for example, used for 
the  treatment  of  pancreatic  exocrine  insufficiency  in  babies,  have  a  granule  size  of  0.5-1.0mm,  which  is 
comparable to the proposed Alkindi product in terms of granule size. This product has been tested in infants 
and  toddlers  and  has  proved  to  be efficacious  and  safe  with  no  choking  incidents  reported  [Colombo  2009; 
Munck  2009].  Thus,  the  risk  of  choking  is  assumed  to  be  negligible  and  certainly  much  less  than  that 
associated  with  the  current  treatment  practice  of  administering  crushed  tablets.  There  were  no  choking 
events reported in Infacort 003 and 004 studies.  
As  the  Alkindi  granules  are  contained  in  a  capsule,  there  is  a  potential  risk  that  parents  and  carers  will 
inadvertently  attempt  to  administer  the  capsule  to  their  child  rather  than  opening  the  capsule  and 
administering the granules. As the capsule is a common pharmaceutical form, ingestion of the capsule would 
simply  provide  a  delay  to  the  absorption  of  the  hydrocortisone  dose  by  approximately  5  minutes  as  the 
capsule disintegrates. Therefore there is no toxicity concern from ingestion of the capsule, but there could be 
a  concern  regarding  choking.  To  mitigate  this  concern,  wording  and  diagrams  on  the  packaging  of  Alkindi

granules  have  been  proposed,  as  well  as  in  the  SmPC  and  the  patient  information  leaflet.  Routine 
pharmacovigilance will ensure that any reports of choking are investigated. 
Other  potential  risks  that  are  associated  with  replacement  doses  of  hydrocortisone  include  growth 
retardation,  psychiatric  effects,  effects  on  bone  mineral  density,  and  interactions  with  some  other  drugs. 
Potential  interactions  associated  with  therapeutic  dose  use  are  infection  risk,  effects  on  electrolytes,  optic 
effects,  myocardial  infarction,  comorbidities,  fat  embolus,  hypothyroidism  or  cirrhosis,  effects  on 
spermatozoa mobility, diabetes risk, menstrual irregularities, and anaphylaxis. These risks are more related 
to  high  therapeutic  doses  of  corticosteroids  and  so  may  not  occur  at  replacement  therapy  doses  of 
corticosteroids.  Also,  none  of  these  potential  risks  are  thought  to  be  any  greater  with  Alkindi  compared  to 
IRHC tablets. 
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
IRHC has a longstanding history in the treatment of AI, and is the recommended treatment option in children 
with  AI,  with  manageable  safety  risks  associated  with  treatment  (Bornstein  et  al.,  2016;  Speiser  et  al., 
2010).  
There are sparse data on the long term effects and use of the product. The applicant reported the long term 
(efficacy  and)  safety  data  from  study  Infacort  004.  It  is  acknowledged  that,  although  IRHC  is  used  in  the 
paediatric  population  for many  decades,  there  are sparse  long term  data  available  from  clinical trials in  the 
paediatric population. In addition, long term randomised controlled trials in the paediatric population are non-
existing.  Long  term  safety  data  from  study  Infacort  004,  investigating  Alkindi  treatment  in  a  small  patient 
group for up to one year, have not revealed novel safety issues.  
In the Infacort 004 study, for which interim data were presented, 6 out of 18 patients enrolled dropped out of 
the  study  because  of  withdrawal  of  consent.  In  two  cases  there  were  issues  with  the  administration  of  the 
IMP,  leaving  four  subjects  for  which  no  reason  for  withdrawal  is  known.  The  CHMP  considered  this  high 
number  of  dropouts  as  worrisome,  and  the  applicant  was  requested  to  further  comment  on  the  reasons  for 
dropout  of  these  4  cases  that  are  all  part  of  the  older  age  cohort,  >2  to  6  year.  In  particular,  this  high 
dropout rate was in obvious contrast with the high positive response rates reported in Infacort 003 regarding 
palatability  and  preference  of  Alkindi  over  standard  hydrocortisone  treatment,  suggesting  palatability  data 
from  a  single  dose  study  should  not  be  extrapolated  as  such  to  chronic,  long  term  dosing.  The  applicant 
explained that the 4 dropouts were due to inadequate night dosing of Alkindi which required the children to 
be woken up fully in order to ensure adequate uptake of the product. Following this observation, the method 
of  administration  was  adjusted  allowing  the  medicine  to  be  sprinkled  upon  food  prior  to  administration 
resulting in no further dropouts.

Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Hydrocortisone  is  a  well-established  and  preferred  pharmaceutical  treatment  option  for  AI  in  children, 
including the most prevalent form of PAI, i.e. CAH (Bornstein et al., 2016; Speiser et al., 2010). The benefit-
risk  of  the  active  substance  as  such  is  therefore  considered  positive  in  the  treatment  of  PAI  in  children.  Of 
note, in the Infacort 003 study, 23 of 24 patients were suffering from CAH. 
The  proposed  benefit  of  Alkindi  over  current  standard  IRHC  treatment  in  children  0-6  years  with  PAI  is 
comprised  of  two  components:  a  pharmaceutical  form  which  is  more  suited  for  administration  in  this 
population and which should ensure a more precise dosing.  
Alkindi granules and packaging allow for a more precise dosing than current tablet crushing and weighing and 
is an important aspect of stable IRHC treatment.  
The  second  advantage  relates  to  the  administration  itself,  in  which  two  aspects  can  be  discerned.  First,  the 
granule  formulation  should  allow  more  appropriate  administration  to  paediatric  patients,  as  long  as  the 
product can be sprinkled over soft foods prior to administration, in patients from 6 months of age (European 
Medicines  Agency,  2014).  The  updated  SmPC  contains  clear  recommendations  on  how  the  product  can  be 
safely and efficiently administered, three times daily, in the 0-6 month age group.  
The effectiveness and batch to batch consistency of the taste-masking film is now controlled by a specific in 
vitro dissolution test and adequacy of the taste masking film when the granules are mixed with soft food was 
demonstrated by in vitro data.  
Some  uncertainties  remained  on  the  bioequivalence  conclusions  between  Alkindi  and  hydrocortisone  10  mg 
and 20 mg reference tablets for Cmax. However, since the IC 90% around the geometric LS means ratio T/R 
for 10 mg and 20 mg hydrocortisone orally administered doses are within the acceptance range 80-125 % for 
the primary parameters AUC0-t and considering the clinical monitoring in place and the individualization of the 
hydrocortisone  dose  according  to  the  patient’s  response,  with  the  aim  of  giving  the  patient  the  lowest 
effective dose, the clinical impact of this observation was considered limited. Furthermore, when considering 
Assessment report  
EMA/4145/2018 
Page 57/59 
  
  
 
 
 
the  impact  of  this  observation,  it  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  this  application  does  concern  a  hybrid 
application  in  accordance  with  article  10(3)  of  the  Directive  2001/83/EC  and  relies  thus  also  in  part  on  the 
results from the clinical studies Infacort 003 and 004. 
Balance of benefits and risks 
IRHC is the current standard of care for the envisaged patient population. For the youngest patient group, i.e. 
0-6 year of age, a more suitable pharmaceutical form of the product, replacing crushed tablets, is welcomed 
in terms of more precise dosing and palatability (masking of bitter taste).  
In addition current data do support the use in children 6 year and older based on adult PK data and 
experience in the 0-6 year age patient group. There are older children who are either unwilling or unable 
to swallow a solid tablet dose form and for whom, in the current treatment paradigm, oral dosing will require 
compounding  the  hydrocortisone  tablets  that  may  result  in  lack  of  dosing  precision.  Therefore  also  these 
patients  could  also  benefit  from  the  administration  of  Alkindi.  Therefore  it  was  proposed  to  amend  the 
therapeutic  indication  as  follows:  Replacement  therapy  of  adrenal  insufficiency  in  infants,  children  and 
adolescents (from birth to < 18 years old). This updated wording was accepted by the applicant.  
The  coated  IRHC  granules  in  present  application  do  allow  for  a  very  precise  and  reproducible  dosing.  
Palatability  issues  that  were  reason  for  concern  at  first  appeared  to  be  adequately  dealt  with,  and  the 
SmPC  now  contains  clear  recommendations  concerning  the  method  of  administration  in  the  respective  age 
groups.  Effectiveness  and  batch  to  batch  consistency  of  the  taste  masking  coating  are  now  controlled  by  a 
specific in vitro dissolution test.   
Even though some uncertainties remained on the bioequivalence conclusions for Cmax for the studies Infacort 
001 and 002, knowing that bioequivalence can be concluded for AUC(0-t) and taking into account the results 
from the clinical studies Infacort 003 and 004, it is concluded that Alkindi is therapeutically equivalent to the 
reference products. In addition, the development of this new formulation with the same type of granules for 
all capsule strengths responds to an unmet medical need in paediatric patients and each dose is individually 
titrated  based  on  the  actively  monitored  individual  clinical  response.  Altogether,  Alkindi  is  considered  to  be 
approvable. The results of the planned population PK analysis of study Infacort 003 will help to further 
refine the optimal dosing regimen for this replacement therapy which is available in a dose-appropriate form 
designed for children. 
Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Alkindi is positive.

Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC 
23/06/2022 
SmPC and PL 
Based on literature review data and in alignment with 
in order to update details regarding the definition of 
severe LH and FSH deficiency, to clarify follicular 
development as the treatment target and selection of 
the most adequate Medically Assisted Reproduction 
procedure for healthcare providers and to clarify the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of 
the two gonadotropins, in alignment with the 
variation EMEA/H/C/000714/II/0075 for Pergoveris, 
based on a systematic literature search and review. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
introduce minor editorial changes to the PI.

5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated to remove LH 
threshold from the definition for severe LH and FSH 
deficiency, to add guidance to tailor treatment to individual 
patient’s response, to clarify mechanism of action and to 
update pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. 
Editorial amendments have also been performed.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder applied for an

n/a 
Annex II and 
update of the list of the local representatives in order 
PL 
to include the contact details of the Marketing 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
recommended therefore the renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Luveris. The CHMP was of the opinion that 
no additional 5-year renewal is required. 
The renewal required amendments to the terms of the 
Community Marketing Authorisation. The following annexes 
have been amended: I, II, IIIA and IIIB. Future PSURs 
submission will take place in accordance to Article 24(3) of 
Regulation EC 726/2004.

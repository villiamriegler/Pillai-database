2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The  product  Fampridine  Accord  10  mg  prolonged-release  tablets  has  been  developed  as  a  generic 
equivalent to Fampyra, 10 mg prolonged-release tablets, Biogen Netherlands B.V. which was authorised 
in the Europe on 20 July 2011.  
Fampridine  is  a  potassium  channel  blocker.  By  blocking  potassium  channels,  fampridine  reduces  the 
leakage of ionic current through these channels, thereby prolonging repolarization and thus enhancing 
action potential formation in demyelinated axons and neurological function. Presumably, by enhancing 
action potential formation, more impulses might be conducted in the central nervous system. 
The  proposed  indication  is:  Fampridine  Accord  is  indicated  for  the  improvement  of  walking  in  adult 
patients with multiple sclerosis with walking disability (EDSS 4-7).

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of active substance is 4-pyridinamine corresponding to the molecular formula C5H6N2. 
It has a relative molecular mass of 94.11 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of active substance was elucidated by a combination of infrared spectrum (FT-IR), 
ultraviolet spectrum, NMR spectrum (1H and 13C), mass spectrum, and elemental analysis.  The solid state 
properties of the active substance were measured by XRD. 
The active substance is a slightly hygroscopic white powder soluble in water, in methanol, in acetone, in 
tetrahydrofuran, in isopropanol, in acetonitrile, in N,N-dimethylformamide, in dimethylsulfoxide, and in 
alcohol.  
Dalfampridine does not contain chiral centres hence no isomers are possible. Polymorphism has not been 
observed for the active substance. Currently only one crystal form has been found and described and it is 
appropriately controlled in the active substance specifications.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturer. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The active substance is synthesized in five main stages, with four stages consisting in chemical bond 
formation or cleavage followed by a crystallization and purification stage. One well defined starting 
material is proposed with acceptable specification and complying with ICH Q11. Carry-over of impurities 
from starting material to final active substance is well evaluated. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are satisfactory. 
Potential related substances and their origin have been identified and limits for their control established in 
the active substance specification as per ICH Q3A and ICH M7. 
The contents of all the solvents used in the synthesis is included in the active substance specification. 
Class I solvents, as possible impurities in solvents, are controlled in the specification.  
Elemental analysis as per ICH Q3D was performed. No element is intentionally added in the 
manufacturing process. Results for all elements are below the 30 % of ICH limit. No further control of 
elemental impurities in the active substance is required. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/432671/2020  
Page 8/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any individual unspecified impurity in fampridine is controlled at not more than 0.10%. 
Satisfactory discussion on possible genotoxic impurities is included. Four potentially genotoxic impurities 
were identified. Three of the genotoxic impurities are routinely controlled with Threshold of toxicological 
concern (TTC) limit (75 ppm) in final active substance specification. The fourth genotoxic impurity is 
routinely controlled in Intermediate stage-IV. 
A risk assessment for nitrosamine impurities has been performed for the active substance in line with 
“Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation holders. In the starting material synthesis, no 
solvents, with a possible source of secondary or tertiary amines, and no reagents that could be. nitrite 
source, like sodium nitrite, are used.  In all the five stages of the manufacture of the active substance, no 
nitrite, secondary or tertiary amines are used. Therefore, it can be concluded that the formation of 
n-nitrosamine impurities is not likely in the active substance. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is primarily packed in transparent low-density polyethylene bag, placed in a 
polyethylene bag and outer triple laminated bag, in HDPE drum. The primary bag is tied with strip seal to 
make it airtight. The primary packaging materials comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 
10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification, includes tests for description (visual), identification (IR, HPLC, XRD), 
water (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), related substance (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), 
appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), density, particle size (Malvern mastersizer, sieve analysis), and 
microbial examination (Ph. Eur.).  
The specification parameters are set according to ICH Q6A and for impurities in accordance with ICH Q3A 
and M7 guidelines. Test parameters also include residual solvents (as discussed above), identification of 
polymorph (by XRD) and particle size. Additional parameters for density and particle size distribution (by 
sieve), which are not part of the active substance specification in the ASMF, have been introduced to 
ensure manufacturability of the active substance in the finished product by direct compression. 
The proposed limits have been tightened during the review and are acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% 
RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification, water, related substances, assay and 
microbial limit test. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/432671/2020  
Page 9/42 
 
 
 
 
indicating. All principal physical and chemical parameters were well within the limits during the 
accelerated and long-term storage conditions without showing any sign of degradation. 
Results  on  stress  conditions  (acid  degradation  (5N  HCl),  alkali  degradation  (5N  NaOH),  oxidation 
degradation  (H2O2),  thermal  degradation,  UV  and  fluorescent  light  degradation,  and  humidity 
degradation (75% RH) were also provided on one batch. Extensive degradation is observed at oxidative 
conditions.  In  all  other  degradation  conditions,  no  interference  is  observed  between  impurities  and 
fampridine, peak purity values are acceptable and mass balance is achieved. Based on observed oxidative 
degradation the proposed storage in airtight container is acceptable. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. All reported results for 
all tests were within the acceptable limits of the current specification. Therefore, the active substance 
does not need to be protected from light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months when the active 
substance is stored at 25°C, with excursions permitted to 15°C-30°C, in the proposed airtight container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished medicinal product is a prolonged release tablet. The film-coated tablets are a white to off 
white, oval shaped, biconvex, bevel-edged, approximately 13.1 x 8.1 mm in dimensions, debossed with 
“FH6” on one side and plain on other side. 
The aim of this product development was to formulate robust, physicochemical similar and stable generic 
formulation of the reference product Fampyra 10 mg prolonged-release tablets.  
The active substance is slightly hygroscopic crystalline powder with no known polymorphs. It does not 
exhibit stereoisomerism.  
As  demonstrated  by  the  pH  solubility  profile  study,  the  active  substance  is  Biopharmaceutics 
Classification System (BCS) class I, molecule have high solubility across the physiological pH range 1.2 to 
6.8. Various physical and chemical properties of the active substances are affected by their particle size 
distribution and shape and biopharmaceutical behaviour. Therefore, the particle size is controlled in the 
specifications of the active substance with two independent tests and during the manufactured of the 
finished product. 
A  pre-formulation  study  was  carried  out  with  the  same  excipients  used  in  the  core  of  the  reference 
product tablet, in the proportions expected to be used during formulation. These are common excipients 
for this type of pharmaceutical form, functioning as diluent, glidant and lubricants. A compatibility study 
of  the  active  substance  with  different  excipients  was  carried  through  binary  mixtures  of  the  active 
substance with the excipients, stored at 40°C/75% RH (open conditions) and 50°C (closed condition) in 
glass vials for 4 weeks. No interaction was observed with any of excipients during the study. 
The final composition chosen for the tablet core is qualitative the same as the reference product; the 
excipient chose for the film coating is equivalent to the one of the refence product; for a comparison 
between the test and reference product, see Table 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/432671/2020  
Page 10/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1: Composition of finished product 
All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
During  the  manufacturing  method  development,  direct  compression  with  directly  compressible  grade 
excipients was selected for manufacturing process. This decision was based on literature references, prior 
knowledge, low final active substance quantity (only 2.70% in core tablets) and poor flow properties of 
fampridine,  as  revealed  in  pre-formulation  studies.  Wet  granulation  with  water  was  excluded  due  to 
presence of hypromellose as release controlling polymer and wet granulation with an organic solvent was 
also excluded because of environmental considerations. The concentration of the functional excipients 
(i.e. release controlling polymer, lubricant) was optimised for manufacturability in developmental trials. 
The dissolution profile of the active substance was not affected by different concentration and viscosity of 
the  release  controlling  polymer,  and  different  concentration  of  lubricant.  During  development 
optimisations in blending time, lubrication time and hardness were made. No critical process parameters 
were defined during process development. Blending time before lubricant addition and time of lubrication 
are  presented  as  process  parameters  tested  in  order  to  assure  blend  uniformity  before  compression 
stage.  
The  product  dissolution  was  evaluated  across  the  physiological  pH  range  1.2  to  6.8  with  50  RPM/ 
paddle/900 ml.  Complete release was observed in 0.1 N HCl and acetate buffer pH 4.5 for the finished 
product. In phosphate buffer pH 6.8 slightly slower active substance release was observed as compared 
with  0.1  N  HCl  and  acetate  buffer  pH  4.5.  Considering  prolonged-release  formulation  design, 
pharmacokinetics  and  multimedia  dissolution  profiles  of  reference  product,  the  following  dissolution 
media and conditions were selected: pH=6.8 phosphate buffer, 900 ml, apparatus: paddle, and speed: 50 
RPM. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method was demonstrated by a change in formulation of 
the finished product, namely reducing the hypromellose content per tablet from 253 to 148 mg/tablet and 
compensating the difference with an equivalent increase of the diluent (microcrystalline cellulose) which, 
as expected, showed faster release of the active substance.  
Comparative  dissolution  profiles  between  the  batches  used  in  the  BE  study  (generic  and  reference 
medicinal  product)  in  3  different  media  (0.1N  HCl,  acetate buffer  pH  4.5,  phosphate  buffer  pH  6.8)  / 
paddle, 900 ml, 50 rpm were provided. Dissolution profile of test product BE batch with two other process 
validation batches) of test product to assess batch to batch consistency are also compared. It can be 
concluded that in-vitro dissolution profile is comparable in all the media as the similarity factor (f2) is 
more than 50. 
A comparative in-vitro alcohol-induced dose-dumping dissolution study has been carried out at 0.1 N HCl 
on  one  batch  of  the  proposed  and  the  reference  medicinal  product,  at  the  recommended  alcohol 
concentrations (0, 5, 20, 40%)  and at pH 6.8 phosphate buffer on one batch of the proposed medicinal 
product, at the recommended alcohol concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20%) to evaluate the impact and possible 
interaction  of  finished  product  in  the  presence  of  alcohol.  As  the  f2  is  more  than  50  at  all  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/432671/2020  
Page 11/42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concentrations evaluate, it can be concluded that the generic product has similar dissolution profile to that 
of reference product in dissolution media with and without alcohol, hence there is no concern of dose 
dumping in the presence of alcohol. 
A  comparative  in-vivo  bioequivalence  (BE)  study  have  been  performed  between  the  proposed  and 
reference medicinal product. 
The primary packaging is aluminium -aluminium perforated unit- dose blister. The material complies with 
Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 5 main steps: sifting of raw materials, direct blending, lubrication, 
compression and final film-coating.  
Blend homogeneity is critical for the quality of finished product due to low active substance content and 
is  routinely  tested  as  in-process  control.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this  type  of 
manufacturing process. 
Holding times of 30 days for granules (blend mixture) and core tablets and of 3 months for bulk film 
coated tablets  are  acceptable  as  supported  by  data.  It  is  confirmed that  the  shelf-life  is  calculated  in 
accordance  with  Note  for  Guidance  on  Start  of  Shelf-Life  of  the  Finished  Dosage  Form 
(CPMP/QWP/072/96). 
The  manufacturing  process  is  non-standard  as  the  modified  release  preparation  is  considered  a 
specialized  pharmaceutical  dosage  form,  according  to  the  Annex  II  to  note  for  guidance  on  process 
validation.  Process  validation  has  been  carried  out  on  three  commercial  size  batches  manufactured 
according  to  the  commercial  composition.  All  the  validation  parameters  were  within  the  defined 
acceptance criteria and found satisfactory. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description (visual), average weight of tablet, identification (HPLC, UV, titanium dioxide),  water (KF), 
dissolution (UV), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), and 
microbial examination (Ph. Eur.).  
Impurity  profile  of  3  batches  of  the  proposed  medicinal  product  manufactured  by  finished  product 
manufacturer  as  per  the  final  formula  was  compared  with  the  impurity  profile  of  reference  medicinal 
product. The impurity profile was similar to the one of the reference product and no additional impurities 
have been observed.  
The limits for impurities and water content have been tightened during the procedure and the limits for 
dissolution testing have also been revised to be within the ±10% of value of batch used in BE study at 
each time point. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities, using the component assessment 
approach (option 2b). The obtained measured concentration results show that the content of elemental 
impurities in the final product from all the potential sources (e.g. active substance, excipients, container 
closure system, manufacturing equipment) is below 30% of PDE (permitted daily exposure in line with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/432671/2020  
Page 12/42 
 
 
 
ICH  Q3D).  Based  on  the  risk  assessment  it  can  be  concluded  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  include  any 
elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Risk evaluation for the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been carried out and 
no risk has been identified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has 
been presented. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  3  commercial  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  water,  dissolution,  related  substances,  assay,  and  microbial 
examination. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The tests performed during stability 
study  under  the  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions  are  complying  with  the  specifications  and  well 
within the acceptance criteria. 
Bulk  stability  studies  were  performed  in  one  batch  stored  into  PPCP  container  pack  under  long  term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for 12 months. The tests performed are complying with the specifications 
and well within the acceptance criteria. Based on satisfactory stability data on PPCP container, 12 months 
storage period is assigned for PPCP container. Tablets are to be repacked in to blisters within 12 months 
from the date of bulk packing into PPCP containers. The proposed storage condition is “Store below 25°C”. 
Results on forced degradation conditions (acid hydrolysis (5M methanolic HCl at 80°C for 72 hours), alkali 
hydrolysis (5M NaOH at 80°C for 72 hours), peroxide oxidation (H2O2 at room temperature for 72 hours), 
water hydrolysis stress study (at 80°C for 72 hours), thermal stress study (105°C for 72 hours), and UV 
stress study (for 72 hours) have been provided. Forced degradation study is carried out to identify the 
likely degradation products and to validate the stability indicating power of the analytical procedures by 
using forced degradation samples. Based on results, it is concluded that method for the determination of 
related substances of the finished product is stability indicating in nature. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results of conducted photo stability study reveal that the finished 
product is photo stable. 
Thermal cycling study has been carried out to study the effect of transportation on stability of the finished 
product. The product was subjected to three cycles of two days at low temperature (-20 ±5 °C) followed 
by high temperature 50 ± 2°C / 75 ± 5% RH. Results are found well within acceptance criteria. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and without storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, PK and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects 
of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed 
and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) studies were submitted. This was justified by the Applicant as 
the introduction of Fampridine Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all fampridine containing products and 
the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Upon request, the Applicant submitted a new updated non-clinical overview with more recent publications 
on pharmacology, PK and toxicology of fampridine in animal species and a critical evaluation of available 
information in the light of patient’s safety. The CHMP is of the opinion that the Applicant has justified the 
absence of non-clinical studies based on the literature review and the claim that Fampridine Accord is a 
generic  of  the  reference  product  Fampyra.  The  literature  data  presented  in  the  dossier  is  considered 
acceptable and sufficient for the assessment of non-clinical aspects of Fampridine Accord in the applied 
indication. 
Upon  request  and  in  line  with  the  Questions  and  answers  on  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  the  Applicant  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/432671/2020

requested to further justify the absence of possible significant increase of environmental exposure to the 
drug  substances,  providing  concrete  relevant  data  such  the  consumed  quantities  of  Fampridine  in 
kg/year. The justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the non-clinical aspects adequate to support this application. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for a prolonged-release tablet, containing Fampridine. 
For this generic application, the Applicant has submitted three bioequivalence studies on 10 mg strength:  
one single dose study under fasting and one single dose study under fed conditions as well as one multiple 
dose study under fasted conditions in accordance with the Guideline on the pharmacokinetic and clinical 
evaluation  of  modified  release  dosage  forms  (EMA/CPMP/EWP/280/96  Corr1)  and  Guideline  on  the 
Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98)  as  well  as  the  Guideline  on  Bioanalytical 
method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09).  
This approach is considered acceptable since fampridine is formulated in a prolonged release unit tablet 
formulation  and  the  application  concerns  a  product  that  should  be  taken  without  regard  to  food  and 
according to the ‘Guideline on the pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of prolonged release dosage 
forms’  at  least  a  single  dose  in  fasting  and  fed  conditions  as  well  as  a  multiple  dose  study  in  fasting 
conditions is required in case of drug significant accumulation. 
In addition, according to the ‘Guideline on the pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of modified release 
dosage forms’ (EMA/CHMP/EWP/280/96 Rev1) for oral formulations, in vitro studies to investigate the 
release  in  alcoholic  solutions  to  confirm  that  there  is  no  higher  risk  of  dose-dumping  is  case  of 
concomitant intake with alcohol has been performed. Please refer to section 2.2 Quality aspects. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) as claimed by the 
Applicant. 
The Applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Clinical studies 
To  support  the  application,  the  Applicant  has  submitted  three  bioequivalence  studies  in  which  the  PK 
profile of the test product Fampridine Accord 10 mg prolonged-release tablets is compared with the PK 
profile of the reference product Fampyra 10 mg prolonged-release tablets (Biogen Idec Limited, UK):

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Methods 
Study design  
Study No. 487-14 - Single-dose fasting study 
Study  487-14  was  an  open  label,  balanced,  randomized,  two-treatment,  two-period,  two-sequence, 
single,  oral  dose,  crossover,  bioequivalence  study  of  two  products  of  Fampridine  prolonged-release 
tablets 10 mg in normal, healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting conditions, with a screening period 
of 28 days prior to the dosing in Period-I and with a washout period of 5 days between the successive 
dosing days.  
The duration of the clinical part of the study was about 8 days (11 hours prior to the dose administration 
in Period-I until the last PK sample in Period-II). 
The subjects received one tablet of either test or reference products randomly with 240 mL of ambient 
temperature on the day of dosing as per the randomization schedule in each period of the study. Finished 
product was administered after at least 10.00 hours overnight fasting.  
The study design employed (as a randomized fasting single dose cross-over design) is appropriate for the 
bioequivalence study according to the requirements stated in the Guideline on the pharmacokinetic and 
clinical  evaluation  of  modified  release  dosage  forms  (EMA/CPMP/EWP/280/96  Corr1).  The  absorption, 
distribution and elimination phases are all well characterized. The washout period of 5 days is considered 
adequate as Fampridine has an elimination half-life of 6 hours (about 4 hours in the actual study) and no 
pre-dose levels were detected.  
The plasma concentrations of fampridine were determined in an analytical laboratory at the following 
times: 0.000 hour (pre-dose) and at 0.500, 1.000, 1.250, 1.500, 1.750, 2.000, 2.250, 2.500, 2.750,

3.000, 3.333, 3.667, 4.000, 4.333, 4.667, 5.000, 6.000, 8.000, 10.000, 12.000, 16.000, 20.000, 24.000 
and 36.000 hours following drug administration. Considering the expected time to peak concentration (3 
hours)  and  the  elimination  half-life,  the  sampling  schedule  and  the  sampling  time  period of  36  hours 
seems long enough to estimate PK parameters. 
Study No. 488-14 - Single-dose fed study 
Study  488-14  was  an  open  label,  balanced,  randomized,  two-treatment,  two-period,  two-sequence, 
single oral dose, crossover, bioequivalence study of two products of Fampridine prolonged-release tablets 
10 mg in healthy, adult, human subjects under fed condition, with a screening period of 28 days prior to 
the dosing in Period-I and with a washout period of 7 days between the successive dosing days.  
The duration of the clinical part of the study was about 10 days (11 hours prior to the dose administration 
in Period-I until the last PK sample in Period-II). 
The study design employed (as a randomized fasting single dose cross-over design) is appropriate for the 
bioequivalence study according to the requirements stated in the Guideline on the pharmacokinetic and 
clinical  evaluation  of  modified  release  dosage  forms  (EMA/CPMP/EWP/280/96  Corr1).  The  absorption, 
distribution and elimination phases are all well characterized. The washout period of 7 days is considered 
adequate as fampridine has an elimination half-life of 6 hours (about 4 hours in the actual study) and no 
pre-dose levels were detected. 
After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, the subjects were served high fat high calorie vegetarian 
breakfast, which they consumed within 30 minutes. The composition of the meal has been described with 
regard to protein, carbohydrate and fat content and is in according to the Guideline on the investigation 
of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98). 
A single oral dose (10 mg) of either the test product or the reference product was administered to the 
subjects at 30 minutes after serving the breakfast with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature. 
The investigational medicinal product administration was as per the randomization schedule and under 
open-label conditions.  
The plasma concentrations of fampridine were determined in an analytical laboratory at the following 
times: 0.000 hour (pre-dose) and at 0.500, 1.000, 1.500, 2.000, 2.333, 2.667, 3.000, 3.250, 3.500, 
3.750, 4.000, 4.250, 4.500, 4.750, 5.000, 5.333, 5.667, 6.000, 6.500, 7.000, 8.000, 10.000, 12.000, 
16.000, 20.000, 24.000 and 36.000 hours following drug administration in each period.  
Considering the expected time to peak concentration (about 5 hours) and the elimination half-life, the 
sampling  schedule  and  the  sampling  time  period  of  36  hours  seems  long  enough  to  estimate  PK 
parameters.  
Study No. 489-14 - Multiple-dose fasting study 
Study  489-14  was  an  open  label,  balanced,  randomized,  two-treatment,  two-period,  two-sequence, 
multiple  oral  dose,  fully  replicate,  crossover,  bioequivalence  study  in  healthy,  adult,  human  subjects 
under  fasting  conditions,  with  a  screening  period  of  28  days  prior  to  the  first  dose  administration  in 
Period-I. All the subjects were administered the study drug in each period in each group. The order of 
receiving Test Product-T and Reference Product-R for each subject on day 05 and day 06 of both the 
periods of the study was determined according to a randomization schedule. A washout period of 9 days 
was maintained between the last dose of Period-I and the first dose of Period-II.  
The duration of the clinical part of the study was about 56 days (11 hours before administration of the 
morning dose on Day 01 in Period-I of group-I until the 12 hours after the morning dose administration on 
Day 06 in Period-II of group-IV). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/432671/2020

After an overnight fast of at least 08 hours for morning dose (Day 01 to Day 06) and after fast of at least 
02  hours  for  evening  dose  (Day  01  to  Day  05),  a  single  oral  dose  (10  mg)  of  either  the  test  or  the 
reference product was administered with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient temperature as per the 
randomization schedule and under open-label conditions.  
Single dose of the test or the reference product was administered orally to each subject twice daily from 
Day 01 to Day 05 at morning & evening and only once in the morning on Day 06 in each period. 
The blood samples were collected prior to morning dose on each day (Day 01, 03, 04, 05 and 06) and prior 
to evening dose on Day 03 and 04 and on Day 05 and 06 at 0.333, 0.667, 1.000, 1.333, 1.667, 2.000, 
2.333,  2.667,  3.000,  3.333,  3.667,  4.000,  4.500,  5.000,  6.000,  8.000,  10.000  and  12.000  hours 
post-dose administration in each period. 
In line with the guideline on the pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation of modified release dosage forms 
(EMA/CPMP/EWP/280/96  Corr1),  multiple-dose  study  is  recommended  for  the  prolonged  release 
formulation when a drug has a tendency to accumulate after multiple dosing at the recommended dosing 
interval. The study has been performed under fasted conditions as per EMA guideline recommendation for 
a steady-state study if the SmPC states that the product should be taken in fasted state. The proposed 
fasting  periods  of  8  h  before  morning  administration  and  2  h  before  the  evening  administration  are 
acceptable. 
The study design employed (as a full replicate cross-over design with two consecutive administration of 
the same product after reaching steady-state) is adequate in relation to characterization of the PK of 
Fampridine after oral administration. Achievement of steady state is assessed by comparing at least 3 
pre-dose morning concentrations for each formulation. 
The washout period of 9 days is considered adequate as fampridine has an elimination half-life of 6 hours 
and no pre-dose levels before the first dose on period II were detected. Samples were collected for a 
dosing interval of 12 hours after the last dose, which is considered sufficient.

Out of the dosed 56 subjects, 55 subjects completed the clinical phase of the study successfully. There 
was one post-dose withdrawal during the conduct of the study, on medical grounds in Period-II. Upon 
request,  the  Applicant  presented  the  CRF  to  justify  the  withdrawal  of  this  subject.  The  reason  of  the 
withdrawal is acceptable. Plasma samples of all 56 subjects were analysed. In which, withdrawn subject 
was also analysed as per protocol requirement. There were no missing samples during the conduct of the 
study. 
Total 55  subjects were included in the PK  and  statistical  analysis. The safety assessment includes 
information for all 56 subjects who were dosed at least once during this study. 
Protocol deviations were associated mainly with scheduled blood sampling and concomitant medications. 
The blood sampling time deviations did not affect the PK analysis, which were based on actual sampling 
time points. 
Four subjects took concomitant medication (ibuprofen, paracetamol and pheniramine maleate) to treat 
their adverse events (AEs). These drugs do not present interactions with the medication of the study. In 
addition, potentially interfering drugs have been investigated in the validation of the bioanalytical method 
including  ibuprofen,  paracetamol  and  pheniramine  maleate  without  effect  on  the  determination  of 
fampridine.

Figure 4: Flow-chart Study No. 489-14 
The  study  was  conducted  on  Asian  population.  As  per  the  protocol  the  60  subjects  (male)  who 
participated in this study were non-smokers, healthy adult human volunteers between 18 to 45 years of 
age (both inclusive), having BMI between 18.5 to 30 kg / m2 (both inclusive), with normal clinical and 
laboratory  results.  The  population  chosen  is  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of 
Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1).  Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  acceptable  and 
performed according to the protocol requirements. All the subjects were dosed as per the randomization.  
Subjects were dosed in four groups. 
Group-I 
Dosed in Period-I: 05 April 2016 – 11 April 2016 
Dosed in Period-II: 19 April 2016 – 25 April 2016 
A total of 18 subjects were checked in for Period-I of the study.

On the day of check-in for Period-I, prior to check-in, one subject informed the study personnel that he 
did not want to continue his further participation in the study due to his personal reason. Hence, the 
subject discontinued from the study on his own accord. He was replaced with next available volunteer. 
Both  the  extra  subjects  were  checked  out  of  the  facility  as  no  more  subjects  discontinued  /  were 
withdrawn from the study prior to first dosing in Period-I. Hence, a total of 16 subjects were dosed in 
Period-I of the study and all the dosed subjects completed the clinical phase of the study successfully. 
Group-II 
Dosed in Period-I: 12 April 2016 – 18 April 2016 
Dosed in Period-II: 26 April 2016 to 02 May 2016 
A total of 18 subjects were checked in for Period-I of the study. 
On the day of check-in for Period-I, prior to check-in, one subject informed the study personnel that he 
did not want to continue his further participation in the study due to his personal reason. Hence, the

A total of 18 subjects were checked in for Period-I of the study. Two subjects were checked in for the 
study, in order to compensate for any dropouts prior to first dosing in Period-I. Both the extra subjects 
were checked out of the facility as none of the subjects discontinued / were withdrawn from the study 
prior to first dosing in Period-I. Hence, a total of 16 subjects were dosed in Period-I of the study and all 
the dosed subjects completed the clinical phase of the study successfully. 
Group-IV 
Dosed in Period-I: 11 May 2016 – 16 May 2016 
Dosed in Period-II: 25 May 2016 to 30 May 2016 
A total of 14 subjects were checked in for Period-I of the study. Two subjects were checked in for the 
study, in order to compensate for any dropouts prior to dosing in Period-I. Both the extra subjects were 
checked out of the facility as none of the subjects discontinued / were withdrawn from the study prior to 
first dosing in Period-I. Hence, a total of 12 subjects were dosed in Period-I of the study and all the dosed 
subjects completed the clinical phase of the study successfully. 
In all the four groups, all the dosed 60 subjects completed the clinical phase of the study successfully. 
Plasma samples of all the 60 subjects were analysed. Total 60  subjects were included in the PK  and 
statistical analysis. 
Protocol deviations are listed and discussed, and none is considered by the investigator to have impact on 
the overall study outcome. 
The blood sampling time deviations did not affect the PK analysis, which were based on actual sampling 
time points. 
Two subjects took concomitant medication (ibuprofen and paracetamol) during the study to treat their 
AEs. These drugs do not present interactions with the medication of the study. In addition, potentially

interfering drugs have been investigated in the validation of the bioanalytical method including ibuprofen 
and paracetamol without effect on the determination of fampridine.  
One  subject  took  concomitant  medication  (Cefadroxyl)  post-study  since  he  had  abnormal  laboratory 
value (increase in white blood cell count). 
Analytical methods 
Study No. 487-14 - Single-dose fasting study 
Pre-study and in-study validations were performed according to the requirements of the EMA Guideline on 
bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09). Statement on Good Laboratory Practices 
(GLP) compliance is provided. 
Pre-study validation (method validation (MV) (I)-137-15, dated August 5, 2015) 
The analytical method for the determination of Fampridine in K2EDTA (Di Potassium Ethylene Diamine 
Tetraacetic  Acid)  human  plasma  over  the  calibration  range  of  0.202  to  40.251  pg/mL  pg/mL  was 
developed and validated at the Lambda Therapeutic Research Ltd., Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. 
Dalfampridine and Fampridine-d4 (ISTD) were extracted from plasma by liquid-liquid extraction method 
using extraction solvent. The plasma layer was flash-frozen, and the organic layer was transferred into 
pre-labelled tubes. The contents were then evaporated to dryness at about 40ºC (±2°C) temperature 
under  nitrogen  gas  stream  and  reconstituted  with  mobile  phase.  The  contents  were  then  finally 
transferred into appropriate auto sampler vials for analysis. 
The pre-study validation of the analytical method is satisfactory. The method met the acceptance criteria 
for all the validation parameters evaluated, demonstrating acceptable performance. 
The long-term stability data of fampridine stored human plasma at -65°C ± 10°C was demonstrated for 
51 days and for 369 days, respectively in K2EDTA human plasma and it covers the 42 days maximum 
storage samples at -65°C ± 10°C.  
The possible interference from co-administration of Cetirizine, Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Ranitidine, Diclofenac, 
Domperidone, Caffeine, Paracetamol and Nicotine was evaluated at the stage of bioanalytical method 
validation. The co-administered drugs did not show any significant interference at the retention time and 
transition of Fampridine and Fampridine-d4 (ISTD). It can be concluded that the quantification method is 
selective for the analysis of Fampridine in presence of above mentioned co administered drugs.  
For  the  carry  over  investigation,  representative  chromatograms  of  extracted  high  sample,  extracted 
blank  plasma  and  extracted  low  sample  are  shown.  In  response  to  D120  list  of  questions  (LoQ),  the 
Applicant  has  provided  results  showing  that  the  carry  over  in  the  blank  samples  following  the  high 
concentration standard is greater than 20% of the Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) sample and 5% 
of the internal standard sample.  
In response to the Rapporteur’s request, the Applicant has investigated the extent of any interference 
caused  by  metabolites  (3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine  and  3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine  sulphate)  of  the 
drug as well as evaluated the possibility of back-conversion of a metabolite (3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine 
and 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine sulphate) into parent analyte by incurred sample reanalysis data.   
In response to D120 LoQ regarding missing the Method validation plan for Main validation, Addendum I 
and Addendum II, the Applicant`s argumentation that there is no any need for a separate validation plan 
as the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) method and the SOP method validation are already in place 
(Addendum I and Addendum II) and give a detailed insight regarding procedure to be followed at the time 
of conduct of Method validation, is considered acceptable.

Pharmacokinetic variables 
Study No. 487-14 - Single-dose fasting study  
The  PK  parameters  for  Fampridine  were  calculated  from  the  plasma  concentration  vs.  time  profile  by 
non-compartmental  model  using  WinNonlin  Professional  Software  Version  5.3  (Pharsight  Corporation, 
USA).  
Primary PK parameters were Cmax (Maximum measured plasma concentration), AUC0-t (Area under the 
plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the last measurable plasma concentration) and 
AUC0-∞ (Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity)  
Secondary  PK  parameters  were  Tmax (time  of  the  maximum  measured  plasma  concentration),  λz (first 
order rate constant associated with the terminal log-linear portion of the curve), Tlag (time prior to the first 
measurable (non-zero) concentration), t1/2 (terminal half-life) and AUC_% Extrap_obs (residual area in 
percentage). 
PK software and method for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ estimation are considered acceptable.  
Actual time of blood collection was considered for PK calculations. 
The selected primary PK variables are appropriate for a single dose bioequivalence study. 
Study No.488-14 - Single-dose fed study 
Same as above.  
Study No. 489-14 - Multiple-dose fasting study 
The  PK  parameters  for  Fampridine  were  calculated  from  the  plasma  concentration  vs.  time  profile  by 
non-compartmental model using Phoenix® WinNonlin® Version 6.4 (Certara L.P.) for Fampridine.  
Actual time points of the sample collection are used for the calculation of PK parameters. 
Day 01, 03, 04, and 05 in each period: 
Primary PK parameters: Cpd (minimum observed concentration prior to dosing) 
Day 05 (After morning dose of day 05) and Day 06 (After morning dose of day 06) in each period: 
Primary  PK  parameters:  Cmax,ss    (maximum  measured  plasma  concentration  at  steady  state)  Cτ,ss 
(Concentration at the end of the dosing interval at steady state), AUCτ,ss (Area under the concentration 
versus time curve during a dosing interval at steady state computed by trapezoidal rule. (Dosing interval, 
τ = 12 hour)). 
Secondary PK parameters: Tmax,ss (time of the maximum measured plasma concentration at steady state), 
%Fluctuation (percentage fluctuation during steady state) and Cav,ss (average plasma concentration at 
steady state) 
PK software and method for (Cmax,ss, Cτ,ss and AUCτ,ss) estimation are considered acceptable.  
The  selected  primary  PK  (Cmax,ss,  Cτ,ss  and  AUCτ,ss)  variables  are  appropriate  for  a  multiple  dose 
bioequivalence  study  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the  pharmacokinetic  and  clinical  evaluation  of 
modified release dosage forms.

Table 5: ANOVA (p-values)  
Note: p-value is statistically significant if it is < 0.05. 
Based on the statistical analysis submitted by the Applicant the test product is equivalent to the reference 
with respect to the extent and rate of absorption/exposure as the 90% CI for the ln-transformed Cmax, 
AUC0-∞ and AUC0-t are within the acceptance range of 90.00 – 111.11%. 
Tmax was not observed in any of the subjects in the first sample time point. No pre-dose concentration has 
been detected. 
The LLOQ of 0.202 pg /mL was sensitive enough to detect levels of 5% of the minimum Cmax (0.859 pg 
/mL is 5% of the minimum Cmax =17.188 pg /mL) to exclude the possibility of a relevant carry-over effect.  
A  significant  subject  (sequence)  effect  has  been  detected  for  AUC0-t,  AUC0-∞  and  Cmax.  The  Applicant 
addressed  this  issue  and  concluded  that  a  subject  (sequence)  effect  is  frequently  caused  by 
inter-individual variations. This explanation is endorsed. 
A significant sequence effect has been detected for AUC0-∞ and Cmax. The Applicant addressed this issue 
and concluded that this sequence effect is just statistically significant and can be ignored as the study was 
a single dose study conducted in healthy volunteers, not comparing an endogenous substance, had an 
adequate  washout  and  used  appropriate  design  and  analysis  and  meets  bioequivalence  criteria 
successfully. This explanation is endorsed. 
In  addition,  a  significant  period  effect  has  been  detected  for  Cmax,  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-∞.  The  Applicant 
addressed this issue and concluded that this period effect is just statistically significant and can be ignored 
as clinical conditions were kept identical in both the period of the study, and there were no pre-dose 
concentrations observed, and the decision of equivalence is based on the 90% CI by Schuirmann two 
one-sided test (TOST) approach which is within the acceptance criteria i.e. 90.00% to 111.11%. This 
explanation is endorsed. 
The extrapolated AUC is not higher than 20% for any single subject. 
No subject received concomitant medication during this study. One subject received medication after he 
withdrawn from the study.

The Cmax at fed conditions was higher compared to the fasting conditions which is in good agreement with 
the reported changes for Cmax in the literature. 
Tmax was not observed in any of the subjects in the first sample time point. No pre-dose concentration has 
been detected. 
The LLOQ of 0.202 pg /mL was sensitive enough to detect levels of 5% of the minimum Cmax (1.043 pg 
/mL is 5% of the minimum Cmax =20.864 pg /mL) to exclude the possibility of a relevant carry-over effect.  
A  significant  subject  (sequence)  effect  has  been  detected  for  Cmax,  AUC0-t  and  AUC0-∞.  The  Applicant 
addressed  this  issue  and  concluded  that  a  subject  (sequence)  effect  is  frequently  caused  by 
inter-individual variations. This explanation is endorsed. 
A significant period effect has been detected for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞. The Applicant addressed this 
issue and concluded that this period effect is just statistically significant and can be ignored as clinical 
conditions were kept identical in both the period of the study, and there were no pre-dose concentrations 
observed, and the decision of equivalence is based on the 90% CI  by Schuirmann TOST approach which 
is within the acceptance criteria i.e. 90.00% to 111.11%. This explanation is endorsed. 
The extrapolated AUC is not higher than 20% for any single subject. 
Study No. 489-14 - Multiple-dose fasting study

Note: p-value is statistically significant if it is < 0.05. 
The Applicant tested the achievement of steady state by measuring morning and evening Cpd over days 3, 
4 and 5 and subsequent performing RMANOVA tests including the terms DAY and DAY*Formulation.  
The effect of DAY was significant for the morning doses (p-value: 0.0024) and not for the evening doses 
(p-value: 0.2315). The Applicant assumed the achievement of steady state based on the effect of the 
interaction DAY*Formulation, which was neither significant for morning doses (p-value: 0.7629) nor for 
evening doses (p-value: 0.1689). In response to D120 LoQ, the Applicant has adequately justified the 
inclusion of Formulation as a fixed effect instead of performing separate ANOVA tests for each product as 
well as the use of the interaction term DAY*Formulation for the assumption that the steady state was 
achieved.  
Based  on  the  statistical  analysis  submitted  by  the  Applicant,  the  test  product  is  equivalent  to  the 
reference  with  respect  to  the  extent  and  rate  of  absorption/exposure  as  the  90%  CI  for  the 
ln-transformed Cmax,ss, Cτ,ss and AUCτ,ss were within the acceptance range of 90.00-111.00%.

The LLOQ of 0.202 pg /mL was sensitive enough to detect levels of 5% of the minimum Cmax (1.1274 pg 
/mL is 5% of the minimum Cmax=22.549 pg /mL) to exclude the possibility of a relevant carry-over effect.  
A significant sequence effect (i.e. p-value < 0.05) has been detected for Cmax,ss, Cτ,ss and AUCτ,ss. The 
Applicant addressed this issue and concluded that this sequence effect is just statistically significant and 
can be ignored as the study was a multiple dose study conducted in healthy volunteers, not comparing an 
endogenous substance, had an adequate washout and used appropriate design and analysis and meets 
bioequivalence criteria successfully. This explanation is endorsed. 
Group, Sequence, Sequence*Group, Subject (Sequence*Group), Period (Group) effects were found to be 
statistically significant (i.e. p-value < 0.05) for ln-transformed PK parameters Cmax,ss, Cτ,ss and AUCτ,ss for 
Fampridine.  The  Applicant  addressed  this  issue  and  concluded  that  these  significant  effects  can  be 
ignored considering the analysis approach adopted for fully replicate study design. This explanation is 
endorsed. 
In response to D120 LoQ, the Applicant submitted results of the exploratory analysis with the requested 
factors:  Group, 
Sequence,

p-value: 0.5814) and AUCτ,ss (i.e. p-value: 0.8994) for Fampridine.    
All other ANOVA effects were found to be not statistically significant (i.e. p-value >0.05) ln-transformed 
PK parameters Cmax,ss, Cτ,ss and AUCτ,ss for Fampridine. 
There  were  one  missing  sample  of  reference  product  on  Day-6  (reported  as  non-reportable)  for  one 
subject  during  the  conduct  of  the  study.  This  subject  was  not  excluded  from  the  PK  and  statistical 
analysis, which is in accordance with the protocol and thus acceptable.  
Safety data 
Study No. 487-14 - Single-dose fasting study 
During the study 1 AE was reported in Period-II of the study after administration of Test Product. One 
subject  had  complaint  of  loose  stools  (2  to  3  episodes).  The  AE  was  sudden  at  onset,  intermittent  in 
occurrence and mild in severity. The relationship to the study drug was judged by the investigator as 
unlikely for the AE. The subject was withdrawn from the study on medical grounds. His AE was resolved. 
There were no serious (SAE) or significant AEs during the conduct of the study. Data from this study 
demonstrated that the test and the reference products were well tolerated by healthy subjects, as a single 
dose administration. 
Study No. 488-14 - Single-dose fed study 
During the study 8 AEs were reported by 7 subjects. 2 AEs were reported in Period-I, 3 AEs were reported 
in Period-II and 3 AEs were reported during post-study safety assessment. Two subjects in the test group 
reported a total of 2 AEs and 5 subjects in the reference group reported a total of 6 AEs. All the AEs were 
classified as mild in nature. All of the AE resolved with medications. The causality assessment was judged 
as possible for 4 AEs and as unlikely for 4 AEs. 
Out of the total reported eight 8 AEs, one AE was significant. One subject was withdrawn from the study 
on medical grounds due to upper respiratory tract infection. The subject was treated appropriately and 
was followed up until resolution. The causality assessment was judged as possible for the AE. 
The  post-study  safety  assessments  included  haematology  and  biochemistry  (except  random  glucose, 
sodium, potassium and chloride). The laboratory reports were reviewed by a clinician and were found to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/432671/2020  
Page 36/42 
 
 
 
be clinically acceptable (including all the out of reference range reports) for all the subjects except for 2 
subjects. Clinically significant abnormalities were observed for one subject (increase in white blood cell 
count) and for the second subject (increase in white blood cell and eosinophil count). Both subjects were 
followed up until resolution of their AEs. 
There were no serious AEs during the conduct of the study. Data from this study demonstrated that the 
test and the reference products were well tolerated by healthy subjects, as a single dose administration. 
Although the safety profile of both products was not comparable, no difference in the safety profile can be 
anticipated. 
Study No. 489-14 - Multiple-dose fasting study 
During the study 6 AE) were reported by 5 subjects. 3 AEs were reported in Period-I, 2 AEs were reported 
in Period-II and 1 AE was reported during post-study safety assessment of the study. 
2 AEs were reported in two subjects after administration of Reference Product and 4 AEs were reported in 
three subjects after administration of Test Product. 
All the AEs were mild in nature. The subjects were followed up until resolution of their AEs. 
The causality assessment was judged as possible for 2 AEs and as unlikely for 4 AEs. 
There were no clinically significant findings in the vital signs assessment, electrocardiogram recordings or 
the  laboratory  tests  in  any  of  the  subjects  in  the  study  except  for  one  subject,  who  had  abnormal 
laboratory  value  (increase  in  white  blood  cell  count)  during  post-study  safety  assessment.  AE  was 
recorded and the subject was followed up until AE resolution. 
There were no SAE or significant AEs during the conduct of the study. Data from this study demonstrated 
that  the  test  and  the  reference  products  were  well  tolerated  by  healthy  subjects,  as  a  multiple  dose 
administration. Although the safety profiles of both products were not comparable, no difference in the 
safety profile can be anticipated. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Essential similarity is claimed to Fampyra 10 mg prolonged-release tablets, Biogen Netherlands B.V., The 
Netherlands, approved via centralised procedure on 20-07-2011 (EMEA/H/C/002097).  
Fampridine is a well-known active substance with established efficacy and tolerability. A clinical overview 
has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies 
why there is no need to generate additional clinical data.  
To support this application, the Applicant submitted three bioequivalence studies performed in 2015 and 
2016.  The  Applicant  conducted  bioequivalence  studies  in  which  the  PK  profile  of  the  test  product 
Fampridine  Accord  10  mg  prolonged-release  tablets  is  compared  with  the  PK  profile  of  the  reference 
product  Fampyra  10  mg  prolonged-release  tablets  (Biogen  Netherlands  B.V.).  One  single  dose  study 
under fasted conditions, one single dose study under fed conditions and one multiple dose study under 
Assessment report

fasted conditions were conducted. The choice of the reference product in the bioequivalence study has 
been justified. The analytical method has been adequately validated. All other concerns identified in the 
bioanalytical and validation reports were resolved. 
According to the Applicant, competent authorities/EU inspectors have inspected the study site Lambda 
Therapeutic Research Ltd. In response to D120 LoQ, the Applicant has submitted inspection outcome of 
BfArM performed in 2014. In response to D120 LoQ, the Applicant has submitted monitoring of the clinical 
phase for all studies.  
The  first  study  (487-14)  was  an  open  label,  balanced,  randomized,  two-treatment,  two-period, 
two-sequence,  single,  oral  dose,  cross-over  bioequivalence  study  of  two  products  of  Fampridine 
prolonged-release tablets 10 mg carried out under fasted conditions in 56 healthy male subjects, with a 
screening period of 28 days prior to the dosing in period-I and with a washout period of 5 days between 
the  successive  dosing  days.    The  design  of  the  bioequivalence  study  is  adequate  in  relation  to 
characterization  of  the  PK  of  Fampridine  after  oral  administration.  The  absorption,  distribution  and 
elimination phases are all well characterized. The washout period of 5 days is considered adequate as 
Fampridine has an elimination half-life of 6 hours (about 4 hours in the actual study) and no pre-dose 
levels were detected. Out of the dosed 56 subjects, 55 subjects completed the clinical phase of the study 
successfully and were included in the PK and statistical analysis. One subject was withdrawn from the 
study on medical grounds in Period-II. Upon request, the Applicant justify the withdrawal and explanation 
is considered acceptable.  
The statistics and PK variables are adequately described. The results of the study conclude bioequivalence 
with the chosen reference product with respect to the extent and rate of absorption/exposure as the 90% 
CI for the ln-transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were within the acceptance range of 90.00-111.11% as 
corresponds for a drug with NTI  
The  second  study  (488-14)  was  an  open  label,  balanced,  randomized,  two-treatment,  two-period, 
two-sequence,  single,  oral  dose,  cross-over  bioequivalence  study  of  two  products  of  Fampridine 
prolonged-release tablets 10 mg carried out under fed conditions in 56 healthy male subjects, with a 
screening period of 28 days prior to the dosing in period-I. After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours and 
within 30 minutes after serving a high-fat, high calorie breakfast the subjects were administered a single 
10 mg dose of the study medication with 240 ml of drinking water. The total caloric content was 937.66 
kcal.  There  were  2  dosing  periods,  separated  by  a  washout  period  of  7  days.  The  design  of  the 
bioequivalence  study  is  adequate  in  relation  to  characterization  of  the  PK  of  Fampridine  after  oral 
administration.  The  absorption,  distribution  and  elimination  phases  are  all  well  characterized.  The 
washout period of 7 days is considered adequate as Fampridine has an elimination half-life of 6 hours and 
no pre-dose levels were detected. Out of the dosed 56 subjects, 55 subjects completed the clinical phase 
of the study successfully and were included in the PK and statistical analysis. One subject was withdrawn 
from the study on medical grounds in period-II. Upon request, the Applicant justify the withdrawal and 
explanation is considered acceptable. 
The statistics and PK variables are adequately described. The results of the study conclude bioequivalence 
with the chosen reference product with respect to the extent and rate of absorption/exposure as the 90% 
CI for the ln-transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were within the acceptance range of 90.00-111.11%. 
The  third  study  (489-14)  was  an  open  label,  balanced,  randomized,  two-treatment,  two-period, 
two-sequence,  multiple  oral  dose,  fully  replicate,  crossover,  bioequivalence  study  of  two  products  of 
Fampridine  prolonged-release  tablets  10  mg  carried  out  under  fasted  conditions  in  60  healthy  male 
subjects, with a screening period of 28 days prior to the dosing in period-I. Subjects were dosed in four 
groups. The order of receiving Test Product-T and Reference Product-R for each subject on day 05 and 
day 06 of both the periods of the study was determined according to a randomization schedule.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/432671/2020  
Page 38/42 
 
 
 
The  full  replicate  design  with  two  consecutive  administration  of  the  same  product  after  reaching 
steady-state is adequate in relation to characterization of the PK of Fampridine after oral administration. 
The washout period of 9 days is considered adequate as Fampridine has an elimination half-life of 6 hours 
and no pre-dose levels were detected. In all the four groups, all the dosed 60 subjects completed the 
clinical phase of the study successfully and were included in the PK and statistical analysis. 
The Applicant tested the achievement of steady state by measuring morning and evening Cpd over days 3, 
4 and 5 and subsequent performing RMANOVA tests including the terms DAY and DAY*Formulation. The 
effect of DAY was significant for the morning doses. The Applicant assumed the achievement of steady 
state based on the effect of the interaction DAY*Formulation, which was not significant. In response to 
D120 LoQ, the Applicant has adequately justified the inclusion of Formulation as a fixed effect instead of 
performing  separate  ANOVA  tests  for  each  product  as  well  as  the  use  of  the  interaction  term 
DAY*Formulation for the assumption that the steady state was achieved. 
In  response  to  D120  LoQ,  the  Applicant  has  submitted  results  of  the  exploratory  analysis  with  the 
requested  factors:  Group,  Sequence,  Sequence*Group,  Subject  (Sequence*Group),  Formulation, 
Group*Formulation and Period (Group) effects.  Group*Formulation effect are found to be statistically not 
significant  for  ln-transformed  PK  parameters  Cmax,ss  (p-value:  0.6880),  Cτ,ss  (p-value:  0.5814)  and 
AUCτ,ss (p-value: 0.8994) for Fampridine.    
The results of the study conclude bioequivalence with the chosen reference product with respect to the 
extent and rate of absorption/exposure as the 90% CI for the ln-transformed Cmax,ss, Cτ,ss and AUCτ,ss 
were within the acceptance range of 90.00-111.00%.  
In addition, in vitro studies to investigate the release in alcoholic solutions to confirm that there is no 
higher risk of dose-dumping is case of concomitant intake with alcohol has been performed.  
There are no major objections for approval from the clinical point of view.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A clinical overview is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why 
there is no need to generate additional clinical data.  
Based  on  the  results  of  the  presented  bioequivalence  studies,  Fampridine  Accord  10  mg 
prolonged-release  tablets  could  be  considered  bioequivalent  with  Fampyra  10  mg  prolonged-release 
tablets.  
The  treatment  was  well  tolerated  by  the  subjects  enrolled  in  the  study.  Fampridine  Accord  10  mg 
prolonged-release tablets, and Fampyra 10 mg prolonged-release tablets have similar safety profiles.

information in the PI is aligned with the originator product. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the Applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Fampyra. The bridging report submitted by the Applicant 
has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
The chemical-pharmaceutical documentation in relation to Fampridine and finished product are generally 
of sufficient quality in view of the present European regulatory requirements. 
This application concerns a generic version of Fampridine 10 mg prolonged-release tablets. The reference 
product Fampyra is indicated for the ‘improvement of walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis with 
walking  disability  (EDSS  4-7)’.  No  nonclinical  studies  have  been  provided  for  this  application  but  an 
adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and 
updated upon request and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not 
contain  new  data  on  the  PK  and  pharmacodynamics  as  well  as  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  active

substance; the Applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published 
literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis in which the PK profile of the test product Fampridine 
Accord 10 mg prolonged-release tablets is compared with the PK profile of the reference product Fampyra 
10 mg prolonged-release tablets (Biogen Netherlands B.V.). The study design was considered adequate 
to  evaluate  the  bioequivalence  of  this  formulation  and  was  in  line  with  the  respective  European 
requirements. One single dose study under fasted conditions, one single dose study under fed conditions 
and one multiple dose study under fasted conditions were conducted. 
Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The 
analytical method was validated. PK and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The  test  formulation  of  Fampridine  Accord  met  the  protocol-defined  criteria  for  bioequivalence  when 
compared with Fampyra. The point estimates and their 90% CI for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and 
Cmax  were  all  contained  within  the  protocol-defined  acceptance  range  of  90.00  to  111.11%. 
Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond 
those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Fampridine Accord is favourable in the following indication:

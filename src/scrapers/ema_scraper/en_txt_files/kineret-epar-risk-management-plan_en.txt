Dosage in the EEA 
Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
Current: 
RA 
The recommended dose of Kineret in adults and the elderly is 100 mg administered 
once a day by SC injection. The dose should be administered at approximately the 
same time each day. 
CAPS 
Adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body 
weight of 10 kg or above: 
Starting dose: 
The recommended starting dose in all CAPS subtypes is 1-2 mg/kg/day by 
subcutaneous injection. The therapeutic response is primarily reflected by reduction 
in clinical symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain, and headache, but also in 
inflammatory serum markers (CRP/SAA levels), or occurrence of flares. 
Maintenance dose in mild CAPS (FCAS, mild MWS):  
Patients are usually well-controlled by maintaining the recommended starting dose 
(1-2 mg/kg/day). 
Maintenance dose in severe CAPS (MWS and NOMID/CINCA):  
Dose increases may become necessary within 1-2 months based on therapeutic 
response. The usual maintenance dose in severe CAPS is 3-4 mg/kg/day, which can 
be adjusted to a maximum of 8 mg/kg/day.  
In addition to the evaluation of clinical symptoms and inflammatory markers in 
severe CAPS, assessments of inflammation of the CNS, including the inner ear 
(MRI or CT, lumbar puncture, and audiology) and eyes (ophthalmological 
assessments) are recommended after an initial 3 months of treatment, and thereafter 
every 6 months, until effective treatment doses have been identified. When patients 
are clinically well-controlled, CNS and ophthalmological monitoring may be 
conducted yearly. 
FMF 
The recommended dose for patients weighing 50 kg or more is 100 mg/day by 
subcutaneous injection. Patients weighing less than 50 kg should be dosed by body 
weight with a recommended dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day. In children with inadequate 
response the dose can be escalated up to 4 mg/kg/day. 
Still’s disease 
The recommended dose for patients weighing 50 kg or more is 100 mg/day by 
subcutaneous injection. Patients weighing less than 50 kg should be dosed by body 
weight with a starting dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day. In children with inadequate response 
the dose can be escalated up to 4 mg/kg/day. 
Response to treatment should be evaluated after 1 month: In case of persistent 
systemic manifestations dose may be adjusted in children or continued treatment 
with Kineret should be reconsidered by the treating physician. 
COVID-19 
The recommended dose of Kineret is 100 mg administered once a day by 
subcutaneous injection for 10 days. 
Pharmaceutical form(s) and

Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
Anakinra (Kineret®) is a human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist that has been on the market for 
more than 20 years for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients older than 18 years. It is 
considered a safe and well-established treatment based on experience from clinical trials and 
commercial use. Kineret is also indicated for 2 periodic fever syndromes including Familial 
Mediterranean Fever (FMF) and Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS), a disease 
which includes 3 disease subtypes ranging from the milder manifestations of Familial Cold 
Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) to the clinically 
most severe form, Chronic Infantile Neurologic, Cutaneous, and Arthritis (CINCA) syndrome, in 
the USA also called Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID). In addition, 
Kineret is indicated for Still’s disease in pediatric and adult patients, i.e., Systemic Juvenile 
Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD). Lastly, Kineret is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in the EU/EEA. 
The data evaluated in the risk management plan (RMP) are safety data from clinical studies in 
RA, CAPS, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and Still’s disease including patients with SJIA 
and AOSD. Safety data from a published clinical study in patients with FMF is also included. 
Postmarketing experience after Kineret launch in 2001 is also evaluated. 
The objective of this RMP is to present identified and potential risks associated with the use of 
Kineret in RA, CAPS, Still’s disease FMF and COVID-19, and to provide a framework for the 
pharmacovigilance plan and subsequent risk minimization activities. 
Still’s disease covers SJIA and AOSD. Although often treated as separate diagnostic entities, 
there is a growing understanding that SJIA and AOSD are one single autoinflammatory disease, 
representing a continuum of a disease entity with onset at different ages. Clinical study data in 
this RMP come from the MAH-sponsored safety study in JIA including 15 patients with SJIA 
(study 990758/990779) and data from the MAH-sponsored anaSTILLs clinical study in patients 
with Still’s disease (Sobi.ANAKIN-301). The information is summarized under the diagnostic 
label Still’s disease. 
In the safety specification, the indications RA, CAPS, Still’s disease and FMF are accounted for 
separately, with respect to clinical data. This is to clearly show the similarities of the safety 
profile between the 4 indications. 
For COVID-19 in adult patients with pneumonia, clinical study data in this RMP come from one  
Investigator Sponsored Study, SAVE-MORE. Post-marketing data of anakinra off label use in 
COVID-19 is also evaluated.

Part II: Module SI - Epidemiology of the indication(s) and target 
population(s) 
Indication Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) 
Kineret is indicated for the reduction in signs and symptoms and slowing the progression of 
structural damage in moderately to severely active RA, in patients 18 years of age and older. 
Kineret may be used alone or in combination with other DMARDs. 
Incidence and prevalence: 
In some geographic areas, the prevalence and incidence of RA vary across ethnic groups. Within 
ethnic groups, the incidence and prevalence of RA vary according to the geographic area of 
residence.

Demographics of the RA population, ethnic origin, and risk factors for the disease: 
Studies conducted at various time points within the same geographic regions suggest that the 
incidence of RA is declining over time and that this decline is greatest among women (2). One 
hypothesis for the decline in women may be the exposure to oral contraceptives, which has been 
suggested to decrease the incidence of RA. Other studies suggest a shift over time in RA onset 
toward older age groups. 
The prevalence is higher in females than in males (Table 3).

Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
RA is a multifactorial disease that results from interactions between genetic, epigenetic and 
environmental factors. Personal and lifestyle factors influence the course of the disease. Genetic 
factors (and gene-environment interactions) is calculated to contribute to 50 % to 60 % of the 
risk of developing RA. Further cofactors for risk of developing RA involve smoking, hormonal 
factors, ethnicity, pollutants, diet, urbanization, and infectious agents.  
The main existing treatment options: 
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) commonly used in RA patients in general 
are methotrexate, glucocorticoid agents, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, 
leflunomide, sulfasalazine, injectable gold, penicillamine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs). In RA, Kineret has its therapeutic indication in combination with methotrexate 
in adults with an inadequate response to methotrexate alone. The most commonly used group of 
biologicals for treatment of RA are anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. The concurrent use 
of anti-TNF agents and etanercept with Kineret is not recommended due to an increased risk of 
infections. As RA is prevalent in elderly, and as RA patients has an increased prevalence of 
cardiovascular disease, concomitant use of drugs for the treatment of these disorders is common 
(anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Janus Kinase inhibitors 
are also considered for the treatment of RA in case of absence of response to other DMARDs. 
According to the EULAR recommendations updated in 2022, JAK inhibitors can be used if there 
are no risk factors for cardiovascular and malignant diseases. 
In a large cohort of RA patients, the current drug exposures on risk of serious infection was 
evaluated (3). The cohort did not include any patients using Kineret, and thus characterizes a 
background pattern of serious infections with DMARDs in general. The highest risk estimates 
were associated with the agents that had the greatest immunosuppressant effects, including 
cyclophosphamide (cases/controls adjusted relative risk, RR 3.26) and glucocorticoids 
(RR 2.56). An increase in pneumonia related to glucocorticoids, similar to what has been 
reported by Wolfe et al. 2006 (4), was noted. A moderate increase in the relative risk of 
infections with azathioprine exposure (1.52), and a mildly increased risk with methotrexate 
exposure, was noted (1.10).  
Natural history of RA, including mortality and morbidity: 
RA patients have about 50 % increased risk of premature mortality with a life expectancy 
decreased by 3-10 years compared to the general population. The inflammatory condition 
independently increases the incidence of cardiovascular disease in RA. 
Epidemiology data are presented below for relevant identified and potential risks. 
Infections 
There are indications that infections are more frequent among RA patients than non-RA patients. 
In a cohort study, 609 RA patients and 609 non-RA study subjects were followed up for a mean 
of 12.7 years and 15.0 years, respectively (5). Hazards ratios for objectively confirmed 
infections, infections requiring hospitalization, and any documented infection in patients with 
RA were 1.70 (95 % CI 1.42−2.03), 1.83 (95 % CI 1.52–2.21), and 1.45 (95 % CI 1.29–1.64), 
Page 10 of 124 
 
 
Sobi 
Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
respectively, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, leukopenia, corticosteroid use, and 
diabetes mellitus. 
Malignancies 
RA patients appear to have an increased incidence of certain cancer types, including lung cancer 
and lymphoma. Lymphoma has the strongest association with RA compared with the general 
population, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In the general population, the incidence 
of NHL is approximately 10−45 per 100 000, depending on age group (6). This lymphoma 
incidence is increased 2-fold in patients with RA in most studies, and a large meta-analysis of 26 
studies confirmed a 2−3-fold incidence of lymphoma in RA (7), (8). An increased relative risk of 
multiple myeloma in RA patients has been found in some studies, but not in others (9).  
The risk of lung cancer is increased with an overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 
1.63 (95 % CI 1.43 to 1.87). In contrast, a reduced risk was observed for both colorectal and 
breast cancer (8).  
The incidence of cancer in relation to treatment with the most commonly used group of 
biologicals, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, was reported in a large Swedish cohort, in 
which the prevalence of anti-TNF therapy was 15 % (10). It was concluded that the overall 
occurrence of cancer during the first years following anti-TNF therapy in RA is not higher than 
that in biologics-naive patients with RA, nor does it increase with time. Several other studies 
have reached the same conclusions (11-13). 
Important co-morbidities: 
Cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiac failure are important 
co-morbidities in RA (14, 15). A meta-analysis calculated the standardized mortality ratios of 
CV disease to 1.6 (95 % CI 1.5, 1.8) (16). Epidemiological data suggest that the inflammatory 
condition independently increases CV disease in RA even after adjustment for traditional CV 
risk factors (15). 
RA has been associated with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) with a lifetime risk of developing 
ILD of 7.7% for RA patients vs. 0.9% for subjects without RA (17). 
Indication CAPS 
Kineret is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of Cryopyrin-Associated 
Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) including Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease 
(NOMID) / Chronic Infantile Neurological, Cutaneous, Articular Syndrome (CINCA), Muckle-
Wells Syndrome (MWS), and Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS). 
Incidence and Prevalence: 
The estimated incidence of CAPS in the US and in Europe is 1:1 million (18).  
Internationally, the prevalence of FCAS and MWS is similar, while the large majority (>80 %) 
of the estimated 400-500 CAPS patients in the USA have FCAS, the mildest phenotype, due to a 
Page 11 of 124

Kineret 
founder effect. In the US, there is a small number of patients with MWS and even fewer with 
NOMID, while in Europe, MWS is diagnosed more commonly. 
Cuisset et al. 2011 (19) conducted a retrospective review (2001–2009) of genetic analysis data 
and request forms of patients with an NLRP3 mutation living in France. Over 800 analyses of 
this gene have been conducted, identifying 135 cases with an NLRP3 mutation (55 probands; 
33 multiplex families); the estimated prevalence in France was equal to 1/360 000.

CAPS is an ultra-rare, monogenic disease, caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the 
NLRP3 gene, which generates a life-long autoinflammatory syndrome. CAPS includes 
3 subdiagnoses ranging from the milder manifestations of FCAS and MWS to the clinically most 
severe form, CINCA syndrome, also called NOMID in the US. NOMID/CINCA is less common 
than FCAS/MWS worldwide and typically occurs sporadically without a family history due to 
de novo mutations (20). 
The patients currently identified are predominantly of Caucasian background with an equal sex 
distribution. 
The main existing treatment options: 
Before anti-IL-1-directed therapy was introduced in CAPS, a broad variety of anti-inflammatory 
treatments of CAPS were tried. None of these have been consistently beneficial, and today 
IL-1-inhibitors are recognized to be the only effective treatment alternative. In mild CAPS 
(FCAS, mild MWS) patients, additive treatment with NSAIDs during flares in some patients 
ameliorates joint pain. 
In severe CAPS patients, at baseline in study 03-AR-0298 before initiation of Kineret treatment, 
16 of 34 patients (47.1 %) in the ITT population were treated with oral steroids with a mean 
daily dose of 0.76 mg/kg (prednisone-equivalents). Nine patients (26.5 %) were using DMARDs 
(methotrexate). Methotrexate did not prevent flares during the withdrawal phase in study 03-AR-
0298.

morbidity:

damage caused by chronic inflammation, are consequences of the disease. This includes 
functional organ damage affecting vision, hearing ambulating, and quality of life (QoL). High 
levels of serum amyloid A may induce the risk of complications to amyloidosis in some patients. 
Apart from an estimated risk of systemic amyloidosis and renal failure in 10 % to 50 % of MWS 
patients, due to the rarity of the disease, the epidemiology of other comorbidities in CAPS are 
largely unknown.

Indication Still’s disease 
Kineret is indicated for the treatment of Still’s disease, including Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic 
Arthritis (SJIA) and Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD), with active systemic features or in 
patients with continued disease activity after treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids. Kineret can be given as monotherapy or in combination with 
other anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
Incidence and Prevalence: 
Robust epidemiologic data on Still’s disease in pediatric and adult patients are lacking since 
most observations have been reported in small series. 
Among the various JIA subtypes, SJIA accounts for 5 % to 15 % of children with JIA seen in 
North America and Europe. Some population-based studies are available from Europe showing 
an annual incidence for SJIA between 0.3–0.8 cases per 100 000 persons for children under 
16 years of age. The incidence appears to be higher in northern compared to southern European 
countries. In Asia, SJIA may account for a greater proportion of all childhood arthritis. In India 
and in Japan 25 % and 50 %, respectively, of JIA appears to be SJIA (21). In SJIA, there is no 
distinct sex predilection.

Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
AOSD occurs worldwide and among all ethnic groups. The disease affects usually young adults, 
the median age at diagnosis is approximately 36 years (22), though onsets have been described 
up to 83 years (23). The incidence has been estimated at 0.16 (per 100 000 persons) in France 
(24), 0.22 in Japan (25), and 0.4 in Norway (26). The reported prevalence rates range from 0.1 to 
1 per 100 000 depending on the region studied (27). 
Demographics of the Still’s disease population and ethnic origin and risk factors for the 
disease:  
Because of the similar systemic clinical features of SJIA and AOSD, there is a growing 
understanding that these clinical phenotypes represent the same disease continuum with different 
ages of onset, i.e., Still’s disease in pediatric and adult patients (28). In addition, evidence 
suggests that SJIA and AOSD are also comparable on a molecular level. Both conditions are 
characterized by activation of the innate immune system, including elevations of inflammatory 
cytokines and proteins such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, and S100 proteins (29) and both are highly 
responsive to IL-1 inhibition (30). 
The hormonal influences are poorly understood. However, the risk for disease recurrence is 
increased during the second trimester of pregnancy and the postpartum period (31). 
The main existing treatment options: 
There are multiple currently available therapies for the treatment of active Still’s disease. 
These therapies can be broadly grouped as NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, classical DMARDs, and 
biologic DMARDs that inhibit IL-1, IL-6, or TNF-α. The anti-IL-1 agent canakinumab and the 
anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab are both approved by the EMA and the FDA for treatment of SJIA. 
Canakinumab was approved in 2016 by the EMA for treatment of Still’s disease including 
AOSD and SJIA. 
NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and indomethacin have traditionally been the first 
therapies in suspected or newly diagnosed Still’s disease. NSAIDs have certain risks: 
nephrotoxicity, pseudoporphyria/other skin manifestations, and gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
such as gastritis and duodenitis are common (32). In elderly and other predisposed patients, 
NSAIDs can cause severe and sometimes fatal gastrointestinal bleedings. 
Systemic glucocorticoids are also used in the initial treatment of Still´s disease, especially for 
patients with active systemic features (32). Glucocorticoids can control the clinical 
manifestations in approximately 60 % of the patients (33). However, glucocorticoids easily 
induce dependence; steroid dependence occurred in 42 % of the cases in one study (28). 
Glucocorticoids have a significant side effect profile, especially when used chronically or at high 
doses. Long-term glucocorticoid exposure in patients carries the potential for serious adverse 
events, such as infections, osteoporosis, diabetes, and growth disturbances in children (28, 32). 
If NSAID and/or glucocorticoid treatment are insufficient, DMARDs such as methotrexate are 
frequently added (22). DMARDs are considered early when patients present predictive factors 
for steroid-dependence, or at the first signs of steroid-dependence. However, DMARDs may 
cause rash, stomach disturbances, and may be toxic to the liver or bone marrow (28).

Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
The current treatments of Still’s disease are also source of many severe complications (22). In a 
cohort of 57 subjects, 21 % of NSAIDs-treated patients experienced gastrointestinal side effects 
despite proton pump inhibitor administration, 75 % of corticosteroid-treated patients suffered 
from adverse events (Cushing syndrome, osteoporosis, aseptic osteonecrosis, diabetes, 
hypertension, cataract, psychiatric disorders), whereas one third of methotrexate-treated patients 
experienced complications, such as elevated liver enzymes (15 %), low blood cell counts (10 %), 
and cough (6 %). Furthermore, the treatments used in Still’s disease increases the risk for 
infectious complications (28). 
For the management of systemic features of the disease, anti-IL-1 agents such as anakinra, 
canakinumab, rilonacept and the anti-IL-6 agent, tocilizumab, have been demonstrated to be 
effective in clinical trials (29). Several uncontrolled studies and reports demonstrate variable 
effectiveness of TNF-α blockers in refractory chronic polyarticular Still’s disease (29). 
Natural history of Still’s disease, including mortality and morbidity: 
Patients with either SJIA or AOSD exhibit classical clinical and laboratory features, including 
daily spiking fever, arthralgia or arthritis, evanescent (not fixed) rash, and increased white blood 
cell count (mainly neutrophils). 
Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a severe and potentially fatal complication of Still's 
disease. MAS (also known as secondary or reactive hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
[HLH]) is a process of rapid expansion and activation of macrophages and T lymphocytes 
leading to a “cytokine storm”. Patients with MAS usually have laboratory evidence of cytopenias 
(thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), elevated serum hepatic enzymes, coagulopathy (elevated D-
dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and decreasing fibrinogen), decreasing erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (owing to consumption of fibrinogen), elevated triglycerides, elevated lactate 
dehydrogenase, and hyperferritinemia (34). 
The frequency of fully developed MAS is 12 to 15 % in both pediatric and adult patients but 
subclinical and mild MAS is described in up to >50 % of patients with SJIA (28), (35), (36). 
MAS remains a significant cause of mortality in patients with SJIA with an overall mortality rate 
of 8 % (37). Its high mortality rate may be influenced by an early diagnosis with consequent 
aggressive treatments, which have been shown to improve the survival of these patients. 
Infections are well recognized triggers for MAS in patients with Still’s disease. 
Other morbidity in the Still´s population include bone and cartilage erosion with functional 
handicap, pulmonary hypertension, pericarditis, peritonitis, disseminated intravascular 
coagulopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and 
fulminant hepatic failure (28). As in other autoinflammatory syndromes, amyloidosis has been 
reported in a few cases of chronic uncontrolled inflammation (28).  
Important co-morbidities: 
Important comorbidities in Still’s disease include disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (38). Some children have pulmonary involvement, including the later development 
of pulmonary hypertension or interstitial lung disease (39).

Athreya et al. 1980 (40), before the introduction of IL-1 blocking agents, reported 8/191 children 
with JRA who had involvement of the lung or pleura for more than 6 weeks, whereof 6 with 
SJIA. 4 patients had persisting lung disease, in 2 cases described as interstitial. The article’s 
literature review found 3 case reports on patients with JRA that died due to their lung disease, 
and autopsy showed interstitial fibrosis in 2/3. 
Indication Familial Mediterranean fever 
Kineret is indicated for the treatment of  adult and pediatric patients with Familial Mediterranean 
Fever (FMF). Kineret should be given in combination with colchicine, if appropriate. 
Incidence and prevalence: 
FMF is a rare genetic disease originally restricted to populations living around the Mediterranean 
basin. For example, there is an estimated total of 100 000 FMF patients in Turkey (41). The 
prevalence rate in France in 2013 was estimated at 1 in 5000 individuals, i.e. 5000 to a maximum 
of 10 000 patients (42). Significant number of patients are also found in Germany, Greece, 
Cyprus, and Italy (41, 43, 44). An epidemiological study in Cyprus concluded that 1:25 Greek-
Cypriots is a carrier of one of the three most common genetic mutations associated with FMF 
(43). The outcome of a similar genetic study among Italian patients with relapsing fever of 
unknown origin resulted in the investigators concluding that “familial Mediterranean fever is no 
longer a rare disease in Italy” (44). Most FMF patients in France are of North African origin, and 
most of those who live in Germany are of Turkish origin. Most FMF patients in Italy are located 
in the central and southern parts of the country, probably originating from Phoenicians and other 
ascendants who came by way of the sea (41). Because of ongoing migration, the future incidence 
is likely to increase in the EU. 
Demographics of the FMF population ethnic origin, and risk factors for the disease:  
Regarding ethnic origin see Incidence and prevalence, above. The onset of FMF occurs before 
the age of 20 years in approximately 90% of patients (42). In one study, of 814 patients with 
FMF, in 254 patients (31.2 %) the first FMF attack occurred at ≤2 years of age, with a mean 
(SD) age at onset of 1.1 (0.8) years (45). The lowest age at onset, 4 months, was described (46) 
among 194 children with 24% having onset below 2 years. FMF is a monogenic inherited 
condition that shares the same pathophysiological features resulting from the activation of the 
inflammasome with several other hereditary periodic fever syndromes, e.g., CAPS. The 
inflammasome constituent that underlies this derangement is a malfunctioning pyrin, encoded by 
a mutated MEFV, the FMF-associated gene. Mutation of the MEFV gene encoding for pyrin is 
leading to malfunctioning and overproduction of interleukin-1 β (IL-1 β) (47, 48).  
The frequency of heterozygous carriers of an MEFV (for MEditerranean FeVer) gene mutation, 
responsible for FMF, is higher than 1 in 5 in Sephardic Jews and Armenians (42), although some 
patients diagnosed with FMF according to clinical criteria have no mutation (49). The specific 
mutation sequence alterations named p.H478Y and p.E163A are mainly found among Spanish 
patients (41). The evidence based clinical criteria for diagnosis of FMF (see below Table 6) does 
not require an identified mutation.

The main existing treatment options: 
Colchicine, an alkaloid with inhibitory effects on multiple cellular functions, including 
microtubule assembly, cell adhesion, and inflammasome activation (50) is first-line treatment of 
FMF, according to the EULAR guideline. Colchicine, however, is approved for the treatment of 
FMF in a limited number of EU/EAA countries only. Colchicine dose ranges between 1 and 
3 mg per day and is determined clinically on the basis of its effect on the prevention of attacks. 
During attacks, the EULAR guideline recommends to continue the usual dose of colchicine and 
use non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (51). 
Although colchicine is safe and efficacious in most patients, 10–45% of patients are either 
resistant to, partially responsive, or intolerant to treatment with colchicine despite good 
adherence to therapy (51-53).  
Suggested therapeutic alternatives for patients in whom oral colchicine treatment is ineffective 
include thalidomide, interferon alpha, intravenous colchicine, and tumor necrosis factor blockers 
(54-56). All of these treatments are limited by insufficient effect, safety concerns, unavailability, 
and high price, and none has been approved by a regulatory body. 
In patients not responding to the maximum tolerated dosage of colchicine and thus regarded as 
non-responders or resistant to colchicine (51, 52, 57), an alternative biological treatment such as 
IL-1 blockade is indicated according to the EULAR guideline (51). The long-acting IL-1β 
monoclonal antibody canakinumab (ILARISTM) is approved in the EU, US, and in Israel for the 
treatment of FMF. 
Colchicine should be co-administered with alternative biological therapies given that it may 
reduce the risk of amyloidosis despite persistence of attacks (EULAR recommendations, (51).  
Natural history of the FMF population, including mortality and morbidity: 
FMF shares the same pathophysiological features resulting from the activation of the 
inflammasome with several other hereditary periodic fever syndromes (e.g. CAPS, among 
others), belonging to a family of rare disorders characterized by seemingly unprovoked and self-
limited bouts of inflammation. 
Patients with FMF experience a marked decrease in quality of life (58). FMF typically presents 
with recurrent febrile attacks, accompanied by signs of peritonitis, pleuritis or acute synovitis, 
lasting 1–3 days, and resolving spontaneously. Attacks occur randomly, from once per week to 
once in several months, and patients are free of symptoms between the attacks. Emotional stress, 
fatigue, surgery, menstruation, vigorous exercise and cold exposure may trigger an attack. 
Abdominal attacks are the most frequent manifestations (90–93% in patients). Monoarthritis, 
mostly of the large joints of the legs (ankle, knee or hip), is the second most common form of 
attack occurring in 25–30% of the cases (59, 60). The joint is warm, tender and often red, 
resembling septic arthritis precipitated by minor trauma or effort. Approximately 5% of patients 
with FMF develop chronic joint damage, the majority resembling spondyloarthritis with 
sacoileitis and peripheral monoarthritis or oligarthritis (51). 
The symptomatic episodes are accompanied by an increase in inflammatory markers: white 
blood cells, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocytes sedimentation rate (ESR), serum amyloid A 
(SAA), fibrinogen, haptoglobin, C3, and C4 (61).

FMF is diagnosed by the clinical picture that can be supported, but not necessarily excluded, by 
genetic testing. Various diagnostic criteria have been suggested (60), including the Tel 
Hashomer criteria (62, 63). In a recent study (59) using a large international registry of 
autoinflammatory diseases (Eurofever), valid, evidence based, clinical classification criteria were 
suggested to differentiate between 4 major autoinflammatory diseases (FMF, CAPS, MKD, 
TRAPS). A diagnosis of FMF is considered if a patient scores a total of at least 60 among the 
criteria (Table 6). With this scoring, the overall sensitivity and specificity were 68 and 87%, 
respectively, in a group of patients referred to as a “gold standard” – those carrying two MEFV 
mutations. The percentage of patients positively diagnosed according to the criteria for different 
genotypes (less than the “gold standard”) was between 50 and 75%.

Amyloidosis is the most devastating complication in untreated FMF, a progressive condition 
characterized by deposition of misfolded insoluble proteins in various organs ultimately leading 
to organ damage. Amyloidosis results from excessive production of serum amyloid A (SAA), an 
acute phase reactant protein released from hepatocytes via stimulation of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines e.g. IL-1, and involves primarily kidneys followed by intestines and heart. 
Amyloidosis may also occur in adrenal glands, spleen, lung, and testes. 
In the past, amyloidosis was a common complication in untreated FMF patients, beginning with 
asymptomatic proteinuria and gradually developing to end-stage renal disease within 2–13 years. 
Currently however, the prevalence of amyloidosis has dropped significantly as a result of 
colchicine treatment, environmental factors or epigenetic phenomenon (64). According to the 
EULAR guideline FMF treatment needs to be intensified in patients with amyloidosis using the 
maximal tolerated dose of colchicine and supplemented with biologics as required (51).

Sobi 
Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
Patients with colchicine-resistant FMF continue to have serositis attacks and are at increased risk 
of dying from amyloidosis or developing other conditions related to chronic inflammation. 
Resistance to colchicine as defined by the EULAR guideline is characterised by ≥1 attack per 
month in patients treated with the maximum tolerated dosage for ≥6 months.  
Abdominal pain during attacks might pose challenges with differential diagnosis, and patients 
may undergo unnecessary abdominal surgeries; although after diagnosis, the rate decreases (58). 
Repeated peritonitis attacks with exudative fluid and inflammation might cause adhesions in 
peritoneal lining over time, leading to obstruction, volvulus, and strangulation (58). Cryptogenic 
hepatic cirrhosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been reported in FMF (65, 66). In 
female untreated patients infertilility is common, but has also been reported in females who have 
had long-term treatment with colchicine (67). Spontaneous abortions or premature birth are more 
common in FMF compared to healthy women (68, 69) both in untreated and colchicine treated 
patients. Male infertility has also been reported (58, 67). 
Important co-morbidities: 
Vasculitises are a group of diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels. Several 
retrospective studies have reported an increased incidence of vasculitis in FMF patients, namely 
IgA vasculitis and polyarteritis nodosa (70). IgA vasculitis (formerly known as  Henoch-
Schönlein purpura) occurs in 3 to 11 % of patients (71). Behçet’s disease has been reported to 
occur in combination with FMF (58). 
Indication COVID-19 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On 11 March, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global 
pandemic. Kineret is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 
adult patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who 
are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure determined by plasma concentration of 
soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) ≥ 6ng/ml (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 5.1). 
Incidence and prevalence: 
As of February 10, 2022, more than 394 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported 
globally, including more than 5.7 million deaths. In the EU/EEA, more than 151 million cases 
have been reported, including 1.8 million deaths (72). 
Demographics of the COVID-19 population, ethnic origin, and risk factors for the disease: 
COVID-19 disease has spread all over the world, leading to an ongoing pandemic, and there is 
an urgent need for effective treatments. Individuals of Black and Asian ethnicity seems to be 
Page 19 of 124 
 
 
 
 
 
Sobi 
Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, most likely due to socioeconomic factors (73, 74). 
Advanced age and comorbidities, e.g. hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, 
obesity are the main risk factors for severe infection (75).  
The main existing treatment options: 
Early during the infection, the disease is primarily driven by replication of SARS-CoV-2. Later, 
the disease is predominantly driven by a hyperinflammatory response that leads to tissue damage 
and organ failure. It is anticipated that antiviral therapies would have a favorable effect during 
the early phase of the infection, while anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies are 
likely to be more beneficial in the later stages of COVID-19 Apart from preventive measures like 
keeping a physical distance and vaccination programs, medical treatment of COVID-19 include 
antiviral therapy, oxygen supplementation, supportive therapy, and corticosteroids (76, 77). 
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, immunomodulators were suggested as one of 
the main strategies to attenuate the exaggerated immune response of the host. The most 
commonly administered drugs are anakinra and tocilizumab targeting the IL-1 and the IL-6 
pathways, respectively.  Tocilizumab is authorized for use for the treatment of COVID-19 in the 
EU. As of February 15, 2022, there are 5 antiviral medications and 1 immunomodulator 
authorized for treatment of COVID-19 in the EU apart from Kineret (78). 
Natural history of COVID-19 infection, including mortality and morbidity: 
COVID-19 can be classified into 3 clinical stages. In stage 1, an estimated 80 to 84 % of infected 
patients are slightly symptomatic. In stage 2a, patients have a nonhypoxemic pneumonia but can 
advance to a hypoxemic pneumonia in stage 2b or ARDS in stage 3. After 
9 to 10 days, 17 to 
20 % of patients can evolve toward more severe stages 2b or 3, with increasing requirement for 
oxygen necessitating admission into an ICU with noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation 
(76, 79). 
∼
At the more severe stages of COVID-19, mortality is reaching 60 % (80, 81) and SRF from 
ARDS is the leading cause of death (82). By preventing the progression from LRTI and 
pneumonia to ARDS and SRF, the prognosis for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 
would be improved, lives would be saved, and the burden on global healthcare systems during 
the pandemic would be reduced.  
The most important symptoms in adults are fever, cough, fatigue, difficulty breathing, and 
myalgia (83). Elevated liver enzymes are also relatively common indicating that the SARS-CoV-
2 virus has propensity for the liver which may also limit later therapeutic choices. 
Lymphocytopenia occurs in 87 % of the cases. Chest radiographs are often benign initially or 
may show signs of interstitial pneumonia with a ground glass appearance (84). 
Important co-morbidities: 
The risk of severe COVID-19 increases as the number of underlying medical conditions 
increases in an individual (85). The most frequently reported comorbidities associated with 
Page 20 of 124

severity and fatal outcome of COVID-19 are hypertension, heart conditions (such as heart 
failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies), diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic kidney 
disease, and respiratory diseases (including interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis and 
pulmonary hypertension). A systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate comorbidities 
associated with severe and fatal cases of COVID-19 were conducted by Spencer Gold et al. 
Hypertension and diabetes were found to be more frequent among the deceased patients 
compared to total cases. Respiratory diseases were more common among fatal versus total cases 
(75).

Part II: Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety specification 
SII.1 
Repeated dose toxicity 
The subchronic and chronic effects of anakinra have been evaluated for up to 6 months in rats 
and up to 28 days in monkeys after intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administration. Signs 
of perivascular inflammation were detected in rats after IV administration at the site of injection 
and at the SC injection sites as local reactions with trace of inflammation. Similar to the findings 
in rats, chronic inflammation at the injection sites (chronic lymphohistiocytic inflammation) 
were observed in monkeys.  
Moreover, renal interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration and chronic progressive nephropathy 
were observed in rats administered 200 mg/kg anakinra SC for 6 months. The nature of the 
lesions indicated that they were aging-related changes specific for the rat and not directly 
mediated by anakinra. The rats also showed proteinuria, as did rhesus monkeys treated SC with 
anakinra for 4 weeks. The monkey urine was ELISA-positive for anakinra protein, indicating 
that the proteinuria observed was a consequence of the treatment causing a high protein load to 
the kidneys related to the renal excretion of anakinra. 
SII.2 
Reproductive/Developmental toxicity 
The reproduction and developmental toxicity of anakinra has been evaluated in 2 species. 
Fertility, embryo-fetal development, and peri- and postnatal development reproduction studies 
were conducted in rats and an embryo-fetal development study in rabbits at doses up to 
200 mg/kg/day. These studies did not reveal any evidence of reproduction toxicity or 
developmental toxicity related to anakinra. 
The effect of anakinra treatment on the juvenile development of the hippocampus-dependent 
learning and memory function has been evaluated in rats at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day. No signs 
of adverse effects were detected on the performance in a multiple Y water maze test when 
compared to controls. 
SII.3 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
The genotoxicity properties of anakinra were evaluated in a complete set of in vitro and in vivo 
genotoxicity tests. Anakinra did not induce gene mutations in either bacteria or mammalian cells 
in vitro. In vivo, there was no evidence of chromosomal aberrations or micronuclei in bone 
marrow cells in mice treated with anakinra. The carcinogenic potential of anakinra has not been 
evaluated in a formal long-term carcinogenicity study in a rodent species. However, a long-term 
carcinogenicity study is generally inappropriate for biologics such as anakinra.

Anakinra is not predicted to cause any harm to the 
fetus or the mother when used during pregnancy. 
Standard carcinogenicity bioassays are generally 
inappropriate for biotechnology-derived 
pharmaceuticals. There are no concerns about a 
carcinogenic potential inherent to anakinra based on 
the pharmacological mode of action and observed 
minimal effects on the host cell resistance studies and 
slight enhancement of natural killer (NK) cell activity. 
SII.4 
Conclusions on non-clinical data 
Injection site reactions have been identified as an important potential risk in humans. No other 
important potential risks have been identified in the non-clinical studies.  
Part II: Module SIII - Clinical trial exposure 
SIII.1 
Brief overview of development 
Following an extensive clinical trial development program, Kineret was authorized in the US in 
2001, in the EU/EEA and Canada in 2002, Australia (2003), Israel (2011), Great Britain (2021), 
and in Russia in 2022 for the treatment of RA in combination with methotrexate in adults with an 
inadequate response to methotrexate alone. Since then, Kineret has also been authorized in the 
US and Canada for the treatment of NOMID (2012 and 2017 respectively), in EU/EEA, Great 
Britain, Israel, Russia and Australia for the treatment of CAPS (2013-2021), in Australia for the 
treatment of SJIA (2015), and in the EU/EEA, Great Britain and Russia for the treatment of 
Still’s disease including SJIA and AOSD (2018, 2021). In 2020, Kineret was authorized for FMF 
in EU/EEA and Israel, and in 2021 in Great Britain and Russia, and for Deficiency of 
Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) in the US in 2020. In 2021, Kineret was authorized 
for the treatment of adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in the EU/EEA.

specifically stated. The trials included in the RA safety pool are presented in Table 8 and are 
hereafter referred to as the safety pool. 
Open label safety trials, trials in healthy volunteers, indications other than RA, and trials where 
Kineret treatment was used in combination with other treatments (except methotrexate) are not 
included in the RA safety pool.

Clinical trial safety data in CAPS 
Clinical safety data in CAPS in this RMP are derived from study 03-AR-0298, which is 
presented in Table 9. This trial is an investigator-sponsored trial, conducted at the National 
Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, USA. A trial report 
was compiled by Sobi. The trial included 43 patients. NOMID/CINCA was diagnosed in 36 
patients (83.7 %), and 7 patients (16.3 %) were enrolled fulfilling the trial inclusion criteria, but 
had characteristics overlapping between MWS and NOMID/CINCA.

There are 2 MAH-sponsored clinical trials that have included patients with Still’s disease, see 
Table 10.  
The trial 990758/990779 (published by Ilowite et al. 2009 (86)) was performed by the former 
MAH Amgen and data have been re-evaluated by Sobi.  
This was a safety trial in 86 pediatric patients with JIA, whereof 15 with SJIA. The trial 
consisted of 3 phases: an initial 12-week open-label phase of trial 990758, a 16-week blinded 
placebo-controlled phase and a 12-month open-label phase of trial 990779. 
The trial Sobi.ANAKIN-301 (anaSTILLs) was performed by Sobi and was a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter phase 3 efficacy and safety study in pediatric and 
adult patients with Still’s disease (SJIA and AOSD). Totally 12 patients received study 
treatment, 6 patients received anakinra and 6 patients received placebo. One of the patients in the 
placebo group was diagnosed with lymphoma rather than Still’s disease. The study duration was 
16 weeks which included a 12-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period.

Clinical trial safety data in FMF 
There are no MAH-sponsored clinical studies in FMF, and this indication is therefore not 
included in the Clinical trial exposure tables below. However, there is an external study, a 
published double-blind placebo controlled study in 25 patients with FMF whereof 12 patients 
were treated with anakinra (87).  
Clinical trial safety data in COVID-19 
Safety and efficacy have been evaluated  in the investigator sponsored study SAVE-MORE, a 
pivotal, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, SoC-controlled study sponsored and performed 
by the Hellenic Institute for the Study of Sepsis (HISS). In the SAVE-MORE multicenter 
trial, 594 hospitalized patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 pneumonia and plasma 
suPAR of 6 ng/mL or more and receiving SoC were 1:2 randomized to subcutaneous treatment 
with placebo or 100 mg anakinra once daily for 10◦days; 189 patients were allocated to the 
placebo and SoC arm and 405 patients were allocated to the anakinra and SoC arm. 
There is 1 MAH-sponsored clinical trial that has included patients with COVID-19. A Phase 2/3, 
randomized, open-label, parallel group, 3-arm, multicenter study (Sobi.IMMUNO-101; EudraCT 
Number: 2020-001167-93) was initiated to investigate the efficacy and safety of anakinra and 
emapalumab versus standard of care (SoC) in reducing hyper-inflammation and respiratory 
distress in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, recruitment in the study was 
prematurely closed due to the evolvement of SoC treatment during the timeframe of the study 
Page 26 of 124 
 
 
Sobi 
Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
and its effect on recruitment. As a result, only 16 patients were enrolled. Anakinra was 
administered as 4-times daily intravenous infusions for 15 days (400 mg/day in total, divided 
into 4 doses given every 6 hours). A total of 16 patients completed screening and were enrolled 
in the study. Five patients received treatment with emapalumab, 5 patients received treatment 
with anakinra, and 6 patients received SoC.

Pediatric patients 
Exposure 
Kineret is currently indicated for pediatric use in CAPS, FMF and Still’s disease. One 
study has been performed in CAPS patients (study 03-AR-0298) and 1 study has been 
performed in children with juvenile RA, a condition that has been renamed JIA 
(990758/990779). In addition, 1 study has been performed in Still’s disease (AOSD and 
SJIA, Sobi.ANAKIN-301). 
36 patients, aged <18 years, with the most severe form of CAPS, NOMID/CINCA, have 
been exposed to Kineret for up to 5 years (open-label study 03-AR-0298, total exposure 
131 patient years). Age at start of treatment influences the individual functional outcome 
of treatment in severely affected patients. The results from study 03-AR-0298 and the 
supportive published efficacy studies indicate that Kineret treatment prevented hearing 
loss in the youngest patients without further damage to the cochlea. In older patients with 
long-standing, untreated disease, treatment may avert the progression of further 
impairment, but does not normalize hearing in severe cases. 
86 patients with JIA aged 2 to 17 years, including 15 patients with SJIA (Study 990758). 
Long-term safety in the same patients evaluated in an open-labeled extension (Study 
990779). 
5 patients with SJIA were exposed to Kineret in the 12-week double-blind, placebo-
controlled study Sobi.ANAKIN-301. The patients were younger than 12 years old..  
FMF: No experience 
Covid-19: No experience

In the Sobi.IMMUNO-101 study in patients with COVID-19, 3 of the 5 patients in the 
anakinra treatment arm were >65 years old and none were >75 years old. In the SAVE-
MORE study, 173 patients > 65 years old with COVID-19 were treated with anakinra. 
No elderly patients with CAPS or Still’s disease have been exposed to Kineret in study 03-
AR-0298, 990758/990779 and Sobi.ANAKIN-301.

Not included in the clinical development program. Sobi has information about 381 reports 
of pregnancy during Kineret exposure, up to 1 May 2022. The outcome of pregnancies 
was 99 normal infants, 13 children inherited/affected by CAPS or TRAPS 82 pregnancies 
had abnormal outcomes (spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, adverse events in child). The 
outcome is unknown in 187 of the reports.

9 patients with various degrees of renal impairment (SAVE-MORE study). 
The supportive published efficacy studies included further patients with renal functional 
impairment, A subgroup of patients with amyloidotic manifestations (affecting 
approximately 1/4 of MWS patients) and renal functional impairment at baseline were 
included in the studies by Kuemmerle-Deschner et al. 2011 (88), Hawkins et al. 2004 (89), 
and Leslie et al. 2006 (90). Amyloidosis was halted or improved, and a gradual resolution 
of amyloid-related nephrotic syndrome manifestations was detected.

RA: No experience 
CAPS: The safety profile of Kineret in CAPS patients in study 03-AR-0298 is not 
clinically relevantly influenced by the absence or presence of a detectable, somatic NLRP3 
mutation, or by the type of NLRP3 mutation, when detectable. In the supportive published 
efficacy studies in CAPS, the majority of studies included patients of all ages and all 
patients reportedly did respond to both short- and long-term treatment, irrespective of 
NLRP3 gene mutation, age, and sex.

Exposure 
In 24 Japanese healthy volunteers aged 20 to 28 years, exposed to single ascending IV 
doses of anakinra, no apparent difference compared to Caucasians regarding safety and 
pharmacokinetics was observed (study 0541). 
RA: In 15 Chinese patients with RA the exposure and apparent clearance of anakinra in 
Chinese patients were comparable with those for non-Chinese subjects with RA 
(Study 20000152). In the RA safety pool there were no apparent differences between non-
Caucasians (n=257) and Caucasians (n=2115) regarding safety parameters. 
CAPS patients: Among 43 patients (study 03-AR.0298) 36 were white. The other 7 
patients were of Asian (1), black (1) or mixed (5) origin. All patients responded to 
treatment irrespective of ethnicity. 
Still’s disease patients: 13 Caucasian, 5 Hispanic/Latino, 2 Black/African American, 1 
American Indian/Alaska Native (studies 990758/990779 and Sobi.ANAKIN-301). 
COVID-19: all 405 patients treated with anakinra were white (SAVE-MORE study). 
Part II: Module SV - Post-authorisation experience 
Kineret was authorized in the US in 2001 and in the EU in 2002, so there is more than 20 years 
of post-marketing experience, which has been taken into consideration when preparing this 
RMP. 
SV.1  Post-authorisation exposure 
SV.1.1 Method used to calculate exposure 
Commercial use of Kineret was estimated by determining the number of patients and patient 
years of exposure from monthly product distribution by region and includes all preparations (i.e., 
both the previous non-graduated and the current graduated syringe). 
The MAH used market research to track US patients over 12 months and monitored their 
purchasing patterns to determine their compliance. The compliance rate of 5.95 vials per week 
(85 % of the recommended dose) is used for calculation of exposure for US and Canada. A 
compliance rate of 5.6 vials per week (80 % of the recommended dose) is used for the 
calculation of exposure for all other countries. 
Exposure is calculated based on the approved dose for patients with RA, i.e., 100 mg/day. 
During the first years after approval Kineret was almost exclusively used for RA in the approved 
dose. Kineret is approved for the treatment of RA in the US, EU/EEA, Great Britain, Canada, 
Israel, Australia and Russia. In the US and Canada Kineret is also approved for NOMID. Kineret 
is approved for the whole spectrum of CAPS in the EU/EEA, Great Britain, Israel, Russia and 
Australia. In addition, Kineret is approved for the treatment of SJIA (Australia), Still’s disease 
including SJIA and AOSD (EU/EEA, Great Britain and Russia), FMF (EU/EEA, Great Britain, 
Israel and Russia), COVID-19 (EU/EEA), and DIRA (US). In addition Sobi is aware of off-label 
Page 39 of 124 
 
 
Sobi 
Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
use in other indications. In some of the indications where Kineret is used the dose can be both 
higher and lower than the approved dose in RA. This means that the estimated exposure should 
be interpreted with caution, especially during later years. 
SV.1.2 Exposure 
Total worldwide commercial exposure on 1 May 2022, was estimated to be 163,620 patient 
years, including use in named patient programs and compassionate use programs. Estimated 
exposure to commercial Kineret broken down into geographic areas is shown in Table 23.

SV1.2.1 Post-authorization exposure by indication  
Besides being used for the on-label indications through literature articles and individual case 
safety reports (ICSRs), Sobi is aware that Kineret is used off-label in both adults and children. 
Despite limited licensed indications, anti-IL-1 agents are often used in real-life practice for an 
increasing number of diseases. A national survey to record the off-label use in France was started 
in January 2011. The survey was coordinated by the French National Reference Centre for Auto-
inflammatory Diseases under the sponsorship of the “Club Rhumatisme et Inflammation” (CRI). 
The survey included 189 patients (100 males) from 38 centres. At the time of anti-IL-1 therapy 
introduction, 139 patients were adults, and 50 were children or adolescents (<18 years old). The 
mean age at treatment onset for children and adolescents was 8.3 years and for adults 46.6 years. 
The main off-label used agent was anakinra, used at least once for 185 patients, with 
canakinumab used for 25 patients. The main off-label diseases treated with anakinra were AOSD 
(35 patients), gout (28 patients), SJIA (26 patients), CAPS (21 patients), familial Mediterranean 
fever (FMF) (13 patients), mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) (10 patients), synovitis, acne, 
pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome (9 patients), and Schnitzler’s syndrome (7 
patients). It should be noted that at the time of the survey CAPS, FMF and Still’s disease 
including SJIA and AOSD were not yet approved indications, and were therefore included in the 
survey. The survey was published by Rossi-Semerano et al. 2015 (91). 
Swedish Rheumatology Quality Registers 
Sobi has access to the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Registers (SRQ). SRQ comprises a 
cooperation between clinical registers in Swedish rheumatology participating in a national

program for continuous follow up of patients for drug surveillance, clinical trials, health 
economics, clinical research, and health care quality improvement. SRQ works together with 
research-driven pharmaceutical companies to improve patient health. The register includes only 
adult patients. Table 24 shows the number of ongoing Kineret treatments outside of the approved 
label in Sweden by indication from 2016 up to February 2021. Indications with fewer than 2 
ongoing treatments during 2021 are not included in the table. Overall, there is a slight increased 
use of anakinra over time. The most common indication is gout, systemic inflammatory disease 
NUD and polyarthritis..

Part II: Module SVI - Additional EU requirements for the safety 
specification 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
Potential for misuse of Kineret for illegal purposes is considered low. 
Potential for transmission of infectious agents 
Anakinra is produced in E. coli cells. Therefore there is no significant risk of contamination with 
adventitious agents such as mammalian viruses or mycoplasma. Potential nonviral adventitious 
agents such as contaminating bacteria, fungi and TSE are controlled at several levels. The 
introduction of such agents is prevented or minimized by controls on starting materials, 
including raw materials, excipients and cell source. 
There are no animal derived materials used in the fermentation or purification of the active 
substance anakinra. 
The manufacturing process and facility are designed to prevent contamination during production 
of anakinra drug substance. Manufacturing takes place on a campaign basis in suites which are, 
during production, dedicated to the production of anakinra. Validation of the cleaning procedures 
confirms that cleaning is effective. 
In-process controls ensure that purity requirements are met. Release testing of drug substance 
and drug product assures purity and quality of the product.

The following event classified as important potential risk are to be added to the list of safety 
concerns: 
-  Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) 
Based on a request from PRAC in July 2020, an investigation of DRESS as an adverse event was 
performed during the interval. The request was triggered by a publication by Dr Saper et al. (92). 
The investigation included review of the Sobi global safety database, mechanistic studies, 
clinical studies and the literature, as well as contacts with Dr Saper. Sobi considers that a causal 
relationship has not been established between anakinra and DRESS. However, a warning was 
added under Section 4.4 in the SmPC and in the Core Data Sheet, describing that DRESS has 
been reported in patients treated with IL-1 inhibitors, predominantly in pediatric patients with 
Still’s disease. In addition, DRESS is proposed to be added as an important potential risk in the 
RMP. 
SVII.3 Details of important identified risks, important potential risks, and missing 
information 
No clinically relevant differences have been identified regarding important identified and 
potential risks between RA, CAPS, FMF, Still’s disease and COVID-19 patients in pediatric and 
adult patients, with the exception of the potential risks of Pulmonary events and DRESS, which 
are relevant predominantly for Still’s disease. Patients with DIRA may have an increased risk of 
allergic reactions compared to other indications, especially in the first few weeks after 
commencing treatment. 
All risks are presented separately for RA and CAPS patients. If not stated otherwise, the data 
presented for RA and CAPS are relevant also for Still’s disease, FMF and COVID-19 disease, 
both in pediatric and adult patients. Sobi sponsored studies in unapproved indications have not 
indicated additional risks or changed the assessment of the identified and potential risks with 
anakinra.  
Patients with RA 
Unless stated otherwise, all analyses in the tables below regarding seriousness/outcomes and 
frequency of the identified and potential risks have been performed on the major placebo-
controlled, randomized studies in the RA safety pool i.e., as the percentage of the total number of 
patients in the RA safety pool. 
Outcome of adverse events have in all studies in the RA safety pool been collected as ‘AE 
continuing or not continuing at final visit/end of study’. AEs in the RA safety pool are coded in 
the WHO-ART system. 
Severity and nature of risk have been presented as the percentage of the total number of events in 
the RA safety pool. The studies included in the safety pool are described in Section SIII.2. 
Post-marketing data have also been taken into consideration when evaluating the risks. 
Patients with CAPS 
Unless stated otherwise, all analyses in the tables below regarding seriousness/outcomes and 
frequency of the identified and potential risks are based on study 03-AR-0298. It should be noted 
that the duration of study 03-AR-0298 was up to 5 years, meaning that the time of exposure for 
Page 45 of 124 
 
Sobi 
Risk management plan version 6.2 
Kineret 
each CAPS patient is longer than for each RA patient in the safety pool, and therefore it is 
expected that each CAPS patient should have a higher number of AEs per patient. 
Post-marketing data have also been taken into consideration when evaluating the risks. 
Patients with Still’s disease 
There are 21 patients with Still’s disease treated with anakinra in 2 MAH-sponsored clinical 
studies (15 patients in study 990758/990779 and 6 patients in study Sobi.ANAKIN-301). Unless 
stated otherwise, the safety data presented for RA and CAPS are relevant also for patients with 
Still’s disease. 
Published studies and case reports as well as other post-marketing data have also been taken into 
consideration when evaluating the risks. 
Patients with FMF 
There is no MAH-sponsored clinical study in FMF patients. In a published double-blind placebo 
controlled study (87) in 25 patients with FMF there are 12 patients treated with anakinra. 
Therefore, it is not appropriate to calculate separate specific frequencies for the majority of 
important identified and potential risks for patients with FMF. Unless stated otherwise, the safety 
data presented for RA and CAPS are relevant also for patients with FMF. 
Patients with COVID-19 
There is one MAH sponsored clinical study in COVID-19 patients which was stopped early due 
to inability to enroll patients with evolving clinical treatment regimen for COVID-19 disease. 
This study had very limited exposure. The Investigator Sponsored Study SAVE-MORE is a 
double blind placebo controlled study in patients with COVID-19, 405 of which were treated 
with anakinra. Safety data review did not identify any new risks for anakinra with the use in 
COVID-19 patients.  
Unless stated otherwise, the safety data presented for RA and CAPS are relevant also for patients 
with COVID-19. 
SVII.3.1. Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks 
Identified risk: Injection site reactions (ISRs) 
Identified risk: Injection site reactions (ISRs) 
Potential mechanisms 
The combination of vehicle constituents and a high protein concentration in the 
syringe may give rise to mast cell reaction degranulation, causing acute ISRs. 
Delayed ISRs may be caused by an immune-mediated local reaction (93). Placebo 
solutions in clinical studies have contained all excipients but no anakinra.

Kineret 
Completed clinical studies, literature review, and post-marketing surveillance. Due 
to the low number of patients, Still’s disease , FMF and COVID-19 are not included 
in the frequency tabulation below. 
In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in RA patients, ISRs were the most 
common and consistently treatment-related reported adverse reactions to Kineret. 
ISRs are common in post-marketing reports in RA patients. The frequency of ISRs 
in CAPS patients in study 03-AR-0298 was similar to placebo patients in RA studies 
and there were no permanent or temporary withdrawals of Kineret due to ISRs in 
CAPS patients.  
In 15 patients with SJIA, included in study 990758/990779, ISRs were the most 
common AEs. One patient discontinued on day 1 of the study 990758 open-label 
phase due to ISRs. In 12 patients with Still’s disease included in study 
Sobi.ANAKIN-301, ISRs were reported in both the anakinra (4 ISRs in 6 patients) 
and the placebo (3 ISRs in 6 patients) groups. 
In COVID-19 patients in the investigator-sponsored study SAVE-MORE there were 
no ISRs in the placebo group and 2 ISRs in the anakinra group. ISRs were reported 
in lower frequency compared to RA studies.

Alternating the injection site is recommended to avoid discomfort at the site of 
injection. Cooling of the injection site, warming the injection liquid, use of cold 
packs (before and after the injection), and use of topical corticosteroids and/or 
antihistamines before or after the injection can alleviate the signs and symptoms of 
injection site reactions (93). 
ISRs typically appear within 2 weeks’ therapy and disappear within 4-6 weeks. ISRs 
cause pain to the patient, which in a small proportion of patients may lead to 
discontinuation of treatment. Further characterization of ISRs in the post-marketing 
setting is not expected to change the positive benefit-risk balance of Kineret. 
ISRs can potentially affect 63% to 67% of patients exposed to Kineret except in 
patients with CAPS where the impact is estimated to be less (23 %, 95 % CI [10.6 
%, 35.9 %]). 
Identified risk: Immunogenicity 
Identified risk: Immunogenicity 
Potential mechanisms 
Evidence sources and 
strength of evidence 
Immunological reaction to exogenous protein. Antibodies are known to occur during 
treatment with biological therapeutics, including anakinra. 
Completed clinical studies, literature review, and post-marketing surveillance. The 
immunogenicity of anakinra has been evaluated in all studies in the safety pool. Many 
factors influence immunogenicity and antibody detection, i.e., dosing, detection method, 
duration of treatment, and co-administration of immunosuppressives. These are all factors 
that vary between studies in the RA safety pool, and, consequently, immunogenicity 
between the studies varies significantly. The highest incidence of antibodies was found in 
studies 990757 and 990145. Frequency data for this risk are based on the 1901 Kineret-
treated and 680 placebo-treated patients in studies 990757 and 990145, who were tested for

Kineret 
anti-anakinra antibodies during the full study periods (including open label follow up for 
up to 3 years). The frequency of antibodies found describes patients positive for anti-
anakinra antibodies on at least one time point during the studies. Data for patients with 
CAPS (study 03-AR-0298), patients with SJIA (study 990758/990779) and patients with 
Still’s disease (SJIA and AOSD, study Sobi.ANAKIN-301) are also presented. There are 
no studies evaluating immunogenicity in FMF patients, however, due to the similarities of 
the characteristics of the disease to the other periodic fever syndromes, there are no 
indications that patients with FMF would react differently than patients with above 
mentioned indications. 
In COVID-19 in the SAVE-MORE study anti-drug antibodies were not investigated. 
RA patients (blinded placebo-controlled, randomized studies) 
Anakinra anti-drug antibodies 1113/1901 patients (58 %, 95 % CI [56 %, 61 %]). Placebo 
2/680 patients (0 %, 95 % CI [0 %, 1 %]).  
Neutralizing antibodies: Kineret 49/1901 patients (3 %, 95 % CI [2 %, 3 %]). No 
neutralizing antibodies were detected with placebo. 
CAPS patients 
In Study 03-AR-0298, 33 out of 40 patients (82.5 %, 95 % CI [71 %, 94 %]) developed 
anakinra anti-drug antibodies at least once during the study. No test for neutralizing 
antibodies was performed. 
Still’s disease patients 
In 11 SJIA patients, tested for anti-anakinra antibodies in study 990758/990779, 9 (82 %) 
tested positive for non-neutralizing antibodies. No SJIA patient tested positive for 
neutralizing antibodies. All 6 anakinra patients in study Sobi.ANAKIN-301 developed anti-
anakinra antibodies during the study. No neutralizing antibodies were detected in any of 
these patients. 
No serious reactions have occurred. 
Post marketing data 
Post marketing data are limited but consistent with clinical study data. 
Possible risk for all protein therapeutics. Serum samples were analyzed for anti-anakinra 
antibodies. The highest number of positive anti-anakinra antibody tests in RA patients was 
found in the 2 long-term safety studies 990145 and 990757. No correlation between 
antibody development and clinical response or AE frequency and severity was observed. 
One patient on placebo in each study was positive for anti-anakinra antibodies. 
In the CAPS study, development of anti-anakinra antibodies was not associated with any 
clinically significant effects on pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety. 
Placebo data as quoted above are indicative of the background risk. 
Risk groups or risk factors have not been identified. 
Not applicable 
May potentially cause decreased efficacy, allergic/anaphylactic reactions or ISRs without 
effecting the positive benefit-risk balance for Kineret. Further characterization of 
immunogenicity in the post-marketing setting is not expected to significantly change the 
positive benefit-risk balance. An analysis concluded that while antibodies are likely to 
occur in CAPS patients treated with anakinra, evidence shows that chronic daily 
subcutaneous treatment with anakinra is safe and effective regardless of the development 
and presence of ADA (94). 
The occurrence of neutralizing antibodies at least once in every three-year treatment period 
may occur in 2% to 3% of patients exposed to Kineret. Antibodies may also cause

For a small number of patients with asthma included in RA studies, the incidence of 
serious infections was higher in Kineret-treated patients. 
In studies, concurrent administration of Kineret and etanercept in RA patients has 
been associated with an increased risk of serious infections. It is reasonable to 
assume that this interaction is valid not just for etanercept but for the whole class of 
TNFα-antagonists. 
No specific risk group or risk factor among patients with CAPS, FMF or Still’s 
disease has been identified. It is reasonable to assume that the results in RA studies 
presented above apply also to CAPS, FMF and Still’s patients. 
The SmPC states that physicians should exercise caution when administering Kineret 
to patients with a history of recurring infections or with underlying conditions which 
may predispose for infections. 
In the Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use, it is stated that for a 
small number of patients with asthma the incidence of serious infections was higher 
in Kineret-treated patients. It is also stated that concurrent administration of Kineret 
and etanercept has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and 
that the concurrent administration of etanercept or other TNFα-antagonists is not 
recommended.  
Recognition of symptoms associated with infections.  
May contribute to increased morbidity and hospital stays. Further characterization of 
serious infections in the post-marketing setting is not expected to change the positive

In double-blind placebo-controlled studies in RA patients the confidence interval for 
the estimated mean incidence of serious infections of 2 % (95 % CI [1 %, 2 %]) is 
overlapping the confidence interval for the incidence in placebo-treated patients, 1 % 
(95 % CI [0 %, 2 %] and correspond to 0.06 to 0.08 serious infections per patient 
year exposed to Kineret.

Potential mechanisms 
Evidence sources and 
strength of evidence 
IL-1 acts on the bone marrow to increase mobilization of granulocyte progenitors 
and mature neutrophils, resulting in peripheral neutrophilia. These effects are Il-1 
receptor mediated and thus counteracted by IL-1Ra and anakinra. This, in 
combination with other mechanisms resulting in an inhibitory effect of IL-1 induced 
inflammatory pathways by anakinra, may in part explain a decrease in neutrophil 
count seen in some patients. 
Completed clinical studies, literature review, and post-marketing surveillance. Due 
to the low number of patients, Still’s disease and FMF are not included in the 
frequency tabulation below. In study 990758/990779, transient neutropenia occurred 
in one SJIA patient (absolute neutrophil count 0.91 x 109/L); the count recovered to 
above 1.0 x 109/L by the next study visit during continued Kineret treatment and was 
not associated with any clinical sequelae. No patients developed neutropenia 
(<1.5x109/L) in study Sobi.ANAKIN-301. 
In the published double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with 
FMF (87) there were no events of neutropenia reported. 
In COVID-19 patients in the SAVE-MORE study neutropenia was reported at a 
higher rate in patients treated with anakinra compared to the subjects treated with 
placebo, however at a similar rate as in RA studies.

No other specific factors or groups of RA patients have been identified. 
In Felty’s syndrome, a severe variant of RA developing in less than 1 % of RA

Potential mechanisms 
Drug-induced allergic hypersensitivity. 
Completed clinical studies, literature review, and post-marketing surveillance. Due 
to the low number of patients, Still’s disease and FMF are not included in the 
frequency tabulation below. In study 990758/990779, 3 patients (20.0 %) with SJIA, 
experienced AEs indicating allergic reactions. One event was, however, specifically 
attributed to amethocaine gel. In study Sobi.ANAKIN-301 no allergic reactions were 
reported however there was one case of urticaria, which was mild and assessed as 
not related to anakinra treatment by the investigator. 
Evidence sources and 
strength of evidence 
In the published double-blind study in patients with FMF (87) there was no allergic 
reaction reported.

Seriousness/outcomes 
In a signal evaluation performed 2020 that included both a long-term natural history 
study 17-I-0016 and post marketing reports, 4 out of 19 Kineret-treated patients with 
Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) had allergic reactions. 3 of 
the 4 case reports were serious. 
In COVID-19 patients in the SAVE-MORE study no hypersensitivity reaction were 
considered related to anakinra

Placebo data as quoted above are indicative of the background risk. 
Patients with a history of allergic reactions to any of the excipients of Kineret. 
DIRA patients may have an increased risk of allergic reactions, particularly in the 
first few weeks due to lack of pre-existing immune tolerance to the protein. 
Recognition of patients with a history of allergic reactions to any of the excipients of 
Kineret, including E. coli derived proteins.  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, any of the excipients or to E. coli-derived 
proteins is a contraindication for Kineret treatment. 
DIRA patients should be closely monitored in the first few weeks after starting 
Kineret treatment. 
Testing for anti-anakinra antibodies is not required. Allergic reactions are 
uncommon and the vast majority are non-serious. 
Kineret may contribute to development of allergic reactions. Further characterization 
in the post-marketing setting is not expected to change the positive benefit-risk 
balance of Kineret. 
DIRA is an ultra-rare, mostly fatal disease and the possibility of an increased risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions compared to other indications does not change the positive 
benefit-risk balance in this indication. 
The difference between Kineret-treated and placebo-treated patients is 
approximately 3 % in the frequency of all types of allergic conditions (including e.g. 
seasonal allergy and hay fever). 
DIRA is an ultra-rare disease and therefore the possibility of increased risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions in this indication has no potential impact on public health.

Evidence sources 
and strength of

Completed clinical studies, literature review, and post-marketing surveillance. 
Due to the low number of patients, Still’s disease and FMF are not included in the frequency 
tabulation below. In the SJIA/Still’s study 990758/990779 there was one serious hepatitis 
due to cytomegalovirus infection. In addition, there were 3 increases of liver tests in one 
patient. The tests normalized during continued Kineret treatment. No elevations of liver 
enzymes were observed during the Sobi.ANAKIN-301 study in Still’s disease and no 
hepatic events were reported. 
In the published double-blind study in patients with FMF (87) there was no hepatic event

Placebo data as quoted above are indicative of the background risk for RA and CAPS. 
In Still’s disease, increases in liver enzymes are common during disease flares. In addition, 
patients with Still’s disease can have subclinical MAS, which can cause increases in liver

populations have been identified. As stated above, patients with Still’s disease have an 
increased risk for hepatic events. 
Thorough medical history and early recognition of symptoms helps minimize morbidity and 
mortality. Information about the occurrence of hepatic events, mainly in patients with Still’s 
disease or in patients with predisposing factors, e.g., history of transaminase elevations 
before start of Kineret treatment, is included in the SmPC. 
May contribute to development of hepatic disorders. Further characterization in the post-
marketing setting is not expected to change the positive benefit-risk balance of Kineret. 
There is no difference in the incidence of hepatic events in Kineret vs. placebo-treated 
patients, 1 %, 95 % CI [0 %, 1 %] vs. 1 %, 95 % CI [1 %, 2 %], respectively. Patients with 
Still’s disease, however, have an increased intrinsic risk for hepatic events.

Potential risk: Malignancies 
Potential mechanisms 
Interference with immune system 
Completed clinical studies, literature review, post-marketing surveillance reports, and 
registries: Rheumatism Biologics register in the UK (BSRBR), in Germany (RABBIT), 
and in Sweden (ARTIS). 
No overall increased frequency of malignancies in Kineret-treated patients has been 
observed in clinical studies in RA, neither in short-term studies nor in studies with 
extended patient exposure to Kineret. In CAPS study 03-AR-0298, there were no 
adverse reactions denoting malignancies. 
This is true also for the patients with SJIA included in study 990758/990779 and the 
patients with FMF included in the published double-blind study (87). In the 
Sobi.ANAKIN-301 study in patients with Still’s disease, there were no malignancies 
reported in the anakinra group.  
In the SAVE-MORE study COVID-19 patients were treated for a duration ≤ 10 days, 
one case of unspecified lung tumor was reported  during study follow up. 
Due to the immunosuppressive properties of Kineret there is, however, a theoretical risk 
that Kineret could increase the frequency of malignancies. 
For the potential risk Malignancies an extended version of the safety pool has been used 
to compare the incidence of malignancies in Kineret-treated RA patients to placebo over 
12 months. In addition, long time follow-up (LTFU) data of up to 36 months of Kineret 
exposure has been obtained from the extended safety pool. The extended safety pool 
contains all studies in the safety pool and their respective follow up studies. Studies 
990145 (Part A and B), 990757 (Part A and B), 960182, 960180 with LTFU 960181, 
0560 with LTFU 564 and 564E1 are included. 
The analysis of the extended safety pool shows that short-term exposure (up to 12 
months) to Kineret does not appear to result in an increased risk of developing 
malignancies compared to placebo.  
Long-term exposure (up to 36 months) does not appear to increase the frequency of 
malignancies expressed as events/100 patient years.

There are sporadic case reports in the post-marketing safety database describing 
medication errors including reuse of syringe. 
Severity is not captured in post-marketing surveillance reports. 
Kineret is administered from a graduated prefilled syringe that contains 100 mg 
and are intended for single use. The graduated syringe has a label to allow for 
single-use injections of smaller and varying doses (20–100 mg) in patients with 
CAPS, FMF, and Still’s disease.  
In post-marketing experience there are very few reports describing medication 
errors. 
Patients with CAPS, FMF and Still’s disease who use Kineret doses other than 
100 mg. 
Careful design of product presentation and instructions for use.  
A usability study has been conducted to verify the users’ ability to correctly and 
safely use the graduated Kineret syringe. The study demonstrated that the Kineret 
graduated syringe can be handled safely and effectively with the help of the 
instructions for use.   
Healthcare providers will instruct patients on correct injection procedures and 
disposal of syringes.  
Reuse of a syringe may cause infections. Most infections will likely be mild and 
local at the injection site. There is a potential risk for serious infections, mainly 
bacteremia and sepsis. Further characterization in the post-marketing setting is not 
expected to change the positive benefit-risk balance of Kineret. 
Potential public health impact 
of safety concern 
The public health impact is low. 
Potential risk: Pulmonary events (Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, 
alveolar proteinosis) 
Events of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and pulmonary hypertension 
(including pulmonary arterial hypertension) have been reported, mainly in pediatric patients with 
Still’s disease treated with IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors, including anakinra. A causal relationship 
between anakinra and pulmonary events has not been established. 
Pulmonary events are not considered a potential risk in either the RA, CAPS FMF or COVID-19 
populations.  
Potential risk: Pulmonary events (Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, alveolar proteinosis)

had complications with interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension and 
alveolar proteinosis. 
There were no events of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis or

Fatal cases have been reported. 
Initial symptoms may be mild however progressively become worse. In a published 
cohort of 25 patients 17 (68%) died at a mean of 10.2 months from the diagnosis of 
pulmonary complications (39). These events have mainly been seen in patients 
with Still’s disease, suggesting important relationship to components of the 
underlying disease. More information is needed to understand the nature of the 
risk.  
Events of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and pulmonary 
hypertension have been reported mainly in pediatric patients with Still’s disease 
treated with IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors, including anakinra. Patients with trisomy 21 
seem to be overrepresented: in a cohort of 61 pediatric patients with Still's disease 
and lung complications 6 patients (10%) had trisomy 21 (92, 95-97). 
There have been reports of pulmonary complications in SJIA patients before the 
introduction of IL-1-blocking agents. Athreya et al. 1980 (40) presented 8/191 
children with JRA who had involvement of the lung or pleura for more than 6 
weeks, whereof 6 with SJIA. 4 patients had persisting lung disease, in 2 cases 
described as interstitial. The article’s literature review found 3 case reports on 
patients with JRA that died due to their lung disease, autopsy showed interstitial 
fibrosis in 2/3. 
Post-marketing data 
There have been published and spontaneous case reports of pulmonary 
complications, mainly in pediatric patients with Still’s disease. 
Pediatric patients, especially with trisomy 21, with Still’s disease treated with IL-6 
and IL-1 inhibitors, including anakinra. 
In one published case series the cohort of Still’s disease patients that developed 
pulmonary events were more likely to have been exposed to IL-1 inhibitors, 
tocilizumab, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobin, cyclosporine, or 
cyclophosphamide. 15/25 patients (60%) had MAS at pulmonary diagnosis (39). In 
a different case series (92, 95) 18 of 61 patients (30%) had overt or subclinical 
MAS at onset of pulmonary events. 
RA has also been associated with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) with a lifetime 
risk of developing ILD of 7.7% for RA patients vs. 0.9% for subjects without RA 
(17). 
Unknown. Respiratory symptoms should trigger a pulmonary workup. Prophylaxis 
for pneumocystis conferred a distinct survival benefit, despite absence of 
pneumocystis by direct visualization  (92, 95). 
Further characterization subsequent to data searches and during post-marketing 
surveillance may inform the benefit-risk balance for treatment of Still’s disease. 
The public health impact cannot currently be quantified.

Potential risk: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) 
Potential mechanisms 
Evidence sources and 
strength of evidence 
No mechanism has been established. 
Post-marketing surveillance case reports and published reports describe DRESS in 
patients treated with IL-1 inhibitors, predominantly in pediatric patients with Still’s 
disease (92). However, there are significant confounders including failure to fully 
investigate for and exclude the most common causes of eosinophilia in children, 
such as helminth infections. Additionally, in the main publication the diagnosis of 
DRESS in cases was made retrospectively (92, 98). It has also been suggested that 
certain HLA types are of higher risk of developing DRESS (99)). 
There have been no cases of DRESS in the clinical studies in RA, CAPS (study 03-
AR-0298), JIA/SJIA study (990758/990779), in the study in Still’s disease 
(Sobi.ANAKIN-301) or in the published double-blind study in patients with FMF

Part III: Pharmacovigilance Plan 
III.1  Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection: 
Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for the following important risks: 
• 
• 
Important identified risks: 
  Hepatic disorders 
  Neutropenia 
  Serious infections 
Important potential risks: 
  Pulmonary events (Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, alveolar 
proteinosis) 
  Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) 
Gathering of specific adverse event report information, including batch numbers, pertaining to a 
safety concern of special interest is pertinent. The targeted questionnaire is a method of follow-
up used to collect structured data on a safety concern. Cumulative review of reports collected in 
this manner allows for further characterization of the nature of the risk and is used during the 
review process when considering the relationship between the drug and a safety concern. 
Examples of questionnaires are available in Annex 4 (Part VII: Annexes).  
Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities  
The following important risks are monitored as Target medical events (TMEs): 
• 
• 
Important identified risks: 
  Serious infections 
  Neutropenia 
  Allergic reactions  
  Hepatic disorders  
Important potential risks: 
  Malignancies 
  Medication error/reuse of used syringe 
  Pulmonary events (Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, alveolar 
proteinosis) 
  Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) 
Target medical events are certain AEs that are closely monitored for evidence of a possible 
association between Kineret and the events, regardless of the indication for Kineret treatment. 
TMEs are established as a result of Sobi’s own identification of potential safety signals for which 
a reasonable causal association has not yet been established, and also for post-marketing 
commitments or regulatory agency requests. Periodic assessment of these events and emerging

Part V: Risk minimization measures (including evaluation of the 
effectiveness of risk minimization activities) 
Risk Minimization Plan  
Risk minimization activities proposed in this RMP are risk communications through routine risk 
minimization measures in the post-marketing setting. These measures are considered sufficient 
for handling safety concerns in all indications. For some of the risks, there are additional 
activities (educational materials).

glucocorticoids and antihistamines after the injection. 
Routine risk communication: 
SmPC section 5.1 refers to section 4.8 where the risk is described. 
Routine risk communication: 
Information in SmPC section 4.8 and the following information in 
section 4.4: Kineret treatment should not be initiated in patients with 
active infections. Kineret treatment should be discontinued in RA 
patients if a serious infection develops. In Kineret treated CAPS or 
FMF patients, there is a risk for disease flares when discontinuing 
Kineret treatment. With careful monitoring, Kineret treatment can be 
continued also during a serious infection. Available data is limited 
regarding whether Kineret can be continued during serious infections 
in patients with Still’s disease. If Kineret treatment is continued during 
serious infections to reduce the risk for a disease flare, careful 
monitoring is required.  
Physicians should exercise caution when administering Kineret to 
patients with a history of recurring infections or with underlying 
conditions which may predispose them to infections. 
Patients should be screened for latent tuberculosis prior to initiating 
Kineret. The available medical guidelines should be taken into account. 
Screening for viral hepatitis should also be performed in accordance 
with published guidelines before starting therapy with Kineret. 
Kineret treatment can be continued during a serious infection in 
patients with COVID-19.

Part VI: Summary of activities in the risk management plan by product 
Summary of risk management plan for Kineret 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Kineret. The RMP details important 
risks of Kineret, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Kineret's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Kineret's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Kineret should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Kineret should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Kineret's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Kineret is a medicine that is used to treat: 
•  Rheumatoid Arthritis: Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (an immune system 
disease causing inflammation of the joints) in adults. It is used in combination with 
methotrexate (a medicine used to reduce inflammation) in patients who have not 
responded adequately to methotrexate alone 
•  Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). CAPS are a group of diseases where 
patients have a defect in the gene that produces a protein called cryopyrin. This leads to 
inflammation in many parts of the body, with symptoms such as fever, rash, joint pain 
and tiredness. Severe disabilities such as deafness and loss of vision may also occur; 
•  Still’s disease, a rare disease causing inflammation of joints as well as rash and fever. 
•  Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a hereditary periodic fever. Kineret should be given 
in combination with colchicine, if appropriate. 
•  COVID-19, Kineret is used to treat the hyperinflammation (stronger than the usual 
inflammation) associated with the disease in adults (age 18 years and over) who have 
pneumonia, need extra oxygen and are at risk of lung failure. 
For CAPS, Still’s disease and FMF, Kineret is used in patients from 8 months of age and 
weighing at least 10 kg (see SmPC for the full indication). 
Further information about the evaluation of Kineret’s benefits can be found in Kineret’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage.

II.  Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or 
further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Kineret, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Kineret's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Kineret is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Kineret are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Kineret. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Injection site reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies in patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) indicate that ISRs can potentially affect 63% to 
67% of patients exposed to Kineret except in patients with CAPS where 
the impact is estimated to be less (23 %, 95 % CI [10.6 %, 35.9 %]). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk groups have been identified. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures:

treating patients with CAPS, FMF and Still’s disease, and for patients. 
Important identified risk: Immunogenicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
In double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies anti-drug antibodies to 
Kineret have been detected however no serious reactions have occurred.

Important identified risk: Serious infections 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In double-blind placebo-controlled studies in RA patients the confidence 
interval for the estimated mean incidence of serious infections of 2 % (95 
% CI [1 %, 2 %]) is overlapping the confidence interval for the incidence 
in placebo-treated patients, 1 % (95 % CI [0 %, 2 %] and correspond to 
0.06 to 0.08 serious infections per patient year exposed to Kineret. 
For a small number of patients with asthma included in RA studies, the 
incidence of serious infections was higher in Kineret-treated patients. 
In studies, concurrent administration of Kineret and etanercept in RA 
patients has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections. It 
is reasonable to assume that this interaction is valid not just for etanercept 
but for the whole class of TNFα-antagonists. 
No specific risk group or risk factor among patients with CAPS or Still’s 
disease has been identified. It is reasonable to assume that the results in 
RA studies presented above apply also to CAPS, FMF and Still’s patients. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8 
Important identified risk: Neutropenia 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
In double-blind placebo-controlled studies the estimated incidence of 
neutropenia is 1 % with the 95 % CI [1 %, 2 %] 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In RA patients, concurrent administration of Kineret and etanercept has 
been associated with an increased risk of decreases in neutrophil count. It 
is reasonable to assume that this interaction is valid not just for etanercept 
but for the whole class of TNFα-antagonists. 
No other specific factors or groups of RA patients have been identified. 
In Felty’s syndrome, a severe variant of RA developing in less than 1 % of 
RA patients, neutropenia is the most common and important feature. 
No specific risk group or risk factor among patients with CAPS, FMF or 
Still’s disease has been identified. It is reasonable to assume that the 
results in RA studies presented above apply also to CAPS, FMF and Still’s 
patients. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 
Important identified risk: Allergic reactions 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
In double-blind placebo-controlled studies in RA patients Kineret-treated 
patients had an approximately 3 % higher incidence of all types of allergic 
conditions (including e.g. seasonal allergy and hay fever). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients with a history of allergic reactions to any of the excipients of 
Kineret. 
Patients with DIRA may have an increased risk of allergic reactions, 
particularly in the first few weeks after starting Kineret treatment.

Risk factors and risk groups 
The frequency in RA patients for both Kineret and placebo was similar 
(1%). In CAPS patients the frequency for Kineret was 12% (5 out of 43 
patients during up to 5 years of exposure).  
During postmarketing use hepatic events, considered related to Kineret 
treatment, have been seen, mainly in patients with a history of liver events 
and in patients with Still's disease. 
Patients with history of liver disease or of transaminase elevations before 
start of Kineret treatment. No other specific factors or groups of patients 
within the RA, CAPS and FMF populations have been identified. Patients 
with Still’s disease have an increased risk for hepatic events.

Important potential risk: Malignancies 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
No overall increased frequency of malignancies in Kineret-treated patients 
has been observed in clinical studies in RA, neither in short-term studies 
nor in studies with extended patient exposure to Kineret. In CAPS study 
03-AR-0298, there were no adverse reactions denoting malignancies. 
This is true also for the patients with SJIA included in study 
990758/990779 and the patients with FMF included in the published 
double-blind study (87). In the Sobi.ANAKIN-301 study in patients with 
Still’s disease, there were no malignancies reported in the anakinra 
group.Due to the immunosuppressive properties of Kineret there is, 
however, a theoretical risk that Kineret could increase the frequency of 
malignancies. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No specific factors or groups of patients within the RA or CAPS 
populations have been identified.

Important potential risk: Medication errors including reuse of syringe 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
There are sporadic case reports in the post-marketing safety database 
describing medication errors including reuse of syringe

Additional risk minimization measures 
Guides are employed to inform healthcare providers of their obligation to 
instruct patients with CAPS, FMF and Still’s disease on correct injection 
procedures and disposal of used syringes and supplies, along with 
information material to patients.

Important potential risk: Pulmonary events (Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, alveolar 
proteinosis) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Post-marketing surveillance case reports and published reports of patients 
with Still's disease treated with IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors, including 
anakinra, who have had complications with interstitial lung disease, 
pulmonary hypertension and alveolar proteinosis. 
There were no events of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary alveolar 
proteinosis or pulmonary hypertension in SJIA patients in study 
990758/990779 or in patients with Still’s disease in study Sobi.ANAKIN-
301. 
Pediatric patients, especially with trisomy 21, with Still’s disease treated 
with IL-6 and IL-1 inhibitors, including anakinra. 
In one published case series the cohort of Still’s disease patients that 
developed pulmonary events were more likely to have been exposed to 
IL-1 inhibitors, tocilizumab, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobin, 
cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide. 15/25 patients (60%) had MAS at 
pulmonary diagnosis (39). In a different case series (92, 95) 18 of 61 
patients (30%) had overt or subclinical MAS at onset of pulmonary events. 
RA has also been associated with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) with a 
lifetime risk of developing ILD of 7.7% for RA patients vs. 0.9% for 
subjects without RA (17).

SmPC section 4.4 
Important potential risk: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Post-marketing surveillance case reports and published reports describe 
DRESS in patients treated with IL-1 inhibitors, predominantly in pediatric 
patients with Still’s disease (92). 
There have been no cases of DRESS in the clinical studies in RA, CAPS 
(study 03-AR-0298), JIA/SJIA study (990758/990779), in the study in 
Still’s disease (Sobi.ANAKIN-301) or in the published double-blind study 
in patients with FMF (87). 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Pediatric patients with Still’s disease.

KINERET INJECTION GUIDES FOR CAPS, FMF AND STILL’s DISEASE 
Description 
  Printed guides for patients and health care professionals (HCPs) to demonstrate the steps 
required to safely administer Kineret. 
  The guides will be distributed to all centers treating patients with CAPS, FMF and Still’s 
disease that Sobi has identified. 
  The patient guides are used by the patients when injecting Kineret. They will also be used by 
health care professionals when instructing the patients on the safe and proper use of Kineret. 
  The guides emphasize that patients or caregivers should not be allowed to administer Kineret 
until the patient or caregiver has demonstrated a thorough understanding of procedures and 
an ability to inject the product correctly with the graduated prefilled syringe.

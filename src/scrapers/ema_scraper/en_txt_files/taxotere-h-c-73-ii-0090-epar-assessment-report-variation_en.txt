1.  Scientific discussion  
1.1.  Introduction 
Taxotere 20 and 80 mg concentrate and solvent for solution for infusion (INN: docetaxel) were initially 
granted  Marketing  Authorisations  (MAs)  under  exceptional  circumstances  for  a  restricted  indication 
(second  line  monotherapeutic  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  breast  cancer  after  anthracycline 
failure)  in  the  EU  in  1995.  Docetaxel  is  a  semisynthetic  and  important  taxane  which  displays  its 
cytotoxic/antineoplastic  activity  by  promoting  the  assembly  of  free  tubulin  into  stable  microtubles 
thereby inhibiting mitosis. 
On  30  November  2009  the  Commission  Decision  for  the  additional  strengths  of  20 mg/1ml  and 
80 mg/4ml  (concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion)  was  issued  and  on  27  April  2010  the  Commission 
Decision  was  issued  for  a  new  presentation  of  160  mg/8  ml  of  Taxotere  concentrate  for  solution  for 
infusion (one vial formulation). 
Meanwhile, after granting full MA and several amendments of the indication, the medicinal product is 
indicated for: 
Breast cancer 
-  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  patients  with 
operable node- positive breast cancer. 
-  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
breast cancer who have not previously received cytotoxic therapy for this condition. 
- in monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after 
failure  of  cytotoxic  therapy.  Previous  chemotherapy  should  have  included  an  anthracycline  or  an 
alkylating agent. 
-  in  combination  with  trastuzumab  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with metastatic  breast  cancer  whose 
tumours  overexpress  HER2  and  who  previously  have  not  received  chemotherapy  for  metastatic 
disease. 
-  in  combination  with  capecitabine  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic 
breast  cancer  after  failure  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy.  Previous  therapy  should  have  included  an 
anthracycline. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
- in monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy. 
-  in  combination  with  cisplatin  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  unresectable,  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for 
this condition. 
Prostate cancer 
- in combination with prednisone or prednisolone for the treatment of patients with hormone refractory 
metastatic prostate cancer. 
Gastric adenocarcinoma 
- in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of patients with metastatic gastric 
adenocarcinoma, including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction, who have not received 
prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
Head and neck cancer 
-in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is indicated for the induction treatment of patients with 
locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 
The  scope  of  this  variation  application  is  an  extension  of  the  breast  cancer  adjuvant  treatment 
indication. The MAH initially proposed the new indication as follows: 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 2
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
“TAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with operable node-negative breast cancer (with one or more high risk factors 
[see section 5.1]).” 
This  application  is  based  on  the  results  of  The  Grupo  Espanol  de  Investigacion  en  Cancer  de 
Mama (GEICAM) 9805 phase  III  study  (TAX.ES1.301).  Study  GEICAM 9805 (TAX.ES1.301)  compared: 
TAC  (docetaxel  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide)  versus  FAC  (5-fluorouracil  in 
combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide)  as  a  6-cycle  adjuvant  treatment  of  high  risk 
operable breast cancer patients with negative axillary lymph nodes. 
Further to the assessment by CHMP the following final indication has been agreed: 
“TAXOTERE in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is indicated for the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with: 
• 
operable nodenegative breast cancer  
For patients with operable nodenegative breast cancer, adjuvant treatment should be restricted to 
patients eligible to receive chemotherapy according to internationally established criteria for primary 
therapy of early breast cancer (see section 5.1)." 
Consequently  to  the  proposed  new  indication,  SPC  sections  4.2,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  as  well  as  the 
Package  Leaflet  have  been  updated  as  well.  In  addition,  the  MAH  took  the  opportunity  to  perform  a 
correction  in  SPC  section  6.6  and  PL  concerning  the  preparation  guide  for  the  20mg/1ml,  80mg/4ml 
and 160mg/8ml concentrate for solution for infusion presentations. 
1.2.  Scientific Discussion 
1.2.1  Non clinical aspects 
The MAH did not provide any new nonclinical data in this application which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. 
Ecotoxicity / Environmental Risk Assessment 
The  MAH  has  predicted  an  environmental  concentration  in  surface  water  of  3.9 10-4 µg/l  and 
concluded that no further environmental risk assessment is necessary. 
The  MAH  proposed  to  make  a  ratio  of  the  maximal  total  quantity  marketing  forecast  (estimated  at 
450 kg/year  in  2011)  to  the  total  quantity  of  water  consumption  in  Europe  during  the  same  period 
(i.e.,  400 106  inhabitants  x  200  L  x  365  days)  and  use  the  usual  dilution  factor  of  10.  The  exposure 
would therefore be the following: 
450 106 
-----------------------------------      = 1.5x10-6 mg/L = 0.0015 ug/L 
400 106 x 200 x 365 x 10 
Concerning  the  present  Type  II  variation  for  the  combination  of  docetaxel  with  doxorubicin  and 
cyclophosphamide  for  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  patients  with  node-negative  operable  breast  cancer 
eligible  to  chemotherapy  the  number of  patients  concerned  would  be  7900 patients/year  who  receive 
4  cycles of two 80 mg vials, i.e.: 
7900 x 4 x 2 x 80 10-3 = 5056 g 
The MAH stated that logKOW of the active ingredient is 3.2 (calculated). In addition, the MAH referred to 
a literature review revealing other calculated or measured values as reported in table 1.

Furthermore, the MAH has provided information on fate (sorption, hydrolysis, aerobic biodegradation) 
and  effects  (acute  toxicity  test  on  Daphnia,  minimal  inhibiting  concentration  for  micro-organisms)  of 
docetaxel in the environment without submitting any study report.  
Discussion 
The  CHMP  considered  that  for  the  calculation  of  the  exposure  the  number  of  inhabitants  in  Europe 
must be 497*106(EU27, 2009): 450*106/(497*106*200*365*10) = 0.00124µg/L. 
Concerning the present extension of indication, the potential market for docetaxel as chemotherapeutic 
agent  should  be  considered.  That  means  the increase  of  the  quantity  market  will  be  50.56  kg,  based 
on this calculation: 79000*4*2*80*10-6 = 500.56 kg. 
However, both exposure calculations lead to PECs beneath the trigger of 0.01 µg/L. A Fpen refinement 
would  be  accepted  by  the  committee  in  Phase  I,  if  the  MAH  provides  the  source  of  breast  cancer 
incidences. 
The  logKOW  of  the  active  ingredient  is  3.2  (calculated).  The  MAH  has  further  provided  information  on 
fate (sorption, hydrolysis, aerobic biodegradation) and effects (acute toxicity test on Daphnia, minimal 
inhibiting  concentration  for  micro-organisms)  of  docetaxel  in  the  environment  without  submitting  any 
study report.  
It  was  appreciated  having  received  the  data  available  on  fate  and  effects  of  docetaxel  in  the 
environment. However, the data submitted are not in line with the guideline on the environmental risk 
assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/H/C/SWP/4447/00,  June  2007).  As  the 
environment  is  continuously  exposed  to  human  medicinal  products,  short-term  tests  are  not 
appropriate. Besides that, only one trophic level was tested. In any case, full test protocols which allow 
to  check  validity  and  plausibility  of  the  results  and  to  decide  whether  the  use  of  non-OECD  test 
guidelines would be acceptable need to be submitted. 
The MAH argued that a phase I pbt assessment is not deemed to be necessary, because the estimated 
logKOW is below 4.5. However, the MAH only calculated the logKOW from the environmental assessment 
included in the NDA. In addition, the MAH referred to a literature review revealing other calculated or 
measured values as reported in table 1.  
Because  of  lacking  data  the  CHMP  did  not  agree  with  the  MAHs  assumption  that  docetaxel  does  not 
present any  risk of bioaccumulation. To assess the bioaccumulation potential (logKOW >3) of the base 
docetaxel the mentioned logKOW -study has to be described in more detail, at least the pH at which the 
study was conducted, has to be provided. If literature with more detailed parameters or a study report 
can not be submitted the MAH is asked to perform a KOW-study according to OECD 107 and to submit 
the  final  study  report.  However,  if  the  log  KOW  >  3  was  proven  by  a  study,  the  MAH  committed  to 
perform a bioaccumulation study in line with OECD 305 in Phase II of the risk assessment.  
During  assessment  the  MAH  was  asked  to  provide  medicines  statistics  or  published  epidemiological 
data on the prevalence of the indication which could be used to refine the market penetration factor in 
Phase I and to demonstrate that the extension of indication does not lead to an increased exposure of 
the environment to the active ingredient. However, the CHMP had difficulties to verify the internal data 
provided and to follow on the basis of the estimation of patients and market forecasts. If the source for 
medicines statistics or published epidemiological data on the prevalence of the indication which could 
be used to refine the market penetration factor in Phase I and to demonstrate that the new indication 
does not lead to an increased exposure of the environment to the active ingredient can not be provided 
by the MAH, the MAH committed to conduct a Phase II ERA.  
1.2.2  Clinical Aspects 
1.2.2.1 Introduction 
The submission comprised a single, pivotal phase III trial, TAX.ES1.301/GEICAM 9805. In the adjuvant 
treatment  of  operable  node-positive  and  node-negative  breast  cancer,  the  recommended  dose  of 
docetaxel  is  75 mg/m2  administered  1-hour  after  doxorubicin  50 mg/m2  and  cyclophosphamide 
500 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (TAC regimen) (see also Dose adjustments during treatment in 
section 4.2 of the SPC).

According  to  the  MAH,  the  protocol  of  study  GEICAM  9805  was  designed  in  compliance  with 
recommendations of the 18th World Health Congress (Helsinki, 1964) and all applicable amendments, 
with  the  laws  and  regulations,  as  well  as  any  applicable  guidelines,  of  the  countries  where  the  study 
was conducted. 
1.2.2.2  Clinical Pharmacology 
No pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were submitted.  
Discussion and conclusion 
No  pharmacokinetic  interaction  during  the  co-administration  of  doxorubicin  cyclophosphamide,  and 
docetaxel  has  been  observed  in  the  previously  submitted  study  XRP6976D/1001  (a  pharmacokinetic 
interaction  study  of  docetaxel  75  mg/m2  i.v.  on  the  combination  therapy  doxorubicin  50  mg/m2  i.v. 
and  cyclophosphamide  500  mg/m2  i.v.  in  the  treatment  of  advanced  breast  cancer,  see  variation 
application  EMEA/H/C/073/II/54).  No  critical  issues  have  been  identified  concerning  clinical 
pharmacology. 
The pharmacokinetic properties of docetaxel are adequately described SPC section 5.2.

Dose response study(ies) 
No dose-response studies were submitted.  
In  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  operable  node-positive  and  node-negative  breast  cancer,  the 
recommended  dose  of  docetaxel  is  75 mg/m2  administered  1-hour  after  doxorubicin  50 mg/m2  and 
cyclophosphamide  500 mg/m2  every  3 weeks  for  6 cycles  (TAC  regimen).  For  the  complete  dosing 
recommendations,  see  SPC  section  4.2.  The  initial  dosing  recommendation  were  based  on  a  pilot 
phase II  study  of  docetaxel  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  (Nabholtz  et  al., 
J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jan 15;19(2):314-21), see variation application EMEA/H/C/073/II/54.

Investigators participating in the study were from institutions located in Spain, Germany and Poland. 
Treatments 
-  TAC: Doxorubicin 50 mg/m² as 15-min IV infusion followed by Cyclophosphamide 500  mg/m², as 
15-min IV infusion. There was a one-hour interval between the end of the IV infusion of doxorubicin 
and  the  beginning  of  the  infusion  of  Docetaxel  75  mg/m²  as  1-hour  IV  infusion.  Prophylactic 
antibiotic  therapy  (Ciprofloxacin  500 mg  orally  twice  daily  for  10 days  starting  on  Day 5  of  each 
cycle) was compulsory for subjects treated with TAC. The following premedication regimen for fluid 
retention was compulsory for all subjects treated with TAC. Dexamethasone 8 mg orally for total of 
6 doses. 
-  FAC: Doxorubicin 50 mg/m² as 15-min IV followed by 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m² as 15-min IV and 
Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m² as 15-min IV. 
Patients were to receive a total of 6 cycles unless treatment was precluded by relapse, subject refusal, 
or unacceptable toxicities. 
The chemotherapy doses were calculated according to baseline body surface area (BSA) for all cycles, 
and BSA was to be recalculated if there was a ≥10% decrease in body weight compared to baseline. 
Dose  reduction  and/or 
treatment 
discontinuation were planned for the 2 treatment groups in cases of severe haematological and/or non 
treatment  delay,  supportive 
treatment  adjustment,  and

haematological  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  or  laboratory  abnormalities,  including 
neutropenia. 
In both treatment groups, the following additional therapies were administered: 
 
 
Tamoxifen  20 mg  orally  once  daily  for  5 years,  starting  3  to  6 weeks  after  the  last  course  of 
chemotherapy for patients with positive ER and/or PR, unless there was a contraindication for the 
use of tamoxifen therapy 
Patients treated with lumpectomy were to undergo postoperative radiotherapy after completion of 
chemotherapy  and  resolution  of  any  side  effect(s).    Radiotherapy  was  allowed  after  mastectomy 
and  chemotherapy  for  node-negative tumours  >5 cm,  according  to  the  guidelines  at  each 
institution. 
A prophylactic antiemetic treatment was recommended for patients in both treatment groups, with the 
choice of antiemetic left to the discretion of the Investigator. 
Subsequent  to  the  initiation  of  the  study,  the  protocol  was  amended  to  require  primary  granulocyte 
colony-stimulating  factor  (G-CSF)  prophylaxis  in  all  TAC patients  (Protocol  Amendment  No. 3, 
18 July 2000 was instituted after the first 230 patients were randomized). This was to be used as: 
 
 
 
 
primary prophylactic treatment in patients treated with TAC 
curative treatment in case of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 X 109/L lasting <7 days, febrile 
neutropenia, or infection 
prophylactic treatment in patients treated with FAC with a prior episode of febrile neutropenia in an 
earlier cycle 
treatment for delayed recovery of ANC at Day 21 
Also in the TAC treatment group, antibiotic prophylaxis was to be administered to all patients from the 
first  cycle  of  treatment.  Ciprofloxacin  was  recommended  at  a  dose  of  500 mg orally  twice  daily  for 
10 days  starting  Day 5  of  each  cycle.  If  ciprofloxacin  was  not  available  or  not  tolerated,  another  oral 
antibiotic was required, the choice of which was at the discretion of the Investigator.   
Patients  were  also  required  to  receive  prophylactic  premedication  for  fluid  retention  (6 oral  doses  of 
dexamethasone 8 mg). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). DFS was defined as the interval from the date 
of  randomization  to  the  date  of  local,  regional,  or  metastatic  relapse,  or  the  date  of  second  primary 
cancer,  or  death  from  any  cause  (whichever  occurred  first).  If  there  was  no  event,  the  patient  was 
censored at the last visit. Patients with only baseline data were censored 1 day after randomization. 
The main secondary endpoints were: 
-  Overall survival (OS) defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date 
of death from any cause. 
-  Quality  of  life  (QOL).  QOL  evaluation  was  based  on  EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  QLQ-BR23,  self-
administered by the patient. 
-  Pathologic and molecular markers for predicting efficacy. 
Follow-up visits were to be every 12 weeks (3 months) for the first 2 years, every 6 months for years 
3-5,  and  then  annually  for  10  years.  Clinical  follow-up  could  be  more  frequent  according  to  the 
standard of practice at the participating center. 
First 2 years: 
-  Every 12 weeks: physical examination 
-  Every 6 months: haematology and biochemistry in addition to a physical examination 
-  Every  12  months:  mammography  and  chest  X-ray  in  addition  to  a  physical  examination, 
haematology, and biochemistry 
Years 3 to 5: 
-  Every 6 months: physical examination, haematology, biochemistry 
-  Every  12  months:  mammography  and  chest  X-ray  in  addition  to  a  physical  examination, 
haematology, and biochemistry 
Years 6 to 10: 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 7
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
-  Every 12 months: physical examination, haematology, biochemistry, and mammography  
-  Other diagnostic tests (ie, abdominal ultrasound and/or CT scan, bone scan) were to be performed 
only in the presence of signs and/or symptoms suggestive of cancer recurrence. 
-  A  quality  of  life  assessment  was  required  6  months,  12  months,  and  24  months  after  the  end  of 
chemotherapy. 
Sample Size 
DFS  in  the  control  group  was  estimated  to  be  around  80%  at  5  years.  The  study  was  originally 
designed  to  detect  a  7.5%  increase  in  DFS  for  TAC  compared  to  FAC  (i.e.  from  80%  to  87.5%).  To 
detect  this  difference  at  a  5%  significance  level  with  90%  power,  527  patients  were  calculated  to  be 
necessary in each arm (with an average follow-up period equal to 5 years). According to the MAH, this 
calculation  took  into  account  an  expected  3%  rate  of  ineligible  patients.  An  interim  analysis  was 
planned  in  the  initial  protocol  to  take  place  3  years  after  half  of  the  expected  recruitment  had  been 
completed  using  a  group  sequential  design  (Peto,  1976),  with  a  significance  level  of  0.001  for  the 
interim analysis. 
Randomisation 
The  randomisation  (1:1)  was  centralised  and  stratified  according  to  the  participating  institution  and 
menopausal status.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was non-blinded. 
Statistical methods 
The unstratified log-rank test was used to compare the 2 treatment groups for DFS and OS. All tests of 
hypotheses were two-sided. The primary efficacy analysis population was the ITT population. The ITT 
population was defined as the population of all randomized patients, analyzed in the treatment group 
to  which  they  were  assigned.  Randomized  patients  who  did  not  receive  chemotherapy  according  to 
randomization were analyzed in the treatment group of randomization.  
The QoL population was defined as the population of all randomized patients who presented at least 1 
baseline and post-baseline assessment of the QOL instruments. The GHS/QOL (Global Health Quality of 
Life)  score  was  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  QOL  analysis.  The  GHS/QOL  score  was  analyzed  using  a 
longitudinal  mixed  model  with  treatment  and  time  as  fixed  effects  and  patient  within  the  group  as 
random effect. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The cut-off date for data inclusion is 04 March 2009 (for clinical laboratory results, 05 May 2009), at 
which point all patients had completed at least 5 years of follow-up (median follow-up time of 6 years 
and 5 months [TAC: 76 months; FAC: 77 months]). A total of 1060 patients were randomized into the 
study. The first patient was randomized on 21 June 1999 and the last one on 10 March 2003. Fifty-five 
(55)  centers  actively  recruited  patients.  The  majority  of  patients  were  treated  in  Spain,  with  962  of 
1060 (90.8%) in Spain, 42 of 1060 (4.0%) in Germany, and 56 of 1060 (5.3%) in Poland. Details of 
overall patient disposition are provided in Figure 1.

There  were  33  (6.1%)  patients  in  the  TAC  treatment  group  and  13  (2.5%)  patients  in  the  FAC 
treatment group who discontinued chemotherapy treatment. Adverse events were the primary reason 
for treatment discontinuations in the TAC group (4.6% of patients), followed by withdrawal of consent 
(0.9% of patients). 
Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled on 21 June 1999; the last patient was enrolled on 10 March 2003. The 
statistical analysis plan (SAP), version 1.0 is dated on 11 February 2009. The Study cut-off date was 
04  March  2009  with  a  median  follow-up  time  of  77  months  (presented  as  the  final  primary  efficacy 
analysis). 
Conduct of the study 
The  originally  planned  interim  efficacy  analysis  after  3 years  of  follow-up  was  not  performed  because 
the number of events was too small for a meaningful analysis. 
Two interim efficacy analyses were performed in December 2007 and April 2008; the latter one was an 
updated analysis. The purpose of these analyses was to present the 5 year follow-up analysis results at 
the  2008 American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncology (ASCO).  Two  other  interim  efficacy  summaries  were 
performed in May 2006 and May 2007 that were not intended for submission and were for internal data 
review only. 
The following protocol amendments were performed:

Baseline data 
The population enrolled in GEICAM 9805 included patients with operable node-negative breast cancer 
with 1 or more high-risk factors (tumour size >2 cm, age <35 years, ER and PR negative, histological 
or nuclear grade 2 or 3). Demographic data for the ITT population are presented in table 1.

Table 2: Breast cancer surgery at first diagnosis – ITT population 
About 97% of the receptor-positive subjects in each treatment arm received tamoxifen. 
More than 50% of patients in each treatment group received adjuvant radiotherapy (TAC: 57.3%, FAC: 
51.2%),  consisting  mostly  of  patients  who  had  undergone  breast-conserving  surgery  (TAC:  53.2%, 
FAC: 47.4%), but few who had undergone mastectomy (TAC: 4.1%, FAC: 3.8%).

A  total  of  1060  patients  were  randomized  per  protocol.  Seventeen  (17)  patients  were  subsequently 
found  to  be  ineligible  (TAC:  13;  FAC:  4).  Nine  (9)  patients  were  not  treated  (TAC:  8;  FAC:  1)  and 
4 patients were not treated with study medication as randomized (TAC: 3; FAC: 1). Three (3) patients 
did  not  have  baseline  or  postbaseline  efficacy  assessments,  and  2  patients  had  at  least  1  positive

All  1060  randomized  patients  were  included  in  the  efficacy  analysis  (ITT  population).  However, 
9 patients  did  not  receive  any  study  treatment,  8  (1.5%)  in  the  TAC  group  and  1  (0.2%)  in  the  FAC 
group. The reasons for not being treated were withdrawal of consent (4), deviation from the protocol 
(1),  “other”  (3),  and  missing  (1).  Three  (3)  patients  randomized  to  the  TAC  group  received  TAF  not 
according  to  the  protocol,  and  1  patient  (Patient  No.  00916)  who  was  randomized  to  the  FAC  group 
received  TAC  in  the  first  cycle  and  FAC  in  the  remaining  5  cycles,  not  according  to  the  protocol.  This 
patient was analyzed for efficacy in the FAC group and for safety in the TAC group. The 3 TAF patients 
were  analyzed  in  the  TAC  treatment  group  as  randomized.  Slightly  more  patients  were  treated  with 
TAC  compared  with  FAC.  This  was  mainly  due  to  chance  because  randomization  was  stratified  by 
centers,  and  the  large  number  (N  =  55)  of  centers  carried  a  chance  of  slight  imbalances.  For  the 
purposes  of  efficacy  analyses,  patients  in  the  ITT  population  were  analyzed  according  to  the 
randomization group to which they were assigned (TAC: 539; FAC: 521).

Overall Survival (OS) 
At the cut-off date of 04 March 2009, and with a greater than 5 year follow-up time (median follow-up 
time was 6 years and 5 months), 60 (5.7%) patients had died (TAC: 26 [4.8%]; FAC: 34 [6.5%]). No 
significant  association  was  observed  between  treatment  and  OS  (HR  of  TAC  vs.  FAC  =  0.758, 
95% CI = 0.454, 1.263; p=0.2853).

Quality of Life 
A  baseline  evaluable  QLQ-C30  questionnaire  was  available  for  941  (88.8%)  of  the  1060  randomized 
patients. A baseline evaluable QLQ-BR23 questionnaire was available for 931 (87.8%) patients. 
Compliance with the QLQ-C30 questionnaires was similar in both treatment groups, with a decline from 
baseline (TAC: 87.6%; FAC: 90.0%) to Cycle 6 (TAC: 71.1%; FAC: 74.1%) and to follow-up 8 (TAC: 
25.4%; FAC: 26.3%). 
Compliance  with  QLQ-BR23  questionnaires  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups,  with  a  decline  from 
baseline (TAC: 86.1%; FAC: 89.6%) to Cycle 6 (TAC: 70.7%; FAC: 73.7%) and to follow-up 8 (TAC: 
25.2%; FAC: 26.5%). 
Baseline  QOL  score  was  71  in  both  treatment  groups  (Table  11),  and  both  groups  reported  a 
deterioration  of  QOL  during  treatment  (i.e.,  until  last  cycle).  The  deterioration  over  time  was 
statistically  significant  for  TAC  compared  with  FAC  (p  =  0.0007).  The  evolution  over  time  was  also 
statistically significant (p <0.0001). 
The  reduction  in  QOL  was  transient.  The  GHS/QOL  score  reached  a  minimum  at  Cycle  6,  with  an 
estimated  treatment  difference  of  5.83  points  (TAC:  54.35;  FAC:  60.18).  The  QOL  scores  in  both 
treatment  groups  returned  to  the  baseline  value  as  of  the  second  follow-up  2  visit.  The  GHS  scores 
were comparable between the 2 treatment groups during follow-up visits. 
Both groups reported a deterioration of QOL during treatment (i.e., until last cycle). The deterioration 
over  time  was  statistically  significant  for  TAC  compared  with  FAC  (p  =  0.0007).  The  evolution  over 
time  was  also  statistically  significant  (p <0.0001).  There  was  no  significant  treatment  by  time 
interaction (interaction test p=0.1762). 
The  reduction  in  QOL  was  transient.  The  GHS/QOL  score  reached  a  minimum  at  Cycle  6,  with  an

Discussion on the Clinical Efficacy 
The  international  consensus  panel  meeting  in  St. Gallen  in 1998  defined  women  with  operable 
node-negative breast cancer to have a high risk of relapse if they met the following criteria: 
Tumour size greater than 2 cm and/or 
- 
-  Negative ER and PR and/or 
-  Grade 2 to 3 (histological or nuclear, whichever is greatest) and/or 
- 
Age less than 35 years. 
Considering that, more than 25% of node-negative patients treated with FAC had recurrent disease at 
10 years, in June 1999, the GEICAM 9805 trial was initiated to compare FAC with TAC in patients with 
high-risk,  node-negative  breast  cancer  as  defined  by  the  1998  St. Gallen criteria.  Tamoxifen  therapy

was  indicated  as  a  post-chemotherapy  intervention  for  all  patients  with  hormone-sensitive  breast 
cancer. 
Meanwhile,  the  adjuvant  treatment  selection  algorithm  for  the  management  of  early  breast  cancer 
radically changed during the last decade. As a consequence and according to the most recent concepts, 
the  benefit  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  clear  for  triple  negative  patients  and  for  HER2  positive 
disease. For the latter chemotherapy is given with or preceding Herceptin. While, for patients with ER 
positive, HER2 negative disease the decision for adjuvant chemotherapy is most difficult. 
TAC dosage and schedule is similar to the one used for patient with node positive breast cancer (study 
TAX  316).  Only  the  duration  infusion  for  cyclophosphamide  was  lengthened  from  5  to  15  minutes  in 
order  to  improve  tolerance.  Anthracycline  based  regimens  are  viewed  as  standard  therapies  among 
several other regimens. Therefore, the comparator FAC was considered acceptable. 
Based on the efficacy analyses presented, with a median follow-up time of 6 years and 5 months TAC 
(HR = 0.676, 
was  associated  with  a  32% 
95% CI = 0.493-0.926),  p=0.014.  When  components  of  the  composite  DFS  endpoint  are  taken  into 
consideration, it appeared that a difference between TAC vs. FAC was observed in terms of secondary 
primary  malignancies  (2.4  %  vs.  5.0%)  and  local  breast  cancer  relapse  (0.7%  vs.  3.3%),  but  not  in 
terms of distant metastases (7.4% vs. 8.3%). 
reduction  compared  with  FAC 
relapse 
risk 
To  assess  validity  of  the  primary  endpoint  (DFS)  and  the  consistency  of  the  relapse  assessments 
across  treatment  groups,  a  time  to  event  analysis  was  performed,  including  presentation  of 
Kaplan-Meier  curves.  The  pattern  of  follow-up  median  time  from  randomization  to  physical 
examinations,  mammogram,  chest  imaging,  abdominal imaging, and  bone  imaging,  respectively,  was 
comparable between treatment groups (data not shown).  
All subgroups analyses of DFS were consistent with the overall result. All estimated HR for subgroups 
consistently  favoured  TAC  over  FAC.  The  effect  of  TAC  vs.  FAC  appeared  to  be  more  significant  in 
patients having breast-conserving surgery (HR 0.53, 95%-CI 0.33-0.86) or patients receiving adjuvant 
radiotherapy (HR 0.53, 95%-CI 0.33-0.83). However, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions based on 
the subgroup analyses presented. 
The  pivotal  trial  included  patients  corresponding  to  the  standard  definition  of  high-risk  for  relapse 
(1998  St  Gallen  criteria)  at  the  time  where  the  trial  was  initiated  (June  1999).  Considering  the  most 
recent  2009  St  Gallen  consensus  conference,  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  the  mainstay  treatment  of 
patients  with  triple  negative  early  breast  cancer.  In  study  GEICAM  this  population  is  represented  by 
183 patients.  However,  in  study  GEICAM9805,  the  subgroup  analysis  on  this  population  is 
underpowered to draw any firm conclusions. 
No difference in OS was observed. The lack of a significant difference may be due to the small number 
of  events  26  (4.82%)  under  TAC  and  34  (6.53%)  under  FAC).  The  MAH  committed  to  submit  more 
mature OS data when available.  
Due to the open design of the study, the importance of the observed results in terms of QOL data was 
considered to be limited. 
A  total  of  4  unplanned  interim  efficacy  analyses  were  performed.  The  CHMP  was  concerned  that  the 
single  pivotal  trial  for  this  application  may  lack  robustness  and  the  final  statistical  significance  of  the 
proposed  conclusion  may  not  be  convincing  (see  Points  to  Consider  on  Application  with  1.  Meta-
analyses; 2. One Pivotal study, CPMP/EWP/2330/99). The MAH was requested to provide reassurance 
on  the  validity  of  the  reported  results.  Although  the  methodological  weaknesses  were  acknowledged, 
the CHMP concluded that in view of the supportive evidence and the overall coherent results, this did 
not constitute a major issue.  
There  are  limited  data  available  in  patients  > 70 years  of  age  on  docetaxel  use  in  combination  with 
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. This is adequately reflected in section 4.4 of the SPC. 
Essential  prophylactic  anti-emetic  treatment  was  well  planned in  both  arms.  The  oral  dexamethasone 
premedication regimen is well specified in the protocol and is accordance with the proposed SPC. The 
protocol  planned  compulsory  prophylactic  antibiotic  therapy  for  the  TAC  arm.  However,  no  similar 
recommendation is specified in the SPC.  
A primary prophylactic administration of G-CSF was introduced through protocol amendment and this 
is reflected in the SPC (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).

1.2.4  Clinical safety  
Patient exposure 
Of the 1060 patients randomized, 1051 were evaluable for safety, according to the treatment actually 
received (TAC: 532; FAC: 519). 
Adverse events 
All the patients (100%) in both arm experienced at least 1 Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE). 
There  were  more  patients  with  Grade  3-4  TEAEs  and  SAEs  in  the  TAC  group  as  shown  in  Table  17 
below. Treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs were also more frequently reported in the TAC group 
compared to the FAC group.

TEAEs  regardless  of  causal  relationship  during  chemotherapy  are  presented  in  table  18  below.  For  all 
grades  of  severity,  the  incidence  rates  of  TEAEs  were  higher  by  ≥10%  in  the  TAC  treatment  group 
compared  with  the  FAC  treatment  group  for:  asthenia,  diarrhoea,  myalgia,  arthralgia,  peripheral 
edema,  and  febrile  neutropenia.  The  incidence  rate  of  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  was 
approximately double in TAC patients compared with FAC group. 
The  most  common  Grade  3  to  4  events  in  the  TAC  treatment  group  were:  asthenia,  neutropenia, 
nausea, stomatitis, and vomiting.

Haematological  TEAEs  were  more  frequent  in  the  TAC  group  (anaemia,  thrombocytopenia  and 
neutropenia, febrile neutropenia).  
After 202 patients had been enrolled in the study, 33 patients had experienced serious haematological 
TEAEs, with 29.6% of TAC patients experiencing febrile neutropenia versus 0% of FAC patients.  
Consequently, an amendment (Amendment No, 3, 18 July 2000) made primary prophylaxis with G-CSF 
mandatory for TAC patients. Before use of G-CSF became mandatory in the TAC patients, incidence of 
neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia  and  neutropenic  infection  was  very  high  (93.7%,  25.2%  and  12.6% 
respectively).  After  protocol  amendment  and  systematic  administration  of  G-CSF,  incidence  of  these 
events decreased to 32.1%, 5.5% and 5.0%.  
Average incidence of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection remains higher in the 
TAC  group  compared  to  the  FAC  group  (44.9%  vs.  13.3%;  9.6%  vs.  2.3%  and  6.6%  vs.  2.7% 
respectively).

Regarding  TEAEs  related  to  treatment  during  chemotherapy  for  all  grades  of  severity,  the  incidence 
rates of the following related TEAEs were higher by ≥10% in the TAC treatment group compared to the 
FAC  treatment  group:  asthenia  (TAC:  71.4%;  FAC:  57.8%),  diarrhoea  (TAC:  26.3%;  FAC:  12.1%), 
myalgia  (TAC:  19.4%;  FAC:  2.1%),  febrile  neutropenia  (TAC:  17.9%;  FAC:  4.0%),  arthralgia  (TAC: 
16.4%; FAC: 4.2%), and peripheral edema (TAC: 16.4%; FAC: 2.9%). The incidence rate of peripheral 
sensory  neuropathy  was  more  than  double  in  TAC  patients  compared  to  FAC  patients  (TAC:  14.7%; 
FAC: 6.4%). 
TEAEs  into  the  follow-up  period  included  TEAEs  which  occurred  during  the  chemotherapy  period  and 
persisted  into  the  follow-up  period  and  TEAEs  that  started  or  worsened  during  the  follow-up  period. 
TEAEs were considered as they “did not resolve” if the last follow-up entry for that TEAE reported the 
outcome  as  “TEAE  did  not  resolve”.    TEAEs  were  considered  resolved  only  if  resolution  was 
documented.    Absence  of  reporting  a  previously  unresolved  TEAE  at  a  subsequent  follow-up  was  not 
considered documentation of resolution. Patients were considered “lost to follow-up” when so identified 
on the CRF “end of chemotherapy” or “follow-up” pages. 
In total, 33 patients in the FAC arm and 43 patients in the TAC arm had TEAEs that did not resolve in 
follow-up. TEAEs not resolved in multiple patients during follow-up, with a frequency at least two times 
greater in one treatment group compared to the other treatment group are summarized as follows: 
-  Prevalent in the TAC group: amenorrhea (13 patients in TAC, 5 patients in FAC), alopecia (7 patients 
in  TAC,  1  patient  in  FAC),  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (6 patients  in  TAC,  2 patients  in  FAC), 
asthenia (4 patients in TAC, 2 patients in FAC), lymphoedema (4 patients in TAC, 1 patient in FAC), 
arrhythmia  (3 patients  in  TAC,  no  patients  in  FAC),  and  hyperhydrosis  (2  patients  in  TAC,  no 
patients  in  FAC).    One  of  the  3  TAC  patients  (patient  00923)  who  had  arrhythmia  at  the  follow  up 
3 visit  was  also  diagnosed  with  grade  2  goiter  since  her  follow  up  2  visit;  no  other  details  were 
reported for the other two TAC patients (patients 00319 and 00650) with reported arrhythmia.  
-  Prevalent in the FAC group: menstruation irregular (6 patients in FAC, 1 patient in TAC), hot flush 
(5 patients  in  FAC,  2  patients  in  TAC),  bone  pain  (3  patients  in  FAC,  no  patients  in  TAC),  and  nail 
disorder (2 patients in FAC, no patients in TAC). 
Among TEAEs not resolved at follow-up, there was one serious adverse event (SAE) of Herpes zoster in 
the TAC group.  In 4 additional cases, assessment of seriousness was not reported (lymphoedema and 
radiation  skin  injury  in  FAC  group;  amenorrhea  and  biopsy  endometrium  normal  in  TAC  in  TAC 
patients).  All the other reported TEAEs persisting in follow-up were considered non serious.   
All  the  persisting  TEAEs  had  a  severity  Grade  1-2  (when  reported),  except  for  the  following  Grade  3 
adverse events in TAC patients: arrhythmia, neutropenia, pain, and thrombocytopenia. 
A total of 23 and 18 patients were considered lost to follow-up in the TAC and FAC groups respectively. 
The median duration of follow-up in these patients prior to being lost was greater than 2.5 years.

Serious Adverse Events 
There were significantly more SAEs in the TAC group compared to the FAC group during chemotherapy 
(22.4%  vs.  4.2%).  Study  drug  related  SAEs  were  also  more  frequently  reported  in  the  TAC  group 
compared to the FAC group (20.3 vs. 3.3).

The most frequent non haematological serious TEAEs reported during chemotherapy in both treatment 
groups were diarrhoea (1.7% vs. 0.6%), nausea, and vomiting (1.3% vs. 0.2% each). 
Serious TEAEs of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were approximately 7 fold more frequent in the 
TAC group (15.6% vs. 2.7% and 5.3% vs. 0.6% respectively). 
After  primary  G-CSF  prophylaxis  became  mandatory  in  the  TAC  group,  incidence  of  serious  TEAEs, 
decreased from 45% to 16.4% but remains higher than in the FAC group.

Among the 25 TAC patients who died, 19 died due to complications of breast cancer. Of the remaining 
6  deaths,  1  patient  died  from  second  primary  malignancy  (colon  cancer)  and  1  patient  with 
controlateral  breast  cancer  died  from  massive  pulmonary  thromboembolism,  1additional  patient  died 
from thromboembolism, 2 died from myocardial infarction, and one 54-year-old patient with a medical 
history  of  arthrosis,  hypertension  and  thrombosis  of  lower  extremities  (during  study),  died  during 
sleeping 3 years and 10 months of the last study treatment. 
In  the  FAC  group  1  out  of  the  34  reported  deaths  was  assessed  as  study  drug  related.  In  the  TAC 
group, all the deaths were assessed as not related to study drug 
It is to be noted that of the 6 TAC patients who died due to another cause than disease progression, 
2 died  from myocardial  infarction  and  one  54-year-old  patient without  any significant  cardiac  medical 
history  had  a  sudden  death.  In  the  last  patient,  cardiac  death  cannot  be  excluded.  Overall,  cardiac 
death  can  be  suspected  in  3  of  the  6  TAC  patients.  However,  given  that  cardiotoxicity  has  not  been 
adequately monitored, no conclusion can be drawn from the provided data 
Other significant TEAEs: 
The following significant TEAEs were discussed by the MAH: 
  Neutropenic complications, infection and G-CSF use 
After 202 patients had been enrolled in the study, 33 patients had experienced serious TEAEs, with 
29.6% of TAC patients experiencing febrile neutropenia versus 0% of FAC patients.  
Consequently, an amendment (Amendment No, 3, 18 July 2000) made primary prophylaxis with G-
CSF  mandatory  for  TAC  patients.  Before  use  of  G-CSF  became  mandatory  in  the  TAC  patients, 
incidence  of  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia  and  neutropenic  infection  was  very  high  (93.7%, 
25.2% and 12.6% respectively). After protocol amendment and systematic administration of G-CSF, 
incidence of these events decreased to 32.1%, 5.5% and 5.0% 
However, these events remains more frequent in the TAC group compared to the FAC group (44.9% 
vs. 13.3%; 9.6% vs. 2.3% and 6.6% vs. 2.7% respectively). 
  Cardiac TEAEs and hypertensive/hypotensive TEAEs 
As  a  requirement  of  the  protocol,  LVEF  was  measured  at  baseline  only  in  patients  with  suspected 
cardiac dysfunction, and during the study when considered clinically relevant by the Investigator. A 
total of 13 (2.4%) of patients in the TAC group and 2.7% in the FAC group had their LVEF assessed. 
Decrease  in  LVEF  below  lower  normal  limit  was  identified  in  2  patients  from  the  TAC  group. 
Although,  routine  assessments  were  not  performed,  there  were  more  cardiac  events  in  the  TAC 
group (3.8%) compared to the FAC group 12 (2.2%). 
In  particular  regarding  cardiac  TEAEs  in  total,  all-grade  cardiac  failure,  congestive  heart  failure 
(CHF), or cardiomyopathy were reported in 4 patients in the TAC arm and 5 patients in the FAC arm, 
while Grade 3-4 cardiac failure, CHF, or cardiomyopathy were reported in 1 patient in the TAC arm 
and 2 patients in the FAC arm. 
To  further  provide  assessment  of  the  long-term  risk  of  cardiotoxicity  in  patients  receiving  the  TAC 
regimen, data are presented below from TAX316, a study similar to GEICAM 9805 but in which the 
adjuvant TAC regimen was compared to FAC in node-positive breast cancer patients. Evaluation of 
the  long  term  cardiac  risk  with  the  same  TAC  regimen  is  a  post-marketing  commitment  for  the 
protocol  TAX 316.  Interim  results  from  the  cardiac  monitoring  in  study  TAX 316  demonstrate  the 
following  data  regarding  cardiovascular  toxicity:  a  total  of  21  TAC-treated  patients  and  14  FAC-
treated patients had developed Grade 3-4 CHF (Table 23).

As of the first Safety Update Report (SUR) of March 2005, there were 17 cumulative reports of CHF 
in  the  TAC  arm,  and  7  in  the  FAC  arm,  representing  a  relative  increase  of  0.6%  and  0.5%, 
respectively, from the April 2003 safety cut off date for the CSR.  Between March 2005 and March 
2009, a modest increase in the incidence of CHF (0.5% in the TAC arm, and 0.9% in the FAC arm) 
was  reported  in  both  arms.  Table 24  illustrates  the  time  course  of  the  cumulative  reports  of  CHF, 
with 17 cases in the TAC arm in March 2005, and 4 additional TAC cases from March 2005 through 
March 2009.  Comparatively, the reports of CHF in the FAC arm increased from 7 to 14 during the 
same interval.

  Fluid retention 
Despite  of  compulsory  prophylactic  premedication  for  fluid  retention  with  corticosteroid  in  the  TAC 
group, the incidence of fluid retention events was 4 fold higher in the TAC group (127/532) than in 
the FAC group (34/519). 
  Gastrointestinal TEAEs 
Nausea,  stomatitis,  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  and  constipation  were  the  most  common  GI  events 
reported for both TAC and FAC patients, 
The  only  gastrointestinal  TEAE  (all  grades,  regardless  of  causal  relationship)  to  be  reported  ≥10% 
more frequently in the TAC treatment group compared with the FAC treatment group was diarrhoea.  
Serious  gastrointestinal  events  occurring  in  more  than  1  patient  included  diarrhoea  (TAC:  1.7%; 
FAC: 0.2%), nausea (TAC: 1.3%; FAC: 0.2%), vomiting (TAC: 1.3%; FAC: 0.2%), stomatitis (TAC: 
0.4%;  FAC:  0),  dyspepsia  (TAC:  0.4%;  FAC:  0),  constipation  (TAC:  0.2%;  FAC:  0.2%),  and 
abdominal pain (TAC: 0.2%; FAC: 0.2%). Intestinal obstruction was reported in 1 patient from the 
TAC group. 
  Neurological TEAEs

There were more than double of peripheral neuropathy TEAEs (sensory and motor) in the TAC group 
(15.6% and 3.4%) compared to the FAC group (7.3% and 0.4%). Peripheral sensory neuropathy is 
listed as very common AE in the SPC.

a  As reported by the investigator. 
b    Patient  00018  continued  receiving  TAC  chemotherapy  49  days  after  she  had  been  diagnosed  with 
melanoma. 
The  malignant  melanoma  and  acute  leukaemia  reported  respectively  in  patients  00018  and  00740 
were  recorded  as  serious  TEAEs.  The  melanoma  in  patient  00018  was  also  reported  as  an  efficacy 
endpoint. Regarding the “colon cancer” reported in patient 00693, and assessed by the investigator as 
not related to chemotherapy, however, a laparotomy was performed to confirm a tentative diagnosis of 
colon cancer, which was reported as a TEAE (“colon cancer”).  The tentative diagnosis was ultimately 
not confirmed, and thus the “colon cancer” was not reported as an efficacy endpoint in this patient.

  Renal function 
The  incidence  rate  of  renal  and  urinary  TEAEs  and  laboratory  abnormalities  were  comparable 
between  the  2 treatment  groups.  No  serious  renal TEAEs  or  treatment  discontinuations  because  of 
renal TEAEs were reported. 
  Hepatic function 
The  overall  incidence  of  ALT  and  AST  elevations  was  lower  in  the  TAC  group  (45.3%  and  34%) 
compared with the FAC group (54.1% and 44.9%); however, the incidence of Grade 3 to 4 ALT and 
AST elevations, was slightly higher in the TAC group (1.7 % vs. 1.3% and 1.1% vs. 0.2%). 
The overall incidence of total bilirubin elevation was higher in the TAC group (4.1%) compared with 
the FAC group (2.9%).  
There were 2 patients in the TAC treatment group who experienced serious liver/biliary toxicity.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Twenty-five (4.7%) patients in the TAC group had study treatment discontinued because of 44 TEAEs 
versus  4 (0.8%)  patients  due  to  7  TEAEs  in  the  FAC  group.  Haematological  TEAEs  are  the  most 
frequently reported causes for treatment withdrawal (14 out of 25): febrile neutropenia (1.5% vs. 0% 
in the FAC group) and neutropenia/neutrophil count (1.1% vs. 0% in the FAC group). One patient from 
the TAC group was withdrawn because of cardiomyopathy.

Safety meta-analysis of trials GEICAM 9805 and TAX 316 
During assessment the MAH was requested to present a safety meta-analysis as basis for the update of 
SPC section 4.8. The clinically important TEAEs from the two studies GEICAM 9805 and TAX 316 were 
grouped  by  body  system,  presented  side-to-side  and  as  integrated  data  in  the  Table  31  (Clinically 
important  treatment-related  TEAEs).  The  cutoff  date  for  the  data  from  the  GEICAM  9805  study  was 
04 March  2009,  and  the  cut  off  date  for  the  data  from  the  TAX  316  study  was  02  June  2009.  TEAEs 
were consistently coded using the MedDRA version 8.1. 
The clinical importance of these TEAEs was determined with respect to the TAC regimen, based upon 
incidence  (>10%),  severity,  or  clinical  impact  of  the  TEAEs.  The  MAH  outlined  that  apparent 
CHMP variation assessment report

differences  between  the  safety  data  from  the  study  TAX 316  (adjuvant  TAC  in  node-positive  breast 
cancer)  compared  to  GEICAM9805  (adjuvant  TAC  in  node-negative  breast  cancer)  should  be 
interpreted  with  caution,  because  the  two  studies  were  different  regarding  geographical  regions, 
populations  (e.g.,  overall  post-menopausal  status:  47.5%  in  GEICAM  9805  and  33.4%  in  TAX316; 
overall  ER+/PR+  status:  49.1%  in  GEICAM  9805  and  60.6%  in  TAX316),  and  study  conduct  (e.g., 
primary prophylaxis with filgrastim –granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) [G-CSF] was required only 
in  all  TAC  patients  in  GEICAM  9805  after  the  first  111  TAC  patients,  while  it  was  not  permitted  in 
TAX316). 
The  integrated  safety  data  describe  the  overall  safety  profile  of  the  TAC  regimen  as  adjuvant 
chemotherapy  in  breast  cancer  (node-positive  and node-negative)  and  the  information  resulting  from 
this  integrated  analysis  has  been  translated  in  table  “Adjuvant  therapy  with  TAXOTERE  75 mg/m²  in 
combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  in  patients  with  node-positive  (TAX  316)  and 
node-negative (GEICAM 9805) breast cancer - pooled data” in section 4.8 of the SPC.

Discussion on Clinical Safety 
In study GEICAM 9805, patients from TAC group, experienced higher frequency of TEAEs. There were 
significantly more SAEs in the TAC group compared to the FAC group during chemotherapy (22.4% vs. 
4.2%). Study drug related SAEs were also more frequently reported in the TAC group compared to the 
FAC group (20.3 vs. 3.3). Treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs were also more frequently reported 
in the TAC group compared to the FAC group.  
Haematological  toxicity  was  clearly  higher  in  the  TAC  arm,  but  was  managed  with  systematic  G-CSF 
and compulsory prophylactic antibiotiotherapy. 
The most frequent non haematological serious TEAEs reported during chemotherapy in both treatment 
groups were diarrhoea (1.7% vs. 0.6%), nausea, and vomiting (1.3% vs. 0.2% each). 
In  particular,  based  on  the  provided  safety  data  from  GEICAM  study,  it  was  not  possible  to  assess 
cardiac  toxicity  including  asymptomatic  decrease  in  LVEF.  Indeed,  despite  obvious  risk  of  cardiac 
toxicity  due  to  associated  anthracycline  in  the  TAC  regimen  and  potential  decrease  in  LVEF  with 
docetaxel,  the  study  protocol  was  amended  not  being  able  to  detect  asymptomatic  cardiac 
dysfunctions. 
Due  to  the  lack  of  data  on  cardiotoxicity  from  study  GEICAM  9805,  data  from  study  TAX  316  were 
provided. Cardiac toxicity was higher in the TAC group compared to the FAC group in study Tax 316. 
In total, all-grade cardiac failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), or cardiomyopathy were reported in 4 
patients  in  the  TAC  arm  and  5  patients  in  the  FAC  arm,  while  Grade  3-4  cardiac  failure,  CHF,  or 
cardiomyopathy were reported in 1 patient in the TAC arm and 2 patients in the FAC arm. 
Overall, according to the TAX 316 data, as of the first SUR of March 2005, there were 17 cumulative 
reports (2.3%) of CHF in the TAC arm, and 7 in the FAC arm (1%). Between March 2005 and  March 
2009,  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  CHF  was  reported  in  both  arms.  As  of  March  2009,  2.8%  of 
patients  from  the  TAC  group  (21)  and  1.9%  of  patients  from  the  FAC  group  (14)  had  grade  3  or 
4 cardiac  heart  failure.  The  risk  of  cardiac  failure  is  already  addressed  in  sections  4.4  and  4.8  of  the 
SPC. 
A total of 28 patients in the FAC arm had a diagnosis of SPM as an efficacy endpoint, and 16 patients 
in  the  TAC  arm  had  a  diagnosis  of  SPM  as  an  efficacy  endpoint  (14  patients).  The  histopathological 
diagnoses seem to be similar between the two treatment groups. Only 3 SPM were reported as TEAEs 
in the TAC group (0 in the FAC group): 
The  risk  of  delayed  myelodysplasia  and  or  myeloid  leukaemia  in  the  TAC  treated  patients  is  already 
addressed in the SPC. Given the high hematotoxicity of the TAC regimen requiring the use of G-CSF, 
the risk of delayed myelodysplasia and or myeloid leukaemia should be monitored. 
As of 04 March 2009, 25 (4.7%) TAC patients and 34 (6.6%) FAC patients died, all during the follow-
up  period.  No  patient  died  within  30  days  of  the last  study  treatment.  In  the  FAC  group  1  out  of  the 
34 reported  deaths  was  assessed  as  study  drug  related.  In  the  TAC  group,  all  the  deaths  were 
assessed as not related to study drug. 
Overall,  docetaxel  in  combination  with  doxorubicin and  cyclophosphamide  is  more  toxic  than  the  FAC 
regimen  particularly  regarding  haematotoxicity.  Overall,  the  TAC  regimen  was  associated  to  a  higher 
incidence  of  haematological  (mainly  neutropenic  events),  cardiac,  neurological,  gastrointestinal  and 
fluid retention events. 
The safety profile of docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in node negative 
breast cancer is not unexpected, but should be put in balance with efficacy data in this indication. 
1.2.5 Risk Management Plan 
As  part  of  the  variation  application  the  MAH  submitted  a  justification  why  for  this  extension  of 
indication no Risk Management Plan is required. This justification was considered acceptable.

2.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
The  present  application  is  supported  by  one  pivotal,  non-blinded,  randomized,  Phase III  study 
(GEICAM 9805 /TAX.ES1.301),  designed  to  compare  DFS  (disease-free  survival)  after  adjuvant 
chemotherapy following primary surgery for breast cancer in high-risk node-negative patients receiving 
one of the following adjuvant combination chemotherapy regimens: 
- TAC (Taxotere, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide), 
- FAC (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide). 
In  breast  cancer  adjuvant  setting,  surgery  could  result  in  a  cure  of  the  malignant  disease.  However, 
many  patients  will  relapse  and  can  die  from  their  cancer.  This  is  related  to  silent  residual 
diseases/micrometastases  not  eliminated  by  surgery.  This  silent  disease  in  relation  to  the  removed 
tumour can be local or distant (metastases).  
An adjuvant medical treatment is expected to suppress or eliminate this undetectable residual disease 
avoiding  (or  delaying)  relapses.  This  delay  in  relapses  is  per  se  a  clinical  benefit  since  it  provides  a 
prolonged time free from toxic treatments and major health concerns to the patients.  
Nevertheless, the benefit of an adjuvant therapy is directly related to the risk of relapse and patients in 
whom  a  relapse  is  unlikely  should  not  have  proposed  chemotherapy  whereas  patients  at  high  risk  of 
relapse may be the ideal target of this treatment. 
The  adjuvant  treatment  selection  algorithm  for  the  management  of  early  breast  cancer  radically 
changed  during  the  last  decade.  As  a  consequence,  and  according  to  the  most  recent  concepts,  the 
benefit  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  clear  for  triple  negative  patients  and  for  HER2  positive  disease. 
For the latter, chemotherapy is given with or preceding Herceptin. For patients with ER positive, HER2 
negative disease, the decision for adjuvant chemotherapy is more difficult. 
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
Adjuvant  chemotherapy  benefit  should  be  demonstrated  in  terms  of  DFS  translating  ultimately  into 
beneficial  effect  on  survival.  At  least,  demonstration  of  the  absence  of  negative  effects  on  survival  is 
expected. 
Data  from  this  multicenter  open  label  randomized  trial  support  the  use  of  docetaxel  for  the  adjuvant 
treatment  of  patients  with  operable  node-negative  breast  cancer  eligible  to  receive  chemotherapy. 
1060 patients  were  randomized  to  receive  either  TAXOTERE  75 mg/m2  administered  1-hour  after 
doxorubicin  50 mg/m2  and  cyclophosphamide  500 mg/m2  (539  patients  in  TAC  arm),  or  doxorubicin 
50 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 (521 patients in FAC 
arm), as adjuvant treatment of operable node negative breast cancer patients with high risk of relapse 
according  to  1998  St.  Gallen  criteria  (tumour  size  >2cm  and/or  negative  ER  and  PR  and/or  high 
histological/nuclear grade (grade 2 to 3) and/or age <35 years). Median duration of follow-up was 77 
months.  Significantly  longer  disease-free  survival  for  the  TAC  arm  compared  to  the  FAC  arm  was 
observed. TAC-treated patients had a 32% reduction in the risk of relapse compared to those treated 
with FAC (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI (0.49-0.93), p = 0.01). Overall survival (OS) was also longer in 
the TAC arm with TAC-treated patients having a 24% reduction in the risk of death compared to FAC 
(hazard  ratio = 0.76,  95%  CI  (0.46-1.26,  p = 0.29).  However,  the  distribution  of  OS  was  not 
significantly different between the 2 groups. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A  total  of  4  unplanned  interim  efficacy  analyses  were  performed.  The  CHMP  was  concerned  that  the 
single  pivotal  trial  for  this  application  may  lack  robustness  and  the  final  statistical  significance  of  the 
proposed  conclusion  may  not  be  convincing.  Although  the  methodological  weaknesses  were 
acknowledged,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  in  view  of  the  supportive  evidence  and  the  overall  coherent 
results, this did not constitute a major issue.  
According to the most recent clinical standards (St Gallen 2009 conference), one part of the population 
included  in  study  GEICAM  9805  would  not  be  treated  at  all  today  with  adjuvant  chemotherapy.  Until 
further  data  become  available,  adjuvant  treatment  should  be  restricted  to  patients  eligible  to  receive 
chemotherapy  according  to  internationally  established  criteria  for  primary  therapy  of  early  breast 
cancer. 
OS data are still premature. As a preliminary assessment it can, however, be stated that TAC is a least 
not  worse  than  FAC  in  terms  of  OS.  The  MAH  committed  to  submit  mature  OS  data  as  soon  as  this 
becomes available. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
TAC regimen was authorised for the adjuvant treatment of patients with operable node- positive breast 
cancer in 2004. This indication is based on a single pivotal phase III study, TAX316. The safety profile 
of docetaxel associated with AC is as expected. However in comparison with FAC, TAC safety profile is 
expected to be worse in terms of haematotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, colitis, and leukaemia. 
Regarding study GEICAM 9805 in the adjuvant treatment of patients with node negative breast cancer, 
overall,  docetaxel  in  combination  with  doxorubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  is  more  toxic  than  the  FAC 
regimen particularly regarding haematotoxicity. 
Haematological  TEAEs  were  more  frequent  in  the  TAC  group  (anaemia,  thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia).  
Systematic  use  of  G-CSF  in  the  group  TAC  reduced  occurrence  of  neutropenic  events.  However, 
incidence  of  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia  and  neutropenic  infection  remains  higher  in  the  TAC 
group  compared  to  the  FAC  group  (44.9%  vs.  13.3%;  9.6%  vs.  2.3%  and  6.6%  vs.  2.7% 
respectively). 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Concerning  the  pre-clinical  assessment,  several issues  regarding  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment, 
remain. Therefore, a commitment from the MAH to report in due dates the responses to the additional 
questions, is necessary. 
On  a  clinical  view,  despite  obvious  risk  of  cardiac  toxicity  due  to  associated  anthracycline  in  the  TAC 
regimen  and  potential  decrease  in  LVEF  with  docetaxel,  the  study  protocol  was  amended  in  order  to 
not  detect  asymptomatic  cardiac  dysfunctions.  This  protocol  amendment  remains  not  comprehensible 
and  should  have  been  justified.  However,  the  risk  of  cardiotoxicity  is  addressed  in  the  proposed  SPC 
for this variation. 
When second primary malignancies occurred prior to Breast Cancer Relapse (BCR), they were reported 
as DFS events. The number of Second Primary Malignancies (SPM) reported as events in terms of the 
primary  endpoint  was  higher  in  the  FAC  group  in  comparison  to  the  TAC  group.  Given  the  high 
haematotoxicity of the TAC regimen requiring the use of G-CSF, the risk of delayed myelodysplasia and 
or myeloid leukaemia should be monitored. 
Currently  there  is  a  trend  to  an  improved  OS,  the  uncertainties  for  this  endpoint,  resulting  from  the 
large 95%-CIs and the low number of events observed, however, are large.  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
 
The CHMP questioned whether the selection criteria in this study correspond to a population that could 
be  expected  to  benefit  from  an  adjuvant  chemotherapy.  Indeed,  according  to  recent  clinical 
recommendation (Goldhirsch et al., 2009) one part of the population recruited in the pivotal trial would 
not be treated at all with adjuvant chemotherapy. The adjuvant treatment selection algorithm for the 
management  of  early  breast  cancer  radically  changed  during  the  last  decade.  As  a  consequence  and 
according  to  the  most  recent  concepts,  the  benefit  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  clear  for  triple 
negative  patients  and  for  HER2  positive  disease.  For  the  latter,  chemotherapy  is  given  with  or 
preceding Herceptin. Patients with ER positive, HER2 negative disease constitute a group for whom the 
decision  for  adjuvant  chemotherapy  is  most  difficult.  Patients  with  small  primary  tumours  (pT1a  pN0 
and  ER  negative)  might  avoid  adjuvant  systemic  therapy.  There  is  no  agreement  on  a  standard 
chemotherapy  regimen  for  any  disease  subset.  Until  conclusive  data  become  available,  adjuvant 
treatment  should  be  restricted  to  patients  eligible  to  receive  chemotherapy  according  to  the  most 
recent internationally established criteria for primary therapy of early breast cancer. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  TAC  in  the  adjuvant  treatment  of  patients  with 
operable  node  negative  breast  cancer  eligible  to  receive  chemotherapy  according  to  current  clinical 
guidance  is  positive.  Until  further  data  become  available,  adjuvant  treatment  should  be  restricted  to 
patients  eligible  to  receive  chemotherapy  according  to  internationally  established  criteria  for  primary 
therapy of early breast cancer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Conclusion 
On  20  May  2010  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common 
cancer in women worldwide. In Europe, CRC is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the 
second leading cause of cancer death (Ferlay J, Parkin DM, Steliarova-Foucher E (2010). 
â€˜Estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in Europe in 2008â€™ Eur J Cancer; 46(4):765-81). The 
stage of disease at the time of diagnosis represents the most relevant prognostic factor. Five-
year survival rates range from 93% for stage I disease to less than 10% for stage IV. In 
approximately 60% of cases the initial diagnosis is carried out at late stages of disease which are 
characterised by poor prognosis. 
Surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in certain cases, represents the standard 
therapeutic approach for patients with loco-regional disease. However, around 25% of patients 
will subsequently develop distant metastases. Besides this, approximately 25% of patients 
present with metastatic disease at initial diagnosis.  
At present, there is no curative treatment for patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC). When left 
untreated, these patients have a poor prognosis, with a median survival of about 6 months. With 
the exception of few selected patients where resection of metastases is indicated, the standard 
treatment for patients with metastatic disease is represented by systemic chemotherapy, which 
has demonstrated to significantly improve overall survival to an average of 20 months. The 
currently available systemic chemotherapeutic options for patients with mCRC consist essentially 
of fluoropyrimidine-based regimens alone or in combination with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX, CAPOX) or 
irinotecan (FOLFIRI, CAPIRI). Fluoropyrimidine-based regimens have demonstrated similar 
activity when given as first or second line therapy (Tournigand C, AndrÃ© T, Achille E, Lledo G, 
Flesh M, Mery-Mignard D, Quinaux E, Couteau C, Buyse M, Ganem G, Landi B, Colin P, Louvet C, 
de Gramont A (2004). â€˜FOLFIRI followed by FOLFOX6 or the reverse sequence in advanced

colorectal cancer: a randomized GERCOR studyâ€™ J Clin Oncol; 22(2):229-37). Addition of the 
anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab to the above mentioned first or second line 
chemotherapies has demonstrated to modestly improve survival and delay disease progression. 
In patients carrying tumours with a wild type form of the Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) gene, the 
anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab 
can also be administered as monotherapy or in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based 
regimens. Finally, the anti-VEGF fusion protein aflibercept has recently been approved in 
combination with FOLFIRI as second line treatment of patients with mCRC. 
Regorafenib is low molecular weight, orally available, inhibitor of multiple protein kinases, 
including kinases involved in tumour angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2), oncogenesis (KIT, 
RET, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E), and the tumour microenvironment (PDGFR, FGFR). In preclinical 
studies regorafenib has demonstrated antitumour activity in a broad spectrum of tumour models 
including colorectal tumour models which is mediated both by its antiangiogenic and 
antiproliferative effects. Major human metabolites (M-2 and M-5) exhibited similar efficacies 
compared to regorafenib both in vitro and in vivo models. 
The indication sought for regorafenib is the following: Stivarga is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been previously treated with, or 
are not considered candidates for, available therapies. These include fluoropyrimidine-based 
chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, in case of KRAS wild type CRC, an anti-EGFR therapy. 
The finally approved indication is the following: Stivarga is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been previously treated with, or are 
not considered candidates for, available therapies. These include fluoropyrimidine-based 
chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy and an anti-EGFR therapy. 
The recommended dose is 160 mg once daily (four 40 mg tablets OD) for 3 weeks on therapy 
followed by 1 week off therapy to comprise a cycle of 4 weeks. Regorafenib should be taken at 
the same time each day after a light meal. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 40 mg of regorafenib as the 
active substance. The excipients used in the formulation of Stivarga are povidone, croscarmellose 
sodium, microcrystalline cellulose, silica colloidal anhydrous and magnesium stearate. 
The product is available in white opaque HDPE bottle closed with a PP/PP screw cap with sealing 
insert and a molecular sieve desiccant. Each bottle contains 28 film-coated tablets. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Regorafenib monohydrate is a white to slightly pink or slightly brownish solid substance, 
practically insoluble in water, dilute alkaline solution, dilute acid solution, n-heptane, glycerine 
and toluene.  It is slightly soluble in acetonitrile, dichloromethane, propylene glycol, methanol, 2-
Assessment report

Page 9/91 
 
  
  
propanol, ethanol and ethyl acetate. It is sparingly soluble in acetone and soluble in PEG 400 
(macrogol). Regorafenib is not hygroscopic. 
The chemical name is 4-[4-({[4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]carbamoyl} amino)-3-
fluorophenoxy]-Nmethylpyridine-2-carboxamide (monohydrate) and has the following structural 
formula: 
Figure 1: chemical structure of regorafenib 
Regorafenib crystallizes in three modifications with melting points at 206 Â°C (Mod. I), at 181 Â°C 
(Mod. II,) and at 141 Â°C (Mod. III). In addition, one pseudo-polymorph has been found, a 
monohydrate (water content of 3.6 %). Solid state form characterisation has been performed by 
XRD, IR, Raman, NIR, FIR, 13C-solid state-NMR, DSC and TGA. Regorafenib monohydrate was 
selected as stable active substance which can be manufactured reproducibly and is used in 
crystalline, non-micronized form for the production of Regorafenib tablets. 
The structure of regorafenib monohydrate has been elucidated using IR and Raman 
spectroscopy, UV-VIS, NMR (1H and 13C), MS, elemental analysis and X-Ray structural analysis. 
The analysis was performed on one batch of the active substance. 
Manufacture 
Regorafenib is synthesized in three main steps using well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specification.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using elements of Quality by Design such as risk-
assessment, OVAT (One Variable At a Time) experiments, design of experiments and spiking 
experiments.  The results of these studies were used to define proven acceptable ranges for the 
different steps of the regorafenib manufacturing process. For each stage of the synthesis an 
experimental model was established taking potential scale effects into consideration. The models 
used were shown to be scientifically justified and therefore enable a prediction of quality. This 
supports the extrapolation of operating conditions and amounts of reacting materials across 
multiple scales and equipment.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified 
by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 10/91 
 
  
  
 
Batch analysis data is provided on three commercial scale batches produced with the proposed 
synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active ingredient can be manufactured 
reproducibly. 
The active substance is packed in polypropylene or polyethylene bags. The secondary packaging 
is a closed container for mechanical protection. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual examination), identity 
(IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC) impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and water content (Karl 
Fisher).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.   
Batch analysis data on three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Three pilot scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial package 
from the proposed manufacturer were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: under long 
term (25Â°C/60%RH) for up 24 months, and accelerated (40Â°C/75%RH) for up 12 months. 
Results on stress conditions (thermal, oxidative, and hydrolytic stress) show that regorafenib is 
chemically extremely stable to thermal stress, has good stability towards hydrolytic stress and is 
quite stable to oxidative stress. Photostability studies were also performed on one batch. The 
results showed that in the solid state regorafenib is not sensitive to light, when irradiated 
according to ICH Q1B.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, organic impurities, assay and water. The 
stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to provide an immediate release solid 
dosage form of regorafenib with high oral bioavailability and high patient compliance.  
A solid solution (co-precipitate) tablet formulation was selected as dosage form, in order to 
transfer the active substance, which is characterized by an extremely low solubility in aqueous 
media, into the amorphous form. Upon contact with the dissolution medium the tablets 
disintegrate and the solid solution dissolves forming a supersaturated solution with a significantly 
higher concentration of regorafenib in solution than expected based on the solubility of the 
crystalline active substance. Consequently, higher oral bioavailability is achieved when 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 11/91 
 
  
  
administering regorafenib as a solid solution tablet compared to a conventional tablet comprising 
the active substance in crystalline micronized form.  
The excipients used in the formulation of regorafenib tablets are common ingredients for a solid 
oral dosage form. The excipients have been chosen based on preliminary formulation 
development experience and compatibility studies. Regorafenib tablets are film-coated in order 
to provide a homogeneous appearance, to add a colour for product identification, to reduce 
dusting during handling of the tablets and to facilitate swallowing. The coating system comprises 
PVA, ferric oxide red, ferric oxide yellow and titanium dioxide, lecithin, macrogol and talc. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
A comprehensive risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) 
method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an 
influence on specified finished product attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior 
knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the 
experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies with regorafenib 
tablets. The critical process parameters were monitored carefully during validation and the 
critical quality attributes were evaluated intensively during process validation and stability tests. 
In addition, further studies were conducted to define adequate operating ranges for these 
process parameters to ensure a robust and reproducible manufacturing process. Furthermore, 
development studies enabled the identification of appropriate in-process controls and product 
specifications to ensure the intended quality, safety, efficacy and performance of the product 
through traditional final product release testing.   
The dissolution method has been adequately developed and its discriminating capability 
demonstrated. The use of surfactant and the dissolution medium was justified. Sink conditions 
were confirmed. The dissolution test was shown to be sufficiently discriminative in detecting 
relevant changes to the solid solution granules.  
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that used for marketing. 
The primary packaging proposed is white opaque HDPE bottle closed with a PP/PP screw cap with 
sealing insert and a molecular sieve desiccant. The material complies with Ph.Eur. requirements 
and it is adequate to support the stability and use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacture of the finished product involves conventional processes including (1) mixing, 
(2) granulation, (3) roller compaction, (4) blending, (5) post-blending, (6) tableting, (7) coating 
and (8) drying. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process has been validated by a number of studies for the major steps of the 
manufacturing process and has been demonstrated to be capable to reproducibly produce 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 12/91 
 
  
  
finished product of the intended quality. The in process controls are adequate for this film coated 
tablet preparation.  
The batch analysis data on five full scale batches shows that the tablets can be manufactured 
reproducibly according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control 
of this oral preparation. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for appearance (visual 
examination), identity (HPLC and TLC or NIR), uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur.), degradation 
products (HPLC), assay (HPLC), dissolution (Ph.Eur.), absence of crystalline regorafenib (XRPD), 
water content (Karl Fisher), residual solvents (GC) and microbiological contamination (Ph.Eur).  
Batch analysis results of five production scale batches confirm consistency and uniformity of 
manufacture and indicate that the process is capable and under control. 
The specification is acceptable, ensures batch-to-batch consistency and provides an adequate 
control of the solid state form. The analytical methods have been adequately described and 
validated.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches stored under long term conditions for 36 months at 
25ÂºC/60%RH and at 30Â°C/76% RH, and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 
40ÂºC/75%RH according to ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of regorafenib film-coated 
tablets are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, degradation products, assay, water content, 
breaking load, disintegration and microbial purity. The analytical procedures used were stability 
indicating. 
Photostability testing as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products was performed. No significant differences were seen and no light 
storage restrictions are needed. 
Stability data has been provided demonstrating that the product remains stable following first 
opening of the container, when stored at 30Â°C/75% RH. The in-use stability data provided justify 
the claimed maximum in-use shelf-life of 7 weeks. 
The finished product is sensitive to moisture. For this reason the tablets are packed and stored in 
tightly closed HDPE bottles with a desiccant capsule inside. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The finished product is formulated as an 
amorphous solid solution dosage form, in the presence of a precipitation inhibitor. This leads to 
an increase in solubility of the active substance. The presence of the precipitation inhibitor helps 
maintain supersaturation levels, thereby improving bioavailability. Quality by Design principles 
have been used in this application during the pharmaceutical development but a Design Space 
was not claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance neither for the finished 
product.  Risk assessment was performed to optimise the manufacturing conditions of the active 
substance.  For the finished product, the Quality by Design approach was used for the 
development of the manufacturing process. The control strategy and process validation follow 
the traditional approach.  The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the

clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In vivo studies were performed in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey. All pivotal toxicological 
studies were conducted in accordance with current regulatory requirements and in compliance 
with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). Safety pharmacology studies were 
conducted under GLP regulations as requested by ICH S7A and B with the exception of a study 
investigating the effect of regorafenib on hERG K+ currents. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The kinase activity of regorafenib was tested in biochemical assays by either measuring enzyme 
inhibition or by a competitive binding assay. Regorafenib inhibited a distinct set of kinases, 
including the angiogenic and stromal receptor tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) VEGFR1-3, TIE2, FGFR1 
and PDGFRÎ² with IC50 values ranging from 4 to 311 nM, and the oncogenic RTKs KIT and RET, 
along with the intracellular signalling kinases C-RAF/RAF-1 and wild-type and mutant B-RAF with 
IC50 values in the range of ~ 2 to 30 nM. M-2 and M-5, the two pharmacologically active

metabolites of regorafenib, showed kinase selectivity profiles similar but different from 
regorafenib. Inhibition of kinase phosphorylation was analysed in cells expressing relevant target 
kinases. Regorafenib inhibited phosphorylation of VEGFR2, VEGFR3, TIE2, PDGFRÎ², KIT (wild-
type and mutant), mutant RET and FGFR with IC50 ranging from ~ 3-200 nM; persistent 
inhibition of VEGFR2 autophosphorylation was observed for 24h after  removal of regorafenib 
from NIH-3t3/VEGFR2 cells. The antiproliferative activity of regorafenib was evaluated in a panel 
of tumour cell lines of different origin and on VEGF stimulated proliferation of HUVECs. Inhibition 
of proliferation was seen for most cell lines, although the IC50s were in the lower ÂµM range and 
IC50 values could not be determined for a number of cell lines (highest concentration tested was 
10 ÂµM). 
Xenografts of cancer specimens derived from patients were injected in immunodeficient mice to 
test the in vivo antitumour effect of regorafenib, orally administered at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg 
for 22 days. The drug, either alone or in combination with irinotecan, induced a significant 
growth delay in patient derived-CRC xenografts. However, in only 2 of 4 patient derived-CRC 
xenografts a significant growth inhibition was observed for regorafenib treated animals, and in 
only 1 of these 4 this response was better than oxaliplatin (a substance stated to have only 
limited anti-colorectal tumour effect). Potent tumour growth inhibition was seen in 8 patient-
derived gastric cancer (GC) xenograft models. Dose dependent tumour growth inhibition was 
seen in mice for regorafenib and, with lower potency, for the two active metabolites M-2 and M-
5, at oral doses of 3 or 10 mg/kg for 27 days. No correlation was observed between antitumour 
activity and the mutation status of either KRAS or BRAF in the injected cell lines. Regorafenib 
also inhibited syngeneic orthotopic or intramuscularly growing liver, breast, and brain tumours, 
significantly improving for example the survival of mice transplanted with a syngeneic hepatoma. 
The mechanistic data showed reduced vascularisation and increased apoptosis in tumour tissue. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
An in vivo assay based on the transient hypotensive effect of VEGF in anaesthetised rats was 
used to characterise the acute effect of regorafenib and its metabolites M-2 and M-5 after 
intravenous administration. Intravenous administration of 0.1 mg/kg regorafenib (10 minutes 
prior to VEGF injection) attenuated while injection of 1 mg/kg completely prevented the 
hypotensive response to VEGF. Also M-2 and M-5 inhibited the transient hypotensive effect 
induced by VEGF injection. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In vitro data from the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique on HEK293 cells stably transfected 
with the HERG K+ channel indicated that regorafenib as well as M-2 and M-5 can inhibit the 
hERG K+ current in a concentration-dependent manner. However, exposure of rabbit cardiac 
Purkinje fibers to regorafenib did not induce changes of resting membrane potential, action 
potential amplitude, maximal depolarization velocity and action potential duration at 20 % 
repolarization at all concentrations tested with the exception of the highest one which was close 
to the limit of solubility.

For the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, four GLP-compliant studies in anesthetised dogs 
were submitted. A single intraduodenal administration of regorafenib as suspension at doses of 
10, 30 and 100 mg/kg or a cumulative intravenous infusion of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5, at dose 
steps of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg/kg (30 minutes per dose step) had no effects on cardiovascular 
function, ECG, lung mechanics, acid/base-status, haematocrit and plasma electrolytes. 
Four GLP-compliant studies in conscious male rats were conducted in order to investigate 
potential effects of regorafenib and its metabolites M-2 and M-5 on parameters of CNS function. 
Single oral doses of regorafenib (2, 10, and 50 mg/kg), M-2 (1, 5 and 20 mg/kg,) or M5 (1, 5 
and 20 mg/kg) did not elicit substantial adverse CNS (behavioural, locomotor activity, body 
temperature) effects. No effect on nocifensive reflex responses to acute heart exposure, 
hexobarbital sleep and chemoconvulsion threshold dose were seen following single oral doses of 
regorafenib (2, 10 and 50 mg/kg). 
In another GLP-compliant study, treatment with regorafenib inhibited the intestinal barium 
transport in rats in a statistically significant and dose-related manner. 
Finally, after a single oral dose of regorafenib, a significant decrease in blood glucose 
concentration was seen in rats. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Regorafenib was tested in an in vivo tumour xenograft study in combination with irinotecan and 
in another study with an investigational MEK inhibitor, without observing additional toxicity in 
either case. Regarding synergism, a beneficial effect from the addition of regorafenib to 
irinotecan was only observed in the most regorafenib-sensitive tumour. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The in vivo pharmacokinetics of regorafenib and its metabolites M-2 and M-5 was investigated in 
mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey. Additionally, in vitro studies were performed to investigate 
plasma protein binding, blood cell/plasma partitioning, drug-drug interaction potential, 
metabolism and transport. 
The permeability of regorafenib was determined in Caco-2 cells; a comparison with 22 reference 
compounds revealed that regorafenib is highly permeable. 
Single IV and/or PO administration studies were performed in rats, dogs and monkey. The oral 
bioavailability of regorafenib was high in rats and independent of dose (~80%). In contrast, the 
absolute bioavailability in dogs decreased with increasing dose (from ~70 to 29%). Cmax was 
reached after 4 to 6 h in rat and after 1.6 to 2.7 h in dogs and monkeys. The volume of 
distribution was lower in rats than in dogs (0.9 versus 1.8 L/kg). In mice, the AUC and Cmax 
increased slightly more than dose proportional with increasing dose at the 1 to 20 mg/kg and a 
slightly less than dose proportional increase at 20 to 80 mg/kg. In rats, the AUC was dose 
proportional and the Cmax increased slightly less than dose proportional. In dogs, AUC and 
Cmax increased dose proportionally from 1 to 2.5 mg/kg and less than dose proportional from 
2.5 to 10 mg/kg.

EMA/CHMP/403683/2013

After repeated dosing, a slight to moderate increase in AUC and Cmax was observed in rat and 
rabbit. In contrast, AUC and Cmax decreased slightly to moderately in mice and dogs. In mice, 
the AUC and Cmax increased slightly more than dose proportional with increasing dose at the low 
to medium dose and a slightly less than dose proportional increase at the medium to high dose. 
The binding of regorafenib to plasma proteins of mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys, dogs and human, 
investigated in vivo, was high (>98%) and species dependent. The main binding protein was 
serum albumin. The in vitro blood-to-plasma ratio of regorafenib (1-45 Âµg/L) was investigated in 
blood from rat, dog and human. Regorafenib was mainly distributed into plasma with a blood-to-
plasma ratio of 0.63 to 0.72. 
Regorafenib radioactivity was thoroughly distributed to almost all organs and tissues and there 
was no evidence of irreversible binding or retention of radioactivity. In terms of AUC, exposure 
was highest for the kidney, liver, adrenal gland, Harderian gland, submandibular gland and 
cardiac muscle. After 168 h, radioactivity was still present in several tissues, including thyroid, 
hypophysis, bone marrow, liver and kidney. After a single oral dose of [14C]-regorafenib (3 
mg/kg) to pregnant albino rats a moderate penetration across the placental barrier was 
observed. 
In vitro metabolite profiles revealed two primary phase I reactions: N oxidation at the pyridine to 
give M-2 and hydroxylation of the N-methyl group to give M-3. Based on comparison of 
metabolite profiles, humans, mice, rabbits and monkeys favour M-2 over M-3 formation. In 
contrast, rat and dog favour the formation of M-3 and only small amounts of metabolite M-2 
were found. Incubations of regorafenib with hepatocytes showed the same species dependence. 
Furthermore, an important interspecies difference was the presence of two glucuronides (M-7 
and M-8) in human hepatocyte incubations. Rat and dog hepatocytes were not capable of 
forming these conjugates. 
CYP3A4 catalysed the formation of the metabolites M-2 and M-3. CYP2J2 only catalysed the 
formation of M-3. The formation of M-4 and M-6 were catalysed by alcohol dehydrogenase 
(ADH). UGT1A9 is the major enzyme involved in the glucuronidation of regorafenib and M-2 
(metabolite M-7 and M-8) and UGT1A7 to a lesser extent. 
The in vivo biotransformation of regorafenib was studied in mice, rats, dogs, and humans. 
Following a single oral administration of regorafenib, the parent compound was the major 
component in mouse, rat, dog, and human plasma. Metabolite M-2 was the main metabolite in 
human plasma, but was only found in small amounts in mouse plasma and not in rat and dog 
plasma. Furthermore, the metabolites M-5 (amide pyridine N-oxide) and M-7 (urea N-
glucuronide) were only found in human plasma as minor metabolites and could not be detected 
in plasma of all other species. In rat and dog plasma methylhydroxylated metabolite M-3 was a 
major. Metabolite M-4 was found in plasma of all species, but as trace in humans and as major 
metabolite in rats. Metabolite M-6 was only present in considerable amounts in dog plasma, but 
could only be detected in traces in plasma of rats and not at all in plasma of humans and mice. 
The excretion of radioactivity was mainly via the biliary/faecal route and to a minor extent via 
urine. However, the contribution of urine to the overall excretion played a more important role in 
humans than in the other species. Furthermore, regorafenib or its radioactive metabolites were 
secreted into the milk. No metabolite profile was identified in milk.

Regorafenib was not displaced from its plasma protein binding by any tested highly protein 
bound compound at clinically relevant concentrations. Regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 were inhibitors 
of P-glycoprotein and BCRP. Regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 are not substrates of MRP2 at clinically 
relevant concentrations. Regorafenib was not a substrate for P-glycoprotein, BCRP, OATP1B1, 
and OATP1B3. Regorafenib and metabolites M-2 and M-5 are inhibitors of P-glycoprotein and 
BCRP and therefore interaction may occur via these transporters. Regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 are 
not inhibitors of DPD, which is important in the metabolism of 5 fluorouracil. Regorafenib was not 
an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. However, regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 were inhibitors 
of CYP2C8, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 at clinically relevant concentrations.

Genotoxicity 
Regorafenib was tested in vitro in the Salmonella/microsome assay and a mammalian 
chromosome aberration assay and in vivo in the bone marrow micronucleus test. None of these 
assays indicated genotoxic potential of regorafenib.

Carcinogenicity 
No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No fertility and early embryonic development studies were submitted (see discussion on Non-
clinical aspects).  
The influence of regorafenib on embryo-foetal development was investigated in pilot studies in 
rats and rabbits and in a pivotal GLP study in rabbits. 
In the rabbit pivotal study, signs of maternal toxicity were observed at the dose of 1.6 
mg/kg/day including a marginal to slight body weight loss, total resumptions and thus a 
decreased gestation rate. Post-implantation loss was severely increased at this dose level. 
Therefore, based on the results of this study a NOAEL of 0.8 mg/kg/day could be derived for 
systemic maternal toxicity. A treatment related effect on malformations was clearly observed at 
1.6 mg/kg/day (mainly findings of the urinary system, the heart, and the axial skeleton) and at 
0.8 mg/kg/day (mainly malposition of forelimb(s) or hind limb(s), findings of the heart and major 
vessels, urinary system, and skeleton [skull bones, caudal vertebral bodies]). A treatment 
related effect on external and visceral deviations is assumed for findings of the urinary system at 
1.6 mg/kg/day and 0.8 mg/kg/day. Foetal examinations for skeletal retardations and variations 
revealed increased incidence of fused sternebrae and 7th cervical ribs at 0.8 mg/kg/day and 1.6 
mg/kg/day. The applicant stated that, based on these results, a NOAEL of 0.4 mg/kg/day for 
embryo-foetal development could be derived in this study. 
No pre- and post-natal development or juvenile toxicity studies were submitted (see discussion 
on non-clinical aspects). 
Toxicokinetic data 
In mice, the AUC and Cmax increased slightly more than dose proportionally with increasing dose 
at the 1 to 20 mg/kg dose range and a slightly less than dose proportional increase was 
observed at 20 to 80 mg/kg. In rats, the AUC was dose proportional and the Cmax increased 
slightly less than dose proportionally. In rabbits, the AUC and Cmax increased dose-proportionally 
from 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg and moderately more than dose proportionally from 0.8 to 1.6 mg/kg. In 
dogs, AUC and Cmax increased dose proportionally from 1 to 2.5 mg/kg and less than dose 
proportionally from 2.5 to 10 mg/kg. 
Major interspecies differences in metabolite pattern were observed. In humans, N-oxidation of 
the pyridine to form metabolite M-2 was much more pronounced than N-methylhydroxylation to 
form metabolite M-3, which was predominantly found in rats and dogs. Additionally, 
glucuronidation only played an important role in the biotransformation of regorafenib in humans. 
Four human specific metabolites were identified, namely M-2, M-5, M-7 and M-8. The human 
specific metabolites M-2 and M-5 are pharmacologically active. The applicant investigated the 
kinetics of the human specific metabolites M-2 and M-5 and not of the glucuronide metabolites 
M-7 and M-8.

The excretion of regorafenib and its metabolites was mainly via the faeces. However, the 
contribution of urine to the overall excretion was larger in humans than in the animal species. In 
humans, a pronounced enterohepatic circulation was observed. This can be explained by hepatic 
formation of primary metabolites M-2 and M-7 and their secretion into gut followed by reduction 
of M-2 and deconjugation of M-7 each to parent drug by microbial flora and subsequent intestinal 
reabsorption. This was not observed in the animal species. 
Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies have been conducted. However, various morphological 
changes were noted in the gastrointestinal tract of animals treated orally by gavage with the 
10% coprecipitate formulation of regorafenib. Signs of degenerative and regenerative processes 
were seen in particular in the stomach and duodenum of mice and rats. Morphological changes in 
dogs were less pronounced although clinical signs of gastrointestinal intolerance were observed 
(bloody diarrhoea, emesis). 
Other toxicity studies 
No antigenicity or dependence studies were submitted. 
Immunotoxicity endpoints were evaluated in the 13-week rat study. No immunotoxic potential 
for regorafenib was observed. 
Evaluation of the systemic toxicity of the main human metabolites M-2 and M-5 in 4-week mouse 
repeat-dose studies with daily oral administration provided evidence that both metabolites induce 
less toxicity than the parent compound. 
Several batches of regorafenib with a spectrum of the relevant impurities were used in the 
nonclinical toxicology program. All impurities were qualified in the toxicological studies at the 
individual levels specified. In addition, the genotoxic potential of four impurities that could be 
expected in the drug substance/product was experimentally evaluated in genotoxicity assays. For 
one of them a mutagenic potential was shown in the Ames test. Moreover, a weak mutagenic 
potential for the same impurity was also shown in the Comet assay (data not shown, see 
discussion on Non-clinical aspects). 
An in vitro phototoxic study suggested that regorafenib is a probable phototoxic compound but 
this was not confirmed in the in vivo study conducted in mice.

a Since the water solubility (Sw) was not determined (reported as a < value), the result of the study cannot 
be displayed correctly. Since no effect was observed at the highest tested concentration, the result is 
displayed as >S w for practical reasons. 
Regorafenib is potentially PBT (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic). The criterion can only be 
concluded after evaluation of the additionally requested aquatic studies. The substance is very 
persistent (vP). It is also bioaccumulative, but not very bioaccumulative (vB).  
The revised PECsurface water was calculated at 0.112 Âµg/L. The Koc will have to be determined 
using an OECD 106 study. PECsoil and PECsediment can only be (re)calculated after the results 
of this study are available. A risk to the STP (Sewage Treatment Plants) is considered unlikely. 
Apart from the OECD 106 study, the dossier was complete. However the chronic studies with 
algae, Daphnia and fish are considered unreliable, the results cannot be used in the risk 
assessment. In conclusion, the risk assessment for the surface water, groundwater, soil and 
sediment compartment cannot be completed. 
In view of the nature of the molecule and in the light of the recommended further studies, the 
CHMP is of the Opinion that a precautionary approach regarding the disposal of the medicine into 
the environment needs to be adopted. The SmPC and PL have been updated accordingly.  
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific 
progress, the CHMP recommends the following points to be addressed: 
â€“  An adsorption/desorption study with 3 soils and 2 sludges (OECD 106) 
â€“  A toxicity study with a green algal species (OECD 201) 
â€“  A chronic toxicity study with Daphnia magna (OECD 211) 
â€“  A chronic toxicity study with fish; early life stage toxicity test (OECD 210). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Data from the in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacology studies indicate that regorafenib has 
broad anti-tumour activity; however, it appears that there is significant variation in the response 
of colon tumours to regorafenib treatment. 
The pharmacological activity of regorafenib in animal species besides immunodeficient mice has 
not been reported. It is assumed that regorafenib has the same activity in animals when 
compared to humans. This assumption is supported by amino acid sequence homology and the 
observed effects in animals. It is however not clear if the potency of regorafenib to inhibit the 
different RTKs is similar across species. However, as treatment-related adverse effects were seen 
in animals at exposures equal to or below the clinical exposure level, further studies on this issue 
were not considered necessary. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 24/91 
 
  
  
 
Findings in the secondary pharmacology studies may indicate inhibition of VEGF-mediated signal 
transduction which could be expected based on the tyrosine kinase inhibition profile. Additional 
secondary activity studies were not submitted. However, as findings in the safety pharmacology 
studies are considered to be consistent with the pharmacological activity of regorafenib, no 
further studies were considered necessary. 
Regarding the safety pharmacology, the in vitro concentrations of M2 and M5 at which significant 
hERG K+ inhibition was observed were lower than the maximum concentration in plasma at 
steady state for M2 (~6.7 ÂµM) and M5 (~6.0 ÂµM). However, due to the high protein binding, the 
concentrations of unbound substance are much lower for both (M2: ~13 nM, M5: ~3.2nM) and 
well below the concentration at which hERG K+ blockade can be expected. Moreover, no effects 
on ECG parameters were seen in isolated rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibers exposed to regorafenib 
and in four GLP-compliant studies in anaesthetised dogs. 
In in vivo studies, no substantial adverse effects were seen on cardiovascular, respiratory, and 
CNS function. 
The kinetics of regorafenib was sufficiently investigated in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog and monkey. 
The major animal species studied were rat and dog. Large interspecies differences were observed 
making the extrapolation of the pre-clinical data to humans difficult. 
Repeat dose toxicity with daily administration by oral gavage of regorafenib was evaluated in 
mice (up to 5 weeks), rats (up to 26 weeks) and dogs (up to 52 weeks). 
Studies in these species revealed a comparable toxicological profile characterised by 
degenerative changes, frequently accompanied by regenerative and inflammatory processes in 
multiple tissues in the range of or below the anticipated clinical exposure. Target organs are 
largely consistent with those seen with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors and most effects are 
considered to be of clinical relevance, as they occurred at systemic exposures in the range of or 
below the anticipated human exposure (based on AUC comparison).  After repeated dosing to 
mice, rats and dogs, adverse effects were observed in a number of organs, primarily in the 
kidneys, liver, digestive tract, thyroid gland, lympho /haematopoietic system, endocrine system, 
reproductive system and skin. 
Compared to dogs, rats and mice appear to be more sensitive regarding effects particularly on 
kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and teeth, but less sensitive regarding effects particularly on skin 
and liver. 
Prominent clinical signs in rats after repeated dosing consisted of changes in the teeth structure 
with markedly increased growth. Histologically, dentin and amenoblast degeneration were 
observed. 
Alterations with regard to increased growth of teeth (histologically associated with dentin and 
amenoblast degeneration) and bones (thickening of growth plate, chondrodystrophy) are related 
to the pharmacological mode of action of regorafenib but are considered not to present a 
potential risk for adult humans, because in adults these organs are not subject to growth. 
However, they do indicate a potential risk for children and adolescents. 
Furthermore, in the 6-month rat study, an increased incidence of thickening of the 
atrioventricular valves of the heart was observed at 2 mg/kg. This effect was not observed in the 
Assessment report

4 and 13 week study in rats using higher doses and it might be an accelerated age-related 
physiological process. Monitoring of cardiovascular parameters including QT interval in the dog 
repeat-dose studies revealed no adverse effects attributed to regorafenib. 
Interstitial oedema and atrophy of the tongue were seen in mice and rats, respectively, and is of 
unknown relevance. However, due to mucolytic activity of the compound, patients experiencing 
pain in the mouth are suspended from treatment and an effect like atrophy is not expected. 
Indeed, there were no reports of tongue atrophy or atrophic glossitis in the clinical trial program. 
Clinical relevance of this finding is therefore unlikely. 
Dogs developed bloody diarrhoea, emesis, alopecia, stomatitis and occasionally bleeding 
gums/anaemia and swelling of eyelids. Hair growth arrest was observed together with other skin 
alterations such as epidermal and follicular hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, comedo formation, 
acanthosis, hypergranulosis, pigment clumping, peri-folliculitis, crusts, fibrosis, lymphoid cell 
infiltration and retention of sebaceous. In the 12-month study, female dogs showed additionally 
signs of an effect on the hormone balance (increased incidence of vulva swelling, decreased 
incidence of mammary complex swelling). 
The severity and extent of adverse effects in the repeat dose toxicity studies were dependent on 
dose and duration of exposure. The MTD declined with the prolongation of treatment in rats and 
dogs. 
Findings in serum chemistry, analysis of liver tissue, and urinalysis in the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies with administration of regorafenib comprised changes indicating an influence on liver 
function (increased serum transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) activities, 
increased bilirubin), kidneys (increased serum creatinin, proteinuria) and thyroid (increased 
thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], reduced T4). Haematology findings indicated slight but 
inconsistent changes in red and white blood cell parameters (reduced erythrocyte counts, 
haemoglobin, haematocrit; increased neutrophil counts; atypical leucocytes) and blood 
coagulation (reduced or increased platelet counts; reduced clotting time). 
Regorafenib was tested in a battery of genotoxicity tests, and was shown to have no genotoxic 
potential. No carcinogenicity studies have been performed with regorafenib. This is in line with 
ICH S9 guideline (Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals, 
EMEA/CHMP/ICH/646107/2008) and considered acceptable taking into account the intended 
indication as well as the short life-expectancy of patients for which regorafenib is currently 
intended. 
Specific studies with regorafenib on fertility and early embryonic development were not 
submitted. However, an impact of regorafenib can be expected based on the pharmacological 
mode of action and findings in the general repeat-dose toxicity studies, i.e. morphological 
changes in the testes, ovaries, and the uterus observed after repeated dosing in rats and dogs at 
exposures below the anticipated human exposure (based on AUC comparison). The observed 
changes were only partially reversible. Pilot embryo-foetal toxicity studies have been performed 
in two species, rats and rabbits, whereas the main study was only performed in rabbits. This is 
acceptable, since it was shown that regorafenib is embryolethal and teratogenic in rabbits, and 
therefore confirmation in a second species is not considered necessary. Of note, teratogenicity 
was also seen in the rat pilot study.

There are no data on the effect of Stivarga on human fertility. Women of childbearing potential 
must be informed that regorafenib may cause foetal harm. Effective contraception in men and 
women should be ensured during treatment and up to 8 weeks after completion of therapy. 
There are no data on the use of regorafenib in pregnant women. Stivarga should not be used 
during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the 
mother and the risk to the foetus. Finally, it is unknown whether regorafenib or its metabolites 
are excreted in human milk. In rats, regorafenib or its metabolites are excreted in milk. A risk to 
the breast fed child cannot be excluded. Breast feeding must be discontinued during treatment 
with Stivarga. 
No pre- and postnatal development or juvenile toxicity studies were performed with regorafenib 
in line with the ICH S9 guideline which was considered acceptable. 
Special investigations on the immunotoxic potential of regorafenib performed in the frame of the 
13-week rat study (splenic cell count, FACS analysis, total anti-body titre, plaque forming cell 
assay after immunisation) revealed no indication for a toxicologically relevant effect. 
Regorafenib was found to be probably phototoxic in vitro. As there is no appropriate animal 
model for in vivo studies, no further studies were deemed necessary. Of note, no relevant signals 
emerged from the clinical studies. 
One impurity tested positive in the Ames test and Comet assay, but negative in the Micronucleus 
test. Since these tests evaluate different endpoints, a negative Micronucleus test does not 
overrule the Ames test, and the impurity may be considered as possibly mutagenic. Because the 
indication of regorafenib does allow for higher limits of impurities, and the results of the 
genotoxicity tests also indicate only a weak genotoxic potential with unlikely relevance for 
humans, the proposed specification limit is acceptable. 
In terms of local tolerance, various morphological changes (in particular signs of degenerative 
and regenerative processes in the stomach and duodenum in mice and rats) and clinical signs of 
gastrointestinal intolerance (bloody diarrhoea and emesis in dogs) were noted in the 
gastrointestinal tract of animals treated orally by gavage. The observed effects are most likely 
due to the expected mechanism-related impact of regorafenib on rapidly dividing cells. 
Regorafenib is potentially PBT (persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic). The criterion can only be 
concluded after evaluation of the additionally requested aquatic studies. The substance is very 
persistent (vP). It is also bioaccumulative, but not very bioaccumulative (vB).  
The revised PECsurface water was calculated at 0.112 Âµg/L. The K oc will have to be determined using 
an OECD 106 study. PECsoil and PECsediment can only be (re)calculated after the results of this 
study are available. A risk to the STP (Sewage Treatment Plants) is considered unlikely. Apart 
from the OECD 106 study, the dossier was complete. However the chronic studies with algae, 
Daphnia and fish are considered unreliable, the results cannot be used in the risk assessment. In 
conclusion, the risk assessment for the surface water, groundwater, soil and sediment 
compartment cannot be completed. In the light of this outcome, the CHMP agreed that 
precautionary statements in the product information regarding the disposal of the medicine into 
the environment have to be adopted and the SmPC and PL were updated in accordance.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From the non-clinical standpoint, there are no major objections against authorisation, however 
additional data is needed for completion of the environmental risk assessment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Regorafenib pharmacokinetics was evaluated following oral administration of single doses to 
healthy volunteers and single or multiple doses to cancer patients.  In the evaluation of the 
pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, consideration needs to be given to the fact that two metabolites 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 29/91 
 
  
  
 
 
of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5, have demonstrated in vitro pharmacologic activity similar to that of 
unchanged regorafenib. Therefore, the evaluation of metabolite PK for M-2 and M-5 was included 
in all PK studies. 
Overall, 11 Phase 1 trials have been conducted with regorafenib as a single-agent: 5 in healthy 
volunteers  and  6  in  advanced  cancer  patients.  The  healthy  volunteer  studies  were  conducted 
using  single  doses  of  regorafenib  and  included  a  total  of  124  subjects  in  Europe  and  the  USA 
addressing  the  relative  bioavailability  of  the  final  tablet  formulation  (study  12437),  food  effect 
(study  14656),  mass  balance  and  metabolite  profile  (study  12436),  and  the  interaction  of 
regorafenib with ketoconazole and rifampin (studies 12435 and 15524, respectively). 
Two of the Phase 1 studies in patients with advanced solid tumours were dose escalation studies 
to define the maximum tolerated dose of two different dosing schedules: intermittent dosing - 3 
weeks  on  /  1  week  off  treatment  (study  11650)  and  continuous  dosing  (study  11651).  The 
recommended Phase 2 dose of 160 mg in the intermittent dosing schedule was applied in the two 
Asian trials (14996 and 13172, both in patients with advanced solid tumours). Finally, a cocktail 
drug drug interaction study (12434), and a study (14814) to evaluate cardiovascular safety were 
conducted.  
Adequately validated methods were used to analyse regorafenib and metabolites M-2 and M-5 in 
plasma and urine. 
Absorption  
Following oral administration of a single 160 mg dose with tablets, regorafenib is absorbed with a 
median t max ranging from approximately 3 to 4 hours with a mean maximum concentration 
(Cmax) of 2.5 mg/L. The plasma concentration time curve was characterised by multiple peaks 
and slow elimination of regorafenib. After a single dose of 160 mg, plasma concentrations of the 
two active metabolites M-2 and M-5 were below those of parent compound. However, after 
multiple dosing at Day 21, due to the nonlinear accumulation of metabolites, plasma 
concentrations were similar for parent drug and metabolites. 
Due to the insolubility of the drug substance in aqueous media without surfactant, no i.v. 
solution (for human use) was developed to conduct an absolute bioavailability (BA) study. 
Following single dose administration of 60 and 100 mg doses, the relative bioavailability of the 
final solid solution formulation of regorafenib tablets was approximately 70% -83% of the 2% 
w/v oral solution. Comparative bioavailability of conventional immediate release tablets was 
<10% of the oral solution, therefore conventional immediate release tablets were not used in the 
clinical studies. All studies were conducted with solid solution tablets or in some phase 1 studies 
as 2% w/v solution. Based on results in mass balance study 12436, showing 19% of radioactivity 
excreted in urine and 24% excreted in faeces in the form of metabolites following single dose 
administration of 120 mg oral solution, it can be estimated that at least 30-35% of regorafenib is 
being absorbed following administration of solid solution tablets. 
In  vitro  investigations  using  a  validated  Caco-2  assay  showed  that  regorafenib  belongs  to  the 
class  of  highly  permeable  substances.  Regorafenib  therefore  classifies  as  a  Class  II  drug 
according to the criteria of the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS).

Relative bioavailability and bioequivalence of different regorafenib formulations employed in the 
course of clinical development was demonstrated (data not shown).  
Bioavailability (AUC) of regorafenib was increased by approximately 48% and 36% when 
administered with a high-fat and low-fat breakfast, respectively, compared with dosing under 
fasting conditions (study 14656).  Corresponding increases in Cmax were 73% (high fat) and 54% 
(low-fat). AUC and Cmax of the metabolites M-2 and M-5 were higher when regorafenib was 
given with a low fat breakfast compared to fasting conditions and lower when given with high fat 
meal compared to fasting conditions. The highest cumulative exposure of regorafenib and its 
metabolites was achieved when administered following a low fat breakfast. 
Distribution 
From Study 11650 the reported geometric mean volume of distribution for the 120 mg and 
160 mg tablet doses was 99 L (range 87-137L) and 93 L (range 37-178 L), respectively. In 
human blood, regorafenib was mainly distributed into plasma with a concentration ratio 
(plasma/blood) (Cp/Cb) of 1.59 in the concentration range 1.49 to 40.7 mg/L. 
Regorafenib,  M-2  and  M-5  are  highly  bound  to  plasma  proteins  >  99%  over  a  therapeutically 
relevant  concentration  range.  In  vitro  binding  experiments  showed  that  regorafenib  was  not 
displaced  from  the  binding  site  by  warfarin,  taxol,  salicylic  acid,  gefitinib,  ibuprofen,  digitoxin, 
cisplatin, furosemide, nifedipine, propranolol, and docetaxel at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Quantitative tissue distribution studies in rats involving oral or intravenous administration of 
[14C] regorafenib revealed that radioactivity was thoroughly distributed to almost all organs and 
tissues. Blood concentrations of radioactivity were similar to the concentrations found in most 
organs and tissues. Blood-brain barrier penetration was low. 
Elimination 
Regorafenib was eliminated from plasma with a half-life of 20 to 40 hours following a single oral 
dose in healthy volunteers and in cancer patients. A similar range of half-life estimates (20 â€“ 30 
hours) was found for metabolite M-2. The elimination half-life of M-5 was slower, averaging 
approximately 60 hours, with individual values ranging from 40 to 100 hours. 
In study 12436, it was shown that regorafenib was excreted in urine and faeces as unchanged 
drug and metabolites after oral administration of 120 mg [14C]regorafenib solution to four 
healthy volunteers. Renal elimination of total radioactivity accounted for approximately 19% of 
dose, while approximately 71% of the dose was recovered in faeces as both unchanged drug 
(47%) and metabolites (24%). Urinary excretion of radioactivity was almost complete by 
72 hours post-dose, whereas excretion via faeces continued until 144 hours post-dose, after 
which the rate of excretion exhibited a near plateau. While M-2 and M-5 are the metabolites 
circulating in plasma, M-7 and M-8 (glucuronides of regorafenib and M-2, respectively) are 
excreted in urine. In faeces, regorafenib was the most predominant metabolite followed by M-6 
and M-7. 
In another study (11650), following administration of a 120 mg tablet at steady state (Day 21), 
a mean of 8.4% of the dose was recovered in urine over 24 hours as either M-8 (1.6%) or M-7 
Assessment report

(6.8%). The corresponding excretion for the 160 mg tablet dose was lower, 0.5% as M-8 and 
1.9% as M-7. 
Regorafenib undergoes extensive and complex metabolism, including oxidation and 
glucuronidation. In man, CYP3A4 is the major CYP isoform for phase I (oxidative) metabolism of 
regorafenib to form M-2 and M-3. M-2 and M-3 are further metabolised to M-5. Glucuronidation 
of regorafenib was catalysed by human liver and kidney microsomes fortified with UGPGA. UDP-
glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A9 was identified to be responsible for conjugation of 
regorafenib with glucuronic acid, to form M-7. M-5 is not further metabolised but reduction to 
M-4 may take place by microflora in the gut. Also the metabolites M-7, M-8 and M-2 may be 
reduced and/or cleaved in the intestinal milieu to form regorafenib resulting in enterohepatic 
cycling in vivo. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib at different doses from oral solution and tablet dosage form 
was investigated in studies 11650 (doses 10-220 mg, intermittent schedule) and 11651 (20-
140 mg, continuous administration). Following single dose administration, AUC and Cmax of 
regorafenib increased with increasing dose, though not in proportion to dose. Administration of a 
solution (10-120 mg) resulted in dose-dependent increases in systemic exposure up to the 100 
mg dose while a linear increase in exposure was not achieved when escalating to 120 mg 
solution. Regorafenib was administered as solid solution tablets at doses of 60, 100, 120, 160, 
and 220 mg to separate cohorts of cancer patients. AUC(0-tlast), and Cmax values were 
consistent with dose proportionality over the dose range of 60 to 160 mg after a single dose. 
Plasma concentrations of the two major metabolites M-2 and M-5 were measured along with 
parent drug. At low doses (below 60 mg), the plasma concentrations of both metabolites after a 
single dose of regorafenib were lower than those of regorafenib. A sharp increase in metabolite 
exposure was seen when the dose was increased from 30 to 60 mg. A more gradual increase up 
to 220 mg dose was observed. 
Following multiple dose administration, regorafenib exposure at steady-state seemed not to 
increase significantly at doses â‰¥ 60 mg. At doses < 60 mg, the plasma concentrations of both 
metabolites was relatively low but increased at doses â‰¥ 60 mg. Pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, 
M-2 and M-5 is not dose proportional after multiple dosing. 
Time dependent pharmacokinetics was assessed by comparing pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, 
M-2 and M-5 at day 21 with single dose administration of 160 mg regorafenib in study 11650. 
Mean steady-state Cmax,ss and AUC(0-24)ss values following dosing with 160 mg were 3.9 mg/L 
and 58.0 mg*hr/L, respectively. The accumulation of regorafenib at steady-state was 
approximately 2-fold as expected considering the mean elimination half-life of 20 â€“ 40 hours. 
Plasma concentrations of both metabolites were below those of parent compound following single 
dose administration but by Day 21, plasma concentrations were similar for parent drug and 
metabolites due to the nonlinear accumulation of metabolites. Accumulation was greater for M-2 
(5-fold) and M-5 (up to 67-fold) than for regorafenib itself.

Special populations 
In study 11650, PK analyses were performed on subgroups of patients based on renal function. 
No consistent differences in AUC or Cmax were found between patients with mild renal 
impairment and those with normal renal function. When pooling phase 1/2 studies, the mean 
AUC(0-24)ss of 38 mgh/L for the normal renal function group was considerably lower than the 
value of 50 â€“ 60 mgh/L seen in healthy volunteers with normal renal function. No trends were 
observed for M-2 and M-5. 
The effect of hepatic impairment on pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 was studied in 
hepatocellular carcinoma patients in study 11651 and in study 14596. Mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment did not affect regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 pharmacokinetics following single dose 
administration. PK of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 at steady-state has been estimated by 
population-based PK modelling. The effect of hepatic impairment on the PK was estimated. It 
was estimated that exposure to regorafenib increased 2.2-fold in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment. 
Pharmacokinetics of regorafenib was similar in males and females. 
Analysis of ethnic differences in PK focused on Asians and Caucasians. Separate studies were 
conducted in Japanese (Study 13172), Chinese (Study 14996), and Korean (Study 14596) 
cancer patients in which regorafenib was administered at a dose of 160 mg daily and PK data 
were collected. The exposure of regorafenib in various Asian populations (Chinese, Japanese, 
Korean) is within the same range as seen in Caucasians. 
Analysis of pooled Phase 1/2 data showed a trend toward increased exposure at higher body 
weights. 
The PK of regorafenib was not dependent on age. Mean steady-state AUC(0-24) and Cmax values 
of regorafenib for patients â‰¥ 65 years were similar to those for patents < 65 years. Although 
mean values suggested a higher exposure of M-2 and M-5 in patients > 65 years, there was no 
obvious trend. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Study 12435 was a single-centre, non-randomised, open-label 2-period cross-over study 
evaluating the effect of 400 mg ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the 
pharmacokinetics of 80 mg and 160 mg regorafenib single doses. Each subject received two 
single oral doses of regorafenib with an 18-day washout period between administrations. 
There was a 33% increase in mean regorafenib AUC and a 40% increase in mean Cmax following 
a 160 mg dose of regorafenib when given with ketoconazole. Following administration of 160 mg 
regorafenib, there was a 94% decrease in mean M-2 AUC and a 97% decrease in mean Cmax 
upon concomitant administration with ketoconazole. Similar to M-2, the mean M-5 AUC 
decreased 93% and the mean Cmax decreased 93% following administration of 160 mg 
regorafenib with ketoconazole. A similar pattern of inhibition was seen for regorafenib as well as 
M-2 and M-5 for the 80 mg dose of regorafenib.

Study 15524 was a single-centre, non-randomised, open-label 2-period cross-over study 
evaluating the effect of 600 mg rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of 160 mg regorafenib single 
dose. Each subject received two single oral doses of regorafenib with a 14-day washout period 
between administrations. 
There was a statistically significant decrease in both AUC and Cmax (approximately 50% and 
20% in mean, respectively) of regorafenib, when administered concomitantly with rifampicin. 
There was no significant change in metabolite M-2 AUC as the 90% confidence interval included 
100%, although there was a significant increase in Cmax (58%) when regorafenib was 
administered concomitantly with rifampicin. There was a greater than 3-fold increase in 
metabolite M-5 AUC and greater than 4-fold increase in Cmax when regorafenib was administered 
concomitantly with rifampicin. 
A probe substrate study was performed (Study 12434) to evaluate the effect of regorafenib on 
the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates of CYP2C8 (rosiglitazone), CYP2C9 (s-warfarin), 
CYP2C19 (omeprazole) and CYP3A4 (midazolam). No meaningful effects on the PK of 
rosiglitazone, S-warfarin, omeprazole and midazolam were observed. 
A drug-drug interaction study was performed (Study 11656) evaluating the combination of 
regorafenib with mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin/folinic acid/5-FU) or FOLFIRI (irinotecan/folinic acid/5-
FU). On Days 4 - 10 and 18 - 24, patients received 160 mg regorafenib once daily for Cycles 1-6. 
For Cycle 7 onward, regorafenib was administered in a 21 days on / 7 days off schedule. A cycle 
was defined as 28 days. Both irinotecan and SN-38, its active metabolite, had significantly higher 
AUCs in Cycle 2 compared to Cycle 1, i.e. they were higher when given 5 days after regorafenib 
treatment compared with administration without preceding regorafenib administration. For 
irinotecan, the AUC in the presence of regorafenib was increased 28% with a 90% confidence 
interval of 107 to 154%; and for SN-38, the AUC in the presence of regorafenib was increased 
44% with a 90% confidence interval of 112 to 185%. There were no significant differences with 
respect to Cmax. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Regorafenib exhibited no inductive potential on major CYP isoforms (e.g. CYP1A2 and 3A4). 
Regorafenib potently inhibited CYP2C8 (Ki = 0.6 ÂµM), and also considerably inhibited CYP2C9 
(Ki = 4.7 ÂµM) and CYP2B6 (Ki = 5.2 ÂµM). The inhibitory potency towards CYP3A4 (Ki = 11.1 ÂµM) 
and CYP2C19 (Ki = 16.4 ÂµM) was less pronounced. Regorafenib is an inhibitor of Pgp and BRCP. 
M-2 potently inhibited CYP2C8 (Ki = 1.0 ÂµM) and CYP2C9 (Ki = 0.8 ÂµM with diclofenac as 
substrate) and also considerably affected CYP3A4 (Ki = 4.0 ÂµM, testosterone as substrate) as 
well as CYP2D6 (K = 7.8 ÂµM). Weak to moderate inhibitory potency was observed for M-2 
towards CYP2B6 (IC50 = 20 ÂµM), and CYP3A4 (IC50 = 22 ÂµM with midazolam as substrate). 
M-5 potently inhibited CYP2C8 (Ki = 1.3 Î¼M), whereas CYP2B6 was weakly inhibited (IC50 = 47 
ÂµM). M-5 did not alter the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, 
and CYP3A4. Additionally, no significant time-dependent inhibition on CYP3A4 following 30 min 
pre-incubation of M-5 with NADPH-supplemented human liver microsomes was observed.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical studies addressing the mechanism of action were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Biomarkers evaluation in the clinical studies included KRAS mutational status (dose finding study 
11650 and pivotal phase 3 study 14387-CORRECT) and plasma protein levels VEGF and VEGFR2 
in studies 11650 and 11726 in RCC patients and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in 
study 11650. Additionally, in the pivotal study, genetic biomarker analyses were performed: the 
mutational status of three proto-oncogenes commonly associated with CRC (KRAS, PIK3CA and 
BRAF) was evaluated. Plasma protein biomarkers evaluated included those associated with 
angiogenesis (ANG-2, IL-6, IL-8, PlGF, VEGFR-1, TIE-1, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGFA- 121), 
as well others with known or hypothesised roles in CRC pathogenesis (BMP-7, VWF, M-CSF, SDF-
1 and TIMP-2). 
KRAS mutational status was evaluated in two studies: the dose finding study 11650 and the 
pivotal phase 3 study 14387 (CORRECT). In Study 11650 (Phase 1 mCRC), KRAS mutational 
status was evaluated using plasma DNA. Plasma samples from 54% (20/37) of the evaluable 
patients were found to be KRAS mutant and 46% (17/37) were found to be KRAS wild type. The 
median PFS was 84 days for KRAS mutant patients and 161 days for KRAS wild type patients. In 
Study 14387 (pivotal Phase 3 mCRC), historical (pre-existing) KRAS mutational data was 
available from 96% (729/760) of all randomised patients, of which 59% (430/729) were 
reported as KRAS mutant and 41% (299/729) as KRAS wild type. Subgroup analyses evaluating 
PFS by KRAS mutational status showed trends in favour of regorafenib-treated patients in both 
KRAS wild type and KRAS mutant subgroups [KRAS wild type: HR of 0.475 (95% CI: 0.362, 
0.623); KRAS mutant: HR of 0.525 (95% CI: 0.425, 0.649)]. Correlative analysis also indicated 
a trend towards a survival benefit for regorafenib as compared to placebo in the KRAS wild type 
subgroup (regorafenib/placebo HR: 0.653 [95% CI: 0.476, 0.895]) as well as in the KRAS 
mutant subgroup (regorafenib/placebo HR: 0.867 [95% CI: 0.670, 1.123]). 
PIK3CA mutational status was available from 66% of all randomised patients, of which 17% were 
PIK3A mutant and 83% were PIK3CA wild type. Correlative analysis for OS indicated trends in 
favour of regorafenib in both PIK3CA wild type (regorafenib/placebo HR: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.57, 
0.99]) and PIK3CA mutant (regorafenib/placebo HR: 0.84 [95% CI: 0.47, 1.50]) subgroups. The 
interaction p-value among these subgroups was 0.723, indicating no significant difference in 
regorafenib clinical efficacy (vs. placebo) related to PIK3CA mutational status. BRAF mutational 
status was determined from 66% of all randomised patients, of which 3.4% were BRAF mutant 
and 96.6% were BRAF wild type. Due to the small number of BRAF mutant patients, a correlative 
analysis was not conducted based on BRAF mutational status. 
Data from study 11650 and study 11726 revealed biological effects of regorafenib treatment that 
were in line with the activity of this compound at inhibiting VEGF signalling, i.e. increased levels 
of VEGF and decreased levels of VEGFR2 with regorafenib treatment. In study 11650, increased 
levels of VEGF and decreased levels of VEGFR2 with regorafenib treatment were observed with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 35/91 
 
  
  
regorafenib doses â‰¥ 60 mg.  A DCE-MRI was performed at baseline, on Day 2 of Cycle 1, Day 21 
of Cycles 1 - 4 and afterwards every second cycle, as well as at the final visit to assess tumour 
blood flow / tumour vessel permeability in a subgroup of patients. A decrease in the iAUC60 for 
the gadolinium curve as measured by DCE-MRI was observed at regorafenib doses â‰¥ 120 mg.  
In study 11726, levels of VEGF increased and VEGFR2 decreased with regorafenib treatment. The 
consistency of the change in VEGFR2 is exemplified by the finding that each of the 28 patients 
evaluated exhibited a decrease in plasma VEGFR2 levels with regorafenib treatment. Other 
plasma proteins were found to be altered with regorafenib treatment. Some of these proteins 
have been linked to angiogenesis (TIE1, ANG2), where others represent kinase receptors 
inhibited by regorafenib (c-KIT) or proteins released following apoptotic cell death (CK18M30). 
A dedicated cardiovascular study of advanced cancer patients (Study 14814) was conducted to 
evaluate cardiovascular safety for the 160 mg once daily dosing with regorafenib. Fifty-four (54) 
patients were enrolled in this cardiovascular safety study and all patients received at least one 
dose of 160 mg once daily regorafenib in this clinical evaluation of potential changes in QT/QTc 
on ECG and in LVEF. The primary variable with regard to QT/QTc was the change in QTcF from 
the tmax of regorafenib on Cycle 1 or 2, Day 21 to the average of the baseline QT intervals from 
the ECGs collected over 24 hours on Cycle 1, Day -1, and corrected using Fridericia's method for 
heart rate correction; Bazettâ€™s correction was also calculated. In addition, left ventricular ejection 
fraction (LVEF) was to be assessed by MUGA (multi gated acquisition) scan at baseline and at 
least once under on-going regorafenib treatment, typically after a minimum 2 cycles of 
regorafenib treatment. 
The range of AUC and Cmax values in this study fall within the full range of that seen in previous 
studies, and the median tmax (3 hours) is also similar to that seen in other studies. At the tmax 
of regorafenib, the mean changes from baseline in QTcB and QTcF were -1 and 2 msec, 
respectively and in both cases, the 90% confidence interval did not include the value 10 msec. 
Additionally, a secondary analysis of the QT/QTc variables evaluated the maximal change from 
baseline in QTcB and QTcF over the 24-hour measurement period on Day 21. Results for the 
QTcB and QTcF maximal median change from baseline were 7 and 9 msec, respectively. No 
patient had a QTcB or QTcF value > 500 msec during the post-treatment Holter monitoring visits 
(at Cycle 1 or 2, Day 21). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Regorafenib reaches mean peak plasma levels of about 2.5 mg/l at about 3 to 4 hours after a 
single oral dose of 160 mg given as 4 tablets each containing 40 mg.  Following single doses of 
60 mg or 100 mg, the average relative bioavailability of tablets compared to an oral solution was 
69% and 83%, respectively. 
Two metabolites of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5, have demonstrated in vitro pharmacologic activity 
similar to that of unchanged regorafenib. Although regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 have shown similar 
activity in vitro, the contribution of each moiety to clinical efficacy and toxicity is not known. 
Systemic exposure of regorafenib at steady state increases dose proportionally up to 60 mg and 
less than proportionally at doses greater than 60 mg. Accumulation of regorafenib at steady 
state results in about a 2 fold increase in plasma concentrations, which is consistent with the 
elimination half-life and dosing frequency. At steady state, regorafenib reaches mean peak 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 36/91 
 
  
  
plasma levels of about 3.9 mg/L (8.1 micromolar) after oral administration of 160 mg 
regorafenib and the peak to trough ratio of mean plasma concentrations is less than 2. On the 
other hand, both metabolites, M 2 and M 5, exhibit non-linear accumulation, which might be 
caused by entero-hepatic recycling or saturation of the UGT1A9 pathway discussed below.  
This supports the dose selection for which maximal exposure to all three active moieties was 
taken into consideration. The increase in total exposure to the 3 active moieties may also 
support the 3/1 on/off schedule over the continuous schedule because higher plasma 
concentrations of combination regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 can be achieved with the 160 mg dose 
compared to the 100 mg dose and also a higher cumulative exposure of regorafenib and its 
metabolites can be obtained with the 160 mg 3/1 on/off schedule. Finally, whereas plasma 
concentrations of M 2 and M 5 after a single dose of regorafenib are much lower than those of 
parent compound, steady state plasma concentrations of M 2 and M 5 are comparable to those of 
regorafenib.  
The concentrations of regorafenib and its major pharmacologically active metabolites (M-2 and 
M-5) were highest when given after a low fat (light) breakfast as compared to either a high fat 
breakfast or fasting condition. The exposure for regorafenib was increased by 48% when 
administered with a high fat breakfast, and 36% when administered with a low fat breakfast, 
compared to fasting. The exposure of metabolites M-2 (N oxide) and M-5 (N oxide and 
N desmethyl) is higher when regorafenib is given with a low fat breakfast as compared to fasting 
condition and lower when given with a high fat meal as compared to fasting condition. 
The increase in exposure of regorafenib following intake of food is in line with the poor solubility 
characteristics  of  regorafenib.  Alternatively,  food  constituents  may  enhance  absorption  of 
regorafenib.  To  maximize  exposure  to  parent  drug  as  well  as  to  the  active  metabolites  it  is 
recommended  for  regorafenib  to  be  dosed  after  a  low-fat  (light)  meal.  This  was  consistently 
recommended in the clinical studies.  
Plasma concentration-time profiles for regorafenib as well as for the major circulating 
metabolites showed multiple peaks across the 24-hour dosing interval, which are attributed to 
enterohepatic circulation. In vitro protein binding of regorafenib to human plasma proteins is 
high (99.5%).In vitro protein binding of M-2 and M-5 is higher (99.8% and 99.95%, 
respectively) than that of regorafenib.  
Metabolites M-2 and M-5 are weak substrates of P-gp. Metabolite M-5 is a weak BCRP-substrate. 
Regorafenib is metabolised primarily in the liver by oxidative metabolism mediated by CYP3A4, 
as well as by glucuronidation mediated by UGT1A9. Two major and six minor metabolites of 
regorafenib have been identified in plasma. The main circulating metabolites of regorafenib in 
human plasma are M-2 (N oxide) and M-5 (N oxide and N desmethyl), which are 
pharmacologically active and have similar concentrations as regorafenib at steady state. M-2 is 
further metabolised by oxidative metabolism mediated by CYP3A4, as well as by glucuronidation 
mediated by UGT1A9. Metabolites may be reduced or hydrolysed in the gastrointestinal tract by 
microbial flora, allowing reabsorption of the unconjugated active substance and metabolites 
(enterohepatic circulation). Co administration of antibiotics that affect the flora of the 
gastrointestinal tract may interfere with the enterohepatic circulation of regorafenib and may 
result in a decreased regorafenib exposure. The clinical significance of these potential 
interactions is unknown, but may result in a decreased efficacy of regorafenib.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 37/91 
 
  
  
Moreover, bile salt-sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and cholestagel may interact 
with regorafenib by forming insoluble complexes which may impact absorption (or reabsorption), 
thus resulting in potentially decreased exposure. The clinical significance of these potential 
interactions is unknown, but may result in a decreased efficacy of regorafenib. 
Administration of ketoconazole (400 mg for 18 days), a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, with a single 
dose of regorafenib (160 mg on day 5) resulted in an increase in mean exposure (AUC) of 
regorafenib of approximately 33%, and a decrease in mean exposure of the active metabolites, 
M 2 (N oxide) and M 5 (N oxide and N desmethyl), of approximately 90%. It is recommended to 
avoid concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 activity (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit 
juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, telithromycin and voriconazole) as their 
influence on the steady state exposure of regorafenib and its metabolites has not been studied. 
Co-administration of a strong UGT1A9 inhibitor (e.g. mefenamic acid, diflunisal, and niflumic 
acid) during regorafenib treatment should be avoided, as their influence on the steady-state 
exposure of regorafenib and its metabolites has not been studied. 
Administration of rifampicin (600 mg for 9 days), a strong CYP3A4 inducer, with a single dose of 
regorafenib (160 mg on day 7) resulted in a reduction in AUC of regorafenib of approximately 
50%, a 3  to 4 fold increase in mean exposure of the active metabolite M 5, and no change in 
exposure of active metabolite M 2. Other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenytoin, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. Johnâ€™s wort) may also increase metabolism of regorafenib. 
Strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided, or selection of an alternate concomitant medicinal 
product, with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4 should be considered. 
In vitro data indicate that regorafenib as well as its active metabolite M 2 inhibit glucuronidation 
mediated by UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 whereas M 5 only inhibits UGT1A1 at concentrations which are 
achieved in vivo at steady state. Administration of regorafenib with a 5 day break prior to 
administration of irinotecan resulted in an increase of approximately 44% in AUC of SN 38, a 
substrate of UGT1A1 and an active metabolite of irinotecan. An increase in AUC of irinotecan of 
approximately 28% was also observed. This indicates that co administration of regorafenib may 
increase systemic exposure to UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 substrates. 
Following oral administration, mean elimination half-life for regorafenib and its metabolite M 2 in 
plasma ranged from 20 to 30 hours in different studies. The mean elimination half-life for the 
metabolite M 5 is approximately 60 hours (range from 40 to 100 hours).  
Approximately 90% of the radioactive dose was recovered within 12 days after administration, 
with about 71% of the dose excreted in faeces (47% as parent compound, 24% as metabolites), 
and about 19% of the dose excreted in urine as glucuronides. Urinary excretion of glucuronides 
decreased below 10% under steady state conditions. Parent compound found in faeces could be 
derived from intestinal degradation of glucuronides or reduction of metabolite M 2 (N oxide), as 
well as unabsorbed regorafenib. 
The inter- and intra-individual variability in exposure to regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 is rather high. 
A pop PK analysis was used to evaluate covariate effects in study 14387 and to derive exposure 
parameters which can be used for exposure-response analysis of this study. Intrinsic factors 
identified during the covariate analysis of the population PK evaluation were baseline bilirubin for 
regorafenib, baseline bilirubin and body weight for M-2, as well as baseline bilirubin, body weight

Page 38/91 
 
  
  
and sex for M-5. Bilirubin and weight increased exposure to regorafenib and M-2 by 20%. M-5 
exposure was 77% higher in females than males but overall, the covariates did reduce the 
variability only modestly. 
Overall, age did not affect the regorafenib pharmacokinetics over the studied age range (29 â€“ 85 
years). The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib is not influenced by gender. The exposure of 
regorafenib in various Asian populations (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) is within the same range as 
seen in Caucasians. 
No major difference in pharmacokinetics in mild and moderate hepatic impairment following 
single dose administration of 100 mg regorafenib was observed. No data were available for 
pharmacokinetics in hepatic impairment following multiple dose administration because most 
patients had dose interruptions or needed a dose reduction during the first cycle. PK of 
regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 at steady-state has been estimated by popPK modelling. The effect of 
hepatic impairment on the PK was estimated. It was estimated that exposure to regorafenib 
increased 2.2-fold in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Considering the aggregated of 
total (bound and unbound) of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 together, the increase 1.3-fold in 
exposure in moderate hepatic impairment is modest. It is considered that these data are not 
enough for dose recommendations in moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data for 
patients with severe hepatic impairment. Regorafenib is mainly eliminated via the liver, and 
exposure might be increased in this patient population. 
No dedicated study was conducted to study pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment. 
This is acceptable as excretion in urine of unchanged regorafenib was low (<1%) and excretion 
of the metabolites M-7 and M-8 in urine was <10% at steady-state. Available clinical data and 
physiology based pharmacokinetic modelling indicate similar steady state exposure of 
regorafenib and its metabolites M 2 and M 5 in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment 
compared to patients with normal renal function. 
The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib has not been studied in patients with severe renal 
impairment or end stage renal disease. However, physiology based pharmacokinetic modelling 
does not predict any relevant change in exposure in these patients.

In vitro data indicate that regorafenib is an inhibitor of BCRP (IC50 values about 40 70 
nanomolar) and P glycoprotein (IC50 value of about 2 micromolar). Co administration of 
regorafenib may increase the plasma concentrations of concomitant BCRP substrates, such as 
methotrexate, or P glycoprotein substrates, such as digoxin.  
In vitro data indicate that regorafenib is a competitive inhibitor of the cytochromes CYP2C8 (Ki 
value of 0.6 micromolar), CYP2C9 (Ki value of 4.7 micromolar), CYP2B6 (Ki value of 5.2 
micromolar) at concentrations which are achieved in vivo at steady state (peak plasma 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 39/91 
 
  
  
concentration of 8.1 micromolar). The in vitro inhibitory potency towards CYP3A4 (Ki value of 
11.1 micromolar) and CYP2C19 (Ki value of 16.4 micromolar) was less pronounced.  
A clinical probe substrate study was performed to evaluate the effect of 14 days of dosing with 
160 mg regorafenib on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates of CYP2C8 (rosiglitazone) 
CYP2C9 (S warfarin), CYP 2C19 (omeprazole) and CYP3A4 (midazolam). 
Pharmacokinetic data indicate that regorafenib may be given concomitantly with substrates of 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 without a clinically meaningful drug interaction (see 
also section 4.4). 
Regorafenib is an oral anti-tumour agent that can inhibit multiple protein kinases, including 
kinases involved in tumour angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2), oncogenesis (KIT, RET, RAF-1, 
BRAF, BRAFV600E), and the tumour microenvironment (PDGFR, FGFR). In the supportive study 
11650, an effect on VEGF signalling was observed at regorafenib doses â‰¥ 60 mg but no clear 
exposure effect relation was apparent. In the extension cohort, VEGFR2 was decreased compared 
to baseline in all mCRC patients. Similar findings have been previously described for other agents 
that inhibit VEGFR/VEGFR2 signalling and in fact are considered to be a â€˜class effectâ€™ for these 
types of agents. 
Genetic biomarker analysis has been conducted for KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF. Plasma protein 
biomarkers evaluated include those associated with angiogenesis (ANG-2, IL-6, IL-8, PlGF, 
VEGFR-1, TIE-1, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGFA- 121), as well others with known or 
hypothesised roles in CRC pathogenesis (BMP-7, VWF, M-CSF, SDF-1 and TIMP-2). None of the 
biomarkers analysed appear to be conclusively predictive of regorafenib clinical activity but some 
concerns over the provided biomarker analysis have been raised due to the limited number of 
tumour tissues available, the absence of fresh biopsies performed at study entry and concerns 
regarding the validity of genetic measurements performed on DNA isolated from fresh plasma. 
Moreover, based on the historical KRAS data capturing the majority (97%) of patients enrolled in 
the pivotal study, both KRAS subgroups appear to do better on regorafenib treatment than on 
placebo, with the KRAS wild type subgroup exhibiting a stronger positive effect (see also 
discussion on clinical efficacy). 
The results from the cardiovascular safety study are in-line with the pre-clinical safety 
pharmacology data indicating no relevant effect on cardiac repolarisation in vivo. The observed 
effects of regorafenib in humans at tmax on the QTc intervals of the ECG were minimal; the 
maximal median change was modest and unlikely to be of clinical significance in the setting of 
cancer treatment. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 have been investigated sufficiently. 
Information regarding interactions has been reflected in the SmPC and remaining uncertainties 
regarding interactions have been addressed in the RMP. 
Genetic biomarker analyses have been submitted. None of the biomarkers analysed appear to 
be predictive of regorafenib clinical activity.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Support for the efficacy of regorafenib in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer (mCRC) who have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, 
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, if KRAS wild type, an anti-
EGFR therapy comes from one pivotal phase III (CORRECT, 14387) trial. The results of the 
expansion cohort of the phase I 11650 study enrolling pre-treated patients with mCRC have been 
submitted as supportive, as well.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The proposed regorafenib dosing regimen of 160 mg orally once daily on a 3 weeks on/1 week 
off schedule in patients with metastatic CRC has been selected on the basis of nonclinical data 
and clinical efficacy and safety observed in the phase I dose escalation 11650 study. Data of 
another phase I study 11651 conducted with regorafenib administered orally once daily in a 
continuous regimen are also of relevance.  
In the phase I 11650 dose escalation study conducted in patients with advanced solid tumours 
(76 patients), with one expansion cohort in patients with metastatic CRC (23 patients), doses 
ranging from 10 mg once daily to 220 mg once daily as oral solution (10, 30, 60, 120 mg) or 
tablets (120, 160, 220 mg) were administered according to a 3 weeks on/1 week off schedule in 
repeated cycles of 4 weeks. The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of regorafenib was 160 mg 
once daily (as co-precipitate tablets; with DLTs of grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction and 
hypertension). Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a similar exposure at steady state for the 
parent compound regorafenib and the two pharmacologically active metabolites M-2 and M-5 at 
the MTD. Overall, 58% of all patients experienced disease control (PR+SD); 3 patients (RCC; 
CRC; osteosarcoma) achieved PR.

In the phase I study 11651, where regorafenib was administered orally once daily in a 
continuous regimen, a total of 84 patients were included, 38 patients in the dose escalation 
cohort, and 20 and 26 patients in two dose expansion cohorts in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), respectively. The MTD of regorafenib on the continuous 
dosing schedule was 100 mg once daily (with DLTs of grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction and 
hypertension). Overall, 37% of all patients experienced disease control (PR+SD); 4 patients (2 
HCC, 1 neuro-endocrine carcinoma and 1 squamous cell carcinoma of the preorbit) achieved PR. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study 14387 (CORRECT) 
Methods 
Study 14387 (CORRECT) was a pivotal multi-centre (114 study centres in 16 countries), 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study comparing regorafenib plus best 
supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC in patients with mCRC who have progressed after 
standard therapy which had to include all of the following: fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, 
irinotecan, bevacizumab and cetuximab or panitumumab (if KRAS wild type). 
Participants  
The CORRECT study population included patients with histologically or cytological confirmed 
metastatic CRC (Stage IV, adenocarcinoma), who experienced disease progression during or 
within 3 months following the last administration of approved standard therapies which had to 
include fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab and cetuximab or panitumumab (if 
KRAS wild type), unless contraindicated or stopped before disease progression due to 
unacceptable toxicity or not registered in the country where the study was performed. Patients 
treated with oxaliplatin in an adjuvant setting were to have progressed during or within 6 months 
of completion of adjuvant therapy. Patients who had progressed more than 6 months after 
completion of oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant treatment were to be retreated with oxaliplatin-
based therapy to be eligible. Patients with unknown KRAS status at screening were to have 
received prior anti-EGFR treatment. According to the inclusion criteria, patients were required to 
have an ECOG Performance Status score of 0-1, age â‰¥ 18 years, measurable or not measurable 
disease but evaluable by RECIST (version 1.1) and adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic 
functions. 
Patients with any CNS metastases were excluded as well as patients that received prior 
radiotherapy 2 or 4 weeks (depending on the extension of the field irradiated). Other main 
exclusion criteria were presence of uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris or new 
onset of angina within 3 months, myocardial infarction within 6 months, congestive heart failure 
â‰¥ New York Heart Association class 2, cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy 
(except beta blockers or digoxin), any bleeding diathesis or haemorrhage or bleeding â‰¥ CTCAE 
grade 3 within 4 weeks, healing wound, ulcer or bone fracture, persistent proteinuria of CTCAE 
gradeâ‰¥3 and arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events within 6 months prior to study 
entry. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 42/91 
 
  
  
Treatments 
Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive either regorafenib or matching placebo 160 mg (4 x 
40 mg tablets) once daily orally for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off therapy (cycle of 4 weeks) 
plus BSC. Patients were treated until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, clinical 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, and/or consent withdrawal. Regorafenib (film-coated, not 
divisible, gray-orange-red, oval, length 16 mm tablets) or placebo had to be taken in the 
morning with approximately 240 ml of water after a low-fat breakfast. Up to two regorafenib 
dose-reductions due to toxicity were allowed (from 160 mg to 120 mg to 80 mg). After 
implementation of a dose reduction, dose re-escalation was permitted provided that toxicities 
were resolved to baseline.  
After the primary study endpoint (OS) was met at the second pre-planned interim analysis 
according to the DMC, study protocol was amended (amendment 3) and patients on placebo 
treatment who had not yet progressed were offered to cross over to regorafenib in open label 
treatment. 
BSC included any concomitant medications or treatments: antibiotics, analgesics, radiation 
therapy for pain control (limited to bone metastases), corticosteroids, transfusions, 
psychotherapy, growth factors, palliative surgery, or any other symptomatic therapy necessary 
to provide BSC, except other investigational anti-tumour agents or anti-neoplastic 
chemo/hormonal/immuno-therapy. 
During treatment, caution was required in case of concomitant treatment with agents interfering 
with CYP enzymes or glucuronsyl transferases UGT1A1 and 1A9, due to possible drug-drug 
interactions with regorafenib. Use of bisphosphonates or erythropoietin in patients under chronic 
treatment was allowed. Concomitant radiotherapy was allowed if target lesion(s) were not 
included within the radiation field and no more than 10% of the bone marrow was irradiated. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the CORRECT trial was to show superiority of regorafenib plus BSC 
versus placebo plus BSC in terms of efficacy. Secondary objectives included comparisons in 
terms of safety and pharmacokinetics.  A biomarker analysis was also included as exploratory. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary study endpoint was overall survival (OS), defined as the time (days) from 
randomisation to death due to any cause. Patients alive at the time of analysis were censored at 
the last date known to be alive. Patients lost to follow-up were censored at day 1. 
Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS, defined as the time [days] from 
randomisation to first observed disease progression [radiological or clinical, as assessed by 
investigators] or death due to any cause, if death occurred before disease progression was 
documented), Objective response rate (ORR, defined as the percentage of patients with complete 
response [CR] or partial response [PR] according to RECIST 1.1), and disease control rate (DCR, 
defined as the percentage of patients with CR, PR or stable disease [SD]). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 43/91 
 
  
  
Regarding PFS, if progression occurred after 2 consecutive missed or non-evaluable assessments 
(progression later than date of last evaluable scan + 16 weeks + 1 week), PFS was censored at 
the date of last evaluable scan. Death without progression was a PFS event only if it occurred 
within the 16+1 weeks of the last evaluable tumour assessment. If it occurred later, PFS was 
censored at the date of last evaluable tumour assessment. For patients who discontinued or 
withdrew treatment before progression, PFS was censored on the date of the last evaluable 
tumour assessment unless the patients died within 16+1 weeks after the last evaluable 
assessment. In this case, death was considered a PFS event. For patients who changed 
anticancer therapy before progression, PFS was censored at the date of last scan performed prior 
to the change of therapy. 
Tumor assessments were performed at screening and then every 8 weeks during the treatment 
period until progression was documented, and also at the end of treatment visit, if applicable. 
Upon discontinuation of study drug patients were followed up for survival, approximately every 
month (telephone follow-up was acceptable), with the exception of patients who specifically 
withdrew consent. Patients were followed for AEs (adverse events) up to 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug. 
Tertiary endpoints were duration of response (i.e., time from the first documented objective 
response of CR of PR, whichever was noted earlier, to disease progression or death [if death 
occurred before progression], in patients achieving CR or PR), duration of stable disease (i.e., 
time from randomisation to disease progression or death, calculated only in patients who failed 
to achieve CR or PR), and evaluation of patient reported outcomes (PROs). PROs included 
evaluation of Health Related Quality of life (according to EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D 
questionnaires). 
In approximately 150 patients from selected sites, blood samples were collected for 
pharmacokinetic analyses of regorafenib and its metabolites at steady state. 
Finally, a biomarker analysis was also included as exploratory. Biomarker analyses were 
performed on whole blood and plasma samples as well as archived diagnostic tumour biopsies 
(voluntary patients with a separate consent). Biomarker analysis included evaluation of mutation 
of genes of interest (e.g., BRAF, KRAS, PI3KCA), expression of several genes (eg, VEGFR, 
PDGFR, FGFR, c-KIT, TIE2) on archival tumour biopsies and/or blood/plasma samples. 
Sample size 
The study was designed to have 90% power to detect a 33.3% increase in median OS (i.e., a HR 
of 0.75, regorafenib over placebo). Assuming one-sided overall alpha of 0.025, power of 90%, a 
randomisation ratio of 2:1 between regorafenib and placebo and 2 formal interim analyses of OS 
during this study using an Oâ€™Brien-Fleming-type error spending function, a total of 582 death 
events for the final OS analysis were estimated to be required. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 44/91 
 
  
  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised to receive regorafenib or placebo with a ratio of 2:1 and they were 
planned to start study treatment within 7 days of randomisation. Randomisation was stratified 
by: 
1- Prior treatment with VEGF targeting drugs (yes/no) 
2- Time from diagnosis of metastatic disease (â‰¥18 months versus <18 months) 
3- Geographic region 1 (North America, Western Europe, Israel, and Australia), versus region 2 
(Asia), versus region 3 (South America, Turkey and Eastern Europe) 
In order to maintain a balanced representation of each region, not more than 250 patients from 
Asia were planned to be randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind. 
Statistical methods 
The primary population for the efficacy analysis was the ITT population, which was defined as all 
randomised patients, independently on whether they received or not study medication. The 
population for safety analysis comprised all patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
medication. 
OS and PFS were compared using a log-rank test stratified by the same stratification factors as 
used for randomisation. In addition, the HR (regorafenib plus BSC group/placebo plus BSC 
group) for OS and its 95% confidence interval were calculated using the Cox model, stratified by 
the same stratification factors as above. Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates for OS and KM survival 
curves were also presented for each treatment group. 
ORR and DCR were compared between treatment groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) test adjusting for the same stratification factors as for the primary endpoint. Estimates 
and 95% confidence intervals were computed for each treatment group. The differences in ORR 
between the regorafenib and placebo group and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
were also calculated. 
Two formal interim analyses were planned during the study. The first interim analysis (i.e., at 
approximately 30% (175 deaths) of the planned total number of events) served as a futility 
analysis only, and the second interim analysis (i.e., at approximately 70% (408 deaths) of the 
planned total number of events) was to evaluate both efficacy and futility. Stopping boundaries 
were calculated for the interim analyses based on the actual number of events observed up to 
the database cut-off date used for the interim analyses. A Lan-Demets alpha spending function 
determined the monitoring boundary for early stopping for efficacy so that the overall false 
positive rate, alpha, was less than or equal to 0.025 (one-sided). The alpha spending function 
was the Oâ€™Brien-Fleming-type boundary specified. Futility boundaries were calculated separately 
for the interim analyses, too. The futility boundaries were based on ruling out a true hazard ratio 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 45/91 
 
  
  
(HR) of 0.7502 or lower (corresponding to approximately the targeted 33.3% or more increase in 
median overall survival over placebo). As the efficacy and futility boundaries were independent of 
each other, non-adherence to the futility boundaries would not inflate the overall false positive 
rate, alpha, to over 0.025 (one-sided).

Conduct of the study 
A  total  of  432  death  events  (56.8%)  were  included  at  the  second  interim  analysis  (cut-off 
21 July 2011),  275  (54.5%)  events  in  the  regorafenib  arm  and  157  events  (61.6%)  in  the 
placebo  arm.  As  the  pre-specified  Oâ€™Brien-Fleming-type  efficacy  boundary  (one-sided  alpha 
0.009279) was crossed and the DMC proclaimed the study as positive, this interim analysis was 
presented  as  the  final  analysis.  An  updated  OS  analysis  was  performed  using  a  later  database 
cut-off  date  (13  November  2011,  the  day  before  the  first  placebo  randomised  patient  crossed-
over), when 97% (566) of the total planned events had occurred. 
According to the Applicant, major protocol deviation/violations were reported in 7 patients who 
did not receive study drug and have been excluded from the â€˜per-protocolâ€™ population. 
The most common (â‰¥10% patients) minor deviations by term were â€˜Procedures, tests or 
measurements for this patient were not performed when scheduledâ€™ (60.6% vs 54.1% in the 
regorafenib and placebo groups, respectively), â€˜Scheduled procedures, tests or measurements for 
this patient were not performed within the allowed time windowsâ€™ (28.5% vs 21.2%, 
respectively), and â€˜Study medication not taken or administered according to protocolâ€™ (15.6% vs 
11.6%). Moreover, 13.3% of patients in each treatment group were randomized despite not 
meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria, essentially consisting of presence of uncontrolled 
hypertension (8.3% vs 7.5%, respectively), and â€œINR/PTT greater than 1.5 x ULN (1.6% in both 
arms). 
A total of 33 patients (15 in the placebo + BSC group and 18 patients in the regorafenib + BSC 
group) had inaccurate stratification information entered into IVRS. Two of the 33 total patients 
were mis-stratified for more than 1 factor. In light of the mis-stratification, sensitivity analyses 
on OS and PFS were also specified to be performed as unstratified analyses. 
The original study protocol dated 10 February 2010 was subsequently amended 3 times, twice 
after the data cut-off for the second pre-planned interim analysis (considered as the final 
analysis). 
Amendment 1 (dated 28 September 2010) essentially clarified inclusion/exclusion criteria, dose 
modification/delay, permitted (or not) concomitant medications, study procedures/assessments, 
pharmacokinetics sampling. Moreover, adverse events of special interest were updated and 
several minor textual changes of the study protocol were implemented.  
Amendment 2 (dated 03 August 2011) essentially included recommendations for dose 
modification for AST, ALT and bilirubin increases related to study drug, introduction of weekly 
evaluation of ALT, AST and bilirubin during the first two cycles of treatment, introduction of 
guidance for patients developing diarrhoea, mucositis, anorexia or other events predisposing to 
fluid loss or inadequate fluid intake.  
Amendment 3 (dated 01 November 2011) was implemented after the second interim analysis in 
order to allow patients on placebo treatment to receive regorafenib through open label 
treatment.

Secondary objective: Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR) 
Overall response rate (ORR=CR + PR, per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by investigator) was not 
statistically significant different between the two treatment arms: 1% (0+5 patients) with 
regorafenib +BSC versus 0.4% (0+1 pt) with placebo plus BSC. 
Disease Control Rate (DCR: CR+ PR+ SD) was significantly higher with regorafenib (41%, [207 
patients]) compared with placebo (14.9%, [38 patients]), essentially due to a higher rate of 
patients with disease stabilisation. 
Tertiary objective: Duration of response and Duration of stable disease 
Only 6 patients (5 treated with regorafenib and 1 with placebo) achieved tumour response. For 
the 5 patients treated with regorafenib median duration of response could not be evaluated due 
to small number of patients (range without censored values 59-64 days), whereas it was 68 days 
in the patient treated in the placebo group. 
Duration of stable disease was not significantly different between the two treatment arms (60 
days with regorafenib vs 52 days with placebo). 
Tertiary endpoint: Patient-Reported Outcomes: EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D 
EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D questionnaires were administered at baseline, on Day 1 of Cycles 2-
4, and every other cycle thereafter and at end of treatment visit. Higher scores of the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 (range 0-100) and EQ-5D represent a higher level of functioning and better HRQoL. 
Change of â‰¥10 points in EORTC QLQ-C30 or, 0.07 to 0.12 points on the EQ-5D index or of 7-12 
points on the visual analogue scale (VAS) are considered as clinically meaningful. 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 was completed by 697 (92%) patients at baseline, 604 (79%) patients at 
cycle 2, and 557 (73%) patients at cycle 3. The mean EORTC QLQ-C30 score at baseline was 
62.64 and 64.65 in the regorafenib and placebo groups, respectively. The mean score at the End 
Assessment report

of Treatment (EOT) visit was 48.94 and 51.85, respectively. The deterioration in global score was 
not significantly different between the two treatment arms. The least square (LS) mean 
regarding time-adjusted AUC was slightly but not statistically significantly higher with placebo 
compared with regorafenib (58.13 vs 56.93, respectively). 
The EQ-5D questionnaire was completed by 705 (93%) patients at baseline, 637 (84%) patients 
at cycle 2, and 601 (79%) patients at cycle 3. The mean EQ-5D index score (general health 
status) was 0.727 and 0.738 in the regorafenib and placebo groups, respectively at baseline, and 
0.593 and 0.591, respectively, at the EOT visit. The mean EQ-5D VAS score was 65.4 and 65.8 
in the regorafenib and placebo groups, respectively, at baseline and 55.5 and 57.3, respectively, 
at the EOT visit. Mean changes in scores from baseline for EQ-5D index and VAS were, overall, 
similar between the regorafenib + BSC and placebo + BSC groups, suggesting similar 
deterioration in both arms. 
Exploratory endpoint: biomarkers 
Subgroup analyses of OS and PFS by KRAS tumour status based on historical data prior to study 
enrolment are presented in Figure 6 . 
Figure 6: OS and PFS by historical KRAS tumour status, 14387 study, ITT population 
A retrospective analysis of 3 genetic biomarkers (KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and 15 non-genetic 
biomarkers considered relevant for CRC (ANG-2, IL-6, IL-8, VEGFR-1, TIE-1, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, 
VEGF-D, VEGF-A-121, BMP-7, VWF, M-CSF, SDF-1 and TIMP-2), based on DNA isolated from 
fresh baseline plasma and archival tumour tissue specimens, was submitted. 
Plasma KRAS data was generated for 66% (503) of all randomised patients, of which 69% were 
KRAS mutant, compared to 59% from the archival tumour tissue, and 31% were KRAS wild type. 
Correlative analysis for OS indicated trends in favour of regorafenib in both KRAS wild type 
(regorafenib/placebo HR: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.41, 1.08]) and KRAS mutant (regorafenib/placebo 
HR: 0.81 [95% CI: 0.61, 1.09]) subgroups. The interaction p-value comparing the HRs of the de 
novo plasma KRAS subgroups was 0.561, indicating no significant difference in regorafenib 
Assessment report

clinical efficacy (vs. placebo) related to KRAS mutational status. Likewise, interaction p-values 
for subgroups in which KRAS status was determined via BEAMing of DNA isolated from archival 
tumour tissue were not significant. Pre-existing/historical KRAS data were available from 96% of 
all randomized patients, of which 59% were KRAS mutant and 41% were KRAS wild type. 
Correlative analysis indicated a trend towards a survival benefit for regorafenib as compared to 
placebo in the KRAS wild type subgroup (regorafenib/placebo HR: 0.653 [95% CI: 0.476, 
0.895]) as well as in the KRAS mutant subgroup (regorafenib/placebo HR: 0.867 [95% CI: 
0.670, 1.123]).  
PIK3CA mutation data were available from 66% of all randomised patients, of which 17% were 
PIK3CA mutant and 83% were PIK3CA wild type. Correlative analysis for OS indicated trends in 
favour of regorafenib in both PIK3CA wild type (regorafenib/placebo HR: 0.75 [95% CI: 0.57, 
0.99]) and PIK3CA mutant (regorafenib/placebo HR: 0.84 [95% CI: 0.47, 1.50]) subgroups. The 
interaction p-value among these subgroups was 0.723, indicating no significant difference in 
regorafenib clinical efficacy (vs. placebo) related to PIK3CA mutational status. Likewise, 
interaction p-values for subgroups in which PIK3CA status was determined via BEAMing of DNA 
isolated from archival tumour tissue were not significant. 
Since KRAS and PIK3CA mutations may co-exist in the same tumour, subgroup analyses were 
also conducted based on various combinations of KRAS and PIK3CA mutations, with mutational 
status determined via BEAMing of DNA isolated from fresh plasma. In the KRAS mutant + 
PIK3CA mutant subgroup the regorafenib/placebo HR was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.37, 1.35), in the 
KRAS mutant + PIK3CA wild type subgroup the regorafenib/placebo HR was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.61, 
1.16) and in the KRAS wild type + PIK3CAwild type subgroup the regorafenib/placebo HR was 
0.57 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.96). There were too few patients in the KRAS wild type + PIK3CA mutant 
subgroup to permit a meaningful correlative analysis. 
BRAF mutational status using DNA isolated from fresh plasma was determined from 66% of all 
randomized patients, of which 3.4% were BRAF mutant and 96.6% were BRAF wild type. Due to 
the small number of BRAF mutant patients, a correlative analysis was not conducted based on 
BRAF mutational status. 
The non-genetic biomarker analysis in the pivotal study involved the quantification of 15 different 
plasma proteins at baseline, many associated with angiogenesis (ANG-2, TIE-1, VEGF-A, VEGFA-
121, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, PlGF, VEGFR1, IL-6, IL-8), as well as others with known or hypothesised 
roles in CRC pathogenesis (SDF-1, BMP-7, M-CSF, TIMP-2 and von Willebrand Factor [VWF]). 
number of these proteins are either directly inhibited by regorafenib or directly interact with 
proteins or pathways inhibited by regorafenib (VEGFR1, VEGF-A, VEGFA-121, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, 
PlGF, TIE-1). Correlative analyses of OS comparing subgroups with high or low protein levels 
defined based on median values demonstrated that none of these proteins were predictive of 
regorafenib clinical activity vs placebo (i.e., no interaction p-value reached p<0.05). One plasma 
protein, TIE-1, appeared to be predictive for regorafenib clinical activity, although both â€˜highâ€™ and 
â€˜lowâ€™ TIE-1 subgroups showed a trend towards benefitting from regorafenib. High TIE-1 levels 
correlated with greater regorafenib benefit than low TIE- 1 levels (regorafenib/placebo HR for OS 
in patients with low TIE-1: 0.87 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.20]; and in patients with high TIE-1: 0.56 
[95% CI: 0.41, 0.77]; interaction p-value: 0.035). A similar analysis of plasma biomarkers vs 
PFS demonstrated that levels of VWF appeared to be predictive for regorafenib clinical activity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 54/91 
 
  
  
Low VWF levels correlated with greater regorafenib benefit than high VWF levels 
(regorafenib/placebo HR for PFS in patients with low VWF of 0.39 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.51] and in 
patients with high VWF of 0.60 [95% CI: 0.46, 0.78]; interaction p-value: 0.020). Notably, in the 
PFS analyses TIE-1 did not correlate with regorafenib benefit; and conversely, in the OS 
analyses, VWF did not correlate with benefit. 
Ancillary analyses 
The results of the primary OS analysis were consistent with the results of an unstratified OS 
analysis (unstratified HR=0.773, 95% CI 0.634-0.942, p=0.005255), and with an OS analysis 
using stratification information from the IVRS instead of the CRF (HR=0.767, 95% CI 0.630-
0.933, p=0.003905), performed due to observed mis-stratification of some patients. 
Similarly, the results of the primary PFS analysis were consistent with the results of an 
unstratified PFS analysis (unstratified HR=0.501, 95% CI 0.425-0.590, p<0.000001), and with a 
PFS analysis using stratification information from the IVRS instead of the CRF (HR=0.479, 95% 
CI 0.405-0.565, p=0.000001), performed due to observed misstratification of some patients. 
For PFS stratified per randomisation based on CRF data, new treatment initiation date in follow-
up period considered as event date for patients who discontinued prior to progression, results 
(HR 0.497, 95% CI 0.422-0.586, p<0.000001, median PFS 59 days vs 52 days with regorafenib 
and placebo, respectively) were consistent with the primary PFS analysis. 
For PFS stratified per randomisation based on CRF data, considering all available tumour 
assessment data from follow-up period, results (HR 0.497, 95% CI 0.422-0.586, p<0.000001, 
median PFS 59 days vs 52 days with regorafenib and placebo, respectively) were consistent with 
the primary PFS analysis. 
For Time to Progression (TTP) stratified per randomisation based on CRF data, median was 60 
days and 52 days with regorafenib and placebo, respectively, HR 0.469 (95% CI 0.396-0.556), 
p<0.000001. Results were similar in the analysis stratified per randomisation based on IVRS 
data.

Supportive study 
The Applicant has submitted one phase I (Study 11650) trial, the expansion cohort of which 
included 23 patients with mCRC. 
Study 11650 
Study 11650 was a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, single-agent, dose escalation 
study to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended-
phase-2-dose pharmacokinetics and to evaluate biomarkers in 76 patients with advanced solid 
tumours. After a dose escalation phase including doses 10 mg once daily to 220 mg once daily, 
an expansion cohort in patients with CRC was conducted at dose level 160 mg once daily 
regorafenib on an intermittent dosing schedule. Tumour response and progression were 
evaluated based on RECIST, v. 1.0. All patients with CRC treated at doses of â‰¥60 mg once daily 
(in the dose escalation or dose expansion part of the study) were included in a subgroup 
analysis. Overall, 39 patients with metastatic CRC refractory to standard treatment were enrolled 
in Study 11650 with intermittent dosing schedule of regorafenib, of which 23 patients were 
enrolled in the expansion cohort of the study. First signs of clinical activity were observed at dose 
levels â‰¥ 60 mg, which were received by 38 patients with mCRC treated. Of the 38 patients, 20 
(54%) had positive KRAS mutation status, whereas 17 patients (46%) were KRAS wild type. In 
one case the KRAS mutation analysis was not successful. 
A total of 27 patients (out of 38 patients treated at dose â‰¥60 mg once daily) were evaluable for 
response according to RECIST (v. 1.0). Best responses included a confirmed partial response 
(PR) in 1 patient (4%) and stable disease (SD) in 19 patients (70%), resulting in a DCR of 74% 
in evaluable patients. Seven patients (26%) had progressive disease. The median PFS was 
107 days (95% CI 66-161; range of 1-279 days).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant submitted one single pivotal study and this is acceptable by EMA. Nevertheless, the 
study has to be particularly compelling with respect to internal and external validity, critical 
relevance, statistical significance, data quality and internal consistency. Study 14387 was the 
pivotal, phase III, multicentre, multinational, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study. 
A total of 760 patients with mCRC previously treated with, or not considered candidates for, 
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, anti-VEGF therapy, and, if KRAS wild type, anti-EGFR 
therapy, were randomised (2:1) to receive oral regorafenib 160 mg OD (3 weeks on/1 week off) 
plus BSC or matching placebo plus BSC.  
The two arm design of the study with placebo plus BSC as comparator is considered acceptable, 
as patients enrolled in the trial had received all the standard treatment options currently 
available in EU Countries. The use of superiority design is endorsed. The selection of OS as 
primary endpoint corresponds to the accepted standards of clinical cancer research and is in 
accordance with EMA guidelines, in view of the lack of further active therapeutic options for the 
target population and the poor life expectancy of these patients. PFS as secondary endpoint is 
considered acceptable. 
Randomisation, in agreement with EMA guidelines, was stratified according to geographical 
region and other factors (time from diagnosis of metastatic disease, prior treatment with anti-
VEGF drugs) that represent well-recognised prognostic covariates in the target population. 
Major protocol modifications were introduced with the implementation of protocol amendment 3, 
in order to allow cross-over to regorafenib for patients treated with placebo. However, as the 
amendment was implemented after the cut-off date for the secondary interim OS analysis 
(presented as final), it is not expected to impact interpretation of the data. 
The population enrolled in the pivotal study reflects the target population as mentioned by the 
wording of the proposed indication. The study population was similar to the general patient 
population with mCRC in several aspects. The great majority of patients were males (60.8%), 
white (78.2%), with a median age of 61 years (range, 22-85 yr), an ECOG PS 0 (54.9%) and a 
median time since metastatic diagnosis of 130 weeks (128 weeks with regorafenib and 133 
weeks with placebo). Primary site of disease was colon in the majority of patients in both groups 
(67.5% and 64%). All patients had metastatic disease and were pre-treated with a VEGF 
inhibitor, fluoropyrimifine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan. Moreover, 99.5% of patients with KRAS 
wildtype or unknown status had received panitumumab and/or cetuximab. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics appeared to be comparable between the two study 
arms. Baseline information on KRAS mutations in the tumours (historical data) was available in 
478 (94.7%) patients in the regorafenib group vs 251 (98.4%) patients in the placebo group. 
Baseline information on BRAF mutations in the tumours (historical data) was available in 45 
(8.9%) vs 27 (10.6%) patients in the regorafenib and placebo groups, respectively, and was 
positive in 0.8% of patients in each treatment group. Unfortunately, no distribution of tumour 
characteristics able to discriminate patients with slowly or rapidly progressive disease has been 
identified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 58/91 
 
  
  
No significant differences in concomitant medications or in medical history between treatment 
arms was observed, although patients in the placebo group consistently appeared to have a 
slightly higher number of co-morbidities and were more pre-treated with radiotherapy (30.6% vs 
26.7%). 
With regard to post-study treatments, slightly more patients in the placebo received systemic 
anti-cancer therapy during follow-up compared with patients in the regorafenib group (29.8% vs 
25.9%). Post-study treatments essentially consisted of pyrimidine analogues (20.4% vs 18.6%, 
respectively), other cytotoxic antibiotics (11.4% vs 7.5%), monoclonal antibodies (8.6% 7.7%), 
folic acid and derivatives (8.2% vs 5.5%), and platinum compounds (5.5% vs 6.9%). 
The overview on systemic anticancer therapy during follow-up has been updated for the later 
13 November 2011 database cut-off. Overall, the percentage of patients receiving post-study 
systemic anticancer therapy was comparable to the numbers reported at the second, pre-
planned, formal interim analysis. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The proposed regorafenib oral daily dose of 160 mg OD administered according to a 3 weeks 
on/one week off schema, which was used in the pivotal study, was supported by a phase I dose-
finding study (11650). However, it should be noted that clinical data directly comparing the 
continuous dosing regimen with the 3 weeks on/1week off schedule are lacking. The evidence of 
efficacy of regorafenib in patients with mCRC is based on the results of one pivotal study (14387 
or CORRECT), supported by the data of the expansion cohort of the phase I 11650 study, 
enrolling patients with mCRC. 
The present submission for MAA is based upon the results of the second interim OS analysis 
presented as final performed after 432 death events (56.8%, 275 in the regorafenib arm and 
157 in the placebo arm, cut-off 21 July 2011). At this analysis, the pre-specified Oâ€™Brien-
Fleming-type efficacy boundary (one-sided alpha 0.009279) was crossed and the DMC assessed 
the results as positive. Therefore, this interim analysis was presented as the final analysis. 
The results show a statistically significant improvement in OS for regorafenib compared to 
placebo (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.636-0.942, p=0.005178), with a gain in median OS of 1.5 months 
in favour of regorafenib (median OS 196 days vs 151 days, respectively). The OS effect 
appeared to be consistent in the updated analysis performed with a cut-off of 
13 November 2011, after 97% of death events occurred and before cross-over was allowed 
(median OS:194 vs 152 days, HR 0.790, 95% CI 0.664, 0.393, p=0.003791). The observed OS 
benefit is considered limited and its clinical relevance needs to be considered taking into account 
both the treatment effect on symptom control as well as drug tolerability.  
The effect on OS was observed in several subgroups of the population, with the exception of 
patients with rectum as primary tumour localisation (220 patients, 109 events, HR 0.953, CI 
0.633, 1.436). The small sample size could potentially explain the lack of effect in this subgroup. 
The effect on OS in patients with KRAS mutated tumours was inferior (430 patients, 228 events, 
HR 0.867, CI 0.670, 1.123). As mentioned previously, no imbalance in post-study therapies 
between the two study arms was observed from the data provided. However, the trend towards 
a smaller observed benefit in the KRAS mutant subgroup might be at least partly explained by a 
Assessment report

Page 59/91 
 
  
  
higher rate of subsequent anti-cancer therapy in the KRAS-mutated placebo subgroup compared 
to the KRAS-mutated regorafenib subgroup (33.1% vs. 24.9%, respectively). Additionally, the 
difference could be due to imbalances in baseline characteristics of the patients included in these 
subgroups and for these non-randomised comparisons. 
The OS results appear to be supported by the investigator-assessed PFS data. A statistically 
significant increase in PFS was observed with regorafenib compared with placebo (HR 0.494, 
95% CI 0.419-0.582, p<0.00000). However, the difference in median PFS between the two 
study arms was only one week (median PFS 59 days with regorafenib vs 52 days with placebo). 
This could be related to the timing of protocol-specified assessment, as at the time of the first 
radiological evaluation (8 weeks) more than 50% of patients in both study arms had experienced 
disease progression already. The high rate of patients not responding to treatment in the 
regorafenib arm could suggest activity of the drug limited to a subgroup of the population (58% 
of patients were progressive after 3 months). 
The treatment effect on PFS for regorafenib was consistent across different subgroups regardless 
of age, ECOG PS, gender, geographical region, previous treatment with a VEGF and EGFR 
targeting drug, primary site of disease and KRAS mutation status. 
The results of a correlative analysis including 3 genetic biomarkers (KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF) and 15 
non-genetic biomarkers (ANG-2, IL-6, IL-8, P1GF, VEGFR-1, TIE1, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, 
VEGF-A-121, BMP-7, VWF, M-CSF, SDF-1 and TIMP-2) measured in plasma and/or tumour tissue 
have been provided, but no specific biomarker was identified that can be used for patient 
selection and to predict regorafenib clinical activity. Methodological concerns over the provided 
biomarkers analyses have been raised due to the limited number of tumour tissues available, the 
absence of fresh biopsies performed at study entry and concerns regarding the validity of genetic 
measurements performed on DNA isolated from fresh plasma.  
ORR (CR+PR) was very low and similar between the two treatment arms (1% with regorafenib 
and 0.4% with placebo). The claimed improvement in OS and PFS appears to be essentially 
driven by patients experiencing disease stabilisation under treatment. No remarkable difference 
between the two study arms was observed in the evaluation of Quality of life. However, a 
numerical trend towards lower scores (and therefore worse quality of life) for patients treated 
with regorafenib is consistently observed overtime by evaluation of single domains. Other patient 
reported outcomes able to indirectly assess clinical benefit for patients (e.g. use of analgesics, 
pain control, other specific disease related symptoms) have not been evaluated. 
Additional expert consultation 
The CHMP convened a Scientific Advisory Group in Oncology (SAG-O) to address questions 
related to efficacy. The SAG-O advice was the following: 
1.  Does the SAG consider the clinical benefit of regorafenib adequately demonstrated 
in the population as a whole enrolled in the pivotal study 14387, although PFS 
results suggest a benefit limited only to a subgroup of the mCRC population 
treated (>50% of patients experiencing disease progression at the time of first 
radiological evaluation)?  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 60/91 
 
  
  
A statistically significant difference was observed in the primary analysis of OS in study 14387 in 
the overall population. The difference in median OS between regorafenib and placebo was 
modest (45 days). The clinical relevance of this magnitude of treatment effect is considered to be 
minimal.. The rapid onset of progression in the majority of patients suggests that a favourable 
effect is limited to a minority of patients. 
Importantly, however, regorafenib was associated with significant toxicity in the majority of 
patients. The most-frequent drug-related adverse event was hand-foot syndrome, which was 
observed (any Grade) in 44.6% vs 7.1% of patients for regorafenib and placebo, respectively. 
The most common Grade 3 adverse events with higher frequency in the regorafenib, compared 
to the placebo arm in study 14387, were hand-foot syndrome (16.6% vs 0.4%), fatigue (15.0% 
vs 8.3%), diarrhoea (8.2% vs 2.0%), hypertension (7.6% vs 0.8%), rash/desquamation (5.8% 
vs 0.4%), reduced platelet counts (3.4% vs 0.4%), reduced haemoglobin (5.4% vs 3.2%), 
mucositis (3.2% vs 0%), hyperbilirubinaemia (6.8% vs 4.3%), AST increase (2.4% vs 1.2%), 
and (abdominal) pain (9.8% vs 5.7%). In the great majority of cases these events were 
considered drug-related. Overall, severe, life-threatening or fatal (Grade 3-5) adverse drug 
reactions were observed in 55.0% vs 13.8% of patients for regorafenib and placebo, respectively 
(page 56-58, Rapporteursâ€™ Joint Assessment Report). 
Due to the significant toxicity and the minimal efficacy the SAG was uncertain that the balance of 
benefits and risks is positive.  
In view of the toxicity profile of regorafenib, should this product be widely available to the 
oncology community, appropriate educational material and risk minimisation measures should be 
in place to ensure appropriate monitoring and follow-up of toxicity with this oral agent. 
2.  Whereas 50% or more of the patients in the experimental treatment arm have 
already progressed by Week 8, and few patients experienced a tumour response, 
the Kaplan-Meier curves for Overall Survival appear to separate already at 50 days, 
after only a minority of patients in both groups have died. Could the SAG offer an 
opinion on the internal consistency of the pattern of results observed and 
comment on the clinical relevance of the differences in OS for the assessment of 
efficacy of the product? 
The lack of a clear effect in terms of PFS may be due to a number of reasons, including the 
scheduled frequency of the assessment. In and of itself, the apparent discordance between PFS 
and OS is not considered of concern and does not necessarily suggest lack of internal 
consistency.  
3.  Does the SAG consider the provided analyses exploring biomarkers and other 
clinical and tumour parameters of patients enrolled in the pivotal study 14387 
adequate and compelling in order to eventually identify parameters for proper 
patient selection for treatment with regorafenib? 
Unfortunately, the trial was not adequately designed to ensure availability of tumour and tissue 
collection to maximise the likelihood of identifying important biomarkers associated with a 
response to treatment. Even for established biomarkers such as KRAS, the data for analysis were 
missing in a high proportion of patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 61/91 
 
  
  
Furthermore, notwithstanding the reduced data set available for biomarker analysis, the 
biological and statistical analyses presented were inadequate and far from compelling 
methodologically in ruling out identification of important biomarkers. Exhaustive explorative 
analyses were not conducted and even standard statistics (Kaplan-Meier estimates) have not 
been presented systematically to allow at least informal evaluation.  
Undue importance was given by the applicant company to the risk of chance findings. However, 
in this context, where it is clear that a majority of patients receives no benefit from the drug 
whilst being exposed to significant toxicity, it is essential to conduct a systematic and in-depth 
exploratory analysis of all potential clinical and biological factors that may help patient selection 
or, at least, to generate hypotheses to be validated on independent data sets. 
4.  Does the SAG foresee additional analyses to be performed with the available data 
and/or in future studies in order to identify patients who may benefit from 
treatment with regorafenib?  
It is essential to conduct a systematic and exhaustive exploratory analysis on the available data 
(including data from compassionate use programmes, where appropriate) of all potential factors 
that may help patient selection or, at least, to generate hypotheses to be validated on 
independent data sets.  
Tabular and graphical presentations of particular statistics (Kaplan-Meier estimates, etc.), should 
be systematically produced. An in-depth univariate and multivariate analysis of factors 
associated with treatment effect should be conducted and presented. 
The association between KRAS mutation and lack of response to treatment should be clarified as 
a matter of priority (based on the available data, if possible). Furthermore, factors associated 
with a treatment effect in patients with longer PFS (using different landmarks, e.g., 4, 6, 8 
months) should be explored. 
Additional biomarkers could be derived from exploration of the role of standard tumour biological 
parameters (e.g., mitotic index, Ki-67, tumour grade). In addition analysis of specific biological 
(intracellular) pathways known to be affected by the drug should be conducted.  
Furthermore, as a non-hypothesis driven approach in a research setting, next-generation 
sequencing, number of circulating tumour cells, endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells 
may help to identify biomarkers for future patient selection.  
Similarly, further analysis of factors associated with individual differences in drug metabolism 
may help to clarify the dose-response relationship and help to identify a sub-population for whom 
regorafenib is likely to have a better risk-benefit balance. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
This single pivotal trial demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for regorafenib in 
metastatic colorectal cancer patients pre-treated or unsuitable for all approved standard 
therapies. 
Although the benefit in terms of both OS and PFS is undisputable from a statistical perspective, 
the magnitude of the effect is limited, no improvement has been reported on symptoms and the 
Assessment report

median duration of stable disease is very short in the overall population. It seems that the 
benefit is driven by a subset of patients, considering that half of the treated population progress 
or die very early (58% at 3 months). Unfortunately, none of the biomarkers explored to date 
appears to be predictive of regorafenib clinical activity. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- To submit pre-specified, exploratory wild-type and mutant KRAS subgroup analyses from 
study 15808 (CONCUR - randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study of 
regorafenib plus best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC in Asian subjects with 
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have progressed after standard therapy) 
To submit NRAS and BRAF biomarker analyses from the same study, subject to sample 
availability and confirmation of appropriate informed consent 
A proposal for additional biomarkers assessment should be submitted to the CHMP within two 
months of the marketing authorisation. 
- To submit pre-specified, exploratory genetic (including NRAS, KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA) and 
non-genetic (ANG-2, IL-6, IL-8, P1GF, VEGFR-1, TIE1, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-A-121, 
BMP-7, VWF, M-CSF, SDF-1) appropriate biomarker analyses from study 15983 (randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase-III study of adjuvant regorafenib versus placebo for 
patients with stage IV colorectal cancer after curative treatment of liver metastases). Genetic 
and non-genetic biomarker analysis should be implemented as mandatory for all enrolled 
patients. 
Prospective serial measurement should be planned and assessed for biomarkers. The proposed 
protocol for biomarkers assessment should be submitted to the CHMP within two months of the 
marketing authorisation. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall approximately 1145 patients with cancer, including 621 patients with CRC and 124 
healthy volunteers have been exposed to regorafenib in applicant-sponsored trials up to 
31 December 2011.The safety database of regorafenib has been presented in 3 different 
populations: 
- Pool 1: 188 patients enrolled in Phase 1 and Phase 2 uncontrolled studies conducted with 
single agent regorafenib administered on an intermittent dosing schedule (3 weeks on/ 1 week 
off): studies 11650, 13172, 14996, 11726, and 14596. The dose of regorafenib was 160 mg od 
in these studies, with the exception of the dose escalation study 11650, in which regorafenib 
doses from 20 to 220 mg od were administered. 
- Pool 2: 84 patients enrolled in uncontrolled Phase 1 study 11651 performed with single-agent 
regorafenib administered continuously once daily at doses ranging from 10 to 140 mg in patients 
with metastatic and/or unresectable solid tumours. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 63/91 
 
  
  
- Pool 3: 753 patients in the safety population from the pivotal Phase 3 study 14387 in mCRC 
(500 patients having received single agent regorafenib vs 253 patients having received placebo). 
Moreover, deaths and SAEs as observed in other studies performed with regorafenib 
administered in combination with chemotherapy or as monotherapy with other dose schedules or 
in other indications than mCRC were reported. 
However, the safety analysis below is focused on the data available from the phase 3 pivotal 
study, where regorafenib was compared with placebo in the target population. In this study and 
as of the clinical cut-off date, the median actual daily dose was 160 mg in both study arms, 
which corresponded to the protocol target daily dose of 160 mg/day. The median duration of 
treatment was similar between regorafenib and placebo (7.27 vs 6.98 weeks, respectively, with 
overlapping ranges), whereas the mean was 12.08 (Â±9.74) and 7.78 (Â±5.19) weeks, 
respectively. 
Exposure to regorafenib in the different safety populations is summarised in the following Table 10.

Adverse events 
An overview of adverse events in the different safety populations is presented in Table 11. 
Table 11:  Overview of Adverse Events in Pools 1 to 3 (SAF) 
In the pivotal 14387 (CORRECT) study, adverse events (AEs) were coded using MedDRA 14.0 
and graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). An 
overview of the most common AEs in the different safety populations is presented in Table 12. 
In the pivotal study, AEs (any grade, by CTCAE term) notably more frequently observed (â‰¥10% 
difference) with regorafenib compared with placebo were fatigue (63.4% vs 46.2%), hand-foot 
syndrome (47.0% vs 7.5%), anorexia (46.8% vs 28.5%), diarrhoea (42.8% vs 17.0%), weight 
loss (32.0% vs 11.1%), voice changes/dysphonia (32.0% vs 6.3%), hypertension (30.4% vs 
7.9%), rash/desquamation (29.0% vs 5.1%), mucositis (functional/ symptomatic), oral cavity 
(28.8% vs 4.7%), fever (28.4% vs 15.4%), hyperbilirubinemia (20.0% vs 9.5%), platelet counts 
abnormalities (15.6% vs 2.4%), haemorrhage (20.4% vs 6.7%) and infections (25.2% vs 
14.2%). The difference was mainly due to a higher incidence of grade 1-3 events. These AEs 
were also most frequently reported as drug-related events. 
The most common Grade 3 AEs (by CTCAE term) with higher frequency in the regorafenib, 
compared to the placebo arm, were hand-foot syndrome (16.6% vs 0.4%), fatigue (15.0% vs 
8.3%), diarrhoea (8.2% vs 2.0%]), hypertension (7.6% vs 0.8%), rash/desquamation (5.8% vs 
0.4%), platelet counts abnormalities (3.4% vs 0.4%) haemoglobin abnormalities (5.4% vs 
3.2%), mucositis (3.2% vs 0%), hyperbilirubinemia (6.8% vs 4.3%), AST increase (2.4% vs

1.2%), and (abdominal) pain (9.8% vs 5.7%). In the great majority of cases these events were 
considered drug related. 
The incidence of the most common (â‰¥ 1% patients in either treatment group) grade 4 AEs was 
similar between the two treatment arms. They were (regorafenib vs placebo) infections (1.6% vs 
0.4%), lipase abnormalities (1.2% vs 0.4%), constitutional symptoms (1.0% vs 1.2%), 
hyperbilirubinemia (0.8% vs 2.0%) and fatigue (0.4% vs 2.0%). 
The observed regorafenib AE profile was comparable between the Pool 1-3 populations. Overall, 
the most frequently reported AEs in patients treated with regorafenib were decreased appetite, 
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, diarrhoea, fatigue, weight decreased, 
hypertension, dysphonia, pyrexia, asthenia, constipation, nausea, rash and pain (in the 
extremity, abdominal back).

Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) 
From all clinical experience to date, the most frequently observed adverse drug reactions 
(â‰¥30%) in patients receiving Stivarga were asthenia/fatigue, decreased appetite and food intake, 
hand foot skin reaction, diarrhoea, weight loss, infection, hypertension and dysphonia. The most 
serious adverse drug reactions in patients receiving Stivarga were severe liver injury, 
haemorrhage and gastrointestinal perforation. ADRs of Stivarga are summarised in the following

Adverse Events of special interest (AESI) 
AEs of special interest (AESI) included hypertension, hand-foot skin reaction, rash, diarrhoea, 
myocardial ischemia, bleeding, gastrointestinal perforationhepatobiliary events, proteinuria and 
renal failure, impaired wound healing and thromboembolic events. 
Hypertension was reported in approximately 30% of patients treated with regorafenib in all 
studies performed. Generally hypertension was mild or moderate in severity (grade 3 events 
reported in 7.6%, no grade 4 or 5) and appears to be manageable with anti-hypertensive drugs. 
Within the all regorafenib safety database one event of hypertensive crisis associated with 
development of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) was observed.  
Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) was observed in 47% of patients treated with regorafenib. Most 
events were of grade 1 or 2 severity, grade 3 events were observed in 16.6% of patients, 
whereas no grade 4 was reported. HFS AEs could usually be managed by dose reductions or 
interruptions. HFS led to permanent discontinuation, dose reduction and interruption in 7 
(1.4%), 92 (18.4%) and 96 (19.2%) regorafenib treated patients, respectively. 
Rash was experienced in around 47% of regorafenib-treated, with time to first onset within the 
first 8 weeks of therapy. Events were generally mild or moderate in severity and led to dose 
modifications in a low percentage of patients (2.8%). Data on skin toxicity and recommended 
dose modifications for management of HFS and rash are reflected in the SPC.  
Gastrointestinal toxicity was also frequently observed (especially diarrhoea [42.8%] and 
mucositis/stomatitis [28.8%]) but events were generally of mild and moderate severity and 
considered manageable. In toxicology studies atrophy of the tongue has been observed in mice 
and rats, but no information regarding reporting of such AE in clinical studies has been provided 
by the Applicant. 
Cardiac events have been observed in 8-26% of patients treated with regorafenib in different 
studies. An increased frequency of myocardial ischemia and infarction has been associated with 
treatment with regorafenib (1.2% vs 0.4% with regorafenib vs placebo, respectively) in the 
pivotal study, with a slightly increased risk in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. The 
incidence of other thromboembolic events did not appear to be significantly influenced by 
treatment with regorafenib. More patients treated with regorafenib compared with placebo (9.8% 
vs 7.1%) in the pivotal study experienced congestive heart failure and related symptoms, but as 
the difference was primarily due to peripheral oedema and no routine evaluation of LVEF was 
performed, the clinical relevance of such findings is unclear. By analysis of study 14814, 
evaluating the effect of regorafenib on LVEF and QT prolongation, regorafenib does not appear to 
significantly affect LVEF% and QTc interval. In the pivotal trial the incidence of atrial fibrillation 
was higher in the regorafenib arm. The reason of this increased incidence could be that there 
were more patients with supraventricular arrhythmias history in regorafenib group at baseline 
(5.0% of patients with a baseline history of supraventricular arrhythmias in the regorafenib 
group compared to 2.5% of patients in the placebo group). 
Haemorrhage/bleeding events were reported in 20.4% of regorafenib-treated patients versus 
6.7% of placebo-treated patients in the pivotal study, with most of events being either grade 1 
(17.0% vs 4.7%) or grade 2 (1.4% vs 1.2%) and very few grade 3/4 events (1.4% vs 0.8%). 
The most common bleeding AE (any grade) in both treatment groups was haemorrhage

pulmonary/nose (8.8% vs 2.4%), followed by haemorrhage anus (3.2% vs 0.4%), urinary (2.2% 
vs 1.2%), rectum (1.2% vs 0%), and others (2% vs 0%). A total of 4 patients (0.8%) in the 
regorafenib arm vs no patient in the placebo arm experienced fatal bleedings, 3 of them 
considered as drug-related. A clear relation between haemorrhages and thrombocytopenia 
and/or alteration of coagulation parameters observed in regorafenib treated patients could not be 
made. In Pool 3, all reported respiratory tract haemorrhage (haemoptysis in 1 placebo patient, 
pulmonary haemorrhage in 2 regorafenib patients, 1 of which fatal) occurred in patients with 
baseline or lung metastases. 
Similar to other inhibitors of the VEGFR pathway, a slightly increased incidence of 
gastrointestinal perforation or fistula was observed with regorafenib (0.8 vs 0.4%, respectively), 
although analysis is hampered by confounding factors related to underlying disease. By 
cumulative review of all regorafenib treated patients in the safety database, 7 cases, 4 of which 
fatal, were considered by the investigators as possibly related to regorafenib. No specific 
population was identified to be at higher risk. 
Hyperbilirubinemia (probably related to impaired glucuronidation through UGT1A1 inhibition) and 
liver enzyme (AST/ALT) abnormalities were commonly observed with regorafenib (13%, 45% 
and 65%, respectively), and with higher incidence compared with placebo (hyperbilirubinemia: 
6.7%). Most of events were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Two cases meeting Hyâ€™s Law criteria and 3 
cases of severe drug-induced liver injury (DILI) events were described.  
The most common hepatobiliary disorders in the pivotal study were hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic 
function abnormal, hepatic pain, and hepatic failure. Serious hepatobiliary disorders (including 
fatal events) were reported in 5.4% of patients treated with regorafenib, and more frequently 
than in placebo patients.  There were 11 deaths due to hepatobiliary disorders, 3 (1.2%) in the 
placebo group and 8 (1.6%) in the regorafenib group. Hepatobiliary events resulting in death 
included one event of cholestasis (placebo group); 7 events of hepatic failure (placebo, 1; 
regorafenib, 6); and 3 events of hepatic function abnormal (placebo, 1; regorafenib, 2). 
Proteinuria was more frequently reported in the regorafenib group compared with the placebo 
group  of the pivotal study (8% vs 2.4) with 7% and 1.6%, respectively, considered related to 
study drug. Most events were grade 1 or 2. Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in 8 (1.6%) and 1 
(0.4%) patient in the regorafenib and placebo arm, respectively. No grade 4 or 5, neither SAE of 
proteinuria was reported. No cases of proteinuria resulting in acute renal failure were observed. 
Proteinuria AEs were usually observed within the first 2 cycles of therapy and could usually be 
managed by dose reductions or interruptions. Proteinuria led to permanent discontinuation, dose 
reduction and interruption in 2 (0.4%), 3 (0.6%) and 6 (1.2%) regorafenib treated patients, 
respectively. Asian patients treated with regorafenib had a higher incidence of proteinuria 
compared with White patients (27/74, 36.5% vs 10/389, 2.6%). The rate of protenuria events, 
mainly Grade 1 and 2, was consistent between the pivotal trial (8.6%) and the pooled 
monotherapy safety set (8.2%). In 17 of the 43 patients in the pivotal trial (39.5%) and in 22 of 
the 63 patients in the pooled safety set (34.9%) the proteinuria event was registered as not 
recovered/not resolved. Considering that in one third of patients proteinuria does not recovered 
and renal failure cases, mainly secondary to dehydration due to diarrhoea/vomiting, have been 
reported from Eudravigilance, the Applicant should add information on cases with not recovery of

Renal failure was reported in <5% of patients treated with regorafenib in the studies performed 
and in the pivotal study the incidence of renal failure was slightly but not significantly higher in 
the regorafenib arm compared with the placebo arm (2.2% vs 1.6%). Most of events were grade 
3 (1.8% vs 1.2% of cases), no grade 4 events and one grade 5 event were observed in the 
regorafenib arm. Increase in creatinine laboratory data was similar in both arms (15%).   
No cases of impaired wound healing were observed in the pivotal study, whereas according to a 
cumulative review of all patients treated with regorafenib up to 31 December 2011 a total of 6 
cases were reported (5 serious and 1 non-serious), one of which treated with placebo. 
Information over this AE has been added to the SPC. 
No cases of interstitial lung disease have been reported in patients treated with regorafenib. In 
the pivotal study the most common respiratory AEs were dysphonia (30% vs 6.3%), dyspnoea 
(17% vs 12.6%), and cough (10.6% vs 10.7%) with overall a similar incidence of serious 
respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal events. 
In all 3 pools, the frequency of pulmonary embolism events in regorafenib-treated patients (Pool 
3: 0.8%; Pool 2: 2.4%; Pool 1: 1.1%) and other venous thromboembolic events (Pool 3: 1.2%; 
Pool 2: 2.4%; Pool 1: 0.5%) was relatively low, and, in Pool 3 it was similar to the placebo group 
(1.2% and 0.8%, respectively). 
In in vitro assays a potential for phototoxicity was identified for regorafenib and its active 
metabolites M2 and M5, but it was not confirmed in pre-clinical models and only 0.5% of patients 
in the pivotal study reported phototoxicity related events, all of grade 1 severity. 
The  effect  of  regorafenib  on  QT  interval  was  evaluated  in  Study  14814,  conducted  in  patients 
with  advanced  solid  tumours,  where  ECGs  are  collected  by  Holter  monitoring  over  24  hours  at 
baseline  and  after  at  least  one  21  day  cycle  of  treatment.  Overall,  the  effect  of  regorafenib  at 
tmax  on  the  QTc  intervals  of  the  ECG  was  very  limited,  and  even  with  the  most  conservative 
evaluation, the maximal median change was modest and unlikely to be of clinical significance in 
the  setting  of  cancer  treatment.  In  the  ECG  assessment  related  to  the  pivotal  14387  study,  a 
12-lead  ECG  was  performed  on  Day  1  of  each  cycle  for  the  first  6  cycles  (and  at  subsequent 
cycles at the investigatorâ€™s discretion). A similar percentage of patients in either treatment group 
(regorafenib  and  placebo)  had  a  QTcB  or  QTcF  increase  >  60  ms  from  baseline  at  end  of 
treatment evaluation (QTcB: 3.2% vs 3.4%; QTcF: 2.2% vs 2.7%). For both QTcB and QTcF, a 
higher  percentage  of  regorafenib-treated  patients  than  placebo-treated  patients  had  a  QTcB  or 
QTcF increase > 30 - < 60 ms from baseline (QTcB: 12.9% vs 5.5%, respectively; QTcF: 7.2% 
vs  2.7%,  respectively).  For  patients  in  both  groups,  the  QTcF  and  QTcB  remained  relatively 
constant for the duration of the study. In an analysis of AEs which could be potentially related to 
QT  prolongation  observed  in  patients  enrolled  in  Study  14814  and  the  pivotal  study  14387,  no 
safety  signals  suggesting  a  correlation  between  QT  prolongation  and  such  events  could  be 
identified.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Common SAEs in 1-3 Pools included general physical health deterioration, pyrexia, abdominal 
pain, pneumonia, dyspnoea, fatigue, urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, decreased appetite and 
infection. 
In Pool 3 (pivotal 14387 study), incidence of SAEs was slightly higher with regorafenib compared 
with placebo (43.8% vs 39.5%). SAEs were mostly related to general physical health 
deterioration (7.2% vs 9.5%) and not considered related to study drug. In the regorafenib arm, 
there was a higher incidence of the SAEs pyrexia (2.8% vs 0.4%), abdominal pain (2.4% vs. 
0.8%), diarrhoea (1.6% vs 0%), hepatic failure (1.4% vs. 0.8%), haemorrhages (1% vs 0%), 
and jaundice (0.4% vs 0%), whereas incidence of pneumonia (2.0% vs 1.6%) and dyspnoea 
(2.0% vs 1.2%) was similar between the two arms. 
In Pool 2 the most frequently reported SAEs were fatigue (4.8%), chest pain (3.6%), pneumonia 
(3.6%), urinary tract infection (3.6%) and dyspnoea (3.6%). Two haemorrhage SAEs (3.6%) 
and 1 hypertensive crisis were also reported. 
In Pool 1 the most frequently reported SAEs were similar to Pool 2 and 3 and consisted of 
infection (4.3%), fatigue (3.7%), abdominal pain (3.2%), diarrhoea (3.2%), and physical 
deterioration (2.7%). One case of cerebral haemorrhage SAE and 4 cases of hypertension SAE 
(2.1%) were also seen. 
Deaths 
Across patients enrolled in Pool 1-3, a total of 138 death events occurred during treatment and 
up to 30 days after treatment discontinuation, the majority (111 deaths) of which were 
associated with disease progression. Across all pools, the most common cause of death other 
than disease progression in regorafenib-treated patients was haemorrhage (4 patients: 
gastrointestinal, vaginal, pulmonary, and intracranial haemorrhages, respectively), cardiac arrest 
(3 patients), and pneumonia (3 patients). 
In Pool 3, there were 110 total deaths reported, with a slightly higher frequency in the placebo 
group (13.6% with regorafenib vs 16.2% with placebo). Deaths not associated with disease 
progression represented a minority of the events and, in the regorafenib group, included 
3 patients with haemorrhage (1 gastrointestinal, 1 vaginal, and 1 pulmonary haemorrhages), 
2 patients with death due to pneumonia, 1 patient with cardiac arrest, 1 patient with general 
physical health deterioration, 1 intestinal obstruction, 1 cerebrovascular accident, 1 sudden death 
and 1 death unknown. Deaths not associated with disease progression in the placebo group 
included 2 sudden deaths, 2 pneumonias, 1 cardiac arrest and 1other death not further specified.  
In Pool 1, there were 21 deaths, 12 associated with disease progression. Deaths not associated 
with disease progression included 2 cardiac arrest, 1 pulmonary embolism, 1 pneumonia, 1 
haemoptysis, 1 haematoma, 1 intracranial haemorrhage; 1 intestinal obstruction; and 1 ascites. 
In Pool 2, of the 7 deaths observed, 6 were associated with disease progression and one was 
classified as â€˜otherâ€™.

Regarding thyroid function tests (TSH, fT3 and fT4) as observed in the pivotal study, a higher 
mean increase of TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone, thyrotropin) and decrease of fT3 
(triiodothyronine) from baseline was reported in patients treated with regorafenib compared with 
placebo. In general, mean and median values of thyroid function tests were similar between 
baseline and end of treatment with the exception of TSH in the regorafenib arm where mean and 
median values at end of treatment were approximately twice the values at baseline.

Safety in special populations 
A population PK analysis of the pivotal study in order to evaluate the influence of intrinsic factors 
(age, gender, body weight, ethnicity, renal and hepatic functions) on PK was submitted.  
No safety data of regorafenib in paediatric patients are available, as there is no relevant use of 
Stivarga in paediatric patients in the colorectal cancer indication. Important safety information 
regarding the elderly population is in presented in the following Table 15. 
Table 15: Overview of adverse events by age group, study 14387, safety population 
The incidence of AEs was similar for female patients and male patients overall (98.3% females vs 
98.9% males), in the regorafenib group (100% vs 99.3%) and in the placebo group (95.0% vs 
98.0%) of the pivotal study.

In  the  pivotal  14387  study,  the  overall  incidence  of  any  AE  and  the  incidence  of  most  of  the 
common  AEs  was  similar  among  race  groups.  In  the  regorafenib  group,  compared  with 
Caucasians,  there  was  a  higher  incidence  in  Asians  of  palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome (78.4% vs 38%), rash (40.5% vs 19.3%), and hypertension (54.1% vs 16.5%); and a 
lower  incidence  of  asthenia  (1.4%  vs  28.8%),  abdominal  pain  (4.1%  vs  22.4%),  mucosal 
inflammation (4.1% vs 18.3%), dyspnoea (8.1% vs 18%), hyperbilirubinemia (8.1% vs 14.7%), 
diarrhoea  (28.4%  vs  45.8%),  weight  decrease  (20.3%  vs  33.9%),  and  anaemia  (1.4%  vs 
12.9%).  However,  overall  the  same  AEs  were  seen  in  all  groups.  Moreover,  as  the  majority  of 
patients treated were Whites, no firm conclusion can be made regarding other ethnic groups, in 
particular Blacks and Other. 
No  studies  specifically  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment  have  been  conducted.  All  patients 
included in the studies performed with regorafenib to date were required to have bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5x 
ULN  and  AST/ALT  â‰¤  2.5  or  5x  ULN  in  case  of  liver  metastases.  No  relevant  safety  data  is 
available for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  
An  analysis  has  been  provided  where  AEs  observed  in  the  pivotal  14387  study  were  reported 
according  to  three  categories  of  AST  and  ALT  at  baseline:  a)  â‰¤  1.5  x  ULN  (666 patients ,  440 
patients treated with regorafenib and 226 treated with placebo); b) > 1.5 xULN and â‰¤ 3xULN (67 
patients,  44  patients  treated  with  regorafenib  and  23  treated  with  placebo);  c)  <3  xULN  (7 
patients, 2 patients treated with regorafenib and 5 treated with placebo). Very few patients were 
enrolled in the third category to draw any meaningful conclusion. In the second category, more 
patients  treated  with  regorafenib  experienced  AEs  of  stomatitis  (25.0%,  vs.  17.0%  overall), 
dyspnoea  (34.1%  vs.  17.0%  overall),  hyperbilirubinemia  (22.7%  vs.  13.0%  overall),  general 
physical  health  deterioration  (25.0%  vs.  9.2%),  and  peripheral  oedema  (22.7%  vs  9.2% 
overall).  For  patients  with  normal  hepatic  function  at  baseline  (first  category),  the  incidence  of 
SAEs was similar between treatment groups (42.8% with regorafenib and 38.5% with placebo); 
in the second category, the incidence of SAEs was higher in the regorafenib group (52.3%) and 
similar to the normal hepatic function group in the placebo arm (39.1%). 
No  studies  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  have  been  conducted.  All  patients  included  in  the 
studies  performed  with  regorafenib  to  date  were  required  to  have  serum  creatinin  â‰¤  1.5x  ULN 
and  estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  (eGFR)  â‰¥  30  ml/min/1.73  m2  according  to  the  MDRD 
(modified diet in renal disease) abbreviated formula. Renal function was considered normal when 
eGFR  was  â‰¥  60  mL/min/1.73  mÂ²,  and  moderately  impaired  when  eGFR  was  <60  mL/min/1.73 
mÂ².  No  relevant  pharmacokinetics  and  safety  data  is  available  for  patients  with  severe  renal 
impairment. 
In the pivotal 14387 study (Pool 3), 30 patients had moderate renal impairment at baseline (21 
treated  with  regorafenib  and  9  with  placebo).  The  incidence  of  most  common  AEs  was  similar 
between  normal  and  moderately  renally  impaired  patients.  In  the  regorafenib  +BSC  group, 
patients  with  impaired  renal  function  had  a  higher  incidence  (>10%)  of  reported  AEs  of 
decreased  appetite  (57.1%  vs  46.8%  overall),  diarrhoea  (52.4%  vs  42.8%  overall),  dysphonia 
(47.6%  vs.  30.0%  overall),  rash  (33.3%  vs.  22.0%  overall),  anaemia  (28.6%  vs.  11.0% 
overall), and peripheral oedema (19.0% vs. 9.2% overall). 
In  the  phase  1  dose  escalating  11650  study,  a  pharmacokinetic  analysis  performed  on  patients 
grouped  according  to  renal  function  (according  to  MDRD  equation)  showed  no  differences  in

regorafenib  AUC  or  Cmax  between  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment  and  those  with  normal 
renal function. 
In conclusion, very few patients with impaired renal function (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) have 
been treated with regorafenib in the pivotal trial. A higher rate of drug-related SAEs has been 
reported in patients with moderately impaired kidney function vs normal/mildly impaired kidney 
function (28.6% vs 11.1%). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Please refer to pharmacokinetic drug interactions and the discussion on clinical pharmacology.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Fewer regorafenib-treated patients discontinued in Pool 3 (17.6%) than in Pool 2 (29.8%) or Pool 
1 (31.9%). In Pool 3 treatment discontinuation occurred more frequently with regorafenib 
(17.6%) compared with placebo (12.6%). The most frequent AEs causing regorafenib 
discontinuation were general physical health deterioration (3.6%), palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (1.4%) and hepatic failure (0.8%) in Pool 3, chest pain (2.4%), 
fatigue (2.4%), hyperbilirubinemia (2.4%), and small intestinal obstruction (2.4%) in Pool 2, and 
fatigue (3.7%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (1.6%), renal failure (1.6%), and 
thrombocytopenia (1.6%) in Pool 1. 
Dose reductions were reported in 37.6% of regorafenib-treated patients in Pool 3, 39.4% in Pool 
1 and 22.6% in Pool 2. In Pool 3 (pivotal 14387 study) dose reductions occurred more frequently 
with regorafenib (37.6%) compared with placebo (3.2%). The most frequent AEs causing 
regorafenib dose reductions in Pool 3 and 1 were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome 
(18.2% in Pool 3 and 17.6% in Pool 1) and diarrhoea (3.8% and 4.8%, respectively), which were 
also the most common regorafenib-related AEs in both Pools. In Pool 2, the most common AEs 
causing dose reduction were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (6%), blister (4.8%), 
skin exfoliation (3.6%), and pain in extremity (3.6%). In Pool 3, other reasons for regorafenib 
dose reductions were hypertension (3.2%), fatigue (2%), rash (2%) and mucosal inflammation 
(1.2%). These were observed also in Pool 1 and 2 with similar frequencies. 
Regarding AEs leading to dose interruptions, there was a higher incidence of dose interruptions in 
regorafenib treated patients in Pool 3 (60.8%) than in Pool 2 (39.3%) or Pool 1 (51.1%), and 
within Pool 3, in regorafenib (60.8%) compared to placebo (21.7%) arm. The most common AEs 
causing dose interruption in Pool 3 and Pool 1 were palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome (18.8% and 11.2%, respectively) and diarrhoea (6.2% and 6.4%), followed by, in Pool 
3, pyrexia (4.6%), fatigue (4%), rash (3.6%), hyperbilirubinaemia (3.6%), hypertension (2.6%). 
Similar incidences were reported in Pool 1 and 2.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of regorafenib (Stivarga) was consistent across studies and is typical 
for a small molecule with targeted inhibition of the VEGFR and other tyrosine kinase-mediated 
pathways: hypertension, skin (hand-foot syndrome, rash) and gastrointestinal toxicities 
(diarrhoea, mucositis) were prominent, whereas haematologic toxicities were limited. 
The analysis of the safety profile of the drug is hampered by the limited safety follow-up. 
Moreover, in all the phase I-III studies performed to date patients with regorafenib history of 
hepatic or renal impairment or with on-going or recent cardiovascular diseases were excluded. 
In the pivotal 14387 study, AEs more frequently observed (â‰¥10% difference) with regorafenib 
compared with placebo were fatigue (63.4% vs 46.2%), hand-foot syndrome (47.0% vs 7.5%), 
anorexia (46.8% vs 28.5%), diarrhoea (42.8% vs 17.0%), weight loss (32.0% vs 11.1%), 
dysphonia (32.0% vs 6.3%), hypertension (30.4% vs 7.9%), rash/desquamation (29.0% vs 
5.1%), mucositis/stomatitis (28.8% vs 4.7%), fever (28.4% vs 15.4%), hyperbilirubinemia 
(20.0% vs 9.5%), platelet counts abnormalities (15.6% vs 2.4%), haemorrhage (20.4% vs 
6.7%) and infections (25.2% vs 14.2%). The difference was mainly due to a higher incidence of 
grade 1-3 events. 
In the pivotal trial, the overall incidence of hypertension was 30.4% in patients treated with 
Stivarga and 7.9% in patients receiving placebo. Most cases of hypertension in patients treated 
with Stivarga appeared during the first cycle of treatment and were mild to moderate in severity 
(Grades 1 and 2: 22.8%). The incidence of Grade 3 hypertension was 7.6%.  
Blood pressure should be controlled prior to initiation of treatment with Stivarga. It is 
recommended to monitor blood pressure and to treat hypertension in accordance with standard 
medical practice. In cases of severe or persistent hypertension despite adequate medical 
management, treatment should be temporarily interrupted and/or the dose reduced at the 
discretion of the physician. In case of hypertensive crisis, treatment should be discontinued. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been reported in association with 
Stivarga treatment. Signs and symptoms of PRES include seizures, headache, altered mental 
status, visual disturbance or cortical blindness, with or without associated hypertension. A 
diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging. In patients developing PRES, 
discontinuation of Stivarga, along with control of hypertension and supportive medical 
management of other symptoms is recommended. 
In the placebo controlled phase III trial in patients with metastatic CRC the overall incidence of 
hand foot skin reactions was 45.2% in patients treated with Stivarga as compared to 7.1% in 
patients receiving placebo. Most cases of hand foot skin reactions were mild to moderate in 
severity (Grades 1 and 2: 28.6%) and most appeared during the first cycle of treatment with 
Stivarga. 
Rash was experienced in around 47% of regorafenib-treated patients in the pivotal and other 
studies, with time to first onset within the first 8 weeks of therapy. Events were generally mild or 
moderate in severity and led to dose modifications in a low percentage of patients (2.8%). 
Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome and rash 
represent the most frequently observed dermatological adverse reactions with Stivarga. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 76/91 
 
  
  
Measures for the prevention of HFSR include control of calluses and use of shoe cushions and 
gloves to prevent pressure stress to soles and palms. Management of HFSR may include the use 
of keratolytic creams (e.g. urea-, salicylic acid-, or alpha hydroxyl acid-based creams applied 
sparingly only on affected areas) and moisturizing creams (applied liberally) for symptomatic 
relief. Dose reduction and/or temporary interruption of Stivarga, or in severe or persistent cases, 
permanent discontinuation of Stivarga should be considered. 
Gastrointestinal toxicity was also very commonly observed (especially diarrhoea [42.8%] and 
mucositis/stomatitis [28.8%]) but events were generally of mild and moderate severity and 
considered manageable. In toxicology studies, atrophy of the tongue has been observed in mice 
and rats, but has not been reported in patients. 
Stivarga has been associated with an increased incidence of myocardial ischaemia and infarction. 
Patients with unstable angina or new onset angina (within 3 months of starting Stivarga 
therapy), recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months of starting Stivarga therapy) and those 
with cardiac failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification 2 or higher were excluded 
from the clinical studies. 
Patients with a history of ischaemic heart disease should be monitored for clinical signs and 
symptoms of myocardial ischaemia. In patients who develop cardiac ischaemia and/or infarction, 
interruption of Stivarga is recommended until resolution. The decision to re start Stivarga 
therapy should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks of the 
individual patient. Stivarga should be permanently discontinued if there is no resolution. 
Stivarga has been associated with an increased incidence of haemorrhagic events, some of which 
were fatal. In the pivotal trial, the overall incidence of haemorrhage was 21.4% in patients 
treated with Stivarga as compared to 7.5% in patients receiving placebo. Most cases of bleeding 
events in patients treated with Stivarga were mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 and 2: 
19.2%), most notably epistaxis (8.8%). Fatal events in patients treated with Stivarga were 
uncommon (0.8%), and involved the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Blood 
counts and coagulation parameters should be monitored in patients with conditions predisposing 
to bleeding, and in those treated with anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin and phenprocoumon) or 
other concomitant medicinal products that increase the risk of bleeding. In the event of severe 
bleeding necessitating urgent medical intervention, permanent discontinuation of Stivarga should 
be considered. 
Gastrointestinal perforation and fistulae have been reported in patients treated with Stivarga. 
These events are also known to be common disease related complications in patients with intra-
abdominal malignancies. Discontinuation of Stivarga is recommended in patients developing 
gastrointestinal perforation or fistula.  
Abnormalities of liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase 
[AST] and bilirubin) have been frequently observed in patients treated with Stivarga. Severe liver 
function test abnormalities (Grade 3 to 4) and hepatic dysfunction with clinical manifestations 
(including fatal outcomes) have been reported in 3 out of more than 1,100 Stivarga treated 
patients across all clinical trials (0.3%). Two of the patients had liver metastases. Liver 
dysfunction in these patients had an onset within the first 2 months of therapy, and was 
characterised by a hepatocellular pattern of injury with transaminase elevations >20xULN, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 77/91 
 
  
  
followed by bilirubin increase. Liver biopsies in 2 patients revealed hepatocellular necrosis with 
inflammatory cell infiltration. 
It is recommended to perform liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) before initiation of 
treatment with Stivarga and monitor closely (at least every two weeks) during the first 2 months 
of treatment. Thereafter, periodic monitoring should be continued at least monthly and as 
clinically indicated.  
Regorafenib is a uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A1 inhibitor. Mild, indirect 
(unconjugated) hyperbilirubinaemia may occur in patients with Gilbertâ€™s syndrome. 
For patients with observed worsening of liver function tests considered related to treatment with 
Stivarga (i.e. where no alternative cause is evident, such as post hepatic cholestasis or disease 
progression), the dose modification and monitoring advice in Table 2 should be followed. 
Regorafenib is eliminated mainly via the hepatic route. Close monitoring of the overall safety is 
recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (see also sections 4.2 and 
5.2). Stivarga is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child 
Pugh C) as Stivarga has not been studied in this population and exposure might be increased in 
these patients.Proteinuria was more frequently reported in regorafenib-treated compared with 
placebo-treated patients in the pivotal study (8% vs 2.4%, grade 3: 1.6% vs 0.4%) with most 
events considered related to study drug.  
In the pivotal trial, the overall incidence of treatment emergent proteinuria was 7.4%  in patients 
treated with Stivarga as compared to 2.4% in patients receiving placebo . Of these events, 
40.5% in the Stivarga arm and 66.7% in the placebo arm have been reported as not recovered / 
not resolved. No grade 4 or 5, neither proteinuria SAE nor proteinuria resulting in acute renal 
failure was observed. Proteinuria AEs were usually observed within the first 2 cycles of therapy 
and could usually be managed by dose reductions (0.6%) or interruptions (1.2%). Permanent 
discontinuation due to proteinuria was reported in 0.4% of patients. Renal failure was reported in 
<5% of patients treated with regorafenib in the studies performed and in the pivotal study the 
incidence of renal failure was slightly but not significantly higher in the regorafenib arm 
compared with the placebo arm (2.2% vs 1.6%). Most of events were grade 3 (1.8% vs 1.2% of 
cases). Renal failure and proteinuria was observed in patients as a result of treatment with 
regorafenib. Although proteinuria is a known class effect of TKI, the overall number of patients 
with renal failure is limited. 
No cases of impaired wound healing were observed in the pivotal study, whereas according to a 
cumulative review of all patients treated with regorafenib up to 31 December 2011 a total of 6 
cases were reported (5 serious and 1 non-serious), one of which treated with placebo. As 
medicinal products with anti angiogenic properties may suppress or interfere with wound healing, 
temporary interruption of Stivarga is recommended for precautionary reasons in patients 
undergoing major surgical procedures. The decision to resume treatment with Stivarga following 
major surgical intervention should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. 
Each daily dose of 160 mg of Stivarga contains 2.427 mmol (or 55.8 mg) of sodium which should 
be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. Moreover, each daily dose of 
160 mg contains 1.68 mg of lecithin (derived from soya).

In the pivotal trial, infections were more often observed in patients treated with Stivarga as 
compared to patients receiving placebo (all grades: 30.8% vs. 17.0%). Most infections in 
patients treated with Stivarga were mild to moderate in severity (Grades 1 and 2: 22.0%), and 
included urinary tract infections (7.2%) as well as mucocutaneous and systemic fungal infections 
(6.6%). No difference in fatal outcomes associated with infection between treatment groups was 
observed (0.6%, Stivarga arm vs. 0.8%, placebo arm). 
No cases of interstitial lung disease have been reported in patients treated with regorafenib. 
In in vitro assays as potential read-out for phototoxicity was identified for regorafenib and its 
active metabolites M2 and M5. Furthermore, reporting in the SmPC of ADRs observed with low 
frequency to date but considered of clinical relevance for the population treated (e.g. Steven 
Johnson syndrome) is considered important, in view also of the relatively short safety follow-up 
available.  
Stivarga has been associated with an increased incidence of electrolyte abnormalities (including 
hypophosphatemia, hypocalcaemia, hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia) and metabolic 
abnormalities (including increases in thyroid stimulating hormone, lipase and amylase). The 
abnormalities are generally of mild to moderate severity, not associated with clinical 
manifestations, and do not usually require dose interruptions or reductions. It is recommended to 
monitor biochemical and metabolic parameters during Stivarga treatment and to institute 
appropriate replacement therapy according to standard clinical practice if required. Dose 
interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation of Stivarga should be considered in case 
of persistent or recurrent significant abnormalities (see section 4.2). 
Overall, tests on thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) showed post baseline >ULN in 23.1% in the 
regorafenib and 13.3% in the placebo arm. TSH post baseline >4 times ULN was reported in 
4.0% in the regorafenib arm and in no patients in the placebo arm. Concentration of free 
triiodothyronine (FT3) post baseline below lower limit of normal (< LLN) was reported in 20.8% 
in the regorafenib arm and 15.7% in the placebo arm. Concentration of free thyroxin (FT4) post 
baseline <LLN was reported in 8.5% in regorafenib arm and 7.2% in the placebo arm. 
Regarding the elderly, the overall incidence of any AE and the incidence of most of the common 
AEs across clinical studies was similar between age groups (<65 years, â‰¥65 years). The 
incidence of AEs and SAEs (42.5 vs 44.6%) was similar between the two age groups. 
Hypertension (28% vs 34.2%), anorexia (42.7% vs 53.4%) and headache (8.5% vs 13%) were 
more frequently reported in â‰¥65 years old patients treated with regorafenib compared with <65 
years old, whereas HFS (48.5% vs 39.4%), hyperbilirubinemia (15% vs 9.8%) and back pain 
(15% vs 8.8%) were more frequent in the younger (<65 years) subgroup of the population. With 
the exception of decreased appetite and headache, similar trends were seen in the placebo 
group. The rate of drug-related serious adverse events was higher in patients older than 65 
years (9.8% in aged <65; 15.5% in aged 65-74; 13.2% in aged 75-84), even if no difference 
was reported in terms of fatal cases. Moreover, based on the rate of dose modification across 
age group no differences can be highlighted, even if the limited number (53) of patients older 
than 75 years could have hampered the safety assessment in this subgroup.   
The highest dose of Stivarga studied clinically was 220 mg per day. The most frequently 
observed adverse drug reactions at this dose were dermatological events, dysphonia, diarrhoea, 
mucosal inflammation, dry mouth, decreased appetite, hypertension, and fatigue. There is no

specific antidote for Stivarga overdose. In the event of suspected overdose, Stivarga should be 
discontinued immediately, with best supportive care initiated by a medical professional, and the 
patient should be observed until clinical stabilisation. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of regorafenib shows consistency across studies and is similar to the profile of 
other anti-angiogenic and multi-kinase inhibitors. Hypertension, skin (hand-foot syndrome, 
rash) and gastrointestinal toxicities (diarrhoea, mucositis) were prominent, whereas 
hematologic toxicities were limited. Hyperbilirubinaemia and liver enzymes aberrations were 
frequently observed with regorafenib, especially in patients with liver metastases. 
Haemorrhages, with fatal outcome in few cases, as well as myocardial ischemia and infarction 
have been reported with regorafenib. 
Overall the toxicity related to regorafenib treatment appears to be manageable, but not 
negligible. In any case toxicity of regorafenib does not seem to be out of balance when 
compared to other anti-angiogenic and multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors, like sorafenib. 
The full evaluation of the safety profile of the drug is limited by the paucity of a long-term 
safety database. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 1.4, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for regorafenib (Stivarga) in the treatment of 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have been previously treated with, or are 
not considered candidates for fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, 
if KRAS wild type, an anti-EGFR therapy is acceptable. 
The following minor revision is recommended for the next RMP update:

The CHMP endorsed the PRAC advice with changes. 
These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 84/91 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
- activity in KRAS mutant tumours 
- identification of biomarkers to further aid definition of the target population 
The CHMP justified these changes as follows: 
In the pivotal study, the results of secondary endpoints reporting the majority of patients 
experiencing early disease progression at the time of the first radiological evaluation suggest a 
benefit limited to a subgroup of the population treated. In view of the substantial, although 
manageable, toxicity of the drug, identification of patient/tumour characteristics for proper 
patient selection is important, in order to avoid (unnecessary) exposure of patients in the last 
weeks of their life to a toxic drug. Biomarker analyses from two prospective studies (15808 
[CONCUR] and 15983) could provide some further insights into the potentially differential activity 
of regorafenib in patients with wild-type or mutant KRAS tumours. Moreover, additional 
biomarkers will be explored in studies 15808, 15983 and other future studies, guided by the 
scientific literature and with the intention of improving patient selection. Annual updates will be 
submitted for regulatory review. 
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted 
by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human 
use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The results of the pivotal study, based on the second interim analysis performed after 432 
(56.8%) death events, showed a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of 
OS for regorafenib plus BSC compared with placebo plus BSC (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.636-0.942, 
p=0.005178), with a gain in median OS of 1.5 months in favour of regorafenib (median OS 196 
days vs 151 days, respectively). The results were consistent at an updated OS analysis 
performed with later cut-off, when 97% (566) of the planned death events occurred and before 
cross over was allowed (median OS 194 vs 152 days, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.664, 0.939, 
p=0.003791). The effect on OS was observed in several subgroups of the population. Of 
particular interest, the OS effect appears to be maintained also despite previous treatment with 
other VEGF inhibitors (i.e., bevacizumab). No imbalance in post-study therapies between the two 
study arms was observed from the data provided in both analyses. 
The OS results appeared to be supported by the investigator-assessed PFS data (secondary 
study endpoint). A statistically significant increase in PFS was observed with regorafenib 
compared with placebo (HR 0.494, 95% CI 0.419-0.582, p<0.000001. Median PFS was formally 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 85/91 
 
  
  
59 vs 52 days with regorafenib and placebo, respectively. PFS improvement was observed in all 
the subgroups explored according to Cox regression model.  
Overall response rate (ORR: CR+PR) was very low and similar between the two treatment arms 
(1% with regorafenib and 0.4% with placebo). Disease control rate was significantly higher in the 
regorafenib arm compared with the placebo arm (41% vs 14.9%, respectively). However, 
duration of disease stabilisation was very similar between the two study arms (60 vs 52 days, 
respectively). 
Considering the sought indication in a late stage of disease, the oral formulation of regorafenib 
could be perceived by patients as an advantage allowing the home-based care treatment. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The clinical relevance of the observed difference in PFS is unclear, as the gain in median PFS 
associated with regorafenib was only 1 week (59 vs 52 days, respectively). However, the 
analysis was confounded by the timing of the radiological evaluation. Indeed, at the time of the 
first PFS assessment (8 weeks) 58% of regorafenib treated patients had experienced disease 
progression already.  
Moreover, the reliability of the PFS results could be questioned, as an investigator-driven bias 
cannot be ruled out completely considering that obvious differences in treatment induced 
toxicities between study arms might potentially have compromised the double-blind nature of the 
trial. 
The very high rate of patients not responding to treatment with regorafenib could suggest 
activity of the drug limited to a subgroup of the population. Unfortunately, from the analyses 
submitted, no specific biomarkers or other patient/tumour parameters were identified that could 
be used for patient selection. In patients enrolled in the CORRECT study, KRAS status seemed to 
poorly predict the PFS outcome with a statistically significant improvement being observed in 
patients with both mutated and wild type tumours. However, mutated KRAS status appeared to 
be associated with a worse PFS outcome regardless of treatment arm and in a multivariate 
analysis, KRAS mutation was consistently identified as potentially prognostic parameter in terms 
of OS and PFS. On the other hand, a differential activity of regorafenib was observed according 
to KRAS mutation status by Kaplan-Meier analysis, HRs and median values. Compared to the 
overall study population, an inferior difference was observed between the two study arms in 
terms of OS in patients with mutant KRAS tumours (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.67-1.12), whereas the 
difference in OS was not adversely affected in the smaller subgroup of patients with wild type 
KRAS tumours (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.80, p=0.007).  However, there was no evidence of 
heterogeneity in treatment effect (non-significant interaction test) and the analyses by KRAS 
tumour status were non-randomised comparisons. The exploratory nature of the subgroup 
analyses presented does not allow any firm conclusion over this issue.  
No significant difference between the two study arms was observed in the evaluation of Quality 
of life.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of regorafenib was consistent across studies and was typical for an 
angiogenetic and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor: hypertension, skin (hand-foot syndrome, rash) 
and gastrointestinal toxicities (diarrhoea, mucositis) were prominent, whereas hematologic 
toxicities were limited.  
In the pivotal 14387 study, Adverse Events (AEs) more frequently observed (â‰¥10% difference) 
with regorafenib compared with placebo were fatigue (63% vs 46.%, respectively), hand-foot 
syndrome (47.0% vs 7.5%), anorexia (47% vs 28%), diarrhoea (43% vs 17%), weight loss 
(32% vs 11%), dysphonia (32% vs 6%), hypertension (30% vs 8%), rash/desquamation (29% 
vs 5%), mucositis/stomatitis (29% vs 5%), fever (28% vs 15%), hyperbilirubinemia (20% vs 
9%), platelet counts abnormalities (16% vs 2%), haemorrhages (20% vs 7%) and infections 
(25% vs 14%). The difference was mainly due to a higher incidence of grade 1-3 events. 
Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) was observed in 47% of patients treated with regorafenib. Most 
events were of grade 1 or 2 severity, grade 3 events were observed in 17% of patients, whereas 
no grade 4 was reported. HFS AEs could usually be managed by dose reductions or interruptions. 
HFS led to permanent discontinuation, dose reduction and interruption in 7 (1.4%), 92 (18%) 
and 96 (19%) regorafenib treated patients, respectively. 
Cardiac events have been observed in 8-26% of patients treated with regorafenib in different 
studies. An increased frequency of myocardial ischemia and infarction has been associated with 
treatment with regorafenib (1.2% vs 0.4% with regorafenib vs placebo, respectively) in the 
pivotal study, with a slightly increased risk in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. 
Arrhythmias (especially atrial fibrillation) were reported with higher incidence in the regorafenib 
arm. The incidence of other thromboembolic events did not appear to be significantly influenced 
by treatment with regorafenib.  
The most common bleeding AE (any grade) in both treatment groups was haemorrhage 
pulmonary/nose (9% vs 2.4%) followed by haemorrhage anus (3% vs 0.4%), urinary (2.2% vs 
1.2%), rectum (1.2% vs 0%), and others (2% vs 0%). A total of 4 pts (0.8%) in the regorafenib 
arm vs no patient in the placebo arm experienced fatal bleedings, 3 of them considered as drug-
related. Patients experiencing bleeding events appeared to have often additional causative 
factors (e.g., anticoagulant use, liver cirrhosis, etc.), but a clear relation could not be made with 
thrombocytopenia and alteration of coagulation parameters observed in regorafenib treated 
patients.  
Similar to other inhibitors of the VEGFR pathway, a slightly increased incidence of 
gastrointestinal perforation or fistula was observed with regorafenib.  
Impaired wound healing was rarely reported (< 1%). 
Hyperbilirubinemia (probably related to impaired glucuronidation through UGT1A1 inhibition) and 
liver enzyme (AST/ALT) abnormalities were commonly observed with regorafenib (13%, 45% 
and 65%, respectively), and with higher incidence compared with placebo. Most of events were

grade 1 or 2 in severity. Two cases meeting Hyâ€™s Law criteria and 3 cases of severe drug-induced 
liver injury event were described.  
Renal failure was reported in <5% of patients treated with regorafenib in all the studies 
performed and in the pivotal study the incidence of renal failure was slightly but not significantly 
higher in the regorafenib arm compared with the placebo arm (2.2% vs 1.6). Most of events 
were grade 3 (1.8% vs 1.2% of cases). 
One event of hypertensive crisis associated with development of reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) has been reported.  
One case of serious and potentially life-threatening Steven-Johnson syndrome event has been 
observed. 
In the pivotal trial, the rate of study treatment discontinuation due to TEAE was higher in the 
regorafenib arm in comparison to placebo (17.6% versus 12.6%). Moreover, a dose modification 
was required in regorafenib patients almost twice as much as it was needed in placebo patients 
(regorafenib 75.6% vs placebo 38.3%), with a rate of dose reductions of 20% vs 3.2% in the 
regorafenib and  placebo arm, respectively. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Long term safety data are lacking. 
In all clinical studies performed to date, patients with history of moderate or severe hepatic 
dysfunction (including hyperbilirubinemia > 1.5 ULN or AST/ALT increase > 5 ULN) or severe 
renal impairment, with ECOG PS >1 or with ongoing or recent cardiovascular diseases were 
excluded. Limited information is available in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh B) and no data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). 
Very few patients with impaired renal function have been treated with regorafenib in the pivotal 
trial. 
The tolerability of the drug in patients with ECOG PS>1 is uncertain, as such patients were 
excluded from the pivotal phase III study. This is considered relevant as a worst performance 
status is not uncommon in patients treated in clinical practice.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Regorafenib is a new tyrosine kinase inhibitor proposed for the treatment of patients with mCRC 
that have exhausted, or are not candidate for, all the currently available standard anticancer 
treatment options. Therefore an unmet medical need for such population is readily 
acknowledged. 
In this context the results of the pivotal 14387 study are considered of potential clinical 
relevance. A statistically significant improvement in OS associated with treatment with 
regorafenib compared with placebo, and supported by a statistically significant improvement in 
PFS was observed. However, the absolute gain in median OS (1.5 months) is rather modest, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 88/91 
 
  
  
whereas the median improvement in PFS consists of few weeks at best (formally the difference in 
median PFS between treatment arms was only 1 week). The clinical relevance of these results is 
modest, considering also that ORR is negligible and that there is no clear indication of a positive 
effect of the treatment on disease symptoms or QoL.  
This modest clinical benefit has to weighed against the toxicity of regorafenib, which is, although 
manageable, substantial. Fatigue, hand-foot syndrome, anorexia, diarrhoea, weight loss, 
hypertension, rash, mucositis, fever, hyperbilirubinaemia, platelet count abnormalities, 
haemorrhage and infections were observed very commonly in patients treated with regorafenib, 
with a significantly higher incidence compared with placebo-treated patients. In particular, the 
incidence of AEs of special interest associated with regorafenib was very high (>30%), and 
appears to significantly increase overtime. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  efficacy  results  of  the  pivotal  14387  study  show  a  statistically  significant  OS  improvement 
associated  with  treatment  with  regorafenib  (median  OS  gain  of  1.5  months),  supported  by  a 
statistically  significant  improvement  in  delay  in  disease  progression.  Moreover,  a  low  rate  of 
tumour shrinkage was reported (1%) and evaluation of quality of life did not show any significant 
difference  between  the  two  treatment  arms  in  the  pivotal  study.  In  other  words,  the  modest 
prolongation in survival appears to be essentially related to disease stabilisation for a few weeks 
at best. 
Whether  this  could  translate  in  a  clinically  relevant  benefit  for  the  patients  treated  needs  to  be 
critically  weighed  with  the  observed/expected  drug-related  toxicity.  The  safety  profile  of 
regorafenib was consistent across studies and was typical for an angiogenesis and multi-tyrosine 
kinase  inhibitor:  hypertension,  skin  (hand-foot  syndrome,  rash)  and  gastrointestinal  toxicities 
(diarrhoea,  mucositis)  were  prominent,  whereas  haematologic  toxicities  were  limited.  Several 
adverse  events  able  to  affect  patientâ€™s  quality  of  life,  like  (abdominal)  pain,  fatigue,  anorexia, 
rash,  diarrhoea,  mucositis,  hand-foot  syndrome  and  hypertension  were  significantly  more 
frequently reported in patients treated with regorafenib compared with placebo. 
All together, the clinical relevance of the results appears to be modest. However, in the intended 
population of  patients  with  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  having  exhausted  all  currently  available 
therapeutic  options,  the  benefits  of  regorafenib  are considered to outweigh  the  risks  associated 
with its use.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
A statistically significant improvement in OS (median OS gain of 1.5 month) has been associated 
with treatment with regorafenib compared with placebo in the mCRC population enrolled in the 
pivotal Study 14387. However, the results of secondary endpoints reporting the majority of 
patients experiencing early disease progression at the time of the first radiological evaluation 
suggest a benefit limited to a subgroup of the population treated. In view of the substantial, 
although manageable, toxicity of the drug, identification of patient/tumour characteristics for 
proper patient selection is important, in order to avoid (unnecessary) exposure of patients in the 
last weeks of their life to a toxic drug.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/403683/2013 
Page 89/91 
 
  
  
Nevertheless, the available data do not currently support a restriction of the indication in any 
subpopulation of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer having exhausted all available 
therapeutic options. A differential activity of regorafenib was observed according to KRAS 
mutation status by Kaplan-Meier analysis, HRs and median values. However, there was no 
evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect (non-significant interaction test) and the trend 
towards a smaller observed benefit in the KRAS mutant subgroup might be at least partly 
explained by a higher rate of subsequent anti-cancer therapy in the KRAS-mutated placebo 
subgroup compared to the KRAS-mutated regorafenib subgroup. Additionally, the difference 
could be due to imbalances in baseline characteristics of the patients included in these subgroups 
and for these non-randomised comparisons. Overall, the exploratory nature of the subgroup 
analyses presented does not allow any firm conclusion over this issue. 
Biomarker analyses from two prospective studies (15808 [CONCUR] and 15983) could provide 
some further insights into the potentially differential activity of regorafenib in patients with wild-
type or mutant KRAS tumours.

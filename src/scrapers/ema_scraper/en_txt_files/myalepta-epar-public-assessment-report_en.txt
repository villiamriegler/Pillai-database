1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Limited submitted on 21 December 2016 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Myalepta, through the 
centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 23 
April 2015. 
Myalepta was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/12/1022 in the following condition: 
Treatment of Familial Partial Lipodystrophy, EU/3/12/1023 in the following condition: Treatment of 
Barraquer-Simons syndrome, EU/3/12/1024 in the following condition: Treatment of Lawrence 
syndrome and EU/3/12/1025 in the following condition: Treatment of Berardinelli-Seip syndrome, all 
on 17 July 2012. 
The orphan designations were transferred from Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Limited to Aegerion 
Pharmaceuticals B.V. during the procedure on 30 November 2017. 
The applicant was changed from Aegerion Pharmaceuticals Limited to Aegerion Pharmaceuticals B.V. 
at the time of submission of response to the Day 180 LoOI. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
MYALEPTA is indicated as an adjunct to diet as a replacement therapy to treat the complications of 
leptin deficiency: 
• 
in patients with congenital or acquired generalised lipodystrophy (LD), in adults and children 2 
years of age and above 
• 
in patients with familial or acquired partial LD, characterised by leptin level < 12 ng/ml with 
triglycerides ≥ 5.65 mmol/l and/or HbA1c ≥ 6.5 %, in adults and children 2 years of age and 
above. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designations of Myalepta as an orphan medicinal product in 
the approved indications. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan 
maintenance assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s 
website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/European public assessment reports.  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that metreleptin was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0314/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 8/136 
 
 
 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0314/2016 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indications. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance metreleptin contained in the above medicinal product 
to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Protocol Assistance

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lipodystrophy (LD) syndromes are clinically heterogeneous inherited or acquired ultra-rare disorders 
characterised by selective but variable loss of adipose tissue, primarily subcutaneous fat (Garg, 
2004 N Engl J Med 350(12): 1220-1234; Chan et.al, 2010, Endocr Pract 16(2): 310-323). The 
disease is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as impaired quality of life. 
The loss of adipose tissue in patients with LD can range from partial to more generalised, and some 
patients have concomitant accumulation of excess adipose tissue centrally. Underlying this loss of 
adipose tissue, are very low levels of the hormone leptin which closely correlate with the amount of 
fat mass present (Considine et.al, 1996, N Engl J Med 334(5): 292-295). 
The lack of normal depots for storage of ingested fats results in hypertriglyceridaemia, which is often 
severe and predisposing patients to serious conditions such as acute pancreatitis, which can be life-
threatening.  Elevated  triglyceride  levels  are  also  a  known  risk  factor  for  cardiovascular  disease.  In 
addition,  deposition  of  fat  occurs  in  ectopic  locations  such  as  liver,  heart,  and  muscle,  leading  to 
extreme insulin resistance and often to diabetes that is difficult to control, even with high doses of 
insulin.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Although data are limited, the available data on prevalence for generalised lipodystrophy (GL; 
combined congenital and acquired) is slightly under 0.01 to <0.15 in 10,000 and the prevalence for 
partial lipodystrophy (PL; combined familial and acquired) is approximately 0.02 to <0.3 in 10,000.  
Despite the limited data in the applied indication for metreleptin in PL which includes only these 
patients with more severe metabolic abnormalities, prevalence of this PL subgroup is likely to be 
<0.03 in 10,000. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Because of the loss of adipose tissue, levels of the adipocyte-secreted hormone leptin in patients 
with LD are very low (Haque et.al, 2002, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 87(5): 2395). Leptin is a naturally 
occurring, adipocyte-derived hormone and an important regulator of energy homoeostasis, fat and 
glucose metabolism, reproductive capacity, and other diverse physiological functions (Friedman 
et.al, 1998, Nature 395(6704):763-70; Zhang et.al, 1994, Nature 372(6505): 425-32.). The leptin 
deficiency observed in patients with LD results in a significant reduction in the ability to regulate 
hunger and energy, as well as glucose and fat metabolism. 
Lipodystrophy syndromes are classified by aetiology, i.e., genetic or acquired, and by distribution of 
adipose  tissue  deficiency,  i.e.,  generalised  (occurring  in  a  diffuse  fashion)  or  partial  (restricted  to 
regional  anatomical  adipose  depots),  leading  to  4  broad  categories:  congenital  generalised 
lipodystrophy  (CGL  also  known  as  Berardinelli-Seip  syndrome),  acquired  generalised  lipodystrophy 
(AGL,  also  known  as  Lawrence  syndrome),  familial  partial  lipodystrophy  (FPL)  and  acquired  partial 
lipodystrophy  (APL  also  known  as  Barraquer-Simons  syndrome)  (Handelsman  et.al,  2013,  Endocr 
Pract 19(1): 107-116).  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 11/136 
 
 
 
While there can be considerable heterogeneity in the degree of morbidity between patients with GL 
versus PL, the types of signs and metabolic abnormalities resulting from the partial to near complete 
loss of subcutaneous fat resulting in leptin deficiency are very similar.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Lipodystrophy is often associated with severe metabolic abnormalities, including 
hypertriglyceridaemia, insulin resistance, and/or diabetes, that can result in life-threatening co-
morbidities such as acute pancreatitis, steatohepatitis, and/or accelerated atherosclerosis and 
mortality (Garg, 2004; Chan, 2010). 
Overall, complications associated with both acquired and congenital/familial forms of GL and PL can 
be quite severe, requiring aggressive treatment and management over the lifetime of the patient. 
The severe metabolic abnormalities associated with GL occur at a young age and may result in 
premature diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, recurrent attacks of acute 
pancreatitis, hepatomegaly, and organ failure (Garg, 2011, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 96(11): 3313-
3325; Handelsman et.al, 2013, Endocr Pract 19(1): 107-116); Lima et.al, 2016, Diabetol Metab 
Syndr 8: 23.).  
Chronic renal disease and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) can occur due to 
longstanding, sub-optimally controlled diabetes. A high incidence of proteinuric nephropathies (e.g., 
MPGN and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [FSG] as well as diabetic nephropathy) has been 
reported in patients with GL (Javor et.al, 2004, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 89(7): 3199-3207). AGL is 
also associated with a higher frequency of MPGN (Garg, 2004, N Engl J Med 350(12): 1220-1234). 
Similarly, cardiovascular complications also occur with increased prevalence and earlier onset in 
patients with FPL (Hegele, 2001, Circulation 103(18): 2225-2229; Garg, 2000, J Clin Endocrinol 
Metab 85(5): 1776-1782).  
Female patients with LD may develop alterations in their neuroendocrine functions resulting in 
hirsutism, enlarged polycystic ovaries, hyperandrogenism, irregular menstrual periods, or 
amenorrhoea (Musso et.al, 2005, Metabolism 54(2): 255-263). Leptin is one of the signals 
controlling sexual maturation, as LD patients have been shown to have delayed puberty and 
hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (Oral et.al, 2002, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 87(7): 3110-3117; 
Mantzoros et. al, 1997, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 82(4): 1066-1070).  
Patients with acquired forms of GL and PL have additional complications, due to the association with 
autoimmune disorders (such as juvenile dermatomyositis as well as systemic lupus erythematosus), 
themselves implicated in part to the development of the disease (Capeau et. al, 2006. Future 
Lipidology 1(5): 593-604). 
Finally, the psychosocial impact of lipodystrophy is another significant comorbid factor: patients 
often experience psychological distress caused by changes in physical appearance from 
lipodystrophy and often resort to corrective measures including plastic surgery, e.g., muscle tissue 
transfer or autologous fat grafts, as well as dermal fillers (Brown et. al, 2016, J Clin Endocrinol 
Metab: jc20162466; Misra et.al, 2003, Medicine [Baltimore] 82(2): 129-146).  
The only true diagnostic determination of the subtype among the 4 categories of LD is an identified 
genetic mutation. Without that, the subtype is determined by age of onset (generally earlier in 
generalised vs partial; generally earlier in congenital/familial vs acquired), patient presentation 
(more evenly distributed fat loss in generalised vs partial), and awareness of concomitant variables 
(predilection to autoimmune diseases in acquired vs congenital/familial).

2.1.5.  Management 
For patients with LD and associated diabetes and/or hypertriglyceridaemia, current available 
therapies include diet modification (low calorie, low fat, and low carbohydrate) and pharmacologic 
intervention with oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, and/or 
lipid-lowering agents.  
Current therapeutic options are thus limited and do not address the underlying cause of the disease, 
i.e., the lack of adipose tissue and resulting leptin deficiency. 
Patients  with  milder  metabolic  abnormalities  may  be  effectively  treated  with  such  therapies  at  the 
start  of  the  disease  process.  However,  the  disease  is  progressive  and  those  with  more  severe 
abnormalities  often  do  not  respond  to  these  treatments  due  to  the  profound  nature  of  their 
underlying  abnormalities,  especially  when  insulin  resistance  is  severe  and/or  triglycerides  are 
significantly elevated. 
About the product 
Metreleptin is a recombinant human leptin analogue. It is a 147 amino acid, polypeptide with one 
disulphide bond between Cys 97 and Cys 147 and differs from native human leptin by the addition of 
a methionine residue at its amino terminus. 
Metreleptin exerts its function by binding to and activating the human leptin receptor (ObR), which 
belongs to the Class I cytokine family of receptors that signals through the JAK/STAT transduction 
pathway. 
Leptin acts via multiple mechanisms to decrease triglyceride and other lipid intermediates in 
lipodystrophy patients, reducing their accumulation in tissues such as liver and muscle, and 
ameliorating severe insulin resistance, thereby improving hyperglycaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia 
(Petersen et.al, 2002, J Clin Invest 109(10): 1345-1350; Javor et.al, 2005, Hepatology 41(4): 753-
760 ; Park et.al, 2007, Metabolism 56(4): 508-516 ; Chong et.al, 2010, Diabetologia 53(1): 27-35; 
Oral et.al, 2002, J Clin Endocrinol Metab 87(7): 3110-3117). Recent research has suggested that 
leptin may also inhibit pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) (Vatier et.al, 2016, 
Diabetes Obes Metab 18(7): 693-7; Levenson et.al,  2016, Endocrinology 157(4): 1421-1429). 
The claimed indication for Myalepta was as replacement therapy adjunctive to diet to treat the 
complications of leptin deficiency: 
• 
• 
in patients with congenital or acquired generalised lipodystrophy (LD), in adults and children 
2 years of age and above; 
in patients with familial or acquired partial LD, characterised by leptin level < 12 ng/ml with 
triglycerides ≥ 5.65 mmol/l and/or HbA1c ≥ 6.5 %, in adults and children 2 years of age and 
above 
The indication approved by CHMP was as replacement therapy adjunctive to diet to treat the 
complications of leptin deficiency in lipodystrophy (LD) patients: 
•  with confirmed congenital generalised LD (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) or acquired 
generalised LD (Lawrence syndrome) in adults and children 2 years of age and above  
•  with confirmed familial partial LD or acquired partial LD (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), in 
adults and children 12 years of age and above for whom standard treatments have failed to 
achieve adequate metabolic control.

The recommended daily dose of metreleptin is based on body weight. The starting daily dose for 
patients weighing under 40 kg is 0.06 mg/kg and a maximum daily dose of 0.13 mg/kg. For male 
patients weighing more than 40 kg, the starting daily dose is 2.5 mg, whilst for female patients over 
40 kg, the starting daily dose is 5 mg. For all patients weighing more than 40 kg, the maximum 
daily dose is 10 mg. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest for all the patients included in the claimed 
indications. The CHMP considered that metreleptin could have a high impact in the treatment of 
patients with generalised lipodystrophy. However, the data submitted in support of partial 
lipodystrophy had significant limitations in defining the patients which could benefit from metreleptin 
treatment in this condition especially in terms of threshold values for HbA1c and/or TG. This is 
further compounded by the fact that conventional therapy with diet, antidiabetics and lipid-lowering 
drugs could potentially be sufficiently effective in at least some of these patients. The potential for 
this product to induce production of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) against both metreleptin and 
endogenous leptin was considered another complicating factor in defining a population with a 
favourable benefit/risk balance.  
• 
Exceptional circumstances 
The Applicant considered that the grounds for marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances apply to Myalepta according to the Article 14 (8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and 
to Part II.6 of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC and provided justification based on the inability to 
provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data due to rarity of indication.  
The prevalence for GL (combined congenital and acquired) is estimated to be between 0.01 to <0.15 
in 10,000 and the prevalence for PL (combined congenital and acquired) is approximately 0.02 to 
<0.3 in 10,000. The applicant considered the true prevalence to be at the low end of the range 
based on available literature and databases.  
At present, there are no medicinal products marketed in the EU for the treatment of generalised or 
partial lipodystrophy.  
Given the proposed indication for metreleptin as treatment for patients with GL and for a subset of 
patients with PL who have more severe metabolic abnormalities, prevalence was also estimated for 
this PL subgroup. Although the data are limited, the prevalence of this PL subgroup would likely be 
<0.03 in 10,000. As a result of these estimates, the sample population available for inclusion in 
clinical trials is extremely limited.  
The applicant also noted that, the extreme rarity of the condition resulted in prolonged recruitment 
for both studies submitted in support of this application.  
Study NIH 991265/20010769 took 14 years to enrol these 107 patients, including patients who 
travelled internationally to participate in the study equating to 0.65 pts/month enrolment rate. 
Study FHA101 took 5 years to enrol 41 patients with 6 sites open this equating to an 0.25 
pts/month enrolment rate.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is presented as is a powder for solution for injection containing 11.3 mg of 
metreleptin as active substance (AS). 
Other ingredients are glycine, sucrose, polysorbate 20, glutamic acid and sodium hydroxide (for pH 
adjustment). 
The product is available in a type I glass vial (5 ml) with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and an 
aluminium seal/plastic flip off cap. The finished product comes in a pack size of 1 vial or 30 vials. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Metreleptin is a recombinant human leptin analogue (i.e. recombinant methionyl human leptin) 
produced in E. coli by recombinant DNA technology. It is 147 amino acids long and has a molecular 
weight of approximately 16 kDa. It is a protein hormone that differs from the human leptin 
sequence by a single additional amino acid, i.e. methionine, located at the N-terminal end. 
Metreleptin has one disulfide bond between Cys-97 and Cys-147. 
Metreleptin exerts its function by binding to and activating the human leptin receptor, which belongs 
to the Class I cytokine family of receptors that signals through the JAK/STAT transduction pathway. 
It acts via multiple mechanisms to decrease triglyceride and other lipid intermediates in 
lipodystrophy patients, reducing their accumulation in tissues such as liver and muscle, and 
ameliorating severe insulin resistance, thereby improving hyperglycaemia and 
hypertriglyceridaemia. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacture and part of the release testing of the metreleptin active substance takes place Sandoz 
GmbH, Biochemiestrasse 10, Kundl, Austria.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The metreleptin AS manufacturing process has the following three sub-processes: 
inoculum/fermentation, isolation, and purification. 
The first sub-process generates cells containing metreleptin that originates from use of a WCB vial 
expanded in flasks and transferred to the main fermenter.  The main fermentation produces the 
majority of the metreleptin containing cells prior to lysing during the second sub-process.  The 
process has been validated to hold material following the second sub-process prior to starting the 
third sub-process of purification.  The third-sub process of purification includes several steps to form 
the disulphide bond, purify the Metreleptin, concentrate, formulate with excipients, sterile filter, and 
fill into a validated container closure system prior to storage.   
A description of the container closure system for the metreleptin AS was provided. The container is 
stated to be in compliance with the Guideline on Plastic Immediate Packaging Materials 
(CPMP/QWP/4359/03) and compatibility of metreleptin with the primary has been demonstrated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 15/136 
 
 
 
Control of materials 
The compendial and non-compendial raw materials used in the manufacturing process are 
sufficiently described and controlled. Animal-derived materials used in the media and feed solutions 
of the AS manufacturing process for metreleptin. These animal-derived materials are in compliance 
with the TSE Note for Guidance. Cells expressing the metreleptin protein were established by 
transformation and subsequent selection. Generation and testing of the expression were described. 
A cell banking system was established and adequately tested and qualified in accordance with the 
requirements of the relevant ICH guidelines. Protocols and acceptance criteria are in place to 
generate future WCBs. Genetic stability is also addressed in end-of-production cells and extended 
generation cells and was sufficiently demonstrated. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process was initially developed. A historic overview of the development has been 
provided and includes details about site transfers, scale changes and overall changes made to the 
manufacturing processes. Clinical batches were produced including data on physicochemical 
attributes, impurity profiles, stability study results and batch analysis. The data show that lots can 
be considered comparable, regardless of the manufacturing site or fermentation scale. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
The production process and process controls are described in detail. Process validation and 
evaluation have been performed for each sub-process taking into account the results from pre-
validation quality risk assessment, which in essence analyses the risk for process failures and 
defines the classification of the process parameters and the in-process controls, based on platform 
and process knowledge and on process characterisation studies taking into account their impact on 
critical quality attributes (CQAs).  
The control strategy is considered sufficiently established based on process characterisation studies. 
The quality of the metreleptin AS is controlled by both in-process controls and release testing.  
Process validation 
The  process  validation  (PV)  batches  were  manufactured  and  this  represents  the  main  process 
validation of the entire manufacturing process. This was followed by supplemental validation studies 
in order to maintain the validated state of the manufacturing process. For the validation assessment 
and  studies  were  performed  in  manufacturing  campaigns  using  process  parameters,  in-process 
controls, and acceptance criteria in place at the time of manufacture.  
The  manufacturing  process  for  metreleptin  active  substance  is  considered  to  be  adequately 
validated.  Consistency  in  production  has  been  shown  on  batches.  All  acceptance  criteria  for  the 
critical  operational  parameters  and  for  the  in  process  controls  are  fulfilled  demonstrating  that  the 
process  consistently  produces  metreleptin  active  substance  of  reproducible  quality  that  complies 
with the predetermined specification and in-process acceptance parameters. 
Chromatographic  Resin  reuse  was  investigated  and  chromatography  resin  reuse  cycles  qualified 
during process validation. 
The  transport  and  shipping  of  metreleptin  AS  occurs  at  and  has  been  fully  validated  in  relation  to 
packaging and shipment procedures. 
Characterisation 
Metreleptin structure has been confirmed through extensive characterisation testing to verify 
physicochemical properties, primary, secondary, tertiary and higher order structure, purity and 
impurities, and biological activity of the metreleptin AS.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 16/136 
 
 
 
The  primary  structure  and  composition  have  been  confirmed  by  a  combination  of  peptide  mapping 
with  liquid  chromatography/mass  spectrometry  (LC/MS)  detection,  amino  acid  sequence  analysis, 
and MS determination of molecular weight. 
The higher order structure was characterised by four different analytical techniques.  
The applicant has established a bioassay to determine the biological activity of metreleptin. The 
metreleptin binds to the target expressed by these cells. The cells proliferate in response to the 
varying amounts of metreleptin and cell proliferation is quantitated by measuring a signal. The 
potency is reported relative to the potency of the Reference Standard.  
The chemical purity of metreleptin is quantitated. This method also quantitates impurities observed 
in the FP, including product-related impurities from the AS and metreleptin degradation products. 
Impurities present are quantitated. Purity and identity are further determined. 
Process- and product-related impurities in the AS are also sufficiently addressed. 
Metreleptin AS has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-of-the-art 
methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure. The analytical results are 
consistent with the proposed structure and characterisation methods are considered adequate.  
Specification 
The following list of specifications is proposed for the commercial metreleptin AS. 
Descriptions of the analytical procedures used for release and stability testing of the AS have been 
presented. In addition, standard operating procedures (SOP) have been provided for all analytical 
procedures appearance by visual inspection, pH, and bacterial endotoxins which are performed 
according to Ph.Eur. requirements. Analytical methods have been adequately validated in line with 
ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. In total results for batches have been 
presented of which the final commercial. The results are within specifications and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference material 
Qualification of reference standards that were used during product development and reference 
standards that will be used during commercial production were described in detail.  
Stability 
A shelf-life is proposed for metreleptin AS, when stored at the recommended condition. 
To support the claimed shelf life several stability studies have been performed as follows: Primary 
stability studies with a number of batches produced at the proposed commercial manufacturing site; 
supporting stability studies with batches manufactured at a fermentation scale; a number of 
commercial AS batches and a study to support the storage and shipment of the AS to the FP 
manufacturing site. 
It has been demonstrated that AS batches are comparable regardless of the fermentation scale or 
manufacturing site, all of the above data has been considered to support the claimed the shelf-life of 
the AS. In conclusion, stability data for the primary stability batches have been provided. The data 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 17/136 
 
 
 
indicate that the AS is stable at the proposed long term storage condition and does not show any 
sign of degradation or loss of potency. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
Comparability studies have been conducted between Phase 2, Phase 3 AS batches and AS batches 
proposed for commercial use. The approach presented by the applicant is considered in line with ICH 
Q5E guideline. The data demonstrate that pilot scale lots, clinical lots and process 
validation/commercial lots can be considered comparable, regardless of the manufacturing site or 
fermentation scale. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Myalepta FP is a sterile, white, solid lyophilised cake containing 11.3 mg metreleptin AS in a 5 mL 
Type I glass vial. Myalepta contains the following excipients Glycine, Sucrose, Polysorbate 20, L-
glutamic acid and Sodium hydroxide (pH adjustment). The quantitative composition of Myalepta 
finished product has been presented. 
Prior to administration via subcutaneous injection, the powder is reconstituted with 2.2 mL of water 
for injections (WFI) to obtain a final formulation of 5 mg/mL metreleptin. The resulting solution is for 
single use only. No overage is included in the formulation of Myalepta. 
The compendial grade excipients are added during the purification process of AS production and no 
additional excipients are used in the formulation of the FP. Sufficient information has been provided 
for the description and composition of the FP. 
The FP is stored in Type I glass vial (5 ml) with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium 
seal/plastic flip off cap. The product comes in pack sizes of 1 or 30 vials. The patient will receive a 
carton containing 1 or 30 vials of Myalepta, depending on the pack size, which should be stored in a 
refrigerator until the day of use. The patient will also receive separately the solvent for 
reconstitution (i.e. water for injection), the syringes/needles for reconstitution, the syringes/needles 
for administration, the cleansing alcohol swabs, and a sharps disposal container.  
During the procedure a major objection was raised on the general composition of the product: 
Myalepta is a powder for solution for injection and proposed to be commercialised without its solvent 
for reconstitution (i.e. water for injections) and without the syringes to be used for both 
reconstituting the FP and administering the correct dose. As Myalepta is intended to be administered 
by the patient himself or by the caregiver the CHMP considered that there could be a risk that the 
absence of these two components (i.e. solvent for reconstitution and appropriate syringes) can lead 
to medication errors. The applicant was asked to reconsider its product composition and to include 
an appropriate presentation of the solvent for reconstitution and appropriate syringes for 
reconstitution and administration with each presentation of lyophilised FU. It was further requested 
that the appropriateness of the provided components should be demonstrated in particular regarding 
the administration of the lowest possible recommended dose (i.e. increment dose of 0.004 mL/kg for 
children of 2 years of age). The applicant was also encouraged to develop a suitable and user-
friendly administration device and, in relation to this, to reconsider the dosage form of the FP if 
needed. 
In the responses the applicant proposed an alternative arrangement to minimise the risk of 
medication errors and to address the concerns related to the feasibility and accuracy of the lowest 
Assessment report

Page 18/136 
 
 
 
dose to be administered. These measures comprise: 1) provision of separate reconstitution and 
administration kits; 2) provision of the solvent for reconstitution (i.e. WFI) by the pharmacist; 3) 
detailed information relating to appropriate syringe size use, use of solvent and instructions on how 
to reconstitute and administer the correct dose in the SmPC/PIL/instructions for use (IFU); and 4) 
educational and training materials related to appropriate syringe size use, preparation and dosing as 
part of the risk management plan (RMP). The educational and training materials also include online 
video media showing all the steps to preparing and administering Myalepta. 
On the basis of the information the CHMP concluded that the measures implemented are adequate 
to mitigate the risk of medication errors. The pharmaceutical development of the finished product 
was further considered correctly addressed as it discussed the relevant aspects of the product and 
process development, and highlighted the critical quality attributes and process parameters. The 
safety of the container closure system has been appropriately demonstrated by compliance with 
compendial standards and an appropriate leachable study. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture and primary packaging of Myalepta takes place at the manufacturing site. The batch 
size has been provided.  
The FP manufacturing process involves thawing, dilution of bulk and filling. 
The successive steps of the manufacturing process are detailed and illustrated by flow charts.  
The  main  steps  have  been  provided  along  with  the  associated  in-process  controls  (IPCs)  and 
operating parameters. 
After manufacturing, the vials are shipped from for secondary packaging. The vials are stored 
between 2-8 °C. 
The primary packaging of Myalepta consists of a 5 mL glass vial with lyophilisation stopper made of 
bromobutyl rubber and aluminium seal with plastic flip-off cap. The suppliers for all components are 
indicated and the glass vial and lyophilisation stopper meet Ph. Eur. requirements. A description of 
their attributes (i.e. colour, dimensions, material), a representative drawing and a CoA from the 
supplier have been presented. 
The manufacturing process is adequately described and the critical steps and parameters to be 
controlled in-process are identified. The FP manufacturing process validation was performed on 
consecutive validation batches of Myalepta. The process validation is deemed appropriate to 
demonstrate that the commercial process size can perform effectively and reproducibly to obtain a 
Myalepta finished product that meets its predefined specifications and quality attributes.  
Results from in-process control tests which were requested during the reviewing process, were 
provided by the applicant.  
Quality of the FP is controlled by both in-process controls and release testing. Analytical methods 
were described in detail and were properly validated. QC testing site has been demonstrated. 
Product specification 
The release specifications of Myalepta finished product have been provided. 
Control of the FP covers the main quality attributes and compendial requirements for parenteral 
preparations. Stated impurities have been studied in nonclinical and clinical studies as relevant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 19/136 
 
 
 
 
Justifications have been provided for setting the FP acceptance criteria for the different quality 
attributes and are based on batches issued from studies, studies and studies. The proposed limits 
are considered acceptable and in accordance with the ICH Q6B guideline.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately descried and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis results have been provided for batches manufactured to date and used in clinical and 
non-clinical studies, and for commercial use. The results from all commercial scale batches comply 
with the proposed commercial acceptance criteria. 
Reference materials 
A reference standard was developed for Myalepta finished product. It is stored frozen. From this a 
working reference standard is being introduced. The current working standard is stored under the 
same conditions as the FP (5 ± 3 °C) in. The qualification of standards is deemed appropriate for 
their intended use. 
Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 3 years is proposed by the applicant. The FP should be stored in a refrigerator (2°C–
8°C) and the vial kept in the outer carton in order to protect from light. Following reconstitution with 
water  for  injections,  the  medicinal  product  must  be  used  immediately  and  cannot  be  stored  for 
future use.  
FP  stability  studies  have  been  conducted  to  support  the  shelf-life  of  3  years  for  the  Myalepta  FP. 
Based  on  the  stability  data  presented,  a  shelf-life  of  3  years  is  considered  acceptable  for  the  FP, 
when stored at the recommended condition of 2 to 8°C, protected from light. 
Adventitious agents 
The raw materials from animal origin used in the AS manufacturing process are in compliance with 
the TSE Note for Guidance. Appropriate measures are taken to prevent microbial contamination in 
the AS and FP manufacturing processes.  
Post Approval Change Management Protocol 
As part of the MAA, the applicant submitted a Post Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP). 
The subject of this PACMP is the introduction post-MAA approval of 2 new product presentations of 
the FP (i.e. nominal 5 mg and 2.5 mg) in addition to the currently provided nominal 10 mg 
presentation. The main difference between the current and proposed presentations is a different per 
vial, whereas the formulation and general manufacturing process remain the same. Following 
reconstitution of the 2.5 mg or 5 mg presentation, the solution will have the same as described for 
the 10 mg presentation. The PACMP is proposed mainly to facilitate use of the product in paediatric 
patients and to the product following reconstitution, as it is for single use only. A detailed description 
of the protocol is provided and is generally acceptable and in line with the Q and A on PACMPs 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/586330/2010).  
Since concerns were raised during the procedure relating to the general composition of the FP in the 
10  mg  presentation,  these  would  also  be  applicable  to  the  additional  2.5  mg  and  5  mg 
presentations.  Therefore,  as  a  minimum,  measures  that  were  implemented  for  the  10  mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 20/136 
 
 
 
presentation  should  also  be  applied  to  the  new  proposed  presentations.  This  is  even  more  critical 
when  considering  the  very  small  injection  volumes  to  be  administered  to  paediatric  patients,  since 
these  new  presentations  are  developed  to  facilitate  dosing  of  paediatric  patients.  The  applicant 
states  that  the  2  additional  presentations  will  also  be  supplied  with  administration  sets  and 
instructions.  The  introduction  of  vials  containing  2.5  mg  and  5  mg  of  metreleptin  -  via  a  variation 
procedure  following  granting  of  the  MA  -  addresses  one  of  Myalepta’s  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan 
(PIP) commitments to facilitate dosing to paediatric patients.

Not applicable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The AS and FP manufacturing process and process controls are described in detail. Raw materials 
are sufficiently described and controlled. A system was established and properly tested and 
qualified. Critical process parameters were identified, including the applicant’s rationale for selection 
of the parameters as critical or non-critical and their associated characterisation or acceptable 
ranges. The control strategy is considered sufficiently established based on process characterisation 
studies and quality risk assessments, and taking into account the impact on CQAs such as protein 
concentration, purity, host cell proteins (HCP), and content. Upon request, the applicant has 
satisfactorily addressed some important issues as regards the manufacturing process validation, and 
classification of process parameters. Other validation studies regarding hold time of process 
intermediates, impurity clearance, column lifetimes, membrane reuse and sanitisation, additional 
microbiological controls, and shipping qualification are also performed. For some of these studies, 
additional information originally requested has been further presented. 
The AS and FP specifications proposed by the applicant are deemed suitable to control the quality of 
AS and FP. The proposed acceptance criteria for some AS quality attributes needed further 
explanation and/or justification, i.e. the proposed acceptance criteria related to total oligomer 
content, purity and specified impurities and host cell proteins. However, these concerns have been 
sufficiently addressed and for some quality attributes, tightened acceptance criteria were proposed. 
Stability for AS and FP have been investigated with a number of batches. Since comparability 
between these batches has been demonstrated, the overall long term stability data obtained support 
the proposed shelf-life of 3 years for the FP. 
Besides the other concerns, a major objection was originally identified concerning the general 
composition of the product. Myalepta is a powder for solution for injection that is proposed to be 
commercialised without its solvent for reconstitution (i.e. WFI) and without the syringes to be used 
for both reconstituting the finished product and administering the correct dose. Myalepta is intended 
to be administered by the patient himself or by the care giver. A substantial risk that the absence of 
these two components (i.e. solvent for reconstitution and appropriate syringes) can lead to 
medication errors was identified. In line with the principles outlined in the Good practice guide on 
risk minimisation and prevention of medication errors (EMA/606103/2014), the applicant was thus 
asked to revise its product composition and to include an appropriate presentation of the solvent for 
reconstitution and appropriate syringes for reconstitution and administration with each presentation 
of lyophilised finished product. The appropriateness of the provided components should be 
demonstrated in the relevant sections of the dossier, e.g. the fact that the administration of the 
lowest possible recommended dose (i.e. increment dose of 0.004 mL/kg for children of 2 years of 
age) is feasible and accurate using the provided syringes. In particular, syringes allowing dosing of 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 21/136 
 
 
 
volumes smaller than 0.1 mL are not commonly available. Thus, it was requested that the solvent 
for reconstitution and syringes should either be supplied with the product. 
In his response to the major objection raised, the applicant did not include an appropriate 
presentation of the solvent for reconstitution and appropriate syringes for reconstitution and 
administration with each presentation of lyophilised Myalepta finished product. Instead the applicant 
proposed an alternative arrangement to minimise the risk of medication errors and to address the 
concerns related to the feasibility and accuracy of the lowest dose to be administered. In summary, 
these measures comprise: 1) provision of separate reconstitution and administration kits; 2) 
provision of the solvent for reconstitution (i.e. WFI) by the pharmacist; 3) detailed information 
relating to appropriate syringe size use, use of solvent and instructions on how to reconstitute and 
administer the correct dose in the SmPC/PIL/IFU; and 4) educational and training materials related 
to appropriate syringe size use, preparation and dosing as part of the RMP. The measures currently 
proposed by the applicant are deemed suitable for mitigating the risk of medical errors. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Metreleptin is a recombinant human leptin analogue produced in Escherichia coli cells to express 
recombinant methionyl-human leptin (r-metHuLeptin). It differs from native human leptin by the 
addition of a methionine residue at its amino terminus. Native human leptin is produced in, and 
secreted primarily from, the adipocytes of white adipose tissue.  
Nonclinical safety studies on metreleptin were designed to be consistent with relevant EU guidelines, 
in particular ICH Guideline S6(R1): Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived 
Pharmaceuticals, Addendum, 12Jun2011. All pivotal nonclinical safety studies were compliant with 
the then-current Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary PD studies with human metreleptin and/or murine metreleptin were conducted in vitro and 
in vivo using leptin-deficient, euleptinemic and hyperleptinemic animals, and in 
dyslipidemic/atherosclerotic models.

In vitro 
The potency of metreleptin and recombinant human leptin was investigated in study REC-00111, 
using the 32D OBECA cell line which was engineered to contain the human leptin receptor. 
Metreleptin and human leptin had comparable dose-dependent responses in activating the human 
leptin receptor and subsequent STAT5 phosphorylation. Additionally, metreleptin and recombinant 
human leptin demonstrated effectively identical stimulation of ATP production by the two molecules 
in 32D OBECA and equivalent sensitivity to an interfering antibody (data not shown). Results from 
this study indicated that metreleptin is biologically equivalent to recombinant human leptin. 
In vivo 
A summary of the primary PD studies conducted in various disease models are summarised in  
Table 1. 
The models used included ob/ob which are leptin deficient mice, mice deficient for apolipoprotein E 
(APOE)  and  apolipoprotein  B48  (APOB48)  [Apoe–/–  Apob100/100ob–/–].  In  addition,  the 
combination  of  leptin  deficiency,  altered  lipoprotein  secretion  and  absence  of  the  low  density 
lipoprotein  receptor  (LDLR)  was  studied  in  mice  having  a  simultaneous  knockout  of  the  genes  for 
leptin, ApoB48, and LDLR [Ldlr–/–Apob100/100 ob–/–].

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In study REST070340-R2005088, the effect of metreleptin on wound healing was investigated. 
Wounds were made on the dorsal surface of female ob/ob and db/db mice. db/db mice have the 
same phenotype as ob/ob mice but lack a functional leptin receptor. A significant decrease in wound 
size was observed in metreleptin-treated ob/ob mice compared to controls. No decrease was 
observed in db/db.  
Metabolic and behavioural effects of metreleptin on Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated in study 
REST070336-R2005084. At doses that induce significant suppression of appetite, mazindol, 
fenfluramine, and amphetamine, all elicited substantial increases in locomotor activity as expected. 
In contrast, murine metreleptin, when administered at high doses by either the i.p. (1 to 30 mg/kg) 
or i.c.v. routes (1 to 10 µg/day continuous infusion for 3 days) did not elicit any change in the 
ambulatory activity of the rats. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The potential adverse effects of metreleptin on different physiological systems were evaluated in a 
GLP-compliant battery of safety pharmacology studies, and are summarised in Table 5.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic interaction studies were submitted, but the applicant acknowledged the 
established risk of hypoglycemia in patients treated with metreleptin who are on high doses of 
insulin or insulin secretagogues. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  of  metreleptin  has  been  assessed  in  mice,  dogs,  and  sheep.  The 
studies  in  mice  included  normal,  bilaterally  nephrectomised,  and  pregnant  animals,  and  examined 
the  PK  profiles  of  metreleptin  following  s.c.  or  intravenous  (i.v.)  administration.  The  PK  profile  of 
metreleptin was evaluated in dogs following s.c. and i.v.  administration and in sheep following s.c. 
or i.v. injection. Toxicokinetic (TK) analyses were also conducted in GLP toxicity studies in mice and 
dogs.

Sheep  
The  PK  profile  of  recombinant  human  metreleptin  was  also  characterised  in  Merino  wethers  sheep 
following  a  single  i.v.  (0.10  mg/kg)  or  s.c.  (0.15  mg/kg)  dose  (Study  REST070284-101535). 
Following  i.v.  administration,  serum  concentrations  of  metreleptin  declined  in  a  biphasic  manner 
with a terminal t 1/2 of approximately 1.5 hours. Metreleptin did not appear to extensively distribute 
outside serum, with a Vss of 83.4 mL/kg. Following s.c. administration, the observed maximal serum 
levels  of  115  ng/mL  occurred  at  0.875  hours  post-dose.  Bioavailability  of  metreleptin  in  sheep 
following s.c. administration averaged 59%.

Distribution 
Volume of distribution at steady state averaged 179 mL/kg in dog and 154 mL/kg in mouse, which 
were approximately 3-4 and 3 times the plasma volume in the dog (Study REST070292-P792) and 
mouse (Study REST070295-OBH.036), respectively, in the single-dose PK study, suggesting that 
metreleptin distributes to extravascular sites. 
The potential placental transfer of recombinant human metreleptin was evaluated in the mouse 
following single and repeated s.c. administration (Study REST070296-987087). The PK of 
metreleptin was determined following s.c. administration of 10 mg/kg to Group 1 (single-dose, 
gestation day [GD] 17), Group 2 (repeated-dose, GD 11-17) and Group 3 (single-dose, non-
pregnant). 
The results of this study showed that the AUC exposure of pregnant mice was approximately 2 to 3 
times greater than those observed in non-pregnant mice after 10 mg/kg s.c. administration of 
metreleptin. A 4 to 5-fold increase in the t 1/2 values were also observed in pregnant mice compared 
to non-pregnant mice. 
The Cmax values in foetal serum and amniotic fluid represented approximately 0.3 to 0.5%, and 0.2 
to  0.4%,  of  the  highest  concentrations  observed  in  the  maternal  serum  for  both  Groups  1  and  2, 
respectively. The AUC values observed in foetal serum and amniotic fluid represented approximately 
0.3  to  0.4%,  and  0.9  to  1.3%,  of  those  observed  in  maternal  serum  for  both  Groups  1  and  2, 
respectively.  
Metabolism 
No  formal  metabolism  studies  with  metreleptin  were  submitted,  as  the  product  is  a  recombinant 
analogue of native human leptin. 
Excretion 
A study was conducted to investigate the role of the kidneys in the systemic clearance of 
recombinant metreleptin (Study REST070294-OBH.660). An i.v. dose of 10 mg/kg was administered 
to three groups of male CD-1 mice. Group 1 consisted of control animals which received no surgical 
manipulation and no anaesthesia, Group 2 included animals which received a sham-operation, and 
in Group 3, the animals were bilaterally nephrectomised. Following the i.v. dose, serum 
concentrations of metreleptin were substantially higher in nephrectomised mice at all time points, 
compared to control and sham-operated animals. The clearance of metreleptin in Group 3 
approximated only 3% of the clearance values in Groups 1 and 2, suggesting that the kidneys were 
responsible for the majority (>95%) of systemic clearance of metreleptin in mice. There was also a 
concurrent decrease in the Vss in the nephrectomised animals, suggesting that the kidneys also 
served as a distribution site for metreleptin. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No PK interaction studies were submitted, but the applicant recognised the potential of metreleptin 
to alter the formation of cytochrome P450.

Other pharmacokinetic studies 
Anti-Drug Antibodies  
Serum samples (Days 1, 7, 14, 28, 84, and 168, as well as 1 month recovery) were collected during 
the  course  of  the  6-month  chronic  dog  toxicity  study  for  the  quantitation  of  metreleptin  (Study 
REST070248-WIL120039). Metreleptin levels appeared to increase upon multiple doses beyond Day 
7; however, TK analysis was performed only on samples up to Day 28. Metreleptin levels could not 
be  determined  after  Day  14  due  to  interference  of  the  assay  by  the  presence  of  antibodies.  The 
presence  of  the  antibodies  after  repeated-dose  administration  was  further  evaluated  in  the  chronic 
dog study, using samples from the 1-month recovery period. Overall, the results indicated that the 
anti-metreleptin  antibodies  did  not  have  a  neutralising  effect  on  the  drug  (Study  REC-00123). 
Further  evidence  suggesting  that  the  anti-metreleptin  antibodies  were  not  neutralising  was  the 
pronounced  PD  effects  (e.g.,  body  weight  loss,  and  microscopic  findings  of  reduced  adipose) 
recorded in the mouse and dog chronic repeated-dose toxicity studies (studies REST070254-54802 
and REST070248-WIL120039, respectively). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were submitted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
A number of repeat dose toxicity studies were submitted, including 4 studies in mice, 1 in rats, 5 in 
dogs and 1 in Rhesus monkeys.  
The  applicant  selected,  mice  and  dogs,  as  the  respective  rodent  and  non-rodent  species  for  the 
metreleptin toxicity program, because the metreleptin pharmacological data indicated that both mice 
and  dogs  are  biologically  responsive  to  the  effects  of  metreleptin.  In  addition,  the  sequence 
homology  of  leptin  in  different  animal  species  is  fairly  well  preserved  with  84.9%,  83.6%,  83.6%, 
82.2%,  and  91.1%  sequence  homology  in  mice,  rats,  rabbits,  Beagle  dogs,  and  Rhesus  monkeys, 
respectively,  as  compared  to  humans.  Finally,  results  from  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicokinetic  (TK) 
studies in mice and dogs showed that both species have adequate exposure to metreleptin following 
s.c. injection.  
The pivotal studies were the 3/6-month study in Swiss mice and the 1/3/6-month study in Beagle 
dogs. A summary of the non-pivotal studies, is presented in Table 10.

Several mortalities at 100 
mg/kg/day were associated, 
in part, with overnight food 
and water deprivation and 
the severe health status 
brought on by the PD 
activity of metreleptin. 
There was also one 
mortality in each of the 
control and 10 mg/kg/day 
groups.  
At ≥ 1 mg/kg/day: BW loss, 
reduced BW gain, and 
reduced FC, alterations in 
several clinical chemistry 
parameters, and fat 
atrophy; all considered to 
be exaggerated PD effects.  
At 10 and 100 mg/kg/day: 
decreased spleen and 
thymus weight (with 
associated histopathology) 
and other microscopic 
changes in the stomach and 
pancreas, were considered 
related to stress. In the 
liver, centrilobular 
hepatocellular degeneration 
may have been due to 
hypoxia.  
At 1 mg/kg/day: PD-related 
effects were minimal, with 
no signs of toxicity.  
Target tissues showed no 
potential for metreleptin-
related cell proliferation.  
At 100 mg/kg/day: marked 
effects, including mortalities 
(three males and two 
females) and slight changes 
in liver enzymes.

Study  REST070254-54802;  GLP:  A  3/6  Month  Subcutaneous  Toxicity  Study  of  Recombinant-
Methionyl Human Leptin (r-metHuLeptin) in Mice Followed by a 28-Day Recovery Period  
The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential toxic effects of metreleptin in Swiss albino 
mice following daily s.c. injection for 3/6 months, and following a recovery period of 28 days. Mice 
were treated with 0-30 mg/kg doses of metreleptin. 
Mortality:  prior  to  the  3-month  terminal  sacrifice,  four  animals  at  30  mg/kg/day,  two  at  10 
mg/kg/day,  and  four  at  3  mg/kg/day  died  during  the  treatment  period.  One  of  the  animals  at  30 
mg/kg/day died on Day 33, and the remaining animals died on Day 91, following the overnight food 
and  water  deprivation  prior  to  scheduled  necropsy.  There  were  no  clinical  signs  observed  for  one 
animal  dosed  at  30  mg/kg/day  prior  to  its  recorded  death  on  Day  33.  Of  the  nine  animals  which 
were found dead on Day 91, six exhibited pallor, decreased activity, and were cold to touch prior to 
death;  the  remaining  three  animals  were  found  dead  prior  to  the  Day  91  clinical  examination  and 
had not exhibited any adverse signs on the previous day. 
Between  Days  91  and  the  end  of  the  6-month  and  recovery  periods,  several  animals  of  various 
groups were found dead or were sacrificed in moribund condition. There were no treatment-related 
clinical observations and the applicant considered that none of the deaths were clearly attributed to 
treatment

Anti-drug  antibodies:  radioimmunoassay  analysis  of  serum  samples  indicated the  presence  of  anti-
metreleptin  antibodies.  At  3  months,  significant  numbers  of  animals  in  the  dose  range  of  0.3  to  3 
mg/kg/day  had  seroconverted,  and this  number  appeared to  increase  after  6 months  of  dosing.  At 
dose  levels  of  10  and  30  mg/kg/day,  all  animals  had  seroconverted,  regardless  of  the  duration  of 
dosing, or after recovery. 
Histopathology:  microscopically,  treatment-related  changes  were  found  in  the  liver,  fat,  lymphoid 
organs, stomach, pancreas, and possibly in the injection sites at the end of the 3-month treatment 
period..  These  observations  in  the liver  were  not observed  in  the  animals treated  for  6  months.  At 
the  end  of  the  3-  and  6-month  treatment  periods,  atrophy  of  mesenteric  and/or  perirenal  fat 
occurred  with  a  markedly  increased  incidence  and  severity  in  the  metreleptin-treated  groups  as 
compared to the controls, with a trend towards being more severe at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day.  
The NOAEL in this study was determined to be 1 mg/kg/day.

Subcutaneously  Administered  Recombinant  Methionyl  Human  Leptin  (r-metHuLeptin)  in  Beagle 
Dogs. 
The  objective  of  study  REST070248-WIL120039  was  to  evaluate  the  potential  toxic  effects  of 
metreleptin in Beagle dogs following daily s.c. injection for 1-, 3-, and 6-month treatment periods, 
followed  by  1-,  4-,  and  1-month  recovery  periods,  respectively.  Animals  were  exposed  to  doses 
between 0-5 mg/kg/day. 
Mortality: one male in the 1.5 mg/kg group was euthanized pre-terminally during Week 8 following a 
marked  body  weight  loss  (greater  than  that  observed  for  the  high  dose  group  males  for  the  same 
period).  During  Week  6,  one  female  in  the  0.5  mg/kg/day  group  was  euthanized  in  moribund 
condition following a marked body weight loss (greater than that observed for the high dose group 
females for the same period). 
Body  weight:  Changes  from  baseline  in  the  percentage  of  bodyweight  during  the  study  are 
summarised in Table 13.

Anti-drug  antibody:  after  6  months  of  dosing,  an  apparent  36%  seroconversion  was  observed  in 
controls, considered to be possibly indicative of misdosing, and this was still largely present after the 
1-month recovery phase following the 6-month treatment period (33%). There was a 36% to 100% 
seroconversion response for the dose groups that received 6 months of dosing. The 5 mg/kg group 
that was given 3 months of recovery showed only a 25% seroconversion, and no immunoreactivity 
was detected after 4 months of recovery.  
Histopathology:  In  the  first  month  of  treatment,  microscopic  changes  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract, 
acute  haemorrhage  in  the  urinary  bladder  (observed  in  two  males  and  one  female  and  graded  as 
mild to severe), lymphoid hyperplasia of the lymph nodes, follicular cell hypertrophy of the thyroid 
gland  for  a  limited  number  of  animals,  and  perivasculitis,  which  affected  vessels  mainly  in  the 
adipose tissue, injection sites, liver, lungs, and heart; perivasculitis also observed in the 0.05, 0.15 
and 0.5 mg/kg groups, but limited to adipose tissue in single animals from the 0.05 and 0.15 mg/kg 
groups, and to the urinary bladder of a single animal in the 0.5 mg/kg group. By the end of the 4-
week recovery period, perivasculities was not observed in any of the recovery groups (0.5, 1.5, and 
5 mg/kg groups). 
At  the  Week  12  interim  necropsy,  perivasculitis  was  limited  to  the  injection  site  in  all  groups, 
including  the  control  group.  Even  though  the  incidence  and  severity  grades  were  greater  in  the 
treated  groups  than  in  the  control  group,  no  dose-relationship  was  apparent  with  the  exception  of 
somewhat  higher  severity  grades  in  the  5  mg/kg/day  group  females.  For  the  5  mg/kg/day  group 
placed  on  the  second  recovery  phase  (Weeks  12  to  13  through  27  to  28),  perivasculitis  was  not 
present in the 5 mg/kg/day group at the Week 28 necropsies.

At the Week 24 end of dosing necropsy, perivasculitis was limited to the injection site in all groups, 
including the control group. Severity grades were greater in the treated groups. For the 0.5 and 1.5 
mg/kg/day  groups  placed  on  the  third  recovery  phase,  perivasculitis  at  the  injection  site  was  seen 
similarly in the control and treated groups

On Day 14, the serum concentration profiles of two animals were not reported because the results 
from the immunoassay altered with changes in the dilution factors. The serum concentration data on 
Day 28 were also not determined because the immunoassay was affected by antibody formation in 
all metreleptin-treated animals.

N/A 
In two non-GLP 14-day studies (studies REST070270-PK96001 and REST070269-P810) in male or 
female rats using s.c. administration at 5 mg/kg/day, metreleptin was associated with injection-site 
reactions, the severity (in terms of granulomatous reactions and small crystalloid precipitates) of 
which was concentration-related. A concentration of 50 mg/mL produced a noticeable reaction 
(partially reversible) whereas only mild reactions were observed at 5 and 20 mg/mL (which were 
completely reversible). 
In  a  GLP-compliant  single-dose  study  (study  REST070162-CHW6271-125),  metreleptin  (20  mg/mL 
[1  mL/site],  5  mg/mL  [4  mL/site])  was  administered  s.c.  to  male  and  female  rabbits  (NZW;  20 
mg/mL  group,  [n  =  3/sex];  5  mg/mL  group,  [4  males  and  2  females]).  The  injection  site  was 
observed  for  up  to  14  days  and  histopathological  evaluations  were  performed  on  Days  3  and  14 
(n=3/day/dose).  At  20  mg/mL,  moderate  hemorrhage  at  the  injection  site  and  chronic  active

inflammation were observed in 1 rabbit on Day 3, but no metreleptin-related changes were observed 
in other rabbits in the same group and in the 5 mg/mL group.  
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Antigenicity  was  evaluated  at  metreleptin  concentrations  of  2.5  and  5  mg/mL  in  two  tests:  active 
systemic  anaphylaxis  (ASA)  and  a  passive  cutaneous  anaphylaxis  (PCA)  using  male  guinea  pigs 
(Dunkin-Hartley;  n  =  5  per  group)  (Study  REST070263-CHW6271-123).  In  the  ASA  test,  s.c. 
mass/necrosis associated with local inflammatory response was noted at the injection site in animals 
receiving  Freund’s  Complete  Adjuvant  (FCA).  Severe  anaphylaxis  occurred  in  all  bovine  serum 
albumin  (BSA)-  and  metreleptin  2.5  and  5  mg/mL-sensitised  groups.  In  the  PCA  test,  the  most 
severe effects occurred in animals treated with BSA and a dose-dependent reaction was observed in 
the metreleptin groups, augmented by concomitant FCA treatment. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment studies were submitted as metreleptin is a protein and therefore 
unlikely to pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Leptin  acts  via  binding  to  a  cell-surface  leptin  receptor  which  is  a  member  of  the  class  I  cytokine 
receptor family, also known as the gp130 receptor family. Metreleptin binding to a chimera Lepr/EPO 
receptor was measured using a competition binding assay with 125I-leptin (mouse), and IC50 values 
in the range of 0.1-0.3 x 10-9 M were recorded. These values are comparable to those published on 
leptin affinity for its cognate receptor. The bioactivity of human metreleptin has also been shown to 
be  equivalent  to  human  leptin  in  vitro  using  32D  OBECA  cells  engineered  to  contain  the  human 
leptin receptor and utilising the OB-R/EPO-R signalling pathway. Even though, distribution including 
protein  binding  is  likely  to  be  comparable  between  leptin  and  metreleptin,  it  is  recommended  that 
the  applicant  conduct  further  studies  to  confirm binding  of  metreleptin to  proteins in  serum  and  to 
characterise the tissue distribution of metreleptin.  
Primary PD studies in leptin deficient mice (ob/ob), and rodent models (e.g., genetic, diet and drug-
induced)  of  lipodystrophy  demonstrated  that  ameliorating  leptin  deficiency  by  pharmacological 
administration  of  metreleptin  alleviates  many  of  the  metabolic  dysregulations  associated  with  the 
lipodystrophic  state.  Normal,  euleptinemic  animals  responded  to  exogenous  metreleptin  to  a lesser 
degree,  and  hyper-leptinemic,  obese  animals  exhibited  an  even  lesser  response  to  peripherally 
administered metreleptin.  
A  battery  of  safety  pharmacology  studies  was  performed  with  metreleptin,  and  results  indicated 
minimal risk for the CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and gastrointestinal systems of patients. 
No PD drug interaction studies were submitted. However, due to decreased insulin resistance which 
was  seen  in  many  of  the  non-clinical  PD  studies,  there  is  an  increased  risk  of  hypoglycaemia  in 
patients  treated  with  metreleptin  who  are  on  high  doses  of  insulin  or  insulin  secretagogues  (e.g., 
sulfonylureas).  A  warning  is  therefore  included  in  the  product  information  on  the  need  to  closely 
monitor  blood  glucose  in  such  patients  and  if  necessary  to  reduce  the  dose  by  50%  or  more  of 
baseline insulin in the first 2 weeks of treatment.

The  models  used  to  characterise  the  PK  profile  of  metreleptin  (mice,  dogs,  and  sheep)  were 
considered  acceptable.  The  models  used  of  The  studies  in  mice  included  normal,  bilaterally 
nephrectomised, and pregnant animals, and examined the PK profiles of metreleptin following s.c. or 
intravenous (i.v.) administration. The PK profile of metreleptin was evaluated in dogs following s.c. 
and  i.v.  administration  and  in  sheep  following  s.c.  or  i.v.  injection.  Limited  toxicokinetic  (TK) 
analyses were also conducted in GLP toxicity studies in mice and dogs.  
In mouse PK studies, the bioavailability of subcutaneously administered metreleptin was determined 
to  be  approximately  82%.  Following  s.c.  dosing,  Tmax  in  mice  ranged  from  approximately  10 to 30 
min., whereas Tmax ranged from approximately 3 to 4 hours in dogs. In both mice and dogs, there 
was  no  gender-related  difference  in  the  PK  of  metreleptin.  Also  in  both  species,  metreleptin 
exposure  tended  to  increase  over  time  following  repeated  s.c.  dosing.  At  the  same  time,  serum 
reactivity ratio, indicative of an antibody-response against metreleptin, increased after repeated s.c. 
administration. The time-course of antibody formation appeared to coincide with increased exposure 
– presumably related to decreased renal filtration of the antibody complex. 
Volume of distribution at steady state averaged were approximately 3-4 and 3 times the plasma 
volume in the dog and mouse, respectively, in the single-dose PK study, suggesting that metreleptin 
distributes to extravascular sites. AUC exposure of pregnant mice was approximately 2 to 3 times 
greater than those observed in non-pregnant mice after 10 mg/kg s.c. administration of metreleptin. 
A 4 to 5-fold increase in the t 1/2 values were also observed in pregnant mice compared to non-
pregnant mice. The higher metreleptin exposure and longer t 1/2 observed in the pregnant animals 
may be related to a reduced elimination capacity by binding to soluble leptin receptor found at 
higher levels in pregnant mice. 
While  metreleptin  reached  the  foetal  serum  and  amniotic  fluid  through  placental  transfer,  the 
exposure of the foetus to metreleptin was minimal (less than 1%). 
No formal metabolism studies have been conducted with metreleptin, and were not considered to be 
necessary  since  metreleptin  is  a  recombinant  analogue  of  native  human  leptin,  differing  from  the 
native molecule by a single methionyl group at the N-terminus end. 
The  majority  (>95%)  of  systemic  clearance  of  metreleptin  in  mice  occurs  through  the  kidneys. 
There  was  also  a  decrease  in  the  Vss  in  the  nephrectomised  animals,  suggesting  that  the  kidneys 
also  serve  as  a  distribution  site  for  metreleptin.  It  is  possible  therefore  that  the  pharmacokinetics 
may be altered in subjects with renal impairment. 
No  formal  non-clinical  PK interaction  studies  were  performed.  It  is  known  however,  that  leptin  is a 
cytokine with the potential to alter the formation of cytochrome P450. Therefore, a recommendation 
in the product information, that when starting or stopping therapy with metreleptin, patients taking 
medicinal  products  which are  individually  adjusted  and  metabolised  via  CYP450  (e.g.,  theophylline, 
warfarin,  phenprocoumon,  phenytoin,  ciclosporin)  should  be  monitored  as  doses  may  need  to  be 
altered to maintain therapeutic effect, is considered necessary.  
Metreleptin  levels  could  not  be  determined  after  Day  14  due  to  interference  of  the  assay  by  the 
presence  of  antibodies.  Overall,  the  results  indicated  that  the  anti-metreleptin  antibodies  did  not 
have  a  neutralising  effect  on  the  drug.  Further  evidence  suggesting  that  the  anti-metreleptin 
antibodies  were  not  neutralising  was  the  pronounced  PD  effects  (e.g.,  body  weight  loss,  and 
microscopic  findings  of  reduced  adipose)  recorded  in  the  mouse  and  dog  chronic  repeated-dose 
toxicity studies.  
Pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies have comprise two 6-month studies with daily s.c. 
administration of metreleptin: one in Swiss mice, including a recovery period and an interim sacrifice 
at 3 months, and another in Beagle dogs, with interim sacrifices at 1 and 3 months of treatment and 
three recovery periods (after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment).

Effects most consistently observed and attributed to the pharmacological effect included a reduction 
in body weight or body weight gain, decreased food consumption and atrophy of adipose tissue. 
Other effects observed were also generally considered as primarily or secondarily related to the 
intended activity of metreleptin, or to stress. Deaths which have occurred during the studies and for 
which a cause has been ascribed in relation to metreleptin have been attributed to overnight food 
and water deprivation prior to necropsy (mice) or marked body weight loss (dogs). Development of 
anti-drug antibodies was also observed in both studies.  
The liver seems to be a target organ in both species as well. However, no indication of liver toxicity 
was  seen  in  the  clinical  trials,  and  therefore  this  is  likely  not  clinically  relevant.  In  CD1  mice,  the 
kidney  was  also  identified  as  target  organ.  Tubular  degeneration,  pyelitis  and  pelvic  deposits  were 
the main findings at doses of 60 mg/kg/day iv dosing or higher. No toxicokinetics were performed in 
these studies with CD1 mice, but it can be assumed that exposure was sufficiently in excess of the 
human  exposure  at  the  maximum  dose,  based  on  other  mouse  data.  A  safety  margin  of  5  is 
expected at the NOAEL for the kidney which was not identified as a target organ in the clinical trials. 
Bioanalytical determination of toxicokinetics exposure in the studies, where available, correlated 
with reproducible dose-related effects on pharmacodynamics and toxicology, although there were 
issues with TK assay interference by antibodies in the dog following repeat treatment. However, 
formation of antibodies did not impact on pharmacodynamics and toxicology in this species. 
However, as the validation reports of the methods used were not submitted it is recommended that 
the applicant should supply these following the authorisation of the product.  
The applicant did not conduct any carcinogenicity studies with metreleptin. This was acceptable 
based on the fact that the pharmacological profile of metreleptin is essentially identical to that of 
endogenous leptin. Furthermore, metreleptin was shown to be devoid of genotoxic potential and 
pre-neoplastic, proliferative lesions were not reported in chronic subcutaneous toxicity studies in 
mice and dogs.  
Studies to investigate effects on reproductive toxicity were conducted in CD-1 mice and NZW rabbit. 
No effects on fertility and early embryonic development were observed. Reproductive toxicity studies 
conducted in mice did not reveal any adverse effects on mating, fertility or embryo-foetal 
development up to the maximum tested dose, approximately, 15-fold the maximum recommended 
clinical dose, based on body surface area of a 60 kg patient. 
In a pre- and postnatal development study in mice, metreleptin caused prolonged gestation and 
dystocia at all tested doses, starting at, approximately, a dose identical to the maximum 
recommended clinical dose, based on body surface area of a 60 kg patient. Prolonged gestation 
resulted in the death of some females during parturition and lower survival of offspring within the 
immediate postnatal period. These findings were considered to be related indirectly to metreleptin 
pharmacology, resulting in nutritional deprivation of treated animals, and also possibly, due to an 
inhibitory effect on spontaneous and oxytocin-induced contractions, as has been observed in strips 
of human myometrium exposed to leptin. Decreased maternal body weight was observed from 
gestation throughout lactation at all doses and resulted in reduced weight of offspring at birth, which 
persisted into adulthood. However, no developmental abnormalities were observed and reproductive 
performance of the first or second generations was not affected at any dose. 
The study did not include toxicokinetics analysis. Nevertheless, the occurrence of reductions in body 
weight/ body weight gain and food consumption, among the parental generation, together with the 
read across from a separate pharmacokinetic study in pregnant mice (Study REST070296-987087), 
indicates that metreleptin has been tested at sufficiently high doses.  
Local tolerance reactions were observed when rabbits were injected with a metreleptin concentration 
of  50  mg/ml,  which  persisted  after  a  2  week  recovery  period.  Although  no  signs  of  irritation  were

evident,  at  20  mg/ml  one  animal  had  chronic  active  inflammation  at  the  injection  site. 
Concentrations of 5 mg/ml, which are closer to the dose intended for human use, showed no signs 
of skin irritation or any other local effect.  
In  antigenicity  studies,  metreleptin  was  shown  to  have  the  potential  to  induce  active  systemic 
anaphylaxis  and  passive  cutaneous  anaphylaxis  in  guinea  pigs,  in  which  metreleptin  is  a  foreign 
protein.  However,  the  clinical  relevance  of  this  finding  is  unlikely,  since  most  foreign  proteins  can 
elicit similar responses 
The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or 
distribution  of  the  substance  in  the  environment.  No  environmental  risk  assessment  studies  were 
submitted which is in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 
medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Metreleptin has been adequately characterised in non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and 
toxicology studies. Nevertheless it is recommended that the applicant submits the validation reports 
for the methods used in the pivotal toxicity studies (with TK and immunogenicity) in mouse and dog 
and further characterises binding of metreleptin to proteins in serum as well as its tissue 
distribution.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Metreleptin PK has been quantified in 2 clinical studies in healthy subjects across a broad range of 
BMIs (normal weight to obese) as part of the Amgen obesity clinical development programme (LEPT-
970121 and LEPT-950272). Study LEPT-970121 investigated a dose range of 0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg/day 
via  intravenous  (IV)  bolus  injection,  and  Study  LEPT-950272  investigated  a  dose  range  of  0.01  to 
0.3 mg/kg/day via subcutaneous (SC) bolus injection.  
A further 2 clinical studies in overweight/obese subjects (DFA101 and DFA103) were also conducted 
as part of the Amgen obesity clinical development program. These studies were combination studies 
with  a  second  investigational  agent  (pramlintide)  and  are  therefore  not  directly  relevant  to  this 
application.  However,  PK  data  from  these  studies  were  included  in  comparative  PK/PD  analysis 
(REST120204) along with data from Studies FHA101 and LEPT-950272. 
Absorption  
Study LEPT-950272 
This  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multiple  ascending  dose  study  of  SC 
metreleptin in healthy subjects across a range of doses. 
The  PK  profile  of  metreleptin  after  a  single  SC  dose  was  characterised  by  an  absorption  phase 
leading  to  peak  concentrations  at  approximately  4  hours,  followed  by  a  mono-exponential 
elimination phase associated with a half-life of approximately 3 to 5 hours Table 19.

Study LEPT-970121 
Study  LEPT-970121  was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  multiple  ascending  dose 
study of metreleptin in healthy adult subjects. Metreleptin was administered once daily intravenously 
(bolus at an approximate rate of 1 mL/min).  
In total, 125 subjects (83 male, 42 female) between the age of 19 and 65 years were randomised: 
83  to  metreleptin  and  42  to  placebo.  111  subjects  completed  the  study  and  were  included  in  PK 
analyses Table 20.

Table 20. Metreleptin Pharmacokinetic Parameters after IV Metreleptin Administration Study 
LEPT-970121 
By  comparing  the  AUC0-∞  values  from  SC  dosing  to  IV  dosing,  the  absolute  bioavailability  of  SC 
metreleptin at 0.3 mg/kg was estimated to be approximately 94%. Half-life values were similar after 
SC and IV dosing. CL/F and Vz/F were also similar to CL and Vz, respectively (i.e., after SC and IV 
dosing) at 0.3 mg/kg 
No clinical studies have been conducted to formally evaluate the PK disposition of metreleptin in LD 
patients. Metreleptin PK data after SC administration in LD patients are available from a small 
subset of patients in Study FHA101 (13 patients with 8 to 10 hour PK profile.  
Metreleptin  was  administered  SC  in  LD  patients  in  study  FHA101.  PK  parameters  were  only 
calculated for the metreleptin naïve patients on day 1 and are presented in Table 21 together with

Additional information is available from a study in 7 Japanese patients with general LD described in 
literature (Ebihara, 2007 J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.). These patients received metreleptin BID for 
the first year, followed by transition to QD dosing after 1 year of treatment. The 100% replacement 
dose of metreleptin was 0.02 mg/kg/day for men, 0.03 mg/kg/day for females under 18 years of 
age, and 0.04 mg/kg/day for adult females. The peak plasma leptin levels occurred at approximately 
2 hours after the metreleptin dose. Mean (standard error [SE]) Cmax plasma leptin levels were 4.05 
(0.19), 9.80 (1.70), 18.95 (1.58), and 34.48 (2.11) ng/mL for 50, 100, 200, and 400% target 
doses, respectively. However, information is not available from this publication regarding PK 
sampling times. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In  Study  LEPT-970121,  metreleptin  PK  variability  was  low  with  percent  coefficients  of  variation  for 
Cmax and AUC0-∞ of 15 to 28%. In study LEPT-950272, variability in metreleptin PK was high at the 
lower  doses  with  CV%  for  Cmax  and  AUC0-∞  being  40  to  80%  after  bolus  doses  of  0.01  and  0.03 
mg/kg,  although  variability  was  lower  at  the  higher  doses  with  CV%  of  21  to  30%  at  0.1  and  0.3 
mg/kg.

The mean volume of distribution (Vz ± SD) following IV dosing in healthy adult subjects was 370 ± 
184  mL/kg,  398  ±  92  mL/kg,  and  463  ±  116  mL/kg  for  0.3,  1.0  and  3.0  mg/kg/day  doses, 
respectively. The volume of distribution on Day 15 following multiple IV injections was 186, 263 and 
275 mL/kg, respectively for the 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg/day (Table 20).  
Elimination 
Metreleptin is an analogue of human leptin which is believed to be predominantly renally eliminated 
in humans. Nonclinical data suggest renal clearance is the major route of metreleptin elimination, 
with no apparent contribution of systemic metabolism or degradation (study REST070294-
OBH.660).  
Following IV dosing, serum leptin concentrations declined mono-exponentially with a half-life of 3.3 
h to 3.4 h on Day 1 across all doses (0.3-3.0 mg/kg/day) and a total body clearance (CL) of 80.0 to 
96.0 mL/kg/h.  
The half-life of metreleptin following a single SC bolus dose of 0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg in healthy subjects 
was reported to be approximately 3 to 5 hours. CL/F ranged from 86 to 137 mL/h/kg. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
• 
Dose proportionality 
Results  of  study  LEPT-970121  showed  that  metreleptin  exposure  (Cmax  and  AUC0-∞)  increased 
approximately proportionally to dose after single intravenous injection from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg. A less 
than  dose-proportional  increase  in  Cmax  and  AUC0-∞  values  was  seen  with  the  highest  dose  group 
(3.0 mg/kg/day). Clearance was independent of dose across the range 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg, although it 
was higher at 3.0 mg/kg. After multiple IV injections (day 15), results were similar for Cmax (approx. 
dose proportional for 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg/day). However, no conclusions could be drawn for AUC0-∞ 
since these values could not be estimated confidently due to limited sampling duration.  
In study LEPT-950272, a close to dose-proportional increase in Cmax concentrations and AUC values 
was  seen  in  subjects  who  received  a  single  dose  of  metreleptin  (5  mg/mL)  via  SC  bolus  injection 
across  a  dose  range  from  0.01  to  0.3  mg/kg  .  The  t 1/2  values  and  the  dose-normalised  AUC0-∞ 
values among the different dosing regimens were similar (data not shown).  
• 
Time dependency 
Healthy subjects 
After  once  daily  IV  metreleptin  administration  in  study  LEPT-970121,  the  mean  Day  15  to  Day  1 
metreleptin  Cmax  ratios  were  0.9,  0.9  and  1.0  for  0.3,  1.0  and  3.0  mg/kg/day,  respectively.  An 
increase  in  exposure  over  time  was  reported  in  studies  LEPT-970121  and  LEPT-950272 in  subjects 
who developed anti-metreleptin antibodies.

LD patients 
Fasting serum leptin concentrations (endogenous leptin and metreleptin) from baseline to month 12 
were  reported  in  study  NIH991265/20010769  and  in  study  FHA101  (both  in  LD  patients).  An 
increase 
in 
leptin  concentrations  were  noted  by  month  3 
(FHA101)  or  month  4 
(NIH991265/20010769) with a further increase to month 6 (both studies) with leptin concentrations 
levelling off after that time.  
The  results  for  study  FHA101  are  presented  in  Figure  4.  In  GL  patients,  mean  increases  from 
baseline  in  leptin  concentrations  were  0.1  ng/mL  at  Month  3  (n=3)  and  56.5  ng/mL  at  Month  6 
(n=2). Changes from baseline in leptin concentration in the PL subgroup were greater than those in 
the overall GL group; mean increases were 101.1 ng/mL at Month 3 (n=4), 502.8 ng/mL at Month 6 
(n=4), 650.5 ng/mL at Month 12 (n=4). 
In study NIH991265/20010769, mean increases from baseline in leptin concentrations at Months 4, 
6  and  12  were  20.1,  75.0  and  49.7ng/mL,  respectively  in  GL  patients.  Results  for  changes  from 
baseline  in  leptin  concentration  in  the  PL  subgroup  were  similar  to  the  overall  GL  group;  mean 
increases at Month 4, 6 and 12 were 16.9, 124.5 and 43.1 ng/mL, respectively. 
Special populations 
No formal studies have been conducted to specifically evaluate the PK of metreleptin in special 
populations, however where possible, the effects of different intrinsic factors on the PK was assessed 
within and across studies. 
A covariate analysis was performed in REST120204 using data from study FHA101 (lipodystrophy 
program) and Studies LEPT-950272, DFA101, and DFA103 (Amgen Obesity program). 
• 
Impaired renal function 
The relationship between metreleptin PK and baseline demographic parameters (including estimated 
GFR  (eGFR))  was  explored  using  data  from  studies  FHA101,  LEPT-950272,  DFA101,  and  DFA103. 
This  analysis  showed  an  inverse  relationship  between  mean  Cmax  and  AUC0-10h  values  with  renal 
function (data not shown). 
In  order  to  supplement  the  limited  PK  data,  the  applicant  submitted  a  pharmacodynamic  (PD) 
analysis according to baseline creatinine clearance for study NIH 991265/20010769 Table 22.  
A  similar  analysis  was  conducted  in  the  FHA101  study  which  showed  that  the  dose  in  the  renally 
impaired  group  was  actually  higher  (0.10  mg/kg)  than  the  dose  in  the  renal  ‘normal’  group  (0.06 
mg/kg).

• 
Impaired hepatic function 
As metreleptin is cleared primarily by the kidney, hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect 
serum concentrations of metreleptin.  
• 
Gender 
Using an ANCOVA analysis, no effects of sex on metreleptin PK parameters were noted following IV 
dosing (Studies LEPT-970121). Following SC dosing (LEPT-950272), sex had a statistically significant 
effect on dose-normalised Cmax and AUC, which were higher in females than males.

• 
Race 
No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of race on the PK of metreleptin.  
• 
Weight 
An  analysis  of  covariance  to  test  the  effects  of  BMI  on  dose-normalised  AUC0-24h,  dose-normalised 
Cmax  and  CL/F  of  subjects  who  received  metreleptin  via  a  single  SC  bolus  injection  (LEPT-950272) 
showed that BMI had a statistically significant effect on dose-normalised AUC0-24h (higher in subjects 
with a higher BMI) and on CL/F (increasing with decreasing BMI). After a single IV metreleptin dose, 
BMI  was  tested  to  have  statistically  significant  effects  on  Cavg,  dose-normalised  Cmax,  t 1/2,  dose-
normalised AUC0-∞, and CL values. However, such BMI effects were not observed after multiple dose 
(Day 15) administration of metreleptin (LEPT-970121). 
A comparative analysis of PK data from healthy subjects and lipodystrophy patients noted an inverse 
relationship  between  the  mean  Cmax  for  metreleptin  and  baseline  BMI,  although  there  was  no 
apparent relationship between AUC and baseline BMI.  
• 
Elderly 
In  Studies  LEPT-970121  and  LEPT-950272,  ANCOVAs  were  performed  to  test  the  effect  of  age  on 
metreleptin PK parameters in healthy subjects. Following IV dosing, age had a statistically significant 
effect on average concentrations (Cavg), AUC0-∞/D and CL with older subjects tending to have higher 
Cavg and AUC0-∞/D and lower CL than younger subjects. Following SC dosing, no effects of age were 
noted.  
• 
Children 
In  Study  NIH  991265/20010769,  changes  over  time  in  fasting  serum  leptin  concentrations  were 
generally consistent for patients aged ≥6 to <12 years, ≥12 to <18 years and ≥18 years of age; the 
sample for patients <6 years was small (5 patients with a variable number of leptin sampling points) 
but also appeared to be consistent with the overall results.  
Likewise,  in  Study  FHA101,  changes  over  time  in  serum  leptin  concentrations  were  generally 
consistent for patients aged ≥6 to <12 years (n=2) and ≥12 to <18 years (n=1) in the GL group. In 
the PL subgroup, none of the patients were aged <18 years. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Because metreleptin is believed to be predominantly renally cleared, the applicant did not submit in 
vitro  studies  with  human  biomaterials  such  as  human  liver  microsomes  /  cytochrome  P450 
expressing cell lines to. In addition, no formal clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate drug-
drug interactions with metreleptin.  
Immunogenicity  
Three different assays for  the detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) have been used throughout 
the clinical development programme for metreleptin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 56/136 
 
 
 
A Radioimmunoassay (RIA) was initially developed to detect the presence of ADAs to metreleptin in 
plasma specimens from PK studies LEPT-970121 and LEPT-950272; safety studies in obese subjects 
LEPT-970213, LEPT-970164, LEPT-980236, LEPT-970171, and LEPT-970188).  
During  the  conduct  of  LEPT-980236,  a  validated  biosensor  immunoassay  became  available  and 
replaced the RIA used for the analysis of samples corresponding to earlier time points in this study. 
A  biosensor  assay  (using  a  different  sensor  chip)  was  also  used  to  detect  ADAs  in  LD  patients  in 
study NIH 991265/2001769. 
Measurement  of  binding  antibodies  to  metreleptin  in  LD  patients  in  Study  FHA101  and  study  NIH 
991265/2001769  was  performed  using  a  electrochemiluminescence  (ECL)  bridging-format  assay. 
This  method  was  also  used  for  detection  of  the  binding  antibodies  in  the  pramlintide/metreleptin 
combination obesity studies.  
Samples  that  were  positive  for  antibodies  to  metreleptin  for  any  of  the  ADA  testing  methodologies 
(RIA,  biosensor  and  ECL  assays)  were  tested  in  a  cell-based  bioassay  to  evaluate  for  neutralising 
activity. For NIH study 991265/2001769, all samples assessed for neutralising activity were assayed 
in parallel to the binding antibody testing. 
In both obese subjects and LD patients, a high incidence of development of ADAs to metreleptin was 
reported. In patients with LD receiving metreleptin with available ADA data, 88% had a positive ADA 
response, whereas 85% of patients included in the 5 Phase 2 Amgen obesity studies had at least 1 
post-baseline positive ADA response (and a negative antibody titer at baseline). 
Impact of ADAs on pharmacokinetics 
Healthy (normal to obese) subjects 
In  LEPT-970121,  following  multiple  dosing  of  metreleptin  administered  IV  in  normal  and  obese 
subjects at doses ranging from 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, exposure (Day 15 to Day 1 metreleptin 
AUC  ratios)  was  increased  in  subjects  with  a  positive  antibody  to  metreleptin  post  baseline, 
compared with subjects who did not develop antibodies to metreleptin (ANCOVA analysis). Similarly 
in  LEPT-950272,  subjects  who  tested  negative  for  antibody  formation  did  not  show  accumulation 
from  Day  1  to  Day  28.  In  subjects  who  tested  positive  for  antibody  formation,  higher  metreleptin 
concentrations were observed on Day 28 as compared with Day 1 and Day 14 results. 
LD patients 
A comparison of the 8 to 10 hour PK profiles conducted 3 months apart (PK1 and PK2) in 13 patients 
in study FHA101 revealed that although the overall shape of the profiles remained the same, higher 
metreleptin  exposure  (dose-normalised)  was  observed  in  the  presence  of  high  ADA  titres  of  to 
metreleptin. 
The impact of immunogenicity on metreleptin PK in patients with lipodystrophy in the NIH pivotal 
study has not been formally evaluated due to the limited antibody and leptin level data. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No human PD studies were submitted.  
Mechanism of action 
Metreleptin exerts its function by binding to and activating the human leptin receptor (ObR), which 
belongs to the Class I cytokine family of receptors that signals through the JAK/STAT transduction 
pathway.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Metreleptin PK has been quantified in 2 clinical studies (LEPT-970121 and LEPT-950272) in healthy 
subjects  across  a  broad  range  of  BMIs  (normal  weight  to  obese).  Metreleptin  PK  data  after 
subcutaneous  (SC)  administration  in  LD  patients  are  available  from  a  small  subset  of  patients  in 
Study FHA101 and from a published study in 7 Japanese patients.  
After a single SC dose (0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg) in healthy subjects, metreleptin was rapidly (Tmax at ~4 
hours)  and  extensively  (estimated  F=0.94)  absorbed,  followed  by  a  mono-exponential  elimination 
phase associated with a half-life of approximately 3 to 5 hours. No absolute bioavailability study was 
conducted;  however  a  high  bioavailability  was  estimated  by  indirect  comparison  of  PK  parameters 
obtained  in  different  studies  after  a  single  0.3  mg/kg  IV  and  SC  dose  of  metreleptin.  Exposure 
parameters (Cmax and AUC) increased in proportion to dose after a single IV and SC administration 
across  a  dose  range  (0.01  to  0.3  mg/kg)  within  the  SmPC  recommended  metreleptin  dose  range. 
Peak plasma leptin levels occurred at 2h after dosing in the 7 Japanese patients. 
The  volume  of  distribution  of  metreleptin  was  reported  to  be  approximately  4  to  5  times  plasma 
volume  in  healthy  adult  subjects  following  IV  dosing,  which  suggests  extensive  distribution  of 
metreleptin into tissues.  
Total  body  clearance  after  IV  administration  was  consistent  with  glomerular  filtration  rate  (GFR)  in 
subjects  with  normal  renal  function.  The  importance  of  renal  elimination  is  expected  taken  into 
account  the  small  size  (16  kDa)  of  metreleptin.  Given  the  elimination  profile  of  metreleptin,  the 
absence  of  classical  in  vitro  studies  to  investigate  hepatic  enzyme-mediated  metabolism  and  its 
interaction potential was considered acceptable.  
Nevertheless,  leptin  is  a  cytokine  and  therefore  has  the  potential  to  alter  the  formation  of 
cytochrome P450 enzymes. The potential effect of metreleptin on CYP450 enzymes may be clinically 
relevant  for  CYP450  substrates  with  narrow  therapeutic  index,  where  the  dose  is  individually 
adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of metreleptin, in patients being treated with these types 
of agents, therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin), or drug concentrations (e.g. cyclosporin 
or theophylline) should be performed and the individual dose of the agent adjusted as needed. 
In  addition,  since  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  metreleptin  may  reduce  exposure  to  substrates  of 
CYP3A  through  enzyme  induction  the  efficacy  of  hormonal  contraceptives  may  be  reduced  if  co-
administered with metreleptin. Therefore, an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method should 
be considered during treatment. 
Very limited PK data are available in LD patients. In a comparative analysis between LD patients and 
healthy  subjects  (REST120204),  the  Tmax  was  consistent  in  both  populations  (~4h),  whereas  the 
mean  Cmax  and  AUC0-10h  values  for  metreleptin  were  found  to  be  slightly  lower  in  LD  patients 
compared  to  healthy  subjects  (approx.  35%  for  AUC0-10h  and  41%  for  Cmax).  These  changes  are 
considered to fall within the variability of the PK of metreleptin.  
No accumulation of metreleptin was seen with QD dosing in healthy subjects (study LEPT-970121). 
However,  both  in  LD  patients  and  healthy  subjects,  an  increase  in  exposure  was  observed  in  the 
presence  of  anti-drug  antibodies  to  metreleptin.  Noteworthy,  the  development  of  ADAs  occurred 
with high incidence in both LD patients and obese subjects. The assumption that high antibody titres 
increase  exposure  due  to  a  decrease  in  renal  elimination  is  considered  plausible.  The  increase  in 
metreleptin  exposure  with  higher  antibody  titres  would  be  consistent  with  a  decrease  in  renal 
elimination of metreleptin in the presence of antibodies to metreleptin. 
However, there are still some uncertainties regarding the impact of ADAs on circulating levels of 
active metreleptin. Different assays were used throughout studies to determine ADAs (RIA, 
biosensor assay and ECL bridging assay). Samples that were positive for antibodies to metreleptin 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 58/136 
 
 
 
for any of the ADA testing methodologies were tested in a cell-based bioassay to evaluate for 
neutralising activity.   
No  formal  studies  have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  PK  of  metreleptin  in  special  populations. 
Since  metreleptin  is  expected to  be  primarily  renally  eliminated  and  renal diseases  are  reported to 
be  associated  with  GL,  it  is  possible  that  changes  in  creatinine  clearance  following  metreleptin 
administration  may  alter  metreleptin  exposure.  An  analysis  based  on  baseline  creatinine  clearance 
levels  did  not  reveal  any  PD  effect  (change  in  HBA1c  and  triglyceride  levels)  after  12  months  of 
metreleptin therapy. Based on the above no dose recommendations can be  made for patients with 
renal impairment. Dosing in LD patients will be individually titrated based on metabolic parameters 
and  responses,  as  well  as  tolerability;  therefore,  differences  any  effect  due  to  differences  in  renal 
function  can  be  accounted  for  through  titration  of  the  dose.  An  additional  statement  has  been 
included  in  the  SmPC  to  alert  prescribers  that  pharmacokinetics  may  be  altered  in  patients  with 
renal impairment. 
Based upon the observation that in the general population, females have higher concentrations of 
leptin compared with males even after adjustment for differences in body composition, the proposed 
starting dose of metreleptin does differ between males (2.5 mg) and females (5.0 mg) weighing 
>40 kg 
Currently, PK data in children are limited to one patient of 16 years old. However, a safety, efficacy, 
and PK study to evaluate metreleptin use in paediatric patients <6 years of age is planned as part of 
the ongoing Paediatric Investigation Plan for metreleptin.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of metreleptin is considered to have been adequately characterised from 
the submitted data. As there are some uncertainties over the detection of anti-drug antibodies and 
their potential impact on patients with GL and PL the applicant will investigate this through a 
detailed immunogenicity strategy. This will involve developing validated assays to better detect this 
antibodies and collection of samples from a variety of clinical studies.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Information to support metreleptin dosage instructions has been developed from the long-term 
efficacy results from Study NIH 991265/20010769. Dosing of metreleptin was empirical and evolved 
as the investigators gained experience in the NIH trials.  
At  the  time  of  initiation  of  the  pilot  Study  991265,  the  dose  of  metreleptin  that  was  proposed  to 
achieve  a  normal  leptin  concentration  by  NIH  was  0.03  mg/kg  of  lean  body  weight  for  female 
children  between  14  and  18  years  of  age,  0.04  mg/kg  of  lean  body  weight  for  adult  females,  and 
0.02  mg/kg  of  lean  body  weight  for  males  regardless  of  age.  The  doses  administered  to  females 
were  1.5  to  2  times  as  high  as  those  given  to  males  based  on  the  known  gender  dimorphism  of 
leptin  levels  in  healthy  subjects,  with  women  having  higher  leptin  levels  than  men  even  after 
adjustment for differences in body.  
In the pilot study (NIH 991265), metreleptin treatment was initiated at 50% target dose: total daily 
dose was 0.02 mg/kg/day in females ≥18 years, and 0.015 mg/kg/day for females <18 years, and 
0.01 mg/kg for males regardless of age. The dose was then doubled after 1 month to 100% dose, 
and then doubled again after an additional 1 month to 200% dose. The daily dose was administered 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 59/136 
 
 
 
in 2 equally divided AM and PM doses. The low initial starting dose and conservative titration scheme 
was  used  as  this  was  the  first  such  study  of  metreleptin  administration  in  LD  patients;  there  was 
uncertainty regarding doses that would be efficacious as well as uncertainty regarding any potential 
safety or tolerability issues.  
The dosing regimen in the long-term Study 20010769 was initially the same as the pilot study. Due 
to the absence of tolerability issues and the higher dosing to achieve efficacy, dosing of metreleptin 
evolved  to  initiating  at  more  efficacious  doses  with  minimal  titration.  In  addition,  the  protocol  was 
amended to initiate with QD dosing (same total daily dose) instead of BID. In females ≥5 years of 
age,  the  modified  starting  dose  was  0.08  to  0.10  mg/kg/day,  in  females  <5  years  of  age  and  all 
males,  the  starting  dose  was  0.06  mg/kg/day.  Because  of  the  substantial  variability  in  individual 
metabolic profiles at baseline and differences in response to metreleptin (likely due in large part to 
sex  and  LD  type),  metreleptin  doses  for  each  patient  were  adjusted  according  to  individual 
response,  e.g.,  increased  in  an  attempt  to  achieve  better  efficacy  or  decreased  due  to  adverse 
events or effects such as  excessive weight loss. All dose escalations were performed in increments 
of 0.02 mg/kg/day for females 10 years of age and older, and 0.01 mg/kg/day in all other patients. 
Based  on  data  from  Study  NIH  991265/20010769,  a  fixed  initial  metreleptin  dosing  regimen  (total 
daily dose of 5 mg in females and 2.5 mg in males) for patients >40 kg is proposed. The difference 
in gender in leptin levels is also supported by literature data. A weight-based dosing is proposed for 
patients with weight <40 kg (total daily dose of mg/kg), which is intended to capture the majority of 
paediatric  patients.  Based  on  clinical  response  (e.g.,  inadequate  metabolic  control)  or  other 
consideration  (e.g.,  tolerability  issues,  excessive  weight  loss;  especially  in  paediatric  patients),  the 
dose may be decreased or increased to the maximum dose listed in Table 23.

Study NIH 991265/20010769: Long Term Efficacy and Safety of Leptin Replacement in the 
Treatment of Patients with Lipodystrophy 
Methods 
The pilot study (991265) was a dose-escalation study to determine the safety and efficacy of short-
term  leptin  replacement  (up  to  8  months)  and  the  long-term  study  (20010769)  was  conducted  to 
determine  the  long-term  safety  and  efficacy  of  metreleptin  treatment  for  patients  with  LD.  Study 
20010769 allowed for the rollover of patients from the pilot study, as well as for direct enrolment of 
new patients. Both studies were open-label.

ng/mL (original protocol) or < 4 ng/mL (Amendment B) in males with Amendment C of this protocol, 
when the leptin levels were modified as noted for patients >5 years of age. Leptin levels for children 
6 months to 5 years were added in Amendment D.)

6. Study 2001769: Persons with impaired decision-making capacity and who may have been 
unable to provide informed consent may have participated in this study per the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator (added with Amendment I). 
Exclusion criteria 
• 
Pregnant women, women in their reproductive years who did not use an effective method of 
birth control, and women who were nursing or who were lactating within 6 weeks of having 
completed nursing; 
•  Known infectious liver disease (in Study 99165, known liver disease due to causes other 
than NASH); 
•  Known human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection (added with Amendment B to Protocol 
2001769); 
•  Current alcohol or substance abuse; 
• 
Psychiatric disorder impeding competence or compliance; 
•  Active tuberculosis; 
•  Use of anorexigenic drugs; 
•  Other condition(s) that in the opinion of the clinical investigators would impede completion 
of the study; 
• 
Patients who have a known hypersensitivity to Escherichia coli-derived proteins. 
Treatments 
All recruited patients received metreleptin. Dosing was calculated on a body weight basis and varied 
by age and sex. As knowledge was gained with metreleptin treatment, the dose and regimen were 
modified.  In  the  pilot  study,  the  target  dose  of  metreleptin  was  0.04  mg/kg/day  in  females  ≥  18 
years,  0.03  mg/kg/day  for  females  <  18  years,  and  0.02  mg/kg  for  males  and  was  to  be 
administered in divided doses twice daily; dosing was 50% of target during Month 1, 100% at Month 
2 and 200% at Month 3.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 62/136 
 
 
 
The dosing regimen in Study 20010769 was initially the same as in Study 991265 but was modified 
to initiate at more typical efficacious doses with minimal titration and dosing frequency changed to 
once daily. In females ≥ 5 years of age, the modified starting dose was 0.08 to 0.10 mg/kg/day, in 
females  <  5  years  of  age  and  all  males,  the  starting  dose  was  0.06  mg/kg/day.  The  dose  of 
metreleptin  could  be increased  after  the  6-month  follow-up.  Dose  escalations  were  capped  at  0.24 
mg/kg/day  for  any  patient  without  prior  approval.  If  patients  did  not  tolerate  a  higher  dose  level, 
they could continue the study at the next lowest tolerated dose.  
Objectives 
The objectives of the core protocol for Study 991265 as outlined in the original protocol through the 
final amendment (Amendment 3) were: 
•  To determine if metreleptin can be safety administered to a group of patients with clinically 
significant lipodystrophy; 
•  To determine if metreleptin treatment will be effective in lowering plasma glucose and lipid 
abnormalities in patients with clinically significant lipodystrophy. 
Additional  objectives  were  to  determine  if  treatment  with  metreleptin  could  ameliorate  lipid 
deposition  in  liver  and  muscle  or  improve  the  hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism  observed  in  some 
patients. Limited data were captured in the study database to assess these objectives. 
The  main  objectives  of  Study  20010769  as  outlined  in  the  final  protocol,  Expedited  Amendment  O 
(with modifications from the original protocol noted) were: 
•  To  determine  if  metreleptin  can  be  safely  administered  to  patients  with  lipodystrophy  and 
low  leptin  levels  starting  at  age  6  months  (modified  from  starting  at  age  5  years  with 
Amendment D); 
•  To determine if metreleptin treatment will be effective in lowering plasma glucose and lipid 
abnormalities in patients with lipodystrophy and leptin deficiency starting at 6 months of age 
(modified from starting at 5 years of age with Amendment D);  
•  To  determine  if  metreleptin  treatment  will  be  effective  in  preventing  glucose  and  lipid 
abnormalities in these young patients; 
•  To determine if metreleptin treatment will be effective in patients with less severe forms of 
lipodystrophy  (as  evidenced  by  slightly  higher  circulating  leptin  concentrations)  in  terms  of 
improving insulin sensitivity, triglyceride levels and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (as 
assessed  by  liver  volume,  serum  markers  of  liver  inflammation  and  function  [added  with 
Amendment D], and liver histopathology); 
•  To  determine  if  metreleptin  treatment  will  be  effective  in  treating  or  delaying  the 
development of NASH (as assessed by biochemical markers, liver volume, imaging and liver 
histopathology [if clinically indicated]); 
•  To  determine  effective  dose  ranges  of  metreleptin  for  patients  with  lipodystrophy  (added 
with Amendment B);  
•  To  devise  effective  anti-diabetic  and  lipid-lowering  regimens  concomitantly  with  leptin  for 
patients with lipodystrophy and leptin deficiency starting at age 6 months. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints in this study were defined as:  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 63/136 
 
 
 
•  Actual change from baseline in HbA1c at Month 12, and  
•  Percent change from baseline in fasting serum triglycerides at Month 12  
The  co-primary  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  using  the  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS),  defined  as  all 
patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and who had either primary efficacy parameter 
of interest measured at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit. 
Key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  based  on  responder  analyses  at  Month  12.  These  were 
conducted  as  a  potential  indication  of  clinical  benefit  to  investigate  if  patients  could  achieve  target 
reductions in HbA1c or in fasting triglyceride levels by Month 12, as follows.  
•  Proportion of patients achieving target actual decreases of:  
o  ≥1%  decrease  in  HbA1c  or  ≥30%  decrease  in  fasting  serum  triglycerides  at  Month 
12;  
o  ≥1.5% decrease in HbA1c or ≥35% decrease in fasting serum triglycerides at Month 
12; 
o  ≥2%  decrease  in  HbA1c  or  ≥40%  decrease  in  fasting  serum  triglycerides  at  Month 
12  
•  Actual and percent change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose levels at Month 12. 
Sample size 
Based on preliminary data in a cross-sectional study, the mean ± SD HbA1c data for 8 patients with 
generalised lipodystrophy was 9.1±2.2%. Based on assumption of a 1.5% (for protocol 991265 and 
1.0% for 20010769) actual decrease in HbA1c levels over a period of 4 months (for protocol 991265 
(and  12  months  for  20010769)  as  clinically  meaningful,  10  patients  would  be  required  for  80% 
study power and an alpha error of 5%. Also, based on previous cross-sectional data, the mean ± SD 
fasting triglyceride levels for 8 patients with generalised lipodystrophy was 2200±900 mg/dL. Based 
on  assumption  of  660  mg/dL  (or  30%  decrease  from  the  mean  baseline)  decrease  as  clinically 
meaningful, 10 patients with hypertriglyceridemia would be required for 80% study power and 5% 
alpha error. 
Upon  validation  of the  sample  size  calculation,  it  was  found  that  based  on  the  assumptions  above, 
32  patients  would  be  required  in  order  to  detect  a  1%  actual  decrease  in  HbA1c  and  15  patients 
would be required in order to detect a 1.5% actual decrease in HbA1c with 80% power and 5% one-
sided alpha error. For triglycerides, a sample size of 13 would be required to detect a reduction of 
660 mg/dL with 80% power and 5% on-sided alpha error. As noted, the final sample size across the 
2 protocols was 107 patients.

Statistical methods 
Actual  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  and  actual  and  percent  change  from  baseline  in  fasting 
triglyceride levels were summarised using descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
P-values were computed using paired t-tests to determine if the change from baseline to Month 12 
was significantly different from 0, at a one-sided α-level of 0.025. A last observation carried forward 
(LOCF)  method  was  used  to  impute  any  missing  Month  12  results.  The  imputation  only  included 
results that were at least 6 months (180 days) post-baseline. 
Sensitivity/supportive  analyses  were  performed  on  the  co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  using  other 
pre-specified  analysis  sets  based  on  exclusion  of  patients  due  to  major  protocol  violations  or  who 
had  modifications  in  concomitant  antidiabetic  or  lipid  lowering  therapies  that  may  have  had  an 
impact  on  the  efficacy  analyses.  This  included  analyses  based  on  all  patients  in  the  FAS  who  had 
controlled  concomitant  medication  use,  described  as  no  change  or  a  decrease  in  baseline 
concomitant  medications  (antidiabetic  or  lipid  lowering  therapies),  through  Month  12  and  was 
termed  the  Controlled  Concomitant  Medication  Full  Analysis  Set  (CFAS).  Sensitivity  analyses  were 
also  performed  on  the  co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  using  other  analysis  sets,  including  Efficacy 
Evaluable Analysis Set (EEAS), defined as patients in the FAS who have either efficacy parameter of 
interest  measured  at  Month  12  and  have  no  major  protocol  violations  prior  to  Month  12;  and 
Controlled  Concomitant  Medication  EEAS  (CEEAS),  defined  as  all  patients  in  the  CFAS  who  have 
either  efficacy  parameter  of  interest  measured  at  Month  12  and  have  no  major  protocol  violations 
prior to Month 12. 
An  additional  sensitivity  analysis  using  the  FAS  on  the  co-primary  endpoints  used  a  worst 
observation carried forward (WOCF) imputation method. 
Key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  conducted  primarily  using  the  FAS  with  sensitivity  analyses 
performed using the EEAS, CFAS, and CEEAS.

Conduct of the study 
As this was an investigator-sponsored clinical trial, there was no systematic collection of protocol 
deviation data. Significant protocol violations that became apparent upon review of the data and 
that led to exclusion of patient data from the efficacy evaluable analysis sets primarily related to 
prolonged dose interruptions, baseline leptin levels above the required eligibility criteria, and on-
study pregnancies with continued treatment. 
A total of 26 patients were noted to have a major protocol violation, including 16 patients (24%) 
with GL and 10 patients (24%) with PL, including 8 (26%) in the PL subgroup. The most common 
violations were dose interruptions >2 weeks, reported during the first 12 months of treatment in 6 
GL patients and after Month 12 in 7 patients with GL and 5 patients with PL. 
There  were  3  amendments  for  Study  991265.  The  key  changes  implemented  by  protocol 
amendment  were  to  increase  the  duration  of  the  study  from  4  to  8  months,  extended  treatment 
duration beyond 8 months or until the patient enrolled into Study 20010769 and minimum age for 
inclusion (from >14 years to >5 years) and for patients with higher leptin levels (from <3 ng/mL to 
≤6 ng/mL in males and from <4 ng/mL to ≤ 8 in females). However, all patients enrolled under this 
protocol were >14 years of age and had leptin levels <4 ng/mL at baseline.

Over the course of 14 years, a total of 15 amendments were made to the original protocol for Study 
2001769.  The  key  changes  implemented  by  protocol  amendment  are  concerning  increase  of  the 
sample  size,  starting  dose  (no  longer  required  dose  escalation),  dosing  regimen  BID-QD,  baseline 
leptin levels upper limit (6 ng/mL to 12 ng/mL for females and from 4 ng/mL to 8 ng/mL for males), 
minimum  age  for  inclusion  (from  >5  years  to  >6  months),  exclusion  of  PL  patients  with 
haematologic  abnormalities.  Note  that  as  required  by  the  NIH  review  committee,  the  protocols 
underwent  annual  reviews  and  at  each  review  were  listed  as  protocol  amendment  regardless  of 
where changes were or were not implemented.

Patient  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics,  medication  use  and  metabolic  characteristics  are 
summarised  for  the  Safety  Analysis  Set  in  Table  25,  Table  26  and  Table  27.  The  data  are  very

Outcomes and estimation 
Co-primary endpoints: HbA1c and Triglycerides 
Results for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoints of actual changes from baseline to Month 
12 in HbA1c and actual and percent changes for baseline in triglycerides using LOCF (after Month 
6/Day 180) for the FAS are presented in Table 29.

Following review of individual patient data for outlier results, it was noted that 1 patient, had a 
>1000% increase from baseline to Month 12 for triglyceride levels; the only patient in the study 
with this level of change at Month 12. This patient entered the trial with a triglyceride level of 3.0 
mmol/L, which increased to 18.6 mmol/L at month 6 and to 37.7 mmol/L at month 12.  
This patient was terminated from the study by the Investigator 2 days prior to the Month 12 
assessment for noncompliance with study drug administration. Based on this, an ad hoc analysis 
was conducted for the FAS excluding this patient’s data Table 30.

Key secondary endpoint: Fasting Glucose Levels 
In  general,  changes  in  fasting  plasma  glucose  followed  a  similar  pattern  as  changes  in  HbA1c. 
Among  the  patients  with  GL  included  in  the  FAS,  treatment  with  metreleptin  led  to  clinically 
meaningful  and  statistically  significant  reductions  in  fasting  glucose;  mean  glucose  levels  were 
reduced  from  10.2  mmol/L  at  baseline  to  7.0  mmol/L  at  Month  12/LOCF,  a  mean  change  of  -3.0 
mmol/L  (p<0.001),  representing  a  20%  decrease  in  fasting  glucose  levels.  Females  had  a  greater 
reduction  in  fasting  glucose  levels  (-3.4  mmol/L),  which  was  statistically  significant  (p<0.001) 
compared to males (-1.6 mmol/L; p=0.191). This may be related to a lower baseline glucose level in 
males  compared  to  females  (9.0  vs  10.5  mmol/L); note  that  mean  fasting  glucose  levels  at  Month 
12/LOCF were comparable in males and females (7.1 and 7.0 mmol/L, respectively).  
Results  in  the  PL  subgroup  were  similar  to  the  GL  group  for  the  FAS;  in  the  PL  subgroup,  mean 
baseline glucose levels were 10.0 mmol/L with a reduction to a mean level of 8.1 mmol/L at Month 
12/LOCF, a mean change of -1.8 mmol/L (p = 0.003), representing a 13% decrease from baseline. 
Mean changes in the overall PL group were also statistically significant but of lower magnitude (-1.2 
mmol/L; p = 0.012).  
Key secondary efficacy endpoint: target reductions in HbA1c or triglycerides 
Nearly  80%  of  patients  in  the  FAS  with  GL  had  a  ≥1%  actual  decrease  in  HbA1c  or  a  ≥30% 
decrease in triglycerides at Month 12/LOCF with 66% achieving the highest target decreases of ≥2% 
in  HbA1c  or  a  ≥40%  in  triglycerides  at  that  time.  The  percent  of  females  with  GL  who  achieved 
these  target  levels  was  higher  than  that  of  males,  although  71%  of  male  GL  patients  had  a  ≥1% 
actual decrease in HbA1c or a ≥30% decrease in triglycerides at Month 12 with 50% achieving the 
highest target decreases of ≥2% in HbA1c or a ≥40% in triglycerides at Month 12/LOCF.  
Results  were  consistent  in  the  PL  subgroup  for  the  FAS,  with  68%  of  patients  in  the  PL  subgroup 
achieving  a  ≥1%  actual decrease  in  HbA1c or  a  ≥30%  decrease  in triglycerides  at  Month  12/LOCF 
and 43% achieving the highest target decreases of ≥2% in HbA1c or ≥40% in triglycerides. In the 
CFAS  for  the  PL  subgroup,  55%  had  a  ≥1%  actual  decrease  in  HbA1c  or  a  ≥30%  decrease  in 
triglycerides  at  Month  12/LOCF  with  27%  achieving the  highest target  decreases  of  ≥2%  in  HbA1c 
or a ≥40% in triglycerides at that time. 
Secondary / exploratory endpoints 
Mean changes in other lipid parameters, including total cholesterol and LDL-C, were consistent with 
those reported for triglycerides with mean reductions noted to Month 12/LOCF for both parameters; 
little to no change was noted for HDL-C.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 74/136 
 
 
 
 
 
In  the  GL  group,  mean  changes  to  Month  12/LOCF  of  -2.3  and  -0.9  mmol/L  were  noted  for  total 
cholesterol  and  LDL-C,  respectively,  representing  mean  percent  changes  of  -28%  and  -24%. 
Reductions  in  total  cholesterol  were  greater  for  female  patients  with  GL  compared  with  males, 
whereas reductions in LDL-C were similar. In the PL subgroup, mean change in total cholesterol to 
Month 12/LOCF was -0.9 mmol/L (-11% change) and in LDL-C was -0.3 mmol/L (-4% change). 
Most  patients  in  the  GL  group  entered  the  study  with  elevated  hepatic  transaminase  levels  (74% 
with ALT >ULN and 55% with AST >ULN). In these patients, substantial reductions in both ALT and 
AST  occurred  during  treatment  with  metreleptin.  Mean  change  in  the  GL  group  from  baseline  to 
Month  12/LOCF  in  ALT  was  -53.1  U/L;  the  changes  were  observed  early  with  a  mean  change  to 
Month 4 in GL patients of -42.1 U/L. Similar results were observed for AST with a mean change in 
the GL group to Month 4 of -23.3 U/L and to Month 12/LOCF of -23.8 U/L. The reductions were more 
notable  in  male  patients  with  GL,  as  a  higher  percent  of  male  patients  entered  the  study  with 
elevated transaminase levels (87% and 67% with ALT and AST >ULN, respectively). 
Reductions  in  transaminase  levels  were  also  observed  in  the  PL  subgroup,  although  of  lower 
magnitude than that in the GL group; this is likely related to lower baseline levels of ALT and AST in 
this  group  of  patients  (29%  and  23%  with  ALT  and  AST  >ULN,  respectively).  In  the  PL  subgroup, 
mean changes to Month 12/LOCF in ALT and AST were -5.0 U/L and -6.0 U/L, respectively. 
Among the 21 patients with GL who could be assessed for changes from baseline in liver volume, 15 
(71%) had reductions observed at all post-baseline assessments (4 of these patients had only 1 or 2 
assessments  post  baseline)  and  an  additional  4  patients  had  reductions  at  all  assessments  on  or 
after  Month  12  of  treatment.  Reductions  in  liver  volume  for  these  19  patients  ranged  from  7%  to 
71%,  with  most  patients  (12  of  19)  having  reductions  in  liver  volume  ≥30%.  The  remaining  2 
patients with GL who had baseline and post-baseline results did show reductions in liver volume but 
not at all assessments. 
Among  the  8  patients  in  the  PL  subgroup,  4  (50%)  had  reductions  observed  at  all  post-baseline 
assessments  (1  of  these  patients  had  only  2  assessments  post-baseline)  and  an  additional  patient 
had  reductions  at  all  assessments  on  or  after  Month  12.  Reductions  in  liver  volume  for  these  5 
patients  ranged  from  8%  to  51%.  The  remaining  3  patients  in  the  PL  subgroup  who  had  baseline 
and post-baseline results did show reductions in liver volume but not at all assessments. 
13 of the 30 patients with data available for analysis of changes in liver volume were <18 years of 
age. Reductions from baseline were observed at all assessments in 10 (77%) of these 13 paediatric 
patients (2 had only 1 or 2 post-baseline assessments); the remaining 3 patients had reductions at 
all  assessments  after  Month  12.  Reductions  ranged  from  7%  to  64%  with  most  patients  (8  of  13) 
having  reductions  ≥30%.  Consistent  with  these  results,  the  mean  (SD)  reduction  from  baseline  to 
Month  12  in  liver  volume  for  the  7  patients  <18  years  of  age  who  could  be  assessed  (all  were 
patients with GL) was -35.1%.  
Oral glucose tolerance tests (1.75 g/kg glucose up to 75 g ingested orally) were performed to assess 
the  effect  of  metreleptin  on  glucose  tolerance.  After  4  months  of  metreleptin therapy,  both  fasting 
(time 0) and 3-hour glucose levels were reduced with further reductions at Month 8. These results 
were sustained through 12 months of therapy. Consistent with these results, the mean (SD) average 
changes in glucose levels across all time points (0 to 180 minutes) during the OGTT from baseline to 
Months 4, 8, and 12 for GL patients were -2.2 (5.28) mmol/L, -3.5 (4.46) mmol/L, and -4.2 (5.23) 
mmol/L,  respectively.  Data  were  available  for  20  and  24  patients  at  months  4  and  8  respectively, 
compared to 49 available at baseline and month 12.  
For the PL subgroup, data were only available for 9 and 12 patients at Months 4 and 8, respectively, 
compared  to  28  and  20  patients  with  data  available  at  baseline  and  Month  12.  The  mean  (SD) 
average  changes  in  glucose  levels  across  all  time  points  (0  to  180  minutes)  during  the  OGTT  from

baseline to Months 4, 8 and 12 for patients in the PL subgroup were -2.5 (1.34) mmol/L, -0.4 (3.70) 
mmol/L,  and  -0.8  (2.40)  mmol/L,  respectively.  Results  were  more  variable  in  this  subgroup  of 
patients, although the curve for Month 12 is consistently below that of the baseline curve. 
Plasma  glucose  profiles  in  response  to  an  insulin  tolerance  test  (injection  of  0.2  U  insulin/kg  body 
weight)  for  the  GL  group  show  that  mean  glucose  profile  in  response  to  an  intravenous  insulin 
challenge was substantially lower after Month 4 of metreleptin treatment, consistent with increased 
insulin  sensitivity,  with  similar  results  observed  at  Months  8  and  Month  12  of  treatment  in  the  GL 
group. Results were similar in the PL subgroup, although the data were more limited. 
The  effect  of  metreleptin  on  fasting  insulin  concentrations  (a  marker  of  insulin  resistance)  was 
examined  in  those  patients  who  were  not  receiving  concomitant  insulin  therapy.  Median  changes 
from  baseline  to  Month  12/LOCF  in  fasting  insulin  concentrations  were  -20.6  mU/L  among  the  28 
patients in the GL group with data included in the analysis and 1.5 mU/L among the 14 patients in 
the PL subgroup with data available. 
Ancillary analyses 
The potential effect of baseline levels of HbA1c and triglycerides on response to metreleptin was 
evaluated; both changes from baseline in these 2 parameters and responder analyses were 
produced. Results for these analyses for the overall GL group are provided in Table 31 and Table 
32.

Treatment (NIH Studies 991265/20010769 and Study FHA101) 
Limited information is available with regards to the reversibility following cessation of treatment. The 
only patient that had continued Nab seropositivity after study termination, and for whom data was 
available, was a GL patient.  
Sixteen  (42.1%)  of  a  total  of  38  patients  whom  developed  nABs  did  not  achieve  resolution  of  NAc 
while receiving metreleptin or in the follow-up period.  
In the PL group, 13 patients whom developed nABs during the metreleptin therapy, and 6 of them 
saw  resolution  of  the  NAc  during  the  treatment  itself.  Of  the  13  patients  with  NAbs  only  5  had  no 
impact whatsoever on efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 80/136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  the  GL  group,  15  of  the  25  patients  that  developed  nABs  had  resolution  of  neutralising  activity 
during treatment and in total 20 out of these 25 patients saw attenuation of efficacy. In the 10 GL 
patients that had no resolution of NAc, only four had unaffected efficacy.

Clinical studies in special populations 
A total of 4 patients aged 2 to 6 years of age were treated in Study NIH 991265/20010769; all were 
female and all had congenital generalised lipodystrophy (CGL). Changes in the metabolic parameters 
in these patients following metreleptin treatment are summarised in Table 38. 
Table 38. Change from baseline in HbA1c and fasting triglycerides in GL patients, 2-6 years of age 
treated with metreleptin, Study 991265/20010769 
Baseline metabolic parameters in these patients were also compared to those of the other paediatric 
populations in the study Table 39.

Table 39. Mean (range) baseline HbA1c, triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose in paediatric GL 
patients by age category, Study 991265/20010769-FAS 
Supportive study 
Study FHA101 was a treatment IND study designed to provide access to metreleptin for patients 5 
years of age and older physician-confirmed lipodystrophy (GL and PL) who had diabetes mellitus 
and/or hypertriglyceridaemia with triglycerides >200 mg/dL.  
Dosing  was  administered  on  a  body  weight  basis.  At  the  start  of  the  study,  patients  initiated 
metreleptin at 0.02 mg/kg twice daily (BID) for 1 week, and increased the dose to 0.04 mg/kg BID 
for  the  rest  of  the  treatment  period  unless  dose  adjustment  was  necessary.  Following  a  protocol 
amendment,  patients  weighing  ≤40  kg  received  the  recommended  daily  dose  of  0.06  mg/kg 
metreleptin and patients weighing >40 kg, the recommended daily dose was 2.5 mg for males and 
5.0 mg for females. Metreleptin was to be administered once daily (QD) following this amendment. 
Based on clinical response (e.g., inadequate metabolic control or excessive weight loss or tolerability 
issues),  metreleptin  dose may  have  been  adjusted  in  increments  or  decrements  of  0.02  mg/kg  for 
patients ≤40 kg and 1.25 to 2.5 mg for patients >40 kg.  
This study is enrolled a total of 41 patients. As the initial purpose of this treatment IND study was 
descriptive, no statistical inferences were planned.  
Nine (9) of the 41 patients had GL and 32 had PL. Among the GL patients, 2 had CGL, 6 had AGL, 
and for 1 patient the type of GL was  not reported. Most patients with PL had the familial form (29 
patients); 3 patients had APL. 
Among the 9 patients with GL included in the FAS, mean HbA1c was reduced from 7.7% at baseline 
(n=9)  to  6.2%  at  Month  12/LOCF  (n=5),  a  mean  change  across  patients  of  -1.2%.  In  addition, 
metreleptin  treatment  led  to  improvements  in  mean  fasting  triglyceride  concentrations  in  patients 
with GL. Mean fasting triglyceride concentrations were reduced from 19.9 mmol/L at baseline (n=8) 
to 7.6 mmol/L at Month 12/LOCF (n=6), corresponding to a mean percent change across patients of 
-26.9%. 
Among the 7 patients in the PL subgroup included in the FAS, mean HbA1c was reduced from 7.8% 
at  baseline  (n=7)  to  7.0%  at  Month  12/LOCF  (n=7),  a  mean  change  of  -0.8%.  Mean  triglyceride 
concentrations were lower in this group of patients compared to those with GL. In the PL subgroup, 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 85/136 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mean triglyceride concentrations were reduced from 4.0 mmol/L at baseline (n=7) to 3.6 mmol/L at 
Month 12/LOCF (n=7), a mean change of -8.5%. 
Although reductions were observed for both HbA1c and triglycerides to Month 12/LOCF in both the 
overall GL group and the PL subgroup, none of the changes reached statistical significance. 
Analyses  that  assessed  target  reductions  in  HbA1c  and  triglycerides  also  showed  that  patients 
derived benefit from treatment with metreleptin. Overall, 3 (50%) of 6 patients in the FAS with GL 
had  a  ≥1%  actual  decrease  in  HbA1c  or  a  ≥30%  decrease  in  triglycerides  at  Month  12/LOCF  with 
the  same  number  achieving  the  highest  target  decreases  of  ≥2%  in  HbA1c  or  a  ≥40%  in 
triglycerides at that time. In the PL subgroup for the FAS, 2 (29%) of the 7 patients achieved a ≥1% 
actual  decrease  in  HbA1c  or  a  ≥30%  decrease  in  triglycerides  at  Month  12/LOCF  with  1  patient 
(14%) achieving the highest target decreases of ≥2% in HbA1c or ≥40% in triglycerides. 
Reductions were observed in transaminase levels during metreleptin treatment. Mean change in ALT 
in the GL group from baseline to Month 12/LOCF was -191.5 U/L and in AST was -104.1 U/L. In the 
PL subgroup, who had lower baseline levels of ALT and AST, mean changes to Month 12/LOCF were 
-5.1 U/L and -0.3 U/L, respectively. 
In this study serum leptin levels were not set among entry criteria (declared to be below 12ng/mL), 
and were measured during the study. In GL patients, mean and median increases from baseline in 
leptin  concentrations  at  Month  3  (n=3)  were  0.1  ng/mL  and  0  ng/mL,  respectively,  at  Month  6 
(n=2) were 56.5 ng/mL and 56.5 ng/mL, respectively; and at Month 12 (n=3) were 59.2 ng/mL and 
1.0 ng/mL, respectively.  
In  the  PL  subgroup,  mean  and  median  increases  from  baseline in  leptin  concentrations  at  Month  3 
(n=4)  were  103.1  ng/mL  and  94.9  ng/mL,  respectively,  at  Month  6  (n=4)  were  502.8  ng/mL  and 
320.4  ng/mL,  respectively,  and  at  Month  12  (n=4)  were  650.5  ng/mL  and  144.6  ng/mL, 
respectively. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study NIH 991265/20010769 and Study FHA101 were designed as open-label single-arm studies. 
Given the rarity of the disease and the lack of therapeutic options specific for the treatment of LD, 
the single-arm, open-label design was considered appropriate. Utilising a placebo control in this 
patient population at risk for serious, life-threatening metabolic complications after marked 
improvements with metreleptin were demonstrated in the initial pilot study was considered not 
justifiable based on ethical considerations. In addition, the studies’ efficacy endpoints are objective 
measurements, including HbA1c, triglycerides and plasma glucose levels, and thus treatment effects 
can be appropriately evaluated with a single-arm (baseline-controlled, within patient) design.  
In  these  studies  there  was  a  possibility  to  increase  or  decrease  the  dose  based  on  inadequate 
control of metabolic parameters or tolerability issues / intolerable weight loss. Because of the wide 
range of variation in the clinical presentation of patients, it was not possible to define predetermined 
thresholds of metabolic parameters that would appropriately guide dose modifications. Best clinical 
judgment was used to make dose modifications based on the constellation of metabolic and clinical 
data available for each patient.  
In  accordance  with  the  practice  in  the  clinical  development  programme,  the  product  information 
stipulates that based on clinical response (e.g. inadequate metabolic control) or other consideration 
(e.g.  tolerability  issues,  excessive  weight  loss  especially  in  paediatric  patients),  the  dose  may  be 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 86/136 
 
 
 
decreased,  or  increased  to  the  maximum  dose  of  0.13  mg/kg  in  patients  weighing  ≤40  kg  and  10 
mg for those weighing > 40kg. A minimum clinical response is defined as at least: 
• 0.5% HbA1c reduction and/or 25% reduction in insulin requirements 
and / or 
• 15% reduction in triglycerides (TGs) 
If  clinical  response  is  not  seen  after  6  months  of  treatment  the  physician  should  ensure  that  the 
patient is compliant with the administration technique, is receiving the correct dose and is adherent 
to diet. Consider dose increase before stopping treatment. 
Metreleptin  dose  increases  in  adults  and  children  based  on  incomplete  clinical  response  can  be 
considered  after  a  minimum  of  6  months  of  treatment,  allowing  for  lowering  concomitant  insulin, 
oral anti-diabetic and/or lipid lowering medication. 
As  an  analogue  of  leptin,  it  was  anticipated  that  metreleptin  would  improve  the  metabolic 
abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency in patients with lipodystrophy, i.e., reduce HbA1c and 
triglycerides. In view of the role these metabolic abnormalities have in the morbidity and mortality 
associated with LD and given the expected effect of metreleptin, changes in HbA1c and triglycerides 
were  the  co-primary  efficacy  variables.  This  is  consistent  with  the  Guideline  on  Clinical  Trials  in 
Small  Populations  (CHMP/EWP/83561/2005),  that  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  is  a  surrogate 
endpoint that is clinically relevant to the patient and the progression of disease. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Analysis  of  the  results  at  12  months  after  initiation  of  treatment  was  considered  appropriate  as 
metreleptin  is  intended  to  treat  a  chronic  disease;  this  time  period  would  allow  for  individual  dose 
titration to achieve maximum effect in a given patient and an acceptable time frame over which to 
assess  the  clinical  impact  of  the  treatment.  In  order  to  account  for  patients  who  may  have 
discontinued treatment prior to that time and to account for differences in the availability of patients 
to  attend  study  centre  visits  due  to  significant  travel  (i.e.,  for  patients  outside  the  country),  LOCF 
methods  were  used  for  determination  of  changes  from  baseline  to  Month  12.  Specifically,  samples 
for HbA1c and triglycerides obtained on or after Day 180 were used in the analysis for patients who 
did not have samples obtained within the Month 12 window (Day 365 ±65 days).  
The  primary  efficacy  analyses  were  conducted  on  the  FAS  defined  as  all  patients  who  received  at 
least 1  dose  of  study  drug  and  who  had  either  primary  efficacy  parameter  of  interest  measured  at 
baseline  and  at  least  one  post-baseline  visit.  Use  of  this  analysis  set  for  changes  from  baseline  in 
HbA1c  and  triglycerides  in  this  population  is  considered  conservative,  given  that  not  all  patients 
would be expected to have abnormal HbA1c and triglyceride levels at baseline (and therefore would 
not be expected to have significant reductions observed). 
The  applicant  defined  a  sub-group  of  patients  with  PL  for  analysis  who  appear  to  have  clinically 
similar  metabolic  disturbances  as  patients  with  GL  and  who  could  equally  benefit  from  metreleptin 
treatment.  This  subset  included  patients  with  baseline  HbA1c  ≥6.5%  and/or  triglycerides  ≥500 
mg/dL.  
Clinically  meaningful  and  statistically  significant 
improvements 
in  HbA1c  consistent  with 
improvement in insulin sensitivity were seen:  
In  Study  NIH  991265/20010769,  mean  actual  change  in  HbA1c  to  Month  12/LOCF  was  -2.2% 
(p<0.001) for GL patients and -0.9% (p<0.001) for patients in the PL subgroup.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 87/136 
 
 
 
In Study FHA101, mean actual change from baseline to Month 12/LOCF for HbA1c was -1.2% for GL 
patients and -0.8% for patients in the PL subgroup.  
Furthermore, clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in hypertriglyceridaemia 
were also reported:  
In  Study  NIH  991265/20010769,  mean  percent  change  in  triglycerides  to  Month  12/LOCF  was  -
32.1%  (p=0.001)  for  the  GL  group  and  -37.4%  (p<0.001)  in  the  PL  subgroup  excluding  the  1 
outlying noncompliant patient.  
In  Study  FHA101,  mean  percent  change  from  baseline  to  Month  12/LOCF  for  triglycerides  was 
similar  in  the  GL  group  as  -26.9%;  however,  for  the  PL  subgroup,  the  mean  percent  change  was 
lower  at  -8.5%  likely  related  to  a  much  lower  baseline  triglyceride  level  in  this  group  of  patients. 
Importantly, 5 of the 7 patients in the PL subgroup in this study showed reductions from baseline to 
Month 12/LOCF in triglycerides ranging from -5.7% to -52.3%.  
Reductions in HbA1c and triglycerides were sustained over long-term treatment in patients with GL 
and in the PL subgroup. Most patients received 2 or more years of therapy with a maximum duration 
of  14  years;  total  patient-years  of  exposure  across  the  LD  studies  was  >500  years.  Based  on  the 
results  of  the  MMRM  analysis,  which  takes  into  account  changes  over  all  visits,  statistically 
significant reductions from baseline were observed in both HbA1c and triglycerides in patients with 
GL  and  in  the  PL  subgroup  in  Study  NIH  991265/20010769.  Results  for  the  MMRM  analysis  were 
directionally consistent but not statistically significant in Study FHA101.  
Target responses of ≥1% in HbA1c and/or ≥30% in triglycerides were observed in patients with GL 
and in the PL subgroup.  
In Study NIH 991265/20010769, nearly 80% of GL patients and 68% of patients in the PL subgroup 
had  a  ≥1%  actual  decrease  in  HbA1c  or  a  ≥30%  decrease  in  triglycerides  at  Month  12/LOCF  with 
66% and 43%, respectively, achieving the highest target decreases of ≥2% in HbA1c or a ≥40% in 
triglycerides.  
Patients in the supportive study also achieved these target decreases with 3 of 6 GL patients and 2 
of  7  patients  in  the  PL  subgroup  having  a  ≥1%  actual  decrease  in  HbA1c  or  a  ≥30%  decrease  in 
triglycerides at Month 12/LOCF.  
No robust conclusions could be drawn with regards to the levels of baseline HbA1c and triglycerides 
used  to  define  the  PL  sub-group  in  need  of  treatment  with  metreleptin.  The  applicant-proposed  a 
cut-off  level  for  HbA1c  of  6.5%,  in  which  a  greater  reduction  in  HbA1c  was  seen  in  patients 
compared to the overall group of patients with PL. Further subgroup analyses by baseline metabolic 
abnormalities  showed  that  a  meaningful  difference  in  efficacy  results  was  related  to  the  patient’s 
baseline level of HbA1c or triglycerides. Patients with more abnormal results had greater decreases 
from baseline in these parameters.  
However,  due  to  the  very  low  number  of  analysed  patients  the  CHMP  considered  that  in  this  rare 
condition,  patients  should  be  treated  with  metreleptin  if  adequate  metabolic  control  had  not  been 
achieved  by  standard  treatments.  At  the  same  time  it  was  acknowledged  that  stipulating  strict 
thresholds  on  metabolic  parameters  would  not  be  the  best  way  to  define  the  target  population 
especially since the limited dataset available, does not allow determining these with any precision. 
Study NIH 991265/20010769 also included specific eligibility criteria for leptin levels (<12 ng/mL for 
females  and  <8  ng/mL  for  males  >5  years).  In  study  FHA10,  the  PL  sub-group  definition  required 
patients  to  have  leptin  levels  <12  ng/mL.  Based  on  these  inclusion  criteria  the  initially  applied 
indication  in  partial  lipodystrophy,  was  proposed  to  be  restricted  to  patients  with  leptin  levels  <12 
ng/ml. The Multi-Society Practice Guideline (MPSG, Brown, 2016 J Clin Endocrinol Metab) considers 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 88/136 
 
 
 
that  metreleptin  may  be  considered  in  severely  hypoleptinaemic  patients  with  leptin  levels  <4 
ng/mL.  
The CHMP noted that 2 of the 3 studies upon which the MPSG guidelines are based upon, conclude 
that changes in, HbA1c and triglycerides were not significantly related to baseline leptin levels 
(Vatier 2015 and Simha 2012). Only the third study, Diker-Cohen (2015), concluded that 
metreleptin was effective in all PL subgroups except those with baseline triglycerides 500 mg/dL, 
HbA1c 8% or endogenous leptin 4 ng/mL. In addition, sub-group analyses conducted by the 
applicant did not demonstrate statistical significant differences between patients with different 
baseline leptin levels in the reduction in HbA1c or in the levels of triglycerides. Patients in the 4-12 
ng/ml range achieved an even slightly better improvement of their HbA1C and TG values in both the 
MSPG and the Applicant defined groups, although no robust conclusions can be made due to the low 
numbers in the analysed subsets. Based on the above and the fact that endogenous leptin levels in 
PL patients are known to be age and gender dependant the CHMP concluded that use of metreleptin 
in PL should not be determined by baseline leptin levels.  
Therefore the CHMP considered that the appropriate target population for treatment with 
metreleptin in patients with partial LD was confirmed familial partial LD or acquired partial LD 
(Barraquer-Simons syndrome), for whom standard treatments have failed to achieve adequate 
metabolic control. 
Results on primary endpoints were less pronounced in children < 6 years, which could be due to the 
low metabolic baseline values in these patients as HbA1c values were in the normal range patents 
<6 years (5.7%) and lower in patients ≥6 to <12 years (6.4%) compared to the older age groups 
(9.7% and 9.1%). Mean decreases from baseline to month 12/LOCF in triglycerides for the GL group 
were noted in all age groups with larger mean changes observed in the 2 older age groups (-42.9% 
and -35.3%) compared to the younger age groups (-10.5% and -14.1%). This consistent trend in 
these parameters is in accordance with what is known about the natural history of GL whereby the 
severity of disease in inadequately treated GL patients worsens over time. Therefore and despite the 
small treatment effect of metreleptin in these very children, the CHMP considered that the GL 
indication should include children 2 years of age and above as early treatment in these young 
patients could potential prevent or delay avoid onset of complications. 
Regarding the PL population, there are no data available for patients under 12 years, and only 5 
patients were analysed in the age group 12-18 years. This is possibly a consequence of the fact that 
PL diagnosis is normally established later. Given the complete lack of data but also the safety 
concerns over formation of antibodies against endogenous leptin, the CHMP considered that for the 
PL indication patients less than 12 years of age should be excluded. 
In common with other products of this type, there is a concern regarding the formation of 
neutralising ADA which in this case could potentially bind on metreleptin but also against 
endogenous leptin (especially in PL patients). Currently there is no method available which would 
allow for a distinction between the two.  
Sixteen (42.1%) of a total of 38 patients whom developed NABs did not achieve resolution of NAc 
while receiving metreleptin or in the follow-up period. In the PL group, 13 patients whom developed 
NAbs during the metreleptin therapy, and 6 of them saw resolution of the NAc during the treatment 
itself. Of the 13 patients with NAbs only 5 had no impact whatsoever on efficacy. In the GL group, 
15 of the 25 patients that developed NAbs had resolution of neutralising activity during treatment 
and in total 20 out of these 25 patients saw attenuation of efficacy. In the 10 GL patients that had 
no resolution of NAc, only four had unaffected efficacy.  
Generally, there were no clear differences between the patient subtypes regarding NAb impact on 
efficacy or resolution. Even though available data raise concerns about reversibility of NAb formation 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 89/136 
 
 
 
during metreleptin treatment it should be noted that no patient saw a total failure in efficacy, and it 
is expected that up-titration of the dose should be able to deal with any efficacy attenuation 
problems. Moreover, it should be noted that about half of the NAb seropositive subjects became 
seronegative again during treatment, and that as of today no total losses in efficacy have been 
noted. This coupled with the fact that 2 out of three Nab seropositive subjects that had data post-
treatment available also had resolution of their seropositive status suggests that any possible 
impact, on endogenous leptin activity is likely transient. 
The CHMP considered that currently there are not enough data to conclude on the reversibility of 
NAc after cessation of therapy and thus on any potential impact on endogenous leptin activity.  
The analysis is further complicated by the fact that with the new receptor binding assay, the 
majority of patients were reported as having some kind of blocking activity. Loss of efficacy, 
potentially due to Nabs is therefore included in the RMP. The applicant will employ an 
immunogenicity strategy to further test anti-drug antibodies in the future, which will help elucidate 
any potential clinical significant effects of antibody formation. This will include, a revalidation of the 
ADA binding assay, standardising the antibody used in the ADA Binding Assay and ECLIA Receptor 
Binding Assays and standardising the antibody used in the ADA Binding Assay and ECLIA Receptor 
Binding Assays and development of a Mass spectroscopy technique to differentiate endogenous 
leptin and metreleptin. These techniques will be used in a planned open label study in PL patients 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set on 
the clinical efficacy of Myalepta under normal conditions of use could not be considered 
comprehensive as due to the rarity of the studied conditions and heterogeneity of the patients 
included in the target population, active or placebo controlled studies of sufficient size are not 
feasible. Due to these limitations it is not possible to determine the effect of baseline levels of 
metabolic parameters on the treatment effect. 
In addition, due to technical limitations it is not possible to distinguish between the effect of anti-
drug antibody formation and antibodies against endogenous leptin which could impact the efficacy of 
the product.  
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
should be granted subject to a number of obligations, including a disease registry in order to 
evaluate the long-term effectiveness of treatment with Myalepta under conditions of routine clinical 
care.  
In addition, the results of an open label study will be submitted in order to provide further 
information on the effect of metreleptin in patients with PL on poor metabolic control once 
background therapy has been maximised. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A clear effect on HbA1c and triglyceride levels has been demonstrated for metreleptin from the data 
submitted in patients with GL and PL. Therefore, it was concluded that metreleptin is an effective 
treatment option for patients with congenital or acquired generalised lipodystrophy and familial or 
acquired partial lipodystrophy for whom standard treatments have failed to achieve adequate 
metabolic control.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 90/136 
 
 
 
 
However due to the small number of patients investigated and the lack of control, available data are 
not considered sufficient to fully characterise the magnitude of effect which can be affected by 
concomitant medications commonly used in these conditions . 
The CHMP thus considered that the available data set on the clinical efficacy was not comprehensive 
and that the following measures would be necessary to generate additional efficacy data in the 
context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances:  
• A lipodystrophy registry, to evaluate long term effectiveness of treatment with metreleptin 
• An open label study to further characterise the effect of metreleptin on poor metabolic control  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data in support of this application was from two trials in LD, one of which was initiated by a 
third party (the US NIH) and consisted of two distinct trials that were pooled and analysed as one. 
The  other  trial  was  a  smaller  complementary  sponsor  initiated  trial,  FHA101.  Both  of  these  trials 
were open-label, non-controlled PhII trials that included all major forms of LD (AGL, CGL, FPL, APL). 
A total of 148 patients were included in the safety analysis in the LD trials and 138 from the post-
marketing setting. 
A breakdown of the types of patients in each LD study is provided in table 40.

For  the  safety  analysis  the  outcomes  were  not  pooled  due  to  differences  in  study  design  and 
population makeup. The exception to this was the analysis of immunogenic events, as differences in 
immunogenic potential were considered unlikely between populations. 
Additionally, supportive safety data was extracted from 5 PhII trials in obese patients (two of which 
recruited  explicitly  diabetic  patients)  which  were  all  placebo-controlled.  Though  the  indication,  trial 
design and patient morbidity are wildly different from the LD trials, the placebo-controlled nature of 
the  trials  can  be  considered  to  have  some  informative  value  on  possible  treatment  relatedness  of 
events noted in the LD trials.

The 5 analysed obesity studies included a total of 632 patients whom received metreleptin at least 
once,  and  236  patients  on  placebo  treatment.  Of  these  868  patients  296  were  subjects  suffering 
from type 2 diabetes. Of the 632 metreleptin patients 199 were on a dose of 10 mg, and 433 were 
on a dose of 20 mg. 
Across all of the 7 trials mentioned above 1476 patients have been given metre leptin at least once, 
and of those 1113 received metreleptin at least once in monotherapy. 
In the NIH study the total amount of exposure in patient years for GL patients was 328.3 years with 
a mean overall exposure duration of 62.5 months and a mean daily dose of 5.0 mg/day. In the PL 
subgroup  and  overall  PL  group  this  was  121.3  and  162  years  respectively  with  respective  mean 
overall exposure durations of 47.5 and 48.1 months with mean daily doses of 8.4 mg/day (high dose 
mainly driven by subgroup patients), again respectively. 
In  the  FHA101  study  the  total  exposure  in  patient  years  was  11.3  for  GL  patients  and  61.9  for  PL 
patients (28.4 in the subgroup). This correlated with mean average daily doses of 3.1, 7.6 and 8.9 
respectively (due to the relative lower number of subgroup patients versus the overall number of PL 
patients the dose in the latter group was less driven by the former). The mean overall durations of 
exposure on a patient level were 25.9, 27.8 and 49.4 months respectively. 
In  the  obesity  studies  the  median  duration  of  exposure  to  metreleptin  was  12.4  weeks  and  to 
placebo  16.0  weeks  (with  a  maximum  of  40  weeks  40  weeks).  Median  duration  of  exposure  was 
somewhat higher in the obesity studies in subjects with Type 2 diabetes (16.1 and 16.0 weeks in the 
metreleptin  and  placebo  groups,  respectively)  compared  to  the  obesity  studies  in  subjects  without 
diabetes (12.0 and 14.1, respectively).  
Most subjects in the Obesity Studies Pool, including 421 (54%) of 784 who received metreleptin and 
had  exposure  data  available  and  220  (63%)  of  351  who  received  placebo,  were  exposed  to  study 
treatment for >12 weeks with ~20% of subjects in both groups receiving treatment for >24 weeks. 
There  was  no  apparent  difference  in  duration  of exposure  to  metreleptin  for  subjects  who  received 
10 mg or 20 mg in either group of studies (with or without diabetes).

Note: Of the 776 unique obese subjects, 63 received metreleptin followed by randomisation to placebo

the corresponding treatment period. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
A high proportion of patients in the LD studies reported SAEs (35% NIH-GL, 23% NIH-PLsbg, 30% 
NIH-PL, 67% FHA-GL, 0% FHA-PLsbg, 40% FHA-PL), but only few events were reported in more 
than one person, including abdominal pain and pancreatitis, pneumonia, sepsis, worsening 
underlying liver disease and cardiac failure in the NIH study and liver test elevated and 
hypoglycaemia in the FHA101 study. 
In the NIH study only 3 SEAs, all in the GL patients, were considered as drug-related. It concerned 
cases of hypertension, respiratory distress and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) in one patient 
each. Of special interest was the ALCL case, given that T-cell lymphomas are AEs of special 
consideration, in which the patient developed ALCL 10 months after having been found positive for 
NAbs. Treatment was interrupted for 6 months, the neoplasm was excised, treatment was restarted 
and the patient remained neoplasm free for the rest of her study participation duration.  
In the FHA101 study the only treatment-related TESAEs that affected more than one patient and 
was considered drug-related occurred in the non-subgroup PL patients, namely hypoglycaemia ad 
rata of 8%. Hypoglycaemic potential is a known and identified risk of metreleptin treatment and 
addressed in the SmPC. 
Over all 5 obesity studies a slightly higher incidence of SAEs was observed in the placebo group than 
in the metreleptin group. In total 2% of 784 subjects who received metreleptin and 4% of 351 
subjects who received placebo reported at least 1 SAE and no SAEs had an incidence of more than 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 96/136 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects. Treatment-related SAEs included injection site reaction and asthma in 1 subject who 
received metreleptin, chest pain and hypertension in 1 placebo subject and finally injection site 
reaction in 1 more placebo subject. 
Deaths 
Over both LD studies a total of 6 patients died, 4 patients with GL (3 in the NIH study and one in the 
FHA101 study), 1 patient in the PL subgroup the NIH study and 1 patient in the PL group (but not 
subgroup) of the FHA101 study. None were considered related to treatment as underlying 
comorbidities were far more likely to have played a role in the patients’ deaths. 
In the pooled supportive obesity studies there was one death, in which the subject developed 
lymphocytic leukaemia one month after initiation of metreleptin treatment. The death was 
considered unrelated to the study drug, tough only sparse information in this case are available. 
Hypersensitivity 
Three patients in the GL group experienced events marked as SAEs, with one patient having 
neutralising antibodies at the time of event, and another withdrawing and passing away after 
experiencing cardiac arrest which occurred as a likely consequence of pancreatitis and treatment-
unrelated septic shock. Two potential non-SAE events of severe severity were a case of dyspnoea 
and a case of asthma, the latter occurring in one of the three patients referenced above. 
In the PL subgroup no events were considered of severe intensity and no potential hypersensitivity 
events in the PL subgroup were SAEs not did any lead to treatment discontinuation. 
In study FHA101 2 GL patients experienced potential hypersensitivity, though neither was 
considered treatment related. 
Among the PL patients in this study 7 reported events, with 2 of them reporting unrelated SAEs 
(hypotension and dyspnoea). The latter patient with dyspnoea was also ADA positive at time of 
event. 
No events led to study discontinuation in study FHA101. 
In general events were generally low in number and mild, with very few leading to discontinuation 
and almost no events coincided with NAb positivity. 
In the supportive obesity studies the overall incidence of HS events was comparable in LD patients 
versus placebo treated subjects (16% vs 13%). In total 6% and 3% of metreleptin and placebo 
treated patients, respectively, experienced treatment related events, with urticaria being the most 
commonly reported in 2% of metreleptin subjects and <1% placebo subjects. Only one treatment-
related event was reported as an SAE; an episode of asthma in a metreleptin receiving patient. 
Hypersensitivity events leading to discontinuation, generally urticaria, affected 2% of metreleptin 
patients and 1% of placebo patients. Apart from urticarial and rash, which affected about 3 times 
the number of metreleptin patients compared to the placebo ones, all other reported HS events 
knew similar rates between both groups.

Hypoglycaemia 
In the NIH study all reports of hypoglycaemia events in patients with GL and in the PL subgroup 
were mild in severity with no pattern of onset relative to treatment start and no clinical sequelae, 
nor discontinuations. In the GL and PL subgroup populations 12% and 10% of subjects had mild 
events that were considered possibly treatment-related, and 75% of them could control the event 
by way of dietary measures instead of diabetic medications. 
In the FHA101 study there was a more outspoken imbalance between the GLA and PL subgroup 
patients with 22% and 43% of them having hypoglycaemic events respectively. The only events of 
severe intensity and that were labelled as SAEs occurred in the non-subgroup PL patients (3 cases of 
which 1 considered treatment-related). Nonetheless, none of the FHA101 subjects discontinued the 
study as all recovered from the events and continued receiving treatment. 
In the supportive obesity studies hypoglycaemia was only reported in diabetic patients, and saw 
incidence rates of 4% versus 1% in metreleptin and placebo treated patients respectively. Among 
obese subjects with diabetes, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was 15% in the metreleptin 10 mg 
group (9 of 61 subjects), 14% in the metreleptin 20 mg group (19 of 135 subjects), and 5% in the 
placebo group (5 of 100 subjects). None of the reported events were considered SAEs and none led 
to study discontinuation. 
Neoplasms 
In the pooled NIH and FHA101 populations there were 17 patients whom experienced at least 1 
neoplasm TEAE. Of these 70.5% continued on treatment for more than one year and moved to 
commercial Myalepta or expanded access programs after completion of their trail participation. 
Of the 75 GL patients, 4 had events considered SEAs. Two patients discontinued treatment due to 
these SEAs, and 2 continued treatment after diagnosis. 
In the PL subgroup two cases were considered SAEs, and in the non-subgroup PL patients there was 
one incident of neoplasm, also counted as SAE. 
All malignancies were reported as not-related apart from one case of ALCL (described under SAEs). 
Apart from that case, there were also two more cases of T-cell L-lymphoma, but they were not 
considered related to metreleptin treatment given that severe co-morbidities (pre-existing 
lymphoma and/or bone marrow or haematologic abnormalities) were more likely to be the 
underlying cause of the neoplasm development. 
In the supportive obesity trials neoplasms were exceedingly rare, and there was no difference in 
occurrence rate between metreleptin and placebo groups (1% vs 1%), and no T-cell lymphomas nor 
treatment-related events were noted. 
Hepatic disorders 
Consistent with the nature of the disease the majority of patients had pre-existing abnormal liver 
parameters and diseases.  
In the NIH study 15% of GL patients and 7% of PL subgroup patients reported hepatic events, of 
which the majority were related to pre-existing hepatic conditions. 
Five of the events in the GL group were considered SAEs and one of these led to study 
discontinuation and subsequent death of the patient (chronic hepatic failure and hepatic 
encephalopathy). 
In the FHA101 study 22% of GL patients and 14% of PL subgroup patients reported mild to 
moderate liver function test increased and all but 1 were assessed as unrelated to study treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 98/136 
 
 
 
None of these events impacted study participation. The cases in the GL patients were considered 
SAEs, though both patients already had elevated liver function tests at study entry. 
No hepatic events were noted in the supportive obesity studies. 
Autoimmune disorders 
Autoimmune events occurred only in 7 NIH GL subjects, and of these only 1 did not have pre-
existing underlying autoimmune disorders, though this patient had sever hepatic disease at study 
entry. 
Reported autoimmune events were: 3 reports of autoimmune hepatitis, 2 reports each of MPGN and 
FSG, and 1 report of autoimmune thyroiditis. All autoimmune disorders were non-serious and 
assessed as unrelated to study treatment. 
There were no autoimmune disorders reported for obesity studies, nor statement about their lack 
included into the documentation. 
Serious Infections 
In the NIH study about 9% of patients with GL or subgroup type PL had serious infections during 
metreleptin treatment, mainly sepsis/bacteraemia, pneumonia, and cellulitis. 
In the GL patients of the NIH study, 11% of 66 persons developed serious infections, with only 
pneumonia and sepsis being reported in more than 1 person (each in 2 persons). In the PL subgroup 
serious infections occurred in 7% of the 31 patients, with 1 patient developing cellulitis, 
streptococcal infection, and pharyngitis, while the other experienced osteomyelitis and cellulitis. All 
serious infections were assessed as unrelated to study treatment, and none led to study 
discontinuation. 
In the FHA101 study no serious infections were reported for neither GL nor PL subgroup patients. In 
non-subgroup PL patients 3 out of 25 experienced serious infections: gastroenteritis, cellulitis, 
infectious colitis, urinary tract infection and urosepsis. All events were considered unrelated to study 
treatment and there were no event-related discontinuations either. 
Serious infections were reported in less than 1 percent of metreleptin or placebo subjects in the 
supportive obesity studies. All were SAEs by default as per protocol, though none were related to 
study treatment. Two metreleptin patients and one placebo patient discontinued treatment due to 
events of serious infection. 
Pancreatitis 
One of the primary metabolic abnormalities in patients with LD is severe hypertriglyceridaemia, 
which can result in life-threatening bouts of acute pancreatitis. In the NIH study for example about 
31% of patients had prior medical history of pancreatitis.  
In both NIH and FHA101 studies combined 6 patients (4 GL, 1 subgroup PL and 1 non-subgroup PL) 
had treatment emergent pancreatitis, and one patient developed fatal septic shock. The other 5 
subjects all recovered from their episode(s) and continued treatment. 
One patient however experienced non-SAE pancreatitis during treatment withdrawal (for other 
reasons), and this rebound pancreatitis is a known issue if treatment is stopped abruptly. Thus 
tapering off the metreleptin product is recommended and also adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
All 5 pancreatitis events were deemed by the investigator to be severe and unrelated to metreleptin. 
One patient in the GL group in Study FHA101 with a history of pancreatitis and extremely elevated 
triglycerides  at  study  entry  (119.9  mmol/L)  experienced  3  events  of  pancreatitis  or  acute 
Assessment report

Page 99/136 
 
 
 
pancreatitis  during  the  study;  all  events  were  reported  as  SAEs  unrelated  to  study  treatment. 
Pancreatitis was not reported in any patient in the PL group. 
In  obesity  data  pool,  one  subject,  Subject  970171-17-17022,  a  39  year-old  male  who  received 
metreleptin, developed pancreatitis on Study Day 90. The event, which was reported as an SAE and 
led to treatment withdrawal, was assessed as unrelated to study treatment by the Investigator. The 
event was reported as resolved 4 days after onset. No other subjects reported pancreatitis. 
Time courses of serum TG levels for several of these patients were not available even in CSRs. 
In the supportive obesity studies only one event occurred in a metreleptin treated patient, which led 
to the subject’s withdrawal from the study. It was considered unrelated to treatment and safely 
resolved 4 days after first occurrence. 
Injection site reactions 
In the NIH study only 6% and 7% of GL and Pl subgroup patients respectively reported non-serious 
moderate intensity events, mainly injection site pain, of which none led to treatment withdrawal. 
Higher number of patients (44% GL, 57% PL subgroup) reported events in the FHA101 study, but 
here too none were considered serious. About half of the events occurred in the first month of 
treatment, suggesting there is a large habituation effect, and none led to treatment withdrawal. 
Injection site reactions were the most commonly reported TEAEs in the supportive obesity trials, 
occurring in 82% of all metreleptin patients and 54% of all placebo patients. These reactions were 
more common in metreleptin subjects without diabetes (85%) compared to those with diabetes 
(73%) with higher incidence in both groups reported at the 20 mg metreleptin dose level: 88% vs 
79% in subjects with diabetes and 75% vs 67% in subjects without diabetes. 
In about 77% and 37% of metreleptin and placebo treated subjects, respectively, these events were 
considered treatment related, and one patient in each group had an ISR that was considered an 
SAE. 
In total 6% of metreleptin patients had an ISR that led to discontinuation, whereas this number was 
less than 1% in placebo patients. 
Pregnancy  
There have been 27 reports of metreleptin exposure during pregnancy. One report was from post 
marketing and the remaining 26 were from clinical studies/Investigator Initiated Studies/Expanded 
Access Programme. Fourteen of these pregnancies resulted in either spontaneous 
abortion/abortion/stillbirth or other fatal foetal outcome. It is however uncertain if the fatal foetal 
outcomes were due to the underlying disease of LD rather than the effect of metreleptin. 
In the LD studies 4 NIH GL patients became pregnant, with two patients reporting multiple 
pregnancies, leading to a total of 6 incidences. Three of these patients had the pregnancies recorded 
as AE. 
Two of the eight pregnancies resulted in live births, and both infants were seemingly healthy at the 
last time of check-up during the study. Both children were also breastfed during the mother’s study 
participation, seemingly without any harmful effects. Spontaneous abortions were reported in 2 
patients, one of which went on to give life birth subsequently, and 1 patients had 2 pregnancies that 
ended in foetal death and still birth. All foetal adverse events were considered not related to 
treatment, given the known association between problematic pregnancy and the LD comorbidities. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 100/136 
 
 
 
 
 
In the supportive obesity studies one patient on metreleptin became pregnant and withdrew from 
the study. The pregnancy was subsequently terminated, but no reason or follow-up were provided. 
Immunological events 
Antibodies were assessed using two different methods, chemiluminescence bridging assay and 
functional cell-based neutralising antibody assay, and only patients that had data from both assays

level <12.0 ng/mL (latter only for Study FHA101). 
Of the 41 GL ADA positive patients 68% had congenital form GL. In the congenital patients, 36 
(88%) of 41 were positive for ADAs, and 7 (17%) developed neutralising activity. 
In the NIH study ADA titres were taken for 29 GL patients and 5 patients of the PL subgroup. In the 
former 62% of patients had titres of 125 or less, with median time to peak around 9 months, and 
the 2 highest titres measured were 3000 to 50000 time more high. In the Pl subgroup 80% of 
subjects had titres of 125 or less, and one peak titre reached 5 times this amount. Median time to 
peak titre was 5.7 months. 
In study FHA101, the 2 GL ADA-positive patients had peak titres of 125 and 3125, with a median 
time to peak of 5.3 months In the PL subgroup, 2 of the 7 ADA-positive subjects had peak titres of 
625, 4 had peak titres of 3125, and 1 had a peak titre of 15,625. Median time to peak titre in this 
group was 7.1 months. 
Of the 33 PL patients for whom ADA data was available 91% had the familial form, and 9% the 
acquired. Overall 88% (n=29) of PL patients had ADAs and 6% (n=2) developed neutralising ABs. 
In this overall group 15 patients belonged to the PL subgroup (7 from the FHA study and 8 from the 
NIH study), and of these 80% (n=12) had ADAs and 7% (n=1) had NAbs. 
Based on FDA request a third assay was developed and used to reanalyse all banked samples, giving 
slightly higher evaluable numbers Table 49.

Based on review of the data, 9 patients with GL and 4 patients in the PL subgroup had potential 
hypersensitivity events that occurred while the patient was positive for ADAs. 
For those PL patients who weren’t included in the PL subgroup, 6 reported hypersensitivity events 
concurrent with ADAs, but the only events of severe intensity were dyspnoea/flushing/asthma in 1 
GL patient, urticaria in another GL patient; and dyspnoea in 1 PL subject who was not part of the PL 
subgroup. 
Two GL patients had concurrent autoimmune disorders during their ADA positive status. One 
presented with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and the other had neutralising antibodies 
at the same time as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was diagnosed. 
Three patients with GL and 1 patient in the PL subgroup were positive for ADAs when they were 
reported with severe infection. This included 3 GL patients of which 2 had sepsis (though the 
significant comorbidities may have been rather to blame) and 1 had appendicitis. The PL subgroup 
Assessment report

patients had a serious infection with streptococcal pharyngitis. In the non-subgroup PL patients 
there were 4 ADA-positive patients with serious infections. 
In  the  results  obtained  through  the  new  receptor  based  analysis  it  does  not  appear  that  there  are 
any  significant  differences  between  neutralising  positive  and  neutralising  negative  groups  for  the 
PL/PL  subgroup  patients  (data  not  shown).  However,  in  the  GL  patients  there  seems  to  be  a  clear 
trend towards more treatment emergent incidences in the Nac positive population (96% Vs 80.8). 
Analysis of Infections in Lipodystrophy Patients (receptor binding assay set) 
In  order  to  better  characterise  any  potential  association  of  NAbs  and  infection  the  Applicant  ran  a 
number of reviews on the data. One such review aimed to determine the full nature and extent of all 
temporally associated infections among the 38 NAb positive patients, and this revealed a total of 34 
temporally related adverse events (AEs) of infection in 16 patients. Of these only 13 were severe, 7 
of which occurred in the same patient, and 12 of the severe cases were also labelled as an SAE. 
In the GL group 5 patients were stricken by serious or severe events associated with NAc, including 
1 episode of serious and severe appendicitis, 2 episodes of serious and severe pneumonia, a single 
episode of serious and severe sepsis and non-serious severe gingivitis in 1 patient, and 6 episodes 
of serious and severe sepsis or bacteraemia and 1 episode of non-serious severe ear infection in 1 
patient. 
In  the  PL  subjects  One  serious  and  severe  infection  of  appendicitis  was  temporally  associated  with 
NAc  in  an  non-subgroup  subject,  whereas  no  NAc  associated  events  occurred  in  the  PL  subgroup 
patients. None of these events were considered related to treatment by investigators and all events 
resolved without sequelae. 
Analysis of neoplasms in Lipodystrophy Patients (receptor binding assay set) 
Neoplasms  were  reported  in  14  of  the  102  patients  with  antibody  data  for  analysis,  including  8 
(15%) of 53 patients with GL and 6 (12%) of 49 patients with PL, including 5 (17%) of 29 patients 
in  the  PL  subgroup.  Of  these  patients  seven  were  ADA  positive/neutralising  positive  at  some  time 
during the study (not necessarily at the time of the reported event). 
A  total  of  5  events  in  4  patients  who  were  ADA  positive/neutralising  positive  and  4  events  in  4 
patients who were neutralising negative were assessed as benign. Contrarily, 7 patients, including 6 
with  GL  and  1  with  PL  who  was  not  in  the  PL  subgroup  reported  malignant  neoplasms  during 
treatment  with  metreleptin,  including  intraductal  proliferative  breast  lesion,  peripheral  T-cell 
lymphoma,  basal  cell  carcinoma,  ovarian  neoplasm,  papillary  thyroid  cancer,  anaplastic  large-cell 
lymphoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the eyelid. 
Of the 7 patients with malignant carcinomas only 3 patients, all GL, developed NAc. Of these 3 latter 
subjects 2 were NAb negative at the time of the reported malignancy, whereas the remaining ALCL, 
had NAc at the time of the reported malignancy. This latter patient had treatment suspended for 6 
weeks  but  had  to  return  to  treatment  after  6  weeks  due  to  recurrence  of  metabolic  abnormalities 
associated with her underlying LD. Her malignancy was cured, and after the restart of treatment she 
remained on metreleptin, completed the study and was started on commercial product. 
Clinical impact analysis following reanalysis using new receptor-based assay 
A  medical  review  was  conducted  to  assess  both  the  potential  and  actual  clinical  impact  for  the  19 
patients  with  attenuated/worsening  efficacy  and  NAc,  using  a  scale  of  1  to  5  (1  being  minimal 
impact  and  5  being  severe  impact).  This  analysis  took  into  consideration  all  AEs  temporally 
associated with NAc, with special consideration and higher scoring for AEs that were serious, severe, 
related or OSAEs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 106/136 
 
 
 
Of the 19 patients, 6 had PL and 2 of those were part of the PL subgroup. The mean actual impact 
score  for  GL  patients  was  2.4,  and  for  PL  patients  was  1.5.  The  2  PL  subgroup  patients  had 
favourable clinical courses, with actual impact scores of 1 and 2. Mean actual impact scores did not 
differ  between  patients  with  transiently  and  persistently  affected  efficacy  parameters  (2.2  vs  2.0 
respectively). 
Of  note  is  the  fact  that  one  of  the  most  significant  comorbidities  associated  with  poor  metabolic 
control  in  lipodystrophic  patients,  i.e.,  acute  pancreatitis,  was  not  seen  temporally  associated  with 
NAc in any of these 19 patients with attenuated or worsened efficacy, despite extremely high levels 
of triglycerides. 
The  highest  actual  clinical  impact  scores  of  5  were  allocated  to  3  GL  patients  who  experienced 
multiple SAEs temporally associated with NAc, including serious and severe sepsis. Two GL patients 
with  an  actual  impact  score  of  3  experienced  unrelated  severe  SAEs  of  pneumonia.  Two  patients, 
one  GL  patient  and  one  PL  patient  not  in  the  PL  subgroup  developed  serious  and  severe  AEs  of 
appendicitis with an impact score of 2. 
One  specific  concern  in  PL  patients  with  residual  leptin  levels  who  develop  a  neutralising  ADA 
response  and  who  also  report  a  loss  of  clinical  efficacy  is  that  the  NAb  will  cause  clearing  of 
metreleptin  and  endogenous  leptin  from  the  body  leaving  the  patient  more  compromised  than  at 
baseline. 
Overall,  13  PL  patients  developed  NAc  across  both  main  studies,  and  of  these  6  patients  (46.2%) 
had  apparent  attenuation  or  worsening  of  efficacy  at  the  time  they  developed  NAc,  including  2 
(33%)  of  6  patients  in  the  PL  subgroup,  compared  to  17  patients  with  efficacy  loss  that  did  not 
develop a NAc. Other than 2 serious events (including one of appendicitis and one of dyspnoea, both 
severe  and  unrelated  to  metreleptin  treatment),  AEs  were  generally  mild  to  moderate  in  severity 
and not related, or not temporally associated with the development of NAc. 
Supportive obesity studies 
In the 5 supportive PhII obesity studies a total of 379 patients received metreleptin, and of those 
324 (85%) had at least one confirmed incidence of ADA positive status (as opposed to 5 (2%) of the 
247 placebo patients).  
A higher incidence of TEAEs was reported in subjects who had at least 1 positive ADA result (95%) 
compared to subjects who were ADA negative (86%) or who received placebo (86%). This 
difference was mainly due to the difference of injection site reaction rates: 87% of subjects with at 
least 1 post baseline ADA positive result experienced injection site reaction compared with 68% of 
subjects who ADA negative and with 54% subjects who received placebo. The only other common 
TEAE reported at a higher incidence in ADA positive subjects was nasopharyngitis (14%). 
Incidence of SAEs was 2% versus <1% and 4% respectively (ADA+, ADA-, Placebo, respectively). 
Injection site reaction was the only potentially immune-related TEAE experienced by 5% of subjects 
or more in any treatment group. Other potentially immune-related TEAEs reported in >1% of 
metreleptin subjects with positive ADAs (with corresponding incidence in subjects negative for 
ADAs) were cough (3% vs 4%), rash (3% vs 2%), peripheral oedema (2% each), urticaria (2% vs 
1%), and hypersensitivity (1% vs 0%). 
Laboratory findings 
Review  of  clinical  laboratory  data  across  patients  with  LD  in  the  NIH  study  and  Study  FHA101, 
including haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis (Study NIH 991265/2001769 only) did not 
reveal any safety signals for metreleptin treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 107/136 
 
 
 
In both studies small mean changes from baseline were noted at Months 12 and 24 for haematology 
parameters, including haemoglobin, WBC and platelet count with consistent mean values noted over 
time in both the GL group and the PL subgroup, with the former showing relatively larger changes. 
Electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, as well as renal function tests showed only 
small  mean  changes  from  baseline  to  Months  12  and  24  with  consistent  mean  values  noted  over 
time for both the GL group and PL subgroup in the NIH study. 
No clinically meaningful changes over time on metreleptin treatment in other parameters. 
Review  of  clinical  laboratory  data  across  subjects  in  the  supportive  obesity  studies  pool,  including 
haematology, chemistry, lipid parameters, thyroid function, and urinalysis did not reveal any safety 
signals for metreleptin treatment. 
Vital Signs 
LD  study  subjects  experienced  only  small  mean  changes  from  baseline  to  Months  12  and  24  in 
systolic/diastolic  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  and  generally  showed  improvement  over  time  on 
treatment in both patients with GL and in the PL subgroup. 
Both  studies  also  generally  noted  mean  decreases  in  weight  during  treatment  with  metreleptin  as 
shown in Table 51.

Overall 44% of paediatric patients in NIH study were reported to have had growth complete or near 
complete  prior  to  entry.  Among  the  remaining  20  paediatric  patients,  10  were  reported  to  have 
normal growth, 2 had growth acceleration and 8 had growth deceleration. The 2 patients in the PL 
subgroup  had  growth  complete  or  near  complete  at  study  entry  and  among  the  two  other  non-
subgroup PL patients one had growth deceleration reported during metreleptin treatment. 
Thirty-three  NIH  patients  younger  than  18  years  of  age  had  pubertal  status  assessed  at  baseline. 
Twenty-six  of  these  patients  had  puberty  complete,  near  complete,  or  likely  complete  prior  to 
metreleptin. Among the other 7 patients, all with GL, 4 had delayed puberty prior to metreleptin and 
3 had precocious puberty; follow-up was available for 3 of these patients, all with delayed puberty at 
entry: 2 had normal development on metreleptin and 1 continued to have delayed puberty. Among 
the  14  patients  without  baseline  data  reported  who  were  not  prepubertal  (normal  for  age),  13 
reported  normal  pubertal  onset  and/or  progression  on  metreleptin  at  a  post-baseline  assessment 
and 1 had delayed onset reported. 
Of the 36 NIH patients for whom Tanner Stage scoring was available at baseline and on treatment, 
12  had  completed  puberty  prior  to  metreleptin  treatment  and  3  patients  were  prepubertal 
throughout  the  study  (normal  for  their  age).  Among  the  remaining  21 patients,  14  underwent 
normal pubertal development, 2 had precocious puberty reported prior to the start of treatment with 
normal or slow progression on treatment, 3 patients had possible slow progression (including 1 with 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018

delayed development at the start and 1 with delayed development during treatment interruption), 1 
had slight precocious development during treatment, and 1 patient who was extremely ill had lack of 
pubertal progression. 
Sixteen  NIH  patients  were  assessed  for  bone  age  at  study  baseline  and  had  additionally  at  least  1 
post-baseline  assessment;  approximately  half  of  the  patients  had  bone  age  >2  years  higher  than 
their birth age at study entry; one patient had younger bone age. All 16 patients were reported as 
growing on metreleptin treatment. 
Review  of  vital  signs  data  in  the  supportive  obesity  studies  did  not  reveal  any  safety  signals  for 
metreleptin treatment.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies were submitted, but it is acknowledged that metreleptin has 
the potential to alter the formation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the NIH and FHA101 studies overall withdrawal rates due to TEAEAs were 6% and 10% of 
patients respectively. 
In the NIH study all TEAEs leading to withdrawal were considered not treatment-related and each 
type of TEAE only occurred in 1 patient each. Four of the six incidents had a fatal outcome. 
One patient with underlying liver disease withdrew due to increased blood triglycerides and 
inadequate control of diabetes mellitus. The patient was ADA negative at baseline, but tested 
positive after 6 months of treatment. At month 24 low level neutralising ab activity was detected 
and HbA1c and triglyceride levels were increasing from the Month 20 assessment levels. At Month 
42 levels had continued to rise and the patient was tapered off treatment. 
In the FHA101 study equal rates of GL and non-subgroup PL patients withdrew due to TEAEAs, 
though no PL subgroup discontinued treatment. All TEAEs leading to withdrawal occurred in at most 
1 patient each. 
One event was considered related to treatment. After approximately 8 months on treatment, the 
patient experienced muscle spasms, and treatment with metreleptin was held. The patient was 
discontinued from the study 6 months due to the AE of muscle spasms.  
Post marketing experience 
As of 24/07/2016, 138 patients (116 in the US and 22 in Japan) had been receiving commercial 
Myalepta or equivalent.  
Deaths 
Two cases of fatal outcome have been received, one of which was likely a complication of the 
patients underlying prior advanced liver cirrhosis, and who discontinued treatment with metreleptin 
somewhere within 4 to 6 weeks due to complications of the former. The other case died of unknown 
causes about one year and a month after metreleptin treatment initiation, but had suffered a 
possible stroke 4 months earlier. 
Given the timings and the underlying comorbidities it seems unlikely that metreleptin was a direct 
causal parameter in these patients’ deaths.

The most commonly reported attributable ICSRs (>5 reports) were weight decreased (14 cases, 
none serious), nausea (10 cases, 2 serious), blood glucose increased (8 cases, 3 serious), 
hyperphagia (7 cases, none serious), headache (7 cases, none serious), and blood triglycerides 
increased (6 cases, 2 serious). 
Identified safety concern: Hypersensitivity 
In total 24 cases were received, and amongst these anaphylactic reaction was reported twice in 1 
serious case with evidence of positive dechallenge and rechallenge. There were also 4 non-serious 
cases of urticaria of which only 1 was unresolved at reporting time, and finally there was 1 resolved 
non-serious case of generalised rash. 
Identified safety concern: Acute Pancreatitis 
In total 16 cases were reported upon, including 2 cases of pancreatitis (1 resolved and 1 unknown), 
1 of acute pancreatitis (resolved) and 1 case of relapsing pancreatitis (unknown). All cases were 
considered serious. No identification on the precise type was provided for the other 12 received 
reports. 
One case of pancreatitis was associated with treatment interruption/non-compliance, and one other 
case of pancreatitis as well as a case of acute pancreatitis led to patient hospitalisation.  
Identified safety concern: Hypoglycaemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin 
Secretagogues 
A total of 4 cases were received, seeing concomitant use of insulin in and concomitant use of 
metformin in 3 of them. In 2 cases the events were resolved, in 1 it was not resolved and in 1 case 
the status was unknown. 
In all of the cases retrieved, the analysis was non-conclusive as other confounding factors (medical 
history of diabetes and/or previous episodes of hypoglycaemia) were present. 
Identified safety concern: Lymphoma 
No cases received. 
Identified safety concern: Loss of Efficacy Due to Neutralising Activity 
There were 4 reports of NAb positivity received, including a case where therapeutic response 
decreased. In one of the cases, a positive de-challenge and re-challenge of anaphylaxis was 
reported and Metreleptin was permanently discontinued but there were no details regarding the loss 
of efficacy.  
The two other cases of confirmed NAb positivity involved two severely obese children of unknown 
sex and age receiving metreleptin for congenital leptin deficiency.  
Identified safety concern: Use in Elderly 
No new relevant information was identified.

Identified safety concern: Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Only 1 pregnancy report was received, detailing an abortion that involved a 33 year old female who 
was receiving fertility treatment. Information pertaining to last menstrual period and trimester of 
pregnancy outcome was not provided. It is also not clear whether this abortion was spontaneous or 
provoked. 
Use in renal impairment 
There have been a cumulative total of 3 reports, for a total of 54 AEs (of which 15 were serious). 
The most frequently reported AEs were nausea, blood glucose decreased, decreased appetite, 
fatigue and therapy cessation; all of these were non-serious. 
Reported SAEs included abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper, acute kidney injury, blood glucose 
increased, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycaemia, hyperkalaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, 
hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, metabolic encephalopathy, pancreatitis acute, pneumonia, 
staphylococcal infection and vomiting; all events were reported one time each. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  of  metreleptin was  assessed  in  2  LD  studies  that  recruited  all  4  forms  of  the  syndrome 
(CGL,  AGL,  FPL  and  APL),  supported  by  results  in  5  PhII  studies  that  had  aimed  to  investigate  the 
effectiveness of treating obesity with metreleptin. 
Across the 2 LD studies, a total of 148 patients were enrolled, including 75 patients with GL and 73 
patients with PL, of whom 38 were included in a subgroup of PL patients who have similar metabolic 
abnormalities  related  to  their  underlying  disease  as  patients  with  GL  and  were  thought  to  have 
similar  benefit  of  metreleptin  as  the  latter.  The  vast  majority  of  these  patients  were  treated  for  at 
least 1 year, and about half for more than three years even, given a total patient exposure of more 
than 500 patient years.  
The  majority  of  participating  GL  subjects  were  females,  younger  than  18  years  of  age,  and  about 
63% of GL patients had CGL. PL patients were generally older and almost exclusively female. Very 
few  patients  older  than  65  or  younger  than  6  years  were  included  in  these  studies.  Whilst  it  is 
acknowledged  that  elderly  LD  patients  are  relatively  rare,  as  elderly  patients  in  general  have  a 
markedly  different  safety  profile  form  young  people,  use  in  the  elderly  is  included  in  the  RMP  as 
missing information and further information in this population will be collected through the planned 
registry with lipodystrophy patients. 
The  majority  of  reported  events  that  were  considered  related  to  metreleptin  treatment  could  be 
expected  given  the  nature  of  the  investigative  product.  Some  of  the  more  serious  reported  events 
such  as  cardiac  arrest  or  liver  failure,  and  a  number  of  deaths,  are  more  likely  explained  by  the 
underlying syndrome comorbidities.  
A number of specific AEs were considered of special interest. 
Given  that  the  product  is  a  protein-analogue,  hypersensitivity  reactions  can  be  expected  following 
metreleptin  administration.  There  have  been  a  number  of  reports  of  generalised  hypersensitivity 
(e.g. anaphylaxis, urticaria or generalised rash) in patients using Myalepta. The product information 
includes  a  number  of  warnings  for  this  risk,  including  a  contraindication  for  those  with 
hypersensitivity to the active substance (or to any of the excipients), and that administration should 
be  permanently  discontinued  immediately  and  appropriate  therapy  initiated  if  an  anaphylactic 
reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 111/136 
 
 
 
As metreleptin improves insulin resistance, there is a potential for hypoglycaemia to occur if used in 
concurrence  with  antidiabetic  medications  is  possible  and  adjustment  of  antidiabetic  medications 
may be required. As hypoglycaemia occurred in several patients, this has been included in the RMP 
as  an  important  identified  risk.  A  warning  has  been  included  in  the  product  information  risk  of 
hypoglycaemia  in  patients  treated  with  Myalepta  who  are  on  anti-diabetic  medicinal  products,  in 
particular  insulin  or  insulin  secretagogues  (e.g.  sulphonylureas).  Large  dose  reductions  of  50%  or 
more of baseline insulin requirements may be needed in the first 2 weeks of treatment. Once insulin 
requirements have stabilised, dose adjustments of other anti-diabetics may also be needed in some 
patients  to  minimise  the  risk  of  hypoglycaemia.  Furthermore,  patients  should be  closely  monitored 
for  blood  glucose  in  patients  on  concomitant  insulin  therapy,  especially  those  on  high  doses,  or 
insulin secretagogues and combination treatment. Patients and carers should also be advised to be 
aware  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  hypoglycaemia.  In  case  of  hypoglycaemic  events  of  a  non-
severe nature, food intake management may be considered as an alternative to dose-adjustment of 
anti-diabetics  according  to  the  treating  physician’s  opinion,  in  line  with  the  management  of  these 
patients in the clinical trials. 
Another  event  of  particular 
interest  was,  acute  pancreatitis  as  a  consequence  of 
hypertriglyceridaemia  which  is  relatively  common  in  LD  patients.  In  the  conducted  studies  there 
have been a number of treatment-related bouts of pancreatitis, including one fatality. The reported 
events may have been linked to abrupt interruption and/or non-compliance with metreleptin dosing. 
The  mechanism  for  this  could  be  a  rapid  return  of  hypertriglyceridaemia.  The  risk  of  pancreatitis 
associated  with  discontinuation  of  treatment  has  also  been  included  in  the  RMP  as  an  important 
identified  risk  and  the  product  information  advised  that  patients  who  require  discontinuation  of 
metreleptin  should  be  tapered  off  treatment  over  a  period  of  two  weeks  and  should  not  stop 
metreleptin abruptly. 
T-cell  lymphoma  occurred  in  3  AGL  patients,  of  which  one  died.  Given  the  possible  autoimmune 
potential  of  metreleptin,  T-cell  lymphoma  is  an  event  of  interest.  However,  AGL  as  well  as  type  2 
diabetes,  are  risk  factors  for  lymphoma.  Reassuring in  this  regard is  the  fact  that  there  have  been 
no additional reports of T-cell lymphomas in the post-marketing setting as of July 2016. Nonetheless 
lymphomas are considered an important potential risk in the RMP and caution is advised for use of 
the  product  in  patients  with  significant  haematological  abnormalities  (including  leukopenia, 
neutropenia, bone marrow abnormalities, lymphoma, and/or lymphadenopathy). 
Immunogenicity  is  considered  a  major  point  of  interest  given  the  nature  of  the  product. 
Furthermore,  endogenous leptin  and  metreleptin  differ  by  only  one  amino  acid  which  could  lead  to 
the  additional  complication  that  ADAs,  and  more  worryingly  neutralising  antibodies,  to  metreleptin 
cross-react  with  endogenous  leptin.  Following  the  initial  evaluation  the  applicant  provided  data 
available  from  an  FDA-mandated  immunogenic  re-evaluation  of  available  samples  using  a  newly 
developed  receptor-based  assay.  Though  the  more  sensitive  assay  identified  more  ADA  and  Nab 
positive subjects, the clinical correlations were broadly in line with the findings in the less sensitive 
prior testing. 
Across  the  2  LD  studies,  over  eighty  percent  of  patients  for  whom  a  ADA  data  was  available 
developed an immunogenic response to metreleptin. For the majority of patients, the ADA response 
was a sustaining non-neutralising response of little or no clinical consequence. Given that the clinical 
course of patients with LD is very complicated, and that in any given patient, disease severity and 
its  natural  course  is  poorly  understood,  characterisation  of  the  actual  impact  of  ADAs  on  these 
patients  is  challenging  to  evaluate.  In  general,  review  of  immune-related  and  serious  or  severe 
infections in patients who were ADA positive did not raise specific safety concerns for either patients 
with GL or the PL subgroup.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 112/136 
 
 
 
Only 10 patients with ADA data available developed NAb according to the original analysis, but this 
number increased to 38 when analysed with the receptor binding assay. Review of immune-related 
AEs and serious or severe infections in this group of patients with neutralising antibody activity did 
generally  not  indicate  any  clear  pattern  or  significant  safety  concerns.  However,  based  on  the 
receptor  assay  re-evaluation  at  least  a  temporal  coincidence  of  severe/serious  infections  and  Nab 
formation  was  noted,  though  given  the  limited  size  of  the  data  set  it  is  not  possible  to  draw 
definitive conclusions on a causal association. Importantly, review of the clinical courses for patients 
with  PL,  who  have  residual  leptin  activity  where  there  is  concern  for  the  development  of  clearing 
ADAs  that  could  result  in  a  loss  of  both  metreleptin  and  endogenous  leptin,  showed  no  obvious 
effect  of  neutralising  activity;  there  were  no  immune-related  AEs  in  these  patients  at  the  time  of 
neutralising activity. 
Metreleptin  therapy  of  PL  patients  with  endogenous  leptin  levels  of  similar  magnitude  of  normal 
values  or  even  falling  into  the  normal  leptin  level  region  raises  a  further  concern.  Binding  of 
neutralising  ADA  to  this  remaining  endogenous  leptin  might  result  in  a  complete  loss  of  leptin 
activity and a deterioration of the PL after cessation of metreleptin treatment. This raises a serious 
safety concern for metreleptin administration in PL. 
However, currently there is no sufficient confirmative data on this potential issue available and this 
concern thus remains theoretical at present.  
Overall,  the  data  on  neutralising  response  is  fairly  limited  and  not  robust  enough  to  fully  preclude 
issues occurring due to NAb development. Nevertheless, serious and severe infections secondary to 
Nabs  and  loss  of  efficacy  potentially  due  to  Nabs  have  been  included  in  the  RMP  as  important 
potential risks. 
As  has  been  discussed  in  the  clinical  efficacy  section  of  this  report,  the  applicant  will  further 
investigate  the  formation  of  antidrug  antibodies  via  a  detailed  immunogenicity  strategy.  This  will 
include validation of new assays that will allow to determine the effect of NAb on endogenous leptin 
levels  which  currently  is  not  possible.  The  new  assays  will  be  used  on  historical  samples  but  also 
new  samples  collected  from  patients  in  the  registry  and  other  planned  studies  with  metreleptin.  In 
addition,  the  results  of  a  36-  month,  multicentre,  open-label  Phase  4  study  to  evaluate  the 
immunogenicity of daily SC metreleptin treatment in patients with GL will be submitted.  
Abortions, stillbirths and preterm deliveries have been reported in association with metreleptin use 
and thus effective contraception during treatment is advised. As a precautionary measure, it is 
preferable to avoid the use of metreleptin during pregnancy. 
Additionally, leptin plays a role in the hormonal cycle and is known to influence the release of LH 
hormone. Even though restoration of hormone balance may be seen as a possible positive side 
effect, it also raises the danger that uninformed patients whom thought themselves infertile could 
suddenly be faced with unexpected and potentially unwanted pregnancies. A warning therefore 
regarding unexpected pregnancy has been included in the product information. This concern will also 
be addressed in the planned Patient Registry, which will allow to collect data on the restored fertility 
possibly leading to an unanticipated pregnancy in addition to data on pregnancy. 
It is unknown whether metreleptin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk, though it is known 
that endogenous leptin is present in human milk. A risk to newborns / infants cannot be excluded. A 
decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
metreleptin therapy, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
No interaction studies have been performed in humans. This was considered acceptable. However,  
as leptin is a cytokine it has the potential to alter the formation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) 
enzymes. Since it cannot be excluded that metreleptin may reduce exposure to substrates of CYP3A 
Assessment report

Page 113/136 
 
 
 
through enzyme induction, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced if co-
administered with metreleptin. Therefore, an additional non-hormonal contraceptive method should 
be considered during treatment. The effect of metreleptin on CYP450 enzymes may be clinically 
relevant for CYP450 substrates with narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually 
adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of metreleptin, in patients being treated with these types 
of agents, therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin), or drug concentrations (e.g. cyclosporin 
or theophylline) should be performed and the individual dose of the agent adjusted as needed. 
When starting therapy with Myalepta there is a risk of hypoglycaemia in patients who are on anti-
diabetic medicinal products, in particular insulin or insulin secretagogues.  
Based on the available presentation and the small volumes of the product to be administered the 
CHMP considered that there is a high risk of medication errors which are therefore included as an 
important identified risk in the RMP. In order to address this, the product information includes 
detailed instructions on the stating dose and dose adjustment calculations based on the patient’s 
gender and weight. Moreover details of the required syringe, needle gauge and length is also 
included as well as a conversion table of the dose of Myalepta, the amount of solution required and 
the ‘Unit’ measurement volume in 0.3 mL U100 insulin syringe to inject. In addition, the patient will 
also receive separately the solvent for reconstitution (i.e. water for injection), the syringes/needles 
for reconstitution, the syringes/needles for administration, the cleansing alcohol swabs, and a sharps 
disposal container.  
Finally educational material will be provided to healthcare professionals, patients and care-givers to 
ensure the continued correct and compliant Myalepta reconstitution and dose adherence, and 
provide training on how to reconstitute metreleptin, measure the correct dose and self-administer 
metreleptin to reduce medication errors. Given the wide range of identified and potential risks 
associated with metreleptin use the educational material will also will highlight this risks and to help 
ensure that the HCPs using metreleptin are made aware of the risks and will be able to monitor and 
adjust the treatment accordingly. 
A  number  of  additional  actions  for  leptin  have  been  stipulated  based  on  clinical  and  non-clinical 
observations. For instance, leptin may increase levels of LH and there is  a theoretical concern that 
leptin  replacement  in  young  leptin-deficient  children  might  initiate  precocious  puberty  as  a 
consequence of these increased LH levels. 
Leptin deficient mice, have both decreased brain weight and cortical volume that can be corrected 
with early leptin administration. Similarly, in three congenitally leptin deficient human adults, leptin 
treatment has been shown to increase grey matter volume in cerebellum, inferior parietal, and 
anterior cingulate cortices. Furthermore, in these same patients, small reductions in grey matter 
volume were detected in these same areas when leptin treatment was discontinued. Furthermore, in 
these same patients, small reductions in grey matter volume were detected in these same areas 
when leptin treatment was discontinued. In healthy adults, plasma leptin levels have been 
associated with total brain volume, independent of body size (Farr, 2015 Metabolism).  
The leptin receptor can be found in adult primary osteoblasts and chondrocytes, suggesting that the 
effects of leptin on bone growth and metabolism may be direct. Although leptin may act peripherally 
on bone, central leptin administration in mice lacking leptin has been found to restore bone mass to 
control levels, suggesting that leptin may indirectly impact bone mass 
Based on these observations, “Effect of increased levels of LH above normal ranges in the paediatric 
population”, and effect of metreleptin on brain and bone metabolism have been included in the RMP 
as  missing  information  and  information  on  these  issues  will  be  collected  through  the  disease 
registry.

Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
Taking into account the limitations of the available data arising from the rarity and heterogeneity of 
the disease, the CHMP was of the view that the data set on the clinical safety of Myalepta under 
normal conditions of use could not be considered comprehensive. This was due to the size of the 
clinical trials and the lack of a control treatment group which given the multiple co-morbidities and 
co-medications of the studied population would be required to allow determination of causality 
between the reported events and metreleptin use. 
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
should be granted subject to specific obligations. These include the implementation of the registry to 
evaluate the long term safety profile of Myalepta especially with regards to the important identified 
and potential risks associated with metreleptin use and the provision of an integrated 
immunogenicity report, using validated assays for the detection of anti-drug antibodies and 
neutralising antibodies and analysing all available sample from patients with generalised and partial 
lipodystrophy from past and future studies conducted with Myalepta. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Despite the limited size of the safety database, due to the rarity of generalised and partial 
lipodystrophy, the overall safety profile of metreleptin is considered acceptable. The main safety 
concerns identified are of acute pancreatitis associated with discontinuation of metreleptin, 
hypoglycaemia with concomitant use with insulin and other antidiabetics, immunogenicity and the 
potential for medication errors and which are addressed adequately through appropriate and routine 
and additional risk minimisation measures. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
• The patient registry to evaluate the long-term safety profile Myalepta, especially in relation to 
acute pancreatitis associated with discontinuation of metreleptin, hypoglycaemia with concomitant 
use with insulin and other antidiabetics, lymphoma, immunogenicity and medication errors 
• An integrated immunogenicity report using validated assays for the detection of anti-drug 
antibodies from all available data in order to further investigate the clinical significance of the 
immunogenicity of metreleptin (ADAs and NAbs)

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lipodystrophy  syndromes  are  clinically  heterogeneous  inherited  or  acquired  ultra-rare  disorders 
characterised by selective but variable loss of adipose tissue. The loss of adipose tissue in patients 
with  LD  can  range  from  partial  to  more  generalised,  and  some  patients  have  concomitant 
accumulation of excess adipose tissue centrally. Because of the loss of adipose tissue, levels of the 
adipocyte-secreted  hormone  leptin  are  very  low.  Leptin  is  a  naturally  occurring,  adipocyte-derived 
hormone  and  an  important  regulator  of  energy  homoeostasis,  fat  and  glucose  metabolism, 
reproductive  capacity,  and  other  diverse  physiological  functions.  Circulating  levels  of  leptin  closely 
correlate  with  the  amount  of  fat  mass  present.  The  leptin  deficiency  observed  in  patients  with  LD 
results in a significant reduction in the ability to regulate hunger and energy, as well as glucose and 
fat metabolism. 
Lipodystrophy syndromes are classified by aetiology, i.e., genetic or acquired, and by distribution of 
adipose  tissue  deficiency,  i.e.,  generalised  (occurring  in  a  diffuse  fashion)  or  partial  (restricted  to 
regional  anatomical  adipose  depots),  leading  to  4  broad  categories:  congenital  generalised 
lipodystrophy  (CGL),  acquired  generalised  lipodystrophy  (AGL),  familial  partial  lipodystrophy  (FPL) 
and acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL).  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For patients with LD and associated diabetes and/or hypertriglyceridaemia, current available 
therapies include diet modification (low calorie, low fat, and low carbohydrate) and pharmacologic 
intervention with oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents, insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists, and/or 
lipid-lowering agents. Patients with milder metabolic abnormalities may be effectively treated with 
such therapies at the start of the disease process. However, the disease is progressive and those 
with more severe abnormalities often do not respond to these treatments due to the profound 
nature of their underlying abnormalities, especially when insulin resistance is severe and/or 
triglycerides are significantly elevated. 
Moreover, conventional therapies do not address the underlying leptin deficiency and therefore there 
is  an  unmet  medical  need  for  a  therapy  that  corrects  the  underlying  pathophysiology  of  the 
lipodystrophic state and effectively improves the metabolic disorders in these patients.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  primary  data  in  support  of  the  efficacy  of  metreleptin  are  derived  from  the  open  label 
Investigator-sponsored  Study  NIH  991265/20010769.  The  study  was  performed  by  the  National 
Institute of Health (NIH) and data were retrospectively collected. The single-arm open-label design 
is justified given the rarity of the disease and the fact that the open-label study design afforded the 
greatest sample population exposure to metreleptin in this rare indication. 
The primary objectives of the studies were to determine if metreleptin could be safely administered 
to  patients  with  LD  and  to  determine  if  metreleptin  would  be  effective  in  lowering  plasma  glucose 
and lipid abnormalities in patients with this disease.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 123/136 
 
 
 
Study participants were female and male patients with LD, including congenital/familial and acquired 
forms  enrolled  on  the  basis  of  having  low  circulating  protocol-specified  leptin  levels  and  either 
presence  of  diabetes  mellitus  (ADA  criteria),  fasting  insulin  concentration  >30  µL/mL  or  fasting  TG 
concentration > 200 mg/dL. 
Overall, 107 patients were enrolled, with GL and PL. The PL patient group originally proposed to be 
eligible for treatment was characterised by leptin levels <12 ng/mL with triglycerides ≥5.65 mmol/L 
and/or HbA1c ≥6.5%. A separate analysis was made for this subgroup.  
The  co-primary  endpoints  were  HbA1c  and  triglyceride  levels,  which  are  objective  measurements 
that can be evaluated with a single-arm, baseline-controlled, within patient design. Many subgroup 
analyses  were  performed  in  order  to  inform  on  influences  of  baseline  metabolic  parameters,  age, 
aetiology of disease, background medication, etc.  
No  separate  dose-response  studies  were  performed.  Information  to  support  metreleptin  dosage 
instructions  was  empirically  developed  from  the  long-term  efficacy  results  from  Study  NIH 
991265/20010769. 
Supportive  data  for  this  application  are  form  Study  FHA101.  This  was  a  treatment  IND  study 
designed to provide metreleptin access to physician-confirmed LD (GL and PL) patients with diabetes 
mellitus and/or hypertriglyceridaemia with triglycerides >200 mg/dL (however without specific leptin 
requirements).  Design  and  endpoints  were  similar  to  the  main  study,  but  overall  the  metabolic 
abnormalities of the patients were in general less elevated.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In  Study  NIH  991265/20010769,  mean  actual  change  in  HbA1c  to  Month  12/LOCF  was  -2.2% 
(p<0.001) for GL patients in the full analysis set (FAS) and -0.9% (p<0.001) for patients in the FAS 
in  the  PL  subgroup  (characterised  by  leptin  levels  <12  ng/mL  with  triglycerides  ≥5.65  mmol/L 
and/or HbA1c ≥6.5%). 
In the same study, mean percent change in triglycerides to Month 12/LOCF was -32.1% (p=0.001) 
for the GL group in the FAS and -37.4% (p<0.001) in the FAS PL subgroup (characterised by leptin 
levels  <12  ng/mL  with  triglycerides  ≥5.65  mmol/L  and/or  HbA1c  ≥6.5%)  excluding  1  outlying 
noncompliant patient.  
Mean  change  in  fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG)  to  Month  12/LOCF  was  -3.0%  (p<0.001)  for  the  GL 
group in the FAS and -1.8% (p=0.003) in the FAS PL subgroup (characterised by leptin levels <12 
ng/mL with triglycerides ≥5.65 mmol/L and/or HbA1c ≥6.5%). 
Nearly 80% of GL patients (FAS) and 68% of patients in the PL subgroup (FAS) had a ≥1% actual 
decrease  in  HbA1c  or  a  ≥30%  decrease  in  triglycerides  at  Month  12/LOCF  with  66%  and  43%, 
respectively, achieving the highest target decreases of ≥2% in HbA1c or a ≥40% in triglycerides.  
Subgroup  analyses  by  baseline  metabolic  abnormalities,  showed  that  patients  with  more  abnormal 
results  had  greater  decreases  from  baseline  in  these  parameters.  Both  males  and  females  with  GL 
sustained  clinically  meaningful  and  statistically  significant  reductions  in  HbA1c  and  triglycerides  at 
Month 12/LOCF. 
Endpoints of supportive study FAG101 confirm results of pivotal study.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  studies  were  open  label,  non-randomised  and  uncontrolled  which  is  challenging  to  interpret 
even  in  an  ultra-rare  disease  with  no  existing  causal  therapy.  Parameters  were  compared  to 
corresponding baseline values. 
As  dietary  compliance  and  calorie-intake  were  not  controlled  or  not  followed,  their  contribution  to 
the  magnitude  and  maintenance  in  observed  metabolic  and  other  (liver  e.g.)  effects  is  not  known. 
There  are  no  data  on  genetic  evaluation  of  the  study  populations  investigated  although  several 
genetic disturbances have been identified so far behind congenital and familial lipodystrophies. 
The  number  of  patients  is  low,  and  not  all  endpoints  and  all  time  points  were  measured  in  a 
sufficiently large number of patients.  
Very few data are available in patients below 6 years of age (5 GL patients, no PL patient). Effect on 
HbA1c and TG levels in patients below 12 years of age is less pronounced (no PL patient).  
No subgroups were made based on BL leptin levels including leptin levels that were originally used 
for inclusion in studies for men/women.  
Subgroup  of  PL  patients  for  inclusion  in  the  indication  was  sought  with  metabolic  parameters  that 
cause  symptoms  that  are  as  severe  as  in  GL  patients.  However,  PL  patients  did  not  require  to 
undergo an optimisation period under standardised treatment (antidiabetic, lipid-lowering).  
No separate dose finding study was performed and dose-escalation data is gathered from the pivotal 
efficacy study. Therefore, dosing is based on treatment response. 
Given  that  the  product  is  intended  to  be  administered  by  the  patient  himself  or  by  the  care  giver, 
there is a risk that the absence of solvent for reconstitution can lead to medication errors. 
A blocking activity of metreleptin has been observed in vitro in the blood of the majority of patients 
(96%) but the impact on the efficacy of metreleptin could not be clearly established. Some patients 
with  NAb  experienced  efficacy  loss,  but  the  majority  of  patients  had  reversal  of  NAc  during 
treatment and/or could be managed by dose adaptation.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported adverse events were weight decreased (15%) hypoglycaemia (13%); 
fatigue  (7%).  Other  commonly  reported  adverse  events  were  injection  site  reaction,  neutralising 
antibodies,  decreased  appetite,  nausea,  and  alopecia.  Six  of  148  patients  died  during  the  two  LD 
studies. Serious adverse events included abdominal pain and pancreatitis, infections, and worsening 
liver function.  
In both trials only a low number of serious adverse were considered as drug-related: 3 cases in the 
NIH  GL  patient  group  (hypertension,  respiratory  distress,  ACLC)  and  1  in  the  FHA101  overall  PL 
patient  group  (hypoglycaemia).  No  drug-related  deaths  occurred  in  the  LD  studies;  and  overall 
death  rate  was  also  very  low  (4%  across  both  trials)  with  no  apparent  imbalance  between  LD 
subgroups or between the trials. 
The rate of occurrence of TEAEs was low. Treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs were also low in 
both LD trials, with 6 patients discontinuing treatment in the NIH study and 4 in the FHA study. Only 
two of these, one in each study were considered drug-related. 
A number of AEs are considered of particular interest due to their known or possible association with 
metreleptin  treatment,  namely  hypersensitivity,  hypoglycaemia,  neoplasms  (in  particular  T-cell 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 125/136 
 
 
 
lymphomas), hepatic disorders, autoimmune disorders, serious infections, pancreatitis and injection 
site reactions. 
No worrying trends were seen amongst the LD patients in either trial in regards to hypersensitivity 
events, and only two occurred concurrent with NAb positive immunogenic status.  
Metreleptin decreases insulin resistance thereby increasing the possibility that hypoglycaemia events 
may  occur  and  that  adjustments  of  anti-diabetics  may  be  necessary.  Generally  reported 
hypoglycaemia  events  were  mild  in  severity  and  no  patterns  of  onset  relative  to  treatment  start 
were  seen.  Events  did  not  have  clinical  sequelae,  and  none  of  them  led  to  discontinuation  of 
treatment.  
Only three cases of T-cell lymphoma were noted across both LD trials, of which two were more likely 
caused  by  co-morbid issues  rather  than  treatment. Of  note,  no  T-cell lymphomas  were  reported  in 
the supportive obesity trials. 
Injection  site  reactions  were  expectedly  noted  during  the  trials,  and  though  the  incidence  rates 
varied  none  led  to  study  discontinuation.  Of  note  is  also  that  fact  that  more  than  50%  of  events 
occurred in the first month of treatment, implying that habituation to the injections occurs. 
Finally,  metreleptin  was  shown  to  be  immunogenic  as  88  %  of  the  74  patients  who  had  antibody 
testing  in  the  main  and  supportive  study  were  positive  for  ADA  –  and  about  14%  of  overall  LD 
patients developed a neutralising response.  
Based  on  an  FDA  request  available  samples  were  re-analysed  using  a  receptor  binding  assay,  and 
this  more  sensitive  test  revealed  an  even  higher  amount  of  persons  to  be  ADA  and  NAb  positive 
(96%  and  36%  respectively).  Despite  the  higher  numbers,  no  real  change  in  safety  profile  was 
apparent following the new analysis, except for a seemingly temporal association of severe/serious 
infections and NAb formation. 
3.5.   Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Even though TEAEs, had relatively low incidence rates, interpretation of these results is hindered by 
the overall small number of patients included in the submitted studies (which are further divided in 
distinct disease-type subgroups) but also the lack of a control arm in the pivotal LD trials, and that 
the underlying disease has many significant co-morbidities. Further information on the safety profile 
of the product will be collected.  
The effect of leptin (and consequently metreleptin) on cancer growth remains unknown. Endogenous 
leptin has been shown to increase cell proliferation in different animal and cancer cell models. Cases 
of  T-cell  lymphoma  have  been  reported  in  the  metreleptin  development  programme,  and  even 
though  metreleptin  causality  cannot  be  confirmed,  the  occurrence  of  such  events  in  a  small  safety 
data-set  is  of  concern.  Appropriate  wording  on  this  potential  risk  has  been  included  in  the  product 
information  and  educational  material  for  health-care  professionals  and  patients,  and  follow-up  of 
patients  in  the  disease  registry  that  is  being  planned  will  allow  further  collection  of  information  on 
this topic. 
A  number  of  pregnancies  occurred  in  LD  patients  during  the  trial  durations.  Given  that  leptin  is 
implicated in functioning of the hormonal system, affecting amongst others the release of LH, it is to 
be  expected  that  metreleptin  treatment  may  restore  of  improve  fertility  in  patients  and  this  is 
reflected  in  the  product  information.  Unplanned  pregnancy  is  also  included  in  the  RMP  as  an 
important potential risk, and is one of the topics of interest in the disease registry. 
Only a subset of LD patients had ADA data available, thus it is not possible to estimate the precise 
rate  of  ADA  positive patients  or  the  associated  adverse  reactions  from the  current  data.  Moreover, 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 126/136 
 
 
 
given  the  very  high  reported  rates of  patients  with ADA  and  the  discrepancies  between  the  assays 
used there are some questions over the reliability of methods used to detect ADAs. 
A potential risk of ADA is NAb cross-reacting with endogenous leptin, especially in the PL population, 
leading  to  loss  of  activity  in  these  patients.  A  temporal  association  also  seems  to  exist  between 
formation  of  NAbs  and  occurrence  of  severe/serious  infections.  Though  no  causality  has  been 
confirmed,  it  is theoretically  possible  that these  events  are  the  consequences  of  the  mechanism  of 
the  underlying  illness  in  conjunction  with  the  immune  suppressive  effect  of  NAbs.  In  order  to 
address  these  uncertainties  around  immunogenicity  the  applicant  will  provide  an  integrated 
immunogenicity  report,  using  validated  assays  and  analysing  samples  from  previous  and  future 
studies with metreleptin.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The severe metabolic abnormalities in patients with LD are often difficult to control even with high 
doses of currently available diabetes and lipid-lowering therapies. There is a significant unmet 
medical need for a replacement therapy that effectively improves the metabolic disorders in these 
ultra-rare patients that have metabolic abnormalities despite receiving these type of medications. 
Not only are these treatments rendered less effective by the profound insulin resistance, they also 
do little to correct the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their development.  
The treatment is not directly addressing the underlying cause of the disease, but is replacing leptin 
hormone deficiency that results from the lack of adipose tissue. Replacement of low or missing 
leptin by recombinant analogue is handling one main pathophysiological factor, but downstream 
signalling may still remain defective in some cases. 
As an analogue of leptin, it was anticipated that metreleptin would improve the metabolic 
abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency in patients with lipodystrophy, i.e., reduce HbA1c and 
triglycerides. Actual change in HbA1c is consistent with improvement in insulin sensitivity, and 
clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements were obtained in the pivotal study for 
both GL and (a subgroup of) PL patients. Clinically meaningful and statistically significant 
improvements in hypertriglyceridaemia were also obtained, again in both groups of patients.  
Subgroup  analysis  according  to  metabolic  parameters  at  baseline  showed  that  patients  with  more 
severe baseline parameters in HbA1c/TG have greater decrease from baseline.  
Most drug-related TEAEs observed could be expected based on the nature of treatment and the co-
morbidities  of  the  target  population.  Immunogenic  events,  hypoglycaemia,  T-cell  lymphomas  and 
injection site reactions are of most interest, and their rate of occurrence was generally low.  
Submitted  trials  showed  very  low  number  of  serious  adverse  events  that  could  be  considered  as 
drug-related. No worrying trends were seen amongst the LD patients in either trial with regards to 
hypersensitivity events, and only two occurred concurrent in the presence of NAb. ADA positivity of 
any  type  did  not  appear  to  have  an  impact  on  the  safety  profile  of  the  patient.  Antibodies  to 
metreleptin  were  detected  in  high,  nearly  90%  of  patients,  and  almost  10%  of  them  were 
neutralising which might lead to loss of efficacy but also may block the remaining endogenous leptin 
in PL. This is of concern as leptin has several, even not completely understood functions in addition 
to its role in appetite and energy regulation.  
Metreleptin increases insulin resistance thereby increasing the possibility that hypoglycaemia events 
may occur and that adjustments of anti-diabetics may be necessary. Generally incidence were mild 
in  severity  and  no  patterns  of  onset  relative  to  treatment  start  were  seen.  Likewise,  none  of  the 
hypoglycaemic event noted had clinical sequelae, and none led to discontinuations. The majority of 
events  could  also  be  controlled  by  dietary  means  and  required  no  adjustment  of  glycaemic 
medications. 
Finally, sudden discontinuation of metreleptin treatment may cause rebound phenomena manifested 
as  severe  bouts  of  pancreatitis,  and  thus  tapering  off  the  dosing  of  metreleptin  is  recommended. 
This risk will be minimised through a tapering period of two weeks. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite the limitations of the submitted data arising from the rarity and heterogeneity of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 128/136 
 
 
 
disease, and the retrospective analysis of data, the clinically meaningful, and statistically significant, 
and sustained decreases in HbA1c and triglycerides demonstrate clear efficacy of treatment.  
The reported results are even more significant in the context of the very high unmet medical need in 
patients with lipodystrophy that experience severe metabolic syndromes that cannot be adequately 
controlled with available antidiabetic and lipid-lowering therapies. 
Safety data did not reveal any unexpected adverse events however there are several uncertainties 
around the use of the product due to limited size of the safety database, the lack of a control arm in 
the studies, the multiple co-morbidities of the target population which render causality assessment 
challenging as well as the lack of a reliable anti-drug antibody detection method. The uncertainties 
have  been  addressed  by  appropriate  warnings  in  the  product  information  and  additional  risk 
minimisation  activities  to  better  inform  the  treating  physician  and  patients  of  the  risks  associated 
with metreleptin use. Furthermore, a number of additional pharmacovigilance activities, such as the 
disease  registry  and  a  thorough  immunogenicity  investigation  are  expected  to  provide  additional 
information to better characterise the safety profile of metreleptin. 
In  patients  with  confirmed  congenital  or  acquired  generalised  LD  (Berardinelli-Seip  syndrome  and 
Lawrence syndrome) the beneficial effects of metreleptin clearly outweigh any potential risks. These 
patients are the ones with the highest need for treatment and with negligible, if any at all, levels of 
endogenous leptin. Despite the limited available data in paediatric patients the CHMP acknowledged 
that  GL  paediatric  patients  above  2  years  of  age  can  benefit  from  treatment  with  metreleptin  as 
these  patients  present  at  a  very  young  age  with  metabolic  abnormalities  and  hepatomegaly, 
complications of micro- and macrovascular disease, as well as progressive liver disease.  
Within the familial partial LD or acquired partial LD (Barraquer-Simons syndrome population there is 
a  sub-group  of  patients  which  are  adequately  controlled  with  adjusted  diet,  antidiabetic  and  lipid 
lowering therapy. Moreover, as these patients have some endogenous leptin there is the theoretical 
risk of cross reaction with Nab, though this was not observed in this patient population. 
Therefore,  in  the  PL  indications  it  is  considered  appropriate  to  restrict  use  only  to  those  for  whom 
standard treatments have failed to achieve adequate metabolic control. Furthermore as there are no 
data  available  for  this  type  of  LD  for patients  under  12  years of  age,  use  of  the  product  should  be 
limited to adults and children 12 years of age and above 
The  uncertainties  have  been  addressed  by  appropriate  warnings  in  the  product  information  and 
additional risk minimisation activities to better inform the treating physician and patients of the risks 
associated  with  metreleptin  use.  Furthermore,  a  number  of  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities, 
such  as  the  disease  registry  a  through  immunogenicity  investigation  are  expected  to  provide 
additional information to better characterise the safety profile of metreleptin. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it is not possible to provide 
comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because the applied 
for indication is encountered so rarely. As a consequence the sample population available for 
inclusion in clinical trials is extremely limited and therefore the applicant cannot reasonably be 
expected to provide comprehensive evidence. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 129/136 
 
 
 
 Therefore, in light of the positive benefit/risk and considering the rarity of the indications, and the 
limited evidence available, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances is considered appropriate subject to the following specific obligations: 
• The applicant is required to set up a lipodystrophy disease registry In order to characterise 
the treatment of patients with metreleptin and to evaluate the long-term safety and 
effectiveness under conditions of usual clinical practice metreleptin; 
• The applicant is required to conduct an efficacy study in order to further characterise the 
effect of metreleptin on poor metabolic control once background therapy is maximised in 
patients with partial lipodystrophy; 
• The applicant should provide an integrated immunogenicity report using validated assays for 
the detection of anti-drug antibodies from all available data in order to further investigate 
the clinical significance of the immunogenicity of metreleptin (ADAs and NAbs) 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Myalepta is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Metreleptin is favourable in the following indication:  
adjunct to diet as a replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in 
lipodystrophy (LD) patients: 
• with confirmed congenital generalised LD (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome) or acquired generalised 
LD (Lawrence syndrome) in adults and children 2 years of age and above 
• with confirmed familial partial LD or acquired partial LD (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), in 
adults and children 12 years of age and above for whom standard treatments have failed to 
achieve adequate metabolic control. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive

2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this 
product within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile 
or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of MYALEPTA in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority.  
The educational programme is aimed at increasing awareness among healthcare professionals and 
patients/carers about the important risks contained in the Risk Management Plan. It is also aimed to 
guide prescribers about the appropriate management of these risks. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where MYALEPTA is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals and patients/carers who are expected to use MYALEPTA are provided with the following 
educational package: 
•  Healthcare professionals educational material  
•  Patients/carers educational material  
Healthcare professionals’ educational material should contain: 
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics  
•  Guide for healthcare professionals 
•  Healthcare professionals training material 
•  A dose card on which the doctor can write for the patient the dose in mg, ml (and where 
appropriate units from a 0.3 ml U100 insulin syringe). This card will also include pictures of 
the relevant syringe sizes on which the doctor can draw a line to indicate on the volume of 
water for injection to use for reconstitution and the volume of reconstituted solution to 
inject. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 131/136 
 
 
 
The Guide/training material for healthcare professionals shall contain the following 
key elements: 
o  Reminders on key prescribing information content, including indicated population, 
posology, warnings and precautions, and other safety- related information which is key 
to safe use of the product. This will include for example instructions for handling possible 
ADRs. 
o  Responsibility of the prescribing physician to provide appropriate training to the 
patient/carer who will administer the treatment and that the first dose should be 
administered in the presence of a doctor or nurse. 
o  The requirement to perform regular follow-ups with the patient/carer to ensure 
continued correct and compliant MYALEPTA reconstitution and treatment. 
o  Hypersensitivity has been reported with MYALEPTA use including anaphylaxis, urticaria 
and generalised rash. If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction 
occurs, administration of MYALEPTA should be permanently discontinued immediately 
and appropriate therapy initiated. 
o  Non-compliance with or abrupt withdrawal of MYALEPTA may result in worsening of 
hypertriglyceridaemia and associated pancreatitis: 
-  Risk factors include patients with a history of pancreatitis or severe 
hypertriglyceridaemia. 
-  Tapering the dose over a two-week period is recommended in conjunction with a low 
fat diet. 
-  Patients should be monitored during tapering. Initiating or adjusting lipid lowering 
medications may be required. 
-  Signs and/or symptoms consistent with pancreatitis should prompt an appropriate 
clinical evaluation. 
o  Hypoglycaemia with concomitant use of insulin and other antidiabetics may occur: 
-  Large dose reductions of 50% or more of baseline insulin requirements may be 
needed in the first 2 weeks of MYALEPTA treatment. Once insulin requirements have 
stabilised, dose adjustments of other anti-diabetics may also be needed in some 
patients. 
-  Monitoring of blood glucose in patients on concomitant insulin therapy, especially 
those on high doses, or insulin secretagogues and combination treatment is 
warranted. Patients and carers should be advised to be aware of the signs and 
symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
- 
In case of hypoglycaemic events of a non-severe nature, food intake management 
may be considered as an alternative to dose adjustment of anti-diabetics. 
-  Rotation of injection sites is recommended in patients co administering insulin (or 
other SC medicinal products) and MYALEPTA. 
o  Ways to prevent the occurrence of medication errors 
-  MYALEPTA is administered by SC injection and proper technique should be used to 
avoid intramuscular injection in patients with minimal SC tissue. 
-  HCPs should provide training to patients on the correct technique. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435156/2018  
Page 132/136 
 
 
 
-  Patients and/or caregivers should prepare and administer the first dose under the 
supervision of a qualified HCP. 
-  Detailed instructions for use. 
-  Guidance in the educational materials on: 
  The size of syringes and needles to prescribe 
  Prescribing the dose in both mg and ml and, where a 0.3mL U100 insulin syringe 
is used, informing patients on the dose in "units" on the syringe to inject 
  The prescribing of ampoule/vial sizes volumes of water for injection in appropriate 
volumes to reduce the risk of re-use 
Pharmacists will be guided in the educational materials on the ancillary items that need 
to be dispensed to patients including appropriate sized reconstitution and administration 
syringes and needles, appropriate sized vials/ampoules of water for injection, alcohol 
swabs and a sharps bin plus how to access Aegerion reconstitution and administration 
kits containing all of the above items except the water for injection and sharps bin. 
-  Access to further materials, including training videos in multiple languages that will 
demonstrate each step to in preparing and administering MYALEPTA via a website. 
o  T-cell lymphoma 
-  Acquired LDs are associated with autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders are 
associated with an increased risk of malignancies including lymphomas. 
-  Lymphoproliferative disorders, including lymphoma have been reported in patients 
with acquired generalised LD not treated with MYALEPTA. Cases of T-cell lymphoma 
have been reported in clinical studies in patients taking MYALEPTA. A causal 
relationship between lymphoma and MYALEPTA has not been established. 
-  The benefits and risks of MYALEPTA should be carefully considered in patients with 
acquired LD and/or those with significant haematologic abnormalities (including 
leukopenia, neutropenia, bone marrow abnormalities, lymphoma and/or 
lymphadenopathy). An association between the development of NAbs and serious 
and severe infections cannot be excluded and the continuation of MYALEPTA should 
be at the discretion of the prescriber. 
o  MYALEPTA may increase fertility, due to effects on LH and thus the chances of 
unplanned pregnancy. Women of childbearing potential should be advised that 
MYALEPTA may increase fertility and should be encouraged to use contraception. 
o  Neutralising antibodies may develop on MYALEPTA therapy. An association between the 
development of neutralising antidrug antibodies and serious and severe infections 
cannot be excluded, and, continuation of MYALEPTA should be at the discretion of the 
prescriber. Consideration should also be given by the prescriber to have patients tested 
for the presence of neutralising antibodies. 
o 
Loss of efficacy, potentially due to neutralising antibodies, may occur in patients on 
MYALEPTA therapy. While the impact of neutralising antibodies on efficacy has not been 
confirmed, consideration should be given by the prescriber to have patients tested for 
the presence of neutralising antibodies if there is significant loss of efficacy despite 
MYALEPTA administration.

•  Guide for patients/carers  
• 
Patients/carers training material 
The Guide/training material for patients/carers shall contain the following key 
elements: 
o  Reminders on key prescribing information content, including indicated population, 
posology, warnings and precautions, and other safety- related information which is key 
to safe use of the product. This will include for example instructions for handling possible 
ADRs 
o  Allergic reactions can occur with MYALEPTA use. Advice will be provided on symptoms of 
an allergic reaction and action to be taken in the event of such a reaction. 
o  The need of compliance with treatment due to the risk of pancreatitis when medication is 
abruptly stopped. The importance of tapering the dose of MYALEPTA over two weeks if it 
is to be discontinued. 
o  Hypoglycaemia with concomitant use of insulin and other antidiabetics may occur. 
o  The risk of medication error: 
-  Responsibility of the prescribing physician to provide appropriate training to the 
patient/carer who will administer the treatment and that the first dose should be 
administered in the presence of a doctor or nurse 
-  The requirement to perform regular follow-ups with the patient/carer to ensure 
continued correct and compliant MYALEPTA reconstitution and treatment 
-  Guidance on the appropriate syringe size ancillary administration set to prescribe 
according to the dosage of MYALEPTA and how to read the syringe volumes 
-  How to access a video on line which shows step by step how to reconstitute, 
measure the correct dose and administer it subcutaneously 
o  The association between LD and lymphoma and that the patient will be monitored during 
treatment. 
o  Serious and severe infections secondary to the appearance of NAb may occur. 
o  MYALEPTA may increase fertility, due to effects on LH and thus the chances of 
unplanned pregnancy.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that metreleptin is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0314/2016 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1.1. 
Introduction 
The  company  is  requesting  the  following  new  indication  in  the  treatment  of  Acute  Coronary 
Syndromes (ACS) for Arixtra 2.5 mg:  
Treatment of unstable angina or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) ACS 
for the prevention of death, myocardial infarction and refractory ischaemia. Fondaparinux has been 
shown to reduce all cause mortality in patients with UA/NSTEMI. 
Treatment  of  ST  segment  elevation  myocardial  infarction  (STEMI)  ACS  for  the  prevention  of  death 
and myocardial re-infarction in patients who are managed with thrombolytics or who initially are to 
receive  no  other  form  of  reperfusion  therapy.  Fondaparinux  has  been  shown  to  reduce  all  cause 
mortality in patients with STEMI. 
As  a  consequence  of  the  requested  new  indication,  the  MAH  is  also  applying  for  major  changes  to 
sections 4.2 (posology) and 5.1 (Pharmacodynamic properties), and other changes in 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 5.2 
and section 6 of the SPC. 
In order to treat the STEMI subset of ACS patients, the MAH is also applying for the approval of a 
new  route  of  administration,  namely  intravenous,  for  the  already  existing  2.5  mg  pre-filled  syringe. 
This  requested  change 
is  being  processed  through  a  separate  Line  Extension  application 
(EMEA/H/C/403/X/25), and the details thereof will not be further discussed in this report. 
The application is based on 2 large phase III pivotal studies (OASIS 5 and OASIS 6) and 4 phase II 
supportive trials. These  studies have investigated the  efficacy and safety of fondaparinux in patients 
with  ACS,  with  and  without  ST-segment  elevation.  No  Scientific  Advice  was  sought  to  discuss  the 
design of the trials. 
Rationale for the proposed change 
The  term  acute  coronary  syndrome  (ACS)  includes  UA,  NSTEMI  and  STEMI,  all  of  which  share  a 
common underlying pathophysiology. ACS normally results from the sudden rupture or erosion of an 
existing  atheromatous  plaque,  which  exposes  a  thrombogenic  surface  causing platelet  activation  and 
thrombus  formation.  The  acute  development  of  a  coronary  thrombus,  in  the  case  of  UA/NSTEMI 
severely restricts, and in STEMI, completely occludes the culprit coronary artery, causing myocardial 
ischaemia  and/or  injury  in  the  territory  supplied  by  the  affected  vessel(s).  Diagnostically  on  ECG, 
UA/NSTEMI  typically  results  in  depressed  ST  segments  and/or  T  wave  inversions,  and  STEMI 
produces  elevated  ST  segments.  The  extent  of  any  permanent  myocardial  damage  is  estimated  by 
markers of cardiac injury (e.g. troponin, CPK MB) and is dependent on a number of factors such as 
duration of the ischaemia and the amount of myocardium supplied by the affected coronary artery. 
ACS is a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and is a significant burden on health care resources. 
Each year there are at least 1.5 million hospitalisations for ACS in USA, with an estimated further 4 
million worldwide. Over half are attributable to UA and NSTEMI and almost a third to STEMI. Not 
only  is  STEMI  a  significant  public  health  burden  in  developed  countries,  but  it  is  also  becoming  a 
major  problem  in  developing  countries.  Registry  data  from  developed  countries  suggests  a  shift 
towards declining incidence of STEMI and increasing incidence of UA, which may reflect detection 
earlier  in  the  disease  continuum,  thus  reducing  the  morbidity  and  mortality  risk  following  patient 
presentation.  
Patients with UA/NSTEMI exhibit a spectrum of risk for death and cardiac ischaemic events. Registry 
data reveals risk of in-hospital mortality rises for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of UA (1-3%), 
NSTEMI (5-6%) and STEMI (7-9%). These differences are also reflected in the 30-day mortality rates 
of 1.7%, 7.4% and 11.1%, respectively. Results from the GUSTO-11b trial also show a significantly 
higher  30-day  mortality  risk  following  STEMI  compared  to  NSTEMI  (6.1%  vs  3.8%  respectively). 
However, by the end of one year, the mortality risk did not differ significantly (9.6% vs 8.8%). In light 
of the high 1-year mortality rates, there remains a critical need for effective acute treatments in both

patient  groups,  despite  the  pharmacological  options  available.  Furthermore,  many  of  the  currently 
available drugs are precluded in certain situations or populations, particularly where bleeding risk is a 
concern,  or  have  significant  drawbacks,  such  as  the  need  for  monitoring,  the  possibility  of  inducing 
HIT, and complex dosing regimens. 
Currently  available  antithrombotic  drugs  are  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  bleeding.  For 
example,  the  reported  rates  of  major  bleeding  in  GRACE  were  4.7%  and  4.8%  for  NSTEMI  and 
STEMI patients, respectively. Recently it has been acknowledged that, in ACS patients, bleeding plays 
an important role in adverse outcome, including mortality. Moreover, a recent large registry study has 
shown  that  over  40%  of  ACS  patients  administered  an  antithrombotic  agent  (UFH,  LMWH,  or 
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor) receive an incorrect dose. Overdosing was most prevalent in patient groups who 
were  already  at  a  high  risk  of  bleeding,  including  the  elderly,  women  and  patients  with  renal 
impairment, and was associated with a higher risk of bleeding and increased mortality. 
Thus,  a  major  therapeutic  advantage  would  be  a  drug  with  a  simple  dosing  regimen,  which  is 
efficacious  for  the  prevention  of  the  sequelae  of  both  UA/NSTEMI  and  STEMI,  but  which  is  not 
associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The anti-Factor Xa specificity of fondaparinux allows a 
more  predictable  anticoagulant  response  with  no  need  for  monitoring  of  coagulation  parameters.  In 
addition to being effective for the prevention of VTE in the venous circulation, fondaparinux was also 
expected to be an effective antithrombotic in the arterial circulation; due to its  mechanism of action 
that ultimately inhibits the formation of thrombin. As already noted, thrombin inhibition is one of the 
mechanisms by which UFH and LMWH are believed to exert their beneficial effects in ACS patients.  
1.2  Non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetic data indicate that fondaparinux was completely bioavailable in the rat and rabbit after 
subcutaneous  administration,  allowing  extrapolation  of  SC  data  to  IV  data  in  terms  of  AUC. 
Previously  submitted  toxicological  data  sufficiently  address  the  IV  route  and  no  additional  data  are 
considered necessary. Further details on the non-clinical aspects of the IV administration can be found 
in the AR of the concurrent line extension EMEA/H/C/403/X/25. 
1.3  Clinical aspects 
Overview of data submitted 
The clinical development program for fondaparinux in ACS comprises 6 clinical studies; 4 were phase 
II studies (PENTUA, PENTALYSE, ASPIRE and ACT 2445) and 2 pivotal phase III studies (OASIS-5 
in UA/NSTEMI and OASIS 6 in patients with STEMI), including a total of 34,071 subjects.

Analysis of data submitted 
Phase II studies 
Four  phase  II  studies  included  a  total  of  1,901  subjects  and  assessed  a  range  of  doses  (2.5mg  to 
12mg)  and  dose  regimens  (IV  and/or  sc  with  single/repeat  dosing)  in  a  variety  of  clinical  settings 
within  the  broad  spectrum  of  ACS.  Two  were  dose-ranging  studies  in  subjects  with  UA/NSTEMI 
(PENTUA) and STEMI (PENTALYSE) that evaluated fondaparinux administered sc for up to 7 days 
following  an  initial  iv  dose.  The  other  two  phase  II  studies,  ASPIRE  and  ACT2445  evaluated 
primarily  the  safety  of  iv  bolus  doses  of  fondaparinux  administered  as  an  adjunct  during  coronary 
interventions. ACT2445 assessed 12mg fondaparinux administered as an iv bolus prior to PTCA while 
the subsequent ASPIRE study provided reassurance that fondaparinux administered as either a 2.5 or 
5.0mg  iv  bolus  might  be  suitable  as  an  adjunct  to  PCI  in  the  phase  III  program.  As  the  primary 
objective of these studies was a safety profile and not determination of the effective dose, they will not 
be detailed in this report. 
PENTUA (63119):  
A  multicentre,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  randomised,  active-controlled,  dose  ranging  study 
comparing four doses of fondaparinux (2.5mg, 4mg, 8mg and 12mg) and enoxaparin (1mg/kg BID) in 
subjects with UA or non-Q wave MI.  
The primary objective was to assess the dose-response relationship of fondaparinux using a composite 
of  death  (any  cause  except  bleeding),  AMI  or  recurrent  ischemia  up  to  and  including  Day  9  as  the 
primary endpoint, in order to select a suitable dose for future studies.  
Diagnosis  and  Main  Criteria  for  Inclusion:  The  study  recruited  hospitalised  or  non-hospitalised 
subjects  with  suspected  or  documented  non-Q  wave  MI  without  persistent  ST-segment  elevation  or 
with angina at rest or during minimal exertion and whose last episode of pain was <24 hours prior to 
the screening ECG with either dynamic ST segment changes or clear ST segment depression of ≥1mm 
and/or  serum  troponin  T  or  troponin  I  concentrations  >0.1ng/ml  at  screening.  Subjects  showing 
persistent ST segment elevation on the screening ECG compatible with an evolving AMI or subjects 
scheduled  for  PTCA  or  angiography  within  24  hours  or  CABG  within  48  hours  of  screening  were 
excluded. 
Doses of fondaparinux were 2.5mg, 4mg, 8mg or 12mg by SC injection OD after an initial IV bolus 
dose on Day 1 for a minimum of 3 and maximum of 7 days. The fondaparinux doses were adjusted for 
body  weight;  subjects  weighing  <50kg  received  2mg,  3mg,  6mg  or  9mg  daily,  whereas  subjects 
weighing >100kg received 3mg, 5mg, 10mg or15mg daily. Subjects randomised to enoxaparin were 
treated with 1mg/kg BID by SC injection for a minimum of 3 and maximum of 7 days. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of death from any cause (except bleeding), AMI and 
symptomatic recurrent ischemia up to and including Day 9. To support the primary efficacy analysis, 
the  incidence  of  the  composite  endpoint  was  also  assessed  up  to and  including  Day  30.  The  sample 
size calculation was based on the ability to detect a positive dose-response relationship and assumed 
an incidence of the composite endpoint of 50% in the lowest dose group and an incidence of 36% in 
the highest dose group. Assuming that approximately 10% of the enrolled subjects had major protocol 
violations, 1075 (215 per group) subjects had to be randomised in total. This sample size gave a power 
of 80% for the comparisons between each fondaparinux group versus enoxaparin, if the true difference 
between the groups was approximately 15%. 
The primary safety analysis was on the incidence of major bleedings (overt bleeding associated with 
any  of  the  following:  death  or  life-threatening  condition,  operation  to  manage  bleeding,  retro-
peritoneal,  intracranial  or  in  a  critical  organ,  haemoglobin  drop  of  >20g/l)  from  up  to  and including 
Day 9. The incidence of any bleeding (major or minor) was considered as a secondary safety endpoint.

Number of Subjects: In total, 1147 subjects were recruited at 64 centres in 5 countries. The intent-to-
treat (ITT) population (all subjects randomised who received at least one dose of study drug) consisted 
of  1143  subjects.  A  total  of  214  (18.7%)  subjects  had  major  protocol  deviations  resulting  in  a  PP 
population  for  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  of  929  subjects  (fondaparinux  2.5mg:  203  subjects; 
fondaparinux 4mg: 177 subjects; fondaparinux 8mg: 173 subjects; fondaparinux 12mg: 187 subjects; 
enoxaparin: 189 subjects).   
Results: 
There was no (linear) dose response relationship between the incidence of the primary endpoint and 
any  of  the  tested  fondaparinux  doses.  Indeed,  the  incidence  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was 
lowest in the fondaparinux 2.5mg group, whereas the incidence in the 4mg dose group was the highest 
(fondaparinux  2.5mg:  30.0%;  fondaparinux  4mg:  43.5%;  fondaparinux  8mg:  41.0%;  fondaparinux 
12mg: 34.8%; enoxaparin: 40.2%). 
There was a significant reduction in the incidence of the composite primary endpoint at Day 9 in the 
fondaparinux  2.5mg  group  (30.0%)  compared  with  the  fondaparinux  4mg  (43.5%,  p=0.011), 
fondaparinux 8mg (41%, p=0.036) and the enoxaparin (40.2%, p=0.047) groups; all other differences 
were  not  statistically  different.  At  Day  30  there  was  also  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  the 
composite endpoint between the fondaparinux 2.5mg group (33.8%) and the fondaparinux 4mg group 
(44.9%, p=0.032). All other differences were not statistically different although the difference between 
the  fondaparinux  2.5mg  group  (33.8%)  and  enoxaparin  (43.6%)  approached  statistical  significance 
(p=0.055). 
There was no (linear) dose response relationship between the incidence of any bleeding event and any 
of the tested fondaparinux doses (fondaparinux 2.5mg: 3.9%; fondaparinux 4mg: 5.4%; fondaparinux 
8mg:  5.4%;  fondaparinux  12mg:  4.6%;  enoxaparin:  4.8%).  There  were  no  statistically  significant 
differences in the incidence of major bleeding up to Day 9 and up to Day 30 between the treatment 
groups.  
In total there were 33 deaths, 23 deaths to Day 30 and 10 deaths after Day 30. The lowest incidence of 
death  was  found  in  the  fondaparinux  2.5mg  group  (fondaparinux  2.5mg:  1.7%;  fondaparinux  4mg: 
4.5%;  fondaparinux  8mg:  2.7%;  fondaparinux  12mg:  2.9%;  enoxaparin:  2.6%).  Up  to  Day  90,  the 
incidence of subjects with SAEs observed in the fondaparinux 2.5mg and enoxaparin group (7.9% and 
7.4%, respectively) tended to be lower than in the other treatment groups (11.3%, 11.2% and 11.3% in 
the fondaparinux 4mg, 8mg and 12mg groups, respectively).  
PENTALYSE: 
A  multicentre,  open-label,  randomised,  active-controlled,  parallel  group,  dose-ranging  study 
comparing  3  doses  of  fondaparinux  (4mg,  8mg  and  12mg)  and  UFH  as  adjunctive  therapy  to 
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and aspirin (ASA) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI).  
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  3  dose  regimens  of  fondaparinux 
combined with recombinant rTPA and ASA in AMI. Secondary objectives included the assessment of 
the  efficacy  of  the  combination  therapy  for  restoring  and  maintaining  early  coronary  patency.  The 
study recruited subjects with ischemic pain lasting at least 30 minutes, ST-segment elevation ≥0.1mV 
in two or more limb leads or ≥0.2mV in two or more contiguous precordial leads, for whom planned 
treatment was initiated within six hours of pain onset.  
Treatment  Administration:  Subjects  randomised  to  fondaparinux  received  a  single  IV  bolus 
injection of fondaparinux 4mg, 8mg or 12mg on Day 1 followed by daily SC injections for 4±1 days. 
The  daily  dose  was  reduced  by  2mg  in  the  8mg  and  12mg  groups  for  body  weight  <60kg  and 
increased by 2mg in the 4mg and 8mg groups for body weight >90kg. Subjects randomised to UFH 
and  weighing  >67kg  received  an  IV  bolus  of  5000IU  on  Day  1  followed  by  an  IV  infusion  of 
1000IU/h for 48-72 hours. For subjects weighing ≤67kg the dose of the IV bolus was 4000IU and the 
IV  infusion  was  800IU/h.  The  infusion  rate  was  adjusted  to  maintain  an  activated  partial 
thromboplastin time of 50 to 75 seconds. 
The main efficacy endpoint was recovery of patency of the MI-related coronary artery (TIMI Grade 3 
flow)  90  minutes  after  the  start  of  thrombolytic  therapy  and  on  Day  6.  Clinical  endpoints  of  death, 
5

reMI, emergency revascularisation procedure, and combined events during the 30±7-day study period 
were also assessed. The sample size was set at 80 subjects per group for feasibility reasons. 
The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of primary intracranial bleeding or blood transfusion 
(whole blood or packed red cells) during the 30-day study period.   
In total, 333 subjects were randomised at 24 centres in 6 countries. The all-treated data set (all subjects 
randomized  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug)  consisted  of  326  subjects  (fondaparinux 
4mg: 81 subjects; fondaprinux 8mg: 77 subjects; fondaparinux 12mg: 83 subjects; UFH: 85 subjects). 
A total of 10 (3.1%) subjects with protocol deviations were excluded from the main efficacy analysis 
at 90 minutes and 127 subjects (39.0%) with protocol deviations were excluded from the main efficacy 
analysis on Day 6±1.   
Results:  
There was no significant  dose effect of fondaparinux on the number of subjects with TIMI Grade 3 
flow  assessed  at  90  minutes  (fondaparinux  4mg:  64.6%;  fondaparinux  8mg:  68.9%;  fondaparinux 
12mg:  59.5%;  UFH:  67.9%)  or  at  Day  6±1  (fondaparinux  4mg:  81.3%;  fondaparinux  8mg:  88.0%; 
fondaparinux 12mg: 88.9%; UFH: 75.0%). The incidences of individual clinical endpoints (death, MI 
and revascularisation) were not statistically significant between the four treatment groups. 
There  was  no  statistically  significant  trend  for  a  dose-effect  on  the  primary  safety  endpoint.  The 
percentage  of  subjects  with  the  primary  safety  endpoint  during  the  30±7  day  study  period  was 
comparable  in  the  four  treatment  groups  (fondaparinux  4mg:  4.9%;  fondaparinux  8mg:  9.1%; 
fondaparinux 12mg: 7.2%; UFH: 7.1%). There was a dose-dependent increase in unusual bleeding (as 
considered  by  the  investigator)  in  the  fondaparinux  group  (p=0.0006);  the  incidence  in  the 
fondaparinux 4mg group (24.7%) was lower than the fondaparinux 8mg (48.1%) and 12mg (51.2%) 
groups but similar to that with UFH (26.2%). Most of these bleeding events were procedural (site of 
femoral  puncture  for  catheterisation).  There  were  seven  deaths,  two  in  each  of  the  fondaparinux 
groups  and  one  in  the  UFH  group.  The  incidence  of  SAEs  and  AEs  leading  to  permanent  treatment 
discontinuation were higher in the fondaparinux 8mg and 12mg groups compared with the 4mg and 
UFH groups. 
Conclusion:  
Based  on  the  results  of  coronary  angiography  at  90  minutes  and  Day  6±1  and  on  the  occurrence  of 
clinical  endpoints,  the  efficacy  of  fondaparinux  in  restoring  coronary  patency  was  considered 
comparable  with  that  of  UFH,  when  both  agents  were  used  in  combination  with  rTPA  and  ASA. 
However, no dose effect was observed for early or late coronary patency or the clinical endpoints. The 
incidence of subjects with blood transfusions or intracranial bleeding was similar in the four treatment 
groups. However, the overall incidence of unusual bleeding indicated a dose-effect relationship.   
Discussion on dose selection 
The  CHMP  questioned  the  selection  of  the  2.5mg  dose  as  it  is  not  supported  by  a  strong  clinical 
rationale. Moreover, in contrast to LMWHs where the higher VTE treatment doses are approved for 
use in UA/NSTEMI, fondaparinux 2.5 mg is the same dose used for the prevention of VTE. However, 
unlike those conducted with fondaparinux, the phase II ACS studies for the LMWHs did not evaluate 
the wide dose range that included the lower VTE prevention doses. 
The Applicant claims that despite the lack of a clear dose-response pattern in the phase II trials, the 
following important findings have been taken into account when selecting the 2.5mg dose:  
• 
• 
The data from PENTUA (UA/NSTEMI) and PENTYLASE (STEMI) suggested that the lowest 
doses  in  each  (2.5mg  and  4.0mg  respectively)  had  comparable  efficacy  to  their  respective 
benchmark therapies enoxaparin and UFH.  
Although there was no clear evidence of a dose response relationship for the primary efficacy or 
safety  endpoints  in  either  study,  there  was  evidence  of  a  dose-dependent  increase  in  unusual 
bleeding in PENTYLASE, suggesting that a  minimally effective  dose  might be appropriate in 
order to reduce bleeding liability, particularly given the concomitant use of antiplatelet therapies 
6

and  interventions  used  in  the  ACS  population.  The  selection  of  a  common  dose  for  both 
indications was considered appropriate given that UA, NSTEMI and STEMI represent a disease 
continuum with a common underlying pathophysiology. 
Although 4mg was the lowest dose common to both studies, bleeding data in PENTUA 
suggested that 2.5mg had the lowest bleeding risk of all the doses evaluated (including 4mg) 
and there was no suggestion of an efficacy advantage at doses higher than 2.5mg.

OASIS 5 study: fondaparinux in the treatment of UA/NSTEMI 
This  was  a  double-blind,  double-dummy,  parallel-group,  controlled  trial  to  compare  the  safety  and 
efficacy  of  fondaparinux  and  enoxaparin  in  subjects  with  UA/NSTEMI  and  was  conducted  at  576 
centres in 42 countries. 
The primary objective of was to evaluate whether fondaparinux 2.5mg was “non-inferior”, or superior 
to, enoxaparin in preventing death and ischemic events (MI or refractory ischemia [RI]) up to Day 9 in 
the  acute  treatment  of  subjects  with  UA/NSTEMI  concurrently  managed  with  standard  medical 
therapy.  As  a  non-inferiority  study,  the  primary  endpoint  was  assessed  at  the  end  of  the  treatment 
period  (Day  9).  This  conservative  approach  was  taken  to  avoid  positive  bias  in  favour  of  non-
inferiority that might occur at remote time points due to factors unrelated to the short term therapy.  
The  secondary  objectives  were  i)  to  determine  whether  fondaparinux  is  superior  to  enoxaparin  in 
reducing death and MI at Day 9, ii) to determine whether fondaparinux is superior to enoxaparin in 
reducing major bleeding events up to Day 9, and iii) to determine if the relative effect on the primary 
endpoint, i.e., prevention of death, MI, or RI at Day 9, is sustained at Days 14, 30, 90, and 180.

9. Bleeding definitions used in the phase III studies are provided below. 
A single, independent Event Adjudication Committee (EAC) was responsible for blinded adjudication 
of all primary efficacy and safety outcome events, as well as key secondary events. 
The  comparator  was  enoxaparin,  selected  based  on  its  common  usage  in  the  management  of 
UA/NSTEMI  as  well  as  its  class  IIA  recommendation  in  the  American  College  of  Cardiology 
(ACC)/American  Heart  Association  treatment  guidelines  and  the  general  recommendation  in  the 
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines.  The dose regimen and treatment duration used is 
consistent with what is currently approved for UA/NSTEMI.  
Subjects presenting within 24 hours with symptoms suspected to represent UA/NSTEMI, and, met one 
of the two following additional criteria were included:  
• 
• 
Troponin T or I or creatine kinase MB above the upper limit of normal 
ECG changes compatible with ischemia (i.e. ST depression at least 1mm in 2 contiguous leads 
or T wave inversion >3mm or any dynamic ST shift or transient ST elevation) 
These criteria were modified during the conduct of the study in order to increase the blinded event rate 
to meet the projected sample size. This change required subjects <60 years to be higher risk and have 
both elevated cardiac enzymes and ECG changes consistent with ischemia.   
The  key  exclusion  criteria  were:  Subjects  with  severe  renal  insufficiency  (i.e.  serum  creatinine 
≥3mg/dl  or  265μmol/l),  a  contraindication  to  low  molecular  weight  heparin  (LMWH),  or  who  had 
already had a revascularisation procedure performed for the qualifying event. 
Regarding study treatments, subjects received fondaparinux 2.5mg s.c once daily for 8 days or until 
hospital discharge, if earlier, or weight-adjusted enoxaparin (1mg/kg) twice daily for 2-8 days or until 
clinically  stable,  both  administered  in  a  double-blind  double-dummy  fashion.  If  creatinine  clearance 
was between 20ml/min and 30ml/min, a once-daily 1mg/kg s.c. injection of enoxaparin or enoxaparin-
placebo  was  administered  at  24  hour  intervals  (±  4  hours).  Subject  follow-up  was  for  a  minimum 
period of 90 days and a maximum of 180 days. All subjects were to be followed for the pre-specified 
study period or until death. 
For subjects undergoing CABG surgery, study drug administration was to be temporarily interrupted 
between 24 hours before and 48 hours after surgery. 
For  all  subjects  undergoing  PCI,  the  study  blind  was  maintained.  All  such  subjects  were  to  be 
pretreated  with  clopidogrel  and  ASA  at  least  6  hours  before  the  procedure.  If  PCI  was  performed 
between  randomisation  and  Day  8,  and  within  12  hours  of  the  last  s.c.  dose  of  study  drug,  subjects 
were  to  receive  additional  study  drug:  fondaparinux  2.5  or  5  mg  i.v.  vs  UFH  65  or  100  IU/kg  i.v.

(enoxaparin group) depending on the time since the previous dose of s.c. study drug and whether i.v. 
GPIIb/IIIa  inhibitor  use  was  planned,  administered  at  least  1  minute  before  insertion  of  the  guiding 
catheter. Rescue open-label UFH in either treatment group was permitted based on the ACT result. 
If PCI was performed as the initial treatment, subjects were to be treated with study drug for at least 2 
calendar days.  
Study drug administration was to be continued after PCI, whenever possible. If PCI was performed at 
any time during the follow-up period, the anti-coagulant regimen was at the investigator’s discretion. 
The  following  medications  were  not  permitted  concurrently  with  study  drug  administration:  heparin 
and heparinoids (standard or LMWH), direct thrombin inhibitors, oral anti-coagulant drugs (vitamin K 
antagonists),  fibrinolytic  agents,  dextrans.  The  use  of  NSAIDs  was  discouraged.  When  UFH  or 
LMWH was administered prior to randomisation, study drug administration did not begin until after 2 
or 6 hours, respectively. 
Statistical analyses and sample size 
OASIS-5  was  planned  as  a  non-inferiority  study  with  the  option  for  a  superiority  approach. 
Fondaparinux was to be considered non-inferior to enoxaparin if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of the hazard ratio did not exceed the 1.185 non-inferiority margin (i.e. delta). 
In  addition,  if  this  upper  limit  did  not  exceed  1,  fondaparinux  was  to  be  considered  statistically 
superior  to  enoxaparin.  The  possible  switch  to  superiority  testing  would  not  introduce  multiplicity 
testing due to the nature of this closed testing procedure. The non-inferiority margin was derived from 
a  meta-analysis  of  studies  that  demonstrated  the  benefit  of  adding  UFH  or  LMWH  as  short-term 
treatment  in  ASA-treated  subjects  [Eikelboom,  2000].  The  rationale  for  applying  the  1.185  non-
inferiority margin (derived from the composite of death or MI) to the triple outcome of death, MI, or 
RI  is  supported  by  FRISC  I  [Fragmin  during  Instability  in  Coronary  Artery  Disease  (FRISC)  study 
group, 1996]. In that study, there was a similar impact at Day 6 of LMWH vs placebo on the double 
endpoint of death or MI (relative risk [RR] 0.37, 95% CI 0.20;0.68) and the triple endpoint of death, 
MI or revascularisation for refractory/recurrent ischemia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.22;0.66).  
The study was to be completed when 1,414 subjects with primary events were observed. Based on an 
expected  pooled  event  rate  of  approximately  7%,  20,000  subjects  would  be  required,  which  would 
provide at least 85% power. 
Efficacy outcomes were evaluated in the “all randomised” population, the purest intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population, and a per protocol (PP) analysis was  also performed. The primary efficacy variable was 
analysed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model,  with  treatment  group  as  the  only  dependent 
variable.  To  investigate  the  consistency  of  the  treatment  effect  across  the  strata,  analyses  were  also 
performed for each stratum individually. In addition, the interaction of treatment effect with strata was 
investigated  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  with  terms  for  treatment  group,  strata  (as  a 
covariate)  and  the  treatment  by  strata  interaction.  All  safety  analyses  were  performed  on  the  “as 
treated”  (safety)  population  (those  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  medication  and  analysed 
according  to  the  treatment  actually  received).  The  primary  safety  endpoint  of  adjudicated  major 
bleeding was also analysed by using the “all randomised” population, as specified in the protocol.

Regarding  baseline  characteristics,  there  were  no  notable  differences  between  treatment  groups  in 
terms of baseline demographic or clinical characteristics, cardiovascular history, or time between onset 
of  qualifying  episode  of  chest  pain/symptoms  and  randomisation.  There  were  similar  proportions  of 
patients  enrolled  with  UA  (45%)  or  NSTEMI  (55%)  between  the  two  arms.  In  general,  most  of  the 
patients  were  treated  according  to  the  current  standards:  ASA  98%,  clopidogrel  62%,  ACE  70%, 
statins  78%,  beta-blockers  87%,  nitrates  80%.  The  concomitant  use  of  medications  was  similar 
between  groups.  In  terms  of  clinical  interventions,  63%  of  the  patients  underwent  coronary 
angiographies, which reflects an adequate management of ACS according to current clinical standards, 
and  34%  of  patients  had  PCI  following  UA  or  NSTEMI.  This  represents  an  important  subgroup  of 
patients.  The  percentage  of  patients  that  benefited  from  PCI  corresponds  to  the  usual  practice;  the 
results in this subgroup are of importance and are detailed in the corresponding sections of this report. 
Regarding  the  results  of  the  primary  endpoint,  OASIS-5  met  its  primary  objective  of  demonstrating 
that fondaparinux was non-inferior to enoxaparin in the acute treatment (median 5-6 days) of subjects 
with UA/NSTEMI in the early prevention of adjudicated death, MI or RI at Day 9. The upper bound of 
the  95%  CI  (1.13)  was  well  within  the  pre-defined  1.185  margin.  The  one-sided  non-inferiority  p-
value  was  0.003  and  the  upper  bound  of  the  99%  CI  was  1.17.  Importantly,  the  non-inferiority 
conclusion  was  also  evident  in  the  more  conservative  PP  population,  in  which  the  hazard  ratio  and 
upper  bound  of  the  95%  CI  were  identical  to  those  of  the  All  Randomised  population.  In  addition, 
several sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint were conducted which supported the conclusions 
of non-inferiority, indicating the robustness of the findings.

Regarding secondary outcomes, there was evidence of a modest, non-significant reduction in the risk 
of death/MI/RI favouring fondaparinux, initially evident at Day 14 and sustained up to Day 180.

There  was  a  tendency  to  areduction  in  the  risk  of  the  primary  endpoint  at  all  time  points  in  the 
fondaparinux  group  relative  to  the  enoxaparin  group,  as  suggested  by  the  separation  in  the  Kaplan-
Meier curves below.

While the incidence of the primary endpoint was similar in both treatment groups at Day 9 (primary 
time point), a 6% reduction in favour of fondaparinux was observed at Day 14. The benefit observed 
with fondaparinux was sustained at Days 30, 90, and 180 with a consistent 7% risk reduction.

There was a consistent favourable trend in each of the components of the composite primary endpoint 
that  persisted  up  to  Day  180  (results  not  shown).  The  incidence  of  adjudicated  MI  was  numerically 
similar between groups at Day 9, but then appears to be lower in the fondaparinux group compared to 
the  enoxaparin  group  from  Day  14  onwards  (results  not  shown).  The  proportion  of  subjects 
experiencing RI (as adjudicated) was similar in both treatment groups at all time points.

Fondaparinux was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality relative to enoxaparin. Although 
the incidence of death was similar in the two treatment groups at Day 9, a clinically meaningful risk 
reduction of 13% in favour of fondaparinux was observed at Day 14. By Day 30, fondaparinux was 
associated  with  a  statistically  significant  17%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  all-cause  mortality.  The 
mortality  benefit  observed  with  fondaparinux  was  consistent  and  sustained  at  Day  90  and  180  with 
10% and 11% risk reductions, respectively with the upper bounds of the 95% CI’s close to unity. 
The  event  rates  for  all  adjudicated  strokes  were  low  at  all  time  points,  with  the  incidence  of  stroke 
numerically lower in the fondaparinux group. By Day 180, there was a 22% reduction in the risk of 
stroke  (p=0.039).  This  relative  benefit  appeared  to  be  due  to  a  reduction  in  ischemic  rather  than 
haemorrhagic strokes.

The composite secondary end-point death, MI or stroke was reduced by 11% at Day 180 (p=0.007). 
Subgroup analyses 
No significant interactions were found according to age, sex, BMI or Creatinine Clearance; OASIS-5 
seems to have a satisfactory internal consistency with a rather homogeneous response across the usual 
patient subgroups.

Analyses  of  the  primary  outcome  were  also  performed  by  anticoagulant  treatment  received  (prior 
heparin use and concomitant anti-coagulant), by qualifying Diagnosis and by PCI and CABG Surgery. 
An excess event rate was observed at Day 9 in both treatment groups based on prior use of heparin and 
concomitant use of thienopyridines or i.v. GPIIb/IIIa compared to the sub groups not receiving these 
agents. These results are consistent with the greater use of these therapies in higher risk patients. 
Regarding concomitant interventions (PCI in 34% of the included patients or CABG surgery in 10%), 
results  on  the  primary  endpoint  showed  that  the  percentage  of  events  was  twice  higher  in  patients 
undergoing PCI and CABG compared to patients that did not undergo these interventions.  
The  overall  response  on  the  primary  composite  end  point  is  not  homogeneous  across  the  group  of 
patients undergoing or not PCI, as shown below.

At day 9, in the group of patients not having PCI, the point estimate is in favour of fondaparinux (4.2 
% versus 4.4%); in PCI patients the point estimate is in favour of enoxaparin [8.2% versus 8.8%; HR 
1.08 (0.92, 1.27)]. This divergent response is still apparent at Day 30. In PCI patients, the incidence of 
events occurring between the day of PCI and Day 30 was 8.6% on fondaparinux versus 8.4% on 
enoxaparin.. When considering the components of the composite end point, in the PCI group, there is a 
higher rate of MI, death being equal in the two groups (at Day 9, MI/death 5.7% fondaparinux versus 
5.4% enoxaparin and death 1.1% in both groups). The treatment by covariate interaction (PCI and no-
PCI subgroups) is non-significant (p=0.232), however due to the known low power of the test, this 
lack of interaction is not entirely reassuring. The heterogeneous efficacy response across this 
important subgroup of patients is of concern and is consistent with the complications during PCI in the 
fondaparinux patients, further detailed in the safety section below.Stent deployment during PCI was 
high (approximately 90% of patients), with bare metal stents predominating. This pattern was common 
across the majority of countries. 
Clopidogrel was administered in 70% and 59% of PCIs in OASIS 5 and 6, respectively. The median 
pre-PCI dose of clopidogrel was 75mg in OASIS 5 and 300mg (i.e. a loading dose) in OASIS 6, 
consistent with the difference in the timing of when the procedure is conducted relative to diagnosis in 
the two study populations.

Approximately  10%  of  patients  discontinued  the  study  in  both  groups.  Discontinuation  for  bleeding 
events  was  higher  in  enoxaparin  (4.7%)  than  in  fondaparinux  group  (1.6%),  and  discontinuation  for 
other reasons was higher in fondaparinux (5.9%) than in enoxaparin group (4.6%).

* “other bleeding” included any clinically-significant bleeding reported by the investigator that did not meet the criteria of a major or minor 
bleed.  
Adjudicated  major  bleeding  occurred  in  2.1%  of  fondaparinux  subjects  and  4.1%  of  enoxaparin 
subjects in the All Randomised population, translating into a 48% lower risk of major bleeding with 
fondaparinux (p<0.001). The results for the As Treated population (safety population) were virtually 
identical to those observed for the All Randomized population.  
On-therapy, similar results were observed in the safety population. Adjudicated major bleed occurred 
with incidence of 3.9% in enoxaparin and 1.8% in fondaparinux group.  
Severe  bleeding  complications  according  to  the  TIMI  criteria  were  reported  at  day  9  in  2.6%  in 
enoxaparin group compared to 1.5% in fondaparinux group. The incidences of bleeding as reported by 
the  investigator  were  also  consistent  with  those  observed  in  adjudicated  major  bleed  and  severe 
bleeding according to the TIMI criteria (1.5% vs 2.6% in fondaparinux and enoxaparin, respectively).  
Clinical implication of bleeding 
Subjects who had a major or minor bleeding during hospitalisation had a significantly higher rate of 
death  at  day  30  than  subjects  without  a  bleeding  event,  regardless  of  treatment  group.  Two  ad-hoc 
analyses  were  performed  by  the  Applicant  to  assess  the  clinical  implications  of  bleeding  and  to 
investigate whether the difference in mortality between the treatment groups observed at the end of the 
study may be related to the lower rate of bleeding with fondaparinux. 
The first analysis looked at the rate of death up to Day 30 in patients who experienced a major/minor 
bleeding event up to day 9 compared to the overall population.  
Table 10 Incidence of death by day 30 in subjects who experienced a bleeding event by day 9: All randomised 
population. 
There was a higher incidence of death in patients who experienced a bleeding event compared to the 
overall  randomised  population  in  both  groups,  and  the  highest  incidence  of  death  was  reported  in 
patients who experienced a major bleed. No difference was reported between fondaparinux group and 
enoxaparin  group  regarding  death  in  patients  who  experienced  “any  bleed”  (8.7%  in  both  groups), 
however  a  small  increase  was  reported  in  enoxaparin  patients  who  experienced  a  major  bleed  than 
fondaparinux patients (13.7% vs 11.2% respectively).  
The second analysis looked at patients who died up to day 30, in order to determine what proportion of 
patients had experienced a clinically important bleeding event up to day 9.

population 
1: any bleeding: major or minor bleed as reported by investigator. 
In  both  treatment  groups,  patients  who  died  by  day  30  experienced  numerically  higher  rates  of 
bleeding  up  to  and  including  day  9,  compared  to  the  overall  as  treated  study  population.  A  higher 
incidence of bleeding in patients who died by day 30 was observed in enoxaparin group compared to 
fondaparinux group. 
Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs)  were  reported  in  4%  (360/9979)  in  fondaparinux  group  and  5% 
(520/9969) in enoxaparin group. The most frequent on-therapy SAEs were puncture site haemorrhage 
(0.35%  in  fondaparinux  vs  1.8%  in  enoxaparin),  catheter-related  complications  (0.34%  vs  0.11% 
respectively),  post-procedural  haemorrhage  (0.34%  vs  0.23%  respectively)  and  coronary  artery 
thrombosis (0.16% vs 0.05%). 
Deaths 
Events resulting in death were reported as a component of the primary efficacy endpoint and were not 
intended  to  be  reported  as  SAEs.  However,  215  out  of  the  1,212  deaths  reported  in  the  primary 
efficacy results were reported as fatal SAEs, of which 102 deaths (1.02%) occurred with fondaparinux 
(27  (0.27%)  occurred  while  on  therapy)  and  113  (1.13%)  with  enoxaparin  (38  (0.38%)  while  on 
therapy). The causes of death were similar in both groups, with an exception regarding coronary artery 
thrombosis which occurred only in fondaparinux patients and digestive haemorrhage which were more 
frequent in enoxaparin on therapy.  
Death up to day 30 was numerically increased in enoxaparin group with 0.7% (66/9969) compared to 
0.5% (54/9979) in fondaparinux group. 
GI  haemorrhage  (3  vs  2),  retroperitoneal  haemorrhage  (4  vs  0),  haemorrhagic  shock  (2  vs  0), 
haematoma nos (1 vs 0) and haemorrhage NOS (1 vs 0) were more frequent in enoxaparin group. 
Intracranial haemorrhage, including haemorrhagic stroke, were similar in both group (4 patients each). 
SAEs other than death 
A  total  of  819  patients  experienced  a  SAE;  3.34%  (334/9979)  occurred  in  fondaparinux  group  and 
4.85% (485/9969) in enoxaparin group. Of which 1.6% (163/9979) in fondaparinux group and 2.8% 
(285/9969) in enoxaparin were drug-related. 
Drug-related catheter related complications (0.27% vs. 0.05%) and coronary artery thrombosis (0.14% 
vs  0.04%)  were  more  frequent  with  fondaparinux.  Other  drug-related  bleeding  SAEs  were  more 
frequent  with  enoxaparin  than  with  fondaparinux  group:  puncture  site  haemorrhage  (1.00%  vs. 
0.29%),  injection  site  haemorrhage  (0.16%  vs.  0.01%)  retroperitoneal  haemorrhage  (0.16%  vs. 
0.05%), retroperitoneal haematoma (0.08% vs 0) and vascular pseudoaneurysm (0.28% vs 0.12%).  
Thrombocytopenia was reported as a SAEs in 7 patients in fondaparinux and 9 in enoxaparin up to day 
30, of which 5 (0.07%) on fondaparinux and 7 (0.09%) on enoxaparin occurred during the on-therapy 
period.  Three  patients  experienced  HIT  in  fondaparinux  group.  All  patients  underwent  a  CABG 
surgery, and one of them underwent a coronary angiography before the CABG surgery. Two patients 
received LMWH during the 7 days before randomisation and UFH during the initial hospitalisation as 
well  as  fondaparinux  for  8  days.  The  third  patient  received  a  single  dose  of  fondaparinux  and 
enoxaparin-placebo  on  day  1  and  a  second  dose  of  enoxaparin-placebo  on  day  2;  he  experienced 
thrombocytopenia and HIT on the fourth day. Normal platelet count was reported for all patients. It

was unknown for all patients whether they received UFH during surgery. HIT test was positive in two 
patients and not reported in one. In one case the patient received a platelet infusion. The outcome was 
favourable for all patients. HIT was assessed as non-related to fondaparinux.   
Discontinuation 
Discontinuation  due  to  AEs  occurred  in  115  (1.15%)  patients  in  fondaparinux  group  and  150  in 
enoxaparin  group  (1.50%).  Discontinuation  in  fondaparinux  group  was  due  to:  renal  insufficiency 
(0.08% in fondaparinux vs 0.01% in enoxaparin), cardiac disorders including rhythm disorders, angina 
pectoris and coronary stenosis and thrombosis (0.19% vs 0.17% respectively), skin disorders including 
allergic dermatitis and rash (0.06% vs 0.03% respectively).

haemorrhage, catheter site haemorrhage and pyrexia (0.19% vs 0.07% respectively). 
to  vascular  disorders 
Other Adverse Events (AEs) 
A total of 24% of patients in fondaparinux group experienced an AE compared to 28% in enoxaparin 
group.  The  following  AEs  were  reported  with  similar  incidence  in  both  groups:  headache,  pyrexia, 
chest  pain,  dizziness,  atrial  fibrillation,  and  anaemia.  Of  these,  headache,  chest  pain  and  atrial 
fibrillation were reported in at least 1% of subjects on fondaparinux. 
The following AEs were more frequent in enoxaparin group than in fondaparinux group: puncture site 
haemorrhage (1.23% vs 0.37%), haematoma (0.79% vs 0.59%), vascular pseudo aneurysm (0.77% vs 
0.4%) and increased hepatic enzymes (0.16% vs 0.05%). The followings AEs were more frequent in 
fondaparinux  group  than  in  enoxaparin:  angina  pectoris  including  post-infarction  angina,  unstable 
angina  and  Printzmetal  angina  (0.8%  vs  0.5%),  coronary  artery  thrombosis  (0.17%  vs  0.06% 
respectively), and catheter-related complications (0.34% vs 0.11% respectively). 
Thrombocytopenia  occurred  in  1.2%  (12)  fondaparinux  group,  and  in  1.7%  (17)  enoxaparin  group. 
in  fondaparinux  group,  and  1  patient  experienced 
One  patient  experienced  pancytopenia 
thrombocytemia in enoxaparin group. 
Four patients experienced HIT in fondaparinux patients during the period including day 30, of which 
one occurred during the on therapy period. Three of these cases were serious and are described under 
section “SAEs other than death”. 
Safety in special populations 
Fondaparinux  had  a  lower  risk  of  major  bleeding  compared  to  enoxaparin  regardless  of  sub-group, 
demonstrating the robustness of this clinically-important finding. Expectedly, the incidence of major 
bleeding in both treatment groups increased with known risk factors such as to age, female gender and 
decreased  creatinine  clearance.  The  incidence  of  major  bleeding  in  fondaparinux  subjects  increased 
with decreasing body weight, although it should be noted that the number of events and subjects in the 
<50kg subgroup was small (<1%). This increase was not evident in enoxaparin subjects; however, the 
enoxaparin dose regimen utilized weight adjustment.  
As expected, the incidence of bleeding was higher in patients taking concomitant anti-platelet, heparin, 
GPIIb/IIIa. An exception was noted for patients who were not taking ASA, where major bleeding was 
more frequent compared to those with concomitant ASA. This finding should be taken with caution, as 
only  a  small  number  of  patients  were  not  taking  concomitant  ASA.  No  difference  was  noted  in 
fondaparinux  group  regarding  PCI  procedure;  however,  in  enoxaparin  group  a  higher  incidence  was 
noted in patients undergoing a PCI procedure compared to those who did not. Finally, the incidence of 
major  bleeding  was  higher  but  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  in  patients  who  had  undergone  a 
CABG surgery.

Safety during PCI 
The incidence of peri-procedural complications in subjects who underwent PCI while receiving active 
study  drug  was  similar  between  the  treatment  groups  (15.9%  vs.  17.3%  of  PCIs  performed,  for 
fondaparinux and enoxaparin, respectively) and is shown in the table below.

Fondaparinux was associated with fewer vascular access site bleeding events compared to enoxaparin 
(3.2%  vs.  7.2%  of  PCIs  performed),  which  is  consistent  with  the  lower  bleeding  risk  observed  with 
fondaparinux in the overall population. This treatment difference in favour of fondaparinux was driven 
predominantly by large haematomas (1.7% vs. 4.7% of PCIs performed).  
Worryingly  however,  coronary  complications  tended  to  occur  more  frequently  with  fondaparinux 
relative to enoxaparin (12.7% vs. 10.0% of PCIs performed). In addition to the more frequent guiding 
catheter thrombus (1.0% vs. 0.3%), more disturbing are the higher rates of coronary abrupt closure and 
new angiographic thrombus (respectively 1.7% and 3.2% in the fondaparinux group). 
Vascular  site  bleeding  is  usually  clinically  manageable  and  less  of  a  concern  than  coronary 
complications. The occurrence of catheter thrombus (unblinded), an unexpected AE during the course 
of the study, prompted an amendement of the study protocol to emphasise the correct administration of 
fondaparinux intravenously during the PCI and to reiterate that heparinised catheter flushes could be 
used..  
Proposed management strategy for fondaparinux-treated patients undergoing PCI: Use of UFH 
Acknowledging  the  observed  complications  in  fondaparinux  patients  undergoing  PCI  observed  in 
OASIS-5  and  OASIS-6  (see  later  in  this  report)  and  aware  of  the  fact  that  UA/NSTEMI  patients 
treated with s.c. fondaparinux may need to undergo PCI, the Applicant proposes that they should not 
receive fonadaparinux as the sole anticoagulant during the procedure but rather be managed according 
to standard medical practice and in line with treatment guidelines, using UFH as the adjunct for the 
procedure. UFH is established in clinical practice and is recommended in the ESC guidelines as the 
anticoagulant  of  choice  during  PCI,  with  its  primary  function  being  the  avoidance  of  thrombus 
formation on the PCI hardware and at the site of injury/plaque rupture in the coronary vessel. The use 
of adjunctive UFH during PCI to prevent thrombus formation in the PCI catheter is consistent with the 
following clinical data from 3,849 procedures performed in OASIS 5 and 6, plus recent in vitro data: 
18

There were no instances of guiding catheter thrombus reported in 1848 UFH-treated subjects in 
OASIS  6  who  underwent  primary  PCI  for  the  index  event  (1850  procedures),  nor  in  1849 
subjects  (1999  procedures)  in  both  OASIS  5  and  6  who  underwent  PCI  after  the  study  drug 
treatment period and who were anticoagulated according to local practice (UFH expected) 
In  vitro  data  have  shown  that  thrombus  formation  induced  by  PCI  catheters  occurs  via 
activation of the contact (intrinsic) pathway and is mediated by thrombin and inhibited by UFH. 
Due to its selectivity for factor Xa and inability to inhibit any residual thrombin, fondaparinux is 
unable  to  inhibit  contact  thrombosis  in  the  presence  of  catheter.  Not  unexpectedly  due  to  its 
specificity,  higher  concentrations  of  fondaparinux  could  not  overcome  thrombus  formation 
induced  by  the  catheter.  Clinically-relevant  doses  of  UFH  or  bivalirudin  (a  direct  thrombin 
inhibitor)  in  the  presence  of  fondaparinux  were  able  to  inhibit  clot  formation  in  presence  of 
catheters. 
Safety of UFH during PCI in Fondaparinux-treated Patients  
• 
The  CHMP  expressed  concern  regarding  the  safety  of  the  Applicant’s  proposed  management  of 
fondaparinux-treated patients undergoing PCI with adjunct open-label UFH, as this has not been has 
not been formally studied in UA/NSTEMI patients. Further to a request form  CHMP, the  Applicant 
has provided a detailed analysis of bleeding events in patients undergoing PCI with adjunct open label 
UFH included in the clinical development of fondaparinux – see below.

Note: Percentages represent the proportion of events based on the number of procedures performed. 
Note: Bleeding events occurred on or after day of PCI 
1. Control was UFH or placebo in OASIS 6, and enoxaparin in PENTUA and OASIS 5 
In fondaparinux-treated STEMI subjects undergoing non-primary PCI in OASIS 6 and receiving open-
label  UFH  according  to  a  protocol-defined  algorithm  and  in  line  with  the  proposed  management 
strategy  (238  procedures),  there  was  no  evidence  of  an  increased  bleeding  risk  compared  to  control 
subjects  (224  procedures).  This  low  bleeding  risk  was  consistently  observed  regardless  of  the  time 
from the last dose of fondaparinux to the start of PCI. Further, there was a low risk of peri-procedural 
coronary  complications  and  no  catheter  thrombus  events  in  subjects  who  received  UFH  prior  to  the 
PCI, and comparable rates of death or recurrent MI up to Day 30 relative to control subjects. 
A  further  854  subjects  received  open-label  UFH  in  conjunction  with  i.v.  fondaparinux  during  PCI 
(OASIS  5;  481  procedures  and  primary  PCI  in  OASIS  6;  374  procedures).  In  PENTUA,  61 
UA/NSTEMI subjects receiving one of 4 fondaparinux doses (2.5, 4.0, 8.0 or 12.0 mg s.c. once daily) 
underwent  PCI  with  adjunctive,  open-label  UFH  administered  within  24  hours  of  the  previous 
fondaparinux dose (61 procedures), consistent with the proposed PCI management strategy.  
In  these  3  settings,  based  on  experience  in  916  PCIs,  UFH  does  not  appear  to  increase  the  risk  of 
bleeding  in  fondaparinux  subjects  relative  to  control,  even  though  the  level  of  anticoagulation  was 
greater than in the proposed management strategy. In addition, when administered before PCI, UFH 
appears to minimise the risk of catheter thrombus. In these cases, 2 events of catheter thrombus were 
reported in fondaparinux subjects, with one subject receiving a dose of UFH (5 IU/kg) and the other 
receiving 44 IU/kg without upfront GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, which is lower than that recommended in the 
treatment  guidelines.  Thus,  combining  the  catheter  thrombus  events  that  occurred  in  all  PCIs 
performed  in  fondaparinux-treated  patients  receiving  pre-procedural  UFH,  administered  at  doses 
19
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended  in  the  treatment  guidelines,  there  was  only  one  reported  event  in  397  PCIs  (0.25%). 
Notably, this rate is comparable to that seen in enoxaparin patients in OASIS 5. 
The  CHMP  consulted  with  the  SAG  CVS  whether  the  above  evidence  was  sufficient  to  support  the 
proposed switch to UFH during PCI both in terms of safety and efficacy. The SAG was of the opinion 
that  the  available  evidence  is  insufficient  to  recommend  the  strategy  proposed  by  the  company.  In 
particular,  they  were  not  convinced  that  the  safety  advantage  with  fondaparinux  (over  enoxaparin) 
would be maintained when the UFH is added in PCI patients and were of the opinion that a further 
study was required to address the doubts regarding the proposed switch to UFH during PCI procedure. 
•  Post-Authorisation Safety (PASS) Study  
Acknowledging the limited safety experience of using UFH as an adjunct during non-primary PCI in 
fondaparinux,  the  Applicant  proposes  to  carry  out  a  PASS  using  the  OASIS  5  inclusion/exclusion 
criteria (see figure below). The primary study objective will be to evaluate the safety in fondaparinux-
treated  patients  undergoing  PCI  receiving  adjunctive  therapy  with  one  of  two  regimens  of  i.v.  UFH 
(standard and reduced dose) as the PCI adjunct in fondaparinux-treated patients. Secondary objectives 
will  be  i)  to  confirm  that  the  rate  of  bleeding  in  fondaparinux-treated  patients  undergoing  PCI 
receiving adjunctive therapy with UFH is comparable to that observed in OASIS 5, and ii) to evaluate 
the effectiveness of anticoagulation during PCI and clinical outcomes to 30 days.

The adequacy of the proposed PASS was discussed at length by the CHMP, particularly with regards 
as to whether the study should also look into the efficacy of the proposed use of UFH in fondaparinux-
treated PCI patients. The CHMP sought the advice of the SAG CVS, who was of the opinion that the 
study should look into safety and efficacy and hence should be available in before the granting of the 
requested indication.  
Further to the concerns of CHMP and the SAG, the Applicant submitted an alternative study design 
including  an  enoxaparin  comparator.  However,  this  comparative  study  design  raises  logistical 
difficulties  due  the  timing  of  randomisation  that  inclusion  of  a  comparator  requires  and  necessitates 
the PCI population be evaluated via a sub-group analysis. More critically, the study raises issues on 
the  population  that  should  be  included,  given  the  difference  in  bleeding  risk  and  long  term  efficacy 
outcomes favouring fondaparinux, as well as the new ESC guideline recommendation of fondaparinux 
over enoxaparin. The advantages and disadvantages of both study designs are summarised below.

Table14 Comparison of the Two PASS Designs 
Current Study 
Comparator (enoxaparin) Study 
Advantages 
•  Evaluates the most relevant patients based on 
Advantages 
•  Builds on existing data from OASIS 5 with 
the proposed indicated population 
•  Randomised population includes only 
patients undergoing PCI  
Disadvantages 
•  Limitations of a comparison to historical data 
enoxaparin 
Disadvantages 
•  Requires restriction of the study population to exclude 
patients with a risk of bleeding - would not reflect the 
patients likely to receive fondaparinux in clinical 
practice and would underestimate the bleeding risk 
i.v. enoxaparin during PCI would be necessary to 
comply with ESC recommendations – but is not 
approved by regulatory agencies 
• 
•  Evaluation in PCI patients would be a sub-group 
analysis. 
Given the highlighted difficulties that would be encountered with the comparator (enoxaparin) study, 
the CHMP agrees that the PASS study proposed by the MAH is a satisfactory alternative. 
OASIS-6: fondaparinux in the treatment of STEMI 
This was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial comparing the safety and efficacy 
of 2.5mg fondaparinux versus a control of usual care (UFH or Placebo) in subjects with STEMI.  
The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  whether  fondaparinux  was  superior  to  a  control  reflecting  a 
usual  care  (UFH  or  placebo)  in  preventing  death  or  recurrent  MI  (re-MI)  up  to  Day  30  in  subjects 
presenting  with  STEMI.  The  secondary  efficacy  objectives  were  to  evaluate  whether  there  was  a 
beneficial  effect  of  fondaparinux  compared  to  control  in  preventing  death  or  re-MI  (Days  9,  90  and 
180)  and  to  evaluate  whether  fondaparinux  was  superior  to  control  in  preventing  death,  re-MI  and 
refractory ischemia (Day 30).  
Regarding  treatment  allocation,  subjects  were  randomised  to  one  of  two  strata  based  on  the 
reperfusion  strategy  (indication  for  UFH  or  not)  selected  by  the  investigator  prior  to  randomisation. 
Study drug was to be administered as soon as possible after randomisation. 
• 
Stratum 1: no indication for UFH;  
Subjects  who  received  a  non-fibrin  specific  thrombolytic  [e.g.  streptokinase  (STK)]  prior  to 
arrival in the ER were eligible for randomisation in Stratum 1 immediately, provided they did 
not meet the exclusion criterion with regard to heparin pre-randomisation. 
Treatment was fondaparinux 2.5mg i.v. bolus vs placebo just after randomisation, followed by 
fondaparinux 2.5mg s.c. or placebo for 8 days or until hospital discharge, whichever was earlier. 
• 
Stratum 2: indication for UFH. A number of different scenarios were envisaged: 
•  Subjects  treated  with  a  Fibrin-Specific  Thrombolytic  OR  not  scheduled  for  Reperfusion 
Therapy (PCI or Thrombolytic)  
Immediately  prior  (approx.  15min)  to  start  of  thrombolytic  therapy  OR  just  after 
randomisation, patients received fondaparinux 2.5mg i.v. bolus vs. UFH 60 IU/kg (max 4000 
IU) i.v. bolus, followed by fondaparinux 2.5mg s.c. for up to 8 days or discharge vs UFH i.v. 
12 IU/kg/hr (max 1,000 IU/h) for 24 to 48 hours. 
•  Subjects undergoing Primary PCI 
Immediately prior to procedure: fondaparinux 2.5 or 5 mg i.v. bolus vs UFH 65 or 100 IU/kg 
i.v.  bolus,  (depending  on  the  upfront  use  or  not  of  i.v.  GPIIb/IIIa  inhibitors,  and  on  pre-

randomisation or not of UFH), followed by: fondaparinux 2.5mg s.c. or placebo for up to 8 
days or discharge. 
•  Subjects undergoing non-primary PCI (elective or rescue catheterisation) or CABG 
In case of PCI after randomisation, the procedure was delayed where possible for 24 hours 
after  the  last  s.c.  fondaparinux/placebo  injection  and  3  hours  after  UFH/placebo  infusion. 
The  PCI  was  then  performed  as  per  local  practice  with  open-label  UFH  and  GPIIb/IIIa 
inhibitor.  
If PCI was performed <24 hours after the last injection of fondaparinux/placebo or within 3 
hours  after  discontinuation  of  UFH/placebo,  the  subject  was  unblinded  and  treated  with 
open-label UFH and GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors. 
  The  UFH/placebo  infusion  was  not  restarted,  if  possible,  after  the  PCI.  The  first 
fondaparinux/ 
placebo s.c. injection after the PCI, was 18-24 hours after the last fondaparinux/placebo s.c 
injection (pre-PCI) and at least 3 hours after sheath removal. The use of any GPIIb/IIIa after 
the PCI was left to the investigator's discretion. 
If CABG was required, study drug was temporarily interrupted preferably 24 hours prior to 
scheduled CABG surgery and restarted 48 hours post CABG, if possible. 
Study drug was administered for up to 8 days on a background of standard care. Subject follow-up was 
for a minimum of 90 days and a maximum of 180 days, or until death. 
OASIS 6 included subjects presenting within 12 hours (amended from 24 hours based on the results of 
the CREATE trial) with signs and symptoms of acute MI and definite ECG changes indicating STEMI 
[persistent ST-elevation (≥0.2mV in two contiguous precordial leads, or ≥0.1mV in at least two limb 
leads),  or  new  left  bundle  branch  block,  or  ECG  changes  indicating  true  posterior  MI].  Eligible 
subjects included those with planned reperfusion with one of several thrombolytic agents (i.e., STK, 
urokinase,  alteplase,  reteplase,  tenecteplase)  or  with  primary  PCI,  as  well  as  subjects  who  were  not 
eligible for reperfusion therapy (e.g. late presentation or contra-indication to reperfusion therapy). The 
key exclusion criteria were: subjects with severe renal insufficiency (i.e. serum creatinine ≥3mg/dl or 
265μmol/l),  subjects  who  were  currently  receiving  an  oral  anticoagulant  agent  with  an  INR  >1.8, 
subjects who had LMWH or >5000IU UFH administered prior to randomisation, a contraindication to 
anticoagulant  therapy  such  as  high  risk  of  bleeding  or  active  bleeding  and  subjects  who  had  pre-
randomisation PCI for the index event or pre-randomisation rescue PCI. 
Regarding  concomitant  medication,  all  subjects  were  to  receive  ASA  OD  (75-325mg)  indefinitely. 
Furthermore subjects were concurrently managed with standard medical therapy such as nitrates, ACE 
inhibitors,  β-blockers,  anti-platelet  agents  (i.e.  thienopyridines,  GPIIb/IIIa  inhibitors).  Thrombolytics 
were allowed and were to be administered within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms. The concomitant 
use of LMWH, direct thrombin inhibitors or oral anticoagulants (i.e. vitamin K antagonists) during the 
treatment period was not allowed. In addition, UFH other than study medication or that permitted per 
protocol during non-primary PCI was not allowed. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the first occurrence of the composite of death (all-cause mortality) 
or  re-MI  at  Day  30.  Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  additional  assessments  of  the  primary 
endpoint at Days 9, 90 and 180 and the first occurrence of any component of the composite of death, 
recurrent MI or RI (as adjudicated) up to Days 9, 30, 90, and 180.  
22

The  primary  safety  endpoint  was  the  first  incidence  of  adjudicated  severe  haemorrhage  (modified 
TIMI criteria) up to Day 9 – see definitions below.  
A sample size of 12,000 subjects allowed 84% power to detect a 15% difference in relative reduction 
in the hazard ratio given a control event rate of 12% with an alpha level of 5% (2-sided). All subjects 
randomised  into  the  study  (“All  Randomised”  population)  were  analysed  in  all  safety  and  efficacy 
analyses.  In  addition,  safety  analyses  were  carried  out  according  to  the  treatment  subjects  actually 
received (“As Treated” population). A subject was excluded from the “As Treated” population if they 
had no record of taking study medication. Protocol violations were examined to evaluate the quality of 
the study conduct; however, a “Per-protocol” population was not used for analysis in this study. 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  analysed  using  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  for  the  overall 
population,  stratified  by  indication  of  UFH.  Fondaparinux  was  considered  superior  to  control 
treatment  if  the  upper  limit  of  the  two-sided  95%  CI  of  the  hazard  ratio  did  not  exceed  1 
(corresponding to a p-value of 0.05). To investigate the consistency of the treatment effect across the 
strata, analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazards model for each stratum individually, 
with  treatment  group  as  the  only  dependent  variable.  In  addition,  the  interaction  of  treatment  effect 
with strata was investigated using a Cox proportional hazards model with terms for treatment group, 
strata (as a covariate) and the treatment by strata interaction.

the 2 strata, more East European (43%) and Asian (40%) subjects were included in Stratum 1, while 
more East European (51.5%) and West European (23%) subjects were included in Stratum 2. 
There  were  no  notable  differences  in  baseline  data  between  the  treatment  groups  in  terms  of 
demographic or clinical characteristics, or cardiovascular history, or time between onset of qualifying 
episode  of  chest  pain/symptoms  and  randomisation.  As  in  OASIS-5,  the  most  frequently  used 
medications during the initial hospitalisation period were ASA, beta-blockers, nitrates, statins, ACEi, 
and  clopidogrel.  The  concomitant  use  of  medications  was  similar  between  the  groups  within  each 
study.

The long-term use of agents and interventions that improve morbidity outcomes was balanced between 
treatment groups and the percentages of subjects who underwent PCI or CABG surgery at the follow-
up visits were similar in both studies. Approximately 45% of subjects underwent thrombolysis, and 
31% primary PCI as the initial reperfusion strategy for the index event, while 24% of subjects did not 
undergo any initial reperfusion.  
Relevance of the OASIS-6 population to EU clinical practice 
This was one of the main points discussed by the CHMP. The MAH was asked to clarify if the OASIS 
6  study  population  could  be  considered  as  representative  of  the  target  population,  taking  current 
treatment  practice  and  guideline  recommendations  into  account.  For  example,  only  53%  of  the 
included patients  were  allocated  to  UFH  treatment  while,  according  to  European  Heart  Survey  data, 
85% of the target population is treated with UFH. The percentage of patients that underwent PCI, the 
best reperfusion strategy in STEMI according to guidelines, appears low compared to usual practice in 
Europe. In addition, a rather large proportion (84 %) of the studied patients undergoing thrombolysis 
were treated with non-fibrin-selective thrombolytics (mainly STK) and only 16% with fibrin-specific 
thrombolytics,  which  is  not  representative  of  current  thrombolytic  treatment,  when  mainly  fibrin-
specific thrombolytics are used. Moreover, the surprisingly high mortality rate observed in this study 
raised further concern regarding the possible differences in background therapy and treatment care as 
compared to current treatment practices in the Western population. 
Further  to  a  request  from  CHMP  the  Applicant  submitted  a  thorough  investigation  of  contemporary 
European  registries  (notably  ACS-II  and  GRACE).  According  to  the  Applicant,  the  population  in 
OASIS-6 trial is consistent with such registries (patient characteristics, use of  concomitant therapies 
and  mortality  rates  were  comparable)  and 
therapy  reflects  ESC 
recommendations.  The  company  is  of  the  opinion  that  non-fibrin  specific  thrombolytics  are  still 
the  use  of  reperfusion

widely  used  in  Europe,  especially  Eastern  Europe  and  the  UK.  In  OASIS-6  the  use  of  non-fibrin 
specific  thrombolytics  varied  across  the  European  Union  and  was  consistent  with  country  specific 
data. Also the UFH use in OASIS-6 is consistent with ESC guideline recommendations. 
The  CHMP  put  this  question  to  the  SAG  CVS,  who  acknowledged  the  differences  between  the 
OASIS-6  population  and  the  populations  included  in  the  registries  but  also  pointed  out  that  registry 
data are populated to a large extent by active, highly motivated large centres with facilities for primary 
PCI  in  STEMI  patients.  Thus,  despite  the  increasing  availability  of  primary  PCI,  the  majority  of 
patients with STEMI in EU are still treated with thrombolytic therapy. It was stated that STK is still 
used  in  many  European  countries  (Eastern  Europe,  UK)  although  the  precise  rates  of  non-fibrin 
specific  and  fibrin-specific  thrombolytics  prescribed  in  Europe  are  uncertain  since  current  European 
registries  and  studies  might  not  accurately  reflect  usual  practice  in  Europe  which  is  probably  fairly 
heterogeneous. Moreover, it was suggested that too much attention should not be paid to the type of 
thrombolytic therapy often used in EU, as the pathophysiological mechanism is similar irrespective of 
the type of the thrombolytic agent. 
Although  firm  evidence-based  conclusions  are  not  possible  in  this  area,  the  SAG  concluded  that 
despite  the  population  of  patients  included  in  OASIS-6  (notably  in  Stratum  1)  not  being  fully 
representative of the target population, the study results could still be applicable to European patients.  
Results of the primary endpoint 
Fondaparinux  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  and  statistically  significant  14%  risk  reduction 
relative  to  control  in  the  primary  endpoint  (HR  0.86,  95%  CI:  0.77,  0.96;  p=0.008)  in  the  overall 
randomised population, as shown below.

in Stratum 1 (UFH not indicated) in the prevention of death or re-MI with a 20% risk reduction at Day 
30 [HR 0.80; 95% CI: 0.069, 0.93; p=0.003). However, fondaparinux failed to demonstrate superiority 
over UFH (stratum 2). The interaction test between treatment and strata was not significant (p=0.11), 
indicating that the results of both strata were consistent with the overall results.

Fondaparinux  was  superior  to  placebo  in  reducing  the  risk  of  death  and  re-MI  at  all  time  points 
assessed, as by the hazard ratios and CIs and by the separation of Kaplan-Meier curves. The benefit of 
fondaparinux was observed at Day 9 with a significant 18% risk reduction and was sustained through 
Day 180 (risk reduction 12%). Again this overall risk reduction was significant in Stratum 1 but not in 
Stratum 2.

The separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves showed a different profile in Stratum 2 relative to Stratum 
1  (shown  above).  Event  rates  were  generally  lower  than  in  Stratum  1  and  there  was  very  little 
separation of the survival curves until around Day 30, suggesting non-superiority to UFH up to that 
time. However, after Day 30, the curves separate showing a profile consistent with the overall results.

In  the  overall  “All  Randomised  Population”,  there  was  a  reduction  in  the  risk  of  death  favouring 
fondaparinux, seen early at Day 9 with a clinically and statistically significant 14% reduction in risk 
and sustained through to Day 180 (12% risk reduction). Stratum 1 results support the conclusion that 
fondaparinux  was  superior  to  placebo  in  reducing  the  risk  of  death,  as  early  as  Day  9  with  a 
statistically  significant  20%  risk  reduction  and  was  sustained  through  Day  90  (15%  risk  reduction). 
Although  the  results  at  Day  180  failed  to  achieve  statistical  significance,  the  hazard  ratio  remains 
consistent with the overall result for this endpoint. In Stratum 2, the event rates were generally lower 
than in Stratum 1, with non-superiority of the efficacy of UFH up to Day 30. However, after Day 30 
the results in Startum 2 are consistent with the overall results.

Similarly favourable results for fondaparinux were observed in the reduction in the risk of re-MI, with 
a clinically and statistically significant 32% reduction in risk at Day 9 in the overall population and 
sustained through to Day 180 (19%). The results in Stratum 1 and Stratum 2 were consistent with the 
the overall results but were only significant at Day 9 in Stratum 1.

The the occurrence of stroke was low in the overall population. In Stratum 1, contrary to Stratum 2, 
there  was  a  suggestion  of  treatment  effect  favouring  fondaparinux  over  placebo  which  was  most 
apparent at early time points; however in both Strata, the 95% CIs were wide and thus the results are 
inconclusive.

Regarding severe ischemia, consistent with the overall population, fondaparinux was associated with 
statistically non-significant reductions in both Stratum 1 and Stratum 2 in the risk of severe ischemia.   
Sub groups analyses, including PCI 
Subgroup  analyses  on  the  primary  outcome  were  performed  according  to  the  usual  demographic 
characteristics.  The  results  were  consistent  across  various  subgroups  (age,  sex,  BMI,  Creatinine 
Clearance)  and  no  significant  interactions  were  found,  although  results  tended  to  vary  slightly  by 
country group, with higher event rates in Asia and lower in Western Europe, again opening the debate 
on the representativeness of the trial population.  
Analysis  of  the  primary  outcome  by  prior  use  and  concomitant  anticoagulant  treatment,  by  initial 
reperfusion strategy and by revascularisation procedure (PCI) were also performed. The relative effect 
of  fondaparinux  to  control  on  death/re-MI  at  Day  30  was  consistent  among  subjects  who  received 
thrombolysis  or  no  initial  reperfusion,  as  well  as  in  those  who  received  non-fibrin  specific 
thrombolytics. In subjects receiving fibrin specific thrombolytics the rates of death/re-MI were similar.  
However,  among  subjects  who  underwent  primary  PCI  for  the  index  event,  fondaparinux  did  not 
provide any benefit at Day 30 compared to control.

Discontinuation  rates  were  similar  in  stratum  1.  However,  in  stratum  2,  discontinuation  in  the 
fondaparinux group was 3-fold more frequent than in UFH. This is attributed to the different durations 
of therapy of fondaparinux (up to 8 days) compared to UFH (up to 48 hours maximum). 
Bleeding Events 
No  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  incidence  of  adjudicated  severe  haemorrhage  was 
observed  between  fondaparinux  and  placebo/UFH  in  the  overall  population,  although  the  values  for 
fondaparinux  were  lower  at  all  time  points.  In  stratum  1,  the  incidence  was  statistically  lower  in 
fondaparinux at day 9 and day 30, but no statistically significant difference was observed during the 
on-therapy  period.  In  stratum  2,  the  incidence  during  the  on-therapy  period  was  similar  in 
fondaparinux and UFH groups (1% vs 1.2%). Similar trends were observed at the different endpoints 
analysis (see table 11). 
Table 25 Summary of time to first occurrence of adjudicated severe haemorrhage during on-therapy period, days 
9, 30, 90 and 180. 
Regarding major bleeding (see table **), there was a lower incidence in stratum 1 in the fondaparinux 
group compared to placebo group. This difference did not meet statistical significance during the on-
therapy period, but was statistically significant at day 30 and bordering significance at day 9. Further 
to a request from CHMP, the MAH attempted to explain this surprising finding, for which there is no 
clear  explanation.  It  is  plausible  that  the  better  efficacy  observed  with  fondaparinux  relative  to 
placebo, might have resulted in fewer interventions (PCI, CABG, GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor, need for open-
label anticoagulant), and as a consequence lower bleeding rates. Interestingly, when the components of 
severe haemorrhage or major bleeding are examined, the lower risk seen in fondaparinux patients is 
most evident for events of fatal bleeding (1.1% vs. 0.7%) and cardiac tamponade (1.1% vs. 0.5%). 
No difference between treatment groups was observed in stratum 2.

and at days 30, 90, 180-As treated population. 
Of note, the incidences of major bleeding in fondaparinux subjects were somewhat higher in Stratum 2 
compared to Stratum 1 at all time points for both the All Randomized (data not show) and As Treated 
populations.  The  explanation  for  this  is  not  entirely  clear  but  may  be  a  reflection  of  the  slightly 
different  levels  of  use  of  concomitant  therapies  and  interventions  which  may  contribute  to  the 
background bleeding risk in the two strata. 
There were no major differences between treatment groups in minor bleeding or minor haemorrhage, 
or in the type of bleeding or bleeding event. 
Post-Hoc Analysis in PCI patients 
A total of 3715 patients (1862 in fondaparinux and 1853 in control group) underwent a primary PCI 
and 444 (229 fondaparinux and 215 control group) a non-primary PCI. Several post-hoc analyses of 
the  subgroup  of  patients  undergoing  PCI  during  the  treatment  period  were  carried  out  regarding 
clinical outcome, bleeding events and complications. 
As in OASIS 5, an unexpected AE related to catheter thrombus was reported in OASIS 6. A total of 34 
possible  “catheter  thrombus”  were  identified,  of  which  4  were  excluded  (2  occurred  during 
angiography, and 2 were incorrectly coded). Of the remaining 30 events, 23 were adjudicated and all 
occurred in fondaparinux group; 22 during primary PCI and only 1 during non-primary PCI. 
•  Primary PCI 
Events  in  patients  undergoing  primary  PCI  during  initial  hospitalisation  and  within  8  days  of 
randomisation  and  who  had  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug  prior  to  the  procedure  were 
analysed.

Table 27 Complications during primary PCI.  
Stroke, death and MI occurred with a low incidence in both treatment groups.  
Vascular site complications were also reported with a low incidence in both treatment groups (1.7% in 
fondaparinux vs 1.9% in UFH), although in line with the results in OASIS-5, large haematomas were 
twice as frequent in UFH (1.3%) compared to fondaparinux group (0.6%). 
As  observed  in  OASIS-5,  the  most  frequent  complications  in  the  fondaparinux  group  compared  to 
UFH  were  related  to  coronary  complications  (11.2%  vs  8.6%).  They  included  new  angiographic 
thrombus  and  abrupt  closure  of  coronary  artery,  followed  by  investigator-reported  and  adjudicated 
catheter thrombus (reported in 22 patients compared to none in UFH group; 1 patient died during the 
procedure - he developed a cardiogenic shock and received open label UFH and subsequently died). 
Of the 22 cases, 2 patients received open label UFH prior to the procedure, 19 did not received open 
label UFH and in one case it is unknown. It should be noted that 14 of 19 cases received UFH during 
the procedure due to the catheter thrombus events.  
Use of UFH during primary PCI 
The absence of catheter thrombus in UFH patients undergoing a primary PCI, suggests that catheter 
thrombus risk was negligible when UFH is used as adjunct during PCI. Consequently, the Applicant 
has further analysed patients receiving open-label UFH. 
In  fondaparinux  patients  undergoing  a  primary  PCI,  the  use  of  UFH  was  on  background  of  i.v. 
fondaparinux  administered  immediately  prior  to  the  procedure.  In  the  non-primary  PCI  patients,  the 
use of UFH was on the background of fondaparinux administered s.c. prior to the procedure.  
In patients undergoing primary PCI, a total of 689 received open-label UFH before or before/during 
the procedure, of which a similar proportion of patients in both groups had received UFH (12.5% in 
fondaparinux  and  12.3%  in  the  control  group).  However,  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in 
fondaparinux group (9%) received UFH during the procedure compared to the control group (5.7%). 
Additionally, the median dose of UFH administered before or before/during PCI was similar in both 
groups.  However,  during  the  procedure,  the  median  dose  of  UFH  administered  to  fondaparinux 
patients was higher than that administered in the control group (see table 17).

2. Safety outcomes in patients undergoing primary PCI 
Adjudicated  severe  haemorrhage  was  approximately  twice  more  frequent  in  fondaparinux  group 
compared  to  the  control  group  on-therapy  (0.8%  vs  0.4%)  and  at  day  9  (0.9%  vs  0.5%).  Major 
bleeding  rates  were  similar  on  therapy  in  both  fondaparinux  and  control  group  (1.8%  vs  1.6%)  and 
slightly higher in fondaparinux at day 9 (2% vs 1.6%).  
SAEs  occurring  post-PCI  and  up  to  day  9  were  also  slightly  increased  in  fondaparinux  (4.8%) 
compared to control group (3.9%).  
In the subgroup of patients receiving adjunct UFH, the bleeding outcomes were similar in both groups: 
major  bleeds  on-therapy  (1.3%  vs  1.6%  in  fondaparinux  and  control)  and  at  day  9  (1.6%  in  both 
groups),  and  slightly  increased  regarding  severe  haemorrhage  on  therapy  (0.8%  vs  0.6%  in 
fondaparinux and control) and at day 9 (1.1% vs 0.6%, respectively).  
There was no benefit in reducing the risk of death and death/recurrent MI taken together at day 30 in 
fondaparinux  patients  compared  to  the  control  group  (death/re-MI  :  6.1%  vs  5.1%;  death  :  4.5%  vs 
3.9%; Re-MI : 1.9% vs 1.5% in fondaparinux and control respectively). See table 18 
Table 29  Number  and percent  of  patients receiving  study drug prior  to primary  PCI,  experiencing  adjudicated 
events post-PCI up to day 30 
In  the  sub-group  of  patients  receiving  adjunct  UFH,  the  rate  of  death/Re-MI  taken  together  was 
slightly  increased  in  fondaparinux  (4.8%)  than  in  the  control  group  (4.1%),  as  well  as  rate  of  death 
(3.7%  vs  3.2%  in  fondaparinux  and  control  respectively).  Re-MI  taken  separately  was  reported  in  a 
similar rate in both groups (1.2% in fondaparinux and 1.3% in control group).

events post-PCI up to day 30 with adjunct UFH therapy 
Non-primary-PCI 
• 
A total of 444 patients (229 in fondaparinux and 215 in the control group) underwent 639 non-primary 
PCI (318 in fondaparinux and 321 in the control group), defined as any PCI other than primary PCI 
that  occurred  after  randomisation  in  any  stratum  and  at  any  time  during  the  study  period.  The  most 
common reason for the procedure was routine practice (approximately 55% in both groups), however 
non-primary PCI due to refractory PCI was more frequent in fondaparinux than in the control group 
(11% vs 8% respectively) as well as for rescue for failed thrombolysis (18.2% vs 13.4%).

Coronary  complications  (7.2%  fondaparinux  vs.  5.9%  control)  were  most  frequent  complication 
observed  during  the  non-primary-PCI.  One  patient  experienced  an  adjudicated  catheter  thrombus  in 
fondaparinux  group.  This  patient  did  not  receive  open-label-UFH  prior  the  procedure  but  received 
UFH during the procedure due catheter thrombus. The patient recovered with no ischemic events. As 
addressed  above,  no  catheter  thrombus  events  were  reported  in  UFH  Group.  The  other  coronary 
complications were similar in both treatment groups.  
Vascular site complications were also more frequent in fondaparinux group than in the control group 
(2.8% vs 1.6%), with the most frequents events represented by haematoma (2.2% vs 0.9%). 
Death was similar in both treatment groups (0.3%) and MI occurred in one fondaparinux patient. 
Use of UFH during non-primary PCI 
As  addressed  above  in  the  primary  PCI  analysis,  the  use  of  UFH  was  on  the  background  of 
fondaparinux administered s.c. prior to the procedure in the non-primary PCI patients. 
A total of 423 patients undergoing 462 non-primary-PCI procedures received UFH as an adjunct to the 
procedure. More patients received UFH before/during PCI in fondaparinux group (74.8%) compared 
to control group (69.8%); of which 34.6% (fondaparinux) and 31.5% (control) received UFH before 
PCI, and 46.2% compared to 43.3% during PCI. 
2. Safety outcome 
Mortality rate and re-MI, taken separately or together, from the day of PCI (including events occurring 
prior to PCI on the day that the procedure was conducted) up to day 30 were higher in fondaparinux 
group. Similar results were also observed in each stratum; in Stratum 1, death and death/Re-MI were 
approximately two times higher in fondaparinux patients than in the control group, whilst re-MI was 
similar in both treatment groups. In stratum 2, death, Re-MI and death/Re-MI were also more frequent 
with fondaparinux than in the control group, as shown in the table below. 
Table  31:  Number  of  patients  experiencing  adjudicated  events  from  the  Day  on  which  non-primary  PCI  was 
conducted and up to day 30. 
In the subgroup of patients receiving adjunct UFH, death was reported in a similar rate in both groups 
however, Re-MI and death/Re-MI were approximately twice as frequent in fondaparinux patients as in 
the control group.

Table  32  Number of  patients  with  adjunct  UFH  experiencing  adjudicated  events  from  the  Day  on  which  non-
primary PCI was conducted and up to day 30. 
Severe  haemorrhage  was  more  frequent  in  fondaparinux  on  therapy  (1.5%  vs.  0.6%)  and  at  day  9 
(1.9% vs 0.9%) compared to the control group. In the subgroup of patients who received adjunct UFH, 
severe haemorrhage occurred in a similar frequency in both groups of therapy (0.8% fondaparinux and 
0.9%  control)  and  at  day  9  (1.7%  and  1.3%,  respectively).  Major  bleeds  occurred  with  a  similar 
frequency  in  both  treatment  groups.  SAEs  post-PCI  and  up  to  day  9  were  more  frequent  in 
fondaparinux than in the control group (6.6% vs 3.7%). Of these, major bleeding were slightly more 
frequent in the control group than fondaparinux, on-therapy (2.2% vs 0.8% respectively) and at day 9 
(2.7% vs 2.1%). 
Common Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  overall  population  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups:  32%  in 
fondaparinux and 33% in the control group (33% in fondaparinux vs. 34% in placebo and 32% in both 
fondaparinux and UFH). The most frequent AEs were assigned to “general disorders” and “cardiac” 
SOCs: pyrexia (3% in both groups), atrial fibrillation (3% vs. 2% in fondaparinux and control group, 
respectively),  chest  pain  (1.8%  vs.  1.3%  respectively),  headache  (1.8%  vs.  2%  respectively), 
ventricular  tachycardia  (1.3%  in  both  groups),  hypotension  (1.3%  in  both  groups),  vomiting  (1%  in 
both groups), haematoma (0.7% in both groups) and puncture site haemorrhage (0.2% in both groups). 
A similar trend was observed across the two strata. 
On-therapy SAEs were equally reported in the two treatment groups: 3% of patients (1% were drug-
related)  in  stratum  1  and  4%  (1.5%  were  drug-related)  in  stratum  2.  The  most  frequent  SAEs  were 
related to bleeding (e.g. digestive bleeding, coronary artery thrombosis, pericardial haemorrhage and 
cerebrovascular haemorrhage). 
Regarding  other  events  of  special  interest,  10  (0.16%)  patients  experienced  thrombocytopenia  in 
fondaparinux compared to 4 (0.06%) in the control groups up to and including day 30. It was  more 
frequent in stratum 2 (9 [0.028%] in fondaparinux and 3 [0.09%] in UFH group) than in stratum 1 (1 
in each treatment group). Only one patient (UFH group) experienced HIT. 
Discussion 
This  new  indication  in  ACS,  with  and  without  ST-segment  elevation,  is  based  on  2  large  phase  III 
pivotal studies (OASIS 5 in UA/NSTEMI and OASIS 6 in STEMI) and 4 phase II supportive trials.  
The selection of the 2.5mg dose for the phase II programme might be considered surprising, as unlike 
LMWHs, where the higher VTE treatment doses are approved for use in UA/NSTEMI, it is the same 
fondaparinux  dose  used  for  the  prevention  of  VTE.  Despite  the  lack  of  a  strong  clinical  rationale 
(other  than  safety  considerations)  to  support  the  dose  selection,  the  observed  efficacy  and  safety 
profile of fondaparinux 2.5mg for the acute treatment of ACS raises the question whether the lower 
VTE prevention doses of the LMWHs  might also be  effective and better tolerated. However, unlike 
those  conducted  with  fondaparinux,  the  phase  II  ACS  studies  for  the  LMWHs  did  not  evaluate  the 
wide dose range that included the lower VTE prevention doses.

Efficacy 
The two pivotal trials supporting the indication of fondaparinux in ACS are methodologically sound, 
pragmatic in their design, and appear to be well conducted. 
The  primary  objective  in  OASIS-6  was  to  evaluate  whether  fondaparinux  was  superior  to  a  control 
reflecting a usual care (UFH or placebo) in preventing death or recurrent MI (re-MI) up to Day 30 in 
subjects  presenting  with  STEMI.  Fondaparinux  demonstrated  a  clinically  relevant  and  statistically 
significant  14%  risk  reduction  relative  to  control  in  the  primary  endpoint  in  the  overall  randomised 
population. Consistent with this result, fondaparinux was superior to placebo in Stratum 1 (UFH not 
indicated)  in  the  prevention  of  death  or  re-MI  with  a  20%  risk  reduction  at  Day  30.  However, 
fondaparinux failed to demonstrate superiority over UFH (stratum 2). Fondaparinux also significantly 
reduced  the  of  all  cause  mortality  at  Day  30;  as  with  the  primary  endpoint,  this  finding  was  also 
significant in Stratum 1 but not in Stratum 2. Interaction tests between treatment and strata indicated 
that the results of both strata were consistent with the overall results.  
These effects were consistent across pre-specified subgroups such as elderly, renally impaired patients 
and  type  of  concomitant  anti-platelet  aggregant  medication.  Nevertheless,  among  subjects  who 
underwent  primary  PCI  for  the  index  event,  fondaparinux  did  not  provide  any  benefit  at  Day  30 
compared to control; in fact there was a trend observed in favour of the control group. Similar results 
were  obtained  when  analysed  according  to  non-primary  PCI.  When  the  primary  PCI  patients  are 
excluded from the analysed population, the results of the primary endpoint are significantly in favour 
of  fondaparinux  therapy  in  the  overall  population  and  in  both  of  the  strata.  Consequently,  and 
especially in the light of the serious coronary complications observed in fondaparinux-treated patients 
during  PCI  in  both  OASIS  trials  (see  discussion  on  Safety),  the  Applicant  decided  to  apply  for  an 
indication in the treatment of STEMI in patients who are managed with thrombolytics or who initially 
are  to  receive  no  other  form  of  reperfusion  therapy,  thus  excluding  patients  undergoing  invasive 
management.  The  CHMP  is  in  agreement,  and  the  indication  and  trial  results  have  been  adequately 
reflected in sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SPC, respectively. 
The  main  issue  regarding  OASIS-6  discussed  by  the  CHMP  and  referred  to  the  SAG  CVS  was  the 
relevance,  with  respect  to  current  EU  clinical  practice,  of  the  population  studied  in  OASIS-6, 
particularly in terms of the low use of UFH, PCI and fibrin-specific thrombolytics, and the very high 
use  of  streptokinase  [84%  of  patients  treated  with  a  thrombolytic  were  treated  streptokinase]  (for  a 
more detailed discussion, see page 26 of this report). Further to a request from CHMP the Applicant 
submitted  a  thorough  investigation  of  contemporary  European  registries  (notably  ACS-II  and 
GRACE).  The  SAG  acknowledged  notable  differences  between  the  OASIS-6  population  and  the 
populations  included  in  the  registries  but  also  pointed  out  that  registry data  are  populated  to  a  large 
extent  by  active,  highly  motivated  large  centres  with  facilities  for  primary  PCI  in  STEMI  patients. 
Moreover,  it  was  suggested  that  too  much  attention  should  not  be  paid  to  the  type  of  thrombolytic 
therapy often used in EU, as the pathophysiological mechanism is similar irrespective of the type of 
the thrombolytic agent. Thus, although firm evidence-based conclusions are not possible in this area, 
the SAG concluded, and the CHMP agreed, that despite the population of patients included in OASIS-
6 (notably in Stratum 1) not being fully representative of the target population, the study results were 
still applicable to European patients. Nonetheless, the percentage of patients undergoing primary PCI 
(31%) and treated with non-fibrin specific thrombolytics are reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC. 
The main objective in OASIS-5 was to evaluate whether fondaparinux 2.5mg was “non-inferior”, or 
superior to, enoxaparin in preventing death and ischemic events (MI or RI) up to Day 9 in the acute 
treatment  of  subjects  with  UA/NSTEMI  concurrently  managed  with  standard  medical  therapy. 
Fondaparinux was non-inferior to enoxaparin in the early prevention of adjudicated death, MI or RI at 
Day 9. There was a tendency to a reduction in the risk of death, MI and RI with fondaparinux at day 
14  which  was  sustained  at  days  30,  90  and  180.  In  addition,  fondaparinux  was  associated  with  a 
significant  reduction  in  all-cause  mortality  at  Day  30.  As  in  OASIS-6,  these  effects  were  consistent 
across pre-specified subgroups such as elderly, renally impaired patients and type of concomitant anti-
platelet aggregant medication.

However, treatment with fondaparinux did not result in the reduction of ischaemic events or death in 
the PCI subgroup. Taking into account the higher incidence of serious coronary complications patients 
in  both  pivotal  trials  (see  safety  discussion  later)  coupled  to  the  negative  trends  regarding  efficacy 
observed in OASIS-6 in patients undergoing PCI, the CHMP debated at length the benefit:risk balance 
in  this  patient  population.  Further  to  a  recommendation  by  the  SAG  CVS,  endorsed  by  CHMP,  the 
Applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  a  restriction  to  the  use  of  fondaparinux  in  UA/STEMI  patients  for 
whom an early invasive management is not recommended. The Applicant argued in writing at an oral 
explanation that the diagnosis of NSTEMI can be problematic and the decision on whether to refer the 
patient for invasive treatment is often delayed whilst the patient is under observation and the results of 
numerous tests are waited. The decision-making algorithm for the management of NSTEMI patients in 
the new ESC treatment guidelines clearly defines the words “urgent” (i.e. < 2hours) and “early” (i.e. < 
72  hours)  in  the  context  of  invasive  management  strategies.  Considering  that  prompt  treatment  is 
essential  for  patients  presenting  with  a  suspicion  of  UA  or  NSTEMI  and  should  be  administered  as 
soon  as  the  diagnosis  is  possible,  but  not  necessarily  confirmed,  the  Applicant  believes  that  a 
restriction to “early” would mean that the majority of patients will not have the benefit of treatment 
with fondaparinux, since most patients will have started some other form of anticoagulation by then. 
Delaying treatment until a decision regarding invasive treatment is clearly not an option. 
Thus,  if  treatment  with  fondaparinux  were  delayed  for  at  least  72  hours,  there  would  be  very  few 
patients to treat since the vast majority would already have received some other anticoagulation. Given 
that treatment with fondaparinux compared to enoxaparin was beneficial from a bleeding perspective 
(see  discussion  un  Safety),  equally  effective  and  associated  with  a  clear  tendency  for  reduced 
mortality,  the  CHMP  agree  with  the  Applicant  that  the  indication  should  be  restricted  to  patients 
patients for whom urgent (<120mins) invasive management (PCI) is not indicated.  
Safety 
In OASIS-6, no statistically significant difference in the incidence of adjudicated severe haemorrhage 
was observed between fondaparinux and placebo/UFH in the overall population, although the values 
for fondaparinux were lower at all time points. In stratum 1, the incidence was statistically lower in 
fondaparinux at day 9 and day 30, but no statistically significant difference was observed during the 
on-therapy period. The results on severe haemorrhage were consistent across prespecified subgroups 
such as elderly, renally impaired patients and type of concomitant antiplatelet medications. However, 
in patients undergoing primary PCI, the incidence of severe haemorrhage was numerically higher with 
incidence  of  serious  coronary 
fondaparinux.  Equally  worrying  was 
complications (including new angiographic thrombus, abrupt closure of coronary artery and catheter 
thrombus) observed in the fondaparinux group. 
the  noticeably  higher 
Treatment with fondaparinux in OASIS-5 resulted in a significant (48%) lower risk of major bleeding 
up  to  and  including  day  9  compared  to  treatment  with  enoxaparin.  Other  types  of  bleeds,  including 
severe bleeding according to the TIMI criteria and minor bleeding, were also lower on fondaparinux. 
Of note, subjects who had a major or minor bleeding during hospitalisation had a significantly higher 
rate  of  death  at  day  30  than  subjects  without  a  bleeding  event,  regardless  of  treatment  group.  The 
Applicant  has  performed  two  ad-hoc  analyses  to  assess  the  clinical  implications  of  bleeding  which 
appear to indicate that the difference in mortality between the treatment groups observed at the end of 
the  study  may  be  related  to  the  lower  rate  of  bleeding  with  fondaparinux  (for  a  more  detailed 
discussion, see page 15 of this report). 
Consistent  with  its  lower  bleeding  risk  in  the  overall  population,  in  patients  undergoing  PCI 
fondaparinux was also associated with a significantly lower incidence of major bleeding. Worryingly 
however, and as observed in primary PCI patients in OASIS-6, coronary complications occurred more 
frequently  with  fondaparinux.  In  addition  to  the  more  frequent  guiding  catheter  thrombus,  more 
disturbing  are  the  higher  rates  of  coronary  abrupt  closure  and  new  angiographic  thrombus.  The 
occurrence  of  catheter  thrombus  (unblinded),  an  unexpected  AE  during  the  course  of  the  study, 
prompted an amendement of the study protocol to emphasis the correct administration of fondaparinux 
intravenously during the PCI and to reiterate that heparinised catheter flushes could be used.

Proposed management strategy for fondaparinux-treated patients undergoing PCI: Use of UFH 
Acknowledging the complications in fondaparinux patients undergoing PCI observed in OASIS-5 and 
OASIS-6  and  aware  of  the  fact  that  UA/NSTEMI  patients  treated  with  fondaparinux  may  need  to 
undergo PCI, the Applicant proposes in section 4.2 of the SPC that UFH be administered as an adjunct 
to  the  procedure  (as  per  local  practice),  given  that  there  were  no  instances  of  guiding  catheter 
thrombus  reported  in  patients  managed  following  the  above  recommendation.  This  generated  much 
debate  at  CHMP,  as  this  proposed  PCI  management  strategy  has  not  been  has  not  been  formally 
studied in UA/NSTEMI patients. The Applicant argued that there are (limited) data showing the safety 
of  this  treatment  combination;  nonetheless  the  CHMP  consider,  and  the  SAG  CVS  agree,  that  the 
available  evidence  is  insufficient  and  a  Post-Authorisation  Safety  Study  to  evaluate  the  safety  in 
fondaparinux-treated patients undergoing PCI receiving adjunctive therapy with one of two regimens 
of i.v. UFH (standard and reduced dose) as the PCI adjunct in fondaparinux-treated patients has been 
agreed as part of the Risk Management Plan (for a more detailed discussion, see page 19-21 of this 
report).  Sections  4.2  and  4.4  of  the  SPC  include  guidance  on  the  use  of  UFH  during  PCI  in  both 
UA/NSTEMI and STEMI patients (non-primary PCI), and section 4.4 contains a warning on the risk 
of guiding catheter thrombus in PCI. 
The  non-bleeding  adverse  event  profile  reported  in  the  ACS  program  is  consistent  with  the  adverse 
drug  reactions  identified  for  VTE  prophylaxis  and  does  not  give  rise  to  concern.  As  reflected  in 
section 4.8 of the SPC, the most commonly reported adverse events in OASIS-5 were headache, chest 
pain  and  atrial  fibrillation,  whereas  atrial  fibrillation,  pyrexia,  chest  pain,  headache,  ventricular 
tachycardia, vomiting, and hypotension were most commonly reported in OASIS-6. 
Finally,  there  is  extensive  experience  in  patients  with  moderate  renal  impairment  and  limited 
experience in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 20-30  ml/min) with treatment for up to 8 
days in the ACS programme, as reflected in section 4.4 of the SPC. Treatment duration was similar in 
the different renal function groups, and there was no evidence of more bleedings at later time points in 
patients with reduced renal function (i.e. when these patients obtain higher exposure). In OASIS 5 the 
incidence  of  bleedings  is  lower  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  renal  impairment  receiving 
fondaparinux than in patients receiving enoxaparin. In OASIS 6, the incidence of bleeding in patients 
with CrCl >20 ml/min receiving fondaparinux is low. Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SPC clearly state that 
the  maximum  treatment  duration  in  these  indications  is  8  days.  Thus,  in  contrast  to  the  approved 
dosing recommendations for prophylaxis of VTE, no dose reduction is proposed in patients with ACS 
and with impaired renal function; fondaparinux is contraindicated in patients with CrCl <20 ml/min). 
Conclusions and Benefit/Risk Assessment 
OASIS-5 and OASIS-6 are two large, well designed and conducted studies adequately covering the 
spectrum of Acute Coronary Syndromes. 
The results of OASIS-6 demonstrated a clinically relevant and statistically significant risk reduction of 
fondaparinux relative to control death or re-MI in the overall STEMI population. Consistent with this 
result, treatment with fondaparinux was superior to placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority over 
UFH.  Treatment  with  fondaparinux  also  significantly  reduced  all  cause  mortality  at  Day  30  in  the 
overall population and in stratum 1 (vs. placebo). Fondaparinux showed a comparable safety profile to 
the  respective  controls.  However,  in  patients  undergoing  PCI,  fondaparinux  did  not  provide  any 
benefit compared to control, with a clear trend observed in favour of the control group. Coupled to the 
higher  incidence  of  severe  haemorrhage  and  serious  coronary  complications  in  this  subgroup,  the 
benefit:risk  balance  in  STEMI  patients  undergoing  PCI  is  negative  and  these  patients  have  been 
excluded from the indication proposed by the Applicant. For the remainder of the STEMI population, 
namely patients who are managed with thrombolytics or who initially are to receive no other form of 
reperfusion therapy, the benefit:risk balance is positive. 
Regarding the UA/NSTEMI population, OASIS-5 showed that treatment with fondaparinux was non-
inferior  to  enoxaparin  in  the  early  prevention  of  adjudicated  death,  MI  or  RI  at  Day  9.  In  addition, 
fondaparinux was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality at Day 30. Importantly, 
treatment with fondaparinux resulted in a significant lower risk of major bleeding up to and including 
39

day 9 compared to treatment with enoxaparin. However, in the PCI subgroup there was no significant 
advantage of fondaparinux over enoxaparin, and there were clear safety concerns regarding the higher 
incidence of coronary complications observed during the PCI procedure. Hence, in order to maintain a 
positive  benefit:risk  balance  in  the  UA/STEMI  population,  the  indication  has  been  restricted  to 
patients for whom urgent (<120mins) invasive management (PCI) is not indicated, and fondaparinux 
should not be used as the sole anticoagulant in patients undergoing non-primary PCI. These patients 
should  be  managed  with  UFH  as  per  local  practice.  A  Post-Authorisation  Safety  Study  to  further 
evaluate the safety of this proposed PCI management strategy has been agreed as part of the RMP.

marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Roche Registration GmbH. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication to include treatment of patients under 2 months 
of age. For information, the full indication will therefore be as follows:2

age and older with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four SMN2

characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing

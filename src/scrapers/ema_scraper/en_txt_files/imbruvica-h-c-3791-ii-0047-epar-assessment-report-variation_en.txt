In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), ibrutinib is presently approved for the treatment of 
adult patients with previously untreated CLL and as a single agent or combination therapy with 
bendamustine and rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with CLL who received at least one prior 
therapy. 
The target indication, which is the subject of this Type II variation, is to extend the indications for ibrutinib 
in CLL, as follows:  
• 
IMBRUVICA as a single agent or in combination with obinutuzumab is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with previously untreated CLL. 
Background on the Target Indication and Current Treatments 
Treatment guidelines from the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) indicate the choice of 
treatment for previously untreated patients with CLL is based on stage of disease, whether a patient is 
considered “fit” and presence or absence of del17p or mutated TP53 (Eichhorst 2015; ESMO 2017).

Figure 1: ESMO (2018) treatment algorithm for front-line treatment of CLL  
The benefit of FCR is strongly correlated to the presence of high-risk features other than del 17p/TP53 
mutation, with a reported 10-year PFS of ~55% and a plateau thereafter in subjects with mutated IGHV 
vs ~10% in subjects with unmutated IGHV (MDACC group, 2016). The group of young fit patients with no 
TP53 aberration and mutated IGHV disease constitutes approximately one-third of the young fit patients 
and around 8-10% of all patients of all age groups requiring frontline therapy (Jain, Hematology Am Soc 
Hematol Edu Program; 2018, p242). The Clb+CD20 antibody combination is not recommended in 
subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated disease

b Used for first- and second-line treatment of CLL 
Chemoimmunotherapies (chemotherapy and anti-CD20 agents) are a mainstay of treatment for frontline 
CLL (Eichhorst 2015; ESMO 2017; NCCN 2018). The most effective CIT regimen, fludarabine, 
cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR), is however also associated with increased hematologic 
toxicities, and therefore its use is limited to younger, fitter patients without comorbidities (ESMO 2017; 
NCCN 2018; Hallek 2010; Keating 2005; Robak 2017). By contrast, of the recommended multi-agent CIT 
regimens, the alkylating-agent based regimens, bendamustine plus rituximab (BR) and chlorambucil plus 
obinutuzumab (Clb+Ob), are recommended for broader groups of patients based on their improved 
safety profiles but are seemingly less efficacious than the FCR combination (Eichhorst 2015; ESMO 2017; 
NCCN 2018).  
When treated with CIT, patients with high-risk CLL characterized by del 17p, del 11q, or unmutated IGHV 
had shorter PFS and OS compared with those without these high-risk features (Thompson 2016; 
Byrd 2006). In CLL patients with high-risk genomic features (eg, del 17p or del 11q), mutated TP53, or 
unmutated IGHV, there are few frontline treatment options available (ESMO 2017; NCCN 2018), and the 
guidelines note it is important to fully explore the potential of ibrutinib-based therapy in these high-risk 
CLL patients. Phase 3 data from Study 1112 demonstrated a significant PFS and OS benefit in patients 
with previously treated CLL, including patients with del 17p CLL treated with ibrutinib (Byrd 2014). Data 
from Study 1112 ultimately led to the regulatory approval of ibrutinib in previously treated patients with 
CLL in the US, European Union, and globally (IMBRUVICA USPI, IMBRUVICA Summary of Product 
Characteristics [SmPC]) as well as the approval in the EU of ibrutinib in the first-line treatment of CLL in 
patients with del17 p/mutated TP53 who are not suited for CIT (IMBRUVICA® SmPC). Subsequently,

Phase 3 data from Study 1115 led to approvals in the US, EU, and globally in patients with previously 
untreated CLL (IMBRUVICA USPI, IMBRUVICA SmPC).  
The recently updated 2018 iwCLL guidelines (Hallek 2018) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) guidelines (NCCN 2018), emphasize the importance of obtaining prognostic information using 
molecular genetic testing with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify common high-risk 
genomic features such as del 11q and del 17p and sequencing to detect TP53 mutations and IGHV 
mutational status to inform treatment decisions in clinical practice. Progression-free survival and OS are 
similar in patients with CLL carrying del 17p and patients carrying a TP53 mutation in the absence of 
del 17p (Zenz 2010). The presence of adverse genomic features del 17p and del 11q, along with TP53 
mutations and unmutated IGHV clones identified by DNA sequencing, typically confer unfavorable 
outcomes (eg, shorter PFS and OS) with conventional CIT regimens used in CLL including alkylating drugs 
or purine analogues (Thompson 2016; Fink 2013; Byrd 2006). However, when historically poor 
prognostic genomic factors were examined in ibrutinib-treated patients, these factors did not confer 
adverse prognosis for PFS (Kipps 2017). Assessment of CLL patients for del 17p, del 11q, mutated TP53, 
and IGHV mutational status has prognostic value and should be performed prior to treatment as well as 
guide therapeutic decisions in clinical practice (Hallek 2018; NCCN 2018). Providing patients who have 
these high-risk genomic features with effective therapy options remains an urgent, unmet need. 
Ibrutinib has previously been used in combination with 2 anti-CD20 antibodies, ofatumumab and 
rituximab, in 2 Phase 1/2 CLL studies (Jaglowski 2014; Burger 2014; Burger 2017). Ibrutinib use in this 
setting was shown to be well tolerated and produced high rates of overall response (83% to 95%) with 
minimal treatment-related lymphocytosis, suggesting that an ibrutinib plus anti-CD20 antibody strategy 
was likely to be administered safely and potentially produce improved quality of responses in CLL.  
Phase 3 data from the CLL11 trial has established the efficacy and safety of the anti-CD20 antibody, 
obinutuzumab, in combination with chlorambucil in treatment-naive CLL (Goede 2014; Goede 2015). The 
addition of obinutuzumab to chlorambucil demonstrated significant improvement in efficacy over both 
single-agent chlorambucil and chlorambucil combined with rituximab. The addition of obinutuzumab to 
ibrutinib was expected to result in a further significant improvement in disease control, including in 
patients with high-risk CLL, due to the targeting of distinct mechanisms of action important in attenuating 
aberrant B-cell activity in frontline CLL. Treatment with ibrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab may 
provide an important treatment benefit for all patients with CLL and previously untreated patients with 
CLL with del 17p/ mutated TP53, del 11q, or unmutated IGHV - a patient population with poor prognosis 
for which fewer treatment options are available. A need exists for novel therapies in this hard-to-treat 
population, the importance of which was further underscored by the updated iwCLL guidelines 
(Hallek 2018). Obinutuzmab was therefore considered to be an appropriate agent with which to combine 
ibrutinib in Study 1130.

Bioanalytical methods 
The bioanalytical method (BTM-1792-R0) used for the measurement of ibrutinib and its metabolite 
PCI-452227 in study 1130 was previously assessed in application EMEA/H/C/3791/X/37. No changes 
were made to the method reported in previous submissions for ibrutinib. Samples were analysed by a 
sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method for the determination of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 in heparinized 
human plasma. The method was validated for ibrutinib and PCI-45227 over the concentration range of 
0.500 to 100 ng/mL. The plasma concentration of ibrutinib and the major metabolite, PCI-45227, were 
determined. An ISR evaluation for method BTM-1792-R0, using samples selected from study 1130, was 
conducted and met the acceptance criteria. Interference from co-medicine obinutuzumab on ibrutinib and 
PCI-45227 was evaluated. Results showed the mean concentrations for the test samples were within ± 
15.0% of the Low QC nominal values and that there was no interference from the co-medicine on the 
ibrutinib and PCI-45227 samples. 
Sampling  
Sparse PK samples were collected in all subjects randomized to receive ibrutinib. On Cycle 1, Day 15, 
samples were collected pre-dose, at 1 hour (window: 45–75 minutes), 2 hours (window: 1.5–2.5 hours) 
and 4 hours (window: 3.5–4.5 hours). On Cycle 2, Day 1 a pre-dose sample was collected.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
A previously developed model (Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Ibrutinib, EDMS-ERI-112451527: 
1.0, 1 October 2015, EMEA/H/C/003791/II/0020) was used in the analysis of the data from study 
PCYC-1130-CA. The previously developed model to describe ibrutinib was a 2-compartment PK model 
with sequential zero to first order absorption and first order elimination. It included an effect of meal on 
relative bioavailability and duration of zero order input, as well as an effect of the co-administration of 
CYP3A4 inhibitors and age on F1. The between subject variability and the residual variability was high 
(56.0 – 155% and 48.8 – 81.3% respectively). Between-subject variability was included on relative 
bioavailability (F1, instead of on oral clearance (CL/F)), apparent central volume of distribution (V2/F), 
apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F), apparent peripheral volume of distribution (V3/F) and 
lag-time (ALAG1). Calculation of posthoc the PK parameters CL/F, V2/F, V3/F and Q/F need to account for 
the separate estimate of F1.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters including the mean oral clearance (CL/F), distribution volume (Vss/F), and 
metrics of systemic exposure (e.g., the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 
hours [AUC0-24h], plasma concentration at 24 hours after dosing [C24h] of ibrutinib) were estimated 
using a Bayesian feedback analysis based on a previously developed population PK model (The NONMEM 
maximum a posteriori approach using the First Order Conditional Estimation method (FOCE) and the 
feature MAXEVAL equal to 0 applied to the data of Study PCYC-1130-CA). Analyses of ibrutinib plasma 
concentration-time data were conducted using non-linear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) software 
(v. 7.1). 
The individual empirical Bayesian estimates (EBE) of PK parameters were used to obtain the individual 
model-derived estimates of the ibrutinib exposure. Exposure metrics, AUCtau and Ctrough were 
calculated by means of predictions i.e. predicting individual PK profiles at steady state over the dosing 
interval (24 hours) using individual EBE of PK parameters with the residual variability fixed to zero. 
The model was fitted to the data using the log transform both sides approach and the first-order 
conditional estimation method.

Pharmacokinetic analysis 
The NONMEM maximum a posteriori approach using the First Order Conditional Estimation method 
(FOCE) and the feature MAXEVAL equal to 0 applied to the data of Study PCYC-1130-CA was successful. 
The model was able to describe the data well, as can be appreciated from the GOF and residual plots 
shown in Figure 1. 
The distributions of the EBE of ETAs for the individual parameters had median near zero, consistent with 
the expectations. This indicated an absence of bias in the PK parameters obtained from these analyses. 
The shrinkage (ηsh) was higher for ALAG1 (58%), Q (60%) as well as for V2 (44%) and V3 (63%). The 
Ibrutinib population pharmacokinetics are described with between-subject variability of bioavailability 
(F1) rather than on oral clearance (CL/F). This suggests that CL/F was well estimated (shrinkage on F1 of 
18%), while some parameters tended more to regress toward the mean (e.g., ALAG1, Q, V2, V3), 
consistent with the sparse sampling approach used in this study.

Figure 2. Standard Goodness of Fit (GOF) for Ibrutinib PK: NONMEM Maximum a Posteriori 
Approach 
When ibrutinib is administered in combination with obinutuzumab, the PK profile of ibrutinib is in 
alignment with historical data with ibrutinib for ibrutinib as monotherapy, and there was no evidence of 
effect of obinutuzumab on ibrutinib exposure. The mean CL/F and Vss/F were 1114 L/h and 9501 L, 
respectively. The goodness-of-fit plots, the graphical exploration of the empirical Bayesian estimates, and

the visual predictive check plots indicated the absence of bias in the individual predictions. Figure 3 
represents the ibrutinib concentration-time data overlaying model-based simulations derived from a 
previously developed PK model for ibrutinib. There was a substantial overlap of observed and predicted 
values based on the previous nonlinear mixed-effects model, thereby indicating that the PK behaviour 
observed in this study was consistent with previous assessments. In addition, the previously developed 
PK model for ibrutinib monotherapy allowed for description of the data obtained in subjects with CLL/SLL 
when treated with Ibr+Ob. Mean steady-state AUC0-24h and C24h or trough concentration (standard 
deviation [SD]) were 517 (268) ngxh/mL and 5.48 (3.74) ng/mL, respectively.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has conducted a clinical trial (study 1130) where subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 
2 treatment arms and received wither ibrutinib 420 mg/day plus intravenous obinutuzumab (Arm A) or 
chlorambucil 0.5 mg/kg body weight plus intravenous obinutuzumab (Arm B), up to a total of 6 cycles for 
each treatment arm.

Obinutuzumab concentrations were not determined and therefore no assessment can be made of the 
effect of ibrutinib on obinutuzumab. Mechanistically, an interaction between ibrutinib and obinutuzumab 
is not expected.  
A previously developed population pharmacokinetic model was used to derive the individual exposure 
metrics (EMEA/H/C/003791/II/0020). The PPK model used in this analysis (based on 8697 observations 
from 1202 subjects) was generally similar to the model presented in the NDA with the exception that 
effects of body weight on V/F and of antacids on duration of zero order input (D1) were no longer included 
as they were considered not clinically significant. The conclusion was that the population pharmacokinetic 
model performed sufficiently well for its purpose. 
The approach for deriving individual exposure is considered acceptable. 
Sparse sampling was employed and a previously developed population pharmacokinetic model was used 
to derive the individual ibrutinib exposure. The applicant has presented goodness-of-fit plots, 
ETA-distributions and the shrinkage as well as a visual predictive check-plot. The shrinkage is high for all 
parameters but F1 (44-63%), indicating that the sparse sampling resulted in less informative data. The 
shrinkage on F1 is acceptable. The maximum concentration is somewhat under-predicted; however the 
model is considered to predict the data adequately.  
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical trial performed, and the method of analysing the data is considered acceptable. The 
pharmacokinetics profile is not considered to differ between this population and the previous populations.

Analysis of the primary and key efficacy endpoints (ie, PFS and ORR) was based on assessment by an 
IRC. Assessment of response and progression was conducted in accordance with the 2008 IWCLL criteria 
with recent clarifications (Hallek et al, 2013; Cheson et al, 2014; Hallek et al, 2012; Hallek et al, 2008). 
The main disease evaluations included the following assessments:  
• 
Physical examination with focus on the presence/absence of size increase/decrease in 
lymph nodes, liver, and spleen).  
•  Hematologic parameters by complete blood count performed at a central laboratory.  
•  Radiographic evaluation (CT or magnetic resonance imaging scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis).  
• 
Flow cytometric evaluation of MRD, which is defined as < 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes; key 
time points in this evaluation are as follows:  
o  A peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy with MRD at Cycle 9 and 
as appropriate if there was evidence of CR in the other response parameters.  
o  Responders with MRD-negative status in the bone marrow were followed with 
peripheral blood MRD assessments every 4 cycles until Cycle 33 and then every 6 cycles 
starting at Cycle 39.  
o  Responders with MRD-positive status in the bone marrow or peripheral blood were followed 
with peripheral blood MRD assessments every 4 cycles until Cycle 33 and then every 6 cycles 
starting Cycle 39. Upon MRD negativity in peripheral blood, this result was subsequently 
confirmed with a bone marrow MRD assessment.  
If study treatment was held before a scheduled response assessment, the response assessment could be 
delayed up to 4 weeks to allow re-initiation of study treatment for 2 weeks (or as long as possible) prior 
to performing the scheduled response assessment. For the purposes of the study result analyses, efficacy 
assessments were performed by an IRC (whose members were blinded to each subject’s study treatment 
assignment) and were independent of investigators and personnel who were involved in the conduct of 
the study.

Sample size 
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of treatment on PFS and was powered for this endpoint. 
The sample size for the study was calculated based on the following considerations:  
o  Randomization ratio of 1:1.  
o  Median PFS of 27 months for Arm B (chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab).  
o  Target HR of 0.55, which corresponds to median PFS of 49.1 months for Arm A 
(ibrutinib combined with obinutuzumab).  
o  Enrollment rate of 18 subjects per month.  
o  A minimum of 94 PFS events provides at least an 80% power to detect the target HR of 
0.55 based on a log-rank test and a 2-sided overall significance level of 0.05.  
On this basis, 94 PFS events provide 80% power to achieve a statistical significance level of 5% (2-sided) 
under exponential distribution. With an estimated accrual rate of 18 subjects per month, approximately 
212 eligible subjects were to be enrolled to observe 94 PFS events in approximately 36 months from the 
first subject randomized. 
Randomisation 
Approximately 212 subjects were planned for randomization. Two randomization schemes 
were generated: 1 for each geographic region (North America vs. ROW). Under each 
scheme, randomization was stratified according to the following factors:  
•  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 vs. 2.  
•  Cytogenetics were to be stratified into 1 of 3 categories:  
o  Del 17p. 
o  Del 11q without del 17p.  
o  Others (neither del 17p nor del 11q).  
The randomization code was controlled through a centralized procedure. The primary efficacy evaluation 
was performed by an IRC that was blinded to study treatment information. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study; no blinding was performed. 
Statistical methods 
The analysis of PFS will be performed in the ITT population to compare PFS (as assessed by the IRC) for 
the two treatment arms using a log-rank test. Distribution of PFS including median and its corresponding 
95% confidence interval (CI) will be summarized for each treatment arm using the Kaplan-Meier 
estimate. The estimate of the hazard ratio and its corresponding 95% CI will be computed using a Cox 
proportional hazards model.  
The following two randomization stratification factors will be used for the stratified analysis/test: ECOG 
performance status (0, 1 versus 2) and Cytogenetics (del 17p, del 11q without del 17p, others). To reflect 
the randomization process and maintain the integrity of randomization, all stratified tests will be based on 
randomization stratification factors as recorded in the IWRS.

Tests of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were performed at the 2-sided significance level of 
0.05 based on a serial gatekeeping testing procedure in the following sequential hierarchical manner: PFS 
by IRC, PFS by IRC in the high-risk subpopulation, rate of sustained Hgb improvement, rate of 
MRD-negative response, ORR by IRC, OS, rate of IRRs, rate of sustained platelet improvement, and rate 
of clinically meaningful improvement of EQ-5D-5L utility score. 
Table 6: Summary of analysis populations 
The recently released IWCLL guidelines (Hallek et al, 2018) have placed new emphasis on the importance 
of testing for IGHV mutational status and are now recommending this testing in clinical practice. Given 
the guidelines from Hallek et al, 2018 on the importance of IGHV, an analysis for PFS was conducted in 
the high-risk population, which additionally includes subjects with unmutated IGHV (ie, del 17p/TP53 
mutation/del 11q/unmutated IGHV). The IGHV mutational status subgroups were already selected as 
independent subgroups for analysis in addition to the high-risk subpopulation.

Results 
Participant flow 
Table 7: Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Study Period: 06 October 2014 (first informed consent signed) to 26 March 2018 (date of database lock). 
The study was conducted at a total of 9 sites in the United States (US) and 80 sites in 
rest-of-world (ROW). 
Conduct of the study 
There were 3 amendments to the original protocol, which was dated 12 May 2014. Key changes (as 
selected by the assessor) in the amendments included 
1.  18 Aug 2014 
Included interim analysis to be conducted at approximately 66 PFS events. 
Clarified that progressive disease could be assessed based on ≥ 50% increase 
from nadir rather than baseline count if the ALC is ≥ 30,000/μL and lymphocyte 
doubling time is rapid. 
2.  10 May 2016  Removed the 36-month timepoint from interim analysis. 
3.  17 Feb 2017  Removed the planned interim analysis and updated plans for primary analysis to 
ensure maturity of PFS outcome data per FDA feedback.

Important changes in the planned analyses 
• 
The randomization strata were based on available FISH results at randomization from either the 
central or local laboratory. Post-randomization, the central laboratory continued FISH tests and 
reported results based on samples drawn at baseline for all randomized subjects prior to 
database lock. According to the final central FISH results, there were 10% more subjects in the 
Clb+Ob arm with either del 17p or del 11q. In order to use the most complete information, the 
unstratified analysis was used for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint (PFS by IRC) and 
all secondary endpoints. In addition, the original planned stratified analysis for primary endpoint 
(PFS by IRC) was maintained as a sensitivity analysis. 
•  Based on updated IWCLL guidelines (Hallek et al, 2018), in which there is new emphasis on the 
importance of testing for IGHV mutational status, an additional analysis for PFS was conducted 
inclusive of this high-risk population.

One of the deviations resulted in a major hemorrhagic event (continuation of ibrutinib dosing prior to a 
surgical procedure to remove a central catheter, where the subject subsequently developed a hematoma 
requiring surgical evacuation).

Updated analyses (cut off 28.02.2019) 
For the ITT population, at an event rate of 23% in the experimental arm and 63% in the control arm, the 
risk of disease progression or death per investigator assessment was reduced by 74.9% for Ibr+Ob vs. 
Clb+Ob (HR = 0.251, 95% CI: 0.160, 0.395). The median PFS was not estimable for the Ibr+Ob arm and 
was 21.9 months for the Clb+Ob arm. The Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate per investigator 
assessment at 36 months were 76.3% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 32.6% for the Clb+Ob arm. 
For the high-risk population, at an event rate of 26% in the experimental arm and 83% in the control 
arm,the risk of disease progression or death per investigator assessment was reduced by 83.8% for 
Ibr+Ob vs. Clb+Ob (HR = 0.162, 95% CI: 0.096, 0.275). The median PFS was not reached for the 
Ibr+Ob arm and was 18.0 months for the Clb+Ob arm. The Kaplan-Meier point estimates of the PFS rate 
Assessment report

per investigator assessment at 36 months were 72.4% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 12.0% for the Clb+Ob 
arm. 
Given the higher proportion of discontinuation of study treatment in the experimental arm, mostly related 
to adverse events and unacceptable toxicity, a sensitivity analysis was requested, imputing an event at 
the time of discontinuation of treatment, instead of censoring, if a PFS event was not determined at a later 
time. Not unexpectedly, considering the longer time on treatment in the Ibr+Ob arm, the imputation of 
treatment discontinuation due to reasons other than progressive disease (PD) as a progressive event 
increases the hazard of progression. The HR between the Ibr+Ob arm and the Clb+Ob arm is increased 
from 0.231 (95% CI: 0.145, 0.367) in the CSR submitted to 0.327 (95% CI: 0.219, 0.486) for the 
unstratified analysis, and from 0.229 (95% CI: 0.144, 0.366) in the CSR submitted  to 0.316 (95% CI: 
0.211, 0.473) for the stratified analysis. Nevertheless, the difference between the 2 treatment arms 
remains statistically significant. 
Secondary endpoints 
Note: Secondary efficacy endpoints were tested with a closed testing procedure at the 
2-sided significance level of 0.05. The first endpoint in the testing order (PFS in del 17p/TP53 
mutation/del 11q high-risk subpopulation) met statistical significance. The next endpoint in the testing 
order (ie, rate of sustained hemoglobin improvement) did not meet statistical significance. As a result, all 
p-values for subsequent endpoints (ie, rate of MRDnegative response, ORR by IRC, OS, rate of sustained 
platelet improvement, rate of IRRs, and rate of clinically meaningful improvement in EQ-5D-5L utility 
score) are presented nominally.

should be interpreted accordingly. At an event rate of 18% in both study arms, the median OS was not 
reached for either treatment arm; the OS for both arms was similar (HR = 0.969, 95% CI: 0.525, 1.789). 
The Kaplan-Meier point estimate for the OS rate at 36 months was 82.7% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 82.3% 
for the Clb+Ob arm. 
Rate of Infusion-related Reactions 
The rate of serious or ≥ Grade 3 IRRs identified by MedDRA PT was 2.7% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 8.6% 
for the Clb+Ob arm (nominal pvalue= 0.0835).  
The rate of IRRs of any grade identified by MedDRA PT was 24.8% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 57.8% for the 
Clb+Ob arm (nominal p-value< 0.0001).

Exploratory/other analyses 
Time to Next Treatment 
The percentages of subjects who started their next treatment were 3.5% for the Ibr+Ob arm and 44.0% 
for the Clb+Ob arm.  
There was a 93.7% reduction in the risk of the requirement for next treatment observed for the Ibr+Ob 
arm relative to the Clb+Ob arm (HR = 0.063, 95% CI: 0.023, 0.175; p < 0.0001).  
The median time to next treatment was not reached for either treatment arm. At the 30-month landmark 
time point, an estimated 96.2% of subjects in the Ibr+Ob arm and 51.3% for the Clb+Ob arm had not 
received subsequent treatment. 
Medical Resource Utilization 
Medical resource utilization was evaluated during the first 9 months of study treatment. 
In the Ibr+Ob arm, 44 subjects were hospitalized, and the median number of hospitalizations was 1.0 
(with a median of 6.5 days of hospitalization). Seventeen subjects had emergency room visits, and the 
median number of emergency room visits was 1.0. During the first 9 months, 14 subjects (12.4%) 
received blood supportive products, while 24 subjects (21.2%) received growth factors.  
In the Clb+Ob arm, 35 subjects were hospitalized, and the median number of hospitalizations was 1.0 
(with a median of 7.0 days of hospitalization). Fifteen subjects had emergency room visits, and the

median number of emergency room visits was 1.0. During the first 9 months, 24 subjects (20.7%) 
received blood supportive products, while 47 subjects (40.5%) received growth factors. 
Lymphocytosis 
Lymphocytosis was defined as an elevation in ALC of ≥ 50% compared to baseline and to ≥ 5,000/μL at 
a post-baseline assessment. For subjects with lymphocytosis, resolution of lymphocytosis was defined as 
a decrease of ALC value to the baseline level or lower, or an ALC value that was below 5,000/μL, 
whichever occurred first.  
Treatment-emergent lymphocytosis occurred in 8 subjects (7.2%) in the Ibr+Ob arm and 1 subject 
(0.9%) in the Clb+Ob arm. For subjects who developed lymphocytosis, the median time to lymphocytosis 
was 1.1 weeks (range: 1.0 to 2.1 weeks) for the Ibr+Ob arm and 2.1 weeks for the 1 subject in the 
Clb+Ob arm. The median time to resolution was 3.1 weeks (95% CI: 1.3 to 7.0 weeks) in the Ibr+Ob arm 
and 6.3 weeks for the 1 subject in the Clb+Ob arm. These events resolved in all subjects in both 
treatment arms.

Comparison with study 1115 
The Applicant has also provided a comparison of efficacy data between study 1115 (ibrutinib 
monotherapy vs chlorambucil monotherapy, n=269, data cutoff of 28 May 2015) and study 1130, both 
recruiting previously untreated patients with CLL/SLL. The median subject age was 71.0 years in Study 
1130 and 73.0 years in Study 1115, with the majority of subjects being white (96.1% and 91.1%, 
respectively) and male (range: 63.8% and 62.8%, respectively). Greater than 90% of subjects across 
both studies had CLL and an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1. Baseline Rai Stage of III or IV was 
reported for 52.0% of subjects in Study 1130 and 45.4% of subjects in Study 1115. 
Study 1115 excluded subjects with a chromosome 17p deletion; whereas 14.0% of subjects in Study 
1130 had a del17p at baseline. In Study 1115, data for IGHV mutational status and TP53 mutational 
testing were not included in the original analysis and clinical study report. Testing results for IGHV 
mutational status and TP53 mutations were subsequently updated. In Study 1115, 53.2% of subjects had 
high-risk genomic features (mutated TP53/del11q/unmutated IGHV). In Study 1130, 64.6% of subjects 
had high-risk genomic features (ie, del17p/mutated TP53/del11q/unmutated IGHV)”.

Long-term efficacy: Studies 1112 and 1115/1116 
Study 1112 
Study 1112 is an ongoing, Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, open-label, comparator-controlled study in 
subjects with previously treated CLL/SLL. The study compared the efficacy and safety of orally 
administered ibrutinib 420 mg/day with that of ofatumumab administered IV at an initial dose of 300 mg 
followed by 11 doses of 2,000 mg over a 24-week period. Randomization of subjects into both treatment 
arms was 1:1, and subjects received ibrutinib until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity was 
observed, whichever occurred first. Baseline disease characteristics indicate that high-risk genomic 
features were consistent across the treatment groups (ibrutinib vs ofatumumab). Genomic analyses of 
high-risk features indicate that 32.5% of subjects had del17p, 24.3% had del11q, and 46.5% had 
unmutated IGHV; subjects with these high-risk genomic features comprised 82.4% of the study 
population. 
The updated efficacy results are based on a median time on study of 56 months in Study 1112; 133  of 
the 196 subjects (67.9%) originally randomized to the ofatumumab treatment arm crossed over to 
ibrutinib treatment, with 63 (47.4%) of those 133 subjects still on ibrutinib treatment.

Subjects (n=127) with del 17p: 
The median investigator-assessed PFS was 40.6 months in the ibrutinib arm vs. 6.2 months in the 
ofatumumab arm (HR=0.124, 95% CI: 0.074, 0.208); 
The investigator-assessed ORR was 88.9% for the ibrutinib arm vs. 18.8% for the ofatumumab arm. 
Study 1115/1116 
Study 1115 compared the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib with Clb, both administered as single oral 
agents, in subjects with previously untreated CLL/SLL. Chlorambucil was administered on Days 1 and 15 
of each 28-day cycle for a maximum of 12 cycles. Subjects in Study 1115 were transferred to extension 
Study 1116 after IRC confirmation of disease progression or at study closure, whichever occurred first. 
Study 1116 was prospectively designed in conjunction with Study 1115 to ensure retention of subjects 
and allow for collection of long-term safety and efficacy data in all subjects randomized in Study 1115 for 
at least 5 years following the first subject enrolled in this parent study. Study 1116 was also designed to 
provide continued treatment for subjects in the ibrutinib arm who had not progressed, and to allow 
second-line therapy after progressive disease to study subjects. Baseline disease characteristics indicate 
that high-risk genomic features were consistent across the treatment groups (ibrutinib vs Clb). Genomic 
analyses indicated that 5.9% had a del17p/TP53 mutation, 20.1% of subjects had a del11q mutation, and 
43.9% had unmutated IGHV; subjects with these high-risk genomic features comprised 53.2% of the 
study population. 
In Study 1116, disease progression and response were assessed by the investigator; there was no IRC 
assessment. After disease progression, second-line therapy, when clinically indicated, could include 
ibrutinib for subjects randomized to the Clb arm. All subjects were followed for progression and survival. 
The updated efficacy results provided in this report are based on a median time on study of 48 months in 
Studies 1115/1116. One hundred thirty-six subjects received ibrutinib and 133 subjects received Clb. At 
the time of the long-term efficacy update, 73 (54.9%) of the 133 subjects originally randomized to the Clb 
treatment arm crossed over to ibrutinib treatment, with 44 (60.3%) of those 73 crossover subjects still on 
ibrutinib treatment.

Table 27: Progression-free Survival (Intent-to-Treat Population, Studies 1115/1116) 
The HR for the subjects with the high-risk features (mutated TP53/del11q/unmutated IGHV) was 0.068; 
95% CI: 0.037, 0.127, consistent with the intent-to-treat population at a median follow-up of 48 months.  
ORR: The investigator-assessed ORR (PR or better) was 91.2% in the ibrutinib arm vs. 36.8% in the Clb 
arm. Compared to the primary analysis, the ORR increased with further ibrutinib treatment as subjects 
with stable disease or PR with lymphocytosis in Study 1115 achieved PR or better with further follow-up. 
Notably, improvement in investigator-assessed CR rates continued to increase with ongoing ibrutinib 
treatment.  
Twenty-six subjects were confirmed as complete responders by the Sponsor based on IWCLL response 
criteria (Hallek 2008). Sponsor-confirmed CRs were observed in 22 subjects (16.2%) in the ibrutinib arm 
and 4 subjects (3.0%) in the Clb arm.  
OS: The median OS was not reached in either arm.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application is based on one pivotal study, 1130: “A Randomized, Multicenter, Open-label, Phase 3 
Study of the Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Ibrutinib in Combination with Obinutuzumab versus 
Chlorambucil in Combination with Obinutuzumab in Subjects with Treatment-naive Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma”. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study enrolled patients who were 65 years of age or older or <65 years of age with coexisting medical 
conditions, reduced renal function as measured by creatinine clearance <70 mL/min, or presence of 
del17p/TP53 mutation. Notably, the study only enrolled patients ≥65 years, or younger with 
comorbidities or 17p del/TP53 mutation, with previously untreated measurable nodal CLL/SLL requiring 
treatment. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either IMBRUVICA 420 mg daily until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity or chlorambucil at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 of each 
28-day cycle for 6 cycles. In both arms, patients received 1000 mg of obinutuzumab on Days 1, 8 and 
15 of the first cycle, followed by treatment on the first day of 5 subsequent cycles (total of 6 cycles, 
28 days each). The first dose of obinutuzumab was divided between day 1 (100 mg) and day 2 (900 mg). 
Standard dose and regimen were used for all study drugs. The control arm corresponds to the regimen 
used in the pivotal study supporting the approval for “Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 
(CLL) and with comorbidities making them unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine based therapy”. In that 
study, similar to study 1130, subjects had to present a comorbidity score (CIRS) of greater than 6 and/or 
reduced renal function as measured by CrCl <70 mL/min, but age was not considered for inclusion. 
Subjects on the control arm were eligible to receive ibrutinib monotherapy as next-line treatment. 
The amendments, changes in planned analyses and protocol violations are not considered likely to impact 
on  the interpretation of the study results. Based on external information in terms of updated IWCLL 
guidelines during the study, emphasizing the importance of IGHV status, a high-risk population including 
this marker was defined. Final central FISH results, prior to database lock, revealed an imbalance for del 
17p/del 11q between the study arms, with 10% higher prevalence in the control arm (the MAH considers 
that this numerical imbalance between treatment arms may have been due to multifactorial reasons 
(eg, hierarchical stratification input and multiple genomic factors)). This was addressed by using the 
unstratified analysis for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints; the 
high-risk population, including IGHV status, was balanced between study arms. The originally planned 
stratified analysis for the primary endpoint was kept as a sensitivity analysis. The chosen analyses are 
generally considered acceptable. The rationale for using a non-stratified log-rank test for the primary 
outcome is understood with reference to new guidance on IGHV status during study conduct – without 
this marker the high-risk population could be unbalanced.  
The control regimen in high-risk disease, which corresponds to the regimen used in the pivotal study 
supporting the approval for “Gazyvaro in combination with chlorambucil is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and with comorbidities 
making them unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine based therapy”is deemed appropriate. In that study, 
similar to study 1130, subjects had to present a comorbidity score (CIRS) of greater than 6 and/or 
reduced renal function as measured by CrCl <70 mL/min, but age was not considered for inclusion. In 
study 1130 also fit subjects with high-risk disease, including del 17p, were enrolled, which would today be

considered obsolete. However, as the study was planned before the first approval of B cell receptor 
inhibitors, and considering the known inferior results obtained with FCR in this group, the control regimen 
must be deemed acceptable also for subjects with high-risk disease.  
The prospected median PFS for the control arm corresponds to the observed outcome in the 
obinutuzumab+chlorambucil arm in the BO21004/CLL11 registration study. No stratification for IGHV 
status was performed. Outcome per IGHV status was a predefined subgroup analysis. The results of the 
unstratified tests are presented as the primary results. The stratified analysis results are presented as a 
sensitivity analysis. The results are very similar. It is preferred that the statistical analysis model reflects 
the randomisation procedure however in this study were an imbalance occurred it is accepted to use the 
unstratified analysis as primary. Statistical methods and the method for controlling type I error rate are 
otherwise considered acceptable.  
The design of the pivotal study, ibr+obi vs chl+obi, does not allow isolation of the contribution of each of 
the drug components to the effect. Specifically, it is not known to what extent obinutuzumab adds to the 
efficacy of ibrutinib. Indeed, in a recently published study, the combination of ibrutinib with another 
anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, was in terms of PFS not superior to ibrutinib monotherapy in subjects ≥65 
years with previously untreated CLL (Woyach et al, NEJM, 2018: Dec 1). However, as ibrutinib could be 
viewed as a substitution of chlorambucil in the approved combination with obinutuzumab, the strategy is 
considered acceptable from a regulatory perspective. The MAH is encouraged to further investigate the 
efficacy of ibrutinib + obinutuzumab vs ibrutinib monotherapy. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study PCYC-1130-CA randomized 229 patients. The median age was 71 years (range, 40 to 87 years), 
64% were male, and 96% were Caucasian. All patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 
(48%) or 1-2 (52%). At baseline, 52% had advanced clinical stage (Rai Stage III or IV), 32% of patients 
had bulky disease (≥5 cm), 44% with baseline anemia, 22% with baseline thrombocytopenia, 28% had 
a CrCL <60 mL/min, and the median Cumulative Illness Rating Score for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) was 4 
(range, 0 to 12). At baseline, 65% of patients presented with CLL/SLL with high risk factors (del17p/TP53 
mutation [18%], del11q [15%], or unmutated IGHV [54%]).  
Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by IRC according to IWCLL criteria indicated a 77% 
statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or progression in the IMBRUVICA arm.   
Given the higher proportion of discontinuation of study treatment in the experimental arm, a sensitivity 
analysis was requested, imputing an event at the time of discontinuation of treatment, instead of 
censoring, if a PFS event was not determined at a later time. Not unexpectedly, considering the longer 
time on treatment in the Ibr+Ob arm, the imputation of treatment discontinuation due to reasons other 
than progressive disease (PD) as a progressive event increases the hazard of progression. The HR 
between the Ibr+Ob arm and the Clb+Ob arm is increased from 0.231 (95% CI: 0.145, 0.367) in the CSR 
submitted to 0.327 (95% CI: 0.219, 0.486) for the unstratified analysis, and from 0.229 (95% CI: 0.144, 
0.366) in the CSR submitted  to 0.316 (95% CI: 0.211, 0.473) for the stratified analysis. Nevertheless, 
the difference between the 2 treatment arms remains statistically significant. 
The treatment effect of ibrutinib was consistent across the high-risk CLL/SLL population (del 17p/TP53 
mutation, del 11q, or unmutated IGHV), with a PFS HR of 0.15 [95% CI (0.09, 0.27)]. The 2-year PFS rate 
estimates for the high-risk CLL/SLL population were 78.8% [95% CI (67.3, 86.7)] and 15.5% [95% CI 
(8.1, 25.2)] in the IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab and chlorambucil+obinutuzumab arms, respectively. 
With a median follow-up time on study of 31 months, the median PFS was not reached in the 
IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab arm and was 19 months in the chlorambucil+obinutuzumab arm.

The external validity of the study is not challenged in relation to the intended study population with a 
mean age of 71 years and 20% of subjects younger than 65 years. An overall median follow-up of 31 
months, an event rate of 64% in the control arm, and consistent sensitivity analyses all support a robust 
estimate of the primary outcome measure (unstratified PFS according to IRC), and pre-planned subgroup 
analyses show internal consistency with favourable efficacy for the experimental arm in subjects with 
high-risk features as well as in the complementary group.  
Note that OS data, as expected in first-line treatment of CLL, was immature at the data cut-off of March 
2018 with an event rate of 16% in the control arm. 
Long-term efficacy is supported by reported data from the 1112 and 1115/1116 studies. With a median 
follow-up time on study of 56 months in Study PCYC-1112-CA, an 86% reduction in the risk of death or 
progression by investigator assessment was observed for patients in the IMBRUVICA arm. The median 
investigator-assessed PFS according to IWCLL criteria was 44.1 months [95% CI (38.54, 56.87)] in the 
IMBRUVICA arm and 8.1 months [95% CI (7.79, 8.25)] in the ofatumumab arm, respectively; HR=0.14 
[95% CI (0.11, 0.19)]. The investigator-assessed ORR in the IMBRUVICA arm was 87.2% versus 22.4% 
in the ofatumumab arm. At the time of long-term follow-up, 133 (67.9%) of the 196 subjects originally 
randomized to the ofatumumab treatment arm had crossed over to ibrutinib treatment. The Kaplan-Meier 
landmark estimate for OS at 60-months was 62.2% in the IMBRUVICA arm. 
The outcomes of the subgroup analyses are generally consistent but HR point estimates associated with 
high-risk features are generally lower than for the complementary groups.  
ORR, based on IRC assessment, was 88% in the experimental arm and 73% in the control arm. The 
corresponding figures for CR were 20% and 8%, respectively. It is noted that time to normalisation of ALC 
was faster in the control arm, 1.4 weeks vs 8.3 weeks in the experimental arm. With only 17 (15%) 
events in the experimental arm and 19 (16%) in the control arm data are immature. The early deaths 
noted in the experimental arm are discussed in the safety section. Overall, no trend for a worse outcome 
in the experimental arm is noted. 
With almost a year longer follow-up, with 3 additional events in the experimental arm and 2 in the control 
arm, the median OS was not reached for either treatment arm; the OS for both arms was similar (HR = 
0.969, 95% CI: 0.525, 1.789). OS data is still immature. A further update is expected with the final CSR. 
MRD negativity rates in the bone marrow were similar between study arms, around 20%. 
Infusion-related reactions (i.e. obinutuzumab-related) were numerically less frequently noted in the 
experimental arm and were observed in 25% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab and 
58% of patients treated with chlorambucil+obinutuzumab. Grade 3 or higher or serious infusion-related 
reactions were observed in 3% of patients treated with IMBRUVICA+obinutuzumab and 9% of patients 
treated with chlorambucil+obinutuzumab. Achievement of sustained platelet improvement in subjects 
with thrombocytopenia at baseline was roughly similar between study arms. New treatment was started 
for 44% and 3.5% of subjects in the control and experimental arm, respectively; HR 0.063. The median 
time to next treatment was not reached for either treatment arm. 
The MAH applies for an indication in all patients with previously untreated CLL while the studied 
population is restricted to patients ≥65 years, or younger with comorbidities or 17p del/TP53 mutation. A 
similar extrapolation was extensively discussed in the II-16 variation, where the pivotal 1115 study 
investigating ibrutinib monotherapy vs chlorambucil monotherapy in subjects ≥65 years with previously 
untreated CLL ultimately lead to the approval of ibrutinib monotherapy in all previously untreated 
patients with CLL.

2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy results are robust and support clinically relevant benefit of Imbruvica in the sought 
indication.  
The MAH accepted a recommendation from the CHMP to provide post-approval data on PFS2 or 
corresponding proxy from Study PCYC-1130 (expected in 3Q 2020). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The 7 studies forming the basis of the authorized indications in the ibrutinib EU SmPC are: Studies 
PCYC-1102-CA, PCYC-1112-CA, PCYC-1115-CA, and PCI-32765CLL3001 (hereafter referred to as 
Studies 1102, 1112, 1115, and CLL3001) for CLL; Study PCYC-1118E (hereafter referred to as Study 
1118E) for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM); and Studies PCYC-1104-CA and 
PCI-32765MCL3001 (hereafter referred to as Studies 1104 and MCL3001) for mantle cell lymphoma 
(MCL). Data for the 981 ibrutinib-treated subjects from these 7 pivotal studies are referred to as the 
Current Label Pool.  
Safety data from Study 1130, both separately and together with safety data from Study 1127, were 
integrated with those for Current Label Pool, ie, the registrational studies representing the currently 
approved indications in the ibrutinib SmPC, for determination of the ADR profile for ibrutinib as a single 
agent or in combination therapy. The integrated population of Study 1130, Study 1127, and the Current 
Label Pool is referred to as the “Overall Label Pool” and represents data from 1,200 ibrutinib-treated 
subjects.  Relative to the currently approved ADR table for ibrutinib in the IMBRUVICA SmPC, no new 
ADRs were identified based on the addition of data from Studies 1130 or 1127.

Adverse events were coded using MedDRA version 20.1. 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events Over Time 
Study 1130: For the following common TEAEs (≥10% per period), a suggestion of an increase in 
prevalence was observed with continued ibrutinib treatment (ie, difference of at least 2-fold between 
Days 1-90 and Days 271-365 [intervals of similar duration]), with consistently higher or stable rates for 
each subsequent time period compared with Days 1-90): upper respiratory tract infection (1.0% for Days 
1-90; 2.4% for Days 271-365), nasopharyngitis (1.0% for Days 1-90; 3.5% for Days 271-365), 
hypertension (2.9% for Days 1-90; 8.2% for Days 271-365), and atrial fibrillation (0% for Days 1-90; 
7.1% for Days 271-365). 
Current label pool: There were no apparent trends of an increase in prevalence over time for any 
specific common TEAEs in the Current Label Pool, with the exception of hypertension which was reported 
at prevalence rates of 3.4% for Days 1-90 and 7.9% for Days 271-365.

Treatment-emergent Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
Hemorrhage 
The proportions of subjects with a hemorrhage TEAE of any grade/severity or a major hemorrhagic TEAE 
in the ibrutinib+Ob arm of Study 1130 (44.2% and 4.4%, respectively) were consistent with those 
observed in the Current Label Pool (41.4% and 4.5%, respectively). 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
In Study 1130, TLS was reported in 1 subject (0.9%) in the ibrutinib+Ob arm (Grade 2) and in 7 subjects 
(6.1%) in the Clb+Ob arm (2.6% Grade 3 or 4).

Other Malignancies, Including Non-melanoma Skin Cancer 
Table 36: Other Malignancies, by PT in study 1130 and current label pool (safety population) 
The most common non-skin malignancy in the ib+Ob treatment arm was cancer involving the colon, 
reported in 3 subjects. 
Atrial fibrillation 
In Study 1130, atrial fibrillation TEAEs were reported for 14 subjects (12.4%) in the ibrutinib+Ob arm. 
The atrial fibrillation TEAE in the ibrutinib+Ob arm was Grade 3 or 4 in severity for 6 subjects (5.3%), 
serious in 5 subjects (4.4%; including 4 subjects with a Grade 3 or 4 event), and resulted in ibrutinib dose 
reduction in 1 subject (0.9%). For no subject in the ibrutinib+Ob arm did the atrial fibrillation TEAE result 
in ibrutinib discontinuation or death. 
The proportion of subjects with atrial fibrillation events in the ibrutinib+Ob arm was higher than that for 
the Current Label Pool (any grade: 6.4%; Grade 3 or higher: 3.3%); ibrutinib exposure was also 
considerably longer in Study 1130 than for the Current Label Pool 
No subject in the Clb+Ob arm of Study 1130 had an atrial fibrillation TEAE. 
Other Cardiac Arrhythmias (excluding atrial fibrillation) 
Table 37: Treatment emergent Other Cardiac Arrhythmias (excluding atrial fibrillation) by PT 
and max severity in Safety population  
In the Current Label Pool, 1.0% of subjects had a ventricular tachyarrhythmia TEAE, most of which were 
Grade 1 or 2 in severity (9/10 subjects) and nonserious (8/10 subjects).

Cytopenia 
Table 38: Sumamry of treatment – emergent cytopenia AEs in the Safety population 
Hypertension 
Hypertension TEAEs were reported for 16.8% of subjects in the ibrutinib+Ob arm of Study 1130, with 
3.5% of subjects having a Grade 3 or 4 hypertension TEAE. None of these events were serious or resulted 
in ibrutinib discontinuation. One subject (0.9%) had an ibrutinib dose reduction due to a hypertensive 
TEAE. 
In the Clb+Ob arm of Study 1130, hypertension TEAEs were reported for 4.3% of subjects (3.5% with 
Grade 3 or 4 events). 
While the reported incidence of hypertension TEAEs of any grade was higher for the ibrutinib+Ob arm 
compared with the Current Label Pool (9.9%) (possibly due to the longer treatment duration in the 
ibrutinib+Ob arm), the pattern of hypertension TEAEs in the 2 safety populations was similar with respect 
to the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs (3.8%) and very few events that were serious (0.6%) or resulted 
in ibrutinib dose reduction or discontinuation (0.1% each). 
Long-term safety Data – PAM 3038-1 
PRAC evaluated this study recently as MEA025 (CHMP conclusion 15/11/2018); please refer to that 
report. 
The MAH’s conclusions are as follows: “The results from the Year 4 interim analysis of PAM 3038-1 show 
no new safety concerns in patients on long-term ibrutinib therapy administered at 420 mg or 560 mg daily 
to subjects with CLL/SLL or MCL with a median treatment duration of 45.4 and 11.1 months, respectively 
(33.7 months overall across both indications). The overall known safety profile of ibrutinib-treated 
patients remained consistent, other than an increasing prevalence of hypertension, with no new safety 
signals identified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644912/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 54/55 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the safety of long-term exposure to ibrutinib in a subset of subjects with CLL/SLL (n=330) 
from Studies 1112 and 1115/1116 was in alignment with that observed for the larger LTS population 
(n=1,177)”. 
In the assessment report, it is concluded that “Overall this third interim report is not suggestive of any 
new safety concerns in patients exposed to ibrutinib for long term and no specific regulatory action is 
currently required”.  
Methodology for ADR Analysis  
The determination of updated information to Section 4.8 of the SmPC was based on the following steps:  
Step I. Data from Study 1130, either alone or with data from Study 1127, were pooled with data from the 
other 4 randomized controlled trials (1112, 1115, CLL3001, MCL3001). For the pooled analysis involving 
data from Study 1130 (ibrutinib+Ob arm) and Study 1127 (ibrutinib+rituximab arm of double-blind 
study), integrated TEAE data from the 1,883 subjects (944 ibrutinib, 939 comparator) comprising this 
Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) population were examined as follows:  
o 
Individual TEAE preferred terms that met the following criteria were identified (note, the same 
grouped terms as used in the current ADR section of the SmPC were used):   
  TEAE reported in ≥10% of subjects in the pooled RCT ibrutinib group and reported at a ≥5% 
higher incidence compared to the pooled RCT comparator group.  
  Serious TEAEs reported in ≥2% of subjects in pooled RCT ibrutinib group and reported at a 
≥2% higher incidence compared to the pooled RCT comparator group. 
Step II. Medical review of each potential ADRs identified in Step I was conducted. In addition, a review 
all ADRs from the current SmPC and any events from the completed individual studies was conducted to 
identify additional ADRs that are biologically plausible based on the current biological and clinical 
knowledge of ibrutinib therapy (eg, mechanism of action, pharmacological profile or well-established ADR 
for ibrutinib from other clinical trials or postmarketing spontaneous reports, consistent trending across 
multiple studies). 
Step III. A final list of ADRs identified in Steps I and II above was compiled. This list was then applied to 
the safety population that integrates data from the pivotal studies representing the currently approved 
and proposed extended indications in CLL/SLL (1130, 1102, 1112, 1115, CLL3001); WM (1118E, 1127 
[not included for updated ADR determination based on inclusion of data from 1130 only]); and 
MCL (1104, MCL3001). This Overall Label Pool represents data from a total of 1,200 subjects receiving 
ibrutinib as monotherapy or in combination therapy across these 9 studies. 
Results 
Based on the new safety information from Studies 1130 and 1127, no new ADRs were identified for 
ibrutinib and the frequencies of reported ADRs were similar to those reported in the currently approved 
SmPC; please refer to separate SmPC. 
Of the 1,200 subjects treated with ibrutinib for CLL, WM, or MCL comprising the Overall Label Pool, 5.1% 
discontinued treatment primarily due to ADRs. These included pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, hemorrhage, 
and thrombocytopenia. Adverse drug reactions leading to dose reduction occurred in 6.6% of the 1,200 
subjects. 
Of the 1,200 patients treated with ibrutinib in the Overall Label Pool, 64% were 65 years of age or older. 
Grade 3 or higher pneumonia occurred more frequently among elderly patients treated with ibrutinib 
(12% of patients age ≥65 versus 7% of patients <65 years of age).

Laboratory findings 
Table 43: chemistry TEAEs worst toxicity grade (safety population) 
The occurrence of subjects meeting laboratory criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) event 
post baseline (ALT or AST >3 x ULN, with total bilirubin >2 x ULN and ALP ≤2 x ULN within 28 days after 
elevation in ALT or AST) (Hy’s law criteria) was investigated. No subject in the ibrutinib+Ob or Clb+Ob 
arms of Study 1130 met these laboratory criteria, while 4 ibrutinib-treated subjects (0.4%) in the Current 
Label Pool met these criteria.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table 44: Discontinuations in Study 1130 
The only TEAE preferred term that led to ibrutinib discontinuation in >1 subject in the ibr+Ob treatment 
arm was thrombocytopenia (2 subjects; 1.8%). For 13 of the total of 19 subjects , the TEAE(s) leading to 
ibrutinib discontinuation were serious, including the 5 subjects who had a fatal TEAE and 8 subjects with 
non-fatal serious TEAEs (bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, osteoarthritis, 
pneumonia and cerebrovascular accident, respiratory tract infection, hemoptysis, non-small cell lung 
cancer, and thrombocytopenia). 
In the Clb+Ob arm, 11 subjects (9.6%) had a TEAE that resulted in discontinuation of Clb, with 
infusion-related reactions being the only TEAE that led to discontinuation in more than 1 subject in this 
arm (n=2, 1.7%). In the ibrutinib+Ob arm, there were no subjects who discontinued obinutuzumab due 
to an IRR (based on PT). In the Clb+Ob arm, infusion-related reactions (based on PT) leading to 
obinutuzumab discontinuation occurred in 7 subjects (6.1%).  
Assessment report

The overall incidence of TEAEs leading to ibrutinib discontinuation in the ibrutinib+Ob arm of Study 1130 
was consistent with that for the Current Label Pool (11.4%). Those TEAEs that led to ibrutinib 
discontinuation in 5 or more subjects in the Current Label Pool were pneumonia (n=12, 1.2%), atrial 
fibrillation (n=7, 0.7%), subdural hematoma (n=7, 0.7%), thrombocytopenia (n=6, 0.6%), sepsis (n=5, 
0.5%), and neutropenia (n=5, 0.5%). 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction or Interruption 
In Study 1130, TEAEs of any grade leading to an ibrutinib dose reduction were reported for 15.0% of 
subjects in the ibrutinib+Ob arm. Similarly, TEAEs of any grade led to a reduction in the dose of Clb for 
12.2% of subjects. Neutropenia was the only individual TEAE that led to a reduction in the dose of 
ibrutinib (5.3%) or Clb (9.6%) in 2% or more of subjects. 
In the Ibr+Ob arm, infusion-related reactions (based on PT) leading to obinutuzumab interruption 
occurred in 7 subjects (6.2%); 1 subject (0.9%) experienced a Grade 3 or higher IRR leading to 
obinutuzumab interruption. In the Clb+Ob arm, infusion-related reactions (based on PT) leading to 
obinutuzumab interruption occurred in 35 subjects (30.4%); 4 subjects (3.5%) experienced a Grade 3 or 
higher IRR leading to obinutuzumab interruption. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The substantially longer duration of treatment in the Ibr+Obi arm vs the Clb+Obi arm of study 1130, and 
also vs the Current label pool, should be noted when comparing AE rates between the groups. Here, the 
analysis of AEs and correlated rates in study 1130 during the first 9 months of study is considered of 
major interest. As could be expected, the differences between the study arms are smaller as compared to 
the overall analysis.  
Fatal AEs were reported for 6 subjects in the experimental arm vs 3 subjects in the control arm. 
Importantly, within the first 9 months of treatment, the proportion of subjects with fatal TEAEs was 5.3% 
(n=6) for the experimental arm and 2.6% (n=3) in the control arm. The verbatim for these cases, 
however, do not suggest any specific pattern of AEs leading to death. Having considered also the AEs 
leading to death after more than 9 months of treatment, no potentially specific safety signal not 
previously observed, i.e. non-skin cancer and cardiac, has been identified.  
Notwithstanding the different times on therapy, compared to the Current label pool, grade ≥3 events 
were slightly more prevalent in the experimental arm of study 1130. At the SOC level, blood/lymphatic 
system disorders, injury/poisoning/procedural complications, and cardiac disorders were numerically 
more frequent in the experimental arm of study 1130. Grade 3-4 events were overall reported at similar 
rates between study arms in 1130. At the SOC level, infections/infestations and cardiac disorders were 
more frequently reported in the experimental arm. 
With the exception of higher rates of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, rash maculo-papular, arthralgia, 
and infusion-related reaction, which all were more commonly reported in the experimental arm of study 
1130, the respective frequencies reasonably correspond to the Current label pool. At the SOC level, GI 
disorders, infections and infestations, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, 
respiratory/thoracic/mediastinal disorders, musculoskeletal/connective disorders, metabolism/nutrition 
disorders, and cardiac disorders were clearly more commonly reported in the experimental vs the control 
arm in study 1130. But, again, note the major difference in treatment duration. The prevalence of 
hypertension and atrial fibrillation seem to increase over time during treatment with ibrutinib. 
Based on the new safety information from Studies 1130 and 1127, no new ADRs were identified for 
ibrutinib and the frequencies of reported ADRs were similar to those reported in the currently approved 
SmPC. Having considered also the AEs leading to death after more than 9 months of treatment, no 
Assessment report

Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
potentially specific safety signal not previously observed, i.e. non-skin cancer and cardiac, has been 
identified. 
Discontinuation of treatment due to AE was more common in the experimental arm of study 1130 as 
compared to the control arm and the Current label pool; here, as for the outcomes, time on treatment 
must be considered. Discontinuation due to investigator/sponsor decision, subject refuses further 
treatment or “other” was more commonly reported in the experimental arm, in 10 subjects vs 1 in the 
control arm. Median time on study was similar between study arms. The TEAEs leading to most treatment 
discontinuations of ibrutinib were, in descending order, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, subdural 
hematoma, thrombocytopenia, sepsis and neutropenia. 
The long-term safety data over 4 years from 1177 patients (CLL/SLL n=807 and MCL n=370) treated 
with IMBRUVICA were analyzed. The median duration of treatment for CLL/SLL was 45 months with 70% 
and 40% of patients receiving treatment for more than 2 years and 4 years. The median duration of 
treatment for MCL was 11 months with 31% and 14% of patients receiving treatment for more than 
2 years and 4 years. The overall known safety profile of IMBRUVICA-exposed patients remained 
consistent, other than an increasing prevalence of hypertension, with no new safety concerns identified. 
The prevalence for Grade 3 or greater hypertension was 4% (year 0-1), 6% (year 1-2), 8% (year 2-3), 
and 8% (year 3-4). The incidence for the 4-year period was 10%. 
Considering the first 9 months of study participation, no major differences in terms of AE entity as 
described in the table above are noted, with the exception of AEs leading to obinutuzumab 
discontinuation or infusion interruption that were numerically more commonly reported in the control arm 
and are reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Given the unclear role/consequences of the QT shortening properties of ibrutinib ventricular arrhythmias 
are of potential interest to follow. Any grade and grade ≥3 events of cardiac arrhythmias excluding atrial 
fibrillation were more commonly reported in the experimental arm vs the control arm of study 1130, 
including three cases of tachycardia, two cases of syncope and one case each of ventricular extrasystoles, 
cardiac arrest and sudden death were noted. The difference in treatment duration, referring to the control 
arm of study 1130 as well as the Current label pool, complicates the interpretation of this dataset. Further 
vigilance is indicated. 
TEAEs of any other malignancy and non-skin cancer were more common in the experimental arm of study 
1130 as compared to the Current label pool, 13.3% vs 8.4% and 7.1% vs 2.5%, respectively. No clear 
pattern in terms of histology is obvious although 3 subjects in the experimental arm of study 1130 were 
reported with colon cancer. Most likely the very different exposure/observation times contribute to this 
finding but further vigilance is indicated. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
When adding safety data from the 1130 and 1127 (Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, parallel 
procedure) studies to the Current label pool, no new ADR was identified. 
Long-term safety is supported by the outcome of the recently assessed MEA025 (CHMP conclusion 
15/11/2018) where it was concluded that overall this third interim report is not suggestive of any new 
safety concerns in patients exposed to ibrutinib for long term. No regulatory action was required. 
Further, the MAH should keep monitoring reports of ventricular arrhythmias and secondary non-skin 
primary malignancies within the PSURs.

has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
CLL is a progressive hematologic disease characterized by an accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells 
in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymph organs; diagnosis requires the presence of ≥5000 
B-lymphocytes/µL in the peripheral blood. It is the most common form of adult leukemia in the Western 
world. Assessment of newly diagnosed patients for deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p), 
deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11 (del11q), mutated TP53, and immunoglobulin heavy-chain 
variable (IGHV) mutational status has prognostic and predictive value;  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In particular, patients with the del17p abnormality have an increased risk of relapse and death; the 
median life expectancy is 2 to 3 years from first-line treatment. It should be noted that the Clb+CD20 
antibody combination is not recommended in subjects with del 17p/TP53 mutated disease. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Pivotal study: PCYC-1130-CA was “A Randomized, Multicenter, Open-label, Phase 3 Study of the 
Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Ibrutinib in Combination with Obinutuzumab versus Chlorambucil in 
Combination with Obinutuzumab in Subjects with Treatment-naive Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or 
Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma”. Randomisation, stratified by ECOG 0-1 vs 2, and del 17p vs del 11q 
without del 17p vs others, was 1:1, n=229. The study Period was: 06 October 2014 (first informed 
consent signed) to 26 March 2018 (date of database lock). The study was conducted at a total of 9 sites 
in the US and 80 sites in rest-of-world (ROW). Patients ≥65 years, or younger with comorbidities or 17p 
del/TP53 mutation, with previously untreated measurable nodal CLL/SLL requiring treatment were 
enrolled. A six months treatment period for the control arm was compared with treatment until PD or 
toxicity for the experimental arm. Subjects on the control arm were eligible to receive ibrutinib 
monotherapy as next-line treatment. 
The event-driven primary endpoint was PFS assessed by IRC using non-EMA censoring rules, no interim 
analysis was performed. Due to imbalance of high-risk stratification factors between study arms, and new 
external guidance highlighting the prognostic impact of IGHV mutation status during study conduct, the 
originally planned stratified analysis of the primary outcome was, prior to database lock, changed to an 
unstratified analysis. With IGHV mutation status included, high-risk features were balanced between 
study arms. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
With a median follow-up of 31.3 months and an event rate of 64% in the control arm and 21% in the 
experimental arm, an unstratified analysis of IRC assessment of PFS showed a HR of 0.231 (0.145, 
0.367), p<0.0001. Use of the stratified Cox regression model showed a consistent outcome. The 
sensitivity analysis using an unstratified analysis of investigator assessment showed a HR of 0.260. Given 
the higher proportion of discontinuation of study treatment in the experimental arm, a sensitivity analysis 
was requested, imputing an event at the time of discontinuation of treatment, instead of censoring, if a 
PFS event was not determined at a later time. Not unexpectedly, considering the longer time on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/644912/2019  
Page 73/74

treatment in the Ibr+Ob arm, the imputation of treatment discontinuation due to reasons other than 
progressive disease (PD) as a progressive event increases the hazard of progression. The HR between the 
Ibr+Ob arm and the Clb+Ob arm is increased from 0.231 (95% CI: 0.145, 0.367) in the CSR submitted 
to. Nevertheless, the difference between the 2 treatment arms remains statistically significant. 
ORR, based on IRC assessment, was 88% in the experimental arm and 73% in the control arm. The 
corresponding figures for CR were 20% and 8%, respectively. Time to normalisation of absolute 
lymphocyte count was, however, faster in the control arm, 1.4 weeks vs 8.3 weeks in the experimental 
arm. 
With only 17 (15%) events in the experimental arm and 19 (16%) in the control arm at the time of the 
primary submission, OS data is immature. With almost a year longer follow-up, with 3 additional events 
in the experimental arm and 2 in the control arm, the median OS was not reached for either treatment 
arm; the OS for both arms was similar (HR = 0.969, 95% CI: 0.525, 1.789). OS data is still immature. A 
further update is expected with the final CSR. The early deaths noted in the experimental arm are 
discussed below. Overall, no trend for a worse outcome in the experimental arm is noted. 
Infusion-related reactions (i.e. obinutuzumab-related) were numerically less frequently noted in the 
experimental arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
As a six months treatment period for the control arm is compared with treatment until PD or toxicity for 
the experimental arm, and progress on vs off therapy has different prognostic implications, data on PFS2 
would be informative and will be provided along with the final analysis CSR for the 1130 study, in 3Q2020 
as recommended by the CHMP. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In relation to the known safety profile of ibrutinib no new ADRs or safety signals were observed. 
The prevalence of hypertension and atrial fibrillation seem to increase over time during treatment with 
ibrutinib. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Having considered also the AEs leading to death after more than 9 months of treatment, no potentially 
specific safety signal not previously observed, i.e. non-skin cancer and cardiac, has been identified.  
Ventricular arrhythmias and secondary non-skin primary malignancies will be monitored in the PSURs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The HR for the primary endpoint PFS of 0.231 - which following sensitivity analyses was revised to 0.327 
- is statistically significant and considered clinically highly relevant, not least in patients with high-risk 
disease. Also ORR and CR rates were in favour of the experimental arm, with long-term follow-up of other 
ibrutinib studies showing deepening responses over time. Thus, the PFS outcome can be considered 
robustly estimated. With approximately one additional year of follow-up, data remains essentially stable. 
The outcomes of the subgroup analyses are consistent. 
The rate and severity of obintuzumab infusion-related reactions were lower in the experimental arm as it 
seems Imbruvica has a protective effect over IRS triggered by the monoclonal antibody. OS results are 
too immature to evaluate but no negative trend for the experimental arm is noted in the KM graph. 
No new ADRs or safety signals were observed in relation to the known safety profile of ibrutinib. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The improved outcome in terms of PFS consistent among subgroups far outweighs the manageable safety 
profile of ibrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The indication encompasses all patients with previously untreated CLL while the studied population is 
restricted to patients ≥65 years, or younger with comorbidities or 17p del/TP53 mutation. A similar

extrapolation was extensively discussed in the II-16 variation, where the pivotal 1115 study investigating 
ibrutinib monotherapy vs chlorambucil monotherapy in subjects ≥65 years with previously untreated CLL 
ultimately lead to the approval of ibrutinib monotherapy in all previously untreated patients with CLL. 
Consistently, given the safety profile of the ibr+obi combination, there is no reason to restrict the use of 
this combination to a more narrow population than already approved for ibrutinib monotherapy. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Imbruvica in combination with obinutuzumab in CLL is positive.  
In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should submit the following safety data the next 
PSUR: Ventricular arrhythmias and secondary non-skin primary malignancies.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of indication to include combination use with obinutuzumab for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) for Imbruvica based on data from the 
phase 3 study PCYC-1130-CA; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took 
the opportunity to update the SmPC and Package Leaflet with minor editorial/administrative changes. An 
updated RMP (version 12) is agreed. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Imbruvica is not similar to obinutuzumab within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR VOSEVI 
(SOFOSBUVIR/VELPATASVIR/VOXILAPREVIR)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Vosevi. The RMP details important 
risks of Vosevi, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Vosevi’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Vosevi’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vosevi should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Vosevi should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Vosevi’s 
RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What is it Used for
Vosevi is authorized for treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in patients aged 12 years and 
older and weighing at least 30 kg (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains sofosbuvir 
(SOF), velpatasvir (VEL) and voxilaprevir (VOX) as active substances and it is given orally.
Further information about the evaluation of Vosevi’s benefits can be found in Vosevi’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vosevi.

Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks
Important risks of Vosevi, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Vosevi’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimizes its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vosevi is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A.
List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Vosevi are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vosevi. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risk(s) and Missing Information
Important Identified 
Risk
Severe bradycardia and heart block when used with concomitant amiodarone
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Cases of severe bradycardia have been observed when SOF-containing regimens are 
used in combination with amiodarone.

Measure(s)
Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities 
and/or advanced liver disease may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia 
with coadministration of amiodarone.

HBV reactivation in HBV/HCV coinfected patients
Cases of HBV reactivation have been reported in patients coinfected with HBV/HCV 
during or after treatment with DAAs. HBV reactivation can potentially be 
life-threatening, as it could result in hepatitis, an increase in transaminase levels, an 
increase in bilirubin levels, hepatic failure and death.
Due to the small number of cases of HBV reactivation with DAAs, risk factors have 
not been definitively established. However, some of the cases involving HBV 
reactivation with SOF-containing regimens involved patients who were 
immunocompromised (patients coinfected with HIV or patients receiving 
immunosuppressants due to prior transplant). In addition, a case involving severe 
HBV reactivation had risk factors of NASH and Burkitt’s lymphoma.

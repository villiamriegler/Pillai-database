INTRODUCTION 
On 6 December 2010, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Evoltra (clofarabine), in 
accordance with Article 46 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products 
for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Evoltra 
(clofarabine) and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1. 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the clinical study 
According to the MAH, clofarabine finished product, 1 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion, is 
formulated in 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) and is diluted for injection in 0.9% sodium 
chloride. The finished product formulation does not contain antioxidants or antimicrobial preservatives 
and is considered suitable for the paediatric use. The IV formulation of clofarabine used in 
CLO21800205 is the same formulation that has been extensively studied and approved in the US and 
EU for single-agent clofarabine therapy in paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALL.

3.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Clofarabine (Evoltra) is a second generation purine nucleoside that has a wide range of anti-tumour 
activity in both in vitro and in vivo human tumour models 
On 29 May 2006, clofarabine was approved under exceptional circumstances in the EU for treatment of 
ALL in paediatric patients who have relapsed or are refractory after receiving at least two prior 
regimens and where there is no other treatment option anticipated to result in a durable response. 
Safety and efficacy have been assessed in studies of patients between 1 and 21 years old at initial 
leukaemia diagnosis. 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 190112006, the MAH submitted a report for Study 
CL021800205: a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of clofarabine in combination with etoposide and 
cyclophosphamide in pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemias.

This was a phase 1/2 open label dose-escalation study of clofarabine in combination with etoposide 
and cyclophosphamide in paediatric patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukaemias (ALL or 
AML). This multicenter study included 16 investigators and 15 study centres in the United States. 
The study started on 11 March 2006 (first patient treated) and ended on 25 November 2009 (last 
phase 2 patient completed study drug); Date of data cut off: 11 May 2010. 
  Methods 
  Objective(s) 
Phase 1 
Primary Objective: 
• To determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the recommended 
Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of clofarabine when used in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide 
and to assess the feasibility and safety of this combination regimen to treat children with refractory or 
relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). 
Secondary Objectives: 
• To determine the safety and tolerability of clofarabine when used in combination with etoposide and 
cyclophosphamide and determine the duration, seriousness, and relationship of adverse events that 
occur during the treatment and follow-up periods; 
• To determine the overall remission (OR) rate (complete remission [CR] + complete remission in the 
absence of platelet recovery [CRp]) of clofarabine plus etoposide and cyclophosphamide in pediatric 
patients with refractory or relapsed ALL at the established clofarabine RP2D in combination with 
etoposide and cyclophosphamide; 
• To document the rate of partial remission [PR] in the study population; and 
• To document time-to-event parameters, including duration of remission, event-free survival [EFS], 4 
month EFS, and overall survival (OS). 
Phase 2 
Primary Objective: 
• To estimate the response rate (CR + CRp) at the RP2D in this study population. 
Secondary Objectives: 
• To determine the duration of remission, EFS, 4-month EFS, and OS in the study population; 
• To determine the safety and tolerability of clofarabine when used in combination with etoposide and 
cyclophosphamide and the duration, seriousness, and relationship of adverse events that occur during 
the treatment and follow-up periods; and

• To document the rate of PR(s) and “any response” (CR + CRp + PR) in the study population. 
Exploratory Studies: 
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics of clofarabine, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide when 
administered in combination. 
• To define apoptotic pathways in response to therapy in order to determine unique cell death 
pathways that are agent specific and also to identify pathways predictive of response. 
• To determine gene expression profiles at the time of second or subsequent relapse in order to 
discover mechanisms of resistance by comparing samples at the time of diagnosis and first relapse, 
and to isolate profiles that predict complete response. 
• To quantitate the level of nucleoside transporters (e.g., hENT1, hENT2, hCNT2, and hCNT3) in the 
blasts of children with relapsed or refractory ALL and correlate with the intracellular accumulation of 
clofarabine triphosphate and with clinical outcomes. 
• To correlate post remission events (relapse, death) with minimal residual disease at the end of the 
first induction and reinduction cycles and during consolidation. 
  Study design 
This was a phase I/II multi-centre, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to characterize the 
feasibility, safety, and efficacy of clofarabine in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide in 
refractory or relapsed ALL and AML (Phase 1 only) paediatric patients. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Phase 1 consisted of 5 dose cohorts with a total enrolment of 25 patients (20 ALL and 
5 AML patients). 
Twenty-five ALL patients were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion.

1 In the event an MTD is not identified earlier, Cohort 5 was to be RP2D 
2 Patients in the Phase 2 portion of the study were to be treated at the RP2D of clofarabine in combination 
with etoposide and cyclophosphamide as determined in the Phase 1 portion of the study. 
Duration of treatment: 
Patients could receive a maximum of 8 cycles (2 induction and 6 consolidation cycles or 1 induction 
and 7 consolidation cycles) of treatment. 
Safety: 
All patients who received any amount of any of the study drugs were included in the safety analyses. 
Safety analyses included the following: 
• The incidence, severity, duration, causality, seriousness, and type of adverse events and changes in 
clinical laboratory results. 
• In addition, deaths and other SAEs were tabulated. 
• Withdrawals due to adverse events. 
Efficacy: 
Efficacy analyses were performed on 3 efficacy populations, with the “Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Patients” considered as the primary analysis set. 
Analyses on the other 2 populations were considered secondary. 
The estimation of efficacy parameters was the primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of the study. 
Endpoints include OR, CR, CRp, and PR rates, duration of remission, time to remission, overall survival 
(OS), EFS, and the 4-month EFS rate. Information regarding the number of patients who proceed to 
transplant was evaluated in a separate analysis. The investigator-determined responses were used for 
efficacy analyses. Efficacy endpoints were summarized using descriptive statistics. 
The proportion of responders (OR, CR, CRp, PR, OR+PR) and the proportion of patients receiving 
transplant were computed and presented with exact 95% confidence intervals. 
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to summarize the distributions of EFS, OS, and duration of 
remission. 
Summary statistics for a subset of efficacy endpoints was presented for AML patients and for ALL 
patients treated at doses other than the RP2D.

In Phase 1: 16 (16/25; 64.0%) patients (ALL and AML) experienced overall remission (OR), based on 
the investigators’ assessment. The median duration of remission (DOR) censored at the last follow-up 
visit for these 16 responders was 18.2 weeks (Min/Max: 6.6/105.1+). The median DOR censored at 
the earlier date of alternative therapy or at the last follow-up visit for these responders was 17.0 
weeks (Min/Max: 2.3+/61.4+). The 25 Phase 1 patients experienced a median event-free survival 
(EFS) of 19.3 weeks and median overall survival (OS) of 27.1 weeks. Thirteen (13/25; 52.0%) Phase 1 
patients remained event-free at 4 months post first dose of study drugs. In general, the efficacy 
endpoints appear to be similar across the Phase 1 cohorts with the exception of OS. Median OS ranged 
from 52.9 weeks in Cohort 1 to 14.3 weeks in Cohort 5. Ten (10/25; 40.0%) Phase 1 patients were 
able to proceed to transplant, including 9 (9/25; 36.0%) patients who had achieved CR or CRp. 
In Phase 1, 11 (11/20; 55.0%) ALL and 5 (5/5; 100.0%) AML patients experienced OR. 
The median DOR censored at last follow-up visit for the ALL and AML responders was 22.6 weeks 
(Min/Max: 6.6/105.1+) and 15.6 weeks (Min/Max: 7.3/105.0+), respectively. 
The median DOR censored at the earlier date of alternative therapy or at the last follow up visit for the 
ALL and AML responders was 19.3 weeks (Min/Max: 2.3+/61.4) and 12.4 weeks (Min/Max: 
4.9+/17.0), respectively. Median EFS for ALL and AML patients was 18.0 and 19.3 weeks, respectively. 
Median OS was 28.4 weeks for the 20 ALL patients and 23.1 weeks for the 5 AML patients. Ten (10/20; 
50.0%) ALL and 3 (3/5; 60.0%) AML patients remained event-free at 4 months post first dose of study 
drugs. 
In the Phase 2 portion of the study (ALL patients only): 11 (11/25; 44.0%) patients experienced OR, 
based on the investigator’s assessment. The median DOR censored at last follow-up visit for these 11 
responders was 67.3 weeks (Min/Max: 2.9/109.6+), substantially longer compared to Phase 1 
responders. The median DOR censored at the earlier date of alternative therapy or at the last follow-up 
visit for Phase 2 patients was not estimable because the majority of events occurred after the initiation 
of alternative therapy. The median EFS and median OS for all 25 Phase 2 patients were the same at 
10.7 weeks. Eleven (11/25; 44.0%) Phase 2 patients remained event-free at 4 months post first dose 
of study drugs. Ten (10/25; 40.0%) Phase 2 patients were able to proceed to transplant, including 7 
(7/25; 28.0%) who had achieved CR or CRp. 
  Safety results 
Exposure  
Phase 1 (25 patients): the median cumulative amount of clofarabine received was 252.00 mg (range: 
85.0 to 1046.0 mg), median cumulative number of cycles received was 2 (range: 1 to 8 cycles), 
and the median duration between cycles was 34.0 days (range: 23 to 75 days). There were no 
significant differences in study drug exposure between ALL and AML patients. 
Phase 2 (25 patients): the median cumulative amount of clofarabine received was 370.00 mg (range: 
95.0 to 841.2 mg), median cumulative number of cycles received was 1 (range: 1 to 3 cycles), 
and the median duration between cycles was 28.5 days (range: 19 to 59 days).   
Dosing Modifications 
Phase 1: 4/25 (16.0%) patients experienced 1 or more dose modifications. Two patients experienced 
dose reductions and 2 patients experienced infusion interruption.   
•Pt 004-0015 (Cohort 4) experienced a total dose reduction of approximately 25% during Cycles 2 
through 5 due to AEs of increased lipase or pancreatitis. This patient also missed a clofarabine 
dose on Day 5 of Cycle 1 due to an AE (increased lipase).  
• Pt 004-0010 (Cohort 4) experienced a dose reduction of approximately 25% during Cycle 2 due to 
increased lipase.  
• Pt 005-0019 (Cohort 4) experienced an infusion interruption during Cycle 1 due to allergic reaction 
(flushing, agitation, throat tightness) to clofarabine. Patient received a subsequent cycle of clofarabine 
(Re-Induction Cycle 2) without any dosing complications.

Discussion on safety 
VOD/SOS 
Globally, seven patients developed AEs in which signs/symptoms of VOD represented a prominent 
component of each case (4 patients during the treatment period of the study and 3 patients after 
completion of the study in a post-transplant setting).  
For the 4 patients that developed these AEs during the treatment period of the study, these events 
were considered serious and related to clofarabine.  
For the 3 patients that developed these AEs after completion of the study in a post-transplant setting, 
these events were not considered to be related to clofarabine. An expert panel concluded that VOD was 
present in 1 patient and that VOD/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) could not be ruled in or out 
in 1 patient.  Ongoing infections preceded hepatoxicity in patients who were diagnosed with VOD or 
VOD-like symptoms.  However, 2 of the 4 patients who were diagnosed with VOD while on study 
treatment had received total body irradiation as conditioning for a HSCT prior to study entry.  The 
combination of the above factors likely contributed to the occurrence of VOD.   
After amending the protocol to exclude patients with prior HSCT, no new cases of VOD were reported 
in patients on study treatment. 
Myelosuppression 
Due to prolonged myelosuppression from prior therapies, this population was susceptible to a wide 
range of illnesses, particularly infections.  Infections were experienced as AEs, regardless of 
relationship to clofarabine, by the majority of patients in Phase 1 (20/25 [80.0%] patients) and Phase 
2 (19/25 [76.0%] patients).   
Of the various types of infections, bacterial infection was the most common (Phase 1: 14/25 [56.0%] 
patients, Phase 2: 14/25 [56.0%] patients).  The majority (68%) of AEs of infection were ≤Grade 3 in 
Phase 1 patients.   
Serious adverse events of infections, or sepsis/septic shock, were also associated with early deaths 
(defined as those deaths occurring within the first 8 weeks from start of study therapy). 
Deaths  
This study was not designed or powered to detect differences in survival, and patient assignment to 
dose or phase was not randomized.  However, there is a numerical difference noted in the median OS 
of Phase 1 patients (27.1 weeks; 95% CI 18.3, 42.9) and Phase 2 patients (10.7 weeks; 95% CI 8.1, 
38.6).  This difference is largely accounted for by the frequency of early (“early” is defined, for the 
purposes of this discussion, as those deaths occurring within the first 8 weeks from start of study 
therapy) deaths observed in Phase 2 (7/25; 28.0%) and in Phase 1 (1/25; 4.0%).   
Furthermore, in comparing median OS across the Phase 1 cohorts, the medians appear to 
decrease with increasing dose, albeit the numbers in each separate cohort are too few to 
draw any conclusions about dose effect in the individual early dose cohorts.  
In order to overcome the issue of small patient numbers within individual cohorts treated at lower 
doses and to allow more formal exploratory analysis of the numerically longer survival in these Phase 1 
cohorts, post-hoc, we further analyzed OS for all patients receiving RP2D (i.e., Phase 2 patients plus 
Phase 1 Cohort 5 patients; n=31), comparing against patients treated in Phase 1 Cohorts 1 to 4.  As 
with the comparison of Phase 1 and Phase 2, the proportion of early deaths observed in patients 
treated at RP2D was imbalanced compared with Phase 1 Cohorts 1 to 4 (8/31 [25.8%] vs. 0/19 
[0.0%]).   Exploratory analyses were undertaken to identify confounding factors and their impact on 
the observed difference on survival (Table 12-15).  Without adjusting for other covariates, Phase 1 
cohorts 1 to 4 appeared to have a lower risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] of 0.668 [95% CI 0.353, 
1.263; p=0.2139]).  Various clinical covariates were then evaluated as potential confounders, including 
leukemic cell lineage (T cell vs. B cell vs. AML), baseline ANC (Grade 3 or 4 at baseline vs. normal, 
Grade 1 or 2), prior HSCT (yes vs. no), refractoriness to prior chemotherapy regimen (yes vs. no) and 
baseline Lansky/Karnofsky performance status (≤70 vs. ≥80).  In both univariate and multivariate

RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
Currently,  clofarabine  is  used  as  monotherapy  in  ALL  paediatric  patients  who  have  relapsed  or  are 
refractory  after  receiving  at  least  two  prior  regimens.  The  recommended  dose  is  52 mg/m2  of  body 
surface area administered by intravenous infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 consecutive days. 
CLO21800205 study is a phase 1/2 open label dose-escalation study of clofarabine in combination 
with  etoposide  and  cyclophosphamide  in  paediatric  patients  with  refractory  or  relapsed  acute 
leukaemias  (ALL  or  AML).  Only  the  Phase  1  portion  of  the  study  was  open  to  both  ALL  and  AML 
patients.

Phase  I:  to  determine  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD),  dose-limiting  toxicity  (DLT),  and  the 
recommended  Phase  2  dose  (RP2D)  of  clofarabine  when  used  in  combination  with  etoposide  and 
cyclophosphamide  
Phase  II:  to  assess  the  feasibility  and  safety  of  this  combination  regimen  to  treat  children  with 
refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). 
Phase  I:  Based  on  efficacy  results  of  phase  I  study,  the  recommended  phase  2  dose  (RP2D)  was 
determined  to  be:  clofarabine  40  mg/m2,  cyclophosphamide  440  mg/m2  and  etoposide  100  mg/m2, 
each  given  daily  for  5  days.  There  were  responses  seen  across  all  cohorts  in  Phase  1  suggesting  an 
efficacious  effect  at  doses  less  than  the  RP2D.  Additionally,  responses  were  seen  in  ALL  as  well  as  in 
AML patients.

- 
The overall response rate was 64.0% among the 25 patients enrolled in Phase 1.  
Durability of remission as measured by the secondary endpoint of DOR was 18.2 weeks.   
-  Median EFS and OS were 19.3 and 27.1 weeks, respectively. 
- 
- 
Ten (40.0%) patients were able to proceed to transplant, including 9 (9/25; 36.0%) patients who 
had achieved CR or CRp. 
Twenty-one  (84.0%)  patients  died  during  the  study  treatment  period  or  during  the  follow-up 
period.   
The phase II of the study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Clofarabine with 
Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide in ALL paediatric patients. Inclusion criteria were the following: 
- Age ≤21 years at time of initial leukemia diagnosis. 
- Patients with ALL received no more than 3 prior induction regimens. 
Due to VOD (seven cases reported), the protocol was later amended to exclude patients who 
received prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).  
- 
- 
The median cumulative number of cycles received was 1 (range: 1 to 3 cycles)  
Overall Response rate = 44 %, median DOR = 67.3 weeks,  
-  Median EFS and OS= 10.7 weeks each  
- 
- 
Ten  (10/25;  40.0%)  Phase  2  patients  were  able  to  proceed  to  transplant,  including  7  (7/25; 
28.0%) who had achieved CR or CRp.  
20 patients (80.0%) experienced at least 1 SAE that was considered related to clofarabine per the 
investigator’s assessment.

1 patient (1/25; 4.0%) experienced a Grade 3 event,  
16 (16/25; 64.0%) patients experienced a Grade 4 event,  
8 (8/25; 32.0%) patients experienced a Grade 5 event.        
3 patients experienced a veno-occlusive liver disease.       
Overall  sixteen  (16/25;  64.0%)  patients  died  during  the  study  treatment  period  or  during  the 
follow-up period.   
In conclusion any new regimen with different combined chemotherapy to increase treatment options is 
awaited  and  should  be  more  explored.  These  efficacy  results  suggest  a  clinical  benefit  for  paediatric 
patients  with  refractory  or  relapsed  acute  leukaemias  when  clofarabine  is  used  in  combination  with 
other drugs and allow some of them to undergo HSCT.  
However no sufficient data have been submitted in the frame of this procedure to clearly justify the 
choice  of  the  R2PD.  In  contrast,  safety  results  show  that  the  combined  regimen  at  the  R2PD  is 
associated with a very high toxicity as evidenced by the 80.0% patients who experienced at least 1 
related SAE and the 3 cases of veno-occlusive disease reported in the phase II study.  
This  outstanding  toxicity  could  be  acceptable  if  it  can  be  translated  into  a  clinical  benefit  for  the 
patients. For the time being, HSCT is the only chance of cure in relapsed ALL patients. In the non 
randomized clinical trial CLO-212 which led to the approval of the current indication, a few number of 
ALL children relapsing after a previous HSCT could undergo a further HSCT.  
Hence  the  amendment  to  CL021800205  study  protocol  excluding  patients  who  previously  underwent 
HSCT may question the feasibility of HSCT in children who received the combination with R2PD. For the 
time  being  no  data  regarding  procedures  and  outcome  of  HSCT  are  available.  These  data  should  be 
provided within the next PSUR. 
  Recommendation  
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide, as part of this procedure P46, within the next 
PSUR, results regarding procedures and outcome of HSCT, from ALL studies investigating new 
combined regimen. 
ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATIONS REQUESTED 
The amendment to CL021800205 study protocol excluding patients who previously underwent HSCT 
may question the feasibility of HSCT in children who received the combination with R2PD. For the time 
being no data regarding procedures and outcome of HSCT are available. These data should be provided 
within the next PSUR.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 κ isotype monoclonal antibody fragment that 
selectively binds and neutralises vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. Binding of VEGF to its 
receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 triggers angiogenesis and neovascularisation by promoting vascular 
endothelial cell proliferation/ migration and an increased vascular permeability resulting in leakage, 
which is a mechanism involved in the development of vascular diseases of the retina. The 
neutralisation of VEGF results in a reduced angiogenesis and vascular leakage.

Lucentis (ranibizumab), was approved in the EU/EEA in 2007 via the centralised procedure for the 
treatment of neovascular (wet) age related macular degeneration (AMD). The indication was extended 
in 2011 for the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) and retinal vein 
occlusion (RVO). Lucentis is available as 10 mg/ml solution for injection. 
The recommended dose is 0.5 mg ranibizumab, which should be administered monthly until visual 
acuity is stable for three consecutive months. Thereafter, patient is monitored monthly and treatment 
is resumed when loss of visual acuity (VA) is indicated. 
With this application the MAH proposed to extend the indication to include treatment of visual 
impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to pathologic myopia (PM). For this 
indication, the MAH proposed that treatment be initiated with a single intravitreal (IVT) injection to be 
followed by additional injections only when there are signs of disease activity (loss of VA, lesion 
activity). It was furthermore proposed to extend the interval from the initial monthly monitoring with 
time. 
Problem statement 
CNV secondary to PM is considered one of the major causes of legal blindness in several countries and 
the leading cause of visual impairment in young patients worldwide. 
In PM the axial length of the eyeball is abnormally elongated (> 26 mm), which is associated with high 
myopia refractive errors (usually greater than -6.0 diopters [D]) and changes of the posterior pole of 
the eye such as posterior staphyloma, atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), Bruch’s 
membrane cracks, subretinal haemorrhage, retinal detachment, and CNV. CNV is considered the most 
vision threatening complication in patients with PM.  
While the mechanism of CNV formation in PM is still unclear, the stretching of the retina and thinning 
of the choroid is considered the key pathway leading to CNV, by way of increasing the probability of 
choroidal ischemia and subsequent atrophy of the adjacent RPE. These alterations are closely 
associated with the breaking of Bruch’s membrane (“lacquer cracks”), the main predisposing feature 
for new vessels formation and vessel growth into the subretinal space. During the natural course of 
CNV secondary to PM, patients progressively lose VA at a rate of approximately 10 to 15 letters (2 to 3 
lines) over 2 years. 
The association of an axial length greater than 26 mm with a high myopic refractive error increases the 
probability of developing CNV from 5% to nearly 10% of patients with associated myopic retinal 
changes, on average, over 10 years. The prevalence of CNV in patients with PM is high in patients 
under the age of 50 years; thus, due to the occurrence of this pathology at a young age, this condition 
has a profound impact on patients’ lives, also affecting the productivity of this working age group. 
Although considered the most common treatment for non-subfoveal CNV lesions, laser 
photocoagulation is associated with permanent loss of vision within the treated area, as well as 
formation of new anomalous vessels. Visudyne (verteporfin) photodynamic therapy (vPDT) is the only 
approved medication to treat subfoveal CNV in patients with PM.  
Treatment with vPDT has been shown to help avoid vision loss in CNV secondary to PM: in the VIP 
study, 86% of patients treated with vPDT lost less than 15 letters of best-corrected visual acuity 
(BCVA) at Month 12 compared with 67% of the placebo treated patients. At Month 24, the mean 
change in BCVA showed maintenance of vision, on average, at the baseline levels for patients treated 
with vPDT and a loss of 8 letters in placebo-treated patients. While vPDT provides this improvement in 
efficacy over natural vision loss, vision gain is uncommon. Therefore, maintenance of VA is the current 
accepted clinically relevant benefit with vPDT.

Rationale for proposed change 
Vascular leakage occurs in macular oedema (DME and RVO) as well as in choroidal neovascularisation 
(CNV) with exudation of intra- and subretinal fluids with subsequent atrophic changes [wet AMD and 
pathologic myopia (PM)] and can lead to visual impairment. For all these conditions, a role of VEGF has 
been proposed. In CNV secondary to PM, the choroidal thinning is believed to cause hypoxic changes in 
the outer retina including the stimulation of VEGF release. 
Similar to wet AMD, by inactivating VEGF, ranibizumab is thought to inhibit neovascular growth and 
associated exudation, with the subsequent suppression of the CNV growth in PM. Treatment with 
ranibizumab is intended to have a direct and immediate clinical effect of visual improvement. 
Clinical development programme  
To support the applied extension of indication for treatment of visual impairment due to CNV 
secondary to PM, the MAH submitted one pivotal, 12-month phase III study with 0.5 mg ranibizumab 
(RFB002F2301). In addition, results from study RFB002AGB10 (REPAIR), a local, open-label, 
exploratory, 12-month study in patients with visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM, were 
provided.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment has been submitted. This is justified with the protein nature of 
ranibizumab and Lucentis after application to the patient’s eye by injection is completely metabolised 
and adsorbed in the body. Any medicinal product that reaches water streams via eventual spills during 
application or after disposal of unused drug is expected to be very rapidly degraded and mineralised to 
CO2 by microbial activity. Reference is given to Directive 2001/83/EC and Guideline 
CHMP/SWP/4447/00. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The lack of additional non-clinical data is acceptable in view of the data submitted with the previous 
applications. Considering the above, ranibizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

a The number of treated patients is based on the actual treatment received. Note that 3 patients were randomized 
to receive treatment with vPDT but instead received treatment with ranibizumab and these patients are included in 
the appropriate ranibizumab treatment group.  
b Patients in the vPDT group of Study RFB002F2301 could receive treatment with ranibizumab starting at Month 3.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Following monthly intravitreal (IVT) administration of ranibizumab 0.5 mg/eye to patients with 
neovascular AMD, serum concentrations of ranibizumab were generally <5 ng/ml and thus below the 
ranibizumab concentration necessary to inhibit the biological activity of VEGF by 50% (IC50 = 11 to 27 
ng/ml). Serum ranibizumab concentrations in DME and RVO patients were similar to those observed in 
neovascular AMD patients. 
Tong et al (2006) compared aqueous humour concentrations of VEGF in patients with active macular 
polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), patients with CNV of AMD patients with CNV secondary to PM 
and control subjects. VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in the three disease states versus 
control. The rank order of mean VEGF concentrations from lowest to highest was control < PCV < PM < 
AMD. Likewise, Chan et al. (2008) observed higher baseline aqueous VEGF concentrations in patients 
with CNV of AMD compared to patients with myopic CNV before treatment. 
From these cross-indication comparisons, the MAH concluded that (i) aqueous humour VEGF 
concentrations in patients with CNV secondary to PM were not higher than those in patients with CNV 
in AMD and (2) serum ranibizumab concentrations were similarly low for patients treated with Lucentis 
for wet AMD, DME, and RVO. Therefore, vascular permeability and ranibizumab transfer from the 
vitreous to the serum in patients with visual impairment due to myopic CNV should not be greater than 
what has been previously measured in other diseases (wet AMD, DME, RVO).  
As a consequence, no additional pharmacokinetic studies were performed with in the clinical program 
to support the use of ranibizumab in the treatment of visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The mechanism of action of ranibizumab in the approved indications is to decrease permeability of 
leaking blood vessels via inactivation of VEGF. The same basic mechanism of action applies 
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 9/60 
 
 
independent on whether targeting choroidal vessels in wet AMD or in PM. The formulation used in 
study RFB002F2301 was identical to the commercially available formulation. No additional clinical 
pharmacology profiling studies have been conducted. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Ranibizumab is intended to be administered at the same dose and using the same route of 
administration already approved for the existing indications. The CHMP therefore concluded that no 
relevant differences in pharmacokinetics of ranibizumab are to be expected in the new population 
(patients with CNV due to PM) as compared to the group of patients previously studied (wet AMD, 
DME, and RVO).  
In light of the common mechanism of action as well as the low and similar systemic exposure across 
the approved indications, the lack of additional studies was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The MAH justified the selection of the 0.5 mg dose since this dose was shown to have the best 
benefit/risk balance in the wet AMD and RVO dose-finding studies and is approved for all indications 
(RVO, wet AMD, DME). In addition, the minimum treatment interval of 1 month between doses of 
ranibizumab was chosen based on the available PK data for ranibizumab and previous studies in 
patients with wet AMD which showed that both monthly dosing and a biweekly regimen have similar 
efficacy. Furthermore, the MAH referred to the positive outcome achieved with a low number of 
injections in the pivotal study (see chapter 2.4.2. ). Therefore, no specific dose finding studies were 
conducted for the proposed new indication, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
Title of study 
Study RFB002F2301: A 12-month, Phase III, randomized, double-masked, multicenter, active-
controlled study to evaluate efficacy and safety of two different dosing regimens of 0.5 mg 
ranibizumab vs verteporfin PDT in patients with visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularization 
secondary to pathologic myopia. 
Methods 
The trial was designed as a randomised, double-blind, multi-centre, active-controlled study with three 
study arms. 76 centres from 12 EU countries, Canada, Switzerland and Middle&East Asia were 
involved. 
Consenting patients participated in an up to 14 day screening period. The duration of the study was 12 
months.  
The study was divided into two consecutive phases (up to Month 6 and Month 6 – Month 12), after 
each of which a database lock (DBL) was planned to occur.

Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria: The study included adult patients aged 18 years or older with active CNV 
secondary to PM with greater than -6D of spherical equivalence and anterio-posterior elongation 
measurement greater than or equal to 26 mm and at least one subfoveal, juxtafoveal and or 
extrafoveal lesion or lesion at the margin of the optic disc in the study eye. In addition, patients were 
required to have a BCVA of ≥24 letters and ≤ 78 letters. 
If the patient had previously undergone refractive or cataract surgery, the pre-surgery refraction value 
was to be used (obtained either from medical chart or by calculation).  
The main exclusion criteria for this study were: previous surgery or treatment with corticosteroids 
within 3 months in study eye prior to the randomisation; laser photocoagulation with involvement of 
the macular area in the study eye, treatment in the study eye with vPDT or anti-VEGF agents, ocular 
disorders in the study eye that could confound interpretation of study results, compromised VA or 
required medical or surgical intervention during the 12-month study period, any type of advanced, 
severe or unstable disease or its treatment, that could interfere with primary and/or secondary 
outcome evaluations, a history of stroke, presence of confirmed systolic/diastolic blood pressure 
> 150/> 90 mmHg, history of malignancy of any organ system within the past 5 years and history of 
hypersensitivity to the study drugs (ranibizumab, verteporfin) or to drugs of similar chemical classes, 
and fluorescein or any other component of fluorescein formulation. 
Treatments 
After eligibility confirmation at baseline, patients were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of the 3 
treatment arms, i.e. to ranibizumab by stabilization (group I), ranibizumab by disease activity (group 
II), and vPDT (group III). In the vPDT treatment group, treatment with 0.5 mg ranibizumab as a 
treatment option was allowed from Month 3 in case of disease activity. 
Patients were monitored every 4 weeks (+/- 7 days) and were re-treated following the stabilisation or 
disease activity criteria depending on the treatment group:  
The stabilisation criterion was defined as: No change in BCVA as compared to two preceding monthly 
visits as judged by the evaluating physician. 
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 11/60 
 
 
 
The disease activity criterion was defined as: Vision impairment, attributable to intra or subretinal fluid 
or active leakage secondary to PM as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and/or 
fluorescence angiography (FA). 
Only one eye was selected and treated as the study eye. 
Treatment groups  
Group I (Ranibizumab I) 
• 
0.5 mg/0.05mL ranibizumab IVT driven by stabilization criteria 
Patients received 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal injections on Day 1 and Month 1. The first 
time point to assess stabilization criteria was Month 2 based on Baseline, Month 1 and Month 2 
assessments. Dosing was stopped if the stabilization criterion for VA was fulfilled. Treatment 
was resumed with monthly injections when there was a loss of VA due to disease activity and 
continued until stable VA was reached again for three consecutive monthly assessments. 
Group II (Ranibizumab II) 
• 
0.5 mg/0.5 mL ranibizumab (IVT) driven by disease activity 
Patients received intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab at Day 1. From Month 1, dosing 
was stopped if no disease activity was seen. Treatment was resumed when the disease activity 
criterion was fulfilled and continued until no disease activity was seen. 
Group III (vPDT) 
• 
vPDT [Visudyne®/verteporfin for intravenous infusion at 6 mg/m2 followed by a standard 
fluence rate of 600 mW/cm2 delivered for 83 seconds with light dose of 50 J/cm2 (as per 
label)] 
Patients received vPDT at Day 1. From Month 3 to 11, there were 3 options to treat the 
patient’s disease activity: 
o  0.5 mg ranibizumab or 
o  vPDT or 
o 
combination of 0.5 mg ranibizumab and vPDT 
Treatment was stopped if no disease activity was seen. Treatment was resumed when the 
disease activity criterion was fulfilled and continued until no disease activity was seen.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority (efficacy) of 0.5 mg ranibizumab driven by 
stabilisation criteria and/or by disease activity re-treatment criteria vs vPDT as assessed by best 
corrected visual acuity (BCVA). 
The key secondary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of 0.5 mg ranibizumab driven by 
disease activity criteria versus 0.5 mg ranibizumab driven by stabilisation criteria. 
Other secondary objectives included evaluation of different aspects of BCVA, anatomical markers, 
number of treatments as well as safety and tolerability while exploratory objectives included evaluation 
of ethnicity (Japanese vs. non-Japanese), outcomes in different locations of the CNV and quality of life.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference between the average level of BCVA (letters) over all 
monthly post-baseline assessments from Month 1 to Month 3 (endpoint) and the baseline level of 
BCVA. 
Subgroups analyses for age, sex, race, ethnicity (Japanese, non-Japanese), baseline BCVA, baseline 
axial length, baseline location of CNV and its subtypes were conducted. 
The key secondary efficacy variable was the difference between the average level of BCVA (letters) 
over all monthly post-baseline assessments from Month 1 to Month 6 and the baseline level of BCVA. 
The following secondary endpoints based on BCVA were: 
• 
• 
• 
the difference between the average level of BCVA over all monthly post-baseline 
assessments from Month 1 to Month 12 and the baseline level of BCVA. 
the proportion of patients who gain ≥ 1, ≥ 10, ≥ 15 letters compared with baseline, or reach 
84 letters by post-baseline visit up to Month 12. 
the proportion of patients who loose ≥ 10, ≥ 15 letters compared with baseline by post-
baseline visit up to Month 12. 
Secondary efficacy parameters based on anatomical markers were: 
• 
• 
the proportion of patients with presence of active leakage [based on optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) and/or fluorescence angiography (FA)] over 12 Months in the treatment 
groups 
change from baseline in CRT over time (OCT) 
Exploratory variables evaluated the BCVA outcome measures in different clinical types of macular 
(subfoveal, juxtafoveal and extrafoveal) and peripapilar CNV lesions related to PM. Health-related 
quality of life were evaluated with NEI-VFQ-25, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment 
Questionnaire (WPAI) and EuroQoL (EQ-5D) at Day 1, Month 3, Month 6 and Month 12. 
BCVA (tested at all visits) was tested at 4 meters starting distance using Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts. OCTs (tested at all visits except visit 3 day 8, all machines allowed 
– influence of differences e.g. between SD-OCT and 3D-OCT evaluated). FA (and colour fundus 
photography) was performed at baseline and end of study, thereafter as needed. Anatomical 
parameters were evaluated by a Central Reading Centre CRC. 
Sample size 
The study aimed at including 110 patients in each of the ranibizumab groups and 55 patients in the 
vPDT group. Assuming a treatment difference of 8 letters between each of the ranibizumab groups and 
vPDT and SD=10 letters, this resulted in a power of ≥91%.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio (ranibizumab stability criteria: ranibizumab disease activity: 
vPDT). Upon confirmation of eligibility, at Visit 2 (Day 1) eligible patients received the lowest available 
randomization number. This number assigned the patient to one of the treatment arms.

Masking 
For masking purpose there were both sham ranibizumab (empty vial) and sham vPDT applications (of 
dextrose 5% solution followed by light application PDT). At least two investigators were involved: 
• 
• 
the masked (assessing) investigator who performed all assessments, captured data in the 
electronic Case Report Forms and provided re-treatment assignments (stability y/n, disease 
activity y/n, treatment recommendation: ranibizumab or vPDT or ranibizumab+vPDT), and  
an unmasked (treating) investigator who administered the randomised study treatment when 
needed according to the protocol.  
Statistical methods 
This study was divided into 2 consecutive phases, after each of which a DBL lock occurred: Phase I 
from Day 1 (baseline) to Month 6 and Phase II from Month 6 to Month 12. 
Efficacy analyses including the analysis of the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint as 
well as safety analyses were based on the Month 6 DBL (all patients completed month 6 or 
discontinued). 
Unless otherwise specified, confidence intervals were 2-sided and at a 95% level and hypothesis tests 
were evaluated at a two-sided 0.05 / one-sided 0.025 level of significance. 
Primary efficacy (average BCVA over month 1-3), i.e. superiority of ranibizumab (either arm) over 
vPDT, was evaluated at Month 3 (full analysis set – FAS). Comparisons were performed using the 
stratified CMH test with the observed values as scores. Missing data followed a Last Observation 
Carried Forward (LOCF) approach where missing values occurring timely between observed values 
were replaced by the mean of the last observation observed before and the first observation after the 
missing time-point. Supportive analyses included ANCOVA and analyses of the per protocol set (PPS) 
at Month 3. Adjustment for multiplicity was performed according to the Hochberg procedure. 
Stratification was done based on categories of baseline BCVA: ≤60 letters vs. >60 letters. 
Key secondary efficacy (average BCVA over month 1-6), i.e. non-inferiority comparing the two 
ranibizumab arms, was evaluated with ANOVA (baseline BCVA as co-variates). The non-inferiority 
margin of 5 letters is based on health authority feedback related to the Visudyne project in 2008.  
Other secondary efficacy endpoints focused on the FAS and considered all three pair-wise comparisons 
up to Month 6 and up to the end of the study (Month 12). For continuous and ordered categorical 
variables, changes from baseline were compared between treatment arms using ANOVA/ANCOVA 
models (baseline assessment as covariate) and/or stratified/ un-stratified CMH/exact Fisher tests.  
Results 
Overall, 99.6% of all patients randomised completed 3 months, 98.9% of all patients completed 6 
months and 96.4% completed the 12-months study period.

* Two patients randomized to vPDT received each one ranibizumab injection prior to Month 3. 
Protocol deviations with impact on the analyses were reported in 19 (6.9%) of all randomised patients. 
Important deviations were: absence of CNV secondary to PM, and absence of appropriate lesion type. 
In a few cases, there were errors related to re-treatment: under-treatment (sham instead of active/no 
treatment) as well as over-treatment (active/no treatment instead of sham), absence of high myopia 
and/or elongation (>-6D/>26 mm).  
Baseline data 
The mean age of all patients was 55.5 years. Overall, 20% of the patients were younger than 45 years 
and 28.9% were 65 years of age or older. Most of the patients (75.5%) were female. The majority of 
patients (58.5%) were Caucasian, 41.2% were Asian including 18.1% Japanese.

Mean BVCA score was 55 letters, retinal thickness was 361 microns, the mean spherical equivalent 
refractive error was -12.5 and the mean axial length was 29 mm. The most common CNV subtype was 
located subfoveal (2/3 of patients) which is consistent with this being a population with impaired VA, 
while in 24%, the CNV location was juxtafoveal. 
Most common other ocular conditions were cataract surgery (14.1%), cataract (9%), eye laser surgery 
(3.2%), and keratomileusis (3.2%). Cataract was slightly more common in Group II (7.8%) and III 
(9%) than in Group I (5.7%). Overall, 62.8% of patients were reported with an active non-ocular 
medical condition, most frequently related to the SOCs of vascular disorders (28.2%), musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders (18.1%), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (15.5%). 
Exposure 
All randomised patients received at least 1 dose of study drug either of ranibizumab or vPDT.  
In the ranibizumab treatment groups, the mean number of ranibizumab injections prior to Month 3 was 
slightly higher in patients treated according to stabilisation criteria (2.5 ± 0.57) when compared to 
disease activity criteria (1.8 ± 0.82). This difference was maintained over 6 months (3.5 ± 1.46 vs. 
2.5 ± 1.56) and 12 months (4.6 ± 2.59 vs. 3.5 ± 2.92) study duration. In the vPDT group, from 
Month 3 to Month 6, the mean number of ranibizumab injections was 1.9 (±0.86) and after 12 Months 
3.2 (±2.54). 
All 55 patients in vPDT treatment group III received 1 vPDT treatment at baseline. Re-treatment (or 
non-treatment) with vPDT was performed as per-protocol except for few cases. Out of 55, two patients 
received ranibizumab prior to Month 3 (protocol deviation); other 38 patients received ranibizumab 
from Month 3. Fifteen patients never received ranibizumab and 2 of them had second vPDT treatment 
during the study.  
The two patients who received ranibizumab before Month 3 were reported in the ranibizumab group 
(Group II) for the safety analysis. 
In the evaluation of efficacy, patients are reported as per originally randomised (i.e. n=55). 
During the 12-months period of this study the combination of ranibizumab and vPDT was not 
administered to any patients. 
The mean number of ranibizumab injections was consistent in the majority of subgroups categories 
irrespective of baseline demographics and ocular characteristics with a tendency for a higher number 
of injections required in the categories with worse baseline BCVA. 
Outcome  
Primary and key secondary endpoint 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the superior efficacy of 0.5 mg ranibizumab driven by 
stabilisation criteria or by disease activity re-treatment criteria versus vPDT. The results are 
summarised in Table 3.

The outcomes of sensitivity analyses with observed data, with LOCF or with first observation carried 
back were identical to those in the primary analysis (missing data were imputed with the modified 
LOCF). The outcome was also essentially identical in the PPS with a change from baseline in group I, II 
and III of 10.4, 11.0 and 2.3 letters, respectively (PPS observed). 
The outcomes in subgroups [age (<45, 45-<55, 55-<65, ≥65 years), sex, race, axial length, baseline 
BCVA and, generally, the location of CNV subtype] were consistent with that of the overall study 
results. The characteristics of selected subgroups are detailed in the table below.

2 This p-value for non-inferiority is from a CMH test (stratified), is one-sided and based on the null hypothesis: 
Group II by disease activity is worse than Group I by stabilization by 5 letters or more, against the alternative 
hypothesis: Group II by disease activity is less than 5 letters worse than Group I by stabilization. 
As for the primary endpoint, sensitivity analyses were consistent with the outcome based on 
FAS/modified LOCF. 
Other secondary variables 
•  Change from baseline in visual acuity over time 
Rapid VA improvement was observed up to Month 1 in Groups I and II and reached nearly maximum 
effect by Month 2. Thereafter VA was maintained or slightly increased. Patients randomised to vPDT 
showed an increase in VA from Month 3 onwards, when patients had the option to receive ranibizumab 
(38 such subjects crossed over), see Figure 2.

•  Visual acuity by subgroups 
Consistency among subgroups (Group I and Group II) was observed at Month 3, 6 and 12. At month 
12, the mean gain in BCVA vs. baseline was > 10 letters in all subgroups in groups I and II except in 
the subgroup of subjects with a baseline BCVA of ≥ 73 letters (+6 letters in Groups I and II) and in the 
group with extrafoveal lesions (+5 letters in Group II). 
•  Summary of outcomes for anatomical markers 
In all three study groups, central retinal thickness had decreased at Month 12 by 60 microns or more 
compared to baseline. 
Most of the intraretinal cysts that were detected at baseline were located in the centre and their centre 
involvement decreased in all treatment groups up to Month 12 compared to Baseline. Few patients 
were recorded with new intraretinal cysts. 
While the large majority of patients presented with CNV leakage in the study eye at Baseline (Group I: 
96.2%, Group II: 93.1%, Group III: 100%) for most of the patients in all 3 treatment groups no CNV 
leakage was reported at Month 12 (Group I: 68.6%, Group II: 69.8%, Group III: 65.5%). 
The size of the area of lesion decreased in the ranibizumab from Baseline to Month 12 with mean 
changes (SD) from Baseline to Month 12 of -0.310 (± 1.6525) mm2 in Group I and -0.568 (±1.9442) 
mm2 in Group II, respectively. Patients in Group III were reported with a mean increase from Baseline 
to Month 12 of 0.279 (±2.9593) mm2. The size of the area of CNV decreased in all treatment groups 
Baseline to Month 12 with mean changes (SD) from Baseline to Month 12 of -0.248 (±1.8797) mm2 in 
Group I, -0.979 (±1.6537) mm2 in Group II, and -1.268 (±2.0413) mm2 in Group III, respectively.

Patient reported outcomes  
NEI-VFQ-25 
At Month 3, both ranibizumab-treatment arms were favoured over vPDT as regards, for example, 
general health, general vision, near activities and distance activities (p-values for these ranged from 
0.005 to >0.2). The effect was generally maintained or improved at Month 6 and 12, especially for 
subscales related to vision. For most subscales, Group I (stabilisation) was numerically better than 
Group II (disease activity).  
EQ-5D 
Few patients completed the EQ-5D questionnaire. At Month 3, slightly more patients in Group I and II 
[71.2% (p=0.08) and 64.5% (p=0.05), respectively] improved on the anxiety/depression scale from 
‘moderately anxious’ to ‘not anxious’ compared with Group III (51%). In the categories mobility, self-

care, usual activities, and pain/discomfort there were no differences for any group with the majority of 
patients reported ‘no problems’ in any category for each time point.  
WPAI-GH 
There was a reduction in percentage of overall work impairment for all 3 treatment groups with the 
greatest reductions in groups I and II. Mean change from Baseline (SD) of total score at Month 3 were 
-21.9 (±75.21) in Group I and -22.0 (±55.00) in Group II, compared with -10.2 (±59.89) in Group III.  
Ancillary analyses 
Posology 
During the assessment of the application, the MAH was asked to provide the results of additional 
analysis with a view to the recommended posology and requirement for monitoring and re-treatment 
conditions. 
In response to the CHMP request, the MAH presented the outcome of an evaluation of the pattern of 
treatment administration and interruptions by baseline characteristics, the possible predictive value of 
the length of the treatment-free interval with regards to the need for re-treatment in the future as well 
as the impact on the VA. 
During the first 6 months of the study, the duration of the first treatment-free interval for the majority 
of patients was ≥2 months. In Group II (disease activity), the duration of the first treatment-free 
interval was ≥2 months for 82.9% of patients with a treatment interruption. 
At Month 12, the average duration of treatment-free intervals increased further and was ≥8 months for 
almost half of the patients and approximately a third of the patient were not re-treated for 11 months 
after receiving the single baseline injection. However, there was no consistent pattern in the 
distribution over time of the treatment-free periods (i.e., relatively consistent percentages of patients 
in each treatment-free duration category from 1 month to 11 months). When treatment was restarted 
after an interruption, as above, patients rapidly gained back the previous (generally limited) loss of VA. 
Based on the 12-month results, the individual variability of patients needing treatment due to active 
disease suggest that neither a quarterly fixed monitoring or interruption after one year, as initially 
proposed, was an optimal recommendation for monitoring the disease in all patients. Instead, an 
individual monitoring frequency and duration assessed by the treating physician’s clinical judgment, 
was considered more appropriate to address the individual patient‘s need for treatment. 
Further analysis of baseline characteristics indicated that the longest first treatment-free interval was 
observed in subjects with lower central retinal thickness or central foveal thickness and with less 
presence of subretinal fluid while no differences were observed for other ocular baseline 
characteristics. While the length of first treatment-free interval was useful to indicate potential 
predictors and trends, it did not provide information about the strength of prediction. In a multivariate 
Poisson regression, disease activity at Month 1 and 2 were identified as the best predictors of future 
need for treatment of the need for treatment. 
Prior treatment with vPDT 
Following a request from the CHMP during the assessment, the MAH also submitted VA data separating 
the non-ranibizumab-treated from the ranibizumab-treated vPDT groups (see Table 7).

Design 
Phase III, randomised, double-masked, multi-centre, active-controlled, 
3-arm study with optional cross-over after 6 months. 
Two different dosing regimens of 0.5 mg ranibizumab (group I and II) were 
compared with verteporfin PDT (Group III). Patients were randomized in a 
2:2:1 ratio, were monitored every 4 weeks and re-treated following the 
stabilisation (Group I) or disease activity criteria (Group II). Patients in group 
III received vPDT at Day 1. In Group III, from Month 3 to 11, the treating 
investigator had options to treat the patient’s disease activity with 
ranibizumab, vPDT or the combination.

The study was conducted in 12 centres in the United Kingdom. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to evaluate the mean change in BCVA from Baseline to Month 12.  
The key secondary objectives were to evaluate:  
•  Mean change in BCVA from Baseline to Month 6 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Mean change in retinal thickness from Baseline to Months 6 and 12 
Time to the first re-treatment and the total number of treatments 
Change in lesion size and morphology from screening to Months 6 and 12 
Safety of intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 
An exploratory objective was to evaluate the effects of ranibizumab on patient-reported outcomes from 
baseline to Month 12, assessed by the Macular Disease Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (MacTSQ) 
and the Well-Being Questionnaire (W-BQ12). 
Methodology 
The study used a prospective, observational, open-label, single-arm, multicentre design. At baseline, 
all eligible patients received one initial intravitreal injection of ranibizumab 0.5 mg followed by 
repeated monthly administration as needed for up to a further 11 months based on the presence of 
sub-/intra-retinal fluid on OCT or decrease in VA/increased blurring or metamorphopsia together with 
evidence of leakage on FA. Visits to assess efficacy and safety were scheduled at one-monthly 
intervals.  
Number of patients: Recruitment of 64 patients was planned. The sample size was based on outcomes 
reported in the study by Mones et al (2009). Overall, 65 patients were enrolled. 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion 
The study included adult patients aged 18 years or older with active primary or recurrent subfoveal or 
juxtafoveal CNV secondary to PM treated on an outpatient basis. Included patients had a diagnosis of 
high myopia of at least -6 dioptres in the study eye spherical equivalent and a BCVA (ETDRS chart) 
between 78 and 24 letters. For subjects who had undergone prior refractive or cataract surgery in the 
study eye, the preoperative refractive error in the study eye must have been at least -6 dioptres.  
The main exclusion criteria for this study were: previous surgery in study eye (within 2 months); laser 
photocoagulation, intravitreal steroids, vPDT, anti-VEGF agents, external-beam radiation therapy, 
vitrectomy, or transpupillary thermotherapy in study eye and previous systemic bevacizumab  
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the difference from baseline to Month 12 in the level of BCVA 
(number of letters).  
Secondary efficacy variables included the mean change in BCVA from baseline to Month 6, change in 
lesion size and morphology from screening to Months 6 and 12 and mean change in retinal thickness 
from baseline to Months 6 and 12. The W-BQ12 questionnaire was administered at baseline then 
Months 1, 6 and 12. MacTSQ was administered at Months 1, 6 and 12 (exploratory variables). 
Safety variables were AEs, ophthalmic examinations and intraocular pressure and vital signs. 
Statistical methods 
The primary variable was tested to determine if the mean improvement was ≥10 letter BCVA by a 
paired t-test using the LOCF method. The primary analysis was based on the FAS (all patients who 
received at least one treatment and had at least one post-baseline assessment for BCVA). For 
sensitivity purposes, the primary analysis was repeated using the PPS (all patients in the FAS 
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 24/60 
 
 
completing the treatment phase of the trial without clinically significant protocol deviations). Secondary 
and exploratory efficacy variables were analysed in the FAS and presented descriptively.  
Safety variables are presented descriptively based on the safety set (all patients who received at least 
one injection and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment). 
A pre-planned interim analysis was undertaken when 75% of the patients had completed the Month 6 
study visit. 
Results 
Three subjects did not complete the study with one each due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, 
protocol violation and lost to follow-up. 
All enrolled patients met the criteria for inclusion in the Safety set and the FAS. Five patients were 
excluded from the PPS due to protocol deviations including not meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Demographic and background characteristics: Mean (SD) age was 55.5 (14.97) years. The majority of 
patients were female (70.8%) and Caucasian (90.8%). The mean (SD) duration of CNV prior to study 
entry was 1.8 (3.26) months, and mean (SD; range) BCVA score in the study eye at baseline was 59.5 
(13.6; 26-85) letters. More than half the patients had subfoveal CNV (66.2%), 26% had juxtafoveal 
and 8% had probably subfoveal/ juxtafoveal CNV. 
Exposure: All patients received the first injection. The mean (SD) number of treatments during the 12-
month study was 3.6 (2.57). At least one retreatment after the baseline injection was required in 51 
patients (78.5%), The median time to first retreatment following the baseline treatment was 2 months 
(95% CI 1.25, 3.42) (Kaplan-Meier estimates). By Month 12, the cumulative number of treatments 
was most frequently one (21.5%), two (18.5%) or three (16.9%), with 28 patients (43.1%) receiving 
four or more treatments in total. Two patients received an injection at each of the 11 successive post-
baseline monthly study visits i.e. 12 injections in total.  
Efficacy results:  
For the primary variable (difference in BCVA from baseline to month 12), the estimated mean (SD) 
treatment difference was 13.6 (13.9) letters.  
The mean difference exceeded 10 letters by Month 2, and remained in the range of 10 to 14 thereafter 
throughout the 12-month study. The mean (SD) change in BCVA to Month 6 was 11.1 (15.4) letters. 
During the period from baseline to Month 12, 24 patients (36.9%) achieved a BCVA gain of 15 or more 
letters in the study eye, and more than half the patients (50.8%, n=33) achieved a gain of 10 or more 
letters. In the fellow eye, 7.7% and 10.8% of patients, respectively, reported a gain of ≥15 letters or ≥
10 letters during the 12 month study period. 
There was a significant reduction in CRT from baseline to Month 6, with a mean (SD) change of 128.76 
(127.840) μm (p<0.001). This improvement was maintained at Month 12, when the mean (SD) 
change from baseline was -135.16 (134.117) μm (p<0.001). For patients with evaluable 
measurements at Baseline and Month 12, the mean (SD) change in lesion size to Month 12 was -0.37 
(1.161) (p=0.287). At baseline, intraretinal cysts were absent in 32.3% of patients (21/65), definite in 
52.3% (34/65) and questionable in 15.4% (10/65), compared to 80.0% (52/65), 7.7% (5/65) and 
4.6% (3/65), respectively, at Month 6 (p<0.001) and 83.1% (54/65), 13.8% (9/65) and 1.5% at 
Month 12 (1/65) (p<0.001). Subretinal fluid was absent, definite or questionable on OCT in 26.2% 
(17/65), 67.7% (44/65) and 6.2% (4/65) of patients at baseline, compared to 81.5% (53/65), 12.3% 
(8/65) and 1.5% (1/65), respectively, at Month 6 (p<0.001) and 89.2% (58/65), 7.7% (5/65) and 
1.5% (1/65), respectively, at Month 12 (p<0.001).

The overall General Well-Being score of the W-BQ12 and the MacTSQ questionnaires showed a 
significant improvement from baseline to Month 12 (p=0.0304 and p=0.0001).  
2.4.4.  Literature 
A recent publication presents the results of a small, 3-year retrospective study investigating the long-
term safety and efficacy of ranibizumab in patients (40 eyes of 39 patients) with myopic CNV 
(Franqueira et al, 2012, Ophthalmologica 227:39–44). Follow-up was at least 30 months for all eyes, 
and 26 eyes reached the 3 years of follow-up. 
The need for re-treatment was determined by a decrease in BCVA and/or signs of disease activity. A 
mean number of 7.6 (range, 2–19) treatments were performed during the follow-up time. A mean of 
4.1 injections were performed in the first year, 2.4 in the second year and 1.1 in the third year. 
Mean BCVA was 55.4 ETDRS letters at baseline, 59.7 letters at 12 months (p = 0.07), 61.8 letters at 
24 months (p = 0.008) and 63.4 letters at 36 months (p = 0.039). At 6 months, almost 50% of the 
eyes gained ≥ 5 letters, an effect that was maintained over time. Previous treatment with vPDT (15 
eyes) had no impact on the outcome of ranibizumab treatment. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The CHMP reviewed the data provided from the pivotal trial (study RFB002F2301014) as supported by 
data from a non-controlled, open-label study (REPAIR).  
Pivotal trial 
•  Study design and baseline data 
In general, the CHMP considered the inclusion and exclusion criteria to be relevant with regards for the 
recruitment of a population representative for the target population. However, the design of the study 
resulted in a limited proportion of treatment-experienced (laser, vPDT) subjects. 
The CHMP furthermore agreed that vPDT (Visudyne photodynamic therapy), the only approved 
treatment for visual impairment due to myopic CNV, was a reasonable comparator.  
However, the CHMP considered that due to the study design only the results from the first 3 months 
provided a true comparison between treatments. Given the different mechanism of action of both 
treatments and that the natural course of the condition may be variable, a double-blind, active 
controlled study period would have been desirable. The MAH justified this by referring to the 
substantial experience from previous development programmes where all data indicated that the effect 
of ranibizumab treatment appeared early. The CHMP recognised that considering the current off-label 
treatment with VEGF-inhibitors in PM together with available publications indicating a promising 
outcome of such treatment, it would be difficult recruit patients to a study with a longer period 
restricted to vPDT.  
The CHMP furthermore considered the selected endpoints to be relevant for the evaluation of efficacy 
in the proposed indication.  Likewise, the CHMP considered the sample size, randomisation, masking 
and statistical analysis as well as the general conduct of the study acceptable. However, the CHMP 
noted that the LOCF approach might not be sufficient conservative in view of the rapid progression of 
the disease, but since all patients concerned completed 6 months of the study and additional 
sensitivity analyses were performed, the CHMP concluded that this was of limited concern. 
Baseline demographics as well as ocular characteristics were considered to be well balanced and to 
reasonably represent the spectrum of the target population. PM affects approximately twice as many 
women than men and this is reflected in the included population. As expected, this population was 
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 26/60 
 
 
younger (from 18 years of age) and had fewer concomitant (ocular and non ocular) conditions when 
compared to the study populations in the earlier development programmes of ranibizumab.  
•  Study outcome 
Three months after treatment initiation, statistically significant differences of both ranibizumab 
treatment groups compared to vPDT were shown. The CHMP considered the difference in mean BCVA 
of more than 8-9 letters to be clinically relevant. The CHMP also noted that for both ranibizumab 
treatment groups, an effect was apparent within the first month of treatment and increased during the 
study period, while patients in the vPDT group experienced a minimal and not clinically significant 
improvement of VA of 2.2 letters. This was considered in line with the expected effect of verteporfin. 
Overall, ranibizumab was clearly in favour over vPDT in essentially all subgroups although a lower 
benefit in elderly patients and those with higher baseline VA was suggested. The benefit of 
ranibizumab was also less clear in case of extrafoveal lesions, however very few subjects were 
concerned including only one vPDT-treated subject with such lesion. Based on these limited data, no 
firm conclusions on the effect of ranibizumab in case of an extrafoveal location of the lesion could be 
drawn. Therefore, the CHMP considered that SmPC section 4.4 should be updated to inform about this 
limitation of the available data.  
Furthermore, the presence and size of peripapillary atrophy have previously been reported in the 
scientific literature to be inversely related to the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy in myopic CNV. 
However, the MAH had not collected information on the presence and size of peripapillary atrophy. The 
CHMP therefore recommended that the MAH provided a post-hoc analysis from the existing colour 
fundus photography and FA images to evaluate the risk for a reduced effect of ranibizumab in patients 
with CNV due to PM presenting with peripapillary atrophy.  
As for the responder analyses, no difference between the two ranibizumab groups was apparent (in 
both groups, more than 70% of the patients experienced a gain in BCVA of ≥10 letters or reached ≥84 
letters overall by the end of the study). However, the proportion of responders was clearly higher for 
patients treated with ranibizumab as compared to the vPDT treatment group. The differences between 
treatments observed in the responder analysis was therefore considered by the CHMP to be consistent 
with those observed in the primary analysis.  
At Month 6 and 12, the CHMP noted that the gain in VA further increased compared to Month 3 
although to a minor extent with an overall mean change from baseline in the two ranibizumab 
treatment groups of about 14 letters at the end of the study. No significant difference in BCVA 
endpoints between the two ranibizumab treatment groups and therefore the re-treatment criteria was 
observed. The results were stable or increased slightly from Months 6 onwards up until Month 12.  
Anatomic markers and patient reported outcomes generally mirrored the results observed for VA, were 
consistent with ranibizumab’s mechanism of action and in line with previous study results for the 
approved indications. The CHMP considered these data as supportive.  
• 
Long-term efficacy 
Overall, the CHMP considered the efficacy data sufficient to support the proposed new indication. 
However, concerns were raised regarding the lack of data for long-term efficacy and regarding the 
possible risk of late reactivation of CNV after years of treatment. To address this concern the CHMP 
recommended that the MAH collected long-term efficacy data in observational studies post approval. 
The MAH confirmed that the scope of the ongoing LUMINOUS study would be extended to also include 
subjects with PM. It was approximated that 100 patients will be followed for a minimum of 2 years. In 
addition, the MAH agreed to conduct a 3-year observational study in 300 patients with CNV secondary 
PM with focus on long-term efficacy, including evaluating the risk of reactivation of CNV in the long 
Lucentis

term, and with evaluation of safety as a secondary objective. The study would also include subjects 
previously treated with vPDT (or other laser treatment, see discussion below) and subjects with 
extrafoveal lesions. Finally, the RMP was updated to include long term effects on the progression of PM 
as missing information.  
• 
Prior and concomitant treatment with vPDT 
When comparing patients in the vPDT group, who crossed over to ranibizumab with those, who did not, 
subjects receiving ranibizumab tended to do better in terms of visual acuity at the end of study. 
However, the CHMP noted the potential of bias due to the fact that patients crossing over to 
ranibizumab were those, who did not respond to vPDT. 
Published data have however suggested greater benefit in treatment-naïve patients compared to those 
who had previously vPDT (Chan et al. Br J Ophthalmol 2009, Ruiz-Moreno et al. Br J Ophthalmol 
2009). Since only 40 subjects that crossed over to ranibizumab were not treatment-naïve (received 
vPDT on day 1), data in this group of patients was considered by the CHMP to be limited. Based on the 
observed mean increase in VA of 10 and 11.4 letters between Month 3 and 6 and Month 3 and 12, 
respectively, the CHMP concluded that an additional effect of ranibizumab has been demonstrated also 
in the previously vPDT-treated subjects.  
Nevertheless, although the study included a cohort of patients randomised to vPDT and subsequently 
allowed to switch to Lucentis, no patients who had undergone longer-term unsuccessful vPDT therapy 
before entering the study have been investigated. Such patients may have choriocapillaris atrophy, 
and could be expected to have a poorer visual outcome with anti-VEGF therapy than treatment-naïve 
patients. Therefore, the CHMP recommended that SmPC section 4.4 should be updated to inform about 
the limitedness of data in PM patients previously treated with vPDT.  
Furthermore, as no subjects received the combination of vPDT and ranibizumab, the CHMP requested 
that SmPC section 4.2 should be updated to reflect this lack of experience.  
In addition, the CHMP recommended to collect additional data post-approval (see discussion on long-
term efficacy above). Furthermore, the RMP was updated to include use of Visudyne (verteporfin) or 
laser photocoagulation given in combination with ranibizumab in PM patients as important missing 
information. 
• 
Posology 
Overall, the CHMP considered the dosage recommendation proposed by the MAH based on disease 
activity as reasonable, as a clinically relevant effect has been sufficiently demonstrated in the 
respective study group. Furthermore, 6 and 12 Month data demonstrated that re-treatment based on 
disease activity resulted in fewer injections, which is preferable due to the fact that a lower risk for 
adverse event due to the application could be expected. Treatment based on disease activity criteria 
has also been supported by several published studies. 
However, questions were raised in relation to the monitoring of disease activity and the understanding 
of disease activity criteria. Additional analyses performed with the 12 months data in response to these 
questions revealed a large heterogeneity in terms of treatment-free intervals amongst the patients. 
Therefore, the MAH proposed revised posology recommendations, providing for monitoring on a 
monthly basis during the first 2 months of treatment followed by quarterly monitoring until the end of 
the first year of treatment, after which the monitoring frequency should be determined by the treating 
physician. Additional amendments to the wording were proposed to enhance understanding of the re-
treatment criteria by disease activity and possible means to monitor disease activity as well as to 
clarify that the dosing interval should not be shorter than 1 month.

The CHMP considered that the revised wording proposed for SmPC section 4.2 was reasonable and 
consistent with the available data, reflecting the large heterogeneity in the need for re-treatment as 
well as the risk of insufficient monitoring/treatment. Considering that half of the patients were stable 
for at least 8 months, the CHMP agreed that a less frequent monitoring than in the other, approved 
indications for ranibizumab, was acceptable. In addition, the CHMP was reassured by the fact that in 
case of loss of VA after treatment interruption, the loss of VA was not rapid and was quickly regained 
when treatment was re-initiated.  
The CHMP furthermore noted that any attempts by the MAH to identify predictors aiding in further 
recommendations regarding the frequency of monitoring were unsuccessful. While the longest average 
first treatment-free interval was observed in subjects with lower CRT or CFT, as well as a lower 
proportion of presence of subretinal fluid, there were no differences with regards to other ocular 
parameters (e.g. baseline BCVA, IOP, axial length, refraction sphere, CNV location).  
Supportive study 
With regards to the open-label, non-controlled REPAIR study in 65 patients, the CHMP considered the 
data generally in line with results seen in the pivotal trial. Both VA-based and anatomic outcomes 
supported the results observed in the pivotal study. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In summary, the CHMP considered that the data presented by the MAH in support of the proposed 
extension of indication showed that, while patients on vPDT followed a VA stabilisation pattern, 
patients receiving ranibizumab experienced an improvement in vision. These results are in line with 
what has been previously described. The gain in VA with ranibizumab treatment was rapidly achieved 
(near maximum effect by month 2 of treatment) and was maintained throughout 12 months. Overall, 
the effect size was considered by the CHMP clinically significant and highly relevant although long term 
data was lacking.  
Concerns were raised as regards the limitedness of data in patients previously treated with vPDT and 
in patients with extrafoveal lesions as well as in relation to the lack of experience of concomitant use of 
vPDT and ranibizumab treatment as well as regards efficacy in patients with extrafoveal lesions.  
In light of these concerns, the CHMP considered that amendments to the posology recommendations 
as well as the warnings in the SmPC were necessary compared to the original proposal of the MAH to 
inform about the limitations of the efficacy data.  
In view of the convincing efficacy of Lucentis in the proposed new indication of vision impairment due 
to CNV secondary to PM, additional efficacy data were not considered necessary by the CHMP prior to 
approval of the new indication. However, the CHMP recommended that additional efficacy data should 
be collected post approval in observational studies, in particular with a view to long-term efficacy and 
the efficacy concerns raised above. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Safety profile in the approved indications 
The MAH reported that the available safety database for ranibizumab in the already approved 
indications included over 38,000 subjects (up to PSUR 8, 2011) in clinical trials from the previous 
development programmes as well as post marketing data.  
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 29/60 
 
 
The majority of adverse reactions reported following administration of Lucentis are related to the 
intravitreal injection procedure. The most frequently reported ocular adverse reactions are eye pain, 
ocular hyperaemia, increased intraocular pressure, vitritis, vitreous detachment, retinal haemorrhage, 
visual disturbance, vitreous floaters, conjunctival haemorrhage, eye irritation, foreign body sensation 
in eyes, increased lacrimation, blepharitis, dry eye and eye pruritus. 
The most frequently reported non-ocular adverse reactions are headache, nasopharyngitis and 
arthralgia.  
Less frequently reported, but more serious, adverse reactions include endophthalmitis, blindness, 
retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic cataract. 
The overall frequency of non-ocular haemorrhages, potentially related to systemic VEGF inhibition, was 
slightly increased in ranibizumab-treated subjects in the wet AMD phase III studies. There is also a 
theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and myocardial infarction, following 
intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. A low incidence rate of arterial thromboembolic events was 
observed in the Lucentis clinical trials in patients with AMD, DME and RVO and there were no major 
differences between the groups treated with ranibizumab compared to control. 
Safety data for myopic CNV indication 
The MAH submitted safety data from the pivotal and supportive trial of the new indication of VA 
impairment due to myopic CNV and the assessment is provided in the following chapters. 
2.5.2.  Patient exposure 
In the pivotal study, 224 subjects in Group I and II have been treated with ranibizumab for up to 
12 months and 38 subjects that were treated with vPDT (Group III) received ranibizumab between 
Month 3 and Month 12. In addition, 65 subjects in the supportive REPAIR study were treated with 
ranibizumab for up to 12 months. Thus, a total of 327 subjects have received ranibizumab during the 
12 months of the studies and 289 patients received ranibizumab from study start. 
In the pivotal study, subjects in Group I and II received 2.5 and 1.8 injections, respectively, between 
baseline and Month 3. Between baseline and Month 6, the mean number of injections in Group I and II 
was 3.5 and 2.5, respectively and 1.8 injections in Group III. Between baseline and Month 12, the 
mean number of injections in Group I and II was 4.6 and 3.5, respectively and 3.2 injections in Group 
III. In REPAIR, the mean number of injections was 3.6 in 12 months. 
All subjects in Group III received 1 treatment of vPDT at baseline and 2 subjects that did not cross-
over to receive ranibizumab received 1 additional vPDT treatment each after Month 3. 
2.5.3.  Adverse events (AE) 
2.5.3.1.  Study RFB002F2301 
•  Ocular Adverse Events 
Up to Month 3, the frequency of ocular AEs in the study eye was 27.4% in Group I, 13.6% in Group II, 
and 9.4% in Group III. Most AEs were suspected to be related to the injection rather than the study 
drug and the trend in reporting frequencies, i.e. highest frequency reported in Group I, followed by 
Group II with the lowest reporting in Group III, mirrored the number of injections given in the 
respective groups (mean 2.5 injections in Group I vs. mean 1.8 injections in Group II vs. no treatment 
with ranibizumab up to month 3 in Group III). Only vitreous floaters, retinal tear and conjunctivitis 
allergic were AEs not considered related to the injection.

Overall, up to Month 6, ocular AEs considered by the investigator as suspected to be related to study 
drug and/or ocular injection were reported for a total of 46 (16.6%) patients [19.8%, 16.1%, 11.8%, 
and 10.5% of the patients in ranibizumab Group I and II, Group III (with ranibizumab) and Group III 
(without ranibizumab), respectively].   
The frequencies of ocular AEs in the study eye up to Month 12 was 43.4% in Group I, 37.3% in Group 
II, and 42.1% and 26.7% in Group III with ranibizumab and without ranibizumab, respectively (see 
table below).

Visual impairment  
Up to  month 12, the highest proportion of subjects reporting increased intraocular pressure (IOP) was 
observed in the previously vPDT-treated subjects that received ranibizumab. A suspected relationship 
to ocular injection was reported up to Month 12 in 24.5% (Group I) and 20.3% of patients in the 
ranibizumab groups and in 18.4% and 13.3% patients in the vPDT with and without ranibizumab 
groups, respectively.  
The majority of AEs were of mild severity. A total of 18 patients experienced ocular AEs of moderate 
severity up to Month 12 (Group I: punctate keratitis, photopsia, uveitis, visual acuity reduced, vitreous 
detachment; Group II: vitreous floaters, blepharitis, cataract, retinal haemorrhage, eye haemorrhage, 
metamorphopsia, ocular hypertension, retinoschisis, IOP increased; Group III with ranibizumab: 
macular oedema, ocular hypertension; Group III without ranibizumab: orbital myositis). All except 
three of the moderate ocular AEs occurred in patients treated with ranibizumab. Dacryocystitis (n=1, 
group I) and conjunctivitis allergic (n=1, group II) were classified as severe AEs. 
•  Non-Ocular Adverse Events 
At least one non-ocular AE during the first 3 months of treatment was recorded in 25.5% of patients of 
Group I, in 25.4% of Group II, and in 11.3% of the vPDT group. The most frequent non-ocular AEs in 
the ranibizumab groups were nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain, 
and hypertension.  
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 31/60 
 
 
 
 
Up to Month 12, five out of 8 cases of upper respiratory tract infection were reported from the same 
site. 
Non-ocular AEs reported by the investigator as suspected to be related to study drug and/or ocular 
injection were reported for a total of 3 (2.5%) patients in Group II up to Month 12 (1 patient each with 
headache, hepatic function abnormal and nausea). The report of hepatic function abnormal is further 
addressed under laboratory findings below.  
Up to Month 12, 9 patients were reported with severe non-ocular AEs (Group I: 3 patients with 
myocarditis, gastritis erosive, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, melaena, depression, Group II: 6 patients 
with atrial tachycardia, bronchitis, subdural hematoma, muscle spasms, spinal column stenosis, lung 
adenocarcinoma, hypertension). 
•  Serious adverse event (SAE) and deaths 
No patient died during the 12-month study period. 
A single patient in Group I experienced an ocular SAE of the study eye of corneal erosion during the 
first 3 months. A second patient (Group II) was reported with an ocular SAE of the study eye of 
retinoschisis in the study eye as a SAE on Day 309. The event was not suspected to be related to study 
drug/ocular injection and no action was taken. 
In addition, 11 serious non-ocular AEs were reported up to Month 12. None of the serious events was 
suspected by the investigator to be related to study drug or injection.  
• 
Targeted Adverse Events  
Endophthalmitis: No cases were reported. 
Intraocular pressure (IOP) increased: During the 12-months study there were 15 patients for whom 
IOP increase was reported as an AE in the study eye: 4 patients in Group I, 7 patients in Group II and 
4 patients in Group III. For 8 of these patients, a relation to the injection was suspected. All was of 
mild severity except one that was regarded as moderate. In summary, the reported cases of IOP 
increase were transiently experienced post-injection and did not require chronic IOP lowering 
treatment. Newly diagnosed glaucoma was not reported. 
Retinal tear/Retinal detachment: Patients with PM have theoretically a higher risk of retinal tears and 
retinal detachments. Three patients (2 in Group I, 1.9% and 1 in Group II, 0.8%) were reported with 
retinal hole, retinal break and retinal tears with operculum. All three events were coded as retinal tear 
and all of these AEs were of mild severity. There were no cases of “retinal detachment” reported. 
• 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, there were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in haematology values and urine 
analysis values. Largely, there were also no clinically relevant changes from baseline in clinical 
chemistry values. AEs due to hepatic function abnormal were however reported for 2 patients. 
• 
Immunological events 
Given the low incidence and lack of a relationship to clinical outcome in previous studies, 
immunogenicity to ranibizumab was not assessed in the current clinical program. 
•  Safety in special populations 
The RMP-identified AEs that could represent potential safety concerns were analysed in demographic 
subgroups (ethnicity, age, sex). While the number of patients was too low to allow an analysis in all 
subgroups, there was no notable differences in the incidence of any of the defined RMP safety concerns 
between age groups (i) <50, ≥50 years and (ii) 65 and ≥65 years of age or gender.

•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug interaction studies were performed. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No patient discontinued the study drug treatment prematurely due to an AE or SAE during the 
12-months study period. However, 6 patients temporarily interrupted treatment with ranibizumab due 
to an AE or abnormal laboratory test. 
2.5.3.2.  Supportive Study CRFB002AGB10 (REPAIR) 
The overall incidence of AEs was 70.8% (n=46). Ocular AEs, regardless of study drug relationship, 
were reported by 29 patients (44.6%).  
Among the 29 patients with one or more ocular AE, the severity of AEs was mild in 22 patients 
(33.8%), moderate in five patients (7.7%) and severe in two patients (3.1%). Ocular AEs with a 
suspected relation to study drug were reported in four patients (6.2%), comprising conjunctival 
haemorrhage (n=1), vitreous floaters (n=2) and endophthalmitis (n=1).  
No deaths occurred during the study. Three patients experienced one serious AE (SAE) each. One of 
these was reported as endophthalmitis. The other two SAEs were non-ocular (depression and 
dislocated shoulder) and were not suspected to be related to study drug.  
Mean IOP in the study eye remained stable throughout the study, with no consistent change from 
baseline at successive study visits when measured either pre-injection or post-injection maximum.  
No subjects discontinued treatment due to an AE or SAE. However, in one case, an AE (reduced VA, 
mild of severity and not suspected related to treatment) led to dose adjustment/interruption. 
Post marketing experience 
Lucentis is indicated for the treatment of wet AMD, the treatment of visual impairment due to DME or 
due to macular oedema secondary to RVO (branch RVO or central RVO). The product was first 
registered in the US on 30-Jun-2006 for wet AMD by Genentech. Novartis is currently Marketing 
Authorization Holder for wet AMD, DME and RVO in more than 100 countries worldwide.  
For a summary of the known safety profile and overall exposure in clinical trials please see chapter 
2.5.1. .  
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The CHMP noted that the size of the safety database from the pivotal trial was limited although 
supported with an additional 65 subjects from the REPAIR study. The limited size of the safety set only 
allowed detection of common AEs with sufficient precision. However, the CHMP agreed that the pattern 
of use in the proposed new indication could be considered similar to the already approved indications 
wet-AMD and DME, as all of them are chronic and progressive conditions. Thus, the safety database 
from these already authorised indications was considered as supportive for this application.  
At the same time, compared to the already authorised indications, the target population of CNV 
secondary to PM relates to patients without general systemic risk factors and less ocular co-
morbidities. Therefore, the CHMP recommended to collect additional safety data. In view of the 
substantial experience with Lucentis in wet AMD, DME and RVO indications, the CHMP considered it 
acceptable to provide these data post-authorisation. To this end, the MAH had planned to extend the 
ongoing Luminous study to include subjects with CNV secondary to PM (see also discussions in relation 
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 33/60 
 
 
to long-term efficacy in chapter 2.4.5. ). Furthermore, the MAH agreed to perform an additional 3-
year, observational post-approval study in 300 subjects in which safety will be investigated as a 
secondary objective. 
Furthermore, the CHMP noted that data on long-term safety were missing. Notably, long-term safety 
was already included in the RMP as important missing information. 
With regards to ocular adverse events, the CHMP considered that most of the reported events 
observed after ranibizumab administration could be expected considering the ocular injection 
procedure.  
When comparing AEs reported early in the study to those reported later on, a generally similar pattern 
was observed except for some AEs not detected during the first 6 months: vitreous floaters, retinal 
tear (Group I) and conjunctivitis allergic, 3 events of metamorphopsia (Group II) and 2 cases of visual 
impairment (Group III with ranibizumab). In an additional analysis conducted by the MAH upon 
request of the CHMP, metamorphopsia and visual impairment events appeared to be associated with 
the underlying condition of PM rather than study drug treatment. The CHMP agreed with the MAH’s 
conclusions and considered that these AEs did not give rise to any new safety concern. As for events of 
vitreous floaters and retinal tear, while retinal tear is an identified injection-related risk, the CHMP 
noted that patients suffering an abnormal elongation of the axial length of the eyeball tend to have an 
increased risk of both of these ocular events. In fact, the incidence of cases of retinal tear (3 cases) 
was slightly higher in comparison to the incidence observed in previous development programmes.  
However, it is expected that fewer injections will be required to maintain VA as compared to the other 
approved indications and this would balance a potentially increased risk. 
Based on the observation that IOP increase occurred most frequently in patients treated with 
ranibizumab following previous vPDT treatment, the CHMP requested that the MAH investigated if there 
were any mechanistic grounds that could predispose subjects previously receiving vPDT for an increase 
in IOP. Data provided by the MAH in response to this request indicated that IOP increase was likely 
associated with the intravitreal injection procedure, which was agreed by the CHMP.  
In general, there was limited experience of the safety for subjects previously receiving vPDT and there 
were no data available for concomitant treatment with Visudyne and Lucentis in this indication. In this 
context, the CHMP noted that the update of the product information to inform about the lack of data 
for concomitant treatment with vPDT and the limited available data for PM patients previously treated 
with vPDT in relation to efficacy concerns (see chapter 2.4.5.  for details). In addition, the update of 
the RMP to include use of Visudyne (verteporfin) or laser photocoagulation given in combination with 
ranibizumab in PM patients as important missing information was recommended. Finally, the CHMP 
anticipated that the two planned post-marketing studies would provide useful safety data for this 
population. Otherwise, reporting of IOP increase was considered by the CHMP to be in line with the 
previous experience in the approved indications.  
Overall, the CHMP noted that ocular AEs occurred with a higher incidence in patients of study Group I 
and II compared to those in Group III, and were mainly injection-related AEs. However, the frequency 
of ocular AEs was generally lower or reported to a similar extent (e.g. hypersensitivity) compared to 
the previous development programmes and no new AEs were identified. This was considered 
reassuring by the CHMP despite the limited number of patients and injections.  
As for non-ocular adverse events, the CHMP agreed that the incidence was low and no specific pattern 
raising a safety concern with the active treatment was revealed. Up to month 12, there were however 
7 AEs of non-ocular haemorrhages with the highest frequency in Group II (5 reports), i.e. the group 
that received fewer injections compared to Group I. None of the reports was serious; however a 
potential relation to study drug cannot be excluded for all cases. This theoretical risk of 
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 34/60 
 
 
thromboembolic event and non-ocular haemorrhage was however considered by the CHMP to be 
already adequately addressed in both the product information and the RMP.   
While the safety profile was generally reassuring, the CHMP recommended that the MAH explored 
further reasonable criteria to stop therapy to avoid unnecessary injections. However, following 
amendments to the posology recommendations in order to better define treatment cessation based on 
disease activity criteria (see discussions on posology in chapter 2.4.5.  for details), the CHMP 
considered this concern to be satisfactorily addressed. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The limited size of the safety database in the proposed new indication was the main concern raised by 
the CHMP. However, the CHMP considered that this limitation would not prevent the approval of the 
applied indication in myopic CNV considering that the new population does not have general systemic 
risk factors, has limited ocular co-morbidities and fewer injections were given compared to previous 
studies and already approved indications. Furthermore, the CHMP considered the clinical trial safety 
database of previous development programmes consisting of more than 38,000 subjects plus post 
marketing reporting as supportive of the application. 
Overall, the CHMP was of the opinion that consistency with previous development programmes has 
been demonstrated. No new safety concerns were identified and the CHMP considered the safety 
profile of ranibizumab in the treatment of VA following CNV due to pathologic myopia as reassuring. 
However, in order to enrich the limited safety set in the new indication and to obtain longer-term 
safety data, the CHMP agreed that the MAH included also subjects with PM in the ongoing Luminous 
study and recommended to collect safety data in the planned additional observational study. 
In view of the reassuring safety profile and the considerable experience in the previously approved 
indications, additional safety data are not needed for the approval of the new indication. 
2.5.6.  PSUR cycle  
The 1-year PSUR cycle remains unchanged. The next data lock point will be 30 June 2013. 
The Annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

Posology for the treatment of visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM 
Treatment is initiated with a single injection. 
If monitoring reveals signs of disease activity, e.g. reduced visual acuity and/or signs of 
lesion activity, further treatment is recommended. 
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) or fluorescein angiography (FA). 
While many patients may only need one or two injections during the first year, some 
patients may need more frequent treatment (see section 5.1). Therefore, monitoring is 
recommended monthly for the first two months and at least every three months thereafter 
during the first year. After the first year, the frequency of monitoring should be determined 
by the treating physician. 
The interval between two doses should not be shorter than one month.

Populations with limited data 
(…) 
In patients with PM, there are limited data on the effect of Lucentis in patients who have 
previously undergone unsuccessful vPDT treatment. Also, while a consistent effect was 
observed in subjects with subfoveal and juxtafoveal lesions, there are insufficient data to 
conclude on the effect of Lucentis in PM subjects with extrafoveal lesions. 
(…) 
Systemic effects following intravitreal use 
(…) 
There are limited data on safety in the treatment of DME, and macular oedema due to RVO and CNV 
secondary to PM patients with prior history of stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. Caution should

Package Leaflet: 
–  Section 1 - What Lucentis is and what it is used for 
What Lucentis is 
Lucentis is a solution which is injected into the eye. Lucentis belongs to a group of medicines 
called antineovascularisation agents. It contains the active substance called ranibizumab. , which is a 
part of an antibody. Antibodies are proteins which specifically recognise and bind to other unique 
proteins in the body. Ranibizumab binds selectively to a protein called human vascular endothelial 
growth factor A (VEGF-A). VEGF-A causes abnormal blood vessel growth and swelling in the macula 
which damage the macula and can impair vision. The macula is the central part of the light-sensitive 
back part of the eye called the retina that is responsible for sharp, central vision and is important for 
activities such as reading or recognising faces. By binding to VEGF-A, Lucentis can block its actions and 
prevent this abnormal growth and swelling. 
Lucentis is used in adults to treat damage to the macula caused by growth of leaky, abnormal blood 
vessels in diseases such as wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). It is also used to treat 
diseases such as macular oedema (swelling) caused by diabetes (called diabetic macular oedema, 
DME) or macular oedema due to a blockage of the veins behind the retina (retinal vein occlusion, RVO) 
where fluid accumulates into the back of the eye. Lucentis reduces leaking of the blood vessels, 
swelling in the macula and damage to your retina which, on average, results in improved vision, as 
measured on an eye chart. 
These diseases affect the central part of the retina (called the macula) at the back of the eye. The 
macula provides central vision and damage to the macula causes loss of “straight-ahead” vision. 
What Lucentis is used for 
Lucentis is used in adults to treat several eye diseases causing vision impairment. 
These diseases result from damage to the retina (light-sensitive layer at the back of the 
eye) caused by: 
- Growth of leaky, abnormal blood vessels (choroidal neovascularisation, CNV). This 
is observed in diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or 
pathologic myopia (PM). 
- Macular oedema (swelling of the centre of the retina). This swelling can be caused 
by diabetes (a disease called diabetic macular oedema (DME)) or by the blockage of 
retinal veins of the retina (a disease called retinal vein occlusion (RVO)). 
Lucentis 
Assessment report

How Lucentis works 
Lucentis specifically recognises and binds to a protein called human vascular endothelial 
growth factor A (VEGF-A) present in the eye. In excess, VEGF-A causes abnormal blood 
vessel growth and swelling in the eye which can lead to impairment of vision in diseases like 
AMD, PM, DME or RVO. By binding to VEGF-A, Lucentis can block its actions and prevent this 
abnormal growth and swelling. 
In these diseases, Lucentis can help to stabilise and in many cases improve your vision. 
–  Section 3 - How Lucentis is given 
If you are being treated for wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) 
The injection is treatment is initially given once a month in the first 3 months. Afterwards, your 
doctor will monitor your vision on a monthly basis. If your vision remains the same while you are 
being given Lucentis treatmentcondition is found to be worsening, your doctor may decide to 
stop the treatment with Lucentis. Your doctor will continue to monitor your vision and 
decide if treatment with Lucentis should be resumed or notwill administer Lucentis to your 
affected eye again. 
If you are being treated for visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) or 
macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO) 
The injection is treatment is initially given once a month. Your doctor will monitor your vision 
monthly. If your vision remains the same while you are being given Lucentis treatment, your doctor 
may decide to stop the treatment with Lucentis. Your doctor will continue to monitor your 
vision monthlyand will decide if treatment with Lucentis should be resumed or not. Your doctor may 
decide that you also need to be treated with laser for this condition. If so, laser can be administered 
together with Lucentis. 
If you are being treated for visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) 
secondary to pathologic myopia (PM) 
The treatment is started with one injection of Lucentis. Your doctor will continue to monitor 
the condition of your eye and, depending on how you respond to the treatment, will decide if 
and when you need to receive further treatment.

How to prepare and administer Lucentis 
(…) 
In wet AMD and in, visual impairment due to DME, to andmacular oedema secondary to RVO or to 
CNV secondary to PM, the recommended dose for Lucentis is 0.5 mg given monthly as a single 
intravitreal injection. This corresponds to an injection volume of 0.05 ml. 
(…) 
Visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM 
Treatment is initiated with a single injection. 
If monitoring reveals signs of disease activity, e.g. reduced visual acuity and/or signs of 
lesion activity, further treatment is recommended. 
Monitoring for disease activity may include clinical examination, optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) or fluorescein angiography (FA).

While many patients may only need one or two injections during the first year, some 
patients may need more frequent treatment (see section 5.1). Therefore, monitoring is 
recommended monthly for the first two months and at least every three months thereafter 
during the first year. After the first year, the frequency of monitoring should be determined 
by the treating physician. 
The interval between two doses should not be shorter than one month. 
Lucentis and Visudyne photodynamic therapy in CNV secondary to PM 
There is no experience of concomitant administration of Lucentis and Visudyne. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template and SmPC 
guideline. In this context, the CHMP requested that the MAH implemented QRD template version 9.0, 
which became available during the evaluation procedure and required additional changes to Annex I, 
Annex II and IIIB. The QRD changes were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.  
In addition, changes to the wording of the posology recommendations in the PL for the existing 
indications in order to enhance clarity and reduce complexity of the explanation for the patient as well 
to harmonise the wording used throughout the different approved indications were endorsed by the 
CHMP as were minor editorial amendments introduced by the MAH. Finally, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the details of the local representative in Malta in the Package Leaflet and 
included the local representative of Croatia. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The main objectives in the treatment of CNV secondary to PM are to avoid vision loss, which occurs 
without therapy in the natural course of the disease, and to regain vision in already visually impaired 
patients. This can be measured as visual acuity and indirectly via anatomic markers for active leakage 
and lesions using OCT and FA. In the pivotal and supportive study conducted by the MAH in support of 
this application, mean changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study eye, in form of 
letters on a vision chart, before and after treatment, was used as endpoint to determine a beneficial 
effect of ranibizumab on the vision of visually impaired myopic CNV patients compared to vPDT 
treatment. This together with the additional structural endpoints and patient reported outcomes was 
considered by the CHMP as suitable means to determine a beneficial treatment effect. 
In the pivotal study, superiority of ranibizumab over vPDT treatment was demonstrated after 3 months 
(primary endpoint) with regards to visual acuity [difference in mean change in BCVA was 8.5 (95% CI: 
5.8; 11.2) and 8.6 letters (95% CI: 6.1; 11.1)] for the two ranibizumab treatment groups when 
compared to the vPDT group. While with vPDT maintenance of visual acuity was achieved (BCVA 
change from baseline: 2.2±9.5), ranibizumab treatment resulted in a clinically relevant gain in vision 
(BCVA change from baseline: 10.5±8.2and 10.5±7.3 for treatment group I and II, respectively), which 
was more pronounced in patients with a lower BCVA baseline value. After 6 months, there was no 
clinically relevant difference between the two groups treated with ranibizumab (key secondary efficacy 
endpoint, mean average change of 12 letters in both groups; difference in mean BCVA was -0.1 
letters; 95% CI: -2.2, 2.0). However, during the 6 months, subjects in the ranibizumab treatment 
group applying a regimen of re-treatment based on disease stability criteria received on average 1

Page 47/60 
 
 
 
injection more than those for which the need of re-treatment was determined based on disease activity 
criteria (mean of 3.5 injections versus 2.5 injections). 
Secondary outcomes, including efficacy data after 12 months of treatment and anatomic markers, 
supported a clinically meaningful effect of ranibizumab in the target population and were generally in 
line with the data obtained at month 6.  
About 70% of the patients treated with ranibizumab experienced a gain in BCVA of ≥10 letters or 
reached ≥84 letters overall by the end of the study.  
Notably, most of the effect of ranibizumab on visual acuity was obtained early during treatment with a 
few additional letters gained after 3 months up until the end of the study [mean average change in 
BCVA compared to baseline: 10.5 (after 3 months), 12 (after 6 months) and 14 letters (after 12 
months)]. Anatomic markers and patient reported outcomes also demonstrated clinically relevant 
improvements. 
With regards to the open-label, non-controlled REPAIR study, the CHMP considered the data as 
supportive and in line with the results seen in the pivotal trial. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The CHMP considered that the beneficial effect of ranibizumab was generally consistent among 
subgroups, but the benefit of ranibizumab was less clear in case of patients with extrafoveal lesions. 
Overall, very few study subjects had such lesions. Therefore, the CHMP considered that information on 
the insufficient data to conclude on the effect of Lucentis in subjects with extrafoveal lesions should be 
included in SmPC, section 4.4. Furthermore, published data indicated that there was a risk for a 
reduced effect of VEGF-inhibitors in patients with peripapillary atrophy. The CHMP therefore 
recommended that the MAH conducted post-authorisation a post-hoc analysis from the existing colour 
fundus photography and FA images to evaluate the risk for a reduced effect of ranibizumab in patients 
with CNV due to PM presenting with peripapillary atrophy. The CHMP furthermore recommended that 
additional data should be collected in observational post-marketing studies. 
Furthermore, the CHMP noted the limited available data for patients previously treated with vPDT. Only 
40 previously vPDT-treated subjects received ranibizumab in the pivotal trial and the cross-over design 
creates bias in the evaluation of these data. While published data indicated a lower benefit of anti-
VEGF therapy in pre-treated subjects, these patients (Group III cross over patients) gained additional 
VA once receiving ranibizumab. The CHMP concluded that, while a benefit was indicated in previously 
vPDT-treated subjects, the magnitude of the benefit is not clear. The CHMP therefore requested that 
the limitedness of data in patients who had undergone unsuccessful vPDT therapy before entering the 
study should be reflected in SmPC section 4.4.  
There were no efficacy data collected in subjects receiving combined treatment with vPDT and 
ranibizumab. The CHMP considered that this should be addressed in section 4.2 of SmPC as well as in 
the RMP as important missing information.  
Finally, no efficacy data beyond 12 months was available.. 
To address the limitations of the available efficacy data, the CHMP recommended that additional data 
were collected in observational studies after the authorisation of the new indication. The CHMP 
therefore agreed with the MAH’s proposal for an extension of the ongoing LUMINOUS study with a view 
to collecting additional data on approximately 100 subjects treated for 2 years. However, since these 
data were considered by the CHMP to be still rather limited, the MAH agreed to conduct an additional 
observational 3-year study in this patient population involving 300 subjects with a focus on long-term 
efficacy and with safety as a secondary objective. This study would also aim to obtain additional data 
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 48/60 
 
 
in subjects previously treated with vPDT (or other laser treatment), in subjects with extrafoveal lesions 
and evaluate whether there is a risk of late reactivation of CNV in the long term. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, few AE were reported and the CHMP considered the safety profile arising from the study data 
to be reassuring. No new AEs were identified.  
Ocular AEs were mainly associated with the injection (conjunctival haemorrhage, punctuate keratitis), 
and were generally of mild to moderate severity. The incidence of AEs in the treatment groups of the 
pivotal trial reflected the number of injections and was highest in the group with the most injections. 
Only vitreous floaters, retinal tear and conjunctivitis allergic were AEs not considered related to the 
injection. None of the few reported SAEs were considered related to treatment.  
The incidence of non-ocular AEs was low and no specific pattern indicating safety risks with the active 
treatment was revealed. The most frequent non-ocular AEs in ranibizumab-treated patients (both 
studies) were nasopharyngitis, headache, upper and lower respiratory tract infection, back pain, and 
hypertension. There were no fatalities reported and no discontinuations from study treatment due AEs.  
Safety concerns raised during the assessment in relation to cases of metamorphopsia and the potential 
IOP increase in patients previously treated with vPDT were addressed in additional analyses and 
supportive explanations by the MAH and eventually considered by the CHMP to be likely related to the 
underlying disease (metamorphopsia) and the route of administration (IOP increase) rather than the 
study drug itself. 
Overall, the CHMP considered that all relevant AEs observed in the clinical trials were already 
adequately addressed in the product information and the RMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The overall size of the safety database (290 subjects being treated with ranibizumab over 12 months) 
and in particular in relation to previously vPDT-treated subjects was considered by the CHMP to be 
rather limited. Furthermore, long-term safety data and safety data for the concomitant use of vPDT or 
other laser treatments and ranibizumab were lacking. However, the safety database from previous 
development programmes was considered by the CHMP to provide supportive safety information for 
the treatment with ranibizumab of chronic and progressive conditions. 
There were also uncertainties with regards to less frequent AEs, since the size of the safety database 
did only allow detection of common AEs with sufficient precision. Some concerns were raised with 
regard to cases of retinal detachment and tear. Subjects with high myopia are predisposed for retinal 
detachments, and the risk for detachments and tears may increase due to the injection procedure. 
However, the study data suggested that relatively few injections would be needed, which could 
counterbalance this possible increased risk. 
The CHMP considered it necessary to provide information on the limitations of the safety database in 
the product information and the RMP. Therefore, SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4 were updated and 
important missing information was added to the RMP. 
Furthermore, whilst no additional data were considered necessary prior approval of the new indication, 
the CHMP recommended collection of additional safety data from post-marketing observational studies. 
Both the extended LUMIOUS study and the additional planned observational study will address safety 
of ranibizumab in the myopic CNV population.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The CHMP considered the observed mean gain in visual acuity of more than 10 letters achieved with 
ranibizumab treatment as highly clinically meaningful. Subjects with CNV secondary to PM generally 
have a poor prognosis if being untreated. Published studies report that more than 90% of subjects 
progress to a VA of 20/200 or worse after 10 years. The currently approved treatment option, vPDT, 
essentially halts the progression of the disease, but in average, no improvement in VA is observed. The 
effect of ranibizumab seen in the clinical trials in support of this application was therefore considered to 
present a relevant clinical advantage over vPDT. The effect was achieved rapidly and the fact that the 
gain in vision was maintained throughout the study duration was considered promising. 
No new adverse reaction or other differences in the safety profile compared to previously approved 
indications arose from the clinical trials supporting the application for the new indication. Most events 
were considered related to the intravitreal injection procedure and therefore the treatment regimen 
with the least number of injections was considered most preferable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Whilst a clear beneficial effect of ranibizumab was demonstrated in patients with visual impairment due 
to CNV following pathologic myopia, the safety profile in this condition was considered consistent with 
the already known profile in the approved indications. All known and suspected safety concerns were 
considered to be adequately addressed and managed in the product information and the RMP. 
Furthermore, the treatment regimen with the least number of injections was chosen for the new 
indication.  
Considering that ranibizumab has been shown to stop and partially invert vision loss in the new target 
population, who untreated is likely to suffer progressive visual impairment, the CHMP considered that 
the benefits outweighed the treatment risks. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the data presented by the MAH demonstrated a clinically relevant 
and maintained beneficial effect of ranibizumab in patients with CNV secondary to pathologic myopia.  
The effect was present independent of whether the need for re-treatment was determined based on 
disease stability or activity. However, as patients treated according to disease activity criteria received 
on average one injection less, the CHMP agreed that this approach was preferable and considered the 
recommendations for re-treatment as detailed in SMPC section 4.2 as acceptable. A progressive 
extension of the monitoring frequency with duration of treatment and in absence of disease activity 
signs was agreed by the CHMP.  
Due to the limited available data for vPDT pre-treated patients and patients with extrafoveal lesions, 
the benefit-risk balance in these subgroups is less clear. However, the results for vPDT pre-treated 
patient were promising and the information for patients with extrafoveal lesions was too limited to 
draw firm conclusions.  
No data was collected for the concomitant use of vPDT and ranibizumab therapy, nor in relation to 
patients with peripapillary atrophy. 
Finally, although the clinical trials performed in support of this application were considered by the 
CHMP to be of adequate size and duration, the CHMP noted that data on long-term safety and efficacy 
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 50/60 
 
 
(i.e. beyond one year of treatment) in the new proposed indication was missing. Furthermore, the 
safety database was limited. However, data collected in previous development programmes for the 
already approved indications in chronic and progressive conditions were considered by the CHMP to 
provide supportive evidence of the safety of ranibizumab. 
In summary, few limitations were identified concerning small subgroups and long-term effects. 
However, the CHMP concluded that, in view of the convincing efficacy together with the lack of new 
safety signals as well as the significant experience with Lucentis at the time of this report, these 
limitations did not present major concerns and therefore would not prevent approval of the new 
indication. Nevertheless, the CHMP considered that additional data would help to better characterise 
the benefit-risk profile in the afore-mentioned patient subgroups and with regards to long-term 
therapy as well as prior and concomitant vPDT treatment. However, considering that additional 
information on the limitations of the available data has been included in the product information and 
that the RMP was updated accordingly, the CHMP was of the opinion that it would be acceptable to 
collect these data post approval. Furthermore, the post-marketing setting was considered a suitable 
environment to collect these data as it was anticipated to enable inclusion of a larger number of 
patients and provide information on the use of ranibizumab in real-life clinical practice. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered that the MAH should evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety in 
subjects with CNV secondary to PM in the LUMINOUS study. The study report for LUMINOUS is due Q4 
2017. LUMINOUS is already included as required additional PhV activity in the RMP and the extension 
of the population to PM patients has been adequately reflected in version 11.2 of the RMP. 
The CHMP furthermore recommended that the MAH should perform the following additional studies and 
analyses: 
–  An evaluation of the risk for a reduced effect of ranibizumab in patients with CNV due to PM 
presenting with peripapillary atrophy by end of December 2013. 
– 
Further evaluation of the long-term efficacy and safety in subjects with CNV secondary to PM in 
a 3-year observational study including at least 300 subjects. Study protocol to be submitted 
March 2014. 
4.  Recommendations 
The application for an extension of the indication for treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal 
neovascularisation secondary to pathologic myopia is approvable since other concerns and major 
objections have all been resolved.

As a consequence, update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 , 4.5, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to add 
information on the limited data available for patients with extrafoveal lesions or pre-treated with vPDT 
and the lack of experience with concomitant vPDT and ranibizumab treatment as well as to provide a 
summary of clinical trials data supporting the use in myopic CNV and to supplement all statements in 
the SmPC valid for all indications with a reference to CNV secondary to PM . The Package Leaflet was 
updated in accordance. 
In addition, changes to the wording of the posology recommendations in the PL were introduced for 
the existing indications in order to enhance clarity and reduce complexity of the explanation for the 
patient as well to harmonise the wording used throughout the different approved indications. Minor 
editorial amendments were made as well. The MAH also took the opportunity to update the details of 
the local representative in Malta in the Package Leaflet and to introduce the local representative of 
Croatia. 
Furthermore, the PI was brought in line with the latest QRD template version 9.0. 
The variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

1.  Introduction 
In accordance with the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder (MAH) has applied for an additional one year marketing protection period in the 
framework of the Lucentis procedure (EMEA/H/C/715/II/34). 
The request was based on the MAH’s position that Lucentis represents a significant clinical benefit in 
the treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to pathologic 
myopia (PM) in comparison with existing therapies 
2.  Justification of significant clinical benefit as presented by 
the MAH 
Lucentis has been approved via the centralised procedure in three indications in the European 
Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA); namely, in the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related 
macular degeneration (AMD), of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME), and of 
visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO; branch RVO or 
central RVO). 
The initial marketing authorisation was granted in the EU/EEA for wet AMD in 2007. In line with Article 
14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH requested granting of an additional year of 
marketing protection, provided approval of the new indication in visual impairment due to choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) secondary to pathologic myopia (PM), claiming a clinical significant benefit of 
ranibizumab over existing therapies of this condition. 
2.1.  Demonstration of new therapeutic indication 
Novartis applied for a new indication of ranibizumab in the treatment of visual impairment due to CNV 
secondary to PM, i.e. the abnormal elongation of the axial length of the eyeball (>26 mm) associated 
with high myopia refractive errors (usually greater than 6.0 diopters) 
In patients with PM, deterioration in vision may occur as a result of rupture and leakage of abnormal 
vessel formed (CNV) with subsequent damage of the neurosensory retina. CNV in myopic eyes is 
located between the neurosensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Type 2), and can be 
distinguished biomicroscopically from CNV occurring in eyes with AMD, which is usually located in the 
sub-RPE space (Type 1). Additionally, a typical myopic CNV is less than 1 disc diameter in size, located 
subfoveal or juxtafoveal, and associated with less subretinal fluid or exudates compared with Type 1 
CNV in AMD eyes. During the end stages of natural progression myopic CNV appears as a fibrous 
pigmented scar (Fuchs’ spot), which causes a blind spot in the centre of the visual field. Therefore, the 
MAH concluded that CNV in patients with PM is a different pathologic entity compared with CNV in wet 
AMD. 
Visual impairment in diabetic eyes and eyes with RVO are primarily the result of macular oedema, a 
different pathologic entity than CNV. 
Therefore, the MAH considered that visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM was a new 
indication for ranibizumab.

2.2.  Details of existing therapies 
Visudyne® (verteporfin) photodynamic therapy (vPDT) was the only approved medication to treat 
subfoveal CNV in patients with PM at the time of this application. Treatment with vPDT has been shown 
to halt vision loss; in the VIP study (Verteporfin in Photodynamic Therapy Study Group-VIP report 
no.1, 2001 report no.3, 2003), 86% of patients treated with vPDT lost less than 15 letters of best-
corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at Month 12 compared with 67% of the patients treated with placebo. 
At Month 24, the mean change in BCVA showed maintenance of vision, on average, at the baseline 
levels for patients treated with vPDT and a mean loss of 8 letters in patients treated with placebo. 
Evidence of the benefit of vPDT in patients with extrafoveal CNV is limited to non-randomised clinical 
trials (RCTs) (Pece et al, 2007; Pece et al, 2011), which involved between 20 and 49 eyes of patients 
observed for a mean of 15 to 35 months. Results indicated that BCVA remained stable or improved 
with vPDT in most patients; however, mean BCVA at the final assessment did not differ significantly 
from that at baseline. The percentage of patients with stable or improved BCVA at the final assessment 
was reported for 2 studies and provided further confirmation that vPDT at least stabilises visual acuity 
in most patients (Pece et al, 2007, 61%; Hayashi et al. 2008, 86%). 
The most common treatment of choice for non-subfoveal CNV lesions is laser photocoagulation, which 
is associated with permanent loss of vision within the treated area, as well as formation of new 
abnormal vasculature. 
The efficacy of laser photocoagulation to treat non-subfoveal CNV secondary to PM has been assessed 
in 3 studies involving 27 to 70 eyes (17 to 35 eyes treated with laser) followed for a period of 6 to 48 
months (Parodi et al, 2010; Brancato et al, 1988; Fardeau et al, 1992), and in one prospective case 
series involving 133 eyes that were all treated with laser photocoagulation and followed for 12 to 60 
months (Pece et al, 1995). In general, patients treated with laser photocoagulation showed 
stabilisation of visual acuity, and the majority of patients experienced no change in BCVA over 
12 months. Laser photocoagulation treatment led to some safety concerns in the prospective case 
series. In this study, ocular adverse events (AEs) over the follow-up period of 12 to 60 months 
included progressive scar enlargement in nearly all eyes (96.0%). This was considered by the MAH of 
significant concern, as enlargement of the scar could lead to a long-term loss of vision even in eyes 
that do not experience CNV recurrence. 
Similarly, in an RCT of 27 eyes treated with 1 of 3 different laser wavelengths during photocoagulation, 
the majority of patients reported stable or improved BCVA over the mean 7.2-month follow-up period, 
and only 19% of patients had actual improvements in their BCVA scores (Brancato et al, 1988). In 
another study, an RCT comparing laser therapy with no treatment, a final BCVA of 20/100 or worse at 
the end of the 6- to 48-month follow-up was reported for a smaller proportion of patients who received 
laser therapy compared with those who received no treatment (46% vs 89%) (Fardeau et al, 1992). 
Another study compared laser therapy with off-label intravitreal bevacizumab and vPDT (Parodi et al, 
2010). A non-significant mean loss of 5.5 letters from baseline was observed for laser therapy after 
24 months of follow-up and 41% of patients achieved stabilisation or improvement in BCVA at this 
time point. 
2.3.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy 
The MAH claimed a significant benefit of ranibizumab based on efficacy and justified this claim as 
follows: 
Existing therapies have been shown to maintain levels of visual acuity without significant visual gain. 
Lucentis 
Assessment report 
EMA/716504/2012 
Page 56/60 
 
 
Available published evidence, as well as the results from the pivotal study RFB002F2301 supporting 
the application for the new indication of ranibizumab, provided data on a new magnitude of the 
treatment effect. The treatment benefit of ranibizumab in visually impaired patients due to myopic CNV 
has been shown with a clinically relevant gain in visual acuity of more than 10 letters on average. 
Therefore, treatment with ranibizumab provides a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies in 
patients with visual impairment due to CNV secondary to PM. 
3.  Assessment of the MAH’s justification of significant clinical 
benefit1 
3.1.  Demonstration of new therapeutic indication 
Although CNV occurs in eyes with neovascular age related macular degeneration (AMD), CNV in the 
new proposed indication occurred secondary to PM. The abnormal elongation of the axial length of the 
eyeball can lead to changes of the posterior pole of the eye such as posterior staphyloma, atrophy of 
the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), Bruch’s membrane cracks, subretinal haemorrhage and retinal 
detachment. This in turn may result in CNV, the most vision threatening complication in patients with 
PM.  
The CHMP considered the justification of the MAH for a new indication to be acceptable and agreed that 
the proposed use of ranibizumab in patients with visual impairment following myopic CNS was distinct 
from the previously approved indications for Lucentis. 
3.2.  Details of existing therapies 
The CHMP agreed that the only existing pharmacological therapy for CNV secondary to PM is Visudyne 
(verteporfin) plus photodynamic therapy (vPDT). Verteporfin is a photosensitiser administered 
intravenously which after exposure to visible light causes the in situ generation of cytotoxic reactive 
oxygen species. 
During the clinical development (VIP study, see chapter 2.2. ), on average, vision was stabilised in the 
Visudyne treatment group while the placebo group lost a mean of 8 letters, i.e. there was no mean 
gain in visual acuity achieved with vPDT. This outcome, i.e. that vision is mainly stabilised and no 
relevant improvement is to be expected, has been confirmed in two additional published studies. 
In addition to Visudyne, the CHMP noted that laser photocoagulation is used to treat non-subfoveal 
CNV lesions in this disease. As demonstrated in a number of rather small, published studies, vision was 
mainly stabilised and there is a concern regarding long-term progressive scar enlargements and loss of 
vision after treatment. 
3.3.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy 
The pivotal study (RFB002F2301) in Support of the application for the new indication included subjects 
with active CNV secondary to PM with greater than -6 diopters of spherical equivalence and anterio-
posterior elongation measurement greater than or equal to 26 mm and with at least one of the 
following lesion types in the study eye: subfoveal, juxtafoveal, extrafoveal, margin of the optic disc. 
This was a randomised, double-masked, multi-centre, active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy

(Group III) over 12 months. Patients in Group III were allowed to cross over to ranibizumab treatment 
after Month 3. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority (efficacy) of 0.5 mg ranibizumab driven by 
stabilisation criteria and/or by disease activity re-treatment criteria vs vPDT as assessed by best 
corrected visual acuity (BCVA). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference between the average level of BCVA (letters) over all 
monthly post-baseline assessments from Month 1 to Month 3 (endpoint) and the baseline level of BCVA 
is summarised below.

A rapid VA improvement was observed in the ranibizumab treatment groups (Groups I and II) and 
most of the effect was achieved by Month 2. Thereafter VA was essentially maintained or slightly 
increased during the course of the study up to Month 12. For patients randomised to vPDT an increase 
in VA from Month 3 onwards was shown (see below Figure). However, Group III included 38 patients 
(plus 2 patients who received ranibizumab prior to Month 3  due to a protocol deviation) who received 
ranibizumab after Month 3.

In the pivotal trial, a direct comparison with Visudyne was performed after three months of treatment. 
During this time period ranibizumab-treated subjects gained on average 10-11 letters versus mean 2 
letters in the vPDT group. In addition, approximately 40% of ranibizumab-treated subjects gained ≥15 
letters of visual acuity. The mean gain was maintained or slightly improved throughout the 12 months 
duration of the study. Likewise, the proportion of subjects that gained ≥10 or ≥15 letters increased 
further in the course of the study. Very few subjects treated with ranibizumab lost ≥15 letters during 
the study. 
The study demonstrated superiority of both ranibizumab treatment regimens compared to vPDT at 
Month 3 based on a significantly higher gain in visual acuity observed with ranibizumab at Month 3. At 
month 12, the mean gain in BCVA achieved with ranibizumab was 14 letters, which was considered 
highly clinically relevant by the MAH 
In an indirect comparison with the data from the VIP-study, which showed no mean increase in visual 
acuity during the first 12 months of the study, the effect of ranibizumab demonstrated in the study 
supporting the application for the new indication was considered highly relevant by the CHMP. 
Taken together, the CHMP concluded that a significant clinical benefit of Lucentis over the previously 
approved therapy, vPDT, has been demonstrated. 
4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP agreed that the proposed use of ranibizumab in patients with visual impairment following 
myopic CNV was distinct from the previously approved indications for Lucentis. 
The CHMP furthermore considered that the data submitted in support of the application as well as the 
justification for the extension of the marketing protection period demonstrated a clinically significant 
benefit of ranibizumab in terms of a clinically meaningful increase in visual acuity in visually impaired 
patients with myopic CNV. No such effect has been shown for vPDT or laser photocoagulation therapy 
in this condition. The CHMP therefore considered that the treatment with Lucentis in this new 
therapeutic indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
5.  Recommendation 
The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of Article 
14(11) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 and the “Guidance on elements required to support the 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order 
to benefit from an extended (11-year) marketing protection period”, and considers by consensus that 
the new therapeutic indication brings a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

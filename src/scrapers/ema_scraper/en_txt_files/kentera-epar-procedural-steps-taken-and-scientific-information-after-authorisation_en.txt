Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in 
10/11/2016 
16/12/2016 
SmPC, 
Based on clinical trial experience no dose adjustment is 
order to implement the adopted wording from the 
Labelling and 
considered necessary in the elderly population. Nonetheless 
final PRAC recommendation on the signal on 
psychiatric disorders. Updates to the agreed PRAC 
wording are also made in sections 4.2 and 4.4 to 
further clarify the dose adjustment in the elderly 
population and in section 4.8 to clarify the text on 
adverse reactions considered associated with 
anticholinergic therapy. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the SmPC (Annex I), Labelling (Annexe IIIA) and 
Package leaflet (Annexe IIIB) in accordance with 
EDQM standards terms. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
PL 
Kentera should be used with caution in elderly patients, 
who may be more sensitive to the effects of centrally acting 
anticholinergics and exhibit differences in pharmacokinetics 
(see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
In total 496 patients were exposed to Kentera in the 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week and 
the 14-week safety extension studies. Of these 188 
patients (38%) were 65 years of age and older and 
exhibited no overall differences in safety or effectiveness 
compared to younger patients. Thus based on current 
clinical evidence no need for dose adjustment in elderly 
patients is considered necessary. 
Psychiatric and central nervous system (CNS) 
anticholinergic events like sleep disorders (e.g. insomnia) 
and cognitive disorders have been associated with 
oxybutynin use, especially in elderly patients. Caution 
should be exercised when oxybutynin is administrated 
concomitantly with other anticholinergic medicines (see 
also section 4.5 of the SmPC). If a patient experiences such 
events, drug discontinuation should be considered. Other 
Page 6/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
psychiatric events implying an anticholinergic mechanism 
have been reported during post-marketing use (see section 
4.8 of the SmPC). 
Section 4.8 was updated to add that adverse reactions 
considered associated with anticholinergic therapy in 
general or observed with oral administration of oxybutynin, 
but as of yet not with Kentera in clinical trials  or post-
marketing, are: anorexia, vomiting, reflux oesophagitis, 
decreased sweating, heat stroke, decreased lacrimation, 
mydriasis, tachycardia, arrhythmia, nightmares, 
restlessness, convulsion, intraocular hypertension and 
induction of glaucoma, paranoia, photosensitivity, erectile 
dysfunction. 
In the paediatric population, the safety and efficacy of 
Kentera has not been established. Kentera is not 
recommended for use in the paediatric population. 
Currently available data are described in section 4.8 but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC was also updated to bring it in line 
with the SmPC guidance presenting the adverse event as 
tabulated list.

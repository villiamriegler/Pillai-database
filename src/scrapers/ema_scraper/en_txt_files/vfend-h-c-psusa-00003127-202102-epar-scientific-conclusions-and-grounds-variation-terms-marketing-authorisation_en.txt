Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for voriconazole, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on spontaneous reports including cases with a close temporal relationship, and 
current labelling on SCC, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between voriconazole and 
cutaneous SCC, or Bowen’s disease is at least a reasonable possibility. In order to increase the 
knowledge of voriconazole risks, additional wording regarding Bowen’s disease should be included in 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to reinforce the level of awareness of physicians.  
During the current reporting interval, there were 28 cases reporting 28 serious events matching the 
search criteria for SCC and corresponding to 0.5% of total PM cases compared to 20 cases (1.0%) in the 
previous reporting interval. Out of these 28 SCC cases, there were 4 Bowen’s disease cases. (also see 
Table 11 on page 28 of this AR). 
Based on the 4 additional Bowen’s disease cases reported during this interval (26 cumulatively) the 
MAHs should amend/further specify the current labelling on SCC following post-marketing reports of 
Bowen’s disease. Cumulatively, 26 reports of Bowen’s disease, which is a distinct clinical-pathologic 
variant of SCC in situ were identified. Considering that Bowen’s disease and invasive SCC represent 
different steps within the disease continuum of squamous neoplasia, but also that the incidence of 
Bowen’s disease is similar to SCC in the general population, these cases may suggest under-reporting of 
these reactions. A disproportionality was found for the PT “Bowen’s disease” from EVDAS, ROR (-) = 
32.35 cumulatively. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for voriconazole the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing voriconazole is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

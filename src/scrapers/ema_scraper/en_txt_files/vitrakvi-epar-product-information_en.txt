CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
VITRAKVI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid 
tumours that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, 
- 
who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to 
result in severe morbidity, and 
who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
- 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with VITRAKVI should be initiated by physicians experienced in the administration of 
anticancer therapies. 
The presence of an NTRK gene fusion in a tumour specimen should be confirmed by a validated test 
prior to initiation of treatment with VITRAKVI.

Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose in adults is 100 mg larotrectinib twice daily, until disease progression or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Paediatric population 
Dosing in paediatric patients is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dose in 
paediatric patients is 100 mg/m2 larotrectinib twice daily with a maximum of 100 mg per dose until 
disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the patient should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed 
dose. Patients should take the next dose at the next scheduled time. If the patient vomits after taking a 
dose, the patient should not take an additional dose to make up for vomiting. 
Dose modification 
For all grade 2 adverse reactions, continued dosing may be appropriate, though close monitoring to 
ensure no worsening of the toxicity is advised.  
For all grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions not referring to liver function test abnormalities: 
- 
VITRAKVI should be withheld until the adverse reaction resolves or improves to baseline or 
grade 1. Resume at the next dose modification if resolution occurs within 4 weeks. 
VITRAKVI should be permanently discontinued if an adverse reaction does not resolve within 
4 weeks. 
- 
The recommended dose modifications for VITRAKVI for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1.

Recommended measures 
-  Conduct serial laboratory evaluations frequently after 
the observation of grade 2 toxicity, until resolved, to 
establish whether a dose interruption or reduction is 
required. 
-  Withhold treatment until the adverse reaction resolves 
or improves to baseline. Monitor liver function 
frequently until resolution or return to baseline. 
Permanently discontinue treatment if an adverse 
reaction does not resolve. 
-  Resume at the next dose modification if adverse 
reactions resolve. Treatment should only be resumed 
in patients where the benefit outweighs the risk. 
Permanently discontinue treatment if a grade 4 ALT 
and/or AST elevation occurs after resuming treatment. 
- 
-  Withhold treatment and monitor liver function 
frequently until resolution or return to baseline. 
-  Consider permanent treatment discontinuation. 
- 
Treatment should only be resumed in patients where 
the benefit outweighs the risk. 
If resumed, start at the next lower dose. Monitor liver 
function frequently upon restart. 
Permanently discontinue treatment if adverse reaction 
recurs after resuming treatment.

Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is recommended in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The starting dose of VITRAKVI should be reduced by 50% in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) 
to severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with 
mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
If co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, the VITRAKVI dose should be 
reduced by 50%. After the inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, 
VITRAKVI should be resumed at the dose taken prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor (see 
section 4.5).

Method of administration 
VITRAKVI is for oral use. 
VITRAKVI is available as a capsule or oral solution with equivalent oral bioavailability and may be 
used interchangeably. 
The patient should be advised to swallow the capsule whole with a glass of water. Due to the bitter 
taste, the capsule should not be opened, chewed or crushed. 
The capsules can be taken with or without food but should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit 
juice. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Efficacy across tumour types 
The benefit of VITRAKVI has been established in single arm trials encompassing a relatively small 
sample of patients whose tumours exhibit NTRK gene fusions. Favourable effects of VITRAKVI have 
been shown on the basis of overall response rate and response duration in a limited number of tumour 
types. The effect may be quantitatively different depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant 
genetic alterations (see section 5.1). For these reasons, VITRAKVI should only be used if there are no 
treatment options for which clinical benefit has been established, or where such treatment options have 
been exhausted (i.e., no satisfactory treatment options). 
Neurologic reactions 
Neurologic reactions including dizziness, gait disturbance and paraesthesia were reported in patients 
receiving larotrectinib (see section 4.8). For the majority of neurologic reactions, onset occurred 
within the first three months of treatment. Withholding, reducing, or discontinuing VITRAKVI dosing 
should be considered, depending on the severity and persistence of these symptoms (see section 4.2). 
Hepatotoxicity 
Abnormalities of liver function tests including increased ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and 
bilirubin have been observed in patients receiving larotrectinib (see section 4.8). The majority of ALT 
and AST increases occurred within 3 months of starting treatment. Cases of hepatotoxicity with 
increases in ALT and/or AST of grade 2, 3 or 4 severity and increases in bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN have 
been reported in adult patients. 
In patients with hepatic transaminase elevations, withhold, modify dose or permanently discontinue 
VITRAKVI based on the severity (see section 4.2).  
Liver function including ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin should be monitored before the first dose, then 
every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly for the next 6 months of treatment, 
then periodically during treatment. In patients who develop transaminase elevations, more frequent 
testing is needed (see section 4.2). 
Co-administration with CYP3A4/P-gp inducers 
Avoid co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inducers with VITRAKVI due to a risk 
of decreased exposure (see section 4.5). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contraception in female and male 
Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking VITRAKVI 
and for at least one month after stopping treatment (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). 
Males of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of childbearing potential should 
be advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one 
month after the final dose (see section 4.6). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other agents on larotrectinib 
Effect of CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors on larotrectinib 
Larotrectinib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP). Co-administration of VITRAKVI with strong or moderate CYP3A 
inhibitors, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, 
voriconazole or grapefruit) may increase larotrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.2). 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI 
dose with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor and P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) 200 mg once daily 
for 7 days increased larotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 2.8-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively. 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI 
dose with a single dose of 600 mg rifampicin (a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) increased larotrectinib Cmax 
and AUC by 1.8-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively. 
Effect of CYP3A and P-gp inducers on larotrectinib 
Co-administration of VITRAKVI with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers and strong P-gp inducers 
(e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin, or St. John’s Wort) may decrease 
larotrectinib plasma concentrations and should be avoided (see section 4.4). 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI 
dose with rifampicin (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer) 600 mg once daily for 11 days decreased 
larotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 71% and 81%, respectively. No clinical data is available on the effect 
of a moderate inducer, but a decrease in larotrectinib exposure is expected. 
Effects of larotrectinib on other agents 
Effect of larotrectinib on CYP3A substrates 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of VITRAKVI (100 mg twice 
daily for 10 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam 1.7-fold compared to midazolam 
alone, suggesting that larotrectinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. 
Exercise caution with concomitant use of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g. 
alfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or 
tacrolimus) in patients taking VITRAKVI. If concomitant use of these CYP3A substrates with narrow 
therapeutic range is required in patients taking VITRAKVI, dose reductions of the CYP3A substrates 
may be required due to adverse reactions. 
Effect of larotrectinib on CYP2B6 substrates 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib induces CYP2B6. Co-administration of larotrectinib with 
CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz) may decrease their exposure. 
Effect of larotrectinib on other transporter substrates 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is an inhibitor of OATP1B1. No clinical studies have been 
performed to investigate interactions with OATP1B1 substrates. Therefore, it cannot be excluded 
whether co-administration of larotrectinib with OATP1B1 substrates (e.g. valsartan, statins) may 
increase their exposure. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of larotrectinib on substrates of PXR regulated enzymes 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is a weak inducer of PXR regulated enzymes (e.g. CYP2C 
family and UGT). Co-administration of larotrectinib with CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates 
(e.g. repaglinide, warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may decrease their exposure. 
Hormonal contraceptives 
It is currently unknown whether larotrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting 
hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should 
be advised to add a barrier method. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Based on the mechanism of action, foetal harm cannot be excluded when administering larotrectinib to 
a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting 
treatment with VITRAKVI. 
Women of reproductive potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception during 
treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one month after the final dose. As it is currently unknown 
whether larotrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives, 
women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should be advised to add a barrier method. 
Males of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of childbearing potential should 
be advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one 
month after the final dose. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of larotrectinib in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of VITRAKVI during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether larotrectinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with VITRAKVI and for 3 days following the 
final dose. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effect of larotrectinib on fertility. No relevant effects on fertility were 
observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive or use machines 
VITRAKVI has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and fatigue 
have been reported in patients receiving larotrectinib, mostly grade 1 and 2 during the first 3 months of 
treatment. This may influence the ability to drive and use machines during this time period. Patients 
should be advised not to drive and use machines, until they are reasonably certain VITRAKVI therapy 
does not affect them adversely (see section 4.4).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 20%) of VITRAKVI in order of decreasing frequency 
were increased ALT (33%), increased AST (31%), vomiting (28%), anaemia (27%), constipation 
(27%), diarrhoea (25%), nausea (23%), fatigue (22%), and dizziness (20%). 
The majority of adverse reactions were grade 2 or 3. Grade 4 was the highest reported grade for 
adverse reactions neutrophil count decreased (2%), ALT increased, AST increased, leukocyte count 
decreased, platelet count decreased, muscular weakness and blood alkaline phosphatase increased 
(each in < 1%). The highest reported grade was grade 3 for adverse reactions anaemia (7%), weight 
increased (4%), diarrhoea (3%), gait disturbance (1%), and fatigue, dizziness, paraesthesia, nausea, 
myalgia, and vomiting (each in < 1%).  
Permanent discontinuation of VITRAKVI for treatment emergent adverse reactions occurred in 2% of 
patients (2 cases of neutrophil count decreased, 1 case each of ALT increased, AST increased, gait 
disturbance, vomiting, muscular weakness, fatigue, and nausea). The majority of adverse reactions 
leading to dose reduction occurred in the first three months of treatment. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
The safety of VITRAKVI was evaluated in 335 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer in one of 
three on-going clinical trials, Studies 1, 2 (“NAVIGATE”), and 3 (“SCOUT”) and post-marketing. 
The safety population characteristics were comprised of patients with a median age of 39.0 years 
(range: 0.1, 90) with 37% of patients being paediatric patients. Median time on treatment for the 
overall safety population (n=335) was 14.5 months (range: 0.0, 75.2). 
The adverse drug reactions reported in patients (n=335) treated with VITRAKVI are shown in Table 3 
and Table 4. 
The adverse drug reactions are classified according to the System Organ Class. 
Frequency groups are defined by the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 
to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), 
and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). 
Within each frequency group, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neurologic reactions 
In the overall safety database (n=335), the maximum grade neurologic adverse reaction observed was 
grade 3 or 4 which was observed in 10 (3%) patients and included gait disturbance (4 patients, 1%), 
dizziness (3 patients, <1%), and paraesthesia (3 patients, <1%). The overall incidence was 20% for 
dizziness, 7% for paraesthesia and 5% for gait disturbance. Neurologic reactions leading to dose 
modification or interruptions included dizziness (<1%) and paraesthesia (<1%). One patient 
permanently discontinued the treatment due to grade 3 gait disturbance. In all cases except of one, 
patients with evidence of anti-tumour activity who required a dose reduction were able to continue 
dosing at a reduced dose and/or schedule (see section 4.4). 
Hepatotoxicity 
Abnormalities of liver function tests including ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin have been observed in 
patients treated with VITRAKVI. 
In the overall safety database (n=335), the maximum grade transaminase elevation observed was 
grade 4 ALT increase in 6 patients (2%) and AST increase in 3 patients (1%). Grade 3 ALT and AST 
increases in 17 (5%) and 16 (5%) of patients, respectively. Majority of grade 3 elevations were 
transient appearing in the first three months of treatment and resolving to grade 1 by months 3-4. 
Grade 2 ALT and AST increases were observed in 34 (10%) and 32 (10%) of patients, respectively, 
and grade 1 ALT and AST increases were observed in 157 (47%) and 158 (47%) of patients, 
respectively. 
ALT and AST increases leading to dose modifications or interruptions occurred in 13 (5%) patients 
and 12 (5%) patients, respectively (see section 4.4). One patient permanently discontinued the 
treatment due to grade 3-4 ALT and AST increases. 
Cases of hepatotoxicity with increases in ALT and/or AST of grade 2, 3 or 4 severity and increases in 
bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN have been reported in adult patients. In some cases, the dose of VITRAKVI was 
withheld and restarted at a reduced dose, while in other cases treatment was permanently discontinued 
(see section 4.4). 
Additional information on special populations  
Paediatric patients 
Of the 335 patients treated with VITRAKVI, 124 (37%) patients were from birth to < 18 years of age 
(n=13 from birth to < 3 months, n=4 ≥ 3 months to < 6 months, n=17 ≥ 6 months to < 12 months, n=8 
≥ 12 months to < 2 years, n=27 ≥ 2 years to < 6 years, n=32 ≥ 6 years to < 12 years, n=23 ≥ 12 years 
to < 18 years). The majority of adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity and were resolved 
without VITRAKVI dose modification or discontinuation. Adverse reactions of grade 3 or 4 in 
severity were generally observed more frequently in patients < 6 years of age. They were reported in 
69% of patients from birth to < 3 months and in 48% of patients ≥ 3 months to < 6 years. Decreased 
neutrophil count has been reported to have led to study drug discontinuation, dose modification and 
dose interruption. 
Elderly 
Of the 335 patients in the overall safety population who received VITRAKVI, 65 (19%) patients were 
65 years or older and 20 (6%) patients were 75 years or older. The safety profile in elderly patients 
(≥ 65 years) is consistent with that seen in younger patients. The adverse reaction dizziness (32% 
versus 28% in all adults), anaemia (32% versus 25% in all adults), muscular weakness (14% versus 
11% in all adults), and gait disturbance (8% versus 5% in all adults) were more frequent in patients of 
65 years or older.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is limited experience of overdose with VITRAKVI. Symptoms of overdose are not established. 
In the event of overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and treat 
symptomatically.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, antineoplastic agents, 
protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX12. 
Mechanism of action 
Larotrectinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive and selective tropomyosin receptor 
kinase (TRK) inhibitor that was rationally designed to avoid activity with off-target kinases. The target 
for larotrectinib is the TRK family of proteins inclusive of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC that are encoded 
by NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, respectively. In a broad panel of purified enzyme assays, 
larotrectinib inhibited TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC with IC50 values between 5-11 nM. The only other 
kinase activity occurred at 100-fold higher concentrations. In in vitro and in vivo tumour models, 
larotrectinib demonstrated anti-tumour activity in cells with constitutive activation of TRK proteins 
resulting from gene fusions, deletion of a protein regulatory domain, or in cells with TRK protein 
overexpression. 
In-frame gene fusion events resulting from chromosomal rearrangements of the human genes NTRK1, 
NTRK2, and NTRK3 lead to the formation of oncogenic TRK fusion proteins. These resultant novel 
chimeric oncogenic proteins are aberrantly expressed, driving constitutive kinase activity subsequently 
activating downstream cell signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival leading to 
TRK fusion-positive cancer. 
Acquired resistance mutations after progression on TRK inhibitors have been observed. Larotrectinib 
had minimal activity in cell lines with point mutations in the TRKA kinase domain, including the 
clinically identified acquired resistance mutation, G595R. Point mutations in the TRKC kinase domain 
with clinically identified acquired resistance to larotrectinib include G623R, G696A, and F617L. 
The molecular causes for primary resistance to larotrectinib are not known. It is therefore not known if 
the presence of a concomitant oncogenic driver in addition to an NTRK gene fusion affects the efficacy 
of TRK inhibition. The measured impact of any concomitant genomic alterations on larotrectinib 
efficacy is provided below (see clinical efficacy).

Pharmacodynamic effect 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
In 36 healthy adult subjects receiving single doses ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg, VITRAKVI did 
not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 
The 200 mg dose corresponds to a peak exposure (Cmax) similar to that observed with larotrectinib 
100 mg BID at steady state. A shortening of QTcF was observed with VITRAKVI dosing, with a 
maximum mean effect observed between 3 and 24 hours after Cmax, with a geometric mean decrease in 
QTcF from baseline of -13.2 msec (range -10 to -15.6 msec). Clinical relevance of this finding has not 
been established.  
Clinical efficacy 
Overview of studies 
The efficacy and safety of VITRAKVI were studied in three multicentre, open-label, single-arm 
clinical studies in adult and paediatric cancer patients (Table 5). The studies are still ongoing. 
Patients with and without documented NTRK gene fusion were allowed to participate in Study 1 and 
Study 3 (“SCOUT”). Patients enrolled to Study 2 (“NAVIGATE”) were required to have TRK 
fusion-positive cancer. The pooled primary analysis set of efficacy includes 272 patients with TRK 
fusion-positive cancer enrolled across the three studies that had measurable disease assessed by 
RECIST v1.1, a non-CNS primary tumour and received at least one dose of larotrectinib as of 
July 2022. These patients were required to have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their 
tumour type and stage of disease or who, in the opinion of the investigator, would have had to undergo 
radical surgery (such as limb amputation, facial resection, or paralysis causing procedure), or were 
unlikely to tolerate, or derive clinically meaningful benefit from available standard of care therapies in 
the advanced disease setting. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) 
and duration of response (DOR), as determined by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). 
In addition, 41 patients with primary CNS tumours and measurable disease at baseline were treated in 
Study 2 (“NAVIGATE”) and in Study 3 (“SCOUT”). Forty of the 41 primary CNS tumour patients 
had received prior cancer treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and/or previous systemic therapy). Tumour 
responses were assessed by the investigator using RANO or RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
Identification of NTRK gene fusions relied on tissue samples for the molecular test methods: next 
generation sequencing (NGS) used in 276 patients, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used in 
14 patients, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) used in 18 patients, and other testing methods 
(Sequencing, Nanostring, Sanger sequencing, or Chromosome Microarray) used in 5 patients.

Baseline characteristics for the pooled 272 patients with solid tumours with an NTRK gene fusion were 
as follows: median age 41 years (range 0-90 years); 35% < 18 years of age, and 65% ≥ 18 years; 57% 
white and 49% male; and ECOG PS 0-1 (89%), 2 (9%), or 3 (2%). Ninety-two percent of patients had 
received prior treatment for their cancer, defined as surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy. Of 
these, 72% had received prior systemic therapy with a median of 1 prior systemic treatment regimen. 
Twenty-six percent of all patients had received no prior systemic therapy. Of those 272 patients the 
most common tumour types represented were soft tissue sarcoma (25%), infantile fibrosarcoma (18%), 
thyroid cancer (11%), lung cancer (10%), and salivary gland tumour (9%). 
Baseline characteristics for the 41 patients with primary CNS tumours with an NTRK gene fusion 
assessed by investigator were as follows: median age 11 years (range 1-79 years); 28 patients 
< 18 years of age, and 13 patients ≥ 18 years, and 28 patients white and 20 patients male; and ECOG 
PS 0-1 (36 patients), or 2 (4 patients). Forty (98%) patients had received prior treatment for their

b  with 3 complete, 1 partial response 
c  with 1 complete, 2 partial response 
Due to the rarity of TRK fusion-positive cancer, patients were studied across multiple tumour types 
with a limited number of patients in some tumour types, causing uncertainty in the ORR estimate per 
tumour type. The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a specific 
tumour type. 
In the adult sub-population (n=178), the ORR was 58%. In the paediatric sub-population (n=94), the 
ORR was 84%. 
In 238 patients with wide molecular characterisation before larotrectinib treatment, the ORR in 
128 patients who had other genomic alterations in addition to NTRK gene fusion was 52%, and in 
110 patients without other genomic alterations ORR was 76%. 
Pooled primary analysis set 
The pooled primary analysis set consisted of 272 patients and did not include primary CNS tumours. 
Median time on treatment before disease progression was 19.6 months (range: 0.10 to 75.2 months) 
based on July 2022 cut-off. Fifty-seven percent of patients had received VITRAKVI for 12 months or 
more, 34% had received VITRAKVI 24 months or more, and 21% had received VITRAKVI 
36 months or more, with follow-up ongoing at the time of the analysis. 
At the time of analysis, the median duration of response is 43.3 months (range: 0.0+ to 65.4+), an 
estimated 80% [95% CI: 74, 86] of responses lasted 12 months or longer, 66% [95% CI: 58, 74] of 
responses lasted 24 months or longer, and 51% [95% CI: 42, 60] of responses lasted 36 months or 
longer. Eighty-six percent (86%) [95% CI: 82, 90] of patients treated were alive one year after the start 
of therapy, 77% [95% CI: 72, 82] after two years after the start of therapy, and 72% [95% CI: 66, 78] 
after three years with the median for overall survival not yet being reached. Median progression free 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
survival was 30.8 months at the time of the analysis, with a progression free survival rate of 65% [95% 
CI: 59, 71] after 1 year, 56% [95% CI: 49, 62] after 2 years, and 43% [95% CI: 36, 50] after 3 years. 
The median change in tumour size in the pooled primary analysis set was a decrease of 79%. 
Patients with primary CNS tumours 
At the time of data cut-off, of the 41 patients with primary CNS tumours confirmed response was 
observed in 9 patients (22%) with 1 of the 41 patients (2%) being complete responders and 8 patients 
(20%) being partial responders. Further 20 patients (49%) had stable disease. Twelve patients (29%) 
had progressive disease. At the time of data cut-off, time on treatment ranged from 1.7 to 50.9 months 
and was ongoing in 13 out of 41 patients, with one of these patients receiving post-progression 
treatment. 
Conditional approval 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In cancer patients given VITRAKVI capsules, peak plasma levels (Cmax) of larotrectinib were achieved 
at approximately 1 hour after dosing. Half-life (t½) is approximately 3 hours and steady state is reached 
within 8 days with a systemic accumulation of 1.6 fold. At the recommended dose of 100 mg taken 
twice daily, steady-state arithmetic mean (± standard deviation) Cmax and daily AUC in adults were 
914 ± 445 ng/mL and 5410 ± 3813 ng*h/mL, respectively. In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is 
not a substrate for either OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect clearance of 
substrates of these CYPs. 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib does not inhibit the transporters BCRP, P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B3, BSEP, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations and is 
unlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these transporters. 
Absorption 
VITRAKVI is available as a capsule and oral solution formulation. 
The mean absolute bioavailability of larotrectinib was 34% (range: 32% to 37%) following a single 
100 mg oral dose. In healthy adult subjects, the AUC of larotrectinib in the oral solution formulation 
was similar to the capsule, with Cmax 36% higher with the oral solution formulation. 
Larotrectinib Cmax was reduced by approximately 35% and there was no effect on AUC in healthy 
subjects administered VITRAKVI after a high-fat and high-calorie meal compared to the Cmax and 
AUC after overnight fasting. 
Effect of gastric pH-elevating agents on larotrectinib 
Larotrectinib has pH-dependent solubility. In vitro studies show that in liquid volumes relevant to the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract larotrectinib is fully soluble over entire pH range of the GI tract. Therefore, 
larotrectinib is unlikely to be affected by pH-modifying agents. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution of larotrectinib in healthy adult subjects was 48 L following 
intravenous administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose. Binding of 
larotrectinib to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 70% and was independent of drug 
concentration. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was approximately 0.9. 
Biotransformation 
Larotrectinib was metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4/5 in vitro. Following oral administration of 
a single 100 mg dose of radiolabelled larotrectinib to healthy adult subjects, unchanged larotrectinib 
(19%) and an O-glucuronide that is formed following loss of the hydroxypyrrolidine-urea moiety 
(26%) were the major circulating radioactive drug components. 
Elimination 
The half-life of larotrectinib in plasma of cancer patients given 100 mg twice daily of VITRAKVI was 
approximately 3 hours. Mean clearance (CL) of larotrectinib was approximately 34 L/h following 
intravenous administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of 
VITRAKVI. 
Excretion 
Following oral administration of 100 mg radiolabelled larotrectinib to healthy adult subjects, 58% of 
the administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 39% was recovered in urine and when an 
IV microtracer dose was given in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of larotrectinib, 35% of the 
administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 53% was recovered in urine. The fraction 
excreted as unchanged drug in urine was 29% following IV microtracer dose, indicating that direct 
renal excretion accounted for 29% of total clearance. 
Linearity / non-linearity 
The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) of larotrectinib after a single dose in healthy adult subjects were dose proportional up to 400 mg 
and slightly greater than proportional at doses of 600 to 900 mg. 
Special populations 
Paediatric patients 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, exposure (Cmax and AUC) in paediatric patients at the 
recommended dose of 100 mg/m2 with a maximum of 100 mg BID was higher than in adults 
(≥ 18 years of age) given the dose of 100 mg BID (see Table 8).  
Data defining exposure in small children (1 month to < 2 years of age) at the recommended dose is 
limited (n=40).

Patients with hepatic impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate 
(Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, and in healthy adult control subjects 
with normal hepatic function matched for age, body mass index and sex. All subjects received a single 
100 mg dose of larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib AUC0-inf was observed in subjects with mild, 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment of 1.3, 2 and 3.2-fold respectively versus those with normal 
hepatic function. Cmax was observed to increase slightly by 1.1, 1.1 and 1.5-fold respectively. 
Patients with renal impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis, 
and in healthy adult control subjects with normal renal function matched for age, body mass index and 
sex. All subjects received a single 100 mg dose of larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib Cmax and 
AUC0-inf, of 1.25 and 1.46-fold respectively was observed in renally impaired subjects versus those 
with normal renal function. 
Other special populations 
Gender did not appear to influence larotrectinib pharmacokinetics to a clinically significant extent. 
There was not enough data to investigate the potential influence of race on the systemic exposure of 
larotrectinib. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Systemic toxicity 
Systemic toxicity was assessed in studies with daily oral administration up to 3 months in rats and 
monkeys. Dose limiting skin lesions were only seen in rats and were primarily responsible for 
mortality and morbidity. Skin lesions were not seen in monkeys. 
Clinical signs of gastrointestinal toxicity were dose limiting in monkeys. In rats, severe toxicity 
(STD10) was observed at doses corresponding to 1- to 2-times the human AUC at the recommended 
clinical dose. No relevant systemic toxicity was observed in monkeys at doses which correspond to 
> 10-times the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Embryotoxicity / Teratogenicity  
Larotrectinib was not teratogenic and embryotoxic when dosed daily during the period of 
organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at maternotoxic doses, i.e. corresponding to 32-times (rats) 
and 16-times (rabbits) the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. Larotrectinib crosses the 
placenta in both species. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Fertility studies with larotrectinib have not been conducted. In 3-months toxicity studies, larotrectinib 
had no histological effect on the male reproductive organs in rats and monkeys at the highest tested 
doses corresponding to approximately 7-times (male rats) and 10-times (male monkeys) the human 
AUC at the recommended clinical dose. In addition, larotrectinib had no effect on spermatogenesis in 
rats. 
In a 1-month repeat-dose study in rats, fewer corpora lutea, increased incidence of anestrus and 
decreased uterine weight with uterine atrophy were observed and these effects were reversible. No 
effects on female reproductive organs were seen in the 3-months toxicity studies in rats and monkeys 
at doses corresponding to approximately 3-times (female rats) and 17-times (female monkeys) the 
human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. 
Larotrectinib was administered to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 to 70. Pre-weaning 
mortality (before PND 21) was observed at the high dose level corresponding to 2.5- to 4-times the 
AUC at the recommended dose. Growth and nervous system effects were seen at 0.5- to 4-times the 
AUC at the recommended dose. Body weight gain was decreased in pre-weaning male and female 
pups, with a post-weaning increase in females at the end of exposure whereas reduced body weight 
gain was seen in males also post-weaning without recovery. The male growth reduction was 
associated with delayed puberty. Nervous system effects (i.e. altered hindlimb functionality and, 
likely, increases in eyelid closure) demonstrated partial recovery. A decrease in pregnancy rate was 
also reported despite normal mating at the high-dose level. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with larotrectinib. 
Larotrectinib was not mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assays and in in vitro 
mammalian mutagenesis assays. Larotrectinib was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test at 
the maximum tolerated dose of 500 mg/kg. 
Safety pharmacology 
The safety pharmacology of larotrectinib was evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo studies that 
assessed effects on the CV, CNS, respiratory, and GI systems in various species. Larotrectinib had no 
adverse effect on haemodynamic parameters and ECG intervals in telemetered monkeys at exposures 
(Cmax) which are approximately 6-fold the human therapeutic exposures. Larotrectinib had no 
neurobehavioural findings in adult animals (rats, mice, cynomolgus monkeys) at exposure (Cmax) at 
least 7-fold higher than the human exposure. Larotrectinib had no effect on respiratory function in rats; 
at exposures (Cmax) at least 8-times the human therapeutic exposure. In rats, larotrectinib accelerated 
intestinal transit and increased gastric secretion and acidity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
VITRAKVI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid 
tumours that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, 
- 
who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to 
result in severe morbidity, and 
who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
- 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with VITRAKVI should be initiated by physicians experienced in the administration of 
anticancer therapies. 
The presence of an NTRK gene fusion in a tumour specimen should be confirmed by a validated test 
prior to initiation of treatment with VITRAKVI. 
Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose in adults is 100 mg larotrectinib twice daily, until disease progression or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Paediatric population 
Dosing in paediatric patients is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dose in 
paediatric patients is 100 mg/m2 larotrectinib twice daily with a maximum of 100 mg per dose until 
disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the patient should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed 
dose. Patients should take the next dose at the next scheduled time. If the patient vomits after taking a 
dose, the patient should not take an additional dose to make up for vomiting. 
Dose modification 
For all grade 2 adverse reactions, continued dosing may be appropriate, though close monitoring to 
ensure no worsening of the toxicity is advised. 
For all grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions not referring to liver function test abnormalities: 
- 
VITRAKVI should be withheld until the adverse reaction resolves or improves to baseline or 
grade 1. Resume at the next dose modification if resolution occurs within 4 weeks. 
VITRAKVI should be permanently discontinued if an adverse reaction does not resolve within 
4 weeks. 
- 
The recommended dose modifications for VITRAKVI for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1.

Recommended measures 
-  Conduct serial laboratory evaluations frequently after 
the observation of grade 2 toxicity, until resolved, to 
establish whether a dose interruption or reduction is 
required. 
-  Withhold treatment until the adverse reaction resolves 
or improves to baseline. Monitor liver function 
frequently until resolution or return to baseline. 
Permanently discontinue treatment if an adverse 
reaction does not resolve. 
Resume at the next dose modification if adverse 
reactions resolve. Treatment should only be resumed 
in patients where the benefit outweighs the risk. 
Permanently discontinue treatment if a grade 4 ALT 
and/or AST elevation occurs after resuming treatment. 
- 
- 
-  Withhold treatment and monitor liver function 
frequently until resolution or return to baseline. 
-  Consider permanent treatment discontinuation. 
- 
Treatment should only be resumed in patients where 
the benefit outweighs the risk. 
If resumed, start at the next lower dose. Monitor liver 
function frequently upon restart. 
Permanently discontinue treatment if adverse reaction 
recurs after resuming treatment.

Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is recommended in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The starting dose of VITRAKVI should be reduced by 50% in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) 
to severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with 
mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
If co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, the VITRAKVI dose should be 
reduced by 50%. After the inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, 
VITRAKVI should be resumed at the dose taken prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor (see 
section 4.5). 
Method of administration 
VITRAKVI is for oral use. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VITRAKVI is available as a capsule or oral solution with equivalent oral bioavailability and may be 
used interchangeably. 
The oral solution should be administered by mouth using an oral syringe of 1 mL or 5 mL volume or 
enterally by using a nasogastric feeding tube. 
- 
For doses below 1 mL a 1 mL oral syringe should be used. The calculated dose volume should 
be rounded to the nearest 0.1 mL. 
For doses of 1 mL and higher a 5 mL oral syringe should be used. The dose volume should be 
calculated to the nearest 0.2 mL. 
VITRAKVI should not be mixed with feeding formulas, if administered via nasogastric feeding 
tube. Mixing with the feeding formulas could lead to tube blockages. 
For instructions for use of oral syringes and feeding tubes see section 6.6. 
- 
- 
- 
The oral solution can be taken with or without food but should not be taken with grapefruit or 
grapefruit juice. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Efficacy across tumour types 
The benefit of VITRAKVI has been established in single arm trials encompassing a relatively small 
sample of patients whose tumours exhibit NTRK gene fusions. Favourable effects of VITRAKVI have 
been shown on the basis of overall response rate and response duration in a limited number of tumour 
types. The effect may be quantitatively different depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant 
genetic alterations (see section 5.1). For these reasons, VITRAKVI should only be used if there are no 
treatment options for which clinical benefit has been established, or where such treatment options have 
been exhausted (i.e., no satisfactory treatment options). 
Neurologic reactions 
Neurologic reactions including dizziness, gait disturbance and paraesthesia were reported in patients 
receiving larotrectinib (see section 4.8). For the majority of neurologic reactions, onset occurred 
within the first three months of treatment. Withholding, reducing, or discontinuing VITRAKVI dosing 
should be considered, depending on the severity and persistence of these symptoms (see section 4.2). 
Hepatotoxicity 
Abnormalities of liver function tests including increased ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and 
bilirubin have been observed in patients receiving larotrectinib (see section 4.8). The majority of ALT 
and AST increases occurred within 3 months of starting treatment. Cases of hepatotoxicity with 
increases in ALT and/or AST of grade 2, 3 or 4 severity and increases in bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN have 
been reported in adult patients. 
In patients with hepatic transaminase elevations, withhold, modify dose or permanently discontinue 
VITRAKVI based on the severity (see section 4.2). 
Liver function including ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin should be monitored before the first dose, then 
every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly for the next 6 months of treatment, 
then periodically during treatment. In patients who develop transaminase elevations, more frequent 
testing is needed (see section 4.2). 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration with CYP3A4/P-gp inducers 
Avoid co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inducers with VITRAKVI due to a risk 
of decreased exposure (see section 4.5). 
Contraception in female and male 
Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking VITRAKVI 
and for at least one month after stopping treatment (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).  
Males of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of childbearing potential should 
be advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one 
month after the final dose (see section 4.6).

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other agents on larotrectinib 
Effect of CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors on larotrectinib 
Larotrectinib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP). Co-administration of VITRAKVI with strong or moderate CYP3A 
inhibitors, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, 
voriconazole or grapefruit) may increase larotrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.2). 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI 
dose with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor and P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) 200 mg once daily 
for 7 days increased larotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 2.8-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively. 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI 
dose with a single dose of 600 mg rifampicin (a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) increased larotrectinib Cmax 
and AUC by 1.8-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively. 
Effect of CYP3A and P-gp inducers on larotrectinib 
Co-administration of VITRAKVI with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers and strong P-gp inducers 
(e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin, or St. John’s Wort) may decrease 
larotrectinib plasma concentrations and should be avoided (see section 4.4). 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI 
dose with rifampicin (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer) 600 mg once daily for 11 days decreased 
larotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 71% and 81%, respectively. No clinical data is available on the effect 
of a moderate inducer, but a decrease in larotrectinib exposure is expected. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effects of larotrectinib on other agents 
Effect of larotrectinib on CYP3A substrates 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of VITRAKVI (100 mg twice 
daily for 10 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam 1.7-fold compared to midazolam 
alone, suggesting that larotrectinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. 
Exercise caution with concomitant use of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g. 
alfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or 
tacrolimus) in patients taking VITRAKVI. If concomitant use of these CYP3A substrates with narrow 
therapeutic range is required in patients taking VITRAKVI, dose reductions of the CYP3A substrates 
may be required due to adverse reactions. 
Effect of larotrectinib on CYP2B6 substrates 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib induces CYP2B6. Co-administration of larotrectinib with 
CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz) may decrease their exposure. 
Effect of larotrectinib on other transporter substrates 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is an inhibitor of OATP1B1. No clinical studies have been 
performed to investigate interactions with OATP1B1 substrates. Therefore, it cannot be excluded 
whether co-administration of larotrectinib with OATP1B1 substrates (e.g. valsartan, statins) may 
increase their exposure. 
Effect of larotrectinib on substrates of PXR regulated enzymes 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is a weak inducer of PXR regulated enzymes (e.g. CYP2C 
family and UGT). Co-administration of larotrectinib with CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates 
(e.g. repaglinide, warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may decrease their exposure. 
Hormonal contraceptives 
It is currently unknown whether larotrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting 
hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should 
be advised to add a barrier method. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Based on the mechanism of action, foetal harm cannot be excluded when administering larotrectinib to 
a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting 
treatment with VITRAKVI. 
Women of reproductive potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception during 
treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one month after the final dose. As it is currently unknown 
whether larotrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives, 
women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should be advised to add a barrier method. 
Males of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of childbearing potential should 
be advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one 
month after the final dose. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of larotrectinib in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of VITRAKVI during pregnancy. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether larotrectinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with VITRAKVI and for 3 days following the 
final dose. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effect of larotrectinib on fertility. No relevant effects on fertility were 
observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive or use machines 
VITRAKVI has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and fatigue 
have been reported in patients receiving larotrectinib, mostly grade 1 and 2 during the first 3 months of 
treatment. This may influence the ability to drive and use machines during this time period. Patients 
should be advised not to drive and use machines, until they are reasonably certain VITRAKVI therapy 
does not affect them adversely (see section 4.4). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 20%) of VITRAKVI in order of decreasing frequency 
were increased ALT (33%), increased AST (31%), vomiting (28%), anaemia (27%), constipation 
(27%), diarrhoea (25%), nausea (23%), fatigue (22%), and dizziness (20%). 
The majority of adverse reactions were grade 2 or 3. Grade 4 was the highest reported grade for 
adverse reactions neutrophil count decreased (2%), ALT increased, AST increased, leukocyte count 
decreased, platelet count decreased, muscular weakness and blood alkaline phosphatase increased 
(each in < 1%). The highest reported grade was grade 3 for adverse reactions anaemia (7%), weight 
increased (4%), diarrhoea (3%), gait disturbance (1%), and fatigue, dizziness, paraesthesia, nausea, 
myalgia, and vomiting (each in < 1%). 
Permanent discontinuation of VITRAKVI for treatment emergent adverse reactions occurred in 2% of 
patients (2 cases of neutrophil count decreased, 1 case each of ALT increased, AST increased, gait 
disturbance, vomiting, muscular weakness, fatigue, and nausea ). The majority of adverse reactions 
leading to dose reduction occurred in the first three months of treatment. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of VITRAKVI was evaluated in 335 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer in one of 
three on-going clinical trials, Studies 1, 2 (“NAVIGATE”), and 3 (“SCOUT”) and post-marketing. 
The safety population characteristics were comprised of patients with a median age of 39.0 years 
(range: 0.1, 90) with 37% of patients being paediatric patients. Median time on treatment for the 
overall safety population (n=335) was 14.5 months (range: 0.0, 75.2). 
The adverse drug reactions reported in patients (n=335) treated with VITRAKVI are shown in Table 3 
and Table 4. 
The adverse drug reactions are classified according to the System Organ Class. 
Frequency groups are defined by the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 
to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), 
and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). 
Within each frequency group, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neurologic reactions 
In the overall safety database (n=335), the maximum grade neurologic adverse reaction observed was 
grade 3 or 4 which was observed in 10 (3%) patients and included gait disturbance (4 patients, 1%), 
dizziness (3 patients, <1%), and paraesthesia (3 patients, <1%). The overall incidence was 20% for 
dizziness, 7% for paraesthesia and 5% for gait disturbance. Neurologic reactions leading to dose 
modification or interruptions included dizziness (<1%) and paraesthesia (<1%). One patient 
permanently discontinued the treatment due to grade 3 gait disturbance. In all cases except of one, 
patients with evidence of anti-tumour activity who required a dose reduction were able to continue 
dosing at a reduced dose and/or schedule (see section 4.4). 
Hepatotoxicity 
Abnormalities of liver function tests including ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin have been observed in 
patients treated with VITRAKVI. 
In the overall safety database (n=335), the maximum grade transaminase elevation observed was 
grade 4 ALT increase in 6 patients (2%) and AST increase in 3 patients (1%). Grade 3 ALT and AST 
increases in 17 (5%) and 16 (5%) of patients, respectively. Majority of grade 3 elevations were 
transient appearing in the first three months of treatment and resolving to grade 1 by months 3-4. 
Grade 2 ALT and AST increases were observed in 34 (10%) and 32 (10%) of patients, respectively, 
and grade 1 ALT and AST increases were observed in 157 (47%) and 158 (47%) of patients, 
respectively. 
ALT and AST increases leading to dose modifications or interruptions occurred in 13 (5%) patients 
and 12 (5%) patients, respectively (see section 4.4). One patient permanently discontinued the 
treatment due to grade 3-4 ALT and AST increases. 
Cases of hepatotoxicity with increases in ALT and/or AST of grade 2, 3 or 4 severity and increases in 
bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN have been reported in adult patients. In some cases, the dose of VITRAKVI was 
withheld and restarted at a reduced dose, while in other cases treatment was permanently discontinued 
(see section 4.4). 
Additional information on special populations  
Paediatric patients 
Of the 335 patients treated with VITRAKVI, 124 (37%) patients were from birth to < 18 years of age 
(n=13 from birth to < 3 months, n=4 ≥ 3 months to < 6 months, n=17 ≥ 6 months to < 12 months, n=8 
≥ 12 months to < 2 years, n=27 ≥ 2 years to < 6 years, n=32 ≥ 6 years to < 12 years, n=23 ≥ 12 years 
to < 18 years). The majority of adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity and were resolved 
without VITRAKVI dose modification or discontinuation. Adverse reactions of grade 3 or 4 in 
severity were generally observed more frequently in patients < 6 years of age. They were reported in 
69% of patients from birth to < 3 months and in 48% of patients ≥ 3 months to < 6 years. Decreased 
neutrophil count has been reported to have led to study drug discontinuation, dose modification and 
dose interruption. 
Elderly 
Of the 335 patients in the overall safety population who received VITRAKVI, 65 (19%) patients were 
65 years or older and 20 (6%) patients were 75 years or older. The safety profile in elderly patients 
(≥ 65 years) is consistent with that seen in younger patients. The adverse reaction dizziness (32% 
versus 28% in all adults), anaemia (32% versus 25% in all adults), muscular weakness (14% versus 
11% in all adults), and gait disturbance (8% versus 5% in all adults) were more frequent in patients of 
65 years or older.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is limited experience of overdose with VITRAKVI. Symptoms of overdose are not established. 
In the event of overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and treat 
symptomatically.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, antineoplastic agents, 
protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX12. 
Mechanism of action 
Larotrectinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive and selective tropomyosin receptor 
kinase (TRK) inhibitor that was rationally designed to avoid activity with off-target kinases. The target 
for larotrectinib is the TRK family of proteins inclusive of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC that are encoded 
by NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, respectively. In a broad panel of purified enzyme assays, 
larotrectinib inhibited TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC with IC50 values between 5-11 nM. The only other 
kinase activity occurred at 100-fold higher concentrations. In in vitro and in vivo tumour models, 
larotrectinib demonstrated anti-tumour activity in cells with constitutive activation of TRK proteins 
resulting from gene fusions, deletion of a protein regulatory domain, or in cells with TRK protein 
overexpression. 
In-frame gene fusion events resulting from chromosomal rearrangements of the human genes NTRK1, 
NTRK2, and NTRK3 lead to the formation of oncogenic TRK fusion proteins. These resultant novel 
chimeric oncogenic proteins are aberrantly expressed, driving constitutive kinase activity subsequently 
activating downstream cell signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival leading to 
TRK fusion-positive cancer. 
Acquired resistance mutations after progression on TRK inhibitors have been observed. Larotrectinib 
had minimal activity in cell lines with point mutations in the TRKA kinase domain, including the 
clinically identified acquired resistance mutation, G595R. Point mutations in the TRKC kinase domain 
with clinically identified acquired resistance to larotrectinib include G623R, G696A, and F617L. 
The molecular causes for primary resistance to larotrectinib are not known. It is therefore not known if 
the presence of a concomitant oncogenic driver in addition to an NTRK gene fusion affects the efficacy 
of TRK inhibition. The measured impact of any concomitant genomic alterations on larotrectinib 
efficacy is provided below (see clinical efficacy).

Pharmacodynamic effect 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
In 36 healthy adult subjects receiving single doses ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg, VITRAKVI did 
not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 
The 200 mg dose corresponds to a peak exposure (Cmax) similar to that observed with larotrectinib 
100 mg BID at steady state. A shortening of QTcF was observed with VITRAKVI dosing, with a 
maximum mean effect observed between 3 and 24 hours after Cmax, with a geometric mean decrease in 
QTcF from baseline of -13.2 msec (range -10 to -15.6 msec). Clinical relevance of this finding has not 
been established.  
Clinical efficacy 
Overview of studies 
The efficacy and safety of VITRAKVI were studied in three multicentre, open-label, single-arm 
clinical studies in adult and paediatric cancer patients (Table 5). The studies are still ongoing. 
Patients with and without documented NTRK gene fusion were allowed to participate in Study 1 and 
Study 3 (“SCOUT”). Patients enrolled to Study 2 (“NAVIGATE”) were required to have TRK 
fusion-positive cancer. The pooled primary analysis set of efficacy includes 272 patients with TRK 
fusion-positive cancer enrolled across the three studies that had measurable disease assessed by 
RECIST v1.1, a non-CNS primary tumour and received at least one dose of larotrectinib as of 
July 2022. These patients were required to have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their 
tumour type and stage of disease or who, in the opinion of the investigator, would have had to undergo 
radical surgery (such as limb amputation, facial resection, or paralysis causing procedure), or were 
unlikely to tolerate, or derive clinically meaningful benefit from available standard of care therapies in 
the advanced disease setting. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) 
and duration of response (DOR), as determined by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). 
In addition, 41 patients with primary CNS tumours and measurable disease at baseline were treated in 
Study 2 (“NAVIGATE”) and in Study 3 (“SCOUT”). Forty of the 41 primary CNS tumour patients 
had received prior cancer treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and/or previous systemic therapy). Tumour 
responses were assessed by the investigator using RANO or RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
Identification of NTRK gene fusions relied on tissue samples for the molecular test methods: next 
generation sequencing (NGS) used in 276 patients, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used in 
14 patients, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) used in 18 patients, and other testing methods 
(Sequencing, Nanostring, Sanger sequencing, or Chromosome Microarray) used in 5 patients.

Baseline characteristics for the pooled 272 patients with solid tumours with an NTRK gene fusion were 
as follows: median age 41 years (range 0-90 years); 35% < 18 years of age, and 65% ≥ 18 years; 57% 
white and 49% male; and ECOG PS 0-1 (89%), 2 (9%), or 3 (2%). Ninety-two percent of patients had 
received prior treatment for their cancer, defined as surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy. Of 
these, 72% had received prior systemic therapy with a median of 1 prior systemic treatment regimen. 
Twenty-six percent of all patients had received no prior systemic therapy. Of those 272 patients the 
most common tumour types represented were soft tissue sarcoma (25%), infantile fibrosarcoma (18%), 
thyroid cancer (11%), lung cancer (10%), and salivary gland tumour (9%). 
Baseline characteristics for the 41 patients with primary CNS tumours with an NTRK gene fusion 
assessed by investigator were as follows: median age 11 years (range 1-79 years); 28 patients 
< 18 years of age, and 13 patients ≥ 18 years, and 28 patients white and 20 patients male; and ECOG

b  with 3 complete, 1 partial response 
c  with 1 complete, 2 partial response 
Due to the rarity of TRK fusion-positive cancer, patients were studied across multiple tumour types 
with a limited number of patients in some tumour types, causing uncertainty in the ORR estimate per 
tumour type. The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a specific 
tumour type. 
In the adult sub-population (n=178), the ORR was 58%. In the paediatric sub-population (n=94), the 
ORR was 84%. 
In 238 patients with wide molecular characterisation before larotrectinib treatment, the ORR in 
128 patients who had other genomic alterations in addition to NTRK gene fusion was 52%, and in 
110 patients without other genomic alterations ORR was 76%. 
Pooled primary analysis set 
The pooled primary analysis set consisted of 272 patients and did not include primary CNS tumours. 
Median time on treatment before disease progression was 19.6 months (range: 0.10 to 75.2 months) 
based on July 2022 cut-off. Fifty-seven percent of patients had received VITRAKVI for 12 months or 
more, 34% had received VITRAKVI 24 months or more, and 21% had received VITRAKVI 
36 months or more, with follow-up ongoing at the time of the analysis. 
At the time of analysis, the median duration of response is 43.3 months (range: 0.0+ to 65.4+), an 
estimated 80% [95% CI: 74, 86] of responses lasted 12 months or longer, 66% [95% CI: 58, 74] of 
responses lasted 24 months or longer, and 51% [95% CI: 42, 60] of responses lasted 36 months or 
longer. Eighty-six percent (86%) [95% CI: 82, 90] of patients treated were alive one year after the start 
of therapy, 77% [95% CI: 72, 82] after two years after the start of therapy, and 72% [95% CI: 66, 78] 
after three years with the median for overall survival not yet being reached. Median progression free 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
survival was 30.8 months at the time of the analysis, with a progression free survival rate of 65% [95% 
CI: 59, 71] after 1 year, 56% [95% CI: 49, 62] after 2 years, and 43% [95% CI: 36, 50] after 3 years. 
The median change in tumour size in the pooled primary analysis set was a decrease of 79%. 
Patients with primary CNS tumours 
At the time of data cut-off, of the 41 patients with primary CNS tumours confirmed response was 
observed in 9 patients (22%) with 1 of the 41 patients (2%) being complete responders and 8 patients 
(20%) being partial responders. Further 20 patients (49%) had stable disease. Twelve patients (29%) 
had progressive disease. At the time of data cut-off, time on treatment ranged from 1.7 to 50.9 months 
and was ongoing in 13 out of 41 patients, with one of these patients receiving post-progression 
treatment. 
Conditional approval 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In cancer patients given VITRAKVI capsules, peak plasma levels (Cmax) of larotrectinib were achieved 
at approximately 1 hour after dosing. Half-life (t½) is approximately 3 hours and steady state is reached 
within 8 days with a systemic accumulation of 1.6 fold. At the recommended dose of 100 mg taken 
twice daily, steady-state arithmetic mean (± standard deviation) Cmax and daily AUC in adults were 
914 ± 445 ng/mL and 5410 ± 3813 ng*h/mL, respectively. In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is 
not a substrate for either OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect clearance of 
substrates of these CYPs. 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib does not inhibit the transporters BCRP, P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B3, BSEP, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations and is 
unlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these transporters. 
Absorption 
VITRAKVI is available as a capsule and oral solution formulation. 
The mean absolute bioavailability of larotrectinib was 34% (range: 32% to 37%) following a single 
100 mg oral dose. In healthy adult subjects, the AUC of larotrectinib in the oral solution formulation 
was similar to the capsule, with Cmax 36% higher with the oral solution formulation. 
Larotrectinib Cmax was reduced by approximately 35% and there was no effect on AUC in healthy 
subjects administered VITRAKVI after a high-fat and high-calorie meal compared to the Cmax and 
AUC after overnight fasting. 
Effect of gastric pH-elevating agents on larotrectinib 
Larotrectinib has pH-dependent solubility. In vitro studies show that in liquid volumes relevant to the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract larotrectinib is fully soluble over entire pH range of the GI tract. Therefore, 
larotrectinib is unlikely to be affected by pH-modifying agents. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution of larotrectinib in healthy adult subjects was 48 L following 
intravenous administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose. Binding of 
larotrectinib to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 70% and was independent of drug 
concentration. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was approximately 0.9. 
Biotransformation 
Larotrectinib was metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4/5 in vitro. Following oral administration of 
a single 100 mg dose of radiolabelled larotrectinib to healthy adult subjects, unchanged larotrectinib 
(19%) and an O-glucuronide that is formed following loss of the hydroxypyrrolidine-urea moiety 
(26%) were the major circulating radioactive drug components. 
Elimination 
The half-life of larotrectinib in plasma of cancer patients given 100 mg twice daily of VITRAKVI was 
approximately 3 hours. Mean clearance (CL) of larotrectinib was approximately 34 L/h following 
intravenous administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of 
VITRAKVI. 
Excretion 
Following oral administration of 100 mg radiolabelled larotrectinib to healthy adult subjects, 58% of 
the administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 39% was recovered in urine and when an 
IV microtracer dose was given in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of larotrectinib, 35% of the 
administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 53% was recovered in urine. The fraction 
excreted as unchanged drug in urine was 29% following IV microtracer dose, indicating that direct 
renal excretion accounted for 29% of total clearance. 
Linearity / non-linearity 
The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) of larotrectinib after a single dose in healthy adult subjects were dose proportional up to 400 mg 
and slightly greater than proportional at doses of 600 to 900 mg. 
Special populations 
Paediatric patients 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, exposure (Cmax and AUC) in paediatric patients at the 
recommended dose of 100 mg/m2 with a maximum of 100 mg BID was higher than in adults 
(≥ 18 years of age) given the dose of 100 mg BID (see Table 8).  
Data defining exposure in small children (1 month to < 2 years of age) at the recommended dose is 
limited (n=40).

Patients with hepatic impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate 
(Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, and in healthy adult control subjects 
with normal hepatic function matched for age, body mass index and sex. All subjects received a single 
100 mg dose of larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib AUC0-inf was observed in subjects with mild, 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment of 1.3, 2 and 3.2-fold respectively versus those with normal 
hepatic function. Cmax was observed to increase slightly by 1.1, 1.1 and 1.5-fold respectively. 
Patients with renal impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis, 
and in healthy adult control subjects with normal renal function matched for age, body mass index and 
sex. All subjects received a single 100 mg dose of larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib Cmax and 
AUC0-inf, of 1.25 and 1.46-fold respectively was observed in renally impaired subjects versus those 
with normal renal function. 
Other special populations 
Gender did not appear to influence larotrectinib pharmacokinetics to a clinically significant extent. 
There was not enough data to investigate the potential influence of race on the systemic exposure of 
larotrectinib. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Systemic toxicity 
Systemic toxicity was assessed in studies with daily oral administration up to 3 months in rats and 
monkeys. Dose limiting skin lesions were only seen in rats and were primarily responsible for 
mortality and morbidity. Skin lesions were not seen in monkeys. 
Clinical signs of gastrointestinal toxicity were dose limiting in monkeys. In rats, severe toxicity 
(STD10) was observed at doses corresponding to 1- to 2-times the human AUC at the recommended 
clinical dose. No relevant systemic toxicity was observed in monkeys at doses which correspond to 
> 10-times the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Embryotoxicity / Teratogenicity  
Larotrectinib was not teratogenic and embryotoxic when dosed daily during the period of 
organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at maternotoxic doses, i.e. corresponding to 32-times (rats) 
and 16-times (rabbits) the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. Larotrectinib crosses the 
placenta in both species. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Fertility studies with larotrectinib have not been conducted. In 3-months toxicity studies, larotrectinib 
had no histological effect on the male reproductive organs in rats and monkeys at the highest tested 
doses corresponding to approximately 7-times (male rats) and 10-times (male monkeys) the human 
AUC at the recommended clinical dose. In addition, larotrectinib had no effect on spermatogenesis in 
rats. 
In a 1-month repeat-dose study in rats, fewer corpora lutea, increased incidence of anestrus and 
decreased uterine weight with uterine atrophy were observed and these effects were reversible. No 
effects on female reproductive organs were seen in the 3-months toxicity studies in rats and monkeys 
at doses corresponding to approximately 3-times (female rats) and 17-times (female monkeys) the 
human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. 
Larotrectinib was administered to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 to 70. Pre-weaning 
mortality (before PND 21) was observed at the high dose level corresponding to 2.5- to 4-times the 
AUC at the recommended dose. Growth and nervous system effects were seen at 0.5- to 4-times the 
AUC at the recommended dose. Body weight gain was decreased in pre-weaning male and female 
pups, with a post-weaning increase in females at the end of exposure whereas reduced body weight 
gain was seen in males also post-weaning without recovery. The male growth reduction was 
associated with delayed puberty. Nervous system effects (i.e. altered hindlimb functionality and, 
likely, increases in eyelid closure) demonstrated partial recovery. A decrease in pregnancy rate was 
also reported despite normal mating at the high-dose level. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with larotrectinib. 
Larotrectinib was not mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assays and in in vitro 
mammalian mutagenesis assays. Larotrectinib was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test at 
the maximum tolerated dose of 500 mg/kg. 
Safety pharmacology 
The safety pharmacology of larotrectinib was evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo studies that 
assessed effects on the CV, CNS, respiratory, and GI systems in various species. Larotrectinib had no 
adverse effect on haemodynamic parameters and ECG intervals in telemetered monkeys at exposures 
(Cmax) which are approximately 6-fold the human therapeutic exposures. Larotrectinib had no 
neurobehavioural findings in adult animals (rats, mice, cynomolgus monkeys) at exposure (Cmax) at 
least 7-fold higher than the human exposure. Larotrectinib had no effect on respiratory function in rats; 
at exposures (Cmax) at least 8-times the human therapeutic exposure. In rats, larotrectinib accelerated 
intestinal transit and increased gastric secretion and acidity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
VITRAKVI as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with solid 
tumours that display a Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase (NTRK) gene fusion, 
- 
who have a disease that is locally advanced, metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to 
result in severe morbidity, and 
who have no satisfactory treatment options (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
- 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with VITRAKVI should be initiated by physicians experienced in the administration of 
anticancer therapies. 
The presence of an NTRK gene fusion in a tumour specimen should be confirmed by a validated test 
prior to initiation of treatment with VITRAKVI. 
Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose in adults is 100 mg larotrectinib twice daily, until disease progression or until 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Paediatric population 
Dosing in paediatric patients is based on body surface area (BSA). The recommended dose in 
paediatric patients is 100 mg/m2 larotrectinib twice daily with a maximum of 100 mg per dose until 
disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the patient should not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed 
dose. Patients should take the next dose at the next scheduled time. If the patient vomits after taking a 
dose, the patient should not take an additional dose to make up for vomiting. 
Dose modification 
For all grade 2 adverse reactions, continued dosing may be appropriate, though close monitoring to 
ensure no worsening of the toxicity is advised. 
For all grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions not referring to liver function test abnormalities: 
- 
VITRAKVI should be withheld until the adverse reaction resolves or improves to baseline or 
grade 1. Resume at the next dose modification if resolution occurs within 4 weeks. 
VITRAKVI should be permanently discontinued if an adverse reaction does not resolve within 
4 weeks. 
- 
The recommended dose modifications for VITRAKVI for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1.

Recommended measures 
-  Conduct serial laboratory evaluations frequently after 
the observation of grade 2 toxicity, until resolved, to 
establish whether a dose interruption or reduction is 
required. 
-  Withhold treatment until the adverse reaction resolves 
or improves to baseline. Monitor liver function 
frequently until resolution or return to baseline. 
Permanently discontinue treatment if an adverse 
reaction does not resolve. 
Resume at the next dose modification if adverse 
reactions resolve. Treatment should only be resumed 
in patients where the benefit outweighs the risk. 
Permanently discontinue treatment if a grade 4 ALT 
and/or AST elevation occurs after resuming treatment. 
- 
- 
-  Withhold treatment and monitor liver function 
frequently until resolution or return to baseline. 
-  Consider permanent treatment discontinuation. 
- 
Treatment should only be resumed in patients where 
the benefit outweighs the risk. 
If resumed, start at the next lower dose. Monitor liver 
function frequently upon restart. 
Permanently discontinue treatment if adverse reaction 
recurs after resuming treatment.

Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is recommended in elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The starting dose of VITRAKVI should be reduced by 50% in patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) 
to severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with 
mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A) (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
If co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, the VITRAKVI dose should be 
reduced by 50%. After the inhibitor has been discontinued for 3 to 5 elimination half-lives, 
VITRAKVI should be resumed at the dose taken prior to initiating the CYP3A4 inhibitor (see 
section 4.5). 
Method of administration 
VITRAKVI is for oral use. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VITRAKVI is available as a capsule or oral solution with equivalent oral bioavailability and may be 
used interchangeably. 
The oral solution should be administered by mouth using an oral syringe of 1 mL or 5 mL volume or 
enterally by using a nasogastric feeding tube. 
- 
For doses below 1 mL a 1 mL oral syringe should be used. The calculated dose volume should 
be rounded to the nearest 0.1 mL. 
For doses of 1 mL and higher a 5 mL oral syringe should be used. The dose volume should be 
calculated to the nearest 0.2 mL. 
VITRAKVI should not be mixed with feeding formulas, if administered via nasogastric feeding 
tube. Mixing with the feeding formulas could lead to tube blockages. 
For instructions for use of oral syringes and feeding tubes see section 6.6. 
- 
- 
- 
The oral solution can be taken with or without food but should not be taken with grapefruit or 
grapefruit juice. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Efficacy across tumour types 
The benefit of VITRAKVI has been established in single arm trials encompassing a relatively small 
sample of patients whose tumours exhibit NTRK gene fusions. Favourable effects of VITRAKVI have 
been shown on the basis of overall response rate and response duration in a limited number of tumour 
types. The effect may be quantitatively different depending on tumour type, as well as on concomitant 
genetic alterations (see section 5.1). For these reasons, VITRAKVI should only be used if there are no 
treatment options for which clinical benefit has been established, or where such treatment options have 
been exhausted (i.e., no satisfactory treatment options). 
Neurologic reactions 
Neurologic reactions including dizziness, gait disturbance and paraesthesia were reported in patients 
receiving larotrectinib (see section 4.8). For the majority of neurologic reactions, onset occurred 
within the first three months of treatment. Withholding, reducing, or discontinuing VITRAKVI dosing 
should be considered, depending on the severity and persistence of these symptoms (see section 4.2). 
Hepatotoxicity 
Abnormalities of liver function tests including increased ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and 
bilirubin have been observed in patients receiving larotrectinib (see section 4.8). The majority of ALT 
and AST increases occurred within 3 months of starting treatment. Cases of hepatotoxicity with 
increases in ALT and/or AST of grade 2, 3 or 4 severity and increases in bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN have 
been reported in adult patients. 
In patients with hepatic transaminase elevations, withhold, modify dose or permanently discontinue 
VITRAKVI based on the severity (see section 4.2). 
Liver function including ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin should be monitored before the first dose, then 
every 2 weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly for the next 6 months of treatment, 
then periodically during treatment. In patients who develop transaminase elevations, more frequent 
testing is needed (see section 4.2). 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration with CYP3A4/P-gp inducers 
Avoid co-administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inducers with VITRAKVI due to a risk 
of decreased exposure (see section 4.5). 
Contraception in female and male 
Women of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception while taking VITRAKVI 
and for at least one month after stopping treatment (see sections 4.5 and 4.6).  
Males of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of childbearing potential should 
be advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one 
month after the final dose (see section 4.6). 
Important information about some of the ingredients 
Sodium benzoate: this medicinal product contains 2 mg per 1 mL. 
Sodium: this medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 5 mL, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effects of other agents on larotrectinib 
Effect of CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors on larotrectinib 
Larotrectinib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP). Co-administration of VITRAKVI with strong or moderate CYP3A 
inhibitors, P-gp and BCRP inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, troleandomycin, 
voriconazole or grapefruit) may increase larotrectinib plasma concentrations (see section 4.2). 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI 
dose with itraconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor and P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) 200 mg once daily 
for 7 days increased larotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 2.8-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively. 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI 
dose with a single dose of 600 mg rifampicin (a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor) increased larotrectinib Cmax 
and AUC by 1.8-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively. 
Effect of CYP3A and P-gp inducers on larotrectinib 
Co-administration of VITRAKVI with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers and strong P-gp inducers 
(e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin, or St. John’s Wort) may decrease 
larotrectinib plasma concentrations and should be avoided (see section 4.4). 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of a single 100 mg VITRAKVI 
dose with rifampicin (a strong CYP3A and P-gp inducer) 600 mg once daily for 11 days decreased 
larotrectinib Cmax and AUC by 71% and 81%, respectively. No clinical data is available on the effect 
of a moderate inducer, but a decrease in larotrectinib exposure is expected. 
Effects of larotrectinib on other agents 
Effect of larotrectinib on CYP3A substrates 
Clinical data in healthy adult subjects indicate that co-administration of VITRAKVI (100 mg twice 
daily for 10 days) increased the Cmax and AUC of oral midazolam 1.7-fold compared to midazolam 
alone, suggesting that larotrectinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. 
Exercise caution with concomitant use of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g. 
alfentanil, ciclosporin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or 
tacrolimus) in patients taking VITRAKVI. If concomitant use of these CYP3A substrates with narrow 
therapeutic range is required in patients taking VITRAKVI, dose reductions of the CYP3A substrates 
may be required due to adverse reactions. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect of larotrectinib on CYP2B6 substrates 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib induces CYP2B6. Co-administration of larotrectinib with 
CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion, efavirenz) may decrease their exposure. 
Effect of larotrectinib on other transporter substrates 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is an inhibitor of OATP1B1. No clinical studies have been 
performed to investigate interactions with OATP1B1 substrates. Therefore, it cannot be excluded 
whether co-administration of larotrectinib with OATP1B1 substrates (e.g. valsartan, statins) may 
increase their exposure. 
Effect of larotrectinib on substrates of PXR regulated enzymes 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is a weak inducer of PXR regulated enzymes (e.g. CYP2C 
family and UGT). Co-administration of larotrectinib with CYP2C8, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 substrates 
(e.g. repaglinide, warfarin, tolbutamide or omeprazole) may decrease their exposure. 
Hormonal contraceptives 
It is currently unknown whether larotrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting 
hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should 
be advised to add a barrier method. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Based on the mechanism of action, foetal harm cannot be excluded when administering larotrectinib to 
a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting 
treatment with VITRAKVI. 
Women of reproductive potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception during 
treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one month after the final dose. As it is currently unknown 
whether larotrectinib may reduce the effectiveness of systemically acting hormonal contraceptives, 
women using systemically acting hormonal contraceptives should be advised to add a barrier method. 
Males of reproductive potential with a non-pregnant woman partner of childbearing potential should 
be advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least one 
month after the final dose. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of larotrectinib in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of VITRAKVI during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether larotrectinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with VITRAKVI and for 3 days following the 
final dose. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data on the effect of larotrectinib on fertility. No relevant effects on fertility were 
observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive or use machines 
VITRAKVI has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness and fatigue 
have been reported in patients receiving larotrectinib, mostly grade 1 and 2 during the first 3 months of 
treatment. This may influence the ability to drive and use machines during this time period. Patients 
should be advised not to drive and use machines, until they are reasonably certain VITRAKVI therapy 
does not affect them adversely (see section 4.4). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most common adverse drug reactions (≥ 20%) of VITRAKVI in order of decreasing frequency 
were increased ALT (33%), increased AST (31%), vomiting (28%), anaemia (27%), constipation 
(27%), diarrhoea (25%), nausea (23%), fatigue (22%), and dizziness (20%). 
The majority of adverse reactions were grade 2 or 3. Grade 4 was the highest reported grade for 
adverse reactions neutrophil count decreased (2%), ALT increased, AST increased, leukocyte count 
decreased, platelet count decreased, muscular weakness and blood alkaline phosphatase increased 
(each in < 1%). The highest reported grade was grade 3 for adverse reactions anaemia (7%), weight 
increased (4%), diarrhoea (3%), gait disturbance (1%), and fatigue, dizziness, paraesthesia, nausea, 
myalgia,  and vomiting (each in < 1%). 
Permanent discontinuation of VITRAKVI for treatment emergent adverse reactions occurred in 2% of 
patients (2 cases of neutrophil count decreased, 1 case each of ALT increased, AST increased, gait 
disturbance, vomiting, muscular weakness, fatigue, and nausea). The majority of adverse reactions 
leading to dose reduction occurred in the first three months of treatment. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of VITRAKVI was evaluated in 335 patients with TRK fusion-positive cancer in one of 
three on-going clinical trials, Studies 1, 2 (“NAVIGATE”), and 3 (“SCOUT”) and post-marketing. 
The safety population characteristics were comprised of patients with a median age of 39.0 years 
(range: 0.1, 90) with 37% of patients being paediatric patients. Median time on treatment for the 
overall safety population (n=335) was 14.5 months (range: 0.0, 75.2). 
The adverse drug reactions reported in patients (n=335) treated with VITRAKVI are shown in Table 3 
and Table 4. 
The adverse drug reactions are classified according to the System Organ Class. 
Frequency groups are defined by the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 
to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), 
and not known (cannot be estimated from available data). 
Within each frequency group, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neurologic reactions 
In the overall safety database (n=335), the maximum grade neurologic adverse reaction observed was 
grade 3 or 4 which was observed in 10 (3%) patients and included gait disturbance (4 patients, 1%), 
dizziness (3 patients, <1%), and paraesthesia (3 patients, <1%). The overall incidence was 20% for 
dizziness, 7% for paraesthesia and 5% for gait disturbance. Neurologic reactions leading to dose 
modification or interruptions included dizziness (<1%) and paraesthesia (<1%). One patient 
permanently discontinued the treatment due to grade 3 gait disturbance. In all cases except of one, 
patients with evidence of anti-tumour activity who required a dose reduction were able to continue 
dosing at a reduced dose and/or schedule (see section 4.4). 
Hepatotoxicity 
Abnormalities of liver function tests including ALT, AST, ALP and bilirubin have been observed in 
patients treated with VITRAKVI. 
In the overall safety database (n=335), the maximum grade transaminase elevation observed was 
grade 4 ALT increase in 6 patients (2%) and AST increase in 3 patients (1%). Grade 3 ALT and AST 
increases in 17 (5%) and 16 (5%) of patients, respectively. Majority of grade 3 elevations were 
transient appearing in the first three months of treatment and resolving to grade 1 by months 3-4. 
Grade 2 ALT and AST increases were observed in 34 (10%) and 32 (10%) of patients, respectively, 
and grade 1 ALT and AST increases were observed in 157 (47%) and 158 (47%) of patients, 
respectively. 
ALT and AST increases leading to dose modifications or interruptions occurred in 13 (5%) patients 
and 12 (5%) patients, respectively (see section 4.4). One patient permanently discontinued the 
treatment due to grade 3-4 ALT and AST increases. 
Cases of hepatotoxicity with increases in ALT and/or AST of grade 2, 3 or 4 severity and increases in 
bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN have been reported in adult patients. In some cases, the dose of VITRAKVI was 
withheld and restarted at a reduced dose, while in other cases treatment was permanently discontinued 
(see section 4.4). 
Additional information on special populations  
Paediatric patients 
Of the 335 patients treated with VITRAKVI, 124 (37%) patients were from birth to < 18 years of age 
(n=13 from birth to < 3 months, n=4 ≥ 3 months to < 6 months, n=17 ≥ 6 months to < 12 months, n=8 
≥ 12 months to < 2 years, n=27 ≥ 2 years to < 6 years, n=32 ≥ 6 years to < 12 years, n=23 ≥ 12 years 
to < 18 years). The majority of adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 in severity and were resolved 
without VITRAKVI dose modification or discontinuation. Adverse reactions of grade 3 or 4 in 
severity were generally observed more frequently in patients < 6 years of age. They were reported in 
69% of patients from birth to < 3 months and in 48% of patients ≥ 3 months to < 6 years. Decreased 
neutrophil count has been reported to have led to study drug discontinuation, dose modification and 
dose interruption. 
Elderly 
Of the 335 patients in the overall safety population who received VITRAKVI, 65 (19%) patients were 
65 years or older and 20 (6%) patients were 75 years or older. The safety profile in elderly patients 
(≥ 65 years) is consistent with that seen in younger patients. The adverse reaction dizziness (32% 
versus 28% in all adults), anaemia (32% versus 25% in all adults), muscular weakness (14% versus 
11% in all adults), and gait disturbance (8% versus 5% in all adults) were more frequent in patients of 
65 years or older.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is limited experience of overdose with VITRAKVI. Symptoms of overdose are not established. 
In the event of overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and treat 
symptomatically.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, antineoplastic agents, 
protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EX12. 
Mechanism of action 
Larotrectinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive and selective tropomyosin receptor 
kinase (TRK) inhibitor that was rationally designed to avoid activity with off-target kinases. The target 
for larotrectinib is the TRK family of proteins inclusive of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC that are encoded 
by NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, respectively. In a broad panel of purified enzyme assays, 
larotrectinib inhibited TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC with IC50 values between 5-11 nM. The only other 
kinase activity occurred at 100-fold higher concentrations. In in vitro and in vivo tumour models, 
larotrectinib demonstrated anti-tumour activity in cells with constitutive activation of TRK proteins 
resulting from gene fusions, deletion of a protein regulatory domain, or in cells with TRK protein 
overexpression. 
In-frame gene fusion events resulting from chromosomal rearrangements of the human genes NTRK1, 
NTRK2, and NTRK3 lead to the formation of oncogenic TRK fusion proteins. These resultant novel 
chimeric oncogenic proteins are aberrantly expressed, driving constitutive kinase activity subsequently 
activating downstream cell signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival leading to 
TRK fusion-positive cancer. 
Acquired resistance mutations after progression on TRK inhibitors have been observed. Larotrectinib 
had minimal activity in cell lines with point mutations in the TRKA kinase domain, including the 
clinically identified acquired resistance mutation, G595R. Point mutations in the TRKC kinase domain 
with clinically identified acquired resistance to larotrectinib include G623R, G696A, and F617L. 
The molecular causes for primary resistance to larotrectinib are not known. It is therefore not known if 
the presence of a concomitant oncogenic driver in addition to an NTRK gene fusion affects the efficacy 
of TRK inhibition. The measured impact of any concomitant genomic alterations on larotrectinib 
efficacy is provided below (see clinical efficacy).

Pharmacodynamic effect 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
In 36 healthy adult subjects receiving single doses ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg, VITRAKVI did 
not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 
The 200 mg dose corresponds to a peak exposure (Cmax) similar to that observed with larotrectinib 
100 mg BID at steady state. A shortening of QTcF was observed with VITRAKVI dosing, with a 
maximum mean effect observed between 3 and 24 hours after Cmax, with a geometric mean decrease in 
QTcF from baseline of -13.2 msec (range -10 to -15.6 msec). Clinical relevance of this finding has not 
been established.  
Clinical efficacy 
Overview of studies 
The efficacy and safety of VITRAKVI were studied in three multicentre, open-label, single-arm 
clinical studies in adult and paediatric cancer patients (Table 5). The studies are still ongoing. 
Patients with and without documented NTRK gene fusion were allowed to participate in Study 1 and 
Study 3 (“SCOUT”). Patients enrolled to Study 2 (“NAVIGATE”) were required to have TRK 
fusion-positive cancer. The pooled primary analysis set of efficacy includes 272 patients with TRK 
fusion-positive cancer enrolled across the three studies that had measurable disease assessed by 
RECIST v1.1, a non-CNS primary tumour and received at least one dose of larotrectinib as of 
July 2022. These patients were required to have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their 
tumour type and stage of disease or who, in the opinion of the investigator, would have had to undergo 
radical surgery (such as limb amputation, facial resection, or paralysis causing procedure), or were 
unlikely to tolerate, or derive clinically meaningful benefit from available standard of care therapies in 
the advanced disease setting. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) 
and duration of response (DOR), as determined by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC). 
In addition, 41 patients with primary CNS tumours and measurable disease at baseline were treated in 
Study 2 (“NAVIGATE”) and in Study 3 (“SCOUT”). Forty of the 41 primary CNS tumour patients 
had received prior cancer treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and/or previous systemic therapy). Tumour 
responses were assessed by the investigator using RANO or RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
Identification of NTRK gene fusions relied on tissue samples for the molecular test methods: next 
generation sequencing (NGS) used in 276 patients, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used in 
14 patients, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) used in 18 patients, and other testing methods 
(Sequencing, Nanostring, Sanger sequencing, or Chromosome Microarray) used in 5 patients.

thyroid cancer (11%), lung cancer (10%), and salivary gland tumour (9%). 
Baseline characteristics for the 41 patients with primary CNS tumours with an NTRK gene fusion 
assessed by investigator were as follows: median age 11 years (range 1-79 years); 28 patients 
< 18 years of age, and 13 patients ≥ 18 years, and 28 patients white and 20 patients male; and ECOG 
PS 0-1 (36 patients), or 2 (4 patients). Forty (98%) patients had received prior treatment for their

tumour type. The ORR in the total population may not reflect the expected response in a specific 
tumour type. 
In the adult sub-population (n=178), the ORR was 58%. In the paediatric sub-population (n=94), the 
ORR was 84%. 
In 238 patients with wide molecular characterisation before larotrectinib treatment, the ORR in 
128 patients who had other genomic alterations in addition to NTRK gene fusion was 52%, and in 
110 patients without other genomic alterations ORR was 76%. 
Pooled primary analysis set 
The pooled primary analysis set consisted of 272 patients and did not include primary CNS tumours. 
Median time on treatment before disease progression was 19.6 months (range: 0.10 to 75.2 months) 
based on July 2022 cut-off. Fifty-seven percent of patients had received VITRAKVI for 12 months or 
more, 34% had received VITRAKVI 24 months or more, and 21% had received VITRAKVI 
36 months or more, with follow-up ongoing at the time of the analysis. 
At the time of analysis, the median duration of response is 43.3 months (range: 0.0+ to 65.4+), an 
estimated 80% [95% CI: 74, 86] of responses lasted 12 months or longer, 66% [95% CI: 58, 74] of 
responses lasted 24 months or longer, and 51% [95% CI: 42, 60] of responses lasted 36 months or 
longer. Eighty-six percent (86%) [95% CI: 82, 90] of patients treated were alive one year after the start 
of therapy, 77% [95% CI: 72, 82] after two years after the start of therapy, and 72% [95% CI: 66, 78] 
after three years with the median for overall survival not yet being reached. Median progression free 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
survival was 30.8 months at the time of the analysis, with a progression free survival rate of 65% [95% 
CI: 59, 71] after 1 year, 56% [95% CI: 49, 62] after 2 years, and 43% [95% CI: 36, 50] after 3 years. 
The median change in tumour size in the pooled primary analysis set was a decrease of 79%. 
Patients with primary CNS tumours 
At the time of data cut-off, of the 41 patients with primary CNS tumours confirmed response was 
observed in 9 patients (22%) with 1 of the 41 patients (2%) being complete responders and 8 patients 
(20%) being partial responders. Further 20 patients (49%) had stable disease. Twelve patients (29%) 
had progressive disease. At the time of data cut-off, time on treatment ranged from 1.7 to 50.9 months 
and was ongoing in 13 out of 41 patients, with one of these patients receiving post-progression 
treatment. 
Conditional approval 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In cancer patients given VITRAKVI capsules, peak plasma levels (Cmax) of larotrectinib were achieved 
at approximately 1 hour after dosing. Half-life (t½) is approximately 3 hours and steady state is reached 
within 8 days with a systemic accumulation of 1.6 fold. At the recommended dose of 100 mg taken 
twice daily, steady-state arithmetic mean (± standard deviation) Cmax and daily AUC in adults were 
914 ± 445 ng/mL and 5410 ± 3813 ng*h/mL, respectively. In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib is 
not a substrate for either OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations and is unlikely to affect clearance of 
substrates of these CYPs. 
In vitro studies indicate that larotrectinib does not inhibit the transporters BCRP, P-gp, OAT1, OAT3, 
OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B3, BSEP, MATE1 and MATE2-K at clinically relevant concentrations and is 
unlikely to affect clearance of substrates of these transporters. 
Absorption 
VITRAKVI is available as a capsule and oral solution formulation. 
The mean absolute bioavailability of larotrectinib was 34% (range: 32% to 37%) following a single 
100 mg oral dose. In healthy adult subjects, the AUC of larotrectinib in the oral solution formulation 
was similar to the capsule, with Cmax 36% higher with the oral solution formulation. 
Larotrectinib Cmax was reduced by approximately 35% and there was no effect on AUC in healthy 
subjects administered VITRAKVI after a high-fat and high-calorie meal compared to the Cmax and 
AUC after overnight fasting. 
Effect of gastric pH-elevating agents on larotrectinib 
Larotrectinib has pH-dependent solubility. In vitro studies show that in liquid volumes relevant to the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract larotrectinib is fully soluble over entire pH range of the GI tract. Therefore, 
larotrectinib is unlikely to be affected by pH-modifying agents. 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution of larotrectinib in healthy adult subjects was 48 L following 
intravenous administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose. Binding of 
larotrectinib to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 70% and was independent of drug 
concentration. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was approximately 0.9. 
Biotransformation 
Larotrectinib was metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4/5 in vitro. Following oral administration of 
a single 100 mg dose of radiolabelled larotrectinib to healthy adult subjects, unchanged larotrectinib 
(19%) and an O-glucuronide that is formed following loss of the hydroxypyrrolidine-urea moiety 
(26%) were the major circulating radioactive drug components. 
Elimination 
The half-life of larotrectinib in plasma of cancer patients given 100 mg twice daily of VITRAKVI was 
approximately 3 hours. Mean clearance (CL) of larotrectinib was approximately 34 L/h following 
intravenous administration of an IV microtracer in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of 
VITRAKVI. 
Excretion 
Following oral administration of 100 mg radiolabelled larotrectinib to healthy adult subjects, 58% of 
the administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 39% was recovered in urine and when an 
IV microtracer dose was given in conjunction with a 100 mg oral dose of larotrectinib, 35% of the 
administered radioactivity was recovered in faeces and 53% was recovered in urine. The fraction 
excreted as unchanged drug in urine was 29% following IV microtracer dose, indicating that direct 
renal excretion accounted for 29% of total clearance. 
Linearity / non-linearity 
The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) of larotrectinib after a single dose in healthy adult subjects were dose proportional up to 400 mg 
and slightly greater than proportional at doses of 600 to 900 mg. 
Special populations 
Paediatric patients 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, exposure (Cmax and AUC) in paediatric patients at the 
recommended dose of 100 mg/m2 with a maximum of 100 mg BID was higher than in adults 
(≥ 18 years of age) given the dose of 100 mg BID (see Table 8). 
Data defining exposure in small children (1 month to < 2 years of age) at the recommended dose is 
limited (n=40).

Patients with hepatic impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate 
(Child-Pugh B) and severe (Child-Pugh C) hepatic impairment, and in healthy adult control subjects 
with normal hepatic function matched for age, body mass index and sex. All subjects received a single 
100 mg dose of larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib AUC0-inf was observed in subjects with mild, 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment of 1.3, 2 and 3.2-fold respectively versus those with normal 
hepatic function. Cmax was observed to increase slightly by 1.1, 1.1 and 1.5-fold respectively. 
Patients with renal impairment 
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in subjects with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis, 
and in healthy adult control subjects with normal renal function matched for age, body mass index and 
sex. All subjects received a single 100 mg dose of larotrectinib. An increase in larotrectinib Cmax and 
AUC0-inf, of 1.25 and 1.46-fold respectively was observed in renally impaired subjects versus those 
with normal renal function. 
Other special populations 
Gender did not appear to influence larotrectinib pharmacokinetics to a clinically significant extent. 
There was not enough data to investigate the potential influence of race on the systemic exposure of 
larotrectinib. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Systemic toxicity 
Systemic toxicity was assessed in studies with daily oral administration up to 3 months in rats and 
monkeys. Dose limiting skin lesions were only seen in rats and were primarily responsible for 
mortality and morbidity. Skin lesions were not seen in monkeys. 
Clinical signs of gastrointestinal toxicity were dose limiting in monkeys. In rats, severe toxicity 
(STD10) was observed at doses corresponding to 1- to 2-times the human AUC at the recommended 
clinical dose. No relevant systemic toxicity was observed in monkeys at doses which correspond to 
> 10-times the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Embryotoxicity / Teratogenicity  
Larotrectinib was not teratogenic and embryotoxic when dosed daily during the period of 
organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at maternotoxic doses, i.e. corresponding to 32-times (rats) 
and 16-times (rabbits) the human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. Larotrectinib crosses the 
placenta in both species. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Fertility studies with larotrectinib have not been conducted. In 3-months toxicity studies, larotrectinib 
had no histological effect on the male reproductive organs in rats and monkeys at the highest tested 
doses corresponding to approximately 7-times (male rats) and 10-times (male monkeys) the human 
AUC at the recommended clinical dose. In addition, larotrectinib had no effect on spermatogenesis in 
rats. 
In a 1-month repeat-dose study in rats, fewer corpora lutea, increased incidence of anestrus and 
decreased uterine weight with uterine atrophy were observed and these effects were reversible. No 
effects on female reproductive organs were seen in the 3-months toxicity studies in rats and monkeys 
at doses corresponding to approximately 3-times (female rats) and 17-times (female monkeys) the 
human AUC at the recommended clinical dose. 
Larotrectinib was administered to juvenile rats from postnatal day (PND) 7 to 70. Pre-weaning 
mortality (before PND 21) was observed at the high dose level corresponding to 2.5- to 4-times the 
AUC at the recommended dose. Growth and nervous system effects were seen at 0.5- to 4-times the 
AUC at the recommended dose. Body weight gain was decreased in pre-weaning male and female 
pups, with a post-weaning increase in females at the end of exposure whereas reduced body weight 
gain was seen in males also post-weaning without recovery. The male growth reduction was 
associated with delayed puberty. Nervous system effects (i.e. altered hindlimb functionality and, 
likely, increases in eyelid closure) demonstrated partial recovery. A decrease in pregnancy rate was 
also reported despite normal mating at the high-dose level. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with larotrectinib. 
Larotrectinib was not mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assays and in in vitro 
mammalian mutagenesis assays. Larotrectinib was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test at 
the maximum tolerated dose of 500 mg/kg. 
Safety pharmacology 
The safety pharmacology of larotrectinib was evaluated in several in vitro and in vivo studies that 
assessed effects on the CV, CNS, respiratory, and GI systems in various species. Larotrectinib had no 
adverse effect on haemodynamic parameters and ECG intervals in telemetered monkeys at exposures 
(Cmax) which are approximately 6-fold the human therapeutic exposures. Larotrectinib had no 
neurobehavioural findings in adult animals (rats, mice, cynomolgus monkeys) at exposure (Cmax) at 
least 7-fold higher than the human exposure. Larotrectinib had no effect on respiratory function in rats; 
at exposures (Cmax) at least 8-times the human therapeutic exposure. In rats, larotrectinib accelerated 
intestinal transit and increased gastric secretion and acidity.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What VITRAKVI is and what it is used for 
What VITRAKVI is used for 
VITRAKVI contains the active substance larotrectinib.  
It is used in adults, adolescents and children to treat solid tumours (cancer) in various parts of the body 
that are caused by a change in the NTRK gene (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase). 
VITRAKVI is only used when 
- 
these cancers are advanced or have spread to other parts of the body or if a surgery to remove 
the cancer is likely to cause severe complications and 
there are no satisfactory treatment options. 
- 
Before you are given VITRAKVI, your doctor will do a test to check if you have the change in the 
NTRK gene. 
How VITRAKVI works 
In patients whose cancer is due to an altered NTRK gene, the change in the gene causes the body to 
make an abnormal protein called TRK fusion protein, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and 
cancer. VITRAKVI blocks the action of TRK fusion proteins and so may slow or stop the growth of 
the cancer. It may also help to shrink the cancer. 
If you have any questions on how VITRAKVI works or why it has been prescribed for you, ask your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take VITRAKVI 
Do not take VITRAKVI if 
- 
you are allergic to larotrectinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Tests and checks 
VITRAKVI can increase the amount of the liver enzymes ALT and AST and bilirubin in your blood. 
Your doctor will do blood tests before and during treatment to check the level of ALT, AST and 
bilirubin and check how well your liver is working. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Other medicines and VITRAKVI 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This is because some medicines may affect the way VITRAKVI works or VITRAKVI may 
affect how other medicines work.

-

If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Taking VITRAKVI with food and drink 
Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while taking VITRAKVI. This is because it may 
increase the amount of VITRAKVI in your body. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
You should not use VITRAKVI during pregnancy since the effect of VITRAKVI on the unborn is not 
known. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed while taking this medicine and for 3 days after the last dose. This is because it is 
not known if VITRAKVI passes into breast milk. 
89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contraception – for men and women 
You should avoid getting pregnant while taking this medicine. 
If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor should do a pregnancy test before you start treatment. 
You must use effective methods of contraception while taking VITRAKVI and for at least 1 month 
after the last dose, if  
- 
you are able to become pregnant. If you use hormonal contraceptives, you should also use a 
barrier method, such as a condom. 
- 
you have sex with a woman able to become pregnant. 
Ask your doctor about the best method of contraception for you.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What VITRAKVI is and what it is used for 
What VITRAKVI is used for 
VITRAKVI contains the active substance larotrectinib.  
It is used in adults, adolescents and children to treat solid tumours (cancer) in various parts of the body 
that are caused by a change in the NTRK gene (neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase). 
VITRAKVI is only used when 
- 
these cancers are advanced or have spread to other parts of the body or if a surgery to remove 
the cancer is likely to cause severe complications and 
there are no satisfactory treatment options. 
- 
Before you are given VITRAKVI, your doctor will do a test to check if you have the change in the 
NTRK gene. 
How VITRAKVI works 
In patients whose cancer is due to an altered NTRK gene, the change in the gene causes the body to 
make an abnormal protein called TRK fusion protein, which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and 
cancer. VITRAKVI blocks the action of TRK fusion proteins and so may slow or stop the growth of 
the cancer. It may also help to shrink the cancer. 
If you have any questions on how VITRAKVI works or why it has been prescribed for you, ask your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

2.  What you need to know before you take VITRAKVI 
Do not take VITRAKVI if 
- 
you are allergic to larotrectinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
Tests and checks 
VITRAKVI can increase the amount of the liver enzymes ALT and AST and bilirubin in your blood. 
Your doctor will do blood tests before and during treatment to check the level of ALT, AST and 
bilirubin and check how well your liver is working.

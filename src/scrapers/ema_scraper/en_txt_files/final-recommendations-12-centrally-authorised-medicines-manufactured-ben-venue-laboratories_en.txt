Final recommendations on 12 centrally authorised 
medicines manufactured at Ben Venue Laboratories 
The European Medicines Agency has completed a review of 12 out of 14 centrally authorised medicines 
manufactured at Ben Venue Laboratories, Ohio, USA (Angiox, Busilvex, Vidaza, Vistide, Velcade, Ecalta 
diluent, Soliris, Cayston, Luminity, Mepact, Torisel and Vibativ)2, initiated following shortcomings in 
quality assurance identified at this site. The Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP) has recommended suspending the marketing authorisations for Vibativ and Luminity until a 
suitable manufacturing site is approved. For the remaining 10 medicines, the CHMP recommended 
maintaining the marketing authorisations as alternative suppliers or formulations are available. The 
review of the two other centrally authorised medicines manufactured at this site, Caelyx and Ceplene, 
is still ongoing. 
Why were these medicines reviewed? 
A good manufacturing practice (GMP) inspection of Ben Venue in November 20113 highlighted several 
shortcomings in the quality management system in place at Ben Venue, particularly in relation to the 
sterile filling process and possible particle contamination during the manufacturing process. During the 
inspection, Ben Venue decided to cease all manufacture and distribution of medicines from its site. 
Consequently, on 18 November 2011 the European Commission asked the CHMP to assess the impact 
of these shortcomings on the quality and safety of medicines produced at Ben Venue, and to issue an 
opinion on whether the marketing authorisation for these medicines should be maintained, varied, 
suspended or withdrawn across the EU.

*2Previously it was stated incorrectly that for Vistide and Cayston, Ben Venue Laboratories, Ohio had already been removed 
as the manufacturing site from the marketing authorisation.

3 The November 2011 inspection of the Ben Venue Laboratories manufacturing site conducted by the Medicines and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits de Santé 
(AFSSAPS) jointly with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was a follow-up to a previous inspection conducted in 
March 2011 that had been triggered by the European Medicines Agency as part of a re-inspection program. This inspection 
had already led to the restriction in the importation of some medicines to the EU from the Ben Venue site.

What actions have been taken so far? 
The CHMP assessed the causes and impact of the possible particle contamination and the sterility 
assurance problem. Given the potential risks identified, the CHMP issued interim recommendations in 
November4 and December 20115 recommending that only products that are absolutely essential for 
patients’ needs and for which no alternative supplier or formulation is available should continue to be 
used.  
In addition, on 13 January 2012, the UK’s medicines regulatory agency (MHRA) on behalf of the 
European regulatory network issued a restricted GMP certificate to Ben Venue in order to stop the EU 
supply of non-essential medicines from Ben Venue, while allowing the continued supply of essential 
medicines. 
What are the final recommendations of the CHMP? 
The CHMP has now finalised the assessment for 12 medicines produced at Ben Venue and is 
recommending the following:  
 
The suspension of the marketing authorisations for Vibativ and Luminity, which are currently not 
marketed in the EU and for which no alternative manufacturer or formulation is available. The 
suspension will remain in place until the company obtains approval for a GMP compliant alternative 
manufacturing site.  
 
The maintenance of the marketing authorisations with conditions for Busilvex, Vidaza, Vistide,   
Velcade, Ecalta diluent, Soliris, Cayston, Mepact, Torisel and Angiox, for which alternative 
manufacturers are supplying the EU market or alternative formulations6 are available. All 
companies involved are required to submit an application to remove Ben Venue as a manufacturing 
site for these medicines.  
The reviews of Caelyx and Ceplene are currently being finalised. The Agency will communicate on their 
outcome in the near future. The interim recommendations that were issued in November4 and 
December 20115 for these medicines remain valid. 
What are the recommendations to healthcare professionals and patients? 
Angiox, Busilvex, Mepact, Vidaza, Vistide, Velcade, Ecalta, Soliris, Torisel and Cayston should continue 
to be prescribed as normal.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
This application is in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with specific risk 
factors.  
COPD is defined as “a common preventable and treatable disease that is characterised by persistent 
respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually 
caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases”  according to the Global Initiative for Chronic 
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) document (updated in 2017) (GOLD 2017). 
COPD is a major public health problem and is the fourth leading cause of death in the world, with increasing 
prevalence and mortality predicted in the coming decades. COPD is projected to be the third leading cause of 
death by 2020.  
The  chronic  airflow  limitation  that  is  characteristic  of  COPD  is  caused  by  a  mixture  of  small  airway  disease 
(e.g.  obstructive  bronchiolitis)  and  parenchymal  destruction  (emphysema).  The  relative  contributions  vary 
from  person  to  person  and  evolve  at  different  rates  over  time.  Chronic  inflammation  causes  structural 
changes,  narrowing  of  the  small  airways  and  destruction  of  the  lung  parenchyma  leading  to  the  loss  of 
alveolar attachments to the small airways and decreased lung elastic recoil. 
The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoking. However, other environmental exposures such as biomass 
fuel exposure and air pollution may also contribute. Host factors (e.g. genetic abnormalities, abnormal lung 
function and accelerated aging) predispose individuals to develop COPD. 
COPD  is  characterised  by  cough,  dyspnoea  on  exertion  or  even  at  rest,  with  a  consequent  reduction  of 
physical  activity  and  deterioration  of  quality  of  life  (QoL)  (GOLD  2016).  The  inflammatory  response 
contributes to small airways disease (e.g. obliterative bronchiolitis) and emphysema, which in turn reduce the 
elastic recoil of the lungs leading to collapse and obstruction of the small airways during exhalation. Systemic 
features  of  COPD  are  very  common  (Barnes  PJ  and  Celli  BR  2009)  and  their  evaluation  allows  a  more 
accurate prediction of mortality risk and comorbidity risk than lung  function alone (Cote CG et al. 2007, De 
Torres JP et al. 2009, Puhan MA et al. 2009). 
During  the  natural  course  of  COPD,  the  majority  of  patients  develop  acute  episodes  of  worsening  of 
symptoms that differ from the day to day variations, and may require modifications in therapy (GOLD 2016). 
These  episodes  are  referred  to  as  exacerbations.  COPD  exacerbations  are  important  because  they  are 
associated  with  accelerated  FEV1  decline  (Donaldson  GC  et  al.  2002),  significant  morbidity,  healthcare  cost 
and mortality (Celli BR and Barnes PJ 2007). 
According  to  the  GOLD  document,  the  assessment  of  the  disease  severity  should  take  into  account  various 
aspects  of  the  disease  such  as  symptoms,  degree  of  airflow  limitation,  exacerbation  risk  and  comorbidities. 
Based on the overall disease severity, COPD patients can be divided into the following four groups: 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 9/90 
  
  
 
 
•  Group  A  (i.e.  patients  with  low  risk  [of  future  events  such  as  exacerbations,  hospital  admissions  or 
death] and less symptoms); 
•  Group B (i.e. patients with low risk and more symptoms); 
•  Group C (i.e. patients with high risk and less symptoms); 
•  Group D (i.e. patients with high risk and more symptoms). 
In  COPD,  the  therapeutic  goal  is  to  reduce  symptoms,  reduce  the  frequency  and  severity  of  exacerbations 
and improve health status and exercise tolerance (GOLD 2016). The mainstay of treatment for symptomatic 
relief  in  stable  COPD  are  bronchodilators  and,  as  the  disease  worsens,  ICS  and  phosphodiesterase  4-
inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents are recommended in combination with long acting bronchodilators. 
The main classes of bronchodilators used in COPD are β2 agonist and anticholinergic agents. β2 agonists lead 
to relaxation and bronchodilation by stimulating the β2-adrenoreceptor on the airway smooth muscle. Short 
acting  β2  agonists  (SABAs;  e.g.  salbutamol  and  fenoterol)  are  used  for  acute  bronchodilation  and  relief  of 
symptoms. LABAs (e.g. salmeterol, FF and indacaterol) exhibit a prolonged duration of effect of 12 hours or 
more,  and  are  used  to  achieve  more  sustained  symptom  control.  Anti  cholinergics  (e.g.  the  short-acting 
ipratropium  bromide,  and  the  long-acting  GB  and  Tiotropium)  exert  their  effect  by  blocking  the  effect  of 
acetylcholine on the muscarinic receptors on the airway smooth muscles. 
ICS treatment reduces the inflammation associated with COPD. When compared to placebo, long term use of 
ICS  reduces  the  mean  rate  of  exacerbations  and  slows  the  decline in  QoL,  as measured  by  the  St  George's 
Respiratory  Questionnaire  (SGRQ).  Response  to  ICS  is  not  predicted  by  bronchodilator  reversibility  or 
bronchial hyper-responsiveness. 
Although up to 20% of patients with moderate airflow limitation may experience frequent exacerbations, the 
risk  of  exacerbations  significantly  increases  in  patients  with  severe  and  very  severe  airflow  limitation.  In 
COPD  patients  from  Groups  C  and  D  (i.e.  with  high  risk  of  exacerbation  and  with  less  or  more  symptoms, 
respectively),  a  fixed  combination  of  ICS  with  a  LABA  or  a  LAMA  alone  is  recommended  as  first  choice  of 
treatment (GOLD 2016). 
When patients remain symptomatic with these therapies, the combination of all three classes (ICS, LABA and 
LAMA)  is  recommended.  Furthermore,  several  studies  have  shown  that  triple  therapies  consisting  of  two 
bronchodilators  (such  as  a  combination  LABA  and  LAMA)  and  an  ICS  resulted  in  better  efficacy  in  terms  of 
lung  function  improvement  and  symptom  control  compared  to  bronchodilator  monotherapies  or  ICS/LABA 
FDC (Singh D et al. 2008, Aaron SD et al. 2007, Welte T et al. 2009, Short PM et al. 2012). This enhanced 
effect is due to the fact that ICS, LABA and LAMA work together either synergistically or additively. 
The mechanism of action of CHF 5993 pMDI includes both the bronchodilatory and anti inflammatory action 
mentioned  above.  In  CHF  5993  pMDI,  both  FF  and  GB  induce  bronchodilation,  which  is  central  for  the 
symptomatic  treatment  of  COPD.  Alongside  airflow  limitation,  inflammation  also  plays  a  role  in  the 
pathophysiology of COPD. The effects of corticosteroids on the inflammatory pathway of COPD are subject of 
ongoing  debate.  However,  when  used  in  combination,  ICSs  such  as  BDP  may  increase  the  number  of  β2-
adrenoceptors  while  β2-agonists  may  induce  glucocorticoid  receptor  nuclear  translocation  and  therefore 
provide an additive/synergistic effect.  
International documents and guidelines (e.g. GOLD2016) recommend the use of free (i.e. extemporary using 
different inhalers) triple combinations of ICS, LABA and LAMA for the treatment of severe and symptomatic 
COPD patients.

About the product 
TRIMBOW (hereafter referred to as CHF 5993) is a novel triple combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), 
a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). The product is a fixed dose 
combination  of  beclometasone  dipropionate  (BDP),  formoterol  fumarate  (FF)  and  glycopyrronium  bromide 
(GB)  intended  for  oral  inhalation.  Trimbow  is  formulated  as  a  hydroxyfluoroalkane  (HFA)  solution  to  be 
delivered via a pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) with a nominal dose per actuation of BDP, FF and GB 
of 100 µg, 6 µg and 12.5 µg, respectively.  
A FDC consisting of BDP 100 µg and FF 6 µg (Foster and related names, also referred to as CHF 1535) has 
been developed by the applicant. CHF 1535 pMDI has been nationally approved in Europe first in asthma in 
2006 and then, in 2014 via a Type II variation in COPD. 
The inhalers used for CHF 5993 pMDI and for CHF 1535 pMDI are similar. 
The  formulation  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  was  developed  with  a  high  extrafine  inhaled  particle  fraction  (i.e.  mass 
median  aerodynamic  diameter  [MMAD]  around  1.1  µm),  similar  to  that  of  CHF  1535  pMDI.  The  extrafine 
formulation allows a reduction to about half the equivalent dose of a conventional BDP aerosol. 
GB  inhalation  powder  has  been  approved  in  2012  in  Europe  for  maintenance  bronchodilator  treatment  to 
relieve symptoms in adult patients with COPD. To support the development of CHF 5993 pMDI, the applicant 
has  developed  a  GB  pMDI  as  a  single  agent,  although  the  applicant  does  not  intend  to  seek  a  marketing 
authorisation for this product in COPD and therefore did not perform a full clinical development. The proposed 
indication is: 
Trimbow is indicated for the symptomatic treatment and reduction of exacerbations in adult patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with airflow limitation (FEV1 < 50% predicted normal) and 
who are at risk of exacerbations 
-despite regular therapy with both inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators, or with bronchodilators alone; 
or 
-eligible for treatment with inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2-agonists and long-acting muscarinic 
antagonists triple therapy. 
The approved indication is:  
Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease 
(COPD)  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting 
beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1) 
The  posology  requested  is  two  inhalations  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  100/6/12.5  micrograms  twice  daily  (i.e.  total 
daily dose: 400 µg BDP, 24 µg FF, 50 µg GB). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application is submitted as a new fixed dose combination referring to Article 10b of Directive 2001/83/EC 
via  the  optional  scope  of  the  Centralised  Procedure  according  to  Article  3(2)(b)  (significant  innovation  or 
interest of patients at Community level) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004.

Advice was received from three National Agencies (AEMPS [2010], MHRA [2011, 2012] and MEB [2012]) in 
the clinical development of CHF 5993 pMDI in COPD.  
In  addition,  in  November  2012  the  applicant  sought  advice  from  the  EMA  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/65480/2013, 
Clarification  letter  EMA/226787  /2013),  mainly  on  clinical/clinical  pharmacology  aspects  of  the  development 
and  on  the  Phase  III  study  designs.  In  addition,  the  following  development  aspects  were  discussed:  clinical 
package for GB and duration of the GB dose finding studies; wording of the target indication; cardiac safety 
monitoring  in  Phase  III  and  waiver  from  a  Thorough  QT  (TQT)  study;  clinical  approach  to  address  special 
populations; drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies; interpretation of in vivo data regarding the characterisation 
of a spacer device.  
Germany  and  Ireland  have  given  advices  in  their  position  as  appointed  Rapporteur/Co-Rapporteur  in  July 
2016. 
In  summary,  in  line  with  the  FDC  guidelines,  the  development  of  TRIMBOW  pMDI  in  COPD  is  based  on  the 
potential advantage of obtaining the following: 
•  An improvement of the benefit/risk profile by demonstration of better efficacy of CHF 5993 pMDI vs. 
Foster pMDI with a similar acceptable safety profile (step-up-indication); 
•  A  simplification  of  the  therapy,  as  the  three  active  components  are  administered  with  one  dose 
regimen  in  a  single  inhaler,  whereas  the  current  triple  therapy  for  COPD  is  often  achieved  with  two 
different  inhalers  usually  at  two  different  dose  regimens  (twice  daily  for  the  ICS/LABA  combination 
and once daily for the LAMA component) (substitution indication).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Beclometasone dipropionate, anhydrous 
General information 
The chemical name of beclometasone dipropionate is [2-[(6S,9R,16R)-9-chloro-6-fluoro-11-hydroxy-
10,13,16-trimethyl-3-oxo-7,8,11,12,14,15,16,17-octahydro-6H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-17-yl]-2-
oxoethyl] 2,2-dimethylpropanoate corresponding to the molecular formula C28H 37ClO7. It has a relative 
molecular mass of 521.1 g/mol and the following structure:  
Figure 1 Molecular structure of beclometasone dipropionate, anhydrous. 
The active substance is a white or almost white, crystalline powder, practically insoluble in water, freely 
soluble in acetone, sparingly soluble in 96% ethanol. The active substance exhibits stereoisomerism due to 
the presence of eight asymmetric carbon atoms.  
Since the starting material has a fixed stereochemistry (natural configuration), there are hindrance effects 
and the relevant reactions are stereospecific, it has been demonstrated that the process gives BDP with a 
fixed stereochemistry. 
Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by specific optical rotation.  
Limited information on polymorphism has been provided for beclometasone dipropionate. This is acceptable 
as the active substance is in solution in the finished product. 
As there is a monograph of beclometasone dipropionate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the proposed 
manufacturers of the active substance have been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European 
Assessment report

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a pressurised inhalation solution, also referred as pressurised metered dose inhaler 
(pMDI), containing three active substances (beclometasone dipropionate anhydrous, formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate and glycopyrronium bromide) dissolved in a medium consisting of norflurane (propellant) ethanol 
(co-solvent), hydrochloric acid (formulation stabiliser). Each nominal metered actuation supplies 100 µg BDP, 
6 µg, FF and 12.5 µg GB corresponding to 87.4 µg, 5.2 µg and 10.9 µg, as delivered dose, respectively. 
Three presentations are proposed, namely: 60, 120 and 180 actuations/container (also referred as can or 
canister).  
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a solution formulation containing beclometasone 
dipropionate anhydrous, formoterol fumarate dihydrate and glycopyrronium bromide. Considering the low 
active content per actuation for all the active substances and the technical difficulties of the development of a 
stable suspension formulation, a solution formulation was chosen in order to provide good intra-inhaler 
performance and physical stability. Additionally, since the active substances are dissolved, their particle size 
distribution is not critical to product performance. Hence, the quality of the aerosol cloud is determined by 
the physical properties of the solution, especially its vapour pressure, the conduit provided by the valve and 
the orifice of the actuator.  
The quality aspects described in the “Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal 
Products” (EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr) were met. As reference for setting the in vitro equivalence 
criteria with Foster, the following guideline was followed: “Guideline on the requirements for clinical 
documentation for orally inhaled products (OIP) including the requirements for demonstration of the 
therapeutic equivalence between two inhaled products for use in the treatment of asthma and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults and for use in the treatment of asthma in children and 
adolescents” (CPMP/EWP/4151/00 Rev.1). For the container closure system and the excipients, the following 
guidelines were followed: “Guideline on plastic immediate packaging materials” CPMP/QWP/4359/03-
EMEA/CVMP/205/04 and “Guideline on Excipients in the Dossier for Application for Marketing Authorisation of 
a Medicinal Product” CHMP/QWP/396951/2006. 
Solubility studies of each of the active substances in the solvent system, consisting of norflurane, ethanol 
anhydrous, and hydrochloric acid, at different temperatures were conducted. The BDP, FF and GB solubility 
studies confirmed that all active substances remain in solution at target concentrations in the selected 
formulation.  
Compatibility of all active substances with the excipients and the container closure system has been verified 
during the development studies on laboratory and pilot batches and by the stability studies carried out up to 
now on the finished product at production scale. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

A traditional filling manufacturing method is used to manufacture the finished product. The process used for 
the production of the clinical batches was the same as the proposed commercial process. Sufficient 
information on manufacturing process development using a QbD approach has been provided.  
Robustness assessment during development of the finished product and of the related manufacturing process 
took into consideration QbD principles (such as prior knowledge and a risk assessment process).  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process and the in-process controls performed have been sufficiently described. Process 
validation studies have been conducted on production scale batches and are acceptable. All validation data 
were within specification. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and it is in 
line with the requirements of the “Guideline on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal Products” 
(EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr). The parameters refer to description (product and primary packaging), 
identification of each active substance (HPLC and HPLC/UV), assay of each active substance (HPLC and 
HPLC/UV), related substances of each active substance (HPLC), moisture content (KF), fine particle mass-
beginning of can (new generation impactor (NGI)/HPLC), mean delivered dose intra-can and inter-cans 
(HPLC) and uniformity of delivered dose intra-can and inter-cans (HPLC), microbiological limits (Ph.Eur.), leak 
rate, number of actuations per container.  
The analytical methods used, including the compendial ones, have been described in detail and appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the working and reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Adequate specification has been provided for the canister, the metering valves and the actuators.  
Batch analytical data for 12 commercial scale batches (manufactured in 2014 & 2015) of the finished product 
(3 x 60, 7 x 120 and 2 x 180 actuations/can presentations), fully equivalent to the finished product proposed 
for the market has been presented confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been conducted on several batches manufactured at the intended site of manufacture, 
at the intended production scale and packaged in the proposed container closure system.  
The stability studies have been carried out according to ICH requirements. Batches of the three presentations 
of the finished product were stored under the long term conditions (5°C), and in use conditions (25°C/60% 
RH and 30°C/75% RH). 
Samples were tested for all the parameters listed in the release specification (apart from the identification 
test). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
All the results were within the limits set in the shelf-life specification. A photo-stability study was not 
completed as it is not considered relevant since a protective primary packaging was used.

The stability data provided is representative of all the proposed active substance suppliers as the finished 
product batches used during the stability testing have been manufactured using at least two different batches 
of active substance from all the proposed suppliers and no differences were observed between the different 
suppliers. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life for the 60 actuations presentation is 21months at 
+5 °C, including a maximum in-use period of 2 months below 25 °C. The proposed shelf life for the 120 and 
180 actuations presentations is 22 months at +5 °C, including a maximum in-use period of 4 months below 
25 °C. The proposed shelf-life as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is justified.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. Sufficient information on the declaration 
regarding BSE-free material used for the actuator system has been provided.  
Satisfactory supplier’s declarations for BSE/TSE risk, OGM and latex absence for the canister material and the 
metering valve have been provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The quality aspects of the finished product have 
been addressed by ensuring adherence with the relevant CHMP guidelines for inhalation products and with 
the Ph.Eur. general chapter “Preparations for Inhalation”.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical package was performed according to EU guidelines as detailed below. 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted in compliance with the GLP regulations and according to the 
international guidelines. Studies on primary pharmacology used experimental models usually not fully in 
accordance with GLP regulations, however, based on valid scientific principles.

The toxicokinetic studies provided by the Applicant for CHF 5993 and GB as well as most of the other ADME 
studies submitted for CHF 5993 and GB were conducted in accordance with GLP principles. 
The  Applicant  has investigated the  toxicological  profile of  the  CHF  5993  combination  product  through  single 
and repeated dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity studies. In addition, the Applicant has provided a set of 
toxicological studies for the single component GB. These studies were conducted in compliance with the GLP 
regulations (exception: single dose toxicity studies for CHF 5993) but as this was performed according to the 
relevant international guidelines, this was considered acceptable.  
The  analytical  methods  used  for  determining  analyte  concentrations  in  GLP  pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic 
studies  were,  with 
a 
few 
exceptions, 
validated 
according 
to 
the 
EMEA  Guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 and to the FDA Guidance (May 2001) on bioanalytical method validation and 
in  compliance  with  the  GLP  regulations.  In  all  validation,  toxicokinetic  and  pharmacokinetic  studies,  analyte 
concentrations were expressed as concentration of free compound.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
CHF 5993 
The  non-clinical  pharmacological  studies  conducted  with  the  combination  of  GB  and  CHF  1535 
(BDP+formoterol)  provide  support  for  the  concept  that  the  FDC  of  GB  and  CHF  1535  (CHF  5993)  displays 
increased efficacy/potency versus bronchoconstriction and airway hyper-responsiveness induced by different 
challenges  (including  bronchoconstriction  induced  by  acetaldehyde  and  Ach  in  anaesthetised  guinea  pigs, 
airway hyper-responsiveness induced by ovalbumine and histamine in ovalbumine-sensitised guinea pigs and 
airway hyper-responsiveness induced by substance P in acetaldehyde-sensitised guinea pigs). BDP and FF co-
administration  also  potentiated  the  inhibitory  effect  of  GB  on  histamine  and  TXB2  release  following 
ovalbumine  challenge  in  sensitised  animals.  Taken  together,  these  studies  support  the  concept  that  the 
application  of  the  LAMA  GB  in  combination  with  the  established,  clinically  efficacious  BDP+FF  (ICS  +  LABA) 
combination  may  have  the  potential  to  provide  an  additional  benefit  for  the  treatment  of  COPD  patients, 
when compared with the single components (an hypothesis to be verified by clinical data). 
Glycopyrronium bromide 
The  non-clinical  pharmacological  studies  provided  showed  that  GB  is  a  potent,  efficacious  and  long-lasting 
bronchodilatating  compound  in  isolated  preparations  from  guinea-pigs  and  human  lung  specimens  and  in 
anaesthetised  guinea-pigs.  Compared  with  the  muscarinic  receptor  antagonists  tiotropium  and  ipratropium, 
GB is as potent or even more potent than both compounds in isolated human bronchial preparations, while in 
anaesthetised guinea-pigs it is as potent as ipratropium but about 3 times less potent than tiotropium. GB’s 
duration of action is intermediate between that of tiotropium and that of ipratropium in both in vitro and in 
vivo bioassays. 
Additional data (CHF 1535) 
According  to  available  data,  the  combination  of  inhalable  BDP  and  FF  has  been  shown  to  be  an  effective 
bronchodilator  following  Ach  induced  bronchoconstriction  in  anaesthetised  guinea  pigs  and  ovalbumin 
challenge in sensitised anaesthetised guinea pigs. Furthermore the BDP+FF combination was effective when 
administered i.t. at reducing inflammation in a sephadex-induced lung oedema model in rats. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 21/90 
  
  
 
Non-clinical data concerning secondary pharmacodynamics of the active substances BDP, FF and GB have not 
been provided by the Applicant. Taking into account that such effects have been evaluated clinically and are 
well-documented in published literature, this is considered acceptable. 
Safety pharmacology 
CHF 5993 
Cardiovascular  and  respiratory  system:  In  in  vitro  studies,  CHF  5993  had  no  effects  on  cardiac  sodium 
(hNaV1.5)  and  L-type  calcium  (hCaV1.2)  channels  expressed  in  human  embryonic  kidney  (HEK-293)  cells 
and on duration of action potential in isolated guinea pig myocytes. However, CHF 5993 inhibited potassium 
current  via  hERG  channels  (which  physiologically  play  an  important  role  in  myocardial  repolarisation) 
expressed  in  HEK-293  cells  and  its  potency  for  this  effect  increased  with  prolonged  incubation  (IC50  378 
ng/ml). 
In a telemetry study in conscious dogs treated with CHF 5993 via inhalation, effects consistent with the ß2-
adrenergic  respectively  anti-muscarinic  pharmacological  activity  of  the  single  components  formoterol  and 
glycopyrronium  were  observed.  Heart  rate  increase  and  blood  pressure  decrease  were  seen  at  all  doses 
(including the low dose of 33+2+7 µg/kg BDP+FF+GB). Furthermore, at mid and high doses (134+8+35 and 
460+29+107  µg/kg  BDP+FF+GB,  respectively),  the  P-wave  amplitude  was  increased  and  the  duration 
decreased  and  the  P-Q  and  QRS  intervals  were  shortened.  Additional  ECG  changes  included  a  dose-
dependent  increase  of  sinus  and  ventricular  tachycardia,  ventricular  premature  contractions  and  1st  to  2nd 
degree  atrio-ventricular  block  at  the  mid  and  high  doses.  Respiratory  rate  was  increased  at  the  high  dose, 
tidal volume and minute volume were increased at all doses. 
A safety factor calculation for the low CHF 5993 dose, based on either allometric dose conversion or systemic 
exposure to the active components of the CHF 5993 triple combination in dogs and in humans is provided in

$ AUC 0-24h extrapolated from the AUC 0-12h at steady state in the CARSAF study given 400/24/50 µg day (b.i.d.) 
No adverse effects on cardiac or respiratory systems were evident following intraduodenal administration to 
rats. 
CNS:  No  additional  safety  pharmacology  studies  of  the  effects  of  the  CHF  5993  combination  on  CNS 
parameters were carried out. Considering the reported lack of relevant effects of the individual components 
on CNS parameters tested, this approach is considered acceptable. 
Glycopyrronium bromide 
Cardiovascular and respiratory system: In in vitro studies, GB had no effect on duration of action potential of 
isolated guinea-pig myocytes, however, inhibited potassium current via hERG channels expressed in HEK-293 
cells with an IC50-value of 399 µM (158 µg/ml).  
In  an  in  vivo  inhalation  study  in  telemetered  conscious  dogs,  GB  resulted  in  CV  effects  expected  for  a  M3 
muscarinic  antagonist,  e.g.  increase  in  heart  rate,  slight  decrease  in  systolic  and  slight  increase  in  diastolic 
blood  pressure,  slight  but  significant  shortening  of  PQ,  QRST,  QT  and  QTc  intervals  and  1st  or  2nd  degree 
atrio-ventricular  block.  Taking  into  account  that  a  1st  degree  atrio-ventricular  block  is  considered  to  be 
clinically not relevant, the NOAEL level was deemed to be 82 μg/kg in this study, providing a 44 fold safety 
margin assuming a 50 μg/day therapeutic dose. 
Intraduodenal  administration  of  GB  at  doses  up  to  150  mg/kg  had  no  effect  on  cardiac  or  respiratory 
parameters in Wistar rats. 
CNS:  Orally  applied  GB  resulted  in  a  slight  decrease  in  spontaneous  locomotor  activity  of  rats  at  higher 
doses, however, did not induce any behavioural change in the Irwin test, did not affect performance time in 
the rotarod test and had no effect on hexobarbital-induced sleeping time.

Others:  In  pylorus-ligated  rats,  intraduodenally  applied  GB  (in  doses  ≥  20  mg/kg)  induced  an  inhibition  of 
gastric  secretion  and  (at  a  dose  of  320  mg/kg)  mortality.  Reported  GI  toxicity  associated  with  GB 
administration  is  not  considered  clinically  relevant  given  the  high  dose  and  the  intraduodenal  route  of 
administration. Orally applied GB inhibited GI charcoal propulsion and induced a decrease in urine output and 
significant increases in electrolyte (potassium, chloride) and protein excretion.  
Additional data (CHF 1535) 
Orally  applied  CHF  1535  was  not  associated  with  any  adverse  CNS  effects  (except  for  a  minor  reduction  in 
spontaneous locomotor activity and increase in sleeping time at higher doses). CHF 1535 was associated with 
a decrease in gastric motility (100 mg/kg orally) and a decrease in urine output (≥4mg/kg orally) at higher 
doses. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Non-clinical  data  concerning  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  of  the  active  ingredients  BDP,  FF  and  GB 
have not been provided by the Applicant. Taking into account that such effects have been evaluated clinically 
and are well-documented for these therapeutic classes in published literature this is considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics and disposition of BDP and FF are well-known.  
In  vitro  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed  to  investigate  potential  drug-drug  interactions  of  GB  and 
CHF 1535. No new in vivo PK studies are presented for CHF 1535. A more extensive package of PK studies 
has been provided concerning the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of GB. 
Substance specific data 
- CHF 5993 
A  possible  pharmacokinetic  interaction  between  GB  and  CHF  1535  (FF  +  BDP)  was  investigated  in  male 
catheterized  rats  after  separate  and  concomitant  i.v.  administration  of  the  components:  for  all  CHF  5993 
components (BDP, FF; GB) and for B17MP (main metabolite of BDP) no statistically significant difference was 
observed in plasma AUC and systemic clearance, indicating no modification in the elimination mechanism due 
to co-administration of the single components.  
No dedicated oral or pulmonary absorption studies were performed with CHF 5993. The systemic exposure to 
the  CHF  5993  components  and  to  B17MP  was  evaluated  in  toxicokinetic  studies  during  the  4-  and  13-week 
repeat-dose toxicity studies: the individual components of CHF 5993 are rapidly absorbed following inhalation 
administration  with  Tmax  reached  in  ≈1  hour  and  elimination  half-lives  of  the  components  between  1-10 
hours with little evidence of accumulation in rats and only slight accumulation in dogs (AUC week 13/day 1 
ratios  ranged  0.57-1.9).  Following  inhalation,  exposure  to  BDP,  its  metabolite  B17MP,  FF  and  GB  increased 
with  dose.  In  rats,  BDP  was  quantified  in too  few  samples to  allow  the  determination  of  AUCt  and t½,  only 
Cmax was used for comparison between groups. There was no significant change in drug exposure following 
combination administration relative to administration of CHF 1535 or GB (GB exposure was slightly lower in 
combination relative to single administration in rats, but this effect was not seen in dog). 
- Glycopyrronium bromide 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 24/90 
  
  
 
Glycopyrronium  pharmacokinetics  in  dogs  and  rats  was  characterized  by  a  low  oral  bioavailability  (in 
particular in rats), a high  systemic  clearance,  a  moderate  volume  of  distribution  and  a  terminal  half-life 
lower than 13 hours. 
Absorption:  The  submitted  toxicokinetic  data  indicate  systemic  exposure  to  glycopyrronium  following 
inhalation administration. Systemic  bioavailability of glycopyrronium after  oral  administration  was  20-30% 
in  dogs,  but  lower  than  1%  in  rats,  suggesting  that  the  contribution  of  glycopyrronium  swallowed  after 
inhalation to systemic glycopyrronium exposure is likely to be moderate in dogs and limited in rats. Due to 
the low intestinal absorption, high glycopyrronium doses are required to obtain a relevant systemic exposure 
in oral toxicity studies.  
Distribution: Steady state volume  of  distribution of glycopyrronium,  as  determined  after  i.v. administration, 
was 2.4-6.7 L/kg in dogs and 1.2-6.8 L/kg in rats. No radiolabelled GB distribution studies are presented.  
Glycopyrronium´s binding to rat, dog and mouse plasma proteins was in the range of 30-47% compared with 
a  value  of  about  70%  in humans  and  was  not  concentration  dependent.  The blood  to  plasma  concentration 
ratio  was  lower  than  1,  indicating  no  significant  uptake  into  red  blood  cells.  For  the  glycopyrronium 
metabolite  CHF  6006,  plasma  protein  binding  amounted  to  88%  in  rats,  76%  in  dogs,  89%  in  humans  and 
73% in mice. 
As  expected  for  a  quaternary  ammonium  compound,  glycopyrronium  showed  low  penetration  through  the 
blood-brain  barrier (in mongrel dogs and mice) and a limited placental transfer (in pregnant mice, dogs and 
ewes). 
Metabolism:  Glycopyrronium´s  metabolic  pattern,  determined  in  vitro  using  liver  microsomes  and 
hepatocytes from humans, dogs, rats, rabbits and mice, was similar among species, supporting the choice of 
animal species (rat, dog) used for the toxicological evaluation. 
The  main  metabolic  reaction  was  the  hydroxylation  of  the  phenyl-  or  cyclopentyl-rings.  Glycopyrronium 
ester  hydrolysis (to generate the products CHF6006 and CHF6009) was shown to be a minor metabolic route. 
However, systemic exposure to CHF6006 was observed in rats after oral and inhalation application, which can 
be  explained  by  glycopyrronium  hydrolysis  in  the  gut  followed  by  CHF6006  absorption  into  the  systemic 
circulation.  Systemic exposure  to CHF6009 instead, due to a higher systemic clearance, is much lower than 
to CHF6006.  
The  role  of  CYP450  isoforms  in  glycopyrronium  metabolism  was  investigated  with  recombinant  human 
CYP450 enzymes: CYP2D6 was found to be  the only isoform relevant for the metabolism, with a Km of 3.9 
µM. 
Excretion: After i.v. administration to bile duct catheterized rats, glycopyrronium excretion in bile accounted 
for less than 1% of the dose, whereas about 25% and 19% of the dose was excreted as unchanged drug into 
urine in males and females rats, respectively. The percentage of the dose that is not excreted unchanged is 
likely to be eliminated via metabolism. 
The renal clearance was greater than the glomerular filtration rate, indicating that glycopyrronium is actively 
secreted into urine. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions: Concerning the pharmacokinetic interaction between CHF 1535 (BDP+FF) 
and GB, see information on CHF 5993, above.  
In vitro studies with transfected cells showed that glycopyrronium is a substrate of OCT1, OCT2 and MATE1 
but  not  of  MDR1  and  BCRP  transporters.  The  ability  of  glycopyrronium  to  inhibit  the  human  transporters 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 25/90 
  
  
 
OCT1,  OCT2,  OCT3,  OCTN1,  OCTN2,  MATE1,  OAT1,  OAT3,  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  MDR1  and  BCRP  was 
investigated  in  vitro.  Since  the  observed  IC50-values  were  always  more  than  50-times  higher  than  the 
maximum  plasma  glycopyrronium  concentration  observed  in  clinical  studies,  drug-drug  interactions  due  to 
inhibition of the transport of other drugs by glycopyrronium appear unlikely. 
In  in  vitro  studies  with  human  liver  microsomes  and  recombinant  human  UGTs  neither  the  UGT  (1A1,  1A3, 
1A4,  1A6,  1A9,  2B7,  2B15)  nor  the  CYP-450  (1A2,  2A6,  2B6,  2E1,  2C9,  2C19,  2D6,  3A4)  linked  activities 
were  significantly  affected  by  glycopyrronium.  Furthermore,  as  determined  in  cultured  hepatocytes,  no 
induction  of  enzyme  expression  (CYP3A4  and  CYP1A2)  was  observed.  Therefore,  glycopyrronium  is  not 
expected to modify plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of the UGT- and CYP450-enzymes. 
Other  pharmacokinetic  studies:  Since  glycopyrronium  represents  the  (R,S)-(S,R)  racemic  pair  of 
enantiomers,  corresponding  to  the  threo  diastereoisomeric  structure,  a  possible  difference  in  systemic 
exposure  to  the  single  enantiomers  was  investigated  in  rats  and  dogs  after  CHF  5993  inhalation.  The 
(S,R)/(R,S)  ratios  of  enantiomers  for  Cmax and  AUClast were in  the  range  1.0  –  1.2 in rats (indicating no 
relevant difference in  exposure to the enantiomers) and 0.7 – 1.6 in dogs (suggesting a limited difference in 
exposure). 
Since  CHF  6006  was  not  detectable  in  plasma  after  i.v.  glycopyrronium  administration,  but  was  detectable 
after  inhalation,  it  was  hypothesized  that  the  amount  of  the  inhaled  dose  that  is  swallowed  may  undergo 
chemical  hydrolysis  in  the  gut  to  generate  CHF  6006  and  CHF  6009,  which  are  then  absorbed  in  the 
systemic  circulation.  Pharmacokinetics  of  CHF  6006  and  CHF  6009,  investigated  in  male  rats  showed  that 
they  have  opposite pharmacokinetic  properties,  with  low  clearance  and  a  low volume  of  distribution  for the 
former and  high  clearance  and  a   high  volume  of  distribution for  the  latter.  Therefore,  although  only  a 
small  percentage  of  the  amount  swallowed  is  hydrolyzed,  the  opposite  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  the 
compounds  explain  the  significant  systemic  exposure  to  CHF  6006  and  the  negligible  systemic  exposure  to 
CHF 6009. 
- Additional data (CHF 1535) 
According to available data, BDP is rapidly cleared from lung and bronchi and after 24 h less than 1% of the 
administered  dose  remained  in  these  tissues.  The  metabolism  of  BDP  in  rats  and  dogs  is  similar  to  that 
observed in man. BDP is rapidly hydrolysed into its main active metabolite B17MP and the minor metabolite 
21-monopropionate  (B21MP),  that  are  subsequently  transformed  into  the  pharmacologically  inactive  alcohol 
derivatives (BOH). 
For radiolabelled FF, the radioactivity distributed mainly in kidney and liver, followed by plasma, trachea and 
the lung. FF plasma protein binding was similar between rat, dog and human plasma and ranged from 50 to 
65%. Metabolism of FF occurs via O-glucuronidation, with the phenolic glucuronide as primary metabolite in 
rats, dogs and humans.  
B17MP was a substrate for MDR1, however the relevant IC50 values are well in excess of the reported clinical 
Cmax. Data are not presented assessing the interaction of BDP or FF with human organic anionic transporters 
or inhibition of UGT or CYP450 isoforms. Considering that BDP and FF have previously been licensed and that 
there is clinical experience using them in combination, it is accepted that additional in vitro tests are unlikely 
to provide data which will significantly add to the safety assessment at this time.

Overview of the toxicological development program 
Toxicological studies performed with CHF 5993 
The  non-clinical  toxicology  package  for  CHF  5993  is  based  on  the  completed  toxicology  program  and  a 
comprehensive set of toxicology studies for GB. In addition bridging studies with the CHF 5993 combination 
have been performed. These include, single dose oral toxicity studies in rats of the combination in the ratio of 
100:6:25 (dissolved in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose), 4-week repeat dose inhalation toxicity studies in rats 
and  dogs  of  the  free  combination  of  CHF  1535  pMDI  and  GB  pMDI,  and  13-week  repeat  dose  inhalation 
toxicity studies in rats and dogs of the fixed combination of CHF 5993  pMDI (100μg BDP/6μg FF/25μg GB). 
Although  this  ratio  is  different  than  that  of  the  proposed  clinical  product  (GB  dose  is  12.5μg  in  the  clinical 
product,  25μg  in  toxicological  studies),  this  design  is  considered  adequate  to  support  the  present  MAA. 
Furthermore, reproductive oral toxicity studies were carried out in rats to assess the effect of the combination 
on embryo-foetal development, fertility and pre & post-natal development. All studies except the single dose 
toxicity studies were GLP compliant. 
Selection of species for toxicological studies 
Rat and dog were the animal species used for single and repeat-dose toxicological evaluation of CHF 5993, as 
inter-species  comparison  of  metabolism  and  of  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  formoterol,  BDP  and 
glycopyrronium supported the selection of these species. 
Characterization of the toxicological profile of inhaled glycopyrronium bromide 
Glycopyrronium is already in clinical use by the i.v. route (as pre- and intra-operative antimuscarinic agent), 
by the oral route (for the treatment of peptic ulcer) and, as recently approved, by inhalation (in combination 
with a ß2-agonist for treatment of COPD). To further characterize the toxicological profile of inhaled GB, the 
Applicant has conducted a number of additional toxicity and safety pharmacology studies with GB or the GB-
HFA formulation, including, as recommended in a scientific advice given by the EMA in 2013, the evaluation 
of  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  GB  in  a  104-week  rat  inhalation  study  and  an  oral  26-week  study  in 
transgenic  Tg.rasH2  mice.  These  studies  were  carried  out  in  compliance  with  the  GLP  regulations  and  in 
accordance with the relevant international GLs. 
Single dose toxicity 
CHF 5993 
When  administered  by  the  oral  or  i.p.  route  to  rats,  CHF  5993  (BDP:FF:GB,100:6:25  dissolved  in  0.5% 
carboxymethylcellulose)  showed  a  low  acute  toxicity,  with  a  maximum  tolerated  dose  of  500  mg/kg  and  100 
mg/kg,  respectively.  At  an  oral  dose  of  800  mg/kg,  piloerection,  hunched  posture,  ataxia,  salivation, 
lachrymation,  reduced  activity  and  semi  closed  eyes  were  observed.  At  this  dose,  3/10  animals  died. 
Following i.p. administration of 200 mg/kg, 1/10 animals died.  
Glycopyrronium bromide 
According to published literature, GB showed low toxicity after  single  dose application by different  routes of 
administration in rodent and non-rodent species.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
CHF 5993 
In  repeat  dose  inhalation  studies  with  CHF  5993  in  rats  and  dogs  of  up  to  13  weeks  duration,  the  main 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 27/90 
  
  
 
observed  alterations  were  related  to  the  immuno-suppressive  activity  of  BDP/B17MP  (observed  in  both 
species) and cardiovascular effects (e.g. increase in heart rate) due to the pharmacological activity of FF 
and GB (mainly observed in dogs).  
Toxicokinetic  determinations  evidenced  the  systemic  exposure  of  the  study  animals  to  formoterol, 
glycopyrronium and BDP/B17MP following inhalative application of CHF 5993. 
In  the  repeat  dose toxicity  studies  with  CHF  5993,  groups  given  FF  doses in  the  dog  studies in  excess  of  2 
μg/kg/day  underwent  a  2-5  day  dose  escalation  phase  prior  to  starting  the  studies  to  ameliorate  the  CV 
effects of high dose FF. 
4-week studies: 4-week repeat dose inhalation toxicity studies with a 4 week recovery period were performed 
in  rat  and  dog  using  a  combination  of  the existing CHF  1535  (BDP+FF)  pMDI  and  a  GB  pMDI,  compared  to 
the single components and to controls (air and/or vehicle). Thymus, heart, liver, and adrenals were identified 
as the primary target organs. Reductions in thymus and adrenal weights were evident in groups exposed to 
CHF  1535  and  CHF  5993.  These  were  reversible  following  recovery  and  are  consistent  with  the 
pharmacological  activity of  BDP.  Changes  in  CV  parameters in  beagle  dogs  (increase  in  HR  and  decrease  in 
QT in CHF 1535 group and groups exposed to doses of CHF 5993 ≥127+8+32 µg/kg/day BDP+FF+GB) are 
consistent  with  the  pharmacological  activity  of  FF  and  GB.  There  did  not  appear  to  be  a  significant  additive 
effect concerning toxicity for the combination product relative to the single components.  
Safety  margins  with  regard  to  clinical  application  of  CHF  5993,  as  derived  from  the  4-week  repeat  dose 
toxicity studies in rats and dogs, are depicted in the following tables, respectively.

13-week  studies:  13-week  repeat  dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies  with  a  6  week  recovery  period  were 
performed  in  rat  and  dog  using  a  100+6+25  μg  (BDP+FF+GB)  combination  pMDI,  compared  to  the  single 
components and to controls. The CHF 5993 formulation is different from that proposed for clinical application 
in  this  MAA,  but  this  is  considered  acceptable  for  safety  studies  as  the  GB  dose  exceeds  the  dose  in  the 
proposed clinical formulation (25 vs 12.5 μg GB). Thymus, liver, heart and adrenals were again identified as 
target organs in these studies. 
In rat, thymus atrophy and reduction in weight was evident in the CHF 1535 group and all CHF 5993 groups 
examined, effects which were reversible following the 6 week recovery period. Decreased lymphocytes were 
evident  in  the  CHF  1535  group  and  in  females  in  all  CHF  5993  groups  and  males  at  the  highest  dose  only 
(883+55+207  μg/kg/day  BDP+FF+GB),  effects  that  are    likely  related  to  the  pharmacological  activity    of 
BDP.  
In dogs, cardiovascular effects (e.g. an increase in heart rate), likely related to the pharmacological activity 
of FF and/or GB, represented prominent findings.  
Safety  margins  with  regard  to  clinical  application  of  CHF  5993,  as  derived  from  the  13-week  repeat  dose

Glycopyrronium bromide 
Repeat-dose  toxicity  of  inhaled  GB  was  evaluated  in  dogs  (study  duration  up  to  13  weeks)  and  rats  (study 
duration up to 26 weeks). Toxicokinetic determinations performed in these studies showed systemic exposure 
to  glycopyrronium  and  its  metabolite  without  evidence  of  accumulation.  The  main  observed  effects  were 
related  to  the  known  antimuscarinic  activity  of  GB  (e.g.  increase  in  heart  rate,  mydriasis).  In  addition, 
decreases in body weight gain/food consumption were consistently observed.

Genotoxicity 
A standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests was performed with GB. In addition, genotoxicity 
studies  of  the  already  approved  combination  CHF  1535  were  presented.  In  studies  performed  in  line  with 
option 1 from ICH S2(R1), GB and CHF 1535 were negative for mutagenicity in a bacterial Ames test, did not 
produce chromosomal damage in an in vitro chromosome aberration test in human lymphocyte cells with and 
without metabolic activation, and were negative in in vivo micronucleus assays performed in rats with doses 
up to 80 mg/kg for GB and 1500 mg/kg for CHF 1535. No genotoxicity studies were performed with the triple 
combination CHF 5993. Based on the provided studies, GB and CHF 1535 are not considered to be genotoxic 
in  vitro  and  in  vivo.  The  lack  of  genotoxicity  studies  with  the  triple  combination  CHF  5993  is  therefore 
considered acceptable. 
Carcinogenicity 
According  to  the  CHMP  “GL  on  the  Non-clinical  Development  of  Fixed  Combinations  of  Medicinal  Products” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005),  CHF  5993  corresponds  to  the  co-development  of  three  known  active 
substances as a fixed dose combination. For FF and BDP extensive non-clinical and clinical data are available 
and  therefore  the  applicant’s  view  that  additional  carcinogenicity  studies  for  these  compounds  are  not 
considered  necessary  is  acceptable  to  the  CHMP.  Although  high  doses  of  FF  were  reported to  be  associated 
with  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  mesovarial  leiomyoma  and  granulosa/theca  cell  tumours  in  rats,  these 
tumours  are  thought  to  represent  specific  effects  of  β-adrenergic  agonists  in  rodents,  not  linked  to  a 
genotoxic mechanism given that all the different mutagenicity tests are negative. For GB no long-term data 
via  the  inhalation  route  were  available,  therefore  the  Applicant  performed  a  104-week  rat  inhalation 
carcinogenicity  study  with  GB  alone.  GB  showed  no  carcinogenic  potential  after  inhalation  in  rats  at 
sufficiently  high  safety  margins  towards  the  anticipated  human  exposure.  In  addition,  a  26-week 
carcinogenicity  study  with  GB  in  transgenic  Tg.rasH2  mice  was  performed,  which  showed  no  carcinogenic 
potential of GB after oral administration. 
Reproduction toxicity 
CHF 5993 
The  effects  of  CHF  5993  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development,  embryo-foetal  development  and  on 
the pre- and post-natal development were studied in rats following oral administration of BDP, FF and GB in 
the  ratio  of  100+6+25  in  0.5%  carboxymethylcellulose.  Reported  doses  of  CHF  5993  when  formulated  in 
solutions for oral gavage always reflect the sum of the doses of each respective single agent (BDP+FF+GB)  
Toxicokinetic data for CHF 5993 were not collected concomitantly with the reproduction toxicity studies, but 
were  obtained  from  a  separate  dose-range  finding and  toxicokinetic  study  with  CHF  5993.  The  toxicokinetic 
data  show  that  the  exposure  to  B17MP  (metabolite  of  BMP)  is  sufficiently  high  at  the  NOAELs  of  the 
reproduction  toxicity  studies  compared  to  human  exposure  at  the  therapeutic  dose.  The  exposure  to 
formoterol  is  lower  or  even  2-fold  higher  at  the  NOAELs  compared  to  human  exposure  at  the  therapeutic 
dose.  For  glycopyrronium,  the  exposure  tends  to  be  similar  or  even  lower  than  the  human  exposure  at  the 
therapeutic dose. 
In  the  fertility  study  with  CHF  5993,  all  females  mated.  However,  a  dose-dependent  decrease  in  pregnant 
females  was  observed  leading  to  a  reduction  of  conception  rate  and  fertility  index.  In  females,  treatment-
related effects included a slightly increased mean precoital time and reduction in mean body weight gain and 
number  of  corpora  lutea.  Pre-  and  post-implantation  loss  was  also  significantly  increased,  leading  to  a 
reduced number of implantation sites and live embryos. Treatment was not associated with any macroscopic 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 31/90 
  
  
 
change  related  to  male  fertility  at  any  dose  level  tested.  The  increased  pre-implantation  loss  and  reduced 
number of implantations may be due to treatment with BDP. As the exposure to glycopyrrolate at this dose 
level  seems  to  be  similar  to  the  exposure  in  humans,  no  safety  margin  would  exist  for  this  effect.  The 
parental NOAEL was considered to be 2 mg/kg/day and the NOEL for reproduction was considered to be 0.2 
mg/kg/day. 
In  the  embryo-foetal  development  study  in  rats,  treatment-related  findings  were  recorded  in  the  foeti 
including significantly lower foetal weights and a slight disturbance in development, characterized by a slight 
delay  in ossification,  an  increased  incidence of  visceral  variations  such  as  left-sided  umbilical  artery,  dilated 
ureter/renal pelvis or distended urinary bladder and thymus long cranial. Such effects have been reported for 
glucocorticoids and are therefore attributed to the treatment with BDP. The exposure to B17MP at the NOEL 
was  20-fold  higher  than  the  human  exposure  at  the  therapeutic  dose,  suggesting  a  sufficiently  high  safety 
margin. 
The  NOAEL  for  maternal  effects  was  20  mg/kg/day  and  the  NOEL  for  fetal  developmental  toxicity  was  0.2 
mg/kg/day. 
In  the  pre-and  post-natal  development  study  with  CHF  5993  in  rats  an  unexpected  high  mortality  was 
observed  in  the  high  dose  group  of  2  mg/kg/day  of  the  dams  and  also  of  the  litters,  leading  to  early 
termination of this dose group. Ruffled fur was observed in some individuals at the end of the gestation and 
the start of the lactation period, with associated reduction in food intake and bodyweight gain. The females 
appeared  to  have  difficulties  with  the  birth  and  several  were  losing  weight.  In  addition,  only  7  out  of  22 
females gave birth to live pups and on Day 4 of lactation only 2 litters remained.  
The high mortality and the difficulties with birth seen in the 2 mg/kg dose group are probably linked to the 
known effects of the β2-sympathomimetic FF and is consistent with that previously seen with Foster (BDP+FF 
–  ratio  100+6)  in  the  rat  pre-postnatal  development  study.  Also,  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  antimuscarinic 
effects  of  GB  such  as  dry  mouth  or  tachycardia  could  have  compounded  the  tocolytic  effects  of  FF  and 
contributed to worsening the general health of the dams. 
Other  treatment-related  effects  in  the  dams  included  lower  food  consumption  and  bodyweight,  increase  in 
post-implantation loss and number of dead pups and reduction in litter size. The increase in post-implantation 
loss is considered to be related to treatment with BDP, since this is a known effect of glucocorticoids. 
In F1 pups bodyweight was reduced, probably due to a lack of maternal care/availability of milk, which are 
likely to be related to the observed reduction of food consumption and body weight in the dams at this time 
due to the pharmacological activity of glycopyrronium.  
In the F1 generation, the number of pregnant females, number of corpora lutea, implantation and litter size 
was reduced and post-implantation loss was increased.  
The NOEL for the parent F0 generation was considered to be 0.02 mg/kg/day and the NOEL for the F1 
generation was established at 0.02 mg/kg/day. The exposure levels at the NOAEL for FF and GB were below 
the human exposure levels at the recommended therapeutic dose of Trimbow in COPD patients and thus the 
effects seen in this study may be of clinical relevance. 
GB 
The  applicant  also  submitted  embryo-foetal  developmental  studies  with  GB  alone  in  rats  and  Himalayan 
rabbits  as  second  mammalian  species  together  with  dose-range-findings  and  toxicokinetic  studies  in  both 
species. 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 32/90 
  
  
 
The toxicokinetic dose ranging study in rats confirmed that GB was detectable at all dosages tested, while in 
rabbit  it  was  only  detectable  at  the  higher  dose,  this  informed  the  choice  of  dosages  to  be  used  in  the 
embryo/foetal  development  study.  It  is  acceptable  to  use  data  from  oral  gavage  studies  despite  the  low 
bioavailability  of  GB  via  the  oral  route  (<1%(PRECLI-RP-0365)),  as  exposure  values  in  the  dosage  range 
used in these studies still provide exposures with adequate safety margins relative to human Cmax and AUC 
values  (63  and  14  respectively  @  5mg/kg/day).  In  rats,  GB  was  well  tolerated,  with  none  of  the  doses 
examined  producing  any  effect  on  the  reproductive  parameters  measured,  the  foetal  NOAEL  was  set  at 
125mg/kg/day,  the  highest  dose  tested.  Doses  of  25mg/kg/day  and  above  were  however  associated  with 
decreased maternal food consumption and weight gain, hence the maternal NOAEL was set at 5mg/kg/day. 
No evidence of teratogenic potential was observed at any dose level tested. In rabbits, doses of 30mg/kg/day 
and  above  were  associated  with  abortions  and  a  reduction  in  maternal  weight  gain.  The  60mg/kg/day  high 
dose  was  associated  with  a  decrease  in  placental  weight.  The  foetal  NOEL  was  set  at  60  mg/kg/day  but 
maternal NOAEL was set at 15mg/kg/day due to the incidence of abortions and reductions in maternal weight 
gain at higher doses. There was no evidence of teratogenic effects up to the highest dose level tested. These 
data  do  not  indicate  that  GB  is  associated  with  teratogenic  potential,  they  do  suggest  the  potential 
contribution of GB to the reductions in weight gain and food consumption observed in animals administered 
the combination product. 
Local tolerance 
In  repeat  dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies  with  CHF  5993,  no  signs  of  lung  irritation  were  seen  up  to  the 
highest  dose  administered  to  rats  and  dogs  for  13  consecutive  weeks  (see  subsection  “Repeat  dose 
toxicity”),  and  no  local  irritancy  or  systemic  toxicity  were  seen  following  administration  of  vehicle  (HFA, 
ethanol, HCl). 
A calculation of safety margins for CHF 5993 with regard to clinical application, based on the local exposure 
of the alveolar epithelium to the active components BDP, FF and GB in 13-week inhalation toxicity studies in 
animal studies and in the clinical situation is presented in the following tables.

Other toxicity studies 
- Antigenicity 
There  is  no  specific  antigenic  concern  with  regard  to  the  single  active  components  (BDP,  FF,  GB)  of  CHF 
5993. Nevertheless, an assessment of the leucocyte populations (immunophenotyping) was performed during 
the  4-week  repeat  dose  inhalation  toxicity  study  with  CHF  5993  in  rats.  A  relevant  effect  on  the  relative 
proportion of leukocyte subpopulations was not detected. 
-  Immunotoxicity 
There is no specific immunotoxic alert for the single components (BDP, FF, GB) of CHF 5993. Nevertheless, a 
measurement  of  anti-sheep  red  blood  cell  (anti-SRBC)  IgM  titers  (as  an  indicator  of  primary  immune 
response)  was  performed  during  the  4-week  repeat-dose  inhalation  study  in  rats  to  assess  potential 
immunotoxicity. Unexpectedly, there was a statistically significant increase (to 433% of the placebo value) 
in  the  mean  anti-SRBC  IgM  titers  of  male  rats  treated  with  GB  alone  at  a  dose  of  238  µg/kg/day.    The 
Applicant clarified that the high anti-SRBC IgM titers seen in male rats treated with GB alone were mainly due 
to the inclusion of 2 males (possible outliers) with titers substantially higher than the other males evaluated 
in this group, which had IgM titers similar to the females. Since there were no other findings in the 4 week 
study in rats as well as in published literature correlating high doses of GB (administered alone or as part of 
CHF 5993) with an effect on primary immune response, the Applicant concluded that the apparent effect on 
anti-SRBC IgM titers, observed in males only, was fortuitous. This conclusion is considered acceptable. 
- Excipients 
The  CHF  5993  pMDI  formulation  contains  the  propellant  HFA-134a  and  low  quantities  of  the  excipients 
ethanol  and  hydrochloric  acid,  ingredients  commonly  and  safely  used  in  inhaled  pharmaceutical  products. 
Although  not  necessarily  required,  their  possible  adverse  effects  have  been  evaluated  during  inhalation 
toxicity studies where the vehicle alone was also tested. 
- Impurities 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 34/90 
  
  
 
 
 
From  a  toxicological  point  of  view,  the  specifications  of  the  BDP-,  FF-  and  GB-related  impurities  have  been 
adequately justified by the Applicant. 
BDP-related:  The  Applicant  has  assessed  16-β-methylepoxide-17,21-dipropionate  (BDP  epoxide  or  CHF 
4119),  a  degradation  product  that  the  Applicant  states  is  related  to  beclometasone  21-propionate,  for 
genotoxicity in  a  GLP-compliant  Ames  test,  for  its  ability to  cause  chromosomal  damage  in  vitro  in  cultured 
human lymphocytes, and in vivo in a test for micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) in mouse bone 
marrow.  CHF  4119  was  shown  to  be  negative  in  these  tests.  CHF  4119  was  found  to  cause  no  mortality 
following a single administration to CD-1 mice at doses of 5000mg/kg via oral gavage and 2000mg/kg i.p. As 
CHF  4119  is  contained  in  any  other  impurities  and  hence  ≤ 1.0%  in  the  final  product,  this  qualification  is 
sufficient to comply with the requirements of ICH Q3B.  
FF related: FF related impurity CHF 4278 is present above the ICH Q3B qualification threshold in the finished 
product. An animal  group in the 13-week rat repeat dose toxicity study that received CHF 5993 containing 
1% CHF 4278 did not exhibit any additional toxicity to that observed in the CHF 5993 group. In addition CHF 
4278 was shown to be negative for genotoxicity in a bacterial Ames test.  
A dedicated repeat dose toxicity study showed no difference in toxicological parameters in rats treated with 
CHF  1535  enriched  with  2%  formoterol  ethanolate  (CHF  4484)  or  PMA.  The  addition  of  a  CHF  1535  control 
group in this experiment would have provided a more useful comparator to establish the effects of PMA and 
CHF4484 on toxicological parameters (rather than placebo/air control group). However, as treatment related 
toxicity was similar to that previously reported in the 13-week rat repeat dose toxicity studies, the approach 
is considered acceptable. Both PMA and CHF4484 were negative in a bacterial Ames test and did not induce 
chromosomal  aberrations  in  human  lymphocytes.  Therefore,  these  impurities  are  considered  sufficiently 
qualified. 
GB-related: GB related impurity CHF 5463 was not mutagenic in an in vitro Ames test. It was not associated 
with any toxicity additional to that observed by GB when tested in a two-week repeat dose inhalation toxicity 
study in rats.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Applicant  provided  an  environmental  risk  assessment  in  accordance  with  the  “Guideline  on  the 
environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use”  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr  2). 
The PEC values in Phase I for all active ingredients (beclometasone dipropionate (BDP), formoterol fumarate 
dihydrate  (FF),  and  glycopyrronium  bromide  (GB))  are  below  the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/l.  For  the  active 
substances  FF  and  GB  no  assessment  in  Phase  II  Tier  A  is  required.  BDP  and  its  active  metabolite 
beclometasone  monopropionate  (B17MP)  are  glucocorticoids.  Glucocorticoids  play  a  role  in  many 
physiological  processes  and  act  as  endocrine  disruptors.  Therefore,  according  to  the  EMA  guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  a  tailored  environmental  risk  assessment  strategy  should  be  followed  to 
address its specific mechanism of action irrespective of the action limit of 0.01 µg/l. 
The  Applicant  provided  acceptable  experimental  values  on  log  KOW  of  -0.02  and  -1.35  for  FF  and  GB, 
respectively.  No  further  PBT  assessment  is  required.  For  B17MP  an  experimental  value  of  3.49  is  available 
and accepted by the assessor. The potential to bioaccumulate should be considered in Phase II Tier B for this 
active ingredient (see below).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamics 
The  non-clinical  pharmacological  studies  conducted  by  the  Applicant  with  the  combination  of  GB  and  CHF 
1535  (BDP+formoterol)  provide  support  for  the  concept  that  the  triple  combination  CHF  5993  displays 
increased efficacy/potency versus bronchoconstriction and airway hyper-responsiveness induced by different 
challenges.  Taken  together,  these  studies  support  the  concept  that  the  application  of  the  LAMA  GB  in 
combination  with  the  established,  clinically  efficacious  BDP+FF  (ICS  +  LABA)  combination  may  have  the

potential to provide an additional benefit for the treatment of COPD patients, when compared with the single 
components (as to be verified by clinical data). 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
The  Applicant  has  not  provided  any  data.  Taking  into  account  that  secondary  pharmacodynamic  effects  of 
BDP,  FF  and  GB  have  been  evaluated  clinically  and  are  well-documented  in  published  literature,  this  is 
considered acceptable. 
Safety pharmacology 
Effects of CHF 5993 on cardiovascular and respiratory function in telemetered dogs 
In  accordance  with  the  known  systemic  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  ß-adrenoceptor  agonists  (LABA)  and 
muscarinic  antagonists  (LAMA),  in  a  safety  pharmacology  inhalation  study  in  telemetered  Beagle  dogs,  the 
cardiovascular  system  was  the  major  target  system  for  acute  effects  of  CHF  5993.  A  significant  increase  in 
heart  rate  and  a  significant  decrease  in  blood  pressure  was  observed  for  all  CHF  5993  treated  groups, 
including  the  low-dose  group  (33+2+7  µg/kg  BDP+FF+GB),  and  additional  ECG  changes,  including  a  dose-
dependent  increase  of  sinus  and  ventricular  tachycardia,  ventricular  premature  contractions  and  1st  to  2nd 
degree atrio-ventricular block were observed for the mid and high doses. 
According to a safety margin calculation, based either on an allometric dose conversion (see Table 6) or on 
systemic  exposure  to  the  active  components  of  CHF  5993  (see  Table  7),  the  low  CHF  5993  dose  would 
correspond  to  about  3  to 5  times  respectively  1.2  to  3  times  the  proposed  human  daily  dose  of  CHF  5993, 
when considering the margins for FF and GB only (acute CV effects of CHF 5993 are expected to be mainly 
due to the pharmacological activity of the β 2-adrenergic and/or anti-muscarinic components). 
Other data 
No additional safety studies of the effects of the CHF 5993 combination on CNS parameters were carried out. 
Since  the  Applicant  provided  results  from  safety  pharmacology  studies  on  GB  and  CHF  1535  (BDP+FF), 
demonstrating no adverse CNS effects, this approach is considered acceptable.  
Pharmacokinetics 
In  vitro  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  performed  to  investigate  potential  drug-drug  interactions  of  GB  and 
CHF  1535,  no  new  in  vivo  PK  studies  are  presented  for  CHF  1535,  but  a  more  extensive  PK  package  is 
presented for GB.  
The  individual  components  of  CHF  5993  are  rapidly  absorbed  following  inhalation  administration  with  Tmax 
reached in ≈ 1 hour and elimination half-lives of the components between 1-10 hours with little evidence of 
accumulation in rats and only slight accumulation in dogs (AUC week 13/day 1 ratios ranged 0.57-1.9). There 
was no significant change to drug exposure following combination administration relative to administration of 
CHF  1535  or  GB  alone  (GB  exposure  was  slightly  lower  in  combination  relative  to  single  administration  in 
rats, but this effect was not seen in dogs). 
No  human  specific  metabolite  was  found  following  incubation  of  GB  with  liver  microsomes  and  hepatocytes 
from  different  species.  The  main  metabolic  pathway  for  GB  is  cyclopentyl  ring  hydroxylation  and  hydroxyl 
group oxidation on the mandelic acid moiety with simultaneous cyclopentyl ring elimination. 
BDP  is  rapidly  hydrolysed  to  its  main  active  metabolite  B17MP  and  to  B21MP  that  are  subsequently 
transformed into the pharmacologically inactive alcohol derivatives (BOH).  
Assessment report

FF metabolism involves O-glucuronidation, with the phenolic glucuronide as primary metabolite in rats, dogs 
and humans.  
In  vitro  studies  suggest  that  GB  has  low  potential  for  drug-drug  interactions  at  clinically  relevant 
concentrations.  
Toxicology 
The safety program for CHF 5993 is based on the toxicology program for the previously approved CHF 1535 
(BDP+FF) combination and a full set of toxicology studies for GB. In addition, bridging studies with the CHF 
5993  combination  have  been  performed.  All  pivotal  studies  (with  the  exception  of  the  single  dose  toxicity 
studies) were GLP compliant. It should be noted that bridging studies conducted with CHF 5993 use a higher 
GB  dose  (25  μg)  than  the  proposed  clinical  product  (12.5  μg).  This  is  considered  adequate  to  support  this 
MAA.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
4- and 13-week inhalation toxicity studies with CHF 5993 in dogs and rats 
Thymus, heart, liver and adrenals were identified as primary target organs in both rats and dogs in the 13-
week  inhalation  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  with  a  6  week  recovery  period.  Rats  appeared  to  be  highly 
sensitive  to  systemic  pharmacological  (corticosteroid)  effects  of  BDP/B17MP  in  consequence  a  NOAEL  could 
not  be  established  in  this  species.  In  dogs,  cardiovascular  effects  (e.g.  an  increase  in  heart  rate),  likely 
related  to  the  systemic  pharmacological  activity  of  FF  (ß2-adrenergic)  and/or  GB  (anti-muscarinic), 
represented prominent findings.  
Overall,  the  toxicological profile of the triple combination  reflected that of the single components  without a 
relevant  quantitative  increase  in  toxicity  and  without  unexpected  findings.  For  this  reason,  chronic  toxicity 
studies of longer duration were not conducted by the Applicant, which is considered acceptable. 
For  the  rat  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies,  exposure-based  safety  margins  for  the  designated  LOAELs  are 
generally  covering  the  proposed  human  dose (i.e.  safety  margins  are  >  1)  for  all  the  active  components  of 
CHF 5993 (see Tables 8 and 10). 
Similarly,  for  the  dog  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies,  the  designated  NOAELs  provide  safety  margins  that 
generally  cover  the  proposed  human  dose  for  the  active  components  of  CHF  5993,  only  the  systemic 
exposure for B17MP was lower than the expected exposure in man at the proposed clinical dose (see Tables 9 
and 11). 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with GB 
When administered alone, GB appears to be well tolerated in rats and dogs with mydriasis, a slight increase 
in HR (both directly related to its anti-muscarinic mechanism of action) and a slight decrease in body weight 
gain,  being  the  only  reported  effects  following  inhalation  dosing  for  up  to  13  weeks  in  repeat-dose  toxicity 
studies and for up to 104 weeks in the long-term carcinogenicity study conducted with GB in rats. 
Genotoxicity 
Both  GB  and  CHF  1535  were  negative  for  mutagenicity  in  the  bacterial  Ames  test,  and  did  not  produce 
chromosomal  damage  in  in  vitro  chromosome  aberration  tests  performed  in  human  lymphocyte  cells  and 
were negative in in vivo micronucleus assays performed in rats. The lack of any genotoxicity data for the CHF 
5993  combination  product  is  acceptable  given  the  lack  of  genotoxic  activity  exhibited  by  the  single 
components. 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 38/90 
  
  
 
Carcinogenicity 
No long term carcinogenicity studies were conducted on the CHF 5993 combination. However, in a 104-week 
rat  inhalation  carcinogenicity  study  and  an  oral  26-week  carcinogenicity  in  transgenic  Tg.rasH2  mice 
performed  by  the  Applicant,  GB  showed  no  carcinogenic  potential  and  published  data  concerning  long  term 
studies conducted with BDP and FF in rats do also not indicate a clinically relevant carcinogenic potential. 
Reproductive toxicity 
Only  one  species  was  used  to  investigate  the  effect  of  CHF  5993  administration  on  embryo/foetal 
development.  This  is  considered  acceptable  as  the  effects  of  the  individual  components  of  CHF  5993  on 
embryo/foetal  development  have  previously  been  characterised,  and  the  potential  corticosteroid  related 
foetal toxicity has been previously reported. 
The  effects  of  CHF  5993  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development,  embryo-foetal  development  and  on 
the  pre-  and  post-natal  development  were  studied  in  rats  following  oral  administration.  Toxicokinetic 
evaluation  for  CHF  5993  was  performed  in  a  separate  dose-range  finding  and  toxicokinetic  study  with  CHF 
5993.  Furthermore,  embryo-foetal  developmental  studies  with  glycopyrronium  alone  in  rats  and  rabbits 
together with dose-range-findings and toxicokinetic studies in both species were also submitted. 
The effects seen in reproduction toxicity studies for CHF 5993 were generally similar to those reported for the 
single agents. However some effects occurred at exposure levels of the single components which were similar 
or even lower than the human exposure at the therapeutic dose and should be regarded as clinical relevant. 
At  higher  doses,  CHF  5993  was  shown  to  exhibit  a  slight  disturbance  in  development  in  the  embryo-foetal 
development study; this is most likely a corticosteroid-related effect. 
The  high  mortality  and  the  difficulties  with  birth  seen  in  the  pre-postnatal  developmental  study  with  CHF 
5993 in the 2 mg/kg dose group is probably linked to the known effects of the β2-sympathomimetic FF and is 
consistent  with  that  previously  seen  with  Foster  (BDP+FF  –  ratio  100+6)  in  the  rat  pre-postnatal 
development  study.  Also,  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  antimuscarinic  effects  of  GB  such  as  dry  mouth  or 
tachycardia  could  have  compounded  the  tocolytic  effects  of  FF  and  contributed  to  worsening  the  general 
health of the dams. The exposure levels at the NOAEL for FF and GB were below the human exposure levels 
at the recommended therapeutic dose of Trimbow in COPD patients and thus these effects may be of clinical 
relevance.  Adequate  information  has  been  introduced  in  sections  4.6  and  5.3  of  the  SmPC  to  mention  that 
also the anti-muscarinic effects of GB may contribute to the effects seen in pregnant rats in the late phase of 
gestation and early phase of lactation and the loss of pups. 
Local tolerance 
In  repeat  dose  inhalation  toxicity  studies  with  CHF  5993  in  rats  and  dogs  of  up  to  13  weeks  duration,  no 
signs  of  lung  irritation  were  seen  up  to  the  highest  doses  administered.  A  calculation  of  safety  margins  for 
CHF  5993,  based  on  the  local  exposure  of  the  alveolar  epithelium  in  the  animal  studies  and  in  the  clinical 
situation, provided values > 1 for all active components of CHF 5993, indicating an adequate exposure of the 
animals in the repeat dose toxicity studies to BDP, FF and GB (see Tables 12 and 13). 
Other studies 
Immunotoxicity 
There is no specific immunotoxic alert on the single components of CHF 5993 (BDP, FF, GB). Nevertheless, a 
measurement  of  anti-sheep  red  blood  cell  (anti-SRBC)  IgM  titers  (primary  immune  response)  was 
performed during the 4-week inhalation repeat dose study in rats to assess potential immunotoxicity. Besides 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 39/90 
  
  
 
an  increase  in  the  mean  anti-SRBC  IgM  titers  of  male  rats  treated  with  a  GB  dose  of  238  µg/kg/day  no 
relevant findings were observed. 
Impurities 
The Applicant conducted an additional toxicological qualification for the BDP metabolite BDP epoxide, which 
was shown to be negative for mutagenicity in a bacterial Ames test, does not induce chromosomal 
aberrations in vitro in human lymphocytes and does not induce chromosomal damage as assessed in an in 
vivo test for micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) in mouse bone marrow.  
FF related impurities PMA, formoterol ethanolate and deformilate at 2%, 2% and 1% of FF dose respectively 
were not found to alter toxicological parameters following 13 week inhalation in rats. Furthermore, none of 
these impurities was associated with mutagenicity as assessed in a bacterial Ames test and neither PMA nor 
formoterol ethanolate were found to produce chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes.  
GB related impurity CHF5463 was not mutagenic in an in vitro Ames test. It was not associated with any 
toxicity additional to that observed by GB when tested in the two-week repeat dose inhalation toxicity study 
in rat. 
Environmental risk assessment 
Regarding  the  specific  mode  of  action  of  B17MP,  the  Applicant  provided  a  chronic  Fish  Full  Life-Cycle  study 
covering development and reproduction of Fathead Minnows (Pimephales promelas). The performance of the 
test  is  acceptable  and  valid.  In  conclusion,  a  PEC/PNEC  risk  quotient  of  0.14  can  be  derived  considering  a 
NOEC of 0.13 µgl-1 and a PEC value for B17MP of 0.0018 µgl-1. It is considered that caused by the specific 
mechanism  of  action  an  Algae  Toxicity  Test  (OECD  201)  and  a  Daphnids  Reproduction  Test  (OECD  211)  as 
well  as  a  Sediment  Organism  Test  with  invertebrates  (e.g.  OECD  218)  can  be  waived  as  the  Fish  Full  Life-
Cycle Test is considered the appropriate effect study for ERA. 
However, a fate assessment should also be included to conclude on the behaviour of the active substance in 
the  natural  environment.  Thus  the  Applicant  agreed  with  the  CHMP  request  to  commit  to  provide  a  test  on 
transformation  in  water  –  sediment  systems  (OECD  308)  if  the  substance  is  not  readily  biodegradable  in 
accordance with OECD 301.  
Furthermore,  the  log  KOW  of  B17MP  is  above  3,  which  requires  the  consideration  of  the  bioconcentration 
factor in fish. The Applicant committed also to provide an experimental study of BCF in fish according to TG 
OECD 305 in the post approval setting. 
For GB and FF no detailed environmental risk assessment is considered necessary because the action limit in 
Phase  I  is  not  exceeded.  Further  PBT  assessment  is  not  necessary.  The  ERA  for  these  two  ingredients  is 
completed. 
As a result of the above considerations for the active ingredient, the available data do not allow to conclude 
definitively on the potential risk of BDP. Upon request of CHMP, the Applicant commits to provide the missing 
data  on  fate  and  bioconcentration  by  the  end  of  the  year  2018.  This  is  accepted.  A  respective  letter  of 
agreement has been provided, including an expected time schedule. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
In accordance with the EMA “GL on the non-clinical development of fixed combinations of medicinal products” 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP//258498/2005), the Applicant has submitted nonclinical pharmacological, pharmacokinetic 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 40/90 
  
  
 
and toxicological study data for the CHF 5993 triple combination as applicable. In addition, the Applicant has 
provided additional nonclinical studies for GB, including a long-term and a short-term carcinogenicity study, 
as recommended by the EMA in a scientific advice given in 2013.  
Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  provided  adequate evidence to  support  the  concept that the 
combination  of  the  LAMA  GB  with  the  established  BDP+FF  (ICS  +  LABA)  combination  (CHF  1535)  may 
provide  an  additional  benefit  for  the  treatment  of  COPD  patients,  when  compared  with  the  single 
components. 
From the pharmacokinetic point of view, both rat and dog were identified as relevant species for non-clinical 
testing.  
Overall,  the  toxicology  programme  for  CHF  5993  revealed  no  unexpected  toxicity  based  on  conventional 
studies  of  safety  pharmacology  and  repeat  dose  toxicity  and  this  information  was  included  in  SmPC  section 
5.3.  The  reproductive  toxicity  studies  suggest  that  CHF  5993  may  be  associated  with  reproductive  toxicity 
and  administration  to  pregnant  women  should  only  be  considered  when  the  potential  benefits  outweigh  the 
risks to the foetus. Appropriate warnings have been included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
The non-clinical data provided is considered acceptable. 
The  CHMP  recommended  that  tests  for  fate  assessment  and  for  the  study  on  bioconcentration  of  BDP  in 
accordance with TG OECD 305 should be conducted post-approval. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical programme of CHF 5993 pMDI in COPD included: 
•  Studies  of  the  single  GB  entity,  which  has  been  developed  as  two  different  strengths  (i.e.  GB  12.5 
pMDI  and  GB  25  pMDI)  to  mirror  the  GB  component  and  formulation  in  CHF  5993  pMDI  and  to 
appropriately evaluate the LAMA component of the triple FDC (see Table below); 
•  Studies conducted on the TRIPLE combination CHF 5993 pMDI in healthy subjects (Table below) and 
in COPD patients (Table below). 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
A routine GCP inspection of the clinical study Triple 5 was to verify compliance with ICH GCP and applicable 
regulations (GCP/2016/036). The sites selected for the inspection were: site 38503 – PI Francesco Mazza – 
Italy; site 203511 – PI Ilona Pavlislova – Czech Republic and the Sponsor Chiesi Farmaceutici SpA. Based on 
the  inspection  and  the  findings  observed  it  can  be  concluded  that  study  TRIPLE  5  has  generally  been 
conducted  by  the  two  sites  in  compliance  with  GCP  and  internationally  accepted  ethical  standards.  The 
deficiencies  observed  do  not  pose  a  risk  for  patients  or  data  quality  (Integrated  Inspection  Report,  dated  8 
May 2017).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
• 
Introduction 
As the pharmacokinetics of BDP and FF is known, the primary purpose of the clinical PK programme was to 
characterise  the  PK  profiles  of  GB  as  single  monotherapy  and  to  rule  out  any  PK  interactions  between  the 
individual components of CHF 5993.  
Six clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to characterise the PK profiles of BDP/B17MP, FF and  GB. 
In  addition, two Phase  II  studies (studies GLYCO 2 and CARSAF) and one  Phase III study (study TRIPLE 6) 
also assessed the PK of the active components of CHF 5993 pMDI. PK data from study TRIPLE 6 were pooled 
with those from study CARSAF and subjected to a population PK analysis. 
The formulation CHF 5993 100/6/25 pMDI with a higher GB dose (25 µg/actuation) was used as a treatment 
to allow a more reliable estimation of GB plasma concentration vs. time in four PK studies (study TRIPLE 2, 
study TRIPLE 4, study TRIPLE 10 and study TRIPLE 12).  
In  addition,  the  applicant  has  developed  CHF  5259,  a  GB  pMDI  formulation,  as  a  single  agent.  This 
formulation  was  developed  at  two  GB  strengths:  12.5  µg/actuation  (referred  to  as  GB  12.5  pMDI)  and  25 
µg/actuation (also referred to as GB 25 pMDI). These two GB strengths allowed single-dose administration of 
GB at total dose of 100 µg in studies GLYCO 1, TRIPLE 1 and TRIPLE 2 as well as a total GB dose range up to 
100 µg in studies CARSAF and TRIPLE 3, and up to 200 µg in study GLYCO 2.  
•  Absorption 
Study GLYCO 1 was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics, the absolute bioavailability and the lung 
bioavailability  of  single  dose  GB  in  healthy  subjects.  GB  Cmax  and  AUC0-30min  were  similar  following 
administration with or without charcoal block with 90% CI of the ratio of geometric means of 85 – 123% and 
92  -  124%,  respectively,  indicating  that  the  rate  of  lung  absorption  of  GB  was  comparable  with  the  two 
treatment  procedures.  The  overall  systemic  exposure  was  slightly  decreased  using  the  charcoal  block  as 
indicated  by  the  90%  CI  of  the  ratio  of  geometric means  of  104-149%  for  AUC0-t  and  99-153%  for  AUC0-
24h.  The  mean  lung  bioavailability  of  GB  was  10.5%  (with  activated  charcoal  blockage)  while  the  mean 
absolute bioavailability was 12.8% (without activated charcoal blockage). 
The  mean  elimination  half-life  of  GB  in  healthy  volunteers  was  approximately  6  hours  after  a  GB  single  i.v. 
injection. 40% of the dose was excreted in the urine within 24 hours (study GLYCO 1). 
Study  GLYCO  2  (part  2)  was  conducted  to  investigate  the  pharmacokinetics of  repeated  inhalation  of doses 
ranging  from  12.5  to  50  µg  twice  daily  in  COPD  patients.  GB  showed  linear  pharmacokinetics  with  little 
systemic  accumulation  at  steady-state  (median  accumulation  ratio  was  2.2  to  2.5).  Steady  state  plasma 
concentrations  were  reached  within  6  days  of  treatment,  as  indicated  by  similar  pre-dose  levels  on  Days  6 
and 7. 
Study TRIPLE 2 was conducted to evaluate the PK and biopharmaceutical interactions between GB 25 pMDI 
and Foster pMDI, administered as free combination, and as CHF 5993 pMDI in healthy subjects. Absence of 
biopharmaceutical  interaction  between  CHF  5993  pMDI  components  was  demonstrated  for  BDP/B17MP  and 
FF since the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of adjusted geometric means for Cmax and AUC0-t 
Assessment report  
Trimbow

were  within  the  bioequivalence  limits  of  80-125%.  Only  GB  systemic  exposure  (AUC0-t)  was  slightly 
increased (by 13%, 90% CI 98.60 - 130.48%) after administration of CHF 5993 100/6/25 pMDI compared to 
the free combination.  
The  effects  of  the  AeroChamber  Plus  Flow-Vu  VHC  spacer  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  in 
COPD  patients  was  investigated  in  study  TRIPLE  4.  The  use  of  spacer  and  holding  chamber  devices  can 
eliminate  the  issues  associated  with  inadequate  inhalation  technique  by  minimizing  coordination  difficulties, 
reducing oropharyngeal deposition and increasing lung deposition. This is most important in pMDIs containing 
corticosteroids  since  oropharyngeal  deposition  of  inhaled  corticosteroids  may  lead  to  oral  absorption  and 
contribute  to  local  side  effects,  including  pharyngeal  candidiasis,  dysphonia  as  well  as  systemic  side  effects 
such as hypothalamic pituitary adrenal suppression. 
Inhalation  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  with  the  spacer  AeroChamber  Plus™  resulted  in  an  increase  in  GB  lung 
exposure  (Cmax  and  AUC0-30min)  and  total  exposure  (AUC0-t).  GB  Cmax,  AUC  0-30min  and  AUC0-t  were 
higher  after  inhalation  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  with  spacer  compared  to  inhalation  without  spacer,  with  point 
estimates (90% CI) of the ratios of 160.4% (131.5-195.7%), 160.0% (133.9-191.1%) and 144.8% (127.4-
164.6%), respectively.  
For FF and B17MP an increase in lung exposure (Cmax and AUC0-30min) and in a decrease in total exposure 
(AUC0-t)  were  observed.  The  effects  of  the  AeroChamber  Plus™  spacer  on  B17MP  and  formoterol  PK 
observed  in  study  TRIPLE  4  are  in  line  with  previous  PK  data  obtained  after  inhalation  of  Foster  100/6µg 
pMDI with the same spacer. The spacer AeroChamber Plus™ is already approved for use with Foster 100/6µg 
pMDI.  
•  Distribution 
In  study  GLYCO  1,  the  apparent  volume  of  distribution  (Vz)  of  inhaled  GB  was  increased  compared  to 
intravenous (i.v.) infusion (6420 L versus 323 L), reflecting the slower elimination after inhalation. 
•  Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism studies showed GB hydrolysis to be a minor and negligible metabolic route. CYP2D6 was 
found  to  be  the  only  enzyme  responsible  for  GB  metabolism.  After  intra-tracheal  administration,  oral 
administration and inhalation of GB in male rats, CHF 6006, an acidic metabolite arising from ester hydrolysis 
of GB, was detected in the systemic circulation.  
The PK profile of CHF 6006 was assessed in study TRIPLE 12 in healthy volunteers. CHF 6006 was detected in 
plasma, with a systemic exposure of the same order of magnitude as GB.  
CHF 6006 is devoid of any activity against muscarinic receptors. 
•  Elimination 
The  mean  elimination  half-life  of  GB  in  healthy  volunteers  was  approximately  6  hours  after  a  GB  single  i.v. 
injection. 40% of the dose was excreted in the urine within 24 hours (study GLYCO 1). 
In  COPD  patients  receiving  repeated  twice  daily  administration  of  inhaled  GB  mean  elimination  half-life 
ranged from 5 to 12 hours at steady state. The fraction of the dose excreted in urine ranged from 13.0% to 
14.5% at steady state (study GLYCO 2 Part 2).  
Mean  renal  clearance  was  similar  across the  range  of  doses  tested  and  after  single  and  repeated inhalation 
(range 281-396 mL/min).

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality of GB has been investigated in study GLYCO 2 Part 2 Time dependency of GB has been 
investigated in study GLYCO 1 and GLYCO 2 Part 2. 
•  Special populations 
PK, safety and tolerability of CHF 5993 pMDI in subjects with impaired renal function has been investigated in 
study  TRIPLE  10.  Systemic  exposure  (AUC0-t)  to  B17MP  and  FF  was  not  affected  by  mild  to  severe  renal 
impairment. For GB, there was no impact in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. However, an 
increase in total systemic exposure of up to 2.5-fold was observed in subjects with severe renal impairment 
(GFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), as a consequence of a significant reduction of the amount excreted in urine 
(approximately 90% reduction of GB renal clearance). Results from study TRIPLE 10 supports the conclusion 
and the recommendations made in the SmPC regarding the fact that use of CHF 5993 in patients with severe 
renal  impairment  or  end-stage  renal  disease  requiring  dialysis  be  considered  only  if  the  expected  benefit 
outweighs the potential risk (see SmPC section 4.2). 
Specific  clinical  studies  have  not  been  conducted  for  CHF  5993  pMDI  in  patients  with  impaired  hepatic 
function  since  GB  is  predominantly  cleared  by  renal  excretion.  Thus,  mild  or  moderate  impairment  of  the 
hepatic  metabolism  of  GB  is  not  thought  to  result  in  a  clinically  relevant  increase  of  its  systemic  exposure. 
Nevertheless, since no relevant data on the use of CHF 5993 in patients with severe hepatic impairment are 
available, CHF 5993 should be used with caution in these patients and potential adverse reactions should be 
monitored.  Appropriate  recommendations  and  warnings  have  been  incorporated  into  the  SmPC  (see  section 
4.2 and section 4.4). 
A  specific  PK  study  to  evaluate  a  difference  in  PK  due  to  gender,  body  weight  and  age  has  not  been 
conducted.  
In the population PK analysis with PK data from studies TRIPLE 6 and CARSAF, gender and age was not found 
to be a significant covariate of B17MP, FF and GB. No dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients (65 
years of age and older). Body weight, however, was found to be a significant covariate of B17MP, FF and GB. 
In  COPD  patients  with  very  low  body  weight  (i.e.  less  than  40  kg)  and  with  concomitant  severe  renal 
impairment (i.e. GFR below 27 mL/min/1.73 m²), a dose adjustment would be indicated. 
• 
Interactions 
Study  TRIPLE  1  investigated  the  pharmacokinetic  interaction  of  GB  and  FF  by  comparing  the  systemic 
exposure  after  a  single  dose  of  the  free  combination  of  CHF  5259  and  Atimos  to  that  of  the  single 
components. Study TRIPLE 2 was conducted to evaluate the PK interactions between GB 25 pMDI and Foster 
pMDI,  administered  separately,  and  as  free  combination.  The  PK  interaction  was  investigated by  comparing 
the  systemic  exposure  in  terms  of  Cmax  and  AUC0-t,  between  FosterFoster  +  GB  and  Foster  and  between 
Foster + GB and GB. Both studies have demonstrated a similar plasma concentration profile for GB and FF as 
well as for BDP/B17MP, FF and GB.  
Study TRIPLE 12 evaluated the extent of the drug–drug interaction between CHF 5993 and the OCT2/MATE1 
inhibitor cimetidine. Co-administration of CHF 5993 pMDI with Cimetidine resulted in a slight increase of the 
total GB AUC0-t by 16% and of Cmax by 26% compared with the administration of CHF 5993 pMDI alone. FF 
AUC0-t  showed  also  an  increase  after  co-administration  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  with  Cimetidine  by  21%,  while 
Cmax  as  well  as  tmax  were  not  influenced  by  Cimetidine.  Based  on  the  magnitude  of  the  observed  PK 
Assessment report  
Trimbow

changes  for  GB  and  FF,  no  clinically  relevant  drug  interaction  is  expected  when  CHF  5993  pMDI  is  co-
administered with cimetidine.  
Appropriate information has been included in the SmPC section 4.5. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
•  Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new studies investigating the pharmacodynamics of BDP, a synthetic corticosteroid, and FF, a long-acting 
beta2 receptor agonist, have been conducted as the PD of these actives are well known. 
GB  is  a  high-affinity,  long-acting  muscarinic  receptor  antagonist  (anticholinergic)  used  for  inhalation  as 
bronchodilator  treatment  of  COPD.  A  greater  than  4-fold  selectivity  for  the  human  M3  receptors  over  the 
human  M2  receptor  has  been  demonstrated.  Parasympathetic  nerves  are  the  major  bronchoconstrictive 
neural pathway in airways, and cholinergic tone is a key reversible component of airflow obstruction in COPD. 
GB works by blocking the bronchoconstrictor action of acetylcholine on airway smooth muscle cells, thereby 
dilating the airways. 
The applicant has conducted a cardiac safety study  (CARSAF) in COPD patients to investigate the effects of 
GB on other PD parameters (e.g. heart rate, QT interval, and blood pressure). The aim of the study was to 
evaluate the variation of a selected set of cardiovascular parameters induced by Foster plus two dosages of 
GB  (daily  dose  50  or  100μg)  compared  to  Foster  alone  (daily  dose  400/24)  in  moderate  to  severe  patients 
with COPD. The mean 24-hour heart rate slightly decreased from baseline to day 14 in all treatment groups. 
ECG parameters (including QTcF interval) were comparable in the three groups at both the first and the last 
day  of  study  treatment.  The  mean  heart  rate,  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  did  not  substantially 
change from pre- to post-dose at baseline, day 7 and day 14 in the three treatment groups. 
Six clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to characterise the profiles of BDP/FF/GB delivered by CHF 
5993 pMDI. The design and methodology of these studies were considered appropriate.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  studies  investigated  the  PK  and  the  absolute  and  lung  bioavailability  of  inhaled  GB  25  pMDI  with  or 
without charcoal block in healthy subjects (study GLYCO 1) and demonstrated low oral bioavailability of the 
GB  component  of  CHF  5993.  There  was  little  or  no  interaction  between  GB  and  FF  after  administration  of 
single doses of the free combination GB 25 pMDI + FF 12 µg pMDI or single dose of the single components in 
healthy subjects (study TRIPLE 1). The PK and biopharmaceutical interactions between GB 25 pMDI and CHF 
1535 pMDI, administered separately, as a free combination or as the FDC CHF 5993 pMDI in healthy subjects 
(study TRIPLE 2) did not suggest a clinically meaningful interaction.  
The  PK  of  CHF  5993  was  investigated  with  special  focus  on  GB,  after  a  single  dose  in  subjects  with  renal 
impairment  compared  to  healthy  subjects  and  showed  increasing  exposure  with  decline  in  renal  function 
(study  TRIPLE  10).  Use  of  CHF  5993  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  or  end-stage  renal  disease 
requiring  dialysis  should  be  considered  only  if  the  expected  benefit  outweighs  the  potential  risk.  Since  no 
relevant  data  on  the  use  of  CHF  5993  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  are  available,  CHF  5993 
should be used with caution in these patients and potential adverse reactions should be monitored. In COPD 
patients with very low body weight (i.e. less than 40 kg) and with severe renal impairment (i.e. GFR below 
27 mL/min/1.73 m²), a dose adjustment would be indicated. 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 48/90 
  
  
 
There was no substantial PK interaction between CHF 5993 active components and cimetidine (an inhibitor of 
the  organic  cation  transport  in  kidneys),  with  special  focus  on  GB  (study  TRIPLE  12).  In  addition,  the 
population PK analysis performed on PK data from studies CARSAF and TRIPLE 6 showed no DDI between GB 
and  the  medications  most  frequently  taken  by  COPD  patients  (enalapril,  lisinopril,  ramipril,  bisoprolol, 
amlodipine, losartan, valsartan and atorvastatin). 
The  effect  of  the  AeroChamber  spacer  on  the  PK  of  the  CHF  5993  active  components  after  a  single  dose 
administered using the standard actuator with or without AeroChamber in patients with moderate to severe 
COPD (study TRIPLE 4) showed greater exposure to GB with use of the spacing device. However, for GB, no 
safety signals have been observed in studies GLYCO 2 and CARSAF in which GB was administered at supra-
therapeutic doses (i.e. up to 200 µg in study GLYCO 2 and at 100 µg in study CARSAF), suggesting that a 2-
fold increase in GB exposure is unlikely to result in (cardiovascular) safety concerns. 
Study  CARSAF  was  the  principal  evaluation  of  the  secondary  pharmacology  on  Trimbow.  The  PK  profiles  of 
CHF  5993  active  components  were  evaluated  after  administration  of  CHF  1535  (Foster)  alone  and  in 
combination with GB pMDI at total daily dose of 50 µg (therapeutic dose) or 100 µg (supra-therapeutic dose) 
in  moderate  to  severe  COPD  patients.  Co-administration  was  well  tolerated  and  did  not  raise  any 
cardiovascular signals of concern. 
The pharmacodynamics properties of GB are adequately explored. No further studies to evaluate the potential 
for corrected QT interval (QTc) are considered to be necessary.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CHF 5993 has been sufficiently characterised to support this 
application.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
• 
Introduction 
The clinical programme of CHF 5993 pMDI in COPD included three Phase II (studies GLYCO 2, TRIPLE 3 and 
CARSAF), one Phase IIb (study TRIPLE 9) and two Phase III clinical studies (studies TRIPLE 5 and 6). Studies 
GLYCO 2 and TRIPLE 3 were dose finding studies which assessed the efficacy and safety of different GB doses 
alone or in combination with Foster. Study TRIPLE 9 further investigated the longer term (4 weeks) efficacy 
and safety of GB in the target population at the selected dose. Studies TRIPLE 5 and TRIPLE 6 were pivotal 
efficacy and safety studies for the FDC. 
2.5.1.  Dose-response studies  
The proposed daily dosing for the ICS + LABA component (i.e. 400 µg BDP + 24 µg FF) corresponds to the 
dosing of  Foster  currently  approved  for  use  in  patients  with  moderate to  severe  COPD  who  have  significant 
symptoms  despite  regular  bronchodilator  therapy.  The  proposed  daily  dosing  for  the  LAMA  component  (i.e. 
50 µg GB) has been chosen based on the results of studies GLYCO 2 (Part 2) and TRIPLE 3. 
In  study  GLYCO  2  (Part  2)  all  doses  of  GB  (25,  50,  and  100  μg)  were  superior  to  placebo  in  terms  of  the 
primary  efficacy  variable,  trough  FEV1  at  12  h  post-dose  on  Day  7,  and  for  all  secondary  efficacy  variables 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 49/90 
  
  
 
based  on  FEV1  evaluated  on  Days  1,  7,  and  8  of  multiple  dose  administration.  There  was  no  statistically 
significant difference between the 50µg and the 100µg total daily dose for any efficacy variables.  
Study TRIPLE 3 investigated the dose-response of GB 12.5, 25 and 50 mg BID (i.e., total daily doses of 25, 
50 and 100 mg) when added to Foster compared with Foster alone in patients with COPD. The primary and 
secondary endpoint data for FEV1 AUC0-12h and trough values on Days 1 and 7 all show a numerical dose-
response  relationship,  with  12.5  mg  BID  having  the  lowest  numerical  effect  and  50  mg  BID  having  the 
highest numerical effect. The results suggest that the effects of 12.5 mg BID fall below the clinically relevant 
threshold, while the 25 mg BID dose may meet the criteria for the minimally effective dose. The 100µg dose 
of GB (total daily dose) did not show significant advantages versus 50µg dose of GB (total daily dose).  
2.5.2.  Main clinical studies  
Studies TRIPLE 5 and TRIPLE 6 are the two main clinical studies and described below: 
•  Study design 
Study TRIPLE 5  was designed to compare the TRIPLE combination CHF 5993 to Foster, in order to fulfil the 
requirements of the FDC guideline for confirmatory clinical trials, i.e. to demonstrate the efficacy of the FDC 
by parallel group comparisons to a standard of care (SOC) (step-up), thereby demonstrating the contribution 
of the GB component. 
Study TRIPLE 6 was designed to address the requirements of the CHMP COPD Guideline, which recommends 
the  use  of  the  test  product  (CHF  5993)  for  comparison  with  an  established  long-acting  antimuscarinic 
comparator (tiotropium) as per the GOLD guideline. In addition, the CHF 5993 was compared with the open 
combination of Foster plus Tiotropium. 
•  Study participants 
The main inclusion criteria were:  
•  Male  or  female  adults  aged  ≥ 40  years  with  written  informed  consent  obtained  prior  to  any  study-
related procedure; 
• 
Patients  with  a diagnosis of  COPD  (according  to  GOLD  document,  revised  2013)  at  least  12  months 
before screening; 
•  Current  smokers  or  ex-smokers  who  quit  smoking  at  least  6  months  prior  to screening  visit,  with  a 
smoking history of at least 10 pack-years (pack-years = [number of cigarettes per day x number of 
years]/20); 
•  A post-bronchodilator FEV1 <50% of the predicted normal value and a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC 
<0.7, within 30 minutes after 4 puffs (4 x 100 μg) of salbutamol pMDI. If this criterion was not met 
at screening, the test could be repeated once before randomisation visit; 
•  A documented history of at least one exacerbation in the 12 months preceding screening. 
COPD  exacerbation  was  defined  according  to  the  following:  “A  sustained  worsening  of  the  patient’s 
condition (dyspnoea, cough and/or sputum production/purulence), from the stable state and beyond 
normal day-to-day variations, that is acute in onset and necessitates a change in regular medication 
in  a  patient  with  underlying  COPD  that  includes  prescriptions  of  systemic  corticosteroids  and/or 
antibiotics or need for hospitalisation”.

Also  documented  visits  to  an  emergency  department  due  to  COPD  exacerbation  were  considered 
acceptable to fulfil this criterion; 
Patients under double therapy for at least 2 months prior to screening with either: 
ICS/inhaled LABA or; 
ICS/inhaled LAMA or; 
Inhaled LABA and inhaled LAMA or; 
Patients under monotherapy with LAMA for at least 2 months prior to screening;

- 
•  Symptomatic patients at screening with a CAT score ≥ 10; 
• 
In study TRIPLE 5 only: Symptomatic patients at screening with a BDI focal score ≤ 10. This criterion 
had to be confirmed at randomisation (V2, Week 0); 
The main exclusion criteria were: 
•  Diagnosis of asthma or history of allergic rhinitis or atopy (atopy which may have risen contra-
indications or impacted the efficacy of the study treatment according to Investigator’s judgement); 
• 
Patients requiring use of the following medications: 
a.  Systemic steroids for COPD exacerbation in the 4 weeks prior to screening; 
b.  A course of antibiotics for COPD exacerbation longer than 7 days in the 4 weeks prior to screening; 
c.  Phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 inhibitors in the 4 weeks prior to screening; 
d.  Use of antibiotics for a lower respiratory tract infection (e.g. pneumonia) in the 4 weeks prior to 
screening; 
•  COPD exacerbation requiring prescriptions of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or 
hospitalisation during the run-in period; 
•

• 
• 
Patients treated with non-cardio-selective β-blockers in the month preceding screening or during the 
run-in period; 
Patients treated with long-acting anti-histamines unless taken at stable regimen at least 2 months

unstable ischemic heart disease, NYHA Class III/IV, left ventricular failure, acute myocardial 
infarction); 
•  An abnormal and CS 12-lead ECG that resulted in active medical problem which may have impacted 
the safety of the patient according to Investigator’s judgement. 
• 
Patients whose 12-lead ECG showed Fridericia’s corrected QT interval (QTcF) >450 ms for males or 
>470 ms for females at screening or at randomisation were not eligible;

•  Medical diagnosis of narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that 
in the opinion of the Investigator would have prevented use of anti-cholinergic agents; 
In  summary,  the  patient  population  selected  for  both  pivotal  studies  includes  symptomatic  COPD  patients 
with  severe to  very  severe  airflow  limitation  and  with  a  history  of  at  least one  exacerbation in  the previous 
year  (Group  D  patients  according  to  GOLD  classification,  update  2016).  At  least  20%  of  patients  with  very 
severe airflow limitation (i.e. post-bronchodilator FEV1 at screening <30% of predicted normal value) were to 
be randomised in both studies. 
•  Treatments 
The treatments used for both studies can be summarised by the figures below.  
TRIPLE 5 study 
Figure 4 Study design and schedule of visits 
In  study  TRIPLE  5,  Foster  pMDI  was  chosen  as  control  treatment,  as  it  is  currently  marketed  for  the 
treatment of severe COPD patients who have significant symptoms despite bronchodilator therapy.

TRIPLE 6 study 
Figure 5 Study design and schedule of visits 
In study TRIPLE 6, CHF 5993 pMDI was compared to the LAMA Tiotropium alone and to the free combination 
Foster pMDI + Tiotropium. Tiotropium is one of the current first choice treatments for Group D patients and 
therefore  considered  as  a  suitable  comparator  to  test  the  superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  in  terms  of 
moderate/severe exacerbation rate in grade D COPD patients. In addition, the free combination Foster pMDI 
+  Tiotropium  represents  an  alternative  ICS/LABA/LAMA  combination  and  it  was  considered  a  suitable 
comparator to test the non-inferiority of CHF 5993 pMDI in terms of pulmonary function.  
Patients who were used to taking COPD pMDI medications via a spacer had to use the AeroChamber Plus™ 
for  the  study  medication.  As  rescue  medication,  patients  were  permitted  to  use  salbutamol  (100  μg  per 
actuation by pressurised metered dose inhaler), although not within 6 h before a spirometry assessment. 
Objectives 
In  study  TRIPLE  5,  the  triple  combination  CHF  5993  pMDI  was  tested  for  superiority  over  Foster  pMDI  in 
terms  of  pre-dose  and  2-hour  post-dose  FEV1  at  26  weeks.  CHF  5993  was  also  tested  for  superiority  over 
Foster for symptomatic benefit using TDI focal score.  
In  study  TRIPLE  6,  CHF  5993  pMDI  was  tested  for  superiority  over  Tiotropium  in  terms  of  moderate  and 
severe COPD exacerbation rate over 52 weeks of treatment. The key secondary objectives of the study were 
to demonstrate the superiority of CHF 5993 pMDI over Tiotropium and to demonstrate the non-inferiority of 
CHF 5993 pMDI relative to Foster pMDI +Tiotropium, both in terms of pulmonary function pre-dose FEV1 at 
Week 52.

Three  co-primary  endpoints  were  measured:  change  from  baseline  in  predose  morning  FEV1,  change  from 
baseline in 2-h postdose FEV1, and TDI focal score, all assessed at week 26.  
The  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  pre-dose  FEV1  at  all  the  other  clinic  visits  and  averaged  over  the 
treatment period; FEV1 response (change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 ≥ 100 mL) at weeks 26 and 52; 2-
h post-dose FEV1 at all the other clinic visits; TDI focal score at all the other clinic visits and TDI response (a 
focal score of one or more was deemed the MCID) at weeks 26 and 52; SGRQ total score at all clinic visits, 
and SGRQ response (decrease from baseline in total score ≥ 4 was deemed the MCID) at weeks 26 and 52; 
percentage of days without rescue medication use and average number of puffs per day; moderate-to-severe 
COPD  exacerbation  frequency  over  52  weeks  of  treatment;  and  the  time  to  first  moderate-to-severe  COPD 
exacerbation. 
Study TRIPLE 6 
The primary endpoint was the moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation rate over 52 weeks of treatment. The 
change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 at week 52 was defined as a key secondary endpoint. 
The  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  pre-dose  FEV1  at  all  the  other  clinic  visits  and  averaged  over  the 
treatment  period;  FEV1  response  (change  from  baseline  in  pre-dose  FEV1  ≥ 100  mL)  at  weeks  26  and  52; 
pre-dose  IC  at  all  clinic  visits;  SGRQ  total  score  at  all  clinic  visits,  and  SGRQ  response  (decrease  from 
baseline  in  total  score ≥ 4  was  deemed the  MCID)  at  weeks  26  and 52;  moderate  COPD  exacerbation  rate; 
severe COPD exacerbation rate; time to first moderate-to-severe and severe COPD exacerbation; percentage 
of days without rescue medication use and average number of puffs per day.

Sample size 
Study TRIPLE 5 
A total of 1304 patients (652 patients per group) were planned to be randomised in order to reach a total of 
1088 evaluable patients at Week 26 (544 patients per group), considering a non-evaluable rate of 
approximately 16.5% at this time point. Based on the considerations listed below, an overall study power of 
approximately 85% was assured; in particular: 
•  Approximately 97.7% power to detect a mean difference of 60 mL in favour of CHF 5993 pMDI in 
change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming 
an SD of 250 mL; 
•  Approximately 99.6% power to detect a mean difference of 70 mL in favour of CHF 5993 pMDI in 
change from baseline in 2-hour post-dose FEV1 at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming an 
SD of 250 mL;  
•  Approximately 87.1% power to detect a mean difference of 0.6 units in favour of CHF 5993 pMDI in 
TDI focal score at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming an SD of 3.2 units.  
Study TRIPLE 6 
A  total  of  2580  patients  were  planned  to  be  randomised  according  to  a  2:2:1  ratio  to  the  CHF  5993  pMDI 
(1032  patients),  Tiotropium  (1032  patients)  and  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  groups  (516  patients).  A  log-
normal distribution was assumed for drop-out times, with drop-out rates of approximately 13%, 16.5% and 
20%  at  Week  12,  Week  26  and  Week  52,  respectively.  A  percentage  of  completed  and  evaluable  patients 
with major protocol deviations of 9% was assumed. 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 54/90 
  
  
 
Based  on  the  considerations  listed  below,  an  overall  study  power  of  approximately  80%  was  assured;  in 
particular: 
• 
This sample size assured approximately 93.3% power to detect a rate ratio of 0.8 between the CHF 
5993 pMDI and Tiotropium groups at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, using a negative binomial 
model and assuming a rate of 0.9 exacerbations per patient per year in the Tiotropium group and an 
over-dispersion parameter of the negative binomial distribution of 0.56; 
•  At Week 52, 825 evaluable patients per group in the CHF 5993 pMDI and Tiotropium groups provided 
approximately 99.7% power to detect a mean difference of 60 mL in terms of change from baseline 
in FEV1 at a two-sided significance level of 0.05,assuming a SD of 260 mL; 
•  At Week 52, 751 evaluable patients in the CHF 5993 pMDI group and 375 evaluable patients in the 
Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  group  with  no  major  protocol  deviations  assured  approximately  86.0% 
power to demonstrate the non-inferiority of CHF 5993 pMDI relative to Foster pMDI + Tiotropium in 
terms  of  change  from  baseline  in  FEV1  at  a  one-sided  significance  level  of  0.025,  with  a  non-
inferiority margin of -50 mL and assuming no difference between treatments and a SD of 260 mL. 
• 
Randomisation 
Study TRIPLE 5 
A  balanced  block  randomisation  scheme  stratified  by  country  and  severity  of  airflow  limitation  (i.e. 
post-bronchodilator FEV1 at screening <30% or ≥ 30% of predicted normal value) was prepared via a 
computerised  system.  At  least  20%  of  patients  with  very  severe  airflow  limitation  (i.e.  post-
bronchodilator FEV1 at screening <30% of predicted normal value) were randomised in the study. 
Study TRIPLE 6 
A  balanced  block  randomisation  scheme  stratified  by  country  and  severity  of  airflow  limitation  (i.e. 
post-bronchodilator FEV1 at screening < 30% or ≥  30% of the predicted normal value) was prepared 
via  a  computerised  system.  At  least  20%  of  patients  with  very  severe  airflow  limitation  (i.e.  post-
bronchodilator  FEV1  at  screening  <  30%  of  predicted  normal  value)  were  to  be  randomised  in  the 
study.  Patients  were  randomised  according  to  a  2:2:1  ratio  to  the  CHF  5993  pMDI,  Tiotropium  and 
Foster pMDI + Tiotropium groups. 
• 
Blinding 
All study treatments taken during the trial period of both pivotal studies were administered in a double-blind 
manner.  Neither  the  subjects  nor  the  investigators  knew  the  study  medication  assigned  to  a  particular 
subject.  
A  double-dummy  design  was  used  in  study  TRIPLE  6.  Patients  randomised  to  receive  CHF  5993  pMDI  were 
administered Tiotropium matched placebo and patients randomised to receive Tiotropium were administered 
pMDI placebo as detailed here below:

•  Statistical methods 
In study TRIPLE 5, the three co-primary endpoints were all assessed with a linear mixed model for repeated 
measures  (MMRM),  with  data  up  to  discontinuation  included  in  the  analysis  for  withdrawn  patients.  This 
model included treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, country, number of COPD exacerbations in the 
previous  year,  severity  of  airflow  limitation  and  smoking  status  at  screening  as  fixed  effects,  and  baseline 
value and baseline by visit interaction as covariates. To deal with multiplicity, the primary efficacy variables 
were tested in the following pre-specified hierarchical order: (1) pre-dose FEV1; (2) 2-h post-dose FEV1; (3) 
TDI focal score. At each step of the procedure, no confirmatory claims were to be made unless the superiority 
of CHF 5993 over Foster was shown in the preceding steps. Multiplicity was not adjusted for in the analyses 
of the secondary endpoints. Subgroup analyses of the co-primary endpoints were pre-specified, with patients 
grouped  according  to  severity  of  airflow  limitation,  smoking  status,  sex,  reversibility  to  salbutamol,  COPD 
phenotype (chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or mixed), blood eosinophil concentration at screening, and age, 
with TDI also analysed according to presence of cardiovascular comorbidities. Sensitivity analyses were done 
on the three co-primary endpoints to assess the potential effect of missing data. 
The MMRM model targets the hypothetical treatment effect if all patients had adhered ignoring the effect of 
non-adherence.  Discontinuing  patients  were  not  followed-up.  The  applicant  addresses  the  question  on  the 
potential  effect  of  non-adherence  by  using  a  copy  reference  model  and  multiple  imputation  in  addition  to 
BOCF  (baseline  observation  carried  forward,  using  multiple  imputation  for  pre-dose  FEV1  and  single 
imputation for 2-h post-dose FEV1 and TDI). 
In study TRIPLE 6, the comparisons between CHF 5993 pMDI and Tiotropium in terms of the primary and the 
key  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  performed  in  the  ITT  and  PP  (for  sensitivity  purposes)  populations. 
Since  non-inferiority  was  tested,  in  the  comparison  between  CHF  5993  pMDI  and  CHF  1535  pMDI  + 
Tiotropium  in  terms  of  the  key  secondary  efficacy  variable  the  ITT  and  the  PP  populations  had  equal 
importance. 
The  comparisons  between  treatments  were  conducted  according  to  a  hierarchical  testing  procedure.  The 
primary and the key secondary efficacy comparisons were considered in the following order: (1) Superiority 
testing of CHF 5993 pMDI vs. Tiotropium in terms of moderate and severe COPD exacerbation rate over 52 
weeks  of  treatment  (primary  efficacy  variable);  (2)  Superiority  testing  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  vs.  Tiotropium  in 
terms of change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 at Week 52 (key secondary efficacy variable); (3) 
Non-inferiority testing of CHF 5993 pMDI vs. CHF 1535 pMDI + Tiotropium in terms of change from baseline 
in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  at  Week  52  (key  secondary  efficacy  variable).  At  each  step  of  the  procedure,  no 
confirmatory claims were made unless the objectives were met in all the preceding steps. 
The number of moderate and severe COPD exacerbations during the treatment period was analysed using a 
negative binomial  model including  treatment,  country,  number  of  COPD  exacerbations  in the  previous year, 
severity  of  airflow  limitation  and  smoking  status  at  screening  as  fixed  effects,  and  log-time  on  study  as  an 
offset.  Superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over  Tiotropium  was  demonstrated  by  a  statistically  significant  rate 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 56/90 
  
  
 
ratio (defined as p < 0.05) favouring CHF 5993 pMDI. The comparison CHF 5993 pMDI vs. CHF 1535 pMDI + 
Tiotropium was considered as a secondary efficacy analysis. 
In  order  to  assess  the  potential  impact  of  missing  data  on  the  results  of  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  the 
following sensitivity analyses were performed on all randomised patients: missing at random (MAR) and copy 
reference (CHF 1535 pMDI + Tiotropium) multiple imputation (MI). A sensitivity analysis was also performed 
to assess the impact of the differences between severity of airflow limitation recorded in the electronic case 
report form (eCRF) and entered in the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) at randomisation. 
The analysis of the primary efficacy variable was also performed in the ITT population stratifying by severity 
of  airflow  limitation,  smoking  status  at  screening,  gender,  degree  of  reversibility,  main  COPD  phenotype, 
blood eosinophil count at screening, age, number of COPD exacerbations in the 12 months before screening 
and presence/absence of relevant concomitant cardiovascular diseases. 
Results  
• 
Participant flow  
Study TRIPLE 5 ran between March 21, 2014, and Jan 14, 2016. 1812 patients were recruited, of whom 1368 
were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  the  treatment  groups  (687  to  CHF  5993  and  681  to  Foster),  with  602 
(87.6%)  completing  the  study  in  the  CHF  5993  group  and  579  (85.0%) in  the  Foster  group.  Compliance  to 
treatment  was  high,  with  a  median  of  95.6%  of  doses  taken  in  the  CHF  5993  group  and  95.0%  of  doses 
taken in the Foster group.  
Study TRIPLE 6 ran between Jan 21, 2014, and Mar 18, 2016. 3433 patients were recruited, of whom 2691 
were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  the  treatment  groups  (1078  to  CHF  5993,  1075  to  Tiotropium,  538  to 
Foster  +  Tiotropium),  with  986  (91.5%)  completing  the  study  in  the  CHF  5993  group,  914  (85,0%)  in  the 
Tiotropium group and 496 (92.2%) in the Foster + tiotropium group. Throughout the treatment duration, the 
probability of discontinuation was higher in the Tiotropium group than in the CHF 5993 pMDI and Foster pMDI 
+ Tiotropium groups. Compliance to treatment was high, with a median of 94.6% of doses taken in the CHF 
5993  group,  94.3%  of  doses  taken  in  the  Tiotropium  group  and  94.9%  of  doses  taken  in  the  Foster  + 
Tiotropium group.  
The subject disposition in both pivotal studies is generally comparable across the treatment arms. 
Baseline data  
Baseline  characteristics  of  the  recruited  patients  in  the  two  Phase  III  studies  were  comparable  in  terms  of 
demography, lung function and symptoms.  
In study TRIPLE 5, the majority of patients were taking a double therapy of ICS/LABA at study entry: 73.7% 
in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI  group  and  71.6%  in  the  CHF  1535  pMDI  group.  Overall,  the  double  therapy 
LABA/LAMA was taken by 13.8% and 15.7% of patients in the CHF 5993 pMDI and CHF 1535 pMDI groups, 
respectively, LAMA monotherapy was taken by 11.1% and 11.2% of patients, respectively and only 1.5% of 
patients in each group were taking ICS/LAMA. 
In study TRIPLE 6, the majority of patients were taking a double therapy of ICS/LABA at study entry: 74.5% 
in the CHF 5993 pMDI group, 74.7% in the Tiotropium group and 70.4% in the CHF 1535 pMDI + Tiotropium 
group.  Overall,  the  double  therapy  LABA/LAMA  was  taken  by  11.6%,  11.5%  and  13.8%  of  patients  in  the 
Assessment report  
Trimbow

CHF 5993 pMDI, Tiotropium and CHF 1535 pMDI + Tiotropium groups, respectively. LAMA monotherapy was 
taken  by  10.5%,  11.0%  and  12.5%  of  patients,  respectively  and  only  3.4%,  2.8%  and  3.4%  of  patients, 
respectively were taking ICS/LAMA. 
In study TRIPLE 5 more than 80% of patients had at least one concomitant disease, with at least one cardiac 
disorder reported by 36% of patients in the CHF 5993 group and 35% in the Foster group. In study TRIPLE 6 
more than 80% of patients had at least one concomitant disease, with at least one cardiac disorder reported 
by 41% of patients in the CHF 5993 group, 43% in the Tiotropium group and 40% in the Foster + Tiotropium 
group. 
Overall,  the  population  studied  in  these  two  pivotal  studies  were  representative  of  the  general  COPD 
population. 
Study Outcomes 
The  study  results  are  presented  in  tabulated  tables  for  both  studies  below.  The  following  common  efficacy 
variables of the two pivotal Phase III studies TRIPLE 5 and TRIPLE 6 are compared: 
Moderate/severe COPD exacerbation rate (primary efficacy variable in study TRIPLE 6) 
CHF 5993 was found to be superior to both Foster (study TRIPLE 5) and Tiotropium (study TRIPLE 6) in terms 
of the moderate/severe exacerbation rate (Table below). In study TRIPLE 5 there was a 23% reduction in the 
rate  of  moderate/severe  exacerbations  with  CHF  5993  compared  with  Foster  (adjusted  rate  ratio  [95%  CI] 
0.773  [0.647;  0.924],  p=0.005)  while  in  study  TRIPLE  6  there  was  a  20%  reduction  with  CHF  5993 
compared  with  Tiotropium  (0.801  [0.693;  0.925],  p=0.003).  The  moderate/severe  exacerbation  rate  was 
similar  with  the  fixed  combination  of  CHF  5993  and  the  free  combination  of  Foster  +  Tiotropium  in  study 
TRIPLE  6  (1.013  [0.846;  1.214],  p=0.887).  The  moderate/severe  exacerbation  rate  was  similar  in  the  CHF 
5993 groups in both studies.

The  results  of  the  Cox  proportion  hazards  analyses  showed  that  the  time  to  first  moderate/severe 
exacerbation was significantly prolonged with CHF 5993 compared with Foster (study TRIPLE 5, hazard ratio 
[95%  CI]  of  0.803  [0.668;  0.967],  p=0.020)  and  Tiotropium  (study  TRIPLE  6,  0.836  [0.723;  0.966], 
p=0.015), with no difference between CHF 5993 and Foster + Tiotropium (1.055 [0.877; 1.269], p=0.569).  
•  Change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 over time (at Weeks 4, 12, 26 [co primary efficacy 
variable  in  study  TRIPLE  5],  40  and  52  [key  secondary  efficacy  variable  in  study  TRIPLE  6])  and 
averaged over the entire treatment period 
CHF  5993  was  found  to  be  superior  to  both  Foster  (study  TRIPLE  5)  and  Tiotropium  (study  TRIPLE  6)  and 
non-inferior  to  Foster  +  Tiotropium  (study  TRIPLE  6)  in  terms  of  the  change  from  baseline  in  pre-dose 
morning  FEV1  to  both  Week  26  and  Week  52  (Table  below).  The  magnitude  of  the  adjusted  mean  change 
from baseline was similar in the CHF 5993 groups in both studies. The magnitude of the difference between 
CHF 5993 vs. both Foster and Tiotropium after 52 weeks of treatment was similar (adjusted mean difference 
of 0.63 and 0.61, respectively).

CHF 5993 was found to be superior to both Foster (study TRIPLE 5) and Tiotropium (study TRIPLE 6) in terms 
of the change from baseline in SGRQ total score at Week 52 (Table below). The difference between CHF 5993 
and Foster + Tiotropium in study TRIPLE 6 reached statistical significance in favour of Foster + Tiotropium at 
Weeks  26  and  52.  The  magnitude  of  the  difference  between  CHF  5993  vs.  both  Foster  and  Tiotropium  was 
similar (adjusted mean difference of -1.69 and -1.60, respectively).

•  Change from baseline in the percentage of days without rescue medication and average use of rescue 
medication (puffs/day) over time and averaged over the entire treatment period 
At baseline (run-in period), rescue use was lower in patients in study TRIPLE 5 than study TRIPLE 6; in study 
TRIPLE  5  the  percentage  of  days  without  rescue  medication  use  was  33.22%  and  33.88%  in  the  CHF  5993 
and  Foster  groups,  respectively  while  in  study  TRIPLE  6  this  percentage  ranged  from  20.47%  to  21.90% 
Assessment report

across  groups  (Table  below).  Similarly,  the  average  use  of  rescue  medication  was  lower  in  study  TRIPLE  5 
(2.32  and  2.38  puffs/day,  in  the  CHF  5993  and  Foster  groups,  respectively)  than  study  TRIPLE  6  (ranging 
from 2.55 to 2.70 puffs/day across groups).  
There was a greater improvement in rescue medication use (i.e. increase in percentage of rescue free days 
and decrease in average use) from baseline over the entire treatment period with CHF 5993 compared with 
both  Foster  (study  TRIPLE  5)  and  with  Tiotropium  (study  TRIPLE  6).  These  differences  between  treatments 
only reached statistical significance in study TRIPLE 6 (CHF 5993 vs. Tiotropium), where patients were more 
reliant on rescue medication during the run-in period. In study TRIPLE 6,  no differences between CHF 5993 
and Foster + Tiotropium were found. Of note, in study TRIPLE 5 the difference between CHF 5993 and Foster 
did reach statistical significance (in favour of CHF 5993) for all periods up to Week 12 for the percentage of 
rescue free days and for all periods up to Week 26 for the average rescue medication use. In patients treated 
with  CHF  5993,  the  greater  improvement  seen  in  patients  in  study  TRIPLE  6  resulted  in  similar  rescue 
medication  use  in  both  studies  over  the  randomised  treatment  period  (percentage  of  rescue  free  days 
37.91% in study TRIPLE 5 and 34.64% in study TRIPLE 6 and average rescue medication use 2.18 puffs/day 
and 2.16 puffs/day, respectively).

Notes 
CHF  5993  was  superior  to  Foster  for  both  pre-dose  FEV1  (adjusted  mean  difference 
0·081  L  [95%  CI  0.052–0.109];  p<0·001)  and  2-h  post-dose  FEV1  (adjusted  mean 
difference  0.117  [0.086–0.147];  p<0·001)  at  week  26.  TDI  focal  score  improved  at 
week  26  in  both  groups;  the mean  difference  between  treatments  (0.21  units  [95% 
CI –0·08 to 0·51]) was not statistically significant.

The superiority of CHF 5993 pMDI over Tiotropium was demonstrated in terms of the 
moderate  and  severe  COPD  exacerbation  rate  over  52  weeks  of  treatment  (primary 
endpoint).  The  adjusted  exacerbation  rate  per  patient  per  year  was  lower  with  CHF 
5993  pMDI  (0.457)  than  with  Tiotropium  (0.571),  and  the  adjusted  rate  was  0.801 
(95% CI 0.693; 0.925; p=0.003). These results indicated a 20% reduction in the rate 
of  moderate/severe  COPD  exacerbations  with  CHF  5993  pMDI  compared  to 
Tiotropium.  Superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over  Tiotropium  in  terms  of  the  change 
from  baseline  in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  at  Week  52  (key  secondary  endpoint)  was 
demonstrated  as  the  adjusted  mean  difference  between  treatments  was  0.061  L 
(95% CI 0.037; 0.086; p < 0.001). Non-inferiority of CHF 5993 pMDI relative to CHF 
1535  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  was  also  demonstrated  as  the  adjusted  mean  difference 
between  treatments  was  -0.003  L  (95%  CI  -0.033;  0.027),  with  a  lower  confidence 
limit well above the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -0.050 L.

Data are presented as number of subjects in the age group / total number of subjects. 
Sufficient numbers of patients aged ≥65 years were included in the two pivotal Phase III studies (46% and 
44.3%) to be reassured that efficacy and safety seen in the total population can be extrapolated to the older 
age group.  
As  COPD  is  a  disease  that  is  not  seen  in  children  a  class  waiver  from  the  European  Paediatric  Regulation 
(Regulation [EC] Number 1901/2006) has been granted for the condition COPD.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy  data  obtained  from  six  clinical  studies  has  been  provided:  three  Phase  II,  one  Phase  IIb  and  two 
Phase III studies.  
Studies GLYCO 2 and TRIPLE 3 were dose finding studies which assessed the efficacy and safety of different 
GB  doses  alone  or  in  combination  with  BDP/FF.  Study  TRIPLE  9  further  investigated  the  long-term  efficacy 
and  safety  of  GB  in  the  target  population  at  the  selected  dose.  Study  CARSAF  assessed  cardiac  safety  and 
effects on lung function parameters of a free combination of BDP/FF + two doses of GB compared to BDP/FF 
alone in patients with moderate to severe COPD. 
Studies TRIPLE 5 and TRIPLE 6 were the pivotal efficacy and safety studies for CHF 5993 pMDI. 
Overall,  the  proposed  daily  dosing  for  the  LAMA  component  (i.e.  50  µg  GB)  seems  to  be  the  optimal  dose 
when combined with 400µg BDP and 24µg FF. 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 69/90 
  
  
 
Of note, the proposed dose of GB has been chosen  based on the two dose-finding studies of short duration 
(GLYCO  2  [8  days]  and  TRIPLE  3  [7  days]).  Treatment  durations  of  6-12  weeks  are  recommended  by  the 
COPD guideline (EMA/CHMP/483572/2012-corr1). However, the results of study TRIPLE 9 provide additional 
evidence  of  the  clinical  efficacy  of  the  selected  GB  50  µg  daily  dose  (used  as  a  single  agent)  in  a  4-weeks 
trial,  thereby  showing  that  the  effect  of  GB  in  terms  of  bronchodilation  is  sustained  over  a  longer  period  of 
time in the target population. 
The design and methodology of both pivotal studies are appropriate for the objectives. The patient population 
selected  for  both  pivotal  studies  include  Group  B  and  D  patients  according  to  GOLD  classification,  update 
2017.  In  both  pivotal  studies,  patients  with  severe  and  very  severe  airflow  limitation  of  FEV1  <  50% 
predicted  normal  were  included.  The  patient  populations  were  comparable  in  terms  of  demography,  lung 
function  and  symptoms.  In  both  studies  just  over  half  the  patients  were  aged  <  65  years,  approximately 
three quarters were male, and a large majority were Caucasian. Most patients were taking combination COPD 
therapy  at  study  entry;  approximately  three  quarters  were  taking  ICS  +  LABA  combinations.  The  patients 
enrolled  were  representative  of  the  target  population  for  the  proposed  therapeutic  indication.  Post-
bronchodilator  FEV1  was  1.11  and  1.12  L  in  studies  Triple  5  and  Triple  6  respectively  (36.5%  and  36.6% 
predicted normal). 
According  to  the  recommendations  from  the  CHMP  guideline  on  the  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for 
the treatment of COPD, measurement of lung function parameters alone is considered to be insufficient in the 
assessment  of  therapeutic  effect.  If  lung  function  is  selected  as  a  primary  endpoint,  additional  evidence  of 
efficacy must be demonstrated through the use of a co-primary endpoint, which should either be a symptom-
based endpoint or a patient-related endpoint. The guideline also states that number of exacerbations may be 
acceptable as single primary endpoint. 
In study TRIPLE 5, the chosen co-primary endpoints of pre-dose FEV1, 2-hour post-dose FEV1 and TDI focal 
score  to  explore  the  contribution  of  GB  are  considered  to  be  appropriate  and  in  line  with  the  CHMP  COPD 
guideline. Also in study TRIPLE 6, the chosen primary endpoint moderate and severe COPD exacerbation rate 
as well as the key secondary endpoint (pre-dose FEV1) to compare CHF 5993 pMDI with Tiotropium and also 
with Foster pMDI plus Tiotropium are considered to be appropriate and in line with the CHMP COPD guideline. 
Studies TRIPLE 5 and TRIPLE 6 were studies of 52 week duration, suitable to measure the exacerbation rate 
as they cover all seasons.  
Appropriate  and  robust  randomisation  methods  have  been  used.  All  study  treatments  taken  during  the trial 
period of both pivotal studies were administered in a double-blind manner. Appropriate measures were taken 
to ensure integrity of the blinding in both pivotal studies.  
The statistical methods used in both pivotal studies are acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study TRIPLE 5 
At week 26, CHF 5993 improved pre-dose FEV1 by 0.081 L (95% CI 0.052–0.109; p<0.001) and 2-h post-
dose  FEV1  by  0.117  L  (0.086–0.147;  p<0.001)  compared  with  Foster.  Mean  TDI  focal  scores  at  week  26 
were 1.71 for CHF 5993 and 1.50 for Foster, with a difference of 0.21 (95% CI –0.08 to 0.51; p=0.160).  
Although there is no consensus statement on what constitutes a minimally important difference for pre-dose 
FEV1  for  subjects  with  airflow  obstruction,  some  published  literature  suggests  a  threshold  of  100mL  for

clinical  trials  (Donohue  JF  2005)  may  be  appropriate,  or  that  changes  of  5-10%  from  baseline  can  be 
considered  clinically  meaningful  as  well  (Cazzola  M  et  al.  2008).  The  literature  also  acknowledges  that  a 
threshold  for  meaningful  change  is  more  meaningful  for  severe  and  very  severe  patients  than  for  patients 
with  mild  to  moderate  disease.  Considering  the  severity  of  the  condition  of  the  target  population,  an 
improvement over baseline in pre-dose FEV1 of 81ml for CHF 5993 pMDI compared to Foster is considered to 
be a meaningful benefit for this more severe COPD group.  
According to the pre-specified success criterion the study failed due to the lack of a significant result for the 
third primary endpoint TDI focal score at Week 26, although a significant result was obtained in the other two 
primary endpoints, according to the pre-specified hierarchical procedure. 
Subgroup  analyses  of  the  three  co-primary  endpoints  were  broadly  consistent  with  the  ITT  analyses.  An 
exception  was  for  the  subgroup  with  very  severe  airflow  limitation.  In  these  patients,  pre-dose  FEV1 
assessment did not differ significantly between treatment groups.  
The sensitivity analyses with respect to missing data imputation yielded similar results confirming the results 
of the primary analyses. Consistency of the estimated effect was found for the vast majority of the countries.  
Increases  in  TDI  focal  score  were  observed  in  both  groups  at  all  visits,  with  a  statistically  significant 
difference  between  treatments  favouring  CHF  5993  at  the  two  earliest  visits  (weeks  4  and  12).  More  than 
50%  of  patients  in  each  group  reported  clinically  relevant  improvements  (≥ 1  unit)  in  TDI  focal  score  at 
weeks 26 and 52; at week 26, patients were significantly more likely to respond to CHF 5993 than Foster. 
For  SGRQ  total  score,  clinically  relevant  improvements  from  baseline  (decrease  ≥ 4  units)  occurred  for  the 
CHF 5993 group at all visits from week 12 onwards, with statistically significant differences between the two 
groups  at  weeks  4,  12,  and  52  (mean  treatment difference  at  week  52  of  –1.69  [95%  CI  –3.20  to  –0.17]; 
p=0.029). 
The use of rescue medication in puffs per day was significantly lower with CHF 5993 than with Foster, up to 
week 26; patients in the CHF 5993 group had a significantly greater percentage of days with no rescue use 
than those in the Foster, group up to week 12.  
The percentage of patients who had moderate-to severe exacerbations was lower with CHF 5993 (31%) than 
with Foster (35%). The adjusted annual rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations was 0.41 for the CHF 5993 
group  and  0.53  for  the  Foster,  group,  with  a  rate  ratio  of  0.77  (95%  CI  0.65–0.92;  p=0.005),  indicating  a 
significant 23% reduction in the rate with CHF 5993. Subgroup analyses were broadly consistent with the ITT 
analysis.  Furthermore,  CHF  5993  significantly  prolonged  the  time  to  first  moderate-to-severe  exacerbation 
compared with Foster (hazard ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.67–0.97]; p=0.020). 
Study TRIPLE 6 
In study TRIPLE 6, the triple combination product has demonstrated superiority over Tiotropium in terms of 
the  moderate  and  severe  COPD  exacerbation  rate  over  52  weeks  of  treatment  (primary  endpoint).  The 
adjusted exacerbation rate per patient per year was lower with CHF 5993 pMDI (0.457) than with Tiotropium 
(0.571), and the adjusted rate ratio was 0.801 (95% CI 0.693 - 0.925; p=0.003). These results indicated a 
20%  reduction  in  the  rate  of  moderate/severe  COPD  exacerbations  with  CHF  5993  pMDI  compared  to 
Tiotropium.  20%  reduction  of  rate  of  moderate/severe  exacerbations  is  suggested  to  be  minimal  clinically 
important difference in COPD patients (Calverley PM et al. 2005). 
The sensitivity analyses with respect to missing data imputation yielded similar results confirming the results 
of the primary analyses. Consistency of the estimated effect was found for the vast majority of the countries.

The  adjusted  mean  change  in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  from  baseline  to  Week  52  (key  secondary  endpoint) 
was  a  statistically  significant  increase  with  all  three  treatments.  Superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over 
Tiotropium in terms of the change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV1 at Week 52 was demonstrated as 
the  adjusted  mean  difference  between  treatments  was  0.061  L  (95%  CI  0.037  -  0.086,  p  <  0.001).  Non-
inferiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  relative  to  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  was  also  demonstrated  as  the  adjusted 
mean  difference  between  treatments  was  -0.003  L  (95%  CI  -0.033  -  0.027),  with  a  lower  confidence  limit 
well  above  the  pre-defined  non-inferiority  margin  of  -0.050  L.  The  difference  between  CHF  1535  pMDI  + 
Tiotropium  and  Tiotropium  was  of  a  similar  magnitude  to  the  difference  between  CHF  5993  pMDI  and 
Tiotropium. 
The superior clinical efficacy of CHF 5993 pMDI compared to Tiotropium was further supported by consistent 
findings on other relevant parameters, including SGRQ and use of rescue medication. For these parameters, 
CHF 5993 pMDI and CHF 1535 pMDI + Tiotropium generally showed a similar effect. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Study  TRIPLE  5,  triple  therapy  with  BDP/FF/GB  (CHF  5993)  had  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically 
relevant superior effect on pre-dose and 2-h post-dose FEV1 at week 26 than BDP/FF (Foster). 
TDI  focal  score,  the  third  co-primary  endpoint,  had  a  clinically  relevant  improvement  with  both  treatments, 
but the mean difference between treatments in TDI focal score at week 26 was not statistically significant.  
Nevertheless,  the  responder  analysis  indicates  a  benefit  for  CHF  5993  compared  with  Foster  on  TDI 
symptoms  for  a  greater  proportion  of  patients.  In  addition,  significant  differences  favouring  CHF  5993  for 
SGRQ total score were also found at several timepoints (weeks 4, 12, and 52). Results were supported by the 
SGRQ responder analysis. Also, the observed 23% reduction in the exacerbation rate is above the minimum 
clinically important difference.  
Study  TRIPLE  6,  CHF  5993  had  a  statistically  significant  superior  effect  on  moderate  and  severe  COPD 
exacerbation  rate  over  52  weeks  than  Tiotropium.  The  observed  20%  reduction  in  the  exacerbation  rate  is 
above the minimum clinically important difference. Superiority of CHF 5993 pMDI over Tiotropium and non-
inferiority  relative  to  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  in  terms  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  at  Week  52  was  also 
demonstrated. 
The superior clinical efficacy of CHF 5993 pMDI compared to Tiotropium was further supported by consistent 
findings on other relevant parameters, including SGRQ and use of rescue medication. For these parameters, 
CHF 5993 pMDI and Foster pMDI + Tiotropium generally showed a similar effect. 
Overall,  CHF  5993  pMDI  has  shown  benefits  in  reduction  in  exacerbation  frequency  and  in  improvement  in 
lung function in two large Phase III studies.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
In studies conducted in healthy subjects or subjects with renal impairment, single doses of BDP 400 μg and 
FF 24 μg (corresponding to the target daily dose of CHF 5993 pMDI, two inhalations twice daily [bid]) were 
administered,  while  for  GB,  a  supra  therapeutic  dose  equal  to  100  μg  was  administered  to  allow  a  better 
characterisation of the PK profile of this component. However, safety data from these five PK studies did not 
reveal any new adverse effects or any marked changes in severity, duration or frequency of adverse effects.

An integrated analysis was performed by pooling the individual data from the CHF 5993 treatment in studies 
TRIPLE  5  and  TRIPLE  6.  These  integrated  data  comprise  the  majority  of  the  safety  information  and  are 
presented in the following sections. 
Patient exposure 
In  study  TRIPLE  5,  mean  exposure  was  341.3  days  (range  6–395  days)  in  the  CHF  5993  group  and  334.5 
days (3–409 days) in the Foster group.  
In study TRIPLE 6, mean exposure was 347.4 days (range 3–402 days) in the CHF 5993 group, 330.6 days 
(1–403 days) in the Tiotropium group and 349.6 days (4–399 days) in the Foster + Tiotropium group. 
The  exposure  is  in  line  with  recommendations  of  ICH  E1.  Given  also  the  fact  that  there  is  already  post-
marketing experience with Foster the safety database is considered to be adequate. 
Adverse events 
•  Common Adverse Events and Adverse Drug Reactions  
In  study  TRIPLE  5,  TEAEs  were  experienced  by  368  (53.6%)  patients  reported  with  927  TEAEs  in  the  CHF 
5993  pMDI  group  and  379  (55.7%)  patients  reported  with  928  TEAEs  in  the  Foster  pMDI  group.  Those 
reported  in  ≥ 2%  of  patients  in  either  treatment  group  were:  COPD  exacerbation,  nasopharyngitis, 
pneumonia, hypertension, headache and respiratory tract infection viral. The majority of TEAEs were mild or 
moderate in intensity and resolved by the end of the study.  
Overall,  the  incidence  of  ADRs  in  both  treatment  groups  was  very  low.  Treatment-emergent  ADRs  were 
experienced  by  26  (3.8%)  patients  reported  with  31  ADRs  in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI  group  and  14  (2.1%) 
patients reported with 15 ADRs in the CHF 1535 pMDI group. The only treatment-emergent ADRs reported in 
>2 patients in either treatment group were oral candidiasis, muscle spasms and dry mouth. 
In particular, cardiovascular events are balanced among the different treatment groups.  
In  study  TRIPLE  6,  TEAEs  were  experienced  by  594  (55.2%)  patients  reported  with 1422  TEAEs  in  the CHF 
5993 pMDI group, 622 (57.8%) patients reported with 1514 TEAEs in the Tiotropium group and 309 (57.5%) 
patients reported with 740 TEAEs in the Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group. Those reported in ≥  2% of patients 
in any treatment group were: COPD exacerbation, nasopharyngitis, headache, dyspnoea, pneumonia, cough 
and respiratory tract infection viral. The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity and resolved by 
the end of the study. 
Overall,  the  incidence  of  ADRs  in  all  three  treatment  groups  was  low.  Treatment-emergent  ADRs  were 
experienced by 25 (2.3%) patients reported with 34 ADRs in the CHF 5993 pMDI group, 33 (3.1%) patients 
reported with 43 ADRs in the Tiotropium group and 27 (5.0%) patients reported with 38 ADRs in the Foster 
pMDI + Tiotropium group. A slight imbalance favouring the CHF 5993 pMDI group is observed. However, the 
numbers are very small and no firm conclusion can be drawn.  
Those reported in > 2 patients in any treatment group were dry mouth, muscle spasms, dysphonia, headache 
and oral candidiasis. All ADRs were mild or moderate in intensity and the majority resolved by the end of the 
study.

Pneumonia 
In  study  TRIPLE  5,  there  were  25  and  18  treatment-emergent  pneumonias  (including  PTs  of  pneumonia, 
bronchopneumonia and pneumonia aspiration) reported in 23 (3.3%) patients and 18 (2.6%) patients in the 
CHF  5993  pMDI  and  CHF  1535  pMDI  groups,  respectively.  Serious  pneumonias  were  experienced  by  15 
(2.2%) patients reported with 17 events in the CHF 5993 pMDI group and 7 (1.0%) patients reported with 7 
events  in  the  CHF  1535  pMDI  group.  None  were  considered  treatment-related  and  none  were  fatal.  One 
event  of  pneumonia  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation  in  1  (0.1%)  patient  in  each  treatment  group.  The 
pneumonia rate per 1,000 patients per year was slightly higher in the CHF 5993 pMDI group than in the CHF 
1535 pMDI group (38.9 vs. 28.8).  
In  study  TRIPLE  6,  there  were  30  events  of  treatment-emergent  pneumonias  (including  PTs  of  pneumonia, 
bronchopneumonia, lobar pneumonia and interstitial lung disease) reported in 28 (2.6%) patients in the CHF 
5993 pMDI group, 20 events reported in 19 (1.8%) patients in the Tiotropium group and 13 events reported 
in  12  (2.2%)  patients  in  the  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  group.  None  were  considered  treatment-related. 
Serious pneumonias were experienced by 21 (1.9%) patients reported with 21 events in the CHF 5993 pMDI 
group, 14 (1.3%) patients reported with 15 events in the Tiotropium group and 9 (1.7%) patients reported 
with  10  events  in  the  CHF  1535  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  group.  One  event  of  pneumonia  led  to  study  drug 
discontinuation  in  1  (0.1%)  patient  in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI  group,  4  events  in  4  (0.4%)  patients  in  the 
Tiotropium group and 1 event in 1 (0.2%) patient in the Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group. All these events of 
pneumonia  that  led  to  study  drug  discontinuation  also  led  to  death.  As  expected,  the  pneumonia  rate  per 
1,000 patients per year was lower in the Tiotropium group (20.5) than in the CHF 5993 pMDI group (29.2) or 
the Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group (25.2). 
Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTI) other than pneumonia 
In study TRIPLE 5 the most common LRTI were viral related. These infections may be associated with chronic 
use  of  ICS,  however,  they  were  observed  only  in  16  (2.3%)  and  10  (1.5%)  patients  in  the  CHF  5993  and 
Foster  pMDI  group  respectively  with  only  slight  differences  between  treatments  that  are  considered  to  be 
non-clinically significant.  
In study TRIPLE 6 as well the most common LRTI were viral related with events observed in 15 (1.4%), 15 
(1.4%),  and  13  (2.4%)  patients  in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI,  Tiotropium,  and  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  group 
respectively.  
Candidiasis 
In  study  TRIPLE  5  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI  group  experienced  an  event  (PT 
laryngitis  fungal,  oesophageal  candidiasis,  oral  candidiasis,  oral  fungal  infection  and  oropharyngeal 
candidiasis)  compared  to  the  Foster  pMDI  group  (2.3%  vs.  0.7%  respectively).    In  study  TRIPLE  6  on  the 
other  hand,  less  than  1%  of  patients  overall  experienced  an  event  (PT  candidiasis,  laryngitis  fungal,  oral 
candidiasis,  oral  fungal  infection  and  oropharyngeal  candidiasis),  with  a  comparable  distribution  among 
treatments.  
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events 
In studies TRIPLE 5 and TRIPLE 6, a central Adjudication Committee composed of physicians with expertise in 
the  field  of  cardiology  was  established  in  order  to  perform  careful  and  unbiased  scrutiny  of  potentially 
relevant adverse events and to perform an evaluation of MACE.  
Assessment report

In  study  TRIPLE  5,  treatment-emergent  MACEs  were  reported  in  15  (2.2%)  patients  in  both  treatment 
groups. Most of these events were heart failures (6 [0.9%] and 3 [0.4%] patients in the CHF 5993 pMDI and 
Foster  pMDI  groups,  respectively)  and  acute  myocardial  infarctions  (1  [0.1%]  and  6  [0.9%]  patients, 
respectively).  The  MACE  rate  per  1,000  patients  per  year  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (24.9  and 
25.6 in the CHF 5993 pMDI and Foster pMDI groups, respectively).  
There was, however, a higher rate of treatment-emergent MACEs in patients using a spacer. The MACE rate 
per  1,000  patients  per  year  was  higher  in  the  CHF  5993 pMDI  group than  in  the  CHF  1535 pMDI  group  for 
patients using a spacer (81.5 vs. 41.7) while it was slightly lower in the CHF  5993 pMDI group for patients 
not using a spacer (14.7 vs. 21.8). However, patients using a spacer were older, with a higher prevalence of 
concomitant  diseases  (in  particular  cardiac  disorders)  and  with  a  more  severe  disease  (in  terms  of 
exacerbation history, airflow limitation and health related quality of life) than patients not using a spacer. 
In study TRIPLE 6, there were 20 events of treatment-emergent MACEs reported in 20 (1.9%) patients in the 
CHF  5993  pMDI  group,  23  events  reported  in  23  (2.1%)  patients  in  the  Tiotropium  group  and  7  events 
reported in 7 (1.3%) patients in the Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group. In the CHF 5993 pMDI group, most of 
these  events  were  either  stroke  (9  [0.8%]  patients),  or  cardiovascular  death  (8  [0.7%]  patients)  and  10 
events  of  treatment-emergent  MACEs  were  fatal.  In  the  Tiotropium  group  they  were  either  heart  failure  (8 
[0.7%]  patients)  or  cardiovascular  death  (6  [0.6%]  patients)  and  12  events  of  treatment-emergent  MACEs 
were  fatal.  In  the  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  group,  they  were  either  cardiovascular  death,  heart  failure  or 
stroke  (reported  in  2  [0.4%]  patients  each)  and  2  events  of  treatment-emergent  MACEs  were  fatal.  The 
MACE  rate  per  1,000  patients  per  year  was  slightly  higher  in  the  Tiotropium  group  (23.5)  than  in  the  CHF 
5993 pMDI group (19.5) and the Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group (13.6). 
In  patients  using  a  spacer,  no  treatment-emergent  MACEs  were  reported  in  the  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium 
group. The rate was higher in the Tiotropium group (31.6) than in the CHF 5993 pMDI group (20.6). 
Other significant cardiovascular events 
In  study  TRIPLE  5  a  similar  percentage  of  patients  in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI  group  experienced  any 
cardiovascular  event  compared  to  the  Foster  pMDI  group  (11.5%  vs  11.2%  respectively).  A  rather  low 
number of conduction defects (which represent a typical effect associated mainly with LABA and a key safety 
concern) was observed overall, with only two events of QT prolongation in the CHF 5993 group (one of which 
was  assessed  as  drug  related)  as  opposed  to  none  in  the  CHF1535  pMDI  group.  The  absence  of  any 
treatment-related trend was confirmed also in study TRIPLE 6 where the percentage of patients experiencing 
any cardiovascular event was equally distributed among treatments (9.7%, 10.1% and 10.4% with CHF 5993 
pMDI,  Tiotropium  and  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  respectively).  Notably,  in  this  study  no  events  of  QT 
prolongation were observed in the CHF5993 pMDI group as well as in the Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group, 
whereas two events were observed in the Tiotropium only group. 
Vital Signs 
In study TRIPLE 5, the mean changes in pre-dose and 10-minute post-dose SBP and DBP were minimal and 
similar in both treatment groups. 
In study TRIPLE 6, the mean changes in pre-dose and 10-minute post-dose SBP and DBP were minimal and 
similar  in  all  the  treatment  groups.  Serious  TEAEs  of  hypertension  (1  TEAE  in  1  [0.1%]  patient)  and 
hypertensive  crisis  (2  TEAEs  in  2  [0.2%]  patients)  were  reported  with  CHF  5993.  Of  these  TEAEs,  1  event 
(PT: hypertensive crisis) in 1 (0.1%) patient led to study medication discontinuation. All of these TEAEs were 
moderate in severity and had resolved by the end of the study.

Tremor 
In  study  TRIPLE  5  only  one  event  of  tremor  was  observed  in  the  Foster  pMDI  group  and  none  in  the  CHF 
5993  pMDI  group,  whereas  in  study  TRIPLE  6  one  event  was  observed  in  the  Tiotropium  group,  one  in  the 
Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group and none in the CHF 5993 pMDI group. 
Muscle spasms 
In study TRIPLE 5, 1.2 % of patients in the CHF 5993 pMDI group experienced an event compared to 0.6% in 
the Foster pMDI group.  
In study TRIPLE 6 less than 1% of patients overall had an event with a comparable distribution between the 
CHF  5993  pMDI  and  the  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  group,  whereas  a  lower  percentage  of  patients  in  the 
Tiotropium group experienced an event.  
Urinary retention 
In  study  TRIPLE  5  urinary  retention  and  associated events  were  observed in  less  than  1% in  the  CHF  5993 
pMDI and Foster pMDI groups. In study TRIPLE 6 one event was observed in the CHF 5993 pMDI group while 
no events were observed in the Tiotropium and Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group.  
Ocular effects 
In  study  TRIPLE  5  ocular  effects  were  rather  few  and  experienced  by  less  than  1%  of  all  patients  with  a 
higher incidence in the Foster pMDI group compared to CHF 5993 pMDI.  
In  study  TRIPLE  6,  ocular  effects  were  observed  in  less  than  1%  of  all  patients  with  a  slightly  higher 
percentage  of  patients  experiencing  such  effects  in  the  Tiotropium  and  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  group 
compared to the CHF 5993 pMDI group. 
Dry mouth 
In both studies, dry mouth was experienced by less than 1% of patients in the CHF 5993 group without any 
notable difference in the distribution among treatment groups.  
Constipation 
In both studies, a rather small number of events were observed with an equal distribution among treatments 
and affecting less than 1% of patients overall.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In  study  TRIPLE  5,  here  were  15  TEAEs  leading  to  death  reported  in  15  (2.2%)  patients  in  the  CHF  5993 
pMDI  group  and  17  TEAEs  leading  to  death  reported  in  16  (2.4%)  patients  in  the  Foster  pMDI  group.  No 
consistent  patterns  or imbalances  were  noted  across  treatment  groups  when  examining  the  primary  causes 
of  death.  The  most  common  TEAEs  leading  to  death  were  from  the  Cardiac  Disorders  SOC,  with  5  events 
reported in 5 (0.7%) patients in the CHF 5993 pMDI group and 7 events reported in 7 (1.0%) patients in the 
Foster pMDI group. COPD exacerbation led to death in 2 (0.3%) patients in the CHF 5993 pMDI group and in 
4  (0.6%)  patients  in  the  CHF  1535  pMDI  group.  Cardiac  disorders  and  COPD  exacerbation  are  categories 
expected in patients with severe and very severe COPD. 
There  were  180  serious  TEAEs  reported  in  106  (15.4%)  patients  in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI  group  and  162 
serious  TEAEs  reported  in  123  (18.1%)  patients  in  the  Foster  pMDI  group.  Consistent  with  the  population 
Assessment report  
Trimbow

under investigation, the most frequently observed SAEs were COPD exacerbation and Pneumonia. There was 
only  one  serious  treatment-emergent  ADR  of  atrial  fibrillation  (AF)  reported  in  1  (0.1%)  patient  in  the  CHF 
5993  pMDI  group,  which  was  also  the  only  ADR  considered  severe.  This  event  resolved  in  15  days  and  did 
not cause study drug discontinuation. 
In  study  TRIPLE  6,  there  were  23  TEAEs  leading  to  death  reported  in  20  (1.9%)  patients  in  the  CHF  5993 
pMDI group, 35 TEAEs leading to death reported in 29 (2.7%) patients in the Tiotropium group and 8 TEAEs 
leading to death reported in 8 (1.5%) patients in the Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group. No consistent patterns 
or imbalances were noted across treatment groups when examining the primary causes of death. The most 
common  TEAEs  leading  to  death  were  from the  Cardiac  Disorders  SOC,  with 9  events  reported  in  8  (0.7%) 
patients in the CHF 5993 pMDI group, 15 events reported in 14 (1.3%) patients in the Tiotropium group and 
2  events  reported  in  2  (0.4%)  patients  in  the  Foster  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  group.  COPD  exacerbation  led  to 
death  in  5  (0.5%)  patients  in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI  group,  4  (0.4%)  patients  in  the  Tiotropium  group  and  1 
(0.2%)  patient  in  the  CHF  1535  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  group.  Cardiac  disorders  and  COPD  exacerbation  are 
categories expected in patients with severe and very severe COPD. 
There  were  201  serious  TEAEs  reported  in  140  (13.0%)  patients  in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI  group,  230  serious 
TEAEs  reported  in  164  (15.2%)  patients  in  the  Tiotropium  group  and  88  serious  TEAEs  reported  in  68 
(12.7%)  patients  in  the  CHF  1535  pMDI  +  Tiotropium  group.  Consistent  with  the  population  under 
investigation,  the  most  frequently  observed  SAEs  were  COPD  exacerbation  and  Pneumonia.  There  was  only 
one  serious  treatment-emergent  ADR  of  angina  pectoris,  reported  in  1  (0.1%)  patient  in  the  Tiotropium 
group. 
Laboratory findings 
In both pivotal studies, the majority of patients did not show changes of clinical concern in terms of changes 
in haematology and biochemistry parameters.

Number and percentage of patients with at least one TEAE are presented. 
No clear signal of an increased risk with increasing age was found for any of the TEAEs, except for a slightly 
higher  incidence  of  nervous  system  disorders  in  older  patients.  However,  the  majority  of  events  classified 
under this SOC is represented by headaches. When excluding headaches from the analysis, no clear trend in 
the  incidence  of  nervous  system  disorders  by  age  is  found  (age  <65  years:  1.7%,  65-74:  4.2%,  75-84: 
2.8%, 85+: no events). 
Immunological events 
In both pivotal studies, the frequencies for hypersensitivity PV endpoints were low and comparable between 
treatments. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Study TRIPLE 12 was designed as a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study to investigate the effect of cimetidine 
on the PK profile of CHF 5993 25 µg. PK changes observed in the study did not indicate any clinically relevant 
DDI. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
In study TRIPLE 5, there were 43 and 35 TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation reported in 35 (5.1%) 
patients  and  33  (4.9%)  patients  in  the  CHF  5993  pMDI  and  CHF  1535  pMDI  groups,  respectively.  Those 
reported in >2 patients in either treatment group were COPD exacerbation (5 [0.7%] and 8 [1.2%] patients 
in the CHF 5993 pMDI and CHF 1535 pMDI groups, respectively) and lung neoplasm malignant (4 [0.6%] and 
1 [0.1%] patients in the CHF 5993 pMDI and CHF 1535 pMDI groups, respectively). Overall, the incidences of 
the treatment discontinuations are balanced across the different treatment groups. 
In study TRIPLE 6, there were 41 TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation reported in 33 (3.1%) patients 
in the CHF 5993 pMDI group, 71 TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation reported in 62 (5.8%) patients

in the Tiotropium group and 15 TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation reported in 15 (2.8%) patients in 
the CHF 1535 pMDI + Tiotropium group. Those reported in more than 2 patients in any treatment group were 
COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, cardiac failure and dyspnoea. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing with the 
individual components have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Evaluation of safety in the present application is difficult due to the nature of the study population who were 
frail, old, with advanced lung disease and often with other significant health and probably social problems.  
Study TRIPLE 5 
A similar proportion of patients had treatment-emergent adverse events in the two groups. Most events were 
mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  One  treatment-related  serious  adverse  event  occurred  (atrial  fibrillation)  in  a 
patient in the CHF 5993 group. This event resolved in 15 days and did not cause study drug discontinuation. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events resulted in death in a similar percentage of patients in the two groups. 
None of the deaths were assessed to be related to the study treatment. 
Mean changes from baseline in blood pressure, heart rate, and Fridericia’s corrected QT (QTcF) interval were 
small and similar in the two groups. The percentages of abnormal QTcF interval absolute values and changes 
were  similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  In  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  Holter  assessments,  changes  from 
baseline in 24 h average heart rate to weeks 26 and 52 were minimum and similar in both groups. 
Only few patients had pneumonia (about 3%), an event that has been associated with inhaled corticosteroid 
use in COPD.  
None  of  the  subgroup  analyses  (by  age,  cardiovascular  comorbidities,  gender)  highlighted  relevant 
differences in the safety profiles compared with the overall Safety population.  
Study TRIPLE 6 
A  similar  proportion  of  patients  had  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  in  the  three  groups.  Most  events 
were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  resulted  in  death  in  a  similar 
percentage of patients in the three groups. The most common TEAEs leading to death were from the Cardiac 
Disorders SOC and COPD exacerbation. Both categories are expected in patients with severe and very severe 
COPD. There was only one serious treatment-emergent ADR of angina pectoris, reported in 1 (0.1%) patient 
in the Tiotropium group. 
Mean changes from baseline in blood pressure, heart rate, and Fridericia’s corrected QT (QTcF) interval were 
small and similar in the three groups.  
Only few patients had pneumonia (< 3%), an event that has been associated with inhaled corticosteroid use 
in  COPD.  As  expected,  the  pneumonia  rate  per  1,000  patients  per  year  was  lower  in  the  Tiotropium  group 
(20.5) than in the CHF 5993 pMDI group (29.2) or the Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group (25.2). 
None of the subgroup analyses (by age, cardiovascular comorbidities, spacer, gender, renal impairment and 
hepatic  impairment)  highlighted  relevant  differences  in  the  safety  profiles  compared  with  the  overall  Safety 
population.  
Assessment report

In general, in studies TRIPLE 5 and TRIPLE 6 the incidence of pneumonia in the CHF 5993 pMDI group was 
low and similar to that observed with other non-ICS containing treatments in other recent clinical trials in 
comparable populations of COPD patients.  
Summary of Product Characteristics 
All ADRs reported with CHF 5993 in studies TRIPLE 5 and TRIPLE 6 and those observed in studies TRIPLE 3 
and CARSAF with Foster + GB define the safety profile of CHF 5993 and are included in the proposed SmPC, 
with the exception of benign prostatic hyperplasia, which was observed in a single patient in study TRIPLE 6 
and was evaluated as not reasonably explicable by the known pharmacological properties of the product. 
For  the  purpose  of  compiling  the  tabulated  safety  summary  in  Section  4.8  of  the  SmPC,  the  frequency  for 
each of the observed ADRs was calculated based on the overall Safety population (i.e. 2,004 patients treated 
with the proposed therapeutic dose) in the studies mentioned above. For ADRs which were also observed in 
the  clinical  experience  with  Foster,  the  assigned  frequency  is  the  highest  between  the  one  observed  in  the 
clinical  experience  with  CHF  5993  pMDI  and  the  one  reported  in  the  approved  SmPC  for  Foster.  Additional 
ADRs reported in the Foster SmPC but not observed with CHF 5993 have been included with their respective 
frequency  and  were  selected  based  on  the  known  pharmacological  properties  of  the  individual  components 
and  the  10-year  post-marketing  experience  with  the  product.  Moreover,  additional  ADRs  reported  in 
approved SmPC for glycopyrronium single agent were also added. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the safety data presented there are no particular safety signals that suggest an additive effect when FF 
and  GB  are  administered  together.  The  main  side  effects  that  have  been  observed  with  CHF  5993  are 
associated  with  the  known  ICS,  LAMA  and  LABA  effects.  The  clinical  database  is  acceptable  and  considered 
sufficient. 
The  clinical  safety  sections  of  the  SmPC  contain  appropriate  information  for  each  substance  and  reflect  the 
safety information on the FDC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
CHF  5993  pMDI  is  a  novel  triple  combination  of  an  ICS,  LABA  and  LAMA.  The  product  is  a  fixed  dose 
combination of BDP, FF and GB and formulated as a HFA solution to be delivered via a pMDI with a nominal 
dose per actuation of BDP, FF and GB of 100 µg, 6 µg and 12.5 µg, respectively.  
The approved indication is: 
Maintenance  treatment  in  adult  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease 
(COPD)  who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting 
beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). 
COPD  is  a  progressive  disease  characterised  by  increasing  obstruction  to  airflow  and  the  progressive 
development  of  respiratory  symptoms  including  chronic  cough,  increased  sputum  production,  dyspnoea  and 
wheezing.  The  objective  of  pharmacological  treatment  of  is  to  prevent  and  control  symptoms,  reduce  the 
frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve general health status and exercise tolerance.  
Smoking cessation (including passive smoking) is extremely important. Ideally treatment of COPD would slow 
its  progression  but  this  has  never  been  convincingly  demonstrated.  Long  term  domiciliary  oxygen  has  been 
shown to prolong life but confines the patient to home for protracted periods. In recent years there has been 
increasing  emphasis  on  physical  training  and  rehabilitation.  Moderate  and  severe  COPD  exacerbations  are 
generally treated with antibiotics and oral corticosteroids. Maintenance treatment is by combinations of oral 
and inhaled bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Despite the availability of a multiplicity of pharmacological treatments none of them modifies the progress of 
the  disease  and  none  can  be  considered  to  have  a  really  major  benefit  on  its  most  common  symptoms  of 
cough, breathlessness, excess sputum production, and thoracic discomfort due to hyperinflation.  
ICS/LABA  combination  products  are  considered  key  to  the  symptomatic  management  of  COPD.  The 
combination  has  been  shown  to  improve  lung  function,  health  status,  and  to  reduce  COPD  exacerbations 
compared  with  either  agent  alone.  LAMAs  have  been  shown  to  improve  lung  function,  relieve  symptoms, 
increase exercise capacity, improve quality of life, and reduce COPD exacerbations to a greater extent than 
short-acting  bronchodilators.  As  disease  severity  increases,  COPD  treatment  guidelines  recommend  an

incremental  approach  to  pharmacological  treatment,  involving  the  use  of  combinations  of  drug  classes  with 
different or complementary mechanisms of action (GOLD 2016). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical programme of CHF 5993 pMDI in COPD included three Phase II (studies GLYCO 2, TRIPLE 3 and 
CARSAF), one Phase IIb (study TRIPLE 9) and two Phase III clinical studies (studies TRIPLE 5 and TRIPLE 6). 
Studies GLYCO 2 and TRIPLE 3 were dose finding studies which assessed the efficacy and safety of different 
GB  doses  alone  or  in  combination  with  BDP/FF.  Study  TRIPLE  9  further  investigated  the  long-term  efficacy 
and safety of GB in the target population at the selected dose. Studies TRIPLE 5 and TRIPLE 6 were pivotal 
efficacy and safety studies for the FDC. Study CARSAF focused on the cardiac safety of the combination of GB 
with BDP/FF, and also provided supportive efficacy data for the combination. 
The  Phase  III  clinical  development  programme  in  COPD  included  two  52-week  active-controlled  studies. 
Study  Triple  5  compared  CHF  5993  pMDI  100/6/12.5  µg  with  a  fixed  combination  of  BDP  and  FF  100/6  µg 
(CHF 1535 pMDI) two inhalations twice daily. Study Triple 6 primarily compared CHF 5993 pMDI 100/6/12.5 
µg with tiotropium 18 µg inhalation powder, hard capsule, one inhalation once daily. In addition, effects were 
compared with an open triple combination made of CHF 1535 pMDI 100/6 µg two inhalations twice daily plus 
tiotropium 18 µg inhalation powder, hard capsule, one inhalation once daily. Both studies were conducted in 
patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD with severe to very severe airflow limitation (FEV1 less than 50% 
predicted),  with  symptoms  assessed  as  a  COPD  Assessment  Test  (CAT)  score  of  10  or  above,  and  with  at 
least one COPD exacerbation in the 12 months prior to screening.  
The  primary  objectives  of  study  Triple  5  were  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over  CHF 
1535 pMDI in terms of lung function (change from baseline in pre-dose and 2-hour post-dose morning forced 
expiratory  volume  in  the  1st  second  [FEV1]  at  Week  26)  and  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  CHF  5993 
pMDI over CHF 1535 pMDI in terms of dyspnoea (transition dyspnoea index [TDI] focal score at Week  26). 
The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of CHF 5993 pMDI on other lung function 
parameters, patient’s health status, clinical outcome measures and COPD exacerbations.  
The  primary  objective  of  study  Triple  6  was  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over 
Tiotropium  in  terms  of  moderate  and  severe  COPD  exacerbation  rate  over  52  weeks  of  treatment.  The  key 
secondary  objectives  of  the  study  were  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over  Tiotropium 
and  the  non-inferiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  relative  to  CHF  1535  pMDI  +Tiotropium  in  terms  of  pulmonary 
function  (change  from  baseline  in  pre-dose  morning  forced  expiratory  volume  in  the  1st  second  [FEV1]  at 
Week 52).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study TRIPLE 5, superiority of CHF 5993 over Foster in terms of change from baseline in pre-dose morning 
FEV1 at Week 26 was demonstrated, with an adjusted mean difference between treatments of 0.081 L (95% 
CI 0.052; 0.109) (p < 0.001).  
In addition, superiority of CHF 5993 over Foster in terms of change from baseline in 2-hour post-dose FEV1 
at  Week  26  was  demonstrated,  with  an  adjusted  mean  difference  between  treatments  of  0.117  L  (95%  CI 
0.086; 0.147) (p < 0.001). 
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 83/90 
  
  
 
The percentage of patients who had moderate-to severe exacerbations was lower with CHF 5993 (31%) than 
with Foster (35%). The adjusted annual rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations was 0.41 for the CHF 5993 
group  and  0.53  for  the  Foster,  group,  with  a  rate  ratio  of  0.77  (95%  CI  0.65–0.92;  p=0.005),  indicating  a 
significant 23% reduction in the rate with CHF 5993. The observed 23% reduction in the exacerbation rate is 
above the minimum clinically important difference. Furthermore, CHF 5993 significantly prolonged the time to 
first  moderate-to-severe  exacerbation  compared  with  Foster  (hazard  ratio  0.80  [95%  CI  0.67–0.97]; 
p=0.020). 
In  study  TRIPLE  6,  superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over  Tiotropium  was  demonstrated  in  terms  of  the 
moderate  and  severe  COPD  exacerbation  rate  over  52  weeks  of  treatment.  The  adjusted  exacerbation  rate 
per patient per year was lower with CHF 5993 pMDI (0.457) than with Tiotropium (0.571), and the adjusted 
rate ratio was 0.801 (95% CI 0.693; 0.925; p=0.003). These results indicated a 20% reduction in the rate of 
moderate/severe COPD exacerbations with CHF 5993 pMDI compared to Tiotropium. A 20% reduction of rate 
of moderate/severe exacerbations is suggested to be minimal clinically important difference in COPD patients 
(Calverley  PM  et  al.  2005).  Superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over  Tiotropium  in  terms  of  the  change  from 
baseline  in  pre-dose  morning  FEV1  at  Week  52  was  also  demonstrated  as  the  adjusted  mean  difference 
between  treatments  was  0.061  L  (95%  CI  0.037;  0.086;  p  <  0.001).  Non-inferiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI 
relative to Foster pMDI + Tiotropium was demonstrated as the adjusted mean difference between treatments 
was -0.003 L (95% CI -0.033; 0.027), with a lower confidence limit well above the pre-defined non-inferiority 
margin of -0.050 L. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In  study  TRIPLE  5,  TDI  focal  score  improved  at  week  26  in  both  groups;  the  mean  difference  between 
treatments  (0.21  units  [95%  CI  –0.08  to  0.51])  was  not  statistically  significant.  According  to  the  pre-
specified  success  criterion  study  TRIPLE  5  failed  due  to  the  lack  of  a  significant  result  for  the  third  primary 
endpoint  TDI  focal  score  at  Week  26,  although  a  significant  result  was  obtained  in  the  other  two  primary 
endpoints, according to the pre-specified hierarchical procedure.  
CHF  5993  pMDI  does  no  modify  the  natural  history  of  COPD  nor  does  it  have  a  mortality  benefit  however 
benefits on reduction of acute COPD exacerbations, on lung function, and on patient reported symptoms are 
evident.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In  study  TRIPLE  5,  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  had  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  in  the  two 
groups.  Most  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  resulted  in 
death in a similar percentage of patients in the two groups.  
Mean changes from baseline in blood pressure, heart rate, and Fridericia’s corrected QT (QTcF) interval were 
small and similar in the two groups. The percentages of abnormal QTcF interval absolute values and changes 
were  similar  in  both  treatment  groups.  In  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  Holter  assessments,  changes  from 
baseline in 24 h average heart rate to weeks 26 and 52 were minimum and similar in both groups. 
Only few patients had pneumonia (about 3%), an event that has been associated with inhaled corticosteroid 
use in COPD.  
Assessment report  
Trimbow 
Page 84/90 
  
  
 
None  of  the  subgroup  analyses  (by  age,  cardiovascular  comorbidities,  gender)  highlighted  relevant 
differences in the safety profiles compared with the overall Safety population. 
In study TRIPLE 6, also a similar proportion of patients had treatment-emergent adverse events in the three 
groups.  Most  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  resulted  in 
death in a similar percentage of patients in the three groups. The most common TEAEs leading to death were 
from the Cardiac Disorders SOC and COPD exacerbation. Both categories are expected in patients with severe 
and very severe COPD. There was only one serious treatment-emergent ADR of angina pectoris, reported in 1 
(0.1%) patient in the Tiotropium group. 
Mean changes from baseline in blood pressure, heart rate, and Fridericia’s corrected QT (QTcF) interval were 
small and similar in the three groups.  
Only few patients had pneumonia (< 3%), an event that has been associated with inhaled corticosteroid use 
in  COPD.  As  expected,  the  pneumonia  rate  per  1,000  patients  per  year  was  lower  in  the  Tiotropium  group 
(20.5) than in the CHF 5993 pMDI group (29.2) or the Foster pMDI + Tiotropium group (25.2). 
None of the subgroup analyses (by age, cardiovascular comorbidities, spacer, gender, renal impairment and 
hepatic  impairment)  highlighted  relevant  differences  in  the  safety  profiles  compared  with  the  overall  Safety 
population. 
The  safety  profile  of  the  dual  FDC  Foster  pMDI  has  been  previously  well  characterised  and  are  well  known. 
Regarding the safety of the triple FDC there is no evidence of an additive effect when the GB and Foster are 
administered  together.  There  is  also  no  evidence  that  the  safety  of  the  triple  FDC  is  worse  than  that  of 
Tiotropium or Foster plus Tiotropium. 
Overall,  the  AE  profile  of  CHF  5993  is  well  understood;  none  of  the  active  substances  is  a  new  active 
substance  and  all  have  been  used  over  periods  of  at  least  years  individually  and  in  combination  in  treating 
COPD patients of various grades of severity. In the present application, 2301 patients have been treated with 
the triple combination (counting the free and fixed combinations) many of them for 52 weeks. There are no 
evident new safety signals and the treatment associated unwanted effects are of a frequency and nature to 
be expected given the nature of the clinical development. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There  are  no  remaining  uncertainties  and  limitations  that  have  an  impact  on  the  benefit-risk  balance  (see 
section 3.7. Benefit-risk assessment and discussion.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  triple  combination  product  has  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  effect  on  the  lung  function 
parameter pre-dose morning FEV1 (adjusted mean difference 0.081, 95% CI 0.052; 0.109, p-value ˂ 0.001) 
and  2-hour  post-dose  FEV1  (adjusted  mean  difference  0.117,  95%  CI  0.086;  0.147,  p-value  ˂  0.001)  at 
week  26  when  compared  to  Foster  (study  TRIPLE  5).  The  difference  between  treatments  in  the  TDI  focal 
score  at  Week  26  did  not  reach  statistical  significance:  the  adjusted  mean  difference  (95%  CI)  between 
treatments was 0.21 (-0.08; 0.51) (p=0.160).  
Although there is no consensus statement on what constitutes a minimally important difference for pre-dose 
FEV1  for  subjects  with  airflow  obstruction,  some  published  literature  suggests  a  threshold  of  100mL  for 
clinical  trials  (Donohue  JF  2005)  may  be  appropriate,  or  that  changes  of  5-10%  from  baseline  can  be 
considered  clinically  meaningful  as  well  (Cazzola  M  et  al.  2008).  The  literature  also  acknowledges  that  a 
threshold  for  meaningful  change  is  more  meaningful  for  severe  and  very  severe  patients  than  for  patients 
with  mild  to  moderate  disease.  Considering  the  severity  of  the  target  population,  an  improvement  over 
baseline in pre-dose FEV1 of 81ml for CHF 5993 pMDI compared to Foster is considered to be a meaningful 
benefit for this more severe COPD group. 
A decreased risk of moderate and severe exacerbation considered clinically meaningful was observed at week 
52. The percentage of patients who had moderate and severe exacerbations was lower with CHF 5993 (31%) 
than  with  Foster  (35%).  The  adjusted  annual  rate  of  moderate  and  severe  exacerbations  was  0.41  for  the 
CHF  5993  group  and  0.53  for  the  Foster,  group,  with  a  rate  ratio  of  0.77  (95%  CI  0.65–0.92;  p=0.005), 
indicating a significant 23% reduction in the rate with CHF 5993. 
The triple combination product has also demonstrated superiority over Tiotropium in terms of the moderate 
and  severe  COPD  exacerbation  rate  over  52  weeks  of  treatment  (primary  endpoint).  The  adjusted 
exacerbation rate per patient per year was lower with CHF 5993 pMDI (0.457) than with Tiotropium (0.571), 
and  the  adjusted  rate  ratio  was  0.801  (95%  CI  0.693;  0.925;  p=0.003).  These  results  indicated  a  20% 
reduction in the rate of moderate/severe COPD exacerbations with CHF 5993 pMDI compared to Tiotropium. 
Superiority  of  CHF  5993  pMDI  over  Tiotropium  in  terms  of  the  change  from  baseline  in  pre-dose  morning 
FEV1  at  Week  52  (key  secondary  endpoint)  was  demonstrated  as  the  adjusted  mean  difference  between 
treatments was 0.061 L (95% CI 0.037; 0.086; p < 0.001). Non-inferiority of CHF 5993 pMDI relative to CHF 
1535 pMDI + Tiotropium was also demonstrated as the adjusted mean difference between treatments was -

0.003  L  (95%  CI  -0.033;  0.027),  with  a  lower  confidence  limit  well  above  the  pre-defined  non-inferiority 
margin of -0.050 L. 
The  safety  profile  of  the  dual  FDC  Foster  pMDI  has  been  previously  well  characterised  and  are  well  known. 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions with CHF 5993 were oral candidiasis (which occurred in 0.5% 
of the exposed subjects), which is normally associated with inhaled corticosteroids; muscle spasms (0.6%), 
which  can  be  attributed  to  the  long-acting  beta2-agonist  component;  and  dry  mouth  (0.5%),  which  is  a 
typical anticholinergic effect.  
ICS-containing  treatments  are  known  to  increase  the  risk  of  pneumonia  in  COPD  patients.  This  signal  was 
first identified in the TORCH study (Calverley et al 2007). This was a large clinical study of 3 years treatment 
duration comparing the fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination with its component parts and placebo 
in COPD patients. This study was assessed in 2010 for review of the risk of pneumonia in COPD patients by 
the CHMP Pharmacovigilance Working Party that concluded that the treatment with an ICS, either alone or in 
combination with a LABA, increases the risk of pneumonia in COPD patients. On 27 April 2015 the European 
Commission triggered a referral under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC to assess the benefit-risk balance of 
ICS containing medicinal products indicated in the treatment of COPD. The scientific outcome of the referral 
confirmed  the  risk  of  pneumonia  and  recommended  introducing  a  warning  in  section  4.4  for  all  ICS-
containing  products  intended  for  use  in  COPD  patients.  This  has  been  implemented  for  Trimbow.  The 
incidence of pneumonia events observed with CHF 5993 in both pivotal studies was low and within the range 
reported in several previous reported ICS/LABA studies. 
Cardiovascular  AEs  are  considered  additional  important  risk  for  the  combination  of  a  LABA  and  a  LAMA.  In 
study TRIPLE 5, the MACE rate per 1,000 patients per year was similar with both CHF 5993 pMDI and Foster 
pMDI. In study TRIPLE 6, the MACE rate per 1,000 patients per year was slightly higher with Tiotropium than 
with CHF 5993 pMDI and Foster pMDI + Tiotropium. Also, in other parameters (e.g. ECG, Heart rate, blood 
pressure) the changes were similar in the treatment groups. 
Overall, there is also no evidence that the safety of the triple FDC is worse than that of Foster, Tiotropium or 
Foster plus Tiotropium. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Reduction  of  acute  COPD  exacerbations  is  probably  the  most  important  benefit  expected  from 
pharmacological  therapy.  Patients  experiencing  a  moderate  to  severe  acute  exacerbation  generally  do  not 
fully  return  to  their  status  pre-exacerbation;  and  therefore  exacerbations  can  be  thought  of  as  punctuating 
the  patient’s  deterioration.  There  is  little  doubt  that  the  fixed  and  free  triple  combination  reduces 
exacerbations  to  a  greater  extent  than  the  fixed  dose  double  combination  and  both  to  approximately  the 
same extent which is helpful in validating the finding. 
Lung function particularly FEV1 is considered an important prognostic factor and FEV1 can be considered the 
‘best understood’ because it has been widely studied for several decades. It is considered to be a predictor of 
mortality  on  an  epidemiological basis  but,  paradoxically,  in  clinical  trials  improvement  in  lung  function  does 
not reduce mortality (though the TORCH study came close). In the present development there is reasonable 
evidence that triple therapy is more beneficial on lung function than double therapy. 
Symptomatic  benefit  is  the  most  difficult  to  measure  as  it  depends  on  an  arbitrary  scoring  systems  which 
must be validated against more objective measures in many clinical studies and over many years and is the 
most  variable  likely  to  ‘fail’  in  studies  but  in  the  present  development  there  is  evidence  of  benefit  of  triple

Trimbow

therapy as indicated by SGRQ total score and it reaches the threshold for clinical relevance which is generally 
considered to be a mean reduction of four or more points. 
As regards safety, all-cause mortality in the integrated analysis ranged from 1.5% to 2.7% across treatment 
arms and mortality attributed to COPD from 0.2% to 0.6%. For reference, in the TORCH study where patients 
had a similar degree of baseline lung function impairment, the 52 week all-cause mortality rates in the triple 
therapy arm was approximately 3%.  
The rate of pneumonia was probably within variability and the non-steroid tiotropium alone arm did not seem 
to have a convincing advantage in the rate of pneumonia; however the overall development was not powered 
to  show  that.  The  Applicant  has  taken  the  approach  of  presuming  that  CHF  5993  has  a  causal  association 
with pneumonia in COPD patients. 
The  known  class  associated  adverse  events  and  serious  adverse  events  of  the  active  substances  were  of  a 
frequency  and  nature  to  be  expected  and  can  all  be  considered  reversible  with  change  or  modification  of 
treatment.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance  
The CHMP discussed whether to replace “maintenance treatment” by “symptomatic treatment and prevention 
of  exacerbation”  would  be  considered  adequate.  It  was  the  CHMP  view  that  the  term  “maintenance 
treatment”  reflects  more  adequately  the  use  of  long-acting  therapies  in  COPD.  The  latter  part  of  the 
indication  (who  are  not  adequately  treated  by  a  combination  of  an  inhaled  corticosteroid  and  a  long-acting 
β2-agonist)  reflects  that there  is  currently  no  comparison  with  an  authorised LAMA+LABA  combination. The 
applicant agreed to amend the proposed indication in view of CHMP recommendation. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Trimbow is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Trimbow is favourable in the following indication: 
Maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) who are not adequately treated by a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting 
beta2-agonist (for effects on symptoms control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1).

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) Novartis Europharm Ltd submitted on 5 March 2015 an 
extension for a Marketing Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for EXJADE 
dispersible tablets 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg, through the centralised procedure falling under 
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1234/2008, Annex I 2(c). 
The MAH applied for a new pharmaceutical form (film-coated tablet) and three new strengths (90 mg, 
180 mg and 360 mg). 
EXJADE dispersible tablets are approved in the following indication: 
EXJADE is indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions 
(≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years 
and older. 
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups: 
in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood 
- 
transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
- 
in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood 
transfusions (<7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older, 
- 
in patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
EXJADE is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non-transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. 
The indications for the new film-coated tablets are the same.  
EXJADE was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/02/092 on 13/03/2002 in the following 
indication: Treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Iron overload is the result of many disorders inducing an increased net entry of iron within the body 
and can lead per se to the development of organ damage and increased mortality. It can be classified 
as primary or secondary depending whether it results from a primary defect in the regulation of iron 
balance or is secondary to other genetic or acquired disorders. A known example of primary iron 
overload is hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC), in which iron is absorbed in excess because of 
increased iron transfer from the enteral cells to the blood. The secondary includes iron overload either 
due to, or associated with, ineffective erythropoiesis, chronic liver diseases, parenteral administration 
or ingestion of excessive amounts of iron. Thalassemia major and sideroblastic anemia are the two 
best studied examples of iron overload secondary to blood transfusions and ineffective erythropoiesis. 
Frequent blood transfusions lead to excessive accumulation of iron with a toxic accumulation in 3 to 10 
years. 
The aim of treatment of iron storage disease is to remove from the body the excess iron that has 
accumulated. In the case of patients without primary disorders of hematopoiesis (i.e. primary 
hemochromatosis), this is best achieved by phlebotomy, since regeneration of erythrocytes by the 
marrow utilizes iron, which is therefore withdrawn from various body pools. Phlebotomy is only 
occasionally feasible. Patients who have augmented iron stores because of ineffective erythropoiesis 
and those in whom the iron overload is the result of multiple transfusions require treatment with an 
iron chelating agent to achieve safe levels of body iron. This is a slow process because only a small 
proportion of body iron is available for chelation at any moment. By increasing the doses of chelators 
in an attempt to speed up iron removal, there is a risk of increasing the toxicity of iron chelators by 
chelating iron, which is needed for normal tissue metabolism. Therefore, while the slow process of 
decreasing tissue iron to safe levels is being achieved, a second goal is to make the iron as safe as 
possible by binding the toxic iron pools responsible for causing tissue damage. Iron chelation therapy 
reduces iron-related morbidity, reduces and retards liver diseases, diabetes and other endocrine 
failures, normalizes growth and sexual development, prevents, and in some cases reverses, cardiac 
insufficiency and improves quality of life. Consequently iron chelation therapy dramatically reduces 
mortality. 
Deferoxamine mesylate was introduced about forty years ago on the basis of demonstrable clinical 
benefits on morbidity and mortality. Due to the challenges of administering deferoxamine by slow 
subcutaneous or intravenous infusion over 8 to 12 hours, five to seven nights per week, compliance is 
often poor, leading to less than optimal efficacy of this therapy in preventing complications. The oral 
iron chelator deferiprone is approved in Europe only for the treatment of iron-overloaded thalassemic 
patients who cannot adequately be treated with deferoxamine, or for whom deferoxamine is 
contraindicated (see SmPC Ferriprox). 
EXJADE contains the active substance deferasirox, an orally active iron chelator for the treatment of 
chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions. Deferasirox is indicated for the treatment of chronic 
iron overload due to frequent blood transfusion in patients with beta thalassemia major aged 6 years 
and older. It is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in the following patient groups:

- in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions (≥ 7 
ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years, 
- in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood transfusions (<7 
ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 years and older, 
- in patients with other anaemias aged 2 years and older. 
It is also indicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload requiring chelation therapy when 
deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or inadequate in patients with non transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia syndromes aged 10 years and older. 
Deferasirox is an orally active chelator highly selective for iron III that promotes excretion of iron 
excess primarily in the faeces. The active ingredient known as deferasirox (EXJADE), also referred to 
ICL670, is a tridentate iron chelator, formulated as dispersible tablet 125, 250 and 500 mg. EXJADE is 
orally administered at an initial dose of 20 mg/kg, once daily, on an empty stomach, at least 30 
minutes before eating. Starting doses of 10 or 30 mg/kg can also be used, depending on the frequency 
of the patient’s transfusions. 
The present submission is intended to support the registration of the film-coated tablet (FCT) 
formulation based on pharmacokinetic (PK) comparability with the approved dispersible tablet 
formulation. It is intended to be used for all currently approved deferasirox indications. 
2.2.  Quality aspects

Page 7/57 
 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
EXJADE 90, 180 and 360 mg film-coated tablets contain the same active substance, deferasirox, as 
that used to manufacture the already authorised dispersible tablets. The active substance is sourced 
from the same manufacturer, manufactured with the same process and released in accordance with 
the same active substance specifications. Therefore, the applicant presented no new information in the 
dossier to support this line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of development was to produce film-coated tablets, equivalent to the already approved 
dispersible tablets with the overall aim of improving patient compliance. The dispersible tablets contain 
lactose and sodium lauryl sulfate which are thought to cause gastro-intestinal side effects. In addition, 
the dispersible tablets are chalky and unpalatable once added to the required large volume of water 
indicated in the SmPC. One requirement of the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) was to develop a 
more palatable orally available dosage form and this current line extension fulfils that request. In 
addition, the film-coated tablets contain a higher percentage of active substance which reduces the 
dose burden for patients. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The quality target product 
profile (QTPP) was defined as an orally available immediate release dosage form, which can be 
swallowed easily, with equivalent in vivo performance to dispersible EXJADE tablets, sufficiently stable, 
and that meets compendial and other relevant quality standards. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) 
were identified as appearance, aspect, size, identity, assay, content uniformity, impurity profile, 
disintegration and dissolution times and microbial limits. 
Deferasirox is non-hygroscopic and practically insoluble in water. As a result, the active substance is 
micronized to reduce its particle size which is controlled by specification. The required polymorph is 
produced by the active substance manufacturing process carried out within the approved design space. 
It has good permeability and is thus BCS II, exhibiting dissolution limited biopharmaceutics. 
The choice of excipients used in the film-coated tablet formulation was based on compatibility test 
results of binary mixtures with the drug substance.  Excipients were chosen to optimize the dissolution 
profile and stability whilst minimizing adverse effects. In contrast to the existing dispersible tablets, 
the film-coated tablets do not contain lactose which will ensure better acceptance in lactose-intolerant 
patients. The film-coated tablets require less disintegrant as they are intended to be swallowed rather 
than dispersed. As a result, the percentage of active substance in the formulation increased resulting 
in smaller tablets which are easier to swallow. Sodium lauryl sulfate was replaced by poloxamer 188 to 
further reduce gastric irritation. Microcrystalline cellulose was added in order to improve flow 
properties and a wet granulation step introduced in order to increase bulk density. All excipients are 
well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are 
no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
A first clinical bioequivalence trial carried out with film-coated tablets of the same strengths (125, 250, 
500 mg) as the already approved dispersible tablets revealed that the new formulation has improved 
bioavailability. The content of active substance was thus reduced, resulting in the current 90, 180 and 
360 mg tablets. The 360 mg tablet was shown to be clinically equivalent to its dispersible 500 mg 
counterpart. A biowaiver for the lower strengths was sought based on comparison of f 2 values of 4x90 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/107225/2016  
Page 8/57 
 
 
 
 
 
mg tablets and 2x180 mg tablets vs 1x360 mg tablet. Since these were all >50 (range 63-99), then a 
biowaiver was considered justified. 
Development of the dissolution method took into account the low aqueous solubility of the active 
substance. The dissolution method is considered sufficiently discriminatory and fit for purpose. 
The formulation and manufacturing process development were evaluated through the use of risk 
assessment and iterative design of experiments (DoE) to identify the CQAs and critical process 
parameters (CPPs). A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) 
method and Ishikawa diagrams in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that 
may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on 
the prior knowledge of products with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on 
the experience from formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. 
A first DoE using 500 mg tablets explored ranges of excipient content and process parameters (PPs) 
identified as potentially critical in the initial risk assessment.  
Those parameters found to have significant impact on output only were set at optimum levels and 
those shown to impact on processability were carried forward into a pilot scale DoE using the revised 
360 mg strength at the commercial manufacturing site. Other parameters which could potentially be 
affected by scale-up were also examined in this DoE but not as main effects. Critical and non-critical 
process parameters have been defined. The outcome of these studies was that appropriate ranges for 
CPPs were included in the final design space. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PVDC/Aluminium blisters. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: blending of deferasirox with intra-granular 
excipients; wet granulation and drying; blending of granules with extra-granular excipients; 
compression; film-coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
A design space, developed at pilot scale (half commercial scale in the commercial equipment), has 
been proposed. The applicant plans to verify this on commercial scale in two stages. The first has been 
completed and involved running the process in the “worst case scenario” corners of the design space in 
terms of their impact on processability and CQAs for each tablet strength. This will later be 
complemented by running the process at the other corners of the design space. This design space 
verification strategy is considered acceptable. The completed verification batches have to date resulted 
in finished product meeting the required specifications. A multi-variate statistical process control 
method was developed for the granulation step using on-line process parameters to develop a model. 
This will be refined during the second phase of verification and used to monitor the process 
henceforward. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. The first part of 
the design space verification protocol is considered sufficient to validate the entire process since it 
constitutes more than three consecutive commercial scale batches run within the design space. It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The IPCs are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process.

Product specification  
The finished product is released on the market based on the design space and a combination of 
traditional final product release testing and real time release testing (RTRT). The finished product 
release specification includes appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and includes tests for 
appearance (as IPC), identity (NIR – RTRT and UV), identity of colourants (colour reaction and UV, skip 
testing), mean mass (as IPC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (content uniformity by 
NIR – RTRT and Ph. Eur.), degradants (based on design space and HPLC), microbial enumeration (Ph. 
Eur., skip testing) and assay (NIR – RTRT and HPLC). The RTRT NIR methods for uniformity of dosage 
units and assay and the strategy for control of degradants will all be supplemented by traditional 
release tests carried out in parallel until a sufficient number of commercial scale batches have been 
manufactured to validate the correlation. A post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) has 
been submitted documenting the strategy and is considered acceptable. The supplementary methods 
can also be used as alternative methods should technical issues prevent use of the at-line RTRT 
methods. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results for three commercial scale and four pilot scale batches of each strength were 
provided. The traditional release methods were used in lieu of the NIR method which will only be 
implemented for commercial batches. The batches all complied with the specifications confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of each strength of finished product stored for up to 24 
months under long term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH), up to 24 months under intermediate conditions 
(30 °C / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) in line with 
the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of EXJADE film-coated tablets are identical to and 
packed in the same primary packaging as those proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for 
appearance, assay, degradation products, dissolution and microbial quality. The analytical procedures 
used are stability indicating and are the same as those used for release testing. All results complied 
with the specification and no significant trends were observed to any of the measured parameters. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Batches were also exposed to extremes 
of temperature (between -20 and 50oC) and ambient humidity, and to freeze/thaw cycles. Again, no 
changes were observed to any of the measured parameters. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. The magnesium stearate used is 
of vegetable origin.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its 
manufacturing process. A design space has been proposed which has been partially verified on 
commercial scale using the worst case scenario combination of set-points. A design space verification 
protocol has been submitted and is considered adequate to demonstrate the validity of the design 
space at commercial scale. 
The product is intended to be released in the long term by RTRT. Until a sufficient number of 
commercial scale batches have been manufactured to demonstrate the correlation between RTRT 
methods and the standard release tests, these latter methods will be carried out in parallel and used to 
release product to the market. A PACMP has been submitted explaining steps which will be taken in 
order to demonstrate the relationship between the end-product specification and the RTRT. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical data submitted by the Applicant refers to 2 experimental pharmacokinetics studies 
testing 6 new formulations (3 tablets and 3 pellets). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were submitted with the current application. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The Applicant provided relative bioavailability studies conducted in dogs to support deferasirox new 
formulation development compared to DT. All previous in vitro and in vivo studies, which investigated 
the absorption, pharmacokinetics, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of deferasirox in 
laboratory species, including toxicokinetic (TK) studies performed during toxicity testing were included 
in the initial application.

Methods of analysis 
Deferasirox was analysed in dog plasma using a specific liquid chromatography–tandem mass 
spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) after solid phase extraction of the plasma samples. In both studies, 
the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.670 μmol/L using 100 μL plasma. The concentration 
range was: 0.67 – 26.8 µmol/l and the curve was linear.

Two PK studies (study 0900739 and study 1000323) conducted in dogs, at a single dose of 375 mg 
deferasirox were submitted. The goal of those studies was to investigate the PK of ICL670 after oral 
administration of new formulation variants in comparison to EXJADE DT in support of the choice of the 
pharmaceutical form.

The different formulations lead to a mean Cmax reached 2 hours post-dose. The maximal exposure 
and relative bioavailability was reached using formulation D in period 4 (non-coated pellets) and the 
minimal exposure and minimal bioavailability was obtained after treatment with non-coated pellet 
formulation C in period 3.  
The inter-individual variability regarding Cmax and AUC was moderate and similar among formulations. 
In comparison with EXJADE tablets the dosage of ICL670 as non-coated pellets, formulation D results 
in a higher relative bioavailability; the dosage of enteric coated pellets, formulation B results in similar 
bioavailability and the dosage of non-coated pellets, formulation C results in a lower relative 
bioavailability.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No new toxicology studies have been submitted with this procedure. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Currently the recommended starting dose of deferasirox as EXJADE dispersible tablets for oral 
suspension is 20 mg per kg per day for transfusional iron overload, respectively 10 mg per kg per day 
for NTDT, and is available as 125, 250 and 500 mg dispersible tablets. The new strength-adjusted film-
coated tablet will be dosed at a starting dose of 14 mg per kg per day for transfusional iron overload, 
respectively 7 mg per kg per day for NTDT and will be made available as 90, 180 and 360 mg film-
coated tablets. Based on the fact that the recommended doses of EXJADE will decrease with the 
current line extension and consequently environmental exposure with deferasirox is not expected to 
increase, no updated environmental risk assessment was submitted. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were submitted with the current application, so no data are 
provided regarding pharmacology. The lack of pharmacodynamic studies is addressed by the available 
clinical efficacy information and comparability of the film-coated tablet with dispersible tablets 
submitted as part of the clinical studies (see clinical aspects).  
In this application, regarding deferasirox film-coated tablet, relative bioavailability studies were 
performed in dogs to support new formulation development. Two PK studies were conducted in dogs, 
at a single dose of 375 mg deferasirox, the first one compared to tablets and the second one to pellets. 
The exposures were measured until 48 hours post-dose in both studies. The bioavailability relative to 
the DT was estimated for each formulation based on AUC0-48h values. The goal of those studies was to 
investigate the PK of ICL670 after oral administration of newly formulation variants in comparison to 
EXJADE DT to support the choice of a clinical disposable form. In pentagastrin treated dogs, the 
ICL670 non-enteric coated tablet showed a similar exposure compared to marketed EXJADE DT. 
Regarding the enteric coated tablet, a delayed time to reach maximal concentration and lower 
exposure was demonstrated, their bioavailability were about 2-fold lower compared to the marketed 
form. The study performed on pellet reported different result for non-coated and enteric one in terms 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/107225/2016  
Page 15/57 
 
 
 
 
 
of exposure AUC, Cmax. Similar bioavailability results are obtained between enteric coated pellet and 
suspension of EXJADE. Some effects on feces are observed with pellets, coated or not. 
Lack of non-clinical toxicology data is considered acceptable considering the available clinical safety 
and tolerance data.   
The recommended doses of EXJADE will decrease with the current line extension and consequently 
environmental exposure with deferasirox is not expected to increase. Therefore, deferasirox formulated 
as FCT is not expected to pose a risk to the environment different from those already identified for DT 
and the current environmental risk assessment is still considered applicable. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No further need to update the non-clinical documentation for deferasirox is identified with the 
submission of the film coated tablets formulation. The non-clinical information included in the SmPC 
was not updated as a result of this procedure.

Study F2101 
Design 
This study was designed to evaluate three new tablet formulations of deferasirox and was conducted in 
20 healthy volunteers using a single oral dose of 1500 mg (3 x 500 mg) under fasted condition. The 
design was a single-center, open-label, four-period randomized, cross-over study with four treatment 
periods and four treatment sequences (Figure 4). The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the 
four treatment sequences (5 subjects per treatment sequence) to receive the following treatments with 
each of three deferasirox new tablet formulations as well as the DT; A) wet granulation with low 
surfactant, B) wet granulation with medium surfactant, and C) wet granulation with medium surfactant 
and modified release enteric coating. Randomization to one of four treatment sequences (in a 1:1:1:1 
ratio) employed the Williams Square design, whereby each treatment followed the other treatment 
once. This open-label design did not need to control for bias reduction by stratification.

The study was conducted at Parexel Early Phase 1 Clinical Unit, Baltimore, MD, between the 18 Apr 
and 10 Jul 2011. 
To counteract the potential iron loss due to deferasirox, subjects were also dosed with iron 
supplements for eight days prior to the start of deferasirox treatment. This supportive treatment was 
an iron supplement, ferrous sulfate 325-mg strength oral tablet, which was equivalent to 65 mg Fe++. 
Treatment periods were separated by a washout period of 6 days. Blood samples for the determination 
of deferasirox concentrations in plasma were determined on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 at the following 
timepoints: pre-dose (0), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours post-dose. 
Figure 3. F2101 Study design overview and by period. 
Results 
Following a single oral dose of 1500 mg deferasirox, mean Cmax of deferasirox was achieved at 3 to 4 
hours post-dose in all formulations tested including the reference formulation. Deferasirox 
bioavailability of all three new tablet formulations was greater than that of the reference DT 
formulation. Percent increase in Cmax was comparable to that in AUC across the variants. The 
formulation with a low surfactant, Formulation A, was selected for further development of the FCT. 
Geometric mean ratio (test/reference) and its 90% confidence intervals for primary pharmacokinetic 
parameters are listed in Table 3. Deferasirox pharmacokinetic parameters are listed in Table 4.

Design 
The PK comparability study F2102 was designed to assess relative bioavailability of defersirox FCT 
versus defersirox DT formulation. The study was a single-center, open-label, randomized, cross-over 
study with two treatment periods and two treatment sequences (Figure 5) conducted in 32 healthy 
subjects. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment sequences (16 subjects

per treatment sequence). The subjects received two single doses of deferasirox, 1080 mg (3 x 360 
mg) deferasirox FCT, and 1500 mg (3 x 500 mg) deferasirox DT for oral suspension on Day 1 and Day 
10. The study drug was administered to subjects under fasting conditions and treatment periods were 
separated by a washout period of 9 days.

The supportive treatment was an iron supplement, ferrous sulfate 325-mg strength oral tablet, which 
was equivalent to 65 mg Fe++ (elemental iron). Natural ferrous sulfate, lot no. 11M840 with an 
expiration date of 31-Dec-2013, was manufactured by Rugby Laboratories Inc. 
The study was conducted at the center of Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) Phase I Clinic, 
PPD Development (Texas, US) between 19 July and 27 September 2012. 
Number of patients (planned and analyzed): 26 evaluable subjects were planned; 34 subjects were 
enrolled and randomized; and 32 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS) subjects were analyzed: by 
treatment sequence, 16 PAS subjects in Sequence I and 16 PAS subjects in Sequence II.

Results 
The bioavailability (AUClast and AUCinf) of the oral FCT administred at 1080 mg dose demonstrated 
comparability to the commercial DT, administered at 1500 mg, with geometric mean ratios of 1.00 
(90% CI: 0.932- 1.078) and 0.98 (0.916-1.059), respectively. Yet, following the single 1500-mg dose 
DT formualtion (i.e. the reference), deferasirox Cmax was observed at a median time of 3 h post-dose 
with Cmax averaging 81.54 μmol/L vs. a median time of 2 h post-dose with Cmax averaging 105.83 
μmol/L following the single 1080-mg dose delivered as an oral FCT. This yielded peak deferasirox 
concentrations 30% higher (geometric mean ratio, 1.30; 90% CI: 1.203-1.400) with the oral FCT than 
the commercial DT for oral suspension. 
Although Cmax did not meet the standard bioequivalence criteria, individual Cmax values from Study 
F2102 and Study F2103 (food effect study) are within the range of historical Cmax values observed 
with the DT formulation. Figure 7 includes Cmax data from (1) previous clinical pharmacology studies 
in healthy subjects given 20 mg/kg deferasirox DT (Study A2120, Study A2121, Study A2122), (2) FCT 
treatment in Study F2102, and (3) FCT treatment under fasted conditions in Study F2103. 
The arithmetic mean concentration-time profiles of deferasirox are shown in linear scales in Figure 6. 
Deferasirox primary pharmacokinetic parameters, and statistical analyses are shown in Table 6. 
Deferasirox secondary pharmacokinetic parameters are listed in Table 7. 
The PK exposure (AUC and Cmax) in the new oral FCT exhibited less variability, compared with that 
observed with the DT. Inter-subject variability (CV%) with FCT and DT were 44% vs. 49% for AUC and 
28% vs. 32% for Cmax, respectively (Figure 8).

Influence of food 
Study F2103 
The study was single-center, open-label, randomized, three-period, six sequence crossover evaluating 
the effect of food on deferasirox pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects. Twenty-five (25) healthy 
subjects received a single dose of 1080 mg (360 mg x 3) FCT under fasted, low-fat breakfast, or high-
fat breakfast conditions. Low-fat or high-fat breakfast had approximately 250 kcal or 1000 kcal with a 
fat content of 6.2% or 58.6%, respectively. A single dose of 1080 mg deferasirox FCT was 
administered with either a low-fat breakfast, high-fat breakfast, or under fasted conditions on study 
Days 1, 10, and 19. The treatment periods were separated by an 8-day washout period. The study was 
conducted between the 08-Jul-2013 to 05-Nov-2013. Iron supplement, ferrous sulfate 325-mg oral 
tablet; (equivalent to 65 mg elemental iron); was also given. 
Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the six Treatment Sequences in a ratio of 1:1:1:1:1:1. 
Four subjects were assigned to each Treatment Sequence to ensure three evaluable subjects in each 
Treatment Sequence to obtain at least 18 evaluable subjects. The dosing per treatment was as follows: 
• Treatment A: 3 x 360 mg FCTs for a total of 1080 mg, taken with a glass of water (240 mL) after 
overnight fasting for at least 10 hours. 
• Treatment B: three 360 mg FCTs for a total of 1080 mg, with a glass of water (240 mL), within 30 
minutes after the start of the low-fat breakfast (whole wheat English muffin, packet jelly (0.5 ounces), 
and fluid ounces skim milk) consisted of 6.2% fat.  
• Treatment C: On the day of Treatment C dosing, the subjects swallowed three 360 mg FCTs for a 
total of 1080 mg, with a glass of water (240 mL), within 30 minutes after the start of the high-fat 
breakfast (eggs fried in 2 teaspoons, slices of bacon, slices white toast with one teaspoon butter, 
ounces hash browns fried in 2 teaspoons butter, and fluid ounces whole milk) consisted of 58.6% fat.  
The entire breakfast had to be consumed by the subject prior to dosing.

Figure 8. F2103 Study design. 
A total of 28 subjects were randomized and included in Safety Set. Of these 28 subjects, 25 received 
at least one dose of deferasirox, and 24 subjects completed both end of treatment and end of study 
visit and included in Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set. 
Plasma deferasirox concentrations were determined on Days 1 through 4, 10 to 13 and 19 to 22 of 
Treatment Periods 1, 2 and 3 at the following time points: 0 (pre-dose) and at 0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 3 
h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 72 hours post-dose. 
Subjects who completed at least one period with test treatment (i.e. Single dose of 1080 mg 
deferasirox (3 x 360 mg film-coated tablets) under fasted conditions) and a period with reference 
treatment (i.e. under fed conditions, with low-fat or high-fat breakfast) with evaluable PK data, 
allowing at least one comparison between the test treatment and the reference treatment were 
included into the statistical analysis of the PK data. Each primary PK parameter (AUClast, AUCinf and 
Cmax) were analyzed separately using a linear mixed effect model with log-transformed PK 
parameters as the dependent variable, fitting terms for treatment, sequence and period as fixed 
effects, and subject nested within sequence as random effect. 
Results 
When a single dose of deferasirox was administered within 30 minutes after a low-fat breakfast 
compared to fasted conditions, the extent of absorption (AUC) was comparable, whereas the peak 
concentration (Cmax) was reduced by 16% on average.  The estimated geometric mean ratios for 
AUClast and AUCinf were 0.89 (90% CI: 0.84, 0.94) and 0.89 (90% CI: 0.84, 0.95), respectively. The 
estimated geometric mean ratio for Cmax was 0.84 (90% CI: 0.77, 0.90). When a single dose of 
deferasirox administered within 30 minutes after a high-fat breakfast compared to fasted conditions, 
the overall food effect on the extent of absorption was an increase of 18% in AUCinf and 29% in Cmax. 
In fact, the estimated geometric mean ratios for AUClast and AUCinf were 1.17 (90% CI: 1.11, 1.24) 
and 1.18 (90% CI: 1.11, 1.25), respectively. The estimated geometric mean ratio for Cmax was 1.29

(90% CI: 1.20, 1.39). Deferasirox primary pharmacokinetic parameters and statistical analyses are 
shown in Table 8. 
When deferasirox was administered under a fasting condition (with water), after a low-fat breakfast, 
and after a high-fat breakfast, the median Tmax (range) were 3 h (1.5 to 8.0 h), 4 h (3.0 to 8.0 h), 
and 4 h (1.5 to 8.0 h), respectively. Low-fat meal and high fat meal appeared to slightly delay the 
Tmax. The elimination kinetics (lambda_z and half-life) of deferasirox were comparable across 
treatments. The geometric mean terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) ranged from 12.3 to 13.0 h, after 
administration of deferasirox under fed or fasted conditions.

Methods 
The study was a randomized, open-label, single-center, four-period, four sequence crossover, single-
dose Phase I bioavailability study comparing a deferasirox granule formulation to the commercial 
dispersible tablet (reference) formulation. The granule formulation (400-mg deferasirox granules in 
bottles) was administered at single doses of 400 mg, 800 mg (2 × 400 mg), and 1200 mg (3 × 400 
mg). The reference formulation (3 x 500 mg DT for oral suspension) was administered at a single dose 
of 1500 mg. the second objective was to evaluate the dose-proportionality of deferasirox 
pharmacokinetics with the granule formulation in healthy subjects under fasted conditions. 
Dosing occurred on the first day of each treatment period. There was a 6-day washout between each 
dose.

Randomization to a treatment sequence employed a Williams Square design.  
The treatment duration was 8 days of iron supplementation followed by 4 single doses of deferasirox 
on days 1, 8, 15 and 22: Ferrous sulfate was to be administered as supportive treatment of 325-mg 
oral tablet -equivalent to 65 mg elemental iron. 
The sample size planned was 20 subjects to be randomized in order to get at least 16 evaluable 
subjects for the statistical analysis.

Blood collection: 3 mL lithium-heparin blood: Days 1 to 4, Days 8 to 11, Days 15 to 18, and Days 22 to 
25 at the following time points: 0 (pre-dose), 0.5 h, 1.0 h, 1.5 h, 2.0 h, 3.0 h, 4.0 h, 6.0 h, 8.0 h, 
12.0h, 24.0 h, 36.0 h, 48.0 h, and 72.0 h post-dose. 
Only subjects who completed at least one treatment period with the granule formulation (400-mg, 
800-mg and 1200-mg) and the treatment period for the reference formulation (1500-mg DT) with 
evaluable PK data were included into the statistical analysis of the pharmacokinetic data. The 
bioavailability of three doses of the granule formulation (400 mg, 800 mg, 1200 mg) was compared to 
that of the commercial formulation at a dose of 1500 mg. Each dose-normalized PK parameter was 
analyzed separately using a linear mixed model with the dose-normalized log-transformed PK 
parameters as the dependent variable and fitting sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects, and 
subject-within sequence as random effect. Dose proportionality was examined using a power model 
(PK parameter=a Doseb × error) for 3 granule formulation doses (400 mg, 800 mg, 1200 mg). 
Results 
The study was conducted between the 12th July 2012 and the 30th October 2012. 
Numbers analyzed were: 39 subjects were enrolled of which 21 subjects were included in the

As compared to the reference formulation, the bioavailability (based on dose normalized AUClast and 
AUCinf) of deferasirox was 7% to 8%, 20% to 21%, and 25% greater with the 400-mg granules, 800-
mg granules, and 1200-mg granules treatment groups. Dose-normalized Cmax was also increased by 
65%, 62%, and 47% with the 400-mg granules, 800-mg granules, and 1200-mg granules treatment 
groups, respectively, as compared to the DT. This expected increase was the reason for adjusting the 
strength of the granule formulation. 
Without dose-normalization, AUCinf and AUClast at the 1200-mg granule deferasirox treatment were 
equivalent to that of 1500-mg DT, although Cmax was higher by 18%. The geometric mean ratios for 
AUCinf, AUClast and Cmax were 1.00, 1.00 and 1.18 for 1200-mg granules treatment group, respectively, 
when compared to the DT (reference). 
Deferasirox primary pharmacokinetic parameters by treatment are listed in Table 9. Geometric mean 
ratio (test/reference) and its 90% confidence intervals for primary pharmacokinetic parameters are 
listed in Table 10.

The analysis of dose proportionality of PK parameters after a single dose of granule deferasirox 
formulation (400, 800 and 1200 mg in healthy subjects is summarized in Table 11. 
Following a single dose of granule deferasirox (400, 800, and 1200 mg), AUC and Cmax values 
increased with increasing doses of deferasirox granules. The estimated proportionality coefficients 
(beta) for AUClast, AUCinf and Cmax were 1.13 (90% CI 1.07, 1.19), 1.13 (90% CI 1.07, 1.20) and 
0.90 (90% CI 0.79, 1.01), respectively. Despite the study was not powered to assess dose-
proportionality, the 90% CI for the slope for AUClast and AUCinf after a single dose of granule 
deferasirox (400, 800, and 1200 mg) was within the target region of 0.80-1.20. For Cmax, the lower 
bound (0.79) of the 90% CI was slightly below the pre-defined interval. Thus, AUC was considered to 
increase dose proportionally across the three dose levels and Cmax was considered approximately 
dose-proportional between 400 and 1200-mg single doses tested in healthy subjects.

Results were based on the power model: ln (PK parameter) = ln(a) + beta*ln(Dose) + error. 
* The 90% CI for the slope is to be within the target region of [0.80–1.20] to conclude dose-proportionality

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
To investigate the expected clinical impact of increased Cmax observed with the FCT and the granules 
on either efficacy or safety, a retrospective exposure-response analysis [A2409 PK/PD analysis] was 
conducted on a large clinical trial database. The data were from study A2409 (efficacy and safety study 
over 52 weeks) which included 1744 patients diagnosed with transfusion dependent iron overload who 
received one year deferasirox treatment. 
Patient Population  
The target patient pool consisted of patients with a serum ferritin level of ≥ 1000 ng/mL or patients 
presenting with a serum ferritin level <1000 ng/mL but with history of multiple transfusions (>20 
transfusions or 100 mL/kg of packed red blood cells) and LIC >2 mg Fe/g dry weight. 
deferasirox doses  
The initial recommended daily dose of deferasirox DT was 20 mg/kg/day body weight for patients, who 
had received blood transfusions with a frequency of about 2 to 4 units/month of packed red blood cells. 
An initial daily dose of 10 mg/kg/day or 30 mg/kg/day was permitted for patients receiving less or 
more frequent blood transfusions, respectively. Average daily dose for all patients was 22.22 mg/kg 
(SD: 5.921), with the majority of these patients having no dose interruptions (77.6%), or only one 
dose interruption (15.1%). 
Efficacy parameter 
Change in serum ferritin from baseline was the defined primary endpoint of the study. It was collected 
at Baseline (Week 1 Day 1) and at Week 12 and Week 28. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/107225/2016  
Page 32/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety parameters 
- Approximately one third of β-thalassemia patients treated with deferasirox had ≥ 2 consecutive dose-
dependent increases in serum creatinine that were >33% above baseline mostly within the normal 
range. Since, the effect of deferasirox on renal laboratory values is well documented, renal laboratory 
parameters (serum creatinine and creatinine clearance) were the safety parameters used in this 
analysis. 
These parameters were collected at Baseline and Week 4, Week 12 and Week 28. 
Creatinine clearance was calculated from the laboratory reported values of serum creatinine using 
Cockroft-Gault formula for adults and Schwarz’s formula for pediatric (<16 years) patients. 
- Other laboratory parameters such as liver function tests (ALT) did not show any relationship to 
exposure, in exploratory analyses. 
Pharmacokinetic data 
PK data were collected in a large sub-group of patients (N = 1112) at pre-dose (Ctrough) and 2 hr 
post-dose (C2h) on Visit 3 (Day 1), Visit 6 (Week 12) and Visit 10 (Week 28) and EOS. Blood collection 
for PK analysis was only performed in patients who had been on deferasirox treatment without dose 
adjustment or treatment interruption for at least 4 days prior to scheduled PK sampling. 
The plasma concentration-time profile that yields AUC in the steady state includes Ctrough, which is 
highly associated with AUC. Thus, Ctrough,ss at Week 12 and Week 28 are considered as surrogate 
markers for AUC. Similarly, steady state concentrations collected at 2 hr post-dose (C2h,ss at Week 12 
and Week 28) are used as a surrogate marker for Cmax. 
Concentrations at 2 h post dose are within the range of deferasirox Cmax, which is achieved between 
1.5 to 4.3 h in patients for the dose range of 5-30 mg/kg in various studies. 
The PK/PD analyses in this report use C2h collected on Day 1, and Ctrough,ss and C2h,ss collected on 
both Week 12 and Week 28. Analyses were performed on the parent compound deferasirox. Data from 
iron complex were not included in the statistical analysis. 
Objectives 
The analysis focused on investigating the relationship between PK parameters (C2h and Ctrough) and 
1) renal laboratory changes (serum creatinine and creatinine clearance), and 2) the efficacy parameter 
(serum ferritin). 
Results 
The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics relationship for deferasirox has been evaluated using a large 
clinical trial in the target population (n= 1112). Efficacy (serum ferritin change from baseline) and 
safety (serum creatinine and creatinine clearance change from baseline) endpoints could be acceptable 
as valid indicators of deferasirox treatment. Similarly, for PK parameters, it’s acceptable that pre-dose 
or trough concentrations at steady state (Ctrough,ss at Week 12 and Week 28) were used as a 
surrogate marker for AUC and concentrations collected at 2 hours (C2h at Day 1, C2h,ss at Week 12 
and Week 28) were used as a surrogate for Cmax. 
In this study patients received the EXJADE dispersible tablets and not the new formulation (FCT). 
Nevertheless, since the PK/PD relationship is driven by the active substance and not the 
pharmaceutical form, conclusions from the provided analyses are expected to be also valid for the FCT 
formulation.

A covariate analysis using a proportional odds model was performed to determine the relative impact 
of each PK parameter on renal function. Specifically, the probability of worsening in renal function was 
estimated with a proportional odds model including exposure and Cmax as potential explanatory 
variables. The analysis showed that Ctrough had a strong impact on creatinine clearance change in 
categories (p<0.0001) but C2h,ss had minimal impact (p=0.2544) after adjusting for Ctrough,ss. 
Furthermore, a C2h,ss increase by 1.7-fold would provide an odds ratio of worsening from baseline in 
creatinine clearance categories of 1.146 (0.906, 1.449). 
The relationship between PK parameters at steady state (Ctrough,ss and C2h,ss) and efficacy (as 
described by serum ferritin) was further investigated by using a linear mixed model of log-transformed 
serum ferritin values (using observations at week 12 and 28) with patient included in model as a 
random effect. 
After log-transformation, baseline creatinine levels, C2h,ss and Ctrough,ss were included as predictors 
in the model. As shown in Table 12, the results of this analysis showed that at steady state, Ctrough 
has a statistically significant impact (p<0.001) on the changes in serum ferritin while C2h has no 
statistically significant impact (p=0.130). In particular, after adjusting for Ctrough,ss, an increase in 
C2h,ss by 70% would lead to a change of -1.28 % (90% CI: - 2.65%, 0.12%) in the percent change 
from baseline in serum ferritin. 
Table 12. Analysis of serum ferritin values versus steady state PK parameters –Week 12 and 
Week 28 (Safety set) 
A similar conclusion could be drawn regarding the relationship of AUC and Cmax to efficacy (serum 
ferritin change from baseline). A log-linear mixed model was used with AUC and Cmax as covariates in 
an attempt to distinguish between the two PK parameters. At steady state, Ctrough has a statistically 
significant impact (p<0.001) on the changes in serum ferritin while C2h has no statistically significant 
impact (p=0.130). In particular, after adjusting for Ctrough,ss, an increase in C2h,ss by 70% would 
lead to a change of -1.28% (90% CI: -2.65%, 0.12%) in the percent change from baseline in serum 
ferritin which is clinically insignificant. 
Based on these results, it is agreed that higher Cmax in patients with a same or similar AUC will not 
result in clinically significant changes in renal laboratory values or serum ferritin changes from 
baseline, as AUC is the key parameter for assessing deferasirox safety and efficacy. Therefore, the 
observed differences (mean increase of 30%) in Cmax between the DT and the FCT are not expected to 
be clinically relevant.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Deferasirox is available in the EU as a dispersible tablet (DT) for once daily administration at strengths 
of 125 mg, 250mg and 500 mg. The pharmacokinetics of deferasirox has been well characterized in 
healthy volunteers and in iron-overloaded patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/107225/2016  
Page 34/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The new FCT formulation has been developed as equivalent formulation to the DT. Based on the 
improved bioavailability of the FCT, three strengths of the FCT as 90 mg, 180 mg and 360 mg (which 
are compositionally proportional) were developed based on dose-adjusted approach and PK 
comparability to the approved dispersible tablet formulation. 
The MAH submitted four clinical pharmacology studies in healthy subjects. Methodology used is 
adequate and in compliance with acceptance selectivity and sensitivity criteria. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters such as AUCinf, AUClast, Cmax, T1/2 and Tmax of deferasirox in plasma were estimated 
using non-compartmental analysis in line with current guidelines by a linear mixed effects model. In all 
pharmacokinetic studies, the amount of drug used was selected to be approximately equivalent to the 
clinically relevant recommended starting dose of 20 mg/kg of the dispersible tablet. The dose of 1080 
mg used for the FCT formulation is estimated to be in the range of 15-25 mg/kg of the dispersible 
tablet formulation. The design, number of subjects, strengths and dosing used is acceptable. The 
washout period (between 6 to 9 days depending on study) is considered adequate (with expected half-
life for deferasirox between 8 and 16h) to allow the complete elimination of the drug before 
subsequent dosing and to minimize the possibility of a carry-over effect. 
EXJADE film-coated tablets demonstrate higher bioavailability compared to the EXJADE dispersible 
tablet formulation. After adjustment of the strength, the film-coated tablet formulation (360 mg 
strength) was equivalent to EXJADE dispersible tablets (500 mg strength) with respect to the mean 
area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) under fasting conditions. The Cmax was 
increased by 30% (90% CI: 20.3% - 40.0%). However a clinical exposure/response analysis revealed 
no evidence of clinically relevant effects of such an increase. 
Deferasirox (dispersible tablet formulation) is absorbed following oral administration with a median 
time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) of about 1.5 to 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability 
(AUC) of deferasirox (dispersible tablet formulation) is about 70% compared to an intravenous dose. 
The absolute bioavailability of the film-coated tablet formulation has not been determined. 
Bioavailability of deferasirox film-coated tablets was 36% greater than that with dispersible tablets. 
(See SmPC section 5.2.) The PK exposure (AUC and Cmax) of the new oral FCT was found to exhibit 
less variability, compared with that observed with the DT. Inter-subject variability (CV%) with FCT and 
DT were 44% vs. 49% for AUC and 28% vs. 32% for Cmax, respectively. 
Based on the improved bioavailability of the FCT observed in the pilot study, a dose-adjusted approach 
was taken in study F2102 (pivotal PK comparability study). The study followed a two-period 
randomized cross-over design in 32 healthy subjects, and compares the relative bioavailability of the 
highest dose strength of deferasirox (360 mg) FCT at 1080 mg dose and the marketed DT (500 mg) at 
1500 mg dose under fasted conditions, in accordance with EMA CHMP guidance 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr 2010). The bioavailability (AUClast and AUCinf) of two 
formulations (1080 mg FCT and 1500 mg DT) were equivalent based on the reference bioequivalence 
criteria of 80-125%, with geometric mean ratios of 1.00 (90% CI: 0.932- 1.078) and 0.98 (0.916-
1.059), respectively. However, the peak concentration of the FCT was 30% higher, with Cmax 
averaging 105.83 μmol/L vs. Cmax averaging 81.54 μmol/L for the DT. 
Study F2103 (food effect study) compared pharmacokinetics of deferasirox FCT (3 x 360 mg) under 
both fed (immediately after a high fat or a low fat breakfast) and fasted conditions in 25 healthy 
subjects. The results indicated that AUCs was increased by 18% (90% CI: 1.11, 1.25) and the Cmax 
by 29% (90% CI: 1.20, 1.39) when the new FCT formulation of deferasirox was taken after a high-fat 
meal. Whereas, AUC was reduced in average by 11% (90% CI meet the bioequivalence criteria 80-
125%) and the Cmax was reduced by 16% (90% CI: 0.77, 0.90), when deferasirox was taken with

Page 35/57 
 
 
 
 
 
low-fat meal. Deferasirox absorption was slightly prolonged with a median Tmax being from 3 to 4 
hours. Otherwise the corresponding elimination half-life under fed conditions was similar to that under 
fasting conditions. Overall, systemic availability of the new FCT formulation deferasirox under fed 
conditions was only slightly modified and so the food effect is not expected to be clinically relevant. 
However, taking into account the difference in Cmax under fasted conditions between the formulations, 
i.e. Cmax with the FCT is 30% higher than with the DT, it is not recommended to take the FCT with a 
high-fat meal due to potential additive effect. 
In summary the food-effect study involving administration of the film-coated tablets to healthy 
volunteers under fasting conditions and with a low-fat (fat content <10% of calories) or high-fat (fat 
content >50% of calories) meal indicated that the AUC and Cmax were slightly decreased after a low-fat 
meal (by 11% and 16%, respectively). After a high-fat meal, AUC and Cmax were increased (by 18% 
and 29%, respectively). The increases in Cmax due to the change in formulation and due to the effect 
of a high-fat meal may be additive and therefore, it is recommended that the film-coated tablets 
should be taken either on an empty stomach or with a light meal. The information is reflected in the 
SmPC sections 5.2. 
The dose-proportionality of deferasirox PK has been characterized in study F2104. The study was 
conducted on 21 healthy subjects and using the granule formulation. Following a single dose of granule 
deferasirox, the increase in mean deferasirox exposure (AUC), and peak concentration (Cmax) is dose 
proportional in the dose range of 400 to 1200 mg. Indeed, the estimated proportionality coefficients 
(beta) and the 90% confidence interval for AUClast 1.13 (90% CI 1.07, 1.19), AUCinf 1.13 (90% CI 
1.07, 1.20) and Cmax 0.90 (90% CI 0.79, 1.01) were within the target region of 0.80 - 1.20. 
Consequently, pharmacokinetics of the FCT is expected to be dose-proportional since basic PK 
characteristics are considered same or similar between the granules and the FCT given that the 
composition is identical except that the granules are uncoated. 
An additional PK/PD analysis [Study A2409] included in this submission used a statistical model to 
assess the influence of Cmax and other PK parameters on efficacy and safety. The pharmacokinetic-
pharmacodynamics relationship for deferasirox has been evaluated using a large clinical trial in the 
target population (n= 1112). Efficacy (serum ferritin change from baseline) and safety (serum 
creatinine and creatinine clearance change from baseline) endpoints are acceptable as valid indicators 
of deferasirox treatment. Similarly, for PK parameters, it is considered acceptable that pre-dose or 
trough concentrations at steady state (Ctrough,ss at Week 12 and Week 28) were used as a surrogate 
marker for AUC and concentrations collected at 2 hours (C2h at Day 1, C2h,ss at Week 12 and Week 
28) were used as a surrogate for Cmax. These results support the notion that total drug exposure, AUC, 
is the key parameter predicting safety and efficacy of deferasirox. The available safety and efficacy and 
exposure data for deferasirox across age groups support the conclusion that a modest increase in Cmax 
is not clinically meaningful; total drug exposure, AUC, is the key parameter predicting safety and 
efficacy of deferasirox.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology data available support the comparability of the two formulations. Relevant 
information has been included in the SmPC. 
Results concerning the consequences of the higher Cmax of the new formulation are reassuring. 
However these need to be considered in the light of clinical efficacy and safety data (see later 
sections).

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
No data on clinical efficacy were submitted. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application cross-refers to the existing efficacy data generated with the dispersible tablet 
formulation for which pharmacology data on bioavailability and comparability are discussed under the 
clinical pharmacology section.  
Iron chelation is a physicochemical process, and the dose-dependent efficacy of chelation therapy has 
been previously demonstrated for deferasirox as well as for other chelators such as deferoxamine. 
Following the pharmacology data available showing higher bioavailability of the film-coated tablet as 
compared to the current formulation when switching from dispersible tablets to film-coated tablets, the 
dose of the film-coated tablets should be 30% lower than the dose of the dispersible tablets, rounded 
to the nearest whole tablet; therefore the starting dose for film-coated tablets should usually be 14 
mg/kg/day. Starting doses of 7 or 21 mg/kg can also be used, depending on the frequency of the 
patient’s transfusions. Adjustment steps are 3.5 - 7 mg/kg and a maximum dose 28 mg/kg/day (See 
section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Based on the results from PK/PD analysis (Study A2409) using a statistical model to assess the 
influence of Cmax and other PK parameters on efficacy, the moderately higher Cmax values (30% 
increase) observed with the new film-coated tablet formulation are not expected to be clinically 
relevant and efficacy of the new dosage form are expected to be comparable to the current dispersible 
tablet (See Clinical Pharmacology section).  
Over the years, the MAH has received reports on certain features of the current deferasirox 
formulation being undesirable with a potential impact on compliance. Indeed, the chalky texture of the 
dispersion is described as unpalatable, and this is compounded by the volume that must be consumed 
(100-250 mL), and the fact that it must be taken on an empty stomach. This is especially true for 
young children where the features of the drug are reported to reduce adherence to treatment. Novartis 
developed the film-coated tablet deferasirox formulation in order to improve palatability and 
convenience of the drug, and potentially improve adherence to treatment. Results from Study 
CICL670F2201 are expected to bring more information on the benefits of the new deferasirox 
formulation (film-coated tablet) in comparison to the commercially approved dispersible tablet (See 
RMP). 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The available data on clinical pharmacology support cross reference of clinical efficacy to the original 
submission. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
- 
The MAH shall submit the results of a Phase II safety study investigating the benefits of the 
new deferasirox formulation (film-coated tablet) in comparison to the commercially approved 
dispersible tablet:  final study report due September 2016.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The overall exposure in the four clinical pharmacology studies is summarized in the table below. 
In Study F2104, one subject missed the 800 mg and 1200 mg doses of granules due to a protocol 
deviation. 
Table 13: Overall exposure in the clinical pharmacology studies 
Adverse events 
In subjects receiving FCT, the most commonly adverse events were diarrhoea, dyspepsia and 
headache. These events were described as common with the dispersible tablets. 
In study F2102 most TEAE were mild. 2 subjects had TEAEs moderate in severity. One event of 
headache and one of dizziness were considered moderate in intensity in patients treated with FCT.  
In study 2103, the majority of TEAEs were mild in nature, except the AE vomiting which was 
moderate. 
No grade 3-4 adverse events were observed in healthy volunteers taking the FCT.  
The MAH provided interim results of a confirmatory clinical safety (study F2201). Study ICL670F2201 
is an open-label, randomized, multicenter, two arm, Phase II study in male and female patients aged ≥ 
10 years with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The 
randomization is stratified by prior deferasirox treatment and by underlying disease. The study has a 
treatment duration of 24 weeks. Overall safety is the primary objective of this study and will be 
addressed by measuring the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) and changes in laboratory 
values, of deferasirox film coated tablet (FCT) and deferasirox dispersible tablet (DT). In addition, 
safety is also addressed by assessing adverse events of special interest (AESI) including selected 
gastrointestinal AEs of diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 
In order to assess longer term safety over multiple months, the data cut off was set to include any 
patient who completed at least 3 months on treatment by the interim cut-off date (25-Mar-2015) 
and/or at least one Week 13 safety assessment performed by the cut-off date. 
At the time of the interim data cut-off, 65 of 173 patients were enrolled in the study (DT: 32 patients; 
FCT: 33 patients). Of these patients, 15 patients in each arm had completed at least 3 months of 
treatment and were included in the interim analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/107225/2016  
Page 38/57 
 
 
 
 
 
  
As expected, gastrointestinal AEs were the most frequent AEs observed in this study. The number of 
patients experiencing GI AEs was similar in both arms. 
These events are not reported more frequently in the new formulation of FCT than in patients on DT in 
this interim analysis data set. It can also be acknowledged that the selected GI AEs was numerically 
lower in the FCT arm than in the DT arm.  
As regard drug-related AEs, increased urine protein/creatinine ratio have been noted in both 
formulations. As regard severe AEs, two patients in the DT group experienced SAEs (dehydration, renal 
impairment, and viral infection) whereas no patient in the FCT group.  
The safety profile of FCT when the tablet is crushed deserved to be discussed.  
FCT would allow patients who have difficulty in swallowing whole tablets, to take crushed tablets with 
soft food such as apple sauce and yogurt. However, Novartis did not collect any clinical data on the 
tolerability of the crushed tablet. 
Data on the GI tolerability of the crushed FCT formulation, particularly in the youngest population are 
to be provided.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
One patient in the FCT group experienced severe gastro-intestinal AE (abdominal pain). 
No deaths occurring within 30 days of the last dose were reported in the pharmacokinetic studies with 
FCT. 
No deaths occurring within 3 months of study F2201 were reported in interim report. 
Laboratory findings 
No data. 
Safety in special populations 
The safety profile of two paediatric patients treated with FCT looks comparable to the known safety 
profile of deferasirox DT. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data submitted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No dose interruptions due to AE were observed in the FCT arm of in the Interim report of study F2201. 
Post marketing experience 
In the USA, deferasirox FCT were approved by the FDA on 30 March 2015 under the invented name 
Jadenu and launched on 1st April 2015. Between April and September, approximately 60% of patients 
(1,820 patients) had switched from dispersible tablets (DT) to FCT and about 1,180 patients were 
prescribed FCT. 
On 22 October 2015, a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) was approved by the FDA for the 
addition of crushing instructions to the US Prescribing Information. Due to the very recent sNDA 
approval, only very few patients are expected to have received crushed FCT. Nevertheless, a review 
was performed on the data retrieved from the Novartis safety database for the period 01.11.2014 to 
31.10.15, corresponding to the latest Periodic Safety Update Report. Outputs for identified and

potential risks (renal disorders, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and ulceration, hearing loss, increased 
transaminases/hepatitis/hepatic failure, lens opacities, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, other severe skin 
reactions, peripheral blood cytopenias) were reviewed, as well as outputs for medication errors, for 
paediatric cases of the ages 2-6 years and for the entire System Organ Class Gastrointestinal 
Disorders. These outputs were searched to identify cases coded for crushed film-coated deferasirox 
tablets or for cases coded for Jadenu which were reviewed for information regarding crushing of film-
coated tablets. No cases were identified. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The submission was based on exposure data from studies conducted in 60 healthy volunteers where 
subjects in phase I studies received only 1 to 3 doses of 1080 mg of FCT and no exposure data in a 
long term is available. Moreover, deferasirox is often used in children whereas healthy volunteers are 
adult patients. 
Only results of studies F2102 and F2103 have an informative value on the comparison of the two 
formulations therefore, confirmatory clinical safety results have been requested in patients receiving 
FCT during several months (study F2201). In the interim report, there is no apparent new safety signal 
emerging from limited data on comparison of the 2 formulations from this study, however the number 
of patients for whom the clinical data are exploitable and particularly the number of patients <18 years 
of age (DT: 5 patients; FCT: 2 patients), is too low for any conclusion to be made.  
No grade 3-4 adverse events were observed in healthy volunteers taking the FCT. However, such data 
are insufficient to draw reliable conclusions on the safety profile of this new formulation in patients. 
Supplementary data are needed and more specifically, a special attention should be taken to the renal 
safety of FCT (both in a short and long term). 
It was noted that even in healthy volunteers treated with one to three doses of deferasirox, 
gastrointestinal side effects have been observed with the new formulation. Therefore the film coated 
tablet could not be associated with a better gastro-intestinal tolerability at this stage of the 
assessment. In addition further data have been requested in terms of tolerability of the crushed 
formulation in view of the side effects already observed with the dispersible tablet (oesophagitis, 
stomatitis and mouth ulceration, gastric ulcers and haemorrhage). 
As expected, gastrointestinal AEs are the most frequent AEs observed, and the number of patients 
experiencing GI AEs was similar in both arms. It can also be acknowledged that the selected GI AEs 
was numerically lower in the FCT arm than in the DT arm but due to the small sample set it cannot be 
stated that the GI tolerability is better for the FCT than the DT. Therefore an improved gastro-
intestinal tolerability of the film coated tablet cannot be claimed since more definitive data need to be 
provided by the final study report planned to be submitted post-approval.  
As regard drug-related AEs, increased urine protein/creatinine ratio, have been noted in both 
formulations. Renal disorders have already been identified as important risk in the RMP. The applicant 
plans to submit the final CSR of study F2201 in September 2016 (see RMP and annex II). This 
additional PV activity has been added to characterize the safety of this new formulation (FCT) as 
missing information (See RMP). 
Although no conclusion can be drawn due to the low number of patients for whom the clinical data are 
exploitable and particularly the number of patients <18 years of age (DT: 5 patients; FCT: 2 patients), 
the safety profiles of patients treated with deferasirox FCT and deferasirox DT look comparable. 
There is no apparent new safety signal emerging from these limited data.

Regarding the GI tolerability of the crushed FCT formulation, no data exist on the tolerability of the 
crushed formulation particularly used in the youngest population. Novartis provided a review of data 
from their safety database corresponding to the period covered by the latest PSUR (01.11.2014 to 
31.10.15). No cases were identified by the MAH in which the FCT were reported to have been crushed 
for patient administration during this period. However, addition of FCT crushing instructions were only 
approved by the FDA on 22nd October 2015, therefore this way of administration is not covered by the 
report.  
After reviewing these first data since the recent launch in the US, no safety signal seems to emerge 
regarding the use of crushed FCT  but these preliminary observations were based on limited data and 
cannot totally rule out the remaining uncertainties with crushed tablet (especially in youngest 
patients). In order to document the safety profile of crushed formulation especially in the youngest 
population, the MAH is therefore asked to document the safety profile in patients taking the crushed 
FCT formulation from reports obtained in the post-marketing setting particularly for children < 10 
years. (See RMP). 
In addition, the applicant has taken advantage of the on-going amendment of the PASS protocol 
EMEA/H/C/PSP/0010.4.A.1 aiming at assessing the safety of deferasirox in the treatment of pediatric 
patients with nontransfusion-dependent iron overload, to provide relevant safety data of the FCT 
formulation for the pediatric population (between 10-17 years-old). 
The safety in the youngest children (particularly <6 yrs) is not known (missing information – see RMP), 
for the new formulation (FCT) especially when the tablets are crushed. Therefore, the MAH proposed 
an additional PV activity to characterise the paediatric safety profile. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been assessed and relevant information included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (See 
SmPC section 4.4, 4.8.) 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of the film coated tabled is in line with the already known characteristics of the 
currently approved formulation. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety (See Annex 
II): 
- 
The MAH shall conduct an observational cohort study in paediatric non-transfusion-dependent 
thalassaemia patients over 10 years old for whom deferoxamine is contraindicated or 
inadequate, in order to assess the long-term exposure and safety of deferasirox dispersible 
and film-coated tablets, based on a CHMP-agreed protocol; final study report due June 2021. 
- 
The MAH shall conduct a study to assess the safety of deferasirox film-coated tablets in the 
paediatric population (especially when the tablets are crushed); final study report due June 
2021.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
No new data on clinical efficacy were submitted as part of this application. 
EXJADE was approved as an efficient oral iron chelator able to reverse iron overload and maintain 
normal values in patients suffering from various transfusion dependent conditions; the initial approval 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/107225/2016  
Page 50/57 
 
 
 
 
 
was based on a non-inferiority against deferoxamine as second line treatment in beta-thalassemic 
patients with infrequent transfusions. Iron chelation is a physicochemical process, and the dose-
dependent efficacy of chelation therapy has been previously demonstrated for deferasirox as well as 
for other chelators such as deferoxamine. This application for a film coated tablet formulation cross-
refers to the existing efficacy data generated with the dispersible tablet formulation and pharmacology 
data in healthy volunteers.  
After adjustment of the strength, the film-coated tablet formulation (360 mg strength) was equivalent 
to EXJADE dispersible tablets (500 mg strength) with respect to the mean area under the plasma 
concentration time curve (AUC) under fasting conditions. The Cmax was increased by 30% (90% CI: 
20.3% - 40.0%); however a clinical exposure/response analysis revealed no evidence of clinically 
relevant effects of such an increase. Bioavailability of deferasirox film-coated tablets was 36% greater 
than that with dispersible tablets. 
An additional PK/PD analysis [Study A2409] included in this submission confirmed the influence of AUC 
and Cmax on efficacy. The available data fully support the therapeutic equivalence of the strength-
adjusted new FCT formulation. The starting dose calculated on the basis of a higher bioavailability is 
14 mg/kg body weight. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There are no data on direct comparison of the efficacy of the FCT vs the DT formulation.  
The MAH will submit the results of a Phase II safety study investigating the benefits of the new 
deferasirox formulation (film-coated tablet) in comparison to the commercially approved dispersible 
tablet (EXJADE) (see Annex II and RMP).  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
There is no apparent new safety signal emerging from the limited data available in healthy volunteers 
and post-marketing data from the US assessed in the last PSUR. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Exposure to the new formulation was very low in the clinical trials submitted and in healthy volunteers. 
As the product has been approved in the US, post-marketing data were made available. No conclusion 
can be drawn from the interim report from study F2201 due to the low number of patients included 
and treated so far, except that the number of AE are numerically lower with FCT than with DT 
formulation and that there is no apparent new safety signal emerging from these limited data. The 
study F2201 will be completed post approval (see Annex II). 
No data exist on the tolerability of the new formulation (FCT) in paediatric population < 10 years. No 
data are available regarding the GI tolerability of the crushed FCT formulation, particularly used in the 
youngest population.  The MAH shall conduct an observational cohort study in paediatric non-
transfusion-dependent thalassaemia patients over 10 years old for whom deferoxamine is 
contraindicated or inadequate, in order to assess the long-term exposure and safety of deferasirox 
dispersible and film-coated tablets, based on a protocol agreed with the CHMP (see Annex II, RMP).

Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The efficacy and safety of the new formulation should be in line with the data available for the 
currently approved dispersible tablets. 
The film coated tablets provide additional convenience to the patient in terms of mode of 
administration. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of the FCT is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The application cross-refers to the existing efficacy and safety data on the basis of adequate 
pharmacological data. The dose adjusted formulations are pharmacologically comparable and have the 
advantage of slightly improved pharmacokinetic properties (a reduced food effect and a more 
predictable dose-exposure relationship in clinical practice) and a more convenient mode of 
administration – especially for young children - as FCT would allow patients who have difficulty in 
swallowing whole tablets, to take crushed tablets with soft food such as apple sauce and yogurt.  
Thus, the new FCT formulation could represent an improvement in patient care and support 
compliance. However, in healthy volunteers, gastrointestinal disorders, such as dyspepsia and 
diarrhoea were observed, therefore no clinical advantage for the new formulation in terms of better 
gastrointestinal tolerability can be drawn at this stage. Data related to the tolerance profile of FCT will 
be documented in post approval studies as agreed in the Annex II.  
The MAH has included Post-authorisation measures in the Annex II and the RMP (as amendment 
version 3.0 of the PASS study CICL670E2422 following approval of deferasirox FCT, to allow enrolment 
of patients prescribed film-coated tablets and also a new PASS study to conduct an open-label, single-
arm, interventional study in 40 paediatric patients (2-<12 years old) with chronic or transfusional iron 
overload to assess the safety of deferasirox FCT over 6 months of treatment, especially when the 
tablets are crushed), which is acceptable.  
In order to prevent the risk of medication errors by switching formulations, risk minimization measures 
have also been included (as educational material for patients and prescribers for both formulations for 
all indications, introductory notification letters for the pharmacists and the prescribers) as requested by 
the CHMP which is acceptable.  
In addition, prescribers’ survey required as additional pharmacovigilance activity in order to measure 
effectiveness of risk minimisation measures has been included. The MAH should submit revised mock-
ups for the film-coated tablets, further enhancing the pharmaceutical form and strength in all panels of 
the unit pack of FCT before the launch of the FCT in order to avoid confusion between the two forms. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance of the FCT is positive as it is in line with the Benefit /Risk of the currently 
approved dispersible tablet.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of EXJADE 90 mg, 180 mg and 360 mg film-coated tablets in  
the treatment of chronic iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed 
red blood cells) in patients with beta thalassaemia major aged 6 years and older; the treatment of 
chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions when deferoxamine therapy is contraindicated or 
inadequate in the following patient groups: in patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload 
due to frequent blood transfusions (≥7 ml/kg/month of packed red blood cells) aged 2 to 5 years; in 
patients with beta thalassaemia major with iron overload due to infrequent blood transfusions (<7

•  Medication errors due to switching between formulations (dispersible and film-coated tablets). 
The MAH shall ensure that, at launch, in each Member State where EXJADE is marketed, all healthcare 
professionals and patients who are expected to prescribe, dispense and use EXJADE are provided with 
the following educational package for both formulations and on all indications: 
o 
o 
Physician educational material  
Patient information pack  
Additional periodic distributions after launch should be performed, notably after safety substantial 
product information modifications justifying educational material updates. 
The MAH shall use distinct outer cartons, blisters and tablets for both formulations (dispersible and 
film-coated tablet). 
The physician educational material should contain:  
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
•  Guide for healthcare professionals 
The Guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
• 
• 
• 
Description of available deferasirox formulations 
o  Different posology regimen 
o  Different conditions of administration 
o  Dose conversion table when switching from one formulation to another 
The recommended doses and the rules for starting treatment 
The need to monitor serum ferritin monthly

• 
That deferasirox causes rises in serum creatinine in some patients  
o  The need to monitor serum creatinine  
•  On two occasions prior to initiation of treatment  
•  Every week during the first month of initiation of treatment or after therapy 
modification  
•  Monthly thereafter  
o  The need to reduce by 10 mg/kg the dose if serum creatinine rises:  
•  Adults: >33% above baseline and creatinine clearance <LLN (90 ml/min)  
•  Paediatrics: either >ULN or creatinine clearance falls to <LLN at two 
consecutive visits.  
o  The need to interrupt treatment after a dose reduction if serum creatinine rises:  
•  Adults and Paediatrics: remain >33% above baseline or creatinine clearance 
<LLN (90 ml/min)  
o  The need to consider renal biopsy:  
•  When serum creatinine is elevated and if another abnormality has been 
detected (eg. proteinuria, signs of Fanconi’s Syndrome).  
• 
• 
•

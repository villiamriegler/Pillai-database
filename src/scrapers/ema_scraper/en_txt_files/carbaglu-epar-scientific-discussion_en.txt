SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  for  the  approval  of  Carbaglu.  For 
information on changes after approval please refer to module 8. 
1. 
Introduction 
Carbaglu  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  hyperammonaemia  associated  with  N-acetylglutamate 
synthase deficiency. It is presented as a dispersible tablet containing 200 mg of carglumic acid  
(N-carbamoyl-L-glutamic acid, NCGA). 
N-acetylglutamate  synthase  (NAGS)  deficiency  is  a  very  rare  inborn  error  of  metabolism.  Over  the 
last  20  years,  between  1980  and  2001,  42  patients  from  28  families  have  been  identified  by  the 
applicant  of  whom  34  were  diagnosed  as  NAGS  deficiency  and  8  siblings  who  had  died  without 
precise  diagnosis.  NAGS  deficiency,  which  is  the  rarest  congenital  urea  cycle  disorder,  results  in  a 
severe  defect  of  ammonia  detoxification  with  a  rapid  lethal  course  in  most  cases.  The  estimated 
prevalence of NAGS deficiency is 0.00125 per 10,000 persons in the European Union. Carbaglu was 
therefore designated as an orphan medicinal product in the treatment of this condition. 
Urea  cycle  is  the  unique  elimination  pathway  of  ammonium.  In  the  normal  mitochondrion,  N-
acetylglutamate (NAG) is the necessary allosteric activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS), 
which is the enzyme giving rise to the first substrate of the urea cycle, i.e., carbamoyl phosphate. NAG 
is produced by the NAG synthase (NAGS) from acetyl CoA and glutamate in the mitochondrion. In 
NAGS deficiency, the production of NAG is impaired.  
NAGS deficiency leads to various neurological and gastrointestinal (including hepatic) symptoms. Its 
severity depends on the degree of enzymatic deficiency: 
• 
The neonatal-onset presentation (about 60 %), which corresponds to the most severe enzyme 
deficiency, is usually fatal. Clinical symptoms are quite uniform: after a symptom-free interval 
of one to five days, poor sucking, vomiting, progressive lethargy, muscular hypotonia, 
hypothermia, polypnoea inducing a respiratory alkalosis are observed. Without rapid 
intervention, the neurologic deterioration is rapidly fatal resulting from coma with convulsions 
and apnoea. 
The late-onset presentation may manifest at any time in life, from early childhood to adulthood. 
The clinical expression and outcome are very variable, with either acute decompensation 
episodes or chronic manifestations with digestive, neurologic, or psychiatric symptoms.  
• 
The prognosis of NAGS deficiency has not been firmly established because of its very low prevalence, 
however,  as  in  any  other  urea  cycle  disorder,  the  aim  of  long-term  therapy  has  been  to  maintain 
metabolic  control  with  normal  plasma  ammonia  and  glutamine  concentrations.  The  clinical  relevant 
outcome is to prevent cumulative morbidity and mortality. 
There  are  currently  no  authorised  medicinal  products  in  this  indication.  As  clearly  established  in  all 
published papers, the alternative non specific waste-nitrogen vehicles and dietary restrictions are not 
satisfactory  since  chronic  hyperammonaemia  and  decompensations  cannot  be  controlled  by  these 
means only.  
The rationale to develop Carbaglu is that NCGA, which is an aminoacid analogue of NAG, although 
being in vitro a weaker activator of CPS than the naturally occurring activator NAG, was shown in 
vivo to reach the mitochondrion more easily than NAG.

Active substance 
The chemical name of carglumic acid is N – carbamoyl- L-glutamic acid or (2S)-2-(carbamoylamino) 
pentanedioic acid. The active substance has one chiral carbon atom and has an optical isomer, which is 
N-carbamoyl-D-glutamic acid. 
Carglumic acid is a white crystalline powder, soluble in boiling water, slightly soluble in cold water 
and practically insoluble in organic solvents. The pH of a 0.5% aqueous solution is between 2.2 and 
3.2. Carglumic acid presents three pKa values, 2.50, 3.55 and 8.60, ascribed to the two carboxylic acid 
groups and to the carbamoyl group, respectively. The isoelectric point of the active substance is 3.02. 
Although particle size is not considered to be critical from the point of view of bioavailability in this 
case,  the  results  of  a  particle  size  analysis  carried  out  on  six  industrial  batches  of  ground  powder 
demonstrated a reproducible particle size around 200 µm with a relative standard deviation of less than 
10%.  The  laser  beam  particle  size  analyses  are  presented  for  the  6  batches  and  the  particle  size 
distribution profiles are reproducible. 
Carglumic  acid  is  synthesised  by  reaction  of  L-glutamic  acid  and  potassium  cyanate  in  an  aqueous 
media  in  a  single  step,  followed  by  neutralisation  with  hydrochloric  acid  and  purification  by 
recrystallisations  in  water.  No  organic  solvents  or  metal  catalysts  are  used  during  the  synthetic 
procedure. 
The potential impurities originating from the route of synthesis as well as from the degradation of the 
active substance are hydantoin-5-propionic acid and diaza-1,3-dione-2,4-carboxy-7-cycloheptane. The 
optical  isomer  of  the  active  substance,  N-carbamoyl-D-glutamic  acid  might  also  be  present.  No 
residuals of the starting materials, L- glutamic acid and potassium cyanate, were detected in carglumic 
acid. Residual levels of cyanide ions possibly originating from potassium cyanate were also tested and 
not  detected.  Other  unidentified  substances  appear  only  under  stress  conditions  to  which  the  active 
substance or the finished product is never subject.  
Specifications for the active substance 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  description,  identification  (IR,  HPLC),  assay 
(HPLC),  related  impurities  (HPLC),  specific  optical  rotation  (Ph.  Eur),  melting  point  (Ph.  Eur),  pH 
(Ph. Eur), loss on drying (Ph. Eur), suphated ash (Ph. Eur), and heavy metals (Ph. Eur). 
The analytical methods used in routine controls were adequately validated and thus considered 
suitable. The production yield and the particle size of the active substance are also reproducible. 
All impurity limits were justified by toxicological considerations. 
However the chiral purity of the active substance should be more accurately addressed and as a follow 
up measure, the applicant committed to develop and validate a chiral HPLC analytical method for the 
specific  determination  of  N-carbamoyl-D-glutamic  acid,  then  to  retest  a  large  number  of  carglumic 
acid batches. Further to its validation, the chiral HPLC will be included in the routine testing of the 
active  substance  if  the  retrospective  enantiomeric  purity  data  collection  demonstrates  its  relevance. 
Moreover, in accordance with the ICH Q3A guideline, specific qualification studies will be carried out 
if  appropriate  data  are  unavailable  to  qualify  the  proposed  acceptance  criterion  for  N-carbamoyl-D-
glutamic acid.

The analysis results from three batches presented by the applicant support the proposed specifications 
for the active substance. 
Stability 
A  stability  study  has  been  carried  out  under  stress  conditions.  The  results  reveal  that  the  major 
degradation product after storage at high temperatures as well as after dispersion in acid solution, and 
to  a  lesser  extent,  after  dispersion  in  H2O2  solution  and  exposure  to  light  is  hydantoin-5-propionic 
acid. Diaza-1,3-dione-2,4-carboxy-7-cycloheptane is also formed, but in smaller amounts. In contrast, 
carglumic acid appears to be very stable in pH alkaline solution. The company committed to address 
as a follow up measure the chiral purity of the active substance under stress conditions once the HPLC 
chiral purity method is validated.  
Stability  data  from  three  production  batches  of  the  active  substance  packed  in  their  final  containers 
were  also  presented.  The  studies  were  carried  out  in  compliance  with  ICH  guidelines,  under 
accelerated conditions at 40°C/75% RH and under real-time conditions at 25°C/60% RH. The analysis 
results obtained from the batches stored at 40°C/75% RH over a 6-month period and at 25°C/60% RH 
over a 36-month period, remained within the defined specifications.  
Considering the stability data, the requested retest period of three years for the active substance when 
stored in its original packaging was approved. 
Other ingredients 
All  excipients  in  the  tablets  are  tested  to,  and  comply  with,  Ph.  Eur.  requirements.  None  of  the 
ingredients are of animal origin. 
Two different sizes of tablet containers are proposed to allow the distribution of the medicinal product 
either in a 60-tablet container (suitable for a maintenance therapy), or in a 15-tablet container (suitable 
to treatment initiation). The containers are made of polypropylene containing a white opacifying agent 
(mixture of polypropylene and titanium dioxide).  
Polyethylene  stoppers  containing  a  white  colouring  agent  are  used.  Stoppers  are  provided  with  a 
desiccant  (white  silica  gel)  to  prevent  humidity  problems  due  to  the  high  amounts  of  disintegrating 
agent used in the formulation. As a supplementary precaution, the stoppers are of the tamper-resistant 
type. 
Product development and finished product 
The tablets have been formulated so as to obtain an easily water dispersible form with rapid in vitro 
dissolution profile. Because the dose shall be adapted to individual requirements scored tablets have 
been chosen as they provide dose regimen flexibility through the breaking of the tablets into halves or 
quarters.  
Given the low wettability of carglumic acid, a wetting agent, sodium laurilsulfate, was incorporated in 
the  granulating  step  so  as  to  enable  a  rapid  dissolution  profile  of  the  tablets.  The  initial  amount  of 
sodium  laurilsulfate  used  for  the  preparation  of  the  clinical  formula  was  reduced  in  the  final 
formulation, since it was suspected to be the cause of a few episodes of mild to moderate diarrhoea, 
which occurred during a pharmacokinetic study.  
The  method  of  manufacture  is  a  conventional  high  shear  wet  granulation  and  oven  drying  process, 
followed  by  compression.  The  choice  of  the  excipients,  their  function  and  quantity  has  been 
sufficiently justified. Process parameters for mixing, drying and granule sizing are given. Equipment 
types  are  described  and  in  process  controls  are  stated.  Validation  was  performed  on  four  industrial 
batches. The granulation step is properly validated. Homogeneity during final mixing and compression 
has also been established. 
The  analytical  results  of  three  pilot  batches  and  of  four  industrial  validation  batches  have  been 
submitted. All batches were compliant with the release specifications (appearance, uniformity of mass, 
disintegration time, fineness of dispersion, dissolution (≥ 75% in 15 minutes), identification (HPLC), 
assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC) and microbiological purity).

Since tablets present three scores in order to enable breaking for dose adjustment, breakability studies 
were  performed  on  quarter  and  half  tablets.  The  resistance  to  crushing  as  well  as  changes  to  the 
resistance to crushing over time during storage of the tablet containers for six  months at 40oC /75% 
RH were also studied revealing no  modification of  average hardness for  both  tablet ends and centre 
ends  quarters.  The  results  of  the  content  uniformity  for  halves  conformed  to  the  specifications.  The 
breakability tests showed that the uniformity of mass results for half-tablets strictly complied with the 
Ph.  Eur.  requirements  for  single-dose  preparations  whereas  the  results  for  quarter-tablets  did  not. 
However, no safety concerns should be raised, because the key element in the treatment of NAGS is 
the total daily dose of carglumic acid. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of the product allow some 
flexibility with regard to the frequency of administration. The quarter tablets are only used to facilitate 
the daily division of the doses when this is required, without jeopardising the treatment. 
The  results of a comparative pharmacokinetic study between the  dispersible tablet and the reference 
oral powder forms ensure that no bioavailability problems are expected due to substance properties or 
biopharmaceutics factors under present manufacture conditions. No significant differences were found 
between  the  developed  formulation  and  the  reference  powder.  However  this  initial  formulation  has 
been modified to respond to a safety concern, giving rise to a compromise on the amount of sodium 
laurilsulfate. Dissolution studies support this change.  
In process controls performed at each manufacturing step are stated with their acceptance limits. They 
include  the  verification  of  the  mixing  duration  and  speed,  determination  of  the  granules  residual 
humidity  and  determination  of  the  tablets  weight  uniformity,  hardness  (110-150N)  and  friability 
(<0.1%). 
Stability of the product  
Initial stability studies were conducted using three batches, which however respond to a formulation 
that  was  rejected  due  to  excessive  amount  of  sodium  laurilsulfate.  The  medicinal  product  was  then 
reformulated  and  additional  stability  studies  were  carried  out  with  another  series  of  3  batches 
corresponding to the final formula. 
All  stability  studies  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  ICH  requirements.  The  batches  have  been 
tested for all parameters included in the specifications with the addition of tablets hardness (no limit 
stated), friability (<1.0%) and water content (no limit stated). 
During  these  studies,  whatever  the  storage  conditions,  all  parameters  remained  within 
specifications with the exception of impurities content which is time and temperature dependant. 
As suggested by  the results obtained  with all batches, the  proposed  shelf life for  the unopened 
commercially  packaged  product  under  the  conditions  specified  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics, is acceptable. 
The  results  from  a  complementary  stability  study  also  support  the  recommended  shelf  life  of  the 
product  after  first  opening  of  the  tablet  container  mentioned  in  the  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics. 
The preliminary results of the ongoing stability studies carried out with three full scale production 
batches confirm the stability profile of the finished product.

Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of Carbaglu is based on the structural similarity of NCGA to NAG, and its 
ability  to  replace  NAG  for  the  activation  of  CPS  in  patients  where  NAG  is  lacking  due  to  the 
deficiency of the enzyme responsible for its synthesis (NAGS).  
Published literature on in vitro and in vivo studies has been submitted to evaluate the pharmacological 
profile of NCGA in relation to the claimed indication. Only one in vitro study was conducted by the 
applicant  to  confirm  the  ability  of  NCGA  synthetised  by  the  manufacturer  of  the  active  substance, 
Laboratoire Synth-Innove, to activate the target mitochondrial enzyme CPS.  
• 
In vitro studies 
NCGA was shown to be weaker activator of CPS than NAG, but in vivo it was more efficient. Rubio 
and Grisolia (1) have found that, after injection into mice, radiolabelled NAG could not be detected in 
the  liver  mitochondria,  as  opposed  to  NCGA.  The  reason  has  not  been  clarified,  but  Kim  et  al.  (2) 
suggested that it might be related primarily to the higher resistance of NCGA to hydrolysis by cytosol 
aminoacylase and Meijer et al. (3) suggested that it might also be related to a higher permeability of 
the mitochondria to NCGA. 
• 
In vivo studies 
With  regard  to  the  clinical  efficacy  of  NCGA  in  the  treatment  of  hyperammonaemia,  the 
evidence  is  based  on  the  treatment  of  normal  or  partially  hepatectomised  rats  receiving 
potentially lethal doses of ammonium since there is no animal model of NAGS deficiency. The 
results of two published studies were particularly highlighted. 
• 
• 
In rats treated with 1 or 4 mmol/kg of NCGA administered intraperitonally, Kim et al. (2) have 
found  a  protection  of  61%  or  71%  respectively  against  the  hyperammonaemia  after  an 
intravenous administration of a lethal dose of ammonium acetate (10.8 mmol/kg).  
Lee  et  al.  (4)  performed  the  same  type  of  experiment  in  70%  partially  hepatectomised  rats 
injected with ammonium acetate (3.4 mmol/kg). After NCGA administration (1 mmol/kg) there 
was a decrease in ammonia levels to 278.09 ± 60.02 µmol/l (p < 0.05) when comparing to the 
control group (415.72 ± 166.38). The correlation between blood ammonia level and behavioural 
abnormalities  observed  in  hepatic  encephalopathy  was  also  investigated.  Concerning  the 
behavioural  grading  scores,  the  results  after  NCGA  alone  were  1.09  ±  0.30  (p  <  0.01)  when 
comparing  to  the  control  group  (2.54  ±  1.36).  Thus  the  protective  effect  on  the  behavioural 
change significantly correlated with their effects on blood ammonia level. 
In both studies, a group of animals received NCGA combined with arginine. Results in these groups 
showed  that  arginine  increased  the  protective  effect  of  NCGA  against  ammonia  intoxication.  It  was 
suggested that this potentialisation  by arginine  might be due to an increase in the synthesis of NAG 
which  is  the  natural  activator  of  CPS,  and  might  therefore  be  dependent  on  the  level  of  NAGS 
deficiency.  However  in  the  clinical  situation,  similar  results  were  not  achieved.  Therefore  the 
concomitant use of arginine cannot be systematically recommended. 
Overall  these  findings  provide  a  sound  rational  basis  for  the  use  of  NCGA  in  the  prevention  of 
hyperammonaemia in clinical conditions.

General and safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies evaluated the effects of NCGA on the behaviour, body temperature, and 
respiratory parameters in rats and on the cardiovascular system in dogs. These studies did not reveal 
any relevant effects following single dose administration up to 1000 mg/kg of NCGA in both species. 
In addition in vitro studies (Purkinje fibers) did not show any cardiovascular effects of NCGA. Since 
cardiac effects were neither observed in vitro nor in vivo, it was considered acceptable not to conduct 
further investigation on HERG channels. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  pharmacodynamic  interaction  studies  have  been  carried  out,  however  since  the  occurrence  of 
interactions is very unlikely this omission was considered acceptable.

Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  profile  of  NCGA  was  determined  based  on  the  results  from  one  study 
conducted  in  rats  after  single  oral  administration  and  one  in  vitro  study  using  human  and  rats 
hepatocytes.  Both  studies  were  performed  with  radiolabelled  NCGA.  In  addition,  toxicokinetic  data 
obtained  from  the  6-month  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  rats  as  well  as  data  from  the  safety 
pharmacology study in dogs were provided. 
NCGA was measured in plasma and urine samples using a validated LC/MS-MS method, with a high 
level of sensitivity and specificity. 
Absorption and distribution 
NCGA  was  rapidly  absorbed  in  rats  following  single  oral  administration  (500  mg/kg  radiolabelled 
NCGA), with a maximum radioactivity level of 62.6 µgEq/g reached in plasma collected 3 hours post 
dose. 
Toxicokinetic  data  generated  in  rats  showed  consistent  results.  Tmax  was  obtained  between  2  and 
4 hours post-dosing and Cmax values were very high after NCGA administration (about 70 µg/ml in 
rats  given  500  mg/kg).  In  dogs,  high  plasma  concentrations  (ranging  74  –  277  µg/ml)  were  also 
achieved  2  hours  post-dose  (1,000 mg/kg).  The  exposure  in  male  dogs  appeared  consistently  lower 
than the exposure in females (85.1±10.0 µg/ml versus 202±65.8 µg/ml); however there are insufficient 
data to explain these gender differences. 
Distribution  of  NCGA  in  rats  after  a  single  oral  dose  of  500  mg/kg  was  extensive  with  highest 
amounts  found  in  the  kidney,  the  liver  (target  organ)  and  the  small  intestine  mucosa.  The  likely 
concentration of NCGA in the cells of the intestinal mucosa could be explained in relation to its in situ 
activity.  
Metabolism and elimination 
No  metabolites  of  NCGA  were  detected  in  vitro  in  rat  hepatocyte  cultures.  These  results  were 
confirmed  during  the  in vivo  study  in  the  rat  and  similar  results  were  obtained  in  vitro  when  using 
human hepatocytes.

NCGA is eliminated mainly in urine (50%) and in faeces (about 40%) as unchanged compound in rats. 
Although  no  metabolite  was  detected,  a  small  percentage  of  the  total  radioactivity  was  found  to  be 
eliminated  as  expired  CO2  (about  9 %,  72  hours  post-dose).  Several  hypotheses  for  CO2  formation 
pathways  were  formulated,  such  as  decarboxylation  of  the  compound,  but  none  of  them  has  been 
experimentally confirmed. The elimination is biphasic with a first rapid elimination phase where about 
70% of the dose is eliminated during the first 12 hours. The total excretion in rats accounts for about 
97%  of  the  administered  dose  after  96  hours.  Toxicokinetic  data  showed  that  T1/2  is  about  3  to  3.5 
hours whatever the administered dose in rats. 
Toxicology 
The toxicology profile of NCGA was evaluated in a limited toxicological programme of studies due to 
the lack of large availability of product with the desired impurity profile. The species used was the rat, 
which was considered relevant due its ureotelic profile similar to humans. The programme consisted 
of the following tests: 
• 
• 
• 
Single dose toxicity studies in rats using oral and intravenous route 
Repeated dose toxicity studies in newborn rats and in young adult rats as NCGA is intended to 
be administered in young patients 
Complete battery of mutagenicity tests 
All the studies were compliant with Good Laboratory Practices. 
Single dose toxicity 
• 
NCGA  did  not  cause  any  toxicity  in  rats  following  single  doses  up  to  2806 mg/kg  orally  and  
238.6 mg/kg intravenously (highest dose level achievable for intravenous administration). 
Repeated dose toxicity 
• 
A  2-week  study  was  performed  in  newborn  rats  aged  day  4  to  21  post-partum,  which  received  oral 
doses of 250 – 500 – 1000 and 2000 mg/kg/day of NCGA. No signs of toxicity were noted at  
500  mg/kg/day.  At  1000 mg/kg/day,  only  a  slight  reduction  of  body  weight  gain  was  observed,  but 
there  were  no  clinical  signs  of  toxicity,  a  normal  physical  and  reflex  development,  unaffected 
haematological and blood biochemical parameters. After administration of 2000 mg/kg, clinical signs 
of  ill  health  (coldness  to  touch,  pallor  of  extremities,  emaciation  and  an  immediate  marked  loss  of 
weight gain) were observed prior to premature death. This study demonstrated the good tolerance in 
newborn animals at a high level of concentration and exposure, as well as the absence of effects on the 
newborn’s development. 
A  6-month  study  was  carried  out  in  rats  aged  4  weeks  who  received  oral  doses  of  NCGA  (500  or 
1000 mg/kg/day). No treatment related death or signs of systemic toxicity were observed at the dose of 
1000  mg/kg/day.  The  only  clinical  sign  described  was  ptyalism  that  was  observed  in  almost  all 
animals.  Neither  the  histopathological  examination  of  the  organs  and  tissues  nor  the  laboratory 
investigation (haematology and urine) revealed consistent changes versus controls. 
There was no evidence of immunotoxicity or cell proliferation. From the lack of toxicity in the study, 
the NOEL was considered to be the 500 mg/kg/day dose level and the NOAEL was considered to be 
the  1000  mg/kg/day  dose  level  (based  on  the  occurrence  of  ptyalism).  The  safety  margin  was 
estimated to be more than 20, based on Cmax, which appeared acceptable. 
No study was performed in a non-rodent species due to the lack of test product available. However, 
the  long  experience  of  the  use  of  NCGA  in  humans  allows  to  conclude  than  there  is  no  risk  for  a 
chronic administration. 
Genotoxicity 
• 
The mutagenic potential of NCGA was evaluated in a battery of tests using batches of two different 
impurity profiles (batch containing impurity hydantoin-5-propionic acid (HPA) at a level of 0.3 % and 
batches containing HPA at a maximum level of 0.1 %, corresponding to the quality which is defined 
7/19 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for  Carbaglu).  NCGA  was  devoid  of  mutagenic  potential  in  bacteria  whatever  the  batch  used.  The 
clastogenic activity shown in an in vitro study in human lymphocytes was clearly demonstrated as an 
artefact due to the acidification of the culture medium. Although a micronucleus test performed in the 
rat at an excessive dose level (7040 mg/kg, using batch containing 0.3 % of HPA) was found weakly 
positive,  this  effect  was  neither  confirmed  in  another  study  conducted  at  the  same  dose  level  in  the 
same species (using batches of the 2 different purity profiles), nor in an additional micronucleus test 
after  chronic  treatment  of  rats  for  1  month  with  doses  up  to  1000  mg/kg/day.  It  can  be  concluded 
therefore that NCGA is devoid of genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
• 
The carcinogenic potential of NCGA has not been evaluated. However, based on the lack of structural 
analogy  of  NCGA  with  known  carcinogens,  the  absence  of  immunotoxicity,  genotoxic  and 
immunodepressive  properties  as  demonstrated  respectively  in  a  battery  of  mutagenicity  tests  and  in 
rats  treated  for  6  months,  as  well  as  the  absence  of  cell  proliferation  or  signs  of  hyperplasia  in  the 
tissues and organs of rats after chronic administration, NCGA does not present any carcinogenic risk 
for patients who will be treated for an important part of their life. 
Reproduction toxicity studies 
• 
At  present,  the  reproduction  studies  have  not  been  completed.  However,  a  specific  study  associated 
with the 6-month study in rats allowed to conclude that NCGA did not affect male and female fertility 
in  relation  to  mating  behaviour,  seminology,  fertility  index  and  oestrous  cycle.  Preliminary  results 
from  an  embryo-foetal  toxicity  study  in  rats  showed  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  embryotoxicity, 
foetotoxicity or teratogenicity at any of the dose levels tested (500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 mg/kg/day 
NCGA). Only slight maternotoxicity was recorded with the highest dose. The applicant committed to 
submit the results of the additional embryo-foetal and peri/post natal studies in rats and rabbits post-
authorisation. In view of the preliminary data in animals and absence of data in humans, the potential 
risk  for  humans  is  unknown.  Carbaglu  should  therefore  not  be  used  during  pregnancy  and  lactation 
unless clearly necessary, as recommended in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Impurities 
• 
Hydantoin-5-propionic acid (HPA), which is a major impurity of the technical grade product is limited 
in  the  formulation  intended  to  be  marketed  to  less  than  0.1%.  It  was  demonstrated  that  it  is  a 
physiological  metabolite of histidine  and that the  quantities  brought by  the  treatment with  a  product 
containing 
the  quantities  produced 
physiologically  by  histidine  metabolism.  The  limit  has  therefore  been  toxicologically  qualified.  The 
limit  of  20  ppm  of  cyanates,  as  potential  impurity  in  NCGA  batches,  has  also  been  toxicologically 
qualified. 
than  0.1%  HPA  are  approximately  equivalent 
less 
to 
Ecotoxicity/Environmental risk assessment 
• 
An assessment of the risk was performed and no significant risk to the environment related to the use 
of NCGA is anticipated.

Part IV: Clinical aspects 
The  clinical  development  included  one  pharmacokinetic  study  carried  out  in  12  adult  male  subjects, 
one  in  vitro  metabolic  study  in  human  hepatocytes  and  a  retrospective  patient  data  collection 
organised  by  the  applicant,  which  included  20  patients  that  received  chronic  treatment  with  NCGA 
from Orphan Europe starting before 2001. Out of the 20 patients, 12 children born between 1984 and 
2000 were treated for a NAGS deficiency to support the claim for the indication. Supportive data from 
publications relating to 4 patients were also provided.  
Clinical pharmacology 
NCGA is a structural analogue of NAG and has been shown in vitro to activate liver CPS as already 
presented in part 3.3 of this document ‘Pharmaco-toxicological aspects’. 
8/19 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The principal pharmacological effect of NCGA is the reduction of abnormal amnonia levels and thus it 
cannot  be  tested  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  data  that  can  account  for  the  pharmacological  effect  of 
NCGA originate therefore from the preclinical studies and the clinical efficacy data. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics profile of NCGA was determined in two studies: 
• 
A  pharmacokinetic  study  in  12  healthy  male  adult  volunteers  who  received  a  single  oral 
administration  of  100  mg/kg  NCGA.  This  study  was  also  performed  to  compare  the  non 
formulated pure powder that had been used in patients for years with the new dispersible tablet 
containing 200 mg NCGA, both products being ingested as a suspension. The reference powder 
and  the  tested  tablet  were  bioequivalent.  Although  the  formulation  intended  for  marketing 
contains  a  lower  amount  of  the  excipient  sodium  laurilsulfate  than  the  tablets  used  in  the 
bioequivalence  study  (0.5 mg  versus  2  mg),  no  additional  bioequivalence  study  was  felt 
necessary.  Indeed,  as  2  mg  sodium  laurilsulfate-containing  tablets  were  found  bioequivalent 
with the carglumic acid powder, there is no reason to believe the 0.5 mg sodium laurilsulfate-
containing tablets would behave differently. 
A  specific  and  highly  sensitive  assay  method  was  developed  and  validated  for  NCGA 
determination  using  high  pressure  liquid  chromatography  coupled  with  tandem  mass 
spectrometry. 
• 
An in vitro metabolic study in human hepatocytes using 14C labelled NCGA 
Absorption and distribution 
Following  single  oral  dose  administration,  NCGA  peaks  in  plasma  after  few  hours:  median  3  hours 
(range 2 – 4), with a concentration reaching a median of 2.6 µg/ml (range 1.8 – 4.8). 
The apparent volume of distribution is very high: 2657 l (range 1616 – 5797).  
There is no data on the oral bioavailability but it is expected to be low considering the high apparent 
volume of distribution and the apparent total clearance: median 5.7 l/min (range 3.0 – 9.7). 
The inter-subject variability was moderate (around 30 %). 
The linearity of the pharmacokinetics of NCGA has not been evaluated. 
Metabolism and elimination 
The  elimination  profile  appears  bi-exponential  with  a  first  phase  of  rapid  elimination  followed  by  a 
second phase of slow elimination starting about 12 hours after the administration. Since there was no 
sampling time point between 12 and 24 hours (last sample) it was not possible to calculate the half-life 
of  the  second  phase.  In  all  subjects  except  one,  NCGA  was  still  detectable  (above  the  limit  of 
quantitation) at 24 hours but the levels were low as compared to the maximum concentrations (around 
5%). Around 5 % of the dose (3.5 - 7.5) is recovered unchanged in urine within 24 hours. The fate of 
95 % of the administered dose of NCAG is unknown. As for the in vitro study using rat hepatocytes 
no  metabolite  was  detected  using  human  hepatocytes.  The  value  of  the  renal  clearance,  290  ml/mn 
(204  -  445),  suggest  that  NCGA  is  probably  secreted  from  the  kidney.  The  applicant  committed  to 
perform a full ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination) study on 3 volunteers to 
gather  further  information  on  the  fate  of  carglumic  acid  in  humans,  the  results  of  which  will  be 
submitted post-authorisation.

EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Plasma levels of NCGA were measured in children (2 days old to 10 years old) and 1 adolescent 
(13 years old), treated with a daily dose ranging from 7.4 to 122.4 mg/kg/day. Their range were 
consistent  with  those  measured  in  healthy  volunteers.  The  rather  slow  decrease  in  plasma 
concentrations over 15 hours suggests that a twice daily administration could be sufficient. Most 
young patients were treated between 2 and 4 times daily before meals or feedings. The applicant 
committed  to  gather  further  data  in  treated  children  to  better  define  the  pharmacokinetic 
profile of NCGA in patients. 
Interaction studies 
No  interaction  studies  have  been  conducted.  In  the  clinical  experience,  NACG  has  been  used  in 
association with a number of other products, but due to the very low number of patients no conclusion 
could be drawn on the potential interaction. 
Clinical efficacy  
The data presented to support the efficacy of NCGA in NAGS deficiency consisted of: 
• 
• 
  a retrospective series of  20 patients (plus an update on 2 cases that started treatment in 2001) 
evaluable  for  safety  –  (not  all  have  NAGS  deficiency)  of  which  12  are  evaluable  for  efficacy 
that received  chronic treatment  with  NCGA (the 2  new cases are  also confirmed  or suspected 
NAGS deficient patients). The  other  8  patients were treated for hyperammonaemia  of  another 
cause (5 cases with other urea cycle disorders due to defects in other enzymes associated with 
the  urea  cycle,  including  3  carbamoylphosphate  synthetase  and  2  ornithine  transcarbamoylase 
defects, and 3 cases of fatty acid oxidation disorder). 
  Supportive data were submitted consisting of published data relating to 4 patients, including the 
first  patient  who  was  treated  from  1980  until  his  death  in  1990  with  the  product  supplied  by 
another  pharmaceutical  manufacturer  before  its  distribution  by  Orphan  Europe  and  three 
patients treated with a chemical grade product. 
As  the  very  first  patient  diagnosed  as  NAGS  deficient,  published  in  1981,  was  treated  with  NCGA, 
there are no true historical controls with which to compare the efficacy. 
Retrospective data collection 
The 20 patients included in the initial retrospective data collection have been treated by 10 physicians 
in 5 countries (France, Germany, Austria, The Netherlands and Spain).  
Population 
• 
• 
The 12 patients evaluable for efficacy were 8 boys and 4 girls, born between 1984 and 2000 but all 
diagnosed after 1991: 
• 
they  had  a  sibling  who  died  from 
6  patients  were  prospectively 
treated  because 
hyperammonaemia (including 3 siblings in one family and 2 siblings in another family),  
3 patients had a neonatal presentation with clinical manifestations starting within the first 3 days 
of  life  but  of  various  severity:  persistent  vomiting  (1),  neonatal  hyperammonaemic  coma  (1), 
neurological manifestations (1); 
3 patients had delayed onset presentation and late diagnoses at 13 years (recurrent episodes of 
vomiting with behavioural disorders and impaired consciousness but with a first similar episode 
at  the  age  of  13  months),  4.5  years  ("Reye-like"  syndrome  after  a  few  months  therapy  with 
sodium  valproate  but  with  neurological  manifestations  since  the  age  of  2.7  years),  12  years 
(recurrent  episodes  of  vomiting  with  impaired  consciousness  but  with  a  few  behavioural 
manifestations since the age of 9 years), respectively.

The seriousness of the disease was classified according to that used in other urea cycle disorders, i.e. 
neonatal  and  late-onset  presentations,  since  the  enzymatic  activity  measured  in  vitro  in  the  liver 
samples is too variable and unrelated with the clinical presentation to provide a reliable classification. 
The 12 patients corresponded to: 
- 
- 
Out  of  the  6  cases  that  were  presented  as  "prospectively  treated",  3  can  actually  be  considered  as  a 
neonatal presentation since hyperammonaemia could be detected during early monitoring. As for the 
last 3 cases (no 8, 15, 18), a definite classification was not possible since hyperammonaemia did not 
occur under prospective treatment initiated right after birth. 
a neonatal presentation in 6 cases (no 1, 2, 5, 6, 13, 20) 
a late-onset presentation in 3 cases (no 7, 9, 16).  
Diagnosis 
The diagnosis was confirmed in all cases by liver biopsy and NAGS activity assay, which was 
performed in the same laboratory.  
Endpoints and measurement of efficacy 
Data  on  plasma  ammonia,  plasma  amino  acids  including  glutamine,  physical  growth,  psychomotor 
development,  clinical  symptoms  of  acute  hyperammaemic  decompensation  and  survival  have  been 
recorded. 
To  reduce  ammonaemia  is  one  well-established  treatment  goal  in  urea  cycle  disorders,  and  therefore  if 
NCGA is able to reduce ammonaemia, it is likely to have a role in treatment of NAGS deficiency. As for 
plasma glutamine concentration, this parameter may also be useful for the long-term monitoring and should 
be kept in the normal range by the treatment. 
Dose and dosing regimen 
There was no dose ranging study. The doses used were thus empirical. The efficacy of the treatment 
with NCGA is always defined by fast normalization of plasma ammonia levels. The dose necessary to 
achieve this objective is highly dependent on the severity of the defect and on the protein load to the 
metabolic pathway, which are both individual characteristics of the patients. Therefore, the treatment 
should  start  with  a  high  dose,  in  order  to  achieve  the  most  rapid  effect,  and  this  dose  should 
subsequently be tailored for each patient according to the evolution of ammonaemia.  
The  doses  initially  used  to  start  therapy  (responsiveness  test)  were  high,  based  on  the  first 
publication (300 mg/kg/day) but there was subsequently a trend to decrease them (ranged from 
70 to 254 mg/kg/day). The objective of the test was to induce a decrease in plasma ammonium 
and/or glutamine, which is often elevated in case of nitrogen load. This occurred in most cases 
within 24 hours, but normalisation sometimes took a few days. 
This initial dose (per kg of body weight) was the maximum dose in all patients but one (no 8) whose 
dose was regularly increased during the first 4 months of therapy from 89 to 200 mg/kg/day without 
explanation of the treating physician. 
Overall, the maximum dose received by each patient in the course of the treatment ranged from 35 to 
254 mg/kg/day (median = 133 mg/kg/day). 
The  last  dose  (at  the  last  visit)  ranged  from  7  to  98  mg/kg/day  (median  =  52  mg/kg/day),  which 
represents an overall reduction of 60 %. 
The frequency of administration also tended to decrease with age, from 3 - 6 at the beginning of the 
treatment to 2 - 4 at the last visit. In the absence of pharmacokinetics data, the logical approach was 
initially to divide the total daily dose according to the number of feedings and administer these doses 
before the feedings, since ammonia levels are known to peak usually about 1 hour after meals. But for 
practical  reasons,  the  patients'  mothers  sometimes  started  to  decrease  the  number  of  daily  doses 
without any deleterious consequence. 
11/19 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The duration of treatment ranged at the cut-off date (July 31, 2001) from 9.8 to 0.7 years (median = 
3.1  years).  There  was  one  discontinuation  after  one  year  of  treatment  due  to  limited  efficacy.  The 
compliance with NCGA treatment was good.  
Concomitant therapy 
As opposed to other urea cycle disorders, concomitant treatment did not appear necessary. The 
classical  alternate  pathway  medications 
(sodium  benzoate  and  phenylbutyrate)  were 
progressively  withdrawn.  Seven  patients  received  arginine  but  this  prescription  seems  to  have 
been motivated by the experimental animal data and the publications on the first patient rather 
than by actually testing a potential additive effect on ammonia. The metabolic control in the five 
patients  who  did  not  receive  any  concomitant  therapy  did  not  differ  from  that  of  the  other 
patients  who  received  arginine.  An  exception  to  the  general  therapeutic  approach  should  be 
mentioned:  one  physician  prospectively  treated  3  siblings  with  a  combination  of  strict  protein 
restriction  (including  the  use  of  a  mixture  of  essential  amino  acids),  NCGA,  sodium 
phenylbutyrate,  arginine  and  carnitine  and  never  attempted  to  liberalise  the  diet  or  reduce 
sodium phenylbutyrate. 
As  for  the  diet,  it  was  free  or  normal  in  6  out  of  the  12  patients.  The  two  older  patients  had  a 
moderately  restricted  protein  intake.  Four  patients  had  a  restricted  protein  intake,  which  included  a 
mixture  of  essential  amino  acids:  the  3  siblings  already  described  and  one  patient  who  also  needed 
continuous enteral feeding. 
In the large majority of treated patients, carglumic acid was the sole long term therapy.

Overall, plasma ammonia levels were well controlled, in spite of all intercurrent events that happened 
over the years (infections, vaccinations, surgical operations). 
• 
In 5 patients, ammonaemia was always found normal. 
• 
In 3 patients, an abnormal value was measured on a single occasion: infection with high fever, 
very low NCGA dose (10 mg/kg/d), unknown cause in the last case. 
In 3 patients, there were transient fluctuations slightly above the upper normal value: only at the 
start of NCGA after a very fast reduction of the dose in the first patient; in 2 of the 3 siblings 
despite concomitant treatment. 
In  one  patient, fluctuating  ammonia levels  decreased from  120 -  160  µmol/l  before NCGA  to  
90 µmol/l but never normalised. 
• 
• 
In addition, in 6 of these patients, levels became normal in less than 24 hours. 
From the sparse data supplied by the applicant, there does not seem to be any relationship between the 
dose of NCGA administered and the decrease in blood ammonia levels. 
When plasma glutamine levels were elevated before NCGA therapy, sometimes even despite sodium 
benzoate  or  phenylbutyrate  treatment,  they  rapidly  normalised  after  NCGA  was  introduced  and 
remained continuously normal over the years. When plasma citrulline levels were low in a few cases 
they normalised as well. 
The  raise in  blood  urea seen in  4  patients who  had  initially  low  levels  may reflect a direct  effect  of 
NCGA on urea production or simply result from increased protein intake. 
Growth has been normal in all patients except one of the 3 siblings receiving drastic treatment. 
The boy's growth rate fell off during  his second  year of life and even his  ammonia levels were 
borderline. The decision was taken to increase the protein intake in order to keep up with the 
boy's increase in energy expenditure and the boy subsequently caught up and regained a normal 
growth pattern. 
The psychomotor development was normal with normal school attendance for age in 11 patients. Only 
the  patient  who  was  treated  for  1  year  (patient  no  9)  was  rated  as  mentally  retarded  already  before 
NCGA therapy.  
Out of the 12 patients with NAGS deficiency, no death was reported. The patient (no 9) who had his 
treatment discontinued after one year is still alive and treated with NCGA from another source. 
Finally,  none  of  the  patients  experienced  any  clinical  symptoms  of  acute  hyper-ammonaemic 
decompensation  except  for  one  patient.  This  was  due  to  an  accidental  interruption  of  drug  supply, 
which  allowed  to  show  the  prolonged  duration  of  action  of  NCGA  since  clinical  symptoms  of 
decompensation (poor appetite, vomiting, headache, somnolence, dizziness) were only manifest after 4 
days.  His  ammonia  level  was  measured  at  94  µmol/l  with  a  glutamine  level  at  1242  µmol/l  
(N  =  580  +/-  180  µmol/l);  the  ammonia  concentration  normalised  within  4  hours  after  re-starting 
NCGA therapy (128 mg/kg administered over 8 hours). 
Supportive data 
Besides  the  12  patients  that  constitute  the  core  series,  4  extra  cases  of  NAGS  deficiency  are  quoted 
from the literature:

To further substantiate the efficacy of NCGA for the treatment of hyperammonaemia associated with 
NAGS  deficiency,  the  applicant  supplemented  the  application  with  additional  analysis  to  establish 
how representative of the general population of NAGS deficiency patients these cases (12 + 4) are. For 
this  analysis,  the  applicant  compiled  the  data  available  from  the  retrospective  cases,  published 
literature and other available sources. 
Over the last 20 years, between 1980 and 2001, 42 patients from 28 families have been identified with 
NAGS  deficiency:  34  patients  who  were  diagnosed  as  NAGS  deficiency  and  8  siblings  who  had 
previously died without precise diagnosis. Of the 34 patients identified, 22 patients have been treated 
with NCGA, of whom 14 received the product from the applicant (of these 12 who have been already 
described). 
The difference in terms of mortality between treatments is shown in the table next page:

Data  provided  is  strongly  suggestive  that  carglumic  acid  has  an  important  impact  on  the  NAGS 
prognosis. The applicant committed to conduct a systematic follow-up of all NAGS deficient patients 
treated with Carbaglu to gather further efficacy information. 
Clinical safety 
Exposure 
Overall, twenty patients, 12 boys and 8 girls, started chronic NCGA treatment before 2001 and were 
included in the safety evaluation.  
The duration of therapy at the cut-off date (July 31, 2001), ranging from 9.8 to 0.7 years (median = 3.6 
years), was distributed as follows:  
• 
• 
• 
> 3 years: 
1 - 3 years: 
< 1 year:

At the cut-off date, the overall exposure to NCGA, whatever the indication, amounted to a total of 
64.5 patient-years. 
The age of the patients when NCGA was started ranged from 1 day to 13 years and was distributed as 
follows: 
< 1 month:

Discontinuation 
Out of the 20 patients, 15 patients were still on treatment at the cut-off-date and the reason for 
discontinuation in the other 5 patients were the following: 
♦ 
limited efficacy in one NAGS deficient patient 
♦ 
poor compliance and/or questionable efficacy in the long term: 3 patients with other urea cycle 
disorders 
death in one fatty acid oxidation disorder 
♦ 
Adverse events 
In patients receiving a normal dosage of NCGA no adverse events have been reported that could be 
attributed with certainty to the compound. Increased sweating in hot weather was reported in one 
patient, when she was about 1 year old and receiving around 150 mg/kg/day of NCGA. 
Laboratory findings 
Results  of  routine  laboratory  tests  are  available  for  18  patients;  these  include  haematology  (blood 
counts,  haemoglobin,  haematocrit,  prothrombin  time)  and  blood  chemistry  (usually  transaminases, 
bilirubin, urea, creatinine, total protein, glucose, electrolytes, iron). 
The  most  frequent  abnormality  was  anaemia,  which  was  frequently  related  to  iron  deficiency, 
especially  when  patients  were  on  hypoprotidic  diet,  but  also  in  other  patients  to  a  possible 
thalassaemic trait or frequent blood samplings. The other abnormalities were transient low electrolytes 
levels related to episodes of gastroenteritis or frequent vomiting. None of the abnormalities could be 
related to treatment. 
Published experience 
In the first patient (Bachmann, 82), a dose range finding was attempted and the dose was progressively 
increased to 750 mg/kg/day. This led to the clinical picture of a sympathomimetic-like reaction, with 
tachycardia,  profuse  sweating,  bronchial  hypersecretion,  increased  body  temperature  and  persistent 
crying.  In  the  absence  of  other  cases  reported,  the  causal  relationship  with  the  NCGA  cannot  be 
assessed. In the same patient, increased transaminases were detected on several occasions. This patient 
died after 9.5 years of treatment with NCGA. 
Safety related to interactions with other medicinal products 
NCGA has been used in association with a number of other medicinal products, but due to the very 
low number of patients no conclusions can be drawn and it still remains very important to further 
document associations with the same and with other medicinal products.

At the time of the CPMP opinion a number of minor quality issues were unresolved. The applicant 
gave a commitment to resolve them as post authorisation follow up measures: 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
NCGA  is  an  aminoacid, structurally  analogue of  NAG, which  is  the  naturally occurring  activator of 
CPS,  the  first  enzyme  involved  in  the  urea  cycle.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  NCGA  was  clearly 
established  and  its  effect  on  hyperammonaemia  models  (normal  or  partially  hepatectomised  rats 
receiving  potentially  lethal  doses  of  ammonium)  was  demonstrated  in  vivo.  Safety  pharmacology 
studies did not show any significant effect on respiration, central nervous system and cardiovascular 
system. 
The  pharmacokinetics  profile  in  rats  is  characterised  by  a  rapid  absorption,  following  oral 
administration of NCGA, a gender independent Tmax between 2 and 4 hours. The metabolic profile 
evaluated  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  did  not  reveal  relevant  metabolite  formation.  NCGA  was  mainly 
eliminated via urine and faeces. 
In  reviewing  the  toxicological  data  available,  no  overt  toxicity  of  NCGA  was  noted  in  rats.  NCGA 
was  non  genotoxic.  The  reproduction  toxicology  studies  programme  has  not  yet  been  finalised.  The 
preliminary  results  showed  no  evidence  of  embryotoxicity,  foetotoxicity  or  teratogenicity.  The  final 
results will be submitted as part of specific obligations to be fulfilled post-authorisation. The absence 
of carcinogenic studies was justified. 
Overall, the pharmacodynamic and toxicological characterisation of Carbaglu, although not extensive, 
did  not  identify/anticipate  relevant  concerns  in  relation  to  its  use  in  humans.  The  conduct  of 
reproductive toxicology, the results of which will be submitted post-authorisation will contribute to a 
more solid conclusion. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  has  been  evaluated  in  adult  healthy  volunteers.  It  is  characterised  by  a 
rapid  absorption,  wide  distribution  and  a  very  low  24h  urinary  excretion  of  the  dose  as  unchanged 
(around  5  %),  after  a  single  oral  administration  on  100  mg/kg.  Considering  the  sparse  data,  the 
applicant  committed  to  gather  further  data  to  gain  more  insight  into  the  fate  of  NCGA  in  healthy 
volunteers as well as in treated children. These data will be submitted post-authorisation. 
There was no dose ranging study, but the dose selection was based on the fast normalisation of plasma 
ammonia, which reflects the efficacy of the treatment. Based on the clinical experience, the treatment 
should  start  with  a  high  dose,  in  order  to  achieve  the  most  rapid  effect,  and  this  dose  should 
subsequently  be  tailored  for  each  patient  according  to  the  evolution  of  ammonia.  The  initial  dose 
recommended in the Summary of Products Characteristics is therefore 100 mg/kg up to 250 mg/kg, if 
necessary. 
The  data  presented  to  support  the  efficacy  of  NCGA  in  NAGS  deficiency  consist  of  a  retrospective 
series  of  20  treated  patients  evaluable  for  safety  (not  all  have  NAGS  deficiency)  of  which  12  were 
evaluable for efficacy. The NAGS deficient patients had either a neonatal or late onset presentation of 
the disease and were treated for a median of 3.1 years with NCGA. In most patients ammonia levels 
were normalised after introduction of treatment. Growth was normal in all patients and only one was 
suspected  of  being  permanently  disabled  already  before  starting  NCGA  therapy.  Patients  on  this 
treatment could be maintained stable without much diet restriction or concomitant therapies.  
Published data relating to 4 patients have been provided to further support the use of NCGA.  
Given  the  rarity  of  the  disease  (over  the  last  20  years,  42  patients  from  28  families  have  been 
identified  with  NAGS  deficiency  by  the  applicant),  one  cannot  expect  to  prove  efficacy  through 
classical controlled clinical trials, however, it has been shown that NCGA has an important effect size 
on the disease being treated. Additional analysis on the prognosis of the disease, which was based on 
18/19 
EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the retrospective data collection, published literature and data from other sources, provided insight on 
the  effect  size  in  terms  of  mortality  in  favour  of  NCGA  compared  to  no  treatment  or  conventional 
therapy which can be considered large enough in view of the lack of a controlled study. Indeed, death 
was  reported  in  all  patients  without  treatment  compared  to  5  patients  out  of  the  8  who  received 
conventional treatment and compared to none with NCGA produced by the applicant.  
The  applicant  committed  to  conduct  a  systematic  follow-up  of  all  NAGS  deficient  patients  treated 
with Carbaglu to gather further efficacy information. 
Overall  the  safety  data  derived  from  20  patients,  who  received  NCGA  and  have  been  treated  for  a 
median  of  3.6  years.  NCGA  seems  to  be  well  tolerated  and  no  major  safety  concern  has  been 
identified. Cases of increased sweating and increased transaminases levels have been reported. 
Overall, considering the rarity and the severity of the disease, the safety data, although sparse, can be 
considered  sufficient  for  the  granting  of  a  marketing  authorisation.  However  for  precautionary 
measures, systematic surveillance  of liver, renal, cardiac functions and haematological  parameters is 
recommended  as  mentioned  in  the  Summary  of  Products  Characteristics.  In  addition,  the  applicant 
committed to conduct a systematic follow-up of all NAGS deficient patients treated with Carbaglu to 
gather further safety information. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
Taking  into account that NAGS deficiency is a  rare disease with limited treatment  options and  with 
potentially  devastating  consequences,  the  CPMP  considered  that  despite  the  limited  data  available 
with  respect  to  pre-clinical  and  clinical  sections  of  the  application,  Carbaglu  offers  an  acceptable 
benefit/risk ratio for the treatment of hyperammonaemia due to NAGS deficiency.  
Considering  that  comprehensive  data  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  cannot  be  provided  under  normal 
conditions  of  use  because  of  the  rarity  of  the  disease,  the  CPMP  recommended  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances in this indication. The applicant committed 
therefore  to  provide  additional  quality,  preclinical  and  clinical  data  as  highlighted  previously.  The 
applicant committed also to conduct a post-marketing follow-up programme to systematically follow 
all NAGS deficient patients treated with Carbaglu in order to gather further information on its efficacy 
and safety in these patients. These data, which will be provided post-authorisation will form the basis 
of the annual reassessment of the benefit/risk profile of Carbaglu.  
Recommendation 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus 
that the benefit/risk profile of Carbaglu was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances for the treatment of hyperammonaemia due 
to N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency.

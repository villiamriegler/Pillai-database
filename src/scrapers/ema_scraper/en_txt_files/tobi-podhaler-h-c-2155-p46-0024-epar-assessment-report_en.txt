1.  Introduction 
On 12 May 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for tobramycin inhalation powder, in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that TBM100C2401E1 is a stand alone study.  
The MAH stated that study CTBM100C2401E1 (C2401E1) is an extension to the core study 
CTBM100C2401. The core study was a post approval measure for TOBI Podhaler but not part of the 
Paediatric Investigation Plan. The extension study is not part of the post approval measure for TOBI 
Podhaler. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The dose was 112 mg tobramycin (4x 28mg capsules), administered twice daily for 28 days followed 
by 28 days off treatment. The dose was the same for all patients, regardless of age or weight. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report(s) for: 
• 
study CTBM100C2401E1: A 48 week extension to CTBM100C2401, a single arm open-label, 
multicenter, phase IV trial, to assess long term safety of tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) in 
patients with Cystic Fibrosis 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study CTBM100C2401E1: A 48 week extension to CTBM100C2401, a single arm open-label, 
multicenter, phase IV trial, to assess long term safety of tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) in 
patients with Cystic Fibrosis 
Description 
An open label, multi-center, uncontrolled, single arm extension study (phase IV) to assess long term 
safety of tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, aged 6 years and 
older who have completed their study participation in the core study CTBM100C2401. The extension 
study consisted of 6 additional cycles of a 28-day on-treatment period followed by a 28-day off-
treatment period per cycle, for a total of 48 weeks. 
The core study CTBM100C2401 has been assessed and described in the assessment report for 
paediatric study submitted in accordance with article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objective 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety of Tobramycin Inhalation Powder (TIP) 
across 12 treatment cycles (6 treatment cycles in the core study and 6 treatment cycles in the 
extension study). The incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (AEs), including pulmonary 
exacerbations, over 12 cycles of treatment was the primary variable of interest. 
Secondary objective 
Secondary objective was assessment of efficacy of TIP across 12 cycles (6 treatment cycles in the core 
study and 6 treatment cycles in the extension study) by: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%) predicted (relative and absolute) 
the absolute change in P. aeruginosa colony forming unit (CFU) per gram of sputum 
the change of P. aeruginosa tobramycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
the time to first and the rate of the usage (overall, oral, intravenous) of anti-pseudomonal 
antibiotic (other than those regularly scheduled as prophylactic treatment) 
the time to first and the rate of hospitalization due to serious respiratory-related AEs 
to evaluate the safety profile of TIP in terms of clinical laboratory results and audiology (in a 
subset of patients) 
the safety profile of TIP in terms of acute change in FEV1 from pre-dose to 30 minutes post 
dose 
To evaluate the above endpoints of interest (including the primary endpoint of incidence of AEs) across 
the 6 cycles of treatment in this extension study. 
Exploratory objectives included to explore the rate of pulmonary exacerbations across 12 cycles of TIP 
treatment and to explore the characteristics of post inhalation events across 6 cycles of the extension. 
Study population /Sample size 
The study population was comprised of cystic fibrosis patients 6 years of age and older who completed 
the core study CTBM100C2401 and were able to comply with all protocol requirements of the extension 
study. 
The number of patients planned to be enrolled in this extension study was bound by the number of 
patients enrolled in the core study. A total of 45 patients were enrolled in this extension study, out of 
96 patients who completed the core study. A lower number of patients were enrolled than anticipated 
as some sites chose not to participate in this study, and a number of patients did not choose to enter 
this trial possibly due to the longer duration of the trial. 
CHMP’s comment: 
It seems that the risk of selection bias is low, because the efficacy data of the overall safety 
population for the first 6 cycles are similar to the efficacy data of the extension safety population for 
the first 6 cycles. In addition, the baseline disease characteristics at the start of the core study of the 
overall study population were similar to the baseline characteristics of the subgroup entering the 
extension study.

Treatments   
Eligible patients from the core study received the study drug for 6 additional treatment cycles. Patients 
received four TIP capsules (112 mg of tobramycin, 28 mg / capsule) via the T-326 Inhaler twice daily 
(morning and evening) in repeated cycles of 28 days on-treatment, followed by 28 days off-treatment 
period. Total duration of treatment was up to 48 weeks.

Measurement of the endpoints 
The study design included 8 site visits and 5 telephone calls (Figure 9-1). Visits 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 
26 were site visits and took place at the end of on-treatment period and before the off-treatment 
period started for each cycle. Visits 17, 19, 21, 23 and 25 were telephone calls made after each cycle, 
at the end of off-treatment period for that cycle.

Statistical Methods 
There were three populations defined for analysis purpose: 
- 
- 
- 
overall safety population (all patients who entered the core study and received at least one dose 
of study drug); 
extension safety population (all patients who entered the extension study and received at least 
one dose of study drug within the extension); 
audiology population (all patients in the extension safety population for whom at least one 
audiology test was performed). 
Since all patients received TIP in this single arm design, there was no formal statistical testing 
performed in the study. 
There was no imputation for missing data and no interim analysis was planned. 
To note: baseline refers to baseline in the core study, unless specifically mentioned as baseline in the 
extension study. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed  
The first patient enrolled on 27 Feb 2013 and the last patient completed the study 18 Nov 2014. 
The study was conducted at 22 centers in the following 9 countries: Argentina (3 centers), Australia (2 
centers), Canada (1 center), Germany (2 centers), Hungary (1 center), Italy (5 centers), Mexico (2 
centers), Spain (2 centers), United States (4 centers). 
From the 157 patients who entered the core study (overall safety population), 45/157 patients 
(28.7%) (extension safety population) consented to enter this extension study. 34/45 patients 
(75.6%) completed this extension study (6 cycles of TIP treatment). The most commonly reported 
reason for discontinuation was withdrawal of consent, reported by 5/45 patients (11.1%).

CHMP’s comment: 
The discontinuation rate in the extension safety population was 24.4%. The most frequently 
reported reason for discontinuation was withdrawal of consent (N=5; 11.1%). The reasons were 
not directly related to the study medication (change of patient’s residents (N=2); opportunity for 
a different clinical trial (N=1); personal problems (N=1); alternation of Tobi Podhaler with 
Cayston monthly (N=1). Additional reasons for premature discontinuation from the study were 
unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (N=2; 4.4%) and protocol deviations (N=2; 4.4%). There was 1 
patient (2.2%) reported with AE related discontinuation and there was 1 death (2.2%) recorded 
during this extension study that was not assessed as causally related to the study medication.   
The discontinuation rate in the overall safety population for the first 6 cycles was nearly 40%. The 
main reasons for discontinuations were due to AEs (29 patients (18,5%)) and from withdrawal of 
consent. The main reasons for withdrawing consent were that the inhalation of study drug was 
unpleasant and that patients were not satisfied with the effect of the study drug.  
In the extension study less patients stopped study medication due to AEs and no patient stopped 
treatment due to unpleasant inhalation of study drug.  
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics  
At baseline, the mean age of the extension safety population was 24.5 (±10.79) years and 29 % of 
them were younger than 20 years. The majority of patients included were males (55.6%).

Disease characteristics at the start of the extension study 
The mean FEV1% predicted of the patients at the start of the extension study was slightly lower 
compared to baseline (48.6% versus 52.2% respectively). The mean sputum density of P. aeruginosa 
for sum of all biotypes, at the start of the extension study was lower than at the baseline (6.4 log10 
CFU/gram versus 7.3 log10 CFU/gram respectively).

CHMP’s comment: 
The extension safety population (mean age 24.5 years) was a bit younger than the overall safety 
population (mean age 28 years).  At the start of the extension study patients had a lower mean 
FEV1% predicted (48.6%) compared to at the baseline (52.2%) but were less colonized with P. 
aeruginosa (mean sputum density for sum of all biotypes of P. aeruginosa 6.4 log10 CFU/gram 
versus 7.3 log10 CFU/gram). 
Efficacy results 
Relative change in FEV1% predicted:  
The mean FEV1% predicted for the extension study population increased from baseline for the first 3 
core treatment cycles after which there were slight decreases observed in core Cycles 5 and 6 (Figure 
11-1). At the end of Cycle 6 dosing in the core study, there was a mean decrease of 1.6% in FEV1% 
predicted from baseline. None of the changes from baseline were statistically significant. 
There were decreases from baseline in the mean FEV1% predicted throughout extension Cycles 7 to 
12. At the end of last treatment cycle dosing (Cycle 12), there was a mean relative decrease of 7.5% 
in FEV1% predicted from baseline over the 96 week study period. This was not tested for significance. 
When compared with the FEV1% predicted at the start of the extension study, there was a mean 
relative decrease of 0.6% in FEV1% predicted. None of the changes in FEV1% predicted from the start 
of the extension study were statistically significant.

Subgroup analysis 
Subgroup analysis of changes in FEV1% predicted showed that the subgroup of patients ≥20  years, 
the subgroup with baseline FEV1% predicted ≥ 50% and the subgroup with azithromycin use, had 
better lung function at the end of the study than the subgroups of younger age (6 to <13 years and 13 
to <20 years), baseline FEV1% predicted <50% and the subgroup that did not use azithromycin 
respectively. 
FEV1% predicted by age 
From baseline, all age subgroups showed decreases in mean FEV1% predicted at the last treatment 
Cycle 12. The decrease in FEV1% predicted at the end of dosing in Cycle 12 from baseline was 6.3% 
for the age subgroup 6 to <13 years (N=2), 13.4% for the 13 to <20 years age subgroup (N=11) and 
4.6% for the ≥20 years age group (N=23). 
Absolute change in P. aeruginosa sputum density: 
From baseline, there were decreases in the mean P. aeruginosa sputum density for sum of all biotypes 
at the end of dosing periods across 12 treatment cycles (6 cycles in the core study and 6 cycles in the 
extension study). As expected there was a tendency of an increase in P. aeruginosa sputum density at 
the end of the off-treatment periods of the core and extension treatment cycles (Figure 11-2). 
From the baseline, there was a decrease of 1.4 log10 CFU/gram at the end of dosing in the core study 
treatment Cycle 6, and there was a decrease of 0.6 log10 CFU/gram at the end of dosing in the last 
treatment cycle in the extension study (Cycle 12). The decreases in the sputum density of P.

aeruginosa were statistically significant across the core and extension study cycles (p<0.05), except at 
extension Cycle 12 (Table 11-6). 
Tobramycin MIC: 
At the completion of the extension study, 24.1% of patients (7 patients) showed no change in 
tobramycin MIC values, 44,8% ≥2-fold increase and 34.5% ≥4-fold increase. However, most of them 
still showed MIC values <8μg/mL at the extension study completion.  
At the completion of the core study (see Rapporteur’s preliminary assessment report), 18% of patients 
had no change in tobramycin MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) from baseline, 43% experienced 
at least a 2-fold increase in tobramycin MIC, and 27% had at least a 4-fold increase. For patients with 
a baseline MIC ≤ 8 μg/ml, 16.9% had an increase to a MIC > 8 μg/ml. 
New anti-pseudomonal antibiotic usage and hospitalization: 
Overall, 35 patients (77.8%) were treated with new additional anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (68.9% 
oral use, 55.6% IV use and 2.2% inhaled use) through 12 treatment cycles with a median total

duration of 59 days. The rate of usage was comparable between core and extension treatment cycles 
(66.7% versus 68.9% respectively). Also the rates of route of administration (oral/IV) were 
comparable between the core and extension study.  
The Kaplan-Meier estimates for the time to first new anti-pseudomonal antibiotic use showed that most 
patients reported first anti-pseudomonal antibiotic use in the core study cycles and during the initial 
cycles of the extension study, while a lower number of patients reported use during the later time-
points in the extension study. 
Overall, respiratory-related hospitalizations were reported for a total of 18 patients (40%) through 12 
treatment cycles with a median total duration of hospitalization of 17 days. The rate of hospitalizations 
was slightly higher during the extension treatment cycles compared to the core study cycles (35.6% 
versus 26.7%). Also the duration of hospitalization was slightly higher during the extension cycles 
(median 16 days) than during the core study cycles (median 13.5 days). 
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of time to first hospitalization due to respiratory-related events show that 
there were gradual increases in the cumulative number of new hospitalizations across core cycles and 
initial treatment cycles of the extension study, after which the rates remained constant.

Pulmonary exacerbations: 
Pulmonary exacerbations were reported by a total of 30 patients (66.7%) across 12 treatment cycles. 
Overall, these patients reported 89 episodes of exacerbations, most were mild or moderate in severity.  
A total of 34 (38.2%) episodes of exacerbations were assessed as SAEs and hospitalization was 
reported for a total of 36 (40.4%) exacerbation events. 
The rates of moderate and serious pulmonary exacerbation periods were slightly higher during the 
extension cycles (47.5% moderate periods/12.5% serious periods) compared to the core study cycles 
(38.8% moderate periods/8.2% serious periods). This was not tested for significance. The median 
duration of the episodes was 16 days for both the extension and core study cycles. 
Most patients reported the first exacerbation episode during core cycles. The frequency of new reports 
of exacerbation remained low and relatively constant from the dosing period of extension treatment 
Cycle 8 until off-treatment period of treatment Cycle 12.

CHMP’s comment: 
The efficacy data from the single arm extension study show a non-significant decrease of efficacy of 
TIP during the second year of treatment, measured as predicted mean FEV1 %. This decrease in FEV1 
% predicted is supported by a higher rate of moderate and serious pulmonary exacerbations  
compared to the core study (47.5% moderate periods/12.5% serious periods versus 38.8% moderate 
periods/8.2% serious periods), a higher rate of respiratory-related hospitalizations compared to the 
core study (35.6% versus 26.7%) and a slightly longer duration of hospitalization periods compared 
to the core study (median: 16 vs. 13.5 days).  
The Kaplan Meier curves of “time to first pulmonary exacerbation” (Fig 14.2-2.5), “first hospitalization 
due to respiratory-related serious adverse events” (Fig. 14.2-2.3) and “time to first new additional 
anti-pseudomonal antibiotic usage” show that the proportions of patients with pulmonary exacerbation 
episodes, respiratory-related serious adverse events and new additional anti-pseudomonal antibiotic 
usage increase across cycle 1 to 12. These increases are flattening out towards the end of the study. 
The antibacterial effect of TIP was maintained across the study as measured by the reduction in P. 
aeruginosa bacterial load. 
With regard to resistance development, the changes in tobramycin MIC values at the end of the 
extension study (cycles 7-12) were similar to that of the core study (cycles 1-6). 
Overall, the provided data suggest a decrease of efficacy over time (12 treatment cycles). The 
decrease is seen in FEV1% and also reflected in an increase in hospitalisations and exacerbations – 
albeit the rate appears to slow down with time as suggested by figure 14.2-2.5. It is important that 
loss of efficacy is monitored.  As agreed in the risk management plan, the MAH should follow up all 
reports suggestive of lack of efficacy with use of a follow up questionnaire and should discuss the 
analyses of lack of efficacy cases in the PSURs.

Safety results 
AEs: 
Across 12 treatment cycles (6 cycles in the core and 6 cycles in the extension study), a total of 86.7% 
(39/45 patients) reported AEs across on and off treatment periods, regardless of the study drug 
relationship (Table 12-2). The incidence of AEs was comparable across core (35 patients, 77.8%) and 
extension cycles (36 patients, 80%).  
AEs by preferred term: 
The most frequently reported adverse event across 12 treatment cycles was infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (30 patients, 66.7%); this was also the most commonly reported AE in 
the core and extension cycles (Table 12-3). Other commonly reported AEs were nasopharyngitis (13 
patients, 28.9%), hemoptysis (12 patients, 26.7%), cough (11 patients, 24.4%) and sputum increased 
(10 patients, 22.2%).

AEs by severity/serious adverse events: 
Across 12 treatment cycles, 40% of the reported AEs (reported by 18 patients) were moderate in 
severity, 24% (11 patients) were reported as severe AEs and 22.2% (10 patients) were reported as 
mild AEs. Most of the severe AEs were reported under SOC infections and infestations and was mostly 
reported as infective pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (8 patients, 17.8%). All other severe 
AEs were isolated cases, not reported by more than 1 patient. 
There was 1 death, a 15 year old female, reported due to pulmonary exacerbation during the off-
treatment period of last treatment cycle (Cycle 12). The primary precipitating factor for pulmonary 
exacerbation was a viral respiratory infection reported in the off-treatment period of Cycle 12. The 
patient went on to experience hypercapnic respiratory failure, respiratory acidosis, hemodynamic 
instability, cardiogenic shock and cardiac failure resulting in death. The AE (pulmonary exacerbation) 
was not suspected to be related to the study treatment. 
The SAEs were reported at a higher frequency in the extension study (16 patients, 35.6%) compared 
with the frequency in the core study (12 patients, 26.7%).

AEs suspected to be study drug related 
A total of 15 patients (33.3%) reported AEs suspected to be related to the study treatment across 12 
treatment cycles. Most of the AEs suspected to be related to the study-drug were reported in the on-
treatment period (12 patients, 26.7%) and commonly reported during the core treatment cycles (11 
patients, 24.4%). 
Airway reactivity 
Airway reactivity (≥ 20% decrease in pre-dose to 30 minutes post-dose) was reported by 2 patients 
overall (one in Cycle 3 and one in Cycle 4) with no occurrences in the extension cycles.

Post inhalation events: 
The most commonly reported event post inhalation within 5 minutes was cough across all the study 
cycles. The duration of the event was short and the median duration ranged from 0.08 to 0.25 
minutes. The duration of cough was generally higher during the core study cycles than in the extension 
study cycles. There were 4 patients with cough ongoing at the completion of the visit during the core 
study, while there was 1 such ongoing event reported during the extension study. 
Audiology 
Hearing loss of ≥ 10dB decrease at 2 consecutive frequencies was reported by 1 patient during Cycle 6 
of the core study, 1 patient during extension Cycle 7, 1 patient during extension Cycle 8 and 1 patient 
during extension Cycles 9, 10 and 12. For this last patient, the reported decrease was ≥15dB at 2 
consecutive frequencies during extension Cycles 9 and 10. At the extension study completion visit 
there was 1 report of a patient with ≥20dB decrease at 0.25 kHz frequency who had previously 
reported an AE of deafness (based on a reported 15dB decrease) during Cycle 9 which subsequently 
resolved. 
One patient was reported with neurosensory hearing loss in the right ear at core completion. In the 
extension study there was 1 patient with neurosensory hearing loss in the right ear during extension

CHMP’s comment: 
SAEs were reported at a higher frequency in the extension study compared with the frequency in the 
core study. This was likely driven by a difference in infective pulmonary exacerbations (table 12-5) 
which is also highlighted under the efficacy part. Overall, the reported AEs and their frequencies are 
comparable to the known safety profile of the product. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The completed single arm, open-label, multicentre, Phase IV 48 weeks extension trial to assess long 
term safety of tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) in patients with Cystic Fibrosis shows that TIP was 
reasonably well tolerated. SAEs were reported at a higher frequency in the extension study compared 
with the frequency in the core study. This was likely driven by a difference in infective pulmonary 
exacerbations. Overall, the reported AEs and their frequencies are comparable to the known safety 
profile of the product. 
The efficacy data show a decrease in FEV1 % during the second year of treatment. This decrease in 
FEV1 % predicted is reflected in higher rates of moderate and serious pulmonary exacerbations, 
respiratory-related hospitalizations and a longer duration of hospitalization periods compared to the 
first year of treatment. The proportions of patients with pulmonary exacerbation episodes, respiratory-
related serious adverse events and new additional anti-pseudomonal antibiotic usage increase across 
cycle 1-12, although these increases are flattening out with time as suggested by figure 14.2-2.5. 
There was no evidence of antibiotic resistance development during the extension study. Resistance 
development remains, however, an important potential risk for TIP. It is important that loss of efficacy 
is monitored. As agreed in the risk management plan, the MAH should follow up all reports suggestive 
of lack of efficacy with use of a follow up questionnaire and should discuss the analyses of lack of 
efficacy cases in the PSURs. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
The 48 week extension study CTBM100C2401E1 aimed to evaluate the long-term safety profile of 
tobramycin inhalation powder over six additional treatment cycles. The newly available data on safety 
are consistent with the data of the core study CTBM100C2401 and the known safety profile.  
No new safety concerns have been identified. 
The findings from the extension study CTBM100C2401E1 do not warrant any changes to the product 
information.

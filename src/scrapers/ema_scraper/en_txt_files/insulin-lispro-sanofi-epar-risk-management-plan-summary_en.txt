Summary of risk management plan for INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI (Insulin 
lispro) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI. The 
RMP details important risks of INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI, how these risks can be 
minimized, and how more information will be obtained about INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI’s 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package 
leaflet (PL) give essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how 
INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI should be read in the context of 
all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI’s RMP. 
I.THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI is authorized for the treatment of adults and children with 
diabetes mellitus who require insulin for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. 
INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI is also indicated for the initial stabilization of diabetes mellitus 
(see SmPC for the full indication). It contains insulin lispro as the active substance and it is 
given by SC route or continuous SC infusion. If necessary, INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI may 
also be administered intravenously. 
Further information about the evaluation of INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI’s benefits can be 
found in INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, 
available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage:

II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS  
Important risks of INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI, together with measures to minimize such 
risks and the proposed studies for learning more about INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI’s risks, 
are outlined in the next sections.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment so that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A LIST OF IMPORTANT RISKS AND MISSING INFORMATION 
Important risks of INSULIN LISPRO SANOFI are risks that need special risk management 
activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of INSULIN LISPRO 
SANOFI. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine 
is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the 
medicine);

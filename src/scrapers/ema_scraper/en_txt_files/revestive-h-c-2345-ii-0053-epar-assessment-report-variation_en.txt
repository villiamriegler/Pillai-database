1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Shire Pharmaceuticals Ireland 
Limited submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 24 March 2021 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.4  
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC in order to update the Product information with 
results from two studies included in the paediatric investigation plan (PIP). Study SHP633-301 was 
performed to evaluate the safety, efficacy/pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
teduglutide in infants 4 to 12 months gestational age with SBS and who are dependent on parenteral 
support. The second study is a paediatric population PK model including data from study SHP633-301. 
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
editorial changes to section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
This variation proposed changes to Product information, updating SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 to 
include results from two paediatric studies with “Revestive 1.25 mg powder and solvent for solution for 
injection”. In addition, editorial changes were made to section 4.5 of SmPC. 
SHP633-301 was a randomized, open-label study, conducted in 10 paediatric subjects from 4 to 12 
months of gestational age with short bowel syndrome (SBS) dependent on parenteral support (PS) to 
evaluate safety, efficacy/pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of teduglutide. The study consisted 
of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 24-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. 
Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a small bowel ostomy. During the 24-week 
treatment period, subjects in the SOC arm (n=5) received standard medical therapy for SBS while 
those in the teduglutide (TED) arm (n=5) received 0.05 mg/kg/day subcutaneously in addition to 
standard medical therapy. 
Based on subject diary data for the 3 individuals in the TED arm that completed the study, a reduction 
in the PS volume was reported, with a mean change in PS volume at end of treatment (EOT) from 
baseline of -21.5±28.91 mL/kg/day, corresponding to a mean percentage change of -24.8±34.72%. 
Furthermore, a mean reduction in PS caloric intake (-27.0±29.47%), daily infusion time 
(-28.9±30.61%) and number of days per week in PS usage (-28.5±30.05%) was observed at EOT 
from baseline. No subject achieved enteral autonomy. 
Adverse events reported in the study were consistent with the safety profile seen in the previous 
paediatric studies and no new safety issues were identified. Overall, there were a total of 87 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 10 (100%) subjects. TEAEs were mostly mild 
in severity and deemed not related to study drug by the investigators. No TESAEs were deemed 
related to study drug by the investigator. There were no TEAEs leading to death. There were no AESIs 
(events of polyps of the colon, benign neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract, or tumor-promoting 
ability) reported during the study.

Changes in body weight, length, and weight/length ratio Z-scores were within the expected range for 
the subjects' age group and comparable between the teduglutide treatment arm and the SOC arm. 
Head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm seemed to drop further over time compared 
with the teduglutide treatment arm. 
In order to justify dosing in the paediatric population, population pharmacokinetics (PK), PK/PD 
modelling and simulation of teduglutide were conducted based on data from 18 clinical studies, 
including Study SHP633-301. The relationship between teduglutide exposure (Cmax and AUC) and PS 
volume was evaluated using a time and exposure-response model. The analysis included a total of 251 
subjects with SBS with both exposure and values of prescribed PS volume at both baseline and the end 
of each study. The population included 5 subjects from 4 months to <1 year with a total of 19 PK 
samples collected via a sparse sample collection approach. The MAH states that Cmax similarity was 
observed across age groups supporting 0.05 mg daily dosing in paediatric subjects who are 4 months 
to less than 1 year of age. The mean CL/F values in subjects with moderate, severe renal impairment, 
and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were approximately 32%, 44%, and 57% lower than those in 
subjects with normal renal function, respectively. Based on the above results, a 50% dosage reduction 
is recommended in paediatric patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and ESRD as adult 
patients with same degrees of renal impairment. 
The exposure-safety analysis results showed a statistically significant relationship between steady state 
teduglutide exposure Cmax or AUC versus nausea or abdominal pain. 
There is no change in the indication and Revestive remain indicated from 1 year of age.  
CHMP agrees that current data do not support a recommendation on posology nor indication for 
children below 1 year of age. This has been implemented in section 4.2 of SmPC. Section 5.1 and 5.2 
have been amended to briefly describe results of study SHP633-301. 
The benefit-risk balance of Revestive, remains positive in the current indication.  
Information on paediatric requirements  
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0479/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0479/2020 was completed. The PDCO issued an 
opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0479/2020.

Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB are 
recommended. 
4.  EPAR changes 
The table in Module 8b of the EPAR will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Please refer to the Recommendations section above  
Summary 
Please refer to Scientific Discussion ‘Revestive-H-C-002345-II-0053’ 
In a completed clinical trial (SHP633-301) in paediatric subjects aged 4 to 12 months corrected 
gestational age with short bowel syndrome (SBS) dependent on parenteral support (PS), a total of 10 
subjects were randomized to the teduglutide arm (n=5) and Standard of Care arm (SOC, n=5), of 
which 8 subjects completed the study. Overall, results showed a relatively higher number of subjects 
achieving clinically meaningful reductions in PS nutrition volume, caloric intake and a higher 
percentage of the average reductions in PS calories, daily infusion time an number of days per week in 
PS usage within the teduglutide arm than the SOC arm. No subject achieved enteral autonomy during 
the study. Adverse events reported in the study were consistent with the safety profile seen in the 
previous paediatric studies and no new safety issues were identified.  
Population pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK/PD modelling and simulation of teduglutide demonstrated 
Cmax similarity across age groups (4 months to 17 years) supporting 0.05 mg daily dosing in pediatric 
subjects who are 4 months to less than 1 year of age. A 50% dosage reduction is recommended in 
paediatric patients with moderate to severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease (ESRD) as 
adult patients with same degrees of renal impairment.

Annex: Rapporteur’s assessment comments on the type II 
variation 
5.  Introduction 
Teduglutide (rDNA origin) is an analog of naturally occurring human glucagon-like peptide-2, a peptide 
secreted by L-cells of the distal intestine. Teduglutide under the trade name Revestive® first received 
marketing authorization in the European Union via centralized procedure for the treatment of short 
bowel syndrome (SBS) on 30 Aug 2012. On 29 Jun 2016, the European Commission granted an 
extension of the Market Authorization for teduglutide (Revestive) for the treatment of patients aged 1 
year and above with SBS.  
The MAH proposes to update the Summary of Clinical Pharmacology with the results of  
• 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) results of Study SHP633-301, a randomized, open-label study to 
evaluate the safety, efficacy/pharmacodynamics (PD), and PK of teduglutide in infants 4 to 
12 months corrected gestational age (a premature baby's chronological age minus the number 
of weeks or months he/she was born early) with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support 
(PS).  
•  A population PK analysis of teduglutide based on data from 18 clinical studies including the 
recently completed Phase 3 Study SHP633-301 in pediatric subjects 4 months to <1 year 
corrected gestational age (SHIR-CSC-129_PKglobal).  
•  An exposure-response analysis (SHIR-CSC-129_ERglobal) to assess the relationship between 
o 
o 
teduglutide exposure and the change from baseline in PS volume in pediatric subjects 
(4 months and older) with SBS.  
teduglutide exposure and safety endpoints of interest (ie, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
nausea and diarrhea) in subjects (4 months and older) with SBS 
6.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study SHP633-301 
SHP633-301 was a randomized, open-label study consisting of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 24 
week treatment period, and 4-week follow-up period. All subjects were screened prior to start of 
treatment to verify the requirements for nutritional support for each subject and to ensure adherence 
to eligibility parameters. Subjects were randomized (1:1 ratio) to the teduglutide or standard of care 
(SOC) treatment arm. Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a small bowel ostomy 
(eg, end jejunostomy or ileostomy). During the 24-week treatment period, subjects in the SOC arm 
received standard medical therapy for SBS while those in the teduglutide arm received 0.05 
mg/kg/day subcutaneously in addition to standard medical therapy. At each site visit during the 
treatment phase, efficacy (adjustments to PS) and safety were monitored.  
Sparse blood samples for PK analysis were collected in subjects enrolled in the teduglutide arm at 
predose, and 1 hour (±10 minutes) and 4 hours (±10 minutes) postdose at baseline (Visit 0). Samples 
were also collected 2 hours (±10 minutes) postdose at Week 7 (Visit 7) or Week 12 (Visit 12) of the 
Assessment report

treatment period. Originally, there was an option to collect postbaseline PK samples at Week 7 or Week 
12; however, this option was removed in protocol Amendment 4 and thereafter all postbaseline PK 
samples were to be collected at Week 7.  
At the end of the treatment period (Week 24/EOT), all subjects entered a 4-week follow-up period until 
the end of study (Week 28) during which time subjects received standard medical therapy, but no 
investigational product was administered. At the end of the treatment period, some subjects who 
completed the study had the opportunity to participate in a long-term extension study, SHP633 304, in 
which eligible subjects would continue to receive teduglutide. The follow-up period for subjects in the 
teduglutide treatment arm may have been truncated and the subjects could have proceeded 
immediately to the end of study visit if at least 1 “escape” criteria was met. 
Assessor´s comments  
SHP633-301 was a randomized, open-label study consisting of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 24 
week treatment period, and 4-week follow-up period. Randomization was stratified according to the 
presence of a small bowel ostomy (e.g., end jejunostomy or ileostomy). During the 24-week treatment 
period, subjects in the SOC arm received standard medical therapy for SBS while those in the 
teduglutide arm received 0.05 mg/kg/day subcutaneously in addition to standard medical therapy. 
Sparse blood samples for PK analysis were collected in subjects enrolled in the teduglutide arm at 
predose, and 1 hour and 4 hours postdose at baseline (Visit 0). Samples were also collected 2 hours 
postdose at Week 7 (Visit 7) or Week 12 (Visit 12) of the treatment period. Originally, there was an 
option to collect postbaseline PK samples at Week 7 or Week 12; however, this option was removed in 
protocol Amendment 4 and thereafter all postbaseline PK samples were to be collected at Week 7.  
The MAH is asked to present the number of plasma samples collected and used for analysis in study 
SHP633-301 (OC). 
At the end of the treatment period, some subjects who completed the study had the opportunity to 
participate in a long-term extension study, SHP633 304, in which eligible subjects would continue to 
receive teduglutide. 
6.2.  Results 
A total of 10 subjects were randomized in the study, 5 subjects in each treatment arm and analyzed 
for safety and efficacy/PD.  
Eight subjects completed the study. Two subjects discontinued from the study: 1 subject in the 
teduglutide arm met escape criteria during the follow-up period and 1 subject in the SOC arm 
discontinued early from the study during the treatment period. In addition, 1 subject interrupted 
teduglutide treatment following the parents’ decision to stop teduglutide administration as they 
thought several adverse events were caused by the study drug; teduglutide treatment never resumed 
and the subject completed the study. 
The PK set contains all subjects who received at least 1 dose of teduglutide and had at least 1 
evaluable and interpretable postdose PK concentration value. All 5 subjects randomized in the 
teduglutide arm were included in the PK set; 1 subject missed the Week 7 postdose sample collection 
due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The mean ±standard deviation (SD) teduglutide plasma 
concentrations over time are presented in the SHP633-301 clinical study report (CSR) Section 14, 
Figure 14.2.3.18 in both linear and semi-log scales.  
The exposure to teduglutide, as presented by serum teduglutide concentrations measured in the 
samples collected at different times post once daily subcutaneous (SC) administration and at different

days over the treatment period, was demonstrated over the study duration in infant subjects receiving 
teduglutide. 
The summary of mean, median, minimum, and maximum teduglutide plasma concentrations by 
timepoint is presented in Table 1. The median postdose teduglutide plasma concentrations were 16.30 
ng/mL at 1 hour, 16.95 ng/mL and 25.65 ng/mL at 2 hours (Week 7 and Week 12 visits, respectively), 
and 8.39 ng/mL at 4 hours. The minimum and maximum postdose teduglutide plasma concentrations 
were 2.21 ng/mL and 29.00 ng/mL over the sample collection time during the treatment, respectively.

The plasma concentrations of teduglutide for individual subjects are listed in SHP633-301 CSR 
Appendix 16.2.5, Listing 16.2.5.4. All subjects tested presented teduglutide concentrations that were 
below the limit of quantification (<1.0 ng/mL) at the predose timepoint (baseline visit) and measurable 
teduglutide plasma concentrations postdose at least at 1 visit. One subject presented teduglutide 
concentrations that were below limit of quantification at the 1-hour and 4-hour postdose timepoints at 
the baseline visit but presented concentrations of 19.1 ng/mL and 26.8 ng/mL at the 2-hour postdose 
timepoint at Week 7 and Week 12 visits, respectively.

The PK set contains all subjects who received at least 1 dose of teduglutide and had at least 1 
evaluable and interpretable postdose PK concentration value. All 5 subjects randomized in the 
teduglutide arm were included in the PK set; 1 subject missed the Week 7 postdose sample collection. 
The median postdose teduglutide plasma concentrations were 16.30 ng/mL at 1 hour, 16.95 ng/mL 
and 25.65 ng/mL at 2 hours (Week 7 and Week 12 visits, respectively), and 8.39 ng/mL at 4 hours. 
The minimum and maximum postdose teduglutide plasma concentrations were 2.21 ng/mL and 29.00 
ng/mL over the sample collection time during the treatment, respectively. 
6.4.  Pharmacodynamic Studies 
Study SHP633-301 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Comparison and Analyses of Results Across Studies 
Further population PK and PK/PD modeling and simulation to support Type II submission for pediatrics 
4 months to <1 year were conducted including data from Study SHP633-301, following the Japanese 
submission for adult and pediatric patients with SBS. A total of 7 pediatrics subjects 4 months to 
<1 year of age with SBS who are dependent on PS are included, 5 subjects from Study SHP633-301 
and 2 subjects from Study SHP633-302.  
Pharmacokinetics in PS-dependent Pediatric Subjects with SBS 
Results from a population PK analysis of teduglutide is presented using data from 18 clinical trials, 
including data of 101 pediatric subjects 4 months and older collected in studies TED-C13-003, 
TED-C14-006, SHP633-302, and SHP633-301.  
Methodology  
The population PK modeling analysis included a total of 7 pediatric subjects 4 months to <1 year of 
age, 5 subjects from Study SHP633-301 and 2 subjects from Study SHP633-302; this PK information 
was available after the completion of study SHP633-301. Overall, a total of 480 subjects were included 
in the population PK analysis. The PK population included a total of 101 pediatric and 379 adult 
subjects. The population consisted of 304 (63.3%) male and 176 (36.7%) female subjects. Most 
subjects were of white origin (81.5%). The population included a total of 7 pediatric subjects from 4 
months to <1 year, 86 pediatric subjects 1 to <12 years, 8 pediatric subjects 12 to <18 years, and 
379 adult subjects (≥18 years). A total of 349 (72.7%) subjects had normal renal function. A total of 
78 (16.2%), 40 (8.3%), and 7 (1.5%) subjects presented mild, moderate, severe renal impairment, 
respectively. A total of 6 (1.2%) subjects were at end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 
A one-compartment disposition model with a first-order rate constant of absorption (Ka) and lag time 
(ALAG) was previously used to describe the concentration-time profiles of teduglutide based on data 
collected in 478 subjects (18 clinical studies). The population PK model included allometric functions 
accounting for the effect of body weight on PK parameters (Ka, apparent clearance [CL/F], and 
apparent central volume of distribution [Vc/F]). The above population PK model was updated by 
including pediatric subjects 4 months to <1 year with SBS enrolled in Studies SHP633-301 and 
SHP633-302. In addition, source of variability on PK parameters of teduglutide, including intrinsic 
factors (body weight, age, renal function, race, sex, and disease status) and extrinsic factors (dose, 
formulation strength, and site injection) were performed to improve the population PK model. The 
model evaluation was based on standard model diagnostics and goodness-of-fit criteria and by looking

at pertinent graphical representations of goodness-of-fit. Finally, the simulation was performed to 
estimate the PK parameters using the final population PK model and the PK parameters were 
summarized for pediatric (across age groups) and adult subjects with SBS (SHIR-CSC-129_PKglobal).

Results 
Population PK parameters of teduglutide derived with the final model (run009) are presented. Body 
weight, age, baseline creatinine clearance (CrCL), injection site, and disease status were identified as 
significant covariates affecting PK parameters including CL/F, Vc/F, and Ka. Sensitivity analyses did not 
show any differences in population PK model improvement between with and without including the 
kidney maturation. Overall, data collected in pediatric subjects 4 months to <1 year did not impact the 
population PK estimates as compared with the previous population PK for the Japanese submission.

Mean and median Cmax,ss values of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with SBS across age groups (mean 
range: 28.5 ng/mL to 43.0 ng/mL and median range: 26.7 ng/mL to 37.4 ng/mL) were consistent with 
that observed in adult subjects with SBS (mean: 39.6 ng/mL) when receiving 0.05 mg/kg daily. 
Moreover, the range of individual Cmax,ss values of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with SBS across age 
groups (20.7 to 84.9 ng/mL) was similar to that observed in adult subjects with SBS (19.5 ng/mL to 
75.3 ng/mL). In addition, mean t1/2 values of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with SBS across age 
groups (mean range: 0.813 h to 1.17 h) were consistent with that observed in adult subjects with SBS 
(mean: 1.22 h). 
Mean AUCss values were age-dependent and gradually decreased with age from a mean of 
223 ng•h/mL in adults to 78.6 ng•h/mL in pediatric subjects 4 months to <1 year when receiving 
0.05 mg/kg teduglutide daily. 
It is to be noted that a 87% decrease in body weight (from 57.9 kg in adults to 7.51 kg in the 
4 months to <1 year) resulted in a 65% decrease in AUCss (from 223 ng•h/mL in adults to 
78.6 ng•h/mL in the 4 months to <1 year).  
Overall, results confirmed that pediatric patients 4 months to <18 years are expected to present 
similar Cmax,ss values of teduglutide as observed in adults. On the other hand, the AUCss of teduglutide 
was age-dependent and gradually decreased from adults to pediatric subjects between 4 months and 
<1 year of age. Clinical PS response data in conjunction with Cmax,ss were demonstrated to support

teduglutide dose selection since AUCss was previously shown not to correlate with efficacy. Thus, as a 
response marker, Cmax of teduglutide has been targeted across age populations. The current analyses 
have confirmed similarity of Cmax of teduglutide across age populations including pediatrics subjects 4 
month to <1 year of age with SBS, therefore, supporting 0.05 mg/kg daily in this age group patients. 
Assessor´s comments 
Body weight, age, baseline creatinine clearance (CrCL), injection site, and disease status were 
identified as significant covariates affecting PK parameters including CL/F, Vc/F, and Ka. Sensitivity 
analyses did not show any differences in population PK model improvement between with and without 
including the kidney maturation. Overall, data collected in pediatric subjects 4 months to <1 year did 
not impact the population PK estimates as compared with the previous population PK for the Japanese 
submission. 
Overall, the MAH considers that pediatric patients 4 months to <18 years are expected to present 
similar Cmax,ss values of teduglutide as observed in adults. However, the AUCss of teduglutide was age-
dependent and gradually decreased from adults to pediatric subjects between 4 months and <1 year of 
age. The Applicant states that Cmax of teduglutide has been targeted across age populations, and that 
the current analyses have confirmed similarity of Cmax of teduglutide across age populations including 
pediatrics subjects 4 month to <1 year of age with SBS, therefore, supporting 0.05 mg/kg daily in this 
age group patients.

As per the population PK model, the CL/F of teduglutide was dependent on CrCL and body weight. The 
mean body weight adjusted CL/F in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment was approximately 
25% lower than that observed in subjects with normal renal function. The lower body weight adjusted 
CL/F in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment resulted in a 17% higher AUCss relative to those 
with normal renal function (139 ng•h/mL vs 119 ng•h/mL, respectively).  
The mean body weight adjusted Vc/F values in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment was 32% 
lower than that observed in subjects with normal renal function. The lower Vc/F in pediatric subjects 
with mild renal impairment resulted in a 49% higher Cmax,ss relative to those with normal renal function 
(49.7 ng/mL vs 33.3 ng/mL, respectively), but the minimum and maximum Cmax values in pediatric 
subjects with mild renal impairment were retained within the range of Cmax values observed in pediatric 
subjects with normal renal function.  
The above increases in AUCss and Cmax,ss were not deemed clinically relevant and therefore no dose 
adjustment is recommended in pediatric subjects with mild renal impairment. 
Overall, the above results are consistent with those observed in adult subjects with SBS, whereby 
slightly lower CL/F and Vc/F in subjects with mild renal impairment did not result in a clinically relevant 
increase on the AUCss and Cmax,ss of teduglutide relative to subjects with normal renal function. Based 
on a dedicated study (Study CL0600-018) in non-SBS subjects with renal impairment, the mean CL/F 
values in subjects with moderate, severe renal impairment, and ESRD were approximately 32%, 44%, 
and 57% lower than those in subjects with normal renal function, respectively. Based on the above 
results, a 50% dosage reduction is recommended in pediatric patients with moderate to severe renal 
impairment and ESRD as adult patients with same degrees of renal impairment (refer to SHIR-CSC-
129_PKglobal, Appendix 5, Section 15.1 and Section 15.4).

Immunogenicity Effect 
To assess the effect on PK further, anti-drug antibodies (ADA) status was tested in the population PK 
analyses, as one of covariates, based on data from 3 studies including both adult and pediatric 
subjects with SBS (according to data availability) (SHIR-CSC-129-Japanese, Population PK Analysis). 
The results showed that the ADA incidence was small and did not have an impact on PK of teduglutide. 
Since the updated dataset included only one new concentration in a subject with ADA positive, ADA 
was not retested in the current analysis.  
PK/PD Relationship in PS-dependent Pediatric Subjects with SBS 
This section presents results from an exposure-response modelling analyses developed to assess the 
relationship between  
• 
• 
teduglutide exposure and the change from baseline in PS volume in pediatric subjects 
(4 months and older) with SBS  
teduglutide exposure and safety endpoints of interest (ie, vomiting; abdominal pain, nausea 
and diarrhea) in subjects (4 months and older) with SBS.  
This exposure-response analysis of teduglutide used data from 10 clinical trials, including data of 
101 pediatric subjects 4 months and older collected in Studies TED-C13-003, TED-C14-006, SHP633-
302, and SHP633-301. A brief description of each of the 10 clinical studies is provided in SHIR-CSC-
129_ERglobal, Appendix 1, Section 11.1 and Section 11.2).

To assess the effect on PK further, anti-drug antibodies (ADA) status was tested in the population PK 
analyses, as one of covariates, based on data from 3 studies including both adult and pediatric 
subjects with SBS. The MAH states that the ADA incidence was found small and did not have an impact 
on PK of teduglutide. Since the updated dataset included only one new concentration in a subject with 
ADA positive, ADA was not retested in the current analysis. This is accepted.  
Parenteral Support 
The relationship between teduglutide exposure (Cmax and AUC) and PS volume was evaluated using a 
time and exposure-response model. Efficacy (PS volume) datasets were from Studies CL0600-004, 
CL0600-020, CL0600-021, TED-C13-003, TED-C14-004, TED-C14-006, SHP633-301, SHP-633-302, 
SHP-633-306, and SHP-633-307. 
The current analysis therefore included a total of 251 subjects with SBS with both exposure and values 
of prescribed PS volume at both baseline and the end of each study. The population included a total of 
7 pediatric subjects from 4 months to <1 year, 86 pediatric subjects 1 to <12 years, 8 pediatric 
subjects 12 to <18 years, and 150 adult subjects. The median body weight (range) and age (range) 
were 48.8 kg (5.26 kg to 87.9 kg) and 35.0 years (0.380 year to 87.9 years), respectively. Descriptive 
statistics of subjects included in the exposure-response analysis of efficacy is presented in SHIR-CSC-
129_ERglobal, Section 8.3.  
Individual change from baseline prescribed PS volumes in pediatric subjects as a function of dose are 
presented. Studies SHP633-301, SHP633-302, TED-C13-003, TED-C14-004, and TED-C14-006 in 
pediatric subjects were performed up to 112 and 196 days (Week 28) of dosing.

Various time- and exposure-response models were developed to optimally assess the change from 
baseline diary PS volume over time. An overview of all models developed for model discrimination is 
presented in SHIR-CSC-129_ERglobal, Appendix 4, Section 14.5. In a first step, longitudinal data from 
studies performed over 2 years of more (i.e., CL0600-021 and SHP633-307) were modelled to assess 
the effect of time.  
Based on the above model, the estimated time to 50% of the maximum effect (ET50) was 
approximately 168 days. The above results suggest that only 50% of the maximum effect is observed 
at Week 24 (168 days). In a second step, the ET50 was fixed to 168 days, and the effect of teduglutide 
AUC and Cmax were evaluated. The model with Cmax (estimated with an exponent in a power model) 
was associated with a better goodness-of-fit relative to a model with AUC. The time- and exposure-
response model based on the Cmax of teduglutide is described in SHIR-CSC-129_ERglobal, Table 6. 
Descriptive statistics of PK and PD parameters (change from baseline prescribed PS volume) in 
pediatric and adult subjects who received the 0.05 mg/kg teduglutide dosing regimen are presented. 
The median baseline prescribed PS volume in pediatric and adult subjects were 6.88 L/Week and 10.4 
L/Week, respectively.  
At Week 24, pediatric and adult subjects presented a median change from baseline of -1.83 L/Week 
and -2.40 L/Week of prescribed PS volume, respectively. The above changes at Week 24 corresponded 
to a median percent change from baseline of -27% and -23% in pediatric and adult subjects, 
respectively.  
At steady state, pediatric and adult subjects presented a median maximum change from baseline 
of -3.67 L/Week and -4.80 L/Week of prescribed PS volume, respectively. The above changes at 
steady state corresponded to a median percent change from baseline of -53% and -46% in pediatric 
and adult subjects, respectively.

Assessor´s comments  
The relationship between teduglutide exposure (Cmax and AUC) and PS volume was evaluated using a 
time and exposure-response model. Efficacy (PS volume) datasets were from Studies CL0600-004, 
CL0600-020, CL0600-021, TED-C13-003, TED-C14-004, TED-C14-006, SHP633-301, SHP-633-302, 
SHP-633-306, and SHP-633-307. 
The current analysis therefore included a total of 251 subjects with SBS with both exposure and values 
of prescribed PS volume at both baseline and the end of each study. The population included a total of 
7 pediatric subjects from 4 months to <1 year, 86 pediatric subjects 1 to <12 years, 8 pediatric

subjects 12 to <18 years, and 150 adult subjects. The median body weight (range) and age (range) 
were 48.8 kg (5.26 kg to 87.9 kg) and 35.0 years (0.380 year to 87.9 years), respectively. 
Based on the above model, the estimated time to 50% of the maximum effect (ET50) was 
approximately Week 24 (168 days). In a second step, the ET50 was fixed to 168 days, and the effect of 
teduglutide AUC and Cmax were evaluated. 
The median baseline PS volume in the 4 months to <1 year, 1 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to 
17 years age groups were 3.61 L/Week, 6.68 L/Week, 6.88 L/Week, and 11.7 L/Week, respectively.  
At Week 24, the median change from baseline PS volume in the 4 months to <1 year, 1 to <6 years, 6 
to <12 years, and 12 to 17 years age groups were -0.620 L/Week, -1.01 L/Week, -2.88 L/Week, 
and -4.31 L/Week, respectively. These above changes at Week 24 corresponded to median percent 
change from baseline of -17%, -15%, -42% and -37%, respectively.  
At steady state, the median maximum change from baseline PS volume in the 4 months to <1 year, 1 
to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to 17 years age groups were -1.24 L/Week, -2.02 L/Week, -5.76 
L/Week, and -8.63 L/Week, respectively. These above changes at steady state corresponded to a 
median percent change from baseline of -34%, -30%, -84% and -74%, respectively.  
Safety (Vomiting, Diarrhea, Nausea, Abdominal Pain) 
An exposure-response analysis was performed to assess the relationship between teduglutide exposure 
and the probability of the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) in subjects with 
SBS. Safety (adverse events) included datasets from Studies CL0600-004, CL0600-020, CL0600-021, 
TED-C13-003, TED-C14-004, TED-C14-006, SHP633-301, SHP-633-302, SHP-633-306, and SHP-633-
307. 
A total of 234 subjects with SBS were included in the analysis. Of which 53 (22.6%) presented at least 
one instance of vomiting, 28 (12.0%) presented at least one instance of diarrhea, 37 (15.8%) 
presented at least one instance of nausea, and 59 (25.2%) presented at least one instance of 
abdominal pain. The relationship between teduglutide exposure and the probability of the above TEAE 
was assessed. Descriptive statistics on the number of subjects by study are presented in SHIR-CSC-
129_ERglobal, Section 8.4. 
Probability of Vomiting 
The probability of vomiting as a function of teduglutide exposure parameters at steady state (Cmax and 
AUC) are presented. No exposure-response relationship was observed since the probability of vomiting 
did not significantly increase with higher Cmax and AUC values (Wald test p-value >0.05).

Probability of Nausea  
The probability of nausea as a function of teduglutide exposure parameters at steady state (Cmax and 
AUC) are presented. A statistically significant exposure-response relationship was observed since the 
probability of nausea increased significantly with higher Cmax and AUC values (Wald test p-value 
<0.05). The exposure-response model based on Cmax was associated with better goodness-of-fit (i.e., 
lower Akaike Criteria [AIC]) relative to the AUC model (202.7 and 204.0, respectively).

Assessor´s comments  
An exposure-response analysis was performed to assess the relationship between teduglutide exposure 
and the probability of the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) in subjects with 
SBS. Safety (adverse events) included datasets from Studies CL0600-004, CL0600-020, CL0600-021, 
TED-C13-003, TED-C14-004, TED-C14-006, SHP633-301, SHP-633-302, SHP-633-306, and SHP-633-
307. 
A total of 234 subjects with SBS were included in the analysis.

A statistically significant exposure-response relationship was observed on the probability of vomiting 
and abdominal pain since the probability of nausea increased significantly with higher Cmax and AUC 
values (Wald test p-value <0.05). 
No exposure-response relationship was observed on the probability of vomiting or diarrhea, since the 
probability did not significantly increase with higher Cmax and AUC values (Wald test p-value >0.05). 
The MAH is asked to discuss the clinical significance of the presented exposure-safety results in 
regards of nausea and abdominal pain, which should include instructions for prescribing physician e.g. 
dose adjustments. The MAH should also explain the discrepancy between the results of the 
probabilities of nausea and vomiting, since these TEAS are normally closely related (OC). 
Special Studies 
Not applicable. 
Discussion 
Further population PK and PK/PD modeling and simulation were conducted to support the proposed 
type II variation in pediatrics 4 months to <1 year A total of 7 pediatrics subjects 4 months to <1 year 
of age with SBS who are dependent on PS are included. 
The PK population included a total of 101 pediatric and 379 adult subjects. The population included a 
total of 7 pediatric subjects from 4 months to <1 year, 86 pediatric subjects 1 to <12 years, 
8 pediatric subjects 12 to <18 years, and 379 adult subjects (≥18 years) 
Body weight, age, baseline creatinine clearance (CrCL), injection site, and disease status were 
identified as significant covariates affecting PK parameters including CL/F, Vc/F, and Ka. Sensitivity 
analyses did not show any differences in population PK model improvement between with and without 
including the kidney maturation. Overall, data collected in pediatric subjects 4 months to <1 year did 
not impact the population PK estimates as compared with the previous population PK for the Japanese 
submission. 
Overall, the MAH considers that pediatric patients 4 months to <18 years are expected to present 
similar Cmax,ss values of teduglutide as observed in adults. However, the AUCss of teduglutide was age-
dependent and gradually decreased from adults to pediatric subjects between 4 months and <1 year of 
age. The Applicant states that Cmax of teduglutide has been targeted across age populations, and that 
the current analyses have confirmed similarity of Cmax of teduglutide across age populations including 
pediatrics subjects 4 month to <1 year of age with SBS, therefore, supporting 0.05 mg/kg daily in this 
age group patients. 
An exposure-response analysis was performed to assess the relationship between teduglutide exposure 
and the probability of the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) in subjects with 
SBS. A total of 234 subjects with SBS were included in the analysis. A statistically significant exposure-
response relationship was observed on the probability of vomiting and abdominal pain since the 
probability of nausea increased significantly with higher Cmax and AUC values (Wald test p-value 
<0.05). No exposure-response relationship was observed on the probability of vomiting or diarrhea, 
since the probability did not significantly increase with higher Cmax and AUC values (Wald test p-value 
>0.05).

7.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study SHP633-301 
SHP633-301 was a randomized, open-label study consisting of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 24 
week treatment period, and 4-week follow-up period. All subjects were screened prior to start of 
treatment to verify the requirements for nutritional support for each subject and to ensure adherence 
to eligibility parameters. Subjects had to be receiving at least 50% of fluid or calories parenterally and 
have stable PS requirements for at least 1 month prior to screening and weigh at least 5 kg with a 
weight for length Z-score greater than -2 at screening and baseline. Subjects were randomized (1:1 
ratio) to the teduglutide or standard of care (SOC) treatment arm at the baseline visit (Week 0). 
Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a small bowel ostomy (e.g., end 
jejunostomy or ileostomy). During the 24-week treatment period, subjects in the SOC arm received 
standard medical therapy for SBS while those in the teduglutide arm received 0.05 mg/kg/day 
subcutaneously in addition to standard medical therapy.  
Subjects in both arms followed the same visit schedule and assessments. Subjects were monitored 
weekly with phone or clinic visits. Clinic visits occurred at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. 
At all site visits and telephone contacts, safety was monitored and nutritional support was reviewed 
and adjusted as needed. To maintain consistency across centers, guidance and training were provided 
to help sites follow the nutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed with SBS expert input and 
provided in the protocol) related to decisions for PS reduction and advances in enteral feeds based on 
weight gain, urine and stool output, and clinical stability. Deviations from the guidelines were not 
considered a protocol deviation. 
Blood samples for native GLP-2 measurements were collected at the screening and at end of the 
treatment (EOT) visits. Native GLP-2 may not have been collected in some subjects if blood volumes 
were limiting based on subject weight or at the investigator discretion based on weekly/monthly total 
volume. 
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected in the teduglutide treatment arm at baseline (predose, 
and 1 hour and 4 hours postdose) and at Week 7 (2 hours postdose).  
At the end of the treatment period (Week 24), all subjects entered a 4-week follow-up period until the 
end of study (Week 28/EOS) during which time subjects received standard medical therapy, but no 
investigational product was administered. At the end of the treatment period, some subjects who 
completed the study had the opportunity to participate in a long-term extension study, SHP633 304, in 
which eligible subjects would continue to receive teduglutide. The follow-up period for subjects in the 
teduglutide treatment arm may have been truncated and the subjects could have proceeded 
immediately to the EOS visit if at least 1 “escape” criteria was met.

7.2.  Results 
Disposition of Subjects 
Disposition of subjects is presented in SHP633-301 Clinical Study Report (CSR), Section 10.1. 
Eight subjects completed the study. Two subjects discontinued from the study: 1 subject in the 
teduglutide arm met escape criteria during the follow-up period and 1 subject in the SOC arm 
discontinued early from the study during the treatment period. In addition, 1 subject interrupted 
teduglutide treatment following Week 10 visit due to the parents’ decision to stop teduglutide 
administration as they thought several AEs were caused by the study drug; teduglutide treatment 
never resumed and the subject completed the study. 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics are presented in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 10.4. The mean 
corrected gestational age was 8.4±2.71 months. All but 1 subject in the teduglutide arm and 2 
subjects in the SOC arm were male. All subjects were white except 1 subject in each treatment arm 
who were Asian; no subjects were Hispanic or Latino.  
The mean baseline weight, length, and weight/length ratio Z-scores for the safety set were at 
0.7±1.43, 0.2±1.64, and 0.7±1.12, respectively, and similar between the 2 treatment arms. One 
subject in the teduglutide arm had baseline weight and weight/length ratio Z-scores of 3.7 and 2.4, 
respectively, and 1subject in the SOC arm had baseline weight and weight/length ratio Z scores of 2.8 
and 2.2, respectively. 
Short bowel history is presented in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 10.4.3.1. The main underlying causes of 
SBS were gastroschisis and necrotizing enterocolitis. One subject in the SOC arm had a colostomy. All 
subjects had at least some remaining colon and the mean percent of remaining colon was 65.6±23.37 
overall; the remnant colon was in continuity in 9 (90.0%) subjects and 1 subject in the teduglutide 
arm had an ileocecal valve present. 
Efficacy Results 
Efficacy/PD analyses of PS and enteral nutrition (EN) data were based on weight-normalized PS/EN 
volume and caloric intake. All efficacy data were presented for the intent-to-treat (ITT) set unless 
otherwise specified. 
Analyses of weekly PS and EN were based on 2 data sources: the subject diary data (also referred to 
as actual data) and the investigator prescribed data. In previous studies of teduglutide, the subject 
diary data were considered a more representative measure of efficacy/PD than the investigator 
prescribed data. However, several subjects in this study had missing or lost diary data at baseline or 
EOT. Due to limitations in diary data, both data are presented. 
Reduction in PS Volume 
The reduction in PS volume at EOT and by visit based on subject diary and prescribed data are 
presented for the ITT set in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 11.1.1.1 and Section 11.1.1.2, respectively. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction in weight-normalized PS volume of at least 20% at 
Week 24/EOT from baseline. Based on subject diary data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the 
teduglutide treatment arm and 1 (20.0%) subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction 
in PS volume at EOT from baseline (2 subjects in the SOC arm had missing data). Based on prescribed 
data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in each treatment arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS 
volume at EOT from baseline.

7.3.  Discussion 
SHP633-301 was a randomized, open-label study consisting of a 2- to 4-week screening period, a 24 
week treatment period, and 4-week follow-up period. 
The main underlying causes of SBS were gastroschisis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Efficacy/PD 
analyses of PS and enteral nutrition (EN) data were based on weight-normalized PS/EN volume and 
caloric intake. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction in weight-normalized PS volume of at least 20% at 
Week 24/EOT from baseline. Based on subject diary data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the 
teduglutide treatment arm and 1 (20.0%) subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction 
in PS volume at EOT from baseline (2 subjects in the SOC arm had missing data). Based on prescribed 
data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in each treatment arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS 
volume at EOT from baseline. 
Based on subject diary data, 3 (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the teduglutide treatment arm and 1 
(20.0%) subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS caloric intake at EOT from 
baseline (2 subjects in the SOC arm had missing data). Based on prescribed data, 3 (60.0%) subjects 
enrolled in each treatment arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS caloric intake at EOT from 
baseline. 
In the TED arm, the mean change in PS caloric intake at EOT from baseline was -16.1±17.55 
kcal/kg/day, corresponding to a mean percentage change of -27.0±29.47%. In the SOC arm, the 
mean change in PS caloric intake at EOT from baseline was -6.1±10.39 kcal/kg/day, corresponding to 
a mean percentage change of -13.7±21.87%. 
The MAH is asked to discuss the clinical relevance of the presented results for “Reduction in PS Caloric 
Intake” (OC). 
No subject achieved enteral autonomy 
Based on subject diary data, 2 (40.0%) subjects enrolled in the teduglutide treatment arm and no 
subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% increase in EN volume at EOT from baseline 
(3 subjects in each treatment arm had missing data).  
In the TED arm, the mean change in EN volume at EOT from baseline was 16.1±18.68 mL/kg/day, 
corresponding to a mean percentage change of 273.2±246.78%. In the SOC arm the mean change in 
EN volume at EOT from baseline was -15.3±31.50 mL/kg/day, corresponding to a mean percentage 
change of -44.3±78.85%. 
Based on prescribed data, the mean (±SD) EN volume at baseline was 7.8±15.63 mL/kg/day for 
subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm. The mean change in EN volume at EOT from baseline 
was -1.3±2.56 mL/kg/day, corresponding to a mean percentage change of -16.4 (-)%. The mean EN 
volume at baseline was 31.9±19.89 mL/kg/day for subjects in the SOC arm. The mean change in EN 
volume at EOT from baseline was 2.3±22.23 mL/kg/day, corresponding to a mean percentage change 
of 14.8±69.83%.

7.4.  Safety 
The MAH proposes to update the Summary of Clinical Safety with the results of pediatric investigation 
plan (PIP) SHP633-301 (PIP Study 8), a study to evaluate the safety, efficacy/PD, and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of teduglutide in infants 4 to 12 months of age with SBS who are dependent on 
parenteral support (PS). 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Description of all Clinical Studies and Narratives of Safety Studies 
SHP633-301 was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, consisting of 2- to 4-week screening period, a 
24-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period. At the baseline visit (Week 0), subjects 
were randomized (1:1 ratio) to the teduglutide or standard of care (SOC) treatment arm. 
Randomization was stratified according to the presence of a small bowel ostomy (eg, end jejunostomy 
or ileostomy). Subjects had to be receiving at least 50% of fluid or calories parenterally and have 
stable PS requirements for at least 1 month prior to screening and weigh at least 5 kg with a 
weight-for-length Z-score greater than -2 at screening and baseline.  
During the 24-week treatment period, subjects in the SOC arm received standard medical therapy for 
SBS; while those in the teduglutide arm received 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous once daily in addition to 
Assessment report  
EMA/717241/2021  
Page 40/65 
 
 
 
standard medical therapy. Subjects in both arms followed the same visit schedule and assessments. 
Subjects were monitored weekly with phone or clinic visits. Clinic visits occurred at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 
12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. At all site visits and telephone contacts, safety was monitored and nutritional 
support was reviewed and adjusted as needed.  
At the end of the treatment period (Week 24/EOT), all subjects entered a 4-week follow-up period until 
the end of study (Week 28/EOS) during which time subjects received standard medical therapy, but no 
investigational product was administered. At EOS, subjects may have enrolled in the SHP633-304 
extension study, in which subjects would continue to receive teduglutide. The follow-up period for 
subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm may have been truncated, and the subjects may have 
proceeded immediately to the EOS visit if at least 1 of the "escape" criteria was met. Refer to SHP633-
301 clinical study report (CSR), Section 9.1 for additional details.  
Changes to the study procedures may have been implemented for study participants or study sites that 
were impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that required physical distancing and 
may have resulted in subjects missing their visits. Procedural changes implemented in Study SHP633-
301 due to the COVID-19 pandemic are presented in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 9.8.1.3. Protocol 
deviations related to the COVID-19 pandemic impact are provided in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 10.2.2.

Results 
Overall Extent of Exposure 
The safety set (SAF) consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of teduglutide and had at 
least 1 post-baseline safety assessment (teduglutide arm) and of all subjects who had at least 1 post-
baseline safety assessment (SOC arm). A total of 10 subjects were randomized in the study, 5 subjects 
in teduglutide arm and 5 in the SOC arm. The mean duration of exposure to teduglutide in the SAF was 
149.4±42.15 days (range 74 days to 169 days). Four subjects had ≥24 weeks (168 days) of treatment 
and 1 subject had 4 weeks to <12 weeks (28 days to <84 days) of treatment.

Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
Demographic and other characteristics of the study population are presented in SHP633-301 CSR. 
All but 1 subject in the teduglutide arm and 2 subjects in the SOC arm were male. All subjects were 
white except 1 subject in each treatment arm who were Asian; no subjects were Hispanic or Latino. 
The corrected gestational age of subjects was similar between the 2 treatment arms. Overall, the 
mean corrected gestational age was 8.4±2.71 months, with the majority (7/10 [70.0%]) of subjects 
being in the 6 months to 12 months corrected gestational age category. Mean baseline weight, length, 
and weight/length ratio Z-scores were similar between the 2 treatment arms. 
Short bowel history is presented in SHP633-301 CSR. The main underlying causes of SBS were 
gastroschisis (3 and 2 subjects in the teduglutide and SOC treatment arms, respectively), necrotizing 
enterocolitis (1 and 2 subjects in the teduglutide and SOC treatment arms, respectively), intestinal 
atresia (1 subject in the teduglutide treatment arm), and other (1 subject in the SOC arm). One 
subject in the SOC arm had a stoma. All subjects had some colon remaining, and the mean remaining 
small intestine was 29.2±25.10 cm overall; the remnant colon was in continuity in 9 (90.0%) subjects, 
and 1 subject in the teduglutide arm had an ileocecal valve present.

Adverse events are summarized for the SAF set in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 12.2. Adverse events 
were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) central coding dictionary, 
Version 21.0. 
Brief Summary of Adverse Events 
Overall, there were a total of 87 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 10 (100%) 
subjects. The TEAEs reported by subjects during the study were mostly mild in severity and deemed 
not related to study drug by the investigators. There were 9 TEAEs deemed related to study drug by 
the investigators in 2 (40.0%) subjects in the teduglutide arm. There were 5 treatment-emergent 
serious adverse events (TESAEs) in 4 (80.0%) subjects in the teduglutide arm and 6 TESAEs in 3 
(60.0%) subjects in the SOC arm; no TESAEs were deemed related to study drug by the investigators.  
There were 5 TEAEs reported in 1 subject enrolled in the teduglutide arm which led to treatment 
discontinuation. There were no AESIs and TEAEs leading to death.

TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event; n=number of subjects experiencing the event; m=number of events 
Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as any adverse event on or after the first dose for the subjects teduglutide 
treatment arm, and on or after the randomization date for the subjects in standard of care treatment arm. Adverse events with an 
unknown date of onset and a stop date after the start of the date of first dose or unknown are included as TEAEs. 
Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the population in each treatment group. 
Subjects were counted by the treatment most recently taken when the event occurred. 
Subjects are counted no more than once for incidence, but can be counted multiple times for the number of events. 
SOCs and PTs were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 21.0. 
Note: 
Source: SHP633-301 CSR Table 14.3.1.2 
Adverse Events by Relationship 
Overall, 9 TEAEs reported in 2 (20.0%) subjects were deemed related to study drug by the 
investigators; both subjects were enrolled in the teduglutide arm. Details of these TEAEs are provided 
in SHP633-301 CSR. 
One subject experienced 8 of the 9 TEAEs assessed as related to study drug (abdominal distension, 
gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, vomiting [5 events], and faecal volume increased) as well as 
multiple non-related TEAEs all linked to the gastrointestinal system. These related TEAEs resolved and 
were deemed intermittent, mild to moderate in severity by the investigator; the events of vomiting (2 
events), gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, and faecal volume increased led the subject’s parents 
decision (it was not the investigator’s decision in the interest of safety) to interrupt dosing with study 
drug which never resumed.

One subject experienced a TEAE of ALT increased (152 U/L; normal range 6-34 U/L) at Week 20 which 
was deemed related to study drug by the investigator The subject showed elevated AST and ALT 
values at baseline (224 U/L and 243 U/L, respectively) and intermittently during the study including 
the last study visit at Week 24 (94 U/L and 88 U/L, respectively). Two events of ALT increased were 
reported for this subject; only the second event was deemed related to study drug. That TEAE was 
deemed moderate in severity, resolved at Week 24, and no action with study drug was taken. The 
subject’s bilirubin values remained normal throughout the study (Section 0). 
Adverse Events by Severity 
Details of TEAEs by severity are provided in SHP633-301 CSR, Section 12.2.3.2.  
The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity. There were 3 severe TEAEs were reported during the 
study, 1 event in a subject in the teduglutide treatment arm (device leakage [related to central venous 
catheters used to administer PS, not to the teduglutide injection device]) and 1 event in 2 subjects in 
the SOC arm (device related infection). All severe TEAEs were assessed as serious due to the subjects' 
hospitalization and not related to study drug by the investigator (Section 0). 
Deaths 
There were no deaths during the study. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Overall, 11 TESAEs were reported in 7 subjects, 4 (80.0%) subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm 
and 3 (60.0%) subjects in the SOC arm. All TESAEs were assessed as non-related to teduglutide 
treatment by the investigators. 
For the teduglutide arm, the system organ classes with subjects reporting TESAEs were Product issues 
(2 [40.0%] subjects), and General disorders and administration site conditions and Immune system 
disorder (1 [20.0%] subject each. A total of 5 TESAEs were reported in the teduglutide arm: 1 subject 
experienced 2 events of pyrexia, 1 subject experienced the event of immunisation reaction, 1 subject 
experienced the event of device breakage and another subject the event of device leakage (both 
device events related to central venous catheters used to administer PS, not to the teduglutide 
injection device). The events of pyrexia preceded by non-serious TEAEs of blocked Hickman line, 
broken Hickman line, and intermittent vomiting, and were reported as serious due to the subject's 
hospitalization. The event of immunisation reaction was described as fever secondary to immunisations 
on result of negative blood cultures. The subject presented with pyrexia and vomiting and required 
hospitalization for sepsis the same day. That same day, the subject was administered intravenous 
antibacterial treatment, and blood was collected from the central line for blood culture, which showed 
no growth at 48 hours.  
For the SOC arm, the system organ classes with subjects reporting TESAEs were Infections and 
infestations (2 [40.0%] subjects), and Investigations, Metabolism and nutrition disorders, Nervous 
system disorders and Product issues (1 [20.0%] subject each). A total of 6 TESAEs were reported in 
the SOC arm: 2 subjects experienced the events of device related infection, 1 subject experienced the 
event of transaminases increased, and 1 subject experienced all the events of metabolic acidosis, 
ataxia, and device occlusion.  
Assessment report

All TESAEs were deemed non-related to teduglutide treatment by the investigators, all required 
hospitalization of the subjects. The TESAEs of device leakage and device related infection were 
reported as severe.  
The mean (±SD) cumulative number of hospitalization days during the treatment period was 4.7±2.89 
and 4.0±1.41 in the teduglutide and SOC arms, respectively.

Other Significant Adverse Events 
Discontinuations Resulting from Adverse Events 
There were 5 TEAEs reported in 1 subject enrolled in the teduglutide arm that led to study drug 
discontinuation (vomiting [2 events], gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, irritability, and faecal volume 
increased). Teduglutide treatment was interrupted at Day 75 (after Week 10 visit) following the 
parents', not the investigator's, decision to interrupt administration as they thought several AEs were 
caused by the study drug; it was not the investigator’s decision in the interest of safety but he was 
informed. The TEAEs of vomiting, gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, and faecal volume increased were 
deemed related to study drug and mild in severity by the investigator (except for 1 event of vomiting 
deemed moderate in severity). The event of irritability was deemed non-related to study drug and mild

in severity by the investigator. All events recovered and resolved. Teduglutide treatment was never 
resumed. SHP633-301 CSR, Section provides a complete narrative for this subject. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
There were no AESIs (events of polyps of the colon, benign neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract, or 
tumor-promoting ability) reported during the study.  
Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Teduglutide was generally well tolerated in infants aged 4 months to 12 months corrected gestational 
age with SBS, and no new safety issues were identified. The safety profile was favorable and 
consistent with the safety profile seen in other pediatric studies, the underlying disease, and previous 
experience with teduglutide in adult subjects with SBS. The benefit-risk profile for teduglutide remains 
favorable and unchanged. 
Narratives 
Narratives for subjects who experienced an SAE during the study are provided in SHP633-301 CSR, 
Section.

Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Laboratory Values Over Time 
Overall, no clinically meaningful mean changes in hematology values or urinalysis values were 
observed during the study. There were no clinically meaningful changes in serum chemistry values 
during the study other than increased ALT (1 subject in the teduglutide treatment arm) and both 
increased ALT and increased transaminases (each in 1 subject in the SOC arm). Liver enzyme 
parameters (alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, direct bilirubin, bilirubin, and GGT) over time are 
presented graphically by visit in the SHP633-301 CSR. 
Individual Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Laboratory Values 
No clinically significant abnormal values for hematology were reported during the study (SHP633-301 
CSR. For individually clinically significant chemistry laboratory abnormalities, a markedly increased ALT 
value >8 x ULN was noted in 1 subject in the SOC arm. The subject had several elevated (higher than 
the normal range [6-34 U/L]) ALT values, with a markedly increased ALT value (101 U/L, >8 x upper 
limit of normal) at Week 16. The subject also had elevated AST (normal range 10-56 U/L) and GGT 
(normal range 0-24 U/L) values at both Week 12 and Week 16. The subject’s bilirubin values remained 
mostly low or normal throughout the study; C-reactive protein values were elevated on 2 unscheduled 
visits at Week 12 and Week 21). No adverse events were reported for any of these elevated laboratory 
values. 
A markedly high international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5 value was noted in 1 subject in each 
treatment arm. The subject in the teduglutide arm had a markedly high INR value (2.4) at the baseline 
visit; the INR decreased to 1.1 at EOS (Week 28); this subject had ongoing prophylactic heparin 
treatment when receiving intravenous nutrition. The subject in the SOC arm, who presented a stable 
INR between 1.0 and 1.2 during the study, experienced a single elevated INR at 2.0 at the Week 16 
visit, which was accompanied by an elevated prothrombin time (20.5 seconds [normal range of 9.7-
12.3 seconds]). No adverse events were reported for these elevated values.

Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations 
Related to Safety 
Vital Signs  
Overall, no clinically meaningful changes were observed in vital signs (pulse rate, systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or temperature other than increased ALT and increased 
transaminases values each in 1 subject in the SOC arm and increased ALT in 1 subject in the 
teduglutide treatment arm.  
Body Weight, Length, Weight/Length Ratio, and Head Circumference Z-score 
Changes in body weight, length, and weight/length ratio Z-scores were within the expected range for 
the subjects' age group and comparable between the teduglutide treatment arm and the SOC arm. 
Head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm seemed to drop further over time compared 
with the teduglutide treatment arm.  
Fecal and Urine Outputs 
No clinically meaningful changes in mean urine output or stool output were observed in either the 
teduglutide or SOC arm. In the teduglutide arm, the mean average number of stools per day at Week 
24 was 2.3±1.44 stools/day from a baseline of 5.2±2.23 stools/day, corresponding to a change 
of -3.3±3.55 stools/day. In the SOC arm, the mean average number of stools per day at Week 24 was 
5.2±1.04 stools/day from a baseline of 2.5±1.66 stools/day, corresponding to a change of 1.7±1.76 
stools/day. 
Antibodies to Teduglutide 
None of the 3 subjects in the teduglutide arm who were tested at the Week 12 and Week 28 (EOS) 
visits had antibodies to teduglutide detected (SHP633-301 CSR, Section 12.5.3.4). 
Assessor´s comments 
Overall, there were a total of 87 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 10 (100%) 
subjects. The TEAEs reported by subjects during the study were mostly mild in severity and deemed 
not related to study drug by the investigators. There were 9 TEAEs deemed related to study drug by 
the investigators in 2 (40.0%) subjects in the teduglutide arm. There were 5 treatment-emergent 
serious adverse events (TESAEs) in 4 (80.0%) subjects in the teduglutide arm and 6 TESAEs in 3 
(60.0%) subjects in the SOC arm; no TESAEs were deemed related to study drug by the investigators.  
There were 5 TEAEs reported in 1 subject enrolled in the teduglutide arm which led to treatment 
discontinuation. There were no AESIs and TEAEs leading to death.  
Overall, 9 TEAEs reported in 2 (20.0%) subjects were deemed related to study drug by the 
investigators; both subjects were enrolled in the teduglutide arm. Details of these TEAEs are provided 
in SHP633-301 CSR. 
One subject experienced 8 of the 9 TEAEs assessed as related to study drug (abdominal distension, 
gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, vomiting [5 events], and faecal volume increased) as well as

multiple non-related TEAEs all linked to the gastrointestinal system. These related TEAEs resolved and 
were deemed intermittent, mild to moderate in severity by the investigator; the events led the 
subject’s parents decision to interrupt dosing with study drug which never resumed.  
One subject experienced a TEAE of ALT increased (152 U/L; normal range 6-34 U/L) at Week 20 which 
was deemed related to study drug by the investigator. The subject showed elevated AST and ALT 
values at baseline (224 U/L and 243 U/L, respectively) and intermittently during the study including 
the last study visit at Week 24 (94 U/L and 88 U/L, respectively). Two events of ALT increased were 
reported for this subject; only the second event was deemed related to study drug. That TEAE was 
deemed moderate in severity, resolved at Week 24, and no action with study drug was taken. The 
subject’s bilirubin values remained normal throughout the study. 
The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity. There were 3 severe TEAEs were reported during the 
study, 1 event in a subject in the teduglutide treatment arm (device leakage [related to central venous 
catheters used to administer PS, not to the teduglutide injection device]) and 1 event in 2 subjects in 
the SOC arm (device related infection). 
Overall, 11 TESAEs were reported in 7 subjects, 4 (80.0%) subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm 
and 3 (60.0%) subjects in the SOC arm. All TESAEs were assessed as non-related to teduglutide 
treatment by the investigators. 
There were no AESIs (events of polyps of the colon, benign neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract, or 
tumor-promoting ability) reported during the study. 
Changes in body weight, length, and weight/length ratio Z-scores were within the expected range for 
the subjects' age group and comparable between the teduglutide treatment arm and the SOC arm. 
Head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm seemed to drop further over time compared 
with the teduglutide treatment arm. The MAH should discuss the drop in head circumference Z-scores 
observed in the SOC arm as compared to the TED arm (OC).

Discussion 
At the end of the treatment period (Study SHP633-301, week 24/EOT), all subjects entered a 4-week 
follow-up period until the end of study (Week 28/EOS) during which time subjects received standard 
medical therapy, but no investigational product was administered. At EOS, subjects may have enrolled 
in the SHP633-304 extension study, in which subjects would continue to receive teduglutide. The 
follow-up period for subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm may have been truncated, and the 
subjects may have proceeded immediately to the EOS visit if at least 1 of the "escape" criteria was 
met. 
A total of 10 subjects were randomized in the study, 5 subjects in teduglutide arm and 5 in the SOC 
arm. The mean duration of exposure to teduglutide in the SAF was 149.4±42.15 days (range 74 days 
to 169 days). Four subjects had ≥24 weeks (168 days) of treatment and 1 subject had 4 weeks to <12 
weeks (28 days to <84 days) of treatment.   
All but 1 subject in the teduglutide arm and 2 subjects in the SOC arm were male. All subjects were 
white except 1 subject in each treatment arm who were Asian; no subjects were Hispanic or Latino. 
The corrected gestational age of subjects was similar between the 2 treatment arms. 
The main underlying causes of SBS were gastroschisis and necrotizing enterocolitis. 
Overall, there were a total of 87 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in 10 (100%) 
subjects. The TEAEs reported by subjects during the study were mostly mild in severity and deemed 
not related to study drug by the investigators. There were 9 TEAEs deemed related to study drug by 
the investigators in 2 (40.0%) subjects in the teduglutide arm. There were 5 treatment-emergent 
serious adverse events (TESAEs) in 4 (80.0%) subjects in the teduglutide arm and 6 TESAEs in 3 
(60.0%) subjects in the SOC arm; no TESAEs were deemed related to study drug by the investigators.  
There were 5 TEAEs reported in 1 subject enrolled in the teduglutide arm which led to treatment 
discontinuation. There were no AESIs and TEAEs leading to death.  
Overall, 9 TEAEs reported in 2 (20.0%) subjects were deemed related to study drug by the 
investigators; both subjects were enrolled in the teduglutide arm. Details of these TEAEs are provided 
in SHP633-301 CSR. 
One subject experienced 8 of the 9 TEAEs assessed as related to study drug (abdominal distension, 
gastrointestinal sounds abnormal, vomiting [5 events], and faecal volume increased) as well as 
multiple non-related TEAEs all linked to the gastrointestinal system. These related TEAEs resolved and 
were deemed intermittent, mild to moderate in severity by the investigator; the events led the 
subject’s parents decision to interrupt dosing with study drug which never resumed.

One subject experienced a TEAE of ALT increased (152 U/L; normal range 6-34 U/L) at Week 20 which 
was deemed related to study drug by the investigator. The subject showed elevated AST and ALT 
values at baseline (224 U/L and 243 U/L, respectively) and intermittently during the study including 
the last study visit at Week 24 (94 U/L and 88 U/L, respectively). Two events of ALT increased were 
reported for this subject; only the second event was deemed related to study drug. That TEAE was 
deemed moderate in severity, resolved at Week 24, and no action with study drug was taken. The 
subject’s bilirubin values remained normal throughout the study. 
The majority of TEAEs were mild in severity. There were 3 severe TEAEs were reported during the 
study, 1 event in a subject in the teduglutide treatment arm (device leakage [related to central venous 
catheters used to administer PS, not to the teduglutide injection device]) and 1 event in 2 subjects in 
the SOC arm (device related infection). 
Overall, 11 TESAEs were reported in 7 subjects, 4 (80.0%) subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm 
and 3 (60.0%) subjects in the SOC arm. All TESAEs were assessed as non-related to teduglutide 
treatment by the investigators. 
There were no AESIs (events of polyps of the colon, benign neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract, or 
tumor-promoting ability) reported during the study. 
Changes in body weight, length, and weight/length ratio Z-scores were within the expected range for 
the subjects' age group and comparable between the teduglutide treatment arm and the SOC arm. 
Head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm seemed to drop further over time compared 
with the teduglutide treatment arm. The MAH should discuss the drop in head circumference Z-scores 
observed in the SOC arm as compared to the TED arm (OC).

Question 1  
The MAH is asked to present the number of plasma samples collected and used for analysis in study 
SHP633-301 
MAH’s response 
Per protocol of study SHP633-301, subjects had blood samples taken for teduglutide PK analysis at 
predose, 1 hour ±10 minutes, and 4 hours ±10 minutes postdose at baseline (Visit 0, baseline visit). 
The predose sample was not collected from subjects who weighed less than 7 kg. Some subjects also 
had blood samples taken for teduglutide PK analysis at 2 hours ±10 minutes postdose at Week 7 (Visit 
7) of the treatment period. By definition, the PK set consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 
dose of teduglutide and had at least 1 evaluable and interpretable postdose PK concentration value. 
Therefore, the PK set consisted of 5 subjects with a total of 19 PK samples collected via a sparse 
sample collection approach. 
Table 1 presents the PK sample concentration results from 5 subjects receiving teduglutide treatment. 
Since time-independent PK properties of teduglutide were confirmed during drug development, sparse 
PK sample collections are considered adequate for evaluation of PK in infant subjects. All of the 
aforementioned PK concentrations were presented in the CSR for Study SHP633-301, Table 19 for PK 
evaluation. The sparse samples were also included in the population PK analysis to characterize PK 
properties in pediatric subjects less than 1 year of age, confirming the Cmax similarity across age 
groups, and thereby supporting 0.05 mg daily dosing in pediatric subjects who are 4 months to less 
than 1 year of age (refer to Table 12.1, SHIR-CSC-129_PKglobal).

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has presented the number of plasma samples collected and used for analysis in study 
SHP633-301 as requested. The MAH states that the PK set consisted of 5 subjects with a total of 19 PK 
samples collected via a sparse sample collection approach. The sparse samples were included in the 
population PK analysis to characterize PK properties in pediatric subjects less than 1 year of age. The 
MAH states that Cmax similarity was observed across age groups supporting 0.05 mg daily dosing in 
pediatric subjects who are 4 months to less than 1 year of age.  
In the SmPC section 5.2 the MAH is asked to delete “which drives the efficacy” to keep data factual for 
the prescriber: 
“Paediatric population 
Following subcutaneous administration, similar Cmax of teduglutide across age groups (4 months to 17 
years) was demonstrated by population pharmacokinetics modelling. which drives the efficacy 
responses. However, lower exposure (AUC) and shorter halflife were seen in paediatric patients 4 
months to 17 years of age, as compared with adults. The pharmacokinetic profile of Revestive in this 
paediatric population, as evaluated by clearance and volume of distribution, was different from that 
observed in adults after correcting for body weights. Specifically, clearance decreases with increasing 
age from 4 months to adults. No data are available for paediatric patients with moderate to severe 
renal impairment and endstage renal disease (ESRD).” 
Please also refer to SmPC section 5.2.

Question 2  
The MAH is asked to discuss the clinical significance of the presented exposure-safety results in 
regards of nausea and abdominal pain, which should include instructions for prescribing physician e.g. 
dose adjustments. The MAH should also explain the discrepancy between the results of the 
probabilities of nausea and vomiting, since these TEAS are normally closely related 
MAH’s response 
Clinical Significance for Nausea and Abdominal Pain 
The exposure-safety analysis results showed a statistically significant relationship between steady state 
teduglutide exposure Cmax or AUC versus nausea or abdominal pain (refer to SHIR-CSC-129_ERglobal). 
The results suggested that increased teduglutide exposure was associated with an increased probability 
of nausea or abdominal pain. In the analyses (using Cmax as an example), 234 subjects who received 
either placebo, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 or 0.1 mg/kg daily doses were included in the datasets, which 
were split into placebo and 4 quartiles, based on exposure, with N of 35, 50, 49, 50, and 50, 
respectively. 
The distributions of Cmax across quartiles are presented in Table 2, which shows that approximately 
83% of Cmax values in Q4 quartiles were observed for the 0.10 mg/kg dose regimen. Conversely, 
Assessment report  
EMA/717241/2021  
Page 58/65 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 70% of the Cmax values in the 2nd or 3rd quartiles were observed for the 0.05 mg/kg 
dose regimen. Figure 15 (Cmax versus nausea) and Figure 16 (Cmax versus abdominal pain) of SHIR-
CSC-129_ERglobal show that a total of 15 and 19 respective subjects had exposures that were within 
the exposure distribution range of Q4 quartiles, respectively. The majority of these subjects received 
0.1 mg/kg daily treatment with teduglutide. Overall, the above results suggest that Cmax values in the 
Q4 quartiles, which were mainly observed for the 0.10 mg/kg regimen, were associated with a higher 
probability of nausea or abdominal pain. Since a 0.05 mg/kg daily dose only provides a small 
percentage of subjects with potential exposure in the Q4 quartiles, no dose adjustment is 
recommended based on these evaluations. Nausea and abdominal pain are both listed in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC), Section 4.8 as very common adverse reactions of teduglutide and 
the SmPC, Section 4.2 instructs prescribers that efficacy and safety in all patients should be closely 
monitored on an ongoing basis according to clinical treatment guidelines. The MAH therefore concludes 
that no further update to the SmPC is currently warranted. 
Table 2 
Distribution of Teduglutide Cmax Across Quartiles and Doses 
Datasets for Nausea and Vomiting 
The exposure-safety results showed a statistically significant relationship between steady state 
teduglutide exposure Cmax or AUC versus nausea, but not versus vomiting (refer to SHIR-CSC-
129_ERglobal). The MAH agrees that the TEAEs of nausea and vomiting are usually closely related. 
However, a review of the SBS datasets reveals the following: 
•  Among 50 subjects of the Q4 quartiles, 8 subjects had vomiting (SHIR-CSC-129_ERglobal, 
Figure 5) and 15 subjects had nausea (SHIR-CSC-129_ERglobal, Figure 16). 
•  Among the 8 subjects with vomiting, 1 subject had vomiting only, and 7 subjects had both 
nausea and vomiting. 
•  Among the 15 subjects with nausea, 8 subjects had nausea only and 7 subjects had both 
nausea and vomiting. 
Based on the findings above, the majority of vomiting subjects did have nausea concurrently, 
suggesting the subjects having both vomiting and nausea were part of the nausea group and had more 
severe symptoms. The majority of nausea subjects did not have vomiting, suggesting the two datasets 
are not greatly overlapping. The 15/50 nausea subjects in the Q4 quartile roughly doubles the number 
of vomiting subjects (8/50), which makes the exposure-safety curve for nausea go up significantly (p-
value = 0.0164) and drives the difference in the exposure-safety relationships between exposure-
nausea and exposure-vomiting. These evaluations are expected to represent the true exposure-safety 
relationships, given the significant size of the datasets obtained in the SBS populations.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH agrees that the TEAEs of nausea and vomiting are closely related as the majority of vomiting 
subjects did have nausea concurrently. Furthermore, the MAH clarifies that 15/50 nausea subjects in 
the Q4 quartile roughly doubles the number of vomiting subjects (8/50), which makes the exposure-
safety curve for nausea go up significantly (p-value = 0.0164) and drives the difference in the 
exposure-safety relationships between exposure-nausea and exposure-vomiting. In addition, the 
SmPC, Section 4.2 instructs prescribers that efficacy and safety in all patients should be closely 
monitored on an ongoing basis according to clinical treatment guidelines. The MAH therefore concludes 
that no further update to the SmPC is currently warranted. This is accepted. But the MAH is asked to 
move the sentence in section 4.8 to section 5.1 and a minor modification is requested. Please also 
refer to SmPC.

Question 3  
The MAH is asked to discuss the clinical relevance of the presented results for reduction or change in: 
a)  PS Caloric Intake 
b)  EN volume 
c)  daily PS usage 
MAH’s response 
Parenteral support (PS)–dependent children with short bowel syndrome–associated intestinal failure 
(SBS-IF) have a high disease burden. Long-term administration of parenteral support (PS = parenteral 
nutrition and/or intravenous fluids) is life-saving but is often associated with potentially life-threatening 
complications, including IF associated liver disease, central line-associated blood stream infections, and 
central venous thrombosis. Therefore, accelerating the adaptive process and achieving enteral 
autonomy is a clinically relevant and urgent goal for all patients with SBS who are dependent on PS 
(Khan et al., 2015; Squires et al., 2012). Clinical parameters that would usually change in association 
with weaning-off of parenteral support include decreased PS caloric intake, increased EN volume/EN 
caloric intake, and a decrease in hours/day of PS. 
a) PS Caloric Intake 
In Study SHP633-301, the observed changes in PS caloric intake are always reflective of the observed 
changes in PS volume given the stable concentration of PS. Further, the subject diary data for PS 
volume are generally considered a more representative measure of efficacy/PD than the investigator 
prescribed data, since those data reflect the actual volume of PS taken by the subject. Therefore, the 
diary data results are discussed below (prescribed data are located in the CSR for Study SHP633-301, 
Section 11.1.1.2). 
A clinically meaningful reduction in weight-normalized PS caloric intake is a reduction of at least 20% 
at Week 24/EOT. Three (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the teduglutide treatment arm and 1 (20.0%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/717241/2021  
Page 60/65 
 
 
 
 
 
subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS caloric intake at EOT from baseline (2 
subjects in the SOC arm had missing diary data at baseline). 
This translates to an average difference of -16.1 kcal/kg/day (-27.0%) caloric intake per day at EOT 
from a baseline mean caloric intake of 67.3 kcal/kg/day for the teduglutide treatment arm, versus an 
average difference of -6.1 kcal/g/day (-13.7%) at EOT from a baseline mean caloric intake of 65.1 
kcal/kg/day for the SOC arm. 
Overall, the results from the subject diary data showed a relatively higher number of subjects 
achieving clinically meaningful reductions in PS calories and a higher percentage of the average 
reductions in PS calories within the teduglutide arm than the SOC arm (CSR for Study SHP633-301, 
Section 11.1.1.2). 
b) Change From Baseline in EN Volume 
The effect of PS volume reduction can also be seen in an increase in enteral feeds. Consistent with the 
earlier 24-week Phase 3 study in 50 pediatric subjects with SBS (TED-C14-006 study results) and the 
12-week open label study in 46 pediatric subjects (TED-C13-003), Study SHP633-301 has shown that 
teduglutide treatment resulted in increases in EN volume and EN caloric intake. A clinically meaningful 
increase in EN volume and EN caloric intake is an increase of at least 20% from baseline. EN volume 
changes do not necessarily correspond to proportionate PS volume changes because other factors (ie, 
nutritional deficiencies, fluid or electrolyte disequilibrium, etc) would also affect enteral feeding 
(Vanderhoof and Matya, 1999). 
The subject diary data showed that 2 subjects (40%) in the teduglutide arm had a 20% increase from 
baseline in EN volume and EN caloric intake at EOT versus no subjects in the SOC arm. 
c) Daily PS Usage 
Nutrition plays an important role in the management of short bowel syndrome. The institution of early 
and aggressive enteral therapy is the most important stimulus for intestinal adaptation and the 
eventual discontinuation of parenteral therapy. A decrease in daily PS usage indicates less dependence 
on parenteral therapy. 
In the teduglutide arm, the mean reduction of time required for daily PS was -3.1 hours (-28.9%) at 
EOT from a baseline of 11.2 hours. In the SOC arm, the mean change was -0.3 hours (-1.9%) from a 
baseline of 13.0 hours. 
Enhancing intestinal adaptation minimizes dependence on PS, thereby reducing the risk of 
complications and potentially improving quality of life. Beyond potentially decreasing the occurrence of 
PS comorbidities, more time off PS may lead to more opportunities to normalize daily function for both 
subjects and their parents, thereby offering further opportunities to continue working on oral 
rehabilitation during off PN/IV hours (Blüthner et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020). 
Consistent with prior studies, long term administration of teduglutide was temporally associated with 
significant reductions in PS volumes while the SBS subjects continued to maintain their nutritional 
status. These reductions in PS volume, PS calories and daily PS usage were also associated with 
substantial increases in EN volume and calories. Although enteral autonomy was not achieved in both 
treatment arms of the study, these parameters, collectively, indicate progress towards weaning off 
from parenteral support with long term teduglutide use in these subjects.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has discussed the clinical relevance of the presented results as requested: 
a) PS Caloric Intake 
A clinically meaningful reduction in weight-normalized PS caloric intake is a reduction of at least 20% 
at Week 24/EOT. Three (60.0%) subjects enrolled in the teduglutide treatment arm and 1 (20.0%) 
subject in the SOC arm experienced at least 20% reduction in PS caloric intake at EOT from baseline (2 
subjects in the SOC arm had missing diary data at baseline). This translates to an average difference 
of -16.1 kcal/kg/day (-27.0%) caloric intake per day at EOT from a baseline mean caloric intake of 
67.3 kcal/kg/day for the teduglutide treatment arm, versus an average difference of -6.1 kcal/g/day (-
13.7%) at EOT from a baseline mean caloric intake of 65.1 kcal/kg/day for the SOC arm. 
b) Change From Baseline in EN Volume 
A clinically meaningful increase in EN volume and EN caloric intake is an increase of at least 20% from 
baseline. EN volume changes do not necessarily correspond to proportionate PS volume changes 
because other factors (i.e., nutritional deficiencies, fluid or electrolyte disequilibrium, etc). The subject 
diary data showed that 2 subjects (40%) in the teduglutide arm had a 20% increase from baseline in 
EN volume and EN caloric intake at EOT versus no subjects in the SOC arm. 
c) Daily PS Usage 
A decrease in daily PS usage indicates less dependence on parenteral therapy. In the teduglutide arm, 
the mean reduction of time required for daily PS was -3.1 hours (-28.9%) at EOT from a baseline of 
11.2 hours. In the SOC arm, the mean change was -0.3 hours (-1.9%) from a baseline of 13.0 hours.

No need to update overall conclusion and impact on benefit-risk balance  
Question 4  
Head circumference Z-scores observed in the SOC arm seemed to drop further over time compared 
with the teduglutide treatment arm. The MAH should discuss the drop in head circumference Z-scores 
observed in the SOC arm as compared to the TED arm. 
MAH’s response 
The head circumference z-score is a standardized measure with the adjustment for the median values 
among the normal population at the same age, according to the World Health Organization z-score 
calculation charts. A drop in the head circumference z-scores over time may be interpreted to mean 
that subjects in the SOC arm are delayed in their head circumference development when compared to 
the median growth reference standards per the WHO definition.  
Additionally, Table 3 shows that while one subject had a slight increase in head circumference over 
time, subject’s head circumference z-scores decreased concurrently, which drove the mean values by 
visit in the SOC arm to the lower end. Further, this subject was the only subject with recorded head 
circumference z-scores, -2.44 and -2.44 for the Week 24 and EOT/ET study visits, respectively.

12.  Assessment of the responses to the request for 
supplementary information 
Question  
The MAH is asked to update the SmPC in line with the comments made in the appended PI. 
MAH’s response 
The MAH took into consideration the latest comments for the PI, shared along with the Updated CHMP 
Rapporteur Assessment Report, dated 12 Oct 2021 and would like to propose one related change. 
- Section 4.8 of the SmPC 
The MAH agrees with the minor modification to remove the statement “Teduglutide was well tolerated 
in these infant subjects.”. However, the MAH would respectfully ask if it would be possible to keep the 
proposed statement in 4.8, as initially submitted, instead of moving it to section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
We are of the opinion that this statement would be more suitable in the section 4.8, rather than 
section 5.1, as it refers to the reported adverse events: “Adverse events reported in the study were 
consistent with the safety profile seen in the previous paediatric studies and no new safety issues were 
identified.”. 
Also, we would like to note that section 5.1 of the SmPC has already been updated with the relevant 
information related to this study: “A 24¬-week, randomized, open-label, multicentre study was 
conducted in 10 infant patients 4 to 12 months of age with SBS dependent on parenteral support. The 
objective was to evaluate safety, efficacy/pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of teduglutide. 
Subjects were randomized into 2 groups, standard of care (SOC) arm (n=5) and teduglutide 0.05 
mg/kg/day treatment (TED) arm (n=5).”. The MAH considers that, by moving the statement proposed 
in section 4.8 to the section 5.1, this would result in having some of the information duplicated. 
Based on the above, we would kindly request to reevaluate the proposal to move the statement from 
section 4.8 to section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
- Section 5.2 of the SmPC 
The MAH agrees with the changes suggested for the section 5.2 
An updated PI is included as part of this submission, in line with the MAH`s comments. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has agreed to remove the sentence “Teduglutide was well tolerated in these infant subjects.” 
from section 4.8 in the SmPC but argues to keep the statement in section 4.8. The MAH is of the 
opinion that the statement would be more suitable in section 4.8 and also highlights that section 5.1 
already has been updated with the relevant information regarding this study.  
The assessor accepts the MAH’s explanation and agrees with the proposed wording in section 4.8: 
Assessment report  
EMA/717241/2021  
Page 64/65 
 
 
 
 
 
“In a completed clinical trial in paediatric subjects (aged 4 to 12 months corrected gestational age), a 
total of 10 subjects were randomized, 5 in the teduglutide arm and 5 in the Standard of Care arm, of 
which eight subjects completed the study. Adverse events reported in the study were consistent with 
the safety profile seen in the previous paediatric studies and no new safety issues were identified.”  
Regarding section 5.2 the MAH has amended the section as requested and deleted the sentence 
“Which drives the efficacy responses”.

1.  Introductory comment  
The approved therapeutic indication “Epidyolex is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures 
associated with Lennox Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with 
clobazam, for patients 2 years of age and older” falls within the scope of the two designated orphan 
conditions Lennox Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. The maintenance of the two respective 
orphan designations is covered in this one document.

procedure) 
2.2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion at the designation stage 
The sponsor GW Research Ltd submitted on 27 October 2016 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
cannabidiol for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The 
application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing cannabidiol was 
considered justified based on clinical data demonstrating reduced seizure frequency in patients who 
received the product on top of standard of care; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the high frequency of multiple types of seizures, 
cognitive deterioration, behavioural disturbances, and poor long termlong-term prognosis despite 
existing treatments; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 2 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing cannabidiol will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided clinical data that demonstrate that patients who failed to respond to authorised 
products achieved a reduction of seizure frequency. The Committee considered that this constitutes a 
clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing cannabidiol as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan indication: treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. 
2.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made

Condition 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare epilepsy disorder characterised by the presence of multiple 
seizure types, slow (≤2.5 Hz) spike-waves EEG abnormalities with frequent abnormal background 
activity when awake and a particular EEG pattern of fast rhythms (10–20 Hz) during sleep. The seizure 
types vary among patients: the most invalidating are sudden drop attacks (myoclonic, atonic or 
myoclono-atonic) but can also include focal, tonic, tonic-clonic, atonic, atypical absence, and myoclonic 
seizures. 
In the past, LGS was subdivided into cryptogenic and symptomatic types by the presence or absence 
of an underlying cause. The new classification (Scheffer et al, 2017) has introduced many other 
aetiological categories and this distinction is no more valid.  The etiology of LGS is extensive and 
diverse, varying from congenital to acquired causes. Among these, frequent causes include 
malformations of cortical development, tuberous sclerosis, hereditary metabolic diseases, sequelae of 
hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy and of other perinatal injuries, lesions secondary to inflammatory 
brain diseases such as encephalitis, meningitis and congenital infections as toxoplasmosis and 
cytomegalovirus. About one-third of LGS cases occur without antecedent history or evidence of brain 
pathology and these patients tend to have a better prognosis than those with brain lesions. 
The sponsor acknowledged the release of a revised classification of seizure and epilepsy types in March 
2017, which did not alter the classification of epilepsy syndromes (Scheffer et al, 2017). Therefore, 
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) remains a recognised electroclinical epilepsy syndrome in accordance 
with the 2010 ILAE classification system (Berg et al, 2010). 
The approved therapeutic indication “Epidyolex is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures 
associated with Lennox Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with 
clobazam, for patients 2 years of age and older.” falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
indication “Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome” in combination with the second orphan drug 
designation held by the sponsor for “Treatment of Dravet syndrome”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified (please also see 
Epidyolex EPAR).  
The clinical development program supporting the efficacy of CBD-OS comprises 2 randomised, placebo-
controlled trials in LGS; 1 investigating 10 and 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1414) and 1 investigating 
20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1423). 
The pivotal trials consisted of a 4-week baseline period, followed by a 14-week treatment period 
comprising a 2-week titration (dose escalation) period and a 12-week maintenance (stable dosing) 
period. Patients who discontinued the investigational medicinal product (IMP) were to taper the dose 
over a 10-day period, with a safety follow-up 4 weeks after final dose.  
The primary endpoint was met in both studies with an approximately 40-50% median drop seizures 
frequency in the active groups as compared to approximately 15-25% in the placebo groups: 
Study GWEP1414: A greater median reduction in drop seizure frequency during the treatment period 
was seen in the both the 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (-41.86) and the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (-37.16) 
groups, compared with the placebo group (-17.17). The estimated median difference was in favour of 
CBD-OS treatment over placebo for both 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (-21.57; 95% CI: -34.79, -6.67) and 
10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (-19.19; 95% CI: -31.24, -7.69); the difference between each CBD-OS group 
and placebo was statistically significant (p=0.0047 and p=0.0016, respectively). 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/428872/2019 
Page 6/27 
 
 
 
 
Study GWEP1423: A greater median reduction in drop seizure frequency during the treatment period 
was seen in the CBD-OS group (-43.90), compared with the placebo group (-21.80). The estimated 
median difference was in favour of CBD-OS treatment over placebo (-17.21; 95% CI: -30.32, -4.09), 
and the difference between treatment groups was statistically significant (p=0.0135). 
CBD-OS can cause hepatocellular injury. Across the LGS and DS pivotal trials, two patients 
concomitantly treated with valproate experienced toxic hepatocellular injury in combination with 
metabolic acidosis and encephalopathy, respectively. The incidence of TEAEs meeting the search 
criteria for AESI abnormal liver TEAEs was 14.9% in the All CBD-OS group (N=456) compared with 
3.1% in the placebo group (N=292). However, the number of liver-related adverse events was 
strongly dose-dependent. 
Currently available antiepileptic treatment rarely succeeds in keeping the children free of seizures and 
the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) remains high. In that respect, the statistically 
significant reduction in seizure frequency offered by CBD-OS constitutes a favourable effect in this 
difficult to treat population. A reduction of 50% in the frequency of seizures is considered a clinically 
relevant effect. However, some notable uncertainties about the favourable effect of CBD-OS remain. In 
particular, results of the subgroup analysis of patients treated with clobazam compared to patients 
treated without clobazam, indicated that there is residual statistical uncertainty regarding the 
treatment effect of cannabidiol in patients not taking clobazam. In this population, efficacy has not 
been established. Therefore, the indication proposed by the CHMP was narrower than originally 
proposed by the sponsor. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
Since the orphan designation application (ODA) was submitted on 27 October 2016 and the COMP 
recommended granting orphan designation on 16 February 2017, no significant changes in the 
chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature of the condition have been described since no 
new treatment guidelines or major reviews on LGS have been identified in the literature. There were 
also no newly authorised products specifically indicated for the treatment of LGS in the EU.   
Amongst the products already authorised in the EU specifically for the treatment of LGS, the only one 
that has been the subject of clinical trials published since the orphan designation for cannabidiol is 
rufinamide. Neither of two published studies provides any evidence of an improvement in morbidity or 
mortality in patients with LGS due to treatment with rufinamide. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
Mortality rates in patients with LGS have been reviewed to estimate the median survival of patients. 
Cherian (2017) reported a mortality rate of 7% after a mean follow-up period of 9.7 years. This 
indicates a survival rate at 9.7 years of 93%. Therefore, the median survival of patients with LGS is in 
excess of 9.7 years and therefore it is appropriate to use point prevalence to estimate the number of 
people affected. 
Publications identified providing point prevalence data for the EU are discussed below and summarized 
in Table 1 below.

The review of point prevalence data for LGS in EU counties shows an occurrence of 0.33-2.01 per 
10,000 in the total population. The sponsor discusses the probability that the prevalence would be 
higher in children. Nevertheless, the COMP accepted the Sponsor's conservative approach, which uses 
the upper estimate of the prevalence of LGS in the EU. The resulting prevalence of 2 per 10,000 
persons is in line with recent orphan designations and the upper limit in publications. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Four products are currently authorised in the EU specifically for the treatment of LGS, namely 
rufinamide, lamotrigine, topiramate and felbamate, as was the case at the time of the ODA (see Table 
2).

treatments and whose epilepsy is 
so severe that a substantial risk of 
aplastic anaemia and/or liver failure 
is deemed acceptable 
Other anti-epileptic drugs may be also considered as satisfactory methods of treatment (such as 
clobazam and valproate) and are discussed by the sponsor in the context of the current treatment 
guideline for LGS and in the context of their trials performed for this dossier. 
The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have produced a recommended 
pathway for the treatment of LGS (NICE, 2016). NICE have suggested that first line treatment is 
sodium valproate. If this is not effective or tolerated then lamotrigine should be prescribed as 
adjunctive treatment.  Other AEDs that may be used are rufinamide, topiramate and felbamate. 
Usually, it takes a combination of more than one AED to gain any seizure control.

Significant benefit 
Protocol assistance was not sought on demonstrating significant benefit over products specifically 
authorised in the EU to treat LGS. However, the demonstration of significant benefit had been 
discussed with the COMP for the clinical programme of cannabidiol in Dravet syndrome, which is 
another severe, refractory, childhood epilepsy syndrome. In that protocol assistance, the COMP agreed 
that significant benefit would be established if the pivotal clinical trial showed a superior efficacy of 
cannabidiol over placebo in patients who were inadequately controlled on the only product specifically 
authorised in the EU to treat Dravet syndrome, namely stiripentol. The same approach has been used 
in the LGS programme, although the sub-group of patients analysed was extended to include not only 
the patients with inadequate control at the time of study entry on each product specifically authorised 
in the EU to treat LGS, but also those who had previously tried and failed treatment with each of these 
products. 
In the protocol assistance for the Dravet syndrome indication, the COMP also advised that it should be 
established that any efficacy found in patients inadequately controlled on stiripentol cannot be 
attributed to a pharmacokinetic interaction with cannabidiol. The same approach has also been used 
for the LGS indication. 
It should be noted that neither of the conducted studies was powered for the presented sub-group 
analyses, meaning that firm conclusions may not be reliably drawn from each individual sub-group 
analysis. These post-hoc analyses were not specified in the protocol or statistical analysis plan. Hence 
the results of a pooled analysis are presented. 
Rufinamide 
The tables below show the results in patients, who have tried and failed rufinamide, or those who are 
currently taking it. There is a significantly greater reduction in drop and total seizure frequency and a 
significantly greater proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction in drop seizure frequency at the 20 
mg/kg/day dose of cannabidiol compared with placebo.

Furthermore, the sponsor stressed the adverse safety profile of felbamate, which places it into a 
different risk/benefit category compared with cannabidiol. For example the use of felbamate is 
associated with a “marked increase in the incidence of aplastic anaemia” and of the risk of acute liver 
failure, commonly resulting in death or the need for liver transplantation.  
Pooled data from two well-controlled, multi-centre, multi-national randomised studies show that 
patients who are taking, or who have previously taken and have since stopped, the AEDs authorised 
for use in LGS in the EU, go on to achieve significant benefit from cannabidiol With regards to 
rufinamide, lamotrigine, topiramate and felbamate it is unlikely that these effects are related to the 
increased plasma levels of concomitant AEDs due to a pharmacokinetic interaction with cannabidiol, 
since rufinamide and lamotrigine are metabolised only to a minor degree by cytochrome P450 enzymes 
(which are inhibited by cannabidiol) (Inovelon 2017; Lamictal, 2017), and no more than 60% of 
topiramate and felbamate undergo any type of metabolism (Topamax, 2017; Felbatol, 2009). These 
pooled data analyses show that add-on treatment with cannabidiol is able to provide a clinically 
relevant advantage over and above that obtained by lamotrigine, rufinamide, felbamate and 
topiramate. This constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
The committee relied on the CHMP assessment and the outcome of the scientific advisory group for 
this marketing authorisation to further understand the interaction of cannabidiol with clobazam and 
valproate. No statistical differences were observed when evaluating drug-drug interactions with 
valproate. According to the sponsor approximately 40% of patients received concomitant valproate 
during the study and many were refractory to this treatment. Therefore, the significant benefit over 
valproate was accepted. 
Some degree of PK interaction between clobazam and cannabidiol was noted. Results of the subgroup 
analysis of patients treated with clobazam compared to patients treated without clobazam, indicated 
that there is residual statistical uncertainty regarding the treatment effect of cannabidiol in patients not 
taking clobazam. In this population, efficacy has not been established. . However, since more than half 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/428872/2019 
Page 17/27 
 
 
 
 
 
of patients in the studies did receive concomitant clobazam, and the subset analysis showed significant 
reductions in seizure frequency, the COMP considered significant benefit over clobazam alone justified 
when these two drugs are taken together (Tables 16 and 17).

In light of the narrower therapeutic indication which will only allow the use of cannabidiol in 
conjunction with clobazam, the COMP considered that the data in support of significant benefit in this 
setting is sufficient. The COMP considered that further reduction of seizures when added to the current 
standard of care constitutes a clinically relevant advantage and confirms the assumptions made at the 
time of initial orphan designation. 
2.4.  COMP position adopted on 26 July 2019 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated orphan medicinal product; 
the prevalence of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was 
estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be 2 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/428872/2019 
Page 18/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to the high frequency of multiple types of seizures, 
cognitive deterioration, behavioural disturbances, and poor long term prognosis despite existing 
treatments and life threatening due to a risk of sudden unexpected death due to epilepsy; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Epidyolex may be of potential significant benefit still holds. The sponsor 
provided clinical evidence to demonstrate that Epidyolex in conjunction with clobazam reduced 
seizure frequency in patients who have not adequately responded to clobazam or other authorised 
products for this condition.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Epidyloex (cannabidiol), 
EU/3/17/1855 for treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is not removed from the Community 
Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

3.2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion at the designation stage  
The sponsor GW Pharma Ltd submitted on 15 May 2014 an application for designation as an orphan 
medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing cannabidiol for 
treatment of Dravet syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The application was 
submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan 
medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing cannabidiol was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data in patients with the condition;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to psychomotor and cognitive impairment and the 
occurrence of convulsive seizures, and life-threatening in particular due to generalized tonic-clonic 
seizures; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing cannabidiol may be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided clinical data that demonstrate that when used in combination with 
anticonvulsants there was a clinically relevant reduction in seizures associated with the condition. The 
Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing cannabidiol, as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan indication: treatment of Dravet syndrome. 
3.3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of marketing 
authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The sponsor reported that the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) issued a revised 
classification of seizure and epilepsy types in March 2017. This did not alter the classification of 
epilepsy syndromes (Scheffer et al, 2017). Therefore, Dravet Syndrome remains a recognised 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/428872/2019 
Page 22/27 
 
 
 
 
electroclinical epilepsy syndrome in accordance with the 2010 ILAE classification system (Berg et al, 
2010). 
Dravet syndrome (DS) is one of the most severe genetic epilepsy, which is predominantly caused by 
(usually de novo) heterozygous mutations in the SCN1A gene encoding a voltage-gated sodium 
channel. DS is characterised by the onset of febrile or afebrile convulsive seizures (clonic or 
hemiclonic) usually in the first year of life, evolving into status epilepticus in infants with initially 
normal psychomotor development.  Subsequently, the clinical epileptic scenario is complicated by the 
appearance of pharmaco-resistant photo- or pattern-induced seizures, myoclonic seizures, atypical 
absences until obtundation status, as well as complex partial seizures (Bureau and Dalla Bernardina, 
2011). Moreover, cognitive impairment and neurological signs with motor disorders of various degrees 
appear over the years. 
The approved therapeutic indication Epidyolex is indicated for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures 
associated with Lennox Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet syndrome (DS), in conjunction with 
clobazam, for patients 2 years of age and older falls within the scope of the designated orphan 
indication “Dravet Syndrome” in combination with another orphan drug designation held by the 
sponsor for the “treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified (please also see 
Epidyolex EPAR).  
The clinical development program supporting the efficacy of CBD-OS comprises 2 randomised, placebo-
controlled trials in DS; 1 investigating 10 and 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1424) and 1 investigating 
20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (GWEP1332 Part B).  
The pivotal trial consisted of a 4-week baseline period, followed by a 14-week treatment period 
comprising a 2-week titration (dose escalation) period and a 12-week maintenance (stable dosing) 
period. Patients who discontinued the investigational medicinal product (IMP) were to taper the dose 
over a 10-day period, with a safety follow-up 4 weeks after final dose.  
Primary and key secondary endpoints centred primarily on changes in seizure frequency, and were 
based on daily seizure reports. The number and type of seizures experienced by a patient were 
reported daily using a telephone-based IVRS. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from 
baseline in convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period, for CBD-OS compared with 
placebo. The pivotal trials included as a key secondary endpoint the proportion of CBD-OS vs. placebo 
patients who achieved at least a 50% reduction from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency. Other 
key secondary endpoints in the trials included the percentage change from baseline in total seizure 
frequency during the treatment period, and the Subject/Caregiver Global Impression of Change 
(S/CGIC) at last visit, for CBD-OS compared with placebo. 
Study GWEP1332B: The median percentage change from baseline in total convulsive seizure frequency 
during the treatment period was −38.94 in the CBD-OS group compared with −13.29 in the placebo 
group. The estimated median difference was in favour of CBD-OS treatment over placebo (−22.79; 
95% CI: −41.06, −5.43) and the difference between treatments was statistically significant 
(p=0.0123). 
Study GWEP1424: The median percentage change from baseline in total convulsive seizure frequency 
during the treatment period was -48.7 in the 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS group, -45.7 in the 20 mg/kg/day 
CBD-OS group, and -26.9 in the placebo group. The estimated median difference was in favour of 
CBD-OS treatment over placebo for both 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS and 20 mg/kg/day CBD-OS; the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/428872/2019 
Page 23/27 
 
 
 
 
difference between each CBD-OS group and placebo was statistically significant (p=0.0095 and 
p=0.0299, respectively). 
Similar degrees of reduction were seen in total seizures as well as across seizure types. 
CBD-OS can cause hepatocellular injury. Two patients concomitantly treated with valproate 
experienced toxic hepatocellular injury in combination with metabolic acidosis and encephalopathy, 
respectively. The incidence of TEAEs meeting the search criteria for AESI abnormal liver TEAEs was 
14.9% in the All CBD-OS group (N=456) compared with 3.1% in the placebo group (N=292). 
However, the number of liver-related adverse events was strongly dose-dependent. 
Currently available antiepileptic treatment rarely succeeds in keeping the children free of seizures and 
the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) remains high. In that respect, the statistically 
significant reduction in seizure frequency offered by CBD-OS constitutes a favourable effect in this 
difficult to treat population. A reduction of 50% in the frequency of seizures is considered a clinically 
relevant effect. However, some notable uncertainties about the favourable effect of CBD-OS remain.  
Results of the subgroup analysis of patients treated with clobazam compared to patients treated 
without clobazam, indicated that there is residual statistical uncertainty regarding the treatment effect 
of cannabidiol in patients not taking clobazam. In this population, efficacy has not been established. 
Therefore, the indication proposed by the CHMP was narrower than originally proposed by the sponsor. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
There is no evidence that the level of disability and mortality with Dravet syndrome has changed 
significantly since the time of the orphan designation. This is supported by a recent review on long-
term outcomes in patients with Dravet syndrome (Connolly, 2016). Since the initial orphan drug 
designation, only one clinical non-randomised study has been published that investigated the efficacy 
and safety of stiripentol in treating Dravet syndrome. This was a study of the use of stiripentol for up 
to 40 weeks in treating 24 Japanese patients who were inadequately controlled on clobazam and/or 
valproate. Of the 19 patients completing the study, 54% had a ≥50% reduction in the frequency of 
clonic/tonic-clonic seizures compared with baseline. However, the effect of treatment on disability or 
mortality was not investigated. Therefore, there is no evidence that any treatment for Dravet 
syndrome has improved the disability or mortality caused by the condition since the orphan 
designation. The condition remains a chronically debilitating and life threatening in nature. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
Based on literature review and for the purpose of prevalence calculation the sponsor made a few 
assumptions: 
1) A literature review indicates a survival rate at 9.25 years of at least 84%. Therefore, the median 
survival of patients with Dravet syndrome is in excess of 9-10 years. It is appropriate to use 10-years 
partial prevalence to estimate the number of people affected. 
2) This search identified only two reports on the prevalence of Dravet Syndrome in the EU; one from 
Sweden (Rosander & Hallböök, 2015) and another from Norway (Syvertsen et al, 2015).  
Based on these studies the point prevalence of Dravet syndrome in the EU is approximately 0.11 
people per 10,000 total population, and possibly as high as 0.3 per 10,000. This is less than the value 
of < 0.5 per 10,000 given at orphan designation and also given for two other products with orphan 
designations in Dravet syndrome, and is less than the EMA's estimate of 0.4 per 10,000 
(EMA/452415/2012 Rev 1), but similar to the birth prevalence of Dravet syndrome of 0.25 per 10,000 
cited by Orphanet (2018). Therefore, the Sponsor continues to agree that the estimate of the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/428872/2019 
Page 24/27 
 
 
 
 
prevalence of Dravet syndrome in the EU is less than 0.5 per 10,000 persons. The COMP considered 
that this estimate is acceptable. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
At this time, the only product authorised in the EU specifically for the treatment of Dravet syndrome 
remains Diacomit (stiripentol), as was the case at the time of the ODA. 
In addition, (sodium) valproate and clobazam, although not formally authorised for this condition, are 
recommended in Dravet syndrome and may therefore be considered as a satisfactory method of 
treatment.  
In 2015, a working party of the ILAE, which included participants from EU countries (Belgium, France, 
Italy, Romania and UK), published guidelines on the management of infantile seizures, including 
Dravet syndrome (Wilmshurst et al, 2015). These guidelines, based on systematic reviews of the 
literature, concluded that stiripentol (in combination with clobazam and valproate) is the only therapy 
for which there is strong evidence of efficacy in Dravet syndrome. The sponsor included a table 
comparing the drugs commonly used in European standard of care as compared to the study 
supporting this dossier (Table 1).

Protocol assistance was provided in June 2015 on demonstrating significant benefit over stiripentol 
using data from the clinical trials programme. In protocol assistance provided in June 2015, the COMP 
stated that "if patients with Dravet Syndrome insufficiently controlled by currently authorised 
antiepileptic treatments become seizure free, and/or experience a significant reduction in the number 
of seizures, under treatment with cannabidiol, this would constitute a clinically relevant advantage." 
Further: 
"Since significant benefit needs to be demonstrated over stiripentol, it is strongly recommended that a 
sufficient number of patients treated with stiripentol should be included in both arms." 
And: 
"Furthermore, a drug-drug interaction study, looking at the effect of cannabidiol on the 
pharmacokinetics of stiripentol will clarify whether cannabidiol affects exposure to stiripentol."

The sponsor addressed these comments by the COMP in the following: 
With regards to efficacy, amongst 120 patients in study GWEP1332 Part B (mean age 9.8 years) on at 
least one concomitant AED (median of 3) randomised to double-blind treatment with placebo or 
cannabidiol (titrated to 20 mg/kg/day) for 14 weeks, the primary efficacy variable (percentage change 
from baseline in total convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period) was statistically 
significantly greater with cannabidiol than placebo (median difference -22.79% [95% CI: -41.06, -
5.43]; p=0.0123, ITT analysis). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were consistent with this result. The 
proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction in baseline convulsive seizure frequency during 
treatment (a key secondary efficacy variable) was greater in the cannabidiol than the placebo group 
(43% vs 27%, respectively, ITT analysis). The odds ratio (2.00; 95% CI: 0.93, 4.30) was in favour of 
cannabidiol over placebo; this result approached, but fell short of, statistical significance (p=0.0784). 
With regards to stiripentol, amongst the 51 patients receiving concomitant stiripentol, the percentage 
change from baseline in total convulsive seizure frequency during the treatment period (the primary 
efficacy variable) was statistically significantly greater with cannabidiol (N=30) than placebo (N=21) 
(median difference -32.70% [95% CI: -57.12, -9.01], p=0.0085, ITT analysis). Consistent with this 
result, the proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction in baseline convulsive seizure frequency 
during treatment was numerically greater with cannabidiol than placebo amongst the patients receiving 
concomitant stiripentol (30.0 vs 9.5%, respectively; p=0.0977).  
Since stiripentol is authorised only in combination with valproate and clobazam, the committee 
assumed all patients on stiripentol would also receive valproate. No statistical differences were 
observed when evaluating drug-drug interactions with valproate in a non-clinical model. According to 
the sponsor approximately 57% of patients received concomitant valproate during the study (more 
than the proportion of patients receiving stiripentol) and many were refractory to this treatment. 
Therefore, the significant benefit over valproate was accepted. 
The drug-drug interactions were investigated in pharmacokinetic study GWEP1543 in 12 healthy 
subjects. The study was designed to demonstrate maximum effects of cannabidiol on stiripentol 
exposure under highly controlled conditions. At steady state, cannabidiol increased the maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax) of stiripentol by 28% (95% CI: 8-52%) and the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUCtau) by 55% (95% CI: 42-69%). However, this 
effect was not considered clinically significant since the upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals 
did not exceed 2. However, interactions with clobazam, another drug used in DS, have been discussed 
by the CHMP and confirmed by the sponsor. In addition, the subgroup analysis indicated that there is 
residual statistical uncertainty regarding the treatment effect of cannabidiol in patients not taking 
clobazam. These doubts led to the exclusion of the population not taking concomitant clobazam by the 
CHMP. The COMP further discussed what proportion of patient in the studies used clobazam and 
whether combined effects of stiripentol and clobazam together, elevated by the cannabidiol-mediated 
cyp450 inhibition, could contribute to the therapeutic effects observed. It will be of interest to elucidate 
the effects of CBD on its own and the mechanism of this effect. However, in light of the narrower 
therapeutic indication which will only indicate the use of CBD in combination with clobazam, the COMP 
considered that the data in support of significant benefit in this setting is sufficient. The COMP 
considered that further reduction of seizures when added to the current standard of care constitutes a 
clinically relevant advantage and confirms the assumptions made at the time of initial orphan 
designation.

3.4.  COMP position adopted on 26 July 2019 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated orphan medicinal product, 
the prevalence of Dravet syndrome (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to psychomotor and cognitive impairment and the 
occurrence of multiple types of epileptic seizures, and life-threatening due to status epilepticus and 
sudden unexpected death due to epilepsy; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, the assumption that Epidyolex may be of potential significant benefit to the subset of the 
orphan condition as defined in the granted therapeutic indication still holds. The sponsor provided 
clinical evidence to demonstrate that Epidyolex in conjunction with clobazam reduced seizure 
frequency in patients who have not adequately responded to the combination of clobazam, 
stiripentol and sodium valproate.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Epidyloex (cannabidiol), 
EU/3/14/1339 for treatment of Dravet syndrome is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

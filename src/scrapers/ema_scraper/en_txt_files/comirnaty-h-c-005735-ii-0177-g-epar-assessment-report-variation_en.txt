children aged 5 to 11 years and in individuals 12 years of age and older, respectively, based on interim 
results from studies C4591044 and C4591048. Study C4591044 is an interventional, randomized, 
active-controlled, phase 2/3 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
bivalent BNT162b RNA-based vaccine candidates as a booster dose in COVID-19 vaccine–experienced 
healthy individuals, while study C4591048 is a phase 1/2/3 master study to investigate the safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of a bivalent BNT162b2 RNA-based vaccine candidate. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated 
in accordance. Version 9.1 of the RMP has also been submitted. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. 
A.6: To change the ATC Code of tozinameran, riltozinameran and famtozinameran from J07BX03 to 
J07BN01. 
The group of variations requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling 
and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements

The data provided in this application are intended to support the authorization for use as a 2 dose 
primary series of the 10 μg formulation for children 5 to 11 years of age, and the 30 μg formulation for 
adolescents/adults ≥12 years of age, of the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 Vaccine (also referred 
to as BNT162b2 Bivalent [WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5] when describing clinical data).  
Current authorization of the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine for individuals ≥5 years of age 
at the age appropriate dose level of 10 µg or 30 µg was based on extrapolation of safety and 
immunogenicity data from approximately 1,840 participants >55 years of age in Study C4591031 
Substudy E who had a median of at least 1.7 months of follow-up after administration of the Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine as a fourth dose and supportive data from Study C4591031 Substudy D 
Phase 3 demonstrating safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of an investigational monovalent Omicron 
BA.1 vaccine in approximately 640 adult (≥18 to ≤55 years of age) participants up to 1-month post-
Dose 4 follow-up. The current authorization was also supported by clinical safety data from primary

and booster vaccination with original BNT162b2 vaccine and post-marketing safety data for original 
BNT162b2 vaccine. 
The MAH now requests authorization of the 10 μg or 30 μg formulation of BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(Original/OMI BA.4/BA.5) vaccine as a 2-dose primary series in children 5 to 11 years of age (10 µg) 
and in adolescents/adults ≥12 years of age (30 µg) based upon: 
o  Extrapolation of immunogenicity and safety data for participants ≥5 years to <12 years of age 
in Group 2 of Substudy D of Study C4591048 following administration of BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 10 μg as a booster (fourth dose) 
o  Extrapolation of immunogenicity and safety data from participants in Cohort 2 (≥12 years of 
age) and Cohort 3 (≥18 years of age) of Study C4591044 following administration of BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 30 or 60 μg as a booster (fourth dose) 
o  BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 μg and 10 μg specific CMC package, which was 
previously submitted. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic virus that first emerged as a human pathogen in China 
and has rapidly spread around the world by human-to-human transmission. 
Clinical presentation 
COVID-19 presentation is generally with cough and fever, with chest radiography showing ground-
glass opacities or patchy shadowing. However, many patients present without fever or radiographic 
changes, and infections may be asymptomatic which is relevant to controlling transmission. For 
symptomatic patients, disease progression may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring 
ventilation, subsequent multi-organ failure, and death. 
Common symptoms in hospitalized patients (in order of highest to lowest frequency) include fever, dry 
cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgias, nausea/vomiting or diarrhoea, headache, weakness, and 
rhinorrhoea. Anosmia (loss of smell) or ageusia (loss of taste) may be the sole presenting symptom in 
approximately 3% of individuals who have COVID-19.  
Management 
Currently available therapies have different benefit-risk considerations depending on the stage of 
illness and disease manifestations. While care for individuals who have COVID-19 has improved with 
clinical experience, vaccination is the most effective medical countermeasure to decrease risk and 
mitigate spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are several vaccines approved for primary vaccination 
against COVID-19, but most are based on the originally circulating strain. The variant adapted 
vaccines are so far only approved for booster vaccination. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
At present, BNT162b2 has received temporary authorization for emergency use, conditional marketing 
approval or full approval in >100 countries globally.

The European Commission (EC) approved the bivalent COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine 
(BNT162b2 Bivalent [WT/OMI BA.1]) and the bivalent COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.4-BA.5 vaccine 
(BNT162b2 Bivalent [WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5]) for use in individuals ≥12 years of age who have received at 
least primary vaccination against COVID-19 on 01 September 2022 and 12 September 2022, 
respectively. On 10 November 2022, the 10 μg dose of the COMIRNATY Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
vaccine was approved for use in individuals 5 through 11 years of age who have received at least 
primary vaccination against COVID-19 in EU. 
The immunogenicity assessment of a booster vaccination with Original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5 was based 
on extrapolation of immunogenicity data from booster studies with Comirnaty Original and 
Original/Omicron BA.1 and explorative non-clinical immunogenicity data for the Original/Omicron 
BA.4/BA.5. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The MAH is seeking to extend the indication of the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5), currently 
only indicated as a booster, to a two dose primary series for children 5-11 years of age (10 µg) and 
adolescents/adults >12 years of age (30 µg).  
No efficacy data from studies examining a two dose primary series for BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) were provided. Instead, extrapolation of immunogenicity data from study C4591044 that 
investigated this vaccine formulation as a booster (fourth dose) were submitted. The extrapolation is 
based on participants in Cohort 2 (≥12 years of age) and Cohort 3 (≥18 years of age) in the said study.  
In addition, the MAH has provided immunogenicity data from C4591048 Substudy D, an open-label 
study that investigates the safety, immunogenicity and tolerability profile of the bivalent BNT162b2 
given as a third or fourth dose in participants ≥5 to <12 years of age.  
In addition to the submitted data, previous conclusions i.e. the approval of the Original/Omicron BA.1 
and Original/Omicron BA.4-5 adapted vaccines as booster doses are taken into account.   
2.4.1.1.  Study C4591044 
Study C4591044 is a randomized, active-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of new bivalent vaccines. The study participants are divided into cohorts, which may 
be studied in a staggered or parallel manner. Cohorts 2 and 3 in the study consists of participants ≥12 
years of age who received 3 doses of BNT162b2, each at 30 µg, prior to receiving a booster (fourth 
dose) with BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at the 30- or 60-µg dose level. The groups within 
each cohort and the dose level of the study vaccine are defined in Table 1. The MAH has provided 1-
month post dose (four) immunogenicity data for the participants.

e.  A subset of approximately 100 participants in each age group (18 through 55 years of age, >55 
years of age) and dose group (30 µg, 60 µg) from C4591031 Substudy E expanded cohort who received 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) 30 µg or 60 µg as a second booster dose will be selected for this 
objective. The subset selected from C4591031 Substudy E will include similar percentage of 
participants with baseline positive SARS-CoV-2 infection status as the groups in Cohort 2 of this study, 
whenever feasible. 
f. 
this assessment. No blood samples were obtained for remote (telehealth) COVID-19 illness visits. 
If the COVID-19 illness visit was conducted as an in-person visit, a blood sample was taken for 
Immunogenicity results were based on validated assays for 50% SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers on a 
newly developed 384-well assay platform (reference strain [USA-WA1/2020, isolated in January 2020], 
Omicron BA.1, and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) at before first study vaccination (Dose 4) and 1 month after 
study vaccination (Dose 4) with the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg or 60 µg for 
participants enrolled in this study.  
Of note, the 384-well SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays have been recently validated and, unlike the 
previously used validated 96-well mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay platform, do not use 
reporter viruses with fluorescent markers. The neutralizing titers between the 384-well platform and 
96-well platform are not comparable; the titers from the 384-well assay platform are approximately 
2.5-fold higher than those from the 96-well assay platform. 
A non-validated fluorescent focus reduction neutralization test (FFRNT) was also used to characterize 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5, reference strain, and other emerging VOCs (BA.4.6, BA.2.75.2, BQ.1.1, XBB) 
neutralization responses following a booster (fourth) dose of BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 
30 μg compared to the WT vaccine (BNT162b2 30 μg) in a subset of BNT162b2-experienced adults 18 
through 55 and >55 years of age who received a booster (Dose 4) of BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) 30 μg in C4591044 Cohort 2.

2.4.1.1.2.  Immunogenicity Population 
This part of the immunogenicity analysis included approximately 100 randomized participants per 
vaccine group (Table 3). Approximately 100 participants in the 18 through 55 and >55 years of age 
groups in C4591031 Substudy E expanded cohort who received BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) 30 
µg or 60 µg were selected as the reference group. To achieve a similar balance of participants with or 
without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, except for the 18 through 55 years BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.1) 60-µg group, the reference group included all evaluable participants with evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection before study vaccination (baseline positive) and randomly selected additional 
participants without evidence of prior infection (baseline negative) from the corresponding groups in 
C4591031 Substudy E. Because of substantially lower prior infection rate in C4591031 Substudy E, the 
subset selected still has a lower baseline infection rate than the groups in C4591044 Cohort 2 except 
for the 18 through 55 years BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) 60-µg group. 
For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg groups, the evaluable immunogenicity 
population for participants with or without evidence of infection up to 1 month after study vaccination 
included a total of 105 participants 12 through 17 years of age, 95 participants 18 through 55 years of 
age, and 102 participants >55 years of age (Table 3). Most exclusions from the evaluable 
immunogenicity population were due to lack of at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result 
within 28 to 42 days after the study vaccination. The evaluable immunogenicity population without 
evidence of infection up to 1 month after study vaccination included a total of 25 participants 12 
through 17 years of age, 32 participants 18 through 55 years of age, and 40 participants >55 years of 
age. 
For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) 30-µg groups from Study C4591031 Substudy E, the 
evaluable immunogenicity population with or without evidence of infection up to 1 month after study 
vaccination included a total of 100 participants 18 through 55 years of age and 100 participants >55 
years of age (Table 3). The evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of infection up to 1 
month after study vaccination included a total of 67 participants 18 through 55 years of age and 64 
participants >55 years of age. 
For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 60-µg groups, the evaluable immunogenicity 
population for participants with or without evidence of infection up to 1 month after study vaccination 
included a total of 102 participants 18 through 55 years of age, and 99 participants >55 years of age 
(Table 3). Most exclusions from the evaluable immunogenicity population were due to lack of at least 1 
valid and determinate immunogenicity result within 28 to 42 days after the study vaccination. The 
evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of infection up to 1 month after study 
vaccination included a total of 23 participants 18 through 55 years of age and 31 participants >55 
years of age. 
For the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) 60-µg groups from Study C4591031 Substudy E, the 
evaluable immunogenicity population with or without evidence of infection up to 1 month after study 
vaccination included a total of 100 participants 18 through 55 years of age and 100 participants >55 
years of age (Table 3). The evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of infection up to 1 
month after study vaccination included a total of 30 participants 18 through 55 years of age and 65 
participants >55 years of age.

Blinding 
Cohort 2: Groups with participants ≥18 years of age were observer-blinded at the site level with 
respect to study intervention allocation (BNT162b2 [WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5]) and open-label to most Pfizer 
staff. 
Administration of the second booster dose was open-label for participants 12 through 17 years of age. 
Cohort 3: Both participant groups (18 through 55 years of age and >55 years of age) receiving the 
second booster were open-label. 
Although Cohort 2 had an open-label group (12 through 17 years of age receiving their second 
booster) and both Cohort 3 groups were open-label, the following instructions for site personnel 
applied to all participants in order to maintain the blinding for the other cohorts/groups: 
In this observer-blind study, the study staff received, stored, dispensed, prepared, and administered 
the study interventions as unblinded. All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, 
investigator staff, and participants, were blinded to study intervention assignments. In particular, the 
individuals who evaluated participant safety were blinded. Because there were differences in physical 
appearance of the study interventions, the study intervention was administered in a manner that 
prevents the study participants from identifying the study intervention group based on its appearance. 
The PI assigned the responsibility of the unblinded dispensers/administrators to persons who did not 
participate in the evaluation of any study participant. To ensure adequate coverage, at least 2 
unblinded dispensers/administrators were assigned per site. Members of the study site staff or clinic 
pharmacy should fulfil these roles. Contact between the unblinded dispensers and study participants 
was kept to a minimum. The investigator, study coordinator, and any site staff other than the 
unblinded dispensers/administrators were not allowed to know the study intervention assigned to any 
study participant and were not allowed to see the study intervention container contents. 
The study will be unblinded to site personnel at a time decided by Pfizer.

GMT 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 Neutralization 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMTs at pre-vaccination and 1 month after study vaccination in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population with or without evidence of infection are presented in Figure 1 and Table 
14.20. BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 30 µg and 60 µg dose elicited robust immune 
response against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 in all age groups and the response was higher than the 
corresponding BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) dose groups. 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMTs at pre-vaccination and 1 month after study vaccination were higher in 
participants who were baseline positive compared with those were baseline negative in all age and 
vaccine groups. 
Within baseline positive or baseline negative groups, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 GMTs were: 
• 
Higher in participants 12 through 17 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg compared with other age and vaccine groups at both pre-vaccination and 1 month 
after vaccination. 
• 
Larger increase from pre-vaccination in participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age in the 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg and 60-µg groups compared with participants in the 
corresponding BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) dose groups. The differences between BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) groups and BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) were more substantial in 
the baseline negative groups. 
• 
Generally similar in participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age who received BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at either dose. 
• 
Higher overall in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 60-µg group compared with that 
in the 30-µg group. 
• 
Generally similar across both sexes within each age and dose group. 
Results for participants in the all-available immunogenicity population were similar to the evaluable 
immunogenicity population.

Reference strain GMFRs from pre-vaccination to 1 month after study vaccination were higher in 
participants who were baseline negative compared with those were baseline positive in all age and 
vaccine groups. 
Within baseline positive or baseline negative groups, reference strain GMFRs were: 
• 
Within baseline negative groups, lower in participants 12 through 17 years of age in the 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group compared with other age and vaccine groups, 
likely due to higher pre-vaccination titers. 
• 
Within baseline positive groups, similar in participants 12 through 17 years of age in the 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group compared with other age and vaccine groups. 
• 
Within baseline negative groups, higher in participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age in 
the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg and 60-µg groups compared with participants in 
the corresponding BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) dose groups. 
• 
Within baseline positive groups, similar in participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age in 
the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg and 60-µg groups compared with participants in 
the corresponding BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) dose groups. 
• 
Generally similar in participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age who received BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at either dose. 
• 
• 
Generally similar between the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30- and 60-µg groups. 
Generally similar across both sexes within each age and dose group. 
Results for participants in the all-available immunogenicity population were similar to the evaluable 
immunogenicity population. 
Participants Without Evidence of Infection 
Reference strain GMFRs from pre-vaccination to 1 month after study vaccination in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population without evidence of infection are presented in Table 6. The results were 
similar to the baseline negative groups in the evaluable immunogenicity population with or without 
evidence of infection described above. 
Seroresponse 
Seroresponse was defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise from baseline (before the study vaccination) at 
each timepoint after vaccination (or postvaccination assay result ≥4 × LLOQ if the baseline 
measurement was below LLOQ). 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 Neutralization 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 30 µg and 60 µg dose elicited robust immune response 
against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 in all age groups and the response was similar or higher than the 
corresponding BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) dose groups. 
Seroresponse rates at 1 month after study vaccination were lower in participants who were baseline 
positive compared with those were baseline negative in all age and vaccine groups.

Cohort 2 – New Variants Neutralization Subset 
Geometric Mean Titers 
Among participants >55 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population with or without 
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the study vaccination GMTs at pre-dose 
and 1 month post-dose were higher for participants in both vaccine groups in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population who had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline (baseline 
positive) compared with those who were without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline 
(baseline negative) (Table 8). 
Within both baseline positive or baseline negative groups, Omicron variants BA.4.6, BA.2.75.2, XBB, 
and BQ.1.1 neutralizing GMTs at 1 month post-dose were higher for participants >55 years of age in 
the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group compared with the BNT162b2 30-µg group. 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 
month after the study vaccination, the observed GMTs at 1 month post-dose against Omicron variants 
BA.4.6, BA.2.75.2, BQ.1.1, and XBB were higher in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg 
group compared to the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI/BA.1) 30-µg group. Omicron XBB was the least 
effectively neutralized variant for both vaccine groups. Despite different intervals from Doses 3 to 4, 
the pre-Dose 4 neutralizing titers were similar between the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 
30-µg and BNT162b2 30-µg vaccine groups in participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection up to 1 month after the study vaccination. 
Similar results were observed for participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in 
the all-available immunogenicity population.

(WT/OMI/BA.1) 30-µg group were generally similar between participants who were baseline positive or 
baseline negative (Table 10). 
Within both baseline positive or baseline negative groups, GMFRs at 1 month post-dose were higher for 
the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group compared with the BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI/BA.1) 30-µg group. Similar results were observed for participants with or without evidence of 
prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in the all-available immunogenicity population. 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, GMFRs of 
neutralizing titers from before study vaccination to 1 month post-dose for Omicron BA.4.6, BA.2.75.2, 
BQ.1.1, and XBB were substantially higher for participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group compared with participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI/BA.1) 30-µg group, with higher fold rises reported for Omicron BA.4.6 and BQ.1.1 
and lower fold rises reported for Omicron BA.2.75.2 and XBB.

Seroresponse 
Seroresponse was defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise from baseline (before the study vaccination) at 
each timepoint after vaccination (or postvaccination assay result ≥4 × LLOQ if the baseline 
measurement was below LLOQ). 
When comparing the impact of baseline SARS-CoV-2 status, in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group, seroresponse rates at 1 month-post-dose were generally lower for 
participants who were baseline positive compared with those who were baseline negative. In the 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI/BA.1)30-µg group, seroresponse rates for participants were higher for 
participants who were baseline positive compared to participants who were baseline negative (Table 
11). 
Within the baseline positive or baseline negative group, seroresponse rates at 1 month post- dose 
were higher for participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg 
group compared with participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI/BA.1) 30-µg 
group. Similar results were observed for participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection in the all-available immunogenicity population. 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the 
proportion of participants who achieved a seroresponse to Omicron BA.4.6, BA.2.75.2, BQ.1.1, and 
XBB at 1 month post-dose was higher for participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group (94.1%, 70.6%, 76.5%, and 41.2%, respectively) compared with 
participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 30- µg group (15.0%, 5.0%, 0.0%, and 0.0%, 
respectively).

Mean Ratio 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
One of the primary immunogenicity objectives was to assess the superiority with respect to level of 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing titer induced by BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg in the

>55-age group relative to the anti-Omicron immune response elicited by BNT162b2 30 µg in the >55-
age group from C4591031 Substudy E. 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population with or without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month 
after study vaccination, model-based GMR of Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing titer for participants >55 
years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group to C4591031 Substudy E 
participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 30-μg group was 2.91 (2-sided 95% CI: 2.45, 3.44) 
(Table 14). Superiority of BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 μg to BNT162b2 30 μg in the 
>55-year age group was met, as the model-based lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was 
>1. Unadjusted GMR showed similar trends to the model-based GMR. 
Results for participants in the all-available immunogenicity population were similar to those in the 
evaluable immunogenicity population in Table 14.

Noninferiority of Anti-Omicron BA.4/BA.5 Immune Response Based on Difference in 
Seroresponse Rate 
The primary immunogenicity objective was also to assess the noninferiority with respect to 
seroresponse rate of the anti-Omicron BA.4/BA.5 immune response induced by BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg in the >55-age group relative to the anti-Omicron BA.4/BA.5 immune 
response elicited by BNT162b2 30 µg in the >55-age group from C4591031 Substudy E. 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity participants with or without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month 
after study vaccination, 66.7% of participants >55 years of age and 46.5% of participants >55 years 
of age in the BNT162b2 30-µg group achieved a seroresponse to Omicron BA.4/BA.5. The adjusted 
difference in percentages of participants in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group 
compared with participants given BNT162b2 30 µg as a second booster dose in C4591031 Substudy E 
was 26.77 % (95% CI: 19.59, 33.95) (Table 16). 
Noninferiority based on seroresponse for participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-μg group compared to participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 30 μg 
was met, as the adjusted lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of 
participants with seroresponse was >-5%. 
The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in seroresponse rates was also greater than 
0%, indicating a higher seroresponse to Omicron BA.4/5 in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) 30-μg group than in the BNT162b2 30-μg group. 
Unadjusted difference in seroresponse rates and 95% CI showed similar trends to the adjusted results. 
Differences in seroresponse at 1 month after study vaccination for participants in the all-available 
immunogenicity population were similar to the evaluable immunogenicity population.

Participants Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after 
study vaccination, model-based GMR of Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing titers for participants 18 
through 55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-μg group) to participants 
>55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-μg group was 1.00 (2-sided 95% 
CI: 0.71, 1.41) (Table 15, above). 
Unadjusted GMR showed similar trends to the model-based GMR. 
Noninferiority of Anti-Omicron BA.4/5 Immune Response in Participants 18 Through 55 
Years to >55 Years Based on Difference in Seroresponse Rate 
Participants Without or Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population with or without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month 
after study vaccination, 61.2% of participants 18 through 55 years and 66.7% of participants >55 
years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg groups achieved a seroresponse to 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5. The adjusted difference in percentages of participants with a seroresponse to 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 between 18 through 55 years of age and >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg groups was -3.03 % (95% CI: -9.68, - 3.63) (Table 16, above). 
Noninferiority based on seroresponse for participants 18 through 55 years of age in the BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-μg group to participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-μg group was met, as the adjusted lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse was >-10% for the comparison. 
Unadjusted difference in seroresponse rates and 95% CI showed similar trends to the adjusted results. 
However, the unadjusted difference between the 2 age groups was greater than the adjusted 
difference (with the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference <-10%), likely due to the 
different proportions of participants who were baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive in the 2 age groups. 
Participants Without Evidence of Infection 
Differences in seroresponse rate for Omicron BA.4/BA.5 reported for participants 18 through 55 
compared with participants >55 years of age in the evaluable immunogenicity population without prior 
evidence of infection up to 1 month after study vaccination were similar to those in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population with or without prior evidence of infection up to 1 month after study 
vaccination. Unadjusted difference in seroresponse rates showed similar trends to the adjusted results 
for participants without prior evidence of infection.

infection (baseline negative) (Table 18, Figure 5) 
Within baseline positive or baseline negative groups, BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs at 1 month after 
study vaccination were substantially higher for participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age in the 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group compared with the BNT162b2 30-µg group. 
GMTs across both sexes were similar, with higher observed BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs at 1 month 
after study vaccination across all age groups and vaccine groups. 
Results for participants in the all-available immunogenicity population was similar to the evaluable

Reference Strain Neutralization 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
Similar to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMT, reference strain GMTs at pre-dose and 1 month after 
study vaccination were higher for participants who were baseline positive compared with those who 
were baseline negative for SARS-CoV-2 in all vaccine groups (Figure 7). Reference strain GMTs at 1 
month post dose were also higher for all participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age in the 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg groups compared with participants 18 through 55 and 
>55 years of age in the BNT162b2 30-µg groups 
Within baseline positive or negative groups, reference strain neutralizing GMTs at 1 month after study 
vaccination were higher or similar for the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg groups 
compared with the BNT162b2 30-µg group. Reference strain GMTs at 1 month post dose were higher 
for all participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 
30-µg groups compared with participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 30-µg 
group, mainly due to higher baseline positive rate in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-
µg groups. 
GMTs across both sexes were similar, with higher observed BA.4/BA.5 neutralizing GMTs at 1 month 
after study vaccination across all age groups and doses. 
Results for participants in the all-available immunogenicity population was similar to the evaluable 
immunogenicity population.

GMFRs from before study vaccination to 1 month after study vaccination were higher for participants in 
both vaccine groups who were baseline negative compared with those who were baseline positive 
(BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg: 18 to 55 years: 22.5 vs 5.1, >55 years: 21.5 vs 5.2; 
BNT162b2 30 µg: 5.1 vs 2.4) for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 20). Within baseline positive or baseline negative 
groups, GMFRs at 1 month after study vaccination were higher for BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI

Participants Without Evidence of Infection 
Overall, in the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
GMFRs of neutralizing titers from before study vaccination to 1 month after study vaccination for 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 were substantially higher for participants 18 to 55 and >55 years of age in the 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group (20.6 and 21.3, respectively) compared with

Reference Strain Neutralization 
Participants Without or Without Evidence of Infection 
GMFRs from before study vaccination to 1 month after study vaccination were generally higher for 
participants in both vaccine groups who were baseline negative compared with those who were 
baseline positive (BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 µg: 18 to 55 years: 11.6 vs 2.7, >55 
years: 9.9 vs 2.7; BNT162b2 30 µg: 4.5 vs 1.5) for SARS-CoV-2 reference strain (Table 20, above). 
Within baseline positive or baseline negative groups, GMFRs at 1 month after study vaccination were 
higher for BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group compared with the BNT162b2 30-µg 
group, possibly due to longer interval from last dose and lower pre-vaccination titers in the BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group. 
GMFR across both sexes were similarly high across all age groups and doses. 
Results for participants in the all-available immunogenicity population were similar to the evaluable 
immunogenicity population. 
Participants Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, GMFRs for 
the reference strain from before study vaccination to 1 month after study vaccination were also higher 
for participants 18 to 55 and >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg 
group (11.0 and 9.7 respectively) compared with participants >55 years of age in the BNT162b2 30-µg 
group (4.5) (Table 21, above), possibly due to longer interval from last dose and lower pre-vaccination 
titers in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg group. 
GMFRs 
GMFRs at 1 month after study vaccination were higher for participants 18 through 55 and >55 years of 
age in the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30-µg groups compared with participants 18 
through 55 and >55 years in the BNT162b2 30-µg group.

2.4.1.2.  Study C4591048, substudy D 
Substudy D is a Phase 3 open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a 
third or fourth dose with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 10 µg in approximately 250 
participants. 
The protocol planned for enrolment of approximately 200 participants ≥5 to <12 years of age, who 
have received 2 or 3 prior doses of Original BNT162b2 10 µg, with their last dose 90 to 240 days prior

Descriptive immunogenicity analyses were performed to characterize Omicron BA.4/BA.5 and reference 
strain neutralization responses following a fourth dose with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi 
BA.4/BA.5) (C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 participants) or after 3 doses of BNT162b2 (C4591007 
Phase 2/3 Participants) each at 10 µg. The validated SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay was used to 
determine Omicron BA.4/BA.5- and reference strain-specific neutralizing titers. 
GMTs  and  GMFRs  with  2-sided  95%  CIs  were  calculated  by  exponentiating  the  mean 
logarithm  of  the  tiers  and  fold  rises,  respectively,  and  the  corresponding  CIs  (based  on 
Student t distribution). Assay results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ. 
GMR and associated 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating the difference in LS means and 
the corresponding CIs based on analysis of logarithmically transformed assay results using a 
linear regression model that includes the baseline neutralizing titer, postbaseline infection status, 
and vaccine group as covariates. 
Unadjusted GMR was calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed 
assay results and exponentiating the mean. Two-sided CIs were obtained by calculating CIs 
using the Student t distribution for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay 
results and exponentiating the confidence limits. 
Seroresponse was defined as achieving a ≥4-fold rise from baseline (before the study vaccination 
[fourth dose]) for participants in Group 2 of Substudy D. If the baseline measurement was below 
the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of ≥4 × LLOQ was considered seroresponse. For the 
comparator group of participants from Study C4591007 Phase 2/3, seroresponse was defined as 
achieving a ≥4-fold rise from before the third dose. If the pre–third dose measurement was 
below the LLOQ, the postvaccination measure of ≥4 × LLOQ was considered seroresponse. The 
exact 2-sided 95% CIs for percentages of participants with seroresponse was calculated using the 
Clopper-Pearson method. 
The adjusted difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse, and the associated 2-
sided 95% CIs, were calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method stratified by baseline 
neutralizing titer category (<median, ≥median). The unadjusted difference in percentages of 
participants with seroresponse and the associated 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated using the 
Miettinen and Nurminen method. 
2.4.1.2.2.  Immunogenicity Population 
A total of 115 participants ≥5 to <12 years of age were assigned to receive a fourth dose with the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at 10 μg (Table 24). Twelve (10.4%) participants were 
excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity population, most due to not having at least 1 valid and 
determinate immunogenicity result after vaccination. The evaluable immunogenicity population with or 
without evidence of infection included 103 (89.6%) participants ≥5 years to <12 years of age who

received a fourth dose with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 10 μg. The evaluable 
immunogenicity population without evidence of infection included 43 (37.4%) participants in the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group. 
A total of 113 participants ≥5 to <12 years of age in Study C4591007 Phase 2/3 who received 3 doses 
of BNT162b2 at 10 μg was selected as the comparator group. No participants were excluded from the 
evaluable immunogenicity population for the comparator group. To account for potential factors 
affecting immune response, the comparator group participants were selected from Study C4591007 to 
have closest match in age and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status (before Dose 3 for C4591007 
participants and before Dose 4 for C4591048 Substudy D participants). As the Dose 3 administration in 
C4591007 ≥5 to <12 years of age was at least 6 months after Dose 2, the comparator group did not 
match the prior dosing interval (between Dose 2 and Dose 3 for C4591007 participants and between 
Dose 3 and Dose 4 for C4591048 participants). The evaluable immunogenicity population with or 
without evidence of infection for the comparator group included 113 (100%) participants ≥5 years to 
<12 years of age who received a third dose of BNT162b2 10 μg (Table 24). The evaluable 
immunogenicity population without evidence of infection included 45 (39.8%) participants in the 
BNT162b2 group.

BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) and BNT162b2 groups are shown in Table 25. A total of 
57.3% of participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group were baseline 
positive at the time of study vaccination (Dose 4). Median time since last dose of BNT162b2 
before study vaccination (Dose 4) was 5.5 months in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi 
BA.4/BA.5) group. In the BNT162b2 group, 58.4% of participants were baseline positive prior to

Seroresponse 
Omicron BA.4/BA.4 Neutralization 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity participants with or without evidence of prior infection up to 1-
month postdose, 53.5% of participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group 
achieved seroresponse to Omicron BA.4/BA.5. The adjusted difference in percentages of 
participants with seroresponse between the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group 
and the BNT162b2 group was 8.76% (95% CI: -2.47, 19.99) (27). Unadjusted difference in 
seroresponse rates was 0.79% (95% CI: -12.57, 14.10).

GMT 
Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralization 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population with or without evidence of prior infection, for both 
vaccine groups, GMTs against the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant were higher at predose and at 1-month 
postdose in participants who were baseline positive compared with those who were baseline negative 
(Table 28, Figure 9).

Within both baseline positive and baseline negative groups, BA.4/BA.5-neutralizing GMTs were higher 
in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group compared with that in the BNT162b2 group 
at pre-vaccination. For baseline positive participants, BA.4/BA.5- neutralizing GMTs at 1month 
postdose were higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group compared with the 
BNT162b2 group. For baseline negative participants, the observed GMTs at 1-month postdose were 
generally similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) and BNT162b2 groups, despite 
lower pre-vaccination values in the BNT162b2 group. The results are not as good as observed in 
previous studies for the bivalent group relative to the original vaccine group, especially for baseline 
negative participants. Lack of randomization (which results in substantial pre-vaccination titer 
differences between groups and potential imbalance in some participants characteristics) makes it very 
difficult to interpret the results. 
GMTs across both sexes were similar within both vaccine groups.

Reference Strain Neutralization 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population with or without evidence of prior infection, for both 
vaccine groups, the observed reference strain GMTs were higher at predose and generally similar or 
higher at 1 month postdose in participants who were baseline positive compared with those who were 
baseline negative (Table 28, Figure 10). 
Within both baseline positive and baseline negative groups, the observed reference strain- neutralizing 
GMTs were higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) compared with that in the 
BNT162b2 group at pre-vaccination. For baseline positive participants, at 1-month postdose, the 
observed reference strain-neutralizing GMTs were higher in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi 
BA.4/BA.5) group compared with the BNT162b2 group. For baseline negative participants, reference 
strain-specific neutralizing GMTs were generally similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi

Omicron BA.4/BA.5 neutralization 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity populations with or without evidence of prior infection, for both 
vaccine groups, GMFRs of Omicron BA.4/BA.5 at 1-month post dose were higher in participants who 
were baseline negative compared with those who were baseline positive (bivalent BNT162b2 
[Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5]: 6.9 vs 3.3, BNT162b2: 15.1 vs 2.7) (Table 29). 
For baseline positive participants, GMFRs at 1-month postdose were similar in the bivalent BNT162b2 
(Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) and BNT162b2 groups. For baseline negative participants, GMFRs were lower 
in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group compared with the BNT162b2 group, which 
may relate to the higher pre-vaccination titers in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 
group. 
GMFRs across both sexes were similar within both vaccine groups. 
Participants Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of infection, GMFRs for Omicron 
BA.4/BA.5 at 1-month postdose were lower in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) 
group (6.9; 2-sided 95% CI: 5.4, 8.8) compared with the BNT162b2 group (15.0; 2-sided 95% 
CI: 12.2, 18.4). 
Reference Strain Neutralization 
Participants With or Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity populations with or without evidence of infection, for both 
vaccine groups, GMFRs of reference strain at 1-month postdose were higher for participants who 
were baseline negative compared with those who were baseline positive (bivalent BNT162b2 
[Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5]: 4.0 vs 2.2, BNT162b2: 13.6 vs 2.9) (Table 29). 
For baseline positive participants, GMFRs at 1-month postdose were similar in the bivalent 
BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) and BNT162b2 groups. For baseline negative participants, 
GMFRs were lower in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group compared with the 
BNT162b2 group, which may relate to the higher pre-vaccination titers in the bivalent BNT162b2 
(Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group. 
GMFRs across both sexes were similar within both vaccine groups. 
Participants Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of infection, reference strain GMFRs 
from pre-vaccination to 1-month postdose were lower in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi

For baseline positive groups, seroresponse rates at 1-month postdose were slightly higher in 
participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) compared with the BNT162b2 
group. For baseline negative groups, seroresponse rates at 1-month postdose were slightly lower

Seroresponse rates across both sexes were generally similar within both vaccine groups. 
Participants Without Evidence of Infection 
In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior infection, the proportion of 
participants who achieved seroresponse at 1-month postdose were generally lower in the bivalent

MAH discussion of immunogenicity results for C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 
(5y-<12 yoa) 
At 1-month postdose, a fourth dose with bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at 10 μg 
in participants ≥5 years to <12 years of age in the C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 who received 
3 prior doses of original BNT162b2 at 10 μg indicated a robust immune response against Omicron 
BA.4/BA.5. The immune response elicited by bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) were 
generally similar for Omicron BA.4/BA.5- and reference strain-specific neutralizing titers and 
percentage of participants with seroresponse to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 compared with C4591007 
Phase 2/3 participants of the same age who received 3 doses of original BNT162b2.  
The magnitude of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 immune response after Dose 3 of BNT162b2 is 
unexpected and may be related to natural exposure and dose interval. As this analysis did not 
compare 2 contemporaneous randomized groups, there may have been an imbalance between 
the 2 groups in some measurable or nonmeasurable factors, such as those described below. This 
imbalance may have contributed to the unexpected results. Participants in C4591007 Phase 2/3 
received the third dose in March-April 2022, shortly after the Omicron BA.1 wave. 
Whilst not reflected in the N-binding antibody responses, this may have resulted in a significant 
level of natural exposure to Omicron BA.1; thereby, potentially augmenting the response to Dose 
3 of BNT162b2. The pre-vaccination GMTs also may have influenced the magnitude of the 
response to the booster dose (either Dose 3 or Dose 4), as they were higher in the bivalent 
BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group than in the comparator group. In addition, this 
difference may be due to the shorter interval between Dose 3 and Dose 4 in the BNT162b2 
(Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group (5.5 months, range 3.5-8.5 months) compared with the dose 
interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3 in the BNT162b2 group (6.5 months, range 6.3-7.6 
months). However, it may be more likely due to participants in the bivalent BNT162b2 
(Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group receiving the fourth dose in September- October 2022. Hence, 
these participants had a 6-month longer period of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 during the 
waves of multiple Omicron sublineages in 2022. The higher pre-vaccination GMTs were reflected 
in the lower GMFRs and seroresponse rates in participants who received a fourth dose with the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) compared with participants in C4591007 Phase 2/3 
who received 3 doses of original BNT162b2. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This application concerns the extension of indication of the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) to 
a two dose primary series for children 5-11 years of age (10 µg) and adolescents/adults >12 years of 
age (30 µg). The product received a booster indication for these age groups in the autumn of 2022. 
There were no clinical immunogenicity data submitted for that approval. Non-inferior immune 
responses to bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 were demonstrated compared to the original vaccine 
against the reference strain, along with superior immune responses to the BA.1 strain when given as 
booster dose. The approval of bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4/5 was based on the assumption that this 
bivalent vaccine would have the same characteristics as the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine as 
booster.  
No data on primary vaccination with a bivalent vaccine are available and are not expected in the age 
groups concerned in this application since the vast majority of the world population is either already 
vaccinated or exposed to the virus.

In the current application, immunogenicity data from study C4591044, where the BNT162b2 Bivalent 
(WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) was given as the fourth dose (second booster) in participant ≥12 years of age, 
and study C4591048 Substudy D, which investigated the immunogenicity of the bivalent product 
given as a third or fourth dose in participants ≥5 to <12 years of age. The results were compared to a 
control group given the original vaccine as a third dose in a separate study. As discussed by the MAH 
above, the comparator group may not be ideal, as the exposure to infection appears to be lower in the 
comparator group than the test group.   
In study C4591044 the MAH reports a clear increase in neutralizing GMT and a positive GMFR to both 
Omicron BA.4/5 and the reference strain in all age groups 1 month post-vaccination (12-17 years n = 
105, 18-55 years n = 297, >55 years n = 284). GMTs across both sexes were similar. Thus, the 
booster capacity of the product is confirmed.  
In the age group >18 years old, groups from the previous study C4591031 were employed as 
comparators. C4591031 investigated the immunogenicity of the original Comirnaty and the other 
bivalent formulation BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) given as the fourth dose. The BNT162b2 
Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) consistently performed better with regard to eliciting neutralizing 
antibody titers against both Omicron BA.4/5 as well as the reference strain when compared to 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.1) and the original formulation. 
The validity of the comparison of the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 to the original or 
Original/OmicronBA.1 was questioned as it was  unclear why the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) performed better with regards to neutralization and seroresponse rate for Omicron BA.1 
and the reference strain in comparison to the other two formulations. The MAH explained that linear 
regression model-based analysis adjusting the baseline neutralising titre level has been used to 
overcome the problem with incomparable historic control. GMR originates from model based GMT 
calculation, which is considered as an intermediate estimate in order to reach a more valid and 
meaningful model-based GMR.  
The superiority criterium for BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) in neutralization of Omicron 
BA.4/5 in comparison to the original BNT162b2 in the age group >55 years were met: GMR 2.91 (2-
sided 95% CI: 2.45, 3.44). The model-based lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >1, thus 
the criteria for superiority were met. The non-inferiority criterium for BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) were also met with regard to the anti-omicron BA.4-5 seroresponse rate in the age group 
>55 years. The secondary immunogenicity objective to show noninferiority of the anti–reference-strain 
immune response induced by BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) relative to the anti–reference-
strain immune response elicited by BNT162b2 30 µg in the >55-age group was also met. The MAH 
showed also non-inferiority in anti-omicron BA.4/5 GMR and seroresponse rate in the 18-55 years of 
age compared to the >55 years group in participants who received the bivalent vaccine. 
It is noteworthy that when the immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) against 
new variants in participants >55 years of age (n = 36) was investigated, the results were diverse. 
While a reasonable increase in neutralizing titers were observed against Omicron BA.4.6 1 month post-
vaccination, the effect against BQ.1.1, BA.2.75.2 and XBB was very low, and even lower against XBB. 
Although these in vitro analyses do not represent the full immune response elicited in vivo, which is 
likely more potent, it was noted that the neutralization effect against emerged variants is notably 
reduced. 
With regard to the younger cohort ≥5 to <12 years of age, the primary immunogenicity objectives of 
C4591048 Substudy D were to descriptively compare the anti–Omicron BA.4/BA.5 immune response 
in participants who received 3 prior doses of BNT162b2 10 µg and received bivalent BNT162b2 as a 
fourth dose to participants in study C4591007 who received the third dose of the original BNT162b2 10 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication  
EMA/355553/2023  
Page 79/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
µg. The secondary objectives were to describe the immune response elicited by bivalent BNT162b2 in 
the same cohort with regard to GMT and GMFR of reference strain- and omicron BA.4/5-neutralizing 
antibody titers. 
The model-based GMR comparing bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) with BNT162b2 in 
neutralization of Omicron BA.4/5 is close to 1 (1.12 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.92, 1.37)), meaning no 
substantial difference between the different vaccine formulations. Unadjusted GMR was 1.57 (2-sided 
95% CI: 1.18, 2.09). The seroresponse rate to omicron BA.4/5 was also almost identical: 53.5% vs 
52.7% for the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) and the original BNT162b2, respectively. 
The seroresponse rate to the reference strain overall is reported to be lower in the BNT162b2 
(Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) vaccinated group as compared to the group that received the original 
BNT162b2: 30.7% vs 54.9%. In the evaluable immunogenicity population without evidence of prior 
infection, the proportion of participants who achieved seroresponse at 1-month postdose were 48.8% 
in the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) group compared with 95.6% in the BNT162b2 
group. It is however noted that the first group generally had a higher baseline level of GMT due to 
having one extra dose.  
The rise of GMT levels to Omicron BA.4/BA.5 for baseline negative participants are very similar post-
vaccination for both formulation, albeit the bivalent vaccine elicited a slightly stronger response in 
baseline positive participants. The same analysis conducted on the reference strain yielded similar 
results. It can be concluded that the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine is capable of eliciting a 
booster response in 5-<12 year old subjects. 
2.4.1.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
In summary the data submitted in this application demonstrate:  
•  A substantial increase in GMT to Omicron BA.4/5 and the reference strain is seen after the 
bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) is administered as a booster in all age groups.  
• 
• 
• 
In the age group >18 years, the immune response against Omicron BA.4/5 is more substantial 
compared to the original formulation.  
In the age group 12-17 years there is a lack of an active comparator.  
In the age group 5-11 years the bivalent vaccine does not perform substantially better than 
the original vaccine formulation with regards to neutralization of Omicron BA.4/5 according to 
the model-based GMR. 
Considering that: 
•  Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 has demonstrated superior immune responses to BA.1 and 
non-inferior responses to the reference strain 
•  Any bivalent original/variant vaccine is considered to have similar characteristics as the 
Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine 
•  Booster responses of the same magnitude can be extrapolated to primary vaccination 
•  No primary vaccination data will be available 
• 
It is likely that primary vaccination with a vaccine covering currently circulating strains is 
superior against these, compared to primary vaccination with the original vaccine

• 
In the dose-finding study C4591001 for the original formulation, it was shown that 10 µg of 
mRNA encoding the spike antigen elicited a somewhat comparable response as the 30 µg 
formulation in healthy adults. 
it seems acceptable to agree on a primary vaccination schedule for the bivalent vaccine. In totality, it 
is reasonably likely that a primary series with the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) will 
yield a better, or comparable, immune response as the original formulation against the strains 
investigated. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
With the aim to support the use of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
administered as a primary series at 10µg (5+5µg) for subjects aged ≥5 to <12 years and at 30µg 
(15+15 µg) in subjects ≥12 years of age, data from two studies (C4591048 substudy D and 
C4591044) has been presented where these vaccines have been administered as booster dose to each 
age group. The studies are described separately below. No data has been provided where the bivalent 
vaccine has been used as primary series. 
Study C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 (≥5 to <12 Years of Age): Booster (Fourth Dose) with 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 10 μg 
Substudy D is an open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a fourth 
dose of the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 5+5 µg in participants ≥5 to <12 years of 
age who have received 3 prior doses of BNT162b2 Original at 10 μg. Data cut-off was 25 November 
2022. 
Initially, 115 participants ≥5 years to <12 years were assigned to receive a fourth dose of the bivalent 
BNT162b2 Original/ BA.4-5 at 10 μg. Two participants were excluded from the safety population as 
they withdrew prior to receiving study intervention, therefore the safety population included 113 
subjects that had received a fourth dose. At the cut-off date 106 subjects had completed the 1-month 
post-study vaccination visit. Median follow-up time after study vaccination was 1.6 months.

Ten participants received a non-study vaccine (Influenza vaccine) after study vaccination. Nine 
participants received the influenza vaccine at least 14 days after study vaccination, as allowed per 
protocol; 1 participant received the influenza vaccine 12 days after study vaccination. 
Local Reactions 
All local reactions illustrated in the figure below were mild or moderate in severity. No severe or Grade 
4 local reactions were reported. 
The median onset for all local reactions was 1 to 2 days, and all events resolved within a median 
duration of 2 days after onset. 
No clinically meaningful differences in local reactions were observed by sex or baseline SARS-CoV-2 
status subgroups. 
Figure 11.
Systemic Events 
The reported systemic events are illustrated in the figure below. Two (1.8%) participants reported 
fever >38.9°C to 40°C. No participants reported fever >40.0 °C. Antipyretic or pain medication use 
was reported by 23.4% of participants after study vaccination. 
Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Incidence of severe systemic events was low 
(fatigue and headache, 1 participant [0.9%] each) in the ≥5 years to <12 years of age group who 
received a fourth dose of the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) at 10 μg. No Grade 4

systemic events were reported. The median onset for all systemic events was 2 to 4 days, and all 
events resolved within a median duration of 1 to 2 days after onset. 
No clinically meaningful differences in systemic events were observed by sex or baseline SARS-CoV-2 
status subgroups.

Adverse Events 
In total, 4 (3.5%) participants reported any AE. Related AEs and severe AEs were reported by 1 
(0.9%) participant each. No SAEs or life-threatening AEs were reported. No withdrawals due to AEs, or 
deaths were reported. Overall, the AE profile at 1 month post dose was generally similar to that at 7 
days post dose. No additional AEs were reported up to data cut-off date of 25 November 2022.

Table 32. 
Number (%) of Participants Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event From the Study Vaccination 
to 1 Month After the Study Vaccination, by System Organ Class and Preferred Term – 
Substudy D Group 2 – Safety Population  
Immediate Adverse Events 
No participant in the ≥5 years to <12 years of age group were reported to have an immediate AE 
within 30 minutes of study vaccination. 
Related Adverse Events 
AEs assessed by the investigator as related were reported by 1 participant and included 1 event of 
lymph node palpable. 
Severe or Life-Threatening Adverse Events 
One participant reported a severe AE, and no participant reported a life-threatening AE or SAE from 
study vaccination through 1 month after study vaccination.  
Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal 
There were no discontinuations due to AEs reported for participants in Group 2 from study vaccination 
through 1 month after vaccination. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
Some AEs are of specific interest due to their autoimmune or neuroinflammatory nature, theoretical 
association with vaccines, or known occurrence in patients with COVID-19. From study vaccination 
through 7 days post dose, no AEs of anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity, appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, 
myo/pericarditis were reported up to 1 month post vaccination in these 113 participants. AEs of clinical 
interest that were identified in the safety database from study vaccination to 1 month after study 
vaccination are summarized below: 
Lymphadenopathy: Lymphadenopathy is considered an adverse reaction to this vaccine and is noted as 
such in the product labelling. One male participant between 10 and 17 years of age reported an event 
of lymph node palpable (left axillary lymph node palpable) of moderate severity with onset on Day 2 
after study vaccination that resolved within 3 days. The event was assessed by the investigator as 
related to study intervention.

MAH Safety Conclusion:  
The safety profile within 1 month after study vaccination (dose 4) with the bivalent BNT162b2 
(Original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5) at the 10-μg dose level was generally well tolerated, with mostly mild or 
moderate reactogenicity and few reported AEs. No new adverse reactions were identified based on the 
available data from this data cut. 
The reactogenicity profile within 7 days after the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5) 
vaccine was generally similar to that previously observed in association with the original BNT162b2 
vaccine within the respective age group. 
The AE profile within 1 month after study vaccination was consistent with the known safety profile of 
BNT162b2. Incidence of AEs, including severe AEs, was low. No immediate AEs, SAEs, or AEs leading 
to withdrawal were reported. Other than 1 case of lymph node palpable, no other AEs of clinical 
interest were reported (eg, anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity, appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, myo/pericarditis). 
No new or concerning safety findings were noted in these 113 participants up to 1 month of post 
vaccination data. 
Based on the safety data up to 1 month after study vaccination with the bivalent BNT162b2 
(Original/Omicron BA.4/BA.5) at the 10-μg dose levels in 113 Study C4591048 participants ≥5 years 
to <12 years of age, the BA.4-5 Omicron-modified bivalent vaccine appears to be safe and tolerable in 
this population, and consistent with the known safety profile of BNT162b2. 
Study C4591044 Cohorts 2 (≥12 Years of Age) and 3 (≥18 Years of Age): Booster (Fourth 
Dose) of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 30 or 60 μg 
This study was previously evaluated in EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0147 with a cut-off date 12 Sept 2022 
and in EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/059.1 with similar cut-off date (12 Oct 2022) as in this application. 
In Cohort 2, he safety population included 528 participants ≥12 years of age who received a fourth 
dose of BNT162b2 bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) 30- or 60-μg as illustrated in the table below. 
Duration of follow-up and vaccine administration are also illustrated below. All but 1 randomized 
participant received the study vaccination. In total, in participants ≥12 years of age who received a 
booster dose of BNT162b2 bivalent 30-or 60-µg, all but 1 (99.8%) completed the 7-day post-dose 
vaccination visit, and all but 9 (98.3%) completed the 1-month post-dose vaccination visit. One 
(0.9%) participant in the 18 to 55 years of age group who received BNT162b2 bivalent 60-μg was 
withdrawn from the study (due to physician decision) as of the data cut-off date (12 October 2022).

Table 33. 
Follow-up Time After Study Vaccination – Cohort 2 – Safety Population  
Local Reactions 
Local reactions and systemic events recorded in the e-diary for 7 days post vaccination are 
summarized in the figure below. 
Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity. Severe local reactions were reported by 1 
(0.9%) participant in the 12 to 17 years of age group who received a booster dose of BNT162b2 
bivalent 30-μg (severe pain at injection site) and 1 (0.9%) participant in the 18 to 55 years of age 
group who received a booster dose of BNT162b2 bivalent 60-μg (severe redness at injection site). No 
Grade 4 local reactions were reported in any group. The median onset for all local reactions was 1 to 3 
days, and all events resolved within a median duration of 1 to 3 days after onset. 
The pattern of local reactions reported within 7 days after the BNT162b2 bivalent (WT + OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) vaccine was generally similar to those previously observed in association with an Omicron 
BA.1-modified BNT162b2 bivalent vaccine and to the original BNT162b2 vaccine within the respective 
age groups. At each dose level, the frequency of reactions tended to be lower in the participants >55 
years of age. No clinically meaningful differences in local reactions were observed by sex or baseline 
SARS-CoV-2 status subgroups.

Systemic Events 
The incidence and/or severity of most systemic events was higher in participants who received the 60-
μg dose level of BNT162b2 bivalent within each age group. 
Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. In the BNT162b2 bivalent 30-μg dose group, 
severe systemic events of fever (n=1), fatigue (n=3), and diarrhoea (n=1) were reported. In the 
BNT162b2 bivalent 60-μg dose group, severe systemic events of fever (n=4), fatigue (n=5), headache 
(n=2), chills (n=1), muscle pain (n=2), and joint pain (n=2) were reported. No Grade 4 systemic 
events were reported in any group. 
The median onset for all systemic events was 2 to 4 days, and all events resolved within a median 
duration of 1 to 2 days after onset. 
The pattern of systemic events reported within 7 days after the BNT162b2 bivalent (WT + OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) vaccine was generally similar to those previously observed in association with an Omicron 
BA.1-modified BNT162b2 bivalent vaccine and to the original BNT162b2 vaccine within the respective 
age groups. At each dose level, the frequency of events tended to be lower in the participants >55 
years of age. 
No clinically meaningful differences in systemic events were observed by sex or baseline SARS-CoV-2 
status subgroups.

Adverse Events 
Table 34. 
Number (%) of Participants Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event From the Study Vaccination. 
Through 1 Month after the Study Vaccination – Cohort 2 – Safety Population  
Many of the AEs were consistent with reactogenicity events that were reported as AEs (eg, fatigue, 
injection site pain or erythema, chills, headache, myalgia), and included lymphadenopathy which is 
recognized as a potentially vaccine-related event. Each non-reactogenicity type event was reported in 
no more than 2 participants, of which only 1 event (menstruation irregular) was considered by the 
investigator to be possibly related to study intervention as summarized below. 
•  One event of menstruation irregular (missed menstrual period) was reported in a female 
participant between 20 and 30 years of age, considered by the investigator as related to study 
intervention. AE onset was 10 days after vaccination and resolved 25 days after onset. No 
further details were specified. 
Immediate Adverse Events 
One (1.0%) participant in the 12 to 17 years of age group reported an immediate AE of injection site 
erythema within 30 minutes of study vaccination. 
Related Adverse Events 
AEs assessed as related by the investigator were reported by 12 participants, and all but 1 
(menstruation irregular, discussed above) were consistent with reactogenicity events that were 
reported as AEs. Most related AEs were in the SOC of general disorders and administration site 
conditions, reported by 6 participants. Additionally, lymphadenopathy was reported by 2 participants in 
the 18 to 55 years of age group: 1 received BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 30 μg and the 
other received BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 60-μg.

Deaths and Serious Adverse Events 
One SAE of dyspnoea (shortness of breath) was reported in a participant in the >55 years of age group 
who received a booster dose of BNT162b2 bivalent 30-μg. This SAE was reported in a participant 
between 70 and 80 years of age, considered by the investigator to be severe and not related to study 
intervention. AE onset was 15 days after vaccination and was ongoing as of the data cutoff date (12 
October 2022). No further details were specified. 
No deaths were reported from study vaccination through 1 month post vaccination. 
Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal  
There were no discontinuations due to AEs from study vaccination through 1 month post vaccination. 
Other Significant Adverse Events  
No AEs of anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity, appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, myo/pericarditis were reported up to 
1 month post vaccination. Two cases of lymphadenopathy were reported from study vaccination up to 
1 month post vaccination as summarized below: 
• One case was in a participant between 40 and 50 years of age with onset 2 days post vaccination, of 
left axillary lymphadenopathy considered by the investigator as related to study intervention, and it 
was reported as resolved within 6 days after onset. 
• The other case was in a participant between 50 and 60 years of age with onset 2 days post 
vaccination, presenting with left axillary lymph node swelling. It was considered by the investigator as 
related to study intervention, and it was reported as resolved within 8 days after onset. 
Safety in special populations  
Geriatric Use 
Clinical studies of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) include participants ≥65 years of age 
whose data contribute to overall assessment of safety and efficacy. The clinical data from older adults 
(>55 years of age) have demonstrated a predominantly mild reactogenicity profile, and a lower 
frequency of reactions/systemic events compared with younger adults. 
Paediatric Use 
Clinical paediatric studies of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) includes participants 6 
months to <12 years of age enrolled in the ongoing study C4591048. The clinical data available so far 
have shown a predominantly mild reactogenicity profile in this age group.  
Use During Pregnancy and Lactation 
Individuals who were pregnant or breastfeeding were not eligible to participate in Study C4591044 and 
Study C4591048 Substudy D. No pregnancies have been reported in Study C4591044 and Study 
C4591048 Substudy D as of the respective data cut-off dates. No data are available yet regarding the 
use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 during pregnancy.  
Use in Immunocompromised Individuals 
Individuals who are immunocompromised or taking immunosuppressive therapy at the time of vaccine 
administration may have diminished response to immunization. Immunocompromised individuals with 
known or suspected immunodeficiency, as determined by history and/or laboratory/physical 
examination, were not eligible to participate in Study C4591044 and Study C4591048. There are 
limited data on the safety and effectiveness of the BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) in 
this patient population at the time of this submission.

Limited post authorization safety data for BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) are currently 
available (post-authorization safety data for BNT162b2 Bivalent [Original/Omicron BA.4-5] in 
individuals 5 years of age and older was previously submitted). Based on available clinical study data, 
the safety profile for Omicron-modified vaccine is expected to be similar to the safety profile of 
BNT162b2. The MAH will continue to monitor all emerging post authorization safety data for BNT162b2 
Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) for pharmacovigilance and risk management purposes. 
MAH Conclusions 
Given the antigenic differences in currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the original 
wild-type strain, uncertainties in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the genetic and antigenic 
characteristics of future variants, an updated vaccine composition that contains both index virus and 
Omicron (the most antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 VOC to date) may provide a broader antibody 
response against circulating and emerging variants, while retaining cross-reactive immunity and cross-
protection from severe illness caused by other VOCs.  
Overall, in paediatric clinical study participants from Study C4591048 Substudy D (Group 2), the 
reactogenicity profile within 7 days after BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) vaccine was 
generally similar in severity, with lower frequencies reported, compared to those previously observed 
in association with primary and booster (third) doses of the original BNT162b2 vaccine within the 
respective age groups. Overall, in clinical study participants ≥12 years of age from Study C4591044 
(Cohort 2 and Cohort 2 [Groups 2 and 4] and Cohort 3 combined), the reactogenicity profile within 7 
days after BNT162b2 bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) was generally similar to that previously 
observed in association with booster doses of an Omicron BA.1-modified BNT162b2 bivalent vaccine 
and to the original BNT162b2 vaccine within the respective age groups. Analysis of immunogenicity 
data from C4591044 Cohort 2 (≥12 years of age) and Cohort 2 (Groups 2 & 4) & Cohort 3 (Groups 1 & 
2) combined (≥18 years of age) for BNT162b2-experienced participants who received a booster (fourth 
dose) with BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) 30 or 60 μg demonstrated a robust immune 
response against Omicron BA.4/BA.5. Superiority and noninferior statistical hypothesis testing of 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) compared with BNT162b2 30 μg suggest that BNT162b2 
Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) will provide improved clinical benefit against COVID-19, particularly 
with respect to the immune response elicited against Omicron BA.4/BA.5. 
Real-world data have shown that after vaccination with BNT162b2, in the presence of the now-
predominant Omicron variant, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 is lower and 
wanes more quickly compared to prior variants. In time periods predominated by BA.4/BA.5 
sublineages, real-world studies indicate that 2 or 3 doses of monovalent mRNA vaccines may offer 
significantly reduced levels and duration of protection against COVID-19 outcomes, including severe 
endpoints like hospitalization, and less severe endpoints such as emergency department visits, urgent 
care, and outpatient visits, compared to protection against prior variants and sublineages. A bivalent 
Omicron variant-modified vaccine addresses this urgent unmet need to improve vaccine protection 
against Omicron BA.4/BA.5 and future variants, with previously demonstrated broad protection against 
the original (WT) SARS-CoV-2 strain and prior variants (until emergence of Omicron), now with 
addition of specificity for Omicron BA.4/BA.5. Primary vaccination with the bivalent vaccine formulation 
is expected to elicit a broad immune response in individuals who have not yet been exposed to, or 
vaccinated against, SARS-CoV-2. This expectation is supported by clinical data as well as recent real-
world studies from the US, Israel, Nordic countries (ie, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden), and 
the UK describing bivalent vaccine protection against currently circulating Omicron sublineages. These

studies show that vaccination with bivalent mRNA booster vaccines is associated with increased 
protection against symptomatic and severe illness, with higher effectiveness seen against more severe 
outcomes such as hospitalization, relative to (original) monovalent-only mRNA vaccination among 
individuals ≥ 5 years of age, including those 5 to 11 years of age, and ≥12 years of age. Two of these 
studies (one published and one preprint), both conducted in the US, reported that bivalent boosters 
were more effective than monovalent boosters among individuals 5 to 11 years, and 12 years and 
older, during periods in which recent Omicron sublineages, including BA.5, BQ.1/BQ.1.1, and 
XBB/XBB1.5, were prevalent. In addition, at the VRBPAC held on 26 January 2023, the CDC reported 
that relative effectiveness of bivalent mRNA boosters against symptomatic illness among adults ≥18 
years of age was similar for BA.5-related and XBB/XBB.1.5-related COVID-19.  
Implementation of a dosing regimen that uses the bivalent vaccine formulation for primary vaccination 
is anticipated to provide both clinical and practical benefits. Primary vaccination with bivalent vaccines 
is expected to elicit a broad immune response in individuals who have not yet been exposed to, or 
vaccinated against, SARS-CoV-2. From the practical perspective, in the current landscape where 
multiple vaccine formulations are in use, moving to a single vaccine formulation for COVID-19 
immunization reduces operational complexity as practitioners and pharmacies no longer need to stock 
multiple formulations, and may reduce vaccine administration errors due to the complexity of the 
number of different vial presentations. Reduced complexity is expected to facilitate clearer 
communication, which could lead to improved vaccine uptake and compliance. 
In summary, the available clinical data from the COVID-19 vaccine program collectively support 
approval of a 2-dose primary series with BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at the 10 μg or 
30 μg dose level in children 5 to 11 years of age (10 μg) and in adolescents/adults ≥12 years of age 
(30 μg), which is reasonably anticipated to have a similar safety profile (ie, reactogenicity and AEs) 
and similar or better effectiveness (ie, antigen specific neutralizing antibody response) in the current 
epidemiologic setting compared to the approved original BNT162b2 vaccine. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
With the aim to support the use of the bivalent COVID-19 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine 
administered as a primary series at 10µg (5+5µg) for subjects aged ≥5 to <12 years and at 30µg 
(15+15 µg) in subjects ≥12 years of age, data from two studies (C4591048 substudy D and 
C4591044) have been presented where these vaccines have been administered as a booster dose to 
each age group. The studies are described separately below. No data has been provided where the 
bivalent vaccine has been used as primary series. 
BNT162b2 bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 5+5 µg in subjects aged ≥5 to <12 years 
Study C4591048 Substudy D (group 2) is an open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and 
immunogenicity of a fourth dose of the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 5+5 µg in 
participants ≥5 to <12 years of age who have received 3 prior doses of BNT162b2 Original at 10 μg. 
Data cut-off was 25 November 2022. Up to the cut-off date, 113 subjects aged ≥5 to <12 years 
received the bivalent vaccine as a fourth dose. Median time between dose 3 (of BNT162b2 Original 
10µg) and dose 4 was 154 days and median time for follow-up was 1.6 months. 
Reactogenicity: Pain at injection site (64%) was the most frequent reported local reaction, followed by 
redness (7%) and swelling (5%) when the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 5+5µg was 
administered as a fourth dose. The majority of the reactions were mild to moderate in severity, no 
grade 4 reaction was reported. Fatigue (41%) was the most commonly reported systemic event 
followed by headache (25%) and muscle pain (14%) when the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication  
EMA/355553/2023  
Page 93/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5+5µg was administered as a fourth dose. Fever was noted in 5% of the subjects of which two of them 
reported a body temperature >38.9°C to 40°C, but none of them reported a body temperature >40°C. 
Antipyretic or pain medication use was reported by 23% of the participants. 
BNT162b2 Original at 10µg administered as a third dose (booster dose) to subjects aged ≥5 to <12 
years was evaluated in EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0129 procedure where 400 subjects received dose 3. 
That evaluation also included a comparison of the safety results between the previously administered 
primary series and the third dose in the same study population (study C4591007). In this study, pain 
at injection site (74%) was the most commonly reported local reaction after dose 3 (78% dose 1; 72% 
dose 2). Fatigue (46%), followed by headache (34%) was the most commonly reported systemic 
reaction after dose 3. In general, the safety results obtained after dose 3 were in line with what had 
been seen after the primary series. It was however noted that antipyretic pain medication was used by 
31% after dose 3, which was a higher frequency compared to dose 2 (22%) and dose 1 (13%). The 
frequency of fever was not higher after dose 3 (9% dose 2; 7% dose 3), but a slightly increase of 
reported headache (30% dose 2; 34% dose 3) and muscle pain (13% dose 2; 18% dose 3) could be 
an explanation for the higher use of antipyretic pain medication after dose 3.  
Taken together, in this limited study population of 113 subjects, the frequency and severity of reported 
local reactions and systemic events appears to be in line with what has previously been seen in 
another study where primary series as well as a third dose were evaluated.  
Up to the cut-off date, AEs were reported in four (3.5%) subjects. One subject reported an AE which 
was considered related to vaccination (lymph node palpable), one subject reported a severe AE (flu 
infection) and the other two reported AEs were otitis media and sore throat. No immediate AEs, SAEs, 
or AEs leading to withdrawal were reported up to the cut-off date. Lymphadenopathy is already 
included in the product information of the vaccine. No new safety concern was detected in this 
population of 113 subjects. 
BNT162b2 bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 15+15 µg in subjects ≥12 years of age 
This study was previously evaluated in EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0147 procedure with a cut-off date 12 
Sept 2022 and in EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/059.1 procedure with similar cut-off date (12 Oct 2022) as 
in this application. 
Study C4591044 Cohort 2 included 528 subjects aged ≥12 years who received a fourth dose of 
bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at either 30µg (12-17 years) or at either 30µg/60µg (≥18 
years). All subjects except one had a duration of follow up of ≥ 1 month <2 months after study 
vaccination. 
Reactogenicity: The most reported local reaction was pain at the injection site (56-94%), with the 
highest frequency (94%) reported in the group 18-55 years of age that received the bivalent vaccine 
60 μg, in this group was also reported one event of severe redness. One severe event of pain at the 
injection site was reported among subjects aged 12-17 years that received the bivalent vaccine 30 μg. 
Except for those severe events, the reported local reactions were mild to moderate in severity. Among 
the adult subjects, a slightly higher frequency of moderate events was reported among the subjects 
that received 60 μg compared to 30 μg. Fatigue was the most commonly reported systemic event (39-
76%), followed by headache (30-50%), muscle pain (20-42%) and chills (12-27%). The lowest 
frequency was reported among the subjects aged >55 years that received 30 μg. Most of the events 
were mild to moderate in severity. Fever was reported in 5-14% of the subjects, the highest frequency 
was reported among subjects aged >55 years that received 60 μg. Severe events of fever (i.e., >38.9 
to 40oC) were reported in one subject in the age group 12-17 years; two subjects in the age group 18-
<55 60 μg and two subjects in the age group >55 years 60 μg. 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication  
EMA/355553/2023  
Page 94/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the reactogenicity data from subjects >12 years of age included in this cohort where only the 
bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine was administered at doses of 30 or 60 µg, supports the trend 
noted earlier among subjects receiving 30 vs 60 µg as original or bivalent formulations: a higher dose 
results in a higher frequency and a slightly higher severity of reactogenicity events. Furthermore, older 
subjects report lower frequency of local and systemic events compared to younger subjects. 
Any AE was reported in 3-8% of the age groups, most of the events were related to reactogenicity. 
There were no events of death reported and no discontinuations due to AEs from study vaccination up 
to one month after vaccination. One SAE of dyspnoea was reported 15 days after vaccination in a 
participant between the age of 70 and 80 who received the bivalent 30 µg vaccine. Because of the TTO 
of 15 days, it can be agreed with the investigator that the event was not considered related to the 
vaccine.  
No events of anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity, appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, myo/pericarditis were reported up 
to 1 month post vaccination. Two events of lymphadenopathy were reported, however 
lymphadenopathy is already listed as an adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC. No new safety 
concern was identified in this study population.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Two studies have been presented where the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine has 
been administered as a fourth dose. One study included 113 participants aged ≥5 to <12 years that 
received a dose of 5+5 µg and the other study where the fourth dose was administered at 15+15 µg to 
subjects aged ≥12-17 years and at 15+15µg or 30+30 µg to subjects ≥18 years of age (n=528). 
Among the subjects that received either 30 or 60 µg, a clear trend to higher reactogenicity with higher 
dose was noted. The frequency of local and systemic events was overall in line with what was 
previously reported in studies where the BNT162b2 original 30 µg was administered as primary series 
or third dose. 
From a safety perspective, this suggests that the bivalent vaccine could be used as a primary series at 
the proposed dose of 15+15µg in subjects aged ≥12 years of age. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The currently valid RMP is version 9.0, which was approved in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0147 on 10 November 2022 and is a consolidated EU RMP version that merges 
RMP v 7.2 and 8.0 and addresses the PRAC preliminary assessment request to remove Myocarditis and 
Pericarditis, and Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) including Vaccine-associated enhanced 
respiratory disease (VAERD) as safety concerns in study C4591048. 
Following the Renewal approval with cMA conversion to standard MA (R-0137, EC decision: 10 October 
2022), C4591001 and C4591007 are re-classified from category 2 to category 3 studies. 
Milestones changed for studies C4591030 and C4591048; new milestone added for protocol 
amendment 2 of study C4591044.

Summary of planned additional PhV activities from RMP 
The MAH amended the following text (added text in green, deleted text in strike-through): 
The MAH proposes 20 22 studies, of which 5 global, 5 6 in Europe only, 7 8 in US only, 2 in US and 
Canada and 1 in New Zealand/Australia. There are 9 interventional studies (C4591001, C4591007, 
C4591015, BNT162-01 Cohort 13, C4591024, C4591031, C4591044, C4591048 and 1 study for 
vaccine interactions), 3 Low-Interventional studies (C4591036, WI235284 and WI255886) and 8 10 
non-interventional studies (7 9 safety and 1 effectiveness). 
Besides a few editorial changes, the RMP tables summarising On-going and planned additional 
pharmacovigilance activities remain unchanged [and are not reproduced here]. 
The two newly added Non-interventional studies are: 
Study C4591051 is a Comirnaty Original /Omicron BA.4-5 safety surveillance study to be 
conducted using secondary data from administrative claims and electronic health records 
from data research partners participating in the US Sentinel System. 
Study C4501052 is a Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 and Comirnaty Original /Omicron BA.4-5 
safety surveillance study conducted in collaboration with University Medical Center Utrecht 
on behalf of Vaccine Monitoring Collaboration for Europe Consortium research team VAC4EU 
and based on the master surveillance protocol.

*Category 1 studies are imposed activities considered key to the benefit risk of the product. 
Category 2 studies are Specific Obligations in the context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances under Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004 or in the context of a conditional marketing 
authorisation under Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004. 
Category 3 studies are required additional PhV activity (to address specific safety concerns or to measure 
effectiveness of risk minimisation measures) 
Note that the protocol synopses for these two PASS have already been assessed and accepted 
previously in separate procedures, i.e. EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/062 [C4591052] and 
EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/064 [C4591051]. Assessment of the full study protocols is currently ongoing. 
Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
PRAC, having considered the data submitted, is of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation 
PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
PRAC also considered that routine PhV remains sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures. 
2.6.3.  Plans for post-authorisation efficacy studies 
Not applicable. 
2.6.4.  Risk minimisation measures 
Routine Risk Minimisation Measures 
No changes are proposed. This is accepted. 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Not applicable. 
Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
PRAC having considered the data submitted was of the opinion that: 
the proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indication(s). 
Part VI Summary of the risk management plan 
PRAC concludes that the updates are administrative and acceptable.

The elements for a public summary of the RMP do not require revision following the conclusion of the 
procedure. 
2.6.5.  Conclusion on the RMP 
After the PRAC meeting, the MAH took the opportunity and submitted RMP version 10.0, merging 
versions 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4 of the RMP submitted and reviewed with this procedure, procedure X180, 
and II177, and implementing an agreed 6 months delay for interim report of study C4591007. The 
CHMP considered that the risk management plan version 10.0 is acceptable.  
2.7.  Update of the Product Information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
As a consequence of the update of the ATC code, section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated.  
As a consequence of the simplification of the posology, sections 4.2, 4.4, 6.6 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.7.2.  Labelling exemptions 
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the 
flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 vaccines 
(EMA/689080/2020 rev.1, from 16 December 2020) document which aims at facilitating the 
preparedness work of COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing 
packaging activities.  
• English-only labelling (inner and outer label/carton) and package leaflet* (from start of supply until 
end 2023). 
• Without country-specific information, such as blue box requirements (from start of supply until end 
2023). 
All MSs (with one exception: Poland**) have agreed to extend the current derogations until the end of

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns the extension of the indication of the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5), currently only indicated as a booster, to a two dose primary series for children 5-11 years 
of age (10 µg) and adolescents/adults ≥12 years of age (30 µg).  
There are no vaccine efficacy data included in the application; the evaluation is solely based on 
immunogenicity, along with a scientific argumentation of extrapolation. There are no data submitted 
investigating the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) as a primary series in any age group: 
the evaluation is solely based on extrapolation from booster studies where the product was given as 
the fourth dose.  
The ETF has previously concluded that the bivalent formulation may be used for primary vaccination 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/etf-concludes-bivalent-original-omicron-ba4-5-mrna-vaccines-
may-be-used-primary-vaccination) on the basis of non-clinical studies and data on the immune 
response following natural infection with Omicron BA.4/5. The data suggested that primary vaccination 
with the bivalent formulation should give rise to a broad immune response in unvaccinated people and 
that the safety profile would be comparable to the original vaccine (based on booster studies) . 
In accordance with the recommendations from the EMA statement on updating COVID-19 vaccines 
composition for new SARS-CoV-2 virus variants 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/ecdc-ema-statement-updating-covid-19-vaccines-
composition-new-sars-cov-2-virus-variants_en.pdf), the vaccine posology has been simplified for all 
approved formulations. 
3.2.  Therapeutic Context 
3.2.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic virus that first emerged as a human pathogen in China 
and has rapidly spread around the world by human-to-human transmission. 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication  
EMA/355553/2023  
Page 101/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is noteworthy that the virology of the disease is still steady changing, with new SARS-CoV-2 variants 
overtaking previous ones epidemiologically. This has also implications for vaccine prophylaxis as 
certain variants display evasion against both naturally and vaccine-acquired immunity. 
3.2.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
While care for individuals who have COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, vaccination is the 
most effective medical countermeasure to decrease risk of disease.  
The majority of the global population has either received COVID-19 vaccination or been exposed to the 
virus. The need for primary vaccination is considerably smaller than previously, but there is still 
demand for a vaccine that can be used for primary vaccination. The original Comirnaty is still available, 
however it may be more appropriate to use variant adapted vaccines also for primary vaccination. 
There is currently no Omicron vaccine approved for primary vaccination in any age group.  
3.2.3.  Main clinical studies 
Two studies have been presented where the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 has been 
administered as a fourth dose to subjects aged ≥5 to <12 years and ≥12 years of age.  
Study C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 (≥5 to <12 Years of Age): Booster (Fourth Dose) with 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 10 μg 
Substudy D is an open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a fourth 
dose of the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4-5) at 5+5µ in participants ≥5 to <12 years of age 
who have received 3 prior doses of BNT162b2 Original at 10 μg. Data cut-off was 25 November 2022. 
Safety data is available for 113 subjects, at the cut-off the median follow-up time for safety after 
vaccination was 1.6 months. 
Study C4591044 Cohorts 2 (≥12 Years of Age) and 3 (≥18 Years of Age): Booster (Fourth 
Dose) of BNT162b2 Bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) at 30 or 60 μg 
This study was previously evaluated in EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0147 procedure with a cut-off date 12 
Sept 2022 and in EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/059.1 procedure with similar cut-off date (12 Oct 2022) as 
in this application. 
The safety population in this study (cohort 2) included 528 participants ≥12 years of age who received 
a fourth dose of BNT162b2 bivalent (Original/Omicron BA.4-5) 30- or 60-μg. Median duration of follow-
up after vaccination was 1.5 months. 
3.3.  Favourable effects 
A substantial increase in GMT to Omicron BA.4/5 and the reference strain is seen after the bivalent 
BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) is administered as a booster in all the investigated age groups.  
The superiority criterium for BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) in neutralization of Omicron 
BA.4/5 in comparison to the original BNT162b2 in the age group >55 years were met: GMR 2.91 (2-
sided 95% CI: 2.45, 3.44). The non-inferiority criterium for the product were also met with regards to 
the anti-omicron BA.4/5 seroresponse rate in the age group >55 years.  
The secondary immunogenicity objective to show noninferiority of the anti–reference-strain immune 
response induced by BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) relative to the anti–reference-strain 
immune response elicited by BNT162b2 in the >55-age group was also met. The MAH also showed 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication  
EMA/355553/2023  
Page 102/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
non-inferiority in anti-omicron BA.4/5 GMR and seroresponse rate in the 18-55 years of age compared 
to the >55 years group in participants who received the bivalent vaccine.  
Considering that: 
•  Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 has demonstrated superior immune responses to BA.1 and 
non-inferior responses to the reference strain 
•  Any bivalent original/variant vaccine is considered to have similar characteristics as the 
Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine 
•  Booster responses of the same magnitude can be extrapolated to primary vaccination 
•  No primary vaccination data will be available 
• 
• 
It is likely that primary vaccination with a vaccine covering currently circulating strains is 
superior against these, compared to primary vaccination with the original vaccine 
In the dose-finding study C4591001 for the original formulation, it was shown that 10 µg of 
mRNA encoding the spike antigen elicited a somewhat comparable response as the 30 µg 
formulation in healthy adults 
The use of a primary vaccination schedule for the bivalent vaccine is deemed to be sufficiently 
substantiated.  
In summary, it is reasonably likely that a primary series with the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi 
BA.4/BA.5) will yield a better or comparable immune response as the original formulation against the 
strains investigated. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no submitted data investigating the bivalent BNT162b2 (Original/Omi BA.4/BA.5) as a 
primary series in any age group.  
There are no vaccine efficacy data included in the application; the evaluation is based on 
immunogenicity. 
There is no established serological correlate of protection. Therefore immunobridging to a vaccine 
regimen known to provide protection is used to estimate efficacy.  
The effect is estimated by extrapolation from booster studies, where a single dose of the bivalent 
vaccine was administered. In the age group 12-17 years there is a lack of an active comparator. 
Although, in the age group 5-11 years, the bivalent vaccine does not perform substantially better than 
the original formulation with regards to neutralization of Omicron BA.4/5 or the reference strain, the 
comparator group was imported from a previous study and thus the comparison is not optimal due to 
different number of doses received by the participants as well as a continuously changing epidemiology 
and virology of the disease.  
The validity of the comparison of the bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 to the original or 
Original/Omicron BA.1 was questioned, as it was not clear why the BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI 
BA.4/BA.5) performed better with regards to neutralization and seroresponse rate for Omicron BA.1 
and the reference strain in comparison to the other two formulations. The MAH explained that linear 
regression model-based analysis adjusting the baseline neutralising titre level has been used to 
overcome the problem with incomparable historic control. GMR originates from model based GMT 
calculation, which is considered as an intermediate estimate in order to reach a more valid and 
meaningful model-based GMR. 
Assessment report on group of variations including an extension of indication  
EMA/355553/2023  
Page 103/108 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moreover, it is noteworthy that when the immunogenicity of the bivalent vaccine against new variants 
in participants >55 years of age (n = 36) was investigated, the results were diverse. While a 
reasonable increase in neutralizing titers were observed against Omicron BA.4.6 1 month post-
vaccination, the effect against BQ.1.1, BA.2.75.2 and XBB was very low. Although these in vitro 
analyses do not represent the full immune response elicited in vivo, which is likely more potent, it was 
noted that the neutralization effect against emerged variants is reduced. 
3.5.  Unfavourable effects 
In study C4591048 Substudy D group 2 where 113 subjects aged ≥5 to <12 years received 
BNT162b2 bivalent Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at 5+5 µg as a fourth dose, the reactogenicity appears to 
be in line with what was previously identified where BNT162b2 Original at 10 µg was administered as 
primary series and dose 3 (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0129 procedure). When the bivalent vaccine was 
administered as a fourth dose, the most commonly reported local reaction was pain at injection site 
(64%) and the most commonly reported systemic events were fatigue (41%), headache (25%) and 
muscle pain (14%). 
In study C4591044 that included 528 subjects aged ≥12 years (cohort 2), a fourth dose of bivalent 
BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 at either 30µg (12-17 years) or at either 30µg/60µg (≥18 years) 
was administered to the participants. The most reported local reaction was pain at injection site (56-
94%), with the highest frequency (94%) reported in the group 18-55 years of age that received the 
bivalent vaccine 60 μg. Fatigue was the most commonly reported systemic event (39-76%), followed 
by headache (30-50%), muscle pain (20-42%) and chills (12-27%). There was a clear trend among 
subjects receiving 30 vs 60 µg that a higher dose results in a higher frequency and a slightly higher 
severity of reactogenicity events. Furthermore, older subjects report lower frequency of local and 
systemic events compared to younger subjects. 
3.6.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data for BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccine at 5+5 µg and at 15+15 µg is only 
available when administered as a fourth dose. None of the age groups has received the bivalent 
vaccine as a primary series.

3.8.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.8.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The benefit of the product is the induction of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response, which is likely to 
protect against severe COVID disease. The original vaccine has proven highly effective in this regard, 
when used as a primary series. 
Based on the argument of extrapolation outlined above under “favourable effects”, it is considered 
reasonably probable that the variant adapted vaccines are also effective as primary vaccination. The 
currently submitted data are considered supportive. 
The known unfavourable effects at administration of the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
at 30 µg to subjects aged ≥12 years are considered acceptable in terms of reactogenicity. There are no 
new safety concerns based on the study conducted; however the study size did not allow detection of 
rare adverse events. The overall experience of Comirnaty variant vaccine safety has been previously 
reviewed. Strain composition has not been associated with any relevant differences in clinical safety. 
Therefore, safety may be extrapolated to the use of the bivalent vaccine for a primary series. 
3.8.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit/risk balance as primary series of the 10 μg formulation for children 5 to 11 years of age, 
and the 30 μg formulation for adolescents/adults ≥12 years of age, of the Comirnaty Original/Omicron 
BA.4-5 Vaccine is considered positive. 
3.9.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of the bivalent BNT162b2 Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations

concentrate for dispersion for injection and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 
micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection for use as primary vaccination course against COVID-19 in 
children aged 5 to 11 years and in individuals 12 years of age and older, respectively, based on interim 
results from studies C4591044 and C4591048. Study C4591044 is an interventional, randomized, 
active-controlled, phase 2/3 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
bivalent BNT162b RNA-based vaccine candidates as a booster dose in COVID-19 vaccine–experienced 
healthy individuals, while study C4591048 is a phase 1/2/3 master study to investigate the safety, 
tolerability, and immunogenicity of bivalent BNT162b2 RNA-based vaccine candidates in healthy 
children. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 10 of the RMP has also been submitted.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the product 
information. 
A.6: Change of the ATC Code of tozinameran, riltozinameran and famtozinameran from J07BX03 to 
J07BN01. 
In addition, the vaccine posology has been simplified for all approved formulations. As a consequence, 
sections 4.2, 4.4, 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the group of variations, amendments to Annexes I, IIIA and IIIB 
and to the Risk Management Plan are recommended.

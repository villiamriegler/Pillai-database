2. Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Emicizumab (also known as ACE910, RO5534262, and Hemlibra) is a H2L2 polypeptide structure 
consisting of two light chains and two heavy chains linked together by disulfide bonds. It is a humanised 
monoclonal modified immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody with a bispecific antibody structure produced 
by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Emicizumab bridges activated 
factor IX (FIXa) and factor X (FX) to restore the function of missing activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) that is 
needed for effective haemostasis. 
The product is presented as a liquid in a glass vial intended for subcutaneous injection, with the following 
presentations: 30 mg/1 mL, 60 mg/0.4 mL, 105 mg/0.7 mL and 150 mg/1 mL.  The proposed clinical dose 
is 3 mg/kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg once weekly. 
Hemlibra 30 mg/mL solution for injection and Hemlibra 150 mg/mL solution for injection were approved 
in the EU on 23 February 2018 and indicated for the routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients 
with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors.  
This application is submitted in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC to extend the 
indication to the Hemlibra Marketing Authorisation to include the routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes 
in adults and children with severe haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors. The application also 
includes data supporting an update of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Package 
Leaflet with two additional posology recommendations for adults and children with haemophilia A with 
and without factor VIII inhibitors.  
The final indication agreed at the CHMP is: 
“Hemlibra is indicated for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with 
• 
• 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with factor VIII inhibitors 
severe haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency, FVIII < 1%) without factor VIII 
inhibitors. 
Hemlibra can be used in all age groups.” 
The proposed posology consists of a loading dose of 3 mg/kg once weekly followed by a maintenance dose 
of either 3 mg/kg every two weeks or 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks, and from week 5 on 3 or 6 mg/kg. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical pharmacology section of the dossier has been submitted which incorporates a discussion 
on the evaluation of the prothrombotic potential of emicizumab and bypassing agent interactions. This is 
presented below along with the studies on the evaluation of the prothrombotic potential of emicizumab 
and bypassing agent interactions which were reviewed in the initial application. The MAH has made 
reference to the previous non-clinical development of emicizumab – as assessed in the context of the 
original MAA for Hemlibra - which included appropriate pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology 
studies and support this application.

2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Emicizumab (also known as ACE910, CH5534262, and RO5534262) is a humanized monoclonal modified 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody with a bispecific antibody structure produced by recombinant DNA 
technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Emicizumab bridges activated factor IX (FIXa) and 
factor X (FX) to restore the function of missing activated factor VIII (FVIIIa) that is needed for effective 
haemostasis. In patients with haemophilia A, haemostasis can be restored irrespective of the presence of 
FVIII inhibitors, as emicizumab shares no sequence homology with FVIII. The non-clinical pharmacology 
section of the dossier has been submitted including additional pharmacology information from the 
evaluations of the pro-thrombotic potential of emicizumab and bypassing agent interactions. This 
information supplements the previously reviewed studies on the pro-thrombotic potential of emicizumab 
and bypassing agent interactions. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Interactions with FVIII and Bypassing agents 
The commercial drugs currently available for treatment of haemophilia A are plasma-derived or 
recombinant FVIII and bypassing agents, rFVIIa and/or activated prothrombin complex concentrate 
(aPCC). Due to their mode of action, bypassing agents rFVIIa and aPCC have the potential to interact with 
emicizumab. As these agents might be given to emicizumab-treated haemophilia A patients as 
on-demand treatment for bleeding events, the potential pro-coagulant liability of concomitant use of 
these agents with emicizumab was investigated in vitro and in vivo. 
In vitro effects of emicizumab in combination with FVIII and Bypassing Agents 
The effects of emicizumab on the actions of FVIII and bypassing agents were investigated in a thrombin 
generation assay in human haemophilia A plasma.  For the combination of emicizumab and FVIII, 
thrombin generation was determined via activation of the intrinsic pathway with FXIa as the starting 
reagent. As the assay is very sensitive to the FVIII concentration, the measurements were performed at 
either pathologically low-FVIII concentration (0.01 and 0.1 IU/mL) or FVIII-concentration in the normal 
physiological range (1 IU/mL). Emicizumab alone or at low FVIII concentrations shortened the lag time 
and ttPeak and increased endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and peak height (Figure 1).

concentration of FVIII in hemophilia A plasma 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 10/180 
 
 
 
 
 
At FVIII concentrations of 1 IU/mL, emicizumab marginally shortened lag time and ttPeak, showed only 
weak increase of the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and had almost no effect on peak height, 
indicating that emicizumab competes with FVIII on FIXa-FX binding (Figure 2). 
Figure 2 
Effect of CH5534262 on thrombin generation in the presence of higher 
concentrations of FVIII (in the physiological range) in haemophilia A plasma 
For the combinations of emicizumab and rFVIIa or aPCC, thrombin generation was determined via 
activation of the extrinsic pathway with very low TF activity as the starting reagent. Under these assay 
conditions, emicizumab alone in the absence of rFVIIa further prolonged the lag time of haemophila A 
plasma at concentrations ≥ 100 µg/mL, suggesting that emicizumab itself may delay the thrombin 
generation starting time of FX-related reactions within the extrinsic coagulation pathway. This effect was 
also noted in the presence of low rFVIIa concentrations (0.5 µg/mL), while no negative interference with 
the extrinsic pathway activation of rFVIIa was seen at concentrations of 5 or 15 µg/mL rFVIIa. Although 
the addition of emicizumab in the presence of 0.5 µg/mL rFVIIa prolonged lag time, it did not affect ttPeak 
(Figure 3 A & B). However, emicizumab increased the ETP and peak height in the presence of rFVIIa, 
indicating that concomitant use of rFVIIa and emicizumab further enhanced thrombin generation during 
the propagation phase (Figure 3C & D). It is noted that the highest recommended dose of 270 µg/kg 
rFVIIa for on demand treatment of bleeds in haemophilia A inhibitor patients corresponds to a tested in 
vitro concentration of 5 µg/mL rFVIIa. 
For APCC, the maximum concentration tested, 0.5 IU/mL corresponds to an estimated clinical dose of 25 
IU/kg, which is lower than the minimum clinical dose. Emicizumab did not change the lag time, but 
shortened the ttPeak and increased the ETP and peak height in the presence of aPCC and thus 
significantly enhanced thrombin generation during the initiation and propagation phase (Figure 4).

The in vivo studies carried out in Cynomologus monkeys of emicizumab in combination with FVII and 
bypasssing agents demonstrate that the aPCC-emicizumab combination has a higher potential than 
rFVIIa-emicizumab to induce thrombosis when aPCC is administered at clinically established high doses 
and especially when repeat aPCC doses are administered. 
Thus, in this study, no thrombosis formation was seen with emicizumab as a single agent. The thrombus 
formation observed with rVIIa and aPCC alone appeared to be enhanced by the addition of emicizumab 
and was discussed further in the report submitted.  
No non-clinical studies in animal models with mild to moderate haemophilia have been conducted.  
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of emicizumab were studied in Cynomolgus monkeys. The monkey was identified 
as the most relevant species as it was shown to cross react with emicizumab. 
• 
Methods of analysis 
Concentrations of emicizumab in Cynomolgus monkey plasma were determined by an ELISA quantifying 
dual-binding-competent emicizumab as previously discussed in the initial MAA. 
• 
Absorption 
Repeat-dose studies dose studies in monkeys 
The toxicokinetics of two studies submitted are summarised below. These studies were submitted in the 
initial MAA and were therefore previously reviewed. Following once weekly administration to Cynomolgus  
monkeys at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg (formulated in 20 mmol/L histidine-aspartate buffer (pH 6.0) 
containing 150 mmol/L arginine aspartate and 0.5 mg/mL poloxamer 188), after the first and fourth dose, 
the back-extrapolated concentration immediately after IV injection (C0) and AUC0-7 increased in an 
approximately dose-proportional manner over the investigated dose range. Exposure values are 
presented in Table 1. C0 and AUC0-7 increased after the 4th dose with accumulation factors of 1.6 to 2.0 
and 1.9 to 2.6, respectively. Plasma emicizumab concentrations during the 4-week recovery period 
decreased gradually in all animals (individual t1/2 at 100 mg/kg: 14.9±18.9 days). No ADAs were 
detected.

Subcutaneous study  
Following once weekly SC administration of emicizumab at 1, 6, and 30 mg/kg to Cynomolgus  monkeys 
(formulated in 20 mmol/L histidine-aspartate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 150 mmol/L arginine aspartate 
and 0.5 mg/mL poloxamer 188), plasma emicizumab concentration and PK parameters were comparable 
to that of the 13-week toxicity study whereby increases in Cmax were approximately dose proportional 
and exposures increased upon repeated dosing. Exposure values are presented in Table 2. Cmax 
increased 2.8- to 4.2-fold in Week 13 and 2.8- to 6.0-fold in Week 26 of treatment relative to the first 
dose. Similarly, AUC0-7d increased 3.0- to 4.5-fold and 2.8- to 6.7-fold compared to Week 1 after the 
13th and 26th dose, respectively. The exposure in ADA-negative animals decreased with an apparent t1/2 
of 15.7 to 30.8 days. 
ADAs were detected in a total of 9 out of 30 (30%) animals treated with emicizumab; in three animals in 
the 1 mg/kg, two animals in the 6 mg/kg and one animal in the 30 mg/kg dose groups during the 
treatment period. During the recovery period, one additional animal in each dose group displayed ADAs. 
ADA-positive animals did exhibit a faster elimination of emicizumab and were therefore excluded from the 
toxicokinetic evaluation. In four ADA-positive animals, a complete loss of exposure was apparent based 
on the total dual target binding competent emicizumab assay. Titers ranged from 1 to 100,000, and 
highest titers were associated with faster emicizumab elimination. ADA-positive animals with an apparent 
loss of exposure tested positive for neutralising antibodies while samples from other animals could not be 
assessed for neutralizing activity due to circulating emicizumab concentrations shown to interfere with 
the characterisation test to determine neutralising activity.

2.2.4.  Toxicology 
Repeat dose toxicity 
4-week intravenous study 
Two toxicity studies have been submitted and are summarised below. These studies were submitted in 
the initial MAA and therefore previously reviewed. 
Emicizumab was administered to Cynomolgus monkeys aged 3 to 4 years at 0 (vehicle control), 10, 30, 
and 100 mg/kg [n=3/sex/group]) QW for 4 weeks (5 times in total). Two additional animals/sex in the 
control and at 100 mg/kg were monitored for a 4-week recovery period Vehicle solution consisted of 20 
mmol/L histidine-aspartate buffer containing 150 mmol/L arginine-aspartate and 0.5 mg/mL poloxamer 
188, pH 6.0 (excipients in line with those within the final product). The administration was conducted at 
a volume of 1.22 mL/kg and at a rate of 4 mL/min with a syringe pump. 
No emicizumab-related deaths or moribundity were observed. No emicizumab-related abnormalities were 
noted in clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, Holter electrocardiography, ophthalmoscopy, 
urinalysis, blood chemistry, necropsy, organ weight, histopathology, or plasma cytokine analysis in any 
animals.  In addition, no changes in reproductive organs of males and females were noted. 
A shortening of aPTT was noted in all groups treated with emicizumab during the treatment and recovery. 
This was attributed to the pharmacological properties of emicizumab.  
In 1 female at 100 mg/kg/week, peri-arteritis in several organs was found histopathologically, suggesting 
polyarteritis had developed in this animal. Several haematology and blood chemistry changes related to 
inflammation were also observed. However, these inflammatory markers tended to recover during the 
dosing period. The cause of the polyarteritis was unclear, but was considered to be incidental and not 
related to emicizumab based on the following reasons:(1) spontaneous polyarteritis with similar changes 
have been reported in Cynomolgus  monkeys; short report summarising historical data which reports 
incidence of polyarteritis in 2013: 6/841 males and 3/788 females, Porter et al. 2003]; (2) some of the 
abnormal clinical pathology values improved while emicizumab exposure was maintained; (3) this change 
only occurred in one female in this study (out of a total of 88 monkeys that received emicizumab in the 
general toxicity studies). 
Immune-mediated vascular injury such as that arising from type III hypersensitivity reaction involving 
immune complexes, is sometimes seen with biological therapeutics evaluated in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
An antibody response to a test article can result in the deposition of immune complexes, evident as 
granular deposits in arteries or in kidney glomeruli [Rojko et al. 2014]. No ADAs were detected in this 
female and there was no evidence for loss of exposure after repeated dosing. However, the possibility that 
polyarteritis observed in this one female given 100 mg/kg/week IV for 4 weeks is immune-mediated 
cannot be completely ruled out. 
The TK data are presented below.  Plasma concentrations of emicizumab decreased gradually during 
recovery but were still observed until 4 weeks after the last dose. ADAs were not detected in any animals 
during the dosing or recovery periods. 
26-week subcutaneous study 
Emicizumab was administered SC to sexually mature (4 to 6 years old at the start of dosing) Cynomolgus 
monkeys at 0 (vehicle control), 1, 6 and 30 mg/kg (n=5 animals/sex/group) QW for 26 weeks (27 times 
in total). Recovery was assessed in two animals/sex/group over 13 weeks 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 15/180 
 
 
 
 
No emicizumab-related deaths or morbidity were observed during the study. No systemic abnormalities, 
including disturbed menstrual cycle in females, were observed in the clinical signs, and no 
emicizumab-related abnormalities were noted in body weight, food consumption, electrocardiography, 
ophthalmoscopy, urinalysis, haematology, blood chemistry, sperm examination, testes size, or organ 
weight. 
Local injection site reactions were found in several emicizumab administration sites. Subcutis reddish 
patch at necropsy and haemorrhage/hemosiderin deposition with mononuclear cell infiltration, neutrophil 
infiltration, eosinophil infiltration, perivascular mononuclear cell/plasma cell infiltration, swelling of 
endothelium, edema and/or degeneration/necrosis of subcutis were observed histopathologically. These 
findings were reversible and not dose-related. 
In 1 male at 6 mg/kg/week, swelling of the injection sites was observed from Day 135 (after the 20th 
injection). The swelling was observed at the subsequent injection (21st injection) and treatment was 
stopped. ADAs were present at an extremely high titre in this animal, and the plasma drug concentration 
was very low after the third dose and BLQ at later time points. Because the emicizumab plasma 
concentration was very low/absent, early termination of this animal was not considered to impact the 
toxicological evaluation. Necropsy at Day 149 revealed subcutis dark reddish patch, edema, reddish 
change, thickening, and induration. Severe injection site reactions including acute necrotizing vasculitis 
and chronic vasculitis were noted histopathologically. These findings were consistent with an Arthus 
reaction, a local immune complex disease classified as type III hypersensitivity. Therefore, the 
inflammatory reaction at the injection sites was considered to be due to ADA-emicizumab complexes. 
ADA analysis showed that ADAs developed in one male and two females at 1 mg/kg/week, one male and 
one female at 6 mg/kg/week, and one male at 30 mg/kg/week during the treatment period. Plasma 
concentration of emicizumab decreased to BLQ in three animals at 1 mg/kg/week and one male at 6 
mg/kg/week, and ADAs in these four animals were found to have neutralizing activity in an ELISA-based 
characterization test. Samples from the remaining ADA-positive animals could not be assessed for 
neutralising capacity because of emicizumab concentrations which have been shown to interfere with the 
characterisation test. In the recovery period, ADAs newly developed in three additional animals (one male 
at 1 mg/kg/week, and one female each at 6 and 30 mg/kg/week) after Week 9. The ADA incidence did not 
impact the overall emicizumab exposure to a relevant degree and thus allowed establishment of the 
necessary exposure margins for SC administration of emicizumab in this 26-week toxicity study and 
validity of the study. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The relevance of the non-clinical no-effect exposures relate to those proposed clinically is summarised 
below. 
In the 26-week study, following the 26th subcutaneous administration of 30 mg/kg/week emicizumab in 
the monkey, mean exposure Cmax values observed were 1340 and 1370 µg/mL for males and females 
respectively; 1355 µg/mL combined (see Tables 3, 4 and 5). Mean exposure AUC0-7d values observed 
were 8680 and 8830 µg/mL for males and females respectively; 8755 d.µg/ml combined (see Tables 3, 4 
and 5).

2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Emicizumab is a recombinant bispecific monoclonal antibody produced by biotechnology. Emicizumab is a 
large protein with a molecular mass of approximately 146 kDa. Like all monoclonal antibodies, 
emicizumab is degraded by regular proteolytic mechanisms before excretion, hence no ERA is required 
(see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
A Manometric Respirometry Test according to OECD 301F under GLP quality assurance showed that 
formulated Emicizumab (including excipients) is readily biodegradable [Straub, 2010]. The biochemical 
oxygen demand (BOD) in the test, compared to the theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) for emicizumab 
and all excipients, corresponded to a minimum of 90% mineralisation at the end of the 10-day window. 
The total mineralisation for the active substance emicizumab (deducting the BOD for the excipients, 
which with the exception of Poloxamer 188 were shown to be readily biodegradable themselves [Straub, 
2010) corresponded to a minimum of 98% by day 28. In addition, the calculated removal determined as 
the decrease in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for formulated emicizumab was 99% by day 28. 
Comparing the removal percentages by BOD with the very similar figures obtained by reduction in DOC 
and chemical oxygen demand, strongly supports mineralisation by biodegradation of emicizumab as the 
removal mechanism [Straub, 2010].  
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 17/180 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, while emicizumab may normally be expected to be degraded by regular human protein 
metabolism, based on the attained ready biodegradability any emicizumab that might escape human 
metabolic degradation may be safely expected to be biodegraded in sewage works and surface waters. In 
addition, an inhibition control in the OECD 301F test, with sodium benzoate as a readily biodegradable 
reference substrate in addition to formulated emicizumab, showed no inhibition of biodegradation 
[Straub, 2010], hence no significant toxicity to activated sludge micro-organisms. 
Acute ecotoxicity limit tests with green algae (Desmodesmus subspicatus) were performed with 
emicizumab formulated solution under GLP. All three limit tests consistently showed no adverse effects at 
the only tested concentration of 100 mg/l nominal concentration relating to the active substance 
emicizumab. While these tests are only acute (except for the algae), they do underpin a low risk for 
unexpected aquatic ecotoxicity of emicizumab, particularly considering the rapid, far-reaching removal 
expected through biodegradation in sewage treatment. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The effects of emicizumab in combination with FVIII, rFVIIa or aPCC have been studied in in vitro 
thrombin generation assays in human haemophilia A plasma and in vivo in a model of venous stasis in 
normocoagulative Cynomolgus monkeys and in a venous stasis model of provoked thrombosis in 
FVIII-neutralised (haemophilia A model) Cynomolgus monkeys. 
For the combinations of emicizumab and rFVIIa or aPCC, thrombin generation was determined via 
activation of the extrinsic pathway with very low tissue factor activity as the starting reagent. Under these 
assay conditions, in the absence or in the presence of low concentrations of rFVIIa (0.5 µg/mL), 
emicizumab at ≥ 100 µg/mL, delayed the thrombin generation starting time of FX-related reactions within 
the extrinsic coagulation pathway.  However, emicizumab increased the ETP and peak height in the 
presence of rFVIIa (≤15 µg/mL), indicating that concomitant use of rFVIIa and emicizumab further 
enhanced thrombin generation during the propagation phase. 
Emicizumab did not change the lag time, but shortened the ttPeak and increased the ETP and peak height 
in the presence of aPCC and thus significantly enhanced thrombin generation during the initiation and 
propagation phase. In haemophilia A, the rate of FIX-catalysed FX activation is extremely low. It is 
increased in the presence of emicizumab, but the reaction rate is even further increased in the presence 
of elevated plasma concentrations of the aPCC components, thus promoting disproportionate 
haemostatic activity (a 2.6 and 5-fold increase in peak height and endogenous thrombin potential, 
respectively). Such an increased haemostatic potency for combinations of emicizumab with rFVIIa or 
aPCC versus emicizumab alone has also been suggested by the in vivo data generated in the Cynomolgus 
monkey: In a haemophilia A venous stasis model, no thrombosis formation was seen when emicizumab 
was administered alone as a single agent; however, the thrombus formation observed with rVIIa and 
aPCC alone appeared to be enhanced by the addition of emicizumab. It is noted that statistical analysis 
was not performed and in addition, the study was unable to completely address the differences in 
thrombosis risk given the slow clearance of aPCC. Nevertheless, it has been established that aPCC in 
combination with emicizumab has the highest interaction potential in terms of thrombin generation and 
thrombogenic risk; this has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The MAH identified that emicizumab has the potential to interact with aPTT diagnostic tests but has also 
highlighted a series of diagnostic tests that are not affected. Such assays should therefore not be used for 
monitoring patients treated with emicizumab. This has also been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 18/180 
 
 
 
 
The MAH stated that FVIII, or the bypassing agents rFVIIa and aPCC, may be given to 
emicizumab-treated haemophilia A patients, depending on their FVIII inhibitors status (or titer), as 
on-demand treatment for bleeding events. In an in vitro thrombin generation assay, the combination of 
emicizumab and low (0.01 or 0.1 IU/mL) FVIII showed greater peak height of thrombin than either agent 
alone, but emicizumab caused little to no increase in peak height above that seen with 1 IU/mL FVIII 
alone. rFVIIa in combination with emicizumab had a relatively small additive effect on thrombin 
generation, while in contrast, a disproportionate synergistic increase in thrombin generation with steep 
exposure-response curves was seen with aPCC-emicizumab combinations, indicating that increasing 
aPCC plasma concentrations significantly increase net haemostatic potency at clinical exposure levels of 
emicizumab. 
In a normo-coagulative Cynomolgus monkey venous-stasis model, a similar degree of thrombus 
formation was seen with single agent administration of emicizumab, rFVIIa, or FVIII, indicating that the 
addition of emicizumab to normal levels of endogenous FVIII has a similar potential for increased net 
haemostatic potential as the addition of FVIII. However, as mentioned previously, no evidence of 
spontaneous thrombosis has been observed during any of the toxicology studies in normocoagulative 
Cynomolgus monkeys. 
Pharmacokinetics 
In a 4-week toxicity study, following the intravenous administration of up to 100 mg/kg/week 
emicizumab in the monkey, the mean exposure values C0 and AUC0-7d observed were up to 3555 µg/mL 
and 15400 d.µg/ml, respectively. 
In a 26-week toxicity study, following the subcutaneous administration of 30 mg/kg/week emicizumab in 
the monkey, the mean exposure values Cmax and AUC0-7d observed were up to 1355 µg/mL and 8755 
d.µg/ml, respectively. 
Toxicology 
In the 4-week intravenous toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys, polyarteritis in the liver, pancreas, 
stomach, and spleen and related abnormal clinical pathology test results were observed in one female in 
the 100 mg/kg group after the third dose. The pathomechanism of the polyarteritis remained unclear and 
the finding was considered to be a spontaneous case of polyarteritis was based on reports of spontaneous 
onset of polyarteritis in monkeys in published literature and the fact that no similar finding was noted in 
any other monkey after treatment with emicizumab. The affected animal tested ADA negative and 
exposure assessment did not indicate an ADA response either. However, the possibility that the 
polyarteritis was immune-mediated cannot be completely discounted. The shortening of aPTT in all 
emicizumab-treated groups was attributed to the pharmacological action of emicizumab. 
In conclusion, no adverse effects were induced when emicizumab was intravenously administered once a 
week for 4 weeks up to 100 mg/kg. Therefore, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 
considered to be 100 mg/kg or more in males and females under the condition of this study. 
In the 26-week subcutaneous toxicity study, one male Cynomolgus monkey dosed with 6 mg/kg once 
weekly developed swelling/haemorrhage/vasculitis at the administration site and was prematurely 
necropsied on the day after the 22nd dose. Anti-emicizumab antibodies were detected in this animal prior 
to the third dose and reached very high titres from the seventh dose onward to the extent that plasma 
emicizumab concentrations were sometimes below the level of quantification. Histopathological 
examination of the administration site revealed acute necrotising vasculitis and chronic vasculitis 
associated with severe haemorrhagic changes. Based on the course of the swelling and the 
histopathological findings, the cause of the administration site swelling was deemed to be an Arthus

reaction (type III hypersensitivity) triggered by administration of a heteroprotein. In this study, the 
NOAEL of emicizumab was considered to be 30 mg/kg. 
A comparison was made between the exposure values (Cmax and AUC) obtained at the no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the 26-week toxicity study in monkeys subcutaneously administered 30 
mg/kg/week emicizumab and the clinical exposures in humans treated with doses of 1.5 mg/kg QW, 3 
mg/kg Q2W or 6 mg/kg Q4W. For the Cmax values, the safety margins for the 1.5 mg/kg QW, 3 mg/kg 
Q2W and 6 mg/kg Q4W doses were 25, 23 and 20, respectively. For the AUC values, the safety margins 
for the 1.5 mg/kg QW, 3 mg/kg Q2W and 6 mg/kg Q4W doses were 22, 11 and 5, respectively.  
Amendments were provided for the 4- week intravenous and 26-week subcutaneous toxicity studies in 
monkeys relating to error calculations. These amendments do not appear to alter the safety profile of 
emicizumab and are considered to be of minor importance. 
In accordance with the CHMP guideline for Environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for 
human use” [EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2], as the proposed product falls within the classification of 
a products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids as 
active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is not required. The 
experimental assessment of emicizumab confirms the general finding that biologics (protein and peptide) 
active pharmaceutical ingredients are biodegradable, show low acute ecotoxicity and therefore present no 
significant risk to the environment. Based on the above considerations, no formal ERA was submitted for 
the emicizumab Type II Variation which is considered to be acceptable. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data support the extension of indication of emicizumab (Hemlibra) for routine prophylaxis 
of bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with factor VIII 
inhibitors and severe haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency, FVIII <1%) without factor VIII 
inhibitors.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK characteristics in adult/adolescent patients and patients < 12 years of age with haemophilia A from 
Studies BH29992, BH29884, and ACE002JP were submitted with in addition results from two new pivotal 
studies (BH30071 and BO39182) in haemophilia A patients with or without FVIII inhibitors. The clinical PK 
of emicizumab was analysed using both descriptive, NCA, and a population PK based compartmental 
analysis. 
Study BH30071 
Study BH30071 (also known as HAVEN 3) is an ongoing randomized, multicenter, open label,Phase III 
clinical study in adult and adolescent patients (age ≥ 12 years) with severe haemophilia A (intrinsic FVIII 
level < 1%) without inhibitors against FVIII who previously received either episodic or prophylactic 
treatment with FVIII. The study was similar in design to Study BH29884. 
For all patients, pre-dose (trough) plasma concentrations of emicizumab were analysed descriptively by 
treatment arm, including arithmetic and geometric means, median, range, standard deviations, standard 
errors, and coefficients of variation. Since patients in treatment Arms A and D, and Arms B and Cemi 
received the same dosing regimen (i.e., loading doses of emicizumab at 3 mg/kg QW for 4 weeks followed 
by maintenance doses of 1.5 mg/kg QW (Arms A and D) or 3 mg/kg Q2W (Arms B and C), mean PK 
profiles are presented as two dose regimens (QW or Q2W). 
With the QW dosing regimen (Arms A and D), mean trough plasma emicizumab concentrations increased 
with weekly doses of 3 mg/kg to achieve 52.2 µg/mL at Week 5 (Table 3). Mean trough plasma 
concentrations between 50.8 and 60.5 µg/mL were maintained from Week 7 to Week 41 with weekly 
doses of 1.5 mg/kg. The mean concentration observed at Week 49 (59.5 µg/mL) was based on data 
collected in 3 patients only. 
With the Q2W dosing regimen (Arms B and Cemi), mean trough plasma concentrations of emicizumab 
increased with weekly doses of 3 mg/kg to achieve 50.9 µg/mL at Week 5. Mean trough concentrations of 
approximately 48 µg/mL were maintained from Week 7 to Week 41 with bi-weekly doses of 3 mg/kg. 
Overall, the variability was moderate (coefficient of variations of approximately 30 - 40%), with a range 
of individual trough plasma concentrations after Week 5 between 16.8 and 128 µg/mL after 1.5 mg/kg 
QW (Table 3) and between 12.0 and 103 µg/mL after doses of 3 mg/kg Q2W.

Study BO39182 
Study BO39182 (also known as HAVEN 4) is a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase III clinical 
study evaluating the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of emicizumab (6 mg/kg) administered Q4W in 
adult/adolescent patients with haemophilia A with or without inhibitors against FVIII. 
The study consists of two parts: a PK run-in part followed by an expansion part.  
In the PK run-in part, a full PK profile was measured in the first 6 enrolled patients during their first 4 
weeks of treatment to characterise the pharmacokinetics of dosing with emicizumab Q4W at an SC dose 
of 6 mg/kg. Intense PK sampling was performed after the first and second emicizumab dose 
administration, followed by a reduced PK sampling schedule from Week 9 to Week 21. After Week 21, 
sampling frequency was increased to characterise steady-state PK. 
The arithmetic mean plasma emicizumab concentration-time profile based on all samples collected up to 
the time of the CCOD (18 October 2017) is shown below. 
Figure 6: Mean plasma emicizumab concentration-time profile (PK run-in cohort) 
After administration of the first SC dose of emicizumab at 6 mg/kg, an arithmetic mean peak plasma 
emicizumab concentration (Cmax) of 32.3 μg/mL was reached at a median time of 6.95 days. The time to 
maximum concentration (Tmax) in individual patients ranged from approximately 4 to 7 days. 
Subsequently, emicizumab plasma concentrations declined in a mono-exponential manner with an 
arithmetic mean apparent terminal T1/2 of 31.3 days. Of note, estimates of lambda z (λz) dependent PK 
parameters (i.e., T1/2 , area under the concentration-time curve from time 0, extrapolated to infinity 
[AUC0-inf] and CL/F) were approximate and should be interpreted with caution as the sampling and 
dosing schedules did not allow a proper estimation of λz.

Study BH29992 
Study BH29992 (also known as HAVEN 2) is a multicenter, open-label clinical study in paediatric patients 
(< 12 years old or 12 - 17 years old and < 40 kg) with haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors. Patients 
received emicizumab prophylaxis at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg SC QW for the first 4 weeks, followed by 
maintenance doses of 1.5 mg/kg QW thereafter. 
Sixty - three patients received emicizumab prophylaxis at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg QW for 4 weeks 
followed by maintenance doses of 1.5 mg/kg QW. Mean trough plasma concentrations of emicizumab 
increased with QW administration to reach 52.7 µg/mL at Week 5. 
Thereafter, mean trough concentrations were maintained between 43.7 and 52.1 µg/mL with QW 
administrations of 1.5 mg/kg from Week 7 to Week 57. Overall, the inter-individual variability was 
moderate, with individual trough plasma concentrations in the range of 19.2 to 88.7 µg/mL at 
steady-state (from Week 7 to Week 57).

Study BH29884 
Study BH29884 (also known as HAVEN 1) is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase III clinical 
study enrolling patients aged 12 years or older with haemophilia A with inhibitors who previously received 
either episodic or prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents. The study evaluated prophylactic 
treatment with emicizumab at a loading dose of 3 mg/kg QW SC for 4 weeks, followed by maintenance 
doses of 1.5 mg/kg QW SC thereafter. The study was similar in design to Study BH30071. 
In the 4 treatment arms, all patients treated with emicizumab received the same dosing regimen (i.e., 4 
doses of emicizumab 3 mg/kg QW, followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg QW). As the PK profiles 
were similar across treatment arms, results are presented for all arms together as a single dose group. 
Mean trough plasma concentrations of emicizumab increased following 3 mg/kg QW administration to 
achieve 54.1 µg/mL at Week 5. Mean trough concentrations slightly above 50 µg/mL were maintained 
thereafter with weekly doses of 1.5 mg/kg. The apparent decline of mean trough concentration at Week 
85 is likely related to the small number of patients (n = 8) at this time point. 
The variability was moderate (coefficient of variations of approx. 30 - 40%); however, the range of 
individual trough plasma concentrations after Week 5 was 2.8 - 148 µg/mL.

Study ACE002JP 
Study ACE002JP is an ongoing Phase I/II open-label extension study in male Japanese patients aged ≥ 12 
years and < 60 years with severe congenital haemophilia A who completed Part C of Study ACE001JP. In 
Part C of Study ACE001JP, a total of 18 Japanese patients with haemophilia A (11 patients with inhibitors, 
7 patients without inhibitors) were enrolled. 
Plasma emicizumab concentrations increased over time with weekly administration in all groups. The time 
to plateau in plasma emicizumab Ctrough levels (steady-state) was approximately 12 weeks where an 
initial loading dose was given at the approximately 3-fold maintenance dose (0.3 and 1 mg/kg/week 
groups), and approximately 24 weeks where no initial loading dose was given (3 mg/kg/week group). 
Plasma emicizumab Ctrough levels at steady-state increased in a dose-proportional manner with mean 
(SD) of 10.3 (4.54) μg/mL and 29.9 (6.88) μg/mL at 12 weeks for the 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/week dose 
groups, respectively, and 120 (26.8) μg/mL at 24 weeks for the 3 mg/kg/week group.

The empirical Bayesian estimates from the final PK model per type of patient status (inhibitors or 
non-inhibitors) and per type of dosing regimens, respectively were presented which further confirm the 
absence of residual effects in the final model with respect to those covariates and their lack of impact on 
the primary PK parameters of Emicizumab.

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exploratory Graphical Analysis of Exposure-Efficacy 
Methods: Since the patients in Studies BH29884, BH29992, BH30071, and BO39182 were not treated for 
the same duration at the time of the data cut-off, two different categories of patients were defined for 
these graphical exposure-efficacy analyses: those who were treated for at least 12 weeks of treatment (N 
= 346) and those who were treated for at least 24 weeks of treatment (N = 279). 
Using the final population PK model, individual average concentrations (Cav) computed over the 
treatment period and individual predicted average trough concentrations over the period of maintenance 
doses (Ctrough,mean) were used as exposure metrics for the efficacy analyses. 
Results: The variability in exposure following the doses of 1.5 mg/kg QW, 3 mg/kg Q2W and 6 mg/kg 
Q4W, was found to contribute marginally to the variability in response. 
These data indicate that the dose of 3 mg/kg QW SC during 4 weeks followed by 1.5 mg/kg QW SC or 3 
mg/kg Q2W or 6 mg/kg Q4W provides emicizumab exposure that results in effective control of bleeding 
in a large majority of patients and that a lower dose might potentially lead to lower reduction.

concentrations and the following pharmacodynamic (PD) markers: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 
Thrombin generation (peak height) 
FVIII activity (chromogenic assay) 
FIX and FX antigen concentrations 
Results: Pharmacodynamic markers of coagulation were correlated with emicizumab plasma 
concentration: 
• 
aPTT was normalized at low concentrations ( ~ 5 ug/mL)

age, inhibitor status, or dosing regimen 
Median profiles of D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 appeared similar across categories of 
emicizumab exposure. 
Exploratory Graphical Analysis of Exposure-Safety Relationship 
Methods: Graphical analyses were performed to investigate whether the occurrence of safety events 
could be attributed to the variability in emicizumab exposure at the dose of 3 mg/kg QW SC for 4 weeks 
followed by 1.5 mg/kg QW SC, 3 mg/kg Q2W SC, or 6 mg/kg Q4W SC. 
Results: Results from the exposure-safety graphical analyses did not show any evidence of relationship 
between exposure and ISRs, or between exposure and the occurrence of thrombotic microangiopathy or 
thromboembolic events.

Exposure-Response Modeling of Bleeding Counts 
Methods: Six clinical studies were included in the analysis: ACE001JP(Part C)/ACE002JP, BH29768, 
BH29884, BH29992, BH30071 and BO39182. The study population consisted of 445 males in the age 
range from 1.22 to 77 years, and weights ranging from 9.5 to 156 kg. 
This report reflects an analysis of the population pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PopPKPD) of 
emicizumab via non-linear mixed effects methods while treating the bleeding event data as count data. 
Different distributions were considered to describe the count data, as well as different PKPD models to 
characterise the relationship between daily emicizumab concentration and the bleed frequency. Patient 
covariate relationships on the model parameters were examined in a stepwise procedure. 
Episodic/prophylactic treatment during observation period, patient type (with or without factor VIII 
(FVIII) inhibitors), body surface area (BSA), body mass index (BMI), body weight, factor IX (FIX) and

factor X (FX) concentrations, dosing regimen (once a week (QW), Q2W, Q4W) and baseline bleed 
frequency (where available) were included in the search procedure. The final model was qualified by 
numerical and graphical goodness of _t (GOF) checks, including visual predictive check (VPC). 
Simulations were performed using the final model in order to illustrate the estimated exposure-response 
relationship. 
Results: The patients receiving prophylactic FVIII before emicizumab had a lower baseline bleeding rate 
(i.e.: λ = 0.00515, relative standard error (RSE)=16.9 %) than the other patients (i.e: λ = 0.0258, 
RSE=8.6%).As a consequence of effective treatment with FVIII prophylaxis, the analysis consisted in 
consecutively characterizing two PKPD relationships for emicizumab: one to evaluate the additional effect 
of emicizumab in patients previously receiving prophylactic FVIII and another one to evaluate the genuine 
PKPD relationship of emicizumab in patients having baseline bleeding rate barely, or even not at all 
impacted by, previous treatment. In those patients, no statistically or clinically significant differences with 
regards to inhibitor and non-inhibitor, to episodic and prophylactic treatment and to the dosing frequency 
(QW, Q2W and Q4W) were found. 
Run3138 was defined to be the final model and its parameter estimates are summarised in the following 
table: 
Table 12: Parameters estimated for final model 
VPCs: As the observation time varies by patient, the total number of observations decreases with time 
and bin widths are adjusted accordingly.  
Dose-response simulations: The results of the simulation of the genuine exposure-response of 
emicizumab characterized in haemophilia A patients with baseline bleeding rate barely, if at all impacted 
by previous treatment (i.e. λ=0.0258) is given in Figure 15. A clinically meaningful bleeding control is 
expected to be reached at plasma emicizumab concentrations above approximately 30 _g/mL, and the 
benefit of higher concentrations appears to be limited. The mean concentration ranges under different 
regimens are also indicated.

Figure 17: Simulated specific exposure-response of emicizumab 
The PK/PD relationship in non-inhibitor patients with a low baseline bleeding rate due to their FVIII 
prophylactic (i.e. _=0.00515) is presented in Figure 16. This relationship does not reflect the genuine 
exposure response of emicizumab but the additional effect of emicizumab when the patients shifted from 
their previous efficacious FVIII treatment to emicizumab. Since the FVIII prophylaxis treatment 
continued during the first week after the start of emicizumab, there is an overlap in the efficacy when the 
concentration of emicizumab are still relatively low (i.e.: below the median emicizumab concentration at 
the end of the first week - 17.2 µg/mL). Above this value, indicated in Figure 16, the PKPD relationship of 
emicizumab becomes superimposable to the genuine one for emicizumab concentrations.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has included data from data from studies ACE001JP Part C/ACE002JP, BH30071, BO39182, 
BH29884, and BH29992 in the population PK model. The base model and covariates have both been 
re-assessed. The final population PK model is a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and 
elimination processes. Variability was minimal with the goodness-of-fit plots and VPCs being acceptable. 
Patient status (inhibitors or non-inhibitors) or type of dosing regimen (QW, Q2W and Q4W) were not 
significant covariates in the final population PK model. Body weight, age, race (White vs Black patients) 
and albumin were identified as retained covariates in the final model. Race and weight had minimal 
impact on steady state exposure. The model confirms that there are lower exposures in older (elderly) 
patients. Low albumin concentrations of 33 g/L (low) and 57 g/L (high) were associated with a Cav,ss 
reduction of 31% and increase of 23%, respectively. Body weight dosing appears to be appropriate for 
adults, adolescents (≥12 to <18 years) and children (<12 years) patients with haemophilia. The PK of 
emicizumab has been simulated for the different dosing regimens (QW,Q2W and Q4W) in paediatrics with 
steady state concentrations appearing comparable with the adult exposures.

adults, adolescents (≥12 to <18 years) and children (<12 years) patients with haemophilia. The PK of 
emicizumab has be simulated for the different dosing regimens (QW,Q2W and Q4W) in paediatrics with 
steady state concentrations appearing comparable with the adult exposures.  
The final Emax model appears fit for purpose with the different dosing regimens (1 .5 mg/kg QW, 3 
mg/kg/Q2W and 6.0 mg/kg Q4W) resulting in mean trough emicizumab concentrations being above 30 
µg/mL; this was similar for both inhibitor and non-inhibitor patients.  
Simulations from the population PK model suggest that the mean range of trough emicizumab 
concentrations are within the therapeutic window however the simulations based on the population model 
suggests that the lower limit of the 90% CI may be <25 µg/mL.   
Results from Study BH29884 and Study BH29992 demonstrate that emicizumab trough plasma 
concentrations are consistent across different ages. In healthy individuals, FVIII levels remain constant 
from birth through adulthood (Andrew et al. 1988; 1992), so in this respect the emicizumab levels are 
consistent with the physiologic lack of change of FVIII activity levels with age. The early physiologic 
maturation of FVIII levels (Kuhle et al. 2003) suggests that a given FVIII activity is expected to provide 
a similar safety and efficacy in adults and in children. 
Since the average dose is identical, each individual dose administered Q2W or Q4W is 2 or 4 times higher 
than each weekly dose, respectively (3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg versus 1.5 mg/kg). Hypothetically, a resulting 
higher Cmax may be associated with safety concerns.However, due to the slow absorption of 
emicizumab, the higher individual doses result in only modestly higher peak concentrations (Cmax). 
Modelling of emicizumab plasma-time concentration profiles shows that the 95th percentile of 
emicizumab concentrations at Cmax is estimated to be approximately 82.4, 85.9, and 97.7 μg/mL in the 
Q1W, Q2W and Q4W regimens, respectively. Thus, since the various regimens result in comparable Cmax 
and total exposures, the safety profile of QW emicizumab maintenance (as observed in Study BH29992) 
is representative of the safety profile in children receiving Q2W or Q4W emicizumab maintenance (see 
also Discussion on Clinical Safety). 
Further, it is of interest to consider the relative concentrations of emicizumab and its substrates FIX and 
FX whose plasma levels are approximately 90 and 150 nM, respectively. At Cmax, emicizumab 
concentrations correspond to 560 nM in the Q1W and to 700 nM in the Q4W regimens representing a 4-6 
or 5-7 fold higher molar concentration of emicizumab over its targets in the QW or Q4W regimens, 
respectively. Hence, the modestly higher emicizumab Cmax in the Q4W regimen results in a 
stoichiometrically inconsequential excess of emicizumab. In addition, given the weak binding affinities of 
emicizumab to FIX and FX and the corresponding Kd values that are higher than the Cmax at even the 
Q4W regimen, the peak emicizumab concentration has no physiologic impact on antigen blockade.

FVIII inhibitors. Results support comparable PK properties of the different maintenance dosing regimens. 
Simulations of the different proposed dosing regimens have been simulated in paediatrics and appear 
comparable with the adult exposures.

2.4.1.  Main studies 
Methods 
Overall Design Features of Pivotal and Supporting Studies 
Two new pivotal Phase III Studies BH30071 (HAVEN-3) and BO39182 (HAVEN-4) assessing the efficacy, 
safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of emicizumab prophylaxis in adults and adolescents ≥ 
12 years of age with haemophilia A are included in the current application: 
•  Study BH30071 is a randomized, controlled, open-label study in patients with severe haemophilia 
A aged ≥ 12yrs and without FVIII inhibitors, who previously received either episodic or 
prophylactic treatment with FVIII. 
•  Study BO39182 is a single-arm study in patients with haemophilia A aged ≥ 12yrs with or without 
FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic or prophylactic treatment with FVIII or 
bypassing agents. 
Updated information is provided from the 2 studies which supported the initial MA and which assess the 
efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of emicizumab prophylaxis: 
•  Study BH29884 (HAVEN -1) is a randomized, open-label Phase III study in patients aged ≥ 12 
with haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic or prophylactic 
treatment with bypassing agents. 
•  Study BH29992 (HAVEN-2) is a single-arm Phase III study, in children < 12 years of age, with 
haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic or prophylactic 
treatment with bypassing agents. 
Additionally, updated analyses from Study ACE002JP (an extension Phase I/II study to 
multiple-ascending dose Study ACE001JP) in Japanese patients with and without FVIII inhibitors, which 
provides long-term emicizumab efficacy and safety data is included. 
In addition, the MAH submitted during the evaluation of this application:  
•  An update to study BO39182 (HAVEN-4) 
• 
Initial data from an extra 33 paediatric subjects enrolled in to study BH29992 (HAVEN-2) and 
Japanese study JO39881 
Despite the above differences in study populations (adult and adolescent patients aged ≥ 12 years vs. 
paediatric patients < 12 years of age), previous haemophilia A treatment regimens (bypassing agents vs. 
FVIII), and differing emicizumab dosing regimens (QW, Q2W, and Q4W), the studies share important 
features. These include similar eligibility criteria; collection, definitions, and analyses of bleed data and 
bleed-related endpoints, as well as other efficacy endpoints, which allow for assessment of efficacy across 
these studies.

Inclusion criteria are summarised: 
Table 13: Haemophilia – related inclusion criteria for all studies in the efficacy population 
Emicizumab dose  
The recommended starting dose is 3 mg/kg QW for the first 4 weeks, followed by either 1.5 mg/kg QW, 
3 mg/kg Q2W, or 6 mg/kg Q4W, administered as an SC injection.  
The rationale for the selected Phase III dose regimens was based upon available clinical data from Study 
ACE001JP and its ongoing extension Phase I/II Study ACE002JP in haemophilia A patients with and 
without inhibitors. These studies investigated maintenance dose of 0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg/week and 
demonstrated a substantial reduction in bleeding events with prophylactic emicizumab treatment, 
especially at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg weekly, where a median ABR of 0 was achieved. A quantitative 
characterisation of the exposure-response relationship of emicizumab in these studies enabled 
identification of a target efficacious concentration [Yoneyama et al. 2017]. On the basis of population PK 
modelling, effective plasma concentrations were predicted to be achieved by loading doses of 3 mg/kg 
QW for 4 weeks followed by the maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg QW, 3 mg/kg Q2W, or 6 mg/kg Q4W. 
With a lower dosing frequency associated with a larger peak–trough fluctuation, a maintenance dose of 6 
mg/kg Q4W was predicted to result in a lower trough concentration than initially targeted. However, 
based on simulations, this was not predicted to impact the efficacy of emicizumab in preventing bleeding 
event, as indicated by simulated ABR distribution [Yoneyama et al. 2017]. 
Results from Phase III clinical studies confirmed the adequacy of the selected dosing regimens. Overall, 
all three dosing regimens, using an equivalent cumulative dose, provided meaningful efficacy with mean 
ABR of 2.7 (95% CI: 1.64, 4.35) (adolescent / adult patients with inhibitors), 1.5 (95% CI: 0.89, 2.47) 
(adolescent / adult patients without inhibitors) and 0.3 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.52) (paediatric patients with 
inhibitors) with QW dosing; 1.3 (95% CI: 0.75, 2.25) (adolescent / adult patients without inhibitors) with 
Q2W dosing; and 2.1 (95% CI: 1.11, 4.12) (adult / adolescent patients with or without inhibitors) with 
Q4W dosing. A median ABR of 0 was achieved and over 55% of patients achieved 0 bleed with all dose 
regimens.

EMA/125963/2019  
Page 45/180 
 
 
 
 
 
Graphical investigations of exposure-response relationship revealed that a similar PK exposure was 
observed across the ABR response categories (ABR = 0, ≥ 1- ≤ 4, or > 4). Although, a trend toward lower 
median emicizumab exposure was observed in patients with an ABR > 4, there was a large overlap of the 
PK exposure distributions by ABR category. Emicizumab exposure obtained with the three maintenance 
dose regimens (1.5 mg/kg QW, 3 mg/kg Q2W, 6 mg/kg Q4W) resulted in highly effective control of 
bleeding in a large majority of patients. On an individual level, however, higher exposure in patients who 
have suboptimal control of bleeding may be beneficial. 
Conclusions from the graphical investigations were further supported by a model-based analysis of the 
exposure - response, which indicated a relatively flat relationship between bleed rate (ABR) and 
emicizumab at concentrations above 30 µg/mL (Figure below). 
Figure 19: Simulated exposure-response relationship of emicizumab in haemophilia A 
patients  
A close to maximal effect on bleed rates is predicted for plasma emicizumab concentrations above this 
threshold, a concentration expected to provide FVIII activity associated with mild to moderate disease 
activity. Of note, trough concentrations (i.e., the lowest concentration during a dosing interval) above this 
value were achieved with all three dosing regimens use in the Phase III studies (Table below).

No clinical data in paediatric patients below the age of 1 year are available to date. Simulations of their 
exposure indicated that, while decrease in exposure is predicted, especially for the youngest patients (0 
to 3 months old), median trough concentrations remained greater than 30 µg/mL for both QW and Q2W 
dosing regimens (Figures below).

Median trough concentrations slightly below 30 µg/mL are predicted with Q4W dosing regimen in patients 
below 6 months of age (Figure 29), which could in theory lead to slightly lower efficacy at trough. 
Importantly, even at the expected trough concentration, emicizumab is expected to provide a FVIII-like 
activity of approximately 8- 10 IU/dL (based on an approximate conversion factor of 1 µg/mL of 
emicizumab to 0.3 IU/dL of equivalent factor VIII haemostatic activity derived from nonclinical data 
[Shima, et al. 2016]). Therefore, meaningful efficacy with all three dosing regimens is also expected in 
paediatric patients aged less than 1 year.

Q4W emicizumab SC doses: 
Exposure-safety analyses also supported the recommended dosing regimens. There were no patterns of 
dose response for AEs. ISRs, which were the most commonly reported AE, did not appear to be related to 
emicizumab plasma concentration. Median PK profiles in patients who developed ISR were not different 
from those of patient who did not developed ISR. Likewise, there were no evidence of a relationship 
between emicizumab exposure and the occurrence of TMA or thromboembolic serious adverse events 
(SAEs). Lastly, the exposure achieved with the recommending dosing regimen (3 mg/kg QW for 4 weeks 
followed by either 1.5 mg/kg QW, 3 mg/kg Q2W or 6 mg/kg Q4W) remained well below the safe and well 
tolerated exposure achieved at the maximum dose of 3 mg/kg weekly investigated in the Phase I/II 
studies.

the protocol) starting on Week 25 (Arms A and B) or Week 49 (Arm C), if they received approval from the 
Medical Monitor.  
Patients in Arm D who experienced ≥ 2 qualifying bleeds on prophylactic emicizumab at the maintenance 
dose had the opportunity to up-titrate their emicizumab dose to 3 mg/kg QW immediately after the 
second qualifying bleed, with approval from the Medical Monitor. 
Qualifying bleeds were defined as spontaneous, verified by investigator (e.g., by imaging or physical 
examination) and occurring while on prophylactic emicizumab at steady-state on the maintenance dose 
(after the Week 5 visit). 
Dose selection 
The maximum clinical dose of 3 mg/kg QW was associated with a 10.3-fold and 11.2-fold safety margin 
for Cmax and AUCt, respectively, based on corresponding exposures at the no-adverse-effect-level 
(NOAEL) in nonclinical toxicology studies. 
Dosing was also guided based on experience of study ACE002JP and PK population modelling. 
Previous Medications for Haemophilia A 
All patients reported receiving treatment with FVIII in the 24 weeks prior to enrolment: 
• 
as episodic treatment: all patients in Arms A, B, and C 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 51/180 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
as prophylactic treatment: all patients in Arm D. Additionally, 3 patients in Arm A, 5 patients in 
Arm B and 2 patients in Arm C reported, in addition to prior episodic treatment, prior prophylactic 
treatment with Factor VIII. 
The most prevalent reason given for not receiving prophylactic treatment prior to the study for patients in 
Arms A, B, and C was reported as subject request (42.4%). 
Concomitant Haemophilia A treatments 
Patients administered haemophilia A medication to treat breakthrough bleeds as they occurred, as 
treatment for procedure/surgery, or as one-time prophylaxis; the bleeds and the treatments were 
recorded on the BMQ using the electronic hand-held device. 
47.2% of subjects in Arm A and 48.6% Arm B, compared with all patients on no prophylaxis in Arm Ccontrol 
(100%), used FVIII treatment during the study, see table below; short acting FVIII was mostly used. 
Table 15: Summary of non-emicizumab haemophilia medication (ITT population) 
The proportion of patients using FVIII in Arm D was 84.1% because patients in Arm D continued their 
regular FVIII prophylaxis until the second emicizumab loading dose to avoid bleeds before adequate 
emicizumab level was reached.

Comparator 
Historical comparison was used, as described: 
Non-Interventional Study NIS BH29768 
This study enrolled patients with haemophilia A, particularly those with severe disease or inhibitors 
against Factor VIII, who suffer from bleeding episodes, which are treated with replacement or with 
bypassing agents. It was conducted in 12 countries at 33 sites. Patients who participated in NIS BH29768 
Cohort C and who met the eligibility criteria for this study could enrol according to their prior haemophilia 
treatment regimen.   
The primary objective was to document the number and type of bleeds in haemophilia A patients with or 
without FVIII inhibitors under routine clinical practice and to estimate the number of bleeds over time. 
The study has three cohorts (Cohort A – patients age ≥ 12 years; B – age 0-11 years both with inhibitors; 
C -patients age ≥12 years without inhibitors). 
The inclusion/ exclusion criteria were similar to those for the pivotal studies. 
The study prospectively documented the number and types of bleeds and treatments with episodic or 
prophylactic FVIII agents in a comparable manner to Study BH30071, and collected information on 
HRQoL, health status, and safety in patients with haemophilia A, including a cohort of adult and 
adolescent patients without FVIII inhibitors (Cohort C).  
The study design specified that at least 40 patients treated with FVIII prophylaxis and followed for a 
minimum of 24 weeks in the NIS were to be enrolled in Arm D of Study BH30071.  
In order to avoid introducing bias to the subsequent comparative analyses the inclusion criteria and 
methods of data collection and follow-up in this study were as similar as possible to those used in the 
emicizumab interventional studies. Patients were not randomized, and were treated according to their 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 53/180 
 
 
 
 
 
regular standard of care. Therefore, the treatment patterns and outcomes observed reflect real world 
experience. 
Data from NIS BH29768 served as historical control comparator in the analysis of several secondary 
endpoints in this study. 
In Cohort C (patients ≥ 12 years old with haemophilia A and without inhibitors to FVIII), all 94 patients 
enrolled were included in the analysis population: 45 patients in the episodic group and 49 patients in the 
prophylactic group. 
Patients were enrolled in the following countries: Australia, China, Costa Rica, Germany, Spain, Italy, 
Japan, Republic of Korea, United States of America, and South Africa. 
In Cohort C, 43 patients (95.6%) in the episodic group and 47 patients (95.9%) in the prophylactic group 
completed the study (Figure below). 
Figure 24: Patient disposition, Cohort C 
Two patients (4.4%) in the episodic group and 2 patients (4.1%) in the prophylactic group discontinued 
the study prematurely. The reasons for withdrawal (1 patient each) were death, loss to follow-up, 
non-compliance, and “other” (“other” was confirmed as another case of non-compliance). 
A total of 29 patients (64.4%) in the episodic group and 44 patients (89.8%) in the prophylactic group 
subsequently enrolled in Study BH30071. 
Both the median observation time and median efficacy period were 27.7 weeks (range: 15.4 - 47.7) in the 
episodic group and 30.4 weeks (range: 12.4 - 45.1) in the prophylactic group.  
The majority of patients (approximately two-thirds of patients in the episodic group and all but 1 patient 
in the prophylactic group) had an observation time and an efficacy period longer than 24 weeks, and no 
patient had an efficacy period shorter than 12 weeks. For the majority of patients, the study duration was 
driven by the time at which the patient enrolled in the interventional Study BH30071. 
Demographics are summarised in the following table:

Table 18: Type of haemophilia medication, cohort C 
The median number of short-acting FVIII doses was 24.5 (range: 1-109) in the episodic group and 94.0 
(range: 19-246) in the prophylactic group (table below) 
Table 19: Treatment with FVIII (short-acting), cohort C

The medican number of long-acting FVIII doses was 17.0 (range: 2-70) in the episodic group and 60.0 
(range: 28-85) in the prophylactic group (table below). 
Table 20: Treatment with FVIII (long-acting, cohort C: 
A total of 46 patients were included in the analysis of patient adherence to FVIII prophylaxis: 19 patients 
from Europe, 12 patients from the Americas, and 15 patients from Asia Pacific. These 46 patients were 
prescribed FVIII prophylaxis as concomitant medication with frequency category different than “other” at 
the start of the study and it lasted for at least 3 months. Of note, compliance during this NIS was a 
requirement to enter the prophylactic group of Study BH30071, which may have positively affected 
compliance rates. 
The median proportion of weeks when patients were adherent to their FVIII prescription frequency was 
86% (range: 20% - 100%). In total, 66.7% of patients had > 80% of weeks when they were compliant 
with their FVIII prescription frequency (i.e. received all prescribed doses). There were no noticeable 
differences in adherence between the geographical regions. 
Past medical history was most notably hepatitis C (13.3% and 30.6%, respectively) and chronic hepatitis 
C (4.4% and 6.1%, respectively) for the episodic and prophylactic groups. HIV infection was reported in 
4 patients (8.9%) in the episodic group and 8 patients (16.3%) in the prophylactic group. 
The most common other treatments were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (20.0% and 28.6% of 
patients, respectively), analgesics (33.3% and 14.3%, respectively), and antiviral agents not elsewhere 
classified (11.1% and 14.3%, respectively). 
Medical history related to haemophilia A (total number of bleeds in the previous 6 months) was reported 
in 43 of the 45 patients in the episodic group and in 32 of the 49 patients in the prophylactic group. 
The mean number of bleeds during the 6 months prior to study entry was 10.6 in the episodic group and 
2.6 in the prophylactic group. The corresponding median number of bleeds were 8.0 (range: 5 - 32) and 
1.0 (range: 0 - 13), respectively. 
Objectives 
Primary objective:  
• 
to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic emicizumab compared with no prophylaxis in patients with 
haemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors by the number of bleeds over time (i.e. bleed rate) 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 57/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary efficacy objectives for this study were: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic emicizumab (in each individual emicizumab arm) by the 
change in the number of bleeds over time compared with the patient’s historical bleed rate. 
To evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic emicizumab administered at 1.5 mg/kg QW or 3 mg/kg 
Q2W SC compared with no prophylaxis for patients previously treated with episodic FVIII by: 
  All bleeds over time 
  Spontaneous bleeds over time 
  Joint bleeds over time 
  Target joint bleeds over time 
  HRQoL of patients according to Haem-A-QoL (aged ≥ 18) or Haemo-QoL-Short Form (aged 
12-17) scores after 24 weeks 
  Health status of patients according to EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Questionnaire 
(EQ-5D-5L) scores after 24 weeks 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic emicizumab administered at 1.5 mg/kg QW SC for 
patients previously treated with prophylactic FVIII by: 
  Maintenance of an adequate control of bleeding by evaluation of the bleed rate 
The PK objective for this study was to characterise the exposure (trough plasma concentration) to 
emicizumab in patients treated on weekly or every 2 weeks dosing schedule. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
Bleed rate was defined as the number of bleeds over the efficacy period. A bleed was counted in the 
primary analysis if it was treated with coagulation factors and fulfilled the adapted International Society 
on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria. 
The number of bleeds was also annualised for each patient using the following formula: 
ABR = (Number of bleeds / Total number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. 
Endpoints were assessed using a negative binomial regression model. 
A bleed was considered to be a “treated bleed” if it was directly followed (i.e. there was not an intervening 
bleed) by a haemophilia medication reported to be a “treatment for bleed”, irrespective of the time 
between the treatment and the preceding bleed. 
A bleed and the first treatment thereafter were considered to be pairs (i.e. one treatment belongs to one 
bleed only), with the following exception: if multiple bleeds occurred on the same calendar day, the 
subsequent treatment was considered to apply for each of these multiple bleeds (which were, however, 
counted as separate bleeds). 
Two bleeds of the same type (e.g. “joint”, “muscle” or “other”) and at the same anatomical location were 
considered to be one bleed if the second occurred within 72 hours from the last treatment for the first 
bleed. The last treatment was defined as the last treatment before a new bleed occurred, either in the 
same or in a different location. 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 58/180 
 
 
 
 
Bleeds due to surgery/procedure were not included in the primary analysis. Only treatments that were 
recorded as “treatment for bleed” were included in the determination of a treated bleed. 
Secondary endpoints: 
Secondary endpoints followed a hierarchical framework. The   level was 0.05. Following the two statistical 
comparisons for the primary endpoint (Arm A versus Arm Ccontrol and Arm B versus Arm Ccontrol), the 
secondary endpoints were included in the hierarchy in the order presented:

Page 59/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Patient-reported data were collected electronically using two devices: 1) a personal handheld mobile 
device for capturing bleed data and haemophilia-related medication used during the study (including 
emicizumab), and 2) a tablet at study sites for completing HRQoL, health status, missed days of 
school/work, and satisfaction/preference questionnaires. 
The data were transmitted automatically after entry to a centralised secure database at the vendor. 
The personal electronic handheld device and the on-site tablet were designed such that it was not possible 
to leave questions unanswered or to enter partial data. 
Health-Related Quality-of-Life Data 
The Haem-A-QoL and the Haemo-QoL-SF were used to measure HRQoL in adults (aged > 18) and 
adolescents (aged 12-17), respectively. 
Scales are scored from 0 to 100 and lower scores are reflective of better HRQoL. 
Health Status Data 
Health status was measured via the EQ-5D-5L scale 
Patient Satisfaction and Preference 
The EmiPref recorded the patient’s preference for treatment with IV FVIII or SC emicizumab, or no 
preference. The EmiPref is a fit for purpose questionnaire developed by the sponsor and consists of 3 
questions: 1) Patients indicate whether they would prefer to take their former haemophilia treatment, the 
new study drug treatment, or have no preference, 2) Patients who expressed a preference were 
subsequently asked about the reasons for their choice and rank the top three, and 3) An open text field 
for any additional information about study drug experience. This questionnaire was completed by patients 
in Arms A, B, and D at Week 17. 
Sensitivity and sub-group analyses were conducted.  
The results presented in this report are based on a Clinical Cut-off date (CCOD) of 15 September 2017 for 
the primary efficacy analysis, which took place after all randomized patients (i.e., those assigned to Arms 
A, B, and C) and 59 patients (a minimum of 40 was required) from Arm D completed 24 weeks of study 
treatment or had withdrawn from the study. 
Randomisation 
Patients were stratified at randomization according to the number of bleeds they had over the last 24 
weeks prior to study entry ( < 9 or ≥ 9 [equivalent to ABR = 18]), to ensure a balance of patients with 
lower versus higher number of bleeds across the three randomized arms (Arms A, B, and C). 
The primary efficacy analysis occurred after 24 weeks of emicizumab treatment because this was 
considered to be a sufficient period of time to reliably assess the effect of emicizumab prophylaxis on 
bleed rate reduction. 
Patients previously treated with episodic FVIII were required to have at least 5 bleeds in the last 24 weeks 
prior to study entry to be eligible for enrolment. This requirement was intended to select a group of 
patients who had a high, unmet medical need and to enable detection of a clinically and statistically 
significant difference in bleed rates in this population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 60/180 
 
 
 
 
Patients who were treated with prophylactic FVIII prior to enrolment were included in a separate arm to 
avoid introducing significant heterogeneity in baseline bleed rates and goals of care. No criteria 
associated with bleeding frequency were used for the inclusion of these patients in the study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was un-blinded. 
Statistical methods 
The results presented are based on a CCOD of 15 September 2017 for the primary efficacy analysis, which 
took place after all randomized patients (i.e., those assigned to Arms A, B, and C) and 59 patients (a 
minimum of 40 was required) from Arm D completed 24 weeks of study treatment or had withdrawn from 
the study. 
Study populations 
The primary analysis population for efficacy is the Randomized Population (intent-to-treat [ITT]), defined 
as all patients who were randomized to Arms A, B, and C in their originally assigned treatment arms 
according to IxRS. 
The All Patients Population includes all patients randomized and enrolled in their originally assigned 
treatment arms (Arms A, B, C, and D), according to the IxRS. 
The All Emicizumab Patients Population includes patients in Arms A, B, and D and patients who switched 
to receive emicizumab (Arm Cemi). 
The PK-Evaluable Population includes all patients who received at least one dose of emicizumab and had 
at least one post-baseline emicizumab concentration result. 
The Safety Population 1 (SAF1) includes all patients in Arms A, B, and D who received at least one dose 
of emicizumab and patients in Arm C who started the study period (defined as having had the Week 1 
visit).  
A subset of the SAF1 Population (SAF1ND) excludes patients in Arm D and is used for safety analyses of 
randomized patients.  
The Safety Population 2 (SAF2) includes all patients in Arms A, B, and D who received at least one dose 
of emicizumab and patients in Arm C who switched to receive emicizumab and received at least one dose 
of emicizumab. 
The Non-Interventional Study Population includes patients who participated in NIS BH29768 Cohort C 
prior to enrolment in Study BH30071. The NIS Population includes two subpopulations:  
• 
• 
the NISE Population previously treated with episodic FVIII 
the NISP Population previously treated with prophylactic FVIII according to their assigned 
treatment arm in Study BH30071. 
The Activity-Evaluable Population includes patients who contributed reliable activity data (i.e. at least 8 
valid days of data in both 2-week observation periods corresponding to baseline [Weeks 1-2] and Week 
25 [Weeks 23-24], where a valid day of activity monitoring was defined as 10 or more wear hours per 
day).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
Protocol Amendment 1 was released on 12 September 2016; main points were: 
•  Removal of the specific FVIII prophylactic dose and frequency from the definition of FVIII 
prophylaxis regimen in the inclusion criterion for patients previously treated with FVIII 
prophylaxis (Arm D) 
•  Modification of the dose escalation criteria 
•  Addition of which bleeds (treated and/or all bleeds) the efficacy analyses were to be performed 
for as some patients may report bleeds that they did not treat. 
•  Addition of a new secondary efficacy endpoint: rate of spontaneous bleeds 
• 
added safety updates 
Protocol Amendment 2 was released on 30 November 2016; main points were: 
•  Update of the safety section with the most recent safety information regarding two cases of 
thrombotic microangiopathy 
•  Addition of guidance on the use of FVIII in conjunction with emicizumab. 
•  Addition of guidelines for dosing and monitoring bypassing agents 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 102 major protocol deviations occurred in 59 of 89 randomized patients.  
In Arm A, 21 patients (58.3%) with 22 procedural deviations and 8 deviations related to medication, in 
Arm B, 27 patients (77.1%) with 53 procedural deviations and 6 deviations related to medication, and in 
Arm Ccontrol, 11 patients (61.1%) with 13 procedural deviations were reported (Table below).

Table 23: Major protocol deviation (ITT population): 
Withdrawal of subjects 
One patient in Arm B withdrew from emicizumab treatment (3 mg/kg Q2W) after 51 days in the study due 
to multiple low grade AEs (depressed mood, headache, insomnia, lethargy, nightmare, pruritus and 
alopecia, details submitted) and was ongoing in the Safety Follow-Up period at the time of the CCOD. 
One patient in Arm A (1.5 mg/kg QW) and 1 patient in Arm C (no prophylaxis) were reported by the sites 
as lost to follow-up after 121 and 101 days in the study, respectively. The patient in Arm C was lost to 
follow-up before completing 24 weeks in the study and therefore never received emicizumab. 
The total observation time for all patients in the study (calculated as the time from randomization / 
enrolment until the CCOD or premature withdrawal from the study, including any time in the Safety 
Follow-up period) is presented descriptively and by week ranges in the Table below.

The proportion of randomized patients who had ≥ 9 bleeds in the 24 weeks prior to the study entry in Arm 
A, Arm B, and Arm C was 75.0%, 85.7%, and 77.8%, respectively, and the proportion was 15.9% in 
patients enrolled in Arm D. The median number of bleeds in the 24 weeks prior to enrolment was between 
11.5 and 16.5 in the randomized patients, and 2.0 in Arm D, as shown in table below: 
Table 27: Summary of bleeding events in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry (all patients) 
Previous and concurrent diseases other than Haemophilia A 
The majority of the enrolled patients (90.8%) reported at least one baseline medical condition other than 
haemophilia. The disorders were fairly well balanced between treatment groups.  
As expected, the most frequently reported disorders were haemophilic arthropathy and hypertension 
reported by 73.0% and 24.3% of patients across all treatment arms, respectively. 
A large proportion of patients reported hepatitis C (17.8%) and HIV infection (15.1%). Other medical 
disorders were reported infrequently and were typical for the patient population with haemophilia A. 
There were no clear differences across treatment groups in previous or concomitant non-haemophilia A 
medications that would impact the outcomes of the study. Treatments other than for Haemophilia A were 
analgesics 
8.3% patients in Arm A (4 surgeries or procedures in 3 patients), 22.9% patients in Arm B (16 surgeries 
or procedures in 8 patients), and 11.1% of patients in Arm Ccontrol (2 surgeries or procedures in 2 patients) 
reported surgeries and procedures during the randomized period [procedures are described].

Outcomes and estimation 
A total of 146 of 152 patients (96.1%) completed at least 24 weeks on the study at the CCOD; 35 of 36 
in Arm A (97.2%), 35 of 35 in Arm B (100%); 17 of 18 in Arm C (94.4%), and 59 of 63 in Arm D (93.7%). 
Patients in Arm C control who completed at least 24 weeks study participation were offered the option to 
switch to emicizumab at 3 mg/kg QW for 4 weeks followed by 3 mg/kg Q2W. The majority of patients in 
Arm C control who completed 24 weeks on no prophylaxis (15 of 16 patients) switched to receive 
emicizumab (Arm Cemi). One patient switched to emicizumab prior to completing 24 weeks on no 
prophylaxis (on Day 165 [~23.5 weeks]), and 1 patient, although having completed 24 weeks on no 
prophylaxis, did not switch to receive emicizumab prior to the CCOD as the first emicizumab prophylaxis 
dose was delayed due to an intercurrent illness at Week 25. 
At the time of the CCOD, 148 patients were continuing treatment with emicizumab: 35 patients in Arm A, 
34 patients in Arm B, 16 patients in Arm Cemi, and 63 patients in Arm D. One patient in Arm B was 
withdrawn from emicizumab treatment and was ongoing in the Safety Follow-Up, 1 patient in Arm A and 
1 patient in Arm C were lost to follow-up, and, as described above, 1 patient in Arm C had not switched 
to emicizumab at the time of the CCOD. 
One patient in Arm A (2.8%) had his dose up-titrated to 3 mg/kg QW from 1.5 mg/kg QW starting on 
Week 25 following ≥ 2 qualifying bleeds within 24 weeks. Four patients in Arm D (6.3%) had their dose 
up-titrated to 3 mg/kg QW; one patient prior to and 3 patients after completing 24 weeks of treatment on 
1.5 mg/kg emicizumab QW. Per protocol, patients in Arm D were allowed to up-titrate prior to completing 
24 weeks of treatment. 
Emicizumab prophylaxis with the maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg QW resulted in a 96% reduction in rate 
of treated bleeds compared with no prophylaxis (ABR A/C ratio = 0.04; p < 0.0001); similarly, 
emicizumab prophylaxis with the maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W led to a 97% reduction in rate of 
treated bleeds, compared with no prophylaxis (ABR B/C ratio = 0.03; p < 0.0001), as summarised in 
tables below: 
Assessment report

Table 28: Overview of efficacy (NB regression model, ITT population) 
Patients who were previously on episodic FVIII were randomized to receive emicizumab prophylaxis (on 
Arms A or B) or no prophylaxis (Arm C). All patients continue episodic FVIII treatment in case of a bleed, 
using FVIII products and doses as directed by their provider. This variability in FVIII cannot impact 
bleed-related endpoints as FVIII was administered after the occurrence of a bleed. In other words, once 
a patient developed symptoms of a bleed, a bleed event was counted and a subsequent intervention such 
as treatment does not change the number of bleeds. The study was not designed to collect or examine the 
hemostatic effect of FVIII and therefore no endpoint or comparison is affected by the choice of FVIII. 
The proportion of patients experiencing zero treated bleeding episodes while on emicizumab prophylaxis 
was 55.6% and 60.0% in Arms A and B, respectively, compared to 0% in Arm Ccontrol. The proportion of 
patients with 0-3 treated bleeds was 91.7% and 94.3% in Arms A and B, respectively, compared to 5.6% 
in Arm C control.

There was a 68% reduction in rate of treated bleeds (ABR D/DNIS Ratio = 0.32, p < 0.0001) and a 63% 
reduction in rate of all bleeds (ABR D/DNIS Ratio = 0.37, p < 0.0002) on emicizumab prophylaxis. 
An additional pre-defined secondary endpoint analysis (not type 1 error controlled) of intra-patient 
comparison in pooled Arms A and B (NISE Population) demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in 
rates of treated bleeds (97%) and all bleeds (96%) for emicizumab prophylaxis compared with prior 
episodic FVIII treatment.

A patient was considered to be compliant if he completed the BMQ at least every 8 days.  Overall, there 
was high compliance in the use of the BMQ in the ITT population (99.4%, 92.5%, and 96.4% compliant 
days in Arm A, Arm B, and Arm Ccontrol, respectively). 
Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults 
A patient was compliant with the Haem-A-QoL if he completed the questionnaire at the scheduled 
assessments (Weeks 1, 13, and 25). Overall compliance for the randomized adult patients was high 
(97.2%, 90.3%, and 88.0% in Arm A, Arm B, and Arm Ccontrol, respectively; details provided in the 
tabulated summary per visit). High compliance did not decrease over time; at no study visit was it lower 
than 80%. 
Similarly, compliance was high for patients in Arm D; overall compliance was > 90% for each visit. 
EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) 
A patient was compliant with the EQ-5D-5L if he completed the questionnaire at the scheduled 
assessments (Weeks 1, 13, and 25). Overall compliance for the randomized adult and adolescent patients 
was high (97.2%, 90.3%, and 88.7%) in Arm A, Arm B, and Arm Ccontrol, respectively. High compliance 
did not decrease over time; at no study visit was it lower than 80%. 
Similarly, compliance was high for patients in Arm D. Overall compliance was ≥90% for each visit.

Haemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adolescents and Children-Short Form (Haemo-QoL-SF) 
Five of 8 adolescents completed the questionnaire at all scheduled assessments. The other 3 adolescents 
did not complete the questionnaires at one of two, or two to three of three scheduled assessments. 
Emicizumab Preference Survey (EmiPref) 
A patient was compliant with the EmiPref if he completed the questionnaire at the scheduled assessment 
(Week 17). Overall, 71.4% of patients on emicizumab prophylaxis (77.8%, 61.8%, and 73.0% for Arm A, 
Arm B and Arm D, respectively) provided response to the EmiPref survey. The atypical timing of this 
assessment (i.e. no other HRQoL measures were administered at this point) contributed to sites 
forgetting to administer this questionnaire and leading to a number of missed assessments. 
Subcutaneous-Intravenous Hemophilia Injection Satisfaction (SQ-ISHI) 
A patient was compliant with the SQ-ISHI if he completed the questionnaire at the scheduled 
assessments (Week 1 and Week 21 or 25). However, due to an error in the tablet programming, the 
questionnaire could be completed at both Week 21 and Week 25. A total of 57 of 63 (90.5%) 
questionnaires expected to be completed at Week 1 were completed and 50 of 62 (80.6%) questionnaires 
expected to be completed at Week 21 were completed. At Week 25, 52 questionnaires were completed, 
of which more than half were completed by patients who had already completed the questionnaire at 
Week 21. 
Activity 
Participation to the activity assessment was optional (85 patients across all arms consented). An 
assessment was reported as compliant if the patient wore the recording device for 10 or more hours per 
day and for at least 8 days during each observation period. Overall, compliance for all expected 
assessments was 36.8% and was similar across all treatment arms (35.1% to 38.5%). Compliance was 
greater at baseline (48.2%)compared to Week 25 (26.9%). 
In the Haem-A-QoL Physical Health Score at Week 25, patients on 1.5 mg/kg QW (Arm A) and 3 mg/kg 
(Arm B) Q2W emicizumab had a lower score (reflective of better physical health) compared to patients on 
no prophylaxis (scale 0-100; Arm Ccontrol: 44.32, Arm A: 31.81, and Arm B: 28.35). The difference in 
scores between Arm A and Arm B was not statistically significant (p = 0.0891), not allowing for 
confirmatory hypothesis testing for the endpoint included further down in the hierarchy.  
Supporting the differences in scores at Week 25, a decrease in the Physical Health score over the course 
of 24 weeks was observed in patients on emicizumab, whereas no changes were observed in the scores 
of patients on no prophylaxis. The proportion of patients with improvements exceeding a responder 
threshold of 10 points at Week 25 was higher in patients on emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm A: 55.9% and 
Arm B: 54.8%), compared with patients on no prophylaxis (Arm Ccontrol: 14.3%). 
Similarly, in the Haem-A-QoL Total score at Week 25, patients on 1.5 mg/kg QW and 3 mg/kg Q2W 
emicizumab had a lower score (reflective of better HRQoL) compared to patients on no prophylaxis (scale 
0-100; Arm Ccontrol: 29.95, Arm A: 24.04, and Arm B: 21.39). A decrease in the Total score over the 
course of 24 weeks was also observed in patients on emicizumab, whereas no changes were observed in 
the scores of patients on no prophylaxis. The proportion of patients with improvements exceeding a 
responder threshold of 7 points at Week 25 was higher in patients on emicizumab prophylaxis (Arm A: 
52.9% and Arm B: 45.2%) compared with patients on no prophylaxis (Arm Ccontrol: 28.6%). 
In the EQ-5D-5L VAS and Index Utility Scores at Week 25, patients on 1.5 mg/kg QW and 3 mg/kg Q2W 
emicizumab had a higher score (reflective of better health) compared to patients on no prophylaxis, 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 73/180 
 
 
 
 
however, the differences were mostly driven by a decrease from baseline in the score of patients in Arm 
Ccontrol (i.e., worsening). 
Results are summarised in the following table: 
Table 32: Overview of Health status and quality of life (ITT population) 
Preference for Emicizumab Prophylaxis versus FVIII Prophylaxis or Episodic Treatment According to the 
Preference Survey (EmiPref) 
A total of 95 of 134 patients in Arms A, B and D (70.9%) completed the EmiPref survey at Week 17, of 
which a majority (89 patients [93.7%]) reported a preference for SC emicizumab over their former IV 
haemophilia treatment (Table below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 74/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 33: Categorical response in emicizumab preference survey by treatment arm:  
Furthermore, 97.8% of patients previously on FVIII prophylaxis (Arm D) who completed the 
questionnaire (45 of 46 patients) favoured emicizumab. 
The two reasons most frequently ranked by patients as the most important for their preference for 
emicizumab treatment over the former haemophilia treatment was “the frequency of treatments was 
lower” and “route of administration was easier”, see table below: 
Figure 26: Emicizumab preference reasons (Arms A, B and D) 
Days Away from Work or School 
The number of days away from work was recorded at baseline, Week 13 and Week 25 for the 4-week 
period preceding each data entry. 
During the three 4-week assessment periods, an average of 9 patients in Arm Ccontrol (50.0%), 27 
patients in Arm A (75.9%), and 22 patients in Arm B (61.9%) reported working. The same proportion of 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 75/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients reported not having missed any days of work at baseline and Week 25 in Arm Ccontrol (6 patients 
[33%]), whereas a small increase in the proportion of patients was seen in Arm A (baseline: 18 patients 
[50%]; Week 25: 24 patients [66.7%]) and Arm B (baseline: 14 patients: [40%]; Week 25: 21 patients 
[60.0%]).  
The mean expected number of days at work was similar, with a median of 20 days across all assessment 
periods for the three arms. The mean proportion of days away from work was ≤ 13% for all patients. 
Similarly, the number of days away from school was recorded at baseline, Week 13 and Week 25 for the 
4-week period preceding each data entry. In Arm Ccontrol, 5 patients (27.8%) were enrolled at school at 
baseline and 2 patients (11.1 %) at Week 25. In Arm A, 8 patients (22.2%) were enrolled at school at 
baseline and 4 patients (11.1%) at Week 25. In Arm B, 6 patients (17.1%) were enrolled at school at 
baseline and 2 patients (5.7%) at Week 25. The mean proportion of days away from school was 0% in the 
majority of patients across all assessment periods. 
Days Hospitalised 
The mean number of days hospitalized within 24 weeks during the randomized period was 0.11 days for 
Arm Ccontrol (95% CI: 0.00, 0.35 days), 0.17 days for Arm A (95% CI: 0.00, 0.51) and 0.43 days for Arm 
B (95% CI: 0.00; 1.04 days), with a median of zero for the three arms (i.e., the majority of patients were 
not hospitalised). 
Study HAVEN-3 (BH30071): A randomized, multicentre, open-label, Phase 
III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 
prophylactic emicizumab versus no prophylaxis in haemophilia A patients 
without inhibitors. 
Surgeries 
A proportion of 8.3% patients in Arm A (4 surgeries or procedures in 3 patients), 22.9% patients in Arm 
B (16 surgeries or procedures in 8 patients), and 11.1% of patients in Arm C control (2 surgeries or 
procedures in 2 patients) reported surgeries and procedures during the randomized period. 
One patient in Arm A (Patient ##9002) had a left and right ankle arthroplasty more than 7 and 2 years 
prior to study entry, respectively, that were the source of an SAE, surgery during the study, and 
administration of several doses of FVIII. On study Day 125, the patient reported a mild device loosening 
in the left ankle. On study Day 229, the AE worsened to severe intensity and the patient was hospitalized. 
A revision of the total arthroplasty (left ankle) for aseptic loosening of the talar component was performed 
on study Day 230, and the patient was administered several doses of FVIII (SHL) as preventative doses 
for surgery/procedure. 
Surgeries and procedures during emicizumab prophylaxis included one additional event in 1 patient 
(6.3%) in Arm Cemi and 82 events in 16 patients (25.4%) in Arm D. Multiple repetitions of the same 
procedures(percutaneous drainage tube irrigation [33 repetitions], percutaneous drainage tube 
insertion/ removal [5 repetitions], and wound irrigation [12 repetitions]) were reported for a single 
patient in Arm D (Patient ##9103) as a treatment for historical peritoneo-cutaneous fistula (starting 
date: 22 January 2015, Day -796), and the patient was administered several doses of FVIII (SHL) as 
preventative doses for surgery/procedure. 
One patient in Arm D (Patient ##4103) had an SAE of acute coronary syndrome, which led to 
hospitalization on study Day 239 and multiple subsequent procedures. The patient underwent a 
transthoracic echocardiogram (Day 242), a coronary angiogram (Day 243), left heart catheterization

(Day 245), and a percutaneous coronary intervention (Day 245). The patient was not administered FVIII 
but was administered 12 different medications for the acute coronary syndrome and related procedures.

Treatments 
Study BO39182 was designed to investigate emicizumab prophylaxis (6 mg/kg) administered in a Q4W 
dosing regimen in patients with haemophilia A with or without inhibitors against FVIII. 
The study consists of two parts: a PK run-in part followed by an expansion part. 
PK Run-In Part 
The PK run-in analysis was conducted after the 7 patients had completed 6 weeks in the study. Clinical 
data up to 10 April 2017; analysis conducted by the Sponsor on 12 May 2017 
All enrolled patients were male with severe Haemophilia A. Five patients were White, and 2 patients were 
Asian. The median age of patients enrolled in the PK run-in was 37.0 years (range: 14-50 years). Overall, 
6 patients were adults (≥ 18 years) and 1 patient was aged 14 years. There were 3 patients (42.9%) with 
FVIII inhibitors, and 4 patients (57.1%) without inhibitors. 
All 7 patients had been on episodic treatment for haemophilia A in the last 24 weeks prior to enrolment. 
The median number of bleeding events in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry was 6.0 (range: 0-30). 
Six of 7 patients had at least one target joint. Bleeds were located in a total of five different joints; most 
commonly in the ankle, knee, and elbow. 
At the CCOD for this Interim CSR (18 October 2017), the median efficacy period in the PK run-in was 
35.43 weeks (range: 33.4-37.4 weeks) and the median observation period was 35.41 weeks (range: 
33.4-37.4 weeks). 
Expansion Part 
The expansion part was conducted to further investigate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and 
pharmacodynamics in a separate cohort planned to consist of approximately 40 patients. A loading dose 
of 3 mg/kg emicizumab was administered QW for 4 weeks followed by maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg 
Q4W. 
In weeks 1-25 (QW loading dose for 4 weeks and Q4W maintenance dose for 20 weeks) all 
administrations occurred with planned clinic visits; unassisted self-administration of the drug at the 
investigational site was supported. 
In contrast to the PK run-in cohort, PK sampling was performed to investigate emicizumab trough 
concentrations (Ctrough) only. 
The first patient was enrolled into the expansion part on 24 May 2017, and the last patient entered the 
study on 30 June 2017. An interim analysis is submitted, up to a CCOD of 18 October 2017. 
Study design is summarised in the following diagram:

Figure 27: Study schema 
Rationale 
The Q4W regimen option was investigated in this study in order to address current challenges concerning 
the limited adherence to prophylaxis in patients with haemophilia A (range from 44%-87%, references 
submitted). 
An SC Q4W maintenance regimen was investigated in this study in addition to the QW regimen and every 
2 week (Q2W) regimen (which were investigated in other Phase III studies) to provide an option for 
patients to receive emicizumab Q4W, while maintaining the same cumulative dose. 
The dosing regimens for this study were proposed based on modelling and simulation of the PK and 
efficacy data from patients participating in Part C of Phase I/II Study ACE001JP and its extension Study 
ACE002JP. 
The dose of 6 mg/kg Q4W investigated in this study is equivalent in terms of cumulative dose to the dose 
levels of 1.5 mg QW or 3 mg/kg Q2W that have been evaluated in the other emicizumab Phase III studies 
(BH29884, BH29992, and BH30071). Assuming linear PK up to 6 mg/kg, model-based simulations were 
used to explore whether a Q4W dosing regimen could provide adequate efficacy.  
The simulations suggest that a once-weekly loading dose of 3 mg/kg for the first 4 weeks, followed by a 
Q4W maintenance dose of 6 mg/kg would provide a maximum concentration at steady-state (Cmax) and 
area under the concentration-time curve within the dosing interval (AUCt) of 78.1 ± 20.9 µg/mL and 1570 
± 447 day*µg/mL, respectively.

Figure 28: Simulated plasma emicizumab concentration over time (Q4W dosing) 
The mode of action of emicizumab is identical in patients with haemophilia A irrespective of the presence 
of FVIII inhibitors, and data from the Phase I/II studies did not show a difference in pharmacokinetics, 
safety, or efficacy between patients with or without inhibitors against FVIII. Therefore, this study included 
patients with haemophilia A, regardless of their FVIII inhibitor status. 
Patients previously treated with episodic FVIII or episodic bypassing agents were required to have ≥5 
bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry to be eligible for enrolment into the expansion part. This 
requirement was intended to select a group of patients with haemophilia A who have a high, unmet 
medical need and to enable evaluation of adequate control of bleeding in this population.  
Patients who had been on previous prophylactic treatment could enrol (in the expansion part only) 
without any requirement for a certain bleed number, because their bleeds should have been well 
controlled through receiving their current standard of care.  
In order to exclude patients who might have a higher chance to show an immune response to foreign 
protein regimens (e.g. FVIII), patients without FVIII inhibitors who completed successful immune 
tolerance induction (ITI) ≥5 years before screening had to have no evidence of inhibitor recurrence 
(permanent or temporary), indicated by detection of an inhibitor, FVIII half-life < 6 hours, or FVIII 
recovery < 66% since ITI. 
Dose modification was allowed only after completing 24 weeks on emicizumab treatment. All patients 
with suboptimal control of bleeding ( ≥ 2 qualifying bleeds within 24 weeks on emicizumab treatment) 
have the opportunity to increase their emicizumab maintenance dose to 3 mg/kg QW starting at Week 25 
at the earliest, if they receive approval from the Medical Monitor. 
There was also the option to return to a lower dose regimen. 
As a measure of compliance, used and unused IMP vials were returned by study patients to the study site 
and appropriately accounted for.

During the study, patients could administer FVIII or bypassing agents or other haemophilia A medication 
to treat breakthrough bleeds, as a preventative dose before procedure / surgery or as preventative dose 
before activity. Data are summarised in the table below: 
Table 34: Non-emicizumab haemophilia medication (expansion cohort) 
The most commonly used non-emicizumab haemophilia medication while on study was short-acting FVIII 
(n = 19, 46.3%). Patients who received FVIII treatment (n = 18 of 19, 94.7%), used a peak dose of < 50 
units/kg per treatment administration. The median number of doses administered was 2.0 (range: 1-11), 
and the median total cumulative dose was 69.2 units/kg (range: 13-252). 
Short-acting FVIII was administered episodically as a treatment for bleeds. Most bleeds (n = 13 of 29 
bleeds, 44.8%) were each treated with a cumulative dose < 25 units/kg, 9 bleeds (31.0%) were each 
treated with a cumulative dose of 25 to 50 units/kg, 6 bleeds (20.7%) were treated with a cumulative 
dose of 51 to 100 units/kg, and 1 bleed (3.4%) was treated with a cumulative dose of 101 to 150 units/kg. 
The median cumulative dose per bleed was 25.32 units/kg (range: 13.0-107.1), and the duration of 
treatment was 1 day for the majority (23 bleeds, 79.3%).

haemophilia A with or without inhibitors against FVIII. 
The objectives of the PK run-in include the following: 
• 
• 
To investigate the pharmacokinetics of emicizumab after single and multiple (Q4W) SC 
administration of 6 mg/kg 
To assess the safety and tolerability of emicizumab after Q4W SC administration of 6 mg/kg 
Assessment report

The efficacy objectives of the expansion part include the following: 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic emicizumab on [described] aspects of bleeding 
Sample size 
The analysis populations for the PK run-in and expansion parts were not pooled. Each part is analysed 
separately. 
The efficacy period for each patient started on the day of the first emicizumab dose and ended at the 
CCOD for this primary analysis, when the last enrolled patient reached 24 weeks of treatment. 
The median duration of the efficacy period for the 41 patients included in the efficacy analysis was 25.57 
weeks (range: 24.1-29.4 weeks), as shown below: 
Table 36: Efficacy period duration (expansion cohort) 
At the CCOD all patients had received all 4 loading doses (i.e. one dose per week during the first 4 weeks) 
and at least six maintenance dose injections (Q4W).  
Although permitted after an efficacy period of > 24 weeks per protocol, there were no dose up-titrations.

Randomisation 
This was a single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
According to the protocol, optional interim analyses at various time points were permitted to support 
regulatory submissions. At the time of writing of this Interim CSR, the expansion part had completed 
enrolment but the primary analysis had not yet been reached. The primary analysis is planned to be 
conducted after the last enrolled patient completes the 24-week treatment period, is lost to follow-up, or 
has withdrawn, whichever occurs first. 
Results 
Participant flow 
The overall patient disposition in Study BO39182 is shown below: 
Figure 29: Patient disposition for study BO39182 (PK run-in expansion parts) 
The reasons for screen failures were: expected failure to comply with visits (treatment plans), 
concomitant disease that interferes with conduct of the study, and patient decision. 
At the CCOD, all 41 patients in the expansion part had started study treatment; however, none had 
completed more than 24 weeks of treatment.

Table 39: Haemophilia A history (expansion cohort continued): 
40 patients (97.6%) had haemophilia classified by the investigator as severe. 11 patients (28.9%) on 
study had a history of FVIII inhibitor diagnosis. 6/11 patients did not test positive for FVIII inhibitors at 
study entry. Out of these 6 patients, 2 had undergone ITI. The mean time from FVIII inhibitor diagnosis 
was 234.7 months, with 9 of 11 patients diagnosed ≥ 72 months prior to study entry. 
30 patients (73.2%) were categorized as being on prior prophylactic treatment, mainly short acting FVIII 
(23 patients, 76.7%). 
Episodic treatment in the 24 weeks prior to the study start was recorded for 19 patients (11 patients who 
were on episodic treatment and 8 patients who were on prophylactic treatment), mostly short acting FVIII 
(14 patients, 73.7%).

The median number of bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry was 5.0 (range: 0-90). 25 patients 
(61.0%) had at least one target joint. A total of 9 different target joint locations were reported; ankle, 
knee, and elbow were the most common target joint locations. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The efficacy period for each patient started on the day of the first emicizumab dose and ended at the 
CCOD for this primary analysis, when the last enrolled patient reached 24 weeks of treatment. 
The median duration of the efficacy period for the 41 patients included in the efficacy analysis was 25.57 
weeks (range: 24.1-29.4 weeks), as shown in the table below: 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019

Table 41: Efficacy period duration (expansion cohort): 
At the CCOD all patients had received all 4 loading doses (i.e. one dose per week during the first 4 weeks) 
and at least six maintenance dose injections (Q4W).  
Although permitted after an efficacy period of > 24 weeks per protocol, there were no dose up-titrations. 
An overview of the ABR for all bleed-related efficacy endpoints is shown below: 
Table 42: Overview of efficacy –Bleed related endpoints (expansion cohort): 
The NB model-based ABR for treated bleeds was 2.4 (95% CI: 1.38, 4.28), and the median ABR was 0.0 
(IQR: 0.00, 2.08).

The majority of patients (n = 23, 56.1%) did not experience any treated bleeds while receiving 
emicizumab prophylaxis. In total, 90.2% (n = 37) of patients experienced 0 to 3 treated bleeds. 
The model-based ABR for treated spontaneous bleeds was 0.6 (95% CI: 0.27, 1.53), and the median ABR 
was 0.0 (IQR: 0.00, 0.00). Most patients (n = 34, 82.9%) did not experience any treated spontaneous 
bleeds while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis, and 97.6% of patients experienced 0 to 3 treated 
spontaneous bleeds. 
The model-based ABR was 1.7 (95% CI: 0.82, 3.68) for treated joint bleeds and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.31, 3.26) 
for treated target joint bleeds. The median ABR was 0.0 (IQR: 0.00, 1.85) for treated joint bleeds and 0.0 
(IQR: 0.00, 0.00) for treated target joint bleeds 
The model-based ABR for bleeds of type ‘all bleeds’ was 4.5 (95% CI: 3.10, 6.60), and the median ABR 
was 2.1 (IQR: 0.00, 5.89). Twelve (29.3%) patients experienced zero all bleeds. The majority of patients 
(n = 33, 80.5%) experienced 0 to 3 all bleeds. 
Six patients had more than 2 treated bleeds. The majority of these bleeds were traumatic (27 out of 37 
bleeds, 73%). One patient had 18 treated bleeds (ABR = 32.07), all of which were traumatic. For this 
patient, 16 out of the 18 treated bleeds were in target joints. No obvious risk factors have been identified 
for this patient. 
Twelve (29.3% [95% CI: 16.1, 45.5]) patients experienced 0 all bleeds (i.e. ABR = 0) while receiving 
emicizumab prophylaxis. The majority of patients (n = 33, 80.5%) experienced 0 to 3 bleeds, and the 
ABR was ≤ 10 in 87.8% (95% CI: 73.8, 95.9) of patients.

Haem-A-QoL (Patients aged 18 years or older) 
At the time of the CCOD for this primary analysis, all of the 38 adult patients had completed the 
Haem-A-QoL questionnaires at baseline and at Week 13 visit. At Week 25 visit, 37 adult patients had 
completed the Haem-A-QoL questionnaires.  
The mean (SD) Haem-A-QoL Total Score at baseline was 39.41 (17.91) and 26.32 (16.62) at Week 25, 
representing a numerical mean improvement from baseline of -13.62 (95% CI: -18.36, -8.88), an 
amount that was greater than the 7-point responder threshold, where lower scores are reflective of better 
HRQoL.  
Taking into account the responder threshold of a 7-point change, 25 of 37 (67.6%) patients recorded an 
improvement larger than the responder threshold at Week 25. 
Haemo-QoL-SF (Adolescents, 12-17 Years of Age) 
At the time of the CCOD, all 3 adolescent patients (12−17 years of age) had completed the 
Haemo-QoL-SF questionnaire at the Week 25 visit. Given thesmall number of adolescent patients, the 
results from the HRQoL assessments should be interpreted with caution. 
Low scores on Physical Health (denoting high levels of quality of life) were observed at baseline for each 
of the 3 adolescent patients who completed the Haemo-QoL-SF (18.8, 18.8, and 6.3). For the 2 patients 
reporting 18.8 at baseline, scores improved to 12.5 and 0.0 at Week 25. For the patient with a baseline 
score of 6.3, a reduction in Physical Health was observed at Week 25. 
EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale Results at Week 25 
The mean (SD) EQ-5D-5L VAS Score at baseline was 74.39 (19.36) and 79.53 (15.27) at Week 25 
representing a numerical improvement from baseline (5.53, 95% CI: 1.15, 9.90) as higher scores are 
reflective of better health state.  
Fourteen of 40 patients (35.0%) reported an improvement in the EQ-5D-5L VAS Score between baseline 
and Week 25, which was larger than the responder threshold (7 points), indicating a clinically meaningful 
improvement. Improvements in VAS scores were observed for most patients. 
EQ-5D-5L Index Utility Score at Week 25 
The mean (SD) EQ-5D-5L Index Utility Score at baseline was 0.69 (0.24) and 0.75 (0.22) at Week 25 
representing a numerical improvement from baseline (0.06, 95%CI: 0.03, 0.10), as higher scores are 
reflective of better health status. Improvements in the Index Utility Scores were observed for most 
patients.  
Nineteen of 40 patients (47.5%) reported an improvement in the EQ-5D-5L Index Utility Score between 
baseline and Week 25, which was larger than the responder threshold (0.07 points). 
Emicizumab Preference Survey 
The EmiPref survey was administered once during the study at Week 17. All 41 patients in the expansion 
cohort provided categorical responses. All patients (100%) preferred the Q4W emicizumab SC treatment.

Figure 32: Bar chart of emicizumab preference reason by treatment and by item (all treated 
patients) 
The reasons selected most frequently as most important for preference to the new SC treatment were 
“the frequency of treatments was lower” (22.0%), followed by “the route of administration was easier” 
(19.5%), and “quality of life, in general, was better” (14.6%). 
Number Of Days Away From School and / or Work 
The number of days away from work was analyzed up to the Week 25 visit. Twenty eight (68.3%) patients 
were working at the time of enrolment. Twenty-seven patients (65.9%) were still working in the four 
weeks leading to Week 25; during which 61.0% of working patients reported not missing work (compared 
with 53.7% working patients who reported no missed working days at baseline). 
The mean (SD) expected number of days at work was generally similar between baseline (15.46 [6.30]) 
and Week 25 (16.78 [6.02]). The mean number of days away from work at baseline was 0.75 compared 
with 0.15 at Week 25. The mean proportion of days away from work at baseline was 0.05 (95% CI: 0.01, 
0.10), compared with 0.01 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.02) at Week 25. 
Ten patients (24.4%) were enrolled in school at Week 25 (same as at baseline), and one patient missed 
a day of school while on study (compared with 6 patients [mean of 1.8 days away from school] at 
baseline). 
The mean (SD) expected number of days at school at baseline was 13.70 (8.49) compared with 14.10 
(7.74) at Week 25. The mean proportion of days away (with respect to expected school days) at baseline 
was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.24), compared with 0.03 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.10) at Week 25. 
Number Of Days Hospitalized 
At the time of the clinical cut-off, no patients had been hospitalized.

Study BH29884 (HAVEN 1): A randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase 
III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 
prophylactic emicizumab versus no prophylaxis in hemophilia A patients 
with inhibitors  
Methods 
This is a randomised, multicentre, open label, Phase III clinical study enrolling patients aged 12 years or 
older with haemophilia A who have inhibitors against FVIII,  
Figure 33: Overview of study design – study BH29884 
Study participants 
Key inclusion criteria were diagnosis of congenital haemophilia A in patients age 12 and above of any 
severity and documented history of high-titre inhibitor (i.e. ≥5 BU); documentation of treatment with 
episodic or prophylactic bypassing agents for at least the last 24 weeks; ≥ 6 bleeds in the last 24 weeks 
prior to screening (if on an episodic bypassing agent regimen) or ≥2 bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to 
screening (if on a prophylactic bypassing agent regimen). 
Key exclusion criteria were ongoing (or plan to receive during the study) immune tolerance induction 
therapy or prophylaxis with FVIII except for patients who had received a treatment regimen of FVIII 
prophylaxis with concurrent bypassing agent prophylaxis, as well as planned surgery (excluding minor 
procedures such as tooth extraction or incision and drainage) during the study. 
The exclusion criteria were amended (amendment 2) to exclude patients who are at high risk of 
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) as part of the safety changes.  
Treatments 
The study evaluates prophylactic treatment with emicizumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg/week SC for 4 weeks, 
followed by 1.5 mg/kg/week SC thereafter. Emicizumab was administered as a SC injection in the lower 
abdomen, upper arm, or thigh at patient’s discretion.  
Dose-up titration was allowed after at least 24 weeks on emicizumab prophylaxis. Patients could increase 
their dose from 1.5 mg/kg QW to 3 mg/kg QW, if they met certain criteria (two spontaneous and clinically

significant bleeds after loading dose period of which one verified by physician) and received approval from 
the Medical Monitor.  
Comparator 
Historical comparison was used: Non-Interventional Study NIS BH29768 as described (see above). 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
The primary efficacy objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic emicizumab 
compared with no prophylaxis in patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors (Arms A and B) after 24 
weeks of emicizumab treatment.   
Secondary objectives: 
The secondary efficacy objectives for this study was compare prophylactic emicizumab treatment with no 
prophylaxis (Arms A and B) and to compare the bleed rate of prophylactic emicizumab treatment with 
bleed rate prior to study entry (intra-patient comparison; Arms A and C).  
Exploratory objectives: 
The exploratory efficacy objective for this study is to evaluate the impact of prophylactic emicizumab 
compared with no prophylaxis on school/work attendance and hospitalisation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
•  Annualized bleed rate, defined as the number of treated bleeds over the efficacy period 
Secondary endpoints: 
•  All bleeds, treated joint bleeds, treated target joint bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, and 
Haem-A-QoL, Haemo-QoL-SF and EQ- 5D-5L 
• 
The number of days away from school/work and days hospitalized 
Sample size 
The total sample size for this study was based on both clinical rather than statistical considerations, 
considering the limited number of patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors available for participation in 
clinical studies and to collect sufficient data to assess the safety and efficacy of emicizumab. A sample size 
calculation was conducted to assess the adequacy of the randomised comparison. 
Sample size calculations were performed for a range of values of λt and λc. A sample size of 45 patients, 
assuming a randomisation ratio of 2:1 (30 patients in Arm A and 15 patients in Arm B control), would 
achieve a power of more than 95% for λt and λc ranging from 1 to 4 and 18 to 30, respectively assuming 
patients were followed for 24 weeks. 
The primary analysis included all randomised patients, regardless of their length of follow-up.

Randomisation 
Patients were assigned to one of 4 treatment arms. 
• 
• 
• 
Patients treated previously with an episodic regimen were randomized 2:1 to receive emicizumab 
prophylaxis (Arm A) or no prophylaxis (Arm B control), and stratified according to the number of 
bleeds they had experienced over the last 24 weeks prior to study entry (< 9 or ≥ 9 bleeds). 
Patients treated previously with a prophylactic regimen of bypassing agents were enrolled in Arm 
C to receive emicizumab prophylaxis. 
Patients who participated in non-interventional study (NIS) BH29768 and who were previously 
treated with bypassing agents but were unable to enrol in Arms A, B or C were enrolled into Arm 
D.

Conduct of the study 
There were two amendments to the original protocol. Amendment 1 (21th of April 2016) introduced 
changes to the planned number of patients enrolled to Arm C and added Arm D. These are not considered 
to have impact on the outcome analyses. Amendment 2 (released on 30th of November 2016), after the 
data cut-off date, formalised the changes to administration of bypassing agents that were originally 
implemented via the DILs (from 7th and 17th of October 2016) following 4 patients who experienced SAEs 
(2 patients with thromboembolic events and 2 patients with thrombotic microangiopathy), considered to 
be related to the concomitant use of aPCC. Furthermore, a new efficacy objective to evaluate the clinical 
effect of emicizumab prophylaxis on the number of spontaneous bleeds over time (spontaneous bleed 
rate) was added. This was despite it being included as an endpoint in the SAP.  
Protocol deviations 
The total number of major protocol deviations were slightly lower in the control arm (ITT population: Arm 
B 16.7% vs 20% Arm A), due to the open label design. Procedural major protocol deviations were equally 
balanced between the two groups (Arm A 14.3% vs Arm B 16.7%); two patients in the Arm A had 
medication deviations.

The majority (82.3%) of patients had ≥ 48 weeks follow-up at cut-off. 
Bleed Rates in All Emicizumab-Treated Patients 
Model-based ABR (95% CI) for treated bleeds across all treatment arms in the all emicizumab-treated 
patients was 2.7 (1.64, 4.35), mean (95% CI) calculated ABR was 2.8 (0.53, 8.45). These results are 
consistent with those reported in the Primary CSR (4.6 and 4.7 respectively). 
Median calculated ABR was zero for all endpoints (i.e., treated bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, 
treated joint bleeds, and treated target joint bleeds), consistent with the Primary CSR.

Categorised Numbers of Bleeds 
The following descriptive analyses of number of bleeds and ABR in the All Patients 2 population indicated 
that the majority of the patients experienced 0 - 3 bleeds for the following: 
• 
Treated Bleeds Categorized Analysis and ABR: 85.0% of all patients receiving emicizumab 
treatment experienced 0-3 treated bleeds 
•  All Bleeds Categorized Analysis and ABR: 69.0% of all patients receiving emicizumab treatment 
experienced 0-3 all bleeds 
• 
• 
Treated Joint Bleeds Categorized Analysis and ABR: 96.5% of all patients receiving emicizumab 
treatment experienced 0-3 treated joint bleeds 
Treated Target Joint Bleeds Categorized Analysis and ABR: 96.5% of all patients receiving 
emicizumab treatment experienced 0-3 treated target joint bleeds 
•  Categorized Analysis of Treated Spontaneous Bleeds and ABR: 95.6% of all patients receiving 
emicizumab treatment experienced 0-3 treated spontaneous bleeds 
58.1% of all bleeds reported in all emicizumab-treated patients during the study occurred in joints 
About half of the bleeds (48.1%) were of spontaneous nature and half (48.6%) were of traumatic cause; 
the remainder were due to procedure/surgery. 
Results of Health Status / Quality of Life / Days Away from Work or School / Days Hospitalized are 
consistent with the previous study report. 
Overall, 5 patients had their dose up-titrated from 1.5 to 3 mg/kg/week. 
Two patients were described in the Primary CSR.

•  One patient had ≥2 spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds in the last 24 weeks on 
emicizumab, both of which occurred after the end of loading dose period. These bleeds were 
physician-verified based upon physical examination and discussion with the patient at the time of 
the bleeds; the patient was up-titrated after 27 weeks (Study Day 183). This patient had an ABR 
Treated Bleeds of 6.02 before up-titration and 0 after up-titration. 
•  One patient had ≥2 spontaneous and clinically significant non-limb-threatening joint bleeds after 
the loading dose period. These bleeds were verified based upon physician’s assessment of the 
patient’s condition; patient was up-titrated at Week 25 (Study Day 169). This patient had an ABR 
of 6.52 before up-titration and 0 after up-titration. 
Three patients were up-titrated between the analysis presented in the Primary CSR and the cut-off for this 
Update CSR: 
•  One patient had ≥2 spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds in the last 24 weeks on 
emicizumab- both of which occurred after the end of loading dose period and presented an 
increased frequency of bleeds. These bleeds were physician-verified based upon physical 
examination and discussion with the patient at the time of the bleeds as well as diagnostic 
imaging and clinical examination; the patient was up-titrated after 25 weeks (Study Day 170). 
This patient had an ABR Treated Bleeds of 25.93 before up-titration and 0 after up-titration. 
•  One patient had ≥2 spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds in the last 24 weeks on 
emicizumab- both of which occurred after the end of loading dose period. The patient 
demonstrated significant haemophilic arthropathy and thickened synovium consistent with 
recurrent bleed events and increasing risk of additional bleeds. These bleeds were 
physician-verified based upon diagnostic imaging and discussion with the patient at the time of 
the bleeds; the patient was up-titrated after 25 weeks (Study Day 169). This patient had an ABR 
Treated Bleeds of 95.66 before up-titration and 25.75 after up-titration. 
•  One patient had ≥2 spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds in the last 24 weeks on 
emicizumab- both of which occurred after the end of loading dose period. The patient experienced 
non-limb threatening joint bleeds. These bleeds were physician-verified based upon clinical 
examination and discussion with the patient at the time of the bleeds; the patient was up-titrated 
after 25 weeks (Study Day 169). This patient had an ABR Treated Bleeds of 13.04 before 
up-titration and 5.92 after up-titration. 
The mean model-based ABR (2.7 bleeds), and calculated ABR (2.8 bleeds) were consistent with the 
primary analysis (4.6 and 4.7 bleeds respectively):

Median calculated ABR was 0 for all endpoints (i.e., treated bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, treated 
joint bleeds, and treated target joint bleeds) except for the ‘all bleeds’ endpoint. 
Mean calculated ABRs for treated bleeds estimated over the last 12 weeks fell by Week 12 (i.e. first 
interval), and improvement was sustained beyond Week 48; whereas the median remained at zero. 
Assessment of the mean and median ABRs is provided by 12-week interval to describe the effect of 
emicizumab over time: 
Figure 35: Mean and median calculated annualised bleed rate per 12-week interval, treated 
bleeds (all patients 2) 
Mean calculated ABRs for treated bleeds estimated by interval decreased over time and the improvement 
was sustained up to Week 72; whereas the median remained consistently at zero. 
These data demonstrate the long term efficacy of emicizumab and the decrease in ABR over time may 
explain the decrease seen on calculated ABR over the entire efficacy period when compared with the 
Primary CSR. 
The percentage of patients with no treated bleeds over the last 12 weeks reached approximately 80% 
overall by Week 48, and remained consistent beyond Week 48, further underscoring long term efficacy of 
emicizumab over time.

Surgeries 
The majority of all bleeds reported in all emicizumab-treated patients during the study occurred in joints 
(58.1%). When analysing the cause of all bleeds for all patients on emicizumab treatment, about half of 
the bleeds (48.1%) were of spontaneous nature and half (48.6%) were of traumatic cause; the remainder 
were due to procedure / surgery.

Methods 
A single-arm, multicentre, open-label, Phase III clinical study with the following design: 
Figure 36: Study schema 
Study participants 
Key inclusion/ exclusion criteria were similar to study BH29884. It is patients with a diagnosis of 
congenital haemophilia A with a body weight of less than 40 kg, but at least 3 kg, of any severity and 
documented history of high-titre inhibitor (i.e., ≥ 5 BU) and required treatment with bypassing agents. 
Criteria for past history of bleeding was different to study BH29884. For patients > 2 years of age, if on 
an episodic bypassing agent regimen this is: ABR of ≥ 6 (e.g., 3 bleeds in the last 24 weeks) or if on a 
prophylactic bypassing agent regimen, inadequately controlled (e.g., 2 bleeds since starting prophylaxis 
or 1 life-threatening bleed) or CVAD placement medically not feasible or deemed unsafe by investigator. 
For patients < 2 years determined by investigator to be in high unmet medical need. Adequate 
haematological, hepatic, and renal function.  
Regarding ITI, contrary to study BH29884, patients awaiting initiation of ITI and patients in whom ITI had 
failed are eligible with a 72-hour washout period prior to the first emicizumab administration. 
Treatments 
A weekly loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg SC for the first 4 weeks (Day 1 of each week) followed by a 
maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC (Day 1 of each week) for cohort A. [subjects are not yet 
recruited to cohorts B and C (cohorts added as protocol amendment 3 dated 01 Sept 2017)]. 
Patients are to receive emicizumab for a minimum of 52 weeks.

Comparator Non- interventional study NIS BH29768  
In the comparator study patients received treatment with aPCC or treatments with rFVIIa or both aPCC 
and rFVIIa (see above). 
Objectives 
The objectives of the study were to investigate (with no formal hypothesis testing) the efficacy, safety, 
and PK of once weekly SC administration of emicizumab in paediatric patients with haemophilia A with 
FVIII inhibitors who were receiving treatment with bypassing agents; with the following efficacy 
endpoints: to evaluate the clinical effect of prophylactic emicizumab on the number of bleeds over time 
(i.e., bleed rate, with analysis for treated bleeds, all bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, treated joint 
bleeds, and treated target joint bleeds); to evaluate the efficacy in reducing the number of bleeds over 
time compared with the patient's historical bleed rate (intra-patient comparison); to characterise the 
efficacy of up-titration on both an intra-patient and population level, also on the basis of the number of 
bleeds over time; to evaluate the HRQoL of children 8-17 years of age according to Haemo-QoL-Short 
Form (SF) (completed by patients); to evaluate proxy-reported HRQoL and aspects of caregiver burden 
using the Adapted Inhib-QoL Including Aspects of Caregiver Burden questionnaire for all children 
(completed by caregivers); to assess the number of days missed from day-care/school and days 
hospitalised.

Sample size 
The sample size for this study was based on feasibility and clinical considerations. Hence, at least 20 
children younger than 12 years of age and up to approximately 60 patients with haemophilia A with FVIII 
inhibitors who were receiving treatment with bypassing agents were to be enrolled in this study. 
During the study, re-assessment of the initially specified sample size based on enrolment consideration 
was possible. 
Randomisation 
This was a single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The All Patients population and the Treated population were identical and comprised 63 patients treated 
with emicizumab, because no patients discontinued between enrolment and start of treatment. This was 
the main analysis population for safety analyses. The main analysis population for efficacy analyses was 
patients aged ≤12 years who had >12 weeks on study and comprised 59 patients (also referred to as 
“ABR Patients <12 years”). The other analysis populations are summarized in the Table below. No 
patients had their dose up-titrated.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendment 3 was released on 01 Sept 2017 
• 
Two cohorts (designated as Cohorts B and C; patients 2-11 years of age) have been added to the 
study to investigate additional, less frequent emicizumab dosing schedules (Q2W and Q4W), 
which would allow the option to select a preferred schedule, while still delivering the same 
cumulative dose.  
•  Approximately 80 patients are now planned to be included in the study, with 60 patients in Cohort 
A and 20 patients in the additional Cohorts B and C (10 patients each). 
• 
The up-titration schema was modified with removal of the 2.25 mg/kg QW dosing level. This was 
based on an interim data review characterizing exposure at 1.5 mg/kg QW in patients 2-12 years 
of age to be similar to adolescent/adult patients. As such, the up-titration dose will be the same 
used in adolescent/adult patients (3 mg/kg QW). 
•  A new safety risk associated with emicizumab has been added as follows: 
Life-threatening bleeding due to unreliable standard coagulation tests and inhibitors assays 
in the setting of emicizumab. Coagulation laboratory tests (including, but not limited to, 
aPTT, one-stage FVIII activity, and FVIII inhibitor measurement by Bethesda assay) are not 
reliable and are impacted by the presence of emicizumab and, therefore, are not reflecting 
the patients underlying haemostatic status accurately. 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 46 major protocol deviations occurred in 26 of 63 patients (41.3%) in the All Patients population 
(24 patients [38.1%] experienced 42 procedural deviations, 3 patients [4.8%] experienced 3 deviations 
relating to medication, and 1 patient [1.6%] experienced one deviation relating to inclusion criteria.

Table 56: Haemophilia A history (all patients continued) 
The majority of patients (95.2%) had severe haemophilia.  
The mean time from FVIII inhibitor diagnosis was 61.24 months, with 27 patients (42.9%) diagnosed ≥72 
months prior to study entry.  
Patients with a documented history of high inhibitor titre were enrolled in this study. The mean highest 
historical inhibitor titre was 644.7 BU/mL. No patient had FVIII inhibitor titre <5 BU/mL.Overall, 43 
patients (68.3%) had previously been treated with ITI. The majority (74.6%) of patients were treated 
with a prophylactic regimen prior to enrolment, with 16 patients (25.4%) previously on episodic 
treatment. 
There was a median of 6 bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry (range: 0-155 bleeds).

Table 57: Summary of bleeding events in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry (all patients) 
The number of bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry was reported directly by the investigators 
and not collected prospectively. Overall, 23 patients (36.5%) had at least one target joint, and of those 
with target joints, 65.2% had >1 target joint. 
Medical History Other than Haemophilia A 
Overall, 37 of 63 patients (58.7%) reported at least one medical condition other than haemophilia. The 
most frequently reported conditions were haemophilic arthropathy (14.3%), seasonal allergy (9.5%), 
and iron deficiency anaemia (6.3%). All other medical conditions were each reported by <5.0% of the 
patients. One patient (#7013) experienced 4 events of haemorrhage intracranial prior to the study. 
Previous medications were reported for 12 patients (19.0%), and analgesics was the most frequently 
reported class of medications, reported in 5 patients (7.9%). 
Concomitant Medications other than for Haemophilia A 
The majority of patients (53 patients, 84.1%) received at least one concomitant treatment after baseline. 
The most frequently reported class of medications was analgesics (30 patients, 47.6%) followed by 
vaccines, toxoids and serologic agents, antihistamines, and haemostatics (> 20% patients). 
A total of 16 patients (25.4%) had vaccinations during the study. Of a total of 46 vaccinations received, 
35 were SC, and 11 were intramuscular. Three AEs of vaccination site erythema were associated with the 
concomitant administration of SC vaccinations in 3 patients. 
Numbers analysed 
63 paediatric patients (60 patients < 12 years of age, including 10 patients ≤ 2 years, and 3 patients ≥ 
12 years of age and < 40 kg) with congenital haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors, who were receiving 
bypassing agents as a previous treatment. 
Of the 63 patients, 19 patients had participated in the non-intervention study NIS BH29768.

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy data is presented for the ABR Patients <12 Years population with at least 12 weeks 
of treatment (n=59). Results are summarised in the following table: 
Table 58: Annualised bleed rate overview (treated patients aged < 12 years, ABR population) 
Overall, 51 of the 59 patients (86.4%) had 0 treated bleeds (ABR=0) while receiving emicizumab 
prophylaxis. Eight patients (13.6%) had 11 treated bleeds, all but 1 were traumatic. No patient reported 
>2 treated bleeds. 
The number of all bleeds experienced in the study was mainly driven by 4 patients (6.7%) who 
experienced >10 bleeds each. Of these, 1 patient experienced 36 bleeds, 1 patient experienced 17 
bleeds, and 2 patients experienced 14 bleeds each. 
Overall, 58 of 59 patients (98.3%) had reported 0 treated spontaneous bleeds (ABR=0). One patient 
(1.7%) experienced 1 treated spontaneous bleed (ABR of 0.85, efficacy period=431 days), categorized as 
“other” (left hip). 
Overall, 53 of 59 patients (89.8%) reported 0 treated joint bleeds (ABR=0). Treated joint bleeds were 
reported by 6 patients with individual ABRs ranging from 0.88 to 4.54. 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 118/180 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Similarly, 57 of 59 patients (96.6%) reported 0 treated target joint bleeds (ABR=0). Treated target joint 
bleeds were reported by 2 patients whose individual ABRs were 1.86 (efficacy period=196 days) and 4.54 
(efficacy period=161 days). 
Intra-patient comparison in study NIS BH29768 
Nineteen patients enrolled in Study BH29992 had previously participated in non-intervention study NIS 
BH29768 and therefore had data available to serve as a historical comparator and allow for an 
intra-patient comparison. Of these, 18 patients were <12 years of age and had been in this study for at 
least 12 weeks at the time of the cut-off and were therefore included in the intra-patient comparison 
(“NIS Patients on BH29992 for ≥12 Weeks and <12 Years” population). 
The efficacy period in NIS BH29768 for the 18 patients ranged from 61-309 days, while in Study 
BH29992, it ranged from 184-441 days. The median duration of efficacy period in Study BH29992 for the 
18 patients was 59.0 weeks (range: 26.3-63.0). 
Prior to enrolling in Study BH29992, 15 of 18 patients <12 years old were on prophylactic treatment with 
bypassing agents, and 3 patients were on episodic treatment with bypassing agents. 
The negative binomial regression model analysis of treated bleeds in the intra-patient comparison showed 
a 98% reduction in bleed rate (i.e. ABR ratio of 0.02 [95% CI: 0.008; 0.043]) with emicizumab 
prophylaxis compared with previous prophylactic/episodic bypassing agent treatment: 
Table 59: Negative binomial analysis of treated bleeds, intra-patient comparison, NIS 
patients, treated patients aged < 12 years 
Assessment report

In NIS BH29768 the median ABR for treated bleeds was 16.2 (ABR range: 0
4 5 . 8 5 )  a n d  
treated bleeds per patient ranged from 0
3 0  b le e d s .  
In contrast, for these same patients during 
participation in Study BH29992, the median ABR was 0 (range: 0-1.86) and most patients (14 of 18) had 
no treated bleeds. The number of treated bleeds per patient was no more than 2 for any patient (4 
patients had treated bleeds, 2 of whom had 1 treated bleed each and the other 2 had 2 bleeds each). In 
these 4 patients, emicizumab prophylaxis decreased the ABR compared with NIS BH29768 by 95.9%, 
94.5%, 90.3%, and 86.3%. 
Table 60: Intra-patient ABR comparison of categorised number of bleeds and ABR, treated 
bleeds (treated patients aged < 12 years, ABR population 
Overall, for treated bleeds, 14 of 18 patients (77.8%) had experienced 0 bleeds in Study BH29992 
(ABR=0) and 13 of 18 patients (72.2%) had a 100% reduction in ABR compared with the NIS. Fifteen 
patients (83.3%) had an ABR >10 in NIS BH29768 compared with 0 patients in Study BH29992.  
Overall, all patients showed at least an 86% reduction in the ABR in Study BH29992 as compared to the 
NIS BH29768. One patient had an ABR of 0 while on prophylactic bypassing agent treatment in NIS 
BH29768 and on emicizumab prophylaxis in Study BH29992. 
At the cut-off, 10 patients aged <2 years had been enrolled in the study and treated with emicizumab 
prophylaxis (Median: 23.86 weeks, range: 8.3-29.6 weeks).  
Nine of these patients (90.0%) had an efficacy period of ≥12 weeks, and 5 patients (50.0%) had an 
efficacy period of ≥24 weeks. Only 1 patient <2 years of age had an efficacy period of <12 weeks (8.3 
weeks) because enrolment in this age group was still open after the enrolment to Cohort A had been 
closed. 
None of the 10 patients had a treated bleed or a spontaneous bleed. Two of the 10 patients reported at 
least one bleed (untreated), with a total of 5 traumatic non-joint, non-muscle bleeds, categorized as 
“other”. 
Assessment report

In one of these patients, the 3 traumatic bleeds were located on the mouth, right shin, and forehead. In 
the other patient, the 2 traumatic bleeds were located on the right ear and mouth.  
There were no spontaneous, joint, or muscle bleeds in this subgroup. 
Patients ≥12 Years of Age (Weight <40 kg) 
At the cut-off, 3 patients aged ≥12 years (weight <40 kg) had been enrolled in the study and treated with 
emicizumab prophylaxis. Of these 3 patients, 1 patient experienced 0 bleeds (over an efficacy period of 
164 days), 1 patient experienced 1 bleed (over an efficacy period of 193 days), and 1 patient experienced 
4 bleeds (over an efficacy period of 435 days) ( 
The patient with 4 bleeds had 2 treated bleeds, 1 of which was a traumatic bleed classified as “other” 
(non-joint, non-muscle) of the left cheek/face, and the other was a spontaneous muscle bleed in the 
lower left abdomen. The other patient had experienced 1 treated spontaneous bleed classified as “other” 
of the left fingers/thumb. 
The compliance rate with electronic data collection was 92.3% for Adapted Inhib-QoL and 88.2% for 
Haemo-QoL SF.

Of these, only 2 patients received aPCC (1 dose each: 32.82 units/kg for the treatment of a bleed; and 
49.78 units/kg as a preventative dose for surgery/procedure). A total of 14 patients were treated with 
rFVIIa, mainly to treat bleeds (11 patients), rather than as preventative doses before activity (4 patients) 
or for surgery / procedure (1 patient). One patient (age 12 years, weight 38 kg) was treated with 
activated Factor VII concentrate containing factor X (FX) (Byclot), (1 dose; 113.07 µg/kg) to treat a 
bleed. This dose was recorded as rFVIIa, because Byclot is not currently included as a possible treatment 
category on the BMQ.

Generalization of Efficacy and Safety to Paediatric Patients Without Inhibitors 
The data for emicizumab in paediatric patients < 12 years is derived from Study BH29992, which included 
only patients with FVIII inhibitors. However, in regards to the use of emicizumab, patients with or without 
FVIII inhibitors comprise a single population, and safety and efficacy may be generalized between them. 
The MAH has also submitted notification of information obtained on an additional 33 paediatric subjects. 
Factor VIII inhibitors do not recognize emicizumab or interfere with its binding to FIXa and FX, and 
therefore emicizumab restores haemostasis to a similar degree in patients with or without FVIII 
inhibitors. This is further substantiated by the observed similar trough plasma concentrations of 
emicizumab in patients with or without FVIII inhibitors at a given dosing regimen and confirmed by the 
comparable safety profile and efficacy observed in Study BH29884 and Study BH30071. Therefore, the 
efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics observed in paediatric patients with FVIII inhibitors in Study 
BH29992 are generalisable to paediatric patients without FVIII inhibitors. 
Pathophysiology of Haemophilia A is not Changed by Inhibitors against Factor VIII 
Factor VIII inhibitors represent an alloimmune response against exogenously infused FVIII and thus are 
essentially ADAs. While inhibitors have a notable impact on patient management, they do not change the 
underlying pathophysiology or the fundamental disease characteristics of haemophilia A, and as such do 
not represent evolution or progression of the disease. Indeed, the severe coagulopathy results from 
absence of FVIII, and the presence of inhibitors only compromises the ability to prevent or treat bleeds 
with FVIII replacement therapy.

Traditionally, in trials of coagulation factors, patients without inhibitors have contributed to studies of 
FVIII whereas patients with inhibitors have contributed to studies of bypassing agents simply because 
each type of therapy is intended for each subpopulation only. This has led, together with the differences 
in standard of care and the unmet need, to the dichotomization of patients with or without inhibitors in the 
current (pre-emicizumab) haemophilia A therapy framework, which is not relevant when considering 
patients treated with emicizumab. 
Emicizumab Mechanism of Action and PK are Unaffected by Presence of Inhibitors 
The unique mechanism of action of emicizumab makes any distinction between patients with or without 
inhibitors irrelevant in this context. Emicizumab bridges FIXa and FX to restore the function of missing 
FVIIIa. Since it has no structural relationship or sequence homology to FVIII, inhibitors do not recognize 
emicizumab, interfere with its binding toFIXa and FX, or affect levels of FIXa or FX. Thus, emicizumab has 
the same impact on the underlying pathophysiology of haemophilia A (i.e., lack of FVIII function) whether 
or not inhibitors are present. 
Importantly, similar trough plasma concentrations of emicizumab were observed at steady state in 
patients with and without FVIII inhibitors receiving the 1.5 mg/kg QW maintenance dose in Study 
BH29884 and Study BH30071, respectively. Steady state was achieved after 4 loading doses and 
remained stable at the maintenance dose (mean trough concentrations of approximately 52 μg/ml in both 
studies: 
Figure 38: Mean emicizumab trough concentrations (QW dosing regimen) in studies BH29884 
and BH300071 
The comparable trough plasma concentrations are an experimental proof that emicizumab 
pharmacokinetics is unaffected by either the presence of inhibitors or by the use of different concomitant 
haemophilia A treatments (e.g., FVIII or bypassing agents). 
These data indicate that in regard to emicizumab, patients with or without inhibitors comprise a single 
population, and therefore the observed efficacy benefit in Study BH29992 is generalizable to all paediatric 
patients with haemophilia A.

Generalization of Efficacy and Safety of Q2W Regimen to Adult Patients With Inhibitors 
The MAH posits that the efficacy and safety for emicizumab can be generalized between patients with or 
without FVIII inhibitors. Therefore, the efficacy and safety observed with the emicizumab Q2W regimen in 
adults and adolescents in BH30071 is applicable to all adults and adolescents with haemophilia A, 
irrespective of inhibitor status. 
Importantly, although the dose administered Q2W is twice the weekly dose, due to emicizumab’s slow 
absorption, the mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is only minimally higher. Modelling of 
emicizumab plasma-time concentration profiles shows that 95th percentiles of Cmax are 82.4 and 85.9 
ug/mL for the QW and Q2W regimens, respectively (X-link SCP Section 3.2.8). Thus, the safety profile of 
QW emicizumab maintenance in adults with FVIII inhibitors (in Study BH29884) can be considered 
representative of the safety profile in adults with FVIII inhibitors should they receive Q2W emicizumab 
maintenance. 
Extrapolation of Q2W and Q4W Regimens to Paediatric Patients 
The data for emicizumab in paediatric patients < 12 years is derived from Study BH29992, which included 
only QW maintenance dosing. However, as emicizumab PK and efficacy is similar in adult, adolescent, and 
paediatric patients, the efficacy of the Q2W and Q4W maintenance dosing regimens observed in Studies 
BH30071 and BO39182 in adult and adolescent patients ≥ 12 years may be extrapolated to paediatric 
patients < 12 years. 
Haemophilia A is a congenital disease with a similar pathophysiology throughout the patient’s life and 
same treatment paradigm regardless of age. Emicizumab concentration measurements from Studies 
BH29992, BH29884 and BH30071 demonstrate concordance of PK in paediatric and adult patients 
receiving emicizumab QW. These data indicate that age does not affect exposure to emicizumab. Thus, 
the PK observed in adults receiving Q2W or Q4W maintenance dosing regimens can be extrapolated to 
paediatric patients and, with it, the robust and clinically meaningful efficacy for these additional regimens 
as observed in Studies BH30071 and BO39182. 
Importantly, the 95th percentile of emicizumab concentrations at Cmax is estimated to be approximately 
82.4, 85.9, and 97.7 μg/mL in the QW, Q2W and Q4W regimens, respectively. Thus, since the various 
regimens result in a comparable Cmax, the acceptable safety profile of QW emicizumab maintenance 
established in Study BH29992 would be predicted to be representative of the safety profile of children 
who would receive Q2W or Q4W emicizumab maintenance. 
Background 
In accordance with EMA and FDA guidelines and positions on extrapolation (EMA/199678/2016; 
EMA/478467/2016; EMA/129698/2012; Dunne et al. 2011), the initial emicizumab approval was 
supported by a PK-based extrapolation of the efficacy of emicizumab from adult/adolescent patients with 
inhibitors (evaluated in the randomized controlled trial BH29884) to children with inhibitors (evaluated in 
the single-arm descriptive paediatric trial BH29992), to support an indication of emicizumab prophylaxis 
in adult and paediatric patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors, using a weekly maintenance dose of 
1.5 mg/kg. These studies demonstrated consistent exposure in adults, adolescents, and children, 
allowing for extrapolation of efficacy from adult / adolescent to paediatric patients. Study BH29992 also 
provided adequate safety data to characterize the safety profile of emicizumab in children. 
This approach is in line with several paediatric approvals in haemophilia A that have been obtained based 
on a randomized study with hypothesis testing in adolescents and adults, which formally demonstrated 
efficacy, and a descriptive paediatric study which investigated the safety and PK (e.g., Adynovate 
(pegylated full-length rFVIII), Eloctate (rFVIII, Fc fusion protein) and Nuwiq (rFVIII, B-domain deleted)).

Haemophilia A has Similar Pathophysiology in Children and Adults 
Haemophilia A is a congenital disease in which the lack of FVIII function since birth results in severe 
bleeding diathesis throughout patients’ lives. Accordingly, restoring FVIII function and thereby adequate 
hemostasis is the ultimate goal of management, independent of age. Coagulation factors in newborns and 
adults are qualitatively similar in their molecular weights and degree of glycosylation (Hassan et al. 
1990). The 
coagulation cascade is almost mature at birth, with well-balanced hemostasis and thrombosis, and is fully 
mature at 6 months of age (Andrew et al. 1987, Revel-Vilk et al. 2012). Notably, FVIII activity at birth is 
equivalent to adult activity level and remains stable from the newborn period onwards (Kuhle et al. 2003). 
Consequently, dosing strategies are similar for adult and for paediatric haemophilia A patients, including 
infants (Mahlangu et al. 2014, Young et al. 2015). Emicizumab mimics FVIII activity and binds the same 
qualitatively identical factor FIX (FIX) and FX, and should therefore be efficacious in children with 
haemophilia A, as confirmed in HAVEN 2. 
Pharmacokinetics and Exposure-Response Relationship 
Study BH29992 provides key paediatric exposure data for patients from 1 to 12 years of age receiving 1.5 
mg/kg QW maintenance dose. The observed PK profiles in patients aged ≤ 12 years are consistent with 
those observed in patients aged > 12 years in Study BH29884 and Study BH30071. Steady state was 
reached with plasma concentrations of 52.8 μg/mL and 53.4 μg/mL at Week 5, in Study BH29992 and in 
pooled Studies BH29884 and BH30071, respectively. Thereafter, mean plasma concentrations remained 
stable. Importantly, similar emicizumab trough concentrations were observed in the various age 
categories with the QW regimen (the 5 patients aged < 2 years achieved trough concentrations similar to 
older children within the same study and to adults in Study BH29884). 
The consistent PK measurements regardless of age indicate that the emicizumab PK observed in 
adult/adolescents with Q2W or Q4W regimens may be extrapolated to paediatric patients. The previously 
submitted exposure-efficacy analysis (an updated analysis is included in the filing) establishes a link 
between PK and efficacy. Therefore, the Sponsor posits that the age-consistent PK observed with the QW 
regimen allows extrapolation of the observed efficacy in adults receiving emicizumab maintenance doses 
with the Q2W (Study BH30071) or Q4W (Study BO39182) regimens to children.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This MAH applied for two additional posology recommendations for adults and children with haemophilia 
A with and without factor VIII inhibitors. The proposed dosing regimen includes a loading dose of 3 mg/kg 
once weekly followed by a maintenance dose of either 3 mg/kg every two weeks or 6 mg/kg every 4 
weeks, and from week 5 on 3 or 6 mg/kg. 
Although the Q2W and Q4W regimens were studied in patients ≥ 12 years of age, the PK consistency 
across age supports extrapolation of these regimens to the whole age range of the paediatric population. 
The availability of several efficacious dosing regimens for emicizumab will allow individualization of the 
regimen to the patients’ needs and lifestyle  
Overall, the clinical efficacy, safety and exposure-response relationships confirm the appropriateness of 3 
mg/kg QW for the first 4 weeks, followed by either 1.5 mg/kg QW, 3 mg/kg Q2W or 6 mg/kg Q4W in the 
overall population of patients (children, adolescents and adults) with haemophilia A with or without 
inhibitors to FVIII. Hence, the proposed new posology can be recommended. 
Study BH30071 (HAVEN-3) 
Design and conduct 
Study BH30071 (HAVEN-3) is a randomised, multi-centre, open-label study. The study enrolled 152 
patients with severe congenital haemophilia A (intrinsic FVIII level < 1%) aged 12 years or older and with 
a body weight ≥ 40 kg. Other inclusion criteria were: a negative test for factor VIII inhibitors (and with 
evidence of lack of the presence of an inhibitor for the last 5 years); documentation of treatment and 
bleeding episodes over the last 24 weeks; ≥5 bleeds in the last 24 weeks for those on episodic treatment; 
acceptable laboratory tests. All subjects were male. Out of 152 patients in total, 8 were 12-18yrs and 5 
were over age 65yrs. 3 subjects reported a past history of inhibitors. 94 subjects had a history of episodic 
treatment in the last 24 weeks and 73 reported on prophylactic treatment for that period. 
The study had 4 arms. Patients who received episodic treatment with FVIII prior to study entry and 
experienced at least 5 bleeds over the 24 weeks prior to study entry (equivalent to annualized bleeding 
rate [ABR] ≥ 10) were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to the following regimens: 
• 
• 
Emicizumab prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg QW SC for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg QW SC (Arm A), 
36 subjects 
Emicizumab prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg QW SC for 4 weeks, followed by 3 mg/kg Q2W SC (Arm B), 
35 subjects 
•  No prophylaxis control arm (Arm C), 18 subjects 
Randomization was stratified according to the number of bleeds patients experienced over the last 24 
weeks prior to study entry (< 9 or ≥ 9 bleeds [equivalent to annualised bleed rate = 18]). Patients who 
were randomized to the no prophylaxis arm (control arm, Arm C) could switch to receive emicizumab 
prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg Q2W maintenance dose after completing 24 weeks in the study. Patients who 
received FVIII prophylaxis prior to study entry were enrolled in Arm D [63 subjects] to receive 
emicizumab prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg QW SC for 4 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg QW SC.  
All patients reported receiving treatment with FVIII in the 24 weeks prior to enrolment. The median 
number of bleeds in the 24 weeks prior to enrolment was between 11.5 and 16.5 in the randomized 
patients, and 2.0 in Arm D.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Bleed rate was defined as the number of bleeds over the efficacy period. A bleed was counted in the 
primary analysis if it was treated with coagulation factors and fulfilled the adapted International Society 
on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria. 
The number of bleeds was also annualized for each patient using the following formula: 
ABR = (Number of bleeds / Total number of days during the efficacy period) x 365.25. 
Endpoints were assessed using a negative binomial regression model. A bleed was considered to be a 
“treated bleed” if it was directly followed (i.e. there was not an intervening bleed) by a haemophilia 
medication reported to be a “treatment for bleed”, irrespective of the time between the treatment and the 
preceding bleed. 
Over 94% of subjects have over 24 weeks of study time 
Emicizumab prophylaxis with the maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg QW resulted in a 96% reduction in rate 
of treated bleeds compared with no prophylaxis (annualised bleed rate cohort A/ cohort C ratio = 0.04; p 
< 0.0001); similarly, emicizumab prophylaxis with the maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W led to a 97% 
reduction in rate of treated bleeds, compared with no prophylaxis (annualised bleed rate cohort B / cohort 
C ratio = 0.03; p < 0.0001). The study met its main endpoint. 
For 36 subjects exposed to 1.5mg/kg ecicizumab qw sc, the negative binomial model-based annualised 
bleed rate for treated bleeds was 1.5 (95% CI: 0.89, 2.47) and for all bleeds was 2.5 (95% CI: 1.63, 
3.90). 
For 35 subjects exposed to 3mg/kg ecicizumab q2w sc, the negative binomial model-based annualised 
bleed rate for treated bleeds was 1.3 (95% CI: 0.75, 2.27) and for all bleeds was 2.6 (95% CI: 1.63, 
4.29). 
For 18 subjects who did not receive prophylaxis, the negative binomial model-based annualised bleed 
rate for treated bleeds was 38.2 (95% CI: 22.86, 63.76) and for all bleeds was 47.6 (95% CI: 20.45, 
79.59). 
The proportion of patients experiencing zero treated bleeding episodes while on emicizumab prophylaxis 
was 55.6% and 60.0% in Arms A and B, respectively, compared to 0% in Arm Ccontrol. The proportion of 
patients with 0-3 treated bleeds was 91.7% and 94.3% in Arms A and B, respectively, compared to 5.6% 
in Arm C control. 
The annualised bleed rate of all bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, treated joint bleeds and treated 
target joint bleeds showed similar reductions to those reported for the annualised bleed rate of all bleeds 
i.e. data were supportive. 
HAVEN-3 did not include subjects with inhibitors. In order to justify its claim for use of the posology of 
3mg/kg q2w for subjects with inhibitors, the MAH conducted an extrapolation exercise. 
The MAH has conducted an intra-patient comparison of bleeds whilst exposed to emicizumab versus 
bleeds whilst on standard care (data obtained via the non-intervention study BH29768. The intra-patient 
exercise is not considered a fair comparison. Patients in the non-intervention study had markedly reduced 
compliance with treatment compared to the emicizumab exposed population whose treatment was 
administered in a health facility and under supervision. The above results are viewed in a general sense 
only.

The MAH arranged endpoints in a hierarchy with penalty if an analysis did not pass stated criteria [as is 
the case for the intra-patient comparison] and so results of various quality of life questionnaires are noted 
in a general sense only; results would not give rise to any particular concern. 
The MAH conducted a survey of patient preference. Whilst results of the survey suggest that there was 
overwhelming preference for the current product, it is recognised that the study took place with an 
open-label, uncontrolled design and so the opinion of subjects is highly likely to have been unduly 
influenced as a result. Results of the preference survey are viewed in a general sense and are considered 
to be broadly supportive of the claims of the MAH. 
Study BO39182 (HAVEN-4) 
Design and conduct 
Study BO39182 (HAVEN-4) is a multi-centre, open-label study. The study enrolled 48 patients with 
severe congenital haemophilia A (intrinsic FVIII level < 1%) aged 12 years or older and with a body 
weight ≥ 40 kg. Subjects were either with or without the presence of inhibitors to FVIII. 
7/48 subjects took part in a run-in PK study. The main efficacy analysis was of the 41/48 subjects who did 
not take part in the PK run-in study.  
All patients were male. Most (75.6%) were White. The median age of enrolled patients was 39.0 years 
(range: 14 – 68 years). Most (92.7%) were adults aged ≥ 18 years and 3 patients (7.3%) were aged <18 
years. There were 3 patients (7.3%) ≥65 years of age in the study. 
11 patients (28.9%) on study had a history of FVIII inhibitor diagnosis. 6/11 patients did not test positive 
for FVIII inhibitors at study entry. Out of these 6 patients, 2 had undergone ITI. The mean time from FVIII 
inhibitor diagnosis was 234.7 months, with 9 of 11 patients diagnosed ≥ 72 months prior to study entry. 
30 patients (73.2%) were categorised as being on prior prophylactic treatment, mainly short acting FVIII 
(23 patients, 76.7%). Episodic treatment in the 24 weeks prior to the study start was recorded for 19 
patients (11 patients who were on episodic treatment and 8 patients who were on prophylactic 
treatment), mostly short acting FVIII (14 patients, 73.7%). 
The median number of bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry was 5.0 (range: 0-90). 
Subjects in the main cohort were administered emicizumab prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg QW SC for 4 weeks 
followed by 6 mg/kg Q4W SC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Bleed rates and analyses were as described for study HAVEN-3. The MAH submitted an updated study 
report during the evaluation of this application. At the CCOD for this primary analysis, the median 
duration of exposure was 24.14 weeks (range: 23.6-28.1). The median number of doses received was 
10.0 (range: 10-11, corresponding to a range of 6 to 7 maintenance doses of 6 mg/kg), with a median 
cumulative dose of 3660 mg (range: 2175-5040). 
There were no missed doses (defined as > 42 days between 2 doses), and all patients received the correct 
amount at each dose.  
Drug administrations were monitored in-clinic from weeks 1 to 25; no patients had drug administration 
problems.

• 
The NB model-based ABR for treated bleeds was 2.4 (95% CI: 1.38, 4.28), and the median ABR 
was 0.0 (IQR: 0.00, 2.08). 
•  23 patients (56.1%) did not experience any treated bleeds. In total, 37 patients (90.2%) 
experienced 0 to 3 treated bleeds. 
• 
• 
The model-based ABR for treated spontaneous bleeds was 0.6 (95% CI: 0.27, 1.53), and the 
median ABR was 0.0 (IQR: 0.00, 0.00). Most patients (n = 34, 82.9%) did not experience any 
treated spontaneous bleeds while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis and 97.6% of patients 
experienced 0 to 3 treated spontaneous bleeds. 
The model-based ABR was 1.7 (95% CI: 0.82, 3.68) for treated joint bleeds and 1.0 (95% CI: 
0.31, 3.26) for treated target joint bleeds. The median ABR was 0.0 (IQR: 0.00, 1.85) for treated 
joint bleeds and 0.0 (IQR: 0.00, 0.00) for treated target joint bleeds 
•  12 (29.3% [95% CI: 16.1, 45.5]) patients experienced 0 all bleeds (i.e. ABR = 0); 17 patients 
had ABR between 1 and ≤5, 7 had an ABR between 5 and ≤10 and 5 had an ABR >10 (one subject 
had an ABR of 37). 
The MAH submitted results of a preference survey. Whilst results of the survey suggest that there was 
overwhelming preference for the current product, it is recognised that the study took place with an 
open-label, uncontrolled design and so the opinion of subjects is highly likely to have been unduly 
influenced as a result. Results of the preference survey are viewed in a general sense and are considered 
[in that general sense] to be broadly supportive of the claims of the MAH. 
BH29884 (HAVEN 1) 
Design and conduct 
BH29884 (HAVEN 1) is a randomised, multi-centre, open-label study. The study was previously submitted 
to support the initial MA; the MAH has submitted an update of experience beyond 24 weeks of exposure 
to study product and with an additional 4 patients recruited. 
The study enrolled 113 Haemophilia A patients aged ≥ 12 years with documented historical high-titre 
inhibitors (≥ 5 BUs) against FVIII who were treated with episodic or prophylactic bypassing agents prior 
to study entry, with ≥ 6 bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to screening (if on an episodic bypassing agent 
regimen) or ≥ 2 bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to screening (if on a prophylactic bypassing agent 
regimen). Emicizumab was administered at a weekly loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg SC for the first 4 weeks 
followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC i.e. the update reports on extended exposure to 
1.5 mg/kg/week emicizumab. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Bleed rates and analyses were as previously described. The majority (82.3%) of patients had ≥ 48 weeks 
follow-up at cut-off. 
Model-based annualised bleed rate (95% CI) for treated bleeds across all treatment arms in the all 
emicizumab-treated patients was 2.7 (1.64, 4.35), mean (95% CI) calculated annualised bleed rate was 
2.8 (0.53, 8.45). These results are consistent with those reported in the Primary CSR (4.6 and 4.7 
respectively). 
The lower figures now reported are explained by the MAH as follows: mean calculated annualised bleed 
rates for treated bleeds estimated by interval decreased over time and the improvement was sustained 
up to Week 72. 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 137/180 
 
 
 
 
 
Median calculated annualised bleed rate was zero for all endpoints (i.e., treated bleeds, treated 
spontaneous bleeds, treated joint bleeds, and treated target joint bleeds), consistent with the Primary 
CSR. 
The MAH has conducted an intra-patient comparison of bleeds whilst exposed to emicizumab versus 
bleeds whilst on standard care (data obtained via the non-intervention study BH29768). The intra-patient 
exercise is not considered a fair comparison. Patients in the non-intervention study had markedly reduced 
compliance with treatment compared to the emicizumab exposed population whose treatment was 
administered in a health facility and under supervision. The above results are viewed in a general sense 
only. 
BH29992 (HAVEN 2) 
Design and conduct 
BH29992 (HAVEN 2) is a single-arm, multi-centre, open-label study. The study was submitted previously 
to support the application for a licence; the MAH now submits an update. 
The study enrolled 63 paediatric patients (60 patients < 12 years of age, including 10 patients ≤ 2 years, 
and 3 patients ≥ 12 years of age and < 40 kg) with congenital haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors, who 
were receiving bypassing agents as a previous treatment. Most (95.2%) had severe haemophilia.  
All subjects were male with a mean age of 6.6yrs (range 1 – 15yrs). The study population was 
multi-ethnic. The average weight was 26.6kg and average height was 120cm. There was a median of 6 
bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry (range: 0-155 bleeds). Upon study entry, subjects were 
administered a weekly loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg SC of emicizumab for the first 4 weeks followed by a 
maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC for cohort A. [subjects are not yet recruited to cohorts B and C 
(cohorts added as protocol amendment 3 dated 01 Sept 2017)]. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Bleed rates and analyses were as previously described. The primary efficacy data is presented for the 
annualised bleed rate in patients <12 years population with at least 12 weeks of treatment (n=59). The 
median duration of the efficacy period was 29.6 weeks (range: 18.4-63.0) 
51 of the 59 patients (86.4%) had 0 treated bleeds (annualised bleed rate =0) while receiving 
emicizumab prophylaxis. Eight patients (13.6%) had 11 treated bleeds, all but 1 were traumatic. No 
patient reported >2 treated bleeds. 
58 of 59 patients (98.3%) had reported 0 treated spontaneous bleeds (annualised bleed rate =0). One 
patient (1.7%) experienced 1 treated spontaneous bleed (annualised bleed rate of 0.85, efficacy 
period=431 days), categorized as “other” (left hip). 
53 of 59 patients (89.8%) reported 0 treated joint bleeds (annualised bleed rate =0). Treated joint bleeds 
were reported by 6 patients with individual annualised bleed rates ranging from 0.88 to 4.54. 
57 of 59 patients (96.6%) reported 0 treated target joint bleeds (annualised bleed rate =0). Treated 
target joint bleeds were reported by 2 patients whose individual annualised bleed rates were 1.86 
(efficacy period=196 days) and 4.54 (efficacy period=161 days). 
The MAH reported on an intra-patient comparison exercise. The intra-patient comparison exercise is 
generally supportive towards a claim of efficacy [yet such a comparison of real-world experience versus 
experience in clinical studies is not considered a ‘fair comparison’ upon which to make clinical / scientific 
judgement].

Additional expert consultation 
An ad hoc expert group meeting was convened on the 25th January 2019 to discuss the following points 
relating to the clinical need in mild and moderate haemophilia A patients: 
1. Is there a clinical need for Hemlibra in the management of patients with mild or moderate 
congenital haemophilia A without inhibitors to FVIII and what is that need? 
In principle, there would be a clinical need for safe and effective medicines for a subgroup of patients with 
moderate haemophilia for whom prophylaxis is considered appropriate (e.g., patients with FVIII levels 
less than 5%), particularly if easy to administer compared to frequent intravenous administration of 
existing options. There may be a need for some with mild haemophilia A (but there is a need to show a 
benefit in the moderate population first). 
However, in the case of Hemlibra, due to lack of exhaustive pre-clinical data, and lack of clinical data, it 
is not possible to conclude that the product has relevant efficacy in this population. It is indeed possible, 
that the efficacy observed in severe haemophilia cannot be easily extrapolated to patients with higher 
levels of FVIII. Furthermore, the submitted in vitro data are too limited to predict the complexity of the 
coagulation system in vivo and justify any extrapolation from severe to moderate haemophilia. More 
importantly, there are safety concerns from a pharmacodynamic point of view (long half-life; 
irreversibility of the effect; insensitivity to physiological control mechanisms of thrombin generation such 
as those based on thrombomodulin-APC system) and the risk of acute or chronic thrombosis given the 
observation of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and thromboembolic events in 5 patients who received 
emicizumab as routine prophylaxis in the clinical programme. Clinical and extensive non-clinical data 
should be available before the benefits and risks can be properly assessed in non-severe haemophilia. 
2. What would be the characteristics of patients with mild or moderate congenital 
haemophilia A without inhibitors to FVIII who are likely to benefit from exposure to 
Hemlibra? 
There were different views on the subgroup of non-severe haemophilia patients who might benefit from 
prophylaxis treatment. There was general agreement that currently, routine prophylaxis to be 
investigated for Hemlibra would include: 
• 
Moderate haemophilia A patients with FVIII levels ≤  5% (based on den Uijl et al., 2011) and who 
had a first spontaneous intra-articular bleed before the age of 5 years 
or 
•  Moderate haemophilia A patients with FVIII levels ≤  5% who were already started on a 
prophylaxis regimen with a long-term prophylaxis intention  
However, it was acknowledged that practices may vary and compliance with frequent i.v. administrations 
is an issue. 
3. In the absence of a formal clinical trial of use of Hemlibra in the management of patients 
with mild or moderate congenital haemophilia A without inhibitors to FVIII; are the 
laboratory and pre-clinical data submitted by the company thus far adequate to address 
concerns over unknown, unpredictable risk and clinical safety in this sub-group of patients? 
The company’s laboratory and non-clinical data submitted are not sufficient to address the safety 
concerns (mainly the risk of thrombosis and TMA) and do not predict its clinical effects. There was also 
concern regarding how effective Hemlibra would be with measurable levels of circulating FVIII given the 
PK data. Clinical data (and extensive non-clinical data) should be available before the benefits and risks 
can be sufficiently assessed in patients with non-severe haemophilia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019  
Page 139/180 
 
 
 
 
4. Is a formal clinical trial in subjects with mild or moderate congenital haemophilia A without 
inhibitors to FVIII preferred and what aspects of safety would require particular attention? 
The experts agreed that a clinical trial in the relevant population is warranted to demonstrate efficacy. 
Concerning safety, extensive non-clinical studies and laboratory markers of thrombosis and thrombotic 
microangiopathy, such as plasma concentrations of prothrombin fragment F1 + 2, soluble fibrin, D-dimer, 
and thrombin-antithrombin complex, TGA with a suitable triggering agent, FVIII central assessment) in 
this clinical study would provide useful information about the risk of thrombosis and TMA. A 
post-authorisation safety study would likely also be needed considering that a clinical trial may not be 
adequately powered to fully address safety concerns.  
In addition, the lack of data in children less than 1 year and the need to generate data in this group given 
that not only PK but also the coagulation system is likely to be different in the new born children was also 
raised. 
Finally, the need for generating data in patients needing surgery was also expressed as relevant.   
Third party intervention 
The CHMP received a letter from another company (hereinafter referred to as “third party”) on 09 August 
2018 in which a number of concerns were raised with regards to the studies used by the MAH to support 
its application. 
The MAH was invited to comment on the issues raised by the third party and submitted its response on 19 
September 2018. 
The main issue pertain to the intra-patient comparisons to by-passing agents in studies HAVEN-1 and 
HAVEN-2 and HAVEN-3 and in addition the 3rd party highlighted several deficiencies with regards to the 
study design of HAVEN-3. 
CHMP Conclusion  
The third party has raised numerous points of contention that are considered to fall within the points 
already raised by the CHMP. 
It is acknowledged that direct evidence provides the best evidence of relative clinical effect in order to 
avoid bias and so render fair comparison. From a statistical point of view, randomised trials would have 
been preferred.  
It is appreciated that subjects in the non-intervention studies would have been managed at different 
centres by different physicians with different preference for management. It is considered that the 
analysis of ‘usual care’ as all being equivalent or essentially the same would confound analysis and lead 
to the introduction of uncertainty.  
The SmPC for Hemlibra describes annualised bleed rates (ABR) for ‘all bleeds’, ‘treated bleeds’, ‘treated 
spontaneous bleeds’, ‘treated joint bleeds’ and ‘treated target joint bleeds’ for the HAVEN studies i.e. the 
attending physician has access to this data and so is able to make an informed decision. An attending 
physician will be aware of the subjective nature that patients have in treating bleeds. 
Overall, the main points raised of contention have been resolved by addressing the limitations of the 
comparisons for the HAVEN studies in section 5.1 of the SmPC for awareness of the physician.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
It is considered that data on the paediatric population within the HAVEN studies along with the 
extrapolation reasoning of the company permit acceptance of the claim of efficacy in the paediatric 
population without inhibitors. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in adult and paediatric subjects with severe congenital 
Haemophilia A and without inhibitors present. 
Clinical efficacy has not been demonstrated in subjects with mild or moderate grades of congenital 
Haemophilia A without inhibitors. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Overview of Studies Contributing to Safety Information 
The current submission includes clinical data from two new pivotal Phase III studies: 
• 
results of the primary analysis of Study BH30071 (also known as Study HAVEN 3) in adult and 
adolescent patients (≥ 12 years of age) with haemophilia A without inhibitors that evaluated QW 
and Q2W dosing regimens, results of an interim analysis of Study BO39182 (also known as Study 
HAVEN 4) in adult and adolescent patients (≥ 12 years of age) with or without inhibitors that 
evaluated Q4W dosing regimen.  
In addition, the current submission includes updated results (QW dosing) from the previously submitted: 
•  Study BH29992 (also known as Study HAVEN 2) in children and infants < 12 years of age with 
inhibitors (now comprising results from 60 patients < 12 years of age, of which 5 patients are < 
2 years of age) and  
•  Study BH29884 (also known as Study HAVEN 1) in adult and adolescent patients (≥ 12 years of 
age) with inhibitors 
Updated long-term data from ongoing Phase I/II extension Study ACE002JP (extension of ACE001JP Part 
C) in adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years of age with haemophilia A with or without inhibitors is also 
included in the current submission. 
An overview of the studies now submitted is given in the following table:

Serious adverse events, medication errors and off-label use were monitored in the following additional 
studies or compassionate use requests:  
•  Study MO39129 (also known as STASEY study), a single-arm, multi-centre, open-label Phase IIIb 
clinical study enrols patients aged 12 years or older with haemophilia A who have persistent 
inhibitors against FVIII at enrolment. This study is being conducted to enhance the safety data that 
have been obtained as part of the clinical development program. At the cut-off of 18 Oct 2017, only 
7 patients were exposed to emicizumab for a maximum duration of 6 weeks. 
•  US Early Access Program (ML39356): At the cut-off of 18 Oct 2017, 28 patients (including 3 
paediatric patients) received emicizumab 
•  Compassionate Use Requests (MO29988): At the cut-off of 18 Oct 2017, 6 patients have received 
emicizumab under single case compassionate use requests: 2 in Belgium, 1 in France, 1 in Lithuania, 
1 in the UK, and 1 in Australia 
Safety monitoring in the emicizumab clinical studies (BH30071, BO39182, BH29992, BH29884, and 
ACE002JP) consisted of collection of adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory tests (standard 
haematology and blood chemistry), pharmacodynamic parameters, anti-emicizumab antibodies, anti-FVIII 
antibodies (inhibitor titres) and physical observations / measurements (vital signs, electrocardiograms). 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 20.1 was used to classify. 
Patients who withdrew from treatment at any point in Studies BH30071, BO39182, BH29992, and BH29884 
were required to return for a safety follow-up visit 24 weeks after the last administration of emicizumab and 
expected to continue to record their bleeds and haemophilia medications exposure during this period. 
In these studies, the World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity grading scale was used for assessing AE 
severity (WHO 2003), as shown: 
Table 68: adverse event severity grading scale for events not specifically listed in WHO toxicity 
grading scale 
In Study ACE002JP, the safety follow-up period started 3 weeks after the scheduled date of the last 
emicizumab treatment and then for up to 34 weeks more, dependent upon dosing scheme. 
In Study ACE002JP, the severity of AEs was assessed according to the following criteria: 
•  Mild: does not interfere with the subject’s normal activities 
•  Moderate: interferes with the subject's normal activities 
•  Severe: completely prevents the subject's normal activities and inevitably requires intervention or 
discontinuation of treatment with emicizumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019

Selected adverse events for emicizumab included: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
injection site reactions 
thromboembolic events 
thrombotic microangiopathy 
systemic hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic reactions) 
For studies BH30071, BO39182, BH29992, and BH29884: a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) method was used to analyse anti-therapeutic antibodies in plasma. The sensitivity of the method 
was 6.04 ng/mL. The assay precision for: 
•  Study BH30071 was 4.0% to 4.9%,  
•  Study BH29884 was 2.6% to 5.4%,  
•  Study BO39182 was 2.7% to 4.4%,  
• 
and for Study BH29992 was 3.8% to 5.9%. 
In Study ACE002JP, anti-emicizumab antibodies were measured using electrochemiluminescence and 
ELISA. 
Pooling of data 
Safety data from Studies BH30071, BO39182, BH29992, and BH29884 with the three maintenance dosing 
regimens proposed for the label (1.5 mg/kg QW, 3 mg/kg Q2W, and 6 mg/kg Q4W) are pooled and are 
referred to as the “all exposure population” (N = 373). 
[Updated safety data from Study ACE002JP are presented separately because this was a study of only 18 
subjects exposed to a different dosing regimen from the main studies]

Patient exposure 
Overall extent of exposure 
373 patients have received at least one dose of emicizumab, with an overall exposure of 298.4 
patient-years.

Table 70: Emicizumab exposure by study  
The duration of exposure to emicizumab and number of patients exposed varied between studies. Overall, 
the median duration of exposure was 34.1 weeks (range: 0.1-94.3 weeks). Patients in BH29884 had the 
longest median exposure (62 weeks, with 78.6% of patients with more than 52 weeks of exposure). Patients 
in BO39182 had the shorter median exposure (24.1 weeks). 
41 of 373 patients (11.0%) missed ≥1 dose of study product. Of these, 33 patients were in Study BH29884, 
and 8 patients were in Study BH30071. 
14 of 373 received emicizumab injections that deviated from the planned dose (<90% or >110%), for either 
the loading or maintenance doses. 
No patients in Studies BO39182 and BH29992 had missed doses or dose deviations. 
Exposure to Non-Emicizumab Haemophilia A Medication 
Although prophylaxis with non-emicizumab haemophilia A medication was prohibited or limited to first week 
for patients on prior FVIII prophylaxis, short-term, focused prophylaxis before activity or before 
procedure/surgery was allowed. Drugs intended to control or prevent bleeds were administered in the 
studies. 
Table 71: Number of patients exposed to non-emicizumab haemophilia medications 
administered while on study 
Most patients used non-emicizumab haemophilia A medications for treatment of bleeds (39.4%) rather than 
preventative doses before activity (23.3%) or for procedure/surgery (7.2%).

Procedures and Surgeries While Receiving Emicizumab Prophylaxis 
Although patients who had planned major surgeries were excluded from the studies, enrolled patients 
underwent unplanned or minor surgeries and procedures in Studies BH30071, BO39182, BH29884, and 
BH29992 while receiving emicizumab. Perioperatively, investigators decided based on clinical judgment, 
whether and how much hemostatic support was needed; no guidance was provided by the Sponsor with the 
exception of protocol amendments. Limited information regarding patients who underwent surgical 
procedures is available, as these studies were not designed to proactively collect such details. 
All invasive medical procedures were categorized as minor surgical procedures. Gastroenterological 
endoscopies, and endodontic procedures were also included as they have the potential to result in 
bleeding. 
In Study BH30071, 18 patients underwent a total of 80 procedures, with 1 patient having 44 procedures. 16 
[minor] procedures / surgeries were performed in 11 patients without peri-operative FVIII use and did not 
result in a bleed.  
•  1 patient had one or more procedures / surgeries that resulted in a bleed and were associated with 
peri-operative FVIII use.  
•  1 patient who underwent an orthopedic surgery received prophylactic FVIII treatment and did not 
experience a bleed due to the surgery. 
In Study BO39182, 6 patients underwent a total of 10 procedures. 4 patients underwent six [minor] 
procedures / surgeries without prophylactic or peri-operative hemophilia medication.  
•  One patient underwent 3 procedures of hematoma evacuation and received prophylactic FVIII for all 
3 procedures.  
•  Another patient underwent a cystoscopy and received prophylactic FVIII prior to the procedure. Both 
patients who received prophylactic FVIII did not experience post-procedural bleeds. 
In Study BH29992, 12 patients underwent a total of 12 procedures. Ten [minor] procedures / surgeries were 
performed in 10 patients without peri-operative bypassing agent use and did not result in a bleed.  
•  One patient who had a CVAD removal received a prophylactic dose of rFVIIa  
• 
one patient had an appendectomy for which he received a single prophylactic dose of aPCC.  
Neither of these procedures led to a bleed. 
In Study BH29884, 27 patients underwent a total of 45 procedures. [minor] Procedures / surgeries were 
performed in 15 patients without peri-operative bypassing agent use and did not result in a bleed. Twelve 
patients had one or more procedures/surgeries that were associated with peri-operative bypassing agent 
use. These included a total hip replacement, central line catheter placement, port removal, tooth extractions 
and right knee arthroscopy/synovectomy and debridement of arthrofibrosis and chondroplasty. Of these 12 
patients, 3 patients reported bleeding due to their procedures; specifically, the procedures were total hip 
replacement, tooth extraction of molar, and right knee arthroscopy/synovectomy and debridement of 
arthrofibrosis and chondroplasty.

Adverse events 
Overview of Adverse Events 
The overall AE profile for emicizumab in all exposed patients is shown in the following table: 
Table 72: Summary of adverse event profile 
314 patients (84.2%) had at least one AE, and 43 patients (11.5%) reported SAEs. 
[One patient in Study BH29884 had an AE with fatal outcome (SAE of rectal haemorrhage), which was 
previously reported.] 
There were not any further cases of thrombotic microangiopathy and thromboembolic events related to the 
drug-drug interaction between aPCC and emicizumab (known events). 
There was a higher rate of injection site reactions in BH30071 compared with the other studies. Injection site 
reactions were observed at any dose across the treatment and did not appear to be limited to the first few 
doses. 
The overall safety profile of emicizumab is consistent with that reported previously. 
Adverse events 
In total, 314 patients (84.2%) had at least one AE. The SOCs with the highest incidence of reported AEs were 
as follows: 
• 
Infections and Infestations (48%) -- the most common preferred terms were nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infections, and influenza 
•  General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (35.7%) -- the most common preferred terms 
were injection site reaction and pyrexia 
•  Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (29%) -- most common preferred term was 
arthralgia 
• 
Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications (23.9%) -- the most common preferred term was 
contusion 
•  Gastrointestinal Disorders (21.2%) -- the most common preferred term was diarrhoea.

The most common SOCs / preferred terms were similar between studies. Adverse events reported in ≥ 5% 
of patients overall are summarised below:

Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications were more frequently reported in Study BH29992 (41.3%) 
compared with other studies, with AEs of contusion (14.3%), skin abrasion (11.1%), fall (7.9%), ligament 
sprain (6.3%), laceration (4.8%) being also more frequently reported. Overall, the relatively higher 
frequency of injuries in this paediatric study is expected, because children are more prone to injury than 
adults, as they tend to be more physically active.  
In contrast, long-term joint destruction is known to be more frequent in adults with haemophilia A than in 
children and consistent with this, there a was low frequency of arthralgia in children (4.8%), as expected in 
this age group. 
Study BH30071: the proportion of patients treated with emicizumab who experienced any AE was 84.7% 
and the incidence of the SOC infections and infestations was 40.7%. 
Study BO39182: In the PK run-in part, all 7 patients exposed to emicizumab experienced an AE. The most 
common by SOC was musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (71.4%). In the expansion part, the 
most common AEs by SOC were general disorders and administration site conditions (31.7%), 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (31.7%) and nervous system disorders (19.5%). 
Nasopharyngitis (26.8%) was the most commonly reported AE, followed by injection site reaction (22.0%). 
Seven patients (17.1%) reported an AE immediately after injection; most commonly ISR. Injection site pain 
and presyncope were reported in 1 patient each (2.4%). With the exception of injection site pain, these AEs 
were all assessed as related to emicizumab treatment. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
One patient in Study BH29884 died due to an SAE of rectal haemorrhage; the patient also experienced 
thrombotic microangiopathy (case previously reported). There were 2 deaths reported in a compassionate 
use program (MO29988), narratives are submitted. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Study BH30071:  
Emicizumab Prophylaxis versus No Prophylaxis 
Five SAEs were reported in 5 patients across treatment arms, each experienced 1 SAE: 1 of 18 patients in 
Arm C control, 1 of 36 patients in Arm A, and 3 of 35 patients in Arm B. 
Three SAEs of haemorrhages were reported: haematoma (Grade 3, recovered/resolved) in Arm C control, 
and epistaxis (Grade 2, recovered/resolved) and putamen haemorrhage (Grade 4, recovering/resolving; 
treatment with emicizumab was not interrupted and the patient continued on emicizumab without 
recurrence of the event) in Arm B.  
Device loosening (Grade 3, recovered/resolved) and femur fracture (Grade 3, recovered/resolved) were 
reported in Arms A and B, respectively.  
None of the SAEs were reported as being related to emicizumab treatment.  
None of the patients were withdrawn from treatment as a consequence of the reported SAEs. 
Among all patients treated with emicizumab, a total of 12 patients reported 14 SAEs. In addition to the 4 
SAEs reported for 4 patients randomized to Arms A and B and described above, 8 patients in Arm D reported 
10 SAEs (groin pain, rhabdomyolysis, synovitis, infection, subperiosteal abscess, wound infection, epistaxis, 
acute coronary syndrome, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and suicidal ideation), which included 2 serious

haemorrhages. In addition, 1 SAE of nephrolithiasis was reported for 1 patient in Arm D 34 days after 
up-titration.  
None of the SAEs were reported as being related to emicizumab treatment.  
None of the patients were withdrawn from treatment as a consequence of the reported SAEs. 
Study BO39182 
Two SAEs were reported.  
•  One patient in the PK run-in cohort had an SAE of hypertension. This patient had a previous medical 
history of hypertension. The SAE was reported as unrelated to emicizumab treatment and it 
resolved. The emicizumab dose was not modified or interrupted due to the SAE. 
•  One patient in the expansion cohort had an SAE of rhabdomyolysis. The SAE was not considered to 
be related to emicizumab and the outcome was reported as recovered/resolved. The emicizumab 
dose was not interrupted, nor was the patient withdrawn from treatment, due to this SAE. 
Study BH29992 
Twelve SAEs were reported by 10 patients (15.9%), none of which were assessed as related to emicizumab 
treatment. All but 1 SAE (asthma, not related) resolved. The emicizumab dose was not modified or 
interrupted due to these SAEs. 
Study BH29884 
Overall, 19 patients (17.0%) reported a total of 29 SAEs. Five patients experienced SAEs of hemarthrosis, 3 
patients experienced thrombotic microangiopathy, and 2 patients experienced device related infections. All 
other SAEs were reported once in single patients. Overall, 6 SAEs considered related to emicizumab 
treatment were reported in 5 patients (4.5%) as described previously. Of these, 3 SAEs of thrombotic 
microangiopathy considered related to emicizumab treatment were reported in 3 patients (2.7%). All other 
treatment-related SAEs (cavernous sinus thrombosis, skin necrosis, and thrombophlebitis superficial) were 
each reported in only 1 patient. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
Injection site reaction was the most common AE, experienced by 77 of 373 patients (20.6%):

Table 74: Summary of local injection site reactions 
All injection site reactions were non-serious, and Grade 1 or 2 in intensity. Most Injection site reactions 
(94.9%) were well tolerated and as they did not require treatment. Injection-site reactions were observed at 
any dose across the treatment and did not appear to be limited to the first few doses. There were no 
discontinuations or dose modifications/interruptions due to injection site reactions. All injection site 
reactions resolved without sequelae. 
No cases with events consistent with systemic hypersensitivity, anaphylactic, or anaphylactoid reactions 
were reported. 
There were not any new reports of thromboembolic events or thrombotic microangiopathy. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The aggregate analyses performed previously with BH29884 data were repeated for all studies and included 
new treatment analyses for FVIII, as well as updated analyses for aPCC and FVIIa. 
Aggregate Treatment Event Analyses for Activated Prothrombin Complex Concentrate 
The majority of patients exposed to aPCC were in BH29884 (29 of 31 patients [93.5%]), only 2 patients were 
exposed in BH29992, and no patients were exposed to aPCC in BH30071 and BO39182, as they were mainly 
non-inhibitor patients. 
As a first step, the Sponsor conducted an aggregate analysis of treatment events of the use of aPCC. The 
analysis looked at all doses received by patients, irrespective of the purpose, and counted all doses of aPCC 
as one “treatment event” until there was a 36-hour, infusion free break. For the purposes of this analysis, an 
“event” describes the use of aPCC, not bleeds or patients. Treatment events were linked to the 
thromboembolic event or thrombotic microangiopathy AEs if they overlapped fully or partially with the AE or 
where the end date of the treatment event occurred within 3 days prior to the AE start. 
The aim was to examine whether the cumulative dose of aPCC within a given time interval was linked to the 
occurrence of these AEs. The first 7 days of emicizumab exposure and data in safety follow-up period (30 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019 
Page 156/180 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
days after discontinuation of emicizumab prophylaxis) were excluded for the purposes of this analysis, due 
to low emicizumab concentration at these times. 
Based on this analysis, there were 22 patients who experienced a total of 82 treatment events of the use of 
aPCC, of which 80 were in BH29884 and 2 in BH29992. This shows that, while a minority of 
emicizumab-treated patients with FVIII inhibitors used concomitant aPCC, many of the patients did have 
more than one aPCC treatment event. 
The majority of aPCC treatment events lasting for < 24 hours (57.3%) had cumulative doses ranging 
between 50-100 U/kg and in total 84.1% lasting < 24 hours.  
Two patients experienced at least 1 thromboembolic event linked to an aPCC treatment event. Three 
patients experienced a total of 3 thrombotic microangiopathy events linked to a treatment event. 
A categorical analysis looked at the average exposure to aPCC over 24 hours and the total duration of the 
aPCC treatment events. Of the 82 aPCC treatment events, 8 consisted of an average 24-hour aPCC dose > 
100 U/kg and lasted for 24 hours or more. 
Five of these 8 events were associated with thromboembolic and thrombotic microangiopathy events.  
Table 75: Categorical analysis of average daily exposure and duration of treatment with 
activated prothrombin complex concentrate 
This analysis confirms that all thromboembolic and thrombotic microangiopathy events related to aPCC were 
associated with an average a cumulative amount of > 100 U/kg/24 hours of aPCC for 24 hours or more. 
An additional categorical analysis looked at the distribution of cumulative doses of treatment events and 
compared those consisting of a single dose of aPCC with those consisting of multiple doses. The conclusions 
of this updated analysis remain consistent with the previous submission. A total of 24 single dose events 
(29.3%) had more than one infusion, all of which had a cumulative dose > 100 U/kg. All of the treatment 
events associated with thromboembolic or thrombotic microangiopathy events consisted of multiple aPCC 
doses.

Table 76: Cumulate dose of activated prothrombin complex concentrate by number of infusion 
In order to inform dosing guidance over a defined time period, an additional analysis looked at the maximum 
cumulative 24-hour dose of aPCC per treatment event. The methodology used for this analysis was 
described previously. The conclusions of this updated analysis remain consistent with the previous 
submission. The 3 thrombotic microangiopathy events and the 2 thromboembolic events related to aPCC 
were associated with at least one instance of maximum cumulative aPCC dose being > 100 U/kg within a 
24-hour interval during the contemporaneous treatment event. 
Figure 41: Maximum cumulative dose of activated prothrombin complex concentrate per 24 
hour interval per treatment event 
Three of 4 treatment events with a maximum cumulative 24-hour dose of > 200 U/kg aPCC within a 24-hour 
interval were associated with thromboembolic or thrombotic microangiopathy events. 
Similar analyses were performed for treatment events with rFVIIa. The conclusions of this updated analysis 
remain consistent with the previous submission. There were 57 patients who experienced a total of 227 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019 
Page 158/180 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
treatment events of the use of rFVIIa, of which 205 were in BH29884, 20 in BH29992, and 2 in BO39182. 
Most rFVIIa treatment events (34.4%) had cumulative doses ranging between 90-180 µg/kg and 77.5% 
lasting < 24 hours. Of 227 treatment events of co-exposure to rFVIIa and emicizumab in 57 participants, 
185 included an average rFVIIa dose ≥ 90 mg/kg/day, of which 49 events lasted ≥ 24 hours. No treatment 
events with rFVIIa were associated with thromboembolic events. No treatment events where rFVIIa was 
administered alone were associated with thrombotic microangiopathy events. 
New analyses were performed for treatment events with FVIII (including high FVIII doses). There were 86 
patients who experienced a total of 278 treatment events of the use of FVIII, of which 215 were in BH30071, 
59 in BO39182, and 4 in BH29884.  
Table 77: Categorical analysis of average daily exposure and duration of treatment with Factor 
VIII 
The majority of FVIII treatment events (70.5%) had cumulative doses < 50 IU/kg and 83.1% lasting < 24 
hours. Of 278 treatment events of co-exposure to FVIII and emicizumab in 86 participants, 55 included an 
average FVIII dose ≥ 50 IU/kg/24 hours, of which 12 events lasted ≥ 24 hours. 
Summary of Aggregate Treatment Event Analyses 
The aggregate treatment event analyses showed that a high cumulative dose of aPCC administered 
concomitantly with emicizumab was associated with an increased risk of development of thromboembolic or 
thrombotic microangiopathy events. Specifically, all patients who developed thromboembolic or thrombotic 
microangiopathy events related to aPCC and emicizumab have received on average a cumulative amount of 
> 100 U/kg/24 hours of aPCC for a period of 24 hours or more.  
The Sponsor concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support a drug-drug interaction between aPCC 
and emicizumab. 
No patients who received concomitant FVIII or rFVIIa alone at any dose or duration developed 
thromboembolic or thrombotic microangiopathy. Similarly, patients who were co-exposed to a maximum 
cumulative dose of aPCC ≤ 100 U/kg within a 24-hour interval did not develop thromboembolic or 
thrombotic microangiopathy events.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Study BH30071, 1 patient in Arm B discontinued treatment after 51 days in the study due to multiple low 
grade AEs (7 AEs: depressed mood, headache, insomnia, lethargy, nightmare, pruritus and alopecia). None 
of the AEs were reported as serious, and all AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity. None of the AEs required 
treatment, and all were reported as resolved. 
[3 patients were previously reported for Study BH29884]. 
2 patients (1.3%) in study BH30071 had an adverse event leading to modification or interruption of study 
treatment (gastroenteritis led to one missing dose and synovitis led to an up-titration). 
[6 patients were previously reported for Study BH29884]. 
Laboratory finding 
Overall, there were no changes of clinical significance in haematology or chemistry laboratory parameters in 
the emicizumab clinical studies. 
The company has updated its analysis system to detect antibodies; the company acknowledges that the ADA 
incidence reports in the Phase III studies could have been underestimated. The sensitivity of the ADA assay 
has been optimized using disease-specific samples to calculate cutpoints in line with CHMP guidelines for 
immunogenicity testing. 
The overall incidence of ADA across four pivotal Phase III studies was 3.5% (14 of 398) and comparable 
across studies. Thirteen patients had treatment-induced ADAs and 1 patient had a treatment-boosted 
response:

Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019 
Page 160/180 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The PK profiles of the 14 ADA-positive patients were examined; of these, 3 (0.75%) had ADAs with 
neutralizing potential, which was further supported by reduced PD effect. Of these 3 patients, 1 discontinued 
from emicizumab treatment due to lack of efficacy (Study BH29992). This was reported as an SAE 
(neutralising antibodies positive). The second patient discontinued due to personal preference and the third 
patient has not experienced any bleeds (treated or untreated) up to the CCOD and is continuing emicizumab 
treatment on study. 
No cases of anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity were reported in ADA-positive patients. There was no trend 
towards increased frequency or severity of injection site reactions (ISRs) after patients tested positive for 
ADAs. 
There were no clinically significant changes in ECG parameters from baseline. 
Vital signs 
There were no clinically significant changes from baseline in vital signs parameters. 
Safety in special populations 
Overall, there were no appreciable differences in the AE profile of emicizumab between the various age 
groups (infants, children, adolescents, and adults): 
Table 79: Overview of adverse events by age group 
Overall, the majority of patients were White (246 of 373 [65.9%]); there were no appreciable differences in 
the AE profile of emicizumab as a function of race. There were no clinically meaningful differences in AE 
profile when stratified by baseline inhibitor status:

Post marketing experience 
Emicizumab was first approved on 16 November 2017 (US approval). It was subsequently approved in the 
EU and Australia. Post-marketing data regarding its use was presented in the first global PSUR submitted in 
July 2018. The next PSUR will be submitted in January 2019. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
No new  aspects of clinical safety have been shown within the clinical studies now submitted. New events of 
thromboembolic microangiopathy are not reported. 
Overall, emicizumab exposure its associated risks are comparable across different dosing regimens and the 
safety profile is expected to be similar in children (and adults) receiving emicizumab weekly, every two or 
every four weeks. This conclusion is further confirmed by the similar safety profile observed across the 3 
regimens. Also of note, the Cmax of all three regimens is lower than that observed with emicizumab 3 mg/kg 
QW in Study ACE002JP, where the study drug has been well-tolerated over an approximately 4 year period. 
The MAH has updated its analysis system to detect anti-drug antibodies and has found that there were 
patients who developed antibodies. One such patient withdrew from study because of loss of efficacy related 
to development of neutralising antibodies.  
The available emicizumab safety data indicate that, in itself, the presence of inhibitors is not associated with 
AEs or specific safety concerns in patients receiving emicizumab. 
The types of AEs observed in Study BH29884 and Study BH30071 were similar (with the exception of 
thromboembolic events or thrombotic microangiopathy; see below), and there were no new or unexpected 
AEs in patients without inhibitors. 
The main observed safety event with emicizumab is the occurrence of thrombotic microangiopathy or 
thromboembolic events, which were reported when an average cumulative amount of > 100 U/kg/24 hours 
of aPCC was administered for 24 hours or more, to patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis. Notably, 
these events are not related to the presence of inhibitors, and a similar co-exposure of a patient without 
inhibitors would be expected to have an identical risk for these events. However, this is a hypothetical 
scenario as bypassing agents are not used for the treatment of patients without inhibitors.  
The lack of effect of inhibitor status on the emicizumab safety profile is expected, since neither the 
underlying disease nor the mechanism of action of emicizumab is affected by FVIII inhibitors. However, as 
patients with inhibitors require treatment with bypassing agents, whereas patients without inhibitors are 
treated with FVIII, an important difference between these two groups of patients is the potential interaction 
between emicizumab and the concomitant medications each group typically receives. 
In contrast, none of the co-exposure events of emicizumab and FVIII in Study BH30071 or Study BO39182 
were associated with significant AEs, thereby, establishing a favorable safety profile of this co-exposure. 
Although this co-exposure was not tested specifically in children, the biologic function and dosage of infused 
FVIII is identical in children and in adults. In fact, the only potential difference is a shorter half-life of 
exogenous FVIII in children (Mancuso et al. 2017), resulting in a lower exposure for a given dose. 
Results from Study BH29884 and Study BH29992 demonstrate that emicizumab trough plasma 
concentrations are consistent across different ages. In healthy individuals, FVIII levels remain constant from 
birth through adulthood (Andrew et al. 1988; 1992), so in this respect the emicizumab levels are consistent 
with the physiologic lack of change of FVIII activity levels with age. The early physiologic maturation of FVIII 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019 
Page 164/180 
 
  
  
 
 
 
levels (Kuhle et al. 2003) suggests that a given FVIII activity is expected to provide a similar safety and 
efficacy in adults and in children. 
Therefore the favourable safety data obtained in Study BH29992 are applicable to and representative of all 
paediatric patients with haemophilia A, regardless of the presence or absence of FVIII inhibitors, and that 
the safety profile of the combination of FVIII and emicizumab has been established in Study BH30071. 
In summary, the above considerations regarding the biology of haemophilia A and the mechanism of action 
of emicizumab, together with the consistent PK data in Study BH29884 and Study BH30071, indicate that 
the presence of FVIII inhibitors does not impact the safety or efficacy of emicizumab. The efficacy and safety 
data obtained from Study BH29992 are equally applicable and generalisable to children with or without FVIII 
inhibitors. 
The clinical value of this generalisation is further highlighted by the superior efficacy of emicizumab 
compared to FVIII prophylaxis observed in Study BH30071and by the substantial medical unmet needs of 
paediatric patients without inhibitors. These unmet needs include central venous access device 
(CVAD)-associated morbidity, delayed initiation of prophylaxis resulting in increased risk of intracranial 
haemorrhage, and an onerous treatment burden - all of which are addressed by emicizumab due to its long 
half-life and SC bioavailability. 
Updates have been made to the SmPC to reflect new information on clinical safety which is considered 
acceptable. 
The MAH has not submitted clinical data on safety in subjects with mild or moderate haemophilia and without 
inhibitors; this has been considered as a notable deficiency because of concern over thrombosis in subjects 
with appreciable endogenous FVIII activity when exposed to the current product. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Data available from the paediatric population has not identified aspects of safety that are specific to the 
paediatric population. Nonetheless, it is advised to collect more detailed information on safety in the 
paediatric population via the proposed PASS (please see RMP section). 
Additional expert consultation

Clinical Efficacy 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Aspects of clinical safety are considered to be clinically manageable in line with the recommendations given 
in the SmPC. 
The company has not submitted clinical data on safety in subjects with mild or moderate haemophilia and 
without inhibitors; considering this lack of data and because of the risk of thrombosis and TMA, no 
recommendation can be made to grant the indication in mild and moderate haemophilia A patients without 
inhibitors. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
Additional safety data will be collected for the paediatric population via the proposed PASS.

2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Hemlibra (emicizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hemlibra is proposed for the treatment for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with: 
• 
• 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with factor VIII inhibitors. 
severe haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency, FVIII<1 %) without FVIII inhibitors  
Hemlibra can be used in all age groups. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard treatment of patients with haemophilia A is intravenous FVIII replacement therapy with 
recombinant or plasma-derived FVIII concentrates given either episodically (“on demand”) in response to 
the occurrence of bleeding symptoms or prophylactically on a scheduled basis to prevent bleeding. 
Prophylactic therapy is considered superior to episodic treatment of symptomatic bleeds. Data from clinical 
trials indicate that patients without FVIII inhibitors who adhere to the prescribed prophylactic FVIII regimens 
have satisfactory bleed control, with median annualised bleeding rates in the range of 0.9 − 4.1. Even so, 
MRI scans demonstrate progressive arthropathy [thought caused by subclinical bleeds] in up to two-thirds of 
patients who receive a primary prophylaxis regimen as standard of care. A recent survey demonstrated that 
prophylaxis was routinely available to adults in only 18 of 35 European countries surveyed and 50% or fewer 
adults received FVIII prophylaxis in 12 out of those 18 countries. Most are managed with episodic treatment. 
Even extended-life FVIII products need to be administered up to 3 times per week. 
Up to 30% of patients with haemophilia A develop neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against FVIII after 
exposure to therapeutic FVIII concentrates. The current standard of care for treatment of bleeds in 
haemophilia A patients with inhibitors is treatment with bypassing agents. The two products available for 
this are: recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven) and activated prothrombin complex concentrate 
(aPCC, or factor eight inhibitors bypassing agent [FEIBA]). NovoSeven is indicated for episodic use only, 
while FEIBA is approved for episodic and prophylactic use in patients with high-responding inhibitors and 
frequent joint bleeding. These products are short-acting and may need to be administered often, with long 
IV infusion times and/or require frequent administration for prophylaxis.  
Whilst prophylactic regimens are used for subjects with severe haemophilia, those with mild or moderate 
haemophilia are managed with ‘on-demand’ therapy. Patients with moderate or mild haemophilia A may be 
also managed on-demand with s/c DDAVP rather than exogenous FVIII. 
For all subjects, regular venous access is needed to administer currently licensed other products.

There remains a clinical need to reduce bleeding and so reduce consequent morbidities by using products 
that may be easily administered. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Two new clinical studies were submitted in patients with and without inhibitors: 
Study BH30071 (HAVEN-3), a randomised, multi-centre, open-label study. The study enrolled 152 patients 
with severe congenital haemophilia A (intrinsic FVIII level < 1%) aged 12 years or older and with a body 
weight ≥ 40 kg. Subject had a negative test for factor VIII inhibitors (and with evidence of lack of the 
presence of an inhibitor for the last 5 years). The study had 4 arms. Patients who received episodic 
treatment with FVIII prior to study entry and experienced at least 5 bleeds over the 24 weeks prior to study 
entry (equivalent to annualized bleeding rate [ABR] ≥ 10) were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio. HAVEN-3 did 
not enrol subjects with inhibitors / 35 subjects were exposed to a maintenance dose of 3mg/kg q2w / 8 
subjects were <18yrs age. 
Study BO39182 (HAVEN-4) a multi-centre, open-label study. The study enrolled 48 patients with severe 
congenital haemophilia A (intrinsic FVIII level < 1%) aged 12 years or older and with a body weight ≥ 40 kg. 
Subjects were either with or without the presence of inhibitors to FVIII. 7/48 subjects took part in a run-in 
PK study. The main efficacy analysis was of the 41/48 subjects who did not take part in the PK run-in study. 
Subjects in the main cohort were administered emicizumab prophylaxis at 3 mg/kg QW SC for 4 weeks 
followed by 6 mg/kg Q4W SC. The median duration of the efficacy period for the 41 patients included in the 
efficacy analysis was 25.57 weeks (range: 24.1-29.4 weeks). 
The MAH also submitted updates / final versions of the following studies that were submitted previously [as 
interim reports] to support the indication for subjects with inhibitors.  
BH29884 (HAVEN 1) is a randomised, multi-centre, open-label study. The MAH now submits an update of 
experience beyond 24 weeks of exposure to study product and with an additional 4 patients recruited. The 
majority (82.3%) of patients had ≥ 48 weeks follow-up at cut-off. 
BH29992 (HAVEN 2) is a single-arm, multi-centre, open-label study. The study enrolled 63 paediatric 
patients (60 patients < 12 years of age, including 10 patients ≤ 2 years, and 3 patients ≥ 12 years of age 
and < 40 kg) with congenital haemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors, who were receiving bypassing agents as a 
previous treatment. All subjects were male with a mean age of 6.6yrs (range 1 – 15yrs). The study 
population was multi-ethnic. There was a median of 6 bleeds in the last 24 weeks prior to study entry (range: 
0-155 bleeds). Upon study entry, subjects were administered a weekly loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg SC of 
emicizumab for the first 4 weeks followed by a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/week SC. 
Non-interventional Study BH29768 / final analysis submitted based on date 31 Mar 2017.  
Supportive Phase I/II Study ACE002JP. Eligible patients from Study ACE001JP part C (Japanese patients ≥ 
12 and < 60 years of age with or without FVIII inhibitors) 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Bleed rates and analyses were as previously described for studies HAVEN-1 and HAVEN-2 (studies submitted 
previously to support initial application for a licence). A negative binomial model was used to analyse bleeds.

Emicizumab prophylaxis with the maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg QW resulted in a 96% reduction in 
rate of treated bleeds compared with no prophylaxis (annualised bleed rate cohort A / cohort C ratio

Emicizumab prophylaxis with the maintenance dose of 3 mg/kg Q2W led to a 97% reduction in rate 
of treated bleeds, compared with no prophylaxis (annualised bleed rate cohort B / cohort C ratio =

•  56.1%patients did not experience any treated bleeds while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis.

treatment arms in the all emicizumab-treated patients was 2.7 (1.64, 4.35), mean (95% CI) 
In all above studies, the results of all bleeds, treated spontaneous bleeds, treated joint bleeds and treated 
target joint bleeds supported / were consistent with the data for treated bleeds. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are limited data on subjects with haemophilia without inhibitors in the paediatric age range. The 
company has conducted an extrapolation exercise for the paediatric population based on information from 
adults and paediatric patients with inhibitors. It is argued that the biology of haemophilia A and the 
mechanism of action of emicizumab, together with the consistent PK in patients with or without inhibitors, 
indicate that the presence of FVIII inhibitors does not impact the safety or efficacy of emicizumab, and that 
the mode of action of emicizumab is independent from the presence of inhibitors. Patients with congenital 
haemophilia A, therefore [and when considering treatment with emicizumab], constitute a single population 
regardless of inhibitor status. Thus, the efficacy data observed in study HAVEN 2 may be considered 
applicable to children without inhibitors. Therefore, in order to address the concern over the lack of data on 
clinical safety in the paediatric age groups, the company commits to report on clinical safety for the subsets 
of paediatric age groups in the PSUR (and to update the RMP accordingly). Finally, a PASS will be conducted 
to focus on gaining more clinical data in paediatric patients without inhibitors treated with emicizumab on a 
weekly basis. 
There is lack of experience of long-term exposure beyond the time limits of the clinical studies submitted; 
the post-authorisation safety studies as described in the RMP will provide long term safety data. 
There is limited experience of use around the time of surgery. Planned surgery was an exclusion criterion for 
studies. Most surgeries that are reported were ‘minor’. Bleeds owing to a surgery or procedure were 
excluded from analyses. The fact that the safety and efficacy of emicizumab have not been formally 
evaluated in the surgical setting has been reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. It is appreciated that case 
reports on clinical management of patients around the time of surgery would not appear to give reason to 
raise concern at this stage. 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019 
Page 174/180 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The MAH has not collected data on exposure of the current product to subjects with ‘moderate’ or ‘mild’ 
forms of haemophilia without inhibitors. Lack of information on use of the current product on subjects with 
‘moderate’ or ‘mild’ forms of haemophilia without inhibitors is considered to be a notable deficiency of this 
application and therefore this indication cannot be granted. The MAH withdrew its claim to this proposed 
indication. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
5 patients developed ADAs, one of whom withdrew from the study because of acquired loss of efficacy 
resulting from the neutralising effect of the antibodies. 
Injection site reactions were experienced by (about) 20% of all patients. This was already reflected in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC where the frequency of injection site reaction is very common. 
Thromboembolic and thrombotic microangiopathy events reported in subject with FVIII inhibitors were 
ascribed to drug-drug interaction with activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC). There were not 
any new reports of thrombotic microangiopathy or thromboembolic disease; the MAH has extended its 
analysis and finds that all patients who developed thromboembolic or thrombotic microangiopathy events 
related to aPCC and emicizumab have received on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U/kg/24 hours of 
aPCC for a period of 24 hours or more and concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support a drug-drug 
interaction between aPCC and emicizumab. Although it is unlikely that emicizumab and aPCC would be used 
together in patients without inhibitors, the known interaction raises concern over possible association with 
other coagulation factors and that use of other coagulation factors will have to be done with caution. The 
current warning as described in section 4.4 of the SmPC applies for the use of emicizumab and aPCC in 
patients without inhibitors. 
Laboratory tests in relation to haemostasis are not / may not be informative in the presence of emicizumab. 
Emicizumab affects assays for aPTT and all assays based on aPTT, such as one-stage FVIII activity. 
Life-threatening bleeding due to unreliable standard coagulation tests and inhibitor assays in the setting of 
emicizumab has been classified as an important potential risk. As a routine risk minimization measure, 
appropriate warnings are included in section 4.4 of the SmPC which states that aPTT-based coagulation 
laboratory test results in patients who have been treated with emicizumab prophylaxis should not be used to 
monitor emicizumab activity, to determine dosing for factor replacement or anti-coagulation, or measure 
FVIII inhibitor titers. Additional risk minimisation measures include educational materials aimed at patients, 
healthcare professionals and laboratory professionals. 
Some subjects did not experience breakthrough bleeds whilst exposed to emicizumab; some subjects 
continue to experience bleeds in spite of full compliance with treatment. The MAH has not been able to 
identify any pre-existing factors that may predict those who would continue to experience breakthrough 
bleeds. The MAH has added information on the management of breakthrough bleeds and management of 
patients at the time of surgery in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Further analysis of the MAH on the cause of thrombotic microangiopathy is reassuring yet there remains high 
concern that the pathophysiology of this adverse event has not been fully elucidated. Further, patients with 
haemophilia A without inhibitors treated in prophylaxis could have undercurrent bleeding treated with FVIII. 
In vitro pharmacodynamics interactions of emicizumab in combination with FVIIII have been tested. At FVIII 
concentrations of 1UI/ml, emicizumab marginally shortened lag time and tt Peak, and had almost no effect 
on peak height, indicating that emicizumab competes with FVIII on FIX, FX binding. It appears that 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019 
Page 175/180 
 
  
  
 
 
 
emicizumab with FVIII may result in non-additive coagulation potential. The MAH has not investigated 
drug-drug interaction with medicinal products used in the management of moderate (or mild) haemophilia 
such as DDAVP. The posology recommendation as well as the warning statement as stated in section 4.2 and 
4.4 of the SmPC and already part of the initial MA are still considerate adequate to minimise these risks. 
Whilst it is acknowledged that subjects were exposed to exogenous FVIII activity at the time of breakthrough 
bleeds, this was for short term only; clinical safety in the context of long term use of the current product in 
subjects with background FVIII activity is not established. There are not any data on the long-term safety 
aspects of haemophilia, such as arthropathy. The post-authorisation safety studies will provide more 
information on the long term use of emicizumab.  
There are no data on subjects with ‘mild’ or ‘moderate’ congenital Haemophilia A without inhibitors who have 
appreciable FVIII activity; considering that it is not been established whether or not these subjects will be 
more at risk at events such as thrombosis or thromboembolic disease, the indication in mild and moderate 
haemophilia A patients without inhibitors cannot be granted. The MAH withdrew its claim to this proposed 
indication.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Reduction in the number of bleeds, as reported with exposure to emicizumab, is an important clinical 
outcome. The MAH itself notes that data from published clinical trials indicate that patients without FVIII 
inhibitors who adhere to the prescribed prophylactic FVIII regimens have satisfactory bleed control, with 
median annualised bleeding rates in the range of 0.9 − 4.1. Even so, MRI scans demonstrate progressive 
arthropathy [thought caused by subclinical bleeds] in up to two-thirds of patients who receive a primary 
prophylaxis regimen as standard of care. 
Exposure to emicizumab appears to match the annualised bleeding rates already reported for prophylactic 
FVIII in the context of a clinical trial. There remains the issue of wider use outside the context of a clinical 
study and how compliance is affected by that. 
Emicizumab has notable aspects of clinical risk, in particular haemorrhage, thromboses and thrombotic 
microangiopathy. Some reassurance over the cause of thrombotic microangiopathy events and how they 
may be prevented was provided by the MAH. However, there are no data on subjects with ‘mild’ or 
‘moderate’ congenital Haemophilia A without inhibitors who have appreciable FVIII activity. Considering that 
it is not been established whether or not these subjects will be more at risk at events such as thrombosis or 
thromboembolic disease, the indication in mild and moderate haemophilia A patients without inhibitors 
cannot be granted.  
Clinical management of breakthrough bleeds and management of patients in the peri-operative period 
(especially major surgeries) whilst exposed to emicizumab remain areas of limited experience; this has been 
adequately reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Association with a PCC should be avoided. Association with FVIII factors in case of undercurrent bleedings in 
haemophilia A patient without inhibitors does not seems to be synergic but competitive. It is advised that 
Assessment report  
EMA/125963/2019 
Page 178/180 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interaction with other medicinal products and especially those with a pro-thrombotic profile be more fully 
investigated; this will be addressed in the post-authorisation safety study (please see RMP). 
Emicizumab interacts with laboratory assay for aPTT and all assays based on aPTT. Since the extension of 
indication will concern a lot of patients, it will be very challenging to ensure a broad communication to 
healthcare professionals involved in assays and haemophilia A monitoring. (Paediatricians, haematologists, 
general practitioners, pharmacists etc...). A dedicated PASS will be conducted in order to assess the HCP and 
patient/carer survey. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
It is considered that data to support benefit outweighs risk in subjects with severe congenital haemophilia A 
without inhibitors at maintenance posologies of 1.5mg/kg/qw sc. 3.0mg/kg/q2w sc and 6.0mg/kg/q4w sc/ 
It is considered that the lack of data in mild and moderate forms of congenital haemophilia A prevent a 
positive recommendation for these indications. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Hemlibra is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning 
the following change:

Extension of Indication to include routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients with severe 
haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency, FVIII<1 %) without FVIII inhibitors. In addition, two 
additional posology recommendations for adults and children with haemophilia A with and without factor VIII 
inhibitors are recommended. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated 
with efficacy and safety information of the pivotal trials. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to introduce minor corrections and clarity to sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 of the 
SmPC. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1).

haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency, FVIII<1 %) without FVIII inhibitors. In addition, two 
additional posology recommendations for adults and children with haemophilia A with and without factor VIII 
inhibitors are recommended. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated 
with efficacy and safety information of the pivotal trials. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder

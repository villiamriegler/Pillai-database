Based on the cumulative review of cases of Dysuria and 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order 
to add ‘urinary retention’ and ‘dysuria’ to the list of 
adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency rare 
and to amend a warning regarding urinary retention 
; the Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce 
minor editorial changes to the PI and bring it in line 
with the latest QRD template.

B.I.a.1.f - Change in the manufacturer of AS or of a 
starting material/reagent/intermediate for AS - 
Urinary retention reported in the post-marketing setting, 
and observed in clinical trial data, a causal association 
between Elebrato Ellipta and Trelegy Ellipta and the 
adverse effects "Dysuria" and "Urinary retention" is 
considered a possibility. Therefore, these events are added 
as new undesirable effects under section 4.8 of the SmPC 
with the frequency "rare". 
As cases of acute urinary retention have been observed in a 
post-marketing setting, a warning regarding the 
prescription of this product to patients with urinary 
retention or risk factors of urinary retention was also 
added.

Product Characteristics.

Information (CCSI) of the Global Datasheet (GDS), 
dysgeusia was added as an adverse drug reaction (ADR) at 
a frequency of uncommon. Dysgeusia was not previously 
identified as an ADR for combination inhaled fluticasone 
furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol trifenatate 
(FF/UMEC/VI) in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD) clinical trial safety database but mainly supported 
by reference to the safety profile FF/UMEC/VI from asthma 
studies, literature case reports and review of cases of 
dysgeusia observed for the mono (UMEC) and dual 
constituents (UMEC/VI) of FF/UMEC/VI, both authorised for 
use in COPD. Frequency of dysgeusia was calculated based 
on the incidence in the triple therapy COPD clinical trials 
(CTT116855, CTT116853, 200812). 
Furthermore, based on assessment of study CTT116855 
and postmarketing safety data for FF/UMEC/VI, intraocular 
pressure increased with frequency rare and vision blurred, 
glaucoma and eye pain with frequency uncommon were 
identified as new ADRS.

indication to include the possibility to use Trelegy 
Ellipta and Elebrato Ellipta as maintenance treatment 
in patients not adequately treated by dual 
LABA/LAMA therapy. Additionally cross reference to 
the effects on symptoms is added. This is based on 
the results of study CTT116855 and study 200812 
and the population PK report 208059. 
As a consequence, the indication section (4.1), 
Undesirable effects section (4.8), Pharmacodynamic 
Properties section (5.1), Pharmacokinetic properties 
section (5.2) and Preclinical Safety data section (5.3) 
of the SmPC have been updated. The package leaflet 
has been updated accordingly.  
A minor amendment in annex II is also introduced to 
bring it in line with the QRD template.  Additionally, 
minor changes have been introduced to the RMP to 
bring it in line with the new template (revision 2).

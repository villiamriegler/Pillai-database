Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Zepatier 
elbasvir /grazoprevir  
On 26 May 2016 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion, 
recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Zepatier, intended for 
the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The applicant for this medicinal product is Merck Sharp & Dohme 
Limited. 
Zepatier is a fixed dose combination of two direct acting antivirals, elbasvir and grazoprevir (ATC code: 
J05AX68). It will be available as film-coated tablets (containing 50 mg elbasvir and 100 mg grazoprevir). 
Elbasvir is an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A protein, while grazoprevir is an inhibitor of the 
HCV NS3/4A protease. Both proteins are essential for viral replication. 
The benefit with Zepatier when used with or without ribavirin is its very high efficacy against HCV 
genotypes 1 and 4 including in patients with compensated cirrhosis and severe kidney disease. The most 
common side effects are fatigue and headache.  
The full indication is: "Zepatier is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in adults (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). For hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype-specific activity see sections 4.4 and 
5.1." 
It is proposed that Zepatier be prescribed by physicians experienced in the management of patients with 
chronic hepatitis C.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

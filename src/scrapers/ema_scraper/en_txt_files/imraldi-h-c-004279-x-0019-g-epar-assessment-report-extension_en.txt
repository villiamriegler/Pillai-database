discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting a 
marketing authorisation to Imraldi on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Imraldi is a biosimilar adalimumab with the EU Humira as the reference medicinal product. Imraldi was approved 
by  the  European  Commission  in  August  2017.  Adalimumab  is  a  genetically  engineered  recombinant  human 
immunoglobulin IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Imraldi is currently available only as single dose 40 mg prefilled 
syringe (PFS) or pen. However, in accordance with the reference medicinal product Humira Imraldi was also 
authorised  in  paediatric  indications  for  which  doses  lower  than  40mg  should  be  given.  Therefore,  the 
introduction of the vial presentation that allows dosing lower than 40 mg dose is justified from a clinical point of 
view.  
There are no changes to the pharmaceutical form, route of administration, and proposed indications compared 
to the currently licensed strengths. Therefore no additional nonclinical or clinical studies have been performed. 
The Product Information (PI) is revised for pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen to be in the line with the line 
extension application so that dosing instructions to the paediatric patients are included. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The line extension for 40 mg solution for injection vial presentation of Imraldi applies to the following 
indications: 
• 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis polyarticular (JIA):

• 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Paediatric Crohn’s disease 
      Adolescent Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 
      Paediatric uveitis. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
No new data were submitted in this application. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Adalimumab neutralises the biological function of both soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-α by blocking 
its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors and modulates biological responses that are 
induced or regulated by TNF, including changes in the levels of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte 
migration. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
TNF-α has been shown to be elevated in several disease states, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis 
(PsO),  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA),  ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS),  axial  spondyloarthritis  without  radiographic 
evidence of AS, Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). In addition, 
elevated serum TNF-α levels seem to be positively correlated with recurrent episodes of uveitis of idiopathic 
origin. Biological therapies have well-documented efficacy, rapid onset of action, and good acute tolerability. 
2.1.5.  Management 
About the product 
Imraldi, a biosimilar to Humira, is currently indicated in rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, axial 
spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, paediatric plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), 
Crohn’s disease, paediatric Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and uveitis. The extension of indication in 
paediatric uveitis has been recently approved in February 2019 for Imraldi (EMEA/H/C/004279/IB/0020). 
The active substance of Imraldi is adalimumab, a chimeric human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal 
antibody. It binds specifically to TNF and neutralises the biological function of TNF by blocking its interaction with 
the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  Imraldi is authorised for two single dose 40 mg solution for injection 
presentations, as a pre-filled syringe since initial marketing authorisation granted in August 2017 and as a 
pre-filled pen since September 2018 (EMEA/H/C/004279/II/0002/G).  
The current application is an extension application to the marketing authorisation for Imraldi 
(EMEA/H/C/004279) to add a new strength of 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection (in vial). The product will be 
administered via s.c. injection.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
Imraldi is a biosimilar product to the EU-approved Humira reference medicinal product. The marketing 
authorisation for Imraldi was granted in September 2017 under Article 10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC as 
amended by Directive 2004/27/EC and Article 3(3) of Regulation 726/2004/EC, with reference to Humira 40 mg 
solution for injection (EU/1/03/256/001) and Humira 40 solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
(EU/1/03/256/003,005). Imraldi is currently marketed as 40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and 
40 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen. 
The purpose of the present application is to seek approval for Imraldi 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection in vial 
to allow dosing in paediatric patients. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Imraldi,  also  referred  to  as  SB5,  is  a  recombinant  fully  human  monoclonal  antibody,  adalimumab,  directed 
against  tumour  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNF-α).  It  is  produced  by  recombinant  DNA  technology  in  a  Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian expression system. From cell banking up to the manufacturing process of SB5 
active  substance  and  finished  product,  materials  of  animal  origin  were  used  only  during  early  cell  line 
development. 
SB5 finished product is a clear to opalescent, colourless to pale brown, sterile and preservative-free solution for 
injection. SB5 is currently presented as a single-use pre-filled syringe (PFS) or single-use pre-filled pen (PFP) 
containing 40 mg adalimumab in 0.8 mL to be administered via subcutaneous injection.  
The scope of this line extension application is to add a new strength of 40 mg/0.8 mL solution for injection in vial, 
to allow the administration to paediatric patients that require less than a full 40 mg dose. The excipients remain 
unchanged: sodium citrate, citric acid monohydrate, histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sorbitol, 
polysorbate 20 and water for injections. 
This new presentation is presented as one pack of 2 boxes each containing 1 vial (0.8 ml sterile solution), 1 
empty sterile injection syringe, 1 needle, 1 vial adapter and 2 alcohol pads. 
Additionally,  within  this  application,  the  marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH)  would  like  to  register  a 
manufacturing/Quality Control testing site for the Imraldi 40 mg/0.8 mL vial finished product.  
The MAH also submitted a Type IB variation together with the line extension application to update the Product 
Information for pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen to be in the line with the line extension application. 
Only data supportive of the proposed extension application is submitted. For all other sections, reference is 
made to the currently approved dossier of Imraldi. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
In section 3.2.S.4.5, only contents describing the finished product container closure has been updated from “per 
syringe” to “per container” since glass vial has been added as Imraldi finished product container closure. The 
other sections of Module 3.2.S remain unchanged.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development   
Manufacturing process development 
A thorough pharmaceutical development was conducted by exploring the changes needed for finished product 
manufacturing site transfer and by comparing the changes needed for in-process controls (IPC) and in-process 
tests. The MAH presented process changes proposed for facility fit and container closure difference. In addition 
some changes are introduced in the IPC tests. The process changes were confirmed by validation and considered 
as technical adaptation of the equipment and facility.  
The MAH compared the finished product physicochemical and biological characteristics after the transfer. The 
MAH demonstrated comparability of the vial product to PFS product. The results show that the finished product 
manufacturing site addition and vial filling process do not impact product quality in terms of physicochemical 
and biological attributes.  
It is confirmed that the new facility is capable of producing a finished product comparable to the finished product 
from the already approved manufacturing sites. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  vial  manufacturing  process  involves  thawing,  pooling,  and  mixing  of  the  active  substance,  followed  by 
sterile filtration and aseptic vial filling, stopper placement, and capping. The SB5 vial finished product contains 
formulated  SB5  active  substance  at  a  nominal  concentration  of  50  mg/mL.  The  only  processing  that  occurs 
between  active  substance and  finished  product  is  sterile  filtration  and  aseptic  filling  into  vials,  and  thus  the 
composition of the finished product is identical to the composition of the active substance.  
The  manufacturing  process  is  adequately  described  and  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  controls  in  place  are 
sufficient to produce a product of acceptable quality. The control strategy defining the critical and non-critical 
process  steps  is  agreed.  Both  critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  and  key  process  parameter  (KPPs)  have 
operating ranges and action limits because they can respectively affect product quality or process performance 
or consistency. The non-KPPs are unlikely to affect either process performance or product quality, and as such 
only have operating ranges. Likewise critical in-process controls (CIPCs) and critical in-process tests (CIPTs) are 
the subset of IPCs and IPTs which have action limits or in-process specifications. In-process measurements are 
used to assess process consistency and/or measured to evaluate process scale-up, but do not have action limits. 
The  presented  validation  of  the  manufacturing  steps  has  been  successfully  completed,  meeting  the  defined 
specifications. The proposed validation ranges are appropriate for control of product and ensure  no adverse 
impact on the critical quality attributes (CQAs).  
Container closure 
The primary packaging materials for SB5 vial presentation are a sterile Type I borosilicate glass vial, a sterile 
chlorobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium crimping cap. The glass vial and the stopper are of compendial 
quality.  The  container  closure  system  is  adequately  presented  and  all  components  have  a  CE-mark  and 
declaration of conformity. In these certificates the supplier of the device is stated. The information is included in 
the dossier Section 3.2.P.7 as well. In addition the sterilisation method for primary packaging components is 
presented in detail. 
Extractables and leachables studies were performed on the vial presentation, which demonstrate compatibility 
of SB5 with the container closure system.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation and a variation of marketing authorisation  
EMA/399654/2019 
Page 9/25 
  
  
The new vial presentation was demonstrated to be safe and to fulfill the requirements set for the container 
closure. The MAH addressed the risk of trace element impurities as required by ICH Q3D. 
Product specification 
The  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  for  the  SB5  finished  product  are  presented  and  include  control  of 
identity, purity and impurity, biological activity and other general tests. 
Batch analysis 
Details of batches including batch size, manufacturing site and conditions, and use in SB5 development were 
presented together with the results. All the batches complied with the specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data provided in this submission for the vial presentation are available at long-term, at accelerated, and 
at stress storage conditions.. All results met the acceptance criteria. 
It can be concluded that the vial presentation does not change the stability of the finished product substantially 
and hence the proposed shelf life for the vial finished product of 36 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C is acceptable. 
The vial should be kept in the outer carton in order to protect it from light. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the 
European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to 
the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Adventitious agents 
Module 3.2.A.2 is not affected by this application. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant adequately addressed the three minor issues identified during the procedure.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, CHMP considers that this line extension 
application is approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data has been generated for the 40 mg/0.8 ml vial. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As Imraldi is a biosimilar product to Humira having adalimumab as the active substance, the absence of formal 
ERA is justified given the nature of the product and the expected exposure, in accordance with the EMA guideline

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3.0 is acceptable.  
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:  
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of a 
bridging report making reference to Humira 40mg/0.8ml solution for injection. The bridging report submitted by 
the MAH has been found acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Imraldi is authorised in all indications in accordance with its reference medicinal product Humira. For paediatric 
indications doses lower than 40mg should be given to patients 10kg to <30kg but Imraldi was so far only 
available as single dose 40 mg prefilled syringe (PFS) or pen. The present line extension is to add a new strength 
Imraldi 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection in a vial to allow weight adapted dosing in paediatric patients 
requiring less than a full 40mg dose.  
The review of the quality data indicates that the extension of marketing authorisation is approvable. No clinical 
or non-clinical data were submitted. 
Accordingly the PI for Imraldi is updated to add the strength 40mg/0.8ml solution for injection in a vial and to 
include dosing instructions pertaining to the paediatric patients for whom lower dose than 40mg based on body 
weight can be needed. The product information has been updated to include also the recently approved 
paediatric uveitis indication (IB/0023). Minor additional amendments to the SmPC and PL are also made to align 
the PI with Humira (the reference product). 
The RMP v3.0 has been updated to include the new strength 40mg/0.8ml solution for injection in a vial and to 
align with the latest approved version for Humira. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Imraldi is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit-risk balance of 
Imraldi new strength is favourable in the following indications: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis polyarticular (JIA): 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Paediatric Crohn’s disease 
      Adolescent Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 
      Paediatric uveitis.

EMA/399654/2019 
Page 23/25 
  
  
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Imraldi subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product Characteristics, 
section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the 
list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to launch of Imraldi in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree about the 
content and format of the educational programme, including distribution modalities, and any other aspects of 
the programme, with the National Competent Authority. The educational program consists of a Patient Reminder 
Card. 
The Patient Reminder Cards should contain the following key elements:  
•  serious infections 
• 
tuberculosis 
•  cancer 
•  nervous system problems 
•  vaccinations

In addition, CHMP recommends the variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning the 
following changes: 
Variations approved 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.z  
C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and Veterinary 
Type IB 
I and IIIB 
Medicinal Products - Other variation 
Extension application to introduce a new strength of 40 mg/0.8 ml solution for injection in a vial, to allow the 
administration to paediatric patients requiring less than a full 40mg dose. 
C.I.z - To update the Product Information for the pre-filled syringe (EU/1/17/1216/001-004) and pre-filled pen 
(EU/1/17/1216/005-008) presentations in line with the dosage regimen changes introduced with the extension 
application. Minor additional amendments to the SmPC and PL are also made to align the PI with Humira (the 
reference product). 
The RMP (version 3.0) is updated in accordance.

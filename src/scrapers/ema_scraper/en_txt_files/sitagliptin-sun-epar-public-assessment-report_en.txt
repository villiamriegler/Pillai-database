2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The application for marketing authorisation of Sitagliptin SUN 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg film-coated 
tablets is submitted under Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended (i.e. a generic MA 
application). The reference product is Januvia 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets, marketed 
by Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., that was first approved in the European Union on 21/03/2007 via the 
centralised procedure (EU/1/07/383). 
Sitagliptin SUN contains ‘sitagliptin fumarate’, a different salt form as compared to the reference 
product Januvia that contains the salt ‘sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate’. According to Article 10(2) 
of Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended), “The different salts, esters, isomers, mixtures of isomers, 
complexes or derivatives of an active substance shall be considered to be the same active substance, 
unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and /or efficacy.” Sitagliptin fumarate 
and sitagliptin phosphate do not significantly differ with regard to safety and efficacy and as such, can 
be considered to be the same active substance. 
Sitagliptin is a member of a class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 
(DPP-4) inhibitors, which improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes by enhancing the 
levels of active incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 
glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, 
and levels are increased in response to a meal. The incretins are part of an endogenous system 
involved in the physiological regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are 
normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by 
intracellular signalling pathways involving cyclic AMP. Treatment with GLP-1 or with DPP-4 inhibitors in 
animal models of type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated to improve beta cell responsiveness to 
glucose and stimulate insulin biosynthesis and release. With higher insulin levels, tissue glucose uptake 
is enhanced. In addition, GLP-1 lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. Decreased 
glucagon concentrations, along with higher insulin levels, lead to reduced hepatic glucose production, 
resulting in a decrease in blood glucose levels. The effects of GLP-1 and GIP are glucose-dependent. 
When blood glucose concentrations are low, stimulation of insulin release and suppression of glucagon 
secretion by GLP-1 are not observed. For both GLP-1 and GIP, stimulation of insulin secretion is 
markedly enhanced as glucose rises above normal concentrations. GLP-1 does not impair the normal 
glucagon response to hypoglycaemia. The activity of GLP-1 and GIP is limited by the DPP-4 enzyme, 
which rapidly hydrolyses the incretin hormones to produce inactive products. Sitagliptin prevents the 
hydrolysis of incretin hormones by DPP-4, thereby increasing plasma concentrations of the active 
forms of GLP-1 and GIP. By enhancing active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and 
decreases glucagon levels in a glucose-dependent manner. This glucose-dependent mechanism is 
unlike the mechanism seen with sulfonylureas where insulin is released even when glucose levels are 
low, which can lead to hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and in normal subjects. In 
patients with type 2 diabetes with hyperglycaemia, these changes in insulin and glucagon levels lead to 
lower haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lower fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations. Sitagliptin 
inhibits DPP-4 with nanomolar potency (IC50 18 nM). It does not inhibit the closely-related enzymes 
DPP-8 or DPP-9 at therapeutic concentrations. Inhibition of DPP-8 or DPP-9 is associated with toxicity 
in preclinical animal models and alteration of immune function in vitro. 
The indications applied for Sitagliptin SUN are the same as those for the reference product Januvia:  
“For adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Sitagliptin SUN is indicated to improve 
glycaemic control:

as monotherapy: 
•

metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
as dual oral therapy in combination with: 
• 
• 
• 
metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate 
glycaemic control. 
a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a 
sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin 
is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e. a 
thiazolidinedione) when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet and 
exercise plus the PPARγ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
as triple oral therapy in combination with: 
• 
• 
a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these 
medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
a PPARγ agonist and metformin when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when 
diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide 
adequate glycaemic control. 
Sitagliptin SUN is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and 
exercise plus stable dose of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control.” 
Sitagliptin SUN tablets are administered orally and can be taken with or without food. The tablets are 
not to be crushed or broken before administration. The recommended starting dose of sitagliptin is 100 
mg. If sitagliptin is taken with a sulphonylurea or insulin, the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may 
need to be lowered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels). In patients with 
moderately or severely reduced kidney function the dose of sitagliptin should be reduced. 
Sitagliptin should not be used in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age because of insufficient 
efficacy. Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC. Sitagliptin 
has not been studied in paediatric patients under 10 years of age. 
Serious side effects reported with sitagliptin include pancreatitis and hypersensitivity. Hypoglycaemia 
has been reported in combination with a sulphonylurea and with insulin. For the full list of all side 
effects reported, see the SmPC. 
Sitagliptin must not be used in people who are hypersensitive (allergic) to sitagliptin or any of the 
other ingredients and in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. 
2.2.  Quality aspects

The product is available in PA/Alu/PE + desiccant/HDPE/Alu blisters and in HDPE bottles as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The chemical name of sitagliptin fumarate is 7-[(3R)-3-amino-1-oxo-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butyl]-
5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-3- (trifluoromethyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazine fumarate corresponding to the 
molecular formula C20H19F6N5O5. It has a relative molecular mass of 523.38 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of sitagliptin fumarate was elucidated by a combination of nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR), mass 
spectrometry (MS), infra-red spectroscopy and UV spectroscopy. 
Sitagliptin fumarate is a white to off-white crystalline powder, it is non-hygroscopic and soluble in 
water. Sitagliptin fumarate has good solubility across the physiological pH range. 
Sitagliptin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The R-enantiomer is used 
as active substance and the undesired S-enantiomer is routinely controlled by chiral HPLC in the active 
substance specification. 
Polymorphism has been observed for sitagliptin. The polymorphic form of sitagliptin fumarate active 
substance was measured by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). It has been demonstrated that the active 
substance manufacturer consistently produces polymorphic form-I. The polymorphic form is controlled 
in the active substance via testing by XRPD. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. The ASMF holder is the single supplier of 
sitagliptin fumarate. A number of sites are involved in the manufacturing process. 
Sitagliptin fumarate is synthesised in 10 main steps using two well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.  
Assessment report  
EMA/611380/2021  
Page 10/26 
 
 
 
 
During the procedure, a major objection was raised in relation to the designation of a starting material 
as initially proposed. In response, a re-defined starting material was proposed, which was considered 
acceptable and resolved the major objection. 
A further major objection was raised in relation to the designation and control of a second starting 
material. In response, a satisfactory control strategy in line with ICH M7 (option 3) was presented and 
the fate of impurities originating from the starting material has been discussed. All potential impurities 
that can form during manufacture of the starting material are included in the starting material 
specification. Based on the additional information provided, this active substance starting material for 
sitagliptin fumarate is acceptable. 
The specifications and control methods for starting materials, intermediates and reagents have been 
presented. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The characterisation of the 
active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of active 
substances.  
Potential and actual impurities are well discussed and characterised. The origin and fate of each 
impurity has been addressed. The limits of specified, unspecified and total impurities comply with the 
relevant ICH guidelines. The analytical results provided confirm the ability of the process to remove 
impurities to the very low limits specified.  
The information regarding potential genotoxic impurities has been presented in the restricted part of 
ASMF as it is related to the detailed description of the manufacturing process. The ASMF holder has 
adequately justified that these impurities do not need to be controlled in the final active substance.  
The proposed limits of residual solvents are in line with the ICH Q3C requirements and their presence 
and fate have been sufficiently addressed. Solvents used in the final three steps of the active 
substance synthesis are also controlled in the active substance specification. 
Changes introduced during development of the commercial manufacturing process have been 
presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The active substance is packaged in a transparent inner LDPE bag, which is twisted and tied. The bag is 
then inserted into a black LDPE bag and heat sealed. Both bags are further packed into an outer bag and 
the triple bag is then placed in a HDPE carboy under nitrogen blanketing. Satisfactory information has 
been provided on the packaging material which complies with Ph. Eur. requirements and EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
2.2.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description (visual), solubility (Ph. Eur.), identity 
(HPLC, IR), water content (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (sulphated ash), impurities (HPLC), chiral 
purity (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), content of fumaric acid (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), tapped bulk 
density (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (XRPD).  
Limits for impurities have been set in line with ICH requirements and based on batch data. Limits for 
residual solvents have been set in line with ICH Q3C requirements. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from three commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Assessment report  
EMA/611380/2021  
Page 11/26 
 
 
 
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from five production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 18 
months under long term conditions (5°C ± 3°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(25°C / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. All stability indicating parameters of 
the active substance specification have been tested (description, identification by IR, water content, 
related substances, impurities, chiral purity and assay). The analytical methods used were the same as 
for release and are stability indicating. Under long term conditions, all results remained within the 
acceptance limits and no trends were observed. Levels of impurities remained low under long term 
storage conditions. Under accelerated conditions, an increase in impurities was observed, but all the 
results remained well within specification.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed. Samples were analysed for 
description, assay, fumaric acid content, chiral purity and related substances. The data showed no 
significant change in the tested parameters. It can therefore be concluded that sitagliptin fumarate is 
photostable. 
Results from forced degradation studies showed no significant increase in the level of impurities under 
peroxide, photolytic and humidity conditions indicating that the active substance is stable under these 
conditions. However, degradation was observed under acid, alkali and thermal degradation conditions 
demonstrating that the active substance is not stable under these conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored in 
well-closed containers between 2°C to 8°C. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg of 
sitagliptin (as fumarate salt) as active substance. The different tablet strengths are appropriately 
differentiated by their colour, size and debossing.

The  objective  of  formulation  development  was  to  design  a  generic  immediate  release  solid  dosage 
formulation containing the active substance sitagliptin, which is similar and bioequivalent to the reference 
product Januvia. The qualitative formulation was developed in line with the reference product and the 
quantity of each excipient was determined based on optimisation studies. 
Sitagliptin Sun film-coated tablets contain a different salt form of the active substance sitagliptin in 
comparison to the reference product (fumarate salt vs phosphate salt used in Januvia). While fumaric

acid is a weak organic acid, phosphoric acid is a strong inorganic acid. Fumarate salts of active 
substances have been widely used in approved oral medicinal products and the active substance 
sitagliptin in the fumarate form is expected to exhibit the same pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics 
and toxicity as the active substance in the reference product. 
As the active substance sitagliptin fumarate exhibits polymorphism, the stability of the polymorphic 
form produced was investigated at 40 °C/75 % RH over six months. Tablets packed in blisters and 
HDPE bottles were studied. No change in polymorphic form was observed, demonstrating that the 
polymorphic form of the active substance does not change during manufacture or storage of the 
finished product. 
Based on the results of excipient compatibility studies, excipients for the core tablet with similar 
functional use compared to the reference product formulation were selected. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, except for the film-coating material which is controlled according to in-house specifications. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included 
in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The quality target profile for the product contains suitable targets and justifications for this generic oral 
dosage form and is based on the properties of the active substance, information on the reference product 
and  consideration  of  the  label  and  intended  patient  population  of  the  reference  product.  All  finished 
product critical quality attributes were identified with low risk.  
Bioequivalence  was  studied  between  Sitagliptin  SUN  and  the  reference  product  Januvia.  The 
bioequivalence study was conducted by comparing Sitagliptin SUN 100 mg tablets with Januvia 100 mg 
tablets. The 100 mg Sitagliptin SUN batch used for the bioequivalence study was manufactured according 
to  the  commercial  manufacturing  process  and  has  the  same  composition  as  the  commercial  100  mg 
formulation. In addition to the study, comparative in-vitro dissolution studies were conducted Dissolution 
was compared across the physiological pH range of 1.2 to 6.8 (0.1 M HCl pH 1.2, acetate buffer pH 4.5 
and phosphate buffer pH 6.8) and in purified water. The finished product is rapidly dissolving (i.e. more 
than  85%  within  15  min)  at  all  tested  pH  conditions  and  the  dissolution  of  Sitagliptin  SUN  and  the 
reference product was found to be comparable. To support a biowaiver of strength, dissolution rates for 
the biobatch 100 mg tablet were compared with the dissolutions rates for the lower strengths tablets 
(25 mg and 50 mg) and found to be comparable. The three different strengths of the medicinal product 
are dose proportional and manufactured using a common blend and using the same process. A biowaiver 
can be accepted for the additional strengths as the requirements of the guideline on the investigation of 
bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **) are met. In addition, dissolution of the batch 
used  for  bioequivalence  studies  was  compared  with  two  other  100  mg  batches  in  QC  media  to  show 
batch-to-batch consistency. 
Development  studies  for  the  dissolution  method  to  be  used  for  quality  control  (QC)  were  carried  out 
using  the  highest  strength  tablet  as  the  worst-case  scenario.  Similar  dissolution  was  observed  with 
different apparatus, dissolution media, volume and rpm.  
The discriminatory nature of the dissolution method has been evaluated. It can be concluded, that the 
suitability of the test conditions for routine testing has been demonstrated using batches with different 
quality attributes. Sufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that due to the high solubility 
of  the  active  substance  the  dissolution  method  could  not  be  developed  further  to  increase  the 
discriminatory power. The selected QC dissolution test method is acceptable. As an additional measure 
to control the quality of the finished product, a disintegration test has been included in the specification 
for sitagliptin tablets.

Direct compression was chosen as an appropriate process. A risk assessment of the overall drug product 
manufacturing process was performed to identify the level of risk that may affect the CQAs of the final 
drug  product.  In  different  manufacturing  steps  CQAs  were  identified  but  all  risks  were  assigned  as 
medium (or low). Further experiments were performed subsequently for each medium risk process step 
to  identify  the  suitable  process  parameter  range.  After  detailed  experimentation,  the  initial 
manufacturing process risk assessment was updated, and the risks were reduced to an acceptable level 
(low) and critical process parameters were defined. 
An  in-process  hold  time  study  was  performed  on  blend,  core  tablets  and  coated  tablets.  Description, 
assay, related substances, water, disintegration (for core and coated tablets only), dissolution (for core 
and coated tablets only) and microbial purity were studied. No significant change was observed However, 
no hold time is proposed. This is acceptable taking into account that the finished product is a solid oral 
dosage form and in line with the guideline “Note for Guidance on Start of Shelf-life of the Finished Dosage 
Form (CPMP/QWP/072/96)” as the maximum holding time of 30 days has not been exceeded. 
The primary packaging is either PA/Alu/PE + desiccant/HDPE/Alu blisters or HDPE bottles. The material 
complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  eight  main  steps:  dispensing,  sifting,  blending,  lubrication, 
compression, preparation of film coating dispersion and film-coating. The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process. 
The critical steps in the manufacture of Sitagliptin 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets are 
blending,  compression  and  packaging  and  during  these  manufacturing  steps  in-process  controls  are 
performed. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three commercial-scale batches. It 
has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. An acceptable validation protocol has been submitted and 
the process will be fully validated before commercialisation. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form.  
2.2.3.1.  Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description  (in-house),  identification  (HPLC,  IR,  colour  test),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.), 
average weight (in-house), water content (KF), disintegration time (Ph. Eur), dissolution (HPLC), related 
substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), microbial purity (Ph. Eur.) and residual solvents (GC).  
The proposed specification is in line with ICH Q6A and the Ph. Eur. monographs for Pharmaceutical 
Preparations and Tablets. It is noted that a Ph. Eur. monograph for sitagliptin tablets is available. 
However, as this monograph concerns the product containing a different sitagliptin salt (phosphate 
monohydrate) than that used in Sitagliptin SUN tablets (fumarate), the monograph is not applicable for 
the product in this application.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The information on 
the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
Assessment report  
EMA/611380/2021

marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is 
accepted that no risk was identified of the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed 
necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
2.2.3.2.  Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  three  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  18  months  under  long  term 
conditions  (25°C  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40°C  /  75%RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative of 
those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing. 
Stability studies were conducted for the blister pack and for the HDPE bottles.  
Samples were tested for description, water content, dissolution, related substances, assay, disintegration 
time and microbial purity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
All  results  were  within  the  proposed  shelf-life  specifications  and  no  significant  changes  have  been 
observed. 
In addition, two batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. No significant changes were observed. 
In-use stability studies 
In-use stability studies have been performed on two batches of Sitagliptin tablets 25 mg, and 100 mg 
packed in HDPE bottles with 33mm/38mm child resistant closure with seal liner, which is proposed for 
marketing.  The  bottles  contained  90  tablets.  The  in-use  stability  studies  have  been  performed  at 
25°C/60%RH for 180 days and all results remained within specification limits. Hence there is no need to 
specify an in-use shelf life. 
Start of Shelf-life of Finished Dosage Form  
Calculation of the product’s shelf-life complies with guidance on the start of shelf-life of the finished 
dosage form (CPMP/QWP/072/96/EMEA/CVMP/453/01). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) 
is acceptable. As stated in the SmPC (section 6.4), the product does not require any special storage 
conditions. 
2.2.3.3.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Two major objections related to designation and control of 
the active substance starting materials have been resolved during the procedure. Bioequivalence has 
been demonstrated between Sitagliptin SUN 100 mg film-coated tablet and the reference product, 
Januvia 100 mg film-coated tablet, and biowaivers have been accepted for the other strengths (25 mg 
and 50 mg). The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
According to Article 10(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended), “The different salts, esters, isomers, 
mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of an active substance shall be considered to be the same 
active  substance,  unless  they  differ  significantly  in  properties  with  regard  to  safety  and/or  efficacy.” 
There are no specific concerns identified with regard to the new salt form used in the finished product. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Sitagliptin SUN manufactured by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Europe B.V. is 
considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all sitagliptin 
fumarate containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the 
ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In single dose toxicity studies conducted with sitagliptin in rats, the highest non-lethal dose was 271 and 
182 times the human exposure based on AUC, respectively.  
In  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  the  maximum  non-lethal  dose  was  750  mg/kg/day  for  mice 
(approximately  80  times  the  human  exposure  based  on  AUC),  500  mg/kg/day  for  rats  (48  times  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/611380/2021  
Page 16/26 
 
 
 
human exposure based on AUC), and ≥ 50 mg/kg/day for dogs (≥ 22 times the human exposure based 
on AUC). Liver toxicity was seen in both mice and rats.  
Sitagliptin showed no genotoxic effects in in vitro or in vivo assays on mutagenicity (Ames test), direct 
DNA damage, or clastogenicity.  
In  the  two-year  mouse  carcinogenicity  study,  there  were  no  treatment-related  increases  in  tumour 
incidence  in  any  organ  at  all  tested  doses  (50,  125,  250,  500  mg/kg/day).  In  the  two-year  rat 
carcinogenicity study, there was a treatment-related increase in hepatic tumours at systemic exposure 
levels 58-times the human exposure levels.  
Sitagliptin did not affect male or female fertility in rats at the limit dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, 
maternal toxicity was seen at 500 mg/kg/day (decreased food consumption, no faeces). Sitagliptin was 
shown to cross the placental barrier with foetal exposure values 45 to 80% those in the dam and was 
also concentrated in milk about 4-fold compared to plasma in rats.  
The series of toxicology studies have demonstrated the toxicologic and safety profile of fumarate in a 
variety  of  animal  species.  Fumarate  was  found  to  be  non-genotoxic,  non-carcinogenic  in  animal  and 
human, and did not cause reproductive toxicities. Available non-clinical data provides evidence to support 
the safety of fumarate in human. As maximum daily dose of sitagliptin in human is 100 mg, the maximum 
intake of fumarate through sitagliptin fumarate tablets would be only approximately 28.5 mg/day which 
is within the acceptable intake.  
In conclusion, presented preclinical data provides evidence to support the safety of sitagliptin fumarate 
in human and no new or unexpected safety concern unlikely to arise due to salt change. The proposed 
drug product is expected to be safe and well tolerated. 
The justification for the lack of full Environmental Risk Assessment is endorsed; the proposed generic 
product does not lead to an increase of environmental exposure of the active substance. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Sitagliptin SUN and justifications that 
the different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regard to safety 
and efficacy of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in 
accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non-clinical studies were not considered 
necessary. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets containing sitagliptin fumarate. 
To support the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted a bioequivalence study on 
sitagliptin 100 mg film-coated tablets with cross-over design under fasting conditions. This study was 
the pivotal study for the assessment. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. 
For the clinical assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1) in its current version is of particular relevance as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method 
validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09). 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/611380/2021  
Page 17/26 
 
 
 
SmPC of the reference product. 
GCP aspect 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
The Applicant requested a biowaiver for the additional strengths 25 mg and 50 mg film-coated tablets, 
suggesting that the bioequivalence study results of the 100mg strength can be extended to 25 mg and 
50  mg  film-coated  tablets,  according  to  the  general  biowaiver  requirements  [Ref:  Guideline  on  the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence, Doc. Ref.: CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr**, since the following 
holds: 
a) All the strengths i.e. 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg film-coated tablets are manufactured by the 
same manufacturer i.e. Sun Pharmaceutical Ind. Ltd. using the same manufacturing process; 
b) The qualitative composition of the different sitagliptin film-coated tablet strengths is the same; 
c) The compositions of the strengths are quantitatively proportional, i.e. the ratio between the 
amounts of each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is the same for all strengths; 
d)  The  dissolution  profiles  are  similar  under  identical  conditions  for  the  additional  strengths 
compared to the batch used in the bioequivalence study; 
e)  Sitagliptin  demonstrates  linear  pharmacokinetics:  AUC  of  sitagliptin  increases  in  a  dose-
proportional manner over the therapeutic dose range. 
The rationale for a biowaiver for the 25 mg and 50 mg strengths was accepted. 
2.4.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study BE/20/206: An open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, 
single  dose,  crossover  bioequivalence  study  of  Sitagliptin  tablets  100  mg  of  Sun  Pharmaceutical 
Industries Limited, India with Januvia (Sitagliptin) film coated tablets 100 mg of Merck Sharp & Dohme 
B.V. in normal, healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting condition. 
Methods 
•  Study design  
Study  BE/20/206  was  an  open-label,  bioanalyst-blinded,  randomized,  single  dose,  two-period,  two-
treatment cross-over bioequivalence study in healthy adult subjects under fasting conditions with a wash 
out period of 9 days between two administrations. In each period single dose of either test or reference 
product of 100 mg sitagliptin tablets was administered orally.  
•  Pharmacokinetic variables 
Primary variables were Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ 
Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters determined were AUC% Extrap, Tmax, Kel and T1/2 
•  Statistical methods 
Assessment report  
EMA/611380/2021  
Page 18/26 
 
 
 
The pharmacokinetic parameters for sitagliptin were calculated from the plasma concentration vs. time 
profile by non-compartmental model. Statistical comparison of the PK of the two formulations was carried 
out to assess the bioequivalence between test and reference formulations. 
Actual  time-points  of  the  sample  collection  are  used  for  the  calculation  of  PK  parameters.  All 
concentration values below the lower limit of quantification are set to zero for the pharmacokinetic and 
statistical calculations. Individual AUC parameters were calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. The 
log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ were analyzed using TYPE III sum 
of square with the main effects of sequence period, formulation, and subjects nested within sequence. 
The  sequence  effect  was  tested  at  the  10%  level  of  significance  using  the  subjects  nested  within 
sequence mean square as the error term. Formulation and period effect were tested at the 5% level of 
significance against the residual error (mean square error) from the ANOVA model as the error term.  
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence: 
The 90% confidence interval for the ratio of test and reference product averages (least squares means) 
for  pharmacokinetic  parameters  Cmax  and  AUC0-t  should  be  between  80%  and  125%  for  the  log-
transformed data.

2.4.2.2.  Pharmacokinetic conclusion   
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study,  Sitagliptin  SUN  100  mg  film-coated  tablets  by  Sun 
Pharmaceutical Ind. Ltd., Punjab, India are considered bioequivalent with Januvia 100 mg film-coated 
tablets by Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd., Cramlington, UK. 
The results of the study BE/20/206 with 100 mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths 25 
mg and 50 mg, according to conditions in the relevant Guidelines.

2.4.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. 
2.4.2.4.  Additional data 
The applicant has performed comparative dissolution studies between test product and reference product 
bio-batches. The dissolution profiles from those experiments demonstrate similarity between test product 
and reference formulation in all media, as more than 85% of drug is released within 15 minutes. 
2.4.2.5.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To  support  the  application,  the  applicant  has  submitted  a  single  dose  crossover  bioequivalence  study 
under fasting conditions to demonstrate essential similarity with the reference product Januvia 100 mg 
film-coated tablets (manufactured Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd., Cramlington, UK).  According to the SmPC 
of the reference product, the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin appears linear over the therapeutic dosage 
range. Sitagliptin can be taken with or without food. Therefore, the selection of the highest dose, 100 
mg,  to  be  used  in  the  bioequivalence  study  under  fasting  conditions  is  justified  and  in  accordance  to 
guidelines.  
Overall  study  design  is  acceptable  and  in  line  with  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  sitagliptin.  The 
bioequivalence study was conducted under standardised conditions. The sampling period was sufficient, 
the  sampling  time  schedule  and  wash-out  period  were  adequate  taking  into  account  the  tmax  and 
elimination half-life of sitagliptin. The sampling schedule reached up to 72 hours, however, the residual 
area was still evaluated and found to be lower than 20% for all subjects indicating that the duration of 
sampling was sufficient. 
Data regarding the test and reference product were sufficient. 
The  population  was  chosen  according  to  the  guidelines.  Bioanalytical  method  had  satisfactory 
performance and was adequately validated. The pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were 
appropriate for a single dose study. The 90% confidence intervals for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic 
variables Cmax and AUC0-t were within the conventional bioequivalence range of 80.00% to 125.00%. 
The pharmacokinetic variables for sitagliptin were comparable between test and reference product. Both 
formulations were well tolerated in the study.  
Additionally, the applicant has requested a biowaiver for the additional 25 mg and 50 mg strengths. To 
support the request, a justification and results of comparative dissolution tests have been provided. The 
in vitro dissolution tests complimentary to the bioequivalence study comparing the in vitro dissolution 
similarity  between  biowaiver  strengths  and  the  test  bio-batch  over  physiological  pH  range  and  in  QC 
media were conducted.  
Comparative  dissolution  profiles  demonstrated  that  the  bio-batch  and  biowaiver  strengths  of  test 
formulation were essentially similar over the physiological pH range and QC media. More than 85% of 
sitagliptin was dissolved within 15 minutes in all media, hence the calculation of f2 similarity factors was 
not  necessary.  All  criteria  for  a  biowaiver  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of

2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  Sitagliptin  SUN  25  mg,  50  mg  and  100  mg  film-coated 
tablets  are  considered  bioequivalent  with  Januvia  25  mg,  50  mg  and  100  mg  film-coated  tablets  (by 
Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd., Cramlington, UK).  
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Sitagliptin SUN and justifications that the 
different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety 
and efficacy of the reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in 
accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
The reference product containing sitagliptin phosphate and the generic product containing sitagliptin 
fumarate have similar pharmaceutical properties and dissolution profiles, both salts of the active 
substance dissolved rapidly at all pH levels tested. Sitagliptin is a high solubility compound with 
complete absorption, i.e. BSC class I.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of sitagliptin film-coated tablets. The reference product 
Januvia is indicated for:  
“For adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Januvia is indicated to improve glycaemic 
control:  
as monotherapy: 
• 
in patients inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone and for whom 
metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
as dual oral therapy in combination with: 
• 
• 
• 
metformin when diet and exercise plus metformin alone do not provide adequate 
glycaemic control. 
a sulphonylurea when diet and exercise plus maximal tolerated dose of a 
sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and when metformin 
is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e. a 
thiazolidinedione) when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet and 
exercise plus the PPARγ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
as triple oral therapy in combination with: 
• 
a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these 
Assessment report  
EMA/611380/2021

medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
• 
a PPARγ agonist and metformin when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when 
diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide 
adequate glycaemic control. 
Januvia is also indicated as add-on to insulin (with or without metformin) when diet and exercise 
plus stable dose of insulin do not provide adequate glycaemic control.” 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient.  
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with a two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single 
dose,  crossover  bioequivalence  study  of  sitagliptin  tablets  100  mg  of  Sun  Pharmaceutical  Industries 
Limited,  India  with  Januvia  (Sitagliptin)  film  coated  tablets  100  mg  of  Merck  Sharp  &  Dohme  B.V.  in 
normal, healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting condition. 
The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was 
in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling 
time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic 
and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Sitagliptin SUN met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the reference product Januvia. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals 
for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-72h, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined 
acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was 
demonstrated. 
This application contains a different salt than that of the active substance. A summary of the literature 
with regard to non-clinical and clinical data of Januvia and justifications that the different salt of the 
active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the 
reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant 
guideline and additional non clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information.

thiazolidinedione) when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when diet and 
exercise plus the PPARγ agonist alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
as triple oral therapy in combination with: 
• 
• 
a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these 
medicinal products do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
a PPARγ agonist and metformin when use of a PPARγ agonist is appropriate and when 
diet and exercise plus dual therapy with these medicinal products do not provide

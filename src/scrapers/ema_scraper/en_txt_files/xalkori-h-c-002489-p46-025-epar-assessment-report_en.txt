Introduction 
On  27  August  2020,  in  accordance  with  EMA,  the  MAH  submitted  A8081013  provisional  CSR  under 
Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  it  will  support  the  extension  of  the  indication  in 
paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory ALK-positive  systemic ALCL and with ALK-IMT.  
A PIP has been agreed for crizotinib with the PDCO in 2019 in the conditions of treatment of ALCL and 
treatment of IMT. 
The  PDCO  agreed  in  PIP  EMEA-001493-PIP03-18  that  the  completion  of  the  measure  for  Study 
A8081013  is  May  2020,  the  MAH  is  submitting  the  present  interim  CSR  under  Article  46  within  6 
months of the referred date and not within 6 months of the LSLV  as it has not yet occurred. 
The MAH would like to clarify that the LSLV for Study A8081013 (currently reported as December 2020 
in clinicaltrials.gov) is an estimate that is subject to re-evaluation and may be updated later in 2020. It 
is  difficult  to  determine  the  LSLV  date  for  this  study  because  as  per  study  protocol,  patients  are 
allowed  to  continue  treatment  with  crizotinib  as  long  as  there  is  evidence  of  clinical  benefit  in  the 
judgement of the Investigator. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information  on the development  program 
The MAH stated that Study A8081013 / Phase 1b Open Label Study of the Safety and Clinical Activity 
of Crizotinib (PF-02341066) in Tumors With  Genetic Events Involving the Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase 
(ALK)  Gene  Locus)  is  part  of  a  clinical  development  program.  The  extension  consisting  of  the  full 
relevant  data  package  (i.e.  containing  several  studies)  is  expected  to  be  submitted  by  June  2021.  A 
line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
1.2.  Information  on the pharmaceutical  formulation  used in the study 
Crizotinib  was  provided  as  capsules  containing  200  mg  or  250  mg  of  study  medication  and  was 
packaged in HDPE bottles. 
1.3.  Clinical  aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted an interim report for: 
•Phase 1b Open-Label Study of the Safety and Clinical Activity of Crizotinib (PF-02341066) in Tumors 
with  Genetic  Events  Involving  the  Anaplastic  Lymphoma  Kinase  (ALK)  Gene  Locus  (study  number 
A8081013).

1.3.2.  Clinical  study 
Study  A8081013:  a  Phase  1b  Open  Label  Study  of  the  Safety  and  Clinical  Activity  of  Crizotinib  (PF-
02341066)  in  Tumors  with  Genetic  Events  Involving  the  Anaplastic  Lymphoma  Kinase  (ALK)  Gene 
Locus).  
Description 
This  study  is  a non-randomised,  open-label,  multicentre,  single-arm  exploratory  study  evaluating  the 
antitumor activity, safety, and PK of crizotinib.  
Initially, patients (≥ 16 years) with a histologic or cytologic proven diagnosis of ALCL or other advanced 
malignancy  other  than  NSCLC, e.g.,  IMT,  for  which  no  standard  therapy  was  available  and  who  were 
positive  for  harbouring  a  translocation,  inversion,  mutation  or  amplification  event  involving  the  ALK 
gene locus were enrolled into the study. 
Initial reports of clinically meaningful results with crizotinib in patients with relapsed ALCL in the COG-
Sponsored Study ADVL0912 were published in 2011 (Gambacorti-Passerini et al, 2011). Because of the 
clinical  activity  of  crizotinib  observed  in  Study  ADVL0912,  the  age  range  in  Study  A8081013  was 
decreased  to  15  years  of  age  to  allow  additional  paediatric  patients  with  ALK-positive  ALCL  or  IMT 
outside the US to enroll into this study. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary objectives was to: 
- Assess the safety of oral single agent crizotinib administered to patients with advanced ALK-positive 
ALCL or other advanced malignancy other than NSCLC known to have an ALK genetic event and Screen 
for efficacy in this patient population. 
Secondary objectives were to: 
-  Correlate  ALK  genetic  events  (translocation,  mutation/amplification)  to  efficacy  outcome  measures 
including PFS and OS, 
-  Determine  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  in  this  patient  population  using  population  PK  (POPPK)  methods 
and explore correlations between PK, response and/or safety findings, 
- Correlate ALK genetic events (translocation, mutation/amplification) to outcome measures.  
CHMP comment 
The lack of a comparator in this single arm study (SAT) makes it difficult  to draw any clear conclusion 
about  crizotinib  benefit  as  compared  to  other  therapeutic  options.  However,  these  objectives  of  this 
SAT  are  considered  appropriate  to  assess the  antitumor  activity  and  the  safe  use  of  crizotinib  in  the 
(paediatric) population investigated.

Study design 
This study is an ongoing open-label, non-randomised, multi-center, single-arm exploratory study of an 
oral  agent,  crizotinib,  in  patients  with  advanced  malignancy  harbouring  a  translocation,  inversion 
mutation or amplification event involving the ALK gene locus. 
Study population /Sample size 
Main eligibility criteria: 
1- Age ≥ 15 years 
2-  Histologically  or  cytologically  proven  diagnosis  of  ALCL  or  other  advanced  malignancy  other  than 
NSCLC for whom no standard therapy is available 
3- Positive for translocation or inversion event involving the ALK gene locus 
4- Positive for ALK amplification events 
5- Positive for ALK activating point mutations 
6-  Solid  tumours  must  be  measurable  per  RECIST  version  1.1,  and  lymphomas  must  be  measurable 
per NCI International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
7- ECOG performance status 0-3 
Main ineligibility criteria: 
1- Mutations of amplifications involving the c-Met gene but not the ALK gene 
2- Concurrent treatment on another therapeutic clinical trial 
3- Prior therapy specifically directed against ALK 
Sample size  
The  sample  size  for  this  study  was  determined  empirically  based  on   expected  small  numbers  of 
patients in the population of interest. It was anticipated that a total of approximately 40 patients were 
to be enrolled in this study. 
Treatments 
In the study, patients received crizotinib at a starting dose of 250 mg BID orally continuously. 
Dosing interruption and/or intrapatient dose reduction by 1 and if needed, 2 dose level(s) was allowed 
depending  on  the  type  and  severity  of  toxicity  encountered  (Dose  Level  -1  was  200  mg  BID;  Dose 
Level -2 was 250 mg QD).

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  ORR  based  on  RECIST  version  1.1  for  solid  tumors  and  the  NCI 
International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for patients with ALCL or other NHL (2007) 
(Cheson et al. 2007). 
Secondary endpoints were: 
- PFS, OS, DR 
- Estimated probability  of survival at 6-months and 1 year. 
- Plasma concentrations of crizotinib, 
- Proportion of patients with each of the ALK genetic events (translocation, mutation, amplification). 
- Phosphorylation status of ALK in the tumor samples from surgery or biopsy pre- and post-treatment, 
when available. 
Safety: 
The  primary  safety  endpoint  was  type,  incidence,  severity,  seriousness  and  relationship  to  study 
medications of adverse events (AE) and any laboratory  abnormalities. 
Statistical Methods 
Safety Analysis: 
Frequencies of patients experiencing at least one adverse event (AE) will be displayed by body system 
and preferred term according to MedDRA terminology. 
Detailed information collected for each AE will include a description of the event, duration, whether the 
AE was serious, intensity, relationship to study drug, action taken, and clinical outcome. Severity of 
the AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0. 
The number and percentage of patients who experienced any serious AE (SAE), treatment related AE, 
and treatment related SAE will also be summarized. AE data will be presented across cycles and by 
cycle, as appropriate.  The denominator for each cycle is defined as those patients available at the start 
of the cycle who received at least 1 dose of crizotinib for that cycle. Emphasis in the analyses will be 
placed on AEs classified as treatment emergent. 
Additional summaries of AEs and other safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format 
and summarized descriptively, as appropriate. 
Efficacy Analysis: 
The study population for all analyses will include patients enrolled in the study who receive at least one 
dose  of  crizotinib.  Data  summaries/listings  will  be  presented  overall  as  well  as  separately  for  ALCL 
patients and patients with other malignancies (by tumor type, as applicable). Data for patients who are 
enrolled in the study but are later found to not have an ALK  genetic event will be presented separately.

Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no confirmatory inferential analyses are  planned, and no 
imputation  for  missing  data  will  be  done.  Descriptive  statistics  (such  as  means,  medians,  standard 
deviations  and  ranges  for  continuous  data  and  percentages  for  categorical  data)  will  be  used  to 
summarize  patient  characteristics,  treatment  administration,  efficacy,  safety,  molecular  medicine  and 
pharmacokinetic parameters.  Data will also be displayed graphically, where appropriate. 
Primary  Efficacy Analysis: 
The  best  response  (CR,  PR,  SD  or  PD)  per  RECIST  version  1.1,  or  the  NCI  International  Response 
Criteria  for  Non-Hodgkin’s  Lymphoma  (2007)  where  applicable,  will  be  summarized.  The  objective 
response  rate  (ORR)  will  also  be  summarized  along  with  the  corresponding  exact  2-sided  95% 
confidence interval calculated using a method based on the F distribution. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: 
Secondary,  time  to  event  endpoints  (eg,  PFS,  OS),  will  be  summarized  descriptively  using  Kaplan-
Meier methods and displayed graphically, where appropriate. 
CHMP comment 
As a reminder, crizotinib is currently authorised for the treatment of adult with NSCLC (ALK-positive or   
ROS1-positive).  The  present  study  proposed  to  include  paediatric  patients  with  ALK-positive  ALCL  or 
ALK-positive  IMT  in  the  authorized  population.  No  change  was  proposed  to  the  indication  statement. 
Therefore, the assessment of efficacy data from Study A8081013 primarily focuses to ensure that no 
concerns jeopardize the use of crizotinib for paediatric patients from 15 years of age.

Overall Population 
As of the data cutoff date (03 September 2019), a total of 44 patients (17 in the ALCL group, 9 in the 
IMT group and 18 in the Other Tumors group) were assigned to receive study treatment. Among these, 
there were 3 paediatric patients in the ALCL group and 2 in the IMT group. 
Ten (58.8%) patients in the ALCL group, 5 (55.6%) patients in the IMT group and 1 (5.6%) patients in 
Other Tumors group, were still on treatment. 
Paediatric Population 
Four  paediatric  patients  were  still  on  treatment  (2  in  the  ALCL  group  and  2  in  the  IMT  group). One 
paediatric  patient  in  the  ALCL  group  permanently  discontinued  from  treatment  due  to  global 
deterioration of health status.

Pharmacokinetic Results 
Due to the limited number of paediatric patients, no PK conclusions could be made. 
Biomarker  Results 
All paediatric ALCL and IMT patients were positive for ALK-translocation by local testing using IHC and 
FISH, respectively. 
Safety results 
There were no deaths in the paediatric population during the study. The safety profile of crizotinib was 
generally consistent with the known safety profile of crizotinib, even with long-term treatment; no new 
safety signals or long-term emerging AEs were identified. 
1.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  purpose  of  the  A8081013  study,  an  ongoing  MAH-sponsored  study  of  an  authorised  medicinal 
product, was to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK of crizotinib in patients whose tumours were found 
to have a translocation, mutation, or amplification involving the ALK gene locus, in tumour types other 
than NSCLC.  
A PIP has been agreed for crizotinib with the PDCO in 2019 in the conditions of treatment of ALCL and 
treatment of IMT.  
Relapsed  or  refractory  systemic  ALCL  and  unresectable,  recurrent,  or  refractory  IMT  are  both  rare, 
serious, and life-threatening diseases, and an unmet medical need remains for improved therapies for 
paediatric patients. 
Crizotinib  is  currently  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  adult  with  NSCLC  (ALK-positive  or      ROS1-
positive).  The  present  study  proposed  to  include  paediatric  patients  with  ALK-positive  ALCL  or  ALK-
positive  IMT  in  the  authorized  population.  No  change  was  proposed  to  the  indication  statement. 
Therefore, the assessment of efficacy data from Study A8081013 primarily focuses to ensure that no 
concerns jeopardize the use of crizotinib for paediatric patients from 15 years of age. 
This study enrolled a total of 5 paediatric patients (3 with relapsed or refractory systemic ALK-positive 
ALCL and 2 with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory  ALK-positive IMT) as of the data cutoff date of 
03  September  2019.  Paediatric  patients  represent  ~  11.4%  (5/44)  of  the  population  enrolled  in  this 
study. Given the inclusion criteria, the paediatric population is represented by adolescents.  
The study does not allow to draw robust conclusions for efficacy, due to limitations in study design and 
the  limited  number  of  paediatric  patients.  However,  in   the  population  targeted  by  this  study  and  in 
particular  adolescents  with  ALK-positive  ALCL  or  ALK-positive  IMT,  antitumor  activity  was  observed 
with crizotinib. 
No  new  or  unexpected  safety  signals  were  observed  from  the  study  and  the  safety  results  are 
consistent  with  prior  studies  and  the  established  safety  profile for  crizotinib.  Considering that  the  PIP 
for crizotinib is not yet completed, no changes in the SmPC were proposed by the MAH.  
At this stage no changes in the SmPC are proposed by the CHMP.

2.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
The  Art  46  study  has  been  considered  completed  by  PDCO  through  a  partial  compliance  check  and 
there  are  no  required  changes  to  the  SmPC.  Considering  that  the  ongoing  assessment  of  variation 
II/72 will provide more comprehensive data on safety and efficacy, the Art 46 is considered fulfilled.

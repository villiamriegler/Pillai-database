2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Lenvatinib is an oral multiple kinase inhibitor. It was approved as an orphan medicine in the EU under the 
tradename of Lenvima in the treatment of adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) on 
28 May 2015.  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Renal  cell  carcinomas  are  kidney  tumours  which  represent  approximately  90%  of  cases  of  kidney  cancer  in 
adults (Wahal and Mardi, 2014). These tumours arise from the cells of the proximal renal tubular epithelium. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Kisplyx is indicated in combination with everolimus for the treatment of adultpatients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy. 
According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer, both metastatic (M1 – distant metastasis present) and 
locally unresectable (T4 – tumor invades beyond Gerota’s fascia; N - any; M0) RCC are classified as Stage IV 
(Edge,  et  al.,  2010).  The  terms  “unresectable  advanced  RCC”  and  “metastatic  RCC”  are  used 
interchangeably, and since both represent Stage IV RCC, the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC 
is stated in the approved indications for second-line agents. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Kidney  cancer  represents  approximately  3%  of  all  cancers  worldwide  (Cohen,  et  al.,  2005,  Garcia  and  Rini, 
2007).  The  incidence  of  RCC  has  been  rising  steadily  and  the  5-year  prevalence  of  RCC  in  the  EU-28  (plus 
Iceland  and  Norway)  in  2015  was  estimated  to  be  229,465  cases  (adapted  from  Globocan  2012).  Despite 
substantial progress in the understanding and treatment of mRCC in recent years, its incidence is increasing, 
and  the  disease  is  still  considered  incurable.  Smoking  and  obesity  are  established  risk  factors  for  RCC 
development. RCC also appears to be more common in patients with end-stage renal failure, acquired renal 
cystic  disease  and  tuberous  sclerosis.  Approximately  2%–3%  of  RCC  are  hereditary  and  several  autosomal 
dominant syndromes are described, each with a distinct genetic basis and phenotype, the most common one 
being  Von  Hippel  Lindau  (VHL)  disease.  In  recent  years,  many  new  genes  associated  with  RCC  have  been 
reported (such as PBRM1, SETD2, BAP1) (ESMO guidelines, 2014; NCCN guidelines 2016). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features and pathogenesis 
Clear cell RCC is the most frequent pathological subtype of sporadic RCC in adults (70%–85%), with loss of 
3p  and  the  classical  clear  aspect  of  the  cells  due  to  glycogen  and  lipids  in  their  cytoplasm.  Other  subtypes 
historically  called  non  clear  RCC  include  papillary  RCC  (7%–15%)  shows  distribution  of  malignant  cells 
around capillary cores (papillae), chromophobe RCC (5%–10%) is made up of typical polygonal cells with a 
clear  delimitation  of  the  cytoplasmic  membrane  and  reticular  cytoplasm,  renal  medullary  carcinoma,  etc 
(Escudier  et  al,  2014).  Due  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  correlation  between  chromosomal  alterations, 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 9/162 
  
  
 
histological  subtypes  and  molecular  pathway  abnormalities,  new  morphological  variants  of  RCC  are  now 
recognised  according  to  the  Vancouver  classification  (Escudier  et  al,  2014).  Each  of  the  most  frequent 
morphological  genetic  RCC  subtypes  correlates  with  a  specific  molecular  pathway.  Examples  include  the 
hypoxia-inducible  pathway  (clear-cell,  papillary  type  II  through  the  FH  gene),  the  mTOR  signalling  pathway 
(clear-cell and papillary type II), the c Met-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway (papillary type I and translocation RCC). 
Inactivation  of  the  von  Hippel–Lindau  (VHL)  tumour  suppressor  protein  is  a  characteristic  of  clear  cell 
tumours, resulting in the deregulation of the VEGF signalling pathway. VEGFRs are typical receptor tyrosine 
kinases with an extracellular domain for ligand binding, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain, 
including  a  tyrosine  kinase  domain.  Activation  of  VEGF  signalling  pathways  promotes  the  growth  of  tumour 
blood cells. The major pro-angiogenic signal is generated from the ligand-activated VEGFR-2. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
More  than  50%  of  RCCs  are  currently  detected  incidentally.  However,  some  patients  with  RCC  still  present 
with  clinical  symptoms,  such  as  flank  pain,  gross  haematuria  and  palpable  abdominal  mass  (the  classical 
triad);  metastatic  symptoms  like  bone  pain  or  lung  nodules;  or  paraneoplastic  syndromes,  such  as 
hypercalcaemia, unexplained fever, erythrocytosis or wasting syndromes (Escudier et al, 2014). About 30% 
of patients with RCC have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and a significant proportion of patients 
with  localized  disease  treated  with  curative  nephrectomy  relapse  subsequently  with  metastatic  disease. 
Metastatic  RCC  is  associated  with  a  high  quality-of-life  burden,  based  on  physical,  psychological,  and  social 
criteria, and drastically reduced survival; only about 8% to 22.5% of mRCC patients survive for five years or 
more  as  compared  to  90%  of  patients  with  localized  renal  cancer.  The  extent  of  tumour  burden  and site of 
metastasis  contribute  to  local  symptoms.  The  most  frequent  locations  of  metastases  are  the  lungs, 
mediastinum,  bone,  liver,  and  brain.  Among  solid  cancer  types,  RCC  has  the  second  highest  incidence  of 
brain metastases.  
Risks assessment models have been developed to provide prognostic information for patients and to inform 
on  eligibility  and  risk  stratification  factors  for  clinical  trials.  The  Memorial  Sloan-Kettering  Cancer  Centre 
(MSKCC) stratifies patients by favourable, intermediate and poor risk according to 6 prognostic risk factors; 
Karnofsky  performance  status  (KPS),  haemoglobin  level,  corrected  serum  calcium,  time  from  diagnosis  to 
treatment,  platelets  and  neutrophil  levels.  Subsequently  established  and  validated  in  first-line  and  second-
line  setting  International  mRCC  Database  Consortium  (IMDC)  model  includes  3  prognostic  factors 
(haemoglobin level, corrected serum calcium and performance status) to stratify patients to risk groups.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Management  of  local  disease  includes  partial  or  radical  nephrectomy.  The  role  of  neo-adjuvant  or  adjuvant 
therapy  is  not  yet  established.  In  the  advanced  disease  setting  systemic  therapy  is  used.  Until  the 
development of agents that target tumour angiogenesis and other signaling pathways, systemic therapy with 
the cytokines interleukin 2 (IL-2) or interferon (IFN)-α was the main treatment for advanced RCC. However, 
the use of both agents has declined substantially since the introduction of molecular targeted therapies. 
Current  approved  treatments  for  metastatic  RCC  in  the  first-line  setting  comprise  targeted  therapies,  either 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKI:  sunitinib  and  pazopanib)  or  mammalian  target  of  rapamycin  (mTOR) 
inhibitors  (temsirolimus)  administered  as  single  agents,  bevacizumab  +  interferon  (IFN),  or  high-dose 
interleukin-2 (IL-2) (ESMO guidelines, 2014; NCCN guidelines, 2016). 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 10/162 
  
  
 
Approved  second-line  agents  include  TKIs:  sorafenib,  sunitinib,  axitinib,  and  pazopanib;  the  mTOR  inhibitor 
everolimus. 
A novel immunotherapeutic agent, Opdivo (nivolumab), belonging to a class of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(PD-1/PD-L1), has been recently granted approval by EC on 19/06/2015 for the treatment of advanced renal 
cell carcinoma after prior therapy in adults.   
Afinitor  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  advanced  renal  cell  carcinoma,  whose  disease  has 
progressed on or after treatment with VEGF-targeted therapy. The recommended dose is 10 mg everolimus 
once  daily.  Treatment  should  continue  as  long  as  clinical  benefit  is  observed  or  until  unacceptable  toxicity 
occurs. 
Relapsed  RCC  is  an  aggressive  tumor  and  the  optimal  sequencing  of  therapies,  or  combination  of  therapies 
which  would  lead  to  durable  responses  and  minimize  relapse  remains  a  challenge.  Current  strategies  have 
focused  on  the  development  of  new  therapeutic  agents,  optimal  sequencing,  and  combinations  of  these 
agents  to  maximize  their  impact  on  clinical  outcomes.  To  date,  however,  results  of  combination-therapy 
studies  (ie,  temsirolimus  plus  bevacizumab,  temsirolimus  plus  sunitinib,  erlotinib  plus  bevacizumab, 
everolimus  plus  bevacizumab)  have  shown  no  advantage  in  PFS  over  monotherapy  with  approved  single 
agents  and,  in  some  cases,  an  unacceptably  high  degree  of  toxicity  (Bukowski  et  al.,  2007;  Dorff,  et  al., 
2014;  Feldman,  et  al.,  2009;  Graves,  et  al.,  2013;  Hainsworth,  et  al.,  2010;  Kanesvaran,  et  al.,  2015; 
Negrier,  et  al.,  2011;  Powles,  et  al.,  2014;  Ravaud,  et  al.,  2013).  Therefore,  there  remains  a  significant 
unmet  medical  need  for  more  effective  treatment  options,  including  possible  combination  therapies,  with  a 
manageable safety profile in patients with advanced RCC.

About the product 
Indication 
Treatment of patients with advanced RCC who have failed prior 
interferon-alpha- or interleukin 2-based therapy or are considered 
unsuitable for such therapy 
Treatment of patients with advanced RCC, whose disease has 
progressed on or after treatment with VEGF-targeted therapy 
In adults for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC and for 
patients who have received prior cytokine therapy for advanced 
disease 
Treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC after failure of prior 
treatment with sunitinib or a cytokine 
Treatment of advanced RCC after prior therapy in adults 
Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that selectively inhibits the kinase activities of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4), in 
addition to other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 
receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4, the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor PDGFRα, KIT, and RET.  The 
combination of lenvatinib and everolimus showed increased antiangiogenic and antitumor activity as 
demonstrated by decreased human endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation, and VEGF signaling in vitro 
and tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer greater than each drug alone.

In the scope of this application, everolimus (Afinitor) is intended to be used in combination with lenvatinib. 
Indication and dosage 
Lenvima is formulated in 2 strengths of hypromellose hard capsules containing lenvatinib mesilate equivalent 
to either 4 mg or 10 mg of lenvatinib. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“Lenvatinib  is  indicated  in  combination  with  everolimus  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  unresectable 
advanced  or  metastatic  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC)  following  one  prior  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor 
(VEGF)-targeted therapy”. 
The approved indication further to the CHMP review is: 
“Kisplyx is indicated in combination with everolimus for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal 
cell carcinoma (RCC) following one vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted prior therapy”.  
The  proposed  recommended  daily  dose  of lenvatinib  is  18  mg  (one  10  mg  capsule  and  two 4  mg  capsules) 
once daily in combination with 5 mg of everolimus once daily. The daily doses of lenvatinib and, if necessary, 
everolimus are to be modified as needed according to the dose/toxicity management plan. 
If a patient misses a dose, and it cannot be taken within 12 hours, then that dose should be skipped and the 
next dose should be taken at the usual time of administration. 
Treatment should continue as long as there is clinical benefit or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to 
be of major public health interest. This was based on: 
• 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is expected to be positive. 
The applicant has provided comprehensive data.  
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as there is a need to develop strategies that may increase the 
degree of the antitumor effects and impedes the onset of/ or eliminates refractory disease. Combinations 
of  targeted  agents  may  be  one  method  to  achieve  these  goals.  Hence  the  proposed  combination  of 
lenvatinib and everolimus in the 2nd line setting could be seen as addressing an area of  unmet medical 
need. The results of the Phase 2 part of the conducted pivotal Study E7080-G000-205 suggest that the 
proposed combination of lenvatinib with everolimus is a successful combination therapy in the treatment 
of metastatic renal cancer which could have an impact on medical practice. The presented data appear 
to  support  a  therapeutic  advantage  for  efficacy  in  favor  of  the  proposed  lenvatinib-everolimus 
combination over existing monotherapies. 
• 
The intended drug combination is of major interest from the point of view of public health with regards 
to  the  number  of  patients  that  would  benefit  from  improved  treatment  strategies  for  metastatic  renal 
cancer.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of lenvatinib is 4-[3-Chloro-4-(N’-cyclopropylureido)phenoxy]-7-methoxyquinoline-6-
carboxamide methanesulfonate and it has the following structure: 
The active substance is a white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder, slightly soluble in water and practically 
insoluble in ethanol. The structure of lenvatinib mesilatewas elucidated by using elemental analysis, 
ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Lenvatinib is achiral.  
Lenvatinib mesilate exhibits polymorphism. Polymorphism is controlled during the manufacturing process of 
the active substance.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process of lenvatinib mesilate consists of two synthetic steps followed by salt formation. 
Five  crystallisations  ensure  the  control  of  the  impurity  profile  of  lenvatinib  mesilate.  Well  defined  starting 
materials with acceptable specifications are used. 
A  quality  by  design  (QbD)  approach  was  used  in  the  process  development  of  lenvatinib  mesilate.  A  quality 
target product profile (QTPP) was defined for the finished product and the properties of the active substance 
shown  to  impact  on  this  were  defined  as  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs).  Active  substance  CQAs  are 
impurities, residual solvents, residual genotoxins, particle size, and polymorphic form. 
Critical  process  parameters  (CPPs)  in  the  synthetic  process  were  identified  by  risk  assessment  (including 
failure mode effects analysis, FMEA), process knowledge, and both uni- and multi-variate experiments. Each 
of the 3 steps contains CPPs and thus all are considered critical. Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for all the 
CPPs have been defined. However, no design space is claimed by the applicant so for each step, only one CPP 
may be moved within its PAR with other CPPs held at their target set-point. 
The quality of the active substance is assured by a control strategy composed of the above-mentioned PARs 
and  a  series  of  in  process  controls  designed  to  limit  impurities  and  residual  solvents.  Adequate  in-process 
controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, 
starting  materials  and  reagents  have  been  presented.  Despite  the  QbD  approach  to  development,  the 
applicant employs traditional release testing to ensure the quality of the active substance. Data from the first 
process validation batch of lenvatinib mesilate is provided. The CPPs were all controlled within the PARs and 
the  lenvatinib  mesilate  thus  produced  was  of  adequate  quality  and  in  line  with  the  active  substance 
specification. 
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin  and  characterised.  All  potential  impurities  and  the  starting  material  (SM)  itself  have  been  evaluated 
according  to  CHMP  guidelines  on  genotoxic  impurities.  This  analysis  is  based  on  experimental  and 
computational SAR analysis using DEREK and MCASE software systems and Ames-test. There have been no 
impurities detected above the reporting threshold (0.05%) in 10 batches. A HPLC method was developed to 
detect  the  16  potential  impurities.  Specifications  for  only  2  from  16  potential  impurities  have  been  defined 
based  on  spiking  studies.  The  spike  study  of  genotoxic  impurity  demonstrates  that  during  manufacturing 
process  is  able  to  purge  to  levels  below  the  TTC  of  60ppm,  from  0.30%  to  3ppm,  in  the  intermediate.  The 
genotoxic impurities show no detectable levels in 10 batches. 
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Lenvatinib  mesilate  is  packed  inside  linear  low-density  polyethylene  (LLDPE)  film  on  the  inside  and  a  nylon 
film on the outside and secured with a cable. 
Specification 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (IR,  XRPD),  assay  (HPLC), 
related  substances  (HPLC),  genotoxic  impurities  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC,  HPLC),  residual  benzene 
(GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (USP), methanesulfonic acid content (ion chromatography), particle 
size (light diffraction measurement) and microbial limits (Ph Eur).

Impurities  present  at  higher  than  the  qualification  threshold  according  to  ICH  Q3A  were  qualified  by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Batch analysis data (6 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on 3  commercial  scale batches  of  active  substance  from  the proposed  manufacturer  stored  in 
the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions at 5 ºC ± 3 ºC  and for up 
to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  25  °C  ±  2  ºC  /60  ±  5  %  RH    according  to  the  ICH  guidelines 
were provided. The following parameters were tested: description, identification (XRPD), related substances, 
genotoxic  impurities,  water  content  and  assay.  No  significant  changes  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters 
were observed. 
Stress testing on the active substance in the solid state was performed under conditions of heat (60 ºC), light 
exposure (ICH photostability conditions) and high humidity (30 ºC/75 % RH). Under the stress conditions of 
light exposure and high humidity, no degradation products were observed and therefore the active substance 
can be considered photostable and non-hygroscopic.  Genotoxic impurities remain below LOQ or unchanged 
at 5°C and slightly increases at 25°C/60%RH. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Lenvatinib mesilate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which works as an anticancer drug. The aim was to develop 
and  oral  immediate  release  form  which  allows  patients  to  administer  the  drug  themselves,  easy  to  handle, 
and  obtain  desired  bioability.  The  product  is  presented  in  multiple  strengths  easily  distinguished  by 
combination  of  shape,  color,  shape  and  prints  to  allow  dose  adjustments  and  minimizes  risk  of  side  effects 
and the mix-up of strengths and products. 
The  active  substance  stability,  solubility,  polymorphism  and  particle  size  characteristics  were  taken  into 
account  during  the  pharmaceutical  development.  Lenvatinib  mesilate,  potentially  includes  a  genotoxic 
impurity and degradant, which is also a synthetic intermediate of lenvatinib. It was found to increase in the 
active  substance  by  decomposition  by  heat  stress. In  addition,  lenvatinib  mesilate  forms  a  gel  when  it  is  in 
contact with dissolution media. Therefore, the related substances and dissolution were designated as critical 
quality attributes for lenvatinib capsules.  
Film-coated tablets were first developed and used in the early clinical trials. However, it was found that the 
excipients  and  process  used  to  manufacture  this  pharmaceutical  form  had  a  negative  impact  on  related 
substances  and  increased  the  level  of  the  genotoxic  impurity  in  the  finished  product.  Because  of  these 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 15/162 
  
  
 
concerns, development of another formulation for commercial production was initiated. A capsule formulation 
was  developed  in  order  to  address  the  manufacturability  issues  associated  with  the  initial  tablet 
manufacturing process. These were used for pivotal clinical studies and selected as the pharmaceutical form 
of  the  marketed  product.  During  development,  it  was  decided  to  have  multiple  strengths  to  enable  dose 
reduction  during  treatment  and  to  minimize  occurrence  of  side  effects  and  exposure  to  genotoxic  process 
impurities.  
The  excipients  for  Kisplyx  were  selected  to  ensure  both  appropriate  stability  and  dissolution  of  the  finished 
product.  Therefore,  compatibility  of  the  active  substances  with  excipients,  their  functions,  and  their  relative 
concentrations were studied. 
Non-hygroscopic  excipients  were  chosen  to  limit  the  level  of  water  and  reduce  the  risk  of  degradation  of 
lenvatinib  mesilate.  Calcium  carbonate  was  selected  as  a  water  insoluble  inorganic  diluent,  which  could 
effectively avoid gelation of the active substance without preventing dispersion of drug substance particles.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and for the majority, their quality is compliant with 
Ph Eur standards. The only non-pharmacopeial excipients are low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose and the 
hypromellose capsule shells. The specification for low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose complies with the 
National Formulary (NF) and is considered to be acceptable. The components of the capsules comply with the 
Ph Eur with the exception of butyl alcohol for which no Ph Eur monograph exists. This component complies 
with the NF monograph. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that proposed for commercialization. 
A  bioequivalence  study  was  performed  between  capsules  and  tablets,  which  concluded  that  the  same 
strength of capsules (10mg) could be used for pivotal clinical studies.  
The manufacturing process is a standard process consisting of mixing, granulation, drying, milling, blending 
and  encapsulation  steps. An  initial  risk  assessment for  the  manufacturing  process  at  commercial production 
scale was performed so as to identify process parameters that were likely to have an impact on the CQAs of 
lenvatinib  capsules.  Development  and  formal  validation  data  are  convincing  that  the  physical  state  of  the 
active  substance  is  under  control  throughout  manufacturing  of  the  capsules.  Nevertheless,  the  CHMP 
recommended  testing  the  first  10  commercial  batches  intended  for  marketing  in  order  to  determine  the 
physical state of lenvatinib mesilate in the finished product. 
Lenvatinib capsules are packaged in polyamide and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) laminated aluminium film with 
push-through aluminium foil blisters (Alu/Alu blisters). Specifications for the forming film and lidding foil have 
been provided. The specifications contain an IR identification test. The forming lid is stated to comply with 
Ph. Eur. 3.1.11, EC Directive 2002/72EC and EC Directive 78/142/EEC. The lidding foil is stated to comply 
with EC Directive 2002/72EC and EC Directive 78/142/EEC. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured in two manufacturing sites. 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  consists in  a  conventional wet  granulation  of  nine  steps: 
mixing,  granulation,  drying,  milling,  blending,  encapsulation,  weight-sorting,  bulk  packaging,  and  blister 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 16/162 
  
  
 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Proven  acceptable  ranges  have  been  defined  for  the  following  steps  of  the  medicinal  product:    drying, 
encapsulation,  weight  sorting  and  blister  packaging.  The  available  development  data,  the  proposed  control 
strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, 
identification  (UV,  HPLC,  HPLC-PDA),  related  substances  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  dissolution  (Ph  Eur),  water 
content (Ph Eur), uniformity of dosage units (Ph Eur), and microbial limits (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches for each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
All batches were manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on 3 (1 commercial scale and 2 pilot scale) batches per strength of finished product stored 
under long term conditions for up to 24 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. Samples were tested for description, dissolution, related substances, assay, water content and 
microbiological limits. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In  addition,  1  batch  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products.  Under  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions  after  24  months  and  6  months 
respectively,  no  significant  changes  were  observed  and  there  was  no  difference  between  the  4  and  10  mg 
capsule strengths. During photostability studies no changes were observed in comparison to the initial time-
point or to a control sample stored in an open dish in the dark. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and the following storage condition “do 
not store above 25°C” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and finished product and 
their manufacturing process. However, no design space was claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
active substance and finished product. PARs are claimed for CPPs identified in both active substance and 
finished product manufacturing processes.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To test the first 10 commercial batches intended for marketing to determine the physical state of lenvatinib 
mesilate in the finished product. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal toxicology studies and the battery of safety pharmacology studies were conducted in accordance 
with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. In addition, all GLP studies were conducted by laboratories 
in countries that adhere to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) system for 
mutual acceptance of chemical safety data. 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, preliminary and dose-range finding (DRF) toxicology studies were 
generally non-GLP studies. 
Nonclinical studies of lenvatinib were generally conducted using lenvatinib mesilate, and doses are expressed 
in terms of the mesilate salt. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamic effects of lenvatinib were evaluated in in vitro kinase inhibition (profiling) 
assays, kinetic interaction studies, X-ray analysis of the crystal structure of the VEGFR2-lenvatinib complex, 
and in vitro cell-based assays evaluating the effects of lenvatinib on VEGF- and FGF-driven cellular activities 
in endothelial cells as well as the direct antitumor activity of lenvatinib.

In vitro studies 
Kinase Inhibition Profiling Studies  
Studies 1 and 2 (Studies W-2012086 and W-20120814) 
Two  kinase  inhibition  profiling  studies  (W-20120816  &  W-20120814)  targeting  66  purified  recombinant 
protein  kinases  demonstrated  that  lenvatinib  is  a  potent  multiple  kinase  inhibitor.  IC50  values  were 
determined  by  measuring  the  cell-free  kinase  activities  with  lenvatinib  (0.3  -  10,000  nmol/L)  by  enzyme-
linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  or  mobility  shift  assay  under  optimized condition  for  each  kinase.  The 
profile for sorafenib, another multikinase inhibitor in clinical use, was also studied under the same condition 
as a reference (see table 4).

Kinase Inhibition Profiling Study 3 (Study No. W-20120815) 
A study was also conducted to determine inhibition constants (Ki) for selected kinases (W-20120815). The Ki 
values were calculated using a Dixon Plot of the inhibition by lenvatinib (0.3 – 260 nmol/L) under 6 different 
concentrations of ATP (see table 3).

Table 3. Kinase inhibition profile of lenvatinib against 10 kinases 
Results: 
Lenvatinib  selectively  inhibited  tyrosine  kinase  activities  of  VEGF  receptors  (VEGFR1-3)  and  RET  with  half-
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values below 10 nmol/L (table 4) and inhibition constant (Ki) values 
of approximately 1 nmol/L.  
Secondly, lenvatinib also inhibited other proangiogenic and oncogenic pathway-related RTKs including FGFR1-
4,  PDGFRα,  and  KIT  with  IC50  values  between  10  and  100  nmol/L.  The  Ki  values  were  higher:  respectively 
22, 8.2, 15 and 11 nmol/L for FGFR1, 2 and 3, and KIT. The inhibition mode against these kinases was found 
to be competitive. Ki values for FGFR-4 and PDGFRα were not determined. 
Against  VEGFR1  –  3  and  FGFR1  –  3,  IC50  values  for  lenvatinib  were  several-fold  lower  than  those  of 
sorafenib.  In  particular,  the  IC50  of  lenvatinib  against  FGFR4  was  approximately  80-fold  lower  than  that  of 
sorafenib.  In  contrast,  the  IC50  values  for  lenvatinib  against  PDGFRα,  PDGFRβ  and  RAF1  were  higher  than 
those of sorafenib. In these assays, lenvatinib was more selective to VEGF receptors and FGF receptors and 
less selective to PDGF receptors and RAF1 compared to sorafenib. 
Kinetic Interaction Analysis against VEGFR2 (Study No. W-20140526) 
This  study  determined  the  dissociation  rate  constant  (koff  =  1/  residence  time),  association  rate  constant 
(kon),  and  equilibrium  dissociation  constant  (Kd  =  koff  /  kon)  for  VEGFR2.  These  values  for  the  binding  of 
lenvatinib  and  sorafenib  against  human  recombinant  protein  of  VEGFR2  including  kinase  domain  (Leu834-
Asn1162)  were  measured  using  a  reporter  displacement  assay  (Neumann,  et  al.,  2011).    The  Kd  value  for 
lenvatinib  against  VEGFR2  was  2.1  nmol/L,  which  is  about  16  fold  lower  than  that  of  sorafenib.    This 
difference  is  due  to  the  balance  for  koff  and  kon  values  of  lenvatinib,  which  are  about  3.8-fold  and  60-fold 
higher  than  for  sorafenib,  respectively.  These  results  suggested  that  lenvatinib  dissociated  sooner  from  the 
target, but associated much more rapidly to the active site of VEGFR2, and the overall result was a superior 
binding affinity (based on a lower Kd value) to the target compared to sorafenib.

Crystal Structure of VEGFR2-Lenvatinib Complex (Study No. W-20140522) 
X-ray  analysis  for  the  crystal  structure  of  the  VEGFR2-lenvatinib  complex  showed  that  lenvatinib  binds  to 
both the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site and the neighboring allosteric region in the kinase domain 
adopting an “aspartic acid-phenylalanine-glycine (DFG)-in” configuration, suggesting a different binding mode 
compared to sorafenib. 
The amino acid residues located in the vicinity of lenvatinib or sorafenib with a maximum distance of 3.9 Å 
were  identified  as  those  belonging  to  an  ATP-binding  site  including  a  gate-keeper  residue  (common  site  for 
protein  kinases),  or  the  neighboring  region,  a  non-conserved  allosteric  region  (Traxler  and  Furet,  1999).  
Among  the  total  of  25  amino  acid  residues,  16  residues  were  common  for  lenvatinib  and  sorafenib.  
Lenvatinib  and  sorafenib  binded  to  the  ATP-binding  site  at  their  common  core  from  the  urea  group  to  the 
quinoline  ring  (lenvatinib)  and  pyridine  (sorafenib). They  binded  to  the  neighboring  allosteric  region  via  the 
cyclopropane  ring  (lenvatinib)  or  the  4-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)  phenyl  ring  (sorafenib).    This  suggested  a 
strong hydrophobic interaction between the cyclopropane ring of lenvatinib and the phenyl ring of Phe1047.  
Both  compounds  could  exert  their  kinase  inhibitory  activity  through  binding  to  the  ATP-binding  site,  while 
enhancing  kinase  selectivity  through  binding  to  the  neighboring  region  (Liao,  2007;  Zuccotto,  et  al.,  2010; 
McTigue, et al., 2012). 
Effects  on  VEGF-Driven  VEGFR2  Phosphorylation,  Proliferation,  and  Tube  Formation  in  the  HUVEC  Model 
(Studies M03008, M03006, M03005, W-20100606) 
Four  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  lenvatinib  on  VEGF-driven  cellular  functions  of 
HUVECs,  which  could  be  considered  as  in  vitro  angiogenesis  models,  specifically  VEGFR2  phosphorylation, 
proliferation, and three-dimensional organization for tube formation.  
Lenvatinib  inhibited  VEGF-driven  VEGFR2  phosphorylation,  proliferation,  and  tube  formation  in  the  HUVEC 
model 
in  concentration-dependent  manners 
(IC50HUVECphosphorylation=0.25  nM 
(0.11  ng/ml); 
IC50HUVECproliferation=  3.4  nM  (1.28  ng/ml);  IC50HUVECtube  formation=  2.1  nM  (0.90  ng/ml).  In  the 
fourth  study  (Study  No.  W-20100606)  the  effect  of  lenvatinib  on  HUVEC  proliferation  driven  by  both  VEGF 
(20 ng/mL) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, a MET ligand [30 ng/mL]) was also studied.  Lenvatinib (0.3 
–  300  nmol/L)  showed  a  concentration  dependent,  but  partial  inhibition  (approximately  60%  at  300 
nmol/mL), as predicted by the kinase inhibitory profile in which lenvatinib strongly inhibited VEGFR2 but not 
MET.   
Effects of Lenvatinib Metabolites on VEGF-Driven Proliferation of HUVECs (Study No. M06002) 
Primary  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  lenvatinib  metabolites  M1,  M2,  and  M3  produced  by  liver  microsomes 
were evaluated by measuring the inhibitory effects on VEGF-driven proliferation of HUVECs M1, M2, and M3 
showed  concentration-dependent  antiproliferative  activity,  with  IC50  values  of  57 nmol/L  (95%  confidence 
interval  [CI]:    18 – 180),  250 nmol/L  (95%  CI:    240 – 270)  and  230 nmol/L  (95%  CI:    120 – 440), 
respectively, against the VEGF-driven proliferation of HUVECs, suggesting that VEGFR2 inhibitory activities of 
M1, M2, and M3 were 6%, 1%, and 1%, respectively, of the activity of lenvatinib. 
Effect of Lenvatinib on FGF-Driven Tube Formation of Endothelial Cells (Study No. M14012) 
This  study  examined  the  inhibitory  activity  of  lenvatinib  against  FGF-driven  tube  formation  of  HUVECs.  The 
activity of sorafenib was also evaluated.

Four studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus on VEGF- or 
FGF-driven cellular activities in HUVECs. 
In  the  first  study  (Study  No.  BIOMT-2015-009),  the  effects  of  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  on  VEGF-activated 
intracellular  signaling in  HUVECs  were  examined,  specifically the  phosphorylation  of  Erk1/2  (p44/42  MAPK), 
S6K  (p70  S6  kinase),  and  S6  (S6  ribosomal  protein).  Erk1/2  is  a  signaling  molecule  involved  in  the  MAPK 
pathway  (RAS-RAF-MEK-Erk1/2  pathway)  and  S6K  and  S6  are  signaling  molecules  involved  in  the  mTOR-
S6K-S6 pathway. Both pathways are downstream of RTKs including VEGFR and FGFR.  
Combination  of  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  inhibited  the  phosphorylation  of  Erk1/2(Thr202/Tyr204), 
S6K(Thr389),  S6K(Thr421/Ser424),  and  S6(Ser235/Ser236).  Specifically  in  mTOR-S6K-S6  pathway,  the 
combination showed greater inhibition than each single agent for the phosphorylation of S6K(Thr421/Ser424) 
and  S6(Ser235/Ser236).  S6K(Thr389)  directly  downstream  of  the  mTOR  complex  was  already  maximally 
inhibited by everolimus 
In the second study (Study No. BIOMT-2015-010), the effects of lenvatinib and everolimus on FGF-activated 
intracellular  signaling  in  HUVECs  were  examined;  specifically  the  phosphorylation  of  Erk1/2,  S6K,  and  S6 
were evaluated.  
The  combination  of  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  also  inhibited  the  phosphorylation  of  Erk1/2(Thr202/Tyr204), 
S6K(Thr389), S6K(Thr421/Ser424), and S6(Ser235/Ser236). The combination showed greater inhibition than 
each  single  agent  for  the  phosphorylation  of  S6K(Thr421/Ser424)  and  S6(Ser235/Ser236),  similar  to  what 
was observed with VEGFstimulated phosphorylation. 
In  the  third  study  (Study  No.  M15015),  the  effects  of  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  everolimus  on  VEGF-
driven proliferation of HUVECs were examined. Dilutions of lenvatinib mesilate alone, everolimus alone, and 
their mixtures (molar ratios of 2.5:1, 5:1, 10:1, and 20:1 (lenvatinib: everolimus)), were added to HUVECs 
on tissue culture plates.  
The combination of lenvatinib and everolimus at the different molar ratios resulted in combination indexes of 
0.80, 1.11, 1.12, and 1.17, respectively, indicating moderate synergistic or additive effects.  
In  the  fourth  study  (Study  No.  M15016),  the  effects  of  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  everolimus  on  FGF-
driven  tube  formation  of  HUVECs  were  evaluated.  Dilutions  of  lenvatinib  alone,  everolimus  alone,  and  their 
mixtures with molar ratios of 1:4, 1:8, 1:12, and 1:16 (lenvatinib : everolimus) were added to HUVECs.  
The combination of lenvatinib and everolimus resulted in combination indexes of 0.47, 0.56, 0.61, and 0.74, 
respectively, indicating synergistic or moderate synergistic effects.  
Direct Anti-proliferative Activities against Cancer Cells 
Two studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of lenvatinib on in vitro proliferation of human cancer cell 
lines. Lenvatinib exhibited weak, direct anti-proliferative activity in vitro against the H460 human non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Colo205 human colorectal cancer cell lines, with IC50 values of 14.000 and 
26.000 nmol/L (~ 7321 ng/ml and 13597 ng/ml), respectively (Study No. M03007). 
In  a  second  study,  lenvatinib  exhibited  a  weak  anti-proliferative  activity  against  the  A-498  human  RCC  cell 
line  with  an  IC50  value  above  10,000  nmol/L,  while  everolimus  inhibited  the  growth  of  A-498  cells  with  an 
IC50 value of 4.6 nmol/L (95% CI: 2.4 – 8.7) (Study No. M15005).

In vivo studies 
The inhibitory activity of lenvatinib was evaluated in an in vivo angiogenesis model and the antitumor activity 
of lenvatinib as monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer agents was evaluated in various human 
tumor xenograft models in athymic mice.  
Antiangiogenesis activity of lenvatinib in VEGF- and FGF-induced angiogenesis model in mice (DAS Model)  
This  study  examined  the  inhibitory  activity  of  lenvatinib  against  VEGF-  or  FGF-induced  angiogenesis  in  a 
murine DAS model (Yamamoto, et al., 2014). The activity of sorafenib was also evaluated. Recombinant KP-1 
human  pancreatic  cancer  cells  expressing  human  VEGF  or  murine  FGF  (KP-1/VEGF  cells  or  KP-1/FGF  cells) 
were packed in Millipore chambers with collagen gels, and the chambers were embedded in dorsal air sacs of 
C57BL/6  mice  (Day  1)  in  order  to  induce  angiogenesis  in  the  skin  attached  to  the  chamber  membrane 
(Funahashi,  et  al.,  1999).  Then,  vehicle  for  lenvatinib  (distilled  water),  lenvatinib  mesilate  (3,  10,  and  30 
mg/kg) or sorafenib tosylate (100 and 300 mg/kg) was orally administered to the mice (3 – 5/group) once 
daily  for  4  days  (Day  1  – 4).  Angiogenesis  was  evaluated  on  Day  5  by  measuring  the  pre-radiolabelled red 
blood  cell  content  in  the  skin  attached  to  the  chamber  membrane,  and  treatment/  control  (T/C)  (%)  was 
calculated.  
Angiogenesis was markedly induced in the skin of mice bearing the Millipore chamber with KP-1/VEGF or KP-
1/FGF cells compared to those bearing the Millipore chamber with KP-1 mock cells (mock-transfected cells) or 
collagen only, demonstrating that in vivo angiogenesis was induced by VEGF or FGF secreted from the tumor 
cells.  In  this  model,  lenvatinib  at  doses  of  10  and  30  mg/kg  significantly  inhibited  both  VEGF-  and  FGF-
induced  in  vivo  angiogenesis.  Sorafenib  (100  and  300  mg/kg)  also  significantly  inhibited  the  VEGFinduced 
angiogenesis, but did not inhibit the FGF-induced angiogenesis. 
Effects of Lenvatinib on Plasma FGF23 Levels in Mice  
FGF23, a protein hormone regulating mineral metabolism, is a potential pharmacodynamics marker for FGFR 
inhibition  in  vivo,  since  its  plasma  level  is  elevated  as  a  compensatory  response  when  intracellular  FGFR 
signaling is blocked (Wöhrle, et al., 2011; Kim, et al., 2011). This study examined the effect of lenvatinib on 
plasma FGF23 levels in mice in order to obtain evidence for FGFR inhibition in vivo (Study No. W-20140842). 
Sorafenib  was  also  evaluated.    Seven-week-old  female  non-tumor-bearing  BALB/c  mice  (8/group)  were 
administered  a  single  oral  dose  of  the  vehicle  for  lenvatinib  (distilled  water),  lenvatinib  mesilate  (3  and  10 
mg/kg),  or  sorafenib  tosylate  (9  and  30  mg/kg).  Twenty-four  hours  after  dosing,  blood  was  collected  from 
the abdominal aorta and the concentration of FGF23 in the plasma fraction was measured by ELISA. 
The  plasma  FGF23  concentration  increased  dose-dependently  in  mice  treated  with  lenvatinib,  with  a 
significant  increase  confirmed  at  a  dose  of  10  mg/kg  compared  to  the  vehicle-control  group;  no  significant 
increase in FGF23 concentration associated with treatment with sorafenib was observed. The result provides 
evidence  that  lenvatinib  is  able  to  inhibit  the  FGFR  signaling  pathway  in  mice,  whereas  sorafenib  does  not 
show such activity. 
Combination therapy with everolimus  
Antitumor Effects of Lenvatinib in Combination With Everolimus in the A-498 Human RCC Xenograft Model in 
Athymic Mice 
The  antitumor  effects  of  lenvatinib,  everolimus,  and  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  everolimus,  were 
evaluated in the A-498 human RCC xenograft model in athymic mice (Study No. M14026). 
Assessment report

A-498  cells  were  inoculated  subcutaneously  into  8-week-old  female  mice.  At  21  days  after  inoculation, 
vehicle,  lenvatinib  mesilate  (10  mg/kg),  everolimus  (30  mg/kg),  or  lenvatinib  mesilate  in  combination  with 
everolimus were orally administered to the mice (10/group) once daily for 14 days (Day 1 – 14). The TV and 
body weight were measured twice a week. 
Lenvatinib  monotherapy,  everolimus  monotherapy,  and  the  combination  of  the  2  agents  showed  significant 
inhibition of tumor growth compared to vehicle control with T/C values of 26%, 0%, and –20% on Day 15, 
respectively.  The  combination  resulted  in  growth  inhibition  with  tumor  shrinkage,  which  was  significantly 
greater than that for each monotherapy.  
Antitumor Effects of Lenvatinib in Combination With Everolimus in the Caki-1 Human RCC Xenograft Model in 
Athymic Mice 
The  antitumor  effects  of  lenvatinib,  everolimus,  and  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  everolimus,  were 
evaluated in the Caki-1 human RCC xenograft model in athymic mice (Study No. W-20110629).   
Caki-1 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into 7-week-old female mice. At 48 days after inoculation (Day 
1),  vehicle,  lenvatinib  mesilate  (10  mg/kg),  everolimus  (30  mg/kg),  or  lenvatinib  mesilate  in  combination 
with everolimus were orally administered to the mice (5/group) once daily for 14 days (Day 1 – 14). 
The  TV  and  body  weight  were  measured  twice  a  week.  The  TV  was  calculated  according  to  the  formula: 
length × width2 × ½, and described as the RTV compared with that on Day 1. 
Lenvatinib  monotherapy,  everolimus  monotherapy,  and  the  combination  of  the  2  agents  showed  significant 
inhibition  of  tumor  growth  compared  to  vehicle  control  with  T/C  values  of  2%,  –23%,  and  –86%, 
respectively,  on  Day  15.  The  combination  resulted  in  tumor  shrinkage,  and  the  antitumor  activity  was 
significantly  greater  than  that  for  lenvatinib  monotherapy.  It  was  also  numerically  greater  than  that  for 
everolimus monotherapy, but the difference was not significant (P=0.0683).  
Antitumor Effects of Lenvatinib in Combination With Everolimus in the KP-1/VEGF Xenograft Model in Athymic 
Mice 
The  antitumor  effects  of  lenvatinib,  everolimus,  and  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  everolimus,  were 
evaluated  in  the  KP-1/VEGF  xenograft  model  in  athymic  mice  (Study  No.  M15012),  where  VEGF-induced 
tumor  angiogenesis  and  resulting  tumor  growth  were  expected  to  be  enhanced  due  to  the  excess  VEGF 
secreted  from the  recombinant  KP-1/VEGF  cells  (Yamamoto,  et  al.,  2014).  KP-1/VEGF  cells  were  inoculated 
subcutaneously  into  6-week-old  female  mice.  At  14  days  after  inoculation,  vehicle,  lenvatinib  mesilate  (7.5 
and  10  mg/kg),  everolimus  (15  and  30  mg/kg),  or  lenvatinib  mesilate  (7.5  mg/kg)  in  combination  with 
everolimus  (15  mg/kg)  were  orally  administered  to  the  mice  (5/group)  once  daily  for  14  days.  The  TV  and 
body weight were measured twice a week.  
Lenvatinib  monotherapy,  everolimus  monotherapy,  and  their  combination  showed  significant  inhibition  of 
tumor  growth  compared  to  vehicle  control  on  Day  15.  The  combination  of  lenvatinib  mesilate  (7.5  mg/kg) 
and  everolimus  (15  mg/kg)  showed  significantly  greater  antitumor  effect  than  either  monotherapy.  The 
antitumor  effect  of  the  combination  was  also  significantly  greater  than  with  the  higher  dose  of  either 
lenvatinib mesilate (10 mg/kg) or everolimus (30 mg/kg) monotherapy.  
Combination therapy with other compounds 
• Combination of lenvatinib with:  
o 
temozolomide  (TMZ)  (Study  No  K08038)  or  eribulin  (Study  No  JW1012)  in  the  A375  melanoma 
xenograft model,

cisplatin or carboplatin in the A549 NSCLC xenograft model (Study No K06053),  
o 
o  paclitaxel in the MKN-74 gastric cancer xenograft model (Study No K06008), and  
o  golvatinib in the SEKI melanoma, KP-4 pancreatic cancer, IM95m gastric cancer, and A2780 ovarian 
cancer (Study No W-20100607) 
o  human  xenograft  models  in  athymic  mice  showed  greater  antitumor  effects  as  compared  with  each 
monotherapy.  
• Tumor  regression  has  occurred  for  the  combination  of  lenvatinib  with  eribulin,  ciplatin/carboplatin  and 
golvatinib: 
- The combination of lenvatinib with eribulin (3.0 mg/kg, Q7D×2) showed greater antitumor effects than the 
monotherapy, which resulted in tumor regression. 
-  The  antitumor  effects  of  the  combinations  of  lenvatinib  with  carboplatin  were  of  similar  magnitude  to  the 
combination  with  cisplatin.  The  effects  were  greater  than  each  monotherapy,  although  not  statistically 
significantly different from the lenvatinib monotherapy. Tumor regression was observed in the combinations 
of lenvatinib (10 and 30 mg/kg) with cisplatin and lenvatinib (10 mg/kg) with carboplatin. 
- Golvatinib (an investigational multiple kinase inhibitor) is a potent inhibitor of MET, while lenvatinib showed 
little  inhibitory  activity  against  MET.  The  combination  of  lenvatinib  and  golvatinib  showed  significant  and 
greater  inhibition  of  tumor  growth  as  compared  to  each  monotherapy.  Regression  of  IM95m  tumors  was 
observed in mice treated with the combination. 
• Body weight loss 
- Lenvatinib (10, 30 mg/kg) weakly enhanced the transient BWL caused by TMZ (80 mg/kg). 
- When given in combination with 3.0 mg/kg eribulin (QD×7), lenvatinib weakly enhanced the BWL caused by 
eribulin. 
-  Lenvatinib  (10  and  30  mg/kg)  enhanced  the  transient  BWL  caused  by  carboplatin.  The  combination  of 
lenvatinib (30 mg/kg) with carboplatin (100 mg/kg) was lethal in this model. 
- Lenvatinib at each dose weakly enhanced the transient BWL caused by paclitaxel. 
-  In  the  SEKI  and  A2780  xenograft  models  for  golvatinib  where  BWL  was  observed  in  the  vehicle  group 
(attributed to tumor burden), lenvatinib had no effect on, or weakly enhanced, this BWL.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
To evaluate the potential secondary pharmacodynamic effects of lenvatinib, the binding of lenvatinib (1 and 
10  μmol/L)  to  a  panel  of 50  non-kinase  receptors  (ExpresSProfile)  known  to  play  significant  biological roles 
was  determined.  With  the  exception  of  binding  to  the  5-hydroxytryptamine  (serotonin)  receptor  1B  (58%) 
and human norepinephrine (noradrenalin) transporter (50%) at 10 μmol/L (5.2 µg/ml), no significant binding 
(greater  than  50%  inhibition)  of  lenvatinib  to  any  of  the  50  receptors  was  observed  at  the  tested 
concentrations. These are not considered relevant at human therapeutic dose levels. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology of lenvatinib was evaluated in in vitro and in vivo studies.

Central Nervous system 
Effects of lenvatinib on general physical condition and behavior were evaluated in SD rats after a single oral 
administration of lenvatinib mesilate at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg using Irwin’s method (Study No. B030401). 
Lenvatinib, up to 100 mg/kg, showed no effect on general physical condition and behavior in rats. 
The effects of a single oral dose of lenvatinib mesilate (6 and 30 mg/kg) on body temperature were assessed 
in beagle dogs (Study No. B030402). Lenvatinib did not cause body temperature changes at any dose in 
dogs. 
Cardiovascular system 
Two in vitro electrophysiology studies were conducted to assess the effect of lenvatinib on hERG tail current 
or action potential parameters (Study Nos. DJNR1029 and B030403). No significant adverse effects were 
observed in these studies except for a weak inhibitory effect on hERG potassium current (IC50 = 11.89 
μmol/L). The effects of a single oral dose of lenvatinib mesilate (6 and 30 mg/kg) on heart rate, mean blood 
pressure, and ECG (PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval) were assessed in beagle dogs (Study No. 
B030402). Lenvatinib at doses up to 30 mg/kg had no significant effect on heart rate, mean blood pressure, 
or ECG (including QT) except for a minimal increase in mean blood pressure within the normal biologic range. 
Respiratory System 
The effects of a single oral dose of lenvatinib mesilate (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg) on respiratory function 
(respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute volume) in SD rats were evaluated using unrestrained whole body 
plethysmography (Study No. S03019). Lenvatinib at doses up to 100 mg/kg showed no effects on respiratory 
rate, tidal volume, or minute volume in rats. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted. In vivo xenograft studies of lenvatinib in 
combination with other anticancer agents that evaluate pharmacodynamic interactions were conducted 
(please see in vivo pharmacology studies above).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of lenvatinib was evaluated by in vivo studies with athymic mice (BALB/c AnNCrj-
nu/nu), Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. The strains and species 
evaluated were those used in pharmacology and toxicity studies. For assessments of metabolic 
characteristics, in vitro studies using hepatocytes, recombinant metabolic enzymes, liver microsomes or other 
subcellular fractions of the liver were also conducted. 
Method 
A method using HPLC with UV detection was validated for quantification of lenvatinib in plasma samples of 
mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. In these validation studies, plasma concentration of lenvatinib 
was expressed in terms of the mesilate salt.  Radiolabeled lenvatinib mesilate ([14C] lenvatinib mesilate and 
[14C]CB-lenvatinib mesilate) were synthesized to conduct mass balance and metabolite identification studies. 
The concentration of radioactivity derived from carbon 14 in the blood, plasma, tissues, urine, bile, and 
faeces was determined by LSC with external standard method.  The concentration of radioactivity was 
expressed as the equivalent of lenvatinib mesilate (µg eq./mL or g). 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetic profiles of lenvatinib in mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys were characterized 
by a low total plasma clearance (100.2 – 368.3 mL/h/kg) and a small to moderate volume of distribution 
(391.5 – 1610.0 mL/kg). The terminal elimination phase half-life after intravenous administration was 2.05 to 
5.27 hours. After oral administration of lenvatinib mesilate at 3 mg/kg as a solution, lenvatinib was absorbed 
rapidly and had absolute bioavailability in mice (64.4%), rats (68.7%), dogs (70.4%), and monkeys 
(78.4%).

Doses and plasma concentrations for lenvatinib were expressed as those of the mesilate salt, and related 
parameters were calculated.  In mice, each parameter except t max was calculated with the average concentration 
of 3 animals, and in other species, each value except tmax represents the mean of 4 animals.  The tmax represents 
the mode value, except for mice.  F was calculated using the formula: AUC (0-inf) in oral dosing / AUC (0-inf) in 
intravenous dosing × 100. 
AUC (0-inf) = area under the concentration-time curve from zero time extrapolated to infinite time, CL p = total 
plasma clearance, C max = maximum observed concentration, F = absolute bioavailability, IV = intravenous, NA = 
not applicable, NC = not calculated, PO = oral, SD = Sprague Dawley, t 1/2 = terminal elimination phase half-life, 
t max = time at which the highest drug concentration occurs, V ss = volume of distribution at steady state. 
a:  Lenvatinib mesilate was administered as solution in all administration groups. 
b:  Concentration at 5 minutes for intravenous dosing. 
Source:  Study Nos. B03014 (mouse), B03015 (rat), B03016 (dog), and B04003 (monkey). 
Overall, repeated-dose toxicokinetic studies of lenvatinib in male and female rats, dogs, and cynomolgus 
monkeys conducted with once daily oral doses for up to 26, 4, and 39 weeks, respectively, indicated no 
systemic accumulation of lenvatinib in the toxicology studies.  Systemic exposures in males and females were 
generally comparable in each species. With the exception of rats, systemic exposure of lenvatinib was not 
affected by repeated administration in these species. In dogs at doses < 30 mg/kg, the systemic exposure 
generally increased in a dose-proportional manner. The systemic exposure increased in a less than dose-
proportional manner at higher dose levels in rats (>10 mg/kg). In contrast, in monkeys, systemic exposure

increased in a more than a dose-proportional manner at low dose levels (0.1 – 3 mg/kg). Unlike the rat or 
the monkey, the systemic exposure in humans increased in a dose-proportional manner (see clinical 
pharmacokinetics section). 
Distribution 
Tissue distribution of radioactivity was investigated after a single oral administration of 14C-lenvatinib 
mesilate (3 mg/kg) to male SD rats and male cynomolgus monkeys and after a single oral administration of 
14C-CB-lenvatinib mesilate (3 mg/kg) to male cynomolgus monkeys. 
In rats, the highest concentrations of radioactivity were found at 0.5 hours postdose (Tmax) in most tissues 
(the small intestine, liver, adrenal gland, and stomach showed concentrations 1.19 to 2.59 times higher than 
that in plasma), and decreased almost in parallel with that in blood. Elimination half-life was 1.9 days. 
In monkeys, the highest concentrations of 14C-lenvatinib-radioactivity were found at 4 hours postdose 
(Tmax) in the bile in gall bladder, being 556.73 times that in the plasma. The mean concentrations of 
radioactivity in the urine in bladder, gall bladder, liver, choroid, ciliary body, and renal cortex were next 
highest, being 57.85-10.11 times that in the plasma. At 24 hr postdose, the choroid, iris, large intestine, 
sclera, cornea, and lens reached their maxima.  
The mean concentrations of radioactivity in many tissues decreased almost in parallel with that in the 
plasma. Elimination half-life was 3.43 days. 
In monkeys, the highest concentrations of 14C-CB-lenvatinib-radioactivity were found at 2 hours postdose 
(Tmax). The radioactive concentrations in the bile in gall bladder and urine in bladder were the highest, being 
33.59 and 24.55 times those in the plasma, respectively. The radioactive concentrations in the choroid and 
liver were the next highest, being 7.14 and 7.02 times those in the plasma, respectively. The radioactive 
concentrations in the gall bladder, iris, renal cortex, kidney, ciliary body, renal medulla, and lung were 3.28 
to 1.49 times those in the plasma. The radioactive concentration in the central nervous system was 0.07 time 
or lower than that in the plasma. Elimination half-life was 3.70 days. 
Protein Binding and Distribution in Blood Cells 
To clarify the nature of covalently-bound lenvatinib-related material with human plasma proteins and to 
evaluate its reversibility, the effect of the nucleophiles GSH and cysteine was examined.  Covalent binding of 
lenvatinib to human plasma protein occurred in vitro, and GSH and cysteine successfully released lenvatinib-
related components bound to plasma protein as conjugates in the same manner as the 2-ME conjugates in 
previous studies (E7080 E044 104 and AE-6748-G).  Since abundant amounts of GSH and cysteine exist in 
humans, the covalent binding observed in human plasma is expected to be reversible in vivo. 
The plasma protein binding of lenvatinib mesilate (0.3 to 30 μg/mL) in athymic mice, SD rats, beagle dogs, 
cynomolgus monkeys, and humans was determined by equilibrium dialysis in vitro (Study No. B09009). 
Incubation was conducted for 72 hours at 37 °C. Among the species tested, lenvatinib exhibited the highest 
plasma protein binding in human, independent of concentrations (97.87% to 98.62%), followed by rat 
(97.70% to 98.20%), athymic mouse (96.28% to 96.92%), monkey (95.90% to 96.17%), and dog (89.71% 
to 91.75%). 
To assess the specific proteins that bind lenvatinib in human plasma, protein binding of lenvatinib mesilate 
(0.3 to 30 μg/mL) to albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and γ-globulin was determined by equilibrium dialysis in 
vitro (Study No. B09011). Lenvatinib mainly bound to albumin, and the contribution of α1-acid glycoprotein 
and γ-globulin to lenvatinib protein binding was minor in human plasma. Based on the results at the lowest 
Assessment report

lenvatinib mesilate concentration tested (0.3 μg/mL), the contributions of albumin, α1-acid glycoprotein, and 
γ-globulin to the human plasma protein binding of lenvatinib were estimated to be 93.2%, 6.1%, and 0.7%, 
respectively. 
Blood to plasma concentration ratios (Rb) of 14C-lenvatinib mesilate (0.1 to 10 μg/mL) in athymic mice, SD 
rats, beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans were determined in vitro after a 30-minute incubation 
at 37 °C. A species difference in the Rb of 14C-lenvatinib was observed, and ranked from highest to lowest 
as follows: dog > monkey = mouse ≥  rat > human. The Rb values in animals declined with increasing 
concentration; however, in human, the Rb was constant between 0.1 and 10 μg/mL. 
The in vitro transfer ratios of 14C-lenvatinib mesilate to blood cell were 23.1%, 22.1%, and 18.8% in the 
mouse; 8.86%, 7.59%, and 4.36% in the rat; 51.4%, 44.3%, and 42.1% in the dog; 29.7%, 21.9%, and 
18.3% in the monkey; and 17.2%, 14.5%, and 14.8% in the human at the spiked 14C- lenvatinib mesilate 
blood concentration of 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/mL, respectively. 
As for the stability of 14C-lenvatinib mesilate in the blood, the radiochemical purity declined in the dog blood. 
The decreased rate was low as approximately 10%, but taking account of dog showing higher Rb than other 
species, it could not be fully excluded that decomposed 14C-lenvatinib mesilate in dog blood may be 
distributed to blood cells more than unchanged 14C-E7080. 
Placental transfer studies 
Placental transfer was investigated after a single oral administration of 14C-lenvatinib mesilate (3 mg/kg) to 
pregnant rats (Study No. AE-6750-G). On Days 13 and 18 of pregnancy, the concentrations of radioactivity in 
fetuses were low, and were 2% or less of the concentration in maternal plasma at 0.5 hours post-dose, the 
first sampling time point. The distribution of radioactivity for each foetus was 0.02% or less of the dosed 
radioactivity.  
Placental transfer of lenvatinib mesilate in rats (on day 13 and 18 of pregnancy) was low (2% or less of the 
concentration in maternal plasma). 
Metabolism 
The  applivant  demonstrated  that  no  glutathione  metabolites  with  the  quinolone  form  were  identified  in  the 
monkey or human studies and that exposure is likely to be very low in humans. In addition, the levels of the 
aniline  metabolite  are  low  and  probably  similar  to  those  seen  for  other  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors.  This  was 
raised during the review of Lenvima. 
In vitro and in vivo studies using lenvatinib, [14C] lenvatinib, or [14C]CB-lenvatinib were conducted to 
determine the metabolic profile of lenvatinib. 
Lenvatinib mesilate (final concentration: 10 μg/mL) was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes in mouse, rat, dog, 
monkey, and human liver microsomes (protein concentration: 1 mg/mL) with or without the reduced form of 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), and the reaction mixtures were analyzed by liquid 
chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to investigate the in vitro metabolism of lenvatinib 
(Study No. B03025). 
8 metabolites (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6, M7, and M8) were detected in at least one animal species as well as 
in human liver microsomes. M1, M2, and M3 were identified as decyclopropylated, demethylated, and N-
oxidated forms of lenvatinib, respectively. M1 could be a chemical (or non-enzymatic) degradation product, 
as M1 was detected in lenvatinib solution and in the incubation mixtures without microsomes or NADPH. M4

was proposed as a hydroxylated form at the cyclopropyl group of lenvatinib, M5 was proposed as the 
quinoline form, formed by O-dearylation, M6 was proposed as a form hydroxylated at the cyclopropyl group 
of M2, M7 was proposed as a form doubly hydroxylated at cyclopropyl group, and M8 was proposed as the N-
oxidated form of M2. 
Six metabolites (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M7) were common among the species tested. M6 and M8 were 
detected in monkey and human liver microsomes but not in mouse, rat, and dog liver microsomes. In the 
human liver microsomes, M2 appeared to be a major metabolite. All metabolites in human liver microsomes 
were also qualitatively represented in monkey liver microsomes. Six metabolites out of eight (M1, M2, M3, 
M4, M5, and M7) were also detected in rat liver microsomes.  
To determine the CYP-mediated metabolism of lenvatinib in humans in vitro, lenvatinib was incubated with 
recombinant human CYPs. CYP3A4 was the predominant (≥ 80%) isoform contributing to the CYP-dependent 
metabolism of lenvatinib in humans in vitro over the concentration range of 0.005 to 10 µg/mL, followed by 
CYP1A2 (2.4% to 7.6%) and CYP2B6 (3.0% to 6.7%). To further evaluate CYP isoforms responsible for the 
CYP dependent metabolism of lenvatinib, the effects of CYP isoform-specific inhibitors on lenvatinib 
metabolism were also assessed in HLMs. The results obtained further showed that CYP3A4 was a major CYP 
isoform involved in the CYP-dependent metabolism of lenvatinib in HLM. 
In addition, aldehyde oxidase (AO) contributes to the formation of M2´ and M3’, the major metabolites in 
human feces. 
To clarify the metabolic profiles of lenvatinib in vivo, the metabolites after oral administration of 
[14C]lenvatinib mesilate to rats and a single monkey at 30 mg/kg were investigated (Study No. B10006). In 
this study, 36 radioactive components in total were found in rat and monkey samples, and were assigned 
serial numbers with the prefix “Met” (Met 1 to Met 36). Based on comparisons of retention times and mass 
spectral data with the corresponding references, Met 14 (me37), Met 28 (me88), Met 32-1 (me107), Met 33 
(me114), and Met 35 (me116) were identified as M5, M1, M3, M2, and lenvatinib, respectively.  
In addition to oxidative metabolism, one of the major metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in the rat and 
monkey appeared to be glutathione conjugation at the quinoline moiety, and 15 glutathione conjugation-
related metabolites including Met 12 (me36) and Met 15 (me40) were detected in this study. 
Three metabolites were isolated from monkey urine samples, and their chemical structures were determined 
by NMR to be Met 13 (me33) further oxidized from Met 12 (me36), Met 16 (me45) dimerized of Met 21 
(me47), and Met 20 (me49) conjugated from Met 21 (me47) and Met 19-2 (me44) forming disulfide, 
respectively (Study No. C10320). 
The metabolic profiles of lenvatinib were further investigated following single oral administrations of 
[14C]lenvatinib mesilate to male rats and monkeys at 3 mg/kg (Study No. AE-6748-G). Plasma, liver, kidney, 
urine, feces, and bile were collected and subjected to metabolite analyses using LC/MS(MSn). In this study, 
41 radioactive peaks on HPLC radiochromatograms were found in rat and monkey samples, and the 
metabolites were assigned serial numbers with the prefix “m” (m1 to m41). 
In these in vivo studies, the presence of the oxidized human metabolites, M1 (me88), M2 (me114), M3 
(me107), M5 (me37), M2´(me118), and M3´(me115) were confirmed by LC/MS analysis of rat or monkey 
samples after single oral administrations of lenvatinib. An additional study was conducted to clarify the 
metabolic profile of lenvatinib in monkeys using 14C-labeled lenvatinib radio-labeled on the chlorobenzene 
moiety. After a single oral dose of 14C-CB-lenvatinib at 3 mg/kg to cynomolgus monkeys, radioactive 
components in biological samples were analyzed. More than 90% of plasma radioactivity was extracted with

methanol, and major component in plasma was lenvatinib. Unchanged lenvatinib was found in bile and feces 
but not in urine. The main primary metabolic pathway of lenvatinib was indicated to be the cleavage of O-aryl 
bond to form mCB31 (ER-236273), and further biotransformations of mCB31 (conjugate with glucuronic acid, 
sulfuric acid, glutathione, and N-acetyl glucosamine with or without hydroxylation) were confirmed, resulted 
in forming many kinds of metabolites. 
Study DMPKT2013-017 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  total  radioactivity,  extracted  radioactivity,  radioactive  peaks  including 
lenvatinib,  and  unextracted  radioactivity  in  monkey  plasma  obtained  in  Study  Nos.  AE-6748-G,  AE-6917-G, 
and  AE-6918-G  were  calculated.  Lenvatinib  was  the  main  fraction  of  total  radioactivity  in  plasma  after 
administration  of  both  [14C]lenvatinib  mesilate  (Cmax:  89.9%,  AUC(0-inf):  69.7%)  and  [14C]CB-lenvatinib 
mesilate (Cmax: 78.4%, AUC(0-inf): 60.4%).  After administration of [14C]lenvatinib mesilate, Cmax and AUC(0-
inf)  of  all  radioactive  metabolite  peaks  did  not  exceed  1.9%  of  the  total  radioactivity  values.    After 
administration  of  [14C]CB-lenvatinib  mesilate,  mCB9a  was  the  major  radioactive  metabolite,  with  Cmax  and 
AUC(0-inf)  values  that  were  12.1%  and  17.0%  of  the  total  radioactivity  values,  respectively.    mCB9a  is 
equivalent  to  me50  (i.e.  glucuronide  of  me92).  With  the  exception  of  mCB9a,  Cmax  and  AUC(0-inf)  of  all 
radioactive  metabolite  peaks  detected  after  administration  of  [14C]CB-lenvatinib  mesilate  did  not  exceed 
4.7%  of  total  radioactivity.    Cmax  and  AUC(0-inf)  of  unextracted  radioactivity  after  administration  of  [14C]CB-
lenvatinib  mesilate  were  0.5%  and  2.6%  of  the  total  radioactivity,  respectively,  and  were  lower  than  those 
after administration of [14C]lenvatinib mesilate (Cmax: 7.3%, AUC(0-inf): 22.6%). 
Study W-20140601 
In  the  monkey  study,  methanol  was  unable  to  extract  the  entire  radioactivity  in  plasma  protein.    This  was 
likely  due  to  covalent  binding  of  [14C]lenvatinib.  Treatment  with  nucleophilic  2-mercaptoethanol  (2-ME) 
recovered additional radioactivity from the modified plasma protein which likely included conjugates between 
2-ME and the quinoline moiety of lenvatinib. In the human mass balance study, incorporation of radioactivity 
originating  from  [14C]lenvatinib  to  plasma  protein,  possibly  due  to  covalent  binding  was  also  observed.    To 
clarify the nature of covalently-bound lenvatinib-related material with human plasma proteins and to evaluate 
its reversibility, the effect of the nucleophiles GSH and cysteine was examined. Covalent binding of lenvatinib 
to  human  plasma  protein  occurred  in  vitro,  and  GSH  and  cysteine  successfully  released  lenvatinib-related 
components bound to plasma protein as conjugates in the same manner as the 2-ME conjugates in previous 
studies (E7080-E044-104 and AE-6748-G).  Since abundant amounts of GSH  and cysteine exist in humans, 
the covalent binding observed in human plasma is expected to be reversible in vivo. 
Excretion 
After oral administration of [14C] lenvatinib mesilate to rats and cynomolgus monkeys or [14C]CB-lenvatinib 
mesilate to monkeys, greater than or equal to 90% of the radioactive dose was recovered in the excreta by 
168 hours post-dose. In rats, fecal excretion via bile was the main route of excretion, while in monkeys fecal 
and urinary excretion was a major excretion route of radioactivity after dosing of [14C]lenvatinib mesilate 
and [14C]CB-lenvatinib mesilate, respectively. These results indicated that metabolites derived from the 
quinoline moiety were excreted mainly in the feces, and those from the chlorobenzyl moiety were excreted 
primarily in the urine.

Table 6: Excretion of radioactivity after a single oral administration of lenvatinib to male rats and monkeys 
The excretion of radioactivity into milk was investigated after a single oral administration of 3 mg/kg 
[14C]lenvatinib mesilate to lactating SD rats (Study No. AE-6750-G). The concentration of radioactivity in 
milk was higher than that in plasma, indicating a relatively high transfer of lenvatinib into milk. However, the 
concentration of radioactivity in milk decreased rapidly with a similar time profile as that in plasma, 
suggesting no tendency for lenvatinib to remain in milk for a long period. 
Pharmacokinetics drug interactions 
Protein binding of lenvatinib in human liver microsomes solution was evaluated using an equilibrium dialysis 
method. The percentages of protein binding of lenvatinib in the human liver microsomes sample (1 mg 
protein/mL) at 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μg/mL lenvatinib mesilate were 29.24±0.91%, 26.93±1.26%, 
25.49±0.21%, 24.53±0.52%, and 23.85±1.06%, respectively. The mean unbound fraction in the study at 1 
mg/mL microsomal protein was 0.74, and DDI simulation using Simcyp was re-evaluated using this value. 
The induction of CYPs, UGTs, and P-gp by lenvatinib was evaluated in vitro (Study Nos. XT063020 and 
XT103078). Treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with up to 3 μmol/L lenvatinib had a tendency to 
slightly increase CYP3A but had no effect on CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and P gp did not induce CYP2B6, 
UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 enzyme activities or mRNA expressions.  
Additionally, the inhibition of CYPs and UGTs by lenvatinib was studied in vitro (Study Nos. B03023, PK-Test-
0072, PK-Test-0040, PK-Test-0079, and XT105084). Lenvatinib mesilate (100 µmol/L) weakly inhibited the 
activities of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6. Lenvatinib showed virtually no inhibitory effects on 
CYP2A6 and CYP2E1. Lenvatinib exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 (IC50 = 10.1 µmol/L) and a 
weak inhibitory effect on CYP3A (IC50: approximately 100 µmol/L) in human liver microsomes. 
The potential inhibitory activity of lenvatinib mesilate (0.03 to 30 μmol/L) on UGTs (UGT1A1, UGT1A4, 
UGT1A6, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7) was assessed in HLM using UGT isoform specific substrates. Lenvatinib 
inhibited UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 with IC50 values of 10.6 and 14.0 μmol/L, respectively.  Lenvatinib weakly 
inhibited UGT1A9, with 31.9% inhibition observed at 30 μmol/L; however, the IC50 value for this enzyme 
was greater than 30.0 μmol/L.  There was little or no evidence of inhibition of UGT1A6 and UGT2B7 by 
lenvatinib. 
A series of in vitro studies was conducted to assess the substrate recognition and inhibitory activity of 
lenvatinib on the known human transporters, including P-gp, BCRP, OATPs, OATs, OCTs, and BSEP.

The roles of P-gp in mediating the membrane permeability of [14C]lenvatinib and the potential inhibition of 
P-gp-mediated [3H]digoxin transport by lenvatinib were assessed using human P-gp expressing and control 
LLC-PK1 cell monolayers (Study No. GE-0556-G). These results demonstrated that lenvatinib was a substrate 
for P-gp. Lenvatinib weakly inhibited P-gp-mediated transport, and the IC50 for the inhibition of [3H]digoxin 
transport mediated by P-gp was estimated to be more than 30 μmol/L. 
The potential of [14C]lenvatinib to serve as a substrate for BCRP and the potential inhibition of BCRP-
mediated [3H]prazosin transport by lenvatinib were assessed using human BCRP expressing and control LLC-
PK1 cell monolayers (Study No. GE-0791-G). In this study, it was shown that lenvatinib was a BCRP 
substrate and it weakly inhibited BCRP-mediated transport (IC50 > 30 µmol/L). 
To assess whether lenvatinib is a substrate or inhibitor for OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, the 
transport of lenvatinib and inhibition of the various transporters by lenvatinib were examined using specific 
transporter expressing cells (Study No. GE-0791-G). These results indicated that lenvatinib was not a 
substrate of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. The inhibition of these transporters by lenvatinib 
was evaluated by assessing the inhibition of cellular uptake of radiolabeled typical substrates for each 
transporter. Lenvatinib showed concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, and 
OATP1B1 with the IC50 values of 7.36, 4.11, 10.8, and 7.29 μmol/L, respectively, and minimal or no 
inhibitory effect on OATP1B3 (IC50 >30 μmol/L). 
The potential for [14C]lenvatinib to be a substrate for OCT1 and BSEP, and the potential of lenvatinib to 
inhibit these transporters were assessed using OCT1 expressing HEK293 cells and BSEP expressing closed 
inside-out vesicles (Study No. GE-0942-G), respectively. Lenvatinib was not a substrate for OCT1 and BSEP. 
Lenvatinib showed concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on OCT1- and BSEP-mediated uptake of each 
respective radiolabeled typical substrate with IC50 values of 14.9 and 14.2 μmol/L. 
In Study No DMPKT2012-004, the potential inhibition of human AO activity by lenvatinib and its metabolites 
(M1, M2, M3, M2´, M3´, and M5) was evaluated using human liver cytosol. AO specific activity was assessed 
using phthalazine, known to be a substrate of AO, by measuring the concentration of its metabolite, 
phthalazone, with liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Lenvatinib 
did not inhibit AO activity (IC50 >100 μmol/L). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
All pivotal toxicity studies were performed in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations, 
and designed in accordance with the relevant guidelines.  
The applicant provided the same as for the Lenvima MAA.  
Single dose toxicity 
The single dose toxicity of lenvatinib was evaluated in oral single-dose toxicity studies in rats, followed by a 
4-day or 4-week observation period, and in dose escalation studies in dogs and monkeys.

Table 7: Overview of single dose toxicity studies with lenvatinib mesilate 
Rats 
In both the oral dose range-finding (DRF) toxicity study (Study No. TKB02006) and the GLP-compliant single-
dose oral toxicity study (Study No. S04094) lenvatinib mesilate was suspended with 75% polyethylene glycol 
(PEG) 400 aqueous solution and administered as a single oral dose, by gavage, to male and female SD rats 
(3 animals/sex/group in the DRF, 5 animals/sex/group in the GLP compliant study) (vehicle control, 75% PEG 
400 aqueous solution). In the DRF study, at 1000 mg/kg, decreased food consumption was observed in 
males, and red spots in the stomach were observed macroscopically in both males and females. Watery 
contents in the small intestine were observed in 1 female rat at 1000 mg/kg. No abnormalities were observed 
in any rats administered 100 or 300 mg/kg. 
In the GLP-compliant study, a 4-week observation period was included. Delayed deaths (observed from Day 
14 onward) were observed in 3 animals administered 1000 or 2000 mg/kg. In these animals, decreased 
activity, hypothermia, staining of the nose region, chromaturia (reddish urine), or discoloration of the eyeball 
were observed before death. At necropsy, dilatation, mucosal thickening, and red focus were observed in the 
stomach and duodenum. In addition, agglomeration of food and test article was found in the stomach or 
occluded the duodenum. Similar GI changes were observed in surviving animals at 1000 or 2000 mg/kg. 
White discoloration of incisors, decreased food consumption, and subsequent suppression of body weight gain 
were observed in these groups. No test article related changes were observed at the dose of 500 mg/kg. 
Dogs 
Lenvatinib  mesilate  was  administered  orally  in  gelatin  capsules,  as  a  single  dose,  to  1  male  and  1  female 
beagle dog in a dose escalation study (Study No. TKB02022). Each dog received single doses of 100, 300, or 
1000 mg/kg as a 3-fold trituration with lactose with an interval of 1 week between doses in a dose escalation 
manner. 
There  were  no  deaths.  No  toxicologically  significant  changes  in  clinical  signs,  body  weight,  or  food 
consumption  were  observed  in  the  dogs  orally  administered  doses  up  to  300  mg/kg.  At  1000  mg/kg,  the 
female dog showed vomiting immediately after administration. 
Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from zero time to 24 
hours (AUC(0-24)) values increased with dose escalation from 100 to 300 mg/kg. Cmax and AUC(0-24) 
values at 1000 mg/kg were lower than those at 300 mg/kg. 
Monkeys 
Lenvatinib mesilate was administered orally by gavage, as a single dose, to 2 male cynomolgus monkeys at 
doses of 0 (vehicle control, 75% PEG 400 aqueous solution, 30, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg with an interval of

1 day between each dose in a dose escalation study (Study No. S03060). Both animals were necropsied after 
completion of the observation period following the final administration. 
There were no deaths. No abnormal clinical signs were induced by lenvatinib treatment except for watery 
stool, which was also present following dosing with the vehicle. One male showed decreased food 
consumption after administration of 300 mg/kg and higher. Macroscopically, abnormal materials in the 
stomach and watery contents in the small and large intestine were observed in both animals treated with 
lenvatinib, while red spots in the stomach were only observed in 1 animal. 
Cmax and AUC(0-24) values at 30 mg/kg were 13.31 μg/mL and 95.19 μg·h/mL, respectively. The plasma 
concentration of lenvatinib 2 hours after administration did not increase proportionally with administered 
dose between 100 and 1000 mg/kg.

Carcinogenicity 
In accordance with the ICH S9 guideline which states that carcinogenicity studies are not warranted to 
support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer, no study evaluating the 
carcinogenic potential of lenvatinib was submitted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In  accordance  with  the  ICH  S9  guideline,  the  reproduction  and  developmental  toxicity  assessment  for 
lenvatinib is comprised of only EFD studies in both rats and rabbit. Because lenvatinib was teratogenic in the 
rat  and  rabbit  EFD  studies,  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  studies,  and  pre-  and  postnatal 
development toxicity studies were not conducted.

A 2-week dose range finding study in juvenile rats 
In order to determine the dosing regimen and the dose levels for the pivotal study in juvenile rats, a 2-week 
dose range-finding study was conducted with 2 phases. Lenvatinib mesilate was administered orally, by 
gavage, once daily for 2 weeks to male and female SD rats (5 animals/group/sex) at doses of 0 (vehicle 
control, water for injection), 0.2, 0.4, 1, or 5 mg/kg from postnatal day (PND) 7 (Phase 1) or at doses of 0, 
0.4, 1, 5, 25 mg/kg from PND21 (Phase 2). 
Cmax and AUC(0-24) increased dose-proportionally, and there were no biologically significant differences in 
systemic exposure between males and females. Following repeated administration, the systemic exposure on 
Day 14 was relatively lower than on Day 1; however, these differences were not considered biologically 
significant by the applicant.  
An overview of the findings including toxicokinetics (as mean values of male and female data) is presented 
below.

exudate and arterial fibrinoid necrosis in 
choroid plexus). 
In phase I, the lowest dose of 0.2 mg/kg can be considered as the NOAEL, while in phase II, the dose of 1 
mg/kg was considered to be NOEL. 
In  summary,  toxicity  of  lenvatinib  was  more  prominent  in  PND7  juvenile  rats  than  PND21  rats.  Lenvatinib 
mesilate at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher were lethal in PND7 animals while no death was observed up to 25 
mg/kg in PND21 animals. 
An 8-week toxicity study in juvenile rats 
Because of the severe toxicities observed in the DRF when dosing the animals from PND7, the pivotal study 
was conducted with animals of the age of PND 21. Lenvatinib mesilate was administered orally by gavage 
once a day for 8 weeks to male and female SD rats (10 animals/group/sex) from PND 21 at doses of 0 
(vehicle control, water for injection), 0.4, 2, or 10 mg/kg. 
The Cmax and AUC(0-24) were increased proportionally. No gender difference and no effect of repeated dosing 
on  Cmax  and  AUC(0-24)  was  observed.  Differences  in  systemic  exposure  observed  following  repeated 
administration were not considered biologically significant by the applicant. 
An overview of the findings including toxicokinetics (as mean values of male and female data) is presented 
below.

Toxicokinetic data 
Rats 
The median time at which the highest drug concentration occurred (tmax) was between 0.25 and 1.5 hours 
after  administration.  No  apparent  gender  difference  was  observed  in  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters.  The 
Cmax and AUC(0-24) of lenvatinib increased approximately dose-proportionally from 0.4 to 10 mg/kg on Days 
1 and 181 (149) in males and females, respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters of lenvatinib were not 
significantly affected by repeated administration, except at doses of 30 mg/kg and above, the mean systemic 
exposure decreased after a 4-week administration. 
Dogs 
The median tmax was 2 hours after dosing. The mean Cmax and AUC(0-24)  of lenvatinib increased dose 
proportionally from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg. No difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters was observed 
between males and females in any dosing group. No apparent changes in pharmacokinetic parameters as a 
result of repeated administration for 4 weeks were observed in males. 
Monkeys 
The median tmax values were between 1 and 4 hours after administration. No apparent gender difference in 
Cmax or AUC(0-24)  was observed. The mean Cmax and AUC(0-24) generally increased in a more than dose-
proportional manner from 0.1 to 3.0 mg/kg in males and females on Day 1. There were no significant 
changes in Cmax or AUC(0-24) after repeated administration for up to 39 weeks.

Local Tolerance  
Specific local tolerance studies for lenvatinib have not been conducted. Local tolerance of lenvatinib was 
assessed by examination of the GI tissues from oral administration studies. 
Other toxicity studies 
An  in  vitro  33  NRU  phototoxicity  study  was  conducted  (Study  No.  SBL038-070)  to  assess  the  phototoxic 
potential of lenvatinib because lenvatinib absorbs light within the range of 290 to 700 nm, and has an affinity 
to  melanin  based  on  the  slow  elimination  of  radioactivity  in  the  tissues  containing  melanin.  These  results 
showed  that  lenvatinib  had  no  phototoxic  potential  under  the  conditions  employed  in  the  in  vitro  3T3  NRU 
phototoxicity test. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment has already been performed to evaluate the potential environmental risk 
resulting from the use of lenvatinib hard capsules in the treatment of patients with progressive, radioiodine-
refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC).

Using a worst-case refined Fpen value of 0.00001 for RR-DTC, the PECSURFACEWATER for lenvatinib has 
been calculated to be 0.00012 μg/L. This value is ~100 times lower than the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. 
A new environmental risk assessment has now been performed to evaluate the additional potential 
environmental risk resulting from the use of lenvatinib hard capsules in the treatment of patients with 
advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with lenvatinib hard capsules in combination with 
everolimus, following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy. 
Regarding the environmental risk, LogKow was determined to be 3.3 using the shake-flask method. 
Therefore, an assessment for PBT is not necessary. The applicant provided published data to calculate the 
prevalence of the disease population targeted by Lenvatinib and this was used to refine Fpen. Using the 
refined Fpen, a PECsw was calculated that was below the action limit. Therefore lenvatinib is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
With regard to pharmacology, the applicant has conducted additional in vitro studies in cell-based assays (7 
in  total)  and  in  vivo  studies  in  xenograft  models  with  the  combination  of  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  (4  in 
total),  to  support  the  original  data  submitted  under  the  previous  MAA  for  lenvatinib  mesilate 
(EMEA/H/C/3727).  The additional in vitro studies showed that lenvatinib inhibited both the MAPK and mTOR-
S6K-S6 pathways and that inhibition of the latter pathway was enhanced by the combination with everolimus 
in  both  VEGF-  and  FGF-stimulated  HUVECs.  Both  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  inhibited  VEGF-driven 
proliferation  in  HUVECs  in  vitro,  with  the  combination  of  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  having  mostly  additive 
effects  for  inhibition  of  VEGF-driven  proliferation  and  mostly  synergistic  effects  for  inhibition  of  FGF-driven 
tube formation of HUVECs. The human tumour xenograft in vivo studies suggested that lenvatinib may be an 
effective  anticancer  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  advanced  and/or  metastatic  renal  cell  carcinoma,  in 
combination  with  everolimus,  following  failure  of  treatment  with  1  prior  therapy.  Results  of  the  nonclinical 
safety  pharmacology  studies  suggest  that  lenvatinib  has  a  low  potential  for  exerting  adverse  effects  on  the 
CNS,  cardiovascular  system  or  the  respiratory  system.  The  lack  of  effect  on  ECG  parameters  in  the  in  vivo 
study and the weak inhibitory effects of lenvatinib in the hERG assay (IC50 = 11.89 μmol/L or 6,2 µg/ml) at 
a concentration approximately 20-fold higher than the total maximum observed concentration (Cmax) at the 
clinical  dose  of  18  mg  (in  Study  E7080-G000-205)  and  1378-fold  higher  than  the  free  Cmax  at  the  human 
therapeutic dose, suggest that lenvatinib has a low potential to cause QT prolongation. No significant effects

on heart rate and mean blood pressure were noted in the in vivo study in dogs. However, hypertension is an 
identified risk associated with clinical use of lenvatinib and other inhibitors of the VEGF/VEGFR pathway. 
According  to  the  ICH  S9  guideline,  conduct  of  standalone  safety  pharmacology  studies  is  not  required  for 
advanced  cancer  indications;  however,  the  core  battery  of  stand-alone  safety  pharmacology  studies  was 
nonetheless conducted.  
Results  from  additional  pharmacokinetic  studies  performed  by  the  applicant  showed  that  lenvatinib  was  the 
main  fraction  of  total  radioactivity  in  plasma  after  oral  administration  of  both  [14C]lenvatinib  mesilate  and 
[14C]CB-lenvatinib  mesilate.  Metabolite  peaks  did  not  exceed  1.9%  of  the  total  radioactivity  values  after 
administration  of  [14C]lenvatinib  mesilate.  No  non-clinical  combination  pharmacokinetic  studies  with 
lenvatinib  and  everolimus  have  been  conducted.  Further  exploration  on  the  potential  interaction  between 
lenvatinib and everolimus is needed and will be addressed in a post marketing study (Study 109, please see 
RMP  section  2.8).  This  drug-drug  interaction  study  will  investigate  the  potential  of  Lenavtinib  for  CYP3A4 
inhibition/induction.     
No  new  toxicology  studies  with  lenvatinib  alone  or  in  combination  with  everolimus  have  been  conducted, 
which  may  be  acceptable  according  to  ICHS9.  This  means  that  all  observed  toxicities  and  corresponding 
exposures  in  animals  have  been  compared  with  clinical  exposures  at  a  dose  of  24  mg/day,  which  was  the 
recommended dose for the DTC MAA. For the current MAA, the proposed dose is 18 mg/day (in combination 
with  everolimus,  5  mg/day).  It  is  not  considered  that  this  would  lead  to  different  overall  conclusions, 
therefore  this  can  be  accepted.  However,  since  the  clinical  anticipated  exposure  to  lenvatinib  is  thus  lower 
with the dosing regimen as proposed in the current MAA, all safety margins should in principle be somewhat 
higher. The administration route of in vivo studies was oral, which is the intended route for clinical use.  
In  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  ICH  S9  guideline,  carcinogenicity  studies,  fertility  studies, 
and  pre-and  postnatal  toxicity  studies  were  not  conducted  with  lenvatinib  to  support  marketing  approval  in 
the proposed advanced cancer indication. 
Clinical  experience  with  the  combination  is  limited.  Non-clinical  combination  PD  studies  in  vivo  for  15  days 
give  some  reassurance  on  the  absence  of  acute  synergistic  toxicities.  Based  on  the  toxicity  profile  of  each 
drug  in  nonclinical  studies,  the  kidney,  GI  tract,  and  reproductive  organs  are  the  target  organs  in  which 
additive  or  synergistic  toxicity  might  be  expected.  The  available  data  overall  suggest  a  low  potential  for 
additive  or  synergistic  toxicities  with  the  combination,  apart  from  increased  toxicities  at  the  level  of  the  GI 
tract with potential deterioration of general condition.  
Regarding the environmental risk, LogKow was determined to be 3.3 using the shake-flask method. 
Therefore, an assessment for PBT was not necessary. The applicant provided published data to calculate the 
prevalence of the disease population targeted by Lenvatinib and this was used to refine Fpen. Using the 
refined Fpen, a PECsw was calculated that was below the action limit. Therefore lenvatinib is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data are considered adequate to support a marketing authorisation for Kisplyx. However, 
further exploration of the potential interaction between lenvatinib and everolimus is needed and will be 
addressed in a post marketing study (Study 109). This drug-drug interaction study will investigate the 
potential of Lenvatinib for CYP3A4 inhibition/induction (please see RMP in section 2.8).

The primary evidence of efficacy of combination treatment with lenvatinib and everolimus in the unresectable 
advanced  of  metastatic  RCC  indication  following  one  prior  VEGF-targeted  treatment  comes  from    a  single, 
open-label, Phase 1b/2 study, which is randomised in Phase 2 only  (Study E7080-G000-205 [Study 205]). 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A number of in vitro studies were performed to determine the plasma protein binding, the metabolism, and 
the potential of Lenvatinib to be a substrate of a number of drug transporters.  Lenvatinib was also tested as 
an inhibitor and inducer of drug metabolising enzymes and drug transporters. 
The clinical pharmacology studies included 6 studies in healthy subjects (E7080-A001-001, -002, -003, -004, 
-007, -008), one study in healthy subjects and subjects with renal impairment (E7080-A001-005), one study 
in healthy subjects and subjects with hepatic impairment (E7080-A001-006), and one mass balance study in 
subjects with advanced solid tumours (E7080-E044-104). The clinical pharmacology studies also included 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 51/162 
  
  
 
 
 
 
studies on bioavailability of different formulations, food effect, drug-drug interaction (DDI) and potential 
effects on the QT interval.  
The doses used in the studies ranged from either 0.1 mg to 24 mg twice daily (BID) or 0.2 mg to 32 mg once 
daily (QD).  Studies were conducted in male and female healthy subjects, individuals of different racial origin 
(few data on non-Caucasian and non-Asian population) and in subjects with solid tumours or lymphomas. 
A population PK (PopPK) analysis (Report CPMS-E7080-007R-v1) for lenvatinib was based on pooled data 
collected from:  
o  Phase 1 trials in healthy subjects (Studies E7080-A001-001, E7080-A001-002, E7080-A001-
003, E7080-A001-004, E7080-A001-007, E7080-A001-008), plus E7080-A001-005, and 
E7080-A001-006 which included otherwise healthy renally and hepatically impaired subjects,  
o  3 Phase 1 clinical trials in subjects with solid tumours including lymphoma refractory to 
existing therapies or for which no treatment is available (Studies E7080-E044-101, E7080-
A001-102, and E7080-J081-103), an additional Phase 1 trial in subjects with solid tumours 
(Study E7080-J081-105),  
o  a Phase 2 trial in subjects with advanced or recurrent thyroid cancer (Study E7080-J081-
208), 
o  a Phase 2 trial in subjects with medullary and 131I refractory, unresectable differentiated 
thyroid cancers (Study E7080-G000-201), and  
o  a Phase 3 trial in subjects with 131I-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (Study E7080-
G000-303) was conducted.   
This analysis was conducted to describe the PK of lenvatinib and identify covariates explaining intersubject 
variability in lenvatinib PK.  The covariates included demographics, clinical laboratory data, and tumour type 
(DTC, MTC, and other). 
Absorption  
Lenvatinib, from both tablet and capsule formulations, was rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a 
time to reach maximum concentration of drug in plasma (t max) typically observed 1 to 4 hours post-dose. The 
observed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ after a single dose of 24 mg (SD) in healthy volunteers were 325 (105) 
ng/mL, 2990 (974) ng.h/mL and 3010 (974) ng.h/mL, respectively (Study A001-005). In patients, Cmax and 
exposure after administration of a single 24 mg dose appear to be higher than in healthy volunteers: values 
of 655 (97) ng/mL and 4905 (2145) ng.h/mL have been observed for Cmax and AUC(0-24), respectively 
(Study A001-102). There were no data after multiple dosing in healthy volunteers.  
In the POPPK analysis healthy volunteers had a 15% higher CL/F compared with subjects with malignant solid 
tumours. 
The absolute bioavailability of lenvatinib was not determined.

Influence of food 
Study E7080-A001-003 
The primary objective of this trial was to determine the effect of food on the bioavailability of lenvatinib 
following single oral administration of a capsule containing 10 mg E7080 with and without a meal. The study 
was a Phase I, open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-treatment (dosing condition), 2-period, 2-sequence, 
cross-over study in healthy volunteers. Sixteen subjects (12 males and 4 females) received 10 mg of E7080 
as a single dose under the two different conditions (fed versus fasting) in a randomised order. Two single 
dose administrations (one in each of the two consecutive treatment periods) were separated by a washout 
period of 14 days between the two dosing. “Fasting” was defined as deprivation of food for ≥ 10 hours (tap 
water was allowed), whereas “fed” was defined as administration of the drug 30 minutes after the start of a 
standard high-fat breakfast (approximately 150 calories of protein, 250 calories of carbohydrate, and 500 to 
600 calories of fat). 
The administration of a single oral dose of 10 mg lenvatinib with a standard high-fat breakfast was associated 
with non-significant increases in lenvatinib AUC(0-inf) (ratio%, 90% CI: 106.3, 95.66 to 118.09) and AUC(0-t) 
fold (ratio%, 90% CI: 103.7, 92.25 to 116.50). However, Cmax point estimate was reduced by 
approximately 5% compared to that in the fasted state. As the 90% CIs of the ratio of this pharmacokinetic 
parameter were without the standard bioequivalence range, these results indicated that food delays the rate 
of absorption in a significant way. In addition, median t max for lenvatinib was approximately 2-fold increased 
after administration with food (4.02 h) compared to administration in the fasted state (2.02 h). 
Study E7080-E044-101 
Study  E7080-E044-101  was  an  open-label,  non-randomized,  dose  escalation  study  in  eighty-two  male  and 
female subjects with solid tumors or lymphomas resistant or refractory to existing therapies or for whom no 
treatment was available. This Phase 1 study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
for lenvatinib. A pilot evaluation of the influence of  food on lenvatinib pharmacokinetic at the MTD (25 mg) 
was also conducted in this study.   
Eleven subjects entered and completed the food effect pilot study at a once daily lenvatinib dose of 25 mg (2 
x 10 mg tablets and 5 x 1.0 mg tablets). These subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose 
of  25  mg  lenvatinib  administered  after  a  high-fat  breakfast  (approximately  150  calories  of  protein,  250 
calories of carbohydrate, and 600 calories of fat) or following at least a 10 hour fast on the morning or either 
Cycle  1  Day  15  or  Cycle  1  Day  22.  The  effect  of  food  on  lenvatinib  pharmacokinetics  was  evaluated  by 
comparing AUC0-24 and Cmax. 
Administration of a single oral dose of 25 mg lenvatinib after a standardized high fat breakfast had no impact 
on the mean plasma exposure (AUC0-24) for lenvatinib. Compared to overnight fasting, the mean maximum 
plasma concentration (Cmax) of lenvatinib was slightly reduced in the presence of food (2 %). The 90% CIs of 
the  ratio  of  this  pharmacokinetic  parameter  being  without  the  standard  bioequivalence  range,  it  indicated 
that food significantly decreases the rate of absorption of lenvatinib. Moreover, t max was prolonged in the fed 
conditions  (5  hours,  median  value)  compared  with  the  fasted  conditions  (2  hours,  median  value)  and  the 
difference  was  statistically  significant  (p  =  0.0146),  indicating  that  dosing  with  food  delays  the  time  to 
maximum plasma concentrations (t max).

Bioequivalence (BE) 
The  relative  bioavailability  of  the  10  mg  capsule  and  10  mg  tablet  was  determined  in  healthy  volunteers 
(E7080-A001-001  (Relative  Bioavailability)).  This  was  a  single-centre,  single-dose,  open-label,  randomized, 
2-period  cross-over  study  conducted  in  20  healthy  men  under  fasting  conditions.    The  objective  was  to 
determine the relative bioavailability of a capsule formulation to a tablet formulation.  The subjects received 
either one 10-mg capsule or one 10 mg tablet on the first day of the first period.  The subjects received the 
study drug following an overnight fast of at least 10 h.  They received the alternate formulation on the first 
day of the second period.  There was a 1-week (7-day) washout between the 2 treatment periods.  Nineteen 
subjects completed the study. 
Mean total exposure (AUC(0-inf)) of the 10-mg lenvatinib capsule was approximately 10% less than that of the 
10-mg  lenvatinib  tablet.  Mean  Cmax  for  the  capsule  was  approximately  14%  lower  than  that  of  the  tablet. 
Median t max was 2.0 hours for both the capsule and tablet. Mean t 1/2  values for the capsule and tablet were 
comparable  (27.6  h  and  29.1  h,  respectively).  The  variability  in  exposures  was  low,  with  the  highest 
coefficients of variation, Cmax, less than 26% for both formulations. Even though the study was not powered 
for  BE,  the  90%  confidence  intervals  for  AUC(0-inf)  and  AUC(0-t)  were  within  the  80%  to  125%  confidence 
interval  typically  used  to  demonstrate  BE.  However,  the  lower  bound  of  the  confidence  interval  for  Cmax 
(79.84%) was outside the 80% bound. 
A bioavailability study comparing the 4-mg to the 10-mg capsule was not done. The 4-mg capsule was shown 
to  have  a  similar  dissolution  profile  as  10-mg  capsule.    Additionally,  proportionate  increases  in  lenvatinib 
exposure  (based  on  dose  normalized  AUC(0-24)  and  Cmax)  following  single  doses  and  at  steady-state,  were 
seen  over  the  0.2-mg  to  32-mg  QD  dose  range  (E7080-E044-101)  and  the  0.1-  to  12-mg  BID  dose  range 
(E7080-A001-102).  Also,  the  4-mg  strength  capsule  is  proportionally  similar  in  its  active  and  inactive 
ingredients to the 10-mg strength.   
The 4- and 10-mg capsules (and occasionally the 1-mg) were used in most of the Phase 1 and 2 trials.  The 
4- and 10-mg capsules were used in the Phase 3 trial and are the intended commercial formulation. 
Distribution 
As  there  is  no  study  with  intravenous  administration  of  lenvatinib,  the  volume  of  distribution  has  not  been 
determined. Apparent volume (V/F) was generally not reported in the studies with healthy volunteers. Only in 
the renal and hepatic impairment studies (Studies A001-005 and A001-006), values were reported. The total 
values  were  428  (153)  L  and  408  (216)  L,  respectively,  and  the  unbound  values  were  6700  (4460)  L  and 
6760 (6370) L, respectively. In the patient studies, the reported Vz/F values ranged from 50.5-92 L (Study 
E044-101)  and  136-312  L  (Study  J081-103).  At  steady  state,  the  values  ranged  from  43.2-121  L  (Study 
E044-101) and 155-261 L (Study J081-103). 
The  estimated  V/F  values  from  the  POPPK  analysis  showed  values  of  49.3,  30.7  and  37.1  L  for  the  central 
and 2 peripheral compartments, respectively.  
In humans, the in vitro plasma protein binding of lenvatinib (concentration range: 0.3 to 30 μg/mL, mesilate) 
was 97.87% to 98.62%, with binding mainly to albumin and to a lesser extent to α1-acid-glycoprotein and γ-
globulin.  Protein  binding  was  linear  across  concentrations.  This  observation  was  confirmed  in  vivo,  with 
serum protein binding values ranging from 96.6% to 98.2% (Study E7080-J081-103).

The in vitro blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of lenvatinib remained constant (0.589 to 0.608) in humans 
over  the  concentration  range  tested  (0.1  to  10  μg/mL  [14C]lenvatinib  mesilate).  The  predominance  of 
lenvatinib  in  plasma  over  blood  was  also  confirmed  in  the  mass  balance  study,  where  blood  concentrations 
were 29% and 36% lower than plasma concentrations for total radioactivity and lenvatinib, respectively. 
In  vitro  studies  indicate  that  lenvatinib  is  a  substrate  for  multidrug  resistance  protein  1  (MDR1),  P-gp,  and 
BCRP.  Lenvatinib is not a substrate for OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, or the BSEP. 
Elimination 
Excretion 
Following Cmax, the plasma concentrations of lenvatinib declined bi-exponentially. The mean terminal 
elimination half-life (t1/2) of total lenvatinib ranged from 20.6 hours to 34.3 hours in the studies in healthy 
volunteers. The mean terminal exponential half-life of lenvatinib was approximately 28 hours. The PK of 
lenvatinib was characterised by an oral clearance of 6.7 L/hour (Study E7080-E044-104). In the population 
PK analysis, CL/F was 6.56 L/h and its %CV was 25.5%. 
After administration of an oral solution of lenvatinib in the mass balance study, 85.5% of the administered 
dose has been found in urine or as metabolites in faeces. Degradation of lenvatinib in faeces is judged 
unlikely and urinary excretion of unchanged drug is negligible. Metabolism appeared to be the major 
elimination pathway for lenvatinib and the excretion of lenvatinib and its metabolites occurred mainly via the 
faecal route. 
Metabolism  
In vitro results with recombinant CYPs indicated that CYP3A4 was the predominant (>80%) isoform 
contributing to the CYP-dependent metabolism of lenvatinib in humans, followed by CYP1A2 (5.2% to 6.5%) 
and CYP2B6 (5.2% to 5.7%). Aldehyde oxidase (AO) is responsible for the metabolisation to M3’ and M3’ 
glucuronide.   
The in vivo metabolism has been studied in a human radiolabelled study E7080-E044-104. In this absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) study, in which 24 mg of 14C-lenvatinib (approximately 100 µCi 
(~3.7 MBq)) was administered to 3 men and 3 women with advanced solid tumours or lymphomas, who were 
unsuitable for, or had failed, existing therapies, most of the recovered radioactivity was found in faeces, 64% 
of mean total recovery, and 25% of mean total recovery recovered in urine (i.e. 89% of the dose was 
recovered in the excreta) (see SmPC section 5.2).  
In the mass balance study, the mean recovery of 14C-radioactivity was 89%, with approximately 64% 
excreted in the feces and 25% in the urine. In urine and faeces, 0.38% and 2.5%, respectively of the 
radioactive dose was found as lenvatinib. Fractions of the dose eliminated in the urine as unchanged 
lenvatinib were not dependent on the dose administered. The M3’ metabolite was the predominant analyte in 
excreta (~17% of the dose), followed by M2’ (~11% of the dose) and M2 (~4.4% of the dose) (see SmPC 
section 5.2).     
In plasma samples collected up to 24 hours after administration, lenvatinib constituted 97% of the 
radioactivity in plasma radiochromatograms while the M2 metabolite accounted for an additional 2.5%.  
Based on AUC(0 – inf), lenvatinib accounted for 60% and 64% of the total radioactivity in plasma and blood, 
respectively (see SmPC section 5.2).

Extraction recovery of radioactivity in plasma samples appeared to decrease in time (with a minimum of 10% 
72h after administration) and was, for the later time-points, also highly variable (%CV up to 46%).80% of 
the recovered radioactivity in excreta (urine and faeces) was identified.  
Based on the in vivo data, the following overview of metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in humans has been 
proposed.

In total, the contribution to lenvatinib clearance in human is summarized in the table 22 below. The ratio of 
aldehyde oxidase (AO): CYP3A: non-enzymatic process is approximately 3:4:3 in humans.

a:  maximally estimated value. 
There is a substantial body of literature confirming that it is possible to observe clinically relevant drug-drug 
interactions  mediated  by  inhibition  of  AO.  The  article  by  Obach  et  al.,2004  showed  that  there  is  a  wide 
variety of drugs on the market which are able to inhibit aldehyde oxidase activity and so have the potential to 
affect exposure of co-administered drugs which are metabolised via this enzyme. However, the proportion of 
the dose of lenvatinib which is metabolised through AO is quite low (approx. 17%), with the remainder being 
cleared via other metabolic routes with just a small amount of parent drug excreted unchanged. Conversely, 
this  means  that  a  large  proportion  of  the  dose  is  eliminated  via  non-AO  mediated  mechanisms.  There  are 
multiple alternative clearance pathways available for lenvatinib in addition to AO metabolism which are likely 
to buffer any minor influence of inhibition of the enzyme. Hence, there is no expectation that inhibition of this 
pathway will lead to clinically significant effects on lenvatinib exposure. 
Inter- and intra-individual variability  
In normal healthy subjects, variability (as coefficient of variation [%CV] of AUC, fasted subjects) ranged from 
about 8% to 20%. In Study E7080-A001-102 (Combination Therapy), PK parameters exhibited moderate to 
high variability, with %CV estimates ranging from 19.44% to 78%. Compared to normal subjects, subjects 
with renal or hepatic impairment had greater variability (39% to 45%). In a formal population PK analysis, 
the %CV of basal apparent total clearance following extravascular administration (CL/F) was 25.5%. 
In order to explain inter-individual variability in lenvatinib exposure (AUC), in the POPPK analysis for 
lenvatinib, the effect of various covariates was tested on CL/F, and formulation, H2-blockers, proton pump 
inhibitors, antacids, and combined category of pH elevating agents was tested on relative bioavailability. 
None of these influenced in an important way the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-proportionality 
In patients with solid tumours administered single and multiple doses of lenvatinib once daily, exposure to 
lenvatinib (Cmax and AUC) increased in direct proportion to the administered dose over the range of 3.2 to 
32 mg once-daily (QD) (see SmPC section 5.2).   
In study E7080-E044-101, the observed t 1/2 values decreased with increasing dose. However from a dose of 
6.4 mg on, this appeared to be relatively stable. 
When data from E7080-E044-101 and E7080-J081-103 were combined, the dose-normalized Cmax was very 
consistent across doses of 4 mg and higher, although variability was high across the lower doses (less than 4 
mg). Cmax showed a linear profile at clinical doses, i.e., 4 mg or higher.  In vitro study data indicate that 
lenvatinib is a substrate of permeability glycoprotein (P-gp). Thus, a likely explanation of the nonlinearity of 
Cmax at lower doses is that P-gp expressed in the gut has an efflux functional effect on lenvatinib, which 
leads to slower absorption of lenvatinib at these doses.   
From the POPPK analysis, the CL/F was reported to be 6.56 L/h and this value appeared to be constant upon 
repeated dosing and through different dosing levels.  
For the linearity in CL/F, the PK model was run without the effect of dose on CL/F. There was an increase of 
128.176 points in the objective function value, from 64389.472 to 64517.648. In addition, the PK model was 
run without the effect of dose on F1 and again there was an increase of 62.288 points in the objective 
function value, from 64389.472 to 64451.76. To further investigate the relationship between dose and CL/F, 
the final PK model was run using only capsule formulation PK data and without estimating F1. This is of value 
as the term “F1” is a relative bioavailability term in the model linking the tablet and to-be-marketed capsule 
formulations. Adding dose effect on CL/F decreased the objective function value by 5.067 points (from 
37346.978 to 37341.901, which is not statistically significant).   
Time-dependency 
Upon multiple dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations were achieved within 5 days. Lenvatinib displayed 
minimimal accumulation at steady state.  Over the dose range 3.2 to 32 mg, the median accumulation index 
(Rac) ranged from 0.96 (20 mg) to 1.54 (6.4 mg). 
This was consistent with the approximately 28 hour half-life of lenvatinib and once daily administration. 
Apparent clearance and volume of distribution were generally similar between first dose and steady-state and 
between doses. 
Special populations 
In the population PK analysis, apparent total clearance following oral administration (CL/F) was 15% higher 
in healthy subjects compared to patients and hence the extent of exposure (AUC) was slightly lower for 
healthy subjects. The PK parameters of lenvatinib were similar in subjects with DTC, medullary thyroid cancer 
(MTC) and other tumour types.

In the population PK analysis that included data from 196 healthy subjects and 583 patients, age was not a 
significant covariate that could account for the inter-subject variability in the PK of lenvatinib (CPMS-E7080-
007R-v1). Median dose and weight adjusted lenvatinib exposure in cancer patients receiving lenvatinib 
capsules was 3480 ng•h/mL for subjects with age ≤65 years and 3710 ng•h/mL for subjects with age 
>65 years.

Impaired renal function (study E7080-A001-005) 
A Phase 1, multicentre, open-Label, non-randomized, single-dose, pharmacokinetic and safety study of 
E7080 (24 mg) administered to subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and to healthy 
subjects was submitted  to describe and compare the PK of lenvatinib from a single 24-mg oral dose of 
lenvatinib administered to subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (N=6 in each group) and 
to healthy subjects (N=8) distributionally matched in age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) and to describe 
the safety of a single 24-mg oral dose of lenvatinib. Both total (bound + unbound) and unbound drug 
concentrations of lenvatinib were determined. A method using a centrifugal ultrafiltration followed with LC-
MS/MS was used to determine unbound lenvatinib in plasma. 
Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-inf) exhibited moderate to high variability. For subjects with mild, moderate, and 
severe renal impairment, overall exposure (AUC(0-inf)) to lenvatinib was estimated to be 1.01, 0.90, and 1.22

times that of normal subjects. The half-life for lenvatinib was similar between the normal and the renally 
impaired subjects. Using a regression method, no statistically significant correlation between lenvatinib 
exposure and creatinine clearance (CL cr) was observed.   
Lenvatinib exposure, based on AUC0-inf data, was 101%, 90%, and 122% of normal for subjects with mild, 
moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively (see SmPC section 5.2)..   
• 
Impaired hepatic function (study E7080-A001-006) 
A Phase 1, multicentre, open-label, single-dose pharmacokinetic and safety study of lenvatinib in subjects 
with mild (10 mg) (Child-Pugh A), moderate (10 mg) (Child-Pugh B), and severe hepatic impairment (5 mg) 
(Child-Pugh C) and normal hepatic function (10 mg) evaluated the PK of lenvatinib from a single oral dose of 
10 mg in subjects (N=6) with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and from a single oral dose of 5 mg in 
subjects (N=6) with severe hepatic impairment compared to a single oral dose of 10 mg in healthy subjects 
with (N=8) normal hepatic function and to assess the safety of lenvatinib in subjects with hepatic impairment 
compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.  
The median half-life was comparable in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment as well 
as those with normal hepatic function and ranged from 26 hours to 31 hours.  The percentage of the dose of 
lenvatinib excreted in urine was low in all cohorts (<2.16% across treatment cohorts). 
Lenvatinib exposure, based on dose-adjusted AUC0-t and AUC0-inf data, was 119%, 107%, and 180% of 
normal for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively.   
•  Gender 
The effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib was evaluated in the population PK analysis. No 
significant differences between sexes were found in lenvatinib exposure. 
•  Race 
The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib was evaluated in the population PK analysis. 
According to this POP PK analysis, the PK of lenvatinib was unaffected by race. 
•  Weight 
The effect of weight on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib was evaluated in the population PK analysis. In 
this POP PK analysis, weight (37.8 – 178 kg) added as an allometric constant on CL/F and volume 
parameters showed a statistically significant effect, but only explained 1.2 % of the inter-individual variability 
on CL/F. PK simulations showed a major overlap in the steady-state exposure in the presence and absence of 
this covariate.  
Subjects with body weight <60 kg had 36% higher exposure compared with subjects >60 kg.  
●    Children 
The safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in children aged 2 to <18 years have not yet been established.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Based on in vitro metabolism and transporter data (see non-clinical aspects), drug-drug interactions of 
lenvatinib were designed to assess effects of P-gp inhibition, CYP3A induction and inhibition on lenvatinib as a 
substrate, and to assess potential for lenvatinib to inhibit CYP2C8 and CYP3A. 
Effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib (as victim) 
•  Study E7080-A001-004 with ketoconazole (CYP3A4 and PgP inhibitor) 
The  objective  of  the  study  E7080-A001-004  was  to  assess  the  influence  of  simultaneous  CYP3A4  and  P-gp 
inhibition  using  ketoconazole  on  lenvatinib  PK  following  single-dose  oral  administration  of  5  mg  lenvatinib 
(formulated  as  a  capsule)  to  healthy  volunteers  and  to  evaluate  the  safety,  in  healthy  subjects,  of  a  single 
dose of 5 mg lenvatinib administered with and without simultaneous CYP3A4/P-gp inhibition (ketoconazole). 
Ketoconazole  inhibits  CYP3A,  P-gp  and  BCRP.  Ketoconazole  (400  mg  once  daily  for  18  days)  increased 
lenvatinib AUC about 15% and Cmax increased about 19% following administration of 5 mg lenvatinib on Day 
5. The half-life of lenvatinib was not affected suggesting that inhibition of enterocyte P-gp was responsible for 
the  changes  observed  rather  than  inhibition  of  CYP3A.  In  the  population  PK  analysis,  CYP3A  inhibitors 
decreased CL/F by 7.8% (CPMS-E7080-007R-v1). 
•  Study E7080-A001-007 with rifampin (CYP3A4 and PgP inducer) 
The objective of the study E7080-A001-004 was to assess the influence of P-gp inhibition and simultaneous 
P-gp and CYP3A4 induction on lenvatinib PK following single-dose oral administration of 24 mg lenvatinib to 
healthy volunteers and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 24 mg lenvatinib 
administered alone, following P-gp inhibition and following simultaneous induction of P-gp and CYP3A4 in 
healthy subjects.  
Coadministration of a single dose of rifampin (600 mg) with 24 mg of lenvatinib increased lenvatinib AUC and 
Cmax by 31% and 33%, respectively, without prolonging half-life. Following multiple doses of rifampin (600 
mg  once  daily  for  21  days)  and  a  single  24  mg  dose  of  lenvatinib  on  Day  15,  lenvatinib  AUC  and  half-life 
were reduced by 18% and 27%, respectively, while Cmax was unchanged. This result reflected the net effect 
of  enzyme  induction  and  P-gp  inhibition.  The  effect  of  strong  CYP3A  induction  in  the  absence  of  P-gp 
inhibition  was  estimated.  As  expected,  the  effect  of  induction  in  the  absence  of  P-gp  inhibition  was  slightly 
greater  than  the  net  effect  of  the  combination  of  the  2  effects  of  rifampin.  This  finding  represents  a  worst 
case  scenario  for  the  effect  of  a  strong  inducer  on  lenvatinib  exposure  since  it  is  assumed  that  the  P-gp 
inhibition effect on the PK of lenvatinib is similar under induced and non-induced conditions even though it is 
known that P-gp is also subject to PXR mediated induction. The effect of induction was relatively small, and 
consistent with in vitro and in vivo metabolism data.  
• 
Temozolomide (TMZ) 
As part of a study primarily assessing the benefit of co-administration of lenvatinib with TMZ in subjects with 
melanoma, lenvatinib’s PK parameters were assessed. This study was not designed as a formal DDI study. 
Coadministration of TMZ with lenvatinib (24 mg QD) did not alter lenvatinib’s PK parameters. 
•  Carboplatin – paclitaxel 
As part of a study primarily assessing the benefit of coadministration of lenvatinib with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel in subjects with non-small-cell lung cancer, the PK parameters of all 3 drugs were assessed (Study 
E7080-J081-110). This study was not designed as a formal DDI study. Lenvatinib PK parameters following 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 61/162 
  
  
 
coadministered with carboplatin and paclitaxel were similar to those observed with lenvatinib monotherapy. 
The PK parameters of carboplatin and paclitaxel with coadministration of lenvatinib were generally consistent 
with historical values observed without lenvatinib coadministration. 
•  H2-blockers, proton pump inhibitors 
In  the  population  PK  analysis  of  lenvatinib  (CPMS-E7080-007R-v1),  for  DDI,  co-administration  of  CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers, proton pump inhibitors, H2-blockers, antacids and combined category of pH elevating 
agents  were  tested.  Agents  that  elevate  gastric  pH  (H2-blockers,  proton  pump  inhibitors,  and  antacids)  did 
not have a significant effect on the absorption and bioavailability of lenvatinib.  
●    Everolimus 
In study E7080-G000-205, based on the dose-normalized Cmax and (AUC(0-24)), the mean lenvatinib Cmax 
was  similar  between  the  combination  and  the  lenvatinib  arms  while  the  mean  systemic  exposure  as 
measured  by  AUC(0-24)  was  approximately  20%  lower  in  the  combination  arm  compared  to  the  lenvatinib 
arm. These results should be viewed with caution given the small number of subjects in each treatment arm. 
In the population PK analysis, a log-likelihood ratio test at a P value of 0.01 showed that everolimus did not 
significantly  affect  lenvatinib  clearance.  Based  on  these  results,  the  sponsor  concluded  that  concomitant 
everolimus did not have a statistically significant effect on lenvatinib PK 
Effects of lenvatinib on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs (as perpetrator) 
•  Midazolam as CYP3A4 substrate 
A  human  physiologically  based  pharmacokinetic  (PBPK)  model  was  developed  for  lenvatinib  (Study 
DMPKA2013-156),  to  simulate  the  human  AUC  profiles  of  midazolam  with  or  without  coadministration  of 
lenvatinib, and to assess the potential risk of drug-drug interaction (DDI) between lenvatinib and the CYP3A4 
substrate midazolam.  
In  the  original  physiologically  based  pharmacokinetic  (PBPK)  model  DDI  simulation  analysis,  the  fumic  was 
calculated by Simcyp (Prediction Toolbox) based on logPo:w (partition-coefficient, the ratio of concentrations 
of a compound in the 1-octanol and water at equilibrium) , compound type, pKa, assay pH, and microsomal 
protein  concentration.  The  fumic  for  CYP3A4  was  calculated  to  be  0.503  based  on  1  mg/mL  microsomal 
protein  concentration  in  the  in  vitro  assay  condition  for  CYP3A4  time-dependent  inhibition.  Fumic  was  also 
measured in an in vitro assay at 1 mg/mL microsomal protein concentration and determined to be 0.74. With 
the new fumic value, DDI simulation for lenvatinib and CYP3A4 substrate midazolam was reevaluated and the 
geometric mean AUC ratio (AUCR) for midazolam was determined to be 1.18 with 95% CI of 1.16 - 1.20 and 
1.22  with  95%  CI  of  1.20  –  1.24,  respectively,  for  co-administration  with  24-mg  and  32-mg  doses  of 
lenvatinib, indicating low DDI risk. 
However, the in vitro data on the potential induction were judged as not sufficient and an in vivo study with 
midazolam  as  a  probe  substrate  for  CYP3A4  was  required  as  a  PAM  (category  3)  in  the  DTC  MAA  to 
investigate  adequately  the  potential  of  lenvatinib  for  CYP3A4  induction.  In  the  RMP  for  RCC,  the  study  is 
listed in the pharmacovigilance studies/activities and planned in March 2018. 
•  Repaglinide as CYP2C8 substrate  
In vitro, lenvatinib exhibited a weak to moderate, reversible inhibition of CYP2C8 (see non-clinical aspects). A 
human  physiologically  based  pharmacokinetic  (PBPK)  model  was  developed  for  lenvatinib  (Study 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 62/162 
  
  
 
 
DMPKA2013-156),  to  simulate  the  human  AUC  profiles  of  repaglinide  with  or  without  coadministration  of 
lenvatinib, and to assess the potential risk of drug-drug interaction (DDI) between lenvatinib and the CYP2C8 
substrate repaglinide. 
For the DDI simulation, repaglinide was given as a 0.25-mg oral dose either alone or concomitantly on Day 1 
with lenvatinib 24 mg p.o. dose QDx8 (Day 1-Day 9). In an additional simulation, repaglinide 0.25-mg p.o. 
was dosed with a supratherapeutic 32-mg p.o. dose of lenvatinib. This was done as a “worst case” scenario 
to confirm the effect at excessively high lenvatinib concentrations. 
The  geometric  mean  AUCR  for  repaglinide  0.25-mg  p.o.  with  or  without  lenvatinib  24-mg  and  32-mg  were 
1.005  and  1.007,  respectively,  suggesting  a  less  than  1%  increase  in  exposure  to  repaglinide  when 
concomitantly  given  with  lenvatinib.  The  results  of  these  simulations  suggested  no  DDI  risk  between 
lenvatinib and repaglinide, even at supratherapeutic doses. 
•  Warfarin 
Regarding R-Warfarin and CYP3A4: Lenvatinib is a reversible inhibitor of CYP3A4 with inhibition constants (Ki 
and Ki´) of 106.4 µmol/L and 57.0 µmol/L, respectively. These constants were derived using a complex type 
inhibition  model  (Study  No.  B03023).  For  enterocytes  and  according  to  the  EMA  Guideline  on  the 
Investigation of Drug Interactions, the [I]/Ki was calculated to be 3.9 (24-mg QD dose) using the lower Ki of 
57  µmol/L.  As  the  [I]/Ki  was  less  than  10,  DDI  is  not  considered  a  concern  for  the  CYP3A4  reversible 
inhibition in enterocytes. 
Regarding  the  systemic  circulation  relevant  CYP3A4  reversible  inhibition  DDI  concern,  the  [I]/Ki  was 
calculated to be 0.0004 using Cmax,ss of 518 ng/mL (Study E7080-J081-105) at the maximum clinical dose 
(24 mg QD) and fu of 0.02 and the lower Ki of 57 µmol/L. As this calculated [I]/Ki value was much less than 
0.02, there is no DDI concern for the CYP3A4 reversible inhibition in the systemic circulation. 
Lenvatinib also exhibited weak time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A with kinact of 0.0835 minutes-1, and Ki of 
72.266  µmol/L  (Study  PK-TEST-0040).  Based  on  the  physiologically  based  modeling  of  the  CYP3A4  probe 
substrate  midazolam  (Study  DMPKA2013-156),  lenvatinib  did  not  significantly  inhibit  CYP3A4.  Effects  on 
warfarin  pharmacologic  effect  via  this  mechanism  would  be  trivial  (lower  potency  enantiomer  marginally 
affected). 
Lenvatinib only slightly increased CYP3A4 mRNA expression (Study XT063020) and thus is not an inducer of 
CYP3A4 (He et al., 1997). 
Regarding R-Warfarin and CYP1A2: The in vitro data indicated lenvatinib neither inhibits nor induces CYP1A2 
(Study XT063020, Study B03023, and Study PK-Test-0079).  
Regarding S-Warfarin, and CYP2C9: Lenvatinib neither inhibits nor induces CYP2C9 (Study XT063020, Study 
B03023, and Study PK-Test-0079).

Levothyroxine 
Thyroxine is generally administered to subjects with DTC or medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) as standard of 
care. In contrast, thyroxine is not generally administered to subjects with other solid tumor types. The PK 
parameters of lenvatinib were similar in subjects with DTC and MTC compared to subjects with other solid 
tumor types (CPMS-E7080-007R-v1). This indicated thyroxine did not affect lenvatinib PK.

In study E7080-G000-205, based on the dose-normalized Cmax and AUC(0-24), the mean everolimus Cmax 
was  approximately  30%  greater  in  the  combination  arm  compared  with  the  everolimus  monotherapy  arm. 
The  mean  AUC(0-24)  of  everolimus  was  approximately  50%  higher  in  the  combination  arm  compared  with 
the  everolimus  arm.  Several  methodological  flaws  were  noted  that  prevent  to  draw  a  clear  conclusion  with 
regards  to  the  possible  PK  interaction  between  everolimus  and  lenvatinib  (small  number  of  subjects  who 
contributed  to  PK  data  in  study  205,  the  only  intergroup  comparison,  the  fact  that  everolimus  is  a  narrow 
therapeutic  index  drug  with  highly  variable  PK).  Further  exploration  on  the  potential  interaction  between 
lenvatinib and everolimus is still needed and comprehensive data collected in a manner permitting adequate 
characterization of PK drug-drug interactions between lenvatinib and everolimus will be provided at the time 
of  submission  of  results  of  pop  PK  analysis  of  post  marketing  studies  (218  and  307)  data.  The  company  is 
requested to ensure that data will be. Studies 218 and 307 are included in the RMP.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Lenvatinib  is  a  small  molecule  that  inhibits  multiple  receptor  tyrosine  kinases  (RTKs)  implicated  in 
angiogenesis,  tumour  growth  and  metastatic  progression.  The  most  sensitive  kinases  for  lenvatinib  include 
VEGFR (VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4)), RET,  fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors 
(FGFR1,  2,  3,  and  4),  the  platelet  derived  growth  factor  (PDGF)  receptor  PDGFRα,  and  KIT.  The  precise 
mechanism of action of lenvatinib is not elucidated, but its anti-angiogenic activity appears to be its primary 
effect, while anti-proliferative activity is rather limited at least in in vitro assays (see non-clinical section). 
Rationale  for  Development  of  Combination  Lenvatinib/Everolimus  for  Unresectable,  Advanced  or  Metastatic 
Renal Cell Carcinoma 
The scientific rationale for combining lenvatinib (an RTK inhibitor) and everolimus (an mTOR inhibitor) was to 
target  angiogenesis  and  tumour  cell  survival,  as  well  as  to  escape  resistance mechanisms  to  antiangiogenic 
therapy.    The  dual  targeting  of  the  mitogen  activated  kinase  (MAPK)  and  mTOR-S6K-S6  pathways  by 
lenvatinib  and  everolimus  may  contribute  towards  the  increased  anti-tumour  activity  of  the  combination 
compared to each agent alone.   
Angiogenesis  has  been  identified  as  a  key  factor  in  the  development  of  RCC.  VEGF  is  a  crucial  regulator  of 
both  physiologic  and  pathologic  angiogenesis,  and  increased  expression  of  VEGF  is  associated  with  a  poor 
prognosis  in  many  human  tumour  types,  including  RCC.  Accumulated  evidence  suggests  that  fibroblast 
growth factor (FGF) and its receptor tyrosine kinase, FGFR, also play a role in angiogenesis and contribute to 
the  aggressiveness  of  RCC.    Recently,  FGF-induced  angiogenesis  has  also  been  reported  to  be  involved  in 
resistance against anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy; therefore, inhibition of FGF has been postulated to decrease the 
rate of drug resistance to VEGF/VEGFR-targeting agents, but clinical data are limited to date. 
An  alternative  pathway  for  angiogenesis  is  mediated  by  mTOR,  which  is  downstream  of  phosphoinositide 
3-kinase  and  protein  kinase  B  and  is  regulated  by  the  phosphatase  and  tensin  homolog  tumour  suppressor 
gene.  Inhibition of the mTOR pathway can inhibit both angiogenesis and tumour cell proliferation.

Figure 3: Inhibition of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase and mTOR Pathways by Lenvatinib and Everolimus: Proposed 
Mechanism of Action 
Several  studies  indicate  the  lack  of  absolute  cross-resistance  between  TKIs  and  that  sequential  VEGF/VEGR 
TKIs use or sequential use of VEGF/VEGFR TKIs and mTOR inhibitors can provide clinical benefit in mRCC, for 
instance sorafenib-sunitinib sequential trial in patients with mRCC (Sablin, et al., 2009), the use of sunitinib 
after  bevacizumab  (Rini,  et  al.,  2006)  or of  axitinib after  sorafenib  (Rini,  et  al.,  2007).    In  a  Phase  2  study 
comparing sequential first-line everolimus and second-line sunitinib versus first-line sunitinib and second-line 
everolimus  in  patients  with  mRCC,  similar  efficacy  outcomes  were  observed,  favouring  however  sequential 
sunitinib followed by everolimus use (Motzer, et al., 2014). 
Several  trials  have  previously  evaluated  combinations  of  a  VEGF  TKI  with  an  mTOR  inhibitor.  For  clear  cell 
RCC, combinations of TKIs and mTOR inhibitors generally led to earlier onset and more severe toxicity. The 
most  of  studies  for  VEGFRi-mTORi  combinations  reported  high  unacceptable  toxicity  precluding  further 
development.  The  majority  of  studies  did  not  comprehensively  evaluate  the  potential  PD  and/or  PK 
interactions (Patel et al, 2009; Patnaik et al, 2007; Rosenberg et al, 2008; Molina et al, 2012; Poweles et al, 
2014).  
Although not studied directly, the MOA for the worsening of diarrhea with the combination is postulated to be 
mediated  by  the  impairment  of  intestinal  function  related  to  the  MOAs  for  the  individual  agents  – 
VEGF/VEGFR and c-KIT inhibition by lenvatinib coupled with mTOR/NHE3 inhibition by everolimus. (see SmPC 
section  5.1)  Mechanisms  for  other  potential  worsening  of  AEs  (e.g.  renal  events,  electrolyte  abnormalities, 
constitutional symptoms) are suggested (Launay-Vacher et al. 2015).  
The PD interactions have not been studied in the pivotal study 205. The underlying mechanisms of observed 
toxicity of the lenvatinib-everolimus combination may at least in part be due to PD interactions and enhanced 
inhibition  of  downstream  targets  of  signaling  pathways  (e.g.  mTOR  pathway).  As  observed  in  non-clinical 
studies, lenvatinib inhibited the VEGF- and FGF-driven angiogenic signaling by the MAPK and mTOR-S6K- S6 
pathways. The inhibition of the mTOR pathway was enhanced by the combination with everolimus, indicating 
potential for worsening of adverse reactions associated with everolimus (see non-clinical part).

Primary pharmacology 
The  binding  of  lenvatinib  to  a  panel  of  50  non-kinase  receptors  known  to  play  significant  biological  roles 
(ExpresSProfile) was evaluated in vitro at concentrations of 1 and 10 μmol/L.  No significant binding (>50% 
inhibition) to any receptor of the ExpresSProfile was observed at the tested concentrations, except for the 5-
hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (58%) and human norepinephrine transporter (50%) at 10 μmol/L. 
In human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) models, lenvatinib inhibited 2 important intracellular signal 
pathways  for  angiogenesis:    mitogen  activated  kinase  (MAPK)  and  the  PI3K/AKT/mTOR-S6K-S6  signal 
transduction pathway (hereafter referred to as mTOR-S6K-S6) (see figure 2 above).  These 2 pathways are 
triggered  by  activated  VEGFR  and  FGFR.    Since  cross-talk  between  the  VEGF-signalling  pathway  and  the 
FGF-signalling  pathway  possibly  accelerates  angiogenesis  in  the  tumour,  this  mode  of  dual  inhibition  by 
lenvatinib may more effectively inhibit tumour angiogenesis.  The anti-tumour activity of lenvatinib may also 
stem from a direct inhibitory effect on cellular growth of some tumours. 
Mammalian  target  of  rapamycin  (mTOR)  is  a  serine/threonine  kinase  involved  in  integrating  growth  factor-
activated  and  nutrient-sensing  signals  that  regulate  diverse  cellular  processes,  including  growth,  survival, 
differentiation,  autophagy,  and  metabolism.  The  mTOR  kinase  exerts  its  effects  through  the  regulation  of 
protein synthesis.  Stimulation of the mTORC1 complex also results in increased VEGF-induced angiogenesis 
via  activation  of  hypoxia-inducible  factor 1α.  The  deregulation  of  mTOR  signalling  has  been  implicated  in  a 
number of cancer types. 
Everolimus  is  an  oral  rapamycin  analogue.  Everolimus  inhibits  mTOR  kinase  activity  downstream  of  the 
PI3K/AKT  pathway  by  forming  a  complex  with  an  intracellular  protein,  FKBP-12.  This  results  in  inhibition  of 
mTORC1 and loss of mTORC1 substrate interactions.  In addition, everolimus inhibits the expression of HIF-1 
and reduces the expression of VEGF.   
Inhibition  of  several  kinases  is  thought  to  contribute  to  anti-tumor  activity  of  lenvatinib  and  to  its  toxicity. 
Pharmacodynamic  properties  relative  to  efficacy  and  safety  of  lenvatinib  are  expected  to  be  based  on  its 
mechanism of action (inhibition of VEGFRs, FGFRs and PDGFRs). The safety profile of lenvatinib in patients is 
largely  similar  to  other  VEGFR-targeting  TKIs  with  hypertension  and  proteinuria  being  the  most  prominent 
adverse  reactions.  Inhibition  of  several types of  tyrosine  kinases  (VEGFRs,  FGFRs,  PDGFRs)  may  potentially 
contribute towards the embryotoxicity observed after administration of lenvatinib to pregnant animals during 
organogenesis  and  towards  impaired  wound  healing.  FGFR  inhibition  causes  antiangiogenic  effects  and 
therefore embryotoxic/teratogenic effects are possible safety concerns in treatment with FGFR inhibitors (see 
non-clinical  aspects  and  SmPC  section  5.3).  Increased  inorganic  phosphorus  can  occur  as  a  result  of  FGFR 
inhibition  and  hyperphosphatemia  is  a  known  FGFR-inhibition  associated  safety  signal  given  that  FGFR1c 
signaling in the kidney regulates phosphate reabsorption and calcium homeostasis upon binding to a ligand, 
FGF-23 (Tacer, et al, 2010; Javier, et al, 2012; Kharitonenkov, et al., 2009; Lanske, et al, 2013). 
Lenvatinib  has  also  activity  against  PDGFR  tyrosine  kinases  although  the  IC50s  were  lower  for  PDGFRβ. 
PDGFRα  is  expressed  on  vascular  smooth  muscle  cells  and  pericytes  surrounding  vascular  endothelial  cells, 
and  has  roles  for  stabilizing  newly  formed  vasculature.  Inhibition  of  PDGFRα  may  contribute  towards  the 
antiangiogenic activity of lenvatinib and cardiotoxicity.

Genetic differences in PD response 
Genotyping was performed in relation to metabolism of lenvatinib. Subject phenotype was determined using 
data  derived  from  the  Affymetrix  drug  metabolizing  enzyme  and  transporter  (DMET  Plus®)  microarray 
genotyping platform based on DNA extracted from human whole blood from consenting study subjects (both 
healthy volunteers and subjects with thyroid tumors; report CPMS-E7080-007pheno). 
The  enzymes  chosen  were  ones  for  which  a  clear  phenotype  could  be  assigned  to  the  SNP  data,  and,  had 
been  identified  pre-clinically  as  being  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  lenvatinib  (CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP3A4, 
CYP3A5)  or  of  as  potential  interest  (CYP2C19,  study  E7080-E044-104).  Exposure  data  (steady  state  AUC 
normalized  to  a  24  mg  dose)  were  determined  from  a  previously  developed  population  PK  model  for 
lenvatinib  (CPMS-E7080-007R).  None  of  the  phenotypes  of  CYP1A2,  CYP3A5,  CYP2A6  or  CYP2C19  have  a 
significant impact on lenvatinib clearance. For the CYP3A4 phenotypes, 450 subjects from a total of 476 were 
classified as extensive metabolizers and 26 as unknown, therefore no correlative analyses was possible. 
Genetic  biomarkers  (genetic  constitutional  variants  in  the  VEGF  pathway)  could  guide  patient  selection  for 
treatment with the anti-VEGFR therapy. Higher responses to angiogenic drugs have been reported in familial 
VHL  (von  Hippel-Lindau)  syndrome  cases  (i.e.  RCC  with  germline  VHL  mutations).  Given  that  loss  of  VHL 
expression in tumours is the most frequent molecular event in RCC. Choueri et al (2008) found that patients 
with an alteration of the VHL gene had a better response to anti-VEGF therapy. 
Planned  assessment  in  the  Phase  2  study  205  included  biomarker  discovery  and/or  validation  of  blood  or 
tumor  biomarkers  that  may  be  useful  to  predict  subject  response  to  study  drug,  evaluation  of  response-
related  and/or  safety-related  outcomes  as  well  as  for  potential  use  in  diagnostic  development.  Glen  et  al 
(2015)  concluded  based  on  the  results  of  the  submitted  Phase  2  study  that  elevated  levels  of  VEGF  and 
FGF23  confirmed  lenvatinib  target  inhibition.  Further  studies  on  post-treatment  changes  in  FGF23  levels  in 
everolimus  and 
the  combination  were  considered  warranted.  The  OS  benefit  observed  with 
lenvatinib/everolimus  combination  in  the  high-baseline  ANG2  subgroup  suggested  a  potentially  unique 
response,  overcoming  this  otherwise  poor  prognostic  characteristic.  A  complete  report  with  results  of  these 
serum  biomarker  and  pharmacogenetic  studies  will  be  submitted  by  the  Applicant  within  6  moths  post-
marketing (recommendation). 
Secondary pharmacology 
QT assessment 
In the clinical program, a thorough QT study was performed (E7080-A001-002). This study was conducted in 
52  healthy  volunteers.  This  was  a  single  center,  single-dose,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled, 
three  treatment, three–way  crossover  study  (each  a  14-day  period)  conducted  to  evaluate  the potential for 
QT/QTc  prolongation  by  32  mg  lenvatinib  using  a  placebo  control  and  moxifloxacin  (Avelox  400  mg)  as  the 
positive control. 
The  QTcF  change  from  baseline  (ΔΔQTcF)  was  evaluated  from  serial  electrocardiograms.  The  relationship 
between lenvatinib plasma concentration and QTcF was analysed with linear mixed-effects modeling. 
50  subjects  completed  the  study.  Two  subjects  withdrew  consent  prior  to  completion.  The  mean  age  of 
subjects was 34 (SD = 13.8) years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 67/162 
  
  
 
 
 
Lenvatinib  plasma  concentrations  were  measured;  the  peak  plasma  level  (arithmetic  mean  ±  SD)  of  417  ± 
201.8 ng/ml was observed at a median of 3.0 h. At this plasma level, the change in QTcF is projected to – 
4.83  msec  (90%  CI  -6.12  to  –  3.53).  The  median  half-life  was  21.3  h.  Mean  peak  plasma  levels  of 
moxifloxacin reached 3.2 μg/ml and were observed at a median of 2.0 h after dosing. 
Following  administration  of  a  single  32  mg  dose,  lenvatinib  did  not  exert  a  clinically  relevant  effect  on 
ΔΔQTcF.  A  small  QTc  shortening  effect  was  observed  and  QTc  prolongation  exceeding  10  ms  could  be 
confidently excluded. The mean ΔΔQTcF was negative at all time points postdosing with the exception of 23.5 
hours and the upper bound of the CI did not exceed 2 ms at any time point. Concentration effect modeling 
suggested lenvatinib does not cause QTc prolongation at clinically relevant, high plasma levels. 
In  the  phase  3  study  303  in  DTC  patients,  QT/QTc  interval  prolongation  has  been  reported  at  a  higher 
incidence in patients treated with lenvatinib than in patients treated with placebo (see SmPC section 5.1 for 
Lenvima).  QTc  prolongation  is  currently  considered  as  an  important  potential  risk  addressed  in  the  Risk 
Management  plan.  Post-marketing  data  from  patients  in  DTC  showed  new  cases  with  positive  dechallenge. 
The electrocardiogram data from the Study 205 do show more cases of maximum QT increase from baseline 
(> 60 msec) and of maximum postbaseline value (> 500 msec) when lenvatinib is combined with everolimus, 
compared  with  lenvatinib  alone.  However,  the  QTcF  values  were  machine-read.  Furthermore,  no  case  of 
torsades de pointes was reported, and no subject discontinued the drugs because of this event.   
Given totality of data collected in patients in different indications and uncertainty regarding the effects of the 
combination  (lenvatinib/everolimus)  on  QTc  due  to  the  limited  number  of  patients  exposed  to  date,  the 
Applicant comitted to collect ECG data in further studies and to perform a concentration-response analysis for 
QTc in order to have a better understanding of the impact of the combination on QTc. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Relationships  between  lenvatinib,  everolimus  and  the  lenvatinib/everolimus  combination  and  efficacy  and 
safety endpoints in RCC were explored using Population PK/PD analysis.  
The  following  efficacy  endpoints  were  explored:    progression  free  survival  (PFS),  overall  survival  (OS), 
objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), durable stable disease 
rate, and tumor shrinkage.  
The  following  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAE)  were  considered:  hypertension  [during  cycle  1], 
proteinuria,  fatigue,  decreased  appetite,  diarrhoea,  nausea,  vomiting,  renal  events,  hypertriglyceridaemia 
and hyperglycaemia. 
For each of the adverse events in the DTC submission including hypertension, the main analyses were based 
on data from Phase 3 Study 303, and binary logistic regression analysis was used. In all clinical studies with 
lenvatinib  conducted  to  date,  including  DTC  and  RCC,  blood  pressure  readings  showed  pronounced  diurnal 
patterns.    The  time  of  day  of  blood  pressure  measurement  is  important  in  fitting  indirect  response  model; 
however, the time of blood pressure measurement was not recorded in Study 205.  Moreover, the effect of 
concomitant  antihypertensive  therapy  needs  to  be  considered  in  the  complex  indirect  model  using  all  the 
available  blood  pressure  data.    However,  most  subjects  (78.7%)  in  the  RCC  Safety  Set  took  concomitant 
antihypertensive therapy, which included a wide range of drugs, multiple classes of antihypertensive therapy, 
and  combinations  of  drugs.    Thus,  the  doses  of  each  drug  or  class  are  not  directly  comparable.  Moreover, 
antihypertensive  treatment  is  highly  individualized,  with  each  subject  responding  differently  to  the  same 
dose.    Hence,  the  simple  binary  logistic  regression  model  for  hypertension  as  AE  was  used.  In  order  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016

minimize  the  bias  from  concomitant  antihypertensive  therapy  in  the  exposure-response  relationship  for 
lenvatinib-related hypertension, data from the first 28 days (1 cycle) only were selected. 
Data  were  not  collected  in  a  manner  permitting  more  adequate  modelling  for  toxicity  endpoints  such  as 
hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycaemia. Empirical binary regression analysis as performed by 
the applicant is more suitable for descriptive purpose than for predictive use. They can only be acceptable in 
case  there  is  no  possibility  to  have  more  informative  data  as  for  fatigue,  nausea,  decreased  appetite,  and 
renal  events.  The  Applicant  is  therefore  strongly  advised  to  collect  (systolic  and  diastolic)  blood  pressure, 
triglyceridemia  (and  cholesterolemia),  and  glycaemia  data  in  an  appropriate  manner  that  will  allow 
developing predictive models with these endpoints modelled as continuous variables within study 218. 
The  impact  of  everolimus  exposure  on  the  different  endpoints  will  be  assessed  in  a  more  robust  manner  in 
future studies with the combination therapy of lenvatinib and everolimus (Studies 218 and 307). 
The data that has been provided does not allow excluding a possible drug-drug interaction between lenvatinib 
and  everolimus.  The  power  analysis  using  clinical  trial  simulations  tools  for  example  would  be  a  convincing 
evidence to show that the available data would allow detecting drug-drug interactions when applicable. The 
applicant  is  advised  to  perform  power  analysis  as  part  of  study  design  for  study  218.  This  study  will  be 
designed  in  a  manner  permitting  appropriate  characterization  of  interactions  between  lenvatinib  and 
everolimus if present. 
PK/PD analyses for efficacy biomarkers and endpoints 
In  regard  to  PK/PD  analyses  for  efficacy  biomarkers  and  endpoints,  planned  assessment  in  the  proposed 
Phase  2  study  218  will  include  the  analysis  the  exposure  (to  everolimus  and  lenvatinib)-biomarkers-clinical 
endpoint  relationships  for  drug  efficacy  and  safety  using  integrative  models  and  mechanism-based 
approaches  supported  by  the  knowledge  about  the  disease  pathophysiology  and  the  drug  pharmacology  in 
order to provide better insight into doses selection that would allow an optimal benefit-risk ratio. 
A  binary  logistic  model  for  any  adverse  event  leading  to  drug  interruption,  reduction  or  discontinuation  as 
well as an Emax model for tumor growth inhibition model by lenvatinib and everolimus has been developed 
using  data  from  RCC  subjects  from  Study  205.  The  developed  models  were  then  used  to  simulate  AEs  and 
percentage  of  reduction  in  tumor  size  profiles  and,  subsequently,  overall  response  rate  at  6  months  for 
different doses of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus 5 mg for dose selection in a planned study 218.   
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics 
There  is  strong  biologic  rationale  supported  by  available  non-clinical  data  for  combining  VEGF  receptor 
blockade by lenvatinib with mTOR inhibition by everolimus in the treatment of patients with metastatic RCC. 
Downstream  signal  transduction  inhibition  of  the  PTEN/Akt/mTOR  pathway  by  everolimus  may  complement 
upstream  VEGF  receptor  inhibition  by  either  simple  additive  effects  when  both  targets  are  inhibited  or  by 
downstream blockade of pathways if there is partial resistance to receptor inhibition. 
PD biomarkers for efficacy and safety and PD interactions between lenvatinib and everolimus will be further 
investigated in Studies 218 and 307.

Pharmacokinetics 
Several  methodological  flaws  prevent  to  draw  a  clear  conclusion  with  regards to  the possible  PK interaction 
between  everolimus  and  lenvatinib.  Further  exploration  on  the  potential  interaction  between  lenvatinib  and 
everolimus is needed and comprehensive data should be provided at the time of submission of results of pop 
PK analysis of post marketing studies (218 and 307) data.  
This study 218 will evaluate PK interactions between lenvatinib and everolimus. It will also establish 
exposure-safety and exposure-efficacy relationships and better inform the choice of the optimal starting 
dose, the results of the integrated and mechanism-based PK/PD modelling should be submitted at the time of 
submission of the CSR. Data will be collected in a manner permitting adequate characterization of PK drug-
drug interactions between lenvatinib and everolimus (see RMP). 
Data from Study 307 will contribute to PK and PD analyses (see RMP). 
In addition, as also required for Lenvima, an in vivo study (Study 109) with midazolam as a probe substrate 
for  CYP3A4  will  assess  the  lenvatinib  potential  for  CYP3A4  induction/inhibition,  including  time-dependency 
inhibition.  This  is  an  Open-Label  Phase  1  Study  to  Determine  the  Effect  of  Lenvatinib  (E7080)  on  the 
Pharmacokinetics of Midazolam, a CYP3A4 Substrate, in subjects with Advanced Solid Tumours (see RMP). 
In  line  with  the  Lenvima  MA,  no  adjustment  of  starting  dose  is  required  in  patients  with  mild  or  moderate 
renal  impairment  and  no  adjustment  of  starting  dose  is  required  in  patients  with  mild  (Child-Pugh  A)  or 
moderate  (Child-Pugh  B) hepatic impairment.  However  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic or  renal  impairment, 
the recommended starting dose of lenvatinib should be reduced to 10 mg (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).  
The following dose recommendation for hepatic impaired patients is provided in section 4.2 of the SmPC: “No 
data with the combination is available in patients with hepatic impairment. No adjustment of starting dose of 
the combination is required on the basis of hepatic function in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate 
(Child-Pugh  B)  hepatic  impairment.  In  patients  with  severe  (Child-Pugh  C)  hepatic  impairment,  the 
recommended  starting  dose  of  lenvatinib  is  10 mg  taken  once  daily  in  combination  with  the  dose  of 
everolimus recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment in the everolimus SmPC.  Further dose 
adjustments  may  be  necessary  on  the  basis  of  individual  tolerability.  The  combination  should  be  used  in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment only if the anticipated benefit exceeds the risk.”   
The following statement is provided in section 4.2 of the SmPC: “No adjustment of starting dose is required 
on  the  basis  of  renal  function  in  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  renal  impairment.    In  patients  with  severe 
renal impairment, the recommended starting dose is 10 mg of lenvatinib with 5 mg of everolimus taken once 
daily.  Further  dose  adjustments  may  be  necessary based  on individual tolerability.    Patients  with  end-stage 
renal disease were not studied, therefore the use of lenvatinib in these patients is not recommended”. 
In subjects with hepatic and with renal impairment it is unknown whether there is a change in the plasma 
protein binding. The correct determination of unbound drug concentrations should be provided to define the 
appropriate dose-adjustment in patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment   
Hence, in order to define correctly the dose-adjustment in patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment, 
the MAH should conduct and submit the results of Study E7080-A001-010 (entitled "A Multicenter Phase 0 
Study In Healthy Subjects As Well As Subjects With Either Hepatic Or Renal Impairment To Obtain Plasma To 
Assess In Vitro Lenvatinib Protein Binding") as reflected in the RMP (see section 2.7).

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In  conclusion,  pharmacokinetics  of  lenvatinib  has  been  investigated  to  an  acceptable  extent.  Overall,  the 
potential  for  in  vivo  DDI  with  lenvatinib  can  be  considered  as  low.  In  vitro,  it  was  shown  that  lenvatinib 
inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2C8, UGT1A4, UGT1A1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OAT1, OAT3 but clinical relevant inhibition can 
be excluded. 
Pharmacology 
The  potential  interaction  between  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  requires  further  exploration  to  address 
uncertainties from the available data. The applicant will therefore submit the results of:  
- Study 218 will allow to assess two dosing regimens, PK and PK/PD of the two drugs and related drug-drug 
interactions  between  lenvatinib  and  everolimus.  It  will  also  establish  exposure-safety  and  exposure-efficacy 
relationships  and  better  inform  the  choice  of  the  optimal  starting  dose.  The  protocol  and  the  data  analysis 
plan for PK/PD should be submitted by November 2016. The results of the integrated and mechanism-based 
PK/PD modelling should be submitted at the time of submission of the CSR. Please section 2.7 of the RMP. 
- Study 307 will allow to further characterize PK and PK/PD of the two drugs and related interactions and to 
contribute to integrated and mechanism-based PK/PD modelling. The protocol and the data analysis plan for 
PK/PD should be submitted by November 2016. Please see section 2.7 of the RMP. 
-  Study  109  is  requested  to  assess  the  lenvatinib  potential  for  CYP3A4  induction/inhibition,  including  time-
dependency  inhibition  (with  midazolam  as  a  probe  substrate  for  CYP3A4).  This  is  an  Open-Label  Phase  1 
Study  to  Determine  the  Effect  of  Lenvatinib  (E7080)  on  the  Pharmacokinetics  of  Midazolam,  a  CYP3A4 
substrate, in subjects with advanced Solid Tumors. Please see section 2.7 of the RMP. 
In subjects with severe hepatic and renal impairment it is unknown whether there is a change in the plasma 
protein binding and what are the potential implications regarding dose-adjustment. The applicant will submit 
the results of Study 010, a multicenter Phase 0 study in healthy subjects as well as subjects with either 
hepatic or renal impairment to obtain plasma samples, to assess in vitro Lenvatinib protein binding and to 
determe unbound drug concentrations in order to define correctly the dose-adjustment in patients with 
severe hepatic and renal impairment (see RMP).  
Pharmacodynamics 
The  pharmacodynamic  biomarkers  for  efficacy  and  safety  and  PD  interactions  will  be  further  explored  in 
planned studies (studies 307 and 218).

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Four  Phase  1  studies  (E7080  E044-101,  E7080-A001-102,  E7080-J081-103,  and  E7080-J081-105)  were 
conducted  to  determine  the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  of  lenvatinib  and  the  optimal  frequency  of 
administration. These studies looked at administration of lenvatinib on its own (monotherapy). 
The main study supporting the proposed indication, the study E7080-G000-205, had a Phase 1b part and a 
Phase-2 part. Dose escalation was performed, during the Phase 1b part of the study, to determine the MTD 
of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus. The Phase 2 part of the study 205 compare the combination of 
lenvatinib  with  everolimus  against  the  use  of  lenvatinib  on  its  own  and  everolimus  on  its  own  in  the 
treatment of unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Lenvatinib Monotherapy 
Four  Phase  1  dose-finding  studies  (E7080-E044-101  (Study  101),  E7080-A001-102  (Study  102),  E7080-
J081-103  (Study  103)  and  E7080-J081-105  (Study  105))  were  conducted  to  determine  the  maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of lenvatinib and the optimal dosing regimen. These studies examined escalating doses 
of lenvatinib administered QD or BID using continuous and interrupted dosing schedules.   
Study 101 
In Study 101, escalating doses of lenvatinib from 0.2 to 32 mg were given QD in continuous 28-day cycles to 
82  subjects  with  advanced  solid  tumours.    In  this  study,  the  MTD  was  determined  to  be  25  mg  QD.  
Proteinuria was the dose limiting toxicity.  
Study 102 
Study  102  (monotherapy  portion)  was  a  dose  escalation  study  with  2  dosing  schedules  (Schedule  1  -  dose 
escalation  from  0.1  mg  BID  to  3.2  mg  BID  in  a  7  days  on/7  days  off  schedule;  then  Schedule  2  -  dose 
escalation  from  3.2  mg  BID  to  12  mg  BID  with  continuous  daily  dosing).    The  study  was  conducted  in  77 
subjects  with  solid  tumours  or  resistant/refractory  lymphomas.  The  MTD  was  determined  to  be  10  mg  BID 
with continuous dosing.   
Study 103 
Study 103 was a dose escalation study (0.5 to 20 mg BID) in which 27 subjects with advanced solid tumours 
were treated with lenvatinib BID in a 2 week on/1 week off schedule.  In Study 103, the MTD was determined 
to be 13 mg BID. For lenvatinib monotherapy, the MTD from Study 101 (25 mg QD) correlated with a higher 
drug  exposure  (Cmax,  AUC)  compared  with  the  MTD  from  Study  102  (10  mg  BID)  and  was  chosen  for 
monotherapy  to  allow  maximum  anti-tumour  activity  with  a  degree  of  hypertension  controllable  by 
administration of antihypertensive therapy. To simplify drug administration, a dosage of 24 mg QD (two 10 
mg  capsules  plus  one  4-mg  capsule)  was  selected  as  the  dose  for  continued  development  of  lenvatinib 
monotherapy. 
Study 105 
Study 105 was a study in 9 Japanese patients with solid tumours resistant to standard therapies. No dose-
limiting toxicities were reported in either the 20-mg or 24-mg QD group on a once daily dose schedule.

Lenvatinib Combination with Everolimus (Phase 1b of study E7080-G000-205) 
The primary objective of Phase 1b part of study 205 was to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and 
the  maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  of  lenvatinib  plus  everolimus,  and  establish  the  optimal  recommended 
Phase 2 (RP2) dose for the combination.  
The  dose  for  initiating  combination  therapy  was  a  half  of  the  recommended  single-agent  dose  for  each 
compound in RCC indication and in DTC indication; that is respectively, half of 10 mg everolimus dose (5 mg) 
and half of 24 mg lenvatinib dose (12 mg). Priority in terms of escalating dose was given to lenvatinib based 
on  data  from  previous  Phase  1  studies  of  lenvatinib  in  which  subjects  with  metastatic  RCC  demonstrated  a 
median PFS of approximately 9 months. The majority of these subjects (8 of 9) had already shown disease 
progression after prior anticancer medication. Of the 9 subjects treated, 5 (55%) achieved a PR and a further 
single subject (11%) had an unconfirmed PR when treated with lenvatinib.  
The dose of lenvatinib was planned to be escalated sequentially (12 mg → 18 mg → 24 mg) in combination 
with a dose of everolimus of 5 mg or 10 mg (only with 24 mg lenvatinib) in subsequent cohorts.  
The dose escalations were planned to proceed as shown in Figure 4 below. 
Figure 4: Phase 1b dose escalation design 
A total of 20 subjects were enrolled across 3 cohorts, no recruitment occurred in Cohort 4. 
Overall, four (4) subjects had DLTs as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 73/162 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
-  Cohort  1:    one  subject  with  Grade  3  abdominal  pain  out  of  7  treated  subjects  (n=1).  As  of  the  first  3 
subjects enrolled one subject had a DLT, per dose escalation scheme, 3 more subjects were enrolled. There 
was no further DLT in this cohort. One subject had progressive disease early during Cycle 1 of treatment, was 
discontinued, and was replaced by another subject.   
- Cohort 2: one subject with failure to administer >75% of planned dose, due to intolerable Grade 2 fatigue 
associated with Grade 1 GI reflux and Grade 1 anorexia out of 11 treated subjects. This occurred during the 
Cohort  2  expansion  to  confirm  MTD  and  RP2  (n=1).  Of  the  first  3  subjects  enrolled  into  this  cohort,  none 
experienced a DLT allowing enrolment into the next dose level. Subsequent the outcome of Cohort 3, Cohort 
2 was expanded to treat 8 more subjects. 
-  Cohort  3:  both  of  the  first  2  enrolled  subjects  had  DLTs;  one  subject  with  Grade  3  nausea  and  vomiting, 
and one subject with failure to administer >75 % of the planned dose of study medication, due to intolerable 
Grade 2 stomatitis (n=2). Further enrolment of subjects was stopped in Cohort 3.  
Testing the dose level Cohort 4 i.e. everolimus 10 mg in combination with lenvatinib 24 mg was considered 
not feasible. 
The dose received by Cohort 2 subjects, i.e. lenvatinib 18 mg QD + everolimus 5 mg QD, was determined by 
to be both the MTD and the RP2 dose for the subsequent Phase 2 part of Study 205.  
2.5.2.  Main study 
Phase 2 part of Study E7080-G000-205 
The Phase 2 part of Study 205 was designed as an open-label, three-arm, randomized and controlled trial.  
Eligible  subjects  were  randomized  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  receive  in  either  lenvatinib  in  combination  with 
everolimus  combination  (Arm  A),  lenvatinib  monotherapy  (Arm  B),  or  everolimus  monotherapy  (Arm  C). 
Description of the study and its design are provided in Table 21 above and Figure 5 below. 
Methods 
Both  the  Phase  1b  and  Phase  2  portions  of  the  study  included  a  Pre-treatment  Phase,  a  Treatment  Phase, 
and an Extension Phase.

Figure 5: Study design 
Tumour  assessments  using  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in  Solid  Tumours  (RECIST)  1.1  were  performed 
during the Pre-randomization Phase and then every 8 weeks (or sooner if there was evidence of progressive 
disease)  during  the  Treatment  Phase,  and  in  the  Extension  Phase  by  the  Investigator-determined  response 
assessments  at  each  time  point  and  represent  the  basis  for  the  primary  analysis  of  efficacy.    As  per 
agreement  with  the  FDA  and  EMA,  a  post-hoc  independent,  blinded  review  of  radiology  assessments  was 
performed to support the primary analysis of the Phase 2 portion of the study.  The Treatment Phase ended 
at the data cut-off date for the primary efficacy analysis (13 Jun 2014).  Subjects who were receiving study 
medication  at  the  time  of  the  data  cut-off  continued  to  receive  the  same  treatment  during  the  Extension 
Phase.  Once the subjects were off treatment, they were followed for survival every 8 weeks. Subjects who 
discontinued study treatment before disease progression continued to undergo tumour assessments every 8 
weeks until documentation of disease progression or start of another anticancer therapy. Subjects who were 
being followed for survival at the time of data cut-off (i.e. at the end of the Randomization Phase) continued 
to be followed for survival during the Follow-up Period of the Extension Phase.

Treatments 
The  RP2  dose  determined  in  the  Phase  1b  part  of  the  study  was  further  investigated  in  the  open-label, 
randomized Phase 2 part, in which eligible subjects were randomized into 3 arms in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive:  
1)  18 mg/day lenvatinib + 5 mg/day everolimus (RP2 dose; combination arm A),  
2) 
lenvatinib 24 mg/day (lenvatinib arm B), or  
3)  everolimus 10 mg/day (everolimus arm C). 
In  both  Phase  1b  and  Phase  2,  lenvatinib  capsules  and  everolimus  tablets  were  self-administered  orally  by 
the  subjects  in  continuous  28-day  cycles.  For  subjects  receiving  combination  therapy,  the  doses  of 
everolimus  and  lenvatinib  were  taken  at  the  same  time.    Dose  interruption,  dose  reduction,  or  treatment 
discontinuation were allowed according to the protocol-specified dose management scheme for subjects who 
experienced lenvatinib toxicity and for subjects in the combination arm who experienced everolimus toxicity.  
Subjects  who  experienced  everolimus-related  toxicity  in  the  everolimus  arm  had  dose  adjustments 
(temporary dose interruptions and no dose reduction below 5 mg) according to prescribing information. 
Prior therapy: see ‘Baseline data’ subsection 
Concomitant therapy 
All subjects received at least 1 concomitant medication. 
Concomitant antihypertensive medications were taken by a higher percentage of subjects in the combination 
and lenvatinib arms (82.4% and 86.5%, respectively) than the everolimus arm (60.0%). The most frequently 
reported  concomitant  antihypertensive  medication  was  amlodipine  (49.0%  combination  arm;  67.3% 
lenvatinib arm; 28.0% everolimus arm).  
Concomitant therapy with the anti-propulsive agent loperamide for diarrhea was highest in the combination 
arm  (58.8%,  30  subjects),  followed  by  the  lenvatinib  arm  (46.2%,  24  subjects),  and  was  lowest  in  the 
everolimus arm 12.0% (6 subjects).

Concomitant therapy with thyroid preparations was used most often in the combination and lenvatinib arms, 
and  less  often  in  the  everolimus  arm.  Thyroid  Preparations  were  used  in  27  (52.9%),  32  (61.5%)  and  10 
(20.0%), respectively, and levothyroxine in 27 (52.9%), 32 (61.5%) and 10 (20.0%), respectively.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
PFS  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of  first  documentation  of  disease 
progression  or  death  (whichever  occurred  first).    The  PFS  endpoint  was  based  on  investigator  assessments 
using  RECIST  version  1.1.    PFS  censoring  rules  were  based  on  the  FDA  guidelines.    The  date  of  objective 
disease progression was defined as the earliest date of radiological disease progression, as assessed by the 
investigator based on radiographic images. 
The primary comparisons for PFS were the combination arm versus the everolimus arm and the lenvatinib 
arm versus the everolimus arm.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
•  OS defined as the time from the date of randomization until date of death from any cause.  Subjects who 
were lost to follow-up or alive at the date of data cut-off (13 Jun 2014 for the collection of the data for 
Assessment report

the primary outcome measure, 10 Dec 2014 cut-off for the  first OS  update, and 31 Jul 2015 cut-off  for 
the second OS update) were censored at the date the subject was last known alive. 
•  Objective response rate defined as the proportion of subjects who had best overall response of complete 
response or partial response (CR + PR) (assessed by investigators). 
•  Disease control rate (DCR: CR + PR + SD; SD had to be ≥7 weeks after randomization). 
•  Durable SD (SD ≥23 weeks) rate and clinical benefit rate (CBR: CR, PR + durable SD rate). 
• 
Sample size 
For  the  Phase  2  part,  the  primary  basis  for  the  sample  size  determination  was  a  comparison  of  the 
progression-free survival based on the following assumptions.  
The assumed median PFS for everolimus 10 mg was 5 months based on the historical data. A minimum of a 
50% increase  in the  median  PFS  (i.e.,  achieving  a  median  PFS  of  at  least 7.5  months  in the  investigational 
Arms  A  or  B)  relative  to  the  median  PFS  of  5  months  for  everolimus  as  single  agent,  would  be  considered 
worthy  of  further  investigation.  Given  that  there  were  no  prior  clinical  data  available  for the  combination  of 
lenvatinib  plus  everolimus,  and  limited  data  for  lenvatinib  alone  in  the  target  population,  it  was  deemed 
appropriate  to  consider  a  hazard  ratio  (HR)  of  0.67  as  a  clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  PFS.  The 
planned sample size for the primary analysis required a total of at least 90 PFS events to be observed across 
all  3  treatment  groups  and  at  least  60  PFS  events  to  be  observed  for  each  of  the  comparisons  of  the 
combination versus the everolimus arm, and the lenvatinib versus the everolimus arm. PFS events for  each 
of the comparisons of the combination versus the everolimus arm, and the lenvatinib versus the everolimus 
arm  events  were  required  to  detect  a  HR  of  0.67  with  70%  power  using  an  (1-sided)  alpha  of  0.15  for  the 
comparison  of  the  combination  arm  (and  lenvatinib  arm)  versus  the  everolimus  arm.  This  trial  was  not 
designed and powered to primarily investigate differences in OS.  
Sample size rationale for the everolimus/Lenvatinib Phase 2 PK Sub Analysis Set assumed a between-subject 
CV on logarithmically transformed plasma Lenvatinib clearance of 40%. A sample size of 9 to 12 completing 
subjects in each study arm will provide 68% to 80% power to detect a 1.5-fold change in exposure between 
Lenvatinib administered alone and Lenvatinib in combination with everolimus. 
• 
Randomisation 
Randomization was performed centrally by an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) vendor.  
The IVRS randomly assigned eligible subjects in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either lenvatinib 18 mg QD plus 
everolimus 5 mg QD (N=51; combination arm), lenvatinib 24 mg QD (N=52; lenvatinib arm), or everolimus 
10 mg, QD (N=50; everolimus arm).   
Randomisation was stratified by baseline haemoglobin (≤13 g/dL vs >13 g/dL for males and ≤11.5 g/dL vs 
>11.5 g/dL for females) and corrected serum calcium levels (≥10 mg/dL vs <10 mg/dL). 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study; therefore blinding procedures were not applicable.

Statistical methods 
Primary efficacy endpoint: PFS 
The primary efficacy variable was PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of first 
documentation of disease progression or death. The primary PFS was based on investigator review data using 
RECIST  1.1.  As  requested  by  the  FDA  and  EMA,  a  post-hoc  independent,  blinded  review  of  radiology 
assessments was performed to support the primary analysis. 
The  primary  comparisons  for  PFS  were  the  combination  arm  versus  the  everolimus  arm  and  the  lenvatinib 
arm versus the everolimus arm. No multiplicity adjustment was planned at the inception of the study. Each 
null  hypothesis  of  no  difference  in  PFS  was  evaluated  using  the  stratified  log-rank  test,  and  tested  at  a (2-
sided) α=0.05 stratified by haemoglobin level (≤13 g/dL vs >13 g/dL for males and ≤11.5 g/dL vs >11.5 
g/dL for females) and corrected serum calcium (≥10 mg/dL vs <10 mg/dL).  
There  was  no  prespecified  ordering  in  testing  these  hypotheses  and  each  null  hypothesis  was  tested  at  a 
nominal α=0.05. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) estimates were used to estimate the median PFS.  
Hazard ratio (HR) between treatment groups and corresponding 95% CI were estimated using stratified Cox 
regression  model  with  treatment  as  a  factor.  The  Efron  method  was  used  for  correction  for  tied  events. 
Three-month, 6-month, 9-month and 1-year PFS rates were estimated from K-M and corresponding 95% CI 
were  calculated  using  the  Greenwood  formula.  Originally,  a  pre-planned  sensitivity  analysis  to  the  primary 
analysis was planned adjusting for ECOG PS (0 vs.  1) as a factor in the stratified Cox regression model. As 
decided after database lock, sensitivity analysis to the primary analysis was performed with ECOG PS (0 vs 1) 
as  an  additional  stratum  in  the  stratified  Cox  regression  model.  For  subgroup  analyses  of  PFS,  the 
(unstratified) Cox proportional hazard model was used adjusting for treatment and subgroup as factors and 
treatment-by-subgroup  as  an  interaction  term  in  the  model.  The  HR  was  estimated  for  each  treatment 
comparison along with 95% CI. The interaction test across different levels of the subgroup for each treatment 
comparison was also performed by setting up an appropriate contrast for the corresponding interaction test. 
Secondary endpoints: OS, ORR, DCR, CBR, and durable SD 
The  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  OS,  ORR,  DCR,  CBR,  and  durable  SD  (SD  ≥23  weeks).  The  Median 
survival time (OS) and the cumulative probability of survival at 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months were 
calculated  using  K-M  estimates  for  each  treatment  arm  and  presented  with  2-sided  95%  CIs.  K-M  survival 
probabilities  for  each  arm  were  plotted  over  time.  OS  was  measured  from  the  date  of  randomization  until 
date of death from any cause. 
Subjects  who  were  lost  to  follow-up  and  those  who  were  alive  at  the  date  of  data  cut-off  were  censored. 
Planned  analyses  were  performed  to  test  null  hypothesis  of  treatment  difference  in  OS  at  a  nominal 
significance level of 0.05 (2-sided) using the stratified log-rank test using stratification factors. The stratified 
Cox  proportional  hazard  model  was  performed  to  estimate  HR  between  treatment  groups  and  their 
corresponding 95% CI. 
Objective response rate (ORR), DCR, CBR, and durable SD rate were calculated with exact 95% CIs using the 
method  of  Clopper  and  Pearson  Ad-hoc  analyses  were  performed  to  estimate  the  crude  rate  ratio  of  each 
treatment comparison and to compute P values using the Fisher’s exact (2-sided) test..

Results  
• 
Participant flow  
Of the 235 subjects who were screened 82 (34.9%) subjects were screen failures (majority failed to meet 
entry criteria) and 153 (65.1%) subjects were randomly assigned to treatment as follows:  51 subjects with 
combination, 52 subjects with lenvatinib and 50 with everolimus. (see Figure 6 below) 
Figure 6: Flowchart of Subject Disposition in Phase 2 part of Study 205 
• 
Recruitment 
The Phase 2 portion of Study 205 was conducted between 16 March 2012 (when first subject signed informed 
consent) and 13 June 2014 (data cut-off date for the primary analysis). A total of 37 sites were involved: 24 
in Europe (the Czech Republic, Poland, Spain, and the UK) and 13 in the US. 
• 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was dated 19 April 2010. Four protocol amendments were issued until the data cut-off 
date (13 Jun 2014). Amendment 05 (11 Nov 2014) was implemented after the cut-off date for the primary 
analysis; therefore subject data included in the study report of Phase 2 part of the study were not affected. 
The final SAP (dated 20 May 2014) included more technical details regarding the original planned analyses in 
the protocol. 
Overall, 9 major protocol deviations were reported for 9 (5.9%) subjects (2 subjects in the combination arm, 
3 subjects in the lenvatinib arm, and 4 subjects in the everolimus arm). One subject in the lenvatinib arm did 
not have predominant clear cell RCC and 7 subjects (2 in the combination, 2 in the lenvatinib, and 3 in the 
everolimus  arm)  did  not  have  any  brain  scans  performed.  The  remaining  deviation  was  in  a  subject  in  the

everolimus arm who took lenvatinib 10 mg QD for 1 cycle as a result of a dispensing error at the site. This 
major  protocol  deviation  occurred  at  a  site  in  the  UK,  and  was  reported  to  the  Medicines  and  Healthcare 
Products Regulatory Agency on 3 May 2013. The Applicant did not perform the Per Protocol analysis to assess 
the robustness of the primary analysis since the majority of the deviations (7 out of 8 subjects in total) were 
not considered necessary to be excluded from the Per Protocol Analysis Set.

Nephrectomy was reported in the medical history of 135 subjects (88% overall; respectively 86.3%, 82.7% 
and 96% in the combination, lenvatinib and everolimus arms). The proportion of subjects who received prior 
radiotherapy was respectively 11.8%, 21.2% and 22.0% in the combination, lenvatinib and everolimus arms. 
All patients received 1 previous VEGF-targeted therapy and the most frequent agent being sunitinib (64.7%) 
and pazopanib (22.9%). Only 5 subjects received prior treatment with checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD1).

Numbers analysed 
All 153 subjects were treated. Data cut-off occurred as planned on 13 Jun 2014 following the occurrence of 
101 PFS events among the 3 treatment arms, 63 PFS events in the combination versus everolimus arm, and 
75 PFS events in the lenvatinib versus everolimus arm. 
At  the  time  of  data  cut-off,  a  higher  number  of  subjects  in  the  combination  arm  (13;  25.5%)  were  still  on 
treatment  than  in  the  lenvatinib  or  everolimus  arms  (7;  13.5%  and  3;  6.0%,  respectively).  Fewer  subjects 
ended  treatment  due  to  disease  progression  in  the  combination  arm  (19;  37.3%)  and  lenvatinib  arms  (29; 
55.8%) than in the everolimus arm (35; 70.0%). 
As of the date of data cut-off, 69 (45.0%) subjects (31 in the combination arm, 23 in the lenvatinib arm, and 
15  in  the  everolimus  arm)  remained  in  the  study,  including  23  (15.0%)  subjects  who  were  still  receiving 
study treatment.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Progression Free Survival 
Data cut-off date = 13 Jun 2014. 
Hazard ratio is based on a stratified Cox regression model including treatment as a factor and haemoglobin and corrected 
serum calcium as strata.  The Efron method was used for correction for tied events. 
Median PFS is based the Kaplan-Meier method and 95% CI is based on the Greenwood formula using log-log 
transformation.   
Figure 7: Kaplan-Meier Plot of Progression-Free Survival – Full Analysis Set – Study 205 Phase 2 – 
Investigator Assessment 
At the data cutoff of 13 Jun 2014 for the primary analysis, 101 PFS events occurred among the 3 treatment 
arms. Per arm, the primary endpoint PFS analysis is based on 26 PFS events (51%) in the combination arm 
vs. 37 events (74%) for everolimus. For lenvatinib arm, 38 events (73%) were observed. 
The lenvatinib/everolimus combination significantly prolonged PFS compared with everolimus (median 14.6 
months [95% CI: 5.9, 20.1] vs. 5.5 months [95% CI: 3.5, 7.1]; HR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.68; p=0.0005). 
Secondary endpoints  
Overall Survival 
At the data cut-off for the final PFS analysis (13 Jun 2014), fewer subjects had died in the combination arm 
(19; 37.3%) than in the lenvatinib arm (26; 50.0%) and in the everolimus arm (26; 52.0%). At the date of 
the first OS update (10 Dec 2014), 24 (47.1%) subjects in the combination arm, 31 (59.6%) in the lenvatinib 
arm and 33 (66.0%) subjects in the everolimus arm had died. At the date of the second OS update (31 July 
2015), 32 (62.7%) subjects in the combination arm, 34 (65.4%) in the lenvatinib arm and 37 (74.0%) 
subjects in the everolimus arm had died.

A  highly  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  increase  in  ORR  (43.1%  vs  6%;  RR=7.2  [95%  CI: 
2.3,  22.5];  p<0.001)  was  observed  for  the  lenvatinib/everolimus  combination  over  everolimus.  In  the 
combination  arm,  one  subject  was  achieving  a  CR  and  21  subjects  a  PR  versus  3  subjects  a  PR  in  the 
everolimus arm.  
Three  responses,  all  PRs,  were  unconfirmed  in  the  combination  arm  in  the  primary  ORR  analysis;  thus, 
excluding these 3 responses, the confirmed ORR in the combination arm was 37% (n=19/51). 
• 
Ancillary analyses 
Retrospective analyses by blinded Independent Imaging Review (IIR) 
As per request by and in agreement with the FDA and EMA, a retrospective analyses of the tumour scans was 
conducted to investigate whether the results of a blinded IIR supported the efficacy results (PFS, BOR) based 
on the investigator-assessed tumour responses. 
The primary objective of this blinded IIR review was to compare the PFS of the combination arm versus the 
everolimus arm, and of the lenvatinib arm versus the everolimus arm as assessed by IIR tumour 
assessments, using the FAS. The secondary objectives were to assess BOR, including ORR, DCR, SD, durable 
SD, and CBR; and to compare PFS of the combination arm to the lenvatinib arm as assessed by IIR using the 
FAS.

Percentages are based on the total number of randomised subjects in the relevant treatment group. Tumor response was 
based on RECIST 1.1. Independent Reviewer responses were per the review selected by the adjudicator. 
Overall, the blinded independent and the investigator results agreed on 73.8% (47.7% + 26.1%) of cases, as 
to whether the subject had progressed or not. Agreement was not observed for PD versus non PD in 26.1% 
(18.3% + 7.8%) of subjects. For 18.3% of subjects, the investigator assessed progressive disease, but this 
was not observed by the independent reviewer. Conversely, in 7.8% of subjects, the independent reviewer 
observed PD, but the investigator did not.

A high level of agreement in BOR was observed between the blinded IIR and investigator assessments.  
Results of the 3 treatment arms were consistent with that of the overall agreement (weighted Kappa range: 
0.65 to 0.73). 
Sensitivity analyses for Progression-Free Survival 
A pre-planned sensitivity analysis, decided to be done after database lock, was performed using ECOG PS (0 
vs 1) as an additional stratum in the stratified Cox regression model used for the primary analysis.

Ad hoc sensitivity analyses of PFS 
Four ad hoc sensitivity analyses of PFS were performed to ensure that the results of the primary analysis 
were robust:  
1. Inclusion of clinical progression as a PFS event,  
2. Censored subjects with documented progression based solely on pleural effusion as a new lesion,  
3. Included all subjects with disease progression and deaths as events even if a subject had missing 
assessments, received other anticancer therapy or treatment discontinuation due to reasons other than PD  
4. Censored subjects based on the end of treatment with the last dose as entered on the study medication 
page of the CRF. 
The results of the ad-hoc analyses were generally consistent with those of the primary PFS analysis.

The tumour assessment was based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the 
Full Analysis Set within relevant treatment group. CRF = case report form. 
a: Included clinical progression as a PFS event.  
b: Censored subjects with documented progression based solely on pleural effusion as a new lesion (1 subject met this 
criterion). 
c: Included all subjects with disease progression and deaths as events even if a subject had missing assessments, received 
other anticancer therapy or treatment discontinuation due to reasons other than PD (Appendix Figure 2.7.3-1) 
d: Censored subjects based on the end of treatment with the last dose date as entered on the study medication page of 
the CRF, rather than the investigator’s stated end of treatment date from the disposition page of the CRF (Appendix Figure 
2.7.3-2). 
e: Point estimates are based on Kaplan-Meier method and 95% CIs are based on the Greenwood formula using log-log

Planned Subgroup Analyses of Progression-Free Survival (Investigator)  
Subgroup analyses of PFS were considered exploratory and are limited by the sample size within each 
subgroup.

Analyses by prior VEGF-targeted therapy 
Based on the results of a post-hoc exploratory analysis in a limited number of patients per subgroup, the 
positive effect on PFS was seen regardless of which prior VEGF-targeted therapy was used: sunitinib (Hazard 
ratio [HR] = 0.356 [95% CI: 0.188, 0.674] or other therapies (HR = 0.350 [95% CI: 0.148, 0.828]). The 
results for OS also favored the combination arm over everolimus arm: sunitinib (Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.532 
[95% CI: 0.303, 0.935] or other therapies (HR = 0.639 [95% CI: 0.255, 1.604]), with median OS: 21.8 and 
32.1 months, with sunitinib and other therapy, respectively, in combination arm; and 12 and 21.4 months, 
with sunitinib and other therapy, respectively, in everolimus arm. When OS was calculated from the starting 
date of prior VEGF-targeted therapy, results for OS also favored the combination arm over everolimus arm.

In subjects who received prior sunitinib, the ORR was 41.7% (n=15/36) for the combination arm versus 
3.6% (n=1/28) for the everolimus arm as of the 13 Jun 2014 cutoff date for the primary PFS analysis. In 
subjects who received a different prior VEGF-targeted therapy, the ORR again favored the combination arm 
(46.7%, n=7/15) compared with 9.1% (n=2/22) for everolimus.  
The median duration of treatment in Study 205 was 5.0 months (min, max: 0.7, 33.0) and 4.1 months (0.3, 
33.6) in subjects who received prior sunitinib in the combination (n=36) and everolimus (n=28) arms, 
respectively, and 11.0 months (1.0, 26.5) and 4.7 months (0.6, 29.9) in subjects who received prior VEGF-
targeted therapy other than sunitinib in the combination (n=15) and everolimus (n=22) arms, respectively.  
In subjects who received prior sunitinib, the median duration of response was 13.0 months (95% CI: 3.7, 
NE) for the 15 responders in the combination arm and 9.4 months for the single responder in the everolimus 
arm as of the 13 Jun 2014 cutoff date for the primary PFS analysis. In subjects who received a different prior 
VEGF-targeted therapy, the median duration of response was 12.8 months (95% CI: 2.7, NE) for the 7 
responders in the combination arm and 7.5 months (95% CI: NE, NE) for the 2 responders in the everolimus 
arm.

A total of 54 subjects >65years of age was enrolled in the pivotal Phase 2 portion of Study 205.  
A  clear  benefit  from  treatment  with  lenvatinib/everolimus  relative  to  everolimus  for  PFS  could  be  observed 
(HR:  0.399,  95%CI:  0.153-1.039).  However,  the  number  of  subjects  was  low  and  not  evenly  balanced 
between the lenvatinib/everolimus arm (n=20) and everolimus arm (n=11).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The rationale for clinical evaluation of intended combination of multiple kinase inhibitor lenvatinib and mTOR 
inhibitor  everolimus  was  based  on  biological  rationale,  the  preliminary  clinical  experience  with  lenvatinib  in 
metastatic  RCC,  established  efficacy  of  everolimus  in  2nd  line  treatment  after  VEGF-targeted  therapy  and 
expectation that combination therapy provides significant advantage over single-agent therapy. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  pivotal  study  supporting  the  proposed  indication  is  a  Phase  1b/2  exploratory  study  E7080-G000-205. 
This  is  currently  the  only  study  conducted/ongoing  in  the  proposed  patient  population,  which  includes

patients  with  metastatic  or  unresectable  renal  cell  carcinoma  after  receiving  at  least  1  prior  VEGF  targeted 
therapy.  This  study  was  initially  designed  to  determine  whether  lenvatinib  and  its  combination  with 
everolimus are worthy of further investigation.  
However, the impressive efficacy results of the study in terms of magnitude of PFS improvement, high ORR 
rates  and  associated  trend  to  OS  benefit in  combination  arm  led  to  study  re-consideration  by  the  Applicant 
for a MAA purpose. The proposed treatment is the combination of lenvatinib with everolimus. 
The Phase 1 part of Study 205 aimed to investigate different doses of both drugs within combination using a 
classical  designed  ‘3+3’  dose-escalation  stage  to  determine  the  DLTs  and  MTD  followed  by  a  cohort 
expansion  stage  to  confirm  the  MTD  and  to  establish  the  RP2  dose  for  lenvatinib  in  combination  with 
everolimus. Efficacy was an exploratory objective (BOR investigator-assessed using RECIST1.1).  
The recommended dose/schedule of everolimus (10 mg once daily at continuous dosing; available as 2.5 mg, 
5 mg and 10 mg tablets) is based on the dose-molecular marker responses (PD) in a Phase I trial in patients 
with advanced solid cancers (please refer to EPAR for Afinitor). 
The  MTD  of  single-agent  lenvatinib  (available  as  4  mg  and  10  mg  hard  capsules)  using  continuous  dosing 
schedule was determined to be 25 mg QD in phase 1 program in advanced solid tumours and the dose 24 mg 
was further used for practical reasons. Importantly, concerns have been raised in regard to the starting dose 
of  24  mg  daily  (please  refer  to  EPAR  for  Lenvima  approved  in  orphan  RR-DTC  indication  in  2015).  Post-
approval Study 211 aims to determine whether a starting dose of lenvatinib 20 mg or 14 mg QD will provide 
comparable  efficacy  (based  on  ORR  at  6  months)  with  an  improved  safety  profile  to  24  mg  QD  (based  on 
TEAE Grade 3 or higher in the first 6 months after randomization).  
The principles of the CHMP guidance available at the time of the design of the Study 205 (initiated in 2010) 
have been employed for DLT/MTD/RP2D determination. The dose for initiating dose escalation in combination 
therapy was half of the full dose for each single-agent (12 mg lenvatinib QD and 5 mg everolimus QD). The 
Applicant gave priority to lenvatinib for dose escalation based on preliminary evidence of lenvatinib activity in 
9 RCC patients. Due to the occurrence of DLTs in the first two subjects enrolled in the Cohort 3 (lenvatinib 24 
mg + everolimus 5 mg), the Cohort 4 with a full dose of everolimus 10 mg in combination with lenvatinib 24 
mg  was  not  tested.    Therefore,  full  recommended  dose  of  everolimus  in  RCC  indication  was  not  achieved. 
Alternative  dosing  schedules  were  not  tested.  The  dose-finding  principles  for  non-cytotoxic  compounds  are 
evolving, with consideration given to how the concepts of MTD and DLT are pre-defined, in order to capture 
relevant toxicities and arrive at a useful RP2D (EMA/CHMP/205/95 Rev.5).  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In patients with advanced RCC and disease progression following 1 prior VEGF-targeted treatment, the 
combination of lenvatinib 18 mg with everolimus 5 mg demonstrated statistically significant (p=0.0005) 
improvement in PFS compared with treatment with everolimus alone (median 14.6 months vs 5.5 months, 
respectively). The improvement in PFS of 9.1 months is considered clinically significant. The combination’s 
improvement in PFS over everolimus was noted for all subgroups analysed (HRs range from 0.14 to 0.61). 
The combination arm showed a statistically significant (P<0.0001) improvement in ORR (43.1%) compared 
with both single agent arms (26.9% for the lenvatinib arm, and 6.0% for the everolimus arm). 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 104/162 
  
  
 
 
 
The combination arm showed a trend towards prolonged survival (HR = 0.55) compared with the everolimus 
arm that reached statistical significance (P=0.0242) in the updated OS analysis based on a 10 Dec 2014 data 
cut-off (HR = 0.51). Median survival was 25.5 months for the combination arm and 15.4 months for the 
everolimus arm. 
These  results  support  an  efficacy  claim  for  the  proposed  combination  of  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  in  the 
proposed indication.  
The  pre-planned  and  post  hoc  sensitivity  analyses  and  the  sub-group  analyses  produced  results  consistent 
with  and  supportive  of  the  primary  analyses  results  for  the  primary  endpoints.  The  post  hoc  blinded 
independent  review  showed  improvements  in  PFS  and  ORR  with  the  combination  over  everolimus  alone. 
Though  these  differences  were  lesser  than  that  calculated  in  the  primary  analysis,  the  results  are  still 
statistically and clinically significant. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  the  combination  of  lenvatinib  with  everolimus  has  been  shown.  Lenvatinib/everolimus 
combination therapy demonstrated improved PFS compared to everolimus monotherapy with a median PFS of 
14.6  months  vs.  5.5  months.  The  HR  was  0.40  (95%  CI:  0.24,  0.68,  p=0.0005).  An  independent  imaging 
review (IIR) was conducted and the results obtained, for PFS and ORR, corroborated the improvements seen 
in the investigator analyses with a median PFS of 12.8 months vs. 5.6 months with everolimus alone (HR= 
0.45,  95%  CI=  0.26,0.79,  p=0.003).  Additional  sensitivity  analyses  performed  confirmed  the  robustness  of 
observed PFS. 
Furthermore,  encouraging  signs  of  a  prolonged  OS  were  seen  in  patients  treated  with  the  combination  of 
lenvatinib  and  everolimus  combination  therapy  as  per  the  primary  analysis  as  well  as  the  two  updated 
analyses  that  span  a  more  than  1-year  period.  A  similar  trend  towards  prolonged  OS  was  also  observed  in 
favour of lenvatinib monotherapy but less obvious than with combination therapy.   
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  main  source  of  safety  data  in  support  of  lenvatinib-everolimus  combination  therapy  in  RCC  patients  is 
Study  205  conducted  in  173  patients,  of  which  62  patients  received  treatment  at  the  intended 
doses/schedule of lenvatinib 18 mg plus everolimus 5 mg administered orally once daily (QD) and additional 
9 patients received different doses of lenvatinib in the dose-finding part of Study 205 (12 mg – 7 patients; 24 
mg – 2 patients). 
In  the  Phase  1b  part  of  Study  205,  lenvatinib  18  mg  QD  plus  everolimus  5  mg  QD,  was  identified  as  the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 (RP2) dose for the subsequent Phase 2 part 
of the study.  
In the Phase 2 part of Study 205, the lenvatinib + everolimus combination was compared with single-agent 
lenvatinib at the starting  dose of 24 mg QD (dose approved for the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer 
[DTC])  and  single-agent  everolimus  10  mg  QD  (dose  approved  for  the  second-line  treatment  of  advanced 
RCC). 
The safety analysis groups within the RCC Safety Set from Study 205 are as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 105/162 
  
  
 
• 
RCC  Phases  1b+2  combination  group  (N=62),  hereafter  referred  to  as  the  RCC  combination  group 
includes  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  combination  study  drug  (lenvatinib  18  mg  QD  + 
everolimus 5 mg QD) in either the Phase 1b (n=11) or the Phase 2 portion of Study 205 (n=51, arm A). 
• 
RCC  lenvatinib  group  (N=52,  arm  B):  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  single-agent 
lenvatinib 24 mg QD in the Phase 2 portion of Study 205. 
• 
RCC  everolimus  group  (N=50,  arm  C):  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  single-agent 
everolimus 10 mg QD in the Phase 2 portion of Study 205. 
Safety data for all treatment arms in Study 205 were presented in the CSR through the data cutoff date for 
the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  analysis  of  13  Jun  2014.  The  safety  data  from  Study  205  was  updated  with 
cutoff date 31 Jul 2015 to allow for the inclusion of additional safety data for the RCC Safety Set. 
The clinical program for lenvatinib, which is not approved as monotherapy in the RCC indication, includes 33 
clinical  studies  with  approximately  2150  subjects  with  different  cancer  types  and  292  healthy  volunteer 
enrolled  with  cutoff  date  31  Jul  2015  and  treated  with  lenvatinib  either  as  monotherapy  or  as  combination 
therapy. 
The  comparisons  of  lenvatinib  safety  data  were  done  with  the  pooled  safety  data  from  the  monotherapy 
studies  of  lenvatinib  for  progressive  radioiodine-refractory  DTC  (RR-DTC),  with  additional  supportive 
comparisons with the Non-DTC Safety Set: 
• 
All DTC Lenvatinib Monotherapy Safety Set (N=458): includes all lenvatinib-treated subjects from 
Studies E7080-G000-201 (DTC subjects only), E7080-J081-208 (DTC subjects only), and E7080-G000-303 
(both the randomized and the optional open-label portions of the study) as of the 10 Dec 2014 data cutoff 
date.  
• 
Non-DTC Monotherapy Safety Set (N=656): includes all subjects who received single-agent lenvatinib 
in studies conducted in subjects with cancer as of the 15 Sep 2013 data cutoff date. Because of the small 
number of subjects (n=26/656, ≈ 4%) ongoing as of this cutoff date, the Applicant did not provide an update 
from these 26 subjects. 
Patient exposure 
As of the 31 Jul 2015 cut-off date for the RCC Safety Set, a total of 46 subjects (28.0%) were still ongoing in 
Study 205  (4 receiving  treatment  and  42 in  follow-up),  112 subjects  (68.3%)  had  died,  and  6 subjects 
(3.7%) had withdrawn from the study. 
The  subject  disposition  status  and  primary  reasons  for  discontinuation  are  summarized  for  the  RCC,  the 
All DTC, and the Non-DTC Safety Sets in table 380 below.

Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the relevant treatment arm. Data cutoff date 13 Jun 2014. For 
each row category, a subject with 2 or more TEAEs in that category is counted only once. 
a: Two subjects (10011005 and 70011001) died within 30 days of the last dose of study medication due to their underlying 
cancer (progressive disease), however, the investigator did not report the death as an adverse event. Therefore, these 
subjects are not included in the overall incidence of SAEs. 
b: Subjects may have had more than 1 SAE or an SAE that met more than 1 criterion. 
c: Study treatment adjustment includes study treatment withdrawal, dose reduction, and/or interruption. 
Common adverse events 
In the RCC combination group  the most frequently reported TEAEs (any grade), occurring in at least 30% of 
subjects, were diarrhoea (80. 6%), fatigue (59.7%), decreased appetite (53.7%), vomiting (48.4%), nausea 
(45.2%),  hypertension  (40.3%),  hypertriglyceridemia  (40.3%),  cough  (37.1%),  stomatitis  (35.5%), 
peripheral  oedema  (33.9%),  decreased  weight  (33.9%),  dyspnea  (30.6%),  and  hypercholesterolemia 
(30.6%).   
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs, occurring in at least 5% of subjects in the RCC 
combination group, were diarrhoea (19.4%), fatigue (12.9%), hypertension (12.9%), hypertriglyceridemia 
(12.9%), acute renal failure (8.1%), anaemia (8.1%), dehydration (8.1%), proteinuria (8.1%), and vomiting 
(6.5%).

In a larger lenvatinib monotherapy safety data set the most commonly reported TEAEs (≥ 30% of subjects, 
any grade) (All DTC safety set), in descending order of frequency, were hypertension, diarrhoea, decreased 
appetite,  weight  decreased,  fatigue,  nausea,  proteinuria,  stomatitis,  vomiting,  dysphonia,  headache,  and 
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome. 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  everolimus  is  also  well  established.  The  most  frequently  reported  (≥10%)  AEs 
with  everolimus  in  clinical  trials  were  stomatitis,  rash,  fatigue,  diarrhoea,  infections,  nausea,  decreased 
appetite, anaemia, dysgeusia, pneumonitis, hyperglycaemia, weight decreased, pruritus, asthenia, peripheral 
oedema, hypercholesterolemia, epistaxis, and headache.

Subjects with 2 or more TEAEs reported for the same preferred term were counted only once using the highest CTCAE 
grade. Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the relevant treatment group or safety set. 
The safety data cut-off date was 31 Jul 2015 for the RCC Safety Set, 10 Dec 2014 for the All DTC Safety Set, and 
15 Sep 2013 for the Non-DTC Safety Set. 
CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, DTC = differentiated thyroid cancer, MedDRA = Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, PPE = palmer-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, RCC = renal cell carcinoma, TEAE 
= treatment-emergent adverse event, TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone. 
Clinically Significant Adverse Events (CSEs)  
Clinically  significant  events  (CSEs)  previously  defined  for  the  DTC  MAA  included  hypertension,  proteinuria, 
arterial  and  venous  thromboembolic  events,  posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES),  renal 
events,  liver  events,  gastrointestinal  (GI)  perforation  and  fistula  formation,  QTc prolongation,  decreased 
ejection fraction (EF), hypocalcemia, haemorrhage, and PPE. Weight loss and cytopenias were also evaluated.  
The combination arm of study 205 had a higher level of clinically significant TEAE than everiolimus arm (79% 
and 62%, respectively).

Cardiovascular events 
Cardiovascular  toxicity  includes  events  such  as  hypertension,  cardiac  failure,  arterial  and  venous 
thromboembolic events, QTc prolongation and haemorrage.  These are considered to be clinically significant 
events for lenvatinib+everolimus and are subject to routine Pharmacovigilance reporting.  A summary of the 
incidence of cardiovascular TEAEs in the lenvatinib RCC combination group and All DTC Safety Set is provided 
in Table above. 
Hypertension  
Hypertension  was  experienced  at  a  lower incidence rate  and  intensity in  the RCC  combination  group  (42%) 
than in the lenvatinib single arm (48%) and in the All DTC Safety set (73%) but was still higher than in the 
everolimus only arm (10%). AEs grade 3 or above occurred in 13% of the RCC combination group. 
There  were  no  Grade  4  or  Grade  5  TEAEs,  no  SAEs,  and  no  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  related  to 
hypertension  in  the  RCC  combination  group  and  thus  hypertension  was  sufficiently  manageable  in  the  RCC 
combination group.   
The median time to onset of hypertension was 4.9 weeks (any grade) and 6.9 weeks (Grade ≥ 3) in the RCC 
combination group, which is later than in the All DTC safety set (2 weeks). The highest proportion of subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 114/162 
  
  
 
 
 
experienced an episode of hypertension in Cycle 1 in the RCC combination group (21.0%) as was the case in 
the All DTC Safety Set (45.6%).  
Thromboembolic events 
Thromboembolic events are known to occur with VEGF/VEGFR-targeted therapies.   
One  Arterial  thromboembolic  events  (ATE)  per  SGQ  of  grade  3  occurred  in  the  RCC  combination  group  to 
compare to 4 in the lenvatinib alone group (7.7%, 3 grade 3 and 1 grade 5) and in 5.5% of the DTC patients. 
There were no interruption, reduction or discontinuation due to ATE in the RCC combination group.  
The time to onset of arterial thromboembolic events for the 1 subject in the RCC combination group was 69.6 
weeks (Grade 3).  In the RCC combination group, the 1 episode of an arterial thromboembolic event occurred 
in Cycle 18.  Although episodes of arterial thromboembolic events per SGQ occurred throughout treatment in 
the All DTC Safety Set, a higher percentage tended to occur within the first 2 cycles of treatment. 
Four venous thromboembolic events occurred in the RCC combination group (6.5%), one of each of grades 1, 
2,  3  and  4,  two  being  SAEs.  One  led  to  an  interruption  of  the  studied  combination  of  drugs.  The  lenvatinib 
alone arm showed higher figures with 7 AEs ( 13.5%) of grade 1, 2 and 3  which is significantly higher than 
the profile of VTEs in DTC patients (at least for the grade 1 and 2 AEs). The median time to onset of venous 
thromboembolic  events  was  28.1  weeks  (any  grade)  and  20.6  weeks  (Grade  ≥ 3)  in  the  RCC  combination 
group 
Of the TEAEs contributing to the SGQ for venous thromboembolic events, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism,  thrombophlebitis,  and  venous  thrombosis  each  occurred  in  1  subject  in  the  RCC  combination 
group.    Pulmonary  embolism  was  the  most  frequent  event  in  the  All  DTC  (2.8%)  and  the  Non  DTC  (3.0%) 
Safety Sets.  The incidence rate and severity of venous thromboembolic events in the RCC combination group 
is consistent with the known safety profile of lenvatinib. 
The  median  time  to  onset  of  venous  thromboembolic  events  was  28.1  weeks  (any  grade)  and  20.6  weeks 
(Grade ≥ 3) in the RCC combination group. 
QTc prolongation 
In the RCC study in the subjects with baseline and postbaseline data avaliabale (92%), respectively 11.3% , 
24% and 56% had increase of >60 ms, between 30 and 61 ms,  and  below 31 ms in the RCC combination 
group.  Data  are  similar  for  the  RCC  lenvatinib  group  but  with  a  significantly  lower  number  of  patients  with 
increase of > 60 ms (2; 3.8%). The incidence of QTc interval greater than 500 ms was 6% in the lenvatinib 
plus  everolimus-treated  group.  No  reports  of  QTc  interval  prolongation  greater  than  500  ms  or  increases 
greater than 60 ms occurred in the everolimus-treated group.  
The median time to onset of QTc prolongation was 35.1 weeks (any grade) in the RCC combination group.  In 
the RCC combination group, episodes occurred sporadically from Cycle 2 through Cycle 18.  
Decreased ejection fraction and cardiac failure 
“Decreased ejection fraction and cardiac failure” occurred in 3 subjects (4.8%) in the RCC combination group, 
4 subjects (7.7%) in the RCC lenvatinib group and 7% in the DTC safety set.  The only TEAE contributing to 
the  CSE  of  decreased  EF  and  cardiac  failure  that  occurred  in  more  than  2%  of  subjects  in  the  RCC 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 115/162 
  
  
 
combination  group  was  decreased  EF  (3.2%)  as  in  the  all-DTC  safety  set  (4.8%).  Cardiac  failure  was 
reported in 1 patient (1.6%) of the combination group.  
So  far  the  incidence  rate  and  severity  of  cardiac  failure  and  decreased  EF  events  in  the  RCC  combination 
group is consistent with the known safety profile of lenvatinib per the approved Lenvima SmPC. 
The median time to onset of decreased EF and cardiac failure per SGQ was 15.7 weeks (any grade) and 32.8 
weeks  (Grade  ≥ 3)  in  the  RCC  combination  group.    Episodes  of  decreased  EF  and  cardiac  failure  per  SGQ 
tended  to  occur  sporadically  throughout  treatment  for  both  the  RCC  combination  group  and  the  All  DTC 
Safety Set. 
Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhage is a well-known AE associated with treatment with TKIs. Two distinctive types of bleeding have 
been described:  mild spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding and serious tumour related bleeding.   
Haemorrhage  accounted  for  2  discontinuations,  2  drug  reductions  and  2  drug  interruptions  in  the  RCC 
combination  arm,  1  discontinuation  in  the  RCC  lenvatinib  arm  and  1  dose  reduction  in  the  everolimus  arm. 
One patient in both RCC combination and lenvatinib arms had a grade 5 event.  
In  the  RCC  study  haemorrhage  was  reported  in  38.7%  (8.1%  were  Grade ≥ 3)  of  patients  in the  lenvatinib 
plus  everolimus-treated  group,  notably  epistaxis  (22.6%),  haematuria  (4.8%),  haematoma  (3.2%),  and 
gastric  haemorrhage  (3.2%).  The  median  time  to  first  onset of  was  10.2 weeks  (any  grade)  and  7.6 weeks 
(Grade ≥ 3) in the lenvatinib plus everolimus-treated group.  The rate of haemorrhage was the highest at the 
beginning  of  treatment  (12%  of  subjects)  then  decreased  to  a  plateau  after  3  cycles.  There  might  be  a 
second  period of  higher  occurrence  (5%  of  subjects) between  the  6th  and  the  10th  cycle.  The  chronology  of 
the events is slightly different than the one of the DTC patients.   
The incidence of serious haemorrhage was 4.8% (cerebral haemorrhage, gastric haemorrhage and 
haemarthrosis). Discontinuation due to haemorrhagic events occurred in 3.2% of patients in the lenvatinib 
plus everolimus-treated group. There was one case of fatal cerebral haemorrhage in the lenvatinib plus 
everolimus-treated group and one case of fatal intracranial haemorrhage in the lenvatinib-treated group. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
Renal  events  including  renal  failure,  blood  creatinine  increased,  blood  urea  increased,  creatinine  renal 
clearance  decreased  and  toxic  nephropathy  toxic  were  reported  in  17.7%  of  patients  in  the  combination 
group  (11  events,  15  episodes,  0.27  episodes/SY)  in  the  RCC  combination  group,  12.9%  (8  events,  11 
episodes, 0.14 episodes/SY) in the All DTC Safety Set, and 7.5% (0.25 episodes/SY) in the Non DTC Safety 
Set.    In  the  11  subjects  of  the  RCC  combination  group,  no  subjects  discontinued  treatment,  2  had  a  dose 
reduction and 3 a dose interruption. One subject discontinued treatment in the arm B/ RCC lenvatinib group. 
There was a higher rate of SAEs for renal events in the RCC combination group (11.3%) compared with the 
All  DTC  (2.6%)  and  the  Non  DTC  (2.1%)  Safety  Sets.    The  incidence  rate  and  severity of  renal events was 
similar in the RCC combination group and the RCC lenvatinib group. 
The median time to onset of renal events was 8.1 weeks (any grade and Grade ≥ 3) in the RCC combination 
group.    More  than  half  of  the  episodes  occurred  within  the  first  3  cycles  (RCC  combination  group,  7  of  12 
episodes) or first 4 cycles (All DTC Safety Set, 35 of 76 episodes).  Thus, although episodes of renal events 
tended to occur throughout treatment, they more frequently did so early in treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 116/162 
  
  
 
 
Of the renal events, acute renal failure (8.1%) and increased blood creatinine (4.8%) were the most frequent 
for the RCC combination group.  In the All DTC Safety Set, acute renal failure and increased blood creatinine 
occurred in 2.4% and 6.6% of subjects, respectively. 
Renal failure and impairment 
In the combination group 8.1% of patients developed renal failure and 3.2% developed renal impairment, 
(9.7% of patients had a Grade 3 event of renal failure or impairment). In the everolimus monotherapy group 
2.0% of patients developed renal failure (2.0% were Grade 3).  
In the DTC study, 5.0% of patients developed renal failure and 1.9% developed renal impairment, (3.1% of 
patients had a Grade ≥ 3 event of renal failure or impairment).  
Grade 3 acute renal failure events occurred at a higher rate in the RCC combination group (5 subjects, 8.1%) 
than in the lenvatinib alone mRCC group (5.8%) or in the All DTC Safety Set (4 subjects, 0.9%). There were 
no Grade 4 or grade 5 acute renal failure events in the RCC safety.   
Serious renal events occurred at a higher rate in the RCC combination group (11.3%) and the RCC lenvatinib 
group (7.7%) compared with the All DTC Safety Set (2.6%).  
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria was reported in 30.6% of patients in the combination group (8.1% were Grade ≥ 3) and 14.0% 
of patients in the everolimus-treated group (2.0% were Grade ≥3). The median time to onset of proteinuria 
was 6.1 weeks (any grade) and 20.1 weeks (Grade ≥ 3) in the lenvatinib plus everolimus-treated group. 
Proteinuria led to permanent treatment discontinuation in 4.8% of patients. The highest proportion of 
subjects experienced an episode of proteinuria in the first 2 cycles of treatment.  
Liver Events 
TEAEs occurred in 9 (14.5%), 7 (13.5%) and 5 (10%) of subjects of respectively the RCC combination, the 
RCC lenvatinib and the RCC everolimus arms to compare to 24% with the DTC patients. In the mRCC group 2 
patients  discontinued  treatment,  and  one  each  had  an  interruption  or  a  dose  reduction.  In  the  mRCC 
lenvatinib group 1 patient had a dose reduction. SAEs occurred in 2 patients of the mRCC combination group: 
increased blood bilirubin (Grade 3) and increased transaminases (Grade 3). The median time to onset of liver 
events  was  6.7  weeks  (any  grade)  and  14.2  weeks  (Grade  ≥ 3)  in  the  RCC  combination  group.    The  worst 
grade  and  first  occurrence  of  the  event  generally  occurred  within  the  first  7  treatment  cycles  in  a  similar 
pattern than with the all DTC safety group. The rate of liver event episodes per SY was slightly higher in the 
RCC  combination  group  compared  with  that  in  the  All  DTC  Safety.    SAEs  and  discontinuations  due  to  liver 
events occurred for a slightly higher percentage of subjects in the RCC combination group than in the All DTC 
and the Non DTC Safety Sets, this difference representing a few subjects in the RCC group.  The episodes per 
SY and severity of liver events were higher in the RCC combination group than in the RCC lenvatinib group. 
Of the TEAEs contributing to liver events in the RCC combination group, increased alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT)  was  the  most  frequent  (9.7%  any  Grade  and  1.6%  Grade  ≥ 3),  followed  by  increased  aspartate 
aminotransferase  (AST;  4.8%  any  Grade  and  1.6%  Grade  ≥ 3)  and  increased  blood  alkaline  phosphatase 
(ALP; 4.8% any Grade, no Grade ≥ 3).  
There were no subjects identified in the safety database who met the criteria for possible Hy’s Law.

The  incidence  rate  and  episodes  per  SY  of  TEAEs  for  hypocalcemia  per  SGQ  were  comparable  in  the  RCC 
combination group (5 subjects; 8.1%; 0.16), the RCC lenvatinib group (3 subjects; 5.8%; 0.08) and the Non 
DTC  (4.6%;  0.11)  Safety  Sets,  and  numerically  lower  than  that  in  the  All  DTC  Safety  Set  (60  subjects; 
13.1%; 0.15). 
No subjects required treatment interruptions or discontinued treatment because of abnormalities in sodium, 
magnesium or calcium.  One subject in the combination group required a dose reduction and discontinued 
treatment because of hypokalemia 
Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, or hypomagnesaemia increase the risk of QT 
prolongation;  therefore  electrolyte  abnormalities  should  be  monitored  and  corrected  in  all  patients  before 
starting treatment.  Periodic monitoring of ECG and electrolytes (magnesium, potassium and calcium) should 
be  considered  during  treatment.  Blood  calcium  levels  should  be  monitored  at  least  monthly  and  calcium 
should be replaced as necessary during lenvatinib treatment. Lenvatinib dose should be interrupted or dose 
adjusted  as  necessary  depending  on  severity,  presence  of  ECG  changes,  and  persistence  of  hypocalcaemia. 
(SmPC section 4.4). Hypocalcemia and hypokalemia are important identified risks in RMP. 
Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia Syndrome 
The  incidence  rate  of  TEAEs  for  PPE  was  lower  in  the  RCC  combination  group  (16.1%)  and  in  the  RCC 
everolimus  arm  than  that  in  the  RCC  lenvatinib  arm  (21%)  and  in  the  All  DTC  Safety  Set  (35.4%).  There 
were no Grade 3 TEAEs in the RCC combination group; Grade 3 TEAEs were reported for 15 subjects (3.3%) 
in the All DTC Safety Set.  There were no SAEs and no treatment discontinuations due to PPE in the RCC or 
All  DTC  Safety  Sets.  Two  patients  (3.2%)  had  and  interruption  in  the  RCC  combination  arm,  1  in  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016

lenvatinib arm and 9% in the All-DTC safety set. Episodes of PPE tended to occur throughout treatment.  The 
median time to onset of PPE was 7.2 weeks in the RCC combination group.  
Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation 
One case (1.6%; grade 3, perforated appendicitis) of gastrointestinal perforation and fistula formation 
occurred in the mRCC combination group, 3 in the mRCC lenvatinib group (6%) and 2.4% in the all-DTC 
safety group. 
Pancreatitis 
Six  (9.7%)  subjects  of  the  RCC  combination  arm  had  a  potential  risk  of  pancreatitis.  One  had  a  dose 
reduction and one an interruption. No SAE was described. A higher incidence (9.7%) of “Lipase increased” is 
observed  in  the  RCC  combination  arm  while  “Amylase  increased”,  “Hyperamylasaemia”,  “hyperlipasaemia”, 
“pancreatic pseudocyst” and “pancreatitis” are not different from the All DTC group.   
Interstitial Lung Disease 
The  TEAEs  for  potential  risk  of  interstitial  lung  diseases  (ILD)  are  pneumonitis,  lung  infiltration,  acute 
respiratory  distress  syndrome  and  pulmonary  sarcoidosis.  In  study  205  phase  2,  pneumonitis  occurred  in  3 
(6%)  1  and  6  patients  of  the  RCC  combination,  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  groups  respectively.  While  the 
worst  grade  was  2  for  two  patients  of  the  combination  arm  (1  SAE),  it  was  3  for  three  patients  of  the 
everolimus arm. Lung infiltration occurred once in the everolimus arm (grade < 3). Two (4.0%) subjects in 
the  RCC  everolimus  group  discontinued  treatment  because  of  pneumonitis.    The  frequency  of  pneumonitis 
reported in the RCC everolimus group is not inconsistent with the known frequency reported in the approved 
AFINITOR SmPC.  The incidence (4, 6.5%) of ILD is higher in the RCC combination (phase 1b +2) than in the 
All DTC patients (6 events; 1.3%).  
Hypothyroidism  
Thyroid dysfunction is a known class effect of TKIs due to the antiangiogenetic effect on the thyroid blood 
vessels of the drugs in this class. Hypothyroidism occurred in 24% of patients in the lenvatinib plus 
everolimus-treated group and 2% of patients in the everolimus-treated group. All events of hypothyroidism 
in the combination group were of Grade 1 or 2. There were no severe (Grade 3 or 4) TEAEs, SAEs, or 
treatment discontinuations associated with the important risk of hypothyroidism in the RCC combination 
group and the All DTC Safety Set; however, all 3 types of events were observed for the Non DTC Safety Set 
(1.2%, 0.6%, and 0.3%, respectively). In patients with a normal TSH at baseline, an elevation of TSH level 
was observed post baseline in 60.5% of lenvatinib plus everolimus-treated patients as compared with none in 
patients receiving everolimus alone.  
New or Worsening Safety Signals for Lenvatinib Plus Everolimus Combination Therapy 
The potential for new or worsening safety signals with combination lenvatinib/everolimus therapy in RCC was 
evaluated in comparison with the known safety profiles of lenvatinib and everolimus as single agents. 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016

The  following  criteria  have  been  applied  in  order  to  make  a  meaningful  comparison  and  assessment  of 
potential new or worsening events based on the sample size in the RCC Safety Set: 
•  Events  were  only  considered  for  evaluation  if  the  frequency  in  the  RCC  combination  group  was  ≥ 10% 
subjects for any grade TEAE or ≥ 5% subjects for any Grade 3 or 4 TEAE. 
•  These  events  were  only  considered  potential  new  or  worsening  signals  if  they  occurred  at  ≥ 10%  (any 
grade) AND there was a relative risk of 2 or greater when the RCC combination group was compared with the 
All DTC Safety Set OR if they occurred at ≥ 5% (Grade 3 or 4) AND there was a relative risk of 2 or greater 
when  the  RCC  combination  group  was  compared  with  the  All  DTC  Safety  Set.  The  relative  risk  of  2  was 
chosen as the cutoff because a lower relative risk cutoff would likely result in many false signals due to the 
size of the RCC Safety Set.

All events that met the following criteria for a potential new or worsening event are shown in bold:  events were only 
considered for evaluation if the frequency in the RCC Phase 1b+2 combination group was ≥10% subjects for any grade 
TEAE or ≥5% subjects for any Grade 3 or 4 TEAE.  These events were only considered potential new or worsening signals 
if they occurred at ≥10% (any grade) AND there was a relative risk of 2 or greater when the RCC Phase 1b+2 
combination group was compared with the All DTC Safety Set OR if they occurred at ≥5% (Grade 3 or 4) AND there was 
a relative risk of 2 or greater when the RCC Phase 1b+2 combination group was compared with the All DTC Safety Set. 
Subjects with 2 or more TEAEs reported for the same preferred term were counted only once using the highest CTCAE 
grade.   
Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the relevant treatment group or safety set. 
The safety data cut-off date was 31 Jul 2015 for the RCC Safety Set, 10 Dec 2014 for the All DTC Safety Set, and 15 Sep 
2013 for the Non-DTC Safety Set. 
DTC = differentiated thyroid cancer, RCC = renal cell carcinoma, SmPC = Summary of Product Characteristics; TEAE = 
treatment-emergent adverse event, TKI = tyrosine kinase inhibitor, TSH = thyroid stimulating hormone. 
a:  Diarrhoea is included for consideration because it occurred at a high frequency, although it did not meet the above 
criteria. 
b:  Approved LENVIMA (lenvatinib) SmPC:  renal failure cases include acute prerenal failure, renal failure, renal failure 
acute, and renal tubular necrosis. 
c:  Approved AFINITOR (everolimus) SmPC:  renal failure (≥10%) is shown for comparison to the approved LENVIMA 
SmPC, which includes combined terms (see above).  The frequency of acute renal failure reported in the approved 
AFINITOR SmPC is ≥0.1% to <1%. 
Eleven events were identified: diarrhea, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, hypertriglyceridemia, fatigue, 
vomiting,  acute  renal  failure,  dehydration,  anemia,  hyperglycemia  and  pruritus.  Diarrhea  has  also  been 
included  for  consideration  because  it  occurred  at  a  high  frequency,  although  it  did  not  meet  the  specified 
criteria. 
Potential new safety signals with the combination 
No  new  safety  signals  have  been  identified  with  combination  therapy  in  the  RCC  Safety  Set  that  are  not 
already known for either lenvatinib or everolimus. 
New Safety Signals Not Known for Lenvatinib 
Hypertriglyceridemia,  anaemia,  hyperglycaemia,  and  pruritus  were  reported  with  an  increased  frequency  in 
the  RCC  combination  relative  to  All  DTC  Safety  set.    These  4  events  are  well  known  AEs  associated  with 
everolimus therapy and are all included in the approved AFINITOR SmPC.  There was an increased frequency 
in the RCC combination group relative to the All DTC Safety Set, which fulfilled the criteria for a new signal 
for  the  combination  therapy.    However,  the  frequencies  seen  in  the  RCC  everolimus  group  were  generally 
higher than that in the RCC combination and RCC lenvatinib groups, which supports the conclusion that these 
events are attributable to everolimus and, therefore, not considered to be a new signal for the combination 
therapy. 
Hypertriglyceridemia 
Hypertriglyceridemia  has  a  higher  incidence  in  mRCC  patients  (lenvatinib  arm;  13.5%)  than  in  the  DTC 
patients  (3.7%).  Although  single  agent  everolimus  has  a  causal  effect  (24%);  the  combination  shows  the 
highest values (40.3%) suggesting a synergetic effect of everolimus and lenvatinib.  
Anaemia 
Anaemia, described as “very common” in the Afinitor SmPC, had the highest incidence in the RCC everolimus 
group (26%). Its incidence in the RCC lenvatinib group and in the DTC safety set is identical (8.1%), but it is 
twice as more frequent in the RCC combination group (17.7%). Of note the half AEs are of grade 3 or 4 AEs 
in the combination arm.  
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 121/162 
  
  
 
 
Anaemia  was  the  most  frequently  reported  AE  that  led  to  dose  reduction  and/or  interruption  in  the 
everolimus arm. This event led to dose reduction and/or interruption in 1 subject in each of the combination 
(2.0%) and lenvatinib (1.9%) arms, and in 6 subjects (12.0%) in the everolimus arm. Anaemia resulting in 
dose  reduction  and/or interruption  was  Grade  3 or  4  in  1  subject in  each  of the  combination  and  lenvatinib 
arms, and in 4 subjects (8.0%) in the everolimus arm. 
Hyperglycaemia 
The  incidence  of  hyperglycaemia  is  described  as  ‘very  common’  in  the  SmPC  of  Afinitor.  Its  incidence  (any 
grade) was much higher in the RCC combination group (17.7%) compared with that in the All DTC Safety Set 
(5.0%).  No Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in the RCC combination group.  Hyperglycaemia (any grade; 
Grade  3  or  4)  was  reported  in  the  RCC  lenvatinib  group  (5.8%;  0%)  and  in  the  RCC  everolimus  group 
(24.0%; 10.0%). 
Pruritus 
The incidence of pruritus is described as very common in the SmPC of Afinitor. Its incidence (any grade) was 
much higher in the RCC combination group (12.9%) compared with that in the All DTC Safety Set (5.7%).  
No Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in the RCC combination group.  Pruritus Grade 1 or 2, but no grade 3 
or 4 events have been reported in the RCC lenvatinib group (5.8%) and in the RCC everolimus group 
(14.0%). 
Safety signals already known for both lenvatinib and everolimus 
Fatigue, vomiting, hypercholesterolemia, dehydration, and acute renal failure were reported with an 
increased frequency in the RCC combination group relative to the All DTC Safety Set.  Diarrhoea was added 
because of its high frequency.  
Diarrhoea 
In the RCC study, diarrhoea was reported in 80.6% of patients in the combination group (21.0% were Grade 
≥  3) and in 34.0% of patients in the everolimus-treated group (2.0% were Grade ≥  3). The median time to 
onset was 4.1 weeks (any grade) and 8.1 weeks (Grade ≥  3) in the lenvatinib plus everolimus-treated group. 
Diarrhoea was the most frequent cause of dose interruption/reduction and recurred despite dose reduction. 
Diarrhoea resulted in discontinuation in one patient. The increased frequency of severe diarrhoea in the RCC 
combination group appears to represent an additive effect of the 2 therapies, a worsening safety signal for 
the combination therapy and can be managed with dose reductions and medical therapy, including prompt 
institution of antidiarrheal medication at the first onset of this TEAE.   
Vomiting 
Vomiting showed a similar pattern with incidences of 12%, 38.5% and 48.4% in the everolimus, lenvatinib 
and combination groups. No discontinuation was due to this AE.  The incidence of vomiting that led to dose 
reduction and/or interruption was 19.6% (n=10) in the combination, 5.8% (n=3) in the lenvatinib and in 0% 
in the everolimus arm. Grade 3 or 4 vomiting led to dose reduction and/or interruption in 3 subjects (5.9%) 
in the combination and 2 subjects (3.8%) in the lenvatinib arms.

Fatigue  
Similarly to diarrhoea but in a much lower extent, the combination appears to exert additional effects on 
fatigue according to the incidences of  32%, 40.4% but 59.7%  in the RCC everolimus, lenvatinib and 
combination groups respectively (incidences of 0%, 7.7% and 12.9 % for grade 3 and 4 AEs, respectively). 
No discontinuation was due to this AE.  Another constitutional symptom asthenia was reported in 24.2% of 
subjects in the combination group, 15.4% in the lenvatinib group, and 6.0% in the everolimus group.  There 
was only 1 event of Grade 4 asthenia, which occurred in the everolimus group (there were only 1 or 2 events 
of Grade ≥ 3 asthenia in each of the 3 groups).  Weight loss was reported in 33.9% of subjects in the 
combination group, 50.0% in the lenvatinib group, and 8.0% in the everolimus group.  Unlike the trend 
observed for fatigue and asthenia, lenvatinib and everolimus combination treatment did not demonstrate 
increase in the observed incidence of weight loss compared to the single agents alone.  There were no 
treatment discontinuations due to asthenia or weight loss in any of the 3 treatment groups.

Hypercholesterolemia and dyslipedemia 
The incidence rate of hypercholesterolemia (any grade) was much higher in the RCC combination group 
(30.6%) compared with that in the All DTC Safety Set (3.3%), with that of the RCC lenvatinib arm (11.5%) 
or with that of the RCC everolimus arm (16%) and the increased incidence is a worsening safety signal for 
the combination therapy. 
The most frequent events within the dyslipidemia SMQ were hypertriglyceridemia (40.3% in the RCC 
combination group, 13.5% in the RCC lenvatinib group, and 24.0% in the RCC everolimus group), 
hypercholesterolemia (30.6%, 11.5%, and 16.0%, respectively), and increased blood cholesterol (8.1%, 
3.8%, and 6.0%, respectively). Dyslipidemia caused 5 interruptions and 2 reductions of drug in the RCC 
combination group but only one drug reduction in the lenvatinib arm.    
Dehydration  
The incidence of grade 3 or 4 dehydration (5 pts; 8.1%) in the combination arm is significantly higher than in 
the lenvatinib arm and the everolimus arm (both 0%).  
Acute renal failure 
This AE is described above in the section on significant AEs.

Abdominal pain 
Abdominal pain (upper) led to dose reduction and/or interruption in 9.8% (n=5), 3.8% (n=2) and 0% in the 
combination, lenvatinib, and everolimus arms, respectively. One subject (2.0%) in the combination arm had 
Grade 3 upper abdominal pain that led to dose reduction/interruption.  
Long-Term Safety  
Long-term safety data for the combination are currently limited to the results available from Study 205.

For each row category, a subject with 2 or more AEs in that category in each interval is counted only once for that time 
interval.  However,  if  a  subject  had  more  than  1  episode  of  the  same  AE  across  multiple  intervals,  episodes  are  counted 
separately  as  new  events  for  each  relevant  interval.  Only  subjects  with  a  specific  AE  reported  in  a  given  interval  are 
counted for that interval. Percentages are based on total number of subjects at risk in each period. 
a: Treatment-related TEAEs include TEAEs that were considered by the Investigator to be possibly or probably related to 
study drug or TEAEs with a missing causality. 
b:  Dose  adjustment  includes  study  drug  withdrawal,  dose  reduction,  and/or  interruption.  Subjects  may  be  counted  in 
multiple categories. 
As of the 31 Jul 2015 cutoff date for the RCC Safety Set, a total of 46 subjects (28.0%) were still ongoing (4 
receiving  treatment  and  42  in  follow-up)  in  Study  205.  The  pharmacovigilance  database  was  reviewed  with 
the  cutoff  date of  27  Apr 2016.  One of  the  4  follow-up  reports  for  SAEs  pertained  to  a fatal event  with  the 
time to onset of 844 days after the subject’s first dose. Based on additional follow-up information this was a 
case  of  myocardial  infarction.  The  coroner's  postmortem  report  confirmed  the immediate  cause  of  death  as 
being  attributed  to  acute  plaque  haemorrhage  of  the  left  descending  artery.  The  subject  had  advanced 
atherosclerosis of the coronary vessels and a medical history of hypercholesterolemia and Type 2 diabetes.

Given  that  long-term  safey  data  with  lenvatinib  and  its  combination  with  everolimus  are  limited  in  the  RCC 
patients, long-term safety data for lenvatinib monotherapy are of particular relevance to inform on lenvatinib 
safety at long term and to compare safety profiles of the combination versus single-agent therapies. In the 
lenvatinib  monotherapy  All  DTC  safety  set,  139  subjects  (≈ 30%)  received  lenvatinib  for  longer  than  24 
months. Of these 139 subjects, 28.8% had a severe (Grade 3 or 4) TEAE after 24 months of treatment, most 
commonly  hypertension  (8  subjects,  5.8%)  and  diarrhea  (5,  3.6%).  The  most  frequently  reported  CSEs 
(≥ 10% of subjects) after 24 months of lenvatinib treatment in Lenvatinib either the All DTC (N=139) or Non-
DTC (N=26) safety sets were hypertension, proteinuria, hemorrhage, liver events, and PPE.

  Adverse event terms were coded using Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) version 
16.1. Includes treatment-emergent fatal AEs as of the data cutoff date (13 Jun 2014). Age is age at 
informed consent. AE = adverse event, F = female, M = male, W = white, yr = year. 
a: As assessed by the investigator. 
b: Study Day of Death = date of death – date of first dose of study drug +1 
c: Duration of Treatment = date of last dose of study drug – date of first dose of study drug +1 
d: Number of days between end of treatment with study drug and death. 
e: Lenvatinib dose / everolimus dose. Lenvatinib dose corrected post DBL to 18 mg in database (lenvatinib 
dosing in combination arm). 
f: Acute respiratory failure was secondary to pneumonia. 
There  were  6  subjects  with  fatal  AEs:  1  in  the  combination  arm,  3  in  the  lenvatinib  arm  and  2  in  the 
everolimus  arm.  None  of  these  subjects  had  progressive  disease  reported  as  the  cause  of  death  by  the 
investigator. In 1 subject in the lenvatinib arm, the investigator did not specify whether progressive disease 
was present at the time of death. 
The subject in the combination arm died of a cerebral haemorrhage that was considered probably related to 
study medication by the investigator. A 58-year-old White female diagnosed with metastatic clear cell renal 
cell carcinomahad medical history of anaemia, constipation and fatigue. Previous anticancer therapy included 
sunitinib.  Concomitant  medications  included  iron,  magnesium  and  senna  alexandrina.  ECOG  performance 
status  at  screening  was  0.  The  subject  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  due  to  severe  headache,  hypertension 
and  vomiting.  Within  one  hour  of  admission,  the  subject  became  noncommunicative.  A  CT  of  the  brain 
showed cerebral haemorrhage. The study medication was withdrawn and the subject received the last dose of 
study medication. Later that day, one day after the last dose, the subject died due to cerebral haemorrhage. 
The Investigator considered this event serious and probably related to the study medication. 
Of the 3 subjects that had fatal AEs in the lenvatinib group: 
• 1 subject with a history of aortic arteriosclerosis and atherosclerotic calcification of coronary arteries died of 
a myocardial infarction that was considered possibly related to lenvatinib treatment by the investigator. 
• 1 subject died of an intracranial haemorrhage that was considered not related to lenvatinib treatment; the 
investigator did not specify whether progressive disease was present at the time of death. This subject had a

history of hypertension, craniotomy for microsurgical resection of brain metastases, and prior radiotherapy to 
the left frontal lobe. 
• 1 subject died of sepsis that was considered not related to lenvatinib treatment by the investigator. The 
subject was hospitalized for both acute renal failure and sepsis (etiology unknown) at the time of death. 
In the everolimus arm, one subject died of respiratory failure and the other subject died of E.coli sepsis. The 
first subject had pneumonia (Grade 3) that resulted in respiratory failure with pericardial effusion (Grade 3) 
and cardiac tamponade (Grade 4) as contributing factors. 
One subject died of myocardial infarction in the combination arm after data cutoff date of 31July 2015 (see 
‘Long-term safety’ section above).

* Includes all subjects who received lenvatinib 18 mg + everolimus 5 mg dose from both Phase I 
and Phase II portion of study E7080-G000-205. [a] Indicates the number of subjects with non-
missing baseline and post-baseline data; this number is used to calculate percentages within each 
laboratory test. Markedly abnormal is defined as a value that is above or below the normal range 
and the CTCAE grade increased from baseline by 2 or more grades, except for phosphate which 
must have shifted by 3 or more grades. Subjects are counted only once for each row. Laboratory 
Results were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.

Safety in special populations 
Age  
Overall there was no meaningful difference in the AE profile between the older (≥ 65 years)   and younger (< 
65  years)  subjects  for  the  RCC  combination  group.    The  findings  for  the  RCC  combination  group  were 
comparable with those for the All DTC and the Non DTC Safety Sets. 
Gender   
No  meaningful  differences  between  male  and  female  subjects  for  the  RCC  combination  group  with  the 
exception  of  a  trend  toward  a  higher  rate  of  treatment  discontinuation  among  female  subjects  (44%) 
compared with male subjects (22.7%). However the numbers are low and no firm conclusion can be drawn.  
Race 
The studied population was essentially white, other races were underrepresented.  
Weight 
The RCC combination group showed similar mean decreases in body weight (maximum mean change: minus 
15.83 kg) compared with that for the RCC lenvatinib group (maximum mean  change:    minus 12.60 kg) at 
time  points  for  which  more  than  2  subjects  contributed  data.  The  selected  RCC  patients  had  relatively  high 
BMI  and  were  not  representative  of  patients  with  lower  weight.  An  analysis  of  weight  loss  by  body  mass 
index  done  in  the  All  DTC  Safety  Set  indicated  that  weight  loss  was  greater  for  subjects  in  the  obese  and 
overweight  categories  at  Baseline  than  for  subjects  in  the  underweight  or  normal  weight  categories.  The 
number of patients is too low to draw firm conclusions.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions 
Please refer to the PK assessment report and PD section (Section 2.4) of this report. 
Drug-disease interactions 
The  safety  of  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  everolimus  was  evaluated  in  subjects  with  potential  baseline 
disease risk factors. These include renal impairment, hepatic impairment, hypertension, and diabetes. 
The  CSE  of  Renal  Events  tended  to  occur  at  a  higher  incidence  rate  in  subjects  with  baseline  renal 
impairment  compared  with  those  without  baseline  renal  impairment  for  the  RCC  combination  group  (27.8% 
vs. 13.6%). This difference was also observed for the All DTC Safety Set (24.5% vs. 11.5%); a similar trend 
was observed for the Non-DTC Safety Set 11.5% vs. 6.9%). 
The  safety  of  lenvatinib  in  combination  with  everolimus  in  subjects  with  RCC  was  evaluated  by  baseline 
hepatic function: Not Impaired and Impaired subgroups. Subjects were considered to have baseline hepatic 
impairment  if  their  baseline  AST,  ALT,  or  bilirubin  levels  were  a  CTCAE  Grade  1  or  higher  (Impaired 
subgroup). For the RCC Safety Set groups, the number of subjects with impaired hepatic function at baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 129/162 
  
  
 
 
 
 
was very small: 6 subjects overall; 3 (4.8%) of 62 subjects in the RCC combination group and 3 (5.8%) of 52 
subjects in the RCC lenvatinib group. Because the percentage of subjects in the RCC combination group was 
less than 5%, no meaningful comparisons can be made. Therefore, baseline hepatic function was not further 
discussed. 
Baseline hypertension (yes vs no subgroups) was evaluated as risk factor. The overall incidence rate of SAEs 
for the RCC Safety Set, were similar (63.0% vs. 56.3%) in subjects with and without baseline hypertension. 
Patients  with  baseline  hypertension  had  a  higher  incidence  of  Grade 3  or  4  dehydration,  fatigue,  and 
hypertension (SmPC section 4.8). The following higher incidence rate in subjects with baseline hypertension 
than  in  those  without  in  the  RCC  combination  group  were  reported:  dehydration  (10.9%  vs.  0%),  fatigue 
(15.2% vs. 6.3%), and hypertension (17.4% vs. 0%).  
Subjects  were  considered  to  have  baseline  diabetes  if  they  had  a  medical  history  of  diabetes  or 
hyperglycaemia  or  received  any  prior  diabetic  medications.  Although  the  number  of  subjects  with  baseline 
diabetes  was  small  (n=9)  in  the  RCC  combination  group,  severe  acute  renal  failure  (22.2%  vs.  5.7%), 
hypertension  (22.2%  vs.  11.3%),  and  hypertriglyceridemia  (33.3%  vs.  9.4%)  tended  to  be  reported  at  a 
higher  incidence  rate  in  subjects  with  baseline  diabetes  than  in  those  without  baseline  diabetes.  Of  note, 
severe diarrhea and fatigue occurred more frequently in subjects without baseline diabetes than in those with 
baseline  diabetes  in  the  RCC  combination  group.  The  following  common  TEAEs  were  reported  at  a  higher 
incidence  rate  in  subjects  with  baseline  diabetes  than  in  those  without  baseline  diabetes  for  the  RCC 
combination group: abdominal distension (22.2% vs. 5.7%), acute renal failure (22.2% vs. 5.7%), asthenia 
(33.3%  vs.  22.6%),  hyperglycaemia 
(33.3%  vs.  15.1%),  hyperkalemia 
(22.2%  vs.  5.7%), 
hypertriglyceridemia (55.6% vs. 37.7%), musculoskeletal chest pain (33.3% vs. 15.1%), nausea (55.6% vs. 
43.4%), and vomiting (66.7% vs. 45.3%). Therefore, the SmPC section 4.8 states that patients with baseline 
diabetes had a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and acute renal failure. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  the  RCC  study  18  (29%)  of  patients  discontinued  treatment  due  to  adverse  events.  Most  individual  AEs 
leading to study treatment discontinuation were reported in not more than 1 subject; the only AEs that led to 
discontinuation in more than 1 subject were thrombocytopenia in 2 (3.9%) subjects in the combination arm, 
myocardial infarction/acute myocardial infarction in 2 (3.9%) subjects in the lenvatinib arm, and pneumonitis 
in  2  (4.0%)  subjects  in  the  everolimus  arm.  Five  (9.8%)  subjects  in  the  combination  arm,  8  (15.4%) 
subjects  in the  lenvatinib arm,  and  3  (6.0%)  subjects  in  the  everolimus  arm discontinued  study  medication 
as a result of Grade 3 or 4 AEs.   
The rate of discontinuation due to TEAEs in the Phase 1b+2 combination arm as of 31 Jul 2015 was similar 
before Cycle 5 (5 subjects; 0.24/subject year [SY]) and after Cycle 5 (9 subjects; 0.26/SY).   
Eight subjects, 3 in each of the combination and lenvatinib arms, and 2 in the everolimus arm, discontinued 
study medication due to 1 or more Grade 4 or 5 AEs. These events included a) Grade 4 hypokalemia, Grade 4 
dyspnoea,  and  Grade  5  cerebral  haemorrhage  in  1  subject  each  in  the  combination  arm,  b)  Grade  5 
myocardial  infarction,  Grade  4  intracranial  haemorrhage,  and  Grade  4  sepsis  in  1  subject  each  in  the 
lenvatinib arm and c) Grade 4 pulmonary embolism and Grade 4 Escherichia sepsis in 1 subject each in the 
everolimus arm.

Adverse events that required dose reduction or interruption 
The  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  (TEAE)  that  most  frequently  led  to  dose  reduction  was  diarrhoea. 
Dose reductions for diarrhoea occurred at a higher frequency in the RCC combination arm (21.0%) compared 
with the RCC lenvatinib arm (13.5%) as well as for the All DTC (10.5%) and Non-DTC (3.5%) safety sets.

* Includes all subjects who received lenvatinib 18 mg + everolimus 5 mg dose from both Phase I and Phase II portion of study E7080-
G000-205. Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the safety analysis set within relevant treatment group. TEAE = 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Event. Subjects with two or more adverse events in the same preferred term are counted only once for 
that preferred term. Preferred terms are sorted in descending frequency based on the incidence rate in the RCC Phases 1b+2 
combination group. If the incidence rate of 2 or more preferred terms was identical, the preferred terms have been sorted 
alphabetically. Adverse events terms were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 17.1 for RCC 
Phase II + Proposed Dose Pooled Safety Set and All DTC Lenvatinib Safety Set and version 16.1 for Non-DTC Monotherapy Safety Set. 
Adverse events were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The data cut off date for 
the RCC set is 31JUL2015, data cut off date for the All DTC set is 10DEC2014 and 15SEP2013 for the Non-DTC set.

Adverse events leading to dose reduction and/or interruption as an action occurred with frequency of 88.7%, 
78.8%  and  54%  respectively  in  the  combination  group,  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  arms.  Gastrointestinal 
events, including diarrhea, vomiting and upper abdominal pain, resulted in dose reduction and/or interruption 
more often in the combination than in the lenvatinib and everolimus arms. Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea led to dose 
reduction and/or interruption in 7 subjects (11.3%) in the combination, 5 subjects (9.6%) in the lenvatinib, 
and 1 subject (2.0%) in the everolimus arm.

* Includes all subjects who received lenvatinib 18 mg + everolimus 5 mg dose from both Phase I and Phase II portion of study 
E7080-G000-205. Any TEAEs leading to dose reduction and/or dose interruption not having at least 2 subjects in any treatment 
arm in the RCC safety set are listed only if the incidence is >=2% in the All DTC set. TEAE = Treatment-emergent adverse event.  
Dose reduction and/or dose interruption in (Lenvatinib + Everolimus) arm refer to dose reduction and/or interruption in Lenvatinib 
or Everolimus or both. Percentages are based on the total number of subjects in the safety analysis set within relevant treatment

Post marketing experience 
Lenvatinib  has  been  approved  for  marketing  in  over  35  countries  for  the  indication  of  RR-DTC  and  is  sold 
under the brand name, LENVIMA®. Approximately 1000 new patients have been exposed to lenvatinib since 
the  International  Birth  Date  of  13  Feb  2015  through  12  Aug  2015,  the  cut-off  date  for  the  most  recent 
Periodic Safety Update Report (Oct 2015). 
Most  of  the  exposure  has  been  in  patient  support  programs  in  the  US  and  in  a  post-marketing  surveillance 
study  in  Japan.  The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  reactions  post-marketing  have  been  dehydration, 
hypertension,  diarrhoea,  fatigue,  and  nausea.  These  are  consistent  with  the  adverse  reactions  observed  in 
the clinical studies included in the original MAA for DTC and are consistent with the safety profile of lenvatinib 
as reflected in the current product information.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From  the  safety  database  all  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  have  been  included  in  the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
The assessment of clinical safety is based on the results of the phase 1b/2 study 205 which enrolled overall 
62  patients  with  RCC  treated  with  the  intended  dosing  regimen  of  lenvatinib-everolimus  combination.  Data 
for  lenvatinib  monotherapy  was  provided  from  studies  in  other  indications  and  is  supported  by  data  from 
lenvatinib monotherapy arm of Study 205. The safety profile of everolimus is well-established in the second-
line RCC patients. The open-label nature of Study 205, in addition to its relatively small sample size, further 
diminished the value of safety data analysis from randomised treatment arms. Comparison exercise between 
combination  arm  and  respective  monotherapy  arms  is  further  complicated  by  lower  doses  of  components 
used within combination than in single-agent arms. The submitted data did not allow evaluation of potential 
PD and/or PK interactions that could result in higher toxicity in certain patient subgroups. 
Safety  data  from  the  randomised  part  of  Study  205  were  supported  by  safety  data  coming  from  the  dose-
finding part of the same study. 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  (any  grade),  occurring  in  at  least  30%  of  subjects  in  the  combination 
group  were  diarrhoea  (80.  6%),  fatigue  (59.7%),  decreased  appetite  (53.7%),  vomiting  (48.4%),  nausea 
(45.2%),  hypertension  (40.3%),  hypertriglyceridemia  (40.3%),  cough  (37.1%),  stomatitis  (35.5%), 
peripheral  oedema  (33.9%),  decreased  weight  (33.9%),  dyspnoea  (30.6%),  and  hypercholesterolemia 
(30.6%).  There is an overlap with safety profiles of both lenvatinib (associated with hypertension, diarrhoea, 
decreased  appetite,  weight  decreased,  fatigue,  nausea,  proteinuria,  stomatitis,  vomiting,  dysphonia, 
headache, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome) and everolimus (stomatitis, rash, fatigue, 
diarrhoea,  infections,  nausea,  decreased  appetite,  anaemia,  dysgeusia,  pneumonitis,  hyperglycemia,  weight 
decreased, pruritus, asthenia, peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, epistaxis, and headache). 
The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3  or  4  TEAEs,  occurring  in  at  least  5%  of  subjects  in  the  RCC 
combination  group,  were  diarrhoea  (19.4%),  fatigue  (12.9%),  hypertension  (12.9%),  hypertriglyceridemia 
(12.9%), acute renal failure (8.1%), anaemia (8.1%), dehydration (8.1%), proteinuria (8.1%), and vomiting 
(6.5%).  In  the  lenvatinib  arm,  the  most  common  grade  3  or  4  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  was 
proteinuria (19%) and in patients assigned to single-agent everolimus it was anaemia (12%). 
Grade  3  and  4  events  occurred  in  higher  proportion  of  patients  allocated  to  lenvatinib  plus  everolimus  arm 
(71%) and single-agent lenvatinib arm (79%) compared to single-agent everolimus (50%).  
SAEs were reported in 38 subjects (61.3%) in the combination group (n=62), in 28 subjects (53.8%) in the 
lenvatinib  arm,  and  in  21  subjects  (42.0%)  in  the  everolimus  arm.  Among  the  most  frequent  SAEs  (>5% 
subjects)  reported  in  the  combination  arm  were  dehydration  (9.7%)  and  renal  failure  (8.1%).  Other  most 
serious  adverse  events  include  dyspnea,  gastrointestinal  AEs  (diarrhea  and  vomitig)  and  haematological 
events  (anaemia  and  thrombocytopenia).  Anaemia  was  more  frequently  reported  in  the  combination  and 
everolimus arms (in 4 subjects each). 
Six  fatal  AEs  were  reported,  including  one  cerebral  haemorrhage  in  the  combination  group  and  one 
myocardial  infarction  with  single-agent  lenvatinib.  Longer  follow-up  data  in  patients  with  RCC  reported 
additional SAE of myocardial infaction with fatal outcome one day post-treatment. 
Clinically  significant  events  (CSEs)  previously  defined  for  the  DTC  MAA  included  hypertension,  proteinuria, 
arterial  and  venous  thromboembolic  events,  posterior  reversible  encephalopathy  syndrome  (PRES),  renal 
events,  liver  events,  gastrointestinal  (GI)  perforation  and  fistula  formation,  QTc  prolongation,  decreased

ejection  fraction  (EF),  hypocalcaemia,  haemorrhage,  and  PPE.  Weight  loss  and  cytopenias  were  also 
evaluated. 
For  the  majority  of  CSEs,  there  was  no  significant  change  to  the  known  safety  profiles  of  lenvatinib  or 
everolimus,  but  the  available  data  do  not  allow  to  make  definitive  conclusions  since  some  events  are  rarer 
and would not be adequately addressed by available safety database. No Hy’s Law cases occurred. However, 
the  frequency  of  renal  events  and  cytopenias  (anaemia,  thrombocytopenia),  did  increase  in  the  RCC  safety 
set. Renal failure, renal impairment and proteinuria were reported in substantial proportion of patients, with 
about 10% incidence of grade 3 or greater. 
Consistency with safety profile of VEGFi and mTORi 
The  AEs  observed  with  combination  lenvatinib/everolimus  in  Study  205  are  consistent  with  the  known 
toxicities of each individual agent. 
Furthermore,  lenvatinib  has  a  safety  profile  that  is  consistent  with  other  VEGF/VEGFR-targeted  therapies, 
although the nature and extent of various AEs differ among the approved compounds, described as follows. 
Combination lenvatinib/everolimus tends to be associated most frequently with hypertension; GI events such 
as  diarrhoea,  nausea,  and  vomiting;  hypothyroidism;  and  hypercholesterolemia.  These  events  can  be 
controlled with dose modifications and prompt medical treatment.  
Everolimus  was  also  associated  with  high  rates  of  hyperglycaemia  as  well  as  anaemia,  lymphopenia,  and 
dyslipidaemia,  and  the  SmPC  contains  special  precautions  for  non-infectious  pneumonitis,  renal  failure 
events, stomatitis, and wound healing complications. 
Safety in comparison to other TKIs use in second line treatment of mRCC 
Common  treatment-related  adverse  events  associated  with  VEGF-targeted  therapies  and  TKIs  in  general 
include  fatigue  and  asthenia,  GI  symptoms  (e.g.,  diarrhoea,  stomatitis),  skin  toxicities  (e.g.,  hand-foot 
syndrome,  hair  depigmentation,  rash),  cardiovascular  toxicities  (e.g.,  hypertension),  and  a  variety  of 
metabolic  and  laboratory  abnormalities  (Schmidinger,  2013).  Although  there  are  a  number  of  known  class 
effects,  targeted  agents  differ  regarding  their  individual  side  effect  profiles.  These  differences  may  be 
attributed to the drug’s mode of action, the number of targets inhibited, the type of inhibited target(s) (e.g., 
VEGF vs. PDGF vs.Flt-3), and the strength of target inhibition (affinity to the tyrosine kinase, “on-” and “off-” 
target toxicities) (Chen and Cleck, 2009; Haraldsdottir and Shah, 2014; Schmidinger, 2013). 
Some toxicities have been linked to the inhibition of a specific target, e.g., hypertension and VEGF; however, 
the  association  of  other  side  effects  with  a  particular  target  is  less  clear  (e.g.,  stomatitis,  diarrhoea). 
Moreover,  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  may  influence  the  incidence  and  severity  of  side  effects  in 
different patient populations (Schmidinger, 2013). 
Events  regarded  as  class  effects  that  occurred  infrequently,  rarely,  or  not  at  all  with  combination 
lenvatinib/everolimus  included  arterial  and  venous  thromboembolic  events,  interstitial  lung  disease,  cardiac 
failure,  PRES,  PPE,  and  impaired  wound  healing.  However,  the  number  of  patients  was  limited  and  serious 
adverse events should be closely monitored. 
Hypertension  was  commonly  reported  with  all  of  the  approved  agents  and  appears  to  be  dose-dependent 
(Schmidinger,  2013).  Axitinib  was  also  associated  with  high  rates  of  elevated  TSH  and  GI  events  such  as 
nausea  and  diarrhoea.  Sorafenib  was  associated  with  higher  rates  of  PPE,  rash,  alopecia,  and  bleeding

events.  Pazopanib  was  associated  with  higher  rates  of  hyperglycaemia,  haemorrhagic  events,  and  liver 
events (including elevations in liver transaminase values).  
In  clinical  trials  of  TKIs,  amylase  and  lipase  elevations  were  also  reported  frequently  (often  by  more  than 
30% of subjects) and are considered a class effect, whereas acute pancreatitis occurred in fewer than 5% of 
subjects (Pezzilli, et al., 2010). Another review of clinical trials of TKIs reported increased amylase and lipase 
levels in approximately 50% of subjects (Schmidinger, 2013). In Study 205, elevations in lipase and amylase 
concentrations occurred in approximately 10% and 3% of subjects in the RCC combination arm, respectively, 
but there were no cases of pancreatitis. 
Potential for new or worsening safety 
The potential for new or worsening safety signals with combination lenvatinib/everolimus therapy in RCC was 
evaluated in comparison with the known safety profiles of lenvatinib and everolimus as single agents. 
No  new  safety  signals  have  been  identified  with  combination  therapy  in  the  RCC Safety  Set,  which  was  not 
already known for either lenvatinib or everolimus. 
Hypertriglyceridemia,  anaemia,  hyperglycaemia,  and  pruritus  were  reported  with  an  increased  frequency  in 
the  RCC combination  group  relative  to  the  All DTC  Safety  Set  and  fulfilled  the  criteria  for  a  potential  new 
safety signal with combination therapy in the RCC population that is not already known for lenvatinib. 
Fatigue,  vomiting,  hypercholesterolemia,  dehydration,  and  acute  renal  failure  were  reported  with  an 
increased frequency in the RCC combination group relative to the All DTC Safety Set.   
Diarrhoea  has  also  been  included  for  consideration  because  it  occurred  at  a  high  frequency  (81%  in  the 
combination arm), although it did not meet one of the prespecified criteria (relative risk of 2 or greater when 
the  RCC combination  group  was  compared  with  the  All DTC  Safety  Set).  Grade  3  or  4  diarrhea  occurred  in 
about 19% of patients. It also triggered dose adjustments being the most frequent cause of dose reductions 
and/or  interruptions  and  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  treatment  in  one  patient.  Although  not  studied 
directly,  the  MOA  for  the  worsening  of  diarrhea  with  the  combination  is  postulated  to  be  mediated  by  the 
impairment  of  intestinal  function  related  to  the  MOAs  for  the  individual  agents  –  VEGF/VEGFR  and  c-KIT 
inhibition by lenvatinib coupled with mTOR/NHE3 inhibition by everolimus. 
Electrolyte  imbalance,  mucocutaneous  toxicities  and  constitutional  symptoms  are  observed,  although  at 
varying  frequencies  with  both  VEGFR  TKIs  and  mTOR  inhibitors  and,  in  some  cases  the  combination 
treatment may alter the frequencies of observed toxicities with the single agents. Drugs that act on the VEGF 
pathway  may  induce  renal  abnormalities,  as  a  consequence  of  their  intrinsic  mode  of  action  and 
nephrotoxicity associated with everolimus has been reported (Launay-Vacher et al., 2015).  The renal toxicity 
of VEGF inhibitors is mainly renovascular in nature, including hypertension (HTN), proteinuria, and decreased 
glomerular  filtration  rate  (GFR).    Renal  events  were  observed  in  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
combination group (17.7%) than in lenvatinib arm (15.4%) and everolimus arm (12%), with higher rate of 
grade 3 and more events (9.7%, 5.8% and 2%, respectively). Grade 3 acute renal failure events occurred at 
a  higher  rate  in  the  RCC  combination  group  (5  subjects,  8.1%)  than  in  the  lenvatinib  alone  mRCC  group 
(5.8%) or in the All DTC Safety Set (4 subjects, 0.9%). 
The  incidence  rate  of  hypothyroidism  (any  grade)  was  much  higher  in  the  RCC combination  group  (24.2%) 
compared  with  that  in  the  everolimus  group  (2%).  In  addition,  the  incidence  rate  of  increased  blood  TSH 
(any  grade)  in  the  RCC  combination  group  (11.3%)  was  higher  than  that  in  the  All  DTC  Safety  Set. 
Impairment  of  exogenous  thyroid  suppression  is  included  in  the  Warnings  and  Precautions  section  of  the 
Assessment report

approved LENVIMA SmPC.  The rate of hypothyroidism for combination lenvatinib/everolimus was within the 
range reported for other agents in the same class.  
Both hypothyroidism and increased blood TSH are known class effects of TKIs (Haraldsdottir and Shah, 2014; 
Pezzilli, et al., 2010).  The rate of hypothyroidism may be dose dependent as it was reported at a higher rate 
in the RCC lenvatinib group (24 mg lenvatinib:  36.5%) compared with the RCC combination group (18 mg 
lenvatinib:  24.2%). Furthermore, 75% of patients in the lenvatinib plus everolimus-treated group were not 
receiving  exogenous  thyroid  replacement,  and  of  these,  71%  had  normal  baseline  thyroid  stimulating 
hormone  (TSH)  levels.  In  patients  with  a  normal  TSH  at  baseline,  an  elevation  of  TSH  level  was  observed 
post  baseline  in  63%  of  lenvatinib  plus  everolimus-treated  patients  as  compared  with  none  in  patients 
receiving everolimus alone. 
Unexpected  onset  of  AEs  due  to  potential  pharmacokinetic  and/or  pharmacodynamic  interactions  and  their 
late detection is not excluded given that experience with VEGFi-mTORi combinations is limited to date mainly 
to early phase studies, with few data at long term.  
Investigation of safety data from Studies 307 and 218 in regard to potentially worsening AEs will be further 
conducted in a manner similar to that applied to the data from Study 205.  The frequency of all treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (any grade) and Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs. The first review to be conducted will 
be  of  first-line  data  in  Study  307  (which  is  estimated  to  be  available  by  2020)  against  the  known  safety 
profile  of  treated  subjects  in  DTC  and  second-line  RCC,  followed,  in  2021,  by  a  comparison  of  the  second- 
and third-line data in RCC Study 218.  The Study 218 data will also be pooled with the 2 previous data sets in 
support of the addition of these data to the SmPC.  This will allow analysis of safety data across the breadth 
of  the  RCC  population  covered  in  Studies  307,  218,  and  205,  and  will  provide  a  useful  view  of  the  safety 
profile  across  the  proposed  range  of  use  from  first-line  through  third-line  settings.  Any  differences  in 
incidence or severity from the existing AE profile or between different subgroups will be identified, discussed, 
and if warranted, proposed for inclusion in the SmPC. 
The  following  methodology  was  proposed  to  further  characterise  potential  worsening  of  AEs.  Events  will  be 
considered potential new or worsening signals if: they occur at ≥5% (any grade) AND there is a relative risk 
of  2  or  greater  when  the  RCC  combination  group  is  compared  either  with  the  everolimus  EPAR  pooled data 
set  or  the  incidences  of  the  events  which  are  ADRs  in  the  Kisplyx  SmPC;-OR  for  Grade  3  or  4  events,  or 
clinically  significant  adverse  events,  if they  occur  at ≥1%  AND there  is  a  relative  risk  of 2 or  greater  when 
the RCC combination group is compared either with the everolimus EPAR pooled data set or the incidences of 
the events which are ADRs in the Kisplyx SmPC. 
Long-term safety 
Long-term  safety  data  for  the  combination  are  currently  available  from  Study  205  and  are  limited  by  the 
number  of  subjects  in  the  study  and,  consequently,  by  the  number  of  patients  who  received  treatment  for 
more than one year. The combination treatment appear to prolong overall survival in patients in the pivotal 
study,  with  median  OS  of  about  2  years  observed.  Of  the  62  subjects  in  the  combination  arm,  22  subjects 
(35.5%) had 1 year or more of treatment (36.3 SY) and 5 subjects (8.1%) had ≥ 2 years of treatment (12.0 
SY).  However,  long-term  safety  will  be  more  comprehensively  assessed  in  a  lager  safety  database  in  the 
planned  studies.  In  particular,  potential  cumulative  toxicity  and  time-dependent  intolerability  and  toxicity 
could emerge at longer term. Additional combination-therapy trials (Studies 218, 307 and 221) are planned, 
which  will  provide  additional  data  on  longer-term  safety  and  allow  comparison  with  single  agent  safety 
profiles.  Moreover,  real-world  data  will  become  available  from  the  EU  and  US  upon  approval  of  the 
combination.

Given the limited number of patients treated with combination, no meaningful conclusions in regard to long-
term  toxicity  can  be  drawn.  Higher  proportion  of  all  types  of  AEs  appears  to  be  observed  within  first  6 
months, but some increase in toxicity might occur at more than 1 year of exposure. Collection of long-term 
safety  data  is  of  continuous  importance  also  for  lenvatinib  monotherapy  and  several  studies  are  ongoing. 
Long-term  data  with other  VEGF-targeted  therapies (eg  Rini  et  al, 2015)  indicate increase  in  cardiovascular 
toxicity,  which  is  a  key  element  in  B/R  of  these  agents  (Shah  et  al,  2015).  Long–term  data  on  the  safety 
profiles of the TKIs axitinib and sunitinib used as monotherapy in RCC have been analysed.  Of a total of 108 
patients had received axitinib for ≥2 years, and interval analysis showed that most AEs occurred during the 
first  6  months  of  treatment,  with  rates  stable  or  decreased  over  time.    However,  incidence  rates  increased 
over  time  for  proteinuria,  peripheral  edema,  and  increased  blood  creatinine.    Common  Grade  ≥3  AE  rates 
declined or plateaued over time, except for increased amylase and myocardial infarction.  The median times 
to  onset  for  increased  amylase  and  myocardial  infarction  were  8.1  months  and  22.1  months,  respectively 
(Rini, et al., 2015). In regard to long-term safety of sunitinib, hypothyroidism increased by interval analysis 
from 6% at 0 <6 months to 42% at 5–<6 years and by cumulative analysis from 14% at 0–<1 year to 36% 
over  6  years.    Grade  3/4  treatment-related  AEs  in  patients  during  long-term  treatment  peaked  during  the 
first year and then steadily decreased (Porta, et al., 2016).  
Based  upon  review  of  the  available  literature  on  long-term  use  of  TKIs  as  single  agents  in  mRCC,  the 
majority of AEs occurred within the first 6-12 months, and the incidence of most AEs decreased or remained 
stable over time.  The exceptions to these observations were proteinuria, peripheral oedema, increased blood 
creatinine,  and  hypothyroidism.    The  severe  (Grade  ≥3)  AEs  that  increased  in  incidence  over  time  were 
increased  amylase  and  myocardial  infarction,  and  these  AEs  tended  to  occur  later  on  in  treatment  (>8 
months).  
Dose 
When therapeutic goal is prolongation of survival, it is important to reduce toxicities and to maximize overall 
time  on  treatment.  The  duration  of  treatment  (including  dose  interruptions)  was  8.0  months  in  the 
combination  group  (n=62)  (7.6  months  in  the  combination  arm  in  the  Study  205),  7.4  months  in  the 
lenvatinib group (n=52) and 4.1 months in the everolimus group. Most of the AEs observed up to now with 
the combination treatment are manageable and further optimisation of strategies to reduce rate of premature 
discontinuation  of  treatment  due  to  toxicity  is  encouraged  to  allow  patients  to  benefit  from  highly  effective 
treatment.  
The  results  from  the  study  205  show  efficacy  in  mRCC  patients  with  the  starting  dose  of  18  mg  QD  of 
lenvatinib  and  5  mg  everolimus,  however  88.7%  of  patients  require  dose  modifications  (dose  reduction 
and/or  interruption)  and  29%  of  patients  discontunied  treatment  due  to  AEs,  indicating  poor  tolerability  of 
the combination. Similarly, overall 89.7% of lenvatinib-treated patients had dose modifications of lenvatinib 
in  DTC  Study  303.  Data  on  safety  and  activity  of  lower  starting  doses  for  lenvatinib  monotherapy  will  be 
provided through a randomised dose-finding trial E7080-G000-211 (Study 211) looking at safety and activity 
of  three  starting  doses  (24  mg,  20  mg  and  14  mg once  daily)  (see  RMP).  Primary  endpoints  will pertain  to 
safety  (rate  of  TEAE  with  CTCAE  grades  of  3  or  higher  within  6  months  after  randomization),  but  also  to 
efficacy  (Objective  response  rate  (ORR)  at  6  months  (ORR6M)  as  assessed  by  the  investigator  according  to 
RECIST 1.1). 
In the RCC indication, a study comparing lower dose of lenvatinib within combination is requested. Study 218 
is  a  randomised  dose-finding  phase  2  trial  in  advanced  RCC  patients  which  aims  to  compare  lower  dose  of 
Assessment report

lenvatinib–  14  mg,  with  possibility  to  increase  the  dose  up  to  18  mg  if  well  tolerated.  The  14-mg  starting 
dose  will  be  escalated  to  18  mg  if  no  Grade  2  (intolerable)  or  any  Grade  ≥3  treatment-emergent  adverse 
events  that  require  dose  reduction  are  observed  in  the  first  cycle  (4  weeks)  of  treatment.    Further 
characterisation  and  use  of  appropriate  biomarkers  and  PK/PD  models  is  also  expected  (see  discussion  on 
clinical pharmacology and RMP).   
In order to investigate correctly the potential of lenvatinib for CYP3A4 inhibition/induction, an in vivo study 
with midazolam as a probe substrate for CYP3A4, the applicant is requested to conduct a drug-drug 
interaction study to investigate the potential of lenvatinib for CYP3A4 inhibition/induction (study 109).  
Further,  in  order  to  further  charactrerise  the  combination  safety  profile,  Study  307,  218  and  study  221  are 
planned in addition to the ongoing safety studies for lenvatinib monotherapy (Studies 303, 208 and 211). 
Study  218  will  further  evaluate  the  safety  of  lenvatinib-everolimus  combination  and  further  contribute  to 
knowledge  on  PK  and  PK/PD  of  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  and  their  PK  and  PD  interactions  It  will  also 
establish  exposure-safety  and  exposure-efficacy  relationships  and  better  inform  the  choice  of  the  optimal 
starting  dose,  the  results  of  the  integrated  and  mechanism-based  PK/PD  modelling  should  be  submitted  at 
the time of submission of the CSR.  
Study  307 is  requested to  further  characterise  the  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  the  combination  therapy 
and  further  contribute  to  knowledge  on  PK  and  PK/PD  of  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  and  their  PK  and  PD 
interactions.  
Study  221  will  continue  to  characterize  safety  for  the  combination  treatment  in  patients  with  non  clear  cell 
renal carcinoma.   
The studies requested for Lenvima will also provide relevant safety information for this application. Study 303 
will  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  of  lenvatinib  in  patients  with  RR-DTC  in  a  randomized,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 study. This will enable to continue to characterize/ confirm current and long-term 
safety profile of lenvatinib in monotherapy in another indication (DTC). Study 208 will contribute to the long-
term safety profile of lenvatinib in patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Study 211 will determine whether a 
starting  dose  of  lenvatinib  20  mg  or  14  mg  QD  will  provide  comparable  efficacy  (based  on  Objective 
Response Rate at 6 months [ORR6M]) with an improved safety profile to 24 mg QD (based on TEAE Grade 3 
or higher in the first 6 months after randomization). 
For further details on the above mentioned studies, please see RMP section 2.7 below. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall safety profile of lenvatinib-everolimus combination is consistent with known safety profiles of its 
components  observed  either  in  other  indications  (for  lenvatinib)  or  in  the  intended  indication  (for 
everolimus). The reported toxicity was in general predictable and manageable. No new safety signal has been 
reported. The incidences and severity of some of the adverse events are increased due to an additive and/or 
synergic  effect  of  the  combination.  However,  most  of  these  were  well  managed  by  dose  reduction, 
interruption or by additional medical treatment. 
However,  precaution  is  warranted  given  a  small  size  of  safety  database,  a limited information  on  long-term 
toxicity, and a limited data on PK/PD interactions together with indication on potential for worsening toxicity 
for  VEGFRi  -mTOR  inhibitor  combinations  in  general.  Although  toxicity  appears  to  be  manageable  with  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 144/162 
  
  
 
intended combination, an onset of more frequent or severe toxicity may occur in a larger database and/or at 
longer term.  
Poor  tolerability  of  the  combination  is  manifest  with  high  rates  of  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  and  dose 
modifications.  
Therefore, further studies need to be conducted in relevant clinical setting in order to provide comprehensive 
data  and  to  improve  tolerability  profile  of  the  combination  in  view  of  a  limited  safety  database  for  the 
combination  treatment  at  intended  doses/schedule,  related  uncertainties  and  poor  tolerability  of  the 
combination (high rate of treatment discontinuation and dose modifications).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety (please see section 
2.7 of the RMP): 
Study  307 is  requested to  further  characterise  the  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  the  combination  therapy 
and  further  contribute  to  knowledge  on  PK  and  PK/PD  of  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  and  their  PK  and  PD 
interactions.  
Study 218 will further evaluate the safety of lenvatinib-everolimus combination and contribute to knowledge 
on  PK  and  PK/PD  of  lenvatinib  and  everolimus  and  their  PK  and  PD  interactions.  It  will  also  establish 
exposure-safety  and  exposure-efficacy  relationships  and  better  inform  on  the  choice  of  the  optimal  starting 
dose. The results of the integrated and mechanism-based PK/PD modelling should be submitted at the time 
of submission of the CSR.  
Study  221  will  continue  to  characterize  safety  for  the  combination  treatment  in  patients  with  non  clear  cell 
renal carcinoma.   
Study 010 will assess in vitro lenvatinib protein binding, determine the unbound drug concentrations in order 
to define correctly the dose-adjustment in patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment. 
Studies  requested  for  Lenvima  will  also  provide  relevant  safety  information  for  this  application  (please  see 
section 2.7 of the RMP). Study 303 will evaluate the long-term safety of lenvatinib in patients with RR-DTC in 
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study. Study 208 will determine the long-term safety 
profile  of  lenvatinib  in  patients  with  advanced  thyroid  cancer.  Study  211  will  determine  whether  a  lower 
starting dose of lenvatinib will provide comparable efficacy (based on Objective Response Rate at 6 months 
[ORR6M])  with  an  improved  safety  profile  to  24  mg  QD  (based  on  TEAE  Grade  3  or  higher  in  the  first  6 
months  after  randomization).  Study  109  will  investigate  correctly  the  potential  of  lenvatinib  for  CYP3A4 
inhibition/induction.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 8.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lenvatinib (lenvatinib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The initially claimed indication is: 
“Lenvatinib  is  indicated  in  combination  with  everolimus  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  unresectable 
advanced  or  metastatic  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC)  following  one  prior  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor 
(VEGF)-targeted therapy”. 
The agreed indication is: 
Assessment report  
EMA/578759/2016 
Page 155/162 
  
  
 
 
“Kisplyx is indicated in combination with everolimus for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal 
cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted prior therapy”. 
Renal  cell  carcinoma  is  the  third  leading  urologic  cancer.  About  30%  of  patients  with  RCC  have  metastatic 
disease  at  the time of  diagnosis,  and  a  significant  proportion  of  patients  with localized  disease  treated with 
curative nephrectomy relapse subsequently with metastatic disease. Metastatic RCC is associated with a high 
quality-of-life burden. About 8% to 22.5% of mRCC patients survive for five  years or more as compared to 
90%  of  patients  with  localized  renal  cancer,  but  survival  rates  increase  with  the  use  of  new  therapies  and 
depend  on  several  prognostic  factors.  Patient  population  is  heterogeneous  in  terms  of  clinical  (prognostic 
factors) and molecular determinants. 
The  incidence  of  mRCC  is  increasing,  and  the  disease  is  still  considered  incurable.  The  most  frequent 
locations of metastases are the lungs, mediastinum, bone, liver, and brain. 
In  patients  with  advanced  RCC,  the  aim  of  therapy  is  to  prolong  PFS,  to  achieve  high  response  rate,  to 
prolong  survival  and  to  improve  quality  of  life.  In  second  line  setting  only  few  agents  could  demonstrate 
benefit in terms of OS (e.g. nivolumab) and most of therapies approved in second line could show PFS benefit 
in  randomised  phase  3  trials,  although  with  different  magnitude  of  effect  (median  PFS  ranging  from  4  to  7 
months). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current  approved  treatments  for  metastatic  RCC  in  the  first-line  setting  comprise  targeted  therapies,  either 
tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKI;  sunitinib;  pazopanib)  or  mammalian  target  of  rapamycin  (mTOR)  inhibitors 
(temsirolimus) administered as single agents, bevacizumab + interferon, or high-dose interleukin-2. 
Approved  second-line  agents  include  TKIs:  sorafenib,  sunitinib,  axitinib,  and  pazopanib  and  the  mTOR 
inhibitor everolimus. 
A  novel  immunotherapeutic  agent,  belonging  to  a  class  of  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors  (PD-1/PD-L1),  has 
been recently granted approval by the EC. Opdivo (nivolumab) as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment 
of advanced renal cell carcinoma after prior therapy in adults. 
Afinitor, intended to be used at a half of the recommended dose in combination with lenvatinib, is indicated 
for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, whose disease has progressed on or after 
treatment  with  VEGF-targeted  therapy.  The  recommended  dose  is  10  mg  everolimus  once  daily.  Treatment 
should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  application  is  based  on  a  Phase  1b/2  study  205  (n=173)  consisting  of  dose-finding  part  to  determine 
DLTs/MTD/RP2D  (n=20)  and  randomised  open-label  3-arm  part  (n=153),  with  lenvatinib-everolimus 
combination (18mg/5mg), single-agent lenvatinib (24mg QD) and single-agent everolimus (10mg QD) arms.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Beneficial effects 
The  combination  of  lenvatinib  plus  everolimus  significantly  prolonged  PFS  compared  to  single-agent 
everolimus  with  a  median  PFS  of  14.6  months  (95%  CI:  5.9,  20.1)  for  the  combination  versus  5.5  months 
(95%  CI:  3.5,  7.1)  for  everolimus  (HR=0.40,  95%  CI:  0.24,  0.68,  p=0.0005),  by  investigator  assessment 
and analysis. An independent imaging review (IIR) was conducted and the results obtained, for PFS and ORR, 
corroborated the improvements seen in the investigator analyses. The IIR results showed PFS of 12.8 months 
with  the  proposed  combination  compared  to  5.6  months  with  everolimus  alone  (HR=  0.45,  95%  CI= 
0.26,0.79, p=0.003). 
The observed PFS benefit was consistent with results for secondary endpoints of OS and ORR. 
At 3 different time points, the combination of lenvatinib plus everolimus consistently showed a trend towards 
prolonged survival compared with everolimus, with HRs (95%CI; p-value) of 0.55 (0.30, 1.01; p=0.06), 0.51 
(0.30, 0.88; p=0.02), and 0.59 (0.36, 0.96; p=0.06), respectively. 
The  ORR  for  the  combination  was  greater  than  the  ORR  for  everolimus  with  43.1%  (1  CR  and  21  PRs)  and 
6%  (3  PRs),  respectively.  The  independent  imaging  review  analyses  showed  an  ORR  of  35.3%  for  the 
combination compared to 0% in the everolimus arm. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  Study  205  is  of  modest  size  (153  patients)  and  was  not  powered  to  demonstrate  OS  benefit.  Due to  a 
small sample size the benefit in subgroups could not be comprehensively assessed. Of note, patient reported 
outcomes have not been collected and impact on quality of life is uncertain.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Diarrhoea,  hypercholesterolemia,  and  hypothyroidism  were  identified  as  worsening  safety  signals  with  the 
combination treatment compared with lenvatinib and everolimus as monotherapy. 
Grade  3  and  4  events  occurred  in  higher  proportion  of  patients  allocated  to  lenvatinib  plus  everolimus  arm 
(79%) compared to single-agent everolimus (54%).  
SAEs  were  reported  in  38  subjects  (61.3%)  in  the combination  safety  group and in  21  subjects  (42.0%)  in 
the everolimus arm. 
The rate of discontinuations due to AEs was reported as 29% in pooled safety data set with intended dosing 
regimen and as 12 % in the everolimus arm. 
Adverse  events  leading  to  dose  reductions,  interruptions  and  modifications  (redaction  and/or  interruptions) 
were  reported  respectively  in  68%,  76%  and  89  %  of  patients  in  combination  group  and  in  16  %,  50  and 
54% of patients in the everolimus arm. 
The  overall  safety  profile  of  the  combination  was  consistent  with  known  safety  profiles  of  individual 
components,  toxicity  was  predictable  and  in  general  manageable.  No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  to 
date.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database is limited in terms of sample size (62 patients treated in the intended indication with the 
intended dose regimen, including 11 in dose-finding part of the study) and in terms of duration of exposure. 
It  is  unknown  whether  worsening  of  toxicity,  earlier  onset  or  higher  severity  of  ADRs  might  occur  in  larger 
sample size population and whether underlying PK and/or PD interactions could contribute to such worsening. 
Insufficient knowledge on PK and PD drug-drug interactions between lenvatinib and everolimus confers risk of 
potentially  higher  toxicity.  With  regard  to  potential  interactions  between  lenvatinib  and  everolimus,  further 
exploration is still needed.  
In  order  to  better  understand  the  combination  safety  profile,  including  long-term  toxicity,  Studies  307,  218 
and  221  are  planned  in  addition  to  the  already  ongoing  safety  studies  for  lenvatinib  monotherapy  (Studies 
303, 208 and 211). 
It is unknown whether alternative dose/regimen will result in better tolerability of the combination. Study 218 
will assess whether a starting dose of lenvatinib 14 mg in combination with everolimus 5 mg once daily (QD) 
will provide comparable efficacy with an improved safety profile compared to lenvatinib 18 mg in combination 
with  everolimus  5  mg,  and  to  assess  PK  and  PK/PD  of  the  two  drugs  and  related  interactions.  It  will  also 
establish  exposure-safety  and  exposure-efficacy  relationships  and  better  inform  the  choice  of  the  optimal 
starting  dose,  the  results  of  the  integrated  and  mechanism-based  PK/PD  modelling  should  be  submitted  at 
the time of submission of the CSR.  
Study  307 is  requested to  further  characterise  the  safety  profile  and  tolerability  of  the  combination  therapy 
and will contribute to understanding of PK, PK/PD of both drugs and their interactions.  
Study 221 will assess the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy in non-clear cell RCC patients, the 
MAH should conduct and submit the results of this Phase 2 Trial.  
The level of lenvatinib protein binding is yet not known while the assessment of renal and hepatic impairment 
should  be  based  on  free  fraction.  Study  010  will  provide  data  to  better  define  the  dose-adjustments  in 
patients with severe hepatic and renal impairment.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  observed  magnitude  of  the  PFS  gain  and  the  magnitude  of  ORR  in  the  combination  arm  compared  to 
everolimus  arm  are  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  in  the  second-line  treatment  of  advanced 
RCC, a disease with currently evolving unmet medical need. New therapeutic options are needed to improve 
outcomes,  particularly  in  terms  of  overall  survival,  and  also  PFS.  The  intended  combination  showed 
improvement  in  PFS  compared  to  standard  treatment.  Blinded  independent  imaging  review  and  conducted 
sensitivity  analyses  provide  reassurance  regarding  the  robustness  of  data.  OS  data  are  supportive  and 
consistent  with  PFS/ORR  data.  The  magnitude  of  PFS  benefit  is  of  particular  value  in  this  clinical  setting  in 
patients  that  have  already  received  prior  VEGF-targeted  therapy.  The  overall  safety  profile  of  combination 
observed was consistent with known safety profiles of individual components, was predictable and in general 
manageable. No new safety signals were identified to date. This observation is reassuring and of importance 
for a combination therapy in view of unacceptable toxicities observed with other similar combinations.  
However, the small safety database represents a limitation in the assessment of the safety profile. There are 
several  post-authorisation  studies  (study  218,  307,  221,  205)  which  will  further  characterise  the  safety 
profile of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus.

A full understanding of the safety profile will be investigated in planned or on-going studies. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
An improvement in PFS benefit with the combination everolimus+lenvatinib treatment compared with 
everolimus monotherapy was observed in a single, small, open-label study. The benefits of Kisplyx in 
combination with everolimus outweigh the risks. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: further studies 
and collection of real-life data are recommended to further address uncertainties. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus for the treatment of adult patients with 
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted 
therapy is considered positive.   
The CHMP recommends the approval of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus for the treatment of adult 
patients  with  advanced  renal  cell  carcinoma  (RCC)  following  one  prior  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor 
(VEGF)-targeted therapy.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The  CHMP  by  consensus  is  of  the  opinion  that  Kisplyx  is  not  similar  to  Nexavar  (sorafenib  tosylate)  and 
Torisel  (temsirolimus)  within  the  meaning  of  Article  3  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  847/200.  See 
Annex 7. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Kisplyx is positive in the following indication: 
Kisplyx is indicated in combination with everolimus for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal 
cell carcinoma (RCC) following one prior vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

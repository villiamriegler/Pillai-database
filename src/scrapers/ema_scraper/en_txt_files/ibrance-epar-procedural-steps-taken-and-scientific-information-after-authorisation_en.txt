relevant discontinuation recommendations and a 
warning based on a safety cumulative review. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP is 
updated to reclassify the risk of ILD/pneumonitis 
from an important potential to an important 
identified risk. Furthermore, long term use has been 
removed from missing information in the list of 
safety concerns. In addition, the due date for 
submission of the final CSR of study A5481027 listed 
as a Category 3 study in the RMP is updated. The

Ibrance when taken in combination with endocrine therapy. 
Across clinical trials, 1.4% of Ibrance-treated patients had 
ILD/pneumonitis of any grade, 0.1% had Grade 3, and no 
Grade 4 or fatal cases were reported. Additional cases of 
ILD/pneumonitis have been observed in the post-marketing 
setting, with fatalities reported. Patients should be 
monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of 
ILD/pneumonitis (e.g. hypoxia, cough, dyspneoa). In 
patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms 
and are suspected to have developed ILD/pneumonitis, 
Ibrance should be interrupted immediately and the patient

neutropenia in the first 6 cycles, complete blood counts for 
subsequent cycles should be monitored every 3 months, 
prior to the beginning of a cycle and as clinically indicated. 
The effect of palbociclib on the QT interval corrected for 
heart rate (QTc) interval was evaluated using time matched 
electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluating the change from 
baseline and corresponding pharmacokinetic data in 77 
patients with advanced breast cancer. Palbociclib did not 
prolong the QTc to any clinically relevant extent at the 
recommended dose of 125 mg daily. 
Based on an analysis of the cumulative pharmacokinetic, 
safety, and efficacy data across Asian and non-Asian 
populations, no dose adjustment based on Asian race is 
considered necessary.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for zonisamide, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
A 2014 publication in Obstetrics and Gynecology by Hernandez-Diaz et al., suggested a decrease in 
mean birth weight and length among neonates exposed in utero to zonisamide and an increased 
prevalence of ‘small for gestational age’ (SGA) compared to lamotrigine-exposed neonates. An update 
to the product information is therefore required based on these results, to add the potential for low 
birth weight and SGA in infants exposed to zonisamide in utero to section 4.6 of the SmPC. It is also 
recommended that the existing warnings in sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the SmPC be further improved 
regarding the need to advise women of child-bearing potential on the risks of anti-epileptic drugs in 
pregnancy. Corresponding changes are made to the Package leaflet. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for zonisamide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing zonisamide is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

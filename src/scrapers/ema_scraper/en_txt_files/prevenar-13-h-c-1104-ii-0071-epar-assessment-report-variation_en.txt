1.   Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
[P/0161/2012] on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP [P/0161/2012] was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Prevenar 13 was developed as a successor to 7vPnC for use in infants and young children to prevent 
pneumococcal disease (IPD, pneumonia, and acute otitis media [AOM]) caused by the 13 pneumococcal 
serotypes (serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) contained in the vaccine. 
13vPnC has also been licensed to prevent pneumococcal disease in adults 50 years and older. Starting at 
about age 50 years, adults are recognised to be at increased risk for developing pneumococcal disease.  
The incidence of IPD is greatest at the extremes of life; however, the incidence of pneumococcal disease 
and associated hospitalisation rates and mortality in younger adults, especially those with risk conditions, 
are substantial. 
Currently, recommendations in most European countries advise vaccination of younger adults, 18 to 64 
years of age, who are at higher risk of IPD with one dose of 23vPS. In some countries smokers and 
subjects with alcohol abuse were added to the high-risk group recently and are also recommended to 
receive 1 dose of 23vPS, as stated for example by the immunisation guidelines from Ireland. 
However, effective protection of 23vPS has not been confirmed in immunocompromised subjects with 
conditions such as solid or hematologic malignancy, organ or bone marrow transplant or on 
immunosuppressive therapy. In the only large, randomised placebo controlled efficacy trial of 23vPS in 
immunocompromised young Ugandan adults suffering from HIV infection, 23vPS was not protective 
against first-event IPD or all cause pneumonia (ACP). 
To overcome the limited immunogenicity of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines, the protein 
conjugation technology was applied to the development of 7vPnC and 13vPnC. In these conjugate 
vaccines, each pneumococcal polysaccharide is covalently conjugated to the diphtheria cross-reactive 
material 197 (CRM197) protein, which acts as an immunologic carrier. Thus, 13vPnC would provide an 
alternative vaccine to the currently recommended pneumococcal free polysaccharide vaccine to protect 
adults 18 to 49 years of age who are at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. 
Results from cohort 3 of study 6115A1-004 (B1851019) in 18 to 49-year-old adults support the use of 
13vPnC in this age group. The rationale to extend the use of 13vPnC for adults beginning at 18 years of 
age is based on the burden of disease, risk groups and the limited benefits of 23vPS. 
Evaluation of serotype-specific immune responses after administration of 13vPnC to young adults 18 to 
49 years of age in cohort 3 of study 6115A1-004 (B1851019) indicates that 13vPnC elicits similar or 
greater functional antibody responses compared to those observed in the 60 to 64-year-old group (cohort 
1) and, therefore, is expected to confer similar benefits for the younger population.

2.2.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
No dose response studies were conducted for this extension indication. Considering that the same dose is 
recommended for adults 50 years and older as well as adolescents, the choice of dose is considered 
adequate. 
2.3.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Study 6115A1-004 compared the immunogenicity, tolerability, and safety of 13vPnC and 23vPS in adults 
60 to 64 years of age (cohort 1) who had not previously been vaccinated with 23vPS, using a randomised, 
double-blind design. The study also included a cohort of subjects 50 to 59 years of age (cohort 2), and a 
cohort of subjects 18 to 49 years of age (cohort 3). Data for cohort 2 (aged 50 to 59 years) were included 
in the submission for licensure of13vPnC in adults aged 50 years and older, while data for cohort 3 (aged 
18 to 49 years) were submitted to support the extension of the adult indication to include individuals aged 
18 to 49 years. As 23vPS is not generally recommended in the younger adult age groups, 13vPnC 
antibody responses in cohorts 2 and 3 were not directly compared to responses after 23vPS, but were 
compared to antibody responses elicited by 13vPnC in the 60 to 64 year age group (cohort 1). As cohort 
1 included a direct comparison to 23vPS, this design allowed for indirect comparison of antibody 
responses in cohorts 2 and 3 to 23vPS. 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study Participants  
Subjects eligible for the study were healthy (as determined by medical history, physical examination, and 
clinical judgment of the investigator) male or female adults 60 to 64 years of age (cohort 1), 50 to 59 
years of age (cohort 2), or 18 to 49 years of age (cohort 3). Subjects with pre-existing stable disease (as 
specified in the protocol) were eligible. Subjects had to be able to complete an electronic diary (e-diary) 
and follow study procedures, and were expected to be available for the duration of the trial. 
Subjects were excluded if they had previously been vaccinated with any licensed or experimental 
pneumococcal vaccine, had a documented Streptococcus pneumoniae infection within the past 5 years, 
had any other disorder that in the investigator’s opinion precluded them from participating in the study, 
or had any of the other exclusion criteria specified in the protocol. 
Treatments 
13vPnC contains saccharides from pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 
and 23F individually conjugated to a nontoxic mutant form of diphtheria toxin cross-reactive material 197 
(CRM197). The vaccine is formulated to contain 2.2 μg of each saccharide, except for 4.4 μg of 6B, per 
0.5-mL dose1 Each dose is formulated in 5.0 mM succinate and 0.85% sodium chloride (NaCl) at pH 5.8 
with 0.125 mg aluminum as aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) and 0.02% polysorbate 80. The vaccine was to 
be prefilled into single-dose syringes without preservatives. Study vaccine was administered by 
intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study with respect to cohort 3 was: 
• 
To demonstrate that the immune response to the 13 serotypes in the 13vPnC in the 18 to 49 year-old 
age group is noninferior to the immune response to 13vPnC in the 60 to 64 year-old age group as 
measured by serotype specific opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) titers 1 month after vaccination.

The secondary objectives of this study with respect to cohort 3 were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To demonstrate that the proportion of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥ lower limit of quantitation 
(LLOQ) in the 18 to 49 year-old age group is noninferior to the proportion of subjects achieving an 
OPA titer ≥ LLOQ in the 60 to 64 year-old age group measured 1 month after vaccination. 
To demonstrate that the immune response to the 13 serotypes in the 13vPnC in each subgroup 
(18-29 years, 30-39 years and 40-49 years) is noninferior to the immune response to 13vPnC in the 
60 to 64 year-old age group as measured by serotype-specific OPA titers 1 month after vaccination. 
To evaluate the immune responses 1 month after vaccination with 13vPnC in the 18 to 49 year-old 
age group compared to the immune responses 1 month after vaccination with 13vPnC in the 60 to 64 
year-old age group as measured by serotypespecific fold rise OPA geometric mean titers (GMTs). 
To evaluate the immune responses 1 month after vaccination with 13vPnC in each subgroup (18-29 
years, 30-39 years and 40-49 years) compared to the immune responses 1 month after vaccination 
with 13vPnC in the 60 to 64 year-old age group as measured by serotype-specific fold rise OPA GMTs. 
The exploratory objectives of this study with respect to cohort 3 were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To demonstrate that 13vPnC in the 18 to 49 year-old age group is as immunogenic as 13vPnC in the 
60 to 64 year-old age group as measured by serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody 
concentrations 1 month after vaccination in a subset of 100 subjects. 
To demonstrate that 13vPnC in each subgroup (18-29 years, 30-39 years, and 40-49 years) is as 
immunogenic as 13vPnC in the 60 to 64 year-old age group as measured by serotype-specific IgG 
antibody concentrations 1 month after vaccination in a subset of 100 subjects in each (sub)group. 
To evaluate the immune responses 1 month after vaccination with 13vPnC in the 18 to 49 year-old 
age group compared to the immune responses 1 month after vaccination with 13vPnC in the 60 to 64 
year-old age group as measured by serotype-specific fold rise IgG GMCs in a subset of 100 subjects 
in each group. 
To evaluate the immune responses 1 month after vaccination with 13vPnC in each subgroup (18-29 
years, 30-39 years, and 40-49 years) compared to the immune responses 1 month after vaccination 
with 13vPnC in the 60 to 64 year-old age group as measured by serotype-specific fold rise IgG GMCs 
in a subset of 100 subjects in each (sub)group.  
To assess persistence of antibody by IgG and OPA in the 18-49 year old age group and each of the 
subgroups (18-29 years, 30-39 years, and 40-49 years) 1 year after vaccination in a subset of 100 
subjects per subgroup. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Blood samples were collected before study vaccine administration at visit 1 and approximately 1 month 
after study vaccine administration for cohort 3, with blood samples also collected approximately 1 year 
after study vaccine administration for subjects in cohort 3 who enrolled under protocol amendment 4. 
Functional antibody titers for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes contained in 13vPnC were determined for all 
subjects for blood samples collected at baseline and 1-month after vaccination using OPA assays. In 
addition, OPA titers were determined for blood samples collected at 1 year after vaccination for randomly 
selected subsets of 100 subjects in cohort 1 (100 in each vaccine group) and cohort 3 (100 in each of the 
3 age subgroups).  
The serotype-specific OPA assays do not use an external reference standard and therefore OPA titers 
cannot be compared across serotypes. An OPA titer is defined as the interpolated reciprocal serum

dilution that results in complement mediated killing of 50% of the bacteria in each OPA assay. The lowest 
titer that can be determined in OPA assays is a titer of 1:8 (limit of detection, LOD) and is the same for 
each serotype-specific OPA assay. However, to quantify functional antibodies in the OPA assays with 
appropriate precision and accuracy, the LLOQ was determined for each serotype-specific OPA assay 
during assay validation. The LLOQ for each serotype-specific OPA assay was used as a cut-off to 
determine serum response for the immunogenicity subjects. OPA titers above the LLOQ were considered 
accurate and their quantitated values were reported. Titers below the LLOQ or denoted below the level of 
quantitation were set to 0.5*LOD for analysis. Previously, an OPA serum response was determined using 
an OPA titer cut-off of 1:8 for all serotype-specific OPA assays in exploratory analyses for the 13vPnC 
vaccine assessments in support of an infant/young children indication. However, additional more 
stringent qualification and validation of the improved microcolony OPA (mcOPA) assays used in this study 
did not support a universal LLOQ of 1:8 for the quantitation of a serum response and thus the following 
cut-offs (LLOQs) were used for the mcOPA: serotype 1, 1:18; serotype 3, 1:12; serotype 4, 1:21; 
serotype 5, 1:29; serotype 6A, 1:37; serotype 6B, 1:43; serotype 7F, 1:210; serotype 9V, 1:345; 
serotype 14, 1:35; serotype 18, 1:31; serotype 19A, 1:18; serotype 19F, 1:48; and serotype 23F, 1:13. 
Serum concentrations of serotype-specific polysaccharide IgG binding antibodies were determined for 
each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes contained in 13vPnC using a standardized enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serotype-specific polysaccharide IgG concentrations were determined for 
all 3 blood samples (baseline, 1 month after vaccination, and 1 year after vaccination) for the same 
subsets of 100 subjects selected for the 1-year postvaccination OPA analyses. 
Sample size 
Sample sizes of 350 evaluable subjects in cohort 3 and cohort 1 would provide at least 90% overall power 
to declare noninferiority of the response in cohort 3 (based on OPA GMTs) relative to cohort 1 for all 13 
pneumococcal antigens using a 2-fold noninferiority criterion (cohort 3/cohort 1). Assuming a dropout 
rate of no more than 5%, 370 subjects per group should achieve 350 evaluable subjects per group. As 
part of Amendment 4 to the protocol, the sample size in cohort 3 was increased in order to provide 
sufficient power for comparisons of age subgroups (18 to 29, 30 to 39, and 40 to 49 years of age) to the 
60-64 year age group. A total of 274 evaluable subjects in each of the subgroups would provide 
approximately 80% power to declare noninferiority between each subgroup and cohort 1 (60 to 64 years 
of age). Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 9% in each of the subgroups, a total of 900 subjects 
(300 subjects in each subgroup) were to be enrolled in cohort 3.

Statistical methods 
For cohort 3, the primary immunologic comparisons were the serotype specific OPA responses to the 13 
pneumococcal serotypes contained in 13vPnC measured 1 month after study vaccine administration in 
cohort 3 (subjects 18 to 49 years of age) relative to the responses among subjects vaccinated with 
13vPnC in cohort 1 (subjects 60 to 64 years of age). The primary endpoint for the cohort 3 and cohort 1 
comparison was the serotype specific OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination. The secondary endpoint for 
the cohort 3 and cohort 1 comparison was the proportion of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥ LLOQ for 
each serotype 1 month after vaccination.

The serotype specific OPA GMTs and fold rise OPA GMTs for each serotype 1 month after vaccination were 
the endpoints for the secondary immunologic comparisons between age subgroups of cohort 3 (18 to 29, 
30 to 39, and 40 to 49 groups) and cohort 1. Exploratory comparison endpoints were the 
serotype-specific IgG concentrations measured 1 month after vaccination, as well as the 
serotype-specific IgG concentrations and OPA titres measured 1 year after vaccination. 
2.3.2.  Results 
Participant flow  
Disposition of subjects through the 6-month follow-up contact is summarized for cohort 3 in Table 1. 
There were 67 subjects that were screened but not assigned to receive vaccine; 64 of these subjects 
provided written informed consent and 3 of these subjects had not provided written informed consent. In 
cohort 3, 900 subjects provided written informed consent to participate in the study. One of these 
subjects gave consent, was assigned to cohort 3, and then withdrew consent prior to vaccination. This 
subject was then withdrawn from the study. 
The majority of subjects assigned to cohort 3 completed the 1-month blood draw (98.1%) and the 
6-month contact (94.9%) as shown in Table 1. Similar results were seen for each of the 18 to 29, 30 to 
39, and 40 to 49 year-old age subgroups in cohort 3.

Numbers analysed 
The evaluable immunogenicity population was the primary immunogenicity analysis population for cohort 
1 and cohort 3. The evaluable immunogenicity populations comprised subjects who were eligible for the 
study, adhered to protocol requirements, had valid and determinate assay results, and had no major 
protocol violations. Analyses were also performed on data for the all-available immunogenicity 
population, which included all subjects with at least 1 valid and determinate assay result related to the 
proposed analysis. The majority of the randomized subjects in cohort 1 (99.8%) met the criterion for 
inclusion in the all-available immunogenicity population; 1 subject in cohort 1 was excluded for having no 
assay result, before or after vaccination, for any serotype. All of the subjects assigned to cohort 3 were 
included in the all-available immunogenicity population.  
Summary of Main immunogenicity Results 
For cohort 3, the primary immunologic comparisons were the serotype specific OPA responses to the 13 
pneumococcal serotypes contained in 13vPnC measured 1 month after study vaccine administration in 
cohort 3 (subjects 18 to 49 years of age) relative to the responses among subjects vaccinated with 
13vPnC in cohort 1 (subjects 60 to 64 years of age). Noninferiority was declared if the lower limit of the 
2-sided, 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs (GMT for cohort 3/GMT for cohort 1) was greater than 0.5 (2-fold

criterion). As shown in Table 4, for the evaluable immunogenicity population, this criterion was met for all 
13 serotypes.

Subjects Aged 18-49 Years (Cohort 3) and 60-64 Years (Cohort 1) – Evaluable Immunogenicity 
Population 
a. n = Number of subjects with a determinate OPA titer to the given serotype. 
b. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) were calculated using all subjects with available data for the specified blood draw. 
c. Ratio of GMTs, Cohort 3 to Cohort 1, is calculated by back transforming the mean difference between cohorts on the logarithmic scale. 
d. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio are back transformations of a confidence interval based on the 
Student t distribution for the mean difference of the logarithms of the measures (Cohort 3 – Cohort 1). 
The primary comparison demonstrated that the OPA titres after vaccination were non-inferior in subjects 
18-49 compared to subjects 60-64, as expected. 
Secondary comparisons 
For cohort 3, the secondary immunologic comparisons were of the serotype-specific OPA GMTs measured 
1 month after vaccination in subjects in age subgroups of cohort 3 (18 to 29, 30 to 39, and 40 to 49 
year-old groups) with those in subjects vaccinated with 13vPnC in cohort 1. For all 3 age subgroups of 
cohort 3, the immune response was noninferior to that for cohort 1 for all 13 serotypes. In addition, the 
immune response in each of the 3 age subgroups in cohort 3 was statistically significantly higher than the 
response among subjects receiving 13vPnC in cohort 1 for all serotypes except serotype 3.  
OPA GMTs before vaccination, 1 month after vaccination and 1 year after vaccination for cohort 3 and the 
13vPnC group in cohort 1 are presented in Table 5 for the evaluable immunogenicity population. Except 
for serotype 3, the OPA GMTs were higher for cohort 3 than for cohort 1 at 1 month after vaccination and 
1 year after vaccination. Among the age subgroups, in general the OPA GMTs were highest for the 
subjects in the 18 to 29 year-old age subgroup and lowest in the 40 to 49 year-old age subgroup.

In the evaluable population, GMFRs from before vaccination to 1 month after vaccination ranged from 
12.3 (serotype 3) to 407.6 (serotype 6A) in cohort 3, and from 13.5 (serotype 3) to 184.7 (serotype 6A) 
in cohort 1. Comparisons of OPA GMFRs at 1 month after vaccination between cohort 3 and cohort 1 were 
presented. Although not pre-specified, the same criterion that was used for the demonstration of a 
statistically significantly higher response of other geometric mean comparisons (lower limit of the 
2-sided, 95% CI for the ratio >1) was used for the comparisons of OPA GMFRs. The OPA GMFRs in cohort 
3 were statistically significantly higher than the OPA GMFRs among subjects receiving 13vPnC in cohort 1 
for 6 of 13 serotypes (serotypes 1,5, 6A, 18C, 19F, and 23F) in the evaluable population. In the evaluable 
population, GMFRs from before vaccination to 1 year after vaccination ranged from 3.3 (serotype 3) to 
86.5 (serotype 6A) in cohort 3, and from 3.1 (serotype 3) to 39.9 (serotype 6A) in cohort 1.

The proportion of subjects in cohort 3 and cohort 1 achieving an OPA titer ≥ LLOQ after vaccination are 
presented in Table 6 for the evaluable immunogenicity population. Although the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) and the clinical study protocol did not specify criteria for statistical significance, using the same 
criterion as in other 13vPnC studies, the immune response in the cohort 3 was statistically significantly 
higher (lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in proportions >0) than in cohort 1 for all serotypes 
except serotype 3.

IgG responses 
Pneumococcal serotype-specific IgG GMCs measured 1 month after vaccination were compared between 
the 13vPnC group in cohort 1 and cohort 3. For the evaluable immunogenicity population, cohort 3 was 
noninferior (lower limit of the 2-sided, 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs >0.5) to cohort 1 for all 13 serotypes 
(Table 7). Although a superiority analysis comparing the immune responses in cohorts 1 and 3 was not 
pre-specified, applying the superiority criterion that was used in the analyses comparing responses 
between the vaccine groups in cohort 1 (lower limit of the 2-sided, 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs >1) 
demonstrates that the immune response to 13vPnC in cohort 3 was significantly higher than the response 
to 13vPnC in cohort 1 for 8 serotypes: 1, 4, 6A, 6B, 14, 19A, 19F, and 23F.

Comparison of Pneumococcal IgG GMCs (μg/mL) 1 Month After Vaccination With 13vPnC 
in a Subset of Subjects Aged 18-49 Years (Cohort 3) and 60-64 Years (Cohort 1) – Evaluable 
Immunogenicity Population 
a. n = Number of subjects with a determinate IgG concentration to the given serotype. 
b. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were calculated using all subjects with available data for the specified blood draw. 
c. Ratio of GMCs, Cohort 3 to Cohort 1, is calculated by back transforming the mean difference between cohorts on the logarithmic scale. 
d. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio are back transformations of a confidence interval based on the Student t distribution for the 
mean difference of the logarithms of the measures (Cohort 3 – Cohort 1). 
IgG GMCs before vaccination, 1 month after vaccination and 1 year after vaccination for cohort 3 and the 
13vPnC group in cohort 1 are presented in Table 8 for the evaluable immunogenicity population. In 
general, the IgG GMCs for cohort 3 were similar to or higher than those for cohort 1 at 1 month after 
vaccination and 1 year after vaccination. Among the age subgroups, in general the IgG GMCs were 
highest for the subjects in the 18 to 29 year-old age subgroup and lowest in the 40 to 49 year-old age 
subgroup.

Immunogenicity Conclusions  
The immune response to the 13 serotypes in 13vPnC in the 18 to 49 year-old age group (cohort 3) was 
noninferior to the immune response to 13vPnC in the 60 to 64 year-old age group (cohort 1) as measured 
by serotype-specific OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination (primary objective) for the evaluable 
immunogenicity population. In addition, the immune response to the 13 serotypes in the 13vPnC in each 
age subgroup (18-29 years, 30-39 years and 40-49 years) in cohort 3 was noninferior to the immune 
response to 13vPnC in cohort 1 as measured by serotype-specific OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination 
(secondary objective). 
In cohort 3, and each of the age subgroups in cohort 3, the immune response as measured by 
serotype-specific OPA GMTs 1 month after vaccination was statistically significantly higher than the 
response among subjects receiving 13vPnC in cohort 1 for all serotypes except serotype 3. 
The MAH has provided an updated discussion on serotype 3 risk of vaccine failures. This issue is also part 
of a follow-up measure (MEA47) as well as under continuous surveillance in the PSURs. The CHMP 
considered that the available data are not sufficient to conclude on a lack of efficacy or effectiveness of 
serotype 3, although some concerning results are available. Taking into account that this issue is not age 
specific, it was considered appropriate to continue its monitoring and assessment within the ongoing 
procedures.  
Among the age subgroups, in general the OPA GMTs were highest for the subjects in the 18 to 29 year-old 
age subgroup and lowest in the 40 to 49 year-old age subgroup at 1 month after vaccination and 1 year 
after vaccination, indicating a lower immune response with increasing age. 
The proportion of subjects achieving a serotype-specific OPA titer ≥ LLOQ in cohort 3 was noninferior to 
the proportion of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥ LLOQ in cohort 1 for all 13 serotypes at 1 month after 
vaccination (secondary objective).  
The immune response to the 13 serotypes in 13vPnC in cohort 3 was noninferior to the immune response 
to 13vPnC in cohort 1 as measured by serotype-specific IgG GMCs 1 month after vaccination (exploratory 
objective) for the evaluable immunogenicity population. Among the age subgroups, in general the IgG 
GMCs were highest for the subjects in the 18 to 29 year-old age subgroup and lowest in the 40 to 49 
year-old age subgroup, indicating a lower immune response with increasing age. 
OPA GMTs and IgG GMCs increased from prevaccination to 1 month after vaccination and then decreased 
from 1 month to 1 year after vaccination but remained higher 1 year after vaccination than at 
prevaccination for cohort 3, for each of the cohort 3 age subgroups (18-29 years, 30-39 years, and 40-49 
years) and cohort 1. 
In conclusion, the immune responses to vaccination with Prevenar 13 in younger adults have been 
convincingly shown to be superior to those of elderly subjects, as expected. There is no serological 
correlate to protection for pneumococcal vaccines in adults, but opsonising antibodies are considered to 
mediate protection against invasive disease. Therefore a high opsonising antibody titre is thought to be 
protective. The OPA GMTs indicated a higher level of protection in the younger adults compared to 60-64 
year old subjects. 
2.3.3.  Discussion 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In an earlier procedure, OPA responses to Prevenar 13 were compared to OPA responses to 23vPS 
vaccine in subjects 60 years of age and older, which was considered relevant as the 23vPS vaccine was 
Prevenar 13 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/795127/2013 
Page 15/36 
 
 
 
considered efficacious in this population. The immune responses to Prevenar 13 were clearly 
non-inferior to the responses to 23vPS vaccine in 60-64 year old subjects, and superior responses were 
seen for 8 serotypes. Based on the outcome of that comparison Prevenar 13 was approved for use in 
adults 50 years of age and older. Therefore, the comparison of immune responses to the age group 
60-64 years (cohort 1) is considered relevant.  
The choice of primary endpoint is also considered relevant, i.e. OPA GMTs, while the secondary 
comparisons, OPA response rate (% of subjects with titres above LLOQ) and ELISA IgG are also 
considered important.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The immune responses seen after vaccination with Prevenar 13 in adults 18-49 years of age are very 
likely to be protective against IPD, and possibly also against non-invasive disease.  
There are no specific recommendations to vaccinate healthy adults with pneumococcal vaccines, and 
the medical need is considered small. However, for adults belonging to risk groups for pneumococcal 
infection Prevenar 13 could provide benefit as a complement to the 23vPS vaccine.  
The responses to the LoQ have clarified that the use in adults 18-49 years is intended primarily for risk 
groups. There are no data on specific risk groups included in the current variation, but another ongoing 
variation aims at including data on risk groups in section 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC, i.e. premature 
children, children with sickle cell disease and HIV infected adults. Thus, some data are available, 
although it is currently unknown to what extent the SmPC will be updated as the variation is still 
ongoing. 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The immune responses seen after vaccination with Prevenar 13 are likely to be protective, and the 
pre-vaccination data indicate that more than half of the subjects could be unprotected from 9-10 of the 
13 Prevenar 13 serotypes. Overall, the benefit of vaccinating healthy adults 18-49 years of age is 
considered limited, but the benefit is considered potentially greater in subjects belonging to risk groups 
in this age group.  
2.4.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.4.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The safety objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC as 
measured by the incidence of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events. 
At study entry, all subjects received 1 dose of open-label 13vPnC administered intramuscularly into the 
deltoid muscle of either arm. Subjects attended a follow-up visit approximately 1 month after vaccination 
and were contacted by telephone for collection of additional follow-up safety information approximately 6 
months after vaccination. 
Safety was evaluated based on information regarding solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs.  Solicited AEs 
included local reactions and systemic events, which were to be evaluated and recorded in an electronic 
diary for 14 days after vaccination. In addition, information was to be reported regarding unsolicited AEs 
that occurred from the day of vaccination through the 1-month post vaccination visit. At the 6-month 
telephone contact, the parent/legal guardian was asked to report any newly diagnosed medical 
conditions, as well as any hospitalisations or serious adverse events (SAEs) that had occurred since the 
1-month follow-up visit.

Although this variation application is focussed only on cohort 3 from this study, safety results from 
cohorts 1 and 2 are shown below for the sake of comparison. 
2.4.2.  Results 
Patient exposure 
A total of 899 subjects (300 in the 18- to 29-year age group, 298 in the 30- to 39-year age group, and 301 
in the 40- to 49-year age group) in cohort 3 were vaccinated. All vaccinated subjects were within the 
protocol-specified age range at the time of vaccination. 
Demographic characteristics for all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study vaccine (safety 
population) are summarised for cohort 3 in Table 9.

Adverse events 
Local Reactions 
At least 1 local reaction was reported within 14 days after vaccine administration for 82.2% of subjects in 
cohort 1, 89.6% of subjects in cohort 2, and 97.3% of subjects in cohort 3 (Table 10). The most frequent 
local reaction was pain, which occurred in 80.1% of subjects in cohort 1, 88.8% of subjects in cohort 2, 
and 96.7% of subjects in cohort 3. The percentage of subjects reporting severe pain was higher in cohort 
3 (16.0%) than in cohort 1 (1.7%) and cohort 2 (3.6%). Most reports of redness, swelling, or limitation 
of arm movement were of mild or moderate severity. Severe redness and severe swelling were each 
reported in <2.8% of subjects in cohorts 1, 2, and 3. The percentage of subjects reporting severe 
limitation of arm movement was much higher in cohort 3 (15.6%) than in cohort 1 (1.7%) and cohort 2 
(2.9%).

subjects (Table 11). The percentages of subjects with any redness, any swelling, and any limitation of 
arm movement were highest in 18- to 29-year-old subjects and lowest in 40- to 49-year-old subjects. 
High, and similar, percentages of subjects reported any pain in the 3 age subgroups. However, the 
percentage of subjects with severe pain was highest in 18- to 29-year-old subjects and lowest in 40- to 
49-year-old subjects. Although the frequency of severe pain and limitation of arm movement was

significantly higher in younger adults in cohort 3 than in older adults in the other 2 cohorts, only 4 
younger adults had unscheduled doctor visits due to pain at the injection site and/or limitation of arm 
movement. In all 4 cases the symptoms were mild or moderate. There was no unscheduled doctor visit for 
severe pain or limitation of arm movement.

The mean durations of local reactions were similar for cohorts 1, 2, and 3, and did not exceed 3.0 days. 
The mean durations of local reactions were similar for the age subgroups in cohort 3, and did not exceed 
2.8 days. Most local reactions occurred during the first 4 days after vaccination and then tapered off in 
cohorts 1, 2, and 3. In cohort 3, the highest values for any local reaction, any pain, any limitation of arm 
movement, and any swelling occurred on day 2. The percentages of subjects with any local reaction, any 
pain, any limitation of arm movement, any redness and any swelling were higher in cohort 3 than in 
cohort 1 or cohort 2 during the first 4 days after vaccination. 
Most local reactions occurred during the first 4 days after vaccination and then tapered off in each of the 
3 age subgroups in cohort 3. Beginning on day 2, the percentages of subjects with any local reaction, any 
pain, any limitation of arm movement, any redness and any swelling were lower in 40- to 49-year-old 
subjects than in 18- to 29-year-old subjects or 30- to 39-year-old subjects. 
Systemic reactions 
At least one systemic event occurring within 14 days after vaccine administration was reported by the 
majority of subjects who received 13vPnC in cohort 3 (approximately 96%), cohort 2 (approximately

84%), and cohort 1 (approximately 83%; Table 12). The 3 most frequently reported systemic events in 
cohort 3 (new generalized muscle pain, headache, and fatigue) were reported by higher percentages of 
subjects in cohort 3 (82.0%, 81.4%, and 80.5%) than in cohort 1 (56.2%, 54.0%, and 63.2%) or cohort 
2 (61.8%, 65.9%, and 63.3%). In general, the percentages of subjects with individual systemic events 
were reported by higher percentages of subjects in cohort 3 than in cohort 1 or cohort 2.

The mean durations of systemic events were generally similar and did not exceed 5.9 days for cohorts 1, 
2, and 3, and 5.8 days for the age subgroups. The mean durations of systemic events were similar for the 
age subgroups in cohort 3, and did not exceed 5.9 days. Systemic events that extended beyond 14 days 
after vaccination were reported by 108 subjects in cohort 3. 
Unsolicited adverse events 
The percentage of subjects reporting any AEs within approximately 1 month after vaccination was similar 
in cohort 3 (14.3%), in cohort 2 (11.4%) and in the 13vPnC group in cohort 1 (17.0%). Most AEs were the 
types of diseases and conditions commonly observed among adults in these age groups. 
In cohort 3, the most frequently occurring types of AEs were infections and infestations (4.4% of 
subjects) and gastrointestinal disorders (2.6%). The most frequently reported individual AEs in cohort 3 
were nausea (12 subjects, 1.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (11 subjects, 1.2%), nasopharyngitis 
(7 subjects, 0.8%), and diarrhoea (6 subjects, 0.7%). 
In cohort 2, the most frequently occurring types of AEs were infections and infestations (4.2% of 
subjects), general disorders and administration site conditions (2.5%), and musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (2.0%). Sinusitis was reported for 4 subjects (1.0%) and arthralgia was 
reported for 3 subjects (0.7%). All other AEs were reported for ≤ 2 subjects each. 
In cohort 1, the most frequently occurring types of AEs were infections and infestations (7.7% of 
subjects) and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (4.1%). The most frequently reported 
individual AEs in cohort 1 were nasopharyngitis (7 subjects, 1.7%), sinusitis (6 subjects, 1.4%); myalgia 
(5 subjects, 1.2%); and upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and gastroenteritis (each in 4 subjects, 
1.0%). 
The percentage of subjects reporting any AEs within approximately 1 month after vaccination was similar 
in the 18- to 29-year-old (13.0%), the 30- to 39-year-old (14.4%), and the 40- to 49-year-old (15.6%) 
age subgroups in cohort 3 (table not recreated in the interest of space). The percentages of subjects 
reporting individual AEs were also similar among the age subgroups. 
Serious adverse events 
SAEs occurring within approximately 1 month after vaccination were reported for 2 subjects (migraine, 
basal cell carcinoma) in cohort 3, for 2 subjects (cellulitis, ovarian cancer) in cohort 2 and for 1 subject 
(hemangioma) in cohort 1. In cohort 3, the migraine was reported by a subject in the 30- to 39-year-old 
age group and the basal cell carcinoma was reported by a subject in the 40- to 49-year-old age group. 
Except for the SAE of migraine reported by the subject in cohort 3, none of the serious AEs reported within 
1 month after vaccination in cohorts 1, 2, and 3 were considered by the investigator to be related to study 
vaccine, and all of the SAEs were considered to have resolved. 
SAEs were reported at the 6-month follow-up contact for 2 subjects (0.2%) in cohort 3, for 5 subjects 
(1.2%) in cohort 2, and for 12 subjects (2.9%) in cohort 1. In cohort 3, the types of SAEs reported at the 
6-month follow-up contact included reproductive system and breast disorders and injury, poisoning and 
procedural complications. An SAE in the category of injury, poisoning and procedural complications was 
also reported in cohort 2. With that exception, the types of SAEs seen in the older cohorts were not 
reported in cohort 3 at the 6-month follow-up contact.

In cohort 3, the SAE of hip fracture was reported by 1 subject in the 30- to 39-year-old subgroup and the 
SAE of ovarian cyst ruptured was reported by 1 subject in the 18- to 29-year-old subgroup (CSR Table 
49). Both SAEs were severe in intensity, neither was considered by the investigator to be related to study 
vaccine, and both of the SAEs were considered to have resolved. 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported for subjects in cohort 3, or in cohort 2. One (1) subject in cohort 1 died due to 
pancreatic cancer and liver cancer. These events were considered unrelated to study vaccine. 
Laboratory findings 
This section is not applicable because, with the exception of immunogencity testing, laboratory 
evaluations were not performed in Study 6115A1-004. 
Safety in special populations 
This section is not applicable because the submission comprises only data from Study 6115A1-004, 
cohort 3. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
No AEs that led to withdrawal were reported for cohort 3, cohort 2, or for subjects who received 13vPnC 
in cohort 1. 
Post marketing experience 
This section is not applicable because 13vPnC is not currently approved for use in adults 18 to 49 years of 
age. 
2.4.3.  Discussion 
The safety of 13vPnC administered to the 18- to 49-year-old subjects in cohort 3 was compared with the 
safety of the 13vPnC vaccine administered to the older subjects (60 to 64 years old and 50 to 59 years 
old) in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. The safety of 13vPnC administered to subjects in each of the age 
subgroups in cohort 3 was also assessed. 
Local reactions and systemic events occurring within 14 days after vaccine administration were, in 
general, reported by higher percentages of subjects in cohort 3 compared with the older subjects in 
cohorts 1 and 2. In the age subgroups in cohort 3, in general, the percentages of subjects with local 
reactions and systemic events were generally highest in the youngest (18- to 29-year-old) age subgroup. 
In cohort 3, 62.9% of the subjects in the evaluable population reported they had never smoked. Overall, 
medical histories for subjects in cohort 3 were consistent with those of healthy adults in these age groups 
in the general population. The most common diagnoses by category were immune system disorders, 
surgical and medical procedures, nervous system disorders, eye disorders, and psychiatric disorders. The 
most common individual diagnoses were seasonal allergy, myopia, drug hypersensitivity, migraine, and 
depression. 
However, with regard to the percentages of subjects who reported AEs within approximately 1 month 
after vaccination, there were no differences between cohort 3 and the older cohorts, or within the age 
subgroups in cohort 3. The percentage of subjects reporting any AEs at the 6-month follow-up contact 
was slightly lower in cohort 3 (0.3%) than in cohort 2 (1.5%) and cohort 1 (2.9%). Most AEs were the 
types of diseases and conditions commonly observed among adults in these age groups. There were few 
related AEs, severe or life threatening AEs, or SAEs reported and the incidences were similar in cohort 3 
Prevenar 13 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 22/36 
 
 
 
compared with cohort 1 and cohort 2. There were no deaths or AEs that led to withdrawal from the study 
in cohort 3. 
These data demonstrate an acceptable safety profile for the administration of 13vPnC to subjects 18 to 49 
years old. 
Conclusions on clinical safety 
As noted above, there were increased proportions of subjects from cohort 3 which experienced both local 
and systemic reactions. Furthermore, the youngest age sub group of cohort 3 also experienced a higher 
proportion of local and systemic reactions.  However, the percentages of subjects reporting AEs (including 
SAEs) were not different between cohorts (or age groups) at 1 month after vaccination and, in fact, lower 
for cohort 3 at 6 months after vaccination. 
While the local and systemic reactions are well characterised and generally well tolerated manifestations 
of immunogenicity, these safety data must be assessed in the context that there are no specific 
recommendations to vaccinate healthy adults with pneumococcal vaccines, and the medical need is 
considered small. Rates of at least one local reaction of 97.3% and at least one systemic reaction of 96% 
could be considered unacceptable if there is no foreseen benefit of vaccination in this population.  In 
contrast, for adults belonging to risk groups for pneumococcal infection, the benefit of vaccination 
Prevenar 13 would outweigh these risks. Safety data in such populations will be provided as 
post-authorisation measures, as described in the pharmacovigilance activities. 
2.4.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which 
remains unchanged.  
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
• 
• 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency;  
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
If the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same time. 
2.5.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation 
Pharmacovigilance development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Summary table of Risk Minimisation Measures 
Safety Concern 
Proposed Risk Minimisation Activities (Routine and 
Additional) 
A. Important identified risks: Increased rate of fever when 
coadministered with Infanrix hexa. 
The SmPC revisions approved 22 November 2012 in procedure 
II/56 are as follows: 
Routine SmPC (Section 4.4) Special warnings and precautions for 
use 
When Prevenar 13 is administered concomitantly with Infanrix 
hexa (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib), the rates of febrile reactions are 
similar to those seen with concomitant administration of Prevenar 
(7-valent) and Infanrix hexa (see section 4.8). 
(Section 4.8) Undesirable effects 
In a clinical study in infants vaccinated at 2, 3, and 4 months of 
age, fever ≥ 38°C was reported at higher rates among infants who 
received Prevenar (7-valent) concomitantly with Infanrix hexa 
(28.3% to 42.3%) than in infants receiving Infanrix hexa alone 
(15.6% to 23.1%). 
After a booster dose at 12 to 15 months of age, the rate of fever ≥ 
38°C was 50.0% in infants who received Prevenar (7-valent) and 
Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 33.6% in infants 
receiving Infanrix hexa alone. These reactions were mostly 
moderate (less than or equal to 39 °C) and transient. 
B. Important potential risks: Unanticipated safety signals 
(including the onset of rare events) not seen in clinical trials of 
13vPnC. 
Vaccine failure in subjects who are fully immunized according to 
local recommendations. 
None 
Routine: SmPC (section 4.4) Special warnings and precautions 
As with any vaccine, Prevenar 13 may not protect all individuals 
receiving the vaccine from pneumococcal disease. 
C. AEs which were not associated with 13vPnC in clinical trials or 
with 7vPnC in post-authorisation observational safety studies, but 
are included in the Prevenar SmPC:

Routine: SmPC (section 4.4) Special warnings and precautions 
Individuals with impaired immune responsiveness, whether due 
to the use of immune-suppressive therapy, a genetic defect, 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or other causes, 
may have reduced antibody response to active immunization. 
Safety and immunogenicity data for Prevenar 13 are not available 
for individuals in specific immunocompromised groups (eg, 
congenital or acquired splenic dysfunction, HIV infected, 
malignancy, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, nephrotic 
syndrome) and vaccination should be considered on an individual 
basis. Limited data have demonstrated that Prevenar 7 valent 
(three dose primary series) induces an acceptable immune 
response in infants with sickle cell disease with a safety profile 
similar to that observed in non-high-risk groups (see section 5.1). 
SmPC (section 5.1) Pharmacodynamic properties. The 
immunogenicity of Prevenar has been investigated in an 
open-label, multicenter trial in 49 infants with sickle cell disease. 
Children were vaccinated with Prevenar (3 doses one month apart 
from the age of 2 months), and 46 of these children also received 
a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at the age of 
15-18 months. After primary immunization, 95.6% of the 
subjects had antibody levels of at least 0.35 μg/mL for all seven 
serotypes found in Prevenar. A significant increase was seen in 
the concentrations of antibodies against the seven serotypes after 
the polysaccharide vaccination, suggesting that immunological 
memory was well established. 
None

SmPC (section 4.2): Posology and method of administration - 
Prevenar 13 vaccine schedule for infants and children previously 
vaccinated with Prevenar (7-valent) (Streptococcus pneumoniae 
serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F). Prevenar 13 contains 
the same 7 serotypes included in Prevenar, using the same carrier 
protein CRM197. Infants and children who have begun 
immunisation with Prevenar may switch to Prevenar 13 at any 
point in the schedule. 
The MAH is informing the health care professionals about the 
differentiating characteristics of 13vPnC and 7vPnC, ie, difference 
in packaging, the product label and different color of syringe and 
tip cap and how to transition to 13vPnC for children who started a 
vaccination schedule with 7vPnC. 
In order to ensure that potential adverse event reports can be 
unambiguously linked to the type of vaccine administered, the 
MAH is ensuring that the two vaccines have different batch 
numbers, different color of the plunger and tip cap of the syringe, 
and different carton packaging and label.

direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive 
toxicity. 
It is unknown whether pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate is 
excreted in human milk. 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.6.  Update of the Product information   
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Changes were also made to the PI to 
bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
Section 4.1 
Therapeutic indications 
Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia and acute otitis media caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants, and children and adolescents from 6 weeks to 17 years of age. 
Active immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults 
≥ 18 years of age and the elderlyaged 50 years and older 
The use of Prevenar 13 should be determined on the basis of official recommendations taking into 
consideration the riskimpact of invasive disease in different age groups, underlying comorbidities as well 
as the variability of serotype epidemiology in different geographical areas

Posology and method of administration 
Children and adolescents aged 2 17 years  
Adults ≥ 18 years of age, and the elderly aged 50 years and older 
4.4 
Special warnings and precautions for use 
Prevenar 13 will only protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes included in the vaccine, and 
will not protect against other microorganisms that cause invasive disease, pneumonia, or otitis media. As 
with any vaccine, Prevenar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine from pneumococcal 
disease. For the most recent epidemiological information in your country you should consult with the 
relevant national organisation.

Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine in pregnant women. 
Therefore the use of Prevenar 13 should be avoided during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine is excreted in human milk.

Undesirable effects 
A typographical error has been corrected for the definition for “very rare”.  It has been corrected to state

Adults ≥ 18 years and the elderly aged 50 years and older 
Safety was assessed in 6 clinical studies including 7,0976,198 adults ranging in age from 1850 to 95 years. 
Prevenar 13 was administered to 5,667 adults; 2,616 (46.2 %) aged 50 to 64 years, and 3,051 (53.8 %) 
aged 65 years and older. Of the Prevenar 13 recipients 1,916 adults were previously vaccinated with the 
23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at least 3 years prior to study vaccination, and 3,751 
were 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine unvaccinated. One of the six studies included a 
group of adults (n=899) ranging from 18 to 49 years who received Prevenar 13 and who were not 
previously vaccinated with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.  
Subjects older than 65 years of age reported fewer adverse reactions than younger adults, regardless of 
prior pneumococcal vaccination status.A trend to lower frequency of adverse reactions was associated 
with greater age; adults >65 years of age (regardless of prior pneumococcal vaccination status) reported 
fewer adverse reactions than younger adults, with adverse reactions generally most common in the 
youngest adults, 18 to 29 years of age. 
Overall, the frequency categories were similar for all both age groups, with the exception of vomiting 
which was very common (≥ 1/10) in adults aged 18 to 49 years and common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) in all 
other age groups, and pyrexia was very common in adults aged 18 to 29 years and common in all other 
age groups. Severe vaccination-site pain/tenderness and severe limitation of arm movement was very 
common in adults 18 to 39 years and common in all other age groups.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

Burden of disease in adults ≥ 18 years and the elderly aged 50 years and older  
The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults increases with age from 50 years, risk 
factors (smoking status or alcohol use), and underlying co-morbidities (chronic cardiovascular disease, 
chronic pulmonary disease including asthma, renal disorders, diabetes mellitus, and chronic liver disease 
including alcoholic liver disease). Bacteraemic pneumonia, bacteraemia without a focus, and meningitis 
are the most common manifestations of IPD in adults aged 50 years or older. Based on surveillance data, 
the pneumococcal serotypes in Prevenar 13 may be responsible for at least 50 – 76% (depending on 
country) of IPD in adults aged over 50 years. Approximately 80% of IPD in adults is bacteraemic 
pneumonia. 
Adults with underlying comorbidities are at an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). 
Additionally the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults increases with age from 50 
years. Based on surveillance data following the introduction of Prevenar but before the introduction of 
Prevenar 13 in childhood vaccination programmes, the pneumococcal serotypes in Prevenar 13 may be 
responsible for at least 50 – 76% (depending on country) of IPD in adults aged over 50 years. 
Bacteraemic pneumonia, bacteraemia without a focus, and meningitis are the most common 
manifestations of IPD in adults with approximately 80% of IPD in adults is bacteraemic pneumonia.   
Prevenar 13 immunogenicity clinical studies in infants, and children and adolescents 
Section 5.1  
Immunogenicity studies in adults ≥ 18 years and the elderly 50 years and older 
Five clinical studies were conducted in Europe and the USA evaluating the immunogenicity of Prevenar 13 
in different age groups ranging from 1850-95 years of age. Clinical studies with Prevenar 13 currently 
provide immunogenicity data in adults aged 1850 years and older, including adults aged 65 and older 
previously vaccinated with one or more doses of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, 5 years 
prior to enrollment. Each study included healthy adults and immuno-competent adults with stable 
underlying conditions known to predispose individuals to pneumococcal infection (i.e., chronic 
cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease including asthma, renal disorders and diabetes 
mellitus, chronic liver disease including alcoholic liver disease), and adults with risk factors such as 
smoking and alcohol abuse. 
Immunogenicity and safety of Prevenar 13 has been demonstrated in adults aged 1850 years and older 
including those previously vaccinated with a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 
Adults not previously vaccinated with 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
In a head-to-head, comparative trial conducted in adults aged 60-64 years, subjects received a single 
dose of either Prevenar 13 or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. In the same study another 
group of adults aged 50-59 years and another group of adults aged 18-49 years received a single dose of 
Prevenar 13. 
Table 4 compares the OPA GMTs, 1-month post-dose, in 60-64 year olds given either a single dose of 
Prevenar 13 or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, and in 50-59 year olds given a single 
dose of Prevenar 13. 
Table 5 shows OPA GMTs 1-month after a single dose of Prevenar 13 in 18-49 year olds compared to 
60-64 year olds.

1. 
• 
What Prevenar 13 is and what it is used for 
adults aged 1850 years and older to help prevent disease such as: bacteraemic pneumonia (lung 
infection with bacteria in the blood stream), bacteraemia (bacteria in the blood stream) and meningitis 
(inflammation around the brain), 
caused by 13 types of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae.

the safety of this medicine. 
3.  Benefit Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The immune responses following vaccination with Prevenar 13 in healthy adults are very likely to be 
protective, as both OPA titres and ELISA GMCs were high. This is also expected considering that the 
immune responses in younger children and elderly have already been demonstrated to be protective

(younger children), or at least non-inferior to the responses to a 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine 
(elderly). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Overall the expected benefit of vaccination of healthy adults 18-49 years is considered limited as the 
incidence of disease is low in this age group.  
A similar discussion was held regarding the extension of indication to include children 6-17 years of age 
in type II variation 55. The benefit of vaccination of healthy children 6-17 years of age is also very limited, 
but by extending the indication to that age group enables the use of Prevenar 13 in risk groups also in this 
age group, although there is currently limited data on the use Prevenar 13 in risk groups. Since then, a 
type II variation (II76) was submitted, and inclusion of data from three different studies in risk groups 
was proposed by the MAH, i.e. premature children, children with sickle cell disease and HIV positive 
adults. The procedure is still ongoing, but it is clear that at least some data in risk groups are available. 
Therefore, the current variation allows the use of Prevenar 13 in risk groups 18-49 years where the 
benefit of vaccination is greater compared to healthy adults. The indication section should include the 
consideration of the risk of invasive disease in different age groups.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Rates of local and systemic reactions are higher in the age group 18-49 years compared to those older 
adults for which Prevenar 13 is currently indicated.  Rates of at least one local reaction are 97.3% and at 
least one systemic reaction of 96% in this age group. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
These local and systemic reactions are well characterised and generally well tolerated manifestations of 
immunogenicity; however, there are no safety data provided for risk groups for which Prevenar 13 might 
be indicated in this age group.  Additional safety data in the risk groups may be obtained in the 
aforementioned 2 studies included in the pharmacovigilance plan as well as from routine 
pharmacovigilance for pregnant women. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The benefit of pneumococcal vaccination in healthy adults is considered limited, as the incidence of 
disease is low in this age group. The benefit is greater in risk groups, although the data provided in this 
application is limited to generally healthy adults. However, at least some data in risk groups are now 
available as seen in the ongoing type II variation 76. It is reasonable to extrapolate immunogenicity data 
and safety data between age groups e.g. younger (6-17 years) and older (>50 years) where Prevenar 13 
is already approved.  
The local and systemic reactions are well characterised and generally well tolerated manifestations of 
immunogenicity. Rates of at least one local reaction of 97.3% and at least one systemic reaction of 96%

could be considered unacceptable if there is no foreseen benefit of vaccination in this population.  In 
contrast, for adults belonging to risk groups for pneumococcal infection, the benefit of vaccination 
Prevenar 13 would outweigh these risks. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefit of vaccinating healthy adults 18-49 years of age with Prevenar 13 is considered limited, but 
the benefit of vaccinating adults belonging to risk groups with Prevenar 13 is considered greater. It is 
considered reasonable to extrapolate immunogenicity and safety data from younger and older age 
groups, where Prevenar 13 is already approved. The high incidence of adverse events was high, but the 
events were generally transient and mild to moderate. Thus, the benefit of vaccination subjects 18-49 
years of age, taking risk factors of disease into account outweighs the risks. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The current variation is in principle similar to the recently assessed type II variation 55, which was an 
extension to include children 6-18 years of age. In that variation the benefit of vaccinating healthy 
children >5 years was considered limited, but the benefit of vaccinating risk group children was assumed 
to be much greater. The MAH justified the use of Prevenar in risk group children 6-18 years of age based 
on literature and company sponsored studies using mostly Prevenar. As discussed above, it is reasonable 
to extrapolate the use in younger and older age groups to the age group 18-49 years, and additional data 
have become available in another ongoing type II variation, and therefore the benefit is considered 
demonstrated, although specific data on risk groups were not submitted in the current variation. 
4.  Recommendations 
 The application for extension of the indication to include adults aged from 18 to 49 years is approvable 
as major objections and other concerns have all been resolved.

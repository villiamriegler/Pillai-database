1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant CO.DON AG submitted on 3 December 2012 an application for marketing authorisation to the 
European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Spherox,  through  the  centralised  procedure  falling  within  the  Article 
3(1)  and  point  1  of  Annex  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004.  The  eligibility  to  the  centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 19 April 2012. 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  
Treatment  of  isolated  acute  or  chronic  chondral  or  osteochondral  articular  cartilage  defects  of  traumatic 
genesis or unknown etiology (e.g. Osteochondritis dissecans). Spherox is applicable for defect sizes up to 10 
cm² (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III or IV). Treatment is eligible for single as well as 
multiple  adjacent  defects.  The  medicinal  product  is  indicated  for  adults  and  adolescents  with  closed 
epiphyseal growth plate. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article  8.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  -  complete  and  independent  application.  The  applicant  indicated  that 
spheroids  of  human  autologous  matrix-associated  chondrocytes  was  considered  to  be  a  new  active 
substance. 
The  application  is  composed  of  administrative  information,  complete  quality  data,  non-clinical  and  clinical 
data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain 
tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  7  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision 
P/0253/2012 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0253/2012 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  141/2000  and  Article  3  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 
847/2000,  the  applicant  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with  authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication.

New active Substance status 
The  applicant  requested  the  active  substance,  spheroids  of  human  autologous  matrix-associated 
chondrocytes, contained in the above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the 
applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Articular  cartilage  is  a  complex  structure  that  has  an  important  function  in  load-bearing  joints  and  joint 
mobility.  These  characteristics  are  determined  mainly  on  the  composition  of  cartilage  and  particularly  its 
extracellular  matrix  whose  production  the  chondrocytes  are  involved  in.  The  integrity  of  the  extracellular 
matrix  is  essential  for  the  mechanical  and  structural  capacity  of  the  cartilage.  Due  to  the  lack  of  blood  or 
lymphatic vessels in the cartilage, cell infiltration does not occur and the capacity of the defect to heal after 
trauma  is  reduced.  Without  a  surgical  intervention  the  risk  for  the  development  of  arthrosis  is  present.  A 
cartilage lesion can reduce the joint function, cause pain and swelling of the joint.  
Current  methods  to  treat  cartilage  defects  include  autologous  chondrocyte  implantation  (ACI),  marrow 
stimulation techniques (e.g. microfracture) and mosaicplasty. Small lesions, especially in young patients, are 
known  to  heal  without  treatment.  On  the  other  hand,  for  large  lesions  there  are  only  limited  treatment 
options still available, as the surgical treatments are not suitable for such purpose.  
On the 30th December 2008, Regulation 1394/2007/EC for advanced therapies came into force. The product 
Spherox  and  all  other  chondrocyte  products  on  the  market  fall  within  the  definition  of  a  tissue-engineered 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 12/125 
 
  
  
product  as  defined  in  Article  2(1)(b)  of  Regulation  1394/2007/EC  and  therewith  became  subject  to  the 
centralised authorisation procedure. 
For  the  initial  MAA  filed  for  Spherox  on  20  December  2012,  the  indication  for  Spherox  as  proposed  by  the 
applicant was as follows: 
“Treatment  of  isolated  acute  or  chronic  chondral  or  osteochondral  articular  cartilage  defects  of  traumatic 
genesis or unknown etiology (e.g. Osteochondritis dissecans). Spherox is applicable for defect sizes up to 10 
cm² (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III or IV). Treatment is eligible for single as well as 
multiple  adjacent  defects.  The  medicinal  product  is  indicated  for  adults  and  adolescents  with  closed 
epiphyseal growth plate.” 
Following review of the response to the list of questions and list of outstanding issues during the procedure, 
the proposed indication has been revised as follows: 
“Repair  of  symptomatic  articular  cartilage  defects  of  the  femoral  condyle  and  the  patella  of  the  knee 
(International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III or IV) with defect sizes up to 10 cm2 in adults.” 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Three  factors  are  used  to assess  the  initial  cartilage  lesion  of  the  knee:  the  patient's  clinical  status  and  the 
lesion's  size  and  type.  The  indication  for  management  is based on  the  deterioration  of  the  functional  status 
measured  by  pain  and  functional  limitation;  these  criteria  are  validated  by  a  number  of  clinical  scores.  The 
lesion size can be measured in different ways. The standard radiological work-up can be used to estimate the 
width  on  the  AP  view  of  the  knee  and  the  length  on  the  lateral  knee  image.  However,  the  CT  arthrogram, 
MRI,  and  arthro-MRI  provide  a  more  precise  appreciation  of  the  width  on  AP  slices  and  length  on  sagittal 
slices; this measurement makes it possible to calculate the surfaces. Arthroscopy directly measures the size 
of the lesion using a probe, cylindrical gauges, or the measurement of the lesion arc. Directly visualizing the 
lesion, arthroscopy can also appreciate the depth of the lesion using the ICRS grades: 
•  Grade 1: nearly normal (superficial lesions): softening, fibrillations, lacerations, fissures; 
•  Grade 2: abnormal (less than 50% of cartilage depth); 
•  Grade 3: severely abnormal (cartilage defects extending down to more than 50% of cartilage depth); 
•  Grade 4: severely abnormal (lesion extending past subchondral plate, bone exposed) 
Articular  cartilage  injuries  affect  around  285,600  people  in  Germany  (number  of  arthroscopic  operations  of 
cartilage defects and meniscal operations from 2008; Deutsches Statistisches Bundesamt) and are therefore 
a common orthopaedic problem. Consequences of cartilage defects are reduced function of the joint and pain. 
Traumatically  caused  chondral  lesions  are  accepted  as  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  osteoarthritis,  which  is 
one  of  the  major  disabling  disorders  and  affects  more  than  10%  of  the  Western  population.  This  applies  to 
cartilage defects in the knee as well as in other joints, e.g. the hip. 
2.1.1.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Articular  cartilage  damage  can  occur  to  the  articular  cartilage  on  its  own  as  an  isolated  condition,  or  in 
conjunction with other injuries. Anterior cruciate ligament injuries of the knee are commonly associated with 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 13/125 
 
  
  
damage to the medial or inner and lateral or outer surfaces of the femur and tibia. In the instance of an ACL 
tear  during  a  twisting  movement  of  the  knee,  the  articulating  surfaces  of  the  femur  and  tibia  become 
damaged. Symptoms include recurrent pain and swelling in the joint. There may be locking of the knee due 
to loose  bodies  floating  within  the  joint.  The  patient  may  also experience  audible  clunks  and  clicking  noises 
when moving the knee. 
2.1.2.  Management 
The  therapeutic  tools  aim  to  fill  the  cartilage  loss  so  as  to  restore  joint  congruence,  if  possible  to  induce 
hyaline  healing  and  thus  prevent  long-term  osteoarthritic  degeneration.  The  currently  available  surgical 
options  for  the  treatment  of  cartilage  defects  can  be  divided  into  transplant  procedures  and  bone  marrow 
stimulation  techniques.  While  autologous  chondrocyte  implantation  and  osteochondral  transplantation  (OCT, 
OATS, mosaicplasty) represent the group of transplant procedures; microfracture, abrasion arthroplasty and 
drilling procedures are among the techniques used for bone marrow stimulation. On the basis of the available 
literature,  arthroscopic  microfracture  (MF)  is  the  procedure  with  the  best  evidence  within  the  bone  marrow 
stimulation  techniques.  However,  factors  associated  with  an  unfavourable  prognosis  include  a  large  size  of 
the  defect  and  age  over  40 years.  ACT  is  an  established  procedure  for  the  treatment  of  localized  full-
thickness cartilage defects of the knee. According to the German Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology 
(DGOU), ACI is indicated for symptomatic cartilage defects starting from defect sizes of more than 3-4 cm2; 
in the case of young patients or those active in sports at 2.5 cm2. Advanced degenerative joint disease is the 
most  important  contraindication.  For  the  hip,  numerous  joint-preserving  treatments  exist  for  chondral  and 
osteochondral lesions, mirroring the treatment options in the knee. These include total hip arthroplasty, MF, 
articular  cartilage  repair,  ACT,  mosaicplasty,  and  osteochondral  allograft  transplantation.  There  is  limited 
clinical information on the use of ACT in the hip. 
About the product 
Spherox is an advanced therapy medicinal product, composed of spheroids, which are spherical aggregates of 
ex vivo expanded chondrocytes with self-synthesized extracellular matrix. The drug product can be described 
as  application  unit  containing  individual  number  of  spheroids  in  physiological  saline  solution.  The  active 
compound of Spherox consists of spheroids of human autologous matrix-associated chondrocytes, dispensed 
in a 0.9% NaCl solution. The product is used to treat and repair cartilage defects in the knee. It is applied in 
a re-transplantation procedure using a 3-dimensional autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT3D) in the 
donor’s cartilage defect. The number of spheroids to be implanted is calculated individually by the physician 
depending  on  the  estimated  defect  size  (10-70  spheroids/cm2)  at  the  time  of  biopsy  procurement.  The 
implants  are  delivered  either  in  a  syringe  or  an  application  system,  so  called  co.fix  with  a  stem  length  150 
mm  containing  60  spheroids.  The  drug  substance  is  prepared  by  isolation  of  autologous  chondrocytes  from 
patient’s  cartilage  biopsy  and  the  expansion  of  cells  in  a  monolayer  culture.  After  the  expansion  step, 
chondrocytes are transferred to coated culture plates, where they cannot adhere to the surface, but start to 
form  cell  aggregates,  spheroids.  For  harvesting,  the  spheroids  are  washed  and  transferred  into  0.9%  NaCl 
solution.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  implantation  suspension  equivalent  containing  10-70  spheroids/cm2 
spheroids of human autologous matrix-associated chondrocytes as active substance. 
Another ingredient is Sodium chloride. 
The product is available in a pre-filled syringe or in an applicator (co.fix 150) as primary packaging unit. 
The applicator (stem length 150 mm (co.fix 150)) is packed in a sterile tube and additionally surrounded by 
an  extra  bag.  A  tube  may  contain  a  maximum  of  two  co.fix  150.  The  catheter  of  the  applicator  is  made  of 
thermoplastic  polyurethane,  the  sealing  plug  on  one  side  of  acrylonitrile  butadiene  styrene  and  a  silicone 
stopper on the other side. The applicator is delivered with an application device (sterile injection syringe).  
The pre-filled syringe consists of a luer lock, a sealing ring and a cover cap. It is packed in a sterile tube with 
a screw-type cap and additionally surrounded by an extra bag. All parts of the pre-filled syringe are made of 
polypropylene, the sealing ring of isoprene. Silicone oil serves as lubricant. The pre-filled syringe is delivered 
with an application device (indwelling cannula or filter stem).  
The number of primary packaging units delivered depends on the type of the primary packaging unit and the 
number  of  spheroids  necessary  for  the  specific  defect  size  (10-70  spheroids/cm²).  One  applicator  has  a 
maximum capacity of 60 spheroids in a volume of up to 200 microlitre isotonic sodium chloride solution. One 
pre-filled  syringe  has  a  maximum  capacity  of  100  spheroids  in  a  volume  of  up  to  1000  microlitre  isotonic 
sodium chloride solution. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
Spherox is a 3-dimensional autologous chondrocyte product that consists of matrix-associated chondrocytes 
in a form of a spheroid.  
A  spheroid  is  an  aggregate  of  articular  cartilage  cells  that  have  formed  and  differentiated  into  a  3-
dimensional  round  multicellular  structure.  The  cells  within  the  spheroids  display  mainly  a  round  cell  shape 
and are surrounded by a self-synthesised extracellular matrix (ECM). In contrast, the cells present at the rim 
of the spheroids have an elongated shape (see Figure 1).

The  cell  nuclei  are  stained  blue  and  the  cytoplasm  and  matrix  pink.  A  scale  bar  is  indicated  in  the  panel.  (B)  Schematic 
representation of a section of a spheroid illustrating the histological features of a spheroid. Note the elongated cells at the 
rim of the spheroid, and the round cells in the interior of the spheroid, surrounded by deposited ECM (Spherox after two 
weeks cultivation; refer to non-clinical study report no. cod 16/60, Module 4.2.1.2.1. The size of the spheroid depicted in the 
figure is approximately 500 µm).  
The formation of the spheroids coincides with the synthesis and deposition of an ECM by chondrocytes. This 
results in an encapsulation of the chondrocytes within this self-synthesized ECM. The ECM in spheroids has a 
hyaline-like character and the ECM components CEP-68, aggrecan, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), collagen type 
II  as  well  as  the  early  ECM  protein  collagen  type  I  are  present  in  spheroids.  This  indicates  a  chondrogenic 
phenotype  of  chondrocytes  within  spheroids  and  their  potential  to  synthesise  and  deposit  cartilage  specific 
ECM components.  
Safranin O positive staining affirmed the presence of hyaline cartilage specific GAGs. Collagen type I, which is 
an  early,  structurally  important  protein,  was  shown  to  be  produced  especially  near  the  surface  of  the 
spheroids.  Moreover,  spheroids  also  express  different  chondrogenic  growth  factors,  including  TGFbeta, 
BMP2/4, IGF-1, and PDGF.  
The  observed  protein  expression  underlines  that  the  Spherox  system  is  generating  cells  that  are  able  to 
support  and  to  promote  the  function  necessary  to  foster  growth  of  hyaline-like  cartilage  and  subsequent 
healing of a cartilage defect. 
The  size  of  the  spheroids  varies  depending  on  the  cultivation  time  of  the  spheroids.  With  prolonged 
cultivation time, the size of the spheroids does not appear to change any further. 
The  structural  and  functional  integration  of  transplants  into  defects  is  essential  for  their  long-term 
functionality.  The  spheroid’s  adhesion  and  subsequent  remodelling  are  crucial  steps  in  its  structural  and 
functional  integration  into  native  cartilage.  This  adhesion  and  integration  process  of  in  vitro  formed 
autologous  spheroids  consist  of  three  phases:  (i)  initial  fixation  of  spheroids  by  cell  mediated  adhesion  to 
host  tissue;  (ii)  widening  of  the  spheroids  and  integration  into  the  adhesion  area  by  migration  of  surface 
chondrocytes  along  the  irregular  surface  (e.g.  fissures)  of  the  host  tissue,  resulting  in  spheroid  remodelling

(iii),  synthesis  and  secretion  of  cartilage-specific  proteins  into  the  defect  cavity  that  have  structural  and 
regulating  function.  This  final  step  leads  to  gap  filling  between  single  spheroids  and  host  tissue,  as  well  as 
their biochemical integration into the surrounding host tissue (see Figure 2).

Schematic  representation  of  the  adhesion  (i)  of  a  cartilage  cell  spheroid  to  the  defect  ground  through  adhesion  points 
(indicated by the red lines). This is followed by (ii) widening of the spheroids and its integration into the adhesion area by 
migration  of  surface  chondrocytes  along  the  irregular  surface  of  the  defect  ground.  In  the  last  remodelling  step  (iii)  the 
spheroid is completely integrated into the cartilage defect. Red arrows indicate synthesis and secretion of cartilage-specific 
proteins  into  the  defect  cavity  with  structural  and  regulating  function.  Red  circles  indicate  a  putative  cell  proliferation, 
which leads to a formation of new chondrocytes within the defect. 
Manufacture, process control and characterisation 
The  manufacturing  process  of  Spherox  is  a  continuous  process  including  blood  and  biopsy  procurement 
manufacture of the active substance and formulation of the finished product and no holding step or storage 
of  the  active  substance  occurs.  The  manufacture  of  Spherox  active  substance  and  finished  product  takes 
place at CO.DON. AG, Warthestr. 21, 14513 Teltow, Germany under GMP conditions. 
Chondrocytes are isolated from a cartilage biopsy taken from the patient’s own healthy cartilage area of the 
respective  joint.  The  donation  and  procurement  of  the  biopsy  material  is  performed  in  compliance  with  the 
Directives 2004/23/EC and 2006/17/EC.  
Transportation  of  the  biopsy  occurs  within  48  hours  at  5  °C  to  25  °C  inside  the  transport  box  to  the 
production facility. This step has been shown to have an impact on the process and the product and thus the 
applicant has demonstrated the suitability of the transport conditions.  
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  the  following  steps:  starting  material  is  acquired  from  a  cartilage 
biopsy of the patient’s healthy cartilage area, autologous serum is separated for further production, cells are 
isolated  from  the  biopsy  and  expanded  in  monolayer  cell  culture,  cells  are  then  cultured  on  coated  wells  to 
form three dimensional spheroids. The obtained spheroids are harvested, formulated in saline and packaged.  
The process flow is clearly described in the dossier and the main steps are standardized.  
Production of the spheroids is based on coated culture plates, where the cells cannot adhere to the surface, 
but result in large chondrocyte aggregates, spheroids. The optimal size of the spheroids has been defined 
based on the requirements during the surgical application. The number of cells per spheroid varies however 
the applicant has been able to address this issue by presenting data in support of the limits set.  
No reprocessing steps are proposed for manufacture of the spheroids.

The manufacturing process of Spherox is a continuous process starting from blood and biopsy procurement to 
active substance and to finished product formulation and no holding step or storage of the active substance 
occurs therefore no primary packaging of the active substance is described.  
Control of materials 
All  raw  materials  are  of  adequate  quality  and  suitability  for  the  intended  use.  Donor  testing  is  conducted 
according  to  Dir.  2004/23/EC  and  all  test  kits  used  for  this  purpose  are  CE  certified.  The  quality  of  the 
biopsies  and  patient  blood  (serum)  has  been  assessed  and  there  are  in-process  tests  /  controls  in  place  to 
ensure  adequate  quality  of  the  materials  before  production.  The  laboratory  where  the  biopsy  is  taken  has 
been confirmed to be approved and inspected by the responsible Competent Authority.  
The  applicant  has  paid  particular  attention  to  the  starting  materials  and  has  excluded  any  animal  derived 
materials  and  external  growth  supplements.  The  main  starting  material  is  comprised  of  the  patient´s  own 
chondrocytes,  isolated  from  a  cartilage  biopsy.  The  cells  are  propagated  in  cell  culture  media  that  contain 
only the patient´s own serum as a growth supporting agent.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A  comprehensive  overview  of  critical  in-process  controls  and  critical  in-process  tests  performed  throughout 
manufacture of Spherox has been provided. Acceptable information has been provided on the control system 
in place to monitor and control the active substance and finished product manufacturing process.  
Previously,  major  issues  were  raised  in  relation  to  the  validation  of  the  manufacturing  process  as  regards 
characterization  of  operational  parameters  and  overall  robustness  of  the  process.  Furthermore  issues  were 
raised  regarding  the  suitability  of  in-process  control  (IPC)  to  maintain  the  differentiation  potential  during 
monolayer  culture  and  the  genotypic/phenotypic  profile  of  chondrocytes  during  spheroid  cultivation  and  the 
overall design of the manufacturing process was questioned. 
During the procedure the applicant has included new tests for identity to be applied during monolayer as well 
as  spheroid  stages.  Two  identity  tests  for  chondrocytes  introduced  were  as  follows:  one  IPC  at  the  end  of 
monolayer  cultivation  and  one  as  a  release  test  for  the  finished  product.  These  tests  are  based  on 
quantitative  polymerase  chain  reaction  (qPCR)  analysis  of  the  marker  gene  expression  and  followed  the 
approach to set acceptance criteria according to the ICH guidelines Q6B.  
The  applicant  was  able  to  demonstrate  improved  control  during  monolayer  culture  and  spheroid  cultivation. 
The provided validation data include IPCs and release parameters for 30 batches used for implantation which 
also include data from new tests (identity, potency and impurity). Consistency of the manufacturing process 
has  been  demonstrated  by  comparing  process  validation  data  with  data  from  Phase  II/  III  clinical  trials.  No 
efficacy  data  could  be  presented  for  these  batches;  however  a  comparison  of  ranges  of  operational  control 
(e.g.  cell  culture  medium  change,  splitting  conditions  etc.)  has  been  performed.  In  addition,  quality 
parameter  like  cellular impurity  by  synoviocytes  and  cellularity  of the  finished  product  have  been  compared 
Obtained data demonstrate that the new tests applied are adequate to maintain the differentiation potential 
in the monolayer as well as the genetic/phenotypic stability, including culture of spheroids. Based on clinical 
trial  data,  operational  ranges  for  ML  cultivation  time  (P0  and  total  ML  cultivation  time)  as  well  as  spheroid 
cultivation  time  and  total  cultivation  time  (ML+3D)  have  been  adjusted/tightened  such  that  the  efficacy  of 
Spherox was not negatively affected by the parameter.  
The  IPCs  applied  are  considered  adequate  for  the  purpose  of  maintaining  the  differentiation  potential  in 
monolayer  culture  whilst  also  maintaining  the  genetic/phenotypic  stability,  including  culture  of  spheroids.  A 
CHMP assessment report

marker  for  selection  of  the  potential  cellular  impurity  (synoviocytes)  has  also  been  implemented  and  the 
chosen  marker  has  been  found  acceptable.  The  applicant  has  also  adjusted  the  specifications  in  line  with 
batch data and set a limit for synoviocytes. 
Data provided suggests that markers representative for chondrogenic potential, potency and impurities (e.g. 
synoviocytes)  do  not  vary  significantly  from  time  of  testing  at  day  14  up  to  the  maximal  allowed  6  week 
cultivation  time.  Furthermore,  analysis  of  clinical  data  does  not  suggest  any  influence  from  cultivation  time 
when comparing responder vs non–responder after ranges and limits have been adjusted.  
To  confirm  the  new  and  adjusted  process  ranges  and  limits,  the  applicant  is  requested  in  an  Annex  II 
condition  to  conduct  a  new,  prospective  process  validation  as  a  post  manufacturing  measure  using  batches 
manufactured  under  the  revised  and  more  tightly  controlled  process  parameters.  The  applicant  is  also 
requested  to  review  the  results  from  batches  manufactured  with  the  newly  defined  process  parameters  (as 
will be validated in a prospective process validation). Based on these results, more tightly defined operational 
ranges and limits in the manufacturing process will be considered. The timeline for fulfilling this condition is 
by April 2019. 
Process validation  
As  regards  consistency  in  manufacturing,  the  presented  data  from  batches  produced  deviate  from  set 
parameters  of  cultivation  time  (P0),  cellular  impurity  and  cellularity  (cells  per  spheroid).  Indeed  such 
deviations  during  process  validations  would  normally  not  be  accepted.  However,  this  is  not  a  traditional 
development  and  no  dedicated  process  validation  programme  has  been  performed.  Rather  process  data 
consists  of  a  collection  of  data  from  batches  produced  in  the  past,  which  can  be  considered  to  be  clinically 
justified.  
Therefore,  the  CAT/CHMP  has  requested  the  Applicant  to  conduct  a  prospective  process  validation  post-
marketing using batches manufactured with the agreed and well-controlled process as detailed above.  
Manufacturing process development 
In  1994,  Peterson  and  Brittberg  (Brittberg  et  al,  1994)  published one  of  the  first  instructions  for  successful 
cell-cultivation  of  chondrocytes  in  the  New  England  Journal.  In  the  following  year,  CO.DON  AG  began  to 
cultivate  chondrocytes  as  described  by  Peterson  and  Brittberg.  Subsequently,  CO.DON  AG  developed  the 
method further by using other combinations of media without growth factors and additives. In 1997, CO.DON 
AG  obtained  the  permission  for  manufacturing  cell  products  by the  federal competent  authority in  Germany 
and started to manufacture autologous cell transplants of high quality standard at that time. Cell cultivation 
was  performed  with  patients’  own  material  (cells  and  blood)  using  a  standard  laminar  air  flow  box  and 
standard  methods  for  cultivation.  Since  June  2000  CO.DON  AG  produces  the  transplants  in  a  so  called 
Integrated Isolator Technology (IIT). 
From 1997 until January 2009, more than 1,200 patients were treated with co.don chondrotransplant. Co.don 
chondrotransplant has been applied as cell suspension first using a periosteal flap to close the defect and to 
keep  cells  in  place.  The  goal  of  CO.DON  AG  was  to  develop  a  self-adhesive  transplant  product,  i.e.  without 
the  need  of  suturing  a  periosteal  flap.  In  2004,  the  product  Spherox  was  introduced  into  the  market,  an 
evolution  of  the  first  product  co.don  chondrotransplant.  The  cells  are  cultivated  in  a  3-dimensional 
environment  and  produce  own  extra-cellular  matrix  which  results  in  the  spheroid  form.  From  2004  till 
September 2012, more than 3,600 patients have been treated with Spherox.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017

The product has undergone substantial changes since 1997, therefore early version of the product have not 
been taken into consideration for the assessment as they are considered unrelated. Only changes after 2004 
are considered related and relevant for this application. 
Since  2004,  the  active  substance  manufacturing  process  has  been  changed  to  introduce  several  changes 
including introduction of protease/collagenase enzyme solution for dissolution of a spheroid to count the cell 
number  within  spheroids,  adjustment  of  the  seeding  range  of  monolayer-cultivated  cells  on  well  plates, 
removal of trypsin for enzyme digestion of the biopsy, monolayer and spheroid culture times, changes in in-
process parameters and evaluation including in process monitoring, in process tests and in process controls.  
In  addition,  changes 
to 
the  serological 
testing  of 
the  patient’s  blood  were  also 
introduced                                                                                                                                                              
in order to bring the test panel in line with serological testing in accordance with 2004/23/EC.  
Changes  to  the  quality  control  methods  introduced  were  made  for  sterility  testing,  control  of  bacterial 
endotoxins test of coated material used for the spheroid culture, analysis of chondrogenic marker expression 
for testing of identity and potency, mycoplasma testing and regular bacterial endotoxin testing.  
In relation to comparability between the proposed commercial process and earlier versions of the product a 
major  objection  was  raised  during  the  procedure.  During  the  procedure  the  applicant  was  able  to  resolve 
these concerns by performing a retrospective comparative analysis of batches including the updated tests for 
impurities, identity and potency. In the context of the comparability exercise data presented showed that the 
process  validation  lots  are  comparable  with  lots  from  Phase  II  and  Phase  III  trials.  Deviations  were  found 
when these lots were compared with lots routinely manufactured under the hospital exemption (2013-2015), 
however this was considered acceptable. The commercial process is built on the process validation from 2015 
and 2016 which was found to correlate with data from lots used in the Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. 
As mentioned above process validation will be confirmed post-marketing using batches from a well-controlled 
process using material from clinical trials. 
Characterisation 
For characterisation of the spheroids the applicant provided data from non-clinical studies. The applicant has 
further  presented  non-clinical  studies  in  support of  the  newly  introduced  identity  and  potency  markers.  The 
chosen markers are deemed acceptable, yet there remains a request to reconsider the proposed specification 
limits once the process is revalidated. 
The main focus in the product characterisation studies has been to provide evidence for non-clinical proof of 
concept  and  the  studies  performed  are  concentrated  on  Spherox  in  vitro/in  vivo  functionality,  aggregation, 
integration and remodelling. Basic quality characterization studies have not been conducted, although some 
information can be extracted from the non-clinical studies.  
The  optimal  culture  period  for  the  spheroids  to  achieve  optimal  size  is  claimed  to  be  less  than  2  weeks. 
Results  from  spheroid  characterisation,  however,  show  constant  expression  of  ColI,  whereas  chondrogenic 
markers ColII, Aggrecan and S100 are upregulated only after longer 3D culture periods. Only cells that were 
derived directly from monolayer culture at P0 showed expression of cartilage markers after 3 weeks.  
The applicant has demonstrated aggregation, integration and remodelling capacity of the spheroids in vitro, 
shown 
in  cells  and  spheroids  cultured 
for  14  days.  Spheroids  have  been  also  subjected  to 
immunohistochemical analysis, which demonstrated high expression of cartilage proteins, when the spheroids 
were co-cultured with human cartilage explants. These results suggest that the chondrocytes in the spheroids 
studied  are  able  to  form  good  quality  hyaline  cartilage,  when  the  2D  and  3D  culture  times  are  properly 
controlled.  Furthermore,  it  seems  that  the  cells  in  the  spheroids  after  controlled  culture  are  able  to  re-
CHMP assessment report

differentiate  in  an  appropriate  environment.  For  spheroid  size,  efficacy  is  demonstrated  in  the  clinical  trial 
batches for spheroids with a diameter between 200 and 850 µm. This is found acceptable. 
Impurities: 
In general, the data are supportive of the fact that IPCs applied are adequate for the purpose of maintaining 
the differentiation potential in ML whilst also maintaining the genetic/phenotypic stability, including culture of 
spheroids. These studies also highlight the need for consistent control of maximal PDL in the ML stage. 
A  marker  for  selection  of  the  potential  cellular  impurity  (synoviocytes)  has  also  been  implemented  and  the 
chosen  marker  has  been  found  acceptable.  The  applicant  has  now  adjusted  the  specifications  in  line  with 
batch data and set the requested limit for synoviocytes (see above). 
Reference standards 
No  reference  material  is  available  for  the  active  substance  or  finished  product.  However,  several  reference 
materials  are  used  in  the  analytical  methods.  These  have  been  adequately  described  and  are  considered 
acceptable for their intended use. 
Specification 
The manufacturing process of Spherox is a continuous process; there is no intermediate holding step for the 
active substance and therefore no specification is provided for the active substance. The information for the 
finished product release and shelf life specifications as well as analytical methods is described under finished 
product. 
Stability 
The manufacturing process of Spherox is a continuous process starting from blood and biopsy procurement to 
active substance and to finished product formulation and no holding step or storage of the active substance 
occurs. Therefore, stability of the active substance is not separately analysed.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  implantation  suspension  equivalent  containing  10-70  spheroids/cm2 
spheroids  of  human  autologous  matrix-associated  chondrocytes  as  active  substance  for  intraarticular  use 
during a surgical procedure. 
The active substance, spheroids of human autologous matrix-associated chondrocytes, is formulated in 0.9% 
sodium chloride solution and is delivered using three primary packing units for application, depending on the 
preferences  of  the  surgeon  and  number  of  spheroids  require,  which  corresponds  to  the  defect  area.  These 
include  a  syringe  of  max  100  spheroids or  applicator  (co.fix  150)  of  150  mm containing  a  maximum  of  60. 
The composition of the finished product is presented in Table 4. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017

Table 4. Composition of the finished product 
The applicator (co.fix 150) is placed into a sterile tube and additionally surrounded by an extra bag. One tube 
may contain a maximum of two co.fix 150. The applicator is made of thermoplastic polyurethane, the sealing 
plug on one side of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and a silicone stopper on the other side. The applicator is 
delivered with an application device (sterile injection syringe).  
The pre-filled syringe consists of a luer lock, a sealing ring and a cover cap. The filled syringe is packed into a 
sterile  tube  with  a  screw-type  cap  and  additionally  surrounded  by  an  extra  bag.  All  parts  of  the  pre-filled 
syringe are made of polypropylene, the sealing ring of isoprene. Silicone oil serves as lubricant. The pre-filled 
syringe is delivered with an application device (indwelling cannula or filter stem).  
The number of primary packaging units delivered depends on the type of the primary packaging unit and the 
number  of  spheroids  necessary  for  the  specific  defect  size  (10-70  spheroids/cm²).  One  applicator  has  a 
maximum capacity of 60 spheroids in a volume of up to 200 microlitre isotonic sodium chloride solution. One 
pre-filled  syringe  has  a  maximum  capacity  of  100  spheroids  in  a  volume  of  up  to  1,000  microlitre  isotonic 
sodium chloride solution. 
The  chosen  material  for  primary  packaging  complies  with  Ph.Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the 
container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is  adequate  for  the  intended  use  of  the 
product. 
The  formulation  contains  no  overage  or  overfill.  The  intended  commercial  formulation  is  the  same  as  that 
used during the clinical studies.  
Pharmaceutical development 
The  applicant  has  described  the development  of the  finished  product  formulation,  which  has  been  based  on 
NaCl/PBS solutions.  
Physiological  saline  solution  (0.9%  NaCl)  is  the  only  excipient  used  for  Spherox.  The  purpose  of  saline  is 
mimicking  of  the  usual  cellular  environment  and  transport  in  0.9%  NaCl  solution  avoids  that  the  spheroids 
dry up and stores them in a physiological environment.  
Physiological saline solution (0.9% NaCl) is a well-known pharmaceutical excipient and its quality is compliant 
with Ph.Eur. requirements. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation 
The development of the product has been focused to achieve the following requirements:  
1.  Three-dimensional  cell  transplant  containing  chondrocytes  in  a  terminated  proliferation  stage  and 
initiated differentiation stage 
2.  Avoiding  suturing  of  periosteal  flap  and  any  other  additional  fixation  step  and  therefore  avoiding 
artificial matrix structures 
3.  Short operation time

4.  Mini-arthrotomic or arthroscopic procedure 
5.  Simple surgical procedure 
6.  Maintaining autologous nature of the product and excluding animal derived materials 
To  improve  handling  by  the  surgeon,  in  2010  the  applicant  developed  and  introduced  an  applicator  system 
(co.fix),  which  is  formed  in  the  shape  of  a  catheter,  in  addition  to  the  existing  syringe  formulation.  The 
applicator  allows  placing  spheroid  by  spheroid  into  the  defect  using  a  less  invasive  operation-method.  The 
applicator system (co.fix) is made out of polyurethane which was selected on the basis of its low adhesion of 
the spheroids during the transportation and application procedure.  
Validation  of  the  co.fix  applicator  system  demonstrated  tightness  of  the  system  and  product  stability.  In 
conclusion,  both  primary  packaging  systems  (syringe  or  co.fix  applicator)  have  been  evaluated  for  their 
suitability and adequacy for the intended use.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Spherox is a continuous process from biopsy procurement to finished product 
formulation  and  no  holding  step  is  foreseen  for  the  active  substance.  The  manufacturer  of  the  product  is 
CO.DON AG, Warthestr. 21, 14513 Teltow, Germany. 
Manufacture  of  the  finished  product  is  performed  by  washing  of  the  spheroids  and  addition  of  0.9%  NaCl 
solution and filling into the primary packaging units (i.e. pre-filled syringe and applicator with a stem length 
of 150 mm (co.fix 150)). 
One batch includes all spheroids which originate from human chondrocytes obtained from the biopsy of one 
patient taken during one surgery. 
The  product  may  be  delivered  in  more  than  one  of  the  above  mentioned  primary  packaging  units.  The 
number of primary packaging units delivered depends on the type of primary packaging unit and the number 
of  spheroids  necessary  for  the  specific  defect  size  (10–70  spheroids/cm²).  The  quantity  of  spheroids 
formulated per batch for the two presentations is depicted in Table 5.

For labelling, the primary packaging unit(s), the sequential order number (batch number) and the number of 
contained spheroids are marked. The secondary packaging unit and the final packaging unit are marked with 
the  patient  key.  The  packaging  unit  (pouch)  is  then  labelled  with  the  product  label  which  is  printed  on  a 
sticker.  Additional  labelling  information  specific  to  a  Member  State  is  provided  on  the  label  in  a  boxed area 
(blue box), as required. The patient identification code includes an abbreviation of name and birth date of the 
patient. 
Process validation 
As  this  is  a  continuous  process  from  biopsy  collection  to  finished  product  formulation  process  validation  is 
discussed under active substance above. 
Process controls 
As  this  is  a  continuous  process  from  biopsy  collection  to  finished  product  formulation  process  controls  are 
detailed under active substance above. 
Characterisation 
Characterisation of the spheroids is covered under active substance. 
For  finished  product  characterisation,  the  applicant  has  identified  relevant  process  related  impurities  (i.e. 
DMSO,  papain,  gentamycin  and  amphotericin)  and  theoretical  concentrations  of  these  substances  in  the 
finished  product  are  presented.  It  has  been  concluded  that  the  remaining  levels  of  these  process  related 
impurities  are  toxicologically  irrelevant.  As  regards  product  related  impurities  such  as  contaminating  cell 
types, the applicant discussed the potential risk of other cell types derived from collection and purification of 
the  biopsy  and  in  particular  the  presence  of  contaminating  cells  from  the  synovium,  in  the  spheroids.  A 
suitable  marker  for  selection  of  the  potential  cellular  impurity  (synoviocytes)  has  been  implemented.  Data 
support that based on levels in historical batches, the need for testing of other cellular impurities from bone 
and fat tissue is not required. A new limit for synoviocytes is set.  
Product specification  
The  specification  of  finished  product  includes  tests  to  specify  the  following  quality  attributes:  Number  of 
viable  cells  per  spheroid,  percent  of  cell  viability,  expression  level  of  chondrogenic  marker  (identity), 
expression  level  of    potency  marker),  synoviocyte  content  (determined  by  the  expression  level  of  a 
synoviocyte marker)and tests for mycoplasma, bacterial endotoxins and sterility.  
Analytical methods 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods)  appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH Q2 (R1).  
The  previously  used  identity  markers  were  reconsidered  and  novel  markers  were  identified  using  a  genome 
wide screening method by gene array analyses as described in the non-clinical study report (cod 55). Using 
this  method,  a  marker  was  identified  and  validated  as  a  novel  identity  marker  for  in-process  control  of  the 
Monolayer and at a lower level in the 3D cultivation of Spherox. 
For potency expression levels are determined by qPCR. The reasoning behind the introduction of a marker for 
potency has been accepted. The target concentration in each sample is calculated relative to a non-regulated 
reference  gene  (i.e. housekeeping  gene)  and  the  result  is  expressed  as  a  target/reference  ratio  (T/R), thus 
normalizing the expression levels of the target gene. The expression of potency as a T/R, a relative value for 
potency, has been considered to be acceptable.

The  applicant  has  also  addressed  the  issue  concerning  the  relevance  of  the  limit the  potency  marker  As  no 
efficacy data are present for the validation lots from 2015 these lots have been compared with data from lots 
used in clinical studies. The process validation batches and batches from the clinical trials were addressed by 
comparing the operational ranges of process parameters used during clinical trials and the process validation. 
The  data  presented  are  in  support  of  comparable  process  performance  between  lots  manufactured  for  the 
clinical trials and lots manufactured after the process validation. It can be concluded that the results indicate 
that the manufacturing process has not influenced the quality and gives a comparable finished product.  
The results for cell number and viability testing demonstrated the assays to be robust, accurate and reliable.  
The  provided  process  validation  data  include  IPCs  and  release  parameters  for  30  consecutive  batches  used 
for implantation. According to the applicant, all batches were released onto the German market, which in this 
case  means  under  the  hospital  exemption.  Thus,  the  clinical  relevance  of  batches  used  for  validation  was 
unclear.  The  applicant  has  now  justified  why  the  data  from  the  process  validation  are  comparable  to  those 
used in the Phase  II  and  Phase III studies. Still, the applicant is expected to conduct a prospective process 
validation  post  MA  using  batches  manufactured  with  a  well-controlled  process.  Also,  the  applicant  is 
recommended  to  further  explore  those  parameters  that  do  not  correlate  with  efficacy  to  verify  that  proper 
limits  have  been  set.  Furthermore,  quality  data  post  MA  should  be  collected  from  sufficient  number  of 
batches to demonstrate consistency, proper quality and genetic stability of the cells in the FP and to alleviate 
the risks of high numbers of non-responders in the future. 
The sterility test is evaluated after release of finished product. The number of cells per spheroid is performed 
on one spheroid only.  
Batch analysis 
The provided validation data include IPCs and release parameters for 30 batches used for implantation which 
also include data from new tests (identity, potency and impurity). The clinical relevance of batches used for 
validation has been clarified and a comparability comparison was done with batches from clinical trials. 
As  a  post-authorisation  commitment,  the  applicant  has  agreed  to  further  confirm  process  validation  using 
batches from a well-controlled process post-marketing (see above). 
Reference materials 
No reference material is available for the active substance or finished product. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for Spherox is 72 hours. The product should be stored at temperatures between 1 °C 
and 10 °C, not frozen and not irradiated. In addition the outer packaging should not be opened before use to 
prevent microbial contamination.  
Stability  studies  were  performed  on  3  batches  of  each  primary  package.  Tests  were  performed  for 
chondrogenic markers, cells per spheroid, viability and sterility. 
Based on the available stability data, the shelf life and storage conditions as stated in the SPC are acceptable. 
The  presented  data  are  conclusive  and  also  supportive  of  the  stability  of  the  product.  The  updated  viability 
specification is deemed as sufficient in view of available data and clinical efficacy.

Adventitious agents 
The raw materials used in the cultivation process are with exception of collagenase not of animal origin. For 
collagenase the valid EDQM TSE certificate is provided.  
Autologous  material  (blood  and  tissue)  is  used.  Blood  testing  according  to  2006/17/EC  is  performed.  Viral 
contamination  of  autologous  donor  at  time  of  treatment  cannot  be  excluded,  however  this  is  considered  an 
acceptable risk because it represents no new infection and it is not transplanted to critical tissue with respect 
to possible damage. 
Viral  safety  of  the  process  has  been  checked  in  a  risk  analysis  through  FMEA-method  (Failure  Mode  and 
Effects  Analysis)  comparing  likelihood  and  effect  (available  on  request).  All  raw  and  starting  materials  have 
been found to be uncritical. 
Regarding microbiological safety, sterilisation by heat or UV of the finished product or sterile filtration is not 
possible for the product consisting of the viable chondrocytes. Microbial control during manufacture is based 
on  a  process  design  which  focuses  on  risk  mitigation.  This  is  achieved  by  the  use  of  an  integrated  isolator 
(IIT®)  system  under  regular  microbiological  monitoring  (comprising  air  and  surface  sampling)  for  the entire 
production process. 
Sterility is tested at several steps of the manufacturing process including the monolayer culture and spheroid 
culture An automated system is used, which performs microbiological control of cellular products according to 
Ph.  Eur.  2.6.27  instead  of  the  currently  used  sterility  testing  method  according  to  Ph.  Eur.  2.6.1.  An  action 
plan is in place if positive results are seen in the sterility testing post treatment. The applicant’s strategy to 
control sterility in the manufacturing process is considered to be acceptable.  
Bacterial endotoxin testing according to Ph.Eur. 2.6.14 is performed on all material coming into direct contact 
with the product and as part of finished product release testing. 
Mycoplasma  testing  is  performed  during  manufacture  and  as  part  of  finished  product  release  using 
quantitative PCR method in accordance with Ph. Eur. 2.6.7. 
In  conclusion  the  adventitious  agent  safety  evaluation  and  controls  implemented  during  manufacture  and 
control of Spherox are considered acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The application for Spherox was received by the EMA on 3 December 2012. The product has been legally on 
the market in Germany since 2004, and has also been available in Belgium, Greece, Italy, Spain and Austria. 
During  this  period  changes  have  been  introduced  to  the  manufacturing  process  to take  account  of  scientific 
development (e.g. elimination of animal derived materials) and to improve the manufacturing process.  
During assessment, several major objections have been raised on the quality side pertaining to the validation 
of  the  manufacturing  process  and  operational  ranges  applied.  In  particular  maximal  culture  times  for  the 
critical  intermediate  (cells  from  2D  culture)  and  for  the  active  substance  (spheroids)  were  questioned  and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017

alternate  steps  during  manufacture  were  considered  not  to  be  supported  by  relevant  data.  With  respect  to 
the  control  strategy  for  contaminating  cell  types  a  test  for  purity  was  requested  and  the  chosen  potency 
assay was considered insufficiently developed and justified. 
There was also a concern on the comparability of the product batches used in clinical trials versus those to be 
released for commercial use should be demonstrated.  
Regarding microbiological control the applicant was  asked to introduce a rapid test as a release test and/or 
justify his strategy for control on microbiological safety in order to guarantee sterility of the product.  
During the procedure the applicant has been able to resolve all major objections and other concerns.  
The  applicant  was  able  to  address  the  concern  on  process  validation  and  demonstrate  that the  final  agreed 
specifications  are  clinically  justified.  With  respect  to  comparability  the  applicant  presented  a  comparison 
between clinical trial batches and batches in the process validation which was considered to be acceptable to 
confirm  the  comparability between  the  clinical  and  commercial  batches.    Furthermore,  the  culture times  for 
the  2D  and  3D  cell  cultures  have  been  compared  with  clinical  data  and  the  culture  ranges  and  limits  have 
been  tightened  accordingly.  Thus,  as  such  the  design  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  its  control  is 
considered acceptable.  
As  regards  consistency  in  manufacturing,  the  presented  data  from  batches  produced  show  some  deviations 
according to the set parameters of cultivation time (P0), cellular impurity and cellularity (cells per spheroid). 
Indeed  such  deviations  during  process  validations  would  not  be  found  acceptable.  However,  this  is  not  a 
traditional dedicated process validation programme that has been performed. It is instead a collection of data 
from batches produced in the past, which can be considered to be clinically justified.  
Therefore,  the  applicant  will  conduct  a  prospective  process  validation  post  marketing  authorisation  using 
batches manufactured with a well-controlled process. Also, quality data will be collected post marketing from 
a  sufficient  number  of  batches  to  demonstrate  consistency,  quality  and  genetic  stability  of  the  cells  in  the 
finished product (see Annex II condition number 1). 
The  applicant  is  further  requested  to  review  the  results  from  batches  manufactured  with  the  newly  defined 
process  parameters  (as  will  be  validated  in  a  prospective  process  validation).  Based  on  these  results,  more 
tightly defined operational ranges and limits in the manufacturing process will be considered. This approach is 
considered to be acceptable. 
The applicant is also requested to validate the potency assay post marketing and monitor its correlation with 
the efficacy outcome (see Annex II condition number 2). 
The  applicant  has  presented  a  three  pillar  approach  as  a  strategy  for  microbiological  control  of  the 
manufacturing  process  starting  from  testing  of  biopsy  to  the  release of  product.  The  introduction  of  a  rapid 
method for release has been accepted. Also, the action plan in place if positive results are seen in the sterility 
testing post treatment is found acceptable.  
The question on the appropriate standard term to describe the pharmaceutical form was discussed during the 
procedure.  The  applicant’s  proposal  for  ‘living  tissue  equivalent’  could  not  be  supported  by  the  CAT/CHMP. 
The  CAT/CHMP  considered  that  ‘implantation  suspension’  would  more  appropriately  describe  the  finished 
product  presentation  for  Spherox.  The  Committee  felt  that  the  term  ‘implantation  suspension’  would  better 
describe  the  structural  appearance  of  Spherox  as  the  product  is  to  be  administered  using  a  syringe  rather 
than tweezers thus resembling rather a suspension than a solid product (e.g. a matrix or a tissue). 
From  a  quality  point  of  view,  the  marketing  authorisation  application  for  Spherox  is  considered  approvable. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 27/125 
  
  
However, the CAT/CHMP has identified the two conditions as detailed in section 2.2.5. to further address the 
quality development issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product.  
The classification of these post-authorisation commitments as Annex II conditions (see 2.2.5) is justified on 
the basis that the process validation and the validation of the potency assay are both essential to confirm a 
consistent  manufacturing  process  and  to  obtain  a  coherent  assay  for  potency  determination  of  the  finished 
product.  A  consistent  manufacturing  process  and  a  validated  potency  assay  are  necessary  to  deliver  in  a 
reliable manner the finished product with the demonstrated safety and efficacy. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  CAT/CHMP  has  identified  the  following  measures  necessary  to  address  the  identified  quality 
developments issues that may have a potential impact on the safe and effective use of the medicinal product: 
1. To conduct a prospective process validation study post marketing using batches manufactured with a well-
controlled process and to collect quality data from a sufficient number of batches to demonstrate consistency, 
quality and genetic stability of the cells in the finished product. On the basis of the process validation study, 
in  process  controls  should  be  reviewed  and  the  acceptance  criteria  tightened  accordingly  for  the 
manufacturing  process  for  P0  culture  time,  total  ML  culture  time,  spheroid  culture  time  and  amount  of 
synovial impurities. Timeline: April 2019 
2. To re-validate the potency assay post marketing and to monitor its correlation with the efficacy outcome. 
Timeline: March 2018 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAHs  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific  progress,  the 
CAT/CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  treatment  of  articulate  cartilage  defects  with  Spherox  is  intended  to  generate  cartilage  repair  tissue 
which  fills  and  integrates  well  within  the  defect  and  which  is  of  comparable  quality  as  the  original  hyaline 
articulate  cartilage.  Accordingly,  the  nonclinical  programme  consisting  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacology 
studies  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  characteristics  of  the  cells  in  the  spheroids  and  the  capacity  of  the 
spheroids to regenerate hyaline cartilage. In addition, nonclinical safety tests were also conducted. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 28/125 
  
  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary and secondary pharmacodynamic studies  
A  combination  of  in  vitro  studies  and  in  vivo  studies  was  conducted  to  characterise  the  functionality  of  the 
spheroids and to show proof-of-concept. 
Initial in vitro studies were conducted to show that human chondrocytes from different donors were capable 
of generating stable three-dimensional aggregates of cells (spheroids) and to evaluate the optimal culturing 
conditions  to  generate  chondrophere  of  a  consistent  quality.  The  size  of  a  spheroid  was  shown  to  be 
dependent  on  the  seeding  density  of  monolayer  chondrocytes  used  for  its  formation  as  well  as  on  the 
cultivation  time.  Viability  of  human  spheroids  was  addressed  by  evaluating  apoptosis  and  necrosis  up  to  8 
weeks  of  cultivation  in  vitro.  A  small  number  of  single  apoptotic  and  necrotic  cells  were  detected  evenly 
distributed  in  the  spheroids  indicating  that  the  cells  in  the  interior  of  the  spheroids  are  viable  and  not 
subjected to low nutrient or oxygen supply. 
Comparative  analyses of  chondrocytes  from  different  species  showed  that only  a  limited  number  of  animals 
including  Göttinger  mini-pig  and  Merino  sheep  were  capable  of  producing  stable  spheroids.  These  species 
were then selected for proof-of-concept studies.  
Different  aspects,  critical  for  spheroids  to  regenerate  cartilage  (proof  of  principle),  were  investigated  in  3-
dimentional cell cultures, in co-cultures of spheroids and cartilage explants and subsequently in in vivo proof 
of  concept  studies.  This  approach  included  evaluation  of  morphology  of  chondrocytes  within  the  spheroids 
and the investigations showed that cells within the spheroids are round in shape, whereas cells at the surface 
are  elongated  similarly  to  native  cartilage  where  elongated  chondrocytes  are  observed  at  the  cartilage 
surface.  Initially,  the  cell  density  was  high  in  the  spheroid  but  that  decreased  with  time  in  parallel  with 
increased production of extracellular matrix (ECM).  
Analysis  of  markers  for  chondrocyte  differentiation  and  production  of  hyaline  extra-cellular  matrix:  Human 
chondrocytes cultivated in the 3D system for at least 2 weeks formed spheroids which expressed extracellular 
matrix components, hyaline-cartilage specific markers and chondrogenic growth factors in vitro indicating the 
potential  to  form  hyaline-like  cartilage  tissue  in  vivo  after  implantation.  Aggrecan  was  expressed  at  a 
constant  level  during  the  time  span  of  12  weeks.  Similarly,  collagen  type  I  was  consistently  expressed 
throughout the observation period. Hyaline-specific glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) could be detected only after 
6  weeks  of  culture.  However,  there  was  marked  inter-individual  variability  in  expression  of  hyaline-specific 
marker in spheroids, in particular in expression of collagen type II. The expression of hyaline-specific markers 
was in general lower in in vitro cultured spheroids compared to native cartilage. Expression of hyaline-specific 
markers  such  as  S100,  collagen  type  II  and  aggrecan  was  confirmed  in  this  study.  However,  in  the 
experimental  set  up,  a  range  of  monolayer  passages,  number  of  cells  for  initiating  spheroid  culture  and 
different  cultivation  times  on  the  spheroids  was  tested.  It  was  not  reported  whether  such  production 
variations  had  any  influence  on  the  functionality  of  the  spheroids.  During  the  initial  assessment  the 
uncertainties  regarding  the  above  stated  variations,  experimental  set  up,  cultivation  times,  number  of  cells 
etc.  were  questioned.  In  the  updated  dossier  and  upon  submission  of  responses,  the  applicant  performed 
several  in  vitro  studies  which  aimed  to  further  characterise  the  cells  and  to  establish  a  more  reliable 
production of the spheroids. The vast majority of the generated data is considered to be related to the actual 
quality of the products and hence the data is presented in section 2.2.  
The  cultivation  time  in  monolayer  culture  had  a  strong  influence  on  the  capacity  of  chondrocytes  to  re-
differentiate to a chondrocytic phenotype capable of producing hyaline ECM. Already at monolayer passage 3, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 29/125 
  
  
there  was  a  loss  of  collagen  type  II  expression  in  some  patient  samples,  which  could  not  be  regained  in 
spheroid  cultures.  The  marked  variability  in  chondrocytic  expression  markers  is  a  concern  and  no  reliable 
marker  for  predicting  efficacy in  vivo  has  been  identified.  According  to  the  applicant,  a  systemic  analysis  of 
markers in spheroids and correlation to biopsies is included in ongoing phase III studies. Considering that the 
clinical data can be correlated to quality specifications of the product, the lack of solid non-clinical data in this 
area is acceptable.  
Investigations  on  adhesion,  fusion  of  spheroids  and  integration  of  spheroids  to  host  tissue  surface  at 
implantation in vitro: Spheroids were able to adhere firmly to femur condyle cartilage explants within a 20-30 
min of co-culture. Rapid adhesion was also observed in the in vivo biodistribution study conducted in merino 
sheep.  In  an  experiment  where  spheroids  and  cartilage  explants  were  co-cultured  for  up  to  11  weeks,  the 
complete  process  from  adhesion,  fusion  and  integration  onto  the  explants  was  demonstrated.    The  process 
involved firm adhesion to the surface of the explants, cell-cell/matrix contacts, and migration of chondrocytes 
on  the  surface  of  spheroids  and  along  the  surface  of  native  cartilage  (remodelling).  This  was  followed  by 
fusion  of  spheroids  into  larger  aggregates  where  gaps  between  single  spheroids  were  filled  with  newly 
synthesised ECM. Eventually new repair tissue covered the explants. Chondrocytes were observed to migrate 
into existing fissures and grooves of the explants. The migratory capacity appears beneficial for the effect i.e. 
cells  migrate to  fill-in  cartilage tissue.  However,  migration  might  also be  a  potential  safety  issue if  the  cells 
should have a capacity to infiltrate e.g. subchondral bone when implanted in full thickness cartilage defects or 
if the subchondral bone is denuded upon debridement of the defect. In addition, it is noted that the applicant 
hypothesizes  that  the  mechanism  of  action  of  the  chondrocyte  spheroids  may  include  proliferation  of 
chondrocytes within the defect.  
Upon request from the CAT/CHMP, the applicant accounted for the extent of chondrocytes proliferation within 
the spheroids and the risk for potential migration/infiltration. Both, the in vitro and in vivo data show a low 
level  of  proliferation  both  before  transplantation  as  well  as  after  transplantation.  The  applicant  summarised 
the  non-clinical  and  clinical  data  available on  migratory/infiltration  and  claims that  there  are  no  non-clinical 
data, no clinical evidence and/or clinical relevance for biodistribution and/or infiltration of chondrocytes into 
the subchondral bone. In general it is very unfortunate that the pivotal efficacy and safety study of spheroids 
in merino sheep failed to show efficacy due to loss of the implant since relevant data from this study should 
have added additional important high level data on the issue at hand. Nevertheless, despite the uncertainties 
which  accompany  the  lack  of  pivotal  data,  it  is  the  view  of  the  CAT/CHMP  that  the  risk  for 
migration/infiltration is low and that additional non-clinical biodistribution studies are not called for.    
In  vivo  proof-of-concept  for  regeneration  of  hyaline  cartilage  from  implantation  of  spheroids: In  vivo  proof-
of-concept studies were conducted in immunodeficient mice and in two large animal models: a pilot study in 
minipig  and  a  pivotal  6-month  study  in  Merino  sheep.  In  these  studies  human  Spheroxs  or  autologous 
spheroids produced in an analogous way were used. Dose levels were comparable to, or slightly higher (up to 
2.3 times) than the maximum intended clinical dose of 70 spheroids/cm2. 
The  mode  of  action  of  human  spheroids  was  demonstrated  in  immunocompromised  SCID  mice.  The  fused 
human spheroids cultivated on native human cartilage explants were subcutaneously implanted into the SCID 
mice. The implanted spheroids integrated into the surrounding tissue, remodelled, migrated and filled up the 
cartilage  defect  with  de  novo  synthesised  repair  tissue  showing  characteristics  of  chondrogenic  hyaline-like 
ECM.  These  data  demonstrate  that  the  spheroids  are  capable  of  producing  hyaline  cartilage  tissue  when 
implanted  into  a  chondrogenic  environment.  However,  this  model  did  not  allow  for  an  evaluation  of  the 
biomechanical  properties  of  the  repair  tissue  as  this  was  an  ectopic  model.  Subsequently,  proof  of  concept 
was  investigated  in  a  pilot  study  in  minipigs  (large  animal  orthotopic  model)  using  porcine  spheroids 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 30/125 
  
  
manufactured in an analogous way to Spherox. Defects reflecting the average size of human cartilage defects 
were  created  in  the  minipig  knee  joints  (trochlear  groove)  and  treated  with  porcine  spheroids  in  three 
animals.  The  dose  of  10–70  spheroids/cm2  defect  was  used.  Two  animals  with  untreated  defects  served  as 
controls.  Two  months  after  implantation  the  spheroids  had  filled  and  integrated  well  in  the  defect.  In 
contrast, non-treated defects displayed either overspreading of scar tissue or incomplete filling. The spheroid 
induced repair tissue displayed several histological/immunohistological properties typical for hyaline cartilage. 
The  biomechanical  properties  were  similar  to  native  cartilage;  however  the  limited  study  period  of  two 
months is too short for drawing any conclusions regarding long term effects.  
Long term efficacy was intended to be evaluated in the orthotopic large animal model, Merino sheep, after 6 
and  9  months  post-implantation  using  autologous  ovine  spheroids  manufactured  in  an  analogous  way  to 
Spheroxs.  However,  the  data  showed  no  difference  between  spheroid  treated  and  non-treated  defects  at  9 
months post-implantation as repair tissue was not detected. Evidence points to an early loss of the implanted 
spheroids, possibly due to the use of a bilateral model which prevented immobilisation and therefore healing 
of the joint.  
There are no concerns related to secondary pharmacodynamics. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety  pharmacology  was  not  evaluated  with  Spherox.  This  is  acceptable  given  that  the  product  consists  of 
autologous  chondrocytes  that  are  implanted  locally  -  into  their  natural  environment  and  that  these  cells  do 
not  secrete  any  substances  that  would  have  an  effect  on  vital  organ  functions.  Similarly,  there  are  no 
concerns related to secondary pharmacodynamics.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  studies  addressing  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  were  performed  and  the  Committee  did  not 
consider these necessary due to the nature of the medicinal product. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Conventional  studies  evaluating  the  ADME  are  not  considered  feasible  or  relevant  for  cell  based  medicinal 
product.  Instead,  the  applicant  followed  the  guideline  on  human  cell  based  medicinal  products 
(EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006)  and  reflection  paper  on  in  vitro  cultured  chondrocyte  containing  products  for 
cartilage repair of the knee (EMA/CAT/CPWP/568181/2009) and evaluated the potential for biodistribution of 
the product in two in vivo studies. 
In a GLP compliant study using immunodeficient NSG mice, biodistribution of cells out from human Spheroxs 
implanted  subcutaneously  into  the  back  was  investigated  after  4  weeks.  There  were  no  indications  of 
significant  systemic  distribution  of  the  cells,  or  were  there  any  indications  of  tumour  or  ectopic  tissue 
formation  after  6  months  in  the  tumourigenicity  part  of  this  study.  This  supports  the  notion  of  the  low 
biodistribution  capacity  of  the  cells  of  the  Spherox  product.  However,  skin  biopsies  taken  in  the  immediate 
vicinity  of  the  implantation  site  were  occasionally  HLA  positive  (marker  for  human  cells).  These  were  most 
likely  related  to  the  technical  challenges  i.e.    fragmentation  of  the  Spherox  implants,  rather  than  an 
indication of actively migrating cells from Spherox implant. The selection of organs collected for PCR analysis: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 31/125 
  
  
liver, lymph nodes, lung, spleen and kidneys represent the most likely tissues to which cells could distribute if 
they would escape from the implant and lack of data from other organs is thus acceptable.   
Although  the  data  regarding  the  lack  of  potential  for  biodistribution  of  human  Spheroxs  seems  convincing, 
this  information  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  given  that  this  ectopic  model  and  the  spheroids  were 
implanted  subcutaneously:  while  the  use  of  immunodeficient  mice  assures  that  the  implanted  human 
chondrocytes  are  not  rejected,  the  local  environment  in  the  mouse  skin  may  not  provide  the  optimal 
physiological condition for promoting survival and function of human chondrocytes.  
Biodistribution was also evaluated in an orthotopic setting in the Merino sheep. In this short-term study three 
Merino  sheep  were  implanted  in  one  joint  with  unlabelled  spheroid  to  evaluate  adhesion  and  injected  with 
fluorescently labelled spheroids in the contra-lateral joint to evaluate biodistribution. This study indicated that 
spheroids  are  retained  within  the  joint.  However,  this  study  has  several  flaws  which  limit  its  value:  initial 
experiment could not exclude that PLK26 labelling did not have an effect on the quality of spheroids, only a 
local  visual  inspection  was  conducted  to  trace  the  spheroids  that  had  been  injected  into  the  joint  (i.e. 
systemic biodistribution of spheroids or cells was not conducted). Lastly, only a small number of animals was 
treated  in  this  study  and  allogenic  cells  were  used.  It  should  be  noted  that  poplietal  lymph  nodes  (lymph 
nodes  draining  the  knee  joint)  of  two  of  the  animals  were  enlarged.  This  could  be  due  to  the  surgical 
procedure, but it cannot be excluded that an immune response towards the allogeneic cells was induced. If 
so,  the  allogeneic  immune  response  could  have  limited  any  potential  for  biodistribution  of  cells  of  the 
spheroids escaping the joint. Conventional metabolism and excretion studies are not considered relevant for 
cell-based medicinal products and have not been performed with Spherox. Given the nature of the product, 
there is no potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Omission of such studies is agreed. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No  conventionally  designed  toxicity  studies  on  Spherox  have  been  performed;  given  that  the  product  is 
autologous  and  that  manufacturing  takes  place  without  any  growth  factors  or  other  external  stimuli  that 
requires safety testing, such studies are not considered necessary. However, in line with the Reflection paper 
on 
in-vitro 
cultured 
chondrocyte 
containing  products 
for 
cartilage 
repair  of 
the 
knee 
(EMA/CAT/CPWP/568181/2009),  safety  endpoints  have  been  incorporated  into  the  five  different  proof  of 
concept and biodistribution/tumourigenicity studies in immunodeficient mice, minipigs and the Merino sheep. 
In these studies, either human Spheroxs or autologous spheroids produced analogously to human Spheroxs 
were used. Safety of Spherox was also addressed as a primary objective in two in vitro studies assessing cell 
proliferation  and  senescence.  In  the  in  vivo  studies,  a  single  dose  of  spheroids  was  either  injected  or 
implanted into a knee joint or administered subcutaneously in the back of the animal. Except for one study in 
the minipig, in which up to 3.2 fold the maximum clinical dose was applied, all studies used doses similar to 
the  intended  clinical  dose.  Addressed  safety  aspects  included  potential  single  dose  toxicity,  local 
toxicity/tolerance,  biodistribution  and  tumourigenicity.  No  genotoxicity,  conventional  carcinogenicity  and 
reproductive- and developmental toxicity studies were performed which is in line with the guideline on cell-
based medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006). 
Local tolerance and systemic toxicity after implantation of autologous spheroids in the joint: One pivotal GLP-
compliant efficacy and safety study Merino sheep was designed to evaluate local and systemic toxicity during 
6  months of  implantation of  autologous  spheroids in  a  femoral  condyle  defect.  There  were  no indications  of 
treatment related adverse effects and the implant was well tolerated. Nevertheless, this study failed to show 
an effect of the product due to loss of Spherox implant. The use of a bilateral model appears to be the main 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 32/125 
  
  
contributing factor to the loss of transplant. In the updated dossier the applicant has submitted the finalized 
study  report  (9  months  bilateral  sheep  study,  study  number  41/02-B).  The  complete  report  do  not  indicate 
any  changes  as  to  the  data  generated  after  6  months,  i.e.  “no  negative  effect  of  the  treatment of  cartilage 
defects  with  ACT3D-S  on  the  general  health  or  the  healing  of  the  operated  joint  was  observed”.  However, 
since  several  lines of  evidence  point towards  a  loss  of  the  test item  from  the  implantation  site  the  value  of 
safety data collected in this study can in general be regarded as low  
Due  to  the  failure  of  the  GLP-study  in  the  Merino  sheep,  the  nonclinical  safety  data  with  Spherox  and 
analogously produced spheroids needed to be supported by studies conducted in immunocompromised mice 
and  in  minipigs.  There  were  some  deficiencies  in  the  experimental  design  which  hamper  the  evaluation  of 
safety  of  the  individual  studies,  e.g.  low  numbers  of  treated  animals,  lack  of  GLP-compliance  and  limited 
study  duration  to  allow  long  term  safety  assessment,  but  collectively  they  provided  good  support  that 
implanted chondrocyte spheroids are well tolerated. There were no obvious signs of general or local toxicity 
observed  in  any  of  the  studies.  However,  in  vitro  co-culture  studies  have  indicated  that  Spheroxs  have 
capacity to migrate into grooves and fissures of cartilage explants. This is primarily seen as beneficial for the 
effect of the product but may also pose a risk for infiltration into subchondral bone.  
The potential for biodistribution and tumour development was tested as recommended in the reflection paper 
on  in  vitro  cultured  chondrocyte  containing  products  and  the  guideline  on  cell-based  medicinal  products. 
There  was  no  indication  of  hypertrophy  or  ectopic  cartilage  formation  or  other  clear  signs  of  active 
biodistribution  including  migration  of  the  implanted  cells  from  Spherox  into  the  surrounding  tissues  were 
observed in any studies carried out, including the 6 months GLP study in immunodeficient mice which support 
the absence of the tumourigenic potential. 
The  notion  that  in  clinical  situation,  the  Spherox  implant  will  not  be  in  open  tissue  surroundings  such  as  in 
subcutaneous mice model, and the notion that no ectopic cartilage formation was observed in the mouse GLP 
study  related  to  the  Spherox  product  (in  which  two  spontaneous  tumours,  not  of  human  origin  were 
observed)  or  in  any  other  in  vivo  studies  conducted  supports  the  low  biodistribution  and  tumourigenic 
potential of the Spherox product. In the GLP mice biodistribution study, occasional HLA-positive cells outside 
the larger Spherox / HLA positive implant area on the mice was observed, but these were most likely related 
to the fragmentation of the Spherox implant. 
Clarification  was  sought  by  the  CAT/CHMP  on  the  quality  and  fate  of  the  Spherox  implants  in  vivo,  i.e.  the 
applicant  was  asked  to  provide  a  discussion  concerning  if  the  Spherox  fragmentation  and  difficulties  on 
identifying  the  Spheroxs  in  mouse  GLP  study,  and  the  study  failure  (GLP  bilateral  sheep  model)  could  be 
related to possible biological reason or the varied consistency of the Spherox product or solely related to the 
technical  reasons  (implantation  or  detection  technique)  and  the  choice  of  the  animal  model.  The  applicant 
suggests  that  the  spheroid  fragmentations,  as  observed  in  both  animal  studies,  are  solely  due  to  technical 
reasons and that no data suggests that the study failure were related to any biological properties (apoptosis, 
necrosis or degeneration) of the transplants. The CAT/CHMP agreed.  
To  investigate  whether  the  manufacturing  of  Spheroxs  increases  the  risk  for  cell  transformation  of 
chondrocytes, the effect of extended monolayer culture (up to passage 10 for the senescence study) on the 
proliferation  rate  and  senescence  of  chondrocytes  in  the  extended  cultures  was  characterised.  Data  from 
these  studies  suggest  that  cells  from  five  tested  samples  reached  senescence.  However,  there  are  also 
indications about the variability between donors in this regard. Data also indicate a risk for genetic instability 
which increases with higher number of passages. Also, there seems to be variability between patients in this 
regard.  Thus,  the  risk  for  genetic  alterations  cannot  be  completely  excluded  by  keeping  the  number  of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 33/125 
  
  
passages  to  a  minimum.  Consequently,  the  risks  associated  with  genetic  instability  will  be  addressed  on  a-
patient-basis by product quality parameters.  
Reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  were  not  conducted.  In  line  with  guidelines  on  cell-based 
medicinal  products  (EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006),  the  applicant  has  provided  an  acceptable  justification  for 
omitting these studies:  Spherox contains autologous cells with a local mechanism of action, and the risk for 
biodistribution of cells is limited. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Spherox  does  not  contain  GMOs.  It  is  composed  of  spheroids,  spherical  aggregates  of  ex  vivo  expanded 
human  autologous  cells  with  self-synthesized  extracellular  matrix.  It  belongs  to  the  group  of  biological 
medicinal  products  which  according  to  the  EMA  guideline  EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  is  exempted  from  the 
obligation to perform an environmental risk assessment. The excipient, isotonic sodium chloride solution, an 
electrolyte, is exempted as well.  
The  product  is  provided  as  individual  treatment  dose  (10–70  spheroids/cm²  defect)  and  applied  by 
intraarticular injection. The spheroids administered to the patient are likely to remain in the implantation site. 
No  biodistribution  or  excretion  is  expected.  Therefore,  the  product  is  not  released  to  the  environment.  The 
use of Spherox is unlikely to result in any risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  characterisation  of  Spherox  demonstrated  that  human  chondrocytes  are  capable  of 
producing three dimensional spheroids that upon implantation into a chondrogenic environment either in vitro 
or  in  vivo,  fuse  together,  remodel,  migrate,  fill  up  the  space  between  the  spheroids  and  the  cracks  and 
fissures in the cartilage defect with de novo hyaline like cartilage and extracellular matrix.  
The mode of action was convincingly demonstrated in in vitro cartilage explants and in vivo in subcutaneously 
implanted cartilage explants. This was further corroborated with the data from a large animal model, minipig, 
demonstrating  formation  of  hyaline-like  cartilage  repair  tissue  in  the  defects  after  two  months  post-
implantation.  Long  term  evaluation  of  efficacy  and  safety  in  the  orthotopic  femoral  condyle  cartilage  defect 
model  in  the  Merino  sheep  failed  to  show  any  evidence  of  repair  tissue  at  six  and  nine  months  post-
implantation due to loss of transplant. 
There was no indication on significant distribution of Spheroxs/chondrocytes to major organs based on data 
from  a  GLP-compliant  biodistribution  study  of  human  Spheroxs 
implanted  subcutaneously 
into 
immunodeficient mice. For the evaluation of the potential for biodistribution, it should also be considered that 
the  site  where  the  product  is  applied  –  the  cartilage-  is  avascular.  Thus  for  biodistribution  to  occur  the 
implanted cells would have to actively migrate through tissues out to the capsule of the joint which contains 
blood and lymph vessels. Despite the deficiencies of the biodistribution studies the in vitro and in vivo studies 
have shown that spheroid show rapid adherence to the defect surface and do not shown tendency for ectopic 
cartilage  formation.  There  are  no  indications  of  invasive  behaviour  of  the  cells  and  if  the  cells  are  correctly 
implanted  and  that the  integrity of  the  joint  capsule  is  not  damaged  (e.g.  by  surgical  procedures)  after the 
implantation,  biodistribution  does  not  seem  likely.  In  general  it  is  very  unfortunate  that  the  pivotal  efficacy 
and safety study of spheroids in merino sheep failed to show efficacy due to loss of the implant since relevant 
data  from  this  study  should  have  added  additional  important  high  level  data  on  the  issue  at  hand. 
Nevertheless,  despite  the  uncertainties  which  accompany  the  lack  of  pivotal  data,  it  is  the  view  of  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 34/125 
  
  
CAT/CHMP that the risk for migration/infiltration is low and that additional non-clinical biodistribution studies 
are not called for.  
Spherox  appeared  to  be  well  tolerated,  and  no  significant  safety  concerns  were  identified  in  any  of  the 
studies.  
The  long  term  effects  of  the  Spherox  product  cannot  be  fully  evaluated  from  the  in  vivo  data  as  the  GLP 
compliant sheep study of 9 months duration failed due to loss of Spherox implants. Despite the deficiencies 
of the pivotal safety study, when taking all other available data into account: 
• 
• 
• 
Lack  or  notable  local  and  systemic  toxicity  of  human  spheroids  in  a  6-months  in  vivo 
pharmacodynamic 
study 
in 
SCID  mice 
and 
in 
a 
6-months 
GLP-compliant 
biodistribution/tumourigenicity study in immunodeficient mice.  
Lack of notable local and systemic toxicity in a 2-month study in the minipig implanted with up to 230 
spheroids/cm2 of autologous porcine spheroids into the knee joint.  
Lack of significant biodistribution in SCID mice implanted subcutaneously with human Spheroxs. 
•  Safety  data  will  be  collected  from  the  obligatory  phase  III  clinical  studies,  which  is  expected  to 
override non-clinical data. 
The lack of non-clinical data on local and general toxicity after long-term exposure to autologous spheroids is 
considered  acceptable.  In  addition,  there  have  been  no  unexpected  findings  arise  in  the  ongoing  clinical 
studies of autologous spheroids, see section 2.6. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In summary, the CAT/CHMP concluded that the application is approvable from the non-clinical point of view. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Pivotal results are available from 2 clinical trials, namely a Phase II study (cod 16 HS 14) and a confirmatory 
Phase III study (cod 16 HS 13). For the Phase II clinical trial (cod 16 HS14) results are available from interim 
analysis  (final  assessment  –  1  year  after  treatment)  as  well  as  2-year  follow-up  (24  month)  and  3-year 
follow-up (36 month) data. For the Phase III clinical trial (cod 16 HS13) results are available from an interim 
analysis – 1-year (12 months) after treatment.  
•  Study  cod  16  HS  14  is  a  prospective,  randomised,  open-label  (blinded  radiologist),  uncontrolled, 
multicentre trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of the treatment of large defects (4-10 cm2) with 
three different doses of Spherox in subjects with cartilage defects of the knee. The study is conducted in 
Germany.  Patients  will  be  followed  for  60  months.  The  current  submission  contains  3-year  follow-up 
data for this study. 
•  Study  cod  16  HS  13  is  a  prospective,  randomised,  open-label  (central  reading  by  blinded  radiologist) 
active-controlled,  multicentre  trial  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  treatment  with  Spherox  to 
microfracture in subjects with cartilage defects of the knee with a defect size between 1 and 4 cm2. The 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 35/125 
  
  
study  is  conducted  in  Germany  and  Poland.  Patients  will  be  followed  for  60  months.  The  current 
submission  includes  the  results  from  a  12-month  interim  analysis  for  regulatory  purposes.  The  formal 
evaluation  of  superiority  is  to  be  performed  24  months  after  the  last  patient  had  received  study 
treatment. 
The  clinical  dossier  also  consists  of  data  made  available  from  investigator-initiated  studies  and  published 
literature reports. This included 3 retrospective and 8 prospective studies, mostly non-GCP compliant except 
for  one  prospective  uncontrolled  investigator-initiated  study  stated  to  be  GCP  compliant  by  the  Applicant 
(Fickert  et  al,  2011).  During  the  procedure,  additional  supportive  efficacy  and  safety  data  from  patients 
treated  in  clinical  routine  practice  between  2004  and  2012  were  submitted.  This  included  four  monocentric 
(Germany),  retrospective,  non-interventional data  collections,  cod  RS1  SR  (2015);  cod  RS2  RS  (2015);  cod 
RS3  TS  (2016);  and  cod  RS4  WZ  (2014).  In  addition,  the  applicant  submitted  an  additional  prospective 
uncontrolled  investigator-initiated  study  on  knee  cartilage  defects  (Siebold  et  al,  2015)  as  well  as  a 
retrospective study (Fickert et al, 2014) and a prospective uncontrolled investigator-initiated follow-up study 
by Körsmeier et al (2014) to support the treatment with Spherox of cartilage defects in the hip.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  applicant  did  not  perform  conventional  pharmacokinetic  studies  to  investigate  absorption,  distribution 
and  excretion,  and 
this 
is 
in 
line  with  CHMP  guideline  on  cell  based  medicinal  products 
(EMEA/CHMP/410869/2006),  which  states  that  the  conventional  ADME  studies  are  not  relevant  for  human 
cell-based  products.  The  EMA  Reflection  Paper  on  In  Vitro  Cultured  Chondrocyte  Containing  Products  for 
Cartilage Repair of the Knee (EMA/CAT/CPWP/568181/2009) states that there is no clear common agreement 
for clinical kinetic data needed to be analysed in the clinical setting. Migration of the cells might be a risk and 
the  applicant  has  conducted  several  nonclinical  in  vivo  studies  to  evaluate  possible  biodistribution  of 
spheroids,  tumourigenicity  and  ectopic  formation  of  cartilage  after  application  of  Spherox.  All  of  the  non-
clinical results suggest low biodistribution and tumorigenic potential of the Spherox product. In addition, the 
mode  of  action  does  not  indicate  the  capacity  of  the  chondrocytes  to  migrate  through  tissues  or  blood 
vessels. According to the applicant, no toxic substances are used during the manufacturing of Spherox. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No  clinical  studies  with  a  primary  pharmacodynamic  objective  have  been  performed.  However,  in  clinical 
trials Phase II (cod 16HS14) and Phase III (cod 16HS13) macroscopic, histological, immunohistochemical as 
well  as  MRI  assessment  were  performed.  In  accordance  with  “Reflection  paper  on  in-vitro  cultured 
chondrocyte  containing  products  for  cartilage  repair  of  the  knee”  (CAT,  2010),  a  pharmacodynamic 
evaluation was performed with focus on  
• Macroscopic assessment – second-look arthroscopy  
• Histological, immunohistochemical assessment – biopsy of regenerated cartilage  
• MRI assessment – Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) evaluation.  
Histological  and  immunohistochemical  staining  of  biopsies  allow  for  assessment  of  chondrogenesis,  repair 
tissue formation and contaminating cell types. 
In  the  Phase  II  study  cod  16HS14,  MRI  together  with  the  MOCART  scoring  was  performed  13  weeks  (3 
months) and 12 months after implantation followed (or to be followed) by additional such assessments after 
18,  24,  36,  48  and  60  months.  Twelve  months  after  implantation,  an  arthroscopy  was  conducted  and  a 
CHMP assessment report

biopsy (R-Biopsy) and histological analyses of the regenerated cartilage tissue was taken from the subset of 
patients who consented to this, in order to evaluate cartilage formation and repair as well as to investigate 
the  expression  of  markers  for  chondrocyte  differentiation.  In  addition,  potential  markers  for  different  cell 
types (synoviocytes, bone, fat) were investigated to determine the purity of the regenerated tissue. Second-
look  arthroscopy  with  R-biopsy  was  optional,  and  R-biopsies  from  8  patients  were  obtained.  Assessment  of 
second-look arthroscopy was performed by the treating physician. Assessment of R-biopsies was performed 
by an independent, blinded pathologist. 
In the Phase III study, similar to the Phase II study, MOCART (MRI Score) was (and is to be) obtained at 3, 
12,  24,  36,  48  and  60  months  after  implantation  or  microfracture  and  also  includes  the  obtaining  of  ICRS 
visual histological assessment scores at 24 months (following a second-look arthroscopy and biopsy taking in 
consenting  patients),  Bern  score,  and  additional  histological  assessment  scores.  At  current, 
pharmacodynamic  assessments  by  MRI  and  MOCART  scoring  have  been  performed  in  the  Phase  II  clinical 
trial (cod 16 HS 14) for up to 3 years after Spherox implantation, and in the Phase III clinical trial (cod 16 HS 
13) for up to 1 year. 
Supportive  post-marketing  experience  from  control  arthroscopy  has  become  available  from  a  prospective 
case  series  with  41  patients  (Siebold  et  al,  2015),  a  prospective  case  series  with  23  patients  (Maiotti  et  al, 
2012)  and  a  retrospective  analysis  of  10  patients  (Baum,  2008).  Histological  and/or  immunohistochemical 
analyses were performed in the supportive study Maiotti et al (2012). Supporting post-marketing experience 
with MRI assessment is available from 4 retrospective studies initiated by the Applicant (cod 16 HS 16; cod 
16  HS  17  paed;  cod  RS1  SR;  cod  RS4  WZ)  and  several  publications,  Alevrogiannis  et  al  (2008);  Baum 
(2008); Fickert et al (2011); Maiotti et al (2012); Rössing et al (2010); Siebold et al (2015). 
MRI  assessment  with  MOCART  scoring:  In  the  Phase  II  and  Phase  III  clinical  trials,  an  improvement  in  the 
MOCART  score  from  3  to  12  months  was  observed.  In  the  Phase  II  study,  at  12  months  a  plateau  was 
reached, at a MOCART score of about 70–80 points (out of 100), and this has been sustained until the most 
recent follow-up visit 36 months after implantation. At 12, 18, 24 and 36 months no difference between any 
of the doses was observed. In the Phase III clinical trial, the MOCART score was respectively 67 and 62 for 
the  ACT3D-CS  and  MF  groups,  3  months  after  implantation,  improving  to  81  and  77  after  12  months.  MRI 
evaluation  with  MOCART  scoring  of  commercially  available  Spherox  (cod  RS1  SR  [2015];  cod  RS4  WZ 
[2014]) showed similar results compared to the clinical trials. 
In the investigator- initiated study by Fickert et al (2011) an improvement in MOCART score from 3 months 
to 12 months was reported. 
In adolescent patients (14 to 17 years of age) two investigations were performed; cod 16 HS 16 (2012) and 
cod 16 HS 17 paed (2016). The MOCART score up to 57 months after implantation (mean between 40 and 60 
points  at  all  visits)  in  adolescent  patients  in  the  study  cod  16  HS  16  (2012)  was  relatively  low.  This  have 
been  the  result  of  an  incomplete  assessment  of  individual  score  items  by  the  physicians,  according  to  the 
applicant. 
The mean MOCART score derived from the MRI results of the study cod 16 HS 17 paed (2016) was 74.7 ± 
12.0 in the follow-up period of 3.5 to 8 years (mean 63.3 months). 
Macroscopic assessment (second-look arthroscopy): Second-look arthroscopies in the pivotal Phase II clinical 
trial revealed in 7 out of 8 samples at least ‘nearly normal’ cartilage with ICRS-CRA. 
In  the  study  by  Siebold  et  al  (2015),  in  52  defects  (91%)  a  ‘normal’  or  ‘nearly  normal’  result  according  to 
ICRS CRA was found in second-look arthroscopy. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 40/125 
  
  
A  normal  appearance  of  regenerated  tissue  and  good  integration  was  also  found  in  studies  by  Maiotti  et  al 
(2012) (N = 3) and Baum (2008) (N = 9). 
Histological  and  immunohistochemical  assessment:  Histological  and  immunohistochemical  analyses  in  the 
Phase II clinical trial revealed hyaline cartilage characteristics (N = 7 patients). The overall mean Bern score 
was  6.4  ±  2.8  (on  a  scale  from  0-9),  which  indicates  successful  growth  and  development  of  cartilage  cells 
from  the  implant  and  production  of  hyaline-like  ECM.  The  presence  of  most  of  the  hyaline-cartilage-specific 
proteins  was  observed  in  all  repair  tissues,  with  varying  expression  levels  however.  In  5  patients  collagen 
type II were found. Proteoglycans were present in all samples, as shown by the Alcian Blue staining and by 
the  presence  of  aggrecan.  However,  none  of  the  samples  showed  strong  expression  of  all  markers.  This 
suggested  that  all  repair  tissues  displayed  hyaline  cartilage  characteristics  to  some  extent,  but  that  no 
sample displayed a true hyaline cartilage phenotype. 
Maiotti et al (2012) reported hyaline cartilage in all cases (N = 3). However, details of the type of analyses 
and the assessments for this finding are not available from the authors. 
The results from these assessments are discussed in details by study in section 2.5. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  applicant  discussed  the  relevance  of  the  pharmacodynamic  parameters  evaluated  in  their  studies 
initiated and those described in publications related to Spherox. 
A second-look arthroscopy allows a macroscopic assessment of defect repair and integration of the autograft 
into  adjacent  cartilage.  However,  since  arthroscopy  and  procurement  of  biopsy  are  of  invasive  nature, 
magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  has  become  the  most  important  tool  for  the  follow  up  of  patients  with 
chondral autografts. MRI is currently the standard method for cartilage evaluation, as it allows morphological 
assessment of the cartilage surface, thickness, volume and subchondral bone. MRI is therefore ideal for the 
evaluation  of  the  morphological  status  of  cartilage  defects  and  the  repair  tissue  throughout  the  post-
operative period. The MOCART scoring system was designed to record systematically only those observations 
that  can  be  most  accurately  and  reproducibly  determined.  The  MOCART  scale  runs  from  0  (worst  possible 
case) to 100 points (normal). 
There are nine criteria that are evaluated in the MOCART rating system and result in a maximum score of 100 
points for a theoretical perfect repair tissue equivalent to native cartilage: 
1. Degree of defect repair and filling of defect: Thickness of repair tissue (0–20 points) 
2. Extent of integration to border zone: Visibility of defect zone resp. graft margins (0–15 points) 
3. Surface of repair tissue: Amount of damages, e.g. fibrillations, fissures, ulcerations (0–10 points) 
4. Structure of repair tissue: Homogeneity (0–5 points) 
5. Signal intensity of repair tissue: Intensity of Dual T2-FSE and 3D-GE-FS (0–15 points each) 
6. Condition of subchondral lamina: Intactness (0–5 points) 
7. Condition of subchondral bone: Intactness, alterations (0–5 points) 
8. Presence of adhesions (0–5 points) 
9. Presence of effusions (0–5 points)

The  MOCART  scoring  system  is  considered  a  valid  and  reliable  tool  assessing  cartilage  repair  although  the 
level  of  correlation  between  MOCART  score  and  clinical  outcome  has  not  been  fully  clarified  with  a  defined 
need  for  more  high-quality  prospective  studies  of  imaging  and  clinical  outcomes  (de  Windt  TS,  et  al.  Am  J 
Sports  Med.  2013;,41:1695-1702,  and  comment  by  Blackman  AJ,  et  all  [letter  to  the  Editor,  Am  J  Sports 
Med. 2013;41: NP49-50]).  
To specifically evaluate the quality of repair tissue in patient biopsies, the Histological Endpoint Committee of 
the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) developed a Visual Assessment Histological Scale in 2003. It 
is  used  to  assess  the  quality  of  the  regenerated  tissue  and  the  extent  to  which  its  characteristics  resemble 
those of native hyaline cartilage. It assesses 6 components of repair, including surface architecture, matrix, 
cell distribution, cell population viability, subchondral bone, and abnormal cartilage mineralization. The ICRS I 
system uses discrete integer scores (0-3) to describe a continuum of tissue features in heterogeneous tissues 
and has shown low interreader agreement (Hoemann et al, Cartilage. 2011;2[2]:153-72).  
The  ICRS  II  scoring  system  addresses  various  aspects  of  cartilage  repair  and  has  been  developed  and 
validated by the Histology Working Group of the ICRS. ICRS  II  uses a continuous visual analog scale (VAS) 
and  14  criteria  to  assess  parameters  related  to  chondrocyte  phenotype  and  tissue  structure.  It  was  first 
applied  clinically  in  a  large  prospective  randomized  trial  in  which  the  clinical  and  histological  results  of 
microfracture  and  ACI  were  compared  (Saris  DB  et  al,  Am  J  Sports  Med.  2008;36:235-46).  In  a  recent 
review,  it  was  concluded  that,  of  the  various  scores  available  for  analysis  of  in  vivo  repaired  cartilage,  the 
ICRS II score seems (the most) suitable, being validated and comprehensive (Rutgers M, et al. Osteoarthritis 
Cartilage. 2010;18[1]:12-23). 
In addition, the Bern scoring system was applied to assess the formation of repair tissue. This scoring system 
utilizes 3 categories of scoring, namely uniformity and darkness of cartilage ECM staining by Safranin O which 
stains  proteoglycans  (maximum  score  of  3);  the  amount  of  matrix  present  between  the  cells  (maximum 
score  of  3);  and  cellular  morphology  (maximum  score  of  3).  A  maximum  score  of  9  can  be  obtained which 
would  reflect  mature  hyaline  cartilage.  The  score  has  been  validated  for  assessment  of  pellet-cultured  (in 
vitro  generated)  neocartilage  and  showed  good  correlation  of  cartilage  quality  with  glycosaminoglycan 
content (Grogan SP et al, Tissue Eng. 2006;12:2141-9) and can be used for evaluation of in vitro engineered 
cartilage (Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2010;18(1):12-23). 
Altogether,  the  pharmacodynamics  assessments  obtained  and  planned  for  the  Phase  II  and  III  studies  are 
consistent with the recommendations in the CAT/CHMP Reflection Paper. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Phase  II  (cod  16  HS  14)  and  Phase  III  (cod  16  HS  13)  clinical  studies  provided  some  evidence  on  hyaline 
forming  or  hyaline  regeneration  as  well  as  defect  fill  based  on  histology.  In  addition,  MRI  data  have  been 
provided  that  suggest  chondral  repair  as  assessed  by  MOCART  scoring  up  to 36  months  after treatment. In 
the  Phase  III  clinical  trial  no  notable  differences  in  MRI-based  outcome  were  found  between  ACT  and 
microfracture  up  to  12  months  follow-up.  Results  from  second-look  arthroscopy  and  histological  and 
immunohistochemical assessment of R-biopsies (24-month follow-up) are not available yet, but will provided 
in post-marketing reporting.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The pivotal programme comprises of two clinical trials, namely Phase II (cod 16 HS 14) and Phase III (cod 16 
HS 13). These studies were conducted in parallel, with mutually exclusive study populations based on defect 
size. 
Supportive data for the knee trial results comprise of four retrospective data collections initiated by 
CO.DONAG (cod RS1 SR; cod RS2 RS; cod RS3 TS; cod RS4 WZ), six prospective investigator-initiated 
studies by Maiotti et al (2012), Fickert et al (2011), Rössing et al (2010), Alevrogiannis et al (2008), 
Schreyer et al (2006) (follow-up: Schreyer (2010) and two retrospective data collections, Ruhnau (2008), 
Baum (2008). Furthermore, two clinical investigations in adolescent patients have been conducted (cod 16 
HS 16; cod 16 HS 17 paed). Supportive data for the hip were published by Körsmeier et al (2012) and follow-
up: Körsmeier et al (2014) and Fickert et al (2014). 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The aim is to engraft on average 30 spheroids per cm2 defect (acceptable range 10 - 70 spheroids per cm2 
defect).  According to the applicant, the dose is calculated by the following steps until final estimation of the 
dose (defined as spheroids per cm2 defect): 
1.  Estimation and documentation of the defect size during surgery for biopsy acquisition; 
2.  Calculation  of  the  minimal  spheroid  number  necessary  and  assessment  of  actual  producible 
spheroids/cm2 defect at the time of seeding of cells for spheroid formation; 
3.  Final  assessment  of  spheroids  production  and  calculation  of  dose  (between  10–70/cm2  defect)  at 
release. 
Dose  response  was  evaluated in  the  phase  II  study,  which  was  the  pivotal  trial  for  defects of  the  4-10 cm2 
size.  The  trial  is  described  in  detail  in  the  section  2.5.2.  Thus,  the  release  specification  for  the  finished 
product Spherox applies to the number of spheroids per cm2 defect and not to a specified number of cells per 
cm2 defect. The dose used in clinical practice since market entry (2004) is 10–70 spheroids/cm2 defect.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Phase II study Cod 16 HS 14 
Study  cod  16  HS14  is  an  ongoing  prospective,  randomised,  open  label,  multicentre  phase  II  clinical  trial  to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of the treatment of large cartilage defects (defect sizes between 4 and 10 
cm²) with 3 different doses of the ACT product Spherox in subjects with cartilage defects of the knee.  
Methods 
After implantation surgery, patients were recalled for assessments after 6 weeks, 13 weeks (3 months), 26 
weeks (6 months), with final assessment after 12 months. Additional follow-up assessments have taken place 
after 18 months, 24 months and 36 months (the cut-off point for the present response submission). Future 
follow-up assessments will take place after 48 and 60 months, respectively.

haemochromatosis,  Wilson's  disease,  primary  osteochondromatosis,  heritable  disorders,  collagen 
gene mutation 
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  considered  acceptable.  There  was  no  grading  of  KOOS  (the  primary 
outcome variable) at screening. This might have been useful to further characterize the study population. 
Treatments 
The principle of the ACT3D is based on the arthroscopic harvesting of the patient’s own chondrocytes isolated 
from healthy cartilage which are cultivated in vitro to develop 3-dimensional spheroids (ACT3D-CS) that are 
subsequently transplanted into the cartilage defect. The following doses were administered: low-dose group: 
3–7 spheroids/cm2; medium-dose group: 10–30 spheroids/cm2; high-dose group: 40–70 spheroids/cm2. The 
dose  used  in  clinical  practice  since  market  entry  (2004)  is  10–70  spheroids/cm2  defect.  Therefore,  one 
patient group received 10–30 spheroids/cm2 and the second group 40–70 spheroids/cm2 defect.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 45/125 
  
  
The applicant was requested to justify the choice of the lowest proposed dose of 3-7 spheroids/cm2.  It  was 
based  on  ethical  considerations  to  choose  a  potential  ‘minimum  effective  dose’  of  3–7  spheroids/cm2  as 
suboptimal levels may lead to incomplete defect filling with risk of progression to osteoarthritis. Furthermore, 
according  to  the  applicant,  the  use  of  the  gaps  between  the  different  dose-groups  should  ensure 
discrimination  of  the  clinical  outcome  between  the  different  dose  groups.  After  surgery,  the  patient 
underwent a strict rehabilitation programme that already started during his/her stay in the clinic, and which 
continued  at  home  for  up to three  months  after  the  intervention.  On  the  day of  discharge  from  hospital,  at 
Visit  1  (after  6  weeks)  and  at  Visit  2  (after  13  weeks),  the  investigator  assessed  the  conduct  of  the 
rehabilitation programme up to the respective time point and recorded his/ her assessment in the eCRF. 
Patients were to agree to use only paracetamol mono- (max 4 g/day) or combination preparations and oral 
and/or  topic  NSAIDs  during  the  trial  and  to  discontinue  the  use  of  oral  and/or  topic  NSAIDs  and/or 
paracetamol  combination  preparation  1  week  before  each  visit  whereas  the  use  of  paracetamol  mono-
preparation  (max  4  g/day)  is  allowed.  However,  in  the  morning  of  the  visit  day,  no  pain  medication  was 
allowed. Other pain medications were allowed during the surgical procedure and could be taken for a period 
not  exceeding  4  weeks  after  surgery.  Patients  were  to  record  all  prescribed  medication  in  their  patient’s 
diary. 
Objectives 
The  overall  objective  of  the  study  was  to  confirm  the  clinical  efficacy  of  the  Spherox  treatment,  using  the 
patient  reported  KOOS  [and  other  scores  for  functionality,  and  its  structural  outcome  (measured  with  MRI 
and structural scores) using a dose range of 10–70 spheroids/cm2. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary  efficacy  variable: Change  of  overall  KOOS  from  baseline  (Day  0)  to  final  assessment  at  Visit  4  (12 
months after implantation), determined for each dose group and between the dose groups (ITT population). 
KOOS  is  a  42-item,  self-administered,  self-explanatory  questionnaire    that  covers  five  patient-relevant 
dimensions:  Pain,  Other  symptoms,  Function  in  daily  living  (ADL),  Function  in  sport  and  recreation 
(Sport/Rec),  and  Knee-related  quality  of  life  (QoL).  Scores  are  then  transferred  to  a  0-100  scale  (100 
indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) which is then calculated for each subscale. The 
overall  KOOS  score  is  determined  by  averaging  transformed  subscores.  As  a  patient-reported  outcome 
measure, KOOS is considered an appropriate and validated scoring system to assess improvement of function 
and  pain  in  patients  with  cartilaginous  defects  and  in  principle  an  acceptable  primary  endpoint  to  show 
improvement of symptoms.  
Secondary endpoints: 
•  Change  of  overall  KOOS  from  baseline  (Day  0)  to  24,  36,  48  and  60  months  (follow-up,  FU)  after 
implantation, determined for each dose group. 
•  Change  of  overall  KOOS  from  baseline  (Day  0)  to  24,  36,  48  and  60  months  (follow-up,  FU)  after 
implantation, compared between the dose groups. 
•  Change of overall KOOS from Day 0' (pre-implantation day) to 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months (follow-
up, FU) after implantation, determined for each dose group and compared between the dose groups. 
•  Change of the five subscores of the KOOS (from baseline (Day 0, the pre-arthroscopy day) as well as 
from  Day  0'  (pre-implantation  day)  to  12,  24,  36,  48  and  60  months  (follow-up,  FU)  after 
implantation, determined for each dose group and between the dose groups.

Sample size 
The  sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  showing  differences  between  12  months  and  baseline  (within 
treatment group). No comparisons between treatment groups were taken into account. 12.5 is considered a 
clinically  relevant  difference  in  standardised  KOOS  score.  75  patients  were  planned  to  be  included,  25  per 
treatment group. 
Randomisation and blinding  
Randomisation  was  performed  via  a  central  IVRS.  Patients  were  stratified  prospectively  by  defect  size  into 
two  classes  (4  cm2  up  to  but  not  including  7  cm2  and  7–10  cm2).  As  the  study  was  open-label,  the 
investigators were not blinded. However, the patients were blinded to their spheroid dose level. The blinding 
of the patients was maintained up to the final assessment and during the remaining follow-up period. 
All  clinical  assessments  were  performed  by  independent  evaluators  at  each  site.  An  independent  central 
radiologist  (“blinded  reader”)  assessed  all  MRI  pictures  after  study  intervention  without  knowledge  of  which 
dose  had  been  applied  or  of  the  time  point  (of  patient  participation  in  the  trial)  at  which  the  image  was 
obtained. An independent central, blinded pathologist assessed the cartilage biopsies, taken from patients of 
all three groups after 12 months, for the evaluation of (i) the extent of cartilage repair, (ii) any indication of 
migration  of  the  implanted  spheroids,  and  (iii)  the  protein  expression  of  chondrocyte-specific  markers.  The 
sections  were  evaluated,  at  the  same  time,  after  the  last  biopsy  had  been  taken.  The  pathologist  was  to 
perform  his  assessments  without  knowledge  of  which  dose  level  had  been  administered  to  the  individual 
patient. The original study protocol and protocol amendment 1.7 state that there were to be 2 pathologists; 
each  was  to  make  an  independent  assessment  of  the  same  sections.  However,  this  approach  of  using  2 
pathologists  was  abandoned  due  to  difficulties  in  identifying  two  independent  expert  pathologists  from 
independent  institutes.  Nevertheless,  preparation  of  histological  specimen  and  staining  of  sections  were 
performed  by  a  separate  independent  institute  of  pathology  and  sections  were  transferred  to  the  expert 
pathologist.

Statistical methods 
For sample size estimation, a sample size of at least 25 patients was planned. The principle of testing ordered 
hypotheses was applied with respect to KOOS. Prospective evaluation of superiority comprised two steps, in 
series: 
• 
Test  for  superiority  against  baseline  for  the  three  dose  groups  (first  the  highest,  then  the  second 
highest, then the lowest), using the paired t test procedure; and 
•  Comparison of the three dose groups with one another. 
No  adjustment  for  multiple  testing  was  made.  The  final  evaluation  of  superiority  was  performed  after  12 
months (FA) – that is, 12 months after the last patient had received study treatment. Exploratory follow-up 
statistical evaluations will be carried out additionally after 24, 36, 48 and 60 months. Thus, while differences 
between treatment groups were evaluated, they were not the basis for sample size calculations. 
Results 
Participant flow 
This trial is conducted at 10 sites (orthopaedic clinics) in Germany. A total of 163 patients were screened. Of 
these, 75 patients were eligible for inclusion in this study. Twenty-five patients each were randomized to the 
low  dose  group  (3–7  spheroids/cm2):  the  medium  dose  group  (10–30  spheroids/cm2);  and  the  high  dose 
group (40–70 spheroids/cm2), respectively. 
The ITT population included 73 patients. Two patients did not receive a transplant and were included in the 
safety  population only.  Seven  patients  withdrew,  or were  withdrawn  prematurely  from the  study  during  the 
first 12 months: 2 in the low-dose group, none in the medium-dose group and 5 in the high-dose group. Up 
to the present 3-year follow-up window, 16 patients withdrew, or were withdrawn prematurely: 6 in the low-
dose group, 1 in the medium-dose group and 9 in the high-dose group. In total, major protocol violations led 
to  exclusion  of  22  patients  from  the  PP  population  during  the  initial  year  of  the  study  (12  months  after 
transplantation). The majority of these patients (14 of the 22) were high-dose patients. In 11 of these cases, 
the high dose was not fully achieved as planned. On the other hand, 6 patients received a higher than ‘low’ 
dose  (see  table  below).  In  each  case,  the  reason  was  either  the  fact  that  the  chondrocyte  culture  did  not 
generate the required number of spheroids or that the assessment of the actual defect size (measured at the 
time  of  implantation)  had  not  been  sufficiently  accurate.  A  further  patient  (low-dose  group)  was  wrongly 
included  (defect  too  small)  and  subsequently  received  too  high  a  dose.  The  issue  of  the  deviation  from  the 
randomised  treatment  was  approached  by  performing  an  ancillary  efficacy  analysis  based  upon  re-grouping 
of the patients according to the actual dose administered.

Recruitment 
The study included patients from orthopaedic clinics in Germany (75 patients). 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was issued on 8th July 2010. Four protocol amendments were implemented. An updated 
Statistical  Analysis  Plan  (SAP)  was  issued  on  23rd  November  2015.  Most  of  the  protocol  changes  were  of 
practical and/or administrative nature with no significant impact on study outcome. Also, additional analysis 
of  subgroups  and  covariates  was  introduced:  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  to  be 
investigated for the following prospectively defined subgroups and covariates in the analysis; the subgroup: 
patients with compliance in terms of postoperative rehabilitation; the covariates: age of patients, orthopaedic 
clinics.  Amendment  3  introduced  a  change  in  definitions  for  documenting  AEs  which  appears  to  have 
pertained  to  a  restriction  of  what  events  would  be  reported  as  an  AE.  However,  this  change  was  never 
implemented, i.e. AEs were reported as appropriate. 
Baseline data 
The  analysis  population  (safety  population)  comprised  75  patients  (22  women,  53  men)  aged  34  ±  9 years 
(19  to  48  years).  All  but  two  of  the  study  patients  were  Caucasian  (73  patients,  97%);  There  was  an 
imbalance with respect of smoking, with roughly equal numbers of smokers and nonsmokers in the low-dose 
group but a minority of smokers (less than 1 in 4) in the two other dose groups. Thirteen of 25 patients in 
the  low-dose  group,  18/25  in  the  medium-dose  group  and  15/25  in  the  high-dose  group  were  recorded  as 
having concomitant illnesses at screening. The distribution did not substantially differ between the groups.  
Medication  before  the  study  was  recorded  for  36  (48%)  of  the  patients  overall  and  with  slightly  different 
frequencies  in  the  three  dose  groups  (low  dose,  60%;  medium  dose  36%;  high  dose  48%;  numbers  of 
medications taken were unremarkable and were approximately balanced across the treatment groups. Defect 
sizes  ranged  from  2  to  10  cm2.  The  average  defect  size  at  arthroscopy  was  5.0  ±  1.9  cm  across  all  dose 
groups.  The  average  defect  size  as  seen  at  the  time  of  implantation  was  5.6  ±  1.6  cm.  The  waiting  times 
between the pre-arthroscopy day and the pre-implantation day were similar between the dose groups. For all 
groups combined, this was 53 ± 10 days. Primary defects located on patella or femur were treated; the tibia 
was not represented. Type and grading of defect are summarised in the tables below. Primary (study) defects 
were mostly (47/75; 63%) of the patella, the rest (28/75; 37%) being of the femur; no primary defect was 
of the tibia. ICRS grades were mostly III C or IV A, and were fairly evenly distributed between the groups.

Numbers analysed 
The study allowed a wider range of primary defect locations. The primary defect was either the patella (47/75 
patients, 63%), medial condyle (24/75 patients, 32%) or lateral condyle (4/75 patients, 5%). Tibia plateau 
lesions were not included. The cause or reason for developing a cartilage defect was in most cases ‘trauma’ 
followed by ‘other’. In the study, of the 75 patients, 37 had a traumatic cartilage lesion and 24 had ‘other’, as 
compared  to  7  with  OD  and  7  with  OA,  respectively.  The  applicant  was  requested  to  further  specify  the 
diagnosis  subgroup  ‘other’  to  obtain  more  clarity  on  the  origin  of  the  defect.  The  rationale  for  using  the 
category  ‘other’  was  to  stay  in  line  with  the  validated  forms  of  the  International  Cartilage  Repair  Society 
(ICRS) Cartilage Injury Evaluation Package. In few cases, ‘overloading’ was assumed by investigators but in 
most cases, the reasons were unknown and no further specifics were captured. No bias is assumed to have 
been caused by the use of this subgroup however.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary  endpoints:  The  primary  variable  was  the  overall  KOOS,  calculated  for  the  ITT  population  by 
averaging the normalised sub-scores. The primary analysis was that of the primary variable 12 months after 
implantation; the hierarchical statistical testing yielded the following results: 
•  Step 1, comparison between Visit 4 and baseline for the high-dose group: p = 0.0005 
•  Step 2, comparison between Visit 4 and baseline for the medium-dose group: p < 0.0001 
•  Step 3, comparison between Visit 4 and baseline for the low-dose group: p = 0.0002 
•  Step 4, between-group comparison:   
High vs. medium dose: p = 0.7160 
Medium vs. low dose: p = 0.9693 
High vs. low dose: p = 0.6933 
Overall KOOS up to 12 months after transplantation (ITT population) 
The time course of the overall KOOS changes was similar for the 3 dose groups although the high-dose group 
showed  numerically  the  smallest  improvement  from  baseline.  Overall,  the  data  showed  a  clinically  relevant 
and sustained improvement in KOOS. Since all patients underwent a strict rehabilitation after transplantation 
CHMP assessment report

and  given  the  absence  of  dose-response,  as  well  as  the  absence  of  a  comparator  arm  in  this  study,  the 
applicant was requested to further discuss the impact of the rehabilitation program on the primary outcome. 
The  standardised  rehabilitation  period  lasted  only  3  months  with  additional  instructions  beyond  this  time 
period left  at the  discretion  of  the investigator.  A  review  of  the  current  literature  indicates  a lack  of  studies 
with  regard  to  later  stages  of  rehabilitation  (after  the  early  postoperative  period),  how  this  should  be 
optimized,  and  the  need  to  investigate  the  effect  of  an  ongoing  or  midterm  (1-2  years)  rehabilitation 
intervention.  It  could  be  considered  that  a  longer  standardised  rehabilitation  and  the  use  of  a  control  arm 
(e.g. rehabilitation with allowance of pain medication for a limited period of time) in the Phase II study would 
have  been  desirable  from  a  methodological  perspective  to  better  contextualize  the  effects  of  rehabilitation 
and  pain  medication  although  this  should  be  weighed  against  other  concerns  e.g.  in  terms  of  postponing 
surgical intervention in patients with large cartilage lesions. 
Secondary endpoints: Following the primary analysis, in the next 12 months the improvement in the primary 
variable ‘overall KOOS’ continued in the low-dose and medium-dose groups, while levelling off slightly in the 
high-dose  group.  The  assessment  of  the  primary  variable  ‘overall  KOOS’  for  the  ITT  population  showed  a 
statistically significant improvement, as compared with baseline, in all 3 within-group analyses (for the high-, 
medium-  and  low-dose  group  respectively)  one  year  after  study  treatment  (see  above  under  primary 
analysis), similarly: p 0.0002, <0.0001 and 0.0054 respectively, after two years and without further notable 
change after three years (p<0.0001, <0.0001, and 0.0003).

Overall KOOS up to 36 months – changes from baseline (ITT population) 
KOOS  subscores:  All  KOOS  subscores  showed  some  improvement;  these  improvements  ranged  from 
approximately 10 percentage points to approximately 25 percentage points. This was observed about equally 
for  all  dose  groups,  without  a  discernible  relationship  between  dose  and  effect.  The  strongest  mean 
improvements  compared  with  baseline  (ITT  overall)  were  seen  for  ‘knee-related  quality  of  life’  (22.3 
percentage  points)  and  ‘function  in  sport  and  recreation’  (17.0  percentage  points).  The  significance  testing 
performed  for  the  primary  analysis  was  repeated  for  each  of  the  KOOS  subscores  for  each  visit.  All  of  the 
within-group  comparisons  (Visit  4,  Visit  6  or  Visit  7  against  baseline)  gave  p  values  below  0.05,  with  the 
single  exception  of  ‘sport  and  recreation’  for  the  high-dose  group  at  Visit  6  only  (p  =  0.1285,  t  test).  In 
contrast, all of the between-group comparisons gave p values that were above 0.05. 
Change in KOOS from Day 0’ (pre-implantation day): Using a different reference point as ‘baseline’, namely 
the day prior to implantation (Day 0’), changes in overall KOOS with respect to Day 0' did not differ to any 
relevant  extent  with  respect  to  baseline.  The  significance  testing  performed  for  the  primary  analysis  was 
repeated  for  each  of  the  KOOS  subscores.  All  of  the  within-group  comparisons  (Visit  4  against  baseline,  or 
Visit 4 against Day 0') gave p values below 0.05. 
MOCART scores: The mean MOCART total scores – on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) – at Visit 2 were 
59.8,  64.5  and  64.7  for  the  low-dose,  medium-dose  and  high-  dose  group  respectively,  and  62.9  for  ‘all 
patients’; at Visit 4 these were 74.1, 74.5 and 68.8 for the respective dose groups and 72.4 for ‘all patients. 
At Visits 5, 6 and 7 (18, 24 and 36 months after study treatment) the improvement was maintained. Modest 
improvements  in  MOCART  score  from  Visit  2  onward  were  observed  with  no  evidence  of  a  dose-response. 
Also,  the  absence  of  a  baseline  measurement  precluded  a  within-group  comparison  from  baseline.  In  a 
between-group ANOVA for Visits 4 (12 months), 6 (24 months) and 7 (36 months), no statistically significant 
results were obtained (i.e. all p values were >0.05).  
In the study report, it was stated: ‘the baseline score can be regarded as having been the worst possible or 
close  to  it’  (i.e.  close  to  zero).  Further  justification  was  requested  for  this  statement  as  no  assessment  of 
MOCART  was  actually  obtained  before  the  start  of  the  Phase  II  study  (or  the  Phase  III  study).  In  the 
literature,  for  example,  in  a  recent  study  using  MACI  in  21  patients  with  symptomatic,  traumatic  chondral 
defects  (Marlovits  et  al,  Am  J  Sports  Med.  2012),  the  quality  of  repair  tissue  was  assessed  by  magnetic 
resonance imaging using the MOCART score at baseline as well as at months 3 and 6 and years 1, 2, and 5. 
In  this  case  series,  the  mean  defect  size  was  5.1  cm2  (range,  2.4-9.9  cm2) and  the  baseline  MOCART  was 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 53/125 
 
  
  
52.9 ± 12.5. It was sufficiently clarified that no comparisons to baseline were made and could be made; the 
statistical  analysis  were  solely  performed  using  the  available  MOCART  scores  after  treatment,  with  the 
starting  point  at  3  months  up  to  36  months  follow-up.  Some  overall  MOCART  scores  were  missing  as 
exemplified  by  the  table  below.  This  related  to  the  fact  that  the  overall  score  is  a  composition  based  on  9 
items and the overall value could only be obtained in patients for whom all items were evaluated, which was 
not always the case. The missing scores were caused to large extent by the missing item 5b, as the required 
MRI  sequence  for  this  item  was  not  conducted  by  some  radiologists.  However,  the  Applicant  provided  a 
rationale  for  the  missing data,  as  well  as  a  comparative  assessment of  the  scores  for  the 8/9 items  for  the 
patients not included due to missing item 5b as compared to the patients with complete data which did not 
demonstrate  a  selection  bias.  Additional  MOCART  data  will  be  forthcoming  with  the  submission  of  future 
follow-up data.   
The  correlation  between  KOOS  and  MOCART  results  was  investigated  by  calculating  Spearman's  correlation 
coefficient for all patients for whom both KOOS and MOCART results were available. A dose-dependence of a 
better  subjective  or  functional  outcome  in  correlation  with  an  increase  in  the  structural  parameters  of  the 
MOCART score could not be observed. This lack of correlation between clinical and radiological outcomes after 
surgical  interventions  for  cartilage  is  consistent  with  the  published  literature.  The  reasons  for  this  are  likely 
multifactorial but are currently insufficiently understood.

Arthroscopic  assessment  of    cartilage  repair  (according  to  ICRS):  Visual  assessment  of  repair  according  to 
ICRS was done at Visit 4 for those patients (8) who consented to the additional arthroscopy and regenerated 
tissue  biopsy.  For  two  patients  (high-dose  group),  their  cartilage  was  assessed  as  ‘normal’,  five  (medium- 
and  low-dose  groups)  as  ‘nearly  normal’  and  one  (low-dose  group)  as  ‘abnormal’.  None  were  rated  as 
‘severely abnormal’. 
ICRS  visual  histological  assessment:  Eight  patients  (3  with  femoral  condyle  lesions,  5  with  retropatellar 
lesions)  consented  to  a  biopsy  of  the  regenerated  tissue  (R-biopsy)  in  conjunction  with  a  second-look 
arthroscopy.  The  ICRS  visual  histological  assessment  scale  allows  the  assessment  of  the  quality  of  the 
regenerated tissue and the extent to which its characteristics resemble those of native hyaline cartilage. This 
scoring  system  assesses  6  components  of  repair  in histology  sections  (surface,  matrix,  cell  distribution,  cell 
population  viability,  subchondral  bone,  and  cartilage  mineralisation)  (no  assessment  of  subchondral  bone 
could  be  performed  in  the  current  study).  Biopsy  specimens  could  be  analysed  for  7  patients  (see  table 
below). The repair tissue in almost all R-biopsies showed a normal presence of predominantly viable cells (6 
of 7 patients) and a normal cartilage mineralization (5 of 6 patients), obtaining the maximum score for these 
2  features.  For  the  other  features  describing  the  histological  appearance  of  the  repair  tissue,  a  larger 
variability  was  observed  between  the  different  patients.  The  majority  of  the  R-biopsies  (3  of  5  patients) 
showed  a  smooth  cartilage  surface,  whereas  the  remaining  2  patients  showed  an  irregular  surface.  For  the 
remaining features, cellular distribution and type of extracellular matrix (ECM), the patients were divided in 3 
groups, of approximately 1/3 showing a high score, 1/3 a middle score and 1/3 a low score. 
Individual ICRS histological assessments 
The overall results indicate that the cell transplant resulted in the generation of a cartilage repair tissue that 
varied from good to low quality but the number of biopsies was very limited. The biopsy samples were mainly 
from  retropatellar  site  and  only  three  samples  were  from  weight-bearing  joint.  Overall,  the  number  of 
samples for histology is too small and exposed to selection bias to draw firm conclusions on cartilage quality. 
Bern Score and histological and immunohistochemical staining of chondrogenic markers: The Bern score was 
originally developed as a histological grading system for assessment of neocartilage generated in vitro, based 
on Safranin O staining. A maximum score of 9 can be obtained which would reflect mature hyaline cartilage. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 55/125 
 
  
  
The overall mean Bern score (based on 7 biopsies) was 6.4 ± 2.8. The value of 6.4 (on a scale from 0 to 9), 
indicates successful growth and development of cartilage cells from the implant and production of hyaline-like 
ECM, resulting in the formation of repair tissue displaying hyaline cartilage characteristics. As expected from 
the very small numbers of patients, between-group statistical tests did not reveal any trend. A large variation 
in  the  different  patient  samples  was  observed,  with  the  repair  tissues  showing  varying  characteristics. 
However,  the  presence  of  most  of  the  hyaline  cartilage-specific  proteins  was  observed  in  all  repair  tissues, 
with  varying  expression  levels.  Proteoglycans  were  present  in  all  samples,  as  shown  by  the  Alcian  Blue 
staining  and  the  presence  of  aggrecan.  In  addition,  the  chondrogenic  marker  proteins  COMP,  S100B  and 
DLK1/PREF-1  were  present  in  all  samples  analyzed,  whereas  CRTAC1  was  absent  in  only  one  sample. 
However, none of the samples showed strong expression of all markers. This suggested that all repair tissues 
displayed  hyaline  cartilage  characteristics  to  some  extent,  but  that  no  sample  displayed  a  true  hyaline 
cartilage phenotype. 
ICRS II histological scoring: Assessment was performed according to the ICRS II histological scoring. Overall, 
the overall ICRS histological score at Visit 4 was 46 ± 29 (out of maximum of 100 for healthy cartilage), with 
a median value of 60 and a range from 10 to 70. The number of patients available for this was limited to 7, 
and limited further due to missing subscores. 
ICRS/IKDC  Knee  examination  form  (surgeon’s  part)  –  overall  assessment:  The  overall  IKDC  score  was 
assessed in terms of the grades A–D, defined in “2000 IKDC Knee Examination Form” , where ‘A’ represents 
a good rating and ‘D’ a poor one. Baseline distributions between the dose groups were well comparable, as 
shown by a Kruskal–Wallace test (p = 0.3459). 
IKDC Knee Examination Form – overall assessment (ITT population) 
Within-group comparisons using Wilcoxon's signed-rank test gave statistically significant results, for the low-, 
medium- and high-dose groups respectively for almost all comparisons (from Day 0 to Visits 4, 6, and 7 for 
each dosage group, respectively and also from Day 0’ to Visits 4, 6, and 7 for each dosage group). 
IKDC  Subjective  Knee  Evaluation  Form  (patient’s  part):  The  2000  IKDC  Subjective  Knee  Evaluation  Form  is 
used  to  detect  improvement  or  deterioration  in  symptoms,  function,  and  sports  activities  due  to  knee 
impairment. The possible score range 0–100, where 100 = no limitation with daily or sporting activities and 
the  absence  of  symptoms.  Results  were  similar  for  as  for  the  physical  IKDC  knee  examination,  i.e. 
CHMP assessment report

statistically significant changes from baseline (both with respect to Day 0 baseline and Day 0’ baseline) for all 
dose groups with a lack of difference between the groups. 
Modified  Lysholm  Score:  The  Modified  Lysholm  Score  (used  as  a  self-complete  measure  in  surgical  studies 
involving  patients  with  chondral  damage)  allows  a  maximum  of  24  points  (the  higher  the  score,  the  better 
the  patient's  knee  condition).  Similar  to  the  IKDC  Subjective  Knee  Evaluation  Form,  there  were  clear 
potentially significant within-group differences (p < 0.05, descriptive level), but no systematic between-group 
effects. An MCID has not been defined for the modified Lysholm scale. 
Modified Lysholm Score – mean values (ITT population) 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup  analyses:  The  primary  analysis  (overall  KOOS  score)  was  repeated  for  the  patient  strata  ‘defect 
size 4–6.99 cm2’ in 63 ITT patients and ‘7–10 cm2’ in the remaining 10 ITT patients. Statistical significance 
for  overall  KOOS  score  was  reached  for  the  larger  stratum  (4–6.99  cm2),  but  not  for  the  smaller  one  with 
larger lesions (7– 10 cm2), as could be expected on the basis of the much smaller patient numbers (only 10) 
in the latter category. 
KOOS overall score was also analysed by the following categories: 
-Diagnosis: Traumatic cartilage lesion, osteochondritis dissecans, osteoarthritis (but without radiological signs 
of osteoarthritis, as these constituted an exclusion criterion), avascular necrosis (AVN) or other diagnoses  
-Defect location: Femur, tibia or patella (however, no patients with primary tibia lesions were enrolled) 
-Patient's age category: 18–34 years or 35–50 years  
-Patient's sex: Male / female 
In  general,  no  systematic  trends  that  might  have  reflected  underlying  differences  between  the  results  of 
treatment  at  the  follow-up  visits  (12,  24  and  36  months  after  implantation)  were  found.  The  applicant  was 
requested to further discuss the relevance of prior treatment of the cartilage defect on the outcome of second 
line  ACI.  For  example,  autologous  chondrocyte  implantation  after  failed  microfracturing  appears  to  be 
associated with a significantly higher failure rate and inferior clinical outcome when compared with ACI as a 
first-line treatment (Pestka JM, et al. Am J Sports Med. 2012:40[2]:325-31). However, it was confirmed that 
none of the patients in the Phase II study was subjected to prior treatment with microfracture. A comparison 
of  patients  with  previous  knee  surgeries  showed  a  lower  KOOS  value  at  baseline  than  patients  without 
previous surgeries. However, the 36 month follow up (Visit 7) for Phase II revealed a clear improvement by 
CHMP assessment report

20.6 KOOS points from baseline, similar to the 22.84 KOOS points in the group of patients without previous 
knee  surgery.  The  applicant  was  also  requested  to  discuss  the  treatment  benefit  in  the  femoral  cartilage 
lesion subgroup over the whole spectrum of the studied lesion size. In addition, in the high dose group, there 
were  fewer  patients  with  traumatic  lesion  and  more  patients  with  OD,  OA  or  other  diagnosis  included.  A 
descriptive  subgroup  analysis  was  provided,  which  showed  numerically  better  results  in  femur  lesions 
compared to patellar lesions and better response in traumatic lesions when compared to the overall response 
in  femur  lesions.  The  mean  improvement  in  KOOS  score  was  similar  between  lesion  size  strata  ≥4-<7  cm2 
and ≥7-10 cm2 in the ITT population. 
Supportive  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint:  The  primary  analysis  was  repeated  on  an  ‘observed  cases’ 
basis, i.e., with no imputation in the case of missing data. The results of the ‘observed cases’ analysis were 
consistent  with,  and  thus  supported,  those  of  the  primary  analysis.  Significance  levels  were,  as  is  to  be 
expected, somewhat weaker (greater p values) than in the primary analysis, but no p values exceeded 0.05 
that  had  not  done  so  in  the  primary  analysis.  The  within-group  and  between-group  PP  comparisons  were 
performed  as  for  the  ITT  population.  For  the  PP  analysis  of  the  overall  KOOS  score  –  analogous  to  the 
primary ITT efficacy analysis – the following results were obtained: 
Step 1, comparison between Visit 4 and baseline for the high-dose group: p = 0.6174 
Step 2, comparison between Visit 4 and baseline for the medium-dose group: p = 0.0015 
Step 3, comparison between Visit 4 and baseline for the low-dose group: p = 0.0033 
Step 4, between-group comparison,   high vs. medium dose: p = 0.2568 
medium vs. low dose: p = 0.6178 
high vs. low dose: p = 0.1560 
Thus, had the PP analysis been a formal hierarchical analysis, then it would have been terminated after the 
first  comparison  (step  1)  and  continued,  if  at  all,  at  a  descriptive  level.  The  second  and  third  comparisons 
(steps  2  and  3)  gave  p  values  below  the  significance  threshold.  As  already  found  for  the  ITT  analysis,  the 
difference  between  treatments  (step  4)  was  not  statistically  significant.  As  mentioned  early,  major  protocol 
violations affected in particular the patient numbers in the high-dose group based on a spheroid dose being 
given below the required range.  Based on this, the applicant conducted an analysis of the primary efficacy 
variable  by  dosage  group  (‘as  treated’)  (using  3-8.5  spheroids/cm2  [low  dose],  8.6-35  spheroids/cm2 
[median  dose]  and  35.1-70  speroids/cm2  [high  dose]  dose  levels  (see  cod  16  HS  14,  36-month  follow  up 
CSR): 
This  ‘as  treated’  analysis  yielded  similar  results  as  the  primary  ITT  analysis  (ie  significant  differences  from 
baseline at Visit 4 for all three dose groups with no differences between the groups). The applicant was asked 
to  further  evaluate  possible  tendencies  towards  a  dose  response  relationship  on  a  continuous  scale  if 
possible,  for  example,  using  actual  given  dose  for  each  patient  and  change  from  baseline  to  Month  12  in 
KOOS  for  each  patient  as  the  response.  The  applicant  provided  this  analysis  both  for  the  ITT  and  the  PP 
population. No evidence of a dose response relationship was present.

Phase III study Cod 16HS 13 
Study cod 16 HS 13 is an ongoing prospective, randomised, open label, multicentre Phase III clinical trial to 
compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  treatment  with  the  autologous  chondrocyte  transplantation  product 
Spherox (ACT3D-CS) with microfracture (MF) in subjects with cartilage defects of the knee with a defect size 
between 1 and 4 cm2. 
Methods 
After  transplantation  of  ACT3D-CS  (Group  A)  or  microfracture  (Group  B),  post-intervention  observational 
phases of 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 months (interim analysis (IA)), 18 months, 24 months (final assessment), 36, 48 
and 60 months (follow-up assessments) are planned for patients in both groups. 
Results are available from the Interim Analysis Report (12 months after treatment). 
Flowchart study cod 16 HS13 
The choice of comparator i.e. microfracture for this range of defect size has been agreed upon in a previous 
central  advice  procedure  (EMEA/H/SA/1146/1/FU/2009/SME/ADT/II)  and  is  also  suggested  as  an  option  in 
the  EMA  reflection  paper  on  chondrocytes  products  (EMA/CAT/CPWP/568181/2009).  Follow-up  times  were 
calculated from Day 0 for the microfracture group and Day 0’ for the ACT3D-CS group. This implicates that 
time from randomisation differed between the two treatment groups in this study. 
Study participants 
The included patient population consisted of male or female patients between 18 and 50 years of age; with 
isolated ICRS grade III or IV single defect on femoral condyle; defect size: 1 to < 4 cm2 after debridement to 
healthy  cartilage,  up  to  6  mm  in  depth;  nearly  intact  surrounding  chondral  structure  around  the  defect  as 
well  as  corresponding  joint  area.  To  qualify  for  inclusion,  patients  had  to  agree  to  adhere  to  strict 
rehabilitation protocol and follow-up programme and agree to adhere to rules regarding pain medication.

In  contrast  to  the  Phase  II  study  cod  16  HS  14,  patients  with  primary  defect  of  the  patella,  tibia  or  of  the 
trochlea alone were not included. The same exclusion criteria were used as in the Phase II study cod 16 HS 
14 except that patients with osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) were excluded in study cod 16 HS 13. 
Treatments 
Group A: ACT3D-CS. The dose was allowed to range from 10-70 spheroids/cm2. 
Group B: Microfracture (MF) 
The  technique  of  microfracture  was  performed  according  to  Steadman  et  al  (2003).  Microfracture  is  a 
marrow-stimulating  method  based  on  the  penetration  of  the  subchondral  bone  plate  at  the  bottom  of  the 
cartilage defect. Different instruments such as the bent awls used in microfracturing create persisting holes in 
the bone plate. The outflowing bone marrow blood contains the pluripotent stem cells (hMSC) which are able 
to differentiate mainly into fibrochondrocytes, resulting in fibrocartilage repair. 
Post-treatment rehabilitation programme 
Patients treated with ACT3D-CS: After surgery, the patient underwent a strict rehabilitation programme that 
already  started  during  his/her  stay  in  the  clinic,  and  which  continued  at  home  for  up  to  three  months  after 
the intervention. 
The  physical  therapists  were  instructed  by  the  investigators  to  follow  strictly  the  rehabilitation  programme. 
On  the  day  of  his/her  discharge  from  hospital,  the  patient  received  instructions  for  continuing  with  regular 
physical  exercise.  On  the  day  of  discharge  from  hospital,  at  Visit  1  (after  6  weeks)  and  at  Visit  2  (after  13 
weeks),  the  investigator  assessed  the  conduct  of  the  rehabilitation  programme  up  to  the  respective  time 
point and recorded his/ her assessment in the eCRF. 
Patients  treated  with  microfracture:  Lesions  on  the  weight-bearing  surfaces  on  the  condyles  were  to  be 
treated immediately after the operation, beginning in the recovery room, with a continuous passive motions 
(CPM) machine, according to the following instructions: “The initial range of motion is 30° to 70° and this is 
increased as tolerated by 10° to 20° until full range of motion is obtained. The rate of the machine is usually 
one  cycle  per  minute,  but  the  rate  varies  based  on  patient  performance  and  comfort,  the  patients  use  the 
CPM machine for 6 to 8 hours per 24 hours. If patients are unable to use the CPM machine, then they receive 
instructions  for  passive  flexion  and  extension  of  the  knee  with  500  repetitions  3  times  a  day.  Patients  are 
encouraged  to  gain  full  passive  range  of  motion  of  the  injured  knee  as  soon  as  possible  after  the  surgical 
procedure.” 
Cold therapy was used for all patients for 1 to 7 days after the operation. 
Thus,  after  surgery  all  patients  underwent  a  strict  rehabilitation  programme  for  three  months.  This 
programme is likely to affect functional outcomes and hence the effect measured in this trial is the effect of 
the  combination  of  the  intervention  under  study  and  the  rehabilitation  programme.  As  the  rehabilitation 
programmes  appeared  to  differ  between  the  two  treatment  arms  and  Amendment  2  of  the  Phase  III  study 
mentioned that improvements to the rehabilitation programme were made, further discussion was requested 
as  to  whether  this  could  have  favoured  one  of  the  treatment  groups.  However,  the  Applicant  provided 
sufficient  justification  that  the  components  of  the  rehabilitation  program  over  the  first  3  months  were  very 
similar between the groups and any minor differences did not affect the outcome of the study. 
It  was  also  clarified  that  although  there  are  no  head-to-head  studies  that  compare  different  rehabilitation 
programs  in  terms  of  clinical  outcome  using  different  methods/products,  it  is  most  likely  that  the  recovery 
period  after  ACI  depends not  only by  the  surgical  procedure  but  also  the  individual  patients’  condition (e.g. 
CHMP assessment report

degree  of  sportiness,  weight,  and  concomitant  illnesses).  The  Spherox  rehabilitation  program  allows  for  full 
load  of  the  operated  knee  after  8  -  12  weeks  which  is  in  line  with  other  matrix-assisted  chondrocyte 
implantation  procedures.  However,  as  mentioned  earlier,  the  current  literature  indicates  a  need  for  more 
studies on the influence of intermediate and longer-term phases of rehabilitation on the final outcome.  
Concomitant medication 
In  case  of  pain,  patient  agreed  only  to  use  paracetamol  mono-  (maximum  4  g/day)  or  a  combination 
preparation and oral and/or topical NSAIDs during the trial and to discontinue the use of oral and/or topical 
NSAIDs  and/or  paracetamol  combination  preparation  1  week  before  each  visit  (i.e.  only  the  use  of 
paracetamol mono-preparation, maximum 4 g/day was allowed). However, in the morning of the visit day, no 
pain  medication  was  allowed.  Other  pain  medications  were  allowed  during  the  surgical  procedure  and  could 
be taken for a period not exceeding 4 weeks after surgery. 
Objectives 
The objectives of this study is the assessment of the long term efficacy and safety of the three dimensional 
autologous chondrocyte transplantation product ACT3D-CS in comparison to microfracture in the treatment of 
cartilage defects of knee joints.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary  efficacy  variable:  Change  of  overall  KOOS  from  Day  0  (baseline  for  both  treatment  groups  =  pre-
arthroscopy  assessment)  to  final  assessment  (FA)  24  months  after  the  end  of  the  respective  treatment, 
compared between the two study treatment groups (ACT3DCS and microfracture). 
Secondary endpoints: 
•  Change of overall KOOS from baseline (Day 0) to 12 months (interim analysis, IA) and 36, 48 and 60 
months (follow-up, FU) after the end of the respective treatment, compared between the treatment 
groups. 
•  Change of overall KOOS from Day 0 for microfracture or from Day 0’ for ACT3D-CS to 12, 24, 36, 48 
and 60 months after the end of respective treatment. 
•  Change of the 5 subscores of the KOOS (pain, other symptoms, function in daily living (activities of 
daily living, ADL), function in sport and recreation (sport/rec), knee-related quality of life (QoL) from 
baseline  (Day  0  =  pre-arthroscopy  day)  to  12,  24,  36,  48  and  60  months  after  the  end  of  the 
respective treatment, compared between the treatment groups.

ICRS  Visual  Histological  Assessment  Score  at  final  assessment  (24  months)  compared  between  the 
treatment groups. 
ICRS II Histological Score at final assessment (24 months) compared between the treatment groups 
(this comparison was therefore not performed for the present interim report). 
•  Bern Score and additional histological assessment scores at final assessment (24 months) compared 
between the treatment groups. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 61/125 
  
  
•  Change  of  ICRS/IKDC  from  baseline  (Day  0)  to  12,  24,  36,  48  and  60  months  after  the  end  of  the 
respective treatment, compared between the treatment groups. 
•  Change of modified Lysholm Score from baseline (Day 0) to 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after the 
end of the respective treatment, compared between the treatment groups. 
•  Days  of  absence  from  work  (employment)  and/or  days  of  inability  to  pursue  usual  activities  during 
the last year or since the last study visit, respectively, and time point when patient was back at work 
and/or to could pursue usual activities. 
Sample size 
The  sample  size  calculation  was  based  on  showing  non-inferiority  of  ACT3D-CS  compared  to  microfracture 
after  24  months  taking  an  interim  analysis  after  12 months  into  account.  A  non-inferiority  margin  of  8.5  in 
the  standardised  KOOS  score  was  used.  Per  treatment  group  a  total  of  67  patients  (without  drop  outs)  are 
recommended  to  proof  non-inferiority  of  ACT3D-CS  in  comparison  to  microfracture  after  24  months.  A 
dropout  rate  of  about  4  %  of  patients  is  expected  who  cannot  be  transplanted  at  Day  0’.  Consequently  67 
patients in the microfracture group and 73 patients in the ACT3D-CS group are recommended to proof non-
inferiority. 
Randomisation and blinding 
Randomisation was performed via a central IVRS. Patients were stratified into two age groups: 18–34 years 
inclusive and >35 years. As the study was open-label. However, an independent radiologist (central reading 
by  “blinded  reader”)  assessed  all  MRI  pictures  after  study  intervention  without  knowledge  of  the  applied 
procedure  and  time  point  of  patient  participation  in  the  trial.  An  independent  central,  blinded  pathologist 
assessed the cartilage biopsies, taken from patients of both groups after 24 months, for the evaluation of the 
extent  of  cartilage  repair,  of  any  indication  of  migration  of  the  implanted  spheroids,  and  of  the  protein 
expression  of  chondrocyte-specific  markers.  The  sections  were  evaluated  at  the  same  time  after  the  last 
biopsy had been taken. The pathologist had to make his assessments without knowledge of which treatment 
had been given to the individual patient. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical hypotheses were tested hierarchically: 
First, relevant clinical improvement of ACT3D-CS versus baseline (Day 0) is tested. If the lower bound of the 
one-sided 97.5% confidence interval of the change in overall KOOS at 24 months (in the interim analysis: 12 
months) versus baseline (Day 0) is greater than 10 percentage points, then relevant clinical improvement are 
to be considered to have been shown, and the next step (noninferiority test of ACT3D-CS in comparison with 
microfracture) is performed. 
The difference between the improvement in overall KOOS after ACT3D-CS minus the improvement in overall 
KOOS  after  microfracture  is  tested,  with  a  hypothesised  value  of  zero  and  a  non-inferiority  margin  of  –8.5 
points.  Thus,  non-inferiority  is  considered  proven  if  the  lower  bound  of  the  confidence  interval  for  the 
difference is greater than –8.5. 
The  same  test  is  used  to  assess  superiority,  with  superiority  considered  proven  if  the  lower  bound  of  the 
confidence interval for the difference is greater than zero. 
In  the  present  interim  analysis  the  12-month  data  are  used.  In  the  original  protocol  an  O’Brien-Fleming 
alpha-spending  function  was  planned  to  be  used  for  the  interim  analysis.  Since  the  reason  for  the  interim

analysis is for submission to authorities and not to stop or change the trial in any way this was changed in an 
amendment . This is considered acceptable. 
Results 
Participants flow 
The following definitions were used for the analysis populations: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The  Safety  population:  all  patients  who  signed  an  informed  consent  and  were  successfully 
randomized 
ITT1 population: all patients who (i) were successfully randomized, (ii) received either ACT3D-CS on 
the  day  of  implantation  or  microfracture  on  the  day  of  arthroscopy,  and  (iii)  completed  the  KOOS 
questionnaire at baseline and/or Day 0'. 
ITT2  population:  all  patients  who  (i)  were  successfully  randomized,  and  (ii)  completed  the  KOOS 
questionnaire at baseline and/or Day 0'. 
PP population: all patients of the ITT1 population without major protocol violations. 
Study populations at 12 months after treatment 
The principal efficacy assessment was based on the ITT1 population, with supporting ITT2 and PP Analyses. 
The  ITT1  population  included  97  patients.  Five  patients  either  had  lacking  baseline  values  (3)  or  did  not 
receive  their  respective  ACT3D-CS  (1)  or  MF  (1)  treatment.  The  three  patients  who  did  not  produce  a 
baseline  KOOS  assessment  were  therefore  excluded  from  the  ITT2  population.  Two  of  the  ITT2  population 
patients did not receive treatment and were therefore excluded from the ITT1 population. The three patients 
excluded  from  the  ITT  population  due  to  missing  baseline  values  were  all  randomised  to  the  ACT3D-CS 
group,  representing  6%  of  this  group.  However,  there  is  no  indication  that  the  exclusion  of  these  patients 
altered the results in a significant way. Major protocol violations led to exclusion of 22 patients from the PP 
population, 13 in the ACT3D-CS group and 9 in the MF group. 
Recruitment 
This  trial  is  being  conducted  at  11  sites  (orthopaedic  clinics)  in  Germany  (10)  and  Poland  (1).  This  interim 
analysis  included  all  the  patients  who  attended  for  their  12-month  visit  (i.e.,  excluding  any  patients 
prematurely withdrawn from the study). 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was issued on 8th July 2010. Five protocol amendments were issued: Amendment no. 1 
(7th March 2012), amendment no. 2 (31th January 2013), amendment no. 3 (21th March 2014), amendment

no.  3.1  (25th  June  2014),  amendment  no.  4  (1st  June  2015).  Most  changes  were  of  practical  and/or 
administrative nature.  
Baseline data 
The study population comprised 41 women (40%) and 61 men (60%). All but two of the study patients were 
Caucasian  (100  patients, 98%); the  other two,  both  in  the  ACT3D-CS  group,  were  recorded  as  respectively 
Asian  and  Black.  The  two  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  in  respect  of  age,  sex,  height,  weight,  BMI 
and  alcohol  consumption.  There  was  a  slight  imbalance  in  respect  of  smoking,  with  approximately  equal 
numbers of smokers and non-smokers in the microfracture group but a minority of smokers (14/52, 27%) in 
the ACT3D-CS group. Clearly, more patients were smokers in the microfracture group, which is unfavourable 
for  the  comparator.  The  applicant  provided  a  descriptive  subgroup  analyses  by  smoking/non-smoking  and 
age.  The  overall  results  indicate  a  numerically  slightly  lower  change  from  baseline  in  KOOS  in  smokers 
treated with MF as compared to non-smokers. This was not the case for Spherox. No firm conclusions can be 
drawn  given  the  limited  patient  numbers  in  the  respective  subgroups  and  hence,  no  further  follow  up  is 
required. 
Primary (study) defects were almost all of femur, with only one being in the patella and femur (this patient's 
inclusion was a protocol violation.

Demographic data and baseline characteristics (Safety population) 
Type and grading of the defect are summarized in the tables below. ICRS grades were mostly III B or IV A, 
and were evenly balanced between the treatment groups.

Type of knee defect on day of arthroscopy (Safety population) 
Use  of  medication  before  screening  was  reported  by  48  (47%)  of  the  patients  overall,  with  slightly 
imbalanced  frequencies  in  the  two  treatment  groups:  21  patients  (40%)  in  the  ACT3D-CS  group  and  27 
patients (54%) in the microfracture group. The most frequently used prior medications were enoxaparin and 
midazolam.  
Concomitant  medications  and  rehabilitation:  All  the  patients  were  informed  about  the  rehabilitation  and 
follow-up programme and all took part in this programme after treatment. Frequently prescribed concomitant 
medications  were  pantoprazole  and  anticoagulants.  Concomitant  pain  medication  use  was  collected  as  a 
safety variable only. The numbers of patients who took pain medication are summarized in the table below. 
Overall,  numbers  of  patients  taking  pain  medication  increased  initially  after  treatment  and  then  decreased 
between Visits 1 and 2. 
Use of concomitant pain medication (safety population)

The  pattern  of  pain  medication  use  showed  no  notable  differences  between  the  treatment  groups.  In  both 
groups, there was an overall trend showing a reduced patient incidence of pain medication use. This could be 
viewed as supportive evidence to the decrease in KOOS subscore ‘pain’. Not unexpectedly, patients who took 
pain medication had lower KOOS values than patients who did not. However, in the microfracture group, the 
improvement  (change  from  baseline)  at  12  months  follow-up  compared  to  baseline  was  comparable  in 
patients taking pain medication (improvement of 16.1 KOOS points) and patients taking no pain medication 
(improvement of 16.9 KOOS points). In the Spherox group however, the improvement at 12 months follow-
up in patients taking pain medication (improvement of 12.1 KOOS) was lower than in patients taking no pain 
medication  (improvement  of  24.2  KOOS  points).  Why  the  MF  arm  was  not  similarly  affected  is  not  entirely 
clear but this discrepancy might be related to the small numbers of patients using pain medication at Visit 4 
and beyond.  
Numbers analysed 
The cause or reason for developing a cartilage defect was in most cases ‘trauma’ followed by ‘other’. In the 
Phase  III  study,  43  of  the  102  patients  had  a  traumatic  cartilage  lesion  and  53  had  ‘other’.  There  were  5 
patients with OA, 1 with OD and no patients with avascular necrosis. The applicant was requested to further 
specify  the  diagnosis  subgroup  ‘other’  to  obtain  more  clarity  on  the  origin  of  the  defect.  The  rationale  for 
using  the  category  ‘other’  was  to  stay  in  line  with  the  validated  forms  of  the  International  Cartilage  Repair 
Society (ICRS) Cartilage Injury Evaluation Package. In few cases, ‘overloading’ was assumed by investigators 
but  in  most  cases,  the  reasons  were  unknown  and  no  further  specifics  were  captured.  Thirty-five  of  the  52 
patients in the ACT3D-CS group (67%) and 36/50 patients in the microfracture group (72%) were recorded 
as having concomitant illnesses at screening. Overall, the treatment groups were well balanced in respect of 
their medical history. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Interim analysis results of the primary efficacy variable 
Complete descriptive statistics for overall KOOS at each study visit and the change at each visit from baseline 
is  provided  in  the table  below.  An  initial  decrease,  with  a  minimum  at  Visit  1, is  seen  for  all groups; this  is 
interpreted as being associated with the surgical procedure.

Overall KOOS at each visit – changes from baseline Day 0 (ITT1 population) 
The hierarchical statistical testing procedure for the ITT1 yielded the following results: 
Step 1: Test for relevant clinical improvement from baseline to Visit 4 for the ACT3D-CS group: 
Difference  =  22.2  (CI  16.9–27.5),  p  <  0.0001  [For  comparison,  though  not  part  of  Step  1:  Difference  for 
microfracture = 16.4 (CI 12.1–20.8), p < 0.0001.] 
Step  2:  Test  for  non-inferiority  of  ACT3D-CS  vis-à-vis  microfracture  (mean  difference  from  baseline  for 
ACT3D-CS minus mean difference from baseline for microfracture): 
Difference = 5.7 with lower bound of CI equal to –1.0. Since this lower bound has a value greater than –8.5, 
non-inferiority is formally demonstrated. 
Step 3: Test for superiority of ACT3D-CS vis-à-vis microfracture (mean difference from baseline for ACT3D-
CS minus mean difference from baseline for microfracture): 
Difference  as  for  Step  2.  Since  the  lower  bound  has  a  value  smaller  than  zero,  superiority  is  not  formally 
demonstrated. 
Analysis of  variance (ANOVA) yielded the following least-squares means with  corresponding standard errors 
and 95% confidence intervals: 
ACT3D-CS: 23.1 ± 2.3 (18.5–27.6) 
Microfracture: 15.5 ± 2.3 (11.0–20.0) 
The hierarchical statistical testing procedure for the PP population yielded the following results: 
Step 1: Test for relevant clinical improvement from baseline to Visit 4 for the ACT3D-CS group: 
Difference  =  21.9  (CI  16.2–27.7),  p  <  0.0001  [For  comparison,  though  not  part  of  Step  1:  Difference  for 
microfracture = 16.1 (CI 11.1–21.1), p < 0.0001.]

Step  2:  Test  for  non-inferiority  of  ACT3D-CS  vis-à-vis  microfracture  (mean  difference  from  baseline  for 
ACT3D-CS minus mean difference from baseline for microfracture): 
Difference  =  5.9  (p  =  0.0001)  with  lower  bound  of  CI  equal  to  –1.6.    Since  this  lower  bound  has  a  value 
greater than –8.5, non-inferiority is demonstrated at the descriptive level. 
Step 3: Test for superiority of ACT3D-CS vis-à-vis microfracture (mean difference from baseline for ACT3D-
CS minus mean difference from baseline for microfracture): 
Difference  as  for  Step  2.  Since  the  lower  bound  has  a  value  smaller  than  zero,  superiority  is  not 
demonstrated. 
Analysis of  variance (ANOVA) yielded the following least-squares means with  corresponding standard errors 
and 95% confidence intervals: 
ACT3D-CS: 22.2 ± 2.5 (17.2–27.1) 
Microfracture: 15.9 ± 2.4 (11.0–20.7) 
Of note, the formal primary efficacy analysis is change of overall KOOS from Day 0 to final assessment (FA) 
24  months  after  the  end  of  the  respective  treatment,  compared  between  the  two  study  treatment  groups 
(ACT3DCS  and  microfracture).  The  result  of  this  interim  analysis  is  that  the  ACT3D-CS  treatment  is  not 
inferior  to  microfracture,  but  superiority  was  not  demonstrated.  Overall  KOOS  at  12  months  was  however 
numerically in favour of ACT3D-CS.  
Secondary endpoints 
Analysis of KOOS without imputation (observed cases) 
Step 1: Test for relevant clinical improvement from baseline to Visit 4 for the ACT3D-CS group:  
Difference = 23.6 (CI 18.3–28.8), p < 0.0001 [For comparison: Difference for microfracture = 16.7 (CI 11.8–
21.5), p < 0.0001.] 
Step 2: Test for non-inferiority of ACT3D-CS vis-à-vis microfracture: 
Difference  =  6.9  (p  <  0.0001)  with  lower  bound  of  CI  equal  to  –0.1.  Since  this  lower  bound  has  a  value 
greater than –8.5, non-inferiority is demonstrated 
Step 3: Test for superiority of ACT3D-CS vis-à-vis microfracture: 
Difference as for Step 2. The lower bound is <0, so superiority is not demonstrated. 
Analysis of  variance (ANOVA) yielded the following least-squares means with  corresponding standard errors 
and 95% confidence intervals: 
ACT3D-CS: 24.7 ± 2.3 (20.2–29.3) 
Microfracture: 15.5 ± 2.3 (11.0–20.1) 
Analysis of KOOS using the ITT2 population 
Step 1: Test for relevant clinical improvement from baseline to Visit 4 for the ACT3D-CS group:

Analysis of KOOS using Day 0' for the ACT3D-CS group 
Analyses  were  repeated  using  Day  0’  for  the  ACT3D-CS  group  in  the  ITT1  population,  OC,  and  the  PP 
population. The results were consistent with the primary analysis.  
Analysis of KOOS subscores 
The  significance  testing  performed  for  the  primary  analysis  was  repeated  for  each  of  the  KOOS-related 
secondary variables.

Analysis of MOCART scores 
MOCART scores at Visits 2 and 4 (ITT1 population) 
MOCART  was  not  assessed  prior  to  study  treatment.  A  comparison  between  absolute  values  for  the  two 
treatment groups at the 3-month and 12-month visits yielded the following differences (score in the ACT3D-
CS group minus score in the microfracture group (ITT1 population): 
Visit 2: 5.1, with confidence interval –2.3 to +12.5 
Visit 4: 4.1, with confidence interval –2.4 to +10.6 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 73/125 
 
 
 
  
  
MOCART scores at Visits 2 and 4 (PP population) 
Results  were  similar  for  the  PP  population  (score  in  the  ACT3D-CS  group  minus  score  in  the  microfracture 
group):  Visit  2:  5.2,  with  confidence  interval  –2.6  to  +13.1;    Visit  4:  5.8,  with  confidence  interval  –0.8  to 
+12.4. 
The  MOCART  analysis  for  the  PP  population  came  close  to  showing  a  (descriptive)  statistically  significant 
difference  between  the  treatment  groups  at  Visit  4  (p=0.0845).  Thus,  overall,  modest  improvements  in 
MOCART  score  from  Visit 2  to  Visit  4  (12  months)  can  be  observed,  similar  between  the  treatment  groups. 
The  absence  of  a  baseline  measurement  precluded  a  within-group  comparison  from  baseline.  In  addition,  a 
substantial  proportion  of  overall  MOCART  scores  were  missing  with  results  for  the  overall  MOCART  score 
available  for  27  of  48  patients  in  the  ACT3D-CS  group  and  29  of  48  patients  in  the  MF  group.  This  was  a 
consequence of missing assessments for item 5b (Signal intensity of the repair tissue - 3DGE- FS) so that the 
overall  value  could  not  be  assessed.  This  item  5b  requires  a  MRI  conducted,  among  others,  with  a  fat  sat 
sequence, which was not conducted by some radiologists. When this was recognized, the Sponsor reminded 
the  participating  radiologists  to  conduct  all  required  sequences.  All  others  8  items  (except  item  5b)  were 
assessed for a minimum of 41 patients (ACT3D-CS group) and 44 patients (MF group). Individual items were 
reported in the CSR. Also, the applicant provided a comparative assessment of the scores for the 8/9 items 
for the patients not included due to missing item 5b as compared to the patients with complete data which 
did not demonstrate a selection bias.  
Correlation between KOOS and MOCART scores 
The  correlation  between  KOOS  and  MOCART  results  was  investigated  by  calculating  Spearman's  correlation 
coefficient  for  all  patients  for  whom  both  KOOS  and  MOCART  results  were  available.  A  better  subjective  or 
functional  outcome  in  correlation  with  an  increase  in  the  structural  parameters  of  the  MOCART  score  could 
not  be  observed.  This  is  consistent  with  the  published  literature  and  the  reasons  for  this  are  not  fully 
understood.  
IKDC Knee Examination Form – overall assessment 
In the IKDC Knee Examination Form overall score, at Visit 4 (12 months) 20 patients in the ACT3D-CS group 
and 17 in the MF group showed improvement, while 3 in each group showed worsening (24 and 29 showed 
no  change).  A  Kruskal–Wallace  test  to  compare  the  changes  in  the  groups  did  not  shown  significance  (p  = 
0.7208).

IKDC Knee Examination Form – overall assessment (ITT1 population) 
IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation Form 
Baseline  values  were  somewhat  higher  in  the  ACT3D-CS  group  than  in  the  microfracture  group;  for  the 
ACT3D-CS group. In both treatment groups they were lower (reflecting a poorer subjective assessment of the 
patients'  knee  condition)  at  Visit  1.  Thereafter  the  patients'  assessment  improved  from  visit  to  visit.  The 
improvement was numerically slightly greater in the ACT3D-CS group but without statistical significance. 
IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (ITT1 population) 
Modified Lysholm score 
Values were similar between the treatment groups at baseline (Day 0); a small improvement was seen in the 
ACT3D-CS group between Day 0 and Day 0' for the ACT3D-CS group. Scores decreased immediately after the 
operation  and  thereafter  improved  in  both  treatment  groups.  Both  treatment  groups  showed  significant 
improvement between baseline and Visit 4 (12 months after study treatment).

Modified Lysholm score (ITT1 population) 
Both treatment groups showed significant improvement between baseline and Visit 4 (12 months after study 
treatment)  (p<0.0001  both  groups)  with  no  significant  difference  between  the  groups.  Results  were 
consistent between the ITT1 and the PP population. 
Ancillary analyses 
The following subgroup analyses were conducted for the overall KOOS and MOCART: 
Age: Patients were stratified prospectively by age into two classes by randomisation procedure (18 - 34 and 
≥ 35 - 50 years). The age category ‘18–34 years’ was represented by 19 ITT patients in the ACT3DCS group 
and  18  patients  in  the  microfracture  group.  The  age  category  ‘35–50  years’  comprised  33  patients  treated 
with  ACT3D-CS  and  32  patients  treated  with  microfracture.  Both  age  groups  showed  an  increase  in  overall 
KOOS from baseline to Visit 4. KOOS overall values at Visit 4 were 86.5 for ACT3D-CS (p < 0.0001) and 68.1 
for microfracture (p = 0.0015) for the younger patients aged 18 – 34 years. For the older group an overall 
KOOS of 74.1 for ACT3D-CS and 68.2 for microfracture was assessed (both p values <0.0001).  
Results (mean differences with respective 95% confidence intervals) were as follows (ITT1 population): 
•  18–34 years: ACT3D-CS 21.3 [13.4–29.2] microfracture 12.9 [5.7–20.0] 
•  ≥ 35 - 50 years: ACT3D-CS 22.7 [15.3–30.1] microfracture 18.5 [12.9–24.1] 
Results for the PP population were: 
•  18–34 years: ACT3D-CS 21.4 [12.5–30.3] microfracture 12.9 [4.9–21.0] 
•  ≥ 35 - 50 years: ACT3D-CS 22.2 [14.4–30.1] microfracture 17.9 [11.2–24.5] 
Diagnosis:  Only  the  categories  ‘traumatic  cartilage  lesion’  (ACT3D-CS,  N  =  19;  MF,  N  =  24)  and  ‘others’ 
(ACT3D-CS, N = 32; MF,  N = 21) comprised sufficient numbers of patients to allow meaningful comparison 
between  the  subgroups  of  the  ITT1  patients  (there  were  no  AVN  patients  at  all).  For  ‘traumatic  cartilage 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 76/125 
 
  
  
lesion’ the mean overall KOOS rose in the first year after ACT3D-CS from 61.2 to 80.2 and for MF from 49.9 
to 62.4. For ‘others’ the KOOS score increased from 54.0 at baseline to 77.5 after 12 months for ACT3D-CS 
and for MF from 50.7 to 70.4. All these comparisons between baseline and the 12-month visit gave p < 0.05. 
The  results  (mean  differences  of  KOOS  with  respective  95%  confidence  intervals)  were  as  follows  (ITT1 
population): Traumatic cartilage lesion: ACT3D-CS 19.1 [10.5–27.6] MF 12.5 [6.1–18.9]; Others: ACT3D-CS 
23.4 [16.2–30.7] MF 19.7 [12.7–26.7]. 
Gender: No trends related to gender were observed. 
Duration of knee symptoms: Duration of knee symptoms before screening was recorded for the ACT3D-CS-
treated patients only. The results for KOOS score were as follows: 
•  < 1 year: mean ± SD, 87.6 ± 9.1; median 89; range 60–100 
•  1 year: mean ± SD, 76.8 ± 17.6; median 78; range 34–100 
A weak negative correlation was found between KOOS score at the 12-month visit and the previous duration 
of knee symptoms (ρ = –0.228 for N = 39 ITT1 patients; –0.209 for N = 30 PP patients). N values are small, 
as  many  patients  did  not  provide  information  about  the  duration  of  symptoms.  Nevertheless,  the  sign  of 
Spearman's  ρ  suggests  that  a  longer  pre-treatment  period  with  symptoms  is  associated  with  a  poorer 
condition after treatment.  
BMI:  No  correlation  was  found  between  KOOS  score  at  Visit  4  (12  months  after  treatment)  and  BMI 
(Spearman's ρ = 0.066 for N = 97 ITT1 patients; 0.108 for N = 80 PP patients).  
Overall,  the  subgroup  analyses  showed  results  that  were  generally  consistent  with  the  overall  results.  The 
applicant was requested to discuss the fact that duration of knee symptoms appeared to have been recorded 
only  for  a  subgroup of  39  ACT3D-CS-treated  patients,  which  showed  a  numerically lower  KOOS outcome  at 
12  months  for  those  patients  with  longer  disease  duration.  According  to  a  recent  review  (Mithoefer  et  al, 
Cartilage. 2011;2[2]:100-21) several studies have demonstrated that ‘age of the defect’, that is, time since 
onset  of  the  cartilage  injury  of  more  than  12  to  36  months,  had  a  clear  negative  effect  on  both  MF  and 
cellular therapy outcomes. Thus, an imbalance between the treatment group would be potentially relevant in 
this regard. It was clarified that duration of symptoms was reported by 39 patients in the ACT3D-CS group 
and by 40 patients in the microfracture (MF) group. The other patients of the treatment groups did not report 
and/or  did  not  recall  the  duration  of  symptoms  during  screening.  The  duration  of  symptoms  for  these 
patients  is  unknown.  Descriptive  statistics  for  the  outcome  KOOS  overall  was  provided  by  duration  of 
symptoms  for  the  subgroup  category  ≤  1  year  und  >  1  year.  This  showed  no  major  difference  in  KOOS 
outcome  between  the  symptom  duration  subgroups  in  either  treatment  arm.  Higher  preoperative  activity 
rates  (Tegner  score  >  4) have  been  shown  to influence  the  function  and  activity  outcomes of  microfracture 
(Gracitelli  GC,  et  al.  Cochrane  Database  Syst  Rev.  2016;3[9]).  While  the  Tegner  activity  score  was  not 
recorded in the Phase III study other outcomes related to patient activity levels such as the KOOS subscore 
‘function in sport and recreation’ appeared to be balanced at baseline. 
The  applicant  also  provided  additional  subgroup  analyses  to  study  the  influence  of  recorded  meniscal, 
ligament  and  the  other  surgeries  on  clinical  outcome.  These  subgroup  analyses  indicated  similar  benefit  in 
terms of KOOS change from baseline in both subgroups (surgery yes/no). In addition, to further understand 
the external validity of the trial, the applicant was requested clarify whether there was a difference in primary 
outcome  based  on  region  (e.g.  comparing  sites  in  Germany  to  those  in  Poland).  The  number  of  patients 
enrolled outside Germany was very low however, limiting interpretability. The applicant performed an ANOVA 
analysis  to  verify  that  no  centre  effect  was  present  and  to  show  that  criteria  for  the  recruitment  were 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 77/125 
  
  
constant and balanced between centres. In the analysis all Spherox-treated patients (72 patients in Phase II 
and  48  in  the  Phase  III  trial)  with  baseline  assessment  and  Visit  4  results,  were  included.  No  significant 
differences  were  seen  between  the  study  centres,  whether  small  or  large,  based  on  KOOS  response.  This 
implies that similar criteria in recruitment and similar treatment practices between centres were used. 
The product has been legally on the market in Germany since 2004, and has also been available in Belgium, 
Greece, Italy, Spain and Austria. According to the applicant, already since that time, all surgeons and other 
healthcare professionals involved in the handling and administration of Spherox as well as those involved in 
follow-up  of  patients  treated  with  the  product,  receive  training  through  a  training  programme  prior  to  the 
distribution  of  Sperox.  This  is  done  to  avoid  differences  in  treatment  and  rehabilitation  after  ACT3D  with 
Spherox or MF.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A pooled analysis of Spherox-treated patients from both clinical trials Phase II (cod 16 HS 14) and Phase III 
(cod  16  HS  13)  was  performed  to  increase  the  overall  sample  size  and  to  compare  the  main  endpoints  in 
subgroups  by  defect  size  at  implantation  (1  to  <  4  cm2,  ≥  4  to  10  cm2),  sex  (male,  female),  age  (18–34 
years,  35–50  years),  location  (femur,  patella),  diagnosis  (traumatic  cartilage  lesion,  osteoarthritis, 
osteochondritis dissecans, and others) and femoral condyle location (medial, lateral). The study was a pooled 
analysis of the 12-month data from both studies. A statistically significant increase in overall KOOS was seen 
in  all  subgroups  investigated,  with  the  exception  of  the  diagnosis  subgroups  ‘OA’  and  ‘OD’  which  contained 
few  patients  (8  and  6,  respectively).  Excluding  the  latter  subgroups,  the  mean  improvements in  the  overall 
KOOS  between  baseline  and  12-months  visit  were  between  16.2  and  22.0  in  the  subgroups.  The  results 
below reflect the pooled ITT population. 
Defect size: At Visit 4 (12 months after implantation), the mean and median increase with respect to baseline 
was somewhat lower in the group with larger defect sizes (n=73) (mean change, 16.2 ± 18.2; p = 0.0050) 
than in the ‘small defect size’ group (n=48) (mean change, 22.0 ± 17.8; p<0.0001), but the improvements 
were statistically significant in both subgroups. 
Gender:  The  improvements  from  baseline  to  Visit  4  were  statistically  significant  in  both  gender  subgroups: 
for women (n=40) the mean change was 20.4 ± 17.2 (p = 0.0005) and for men (n=81) it was 17.7 ± 18.7 
(p = 0.0004). 
Age: The mean and median overall KOOS values at baseline were numerically slightly lower in the age group 
‘35–50 years’ (n=61) than in the age group ‘18–34 years’ (n=60). Hence, the Product is not recommended 
for use in the patients of 50 The absolute mean and median values of the overall KOOS remained lower for 
the older patients than for the younger ones at all visits. However, the mean and median improvements were 
numerically only slightly smaller in the older patient subgroup, and the improvements between baseline and 
Visit 4  were  statistically  significant  in  both  subgroups:  for  ‘18–34  years’  the mean  change  was  18.7  ±  14.8 
(p<0.0001) and for ‘35–50 years’ it was 18.4 ± 21.1 (p = 0.0029). Of note, in the Phase II study (cod 16 HS 
14), a statistically significant improvement was seen in the younger age group (18-34 years) at the 12 month 
visit  in  all  dose  levels,  while  in  the  older  age  group  (35–50  years),  a  statistical  difference  was  not  seen. 
However,  in  the  Phase  III  study,  a  clear  improvement  in  mean  KOOS  score  at  1-year  interim  analysis  was 
seen in both age groups.  
Defect location: Baseline mean and median overall KOOS values were lower in the patella subgroup (n=45) 
than in the  femur subgroup (n=76). The absolute mean and median KOOS values were numerically slightly 
lower  in  the  patella  than  in  the  femur  subgroup  at  all  post-implantation  visits.  The  improvements  in  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 78/125 
  
  
overall KOOS from baseline to Visit 4 were statistically significant in the femur subgroup (mean change, 18.7 
± 19.3; p = 0.0002) and patella subgroup (mean change, 18.2 ± 16.5; p = 0.0019). 
Femoral  condyle  location:  Overall  KOOS  values  (mean  and  median)  were  lower  in  the  ‘lateral  femoral 
condyle’  subgroup  (n=56)  than  in  the  ‘medial  femoral  condyle’  subgroup  (n=18)  at  all  visits.  The 
improvements  in  the  overall  KOOS  from  baseline  to  Visit  4  were  statistically  significant  in  both  subgroups: 
the mean change was 21.1 ± 15.8 (p = 0.0086) in the ‘medial femoral condyle’ subgroup and 17.6 ± 20.1 (p 
= 0.0068) in the ‘lateral femoral condyle’ subgroup. 
Diagnosis: At baseline, the mean and median overall KOOS values were distinctly higher in the patients with 
OD than in all other diagnosis subgroups. The improvements between baseline and Visit 4 were statistically 
significant  in  the  diagnosis  subgroups  ‘traumatic  cartilage  lesion’  (mean  change,  18.2  ±  14.6; p  =  0.0001) 
and  ‘others’  (mean  change,  20.3  ±  19.3;  p  =  0.0004),  but  not  in  the  OD  and  OA  subgroups  (see  table 
below). 
Overall KOOS at each visit by diagnosis (ITT); pooled analysis 
Overall,  these  pooled  analyses  point  towards  consistency  of  efficacy  between  the  variously  defined 
subgroups.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies have been performed in patients over 50 years of age.  
Study cod 16 HS 17paed  
Study  cod  16  HS  17paed  is  a  prospective,  non-interventional  investigation  to evaluate  the long-term  safety 
and  linked  efficacy  of  the  three-dimensional  autologous  chondrocyte  implantation  product  in  paediatric 
patients from closure of the epiphyses to less than 18 years of age treated with the product until December 
2011.  The  completion  of  this  study  was  deferred  to  June  2020.  The  current  submission  includes  an  interim 
report, dated 15 September 2016 using a data cut-off date of 31 January 2016. Study cod 16 HS 17paed is 
an ongoing non-interventional, open-label, multicentre surveillance study. The objective is to assess the long-
term safety and linked efficacy of Spherox in paediatric patients from 15 to less than 18 years of age at the 
time  of  implantation.  It  is  planned  to  include  at  least  80  patients  from  approximately  40  centres  with  data 
collected  by  the  physicians  based  on  medical  records.  Physical  examination  data  based  on  a  physical

examination  visit  are  to be  collected  in  a  subpopulation of  at  least  30  patients.  A  MRI  examination  within  a 
time  window  of  ±  3  month  of  the  physical  examination  can  be  performed  in  a  subpopulation  for  MOCART 
analysis. Patients are asked to complete web-based questionnaires at home once during the study. 
At  the  interim  cut-off  date  (31  January  2016),  data  were  available  for  33  patients.  Four  patients  were  not 
included  in  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS),  on  which  data  analysis  was  based,  because  either  the  implantation 
date  was  missing  or  an  inclusion  criterion  was  not  met.  The  FAS  comprised  29  patients  for  the  interim 
analysis. The Physical Examination (PE) subpopulation comprised 23 patients (79% of the 29 FAS patients). 
The  time  between  documentation  of  the  data  as  part  of  this  study  and  the  ACTD3D  with  Spherox  ranged 
between approximately 3.5 and 8 years (mean: 63.3 months). 
Study population: The FAS consisted of 15 boys (52%) and 14 girls (48%) between 15 and 17 years of age 
(mean age, 16.0 ± 0.9 years). The status of the epiphyseal plate was ‘closed’ in 12 patients (41%), ‘open’ in 
8 patients (28%), and was not documented in 9 patients (31%). Diagnoses of cartilage lesion were trauma 
(48%),  OD  (48%),  and  ‘other’  (3%).  The  mean  duration  of  symptoms  (i.e.  duration  of  pain  until 
implantation)  was  20.9  ±  24.6  months.  Thirty-two  defects  in  29  patients  were  found.  Locations  of  defects 
were the femur (22 defects), tibia (1 defect) and patella (9 defects). The sizes of the cartilage lesions ranged 
between 2.2 and 12.0 cm2 (mean defect area size, 4.6 ± 2.4 cm2). The mean Spherox dose was 33.8 ± 15.3 
spheroids/cm2.

Treatment  failure  rate  (FAS):  Treatment  failure  was  the  primary  endpoint  (as  defined  in  the  PIP).  This  was 
considered to have occurred when a patient required additional surgical treatment after ACT3D treatment and 
the required procedure involved ‘extensive debridement for lesion expansion’ or ‘violation of the subchondral 
bone’ or ‘ACI’. Five (17% of 29) patients had additional surgery at the affected knee after ACT3D. One of the 
patients met the criteria for treatment failure; thus, the treatment failure rate in the overall set was 0.034. 
As this one patient with treatment failure had a closed epiphyseal growth plate at the time of transplantation; 
the treatment failure rate in the subgroup ‘closed’ was 0.083. The time to treatment failure was 34.3 months. 
Physical  examination:  Physical  examination  findings  were  available  for  23  patients  and  were  normal  in  the 
majority  of  the  patients:  the  muscles  examined  were  equal-sized  on  both  sides  in  83%  of  the  PE 
subpopulation,  none  of  the  patients  had  knee  effusion,  and  few  patients  had  patella/meniscus  signs  and/or 
pressure pain. The mean passive and active motion ranges of the affected knees were normal. 
MRI  examination:  MRI  was  obtained  in  the  physical  examination  (PE)  subpopulation  which  comprised  23 
patients.  The  defect  repair  and  filling  was  complete  in  8  patients  (53% of  15 patients)  and  incomplete  (but 
nonetheless  >50%  of  adjacent  cartilage)  in  2  patients  (13%);  hypertrophy  was  seen  in  5  patients  (33%). 
The  integration  to  border  zone  was  complete  in  9  patients  (60%)  and  incomplete  in  6  patients  with  the 
demarcating  border  visible  in  3  patients  (20%)  and  defect  visible  <50%  of  the  length  of  RT  in  the  other  3 
patients (20%). The surface of the RT was intact in 7 patients (47%) and damaged (<50% of the RT depth) 
in 8 patients (53%). The structure of the RT was homogenous in 10 patients (67%) and inhomogeneous in 5 
patients (33%). 
MRI examination and MOCART score (cod 16 HS 17 paed) 
The  mean  MOCART  score  was  74.7  ±  12.0  (N  =  15)  at  the  follow-up  examination  63.3  months  after 
treatment, indicating, on average, good repair tissue growth.

Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): The mean overall KOOS score was 82.6 ± 11.6 (N = 
22), indicating very mild problems with the knee injury  up to 95 (mean, 63.6) months after treatment. For 
the  subscales,  mean  scores  were:  94.9  ±  7.4  (ADL),  88.5  ±  10.4  (pain),  83.1  ±  16.1  (other  symptoms), 
78.6 ± 20.2 (function in sports and recreation), and 67.6 ± 17.2 (knee-related QoL). The mean overall KOOS 
scores in the subgroups by epiphyseal plate status were: 86.7 ± 7.1 (open, N = 6), 82.0 ± 11.3 (closed, N = 
8), and 80.0 ± 14.7 (not documented, N = 8). The subscale scores were roughly similar between the patients 
with  ‘closed’  and  ‘not  documented’  epiphysis  status.  In  the  subgroup  with  ‘open’  epiphysis,  the  subscale 
‘Sport/Rec.’ was not as strongly affected as in the other subgroups: for this subscore the mean scores were 
90.8 ± 6.7 (open), 76.3 ± 21.2 (closed), and 71.9 ± 23.6 (not documented). 
IKDC Current Health Assessment Form (SF-36): Seven patients (24.1%) of the 29 did not complete the IKDC 
Current  Health  Assessment  Form.  The  mean  Physical  Component  Summary  (PCS)  summary  score  in  the 
overall set of 22 patients was 52.3 ± 7.0 and the mean Mental Health Component (MCS) score was 53.9 ± 
6.3, indicating physical and mental health above the average in the U.S. general population norm for up to 
95 (mean: 63.6) months after treatment. The subgroup with undocumented status of the epiphysis showed 
the lowest mean PCS but the highest mean MCS. The mean PCS scores were: 56.4 ± 4.0 (open, N = 6), 52.5 
±  4.2  (closed,  N  =  8),  and  49.1  ±  9.6  (not  documented,  N  =  8).  The  mean  MCS  scores  were:  52.1  ±  6.7 
(open, N = 6), 52.0 ± 7.3 (closed, N = 8), and 57.2 ± 3.9 (not documented, N = 8). 
IKDC  Subjective  Knee  Evaluation  Form:  The  mean  IKDC  score  was  81.1  ±  12.7  (N  =  22),  indicating  on 
average mild limitations in respect of ‘activities of daily living’, ‘sports activities’ and ‘symptoms’ for up to 95 
(mean, 63.6) months after treatment. 
Modified Lysholm Knee Scoring: The mean total score was 21.0 ± 2.4, indicating that the knee problems on 
average  did  not  affect,  or  affected  only  marginally,  the  patients’  ability  to  manage  activities  of  daily  living 
(the best possible score of 24 indicates no knee problems) for up to 95 (mean, 63.6) months after treatment. 
The mean total scores in the epiphysis subgroups were 22.0 ± 1.1 (open, N = 6), 20.1 ± 3.3 (closed, N = 8), 
and 21.0 ± 1.9 (not documented, N = 8).  
Overall, this study provides interim descriptive data on symptoms and structural repair during the treatment 
follow-up. The outcome scores after the follow-up period of on average 63 months reached levels comparable 
to those observed for adult patients treated with Spherox after 3 years. 
Study Cod 16 HS 16 
The  applicant  has  conducted  a  non-interventional,  multicentre  (8  centres  in  Germany),  retrospective  data 
collection  from  29  children/adolescent  patients  having  knee  joint  cartilage  defect  who  were  followed  up  to 
seven  years  from  the  Spherox  transplantation.  The  data  were  collected  from  former  patients  treated  with 
ACT3D  for  cartilage  defects.  The  study  planned  to  cover  a  period  of  up  to  84  months  comprising  up  to  7 
visits.  Data  were  obtained  for  up  to  57  months  after  the  implantation.  The  analysis  of  efficacy  and  safety 
variables  took  account  of  subgroups  as  defined  by  the  status  of  the  epiphyseal  plate  (open  /  closed  /  no 
information). A total of 29 adolescent patients were enrolled and analysed in this study, of whom 7 patients 
(26%) presented with an open and 6 (21%) with a closed epiphyseal plate. The mean MOCART score tended 
to increase (see table below), which may point to an average increase in cartilage repair tissue over time, but 
the very low number of patients available for data collection at the majority of the pre-selected time intervals 
has to be taken into account.

Available MOCART data from cod 16 HS 16 for adolescent patients 
The mean VAS pain score, as self-assessed by the patients, decreased from 46.0 mm at baseline to 39, 25, 8 
and 20 mm at the 2nd to 5th time interval, respectively. 
Available VAS data from cod 16 HS 16 for adolescent patients 
For all IKDC assessments, there were improvements from baseline to almost all postoperative time intervals, 
which  were  most  pronounced  for  the  effusion,  compartment  findings,  X-ray  findings  and  functional  test 
(subgroup data not shown).

IKDC final* evaluation by subgroups trauma/OCD/other and all patients  
enrolled (N=29) 
The  Applicant  reported  an  overlap  of  12  patients  between  cod  16  HS  16  and  cod  16  HS17  paed.  Thus,  the 
additional informative value of cod 16 HS 16 is rather limited. 
Supportive studies 
The applicant submitted 16 supportive studies/publications with efficacy information.  
Retrospective study: cod RS1 SR (2015) 
This retrospective study cod RS1 SR (2015) included patients with cartilage defects of the knee, treated with 
Spherox  in  routine  clinical  practice  by  Dr.  Rössing  at  his  centre  in  Mannheim  (Germany)  between  October 
2008 and November 2011. All patients treated in this period were contacted; of these 18 patients consented 
(out of 26) and were analysed with a 12 month follow-up period. The range of patients’ age (15–51 years), 
body  mass  index  (19.1–31.1  kg/m2)  and  sex  (8  female,  11  male)  can  be  regarded  as  representative.  The 
dose was between 6 and 52 spheroids/cm2. Defect sizes ranged from 3 to 10 cm2. Primary defects located on 
the  patella,  femur  and  tibia  were  treated.  The  longest  follow-up  period  was  12  months  after  implantation. 
Efficacy  was  measured  by  five  independent  assessments  at  baseline  (before  implantation)  and  different 
points  in  time  after  implantation.  Efficacy  variables  included  Lysholm  Score  (12  month  post-OP),  Tegner 
Activity Scale (12 month post-OP), Kellgren and Lawrence Classification (12 month post-OP) and WOMAC-D 
Score  (6  weeks  and  3  months  post-OP).  The  increase  in  Kellgren  Lawrence  grade  represents  a  very  slight

worsening – though not clinically relevant. The improvements in Lysholm (from 52 to 81 points (out of 100) 
and  Tegner  (from  2.4  to  4.7  points  [out  of  10])  scores  indicate  an  improvement  in  the  patient’s  clinical 
outcome.  Changes  in  WOMAC-D  score  were  not  significant.  For  MOCART  assessment  (MRI  Score)  the  12-
month post-OP value was 79 ± 20.5 points (out of 100). 14 patients showed complete filling of the defect, 13 
of  these  showed  a  homogeneous  repair-tissue  structure,  12  showed  complete  integration  with  the  adjacent 
cartilage and 12 an intact repair-tissue surface. 
Efficacy scores (cod RS1 SR) 
Note: One of the 18 consenting patient was operated twice and therefore counted twice. 
As addressed in response to the question from the CAT/CHMP, potential overlap of this study was found with 
the  Rössing  2010  study  and  also  with  the  paediatric  investigation  cod  16  HS  17  paed.  Because  of  the  high 
degree  of  overlap  (and  without  the  availability  of  sufficient  detail  to  assess  this  precisely),  the  applicant 
believes that cod RS1 SR includes at least 17 patients not discussed elsewhere. 
Retrospective study: cod RS2 RS (2015) 
Retrospective  study  cod  RS2  RS  (2015)  included  patients  with  cartilage  defects  of  the  knee,  treated  with 
Spherox in routine clinical practice by Dr. Siebold at the ATOS Clinic in Heidelberg (Germany) between April 
2006 and August 2010. Twenty patients gave their consent for analysis of their medical records. As clarified 
by the applicant, this study fully overlaps with the Siebold 2015 study (see below). The applicant concludes 
cod RS2 SR does not include patients not also discussed in the Siebold study.  
Retrospective study: cod RS3 TS (2016) 
Retrospective  study  cod  RS3  TS  (2016)  included  patients  with  cartilage  defects  of  the  knee,  treated  with 
Spherox in routine clinical practice by Dr. Schreyer in Darmstadt (Germany) between 1998 and 2012. Forty-
four  patients  (out  of  90)  gave  their  consent  for  analysis  of  their  medical  records.  The  range  of  patient  age 
was 17–56 years and included 17 females, 27 males. Thirty-four patients were treated with Spherox and ten 
patients with chondrotransplant (chondrocyte suspension covered with a periosteal flap – classical ACI). The 
knee  cartilage  defect  was  located  on  the  femur  for  all  10  chondrotransplant  patients.  For  Spherox  in  29 
patients  the  defect  was  located  on  the  femur,  3  patients  had  a  defect  on  the  patella,  and  the  remaining  2 
patients had a defect on the tibia. The defect size ranged from 0.7 to 6.3 cm² among the chondrotransplant 
patients,  with  a  mean  of  4.0  ±  2.0  cm².  Among  the  Spherox-treated  patients,  the  defects  were  sized 
between  1.5  and  11.0  cm²,  with  a  mean  of  5.77  ±  2.64  cm².  The  following  defect  aetiologies  in  patients 
treated  with  chondrotransplant  were  observed:  6  trauma,  1  ostechondroitis  dissecans  (OD),  and  3

degenerative. The aetiologies of the defects in patients treated with Spherox were: 14 trauma, 3 OD, and 15 
degenerative. The amounts of spheroids implanted led to a mean dose of 27 ± 25 spheroids/cm² (range, 2–
139  spheroids/cm²).  The  mean 
follow-up  time  was:  98  months  (range,  48–144  months) 
for 
chondrotransplant  and:  22  months  (range,  2–96  months)  for  Spherox.  Efficacy  was  measured  by  six 
independent assessments at baseline (before implantation) and at different points in time after implantation 
and  included  Lysholm  Gillquist  Score,  Tegner  Lysholm  Score,  HSS  Score,  DGKKT  Score,  Tegner  Score,  and 
Cincinnati Score. 
Efficacy scores (cod RS3 TS) 
The assessment of the efficacy scores (i.e. Lysholm Gillquist, Tegner Lysholm, HSS, DGKKT, Tegner Activity, 
and  Cincinnati)  revealed  a  consistent  significant  (p  value  at  descriptive  level)  improvement  of  the  mean 
scores  from  pre-operation  examination  (baseline)  to  the  follow-up  visits  12  and  24  months  post-OP.  The 
amount  of  data  for  time  frames  later  than  24  months  post-OP  the  amount  of  available  patient  data  is  very 
low  (≤  4  patients).  The  chondrotransplant  results  are  not  shown  here  but  can  be  found  in  the  report.  No 
substantial differences between the two ACI products were found. As clarified by the applicant, this study has 
high  degree  of  overlap  with  the  previously  submitted  Schreyer  et  al  (2006),  follow-up:  Schreyer  (2010) 
studies but no detailed information of patients from Schreyer et al., 2006 and Schreyer, 2010 are available to 
identify the exact extend of overlap. 
Retrospective study: cod RS4 WZ (2014) 
The retrospective study cod RS4 WZ (2014) includes patients with cartilage defects of the knee, treated with 
Spherox in routine clinical practice by Dr. Zinser  at  the St. Vinzenz  Hospital, Dinslaken (Germany) between 
2009  (introduction  of  the  standard  questionnaire)  and  the  end  of  2012.  All  the  90  patients  treated  in  this 
period were contacted; of these, 36 patients consented to analysis of their medical files. The range of patient 
age  was  18–54  years,  16  females,  20  males.  Defect  sizes  ranged  from  0.5  to  10.8  cm2.  Primary  defects 
CHMP assessment report

located on the patella or the femur were treated. The dose was between 8 and 94 spheroids/cm². The follow-
up  examinations  were  conducted  3,  6,  12  months  after  implantation.  The  primary  analysis  of  the  IKDC 
Subjective Knee Evaluation Score, 12 months after implantation, revealed an improvement from initially 38.8 
± 14.9 points (out of 100) to 61.0 ± 17.7 points (p < 0.0001, at the descriptive level). IKDC Current Health 
Assessment  scores  showed  improvement  for  ‘physical  component  summary’  (p  <  0.0001;  change  from 
baseline 13 points), but not ‘mental component summary’ (p = 0.2461; change from baseline 3 points). For 
the  20  patients  for  whom  a  MOCART  assessment  was  available,  the  12-month  result  was  70  (out  of  100). 
This study has an overlap with Study 16 (cod 16HS17 paed) concerning one patient. 
Prospective study by Siebold et al (2015) 
In the publication by Siebold et al (2015), a total of 41 patients (31 men, 10 women) with 57 full-thickness 
articular  cartilage  lesions  of  the  knee  underwent  a  second-look  arthroscopy  at  the  ATOS  Klinik  (Heidelberg, 
Germany) after treatment with Spherox between 2009 and 2014. Chondral defects were located at the femur 
(47 defects), patella (8 defects) and tibia (2 defects). The mean defect size was 4.3 ± 3.4 cm² (range 0.5–20 
cm2).  Assessment  of  clinical  follow-up  took  place  6–72  months  after  treatment  (mean,  34.5  months).  At 
follow-up,  evaluation  of  KOOS  showed  an  average  mean  of  81.0  ±  12.9  for  ‘pain’,  76.8  ±  16.6  for 
‘symptoms’, 85.1 ± 14.9 for ‘ADL’, 55.3 ± 27.7 for ‘sport and recreation’ and 50.6 ± 23.8 for ‘QoL’. The IKDC 
score  was  63.0  ±  18.8,  the  Lysholm  score  was  79.0  ±  18.0,  and  the  Tegner  score  was  4  (range  1–6). 
Subjective assessment according to the VAS scale was on average 7.4 ± 2.1 for overall satisfaction and 6.7 ± 
2.5  satisfaction  for  the  operated  knee.  Second-look  arthroscopies  were  performed  13.8  ±  13.2  months 
(range: 6–72 months) after treatment. Arthroscopic assessment was performed according to ICRS-CRA. The 
cartilage status of the 57 lesions was rated as “normal” (CRA I) in 12 lesions (21%), “nearly normal” (CRA II) 
in  40  (70%)  and  “abnormal”  (CRA  III)  in  5  (9%).  None  of  the  treated  defects  were  rated  as  “severely 
abnormal”  (CRA  IV).  Regarding  the  degree  of  defect  repair,  40  lesions  (70%)  were  completely  filled  to  the 
level  of  the  surrounding  cartilage  shoulder  and  9  lesions  (16%)  reached  only  75%  of  the  height  of  the 
surrounding  cartilage  shoulder.  In  terms  of  integration  into  the  adjacent  cartilage,  46  of  57  lesions  (81%) 
showed  a  complete  integration  into  the  surrounding  cartilage.  The  macroscopic  appearance  was  an  “intact 
smooth  surface”  or  a  (superficially)  “fibrillated  surface”  in  43  lesions  (75%).  The  potential  predictors  BMI, 
size of defect, location of defect and follow-up time did not have a significant impact on the CRA. A possibly 
significant  correlation  (p  =  0.04)  was  found  only  between  age  and  CRA.  Prior  to  surgery,  patients  were 
clinically and radiologically assessed for tibiofemoral and patellofemoral malalignment. When pathologic, this 
was addressed simultaneously with, e.g. a high tibial osteotomy (HTO) or a medial tibial tubercle transfer, to 
offload  the  involved  cartilage  lesion  and  to  optimise  cartilage  healing.  Anterior  cruciate  ligament 
reconstruction  and  meniscal  surgery  were  performed,  too.  The  publication  reports that  concomitant  surgery 
was necessary in 27 (65.8 %) of 41 patients which limits the interpretability of the study.  
Körsmeier et al (2014)  
Initial results from this study (Körsmeier et al [2012] were reported at the 29th AGA conference in 2012 in 
Zürich.  During  the  period  from  March  2011  to  August  2012,  18  patients  (3  female,  15  male),  aged  20–47 
years  (mean,  32.6  years)  with  proven  cartilage  defects  caused  exclusively  by  cam-impingement  were 
biopsied, and received Spherox implants arthroscopically six weeks later. In this follow up study, the outcome 
of  16  of  these  patients  with  an  average  of  16.09  (SD,  5.3;  range,  9.5–28.8)  months  follow-up  after 
treatment  with  Spherox  was  described.  The  mean  age  of  the  two  female  and  fourteen  male  patients  was 
31.75 years, ranging from 20 to 47. At each visit, the nonarthritic hip score (NAHS) and the Western Ontario 
and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) were determined. In addition, patient satisfaction at the 
last follow-up examination was evaluated by means of a questionnaire completed by the patients. The mean 
CHMP assessment report

area of the chondral defects, as determined during arthroscopy, was 4.52 cm2, ranging from 3 to 6 cm2 (SD 
1.13  cm2).  Six  weeks  after  the  arthroscopy,  the  WOMAC  and  NAHS  improved significantly  (p  <  0.001). Six 
weeks  after  the  implantation  procedure  (12-week  monitoring),  a  further  significant  enhancement  of  both 
scores  was  observed  (p  <  0.001).  At  the  last  follow-up,  the  WOMAC  showed  no  further  increase,  while  the 
NAHS further improved slightly and significantly in comparison with the 12-week monitoring. This exploratory 
study  showed  short-term  improvement  in  the  clinical  scores  of  patients  undergoing  ACT  3D  during 
impingement  surgery.  As  no  biopsies  were  taken  in  this  study,  there  are  no  data  on  the  quality  of  the 
reparative  tissue.  As  is  concluded  in  this  publication,  further  prospective-randomized  studies  with  a  larger 
cohort  of  patients  and  longer  follow-up  periods  are  needed  to  clarify  the  comparative  value  of  ACT  3D  in 
comparison with other treatment options for chondral defects of the hip. 
Fickert et al (2014) 
This was a retrospective evaluation of outcome of the treatment with Spherox administered to patients with 
cartilage  defects  of  the  hip.  A  total  of  six  patients  (five  men,  one  woman)  aged  between  25  and  45  years 
were  included  in  this  investigation  of  the  treatment  with  ACT3D.  All  patients  completed  follow-up 
examinations.  The  average  time  of  follow-up  was  11.2  months.  According  to  the  ICRS  classification  all 
patients were diagnosed with a full-thickness chondral defect of the hip (grade IIIa–IIId). Three defects were 
located  on  the  anterolateral-anteromedial  acetabulum,  one  on  the  anterolateral  acetabulum,  one  on  the 
anteromedial acetabulum and one on the anterosuperior femoral head. The average defect size was 3.5 cm2. 
All  acetabular  defects  were  caused  by  cam  impingement,  one  of  the  most  common  indications  for  hip 
arthroscopy.  The  cause  of  the  femoral  lesion  was  trauma.  The  duration  of  symptoms  (pain,  impairment  in 
general  health,  and  daily  life  functions)  varied  between  5  and  17  months.  None  of  the  patients  had 
undergone  surgical  treatment  of  the  affected  hip  before.  During  index  arthroscopy,  five  patients  received 
additional treatment in the affected hip: offset reconstruction was performed in five patients, three received 
additional  labral  repair  and  two  partial  resection  of  the  labrum.  Primary  endpoint  was  the  subjective 
improvement  of  symptoms  and  functionality  displayed  in  the  MHHS,  NAHS  and  SF36  at  12  months  after 
ACT3D  compared  to  baseline  (day  before  transplantation).  Patients  who  underwent  Spherox  of  the  hip 
showed  an  overall  improvement  according  to  the  Non-Arthritic-Hip  score  when  comparing  to  baseline 
[median  score  at  baseline:  67.5  %  (SD  22.2);  12  months  after  Spherox:  95.6  %  (SD  4.4)].  6  weeks  after 
surgery no improvement was monitored. 3 months after surgery improved scoring results were noted. At 12 
months after Spherox significant improvement has been noticed (p = 0.02). Patients also showed significant 
improvement in in the Modified-Harris-Hip Score compared to baseline [p = 0.04; median score at baseline: 
74.5  points  (SD  17.2);  12  months  after  Spherox:  98.0  points  (SD  2.8)].  Interpretability  of  this  study  is 
limited  given  the  very  small  number  of  patients  and  lack  of  a  control  group.  No  second-look  arthroscopies 
with chondral biopsies for histomorphological assessment or MRI-scans have been performed. 
Fickert et al (2011) 
This  study  is  an  uncontrolled,  investigator-initiated,  single-centre,  prospective  clinical  trial  to  evaluate  the 
subjective and functional outcome in the treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee during the 
1-year follow-up period. According to the Applicant, this study has been conducted according to Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP). Thirty-six patients with chondral lesions of knee with defect size between 1.0 – 12.0 cm2 and 
one patient in whom the knee joint defect size was not assessed were enrolled to receive Spherox treatment. 
The  location  of  the  lesion  was  either  patella-femoral  (43.2%)  or  femoral  condyle  (48.6%),  three  of  the 
patients  (8.1%)  having  both  defect  types.  Over  half  of  the  patients  (54.1%)  enrolled  had  had  previous 
surgical operation in the affected knee.

The MOCART score was assessed by two independent readers in 20 patients at three months and 14 patients 
at  12  months  post-transplantation  (Table  4).  The  similar  assessment  was  received  from  both  readers,  the 
results  after  12  months  being  improved  compared  to  the  results  at  three  months  from  transplantation. 
However, the overall improvement (approximately 70 of 100 points at 12 month time point) between three 
and 12 months was not statistically significant. The filling of the defect was assessed to be approximately 15 
of 20 points and the integration 12.3 of 15 at 12 months post-transplantation. After one year, bone marrow 
oedema was still present in eight patients. The subchondral lamina was not intact in 6 patients and was intact 
in 8 patients. 
Assessment of defect repair with the MOCART score at 3 and 12 months after  
transplantation of spheroids 
Statistically significant increases in the IKDC score from 44.0 points at baseline to 64.0 points at 12 months 
after ACT3D were seen. The maximal improvement was reached after 6 months and remained constant up to 
12 months. For seven patients no IKDC ratings were available. Tegner score improved from median 1 point 
(range  0  –  7  points)  to  4  points  at  12  months  after  transplantation.  The  improvement  was  statistically 
significant.  The  statistically  significant  improvement  between  baseline  and  12  months  was  reached  in 
additional  three  endpoints,  Lysholm  score,  VAS  for  pain,  and  SF-36-physical.  The  fastest  improvement  and 
plateau  was  reached  at  six  month  time-point  with  only  minor  change  seen  thereafter.  The  deviation  in  the 
obtained scores was not seen between the readers. Given the structured follow up and outcome, the results 
from this study may support proof of concept.

Changes in self-administered assessment scores from baseline (day before transplantation) to 
post-transplantation visit at 12 months (Fickert et al, 2011) 
Rössing et al (2010) 
This  was  an  uncontrolled,  prospective  investigator-initiated  study.  The  study  included  43 patients,  29 male 
and  14  female  (The  mean  age  of  the  patients  was  42.5  years  (range  18  –  50).  Transplantation  of  Spherox 
was  performed  via  full  arthroscopic  technique.  Mean  size  of  chondral  lesion  was  4.7  cm2  (2.5-9.5)  and  the 
dose of spheroids was 6-116.8/cm2. Pre and post-surgery evaluations were performed with WOMAC, Tegner 
score and Lysholm Gillqvist score. Mocart/MRI evaluation was performed after 12 months. The follow-up was 
24  months.  The  study  showed  improvement  in  all  assessment  scores  after  one  year  and  further  slight 
improvement  after  2  years.    The  Spherox  dose  varied  greatly  in  the  patients  treated  in  the  study  (6-116). 
There  was  no  mentioning  of  defect  location  or  diagnosis.  Outcome  evaluations  did  include  MRI  but  after 
relatively short follow-up time. The study was presented as a conference poster and has not been published. 
Maiotti et al (2012) 
This was an uncontrolled, prospective investigator-initiated study. The study included 23 patients18 male and 
5  female.  (The  mean  age  was  29.2  ±  10.4).  Patients  received  the  product  by  arthroscopy.    The  dose  of 
spheroids  was  not  provided.  The  patient  diagnosis  was  osteochondral  lesions  of  the  knee;  15  patients  with 
lesions  of  the  medial  femoral  condyle,  6  lateral,  and  2  femoral  trochlea  lesions.    Pre and  post-surgery 
evaluations were performed with IKDC, VAS, and Lysholm score. An MRI evaluation was performed at 12 and 
24 months. Median follow up was 39 months (range 36-41). MRI showed complete defect filling in 22 of 23 
patients.  Arthroscopy and biopsies showed good integration and hyaline cartilage. The value of this study is 
quite limited as the dose and defect size are unknown. It is also not known how many patients completed the 
study.  
Schreyer et al (2010) 
This was a prospective investigator initiated study without controls performed between 1998-2009. The study 
included  70  patients,  41  male  and  29  female  (mean  age  38  years).  Patients  were  selected  to  one  of  three

treatment  groups;  Group  1:  40  patients  received  the  product  with  periosteal  flap  coverage  Group  2:  14 
patients  received  Spherox  by  an  open  operation  procedure  Group  3:  16  patients  received  Spherox  by  an 
arthroscopical procedure.  Dose of spheroids was unknown.  Pre and post-surgery evaluations performed with 
DGKKT  score,  HSS  score,  Tegner  score  and  Lysholm  score.    No  Mocart/MRI  evaluation  and  histology  were 
performed. Follow up was 48 months. All scores improved compared to baseline. MRI should complete defect 
fill in 6 months.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  applicant  submitted  altogether  218  literature  references  mostly  of  the  published  studies  with 
conventional ACT treatment and another ACT3D treatment Hyalograft. Eleven reports related to the efficacy 
of  the  ACT3D  Spherox.  These  consisted  of  only  one  peer  reviewed  research  paper,  the  rest  being  case 
studies,  conference  posters,  and  study  reports  without  detailed  information  of the  conducted  study.  Only  in 
one  study  active  comparator,  co.don  chondrotransplant  cell  suspension  product  (Applicant´s  own 
investigational product), was used. These 11 studies/reports add up to 255 patients treated with Spherox. In 
addition, at the time of the initial submission, more than 3,600 patients had been treated in six EU countries; 
however, no data on these patients were provided. 
The  inclusion  criterion  in all  controlled  studies  was  grade  III  to  IV  ICKD  or  3/4  in  Outerbridge  scale  for  the 
severity of the chondral lesion in all studies presented. The surgical technique was arthroscopic implantation, 
except  in  the  study  by  Fickert  et  al,  2011  where  open  medial  arthrotomy  was  used  and  in  Schreyer  et  al, 
2010 study where both open procedure and arthroscopic technique was used for the Spherox transplantation. 
Miniarthrothomy  was  applied  also  in  three  patients  in  Schreyer  et  al,  2006  study  and  in  36  patients  in 
Ruhnau, 2008 study as well as in 10 patients reported by Baum, 2008. In total, arthroscopy was used in 125 
patients,  open  miniarthrotomy  in  86  and  open  procedure  in  14  patients.  In  a  retrospective  cod  16  HS  16 
study  of  29  adolescent  patients  the  surgical  technique  was  not  specified.  The  number  of  patients  in  the 
submitted  published  reports  was  relatively  small  ranging  from  6  to  42  subjects  per  report.  The  lack  of 
controlled  studies  was  also  considered  a  problem  since  spontaneous  improvement  and  even  repair  of  the 
smaller  chondral  defects  has  been  described,  which  applies  particularly  to  younger  patients  without 
degenerative changes. Also, the absence of study protocols with regard to all of the submitted studies limited 
the  possibility to  evaluate  how  e.g.  the  missing  data  was  handled  or  how  the  patients  were  selected  to  the 
study.  Only  one  study,  Fickert  et  al,  2011,  provided  in  the  dossier  was  conducted  in  compliance  with  ICH 
GCP,  according  to  the  applicant.  This  study  had  two  independent  readers  for  the  subjective  and  structural 
data.  The  results  in this  study  were  favourable  for Spherox  in  functional  and  structural  and  pain  endpoints, 
but the data of the long-term results, the follow-up period being only one year, or the quality of the repaired 
chondral tissue by histology, was not demonstrated. In addition, no study protocol or individual data listings 
are  available  to  allow  assessment  of  the  validity  of  the  study  results.  The  number  of  associated  surgical 
treatments  both  before  and  during  the  Spherox  treatment  and  the  lack  of  data  regarding  possible  use  of 
rescue pain medication hampered the interpretation of the study results. 
MRI analysis showed complete filling in the majority of patients in four studies (Schreyer et al, 2006; Baum, 
2008; Rössing et al, 2010, and Maiotti et al, 2012) where these results were reported, and adequate filling in 
Alevrogiannis  et  al,  2008  study,  according  to  the  authors.  However,  in  Rössing  et  al,  2010  paper  the 
integration to the border zone was observed only in 55% of patients after one year from the transplantation. 
Overall,  the  results  of  these  studies  should  be  considered  cautiously  since  the  reporting  did  not  fulfil  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017

regulatory standards by lacking the protocol for the prospective study, the information of the consistency of 
the test product and comparative data. In Fickert et al, 2011 study the structural analysis was performed by 
MRI  using  MOCART  score  and  favourable  results  were  obtained  in  the  degree  of  defect  repair  and  filling  as 
well  as  in  the  integration  to  border  zones  by  two  independent  readers.  Unfortunately,  in  this  paper  the 
number of patients reaching complete defect filling and the integration of the repaired tissue, was not given. 
In  structural  studies,  the  histology  was  described  only  from  six  patients  and  the  quality  and  type  of 
neocartilage remained unclear. It is known that the level of hyaline-type of tissue, resembling naïve cartilage, 
has an impact to the strength and functionality of the newly-formed cartilage, and predicts the persistence of 
the  satisfactory  joint  function.  Two  of  the  reports  dealt  with  the  results  obtained  from  the  treatment  of  hip 
and  talus  lesions.  The  applicant  had  not  restricted  the  use  of  Spherox  by  lesion  site  or  medical  history 
underlying the cartilage defect in the proposed indication, which  was  not considered acceptable. One of the 
studies was a report from the retrospectively collected data from the child/adolescent population treated for 
knee cartilage lesion. This study contained also patients with open epiphyseal plate not indicated for Spherox. 
It was considered that more data from the paediatric population would be needed to substantiate the use of 
Spherox in this patient population, hence the current indication is restricted to adults only.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study cod 16 HS14 is a prospective, randomised, open label, multicentre Phase II clinical trial to investigate 
the efficacy and safety of the treatment of large cartilage defects with 3 different doses of Spherox (ACT3D-
CS) in 75 patients. Patients were to be aged between 18—50 years with a single symptomatic ICRS grade III 
or  IV  chondral  lesion  (including  OCD)  between  4  and  10  cm2  of  the  medial  or  lateral  femoral  condyle, 
trochlea, tibia, or a retropatellar defect. A cartilage biopsy was taken prior to randomisation to one of 3 dose 
groups  for  treatment  with  Spherox,  3–7  spheroids/cm2;  10–30  spheroids/cm2;  and  40–70  spheroids/cm2. 
Patients were blinded to their dose. After implantation surgery, patients were recalled for assessments after 6 
weeks, 3, and 6 months, with final assessment after 12 months. Additional follow-up assessments have taken 
place  after  18,  24,  and  36  months  (the  cut-off  point  for  the  present  submission).  Future  assessments  will 
take place after 48 and 60 months, respectively. MRI images were assessed centrally by a blinded reader and 
histological  assessments  performed  centrally  by  a  blinded  pathologist.  Primary  defect  locations  were  mostly 
the patella (47/75) or the femur (28/75); the tibia was not represented. Any additional defects were treated, 
and their results recorded, if they were at the same location. ICRS grades were mostly III C or IV A. 
The study’s primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline to Visit 4 (12 months after implantation 
for each dose group) in ‘overall KOOS’. A test for superiority against baseline (Day before arthroscopy = Day 
0) for the three dose groups (using a dose hierarchy) was performed.  
Study  cod  16  HS13  is  a  prospective,  randomised,  open-label,  active-controlled,  multicentre  Phase  III 
clinical  trial  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  the  treatment  with  the  autologous  chondrocyte 
transplantation product ACT3D-CS with MF in 102 patients with smaller cartilage defects of the knee. Patients 
were  to  be  aged  between  18—50  years  with  a  single  symptomatic  ICRS  grade  III  or  IV  chondral  lesion 
between 1 and <4cm2 of the medial or lateral femoral condyle. After implantation surgery or MF procedure, 
patients  were  recalled  for  assessments  after  6  weeks,  3,  6,  and  12  months  with  the  final  evaluation  of 
superiority  to  be  performed  after  24  months  (to  be  submitted).  Additional  follow-up  assessments  will  take 
place after 36, 48 and 60 months, respectively. MRI images were assessed centrally by a blinded reader and 
histological  assessments  are  performed  centrally  by  a  blinded  pathologist.  ICRS  grades  were  mostly  IV  A, 
followed  by  IIIB  and  IIIA.  The  current  submission  reports  the  12-month  interim  analysis  of  the  primary 
variable ‘overall KOOS’.

The  designs  of  the  studies  are  largely  consistent  with  previously  provided  CHMP  scientific  advice,  including 
the  choice  of  active  comparator  in  the  Phase  III  trial.  However,  the  company  was  recommended  to 
demonstrate a dose-response in Phase II trial given the absence of a suitable comparator for studies in large 
lesions. This has been complicated by the narrow dose range selected for this study. 
Non-interventional  studies  in  paediatric  patients  (cod16HS16  and  cod16HS17):  Paediatric  data 
include  surveillance  studies  with  retrospective  data  collection  were  conducted  in  a  descriptive  manner  in 
adolescent  patients  (14  to  18-years  and  15-  to  18-years  patients  in  cod16HS16  and  cod16HS17  studies, 
respectively). A low number of subjects were available for the analysis (29 FAS subjects in each study) and 
only  small  number  of  subjects  in  each  study  had  verified  closed  epiphyseal  plate  (6  and  12  subjects  in 
cod16HS16 and cod16HS17 studies, respectively). The cod 16 HS16 study was submitted in the initial phase 
of  the  MAA.  In  response  to  the  CAT/CHMP  LoQ,  the  applicant  provided  interim  data  from  the  cod16HS17 
study and the cut-off date for the patients recruited was until the end of January 2016. The follow-up time in 
the cod16HS16 study was up to seven years and in the cod16HS17 study the data was documented for mean 
63.3 months (range 2.5 and 8 years). Wide variety in patient characteristics and disease history was involved 
in  both  studies.  The  lesions  were  classified  as  grade  III  and  IV  lesions  in  both  studies.  The  lesions  in  the 
cod16HS17 study were located mainly in the femur (22), but patients with patellar lesions (6) and lesions in 
tibia (1) were also included. The lesions in cod16HS16 study were the cartilage defects in the knee joint. The 
mean  lesion  size  was  6.8  cm2  (2.3-12  cm2)  and  4.6  cm2  (2.2  –  12  cm2)  and  the  average  number  of 
spheroids  implanted  per  cm2  was  25.1  and  33.8  in  cod16HS16  and  cod16HS17  studies,  respectively. 
Osteochondritis dissecans was the underlying condition in 13 and 14 patients in these studies, respectively. 
In  the  cod16HS17  study  concurrent  surgeries  were  performed  during  biopsy  in  10  patients  and  during 
implantation in 11 patients. In the cod16 HS 16 study further interventions to ipsilateral graft were reported 
for  16  (55%)  patients  who  received  between  1  to  3  interventions  per  patient.  The  endpoints  in  cod16HS16 
study were MOCART, VAS pain score, IKDC, and quality of life (SF-36). The primary analysis according to the 
PIP  in  cod16HS17  study  was  treatment  failure  rate  and  the  secondary  analyses  were  physical  examination, 
IKDC and modified Lysholm scores. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  Study  cod  16  HS14,  the  assessment  of  the  primary  variable  ‘overall  KOOS’  for  the  ITT  population 
showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement,  compared  with  baseline,  in  all  three  within-group  analyses 
(for  the  high-,  medium-  and  low-dose  group  respectively  p  =  0.0010,  0.0001  and  0.0002  one  year  after 
study treatment, and maintained up to 3 years. For all dose groups combined, the mean overall KOOS rose in 
the first year after treatment from 57.0 to 73.4 on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) and continued to rise 
slightly,  reaching  77.0  after  36  months.  Changes  within  each  dose  group  were  of  similar  magnitude  and 
between-group  (pairwise)  analyses  did  not  reveal  any  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  dose 
groups. At the 12-month assessment, KOOS subscores also generally showed within-group improvements – 
mostly with p <0.05 – while between-group comparisons did not show any significant difference. Between the 
24-month  and  36-month  visits  most  KOOS  values  –  overall  and  subscores  showed  a  small  increase,  in  the 
order of 2–3 percentage points.  
Structural MRI evaluation by MOCART scoring was not assessed before study treatment but showed modest 
numeric  improvement  over  time  without  notable  differences  between  the  dose  groups.  The  mean  MOCART 
total scores – on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) – after 3 months were 59.8, 64.5 and 64.7 for the low-
dose, medium-dose and high-dose group respectively, and 62.9 for ‘all patients’; after 12 months these were 
74.1,  74.5  and  68.8  for  the  respective  dose  groups  and  72.4  for  ‘all  patients’.  After  18,  24  and  36  months 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 93/125 
  
  
after study treatment the scores were maintained: respective dose-group scores after 24 months were 72.2, 
76.0 and 71.2, and 73.3 overall, and after 36 months these were 72.4, 79.6, 72.1 and 74.9 overall. 
Arthroscopic assessment of cartilage repair (ICRS- cartilage repair assessment) after 12 months for a subset 
of 8 patients gave the result ‘normal’ or ‘nearly normal’ in seven cases and ‘abnormal’ in one. Results of the 
R-biopsy  assessments  after  12  months  suggested  that  all  repair  tissues  displayed  hyaline  cartilage 
characteristics to some extent, but that no sample displayed a true hyaline cartilage phenotype. Two out of 7 
R-biopsies  showed  hyaline-like  to  hyaline  cartilage  repair  tissue,  4  out  7  R-biopsies  were  fibrocartilage 
(mixed-type hyaline-fibrocartilage tissue), 1 out of 7 biopsies showed fibrous tissue and one R-biopsy could 
not be evaluated. 
All  patients  in  this  study  underwent  a  strict  rehabilitation  up  through  3  months  after  transplantation.  Thus, 
the  total  effect  measured  in  this  trial  would  be  the  combination  of  the  intervention  under  study  and  the 
rehabilitation  programme.  Also,  while  KOOS  was  used  as  an  patient  reported  outcome  instrument  of  knee 
symptoms with a look-back period of one week, patients were allowed to use paracetamol monotherapy (max 
4 g/day) up to the morning of the visit day as well as the use of oral and/or topic NSAIDs (or combinations of 
paracetamol and NSAIDs) during the trial up to a week before each visit. It was viewed that the use of these 
concomitant  pain  medications  might  have  impacted  the  KOOS  rating  and  the  Applicant  was  requested  to 
address  this.  In  response,  the  Applicant  conducted  subgroup  analyses  comparing  patients  with  and  without 
pain  medication.  The  change  in  KOOS  from  baseline  was  lower  in  the  subgroup  with  pain  medication  but 
showed  improvement in  both  groups,  with  a  mean change  from  baseline  in  KOOS  of  9.5  vs.  19.4  at  Visit 4 
(12 months) and 10.5 vs. 24.3 at Visit 7 (36 months).  
Eleven patients still used pain medication at 36 months. The reasons are not fully clear but do not appear to 
be  explainable  by  defect  size.  In  addition,  a  review  of  the  data  listings  did  not  indicate  a  preponderance  of 
femur lesions; four of the patients had a primary cartilage defect located at the femur whereas the remainder 
had  a  patellar  lesion.  Overall,  the  majority  of  these  patients  tended  to  show  a  decrease  in  pain  medication 
over time. 
The  Applicant  was  also  requested  to  address  the  apparent  absence  of  a  dose-response  e.g.  by  exploring  a 
dose response relationship on a continuous scale. The Applicant provided the requested analysis both for the 
ITT and the PP population. The results were very similar and no evidence of a dose response relationship was 
present. The reasons for this are not clear. It seems possible that the lack of dose-response is partly due to 
the deviation from the randomised treatment that occurred in this study; in particular, in the high dose group 
there  were  a  number  of  patients  who  did  not  receive  their  dose  as  planned  due  to  the  fact  that  the 
chondrocyte culture did not generate the required number of spheroids and/or that the estimation of actual 
defect size had been insufficiently accurate.  
In Study cod 16 HS13, in the 12-month interim analysis of the primary variable ‘overall KOOS’ for the ITT1 
population, both Spherox (ACT3D-CS) and the comparator MF showed a statistically significant improvement 
relative to baseline. For patients treated with ACT3D-CS the mean overall KOOS score rose from 56.6 ± 15.4 
at  baseline  to  78.7  ±  18.6  at  Visit  4  12  months  later  (change  from  baseline  22.2  ±  18.3),  while  for  those 
treated by MF this score rose correspondingly from 51.7 ± 16.5 to 68.1 ± 18.6 (change from baseline 16.4 ± 
15.1).  These  12-month  results  for  MF  are  consistent  with  those  reported  previously  for  MF  in  a  similar 
population (e.g. Saris et al, 2009) as shown below.

Mean improvement from baseline in overall KOOS) and KOOS subdomains to month 36  
CCI, characterized chondrocyte implantation using a cell therapy product; MF, microfracture 
From: Saris et al. Characterized chondrocyte implantation results in better clinical outcome at 36 months in a randomized 
trial compared to microfracture. Am J Sports Med. 2009;37 (Supp 1):10S-19S). 
According to the between-group comparison conducted in the 12-month interim analysis for study cod 16 HS 
13, the ACT3D-CS treatment passed the test of significant non-inferiority compared with MF (point estimate 
of  5.7)  but  in  spite  of  a  numerically  better  outcome  was  not  found  to  be  statistically  significantly  superior. 
Results for the PP population were consistent with the primary analysis. 
Structural MRI evaluation  by MOCART scoring was assessed at Visits 2 (3 months) and 4 (12 months). The 
overall  MOCART  score  showed  a  modest  numerical  improvement  from  Visit  2  to  Visit  4  in  both  treatment 
groups,  being  67  for  the  ACT3D-CS  group  and  62  for  the  MF  group  at  Visit  2  (3  months),  improving 
respectively to 81 and 77 at Visit 4 (12 months). Other structural assessments are currently not available as 
the second-look arthroscopy and R-biopsy procedures (in consenting patients) are planned for the 24 month 
after implantation/microfracture visit. 
Similar to the Phase II trial, the impact of the rehabilitation programme and concomitant pain medication use 
needed to be further discussed for this study in order to facilitate the interpretation of the trial results. The 
Applicant  was  requested  to  address  elements  such  as  the  potential  for  spontaneous  improvement  in  KOOS 
symptoms over the course of time, the degree and sustenance of KOOS benefit that can be derived from a 
rehabilitation  program  such  as  the  one  used in  the two  pivotal  studies,  and  the  impact of  concomitant pain 
medication. The Applicant has explained that cartilage in adult patients has limited self-healing capacity due 
to  its  avascular  and  aneural  nature.  There  is  a  lack  of  systematic  data  in  relation  to  the  natural  history  of 
untreated primary cartilage lesions in particular for the first few years after the defect has occurred, as these 
early stages may not be associated with pain or other symptoms.  
It  was  sufficiently  clarified  that  the  standardized  rehabilitation  program  (up  to  3  months)  was  very  similar 
between the ACT3D-CS and MF treatment arms. 
The Applicant conducted a subgroup analysis based on the use of concomitant pain medication that showed 
similar  results  for  ACT3D-CS  as  compared  to  the  Phase  II  study,  namely  that  both  subgroups  improved, 
although  with  a  numerically  lower  improvement  at  12  months  follow-up  in  patients  taking  pain  medication 
(gain of 12.1 KOOS points) compared to patients taking no pain medication (24.2). This numerical difference 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 95/125 
 
  
  
in KOOS outcome between the subgroups was not observed in the MF arm but it should be considered that 
the number of patients still using pain medication at Visit 4 was quite small.  
Regarding structural outcome measures, while MOCART scores showed modest numeric improvements after 
treatment in both studies, there was no correlation between the KOOS and MOCART outcome measures. In 
addition,  in  study  cod  16 HS  13,  a  substantial  proportion  of  MOCART  overall  scores  appeared  to  have  been 
missing. This relates to missing assessments of some items that contributed to the overall MOCART score.  
The lack of correlation between clinical and radiological outcomes after surgical interventions for cartilage in 
the current studies is consistent with previous findings and published literature. The reasons for this are likely 
multifactorial but currently insufficiently understood. 
Results  of  the  R-biopsy  assessments  after  12  months  suggested  that  all  repair  tissues  displayed  hyaline 
cartilage  but  no  sample  displayed  a  true  hyaline  cartilage  phenotype.  Results  from  the  Phase  III  study  are 
not yet available and will be provided post-marketing. 
In  the  Phase  III  study  cod  16  HS  13,  duration  of  knee  symptoms  was  recorded  only  for  a  subgroup  of 
patients,  39  patients  of  the  ACT3D-CS  group  and  40  patients  of  the  MF  group.  The  other  patients  of  the 
treatment  groups  did  not  report  and/or  did  not  recall  the  duration  of  symptoms  during  screening.  The 
duration  of  symptoms  for  these  patients  was  unknown.  According  to  a  recent  review  (Mithoefer  et  al, 
Cartilage. 2011;2[2]:100-21) several studies have demonstrated that ‘age of the defect’, that is, time since 
onset  of  the  cartilage  injury  of  more  than  12  to  36  months,  had  a  clear  negative  effect  on  both  MF  and 
cellular  therapy  outcomes.  However,  the  Applicant  provided  an  analysis  of  overall  KOOS  by  duration  of 
symptoms for the category ≤ 1 year und > 1 year which did not show any relevant differences between the 
subgroups. 
Further justification was also requested regarding the defect location. No patients with primary tibia plateau 
or  hip  lesions  were  included  in  the  pivotal trials.  In  particular  for  the  hip, literature  data  on  the  use  of ACT 
appeared  to  be  limited  (Körsmeier  2014)  and  this  is  reflected  in  the  very  limited  data  submitted  by  the 
Applicant.  It  would  appear  that  prospective-randomized  studies  with  a  larger  cohort  of  patients  and  longer 
follow-up  periods  would  be  needed  to  clarify  the  comparative  value  of  ACT3D-CS  in  comparison  with  other 
treatment  options  for  chondral  defects  of  the  hip.  This  has  been  agreed  by  the  Applicant  and  tibia  and  hip 
lesions have been removed from the sought indication accordingly.  
Autologous chondrocyte implantation after failed microfracturing appears to be associated with a significantly 
higher failure rate and inferior clinical outcome when compared with ACI as a first-line treatment (Pestka JM, 
et al. Am J Sports Med. 2012:40(2):325-31). Thus, the relevance of prior treatment of the cartilage defect on 
the outcome of second line ACI was to be further discussed. However, no patients failing prior treatment with 
MF were included in the pivotal trials. Subgroup analyses indicated similar benefit in terms of KOOS change 
from baseline in the subgroups previous surgery yes/no. 
The proportions of patients not reaching clinically relevant improvement (i.e. treatment failure) of the overall 
KOOS  score  (>8  points  improvement)  in  Spherox  group  was  substantial  both  in  Phase  2  and  3  trials,  36% 
and 31%, respectively. Furthermore, a number of subjects reached worse results in overall KOOS at 1-year 
time point compared to the baseline. This was further discussed by the Applicant, clarifying that 10 subjects 
from  Phase  II  and  4  patients  from  Phase  III  reached  worse  results  in  overall KOOS  at  the  1-year  follow-up 
compared  to  baseline  but  5  of  these  10  Phase  II  patients  showed  improvement  in  KOOS  (as  compared  to 
baseline) when a longer follow-up period was used and 2 other patients were lost to follow-up. The Applicant 
was also requested to clarify the correlation between the cases of failures and the quality of the implant (cell 
growth  rate,  biomarker  data),  localization  and  size  of  the  lesion  (Phase  2),  and  baseline  KOOS  score  level.

According to the applicant, 40 out of 120 patients (Phase II + Phase III) were non-responders at the 1-year 
follow-up  but  it  is  expected  that  the  newly  defined  ranges  and  limits  implemented  in  the  manufacturing 
process will reduce the non-responder rate as 24 out of these 40 non-responders would not have passed the 
newly  defined  limits  and  ranges  for  process  parameters,  in-process  controls  or  release  parameters.  The 
adjusted operational ranges and limits will be implemented in the manufacturing process and assessed by a 
new process validation, which is part of the condition required by the CAT/CHMP.  
Spherox  has  been  used  in  several  European  countries  besides  Germany,  from  2004  up  to  the  end  of  2012 
according to the transitional period as defined in Article 29 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007. However, 
with  regard  to  the  pivotal  studies,  very  few  patients  enrolled  outside  Germany.  Thus,  an  analysis  of 
differences in primary outcome based on country was not meaningful. 
In addition to the pivotal Phase II and III studies, the applicant provided additional supportive data consisting 
of 4 retrospective studies and additional literature references in response to the Day 120 LoQ. These offered 
some supportive evidence in favour of the efficacy of Spherox. 
The quality of the available literature on chondral injuries in the paediatric knee is poor, is usually limited to 
small case series and there is a lack of comparative trials.  
In addition to the already submitted retrospective data collection cod 16 HS 17 paed, the applicant provided 
an  interim  report  for  paediatric  investigation  cod  16  HS  17  paed  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  and  linked 
efficacy of Spherox in paediatric patients from 15 to less than 18 years of age at the time of implantation, in 
the context of a paediatric investigation plan.  
The  results  in  cod16HS16  suggested  overall  favourable  result  and  sustained  treatment  effect  in  up  to  7 
patients by IKDC score, the increase in mean MOCART score in few patients having MRI results, decrease in 
VAS  pain  and  increase  in  SF36  physical  functioning,  but  decrease  in  SF36  mental  health  score.  Altogether, 
these results were not informative due to very small number of patients (5-8 at baseline).  
The  interim  results  from  the  study  cod16HS17  showed  additional  surgery  overall  in  5  patients  (17.2%), 
concerning the affected knee in 2 patients and other surgery in 3 patients. Mean time period from treatment 
to  surgery  was  34.3  months.  According  to  the  Applicant  the  treatment  failure  was  seen  only  in  one  patient 
with closed epiphysis. In the physical examination (23 patients) none of the patients showed knee effusion or 
Baker’s  cyst.  Five  patients  experienced  pressure  pain  and  in  one  patient  patellar  motion  was  abnormal.  In 
evaluated  22  patients  the  mean  IKDC  subjective  knee  evaluation  score  was  81.1,  which  represents  a  good 
IKDC  grade  in  treatment  outcome.  The  knee  alignment  was  normal  in  all  except  one  of  23  patients  and 
patella position in all except one patient. In general, the physical examination produced normal result in 12 
patients  and  nearly  normal  in  9  patients,  while  the  result  was  missing  in  two  patients.  Mean  modified 
Lysholm score was 21.0 in 22 patients. The results of this study are confounded by the missing scores in six 
to seven patients in different evaluations and high heterogeneity of the study population, having possibly an 
impact to the results. 
Overall,  these  data  provide  a  limited,  descriptive  indication  that  the  patients  are  doing  well  after  the 
procedure.  Data  regarding  patients  with  open  epiphysis  are  very  limited,  hence  the  indication  cannot  be 
granted  for  treatment  of  children  or  adolescents.  Accordingly,  the  use of  Spherox  in  patients  <  18  years  of 
age is no longer part of the refined indication.  
It  should  be  considered  that  a  substantial  part  of  the  available  long-term  data  originates  from  a  patient 
population with patellar non-weight-bearing lesions. These patients constituted more than 60% of the patient 
population in the Phase II trial, whereas only 20 patients with femur lesions with defect size 4-6.99 cm2 and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 97/125 
  
  
8  patients  with  larger  defect  sizes  of  7-10  cm2  were  included.  A  subgroup  analysis  of  the  data  showed  a 
numerically lower mean change from baseline in KOOS for femur lesions compared to patella, regardless of 
lesion size stratum, but the improvements in both groups are however clinically relevant. Nevertheless, given 
the limited sample size of weight-bearing femur lesions for which long-term data is available, the 24-month 
data of the cod 16 HS 13 Phase III study in femur condyle lesions will provide valuable additional information 
on clinical as well as structural outcome measures. 
Whereas  the  current  data  provide  sufficient  proof  of  efficacy  in  the  approved  indication,  the  applicant  will 
conduct the long term follow up Phase III study, as requested by the CAT/CHMP. As these uncertainties are 
considered key to the benefit-risk of the product, the submission of the study data is made condition to this 
MA. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  applicant  has  provided  the  available  efficacy  data  from  the  ongoing  Phase  II  and  III  trials  as  well  as 
supportive data from retrospective studies and publications from the literature. These data are supportive of 
the clinical efficacy of Spherox and the benefit-risk is considered positive for the revised indication. 
The CAT/CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): 60-month follow-up data for study cod 16 HS 13. 
In order to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of Spherox vs. microfracture in patients with cartilage 
defects  of  the  knee  with  a  defect  size  between  1  and  <  4  cm2,  the  MAH  should  conduct  and  submit  the 
results of the ongoing prospective, randomised, open label, multicentre study. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Clinical experience with Spherox derives from two pivotal clinical trials (phase II cod 16 HS14 and phase III 
cod  16  HS13),  and  sixteen  supportive  clinical  investigations.  Additionally,  there  is  post-marketing  data 
derived from an exposure of approximately 8 000 patients. 
Patient exposure 
General  tabular  overview  of  clinical  investigations  with  Spherox  in  the  knee  and  hip  is  included  in  section 
2.4.1. The below tables outline the data on patient exposure to Spherox treatment.

HS14). 
Exposure  to  the  test  product:  Dose  administered  (safety  population)  Phase  III  clinical  trial  (cod 
16 HS13) 
The  applicant  claims  that  there  are  in  total  529  patients  with  cartilage  defects  of  the  knee  treated  with 
Spherox.  However,  127  adult  patients  out  of  the  529  patients  were  from  the  two  pivotal  clinical  trials  (75 
patients  in  the  phase  II  and  52  patients  in  the  phase  III)  and  the  other  data  were  from  supportive  clinical 
investigations  (published  case  series,  retrospective  and  prospective  cohort  studies)  of  which  only  one  study 
there  were  GCP  compliant  safety  data  (Fickert  et  al  (2011)).  Thus  the  number  of  patients  with  valid  safety

data  is  127  and  37,  i.e.  164.  This  is  a  limited  number.  The  follow  up  is  also  limited  for  these  patients, 
although the follow-up in supportive studies reach 5 years.

Study  cod  16  HS13  (Phase  III),  adverse  events  by  MedDRA  SOC  and  PT  (MedDRA  Version:  15.1; 
safety population), 12 months 
The applicant presented pooled results from the two pivotal studies at 12 months follow-up. The most 
frequent AE is reported in SOC of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, which is expected after a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 102/125 
 
 
 
  
  
surgical procedure. There are several AE reported only ones or twice, without clustering. The limited number 
of events makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. However, when comparing ACT3D-CS and microfracture 
there are no indication that there are relevant differences between the two treatments.  
There  were  two  AEs  in  SOC  Immune  system  disorders  in  HS13  and  one  similarly  in  HS14  and  there  have 
been plausible causes for hypersensitivity reactions other than Spherox implantation. Furthermore, from the 
phase II (HS14) and the phase III (HS13) studies it can be estimated that the incidence of treatment related 
AEs (ADRs) after biopsy arthroscopy occur at rates 20/75 (26.6%) and 11/52 (21.1%) and after implantation 
arthroscopy  at  rates  28/75  (37.3%)  and  20/52  (38.4%)  in  the  studies  HS14  and  HS13,  respectively.  The 
applicant provided additional information demonstrating that treatment related adverse events were reported 
from  38.4%  patients  receiving  Spheroxs  and  from  52.0%  of  patients  undergoing  microfracturing,  up  until 
week  6  (from  transplantation  or  microfracturing).  Thereby  the  post-operative  safety  profile  of  Spherox 
appears  more  favourable,  compared  to  microfracturing;  and  this  is  even  despite  the  need  for  two 
arthroscopies for Spherox. 
Additionally,  safety  data  from  37  patients  being  treated  in  the  study  by  Fickert  (2011)  can  be  added,  7 
patients experienced a total of 8 AEs during the 12-month follow-up. Two patients reported mild swelling and 
2 patients reported mild knee effusion. The events lasted up to 3 months after transplantation. Two patients 
experienced  moderate  blocking  of  the  knee  joint,  1  patient  at  6  months  after  transplantation  and  1  patient 
throughout  the  follow-up  period.  At  clinical  examination,  no  movement  restriction  was  noted  and  MRI 
examination  did  not  reveal  any  loose  particles.  One  of  these  patients  also  experienced  superficial 
thrombophlebitis. One patient experienced 2 SAEs (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). 
The  retrospective  data,  and  literature  references  to  prospective  studies  do  not  evoke  new  safety  risks,  nor 
does the post-marketing experiences from 8 000 treated subjects. Overall, there are few events reported in 
limited  number  of  subjects  treated  within  prospective  clinical  studies  with  proper  follow-up  of  safety  data, 
although the supportive data does not indicate different safety profile.

There  were  two  SAEs  considered  related  to  the  study  treatment  of  the  Spherox  in  the  phase  II  trial  (two 
episodes  of  chondropathy  in  one  patient  and  arthralgia  in  one  patient).  The  applicant  submitted  additional 
information and cartilage graft hypertrophy was observed in one patient in the two controlled RCTs. Rest of 
the  three  “chondropathies”  observed  had  plausible  explanations  for  not  being  attributable  to  Spherox 
transplantation. Graft hypertrophy is listed as rare undesirable effect in 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Study cod16HS13 
Two serious adverse events were reported in the cod 16 HS 13 at 12 months follow up: 
•  Deep vein thrombosis (resolved, probably treatment-related) 
•  Meniscus lesion (resolved, unlikely to be treatment-related) 
Both  patients  were  in  the  microfracture  group.  No  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  phase  III  trial  considered 
related to the study treatment of the Spherox. 
Fickert et al (2011) 
One 46-year-old female patient experienced 2 SAEs of severe intensity. Directly after surgery, she developed 
deep  vein  thrombosis,  leading  to  pulmonary  embolism.  As  stated in  the  article,  the  events  were  considered 
not related to Spherox by the investigator but rather to the relatively long duration of the surgical procedure 
(148 minutes). The patient recovered.  
No deaths were reported during the phase II and phase III clinical studies, and none have been reported in 
connection with the commercial use of Spherox. 
Immunological events: No data for immunological events were provided. It is agreed that there is low risk of 
activation of the immune system in a typical situation with absence of bleeding or damaged lineage cellular 
surfaces  inside  the  joint. However,  as  58  of  75  subjects  reported  joint  effusion  at  36  months  follow-up  and 
since  joint  effusion  could  be  potentially  considered  as  a  marker  of  local  inflammation,  there  is  a  possibility 
that  immunologic  competent  cells  are  present.  The  compositions  of  joint  effusions  are  not  known,  and 
thereby  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  risk  for  immunological  events,  although  no  intraarticular  infection  or 
bleedings were reported. The occurrence of joint effusion is mainly reported during the first year (90% of the 
joint effusions  in  study  HS14)  and  thereby  it is  reasonable to  claim  that they are  a  result  from the  surgical 
procedure rather than late occurring complications.  
Laboratory findings 
Clinical  laboratory  evaluations  were  performed  in  the  pivotal  studies  cod  16  HS13  and  cod  16  HS14.  Blood 
samples for measurement of standard laboratory values were taken in both trials at screening, three months 
after implantation and 12 months after implantation. Haematology for red-blood-cell count, white-blood-cell 
count  and  platelets  showed  mean  and  median  values  within  the  respective  reference  ranges.  Individual 
values  did  not  lie  substantially  outside  these  ranges.  There  was  in  no  case  any  general  shift  between  the 
three  time  points  of  measurement.  Scatter  plots  and  shift  tables  did  not  reveal  any  tendency  towards  a 
general migration of values. For serum chemistry of hepatic function all mean and median values were within 
the  respective  reference  ranges  (taking  account  of  the  slightly  different  ranges  for  males  and  females). 
Scatter plots and shift tables did not reveal any tendency towards a general migration of values. For serum 
chemistry of metabolism, all mean and median values for triglycerides were within the reference range; for 
cholesterol,  mean  and  median  values  lay  at  the  top  of  the  reference  range,  and  in  some  cases  somewhat 
above  it,  throughout.  In  neither  case  were  any  general  trends  discernible  and  above-range  lipid  values  are

The  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  planned  methods  for  evaluating  the  influence  of  intrinsic  and  extrinsic 
factors on safety outcomes for Spherox in the Phase II and III study programme. There were no differences 
according to implantation in medial or lateral knee, reason for cartilage damage, age (younger or older than 
34 years) or gender. Patients with larger lesions, and lesion in patella were more often reporting AE and TAE. 
The  applicant  also discussed  weight  (dichotomised  under  and  over  80  kg), smoking  status  and  concomitant 
illness, and there are similar rates of AE reported for these groups. 
Paediatric  population:  AEs  reported  in  the  prospective  data  collection  from  the  study  cod  16  HS17  paed  a 
prospective  non-interventional  investigation  to  assess  the  long-term  safety  and  linked efficacy  of Spherox  in

paediatric  patients  from  15  to  less  than  18  years of  age treated  with  the  product  until  December  2011.  The 
full analysis set (FAS) comprised 29 patients for the interim analysis. The time between documentation of the 
data as part of this study and the ACT3D with Spherox ranged between approximately 3.5 and 8 years (mean, 
63.3 months). All AEs/ADRs were reported for 1 patient each. Most AEs were in the SOC ‘musculoskeletal and 
connective  tissue  disorders’  (6  AEs;  6  patients,  21%)  and  the  SOC  ‘injury,  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications’ (4 AEs; 3 patients, 10%). One AE in one patient (3%) was in the SOC ‘general disorders and 
administration site conditions’. 
In  study  cod  16  HS16,  2012  AEs  were  collected  retrospectively  from  2004  to  2011  at  eight  clinical  sites  in 
Germany. In total, 39 patients aged below 18 years were identified as having been treated with Spherox at 
the participating sites. Data from 29 patients were obtained.  
Two  TAE  (symptom  progression  and  no  therapeutic  response)  were  reported  for  1  patient  at  the  1st  visit 
after  9  months.  In  the  same  patient,  additional  4  non-treatment  related  AEs  were  observed,  which 
comprised  undifferentiated  connective  tissue  disease,  arthropathy  and  skeletal  injury  during  the  5th  time 
interval  (78  to  <156  weeks)  and  arthropathy  during  the  6th  time  interval  (156  to  <234  weeks).  The 
remaining 5 non-treatment related AEs in 5 patients comprised infection (13 to <26 weeks), ligament sprain 
(156  to  <234  weeks),  joint  surgery  (52  to  <78  weeks)  and  2  events  of  muscle  atrophy  (1  event  at  13  to 
<26 weeks and 1 event at 7 to <13 weeks). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The  applicant  discussed  the  risk  of  interactions  with  other  pain  medications.  The  number  of  AE  decreases 
during time as expected post-operatively. Regarding the use of corticosteroids, this was an exclusion criterion 
before implantation and no subjects were treated with corticosteroids during the pivotal studies. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No discontinuations due to AEs have been reported. 
Post marketing experience 
Supportive efficacy and safety data from patients treated nationally in routine clinical practice between 2004 
and 2012 were provided, as described in section 2.5. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on the clinical safety 
The proposed use of Spherox relates to the treatment of isolated acute or chronic chondral or osteochondral 
articular  cartilage  defects  of  traumatic  genesis  or  unknown  etiology  in  adults  and  adolescents  with  closed 
epiphyseal growth plate. In the EU, several autologous chondrocyte products including Spherox have been on 
the market under national legislations. Spherox has been on the market in Germany since 2004, and has also 
been available in Belgium, Greece, Italy, Spain and Austria. Spherox has been used in medicinal practice for 
the treatment of cartilage defects up to 10 cm2, classified as Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 or ICRS grade III or 
IV. From a clinical point of view it seems conceivable that Spherox could, potentially, offer safety advantages 
over conventional ACT application, based on the lower invasiveness of the surgical procedure and the lack of 
need for fixation through a periostal flap or use of membrane. Additional safety advantages of Spherox over 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 106/125 
  
  
other  matrix-associated  ACT  methods  could  include  the  absence  of  the  need  for  allogenic  fibrin  glue  and 
exogenous scaffolding materials. 
The available safety results from 127 patients with cartilage defects of the knee from ongoing phase II  and 
phase  III  clinical  trials  do  not  indicate  unexpected  major  safety  issues,  and  observed  AEs/SAEs  are  mainly 
related to surgical complications. Additional data on safety we reported in literature from 37 patients (Fickert, 
2011).  However,  safety  data  of  Spherox  collected  and  registered  systemically  from  clinical  trials  are 
considered  limited.  The  supportive  clinical  investigations  included  published  case  series,  retrospective  and 
prospective  cohort  studies.  A  full  safety  assessment  from  these  supportive  investigations  cannot  be  made, 
due  to  some  limitations  including  risk  of  underreporting.  Nevertheless,  the  supportive  information  together 
with  post-marketing  experience  does  not  reveal  new  safety  concerns.  Safety  profile  of  Spherox  has  been 
adequately described in the Product Information and supportive data is expected from the post-authorisation 
studies. 
For  paediatric  patients  with  knee  cartilage  defect,  safety  information of  Spherox  is  limited  and  based  on  29 
subjects experiencing 10 AEs,  with systemically monitored safety data from one controlled clinical trial (cod 
16 HS17 paed) with mean follow-up 63.3 ± 14.5 months (range: 14-95 months). Although the  follow-up is 
deemed  adequate  the  number  of  patients  is low  and  hence,  it is  not possible  to draw  firm  conclusions.  The 
reported AEs do not indicate a new safety signal in this subpopulation.  
Based on the information from the applicant, it could be concluded that osteoarthritis is a localised condition, 
not a spectrum of systemic diseases. However, this is not the case and the concept of osteoarthritis has been 
further elaborated. The Applicant considers that in the biopsies taken from individuals with predisposition to 
osteoarthritis  of genetic  origin,  the  chondrocytes  would  still  be  able  to  produce  viable  Spheroxs.  This  would 
be possible due to removal of the “osteoarthritic environment” allowing the chondrocytes to produce normal 
hyaline  cartilage  matrix.  This  has  been,  however,  only  investigated  in  vitro  and  there  is  no  clinical  data  to 
support  the  assumption  of  the  Applicant.  Moreover,  the  viable  Spheroxs  would,  again,  meet  the 
“osteoarthritic environment” after transplantation. Therefore diagnosed primary (generalised) osteoarthritis is 
a contraindication.  
Long term follow up of all treated patients in the ongoing clinical study cod 16 HS 13 has been requested by 
the CAT/CHMP in an Annex II condition and the applicant agreed to this. 
From  the  safety  database  all  the  adverse  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  and  post-marketing  have  been 
included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Safety  information  is  limited  and  based  on  127+37  subjects  (cartilage  defects  of  the  knee),  with  limited 
follow-up  (12-36  months).  The  supporting  studies  and  post-marketing  experiences,  even  if  possibly 
underreporting  the  AEs,  do  not  provide  any  signal  for  additional  safety  concern  and  include  follow-up 
exceeding  more  than  5  years.  The  most  important  adverse  events  that  have  been  reported  are  those 
expected for post-operative situation with limited or single cases of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, 
delayed wound healing, joint lock, joint effusion, and joint swelling.  
The CAT/CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): 60-month follow-up data for study cod 16 HS 13.

In order to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of Spherox vs. microfracture in patients with cartilage 
defects  of  the  knee  with  a  defect  size  between  1  and  <  4  cm2,  the  MAH  should  conduct  and  submit  the 
results of the ongoing prospective, randomised, open label, multicentre study. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
The CAT/CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP): 
The PRAC considered that the RMP version 5.0, dated 17 May 2017, is acceptable.  
The  PRAC  also  agreed  that  the  Applicant  should  evaluate  in  the  PSURs  the  data  collected  via  the  annual 
safety and efficacy follow-up questionnaire to health professionals.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP and CAT considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The  applicant  declared  that  spheroids  of  human  autologous  matrix-associated  chondrocytes  has  not  been 
previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union. 
The  CAT/CHMP,  based  on  the  available  data,  considers  Spheroids  of  human  autologous  matrix-associated 
chondrocytes  to  be  a  new  active  substance  as  it  is  not  a  constituent  of  a  medicinal  product  previously 
authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The  results  of  the  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package  leaflet  submitted  by  the 
applicant  show  that  the  package  leaflet  meets  the  criteria  for  readability  as  set  out  in  the  Guideline  on  the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A  request  to  omit  certain  particulars  from  the  labelling  as  per  Art.63.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  has  been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
Only batch number and number of spheroids will be included in the immediate container (application system 
or syringe).  
Both statements ‘Keep out of the sight and reach of children’ and ‘Read the package leaflet before use’ will be 
omitted  from  the  outer  packaging  (pouch),  as  these  are  not  considered  to  be  relevant  for  the  health  care 
professionals.  
The main arguments put forward by the company are: 
1)  The  product  is  delivered  to  the  clinics  and  applied  by  a  qualified  surgeon  in  a  medical  facility  by 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 109/125 
 
  
  
intraarticular implantation. 
2) The specific manufacturing process is not allowing for a sticker to be applied to immediate containers 
3) The very small size of the immediate containers 
4)  The  outer  packaging  should  not  be  opened  before  utilisation  of  the  product  to  prevent  microbiological 
contamination. 
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes  published  with  the  EPAR  on  EMA  website,  and  translated  in  all  languages  but  will  appear  in  grey-
shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
A  request  to  omit  certain  particulars  from  the  package  leaflet  as  per  Art.63.3  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  has 
been  submitted  by  the  applicant  and  has  been  found  unacceptable  by  the  QRD  Group  for  the  following 
reasons: 
The  Group  rejected  the  proposal  to  exclude  section  5  ‘How  to  Store  X’  from  the  leaflet  because  the  leaflet 
could potentially be used by Health Care Professionals as a source of information. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Spherox (spheroids of human autologous matrix-
associated chondrocytes) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance. 
Therefore  the  summary  of  product  characteristics  and  the  package  leaflet  includes  a  statement  that  this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Articular  cartilage  is  a  complex  structure  that  has  an  important  function  in  load-bearing  joints  and  joint 
mobility.  These  characteristics  are  determined  mainly  on  the  composition  of  cartilage  and  particularly  its 
extracellular  matrix  whose  production  the  chondrocytes  are  involved  in.  The  integrity  of  the  extracellular 
matrix  is  essential  for  the  mechanical  and  structural  capacity  of  the  cartilage.  Due  to  the  lack  of  blood  or 
lymphatic vessels in the cartilage, cell infiltration does not occur and the capacity of the defect to heal after 
trauma  is  reduced.  Without  a  surgical  intervention  the  risk  for  the  development  of  arthrosis  is  present.  A 
cartilage lesion can reduce the joint function, cause pain and swelling of the joint. 
The proposed indication of Spherox is: 
“Repair  of  symptomatic  articular  cartilage  defects  of  the  femoral  condyle  and  the  patella  of  the  knee 
(International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III or IV) with defect sizes up to 10 cm2 in adults.” 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 110/125 
 
  
  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Cartilage lesions such as in the knee commonly occur, mostly due to trauma. Articular cartilage has limited 
capacity  for  intrinsic  repair  and  may  result  in  fibrous  tissue  or  fibrocartilage,  which  has  inferior  properties 
compared to normal healthy hyaline cartilage. Deep lesions till the subchondral bone (Outerbridge scale III-
IV)  may  lead  to  osteoarthritis  at  young  age,  if  left  untreated.  Surgical  approaches  to  repair  damaged 
cartilage  such  as  microfracture  (MF)  are  limited  by  the  production  of  fibrocartilaginous  tissue,  which  is  less 
resistant  than  natural  cartilage.  In  addition,  microfracture  is  less  suitable  for  treating  larger  lesions 
(exceeding ~4 cm²). ACI (autologous chondrocyte implantation) is an alternative treatment option whereby 
extra-corporal cultivated autologous chondrocytes are implanted in the chondral focal lesions with the aim to 
form  hyaline  cartilage.  The  first  generation  ACI  products  utilised  autologous  chondrocytes  as  a  cell 
suspension,  administered  under  periosteal  flap  or  biodegradable  membrane.    One  of  the  limitations  of 
traditional  ACI  has  been  that  the  quality  of  the  neocartilage  has  been  mostly  fibrocartilage  type  of  tissue, 
which is considered to be less durable resulting in compromised treatment results in long-term. Furthermore, 
the  use  of  a  periosteal  flap  has  turned  out  problematic,  since  it  requires  an  additional  surgical  intervention 
and in some cases the use of a flap has induced hypertrophic growth of the treated cartilage. In an attempt 
to achieve repair tissue more similar to native articular cartilage, development of ACI has progressed to the 
third generation, in which autologous cells are cultured in a 3-dimensional (3D) matrix before implantation, 
such as Spherox. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In  comparison  with  the  conventional  cell  suspension  products,  Spherox is  able  to  adhere to the  defect  area 
and  thus,  exogenous  fixation  with  a  periosteal  flap  is  not  required.  Since  it  can  be  applied  in  a  minimal 
invasive arthroscopic procedure, operation time can be shortened. Traditionally, chondrocytes from articular 
biopsies  have  a  low  potential  for  proliferation  and  after  repeated  passaging  the  number  of  cell  divisions 
decrease,  and  eventually  the  cells  dedifferentiate.  With  Spherox,  the  cells  are  expanded  first  in  2D 
conditions,  and  then  cultured  in  an  environment  that  enhances  3D  growth  of  the  cells  into  aggregates  and 
accumulation  of  cartilage-type  ECM  proteins  into  spheroids.  It  appears  that  these  cells,  while  highly 
dedifferentiated  after the  2D  culture,  still  retain  their  re-differentiation  capacity  when  taken  into  the  proper 
environment.  In  addition,  autologous  serum  is  used  in  the  cell  culture.  No  other  human  or  animal-derived 
exogenous  material  is  used  during  the  manufacturing  process,  which  minimises  the  risk  of  cell 
transformation.  
In  nonclinical  studies,  the  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  characterisation  of  Spherox  demonstrated  that  human 
chondrocytes  are  capable  of  producing  three  dimensional  spheroids  that  upon  implantation  into  a 
chondrogenic  environment  either  in  vitro  or  in  vivo,  fuse  together,  remodel,  migrate,  fill  up  the  space 
between the spheroids and the cracks and fissures in the cartilage defect with de novo hyaline like cartilage 
and  extracellular  matrix.  The  mode  of  action  was  demonstrated  in  in  vitro  cartilage  explants  and  in  vivo  in 
subcutaneously implanted cartilage explants. This was further corroborated with the data from a large animal 
model,  minipig,  demonstrating  formation  of  hyaline-like  cartilage  repair  tissue  in  the  defects  after  two 
months  post-implantation  although  long  term  evaluation  of  efficacy  and  safety  in  the  orthotopic  femoral 
condyle cartilage defect model in the Merino sheep failed to show any evidence of repair tissue at six months 
post-implantation.

Interim data from the pivotal Phase III study cod 16 HS13 (ACT3D-CS versus MF in patients with 1-<4 cm2 
cartilage defects of the femoral condyle) showed an improvement in patient symptoms and function in both 
treatment  groups.  In  the  12-month  interim  analysis  of  the  primary  variable  ‘overall  KOOS’  for  the  ITT1 
population, both Spherox (ACT3D-CS) and the comparator MF showed a statistically significant improvement 
relative to baseline. For patients treated with ACT3D-CS the mean overall KOOS score rose from 56.6 ± 15.4 
at  baseline  to  78.7  ±  18.6  at  Visit  4  12  months  later  (change  from  baseline  22.2  ±  18.3),  while  for  those 
treated by MF this score rose correspondingly from 51.7 ± 16.5 to 68.1 ± 18.6 (change from baseline 16.4 ± 
15.1)  (p<0.0001  in  both  cases).  The  KOOS  subscores  yielded  the  same  qualitative  result  as  the  full-KOOS 
analysis.  Repetition  of  the  analyses  with  the  PP  population  was  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis. 
Structural MRI evaluation by MOCART scoring was assessed at Visits 2 (3 months) and 4 (12 months). The 
overall  MOCART  score  showed  a  modest  numerical  improvement  from  Visit  2  to  Visit  4  in  both  treatment 
groups,  being  67  for  the  ACT3D-CS  group  and  62  for  the  MF  group  at  Visit  2  (3  months),  improving 
respectively to 81 and 77 at Visit 4 (12 months). Other structural assessments are currently not available as 
the second-look arthroscopy and R-biopsy procedures (in consenting patients) are planned for the 24 month 
after implantation/microfracture visit, which will be followed in the post-authorisation study. Results from the 
IKDC assessments and from the modified Lysholm score were supportive, revealing overall improvements in 
both treatment groups between baseline and Visit 4. 
Three-year data from the Phase II clinical trial cod 16 HS14 (dose-level comparison study in large cartilage 
defects  (4–10  cm²)  at  various  locations  in  the  knee  (femur,  patella))  showed  a  significant  and  sustained 
improvement  in  overall  KOOS  compared  with  baseline,  in  all  three  within-group  analyses  (for  the  high-, 
medium-  and  low-dose  group  respectively  p  =  0.0010,  0.0001  and  0.0002  one  year  after  study  treatment; 
0.0005,  <0.0001  and  0.0002  respectively  after  two  years  and  without  further  change  after  three  years). 
Changes within each dose group were of similar magnitude, and the three between-group (pairwise) analyses 
did not reveal any statistically significant differences between the dose groups. For all dose groups combined, 
the mean overall KOOS rose in the first year after treatment from 57.0 to 73.4 on a scale from 0 (worst) to 
100 (best) and continued to rise slightly, reaching 77.0 after 36 months. At the 12-month assessment, KOOS 
subscores also generally showed strong within-group improvements – mostly with p < 0.05 – while between-
group comparisons did not show any significant difference. 
In  both  studies,  subgroup  analyses  indicated  a  similar  benefit  in  terms  of  KOOS  change  from  baseline 
regardless  of  previous  surgery.  There  was  no  relevant  difference  in  KOOS  outcome  based  on  a  subgroup 
analysis by duration of symptoms. No patients were enrolled who had previously failed treatment with MF for 
their  lesion.  Patients  in  both  studies  underwent  a  strict  rehabilitation  up  through  3  months  after 
transplantation.  This  programme  is  likely  to  have  affected  functional  outcomes.  Thus,  the  total  effect 
measured in the respective studies should be viewed as the combination of the intervention under study and 
the  rehabilitation  programme,  also  implemented  during  the  development.  In  both  studies,  there  was  a 
reduction in the use of concomitant pain medication following treatment. In the Phase II study, 15% of the 
patients treated with ACT3D were using concomitant pain medication at Visit 7 (36 months after treatment) 
as compared with 44% at screening. In the Phase III study, 15% of patients treated with ACT3D and 24% of 
the patients treated with MF were using concomitant pain medication at Visit 4 (12 months after treatment) 
as  compared  with  40%  and  52%,  respectively,  at  screening.  In  both  studies,  patients  treated  with  ACT3D 
who used pain medication showed lower KOOS outcome (also in terms of change from baseline) as compared 
to those patients who did not but in both studies, both pain medication subgroups (yes/no) showed relevant 
gains in KOOS. This, together with the overall decrease in pain medication use over time, is considered to be 
supportive of efficacy.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Regarding structural outcomes, while MOCART scores showed modest numeric improvements after treatment 
in both studies, there was no consistent correlation between the KOOS and MOCART outcome measures. This 
is consistent with published literature and the reason for this is not known.  
Results  of  limited  (n=7)  R-biopsy  assessments  after  12  months  suggested  that  repair  tissues  displayed 
hyaline  cartilage  but  no  sample  displayed  a  true  hyaline  cartilage  phenotype.  The  newly-formed  chondral 
tissue showed variable quality and fibrous tissue or fibrocartilage was seen in most of the samples. The early 
time point  of  the  histological  sampling  however  did not  allow  for  the  analysis of  mature  cartilage  and  there 
were  too  few  samples  (only  3  samples  taken  from  the  weight-bearing  cartilage)  to  be  able  to  draw 
conclusions  on  the  quality  of  the  cartilage.  This,  amongst  other  requirements,  will  be  addressed  by  future 
data  from  the  Phase  III  study  as  it  is  planned  for  biopsies  to  be  obtained  at  24  months  after  treatment. 
Furthermore, considering that the majority of patients (47/75) in the Phase II trial had patellar lesions, i.e., a 
non-weight-bearing location. Longer-term (two- and three-year) active controlled data from the pivotal Phase 
III trial in femoral cartilage lesions will therefore be of value to confirm the durability and adequate quality of 
the newly-generated cartilage in weight-bearing joint lesions in full physical activity to guarantee normal joint 
functionality. 
Structural MRI evaluation by MOCART scoring was not assessed before study treatment but showed a modest 
and sustained numeric improvement over time. The respective dose-group scores after 36 months were 72.4, 
79.6, 72.1 and 74.9 overall. Arthroscopic assessment of cartilage repair (ICRS- cartilage repair assessment) 
after  12  months  for  a  subset  of  8  patients  gave  the  result  ‘normal’  or  ‘nearly  normal’  in  seven  cases  and 
‘abnormal’  in  one.  Results  of  the  R-biopsy  assessments  after  12  months  however  showed  that  all  repair 
tissues displayed hyaline cartilage characteristics to some extent, but that no sample displayed a true hyaline 
cartilage  phenotype.  Biopsy  results  from  the  Phase  III  study  are  not  yet  available.  Thus,  supportive 
information from histological assessments is currently quite limited. 
On  the  quality  side,  there  remain  two  obligations  to  be  addressed  post-authorisation.  These  are  (1)  to 
conduct a prospective process validation study and to review the in process controls and acceptance criteria 
accordingly for key parameters of the manufacturing process (P0 culture time, total monolayer culture time, 
spheroid  culture  time  and  amount  of  synovial  impurities)  and  (2)  to  re-validate  the  potency  assay  and 
monitor its  correlation  with  the  efficacy  outcome.  These  conditions  are  considered  important to  support  the 
consistent manufacture of Spherox finished product with a coherent measure of potency. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Clinical experience with Spherox derives from two pivotal clinical trials (phase II cod 16 HS14 and phase III 
cod  16  HS13),  sixteen  supportive  clinical  investigations,  and  post-marketing  data  from  8  000  patients.  The 
available safety results from 127 patients with cartilage defects of the knee from ongoing phase II and phase 
III  clinical  trials  do  not  indicate  unexpected  major  safety  issues,  and  observed  adverse  events/serious 
adverse  events  are  mainly  expected  post-operatively.  In  the  phase  III  study,  comparison  of  Spherox  and 
microfracture showed no differences in AE profile based on the available results from 1-year after treatment; 
and  in  the  phase  II  study  there  was  no  sign  of  increased  rate  of  AE  over  time  up  to  36  months.  The 
supportive  studies  together  with  post  marketing  experience  do  not  reveal  new  safety  concerns  and  include 
follow-up exceeding 5 years. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017 
Page 113/125 
  
  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data of Spherox collected/registered systemically from clinical trials is still considered limited basically 
based on the 127 and 37 patients with 12-36 months follow-up. The pivotal studies will continue and report 
longer  follow-up,  i.e.  60-months.  The  study  will  evaluate  the  long-term  efficacy  and  safety  of  Spherox  vs. 
microfracture in patients with cartilage defects of the knee with a defect size between 1 and < 4 cm2. 
The  supportive  clinical  investigations  included  published  case  series,  retrospective  and  prospective  cohort 
studies  but  a  full  safety  assessment  from  these  supportive  investigations  cannot  be  made;  due  to  their 
limitations  including  risk  of  underreporting  and  therefore  more  comparable  with  spontaneous  reporting 
system.  
For  paediatric  patients  with  knee  cartilage  defect,  safety  information of  Spherox  is  limited  and  based  on  29 
subjects  experiencing  10  AE,  with  systemically  monitored  safety  data  from  one  controlled  clinical  trial  with 
mean follow-up 63.3 ± 14.5 months (range: 14-95 months). Although the follow-up is deemed adequate the 
number  of  patients  is  considered  insufficient  and  the  originally  applied  for  indication,  which  included 
adolescent patients, was restricted to adults only. 
For patients with hip cartilage defect, safety information of Spherox is limited and based on only 24 patients, 
with no systemically monitored safety data. Hence, the applicant in line with the CAT/CHMP recommendation 
agreed to restrict the indication to remove hip lesions from the applied indication.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In  comparison  with  the  conventional  cell  suspension  products,  Spherox is  able  to  adhere to the  defect  area 
and  thus,  exogenous  fixation  with  a  periosteal  flap  is  not  required.  Since  it  can  be  applied  in  a  minimal 
invasive  arthroscopic  procedure,  operation  time  can  be  shortened,  thus  offering  the  possibility  of  reducing 
surgical complications and optimising the safety profile of the product. In addition, autologous serum is used 
in  cell  culture.  No  other  human  or  animal-derived  exogenous  material  is  used  during  the  manufacturing

process, which minimizes the risk of cell transformation. This may represent a safety advantage. 
One-year  interim  data  from  the  Phase  III  clinical  trial  (ACT3D-CS  versus  MF)  in  patients  with  1-<4  cm2 
lesions  of  the  femoral  condyle  showed  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  the  patient  symptoms  and 
function  as  assessed  by  KOOS  in  both  treatment  groups.  These  improvements  are  considered  clinically 
relevant  and  descriptive  statistical testing  concluded  non-inferiority  of  ACT3D-CS  to  MF  with  regards  to this 
outcome measure. The structural MRI evaluation by MOCART scoring showed improvement up to 12 months 
after  treatment,  with  good  results  in  both  treatment  groups  with  regard  to  defect  repair.  Overall,  these 
results  indicate  that  treatment  with  Spherox  for  improvement  of  patient  symptoms  and  function  is  non-
inferior to that of treatment with MF, and for some outcome parameters, numerically somewhat better.  
In the uncontrolled Phase II clinical trial in patients with large cartilage lesions of the knee (femur, patella, 4-
10  cm2),  maintenance  of  improved  functionality  and  reduction  of  symptoms  without  marked  deterioration 
was  observed  up  to  3  years  after  treatment.  This  was  accompanied  by  improvements  in  MOCART 
assessments.  However,  histological  data  on  the  quality  of  the  regenerated  tissue  are  limited,  with  biopsies 
showing hyaline-like to mixed-type repair tissue. There remains a significant need for chondrocyte products 
for treatment of symptomatic cartilage defects, particularly for larger defects, for which other methods such 
as MF are not recommended. However, there has also been significant utilization of ACI in smaller defects in 
clinical practice in recent years.  
Supportive investigations from routine clinical practice in adults and adolescents were submitted, comprising 
a  rather  heterogeneous  patient  population.  The  ongoing  PIP  (EMEA-001264-PIP01-12)  requires  the  data 
collection  from  80  paediatric  patients  with  closed  knee  epiphyseal  growth  plate  not  later  than  June  2020. 
Consequently,  the  current  data  available,  29  FAS  patients  with  only  12  patients  with  verified  closed 
epiphyseal growth plate in study cod16HS17 would not be adequate for granting the paediatric indication in 
the current MA procedure.  
During the evaluation and on request of the CAT/CHMP, the applicant addressed the concerns with regards to 
the originally applied for broad indication. Cartilage lesions in the tibia, hip, as well as paediatric patients are 
no longer included due to the absence of reliable clinical trial data. This is endorsed by the CAT/CHMP. 
The observed adverse events are expected mainly post-operatively. The procedure with Spherox includes one 
harvest  and  one  implantation,  rendering  the  patient  to  two  sessions  of  surgery,  and  thereby,  an  increased 
number of surgeries could be viewed as a disadvantage. However, the surgery is regarded as less invasive in 
comparison  to  other  described  techniques.  Thereby,  the  procedure  in  total  could  be  regarded  comparable 
when  it  comes  to  the  adverse  events.  Safety  information,  based  on  127  and  37  subjects  with  cartilage 
defects of the knee with follow-up 12-36 months, is limited. However, the available safety results from 127 
patients  from  ongoing  phase  II  and  phase  III  clinical  trials  do  not  indicate  unexpected  major  safety  issues, 
and observed adverse events / serious adverse events are mainly expected post-operatively. In the phase III 
study,  comparison of  Spherox  and  microfracture  showed  no differences  in  AE  profile based on  the  available 
results from 1-year after treatment; and in the phase II study there was no sign of increased rate of AE over 
time up to 36 months. Overall, safety data of Spherox collected/registered systemically from clinical trials is 
considered limited. The supporting studies and post-marketing experiences are suspected to be substantively 
underreporting AEs, nevertheless they do not provide any signal for additional safety concern. As a condition 
to the marketing authorisation, the applicant will follow up patients long term, i.e. 60 months.  
The obligations to conduct post-authorisation measures include two quality-related obligations as follows (1) 
to  conduct  a  prospective  process  validation  study  and  to  review  the  in  process  controls  and  acceptance 
criteria  accordingly  for  key  parameters  of  the  manufacturing  process  (P0  culture  time,  total  monolayer 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/349863/2017

culture  time,  spheroid  culture  time  and  amount  of  synovial  impurities)  and  (2)  to  re-validate  the  potency 
assay and monitor its correlation with the efficacy outcome. These two obligations are justified on the basis 
that the process validation and the validation of the potency assay are both essential to confirm a consistent 
manufacturing  process  and  to  obtain  a  coherent  assay  for  potency  determination  of  the  finished  product.  A 
consistent manufacturing process and a validated potency assay are necessary to deliver in a reliable manner 
the finished product with the demonstrated safety and efficacy. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  benefit/risk  balance  of  Spherox  for  the  sought  indication  is  positive.  In  the  view  of  the  remaining 
uncertainties, the CAT/CHMP requested conditions to be fulfilled in post-marketing phase, see section 4. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Spherox is positive. 
Divergent positions are appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CAT/CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CAT/CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Spherox is favourable in the following indication: 
Repair  of  symptomatic  articular  cartilage  defects  of  the  femoral  condyle  and  the  patella  of  the  knee 
(International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III or IV) with defect sizes up to 10 cm2 in adults. 
The  CAT/CHMP  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the  following

New Active Substance Status 
Based  on  the  CAT/CHMP  review  of  the  available  data,  the  CAT/CHMP  considers  that  spheroids  of  human 
autologous  matrix-associated  chondrocytes  is  considered  to  be  a  new  active  substance  as  it  is  not  a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

Divergent Positions - Spherox (EMEA/H/C/002736/0000)  
The undersigned members of CAT did not agree with the CAT’s opinion recommending the approval of the 
granting of a Marketing Authorisation for Spherox. Based on the review of the data and the applicant’s 
response to the CAT and CHMP LoQ, LoI on quality, safety, efficacy and risk management plan, it is 
considered that the application for  
Spherox, in the treatment of repair of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and the 
patella of the knee (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III or IV) with defect sizes up to 10 
cm2 in adults 
is not approvable due to a negative benefit/risk profile.  
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
•  Spherox has been studied in two clinical trials: Phase II study was an open label, non-controlled dose 
escalation study in large lesions and the Phase III study was a randomised controlled study for small 
lesions (<4cm2), using microfracture (MF) as the comparator. The clinical outcome was assessed 
using a validated KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) scoring, including subscales 
for Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) 
and knee related Quality of life (QOL). According to EMA guideline on In-vitro cultured chondrocyte 
containing products for cartilage repair of the knee (CAT/CPWP/568181/2009) the clinical efficacy 
results in small lesions should demonstrate clinical superiority over MF or non-inferiority over MF, if 
structural superiority can be demonstrated at the time of MAA. Both clinical studies demonstrate 
some improvement in clinical data when mean results are compared with those of baseline, however, 
only clinical non-inferiority to MF could be demonstrated in the Phase III study. From a subgroup 
analysis superiority could be identified for the quality of life subscore, however, the patients were 
allowed to use maximum pain medication up to the day when the questionnaire was filled in and the 
use of pain medication was not systematically followed or documented for the entire patient 
populations.  
To complete the benefit risk assessment the pivotal 24 month data of the phase III study are needed. 
• 
Efficacy based on comparative structural endpoints is not proven. Structural repair has been studied 
by MRI in both studies using MOCART scoring; however, the MOCART baseline results are missing for 
a large number of patients thus hampering the assessment of structural outcome. As part of Phase II 
study biopsies from 8 patients were taken for immunohistochemical analysis, 7 of them were actually 
studied. Out of the seven samples only one showed some level of hyaline cartilage formation, all the 
rest (6/7) containing mainly Collagen I positive mixed fibrous  tissue. Thus superior structural repair 
was not demonstrated for Spherox. Additionally, the number of non-responders in both clinical 
studies was high (>30%) both for Spherox and MF. As Spherox treatment requires two interventions 
when compared to one with MF, the benefit for the patients is not demonstrated. 
•  A clear negative correlation was found for the cell and spheroids culture times and clinical efficacy. 
Also the number of fibroblast impurities (synoviocytes) showed a negative correlation with efficacy. 
However, the in process controls and process parameters have not been defined through a 
prospective process validation and thus the maximum culture times and impurity levels of the 
commercial process remain unjustified. As these quality parameters negatively correlate with efficacy

it cannot be ruled out that the high number of non-responders could be due to an uncontrolled 
process.

Likewise, Absence of validation of the proposed potency assay based on an mRNA surrogate marker 
that can reflect the intended function is critical as potency remains the most relevant parameter to 
ensure a consistent and well controlled autologous product.

Divergent Positions - Spherox (EMEA/H/C/002736/0000)  
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the approval of the 
granting  of  a  Marketing  Authorisation  for  Spherox.  Based  on  the  review  of  the  data  and  the  applicant’s 
response  to  the  CAT  and  CHMP  LoQ,  LoI  on  quality,  safety,  efficacy  and  risk  management  plan,  it  is 
considered that the application for  
Spherox, in the treatment of repair of symptomatic articular cartilage defects of the femoral condyle and the 
patella of the knee (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] grade III or IV) with defect sizes up to 10 
cm2 in adults 
is not approvable due to a negative benefit/risk profile.  
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
• 
Spherox has been studied in two clinical trials: Phase II study was an open label, non-controlled dose 
escalation study in large lesions and the Phase III study was a randomised controlled study for small 
lesions  (<4cm2),  using  microfracture  (MF)  as  the  comparator.  The  clinical  outcome  was  assessed 
using a validated KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) scoring, including subscales 
for Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) 
and  knee  related  Quality  of  life  (QOL).  According  to  EMA  guideline  on  In-vitro  cultured  chondrocyte 
containing  products  for  cartilage  repair  of  the  knee  (CAT/CPWP/568181/2009)  the  clinical  efficacy 
results  in  small  lesions  should  demonstrate  clinical superiority  over  MF  or  non-inferiority  over  MF,  if 
structural  superiority  can  be  demonstrated  at  the  time  of  MAA.  Both  clinical  studies  demonstrate 
some improvement in clinical data when mean results are compared with those of baseline, however, 
only  clinical  non-inferiority  to  MF  could  be  demonstrated  in  the  Phase  III  study.  From  a  subgroup 
analysis  superiority  could  be  identified  for  the  quality  of  life  subscore,  however,  the  patients  were 
allowed to use maximum pain medication up to the day when the questionnaire was filled in and the 
use  of  pain  medication  was  not  systematically  followed  or  documented  for  the  entire  patient 
populations.  
To complete the benefit risk assessment the pivotal 24 month data of the phase III study are needed.

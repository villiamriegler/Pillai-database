2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Tolucombi 40 mg/12.5 mg, 80 mg/12.5 mg and 80 mg/25 mg tablets is a generic medicinal product of 
MicardisPlus, which has been authorised in the EU since 19 April 2002. 
Tolucombi is a fixed-dose combination of the active substances telmisartan, a non-peptide angiotensin II 
receptor  (type  AT1)  antagonist,  and  hydrochlorothiazide,  a  thiazides  diuretic.  Telmisartan  acts  as 
vasodilator  and  reduces  peripheral  resistance.  It  is  given  in  the  management  of  hypertension,  heart 
failure, myocardial infarction and nephropathy. Thiazides such as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) are used in 
the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. 
Telmisartan /hydrochlorothiazide tablets are administered orally for treatment of hypertension. The 
combination of these ingredients has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure to a 
greater degree than either component alone. The effects of fixed dose combination of telmisartan/HCTZ 
on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity are currently unknown. 
The safety and efficacy profile of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide has been demonstrated in several 
clinical trials details of which can be found in the EPAR of MicardisPlus. In addition, there is a long-term 
post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this 
application is a generic application referring to the reference medicinal product MicardisPlus, summary of 
the clinical data of telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide is available and no new clinical studies regarding 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted. 
The approved indication is:  
Treatment of essential hypertension. 
Tolucombi  fixed  dose  combination  (40  mg  telmisartan/12.5  mg  hydrochlorothiazide)  is  indicated  in 
patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on telmisartan alone. 
Tolucombi  fixed  dose  combination  (80  mg  telmisartan/12.5  mg  hydrochlorothiazide)  is  indicated  in 
patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on telmisartan alone. 
Tolucombi fixed dose combination (80 mg telmisartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated in patients 
whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on Tolucombi 80 mg/12.5 mg (80 mg telmisartan/12.5 
mg hydrochlorothiazide) or adults who have been previously stabilised on telmisartan and 
hydrochlorothiazide given separately. 
The indication proposed for Tolucombi is the same as authorized for the Reference medicinal product.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the studies was to develop a generic, bioavailable and stable tablet dosage form of telmisartan 
and  hydrochlorothiazide.  Telmisartan/Hydrochlorothiazide  40/12.5  mg,  80/12.5  mg  and  80/25  mg 
tablets developed by Krka are two layer tablets essentially similar to MicardisPlus 40/12.5 mg, 80/12.5 
mg and 80/25 mg tablets, the innovator product from Boehringer Ingelheim. The development process 
started  with  strength  80/25  mg  and  was  focused  on  the  dosage  form,  where  telmisartan  and 
hydrochlorothiazide  are  physically  separated  to  avoid  compatibility  issues  of  telmisartan  and 
hydrochlorothiazide. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with compendial 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. Satisfactory dissolution data 
and comparative dissolution studies are provided for both substances.  
There are two different immediate packaging: laminated OPA/Al/PVC foil in combination with aluminium 
foil and laminated OPA/Al/PE foil with desiccant in combination with aluminium foil. The suitability and 
compatibility of the chosen packaging material with the bulk tablets, and the compatibility of excipients 
with drug substance is confirmed by performed stability studies.

Adventitious agents 
Statements from producers confirming that the excipients are BSE/TSE free are submitted. 
Manufacture of the product 
All three strengths, 40/12.5 mg tablets, 80/12.5 mg tablets and 80/25 mg tablets are manufactured by a 
standard manufacturing process according to the same manufacturing steps. 
The manufacturing process has been adequately described and the critical steps have been identified. In 
process controls are adequate for this tablet preparation. 
The validation protocol proposed for the full scale batches has been provided and the quality of the 
production batches will be evaluated through the results of in process testing as well as the results of 
finished product testing. 
The batch analysis data of each strength shows that the tablets can be manufactured reproducibly 
according to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral 
preparation. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for appearance, identification 
(HPLC and TLC), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, degradation products (HPLC) 
and microbial quality. 
All analytical procedures and test methods have been adequately described and the validation data 
presented is acceptable.      
Batch analysis results confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is 
capable and under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of batches stored in a container closure systems equivalent to those proposed for marketing 
were provided under long term conditions for up to 12 months (25 ºC/60 % RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerate conditions (40 ºC/75 % RH), in line with ICH guidelines.  
Samples were tested for appearance, related substances, assay, dissolution and microbiological quality. 
Photostability studies were conducted and indicate that drug product is sensitive to light. 
All investigated parameters remain within specified limits. The stability studies provided support the 
shelf-life of 2 years under the storage conditions declared in the SmPC. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non- clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Tolucombi manufactured by Krka d.d., Novo mesto is considered unlikely to result in any 
significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide containing 
products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be 
similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on Non-Clinical aspects  
The CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. The ERA is expected to be similar and 
not increased.  
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects  
The CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. The ERA is expected to be similar 
and not increased. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for tablets containing telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted a bioequivalence study with the highest strength 
telmisartan/HCTZ 80/25 mg under fasting conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the 
assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/84367/2013 
Page 10/19 
  
  
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of telmisartan/HCTZ based on published literature.The SmPC is in line with 
the SmPC of the reference product. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1 in its 
current version is of particular relevance. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant 
has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried 
out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Exemption  
The applicant claims biowaiver for telmisartan/HCTZ 40/12.5 mg and 80/12.5 mg strengths. According to 
the SmPC of the reference product MicardisPlus, the pharmacokinetics of telmisartan is non-linear with 
more than dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUC. As per literature references submitted by the 
applicant, the pharmacokinetics of HCTZ is linear over the dose range of 12.5 mg to 25 mg. According to 
the SmPC, the reference product can be taken with and without food. 
Therefore, choice of strength, the highest telmisartan/HCTZ 80/25 mg tablets, and design of the study, a 
single dose crossover bioequivalence study under fasting condition, are appropriate and in line with the 
CHMP Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted a bioequivalence study: 
Single dose crossover comparative bioavailability study of telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg / 25 
mg tablets in healthy male volunteers under fasting conditions. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Methods 
Study design  
Single centre, randomized, single dose, laboratory-blinded, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover study was 
conducted  to  compare  the  relative  bioavailability  and  therefore  the  bioequivalence  of  two  different 
formulations of telmisartan / HCTZ after a single oral dose administration under fasting conditions.

Population(s) studied  
The study was conducted in 70 healthy male subjects (volunteers) with a mean age of 36 years (range 
19-50 years).   
Thirty-nine (39) blood samples were collected on twenty-three (23) occasions as follows: 
• For telmisartan (21 samples), blood samples were collected prior to and 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83, 1, 
1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours after drug administration. 
• For hydrochlorothiazide (18 samples), blood samples were collected prior to and 0.33, 0.67, 1, 1.25, 
1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24 and 36 hours after drug administration. 
After a, overnight fast, a single dose of the assigned formulation was orally administered in the morning 
with approximately 240 mL of water. The wash-out  period between study periods was of 14 calendar 
days.  
Of the 70 healthy male subjects who were included in the study, 64 subjects completed the crossover 
design and received a single oral dose of the assigned formulation on day 1 and day 15. Three subjects 
withdrew their consent on personal reasons before period 2, one subject before period 2 due to upper 
respiratory tract infection, one subject was withdrawn since he missed three last blood samples in period 
1, one subject was withdrawn due to vomiting event in period 1. 
Analytical methods   
The experimental samples were assayed for telmisartan at the analytical facility of the CROoutside EU 
using  a  validated  HPLC  method  with  MS/MS  detection.  The  subject  sample  analysis  was  performed 
between 2011/02/25 and 2011/04/18, including re-assays and incurred samples.  
The experimental samples were assayed for HCTZ in plasma at the analytical facility of  the CRO outside 
EU using a validated HPLC method with MS/MS detection. The subject sample analysis was performed 
between 2011/03/01 and 2011/04/19.  
Analytical  methods  were  appropriately  validated  and  met  the  criteria  in  the  EMA  Guideline  on 
Bioanalytical Method Validation.  
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The pharmacokinetic parameters were Cmax, Tmax, AUCT, AUC∞, AUCT/∞, Kel and T½el, which were 
measured  and  calculated  from  the  collected  blood  samples  for  telmisartan  and  HCTZ.  The  main  PK 
parameters  were  estimated  using  a  non-compartmental  approach  with  a  log-linear  terminal  phase 
assumption. The trapezoidal rule was used to estimate the area under the curve and the terminal phase 
was estimated by maximizing the coefficient of determination estimated from the log-linear regression 
model.  The  natural  logarithmic  transformation  of  Cmax,  AUCT  and  AUC∞  as  well  as  the 
rank-transformation of Tmax were used for all statistical analysis.

Statistical methods   
Statistical  analysis  was  based  on  a  parametric  ANOVA  model  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters; 
two-sided 90% confidence interval of the ratio of geometric means for the Cmax, AUCT and AUC∞ based 
on  ln-transformed  data.  ANOVA  model  included  sequence,  period,  treatment,  subject  (nested  within 
sequence)  as  fixed  effects.  Statistical  and  pharmacokinetic  analyses  were  generated  using  Kinetic, 
version 9.01.  
Standard non-compartmental pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis using ANOVA and GLM procedure 
were used and are in line with the EMA guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence. 
Results 
Of the 70 healthy subjects who were included in the study, 64 subjects completed the crossover design 
and were included in the PK and statistical analysis. The main results obtained from the BE study are 
summarised in Tables 1,2,3, and 4 below.

The test to reference product ratio of geometric LS means and corresponding 90% confidence interval for 
the Cmax and AUCT were within the acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00% for both telmisartan and 
HCTZ. Therefore, based on telmisartan and HCTZ, the test formulation (Telmisartan/HCTZ 80 mg/25 mg 
tablets, KRKA, d.d., Novo mesto, Slovenia) is considered by the CHMP to be bioequivalent to the reference 
formulation (MicardisPlus 80 mg/25 mg tablets, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.KG, Germany) 
under fasting conditions.

Biowaiver 
The applicant claims for a biowaiver for telmisartan/HCTZ 40/12.5 mg and 80/12.5 mg strengths. The 
data submitted to support the biowaiver claim are acceptable All criteria needed for a biowaiver claim are 
also fulfilled and accepted by the CHMP. 
Safety data 
In the BE study 70 adverse events were reported by 41 subjects out of 70. No serious adverse events 
(AEs) or deaths were reported during this study and no subjects were withdrawn from the study for safety 
reasons.  Overall,  the  drugs  tested  were  generally  safe and  well  tolerated  by  subjects  included in  this 
study. 
Conclusions 
Bioequivalence  between  the  Telmisartan/HCTZ  KRKA  80/25  mg  tablets  and  the  reference  product 
MicardisPlus  80/25  mg  tablets  have  been  demonstrated.  Bioequivalence  studies  with  additional 
Telmisartan/HCTZ  KRKA  40/12.5  mg  tablets  and  Telmisartan/HCTZ  KRKA  80/12.5  mg  tablets  can  be 
waived.  
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Tolucombi is considered bioequivalent with MicardisPlus.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This application concerns a generic medicinal product Telmisartan/HCTZ KRKA 40/12.5 mg tablets, 
Telmisartan/HCTZ KRKA 80/12.5 mg tablets and Telmisartan/HCTZ KRKA 80/25 mg tablets. A single dose 
2-period crossover bioequivalence study under fasting conditions was conducted with the highest 
telmisartan/HCTZ 80/25 mg strength. Design of the study was appropriate, the reference product 
MicardisPlus (Boerhinger Ingelheim GmbH, Germany) can be taken with and without food. Selection of 
the highest strength is appropriate since according to the SmPC of the reference product, telmisartan has 
non-linear PK with more than dose proportional increase in AUC. As per submitted literature references, 
PK of HCTZ is linear over the dose range of 12.5 mg to 25 mg. Clinical site of the study has been regularly 
inspected by regulatory authorities. Study report contained all relevant sections and annexes. Blood 
sample collection time was sufficient, no pre-dose samples contained detectable levels of investigational 
drugs. The conduct of the study was in line with the CHMP Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence. For the highest 80/25 mg strength bioequivalence between the generic and the EU 
reference product MicardisPlus has been demonstrated both for the Cmax (telmisartan 104.65 [90%CI 
95.66; 114.48]; HCTZ 96.69 [90%CI 91.75; 101.91]) and AUCT (telmisartan 104.94 [90% CI 101.03; 
109.00]; HCTZ 102.30 [99.84 ; 104.83]).

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This is an application for a generic medicinal product containing of telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 
tablets. The reference product, MicardisPlus, is indicated for treatment of essential hypertension (40 mg 
telmisartan/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled on telmisartan alone; 80 mg telmisartan/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in adults 
whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on telmisartan alone; 80 mg telmisartan/25 mg 
hydrochlorothiazide is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on 80 mg 
telmisartan/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide or adults who have been previously stabilised on telmisartan 
and hydrochlorothiazide given separately). 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient.  
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient.

The bioequivalence study constitutes pivotal basis with a single dose crossover comparative 
bioavailability study of 80 mg telmisartan/ 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide tablets in healthy male volunteers 
in fasting state. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. The choice of dose, sampling 
points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Tolucombi 80 mg telmisartan/ 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide tablets met the 
protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the MicardisPlus. The point estimates 
and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax for both active 
substances were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00 %. 
Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
The applicant claimed for a biowaiver for telmisartan/ hydrochlorothiazide 40/12.5 mg and 80/12.5 mg 
strengths. All criteria needed for the requested biowaiver claim are fulfilled. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded as positive. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required 
beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Tolucombi in the treatment of treatment of essential hypertension; 
Tolucombi fixed dose combination (40 mg telmisartan/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated in 
adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on telmisartan alone; Tolucombi fixed dose 
combination (80 mg telmisartan/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated in adults whose blood 
pressure is not adequately controlled on telmisartan alone; Tolucombi fixed dose combination (80 mg 
telmisartan/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide) is indicated in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately 
controlled on Tolucombi 80 mg/12.5 mg (80 mg telmisartan/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide) or adults 
who have been previously stabilised on telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide given separately, is 
favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

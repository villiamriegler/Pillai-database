Kovaltry contains approximately 3000 IU (600 IU / 1 mL) of recombinant human coagulation 
factor VIII (INN: octocog alfa) after reconstitution. 
The potency (IU) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic assay. The specific 
activity of Kovaltry is approximately 4000 IU/mg protein. 
Octocog alfa (Full length recombinant human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein 
that has 2,332 amino acids. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in baby hamster kidney 
cells (BHK) into which the human factor VIII gene has been introduced. Kovaltry is prepared without 
the addition of any human or animal derived protein in the cell culture process, purification or final 
formulation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). Kovaltry can be used for all age groups. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of haemophilia. 
Treatment monitoring 
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII levels is advised to guide the 
dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated infusions. Individual patients may vary in their 
response to factor VIII, demonstrating different half-lives and recoveries. Dose based on bodyweight 
may require adjustment in underweight or overweight patients.  
In the case of major surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy 
by means of coagulation analysis (plasma factor VIII activity) is indispensable. 
Posology 
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient's clinical condition. 
The number of units of factor VIII administered is expressed in International Units (IU), which are 
related to the current WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is 
expressed either as a percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in International Units (relative 
to an International Standard for factor VIII in plasma). 
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in 
one mL of normal human plasma. 
On demand treatment 
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 
1 International Unit (IU) factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 1.5% 
to 2.5% of normal activity. 
The required dose is determined using the following formula: 
Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (% or IU/dL) x reciprocal of observed 
recovery (i.e. 0.5 for recovery of 2.0%). 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be targeted to the 
clinical effectiveness required in the individual case. 
In the case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the 
given level (in % of normal) in the corresponding period. The following table can be used to guide 
dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Frequency of doses (hours)/ 
Duration of therapy (days) 
Repeat every 12 to 24 hours. At 
least 1 day, until the bleeding 
episode as indicated by pain is 
resolved or healing is achieved. 
Repeat infusion every 12 - 24 hours 
for 3 - 4 days or more until pain and 
acute disability are resolved. 
Repeat infusion every 8 to 24 hours 
until threat is resolved 
Every 24 hours, at least 1 day, until 
healing is achieved. 
Repeat infusion every 8 - 24 hours 
until adequate wound healing, then 
therapy for at least another 7 days to 
maintain a factor VIII activity of 
30% to 60% (IU/dL). 
Prophylaxis 
For long term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses for 
adolescents (≥ 12 years age) and adult patients are 20 to 40 IU of Kovaltry per kg body weight two to 
three times per week. 
In some cases, especially in younger patients, shorter dose intervals or higher doses may be necessary. 
Paediatric population 
A safety and efficacy study has been performed in children of 0 - 12 years (see section 5.1). 
The recommended prophylaxis doses are 20-50 IU/kg twice weekly, three times weekly or every other 
day according to individual requirements. For paediatric patients above the age of 12, the dose 
recommendations are the same as for adults.  
Method of administration 
Intravenous use. 
Kovaltry should be injected intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume. The rate 
of administration should be determined by the patient’s comfort level (maximal rate of infusion: 
2 mL/min). 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6 and 
the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in 
section 6.1. 
Known allergic reactions to mouse or hamster proteins. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Hypersensitivity 
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions are possible with Kovaltry. 
If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, patients should be advised to discontinue the use of the 
medicinal product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. 
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented. 
Inhibitors 
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) 
per mL of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the 
severity of the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII , this risk being highest within the first 
50 exposure days but continues throughout life although the risk is uncommon. 
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
posing less of a risk of insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors. 
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests (see 
section 4.2). 
If the expected factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with 
an appropriate dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with 
high levels of inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should 
be considered. Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the 
care of haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors. 
Cardiovascular events 
In patients with existing cardiovascular risk factors, substitution therapy with FVIII may increase the 
cardiovascular risk. 
Catheter-related complications 
If a central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteraemia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered. 
It is strongly recommended that every time that Kovaltry is administered to a patient, the name and 
batch number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch 
of the medicinal product. 
Paediatric population 
The listed warnings and precautions apply both to adults and children. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interactions of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA) products with other medicinal products have 
been reported. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy is not 
available.  
Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy only if clearly indicated. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether Kovaltry is excreted in human milk. The excretion in animals has not been 
studied. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during breast-feeding only if clearly indicated. 
Fertility 
No animal fertility studies have been conducted with Kovaltry and its effect on human fertility has not 
been established in controlled clinical trials. Since Kovaltry is a replacement protein of endogenous 
factor VIII, no adverse effects on fertility are expected. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive or use machines 
If patients experience dizziness or other symptoms affecting their ability to concentrate and react, it is 
recommended that they do not drive or use machines until the reaction subsides. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed and 
may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock). 
Development of antibodies to mouse and hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions may 
occur. 
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII (FVIII), including with Kovaltry. If such inhibitors occur, the condition may manifest 
itself as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised 
haemophilia centre be contacted.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
A total of 236 (193 PTPs, 43 PUPs/MTPs) patients constituted the pooled safety population in the 
three phase III studies in previously treated patients (PTPs), previously untreated patients (PUPs) and 
minimal treated patients (MTPs); LEOPOLD I, LEOPOLD II, LEOPOLD Kids studies. The median 
time on clinical trial for pooled safety population was 558 days (range 14 to 2436 days) with a median 
of 183 exposure days (EDs) (range 1 to 1230 EDs). 
• 
• 
• 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the pooled population were pyrexia, headache 
and rash.  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions in the PTPs were related to potential 
hypersensitivity reactions, including headache, pyrexia, pruritus, rash and abdominal 
discomfort. 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction in PUPs/MTPs was FVIII inhibitor. 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of Kovaltry was evaluated in PTPs and PUPs/MTPs. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During clinical trials with Kovaltry in approximately 200 pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with 
severe hemophilia A (FVIII:C < 1%) with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates ≥ 50 ED, one 
case of transient low titer inhibitor (peak titer 1.0 BU/mL) occurred in a 13 year old PTP after 
549 EDs. The Factor VIII recovery was normal (2.7 IU/dL per IU/kg). 
Paediatric population 
In the clinical studies no age-specific differences in ADR were observed except for FVIII inhibitor in 
PUPs/MTPs.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant human coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihemorrhagics: blood coagulation factor VIII, ATC code B02BD02. 
Mechanism of action 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (vWF) complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and 
vWF) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII 
binds to vWF in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated 
factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts 
prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII:C and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. By replacement therapy the plasma levels 
of factor VIII are increased, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor deficiency and 
correction of the bleeding tendencies. 
Of note, annualised bleeding rate (ABR) is not comparable between different factor concentrates and 
between different clinical studies. 
Kovaltry does not contain von Willebrand factor. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is prolonged in people with haemophilia. 
Determination of aPTT is a conventional in vitro assay for biological activity of factor VIII. Treatment 
with rFVIII normalizes the aPTT similar to that achieved with plasma-derived factor VIII. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Control and Prevention of Bleeding 
Two multi-centre, open-label, cross-over, uncontrolled, randomised studies in previously treated 
adults/adolescents with severe haemophilia A (< 1%) and one multi-centre, open-label, uncontrolled

study in PTPs < 12 years of age (Part A) and PUPs/MTPs <6 years of age (Part B) with severe 
haemophilia A were conducted. 
A total of 247 subjects (204 PTPs and 43 PUPs/MTPs) have been exposed in the clinical trial program, 
153 subjects ≥ 12 years and 94 subjects < 12 years. Two-hundred and eight (208) subjects (174 PTPs, 
34 PUPs/MTPs) were treated for at least 360 days, and 98 of these subjects (78 PTPs, 20 PUPs/MTPs) 
for at least 720 days. 
Paediatric population <12 years 
Part A: The paediatric trial enrolled 51 PTPs with severe haemophilia A, 26 subjects in the age group 
6-12 years and 25 subjects in the age group <6 years having accumulated a median number of 73 EDs 
(range: 37 to 103 EDs). Subjects were treated with 2 or 3 injections per week or up to every other day at 
a dose of 25 to 50 IU/kg. Consumption for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds, annualised bleed rates 
and success rate for bleed treatment are presented in Table 3. 
Part B: A total of 43 PUPs/MTPs were enrolled and accumulated a median of 46 EDs 
(range 1 to 55 EDs). The median dose for treatment of bleeds in all PUPs/MTPs was 40.5 IU/kg and 
78.1% of the bleeds were successfully treated with ≤ 2 infusions. 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction in PUPs/MTPs was Factor VIII inhibitor (see 
section 4.8). FVIII inhibitors were detected in 23 of 42 patients with a median (range) of 9 (4 – 42) 
EDs at the time of the first positive inhibitor test. Of these, 6 patients had low-titre inhibitors (≤ 5.0 
BU) and 17 patients had high-titre inhibitors. 
Extension: Of the 94 treated subjects, 82 subjects entered the Leopold Kids extension study, 
79 patients received treatment with Kovaltry and 67 patients received Kovaltry as prophylaxis 
treatment. The median time in the extension study was 3.1 years (range 0.3 to 6.4 years), the median 
total time in entire study (main plus extension study) was 3.8 years (range 0.8 to 6.7 years).  
During the extension study, 67 of 82 subjects received Kovaltry as prophylaxis treatment. Amongst 
the 67 subjects, a total of 472 bleeds were treated with Kovaltry, requiring 1-2 infusions for the 
majority of bleeds (83.5%), and response to treatment was good or excellent in most (87.9%) of the 
cases. 
Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) 
Data on ITI has been collected in patients with haemophilia A. 11 subjects with high titer inhibitors 
received ITI with various treatment regimens of three times per week up to twice daily. 5 subjects 
completed ITI with a negative inhibitor result at the end of the study, and 1 subject had a low titer (1.2 
BU/mL) at time of discontinuation.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of Kovaltry was evaluated in PTPs with severe haemophilia A 
following 50 IU/kg in 21 subjects ≥ 18 years, 5 subjects ≥ 12 years and < 18 years and 19 subjects 
< 12 years of age.  
A population PK model was developed based on all available factor VIII measurements (from dense 
PK sampling and all recovery samples) throughout the 3 clinical studies allowing calculation of PK 
parameters for subjects in the various studies. The table 4 below provides PK parameters based on the 
population PK model.

Repeated PK measurements after 6 to 12 months of prophylaxis treatment with Kovaltry did not 
indicate any relevant changes in PK characteristics after long-term treatment. 
In an international study involving 41 clinical laboratories, the performance of Kovaltry in FVIII:C 
assays was evaluated and compared to a marketed full length rFVIII product. Consistent results were 
determined for both products. The FVIII:C of Kovaltry can be measured in plasma with a one-stage 
coagulation assay as well as with a chromogenic assay using the routine methods of the laboratory. 
The analysis of all recorded incremental recoveries in previously treated patients demonstrated a 
median rise of > 2% (> 2 IU/dL) per IU/kg body weight for Kovaltry. This result is similar to the 
reported values for factor VIII derived from human plasma. There was no relevant change over the 
6-12 months treatment period.

Non-clinical data reveal no special risk for humans based on safety pharmacology, in vitro 
genotoxicity, and short term repeat-dose toxicity studies. Repeat-dose toxicity studies longer than 
5 days, reproductive toxicity studies, and carcinogenicity studies, have not been performed. Such 
studies are not considered meaningful due to the production of antibodies against the heterologous 
human protein in animals. Also factor VIII is an intrinsic protein and not known to cause any 
reproductive or carcinogenic effects.

The reconstituted medicinal product is a clear and colourless solution. 
Kovaltry powder should only be reconstituted with the supplied solvent (2.5 mL or 5 mL water for 
injections) in the prefilled syringe and the vial adapter. For infusion, the product must be prepared 
under aseptic conditions. If any component of the package is opened or damaged, do not use this 
component. 
After reconstitution the solution is clear. Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually 
for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use Kovaltry if you notice 
visible particulate matter or turbidity. 
After reconstitution, the solution is drawn back into the syringe. Kovaltry should be reconstituted and 
administered with the components (vial adapter, prefilled syringe, venipuncture set) provided with 
each package. 
The reconstituted product must be filtered prior to administration to remove potential particulate 
matter in the solution. Filtering is achieved by using the vial adapter.  
The venipuncture set provided with the product must not be used for drawing blood because it 
contains an in line filter.  
For single use only.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Kovaltry is and what it is used for 
Kovaltry contains the active substance human recombinant coagulation factor VIII, also called 
octocog alfa. Kovaltry is prepared by recombinant technology without addition of any human- or 
animal derived components in the manufacturing process. Factor VIII is a protein naturally found in 
the blood that helps to clot it. 
Kovaltry is used to treat and prevent  bleeding in adults, adolescents and children of all ages with 
haemophilia A (hereditary factor VIII deficiency). 
2.  What you need to know before you use Kovaltry 
Do not use Kovaltry if you are  
• 
• 
allergic to octocog alfa or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
allergic to mouse or hamster proteins. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have: 
• 
• 
tightness in the chest, dizziness (including when you get up from sitting or lying down), itchy 
nettle-rash, wheezing, feeling sick or faint. These may be signs of a rare severe sudden allergic 
reaction to Kovaltry. Stop administering the product immediately and seek medical advice 
if this occurs. 
bleeding that is not being controlled with your usual dose of Kovaltry. The formation of 
inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with all 
Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly, patients receiving Kovaltry will be monitored carefully for the development of these 
inhibitors. If your or your child’s bleeding is not being controlled with Kovaltry, tell your 
doctor immediately. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
previously developed factor VIII inhibitors to a different product. If you switch factor VIII 
products, you may be at risk of your inhibitor coming back. 
a confirmed heart disease or are at risk of heart disease.  
to use a central venous access device for the administration of Kovaltry. You may be at risk of 
device related complications where the catheter is inserted including: 
- 
- 
- 
local infections 
bacteria in the blood  
a blood clot in the blood vessel. 
Children and adolescents 
The listed warnings and precautions apply to patients of all ages, adults and children. 
Other medicines and Kovaltry 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine. 
Kovaltry is not likely to affect the fertility in male or female patients, as the active substance is 
naturally occurring in the body. 
Driving and using machines 
If you experience dizziness or any other symptoms affecting your ability to concentrate and react, do 
not drive or use machines until the reaction subsides. 
Kovaltry contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3.  How to use Kovaltry 
Treatment with Kovaltry will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A. Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor 
if you are not sure. 
The number of factor VIII units is expressed in International Units (IU). 
Treatment of bleeding 
 To treat a bleed, your doctor will calculate and adjust your dose and how often it should be given, 
depending on factors such as: 
• 
your weight 
• 
the severity of your haemophilia A 
• 
where the bleed is and how serious it is 
• 
whether you have inhibitors and how high their level is 
• 
the factor VIII level that is needed. 
Prevention of bleeding 
If you are using Kovaltry to prevent bleeding, your doctor will calculate the dose for you. This will 
usually be in the range of 20 to 40 IU of octocog alfa per kg of body weight, injected two or three 
times per week. However, in some cases, especially for younger patients, shorter dose intervals or 
higher doses may be necessary. 
Laboratory tests 
Laboratory tests at suitable intervals help to ensure you always have adequate factor VIII levels. For 
major surgery in particular, your blood clotting must be closely monitored. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use in children and adolescents 
Kovaltry can be used in children of all ages. In children below the age of 12 higher doses or more 
frequent injections than prescribed for adults may be needed. 
Patients with inhibitors 
If you have been told by your doctor that you have developed factor VIII inhibitors you may need to 
use a larger dose of Kovaltry to control bleeding. If this dose does not control your bleeding your 
doctor may consider giving you another product. 
Speak to your doctor if you would like further information on this. 
Do not increase the dose of Kovaltry to control your bleeding without checking with  your doctor. 
Duration of treatment 
Usually, Kovaltry treatment for haemophilia is needed life-long. 
How Kovaltry is given 
Kovaltry is injected into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes depending on the total volume and your comfort 
level and should be used within 3 hours after reconstitution.  
How Kovaltry is prepared for administration 
Use only the components (vial adapter, pre filled syringe containing solvent and venipuncture set) 
provided with each package of this medicine. Please contact your doctor if these components cannot 
be used. Do not use if any component of the package is opened or damaged. 
The reconstituted product must be filtered by using the vial adapter before administration to remove 
any possible particles in the solution. 
Do not use the venipuncture set provided for drawing blood because it contains an in-line filter. 
This medicine must not be mixed with other infusion solutions. Do not use solutions containing 
visible particles or that are cloudy. Follow the instructions for use given by your doctor and provided 
at the end of this leaflet. 
If you use more Kovaltry than you should 
Tell your doctor if this occurs. No cases of overdose have been reported.  
If you forget to use Kovaltry 
Administer your next dose immediately and continue at regular intervals as advised by your doctor.  
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.  
If you stop using Kovaltry 
Do not stop using this medicine without checking with your doctor. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
The most serious side effects are allergic reactions which may be severe allergic reaction. Stop 
injecting Kovaltry immediately and speak to your doctor at once if such reactions occur. The 
following symptoms could be an early warning of these reactions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
chest tightness/general feeling of being unwell  
dizziness 
feeling faint upon standing indicating a reduction in blood pressure 
feeling sick (nausea) 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For children not previously treated with factor VIII medicines, inhibitors (see section 2) may form 
very commonly (more than 1 in 10 patients). For patients who have received previous treatment with 
factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) may form 
uncommonly (less than 1 in 100 patients). If this happens your medicine may stop working properly 
and you may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, please contact your doctor 
immediately. 
Other possible side effects:

Detailed instructions for reconstitution and administration of Kovaltry 
You will need alcohol swabs, gauze pads, plasters and tourniquet. These items are not included in the 
Kovaltry package. 
1.  Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Hold an unopened vial and also a syringe in your hands to warm it to a comfortable 
temperature (do not exceed 37 °C). 
Remove the protective cap from the vial (A).Wipe the rubber stopper on 
the vial with an alcohol swab and allow the stopper to air dry before use. 
Place the powder vial on a firm, non slip surface. Peel off the paper cover 
on the plastic housing of the vial adapter. Do not remove the adapter from 
the plastic housing. Holding the adapter housing, place over the powder 
vial and firmly press down (B). The adapter will snap over the vial cap. Do 
not remove the adapter housing at this point. 
Hold the pre filled syringe with solvent upright. Grasp the plunger rod as 
per the picture and attach the rod by turning it firmly clockwise into the 
threaded stopper (C). 
Holding the syringe by the barrel, snap the syringe cap off the tip (D). Do 
not touch the syringe tip with your hand or any surface. Set the syringe 
aside for further use. 
7. 
Now remove and discard the adapter housing (E). 
8. 
Attach the pre filled syringe to the threaded vial adapter by turning 
clockwise (F). 
9. 
Inject the solvent by slowly pushing down on the plunger rod (G). 
10.  Swirl vial gently until all the powder is dissolved (H). Do not shake vial. 
Be sure that the powder is completely dissolved. Look to check there are 
no particles or discoloration before you use the solution. Do not use 
solutions containing visible particles or that are cloudy. 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11.  Hold the vial on the end above the vial adapter and syringe (I). Fill the 
syringe by drawing the plunger out slowly and smoothly. Ensure that the 
full content of the vial is drawn into the syringe. Hold the syringe upright 
and push the plunger until no air is left in the syringe. 
12.  Apply a tourniquet to your arm. 
13.  Determine the point of injection and clean the skin with an alcohol swab. 
14.  Puncture the vein and secure the venipuncture set with a plaster. 
15.  Holding the vial adapter in place, remove the syringe from the vial adapter 
(the adapter should remain attached to the vial). Attach the syringe to the 
venipuncture set (J). Ensure that no blood enters the syringe. 
16.  Remove tourniquet. 
17. 
18. 
19. 
Inject the solution into a vein over 2 to 5 minutes, keeping an eye on the position of the 
needle. The speed of injection should be based on your comfort, but should not be faster than 
2 mL per minute. 
If a further dose is needed, use a new syringe with the powder reconstituted as described 
above. 
If no further dose is required, remove the venipuncture set and syringe. Hold a pad firmly 
over the injection site on your outstretched arm for about 2 minutes. Finally, apply a small 
pressure dressing to the injection site and consider if a plaster is necessary. 
20. 
It is recommended that every time you use Kovaltry, you note down the name and the batch 
number of the product. 
21.  Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. Ask your pharmacist 
or physician how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help 
protect the environment

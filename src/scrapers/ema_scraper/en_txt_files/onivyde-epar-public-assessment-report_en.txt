2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the pancreas (ICD-9, 2014). More than 80% of exocrine pancreatic 
cancers are infiltrating ductal adenocarcinomas, a majority of which exhibit KRAS mutations, predominantly 
G12V or G12D mutations (Seufferlein, et al, 2012), and the remaining types include adenosquamous 
carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, signet ring cell carcinomas, acinar cell carcinomas, undifferentiated 
carcinomas, undifferentiated carcinomas with giant cells, and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas. 
Exocrine pancreatic tumors are far more common than pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, which make up about 
3-5% of all pancreatic malignancies (Krampitz, 2013). Hereditary conditions account for ~5-10% of pancreatic 
cancer (Seufferlein et al., 2012). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
In Europe, cancer of the pancreas is the seventh most frequent cancer, accounting for some 2.9% of cancer in 
men and 3.2% in women) and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in Europe (GLOBOCAN 2012). The 
age-standardized mortality rates (ASR) per 100,000 are 8.0 for men and 5.5 for women (Malvezzi et al, 2013). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Mainly a disease of the elderly, pancreatic adenocarcinoma accounts for 85-95% of all pancreatic cancers. More 
than 50% of pancreatic cancers are identified in metastatic stage, with overall survival ranging from 7-11 
months. In 30%-40% of patients the disease is localized, but not surgically resectable, with OS of 11-18 
months. The overall 1-year survival rate ranges from 11% to 28.3% (Seufferlein T, Annals of Oncology 2012). 
Chemo- and radio-resistant, unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma has a dire prognosis, with a 5–year OS of 
6 %, i.e. with an increase in OS of only 1% in the past three decades. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Despite 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin with irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel 
significantly improving outcomes for metastatic cancer (response rates between 23% and 31%, PFS of 5.5–6.6 
months, OS between 8.5 and 11 months), refractory disease still poses significant challenges.  
Novel chemotherapeutics, stroma and immune-targeted agents are currently being developed (Drug Design, 
Development and Therapy 2015:9 3529–3545). However, there is no consensus on second-line treatment after 
failure on first-line therapy. The OFF regimen (oxaliplatin/5FU/LV) showed an OS advantage of 2.6 months in 
CONKO-003, a randomized study in patients with disease progression after first-line gemcitabine therapy.

About the product 
Onivyde (also referred to as MM-398) is developed for the treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas, in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV), in patients who have been previously 
treated with gemcitabine.  
The active substance in Onivyde is irinotecan (topoisomerase I inhibitor) encapsulated in a lipid bilayer vesicle 
or liposome. Irinotecan is a derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins act as specific inhibitors of the enzyme 
DNA topoisomerase I. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind reversibly to the topoisomerase I-DNA 
complex and induce single-strand DNA lesions which block the DNA replication fork and are responsible for the 
cytotoxicity. Irinotecan is metabolized by carboxylesterase to SN-38. SN-38 is approximately 1000 times as 
potent as irinotecan as an inhibitor of topoisomerase I purified from human and rodent tumour cell lines. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, in combination with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in 
patients who have been previously treated with gemcitabine. 
The recommended indication is: 
Treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, in combination with 5 fluorouracil (5 FU) and 
leucovorin  (LV), in adult patients who have progressed following gemcitabine based therapy. 
Onivyde must only be prescribed and administered to patients by healthcare professionals experienced in the 
use of anti cancer therapies. 
Onivyde is not equivalent to non-liposomal irinotecan formulations and should not be interchanged. 
Onivyde, leucovorin and 5 fluorouracil should be administered sequentially. The recommended dose and 
regimen Onivyde is 80 mg/m2 intravenously over 90 minutes, followed by LV 400 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 
minutes, followed by 5 FU 2,400 mg/m2 intravenously over 46 hours, administered every 2 weeks. Onivyde 
should not be administered as a single agent. 
All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. LV dose does not require adjustment. For 
Grade 1 and 2 toxicities there are no dose modifications recommended. Dose adjustments, are recommended to 
manage Grade 3 or 4 toxicities related to Onivyde. 
For patients who start treatment with 60 mg/m2 Onivyde and do not dose escalate to 80 mg/m2, the 
recommended first dose reduction is to 50 mg/m2 and the second dose reduction is to 40 mg/m2. Patients who 
require further dose reduction should discontinue treatment.

The molecular structure of irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate has been confirmed by elemental analysis, IR 
spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis (TGA and 
DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction analysis. 
The active substance is a pale yellow to yellow crystalline powder; it is hygroscopic and light sensitive; freely 
soluble in DMSO and anhydrous acetic acid, slightly soluble in ethanol, sparingly soluble in aqueous buffer at 
pH 4 and slightly soluble in aqueous buffer at pH 2. 
Irinotecan exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of a chiral centre. The source of stereoisomerism is 
camptothecin starting material. Enantiomeric purity of the active substance is controlled routinely by chiral 
HPLC. 
The active substance manufacturer has demonstrated that a single crystalline form of irinotecan hydrochloride 
trihydrate is consistently produced. Polymorphism has no relevance on the performance of the finished product, 
as the active substance is dissolved during the manufacturing process of the finished product. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is currently sourced from a single manufacturer. Detailed information on the 
manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of the ASMF and it was 
considered satisfactory. 
Irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate is a semi-synthetic active substance. It is synthesized from well-defined 
starting materials. The originally proposed starting material was redefined during the assessment procedure, 
since the CHMP considered it necessary in support of a more exhaustive control strategy. The concerns raised 
were related to missing information on the source of the material, the supplier of the material, extraction 
process, control of the material, and the potential carry-over of impurities to the active substance. As a result of 
this redefinition, the route of synthesis of the active substance was expanded to include these additional steps 
under GMP and the requested information was provided. A revised process will be implemented once the 
necessary analyses and comparability studies have been finalised and a new active substance supplier is 
approved. This commitment is considered a legally binding post-authorisation measure, with the submission 
expected by 31 December 2016. As an additional measure until the new process is fully implemented, the CHMP 
required more information on the control strategy for aflatoxin, mycotoxin, pesticide, residual solvents, and 
elemental impurities, for the batches of intermediate initially defined as the starting material which was 
considered satisfactory.  
The specifications and control methods for current starting materials and reagents have been presented and 
only those batches conforming to the specifications can be used in the manufacture of the active substance. 
The CHMP considered that the information presented, the steps taken, and the commitments provided by the 
Applicant are sufficient to ensure that the quality of the product is warranted and raises no concerns that could 
impact the safety of the medicinal product. 
The active substance is synthesized in four main steps, using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products have been presented. 
Reprocessing procedure of the active substance is described in the dossier and the reprocessing activities were 
considered acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 15/107 
  
  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in two-layer polyethylene bag as the inner package, and the pharmaceutical 
aluminium tin as the outer package. Plastic materials in contact with the active substance comply with the EC 
directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, assay (HPLC), identity (IR, HPLC), chiral 
purity (UV, HPLC), chloride identification (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (Ph. Eur.), water 
content (KF), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), solubility (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), 
microbial limits (Ph. Eur.), and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
Due to its mechanism of action, irinotecan is potentially genotoxic and carcinogenic. Mutagenic and carcinogenic 
potential of the impurities of starting materials, intermediates generated during the synthesis or degradation 
products cannot be excluded. In line with ICH M7, exposure to a mutagenic impurity in these cases would not 
significantly add to the cancer risk of the active substance. Therefore, these impurities are controlled in the 
active substance at acceptable levels for non-mutagenic impurities, complying with the identification (0.10%) 
and qualification thresholds (0.15%) described in the ICH Q3A guideline. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay, identification, and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results for three consecutive commercial scale batches used for process validation and fifteen 
batches used in process performance qualification, stability, nonclinical, and clinical studies of the active 
substance have been provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on nine commercial scale batches and three additional batches of pilot or lab scale of active 
substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for 48 months under 
long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was 
performed on one batch. Results on stress conditions including high temperature, high humidity, acidity, 
alkalinity, oxidation, reduction, and hydrolysis were also provided on one batch. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, chiral purity, impurities, and pH. The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters of the active substance stored under long term and accelerated conditions were within the 
specifications. No trends in the formation of impurities or water absorption were observed. The active substance 
was stable with respect to assay and impurity levels when tested under the stress conditions of high 
temperature, and high humidity. Water levels increased under both stress conditions demonstrating that the 
active substance is hygroscopic. Testing under acidic, alkaline, oxidative, reductive, and hydrolytic stress 
conditions showed the instability of the active substance, resulting in the increase in the level of impurities and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 16/107 
  
  
the decrease in assay. During the photostability testing the levels of impurities increased demonstrating that the 
active substance is sensitive to light.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable when protected from light and moisture. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 3 years 
when stored in the proposed container with no special storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a white to slightly yellow opaque sterile concentrate for solution for infusion. It consists 
of an isotonic dispersion of liposomes containing irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate. 
The liposomes are small unilamellar lipid bilayer vesicles, approximately 110 nm in diameter, enclosing an 
aqueous compartment that contains irinotecan in a gelated or precipitated state, as sucrosofate salt. The lipid 
membrane is composed of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and a 
N-(carbonylmethoxypolyethlyene glycol-2000)-1,2-distearoly-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine 
(MPEG-2000-DSPE). The liposomes are dispersed in an aqueous buffered solution. 
Figure 2. Schematic representation of the liposome. 
As mentioned above, irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate is present in the liposomes in the form of irinotecan 
sucrosofate salt. During pharmaceutical development, a number of formulations were screened where the anion 
of the drug entrapping solution was varied. Development identified sucrose octasulphate (SOS) as a superior 
anion of the drug entrapping solution. Sucrose octasulphate is added in the finished product manufacturing 
process as a triethylammonium salt, i.e. as triethylammonium sucrose octasulphate (TEA-SOS). It maintained

EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 17/107 
  
  
 
the encapsulation efficiency and had superior in vitro irinotecan retention in liposomes compared with the other 
formulation. Therefore this formulation was chosen for clinical and commercial use. 
Sucrosofate potassium salt (K-SOS) is a novel excipient and it is listed in the composition of the finished product 
as a free base. It is used as the raw material for the preparation of sucrosofate triethylammonium salt 
(TEA-SOS) used in liposome formation. The excipient K-SOS is transformed into TEA-SOS by ion-exchange. 
TEA-SOS and the lipids form the liposomes by passive encapsulation following polycarbonate membrane 
extrusion. An electrochemical gradient is subsequently formed by removal of TEA-SOS from the exterior of the 
liposomes by diafiltration. Triethylamine is removed during the manufacturing process. Detailed information on 
the manufacture, characterization and controls, justification of the use and a summary of supporting toxicology 
data for sucrosofate potassium salt was requested by the CHMP during the assessment procedure and the 
provided data was considered satisfactory. 
The lipid membrane is composed of 1, 2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol, and 
N-(carbonyl-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000)-1,2-distearoly-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine 
(MPEG-2000-DSPE). The function of the liposomal excipients is to produce the liposomal bilayer membrane 
which forms small unilamellar vesicles encapsulating and retaining the active substance until it is passively 
delivered to the tumour site. The liposomal excipients were selected for their properties when combined to 
produce liposomes capable of actively loading and retaining the active substance, while maintaining low protein 
binding in vivo and consequently prolonging their circulation lifetime. 
DSPC is the major lipid component in the liposome bilayer. It was selected based on its high purity. It is a 
synthetic lipid with a well-defined fatty acid composition. It has a relatively high phase transition (Tm of 55°C) 
and is present in the highly ordered structure termed the gel phase, which resists permeability to small molecule 
drugs at physiological temperature (37°C). 
Cholesterol is another main component of the liposome bilayer. It is incorporated to stabilize liposomal 
phospholipid membranes from disruption by plasma proteins, to decrease binding of plasma opsonins 
responsible for rapid clearance of liposomes from the circulation, and to decrease permeability of solutes/drugs 
in combination with bilayer forming phospholipids. 
MPEG-2000-DSPE is a minor component of the liposome bilayer. Its presence on the surface provides a minimal 
steric barrier preventing liposome aggregation. MPEG-2000-DSPE coated liposomes are shown to be stable with 
respect to size and drug-encapsulation. Mean molecular weight and polydispersity index is included in the 
specification. Stability of MPEG-2000-DSPE has been discussed and considered acceptable. 
The liposomes are dispersed in an aqueous buffered solution consisting of HEPES buffer, sodium chloride, and 
water for injections. 
HEPES is a novel excipient. Detailed information on the manufacture, characterization and controls, justification 
of its use and a summary of supporting toxicology data for HEPES was requested by the CHMP during the 
assessment procedure and the provided data was considered satisfactory. 
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
In the initial stages of the manufacturing process of the finished product, irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate 
active substance is dissolved in a dextrose solution. It is subsequently mixed with formed liposomes and 
precipitated and encapsulated as irinotecan sucrose octasulphate (sucrosofate) salt within a liposome, using an 
active drug loading process. The hydrochloride counter ion is replaced with sucrosofate resulting in the 
formation of irinotecan sucrosofate salt within the liposome. Sucrosofate is encapsulated in the liposome with 
the active substance. A scientific discussion on physicochemical characterisation of liposomes was presented in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 18/107 
  
  
the dossier. It included entrapment volume, morphology using cryoTEM analysis, particle size, particle size 
distribution, percent encapsulated drug, drug to phospholipid ratio, lipid impurity, DSPC to cholesterol ratio, in 
vitro release, zeta potential, and pH. 
The formulation used during phase 3 clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
The results of the comparability study between the two formulations (used in phase 1 and phase 2 studies, and 
phase 3 studies and commercial manufacture, respectively) demonstrate that products manufactured by both 
processes meet release criteria with no significant differences in quality attributes. Additional physico-chemical 
characterization and purity analysis (including lipid analysis, in vitro drug release assay, liposome morphology 
and size analysis) found no significant differences between both processes except for improved lower levels of 
lysophosphatidylcholine impurity. Stability studies of the drug products were performed to help detect 
differences that are not readily detectable by the characterization studies. There were no significant differences 
in quality attributes between the initial process and the phase 3 process after four weeks of storage under stress 
stability conditions (30 ± 2°C). The provided comparability study between the initial process and the process 
used to manufacture phase 3 and commercial batches was found acceptable. 
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
The Quality Target Product Profile was to develop a medicinal product conforming to: an intravenous infusion of 
sterile liposomes, that is white to slightly yellow, opaque, packaged in a 10 mL single use glass vial. Irinotecan 
is encapsulated as irinotecan sucrose octasulphate salt, in a long circulating liposome composed of cholesterol, 
DSPC, and mPEG-2000-DSPE. Each 10 mL vial contains the equivalent of 50 mg irinotecan (reported on the 
hydrochloride trihydrate basis) at a concentration of 5 mg/mL irinotecan (4.3 mg/mL as reported on the 
anhydrous free base form). It is stable for 24-36 Months at 2-8°C.  
The critical quality attributes (CQAs) identified were: visual appearance, irinotecan identity, lipid identity, 
cholesterol identity, irinotecan concentration, percent encapsulated drug, irinotecan impurities, lipid impurity, 
residual solvents, bacterial endotoxins, bioburden and sterility, drug to phospholipid ratio, DSPC to cholesterol 
ratio, extractable volume in container, in vitro release, osmolality, particle size, particle size distribution, 
particulate matter in injections, pH, and zeta potential. 
The manufacturing process has been evaluated through the use of risk assessments to identify the critical 
product quality attributes and critical process parameters. A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode 
effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an 
influence on the finished product quality attributes. The critical process parameters have been adequately 
identified. 
The in vitro release method was designed to detect defective, incorrectly formulated or degraded liposomes; 
which could potentially affect the release of the active substance from the encapsulating vesicle. Discriminating 
ability of the method has been demonstrated with a series of studies which included a generation of defective 
liposomes and use of the model independent approach using similarity and difference factors applied to compare 
the in vitro release results. 
The product is manufactured using sterile filtration and aseptic filling. Due to the nature of the finished product 
which is a liposome formulation with a phase transition temperature of the lipid membrane of 55 °C, terminal 
sterilisation by moist heat in line with decision trees for sterilisation choices for aqueous products is not possible. 
The sterilisation method was therefore appropriately justified. 
The primary packaging is type I glass vial with a grey chlorobutyl stopper. The container closure of the finished 
product is sealed by an aluminium seal with a flip-off cap. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 19/107 
  
  
requirements. Compatibility studies were performed and demonstrated the compatibility of the finished product 
diluted in 5% dextrose and 0.9% saline at concentrations ranging from 0.2 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL with standard 
intravenous bags and infusion sets. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: liposome formation (lipid dissolution, multi lamellar 
vesicle (MLV) formation and small unilamellar vesicle (SUV) formation and sizing), active drug loading 
(diafiltration, drug loading), bulk drug product formulation, filling finish including bioburden reduction and 
sterile filtration, and labelling and packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing 
process. 
Process validation for the manufacture of the finished product has been performed on three commercial scale 
batches in two discrete steps (bulk product manufacturing process and filling finish manufacturing step) in line 
with the traditional approach to process validation. In addition three scale down validation runs with bacterial 
challenge were performed in support of the validation of filters used to sterilise the product prior to the filling 
process. Additional validation studies included aseptic process validation, steam sterilisation validation (for the 
container closure of the finished product, and the components and equipment parts required for filling of the 
vials), dry oven validation (used to depyrogenate non-heat liable materials used in the manufacturing process), 
and container closure validation. 
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
(Ph. Eur.), irinotecan identity (HPLC, UV), DSPC identity (HPLC-ELSD), cholesterol identity (HPLC-ELSD), 
MPEG2000-DSPE identity (HPLC-ELSD), irinotecan concentration (assay) (HPLC-UV), percent encapsulated 
drug (HPLC-UV), irinotecan impurities (HPLC-UV), lipid impurity (HPLC-ELSD), residual solvents (GC), residual 
trimethylamine (GC-FID), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), drug to phospholipid ratio 
(calculation), DSPC to cholesterol ratio (calculation), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), in vitro release (HPLC-UV), 
osmolality (Ph. Eur.), particle size (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter in injections 
(Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur), and zeta potential (in house). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
of the active substance and of the excipients has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 11 commercial scale batches and additional 23 pilot or lab scale batches, 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 20/107 
  
  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches and three additional pilot or lab scale batches of finished 
product stored under long term conditions for up to 30 months at 2 °C – 8 °C and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions at 25 ± 2 °C / 60±5% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of 
medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance (Ph. Eur.), irinotecan concentration (assay) (HPLC-UV), percent 
encapsulated drug (HPLC-UV), irinotecan impurities (HPLC-UV), lipid impurity (HPLC-ELSD), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), container closure integrity (in house), in vitro drug release (HPLC-UV), 
osmolality (Ph. Eur.), particle size (Ph. Eur.), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter in injections 
(Ph. Eur.), and pH (Ph. Eur). 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes have been observed during long 
term and accelerated stability testing. Additional data from bulk finished product batches stored under 
accelerated conditions showed an increase in osmolality and irinotecan concentration, which was not observed 
in the vialled finished product. These results are consistent with a small loss of water from the bulk 
polycarbonate stability containers. For both bulk and vialled finished product, irinotecan impurities and lipid 
impurities increased slightly, but remained within the specification limit. These results confirm the expected 
irinotecan degradation and lipid hydrolysis seen at higher temperatures under temperature stress conditions. 
In addition, three batches of both bulk and vialled finished product were exposed to light as defined in the ICH 
Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results from this study showed a 
decrease in pH (related to LysoPC impurity and associated stearic acid increase) and irinotecan concentration, 
and an increase in irinotecan and lipid impurities. No significant change was observed in percent encapsulated 
drug, in vitro release, osmolality or particle size distribution. These data demonstrate that the finished product 
is sensitive to light and should be protected from light exposure. 
Additional results on three batches of the finished product used in stress studies were provided. These included 
freeze-thaw cycling (3 cycles of overnight exposure at -20°C followed by a minimum of 3 hours at ambient room 
temperature (~20°C)), demonstrating a decrease in percent encapsulated drug outside the specification limit. 
An increase in irinotecan impurities, lipid impurities and particle size was observed, but they remained within the 
specification limits. Particle size distribution showed variable results likely caused by freeze/thaw stress. No 
significant change was observed in irinotecan concentration, in vitro release, pH or osmolality. The data are 
consistent with expected loss of liposome integrity, potential liposome aggregation and leakage of the irinotecan 
from the liposome during freeze-thawing. The product is sensitive to freezing and thawing and therefore should 
be protected from freezing. 
Finally, results from three batches of the finished product on thermal stress conditions (40 ± 2°C or 50 ± 2°C for 
4 weeks) were provided.  A decrease in percent encapsulated drug outside the specification limit, and an 
increase in irinotecan and lipid impurities within specification limits were observed, demonstrating that the 
finished product is heat sensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 30 months for an unopened vial when stored in a 
refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C) and in the outer carton in order to protect from light, as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3) are acceptable. The medicinal product must not be frozen. 
Chemical and physical stability for the diluted solution for infusion has been demonstrated at 15-25°C for up to 
6 hours or in the refrigerator (2ºC - 8ºC) for no more than 24 hours. The finished product was diluted in 5% 
Assessment report

dextrose or 0.9% saline to 0.2, 0.48 (in dextrose only) and 2.0 mg/mL and held for 24 hours at 2-8 °C or 6 hours 
at room temperature prior to being infused for 90 minutes using an infusion pump. The samples were analyzed 
for visual appearance, pH, concentration, purity and identity of irinotecan, drug encapsulation ratio, particle size 
and for di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) from the PVC infusion bags. 
DEHP levels were below the detection limit in samples with lower irinotecan hydrochloride concentrations 
(0.2mg/mL and 0.48mg/mL), which corresponds to the commercial dose. The levels of DEHP detected in the 
high concentration samples correspond to a worst case exposure of 500 μg of DEHP per day, assuming an 
infusion volume of 500 mL. These levels were below (1% or less of) the parenteral tolerable intake level of 0.6 
mg/kg/day (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Safety Assessment 
of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) Released from PVC Medical Devices, July 2002). Exposure of patients to 
DEHP at these doses is not expected to result in adverse effects. 
The data demonstrate the compatibility of the drug product diluted in 5% dextrose or 0.9% saline at 
concentrations ranging from 0.2 mg/mL to 2 mg/mL with standard intravenous bags and infusion sets. 
Adventitious agents 
Cholesterol obtained from sheep wool is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the cholesterol 
used in the manufacture is provided. No other excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
Onivyde is a concentrate for solution for infusion with irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate, a semi synthetic 
active substance in a liposomal formulation. 
These liposomes are unilamellar lipid bilayer vesicles, approximately 110 nm in diameter, which encapsulate 
irinotecan in a gelated or precipitated state, as sucrosofate salt. Sucrosofate salt is considered a novel excipient 
and it has been chosen as the optimal counter ion for precipitating, loading and retaining of the active substance 
within the liposome.  The liposomes are dispersed in an aqueous buffered solution, containing HEPES which is a 
zwitterionic buffer and a novel excipient. 
The liposomal formulation of irinotecan is designed to prolong circulation of the active substance in plasma and  
increase the delivery of the active substance in tumours to take advantage of the compromised vasculatures of 
tumours. 
The pharmaceutical development was focused on 1) the selection of an optimal counter ion for active drug 
loading, 2) the selection of an optimal ratio of DSPC to cholesterol components of the lipid membrane which 
influence its physical properties and the capability of retaining the active substance in the liposome, 3) the 
selection of MPEG-2000-DSPE component of the liposome bilayer whose presence on the surface provides a 
steric barrier to avoid liposome aggregation, and 4) the selection of an appropriate buffer capable of retaining 
the optimal pH range for the concentrate for solution for infusion. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a 
minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. The Applicant is

requested to resolve the requirement of GMP compliance for the entire route of synthesis of the active 
substance, as a legally binding measure: 
To introduce the revised and agreed synthetic process for the manufacture of the active substance from the 
agreed starting materials by 31/12/2016. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Onivyde (also referred to as MM-398) is a liposome of ~100 nm average diameter that encapsulates the active 
pharmaceutical ingredient irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11). Irinotecan is a known active substance and its 
mechanism of action was previously established in primary pharmacology studies. No such studies have been 
performed with the new formulation Onivyde. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
Three in vitro studies on murine and human cell lines, and tumour tissue lysates from patients or mouse models 
were provided, aiming at investigating MM-398 liposomal uptake/release at the cellular level and irinotecan 
(CPT-11) conversion into its active metabolite (SN-38). Furthermore, a recent publication profiling MM-398 
PK/PD model in a colon cancer model was provided (Kalra et al., 2014). 
Murine and human macrophage-like cell lines were shown to accumulate 10-40 times higher levels of liposomes 
as compared to tumour cell lines. Uptake of liposomes led to the release of irinotecan from macrophage cell 
lines. In experiments on tumour tissue lysates, including pancreatic, and human macrophage-like cells, 
enzymatic conversion of irinotecan to the active metabolite SN-38 (100-1000x more active than irinotecan) was 
demonstrated. 
In vivo studies 
In a series of in vivo pharmacology studies in xenograft tumour models of human breast, gastric, pancreatic, 
cervical, brain and colon cancer, the Applicant compared the efficacy of MM-398 relative to equivalent or higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 23/107 
  
  
dosing levels of free irinotecan. Generally, increased efficacy (measured as significant inhibition of tumour 
growth) was achieved with MM-398. In view of the present indication, the pancreatic tumour studies are of 
special interest. The efficacy of MM-398 was evaluated in several orthotopic and ectopic xenograft models of 
pancreatic cancer. MM-398 showed more potent anti-tumour activity, including durable tumour regression, 
compared to the equivalent dose of free irinotecan, in an orthotopic L3.6pl-T tumour model. Best effect in this 
model was obtained when using EGFR-targeted MM-398.  Treatment with MM-398 also caused reduced tumour 
growth and a lower metastatic burden in an orthotopic BxPC3 tumour model, and decreased tumour hypoxia 
preceding tumour regression in the high-hypoxia OCIP51 orthotopic model.  
During the procedure, the Applicant submitted a new pharmacology study report (MM-398-NC-N-Ph-027), 
evaluating antitumor activity of MM-398 against ectopic patient-derived pancreatic cancer xenografts in SCID 
mice. The results have been summarized by the Applicant in the table below.

Dosing schedules 
In studies using a q4d schedule, body weight losses in the range of 10-20% were observed. This effect was 
diminished when a q7d schedule was applied, which more closely resembles the clinical treatment regimen. No 
study employing the clinical q14d schedule was conducted.  
Combination studies 
Combination studies with Onivyde and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin, in xenograft models of colon and 
cervical cancer, respectively, demonstrated more potent effects than when the substances were administered as 
single agents. No combination studies were performed in pancreatic cancer models.  
Mechanistic studies 
Onivyde distribution and uptake were investigated in an orthotropic intracranial xenograft model of glioblastoma 
in rats. Intracranial delivery of MM-398 caused increased retention time (22 times higher t ½) in the brain as 
compared with free irinotecan. This correlated with increased survival. In contrast, iv administration of MM-398 
in the same tumour model did not result in increased brain tissue retention, although the tissue exposure in 
terms of Cmax and AUC was higher than that achieved with free irinotecan. Survival was increased in rats treated 
with MM-398. 
Further investigation of the relationship between tissue pharmacokinetics and tumour treatment efficacy was 
conducted in a xenograft colon cancer model in mice, comparing Onivyde and free irinotecan (iv administration). 
Despite equal SN-38 exposure (plasma, tumour) the liposomal formulation resulted in 2-2.7 times better 
tumour growth control.  
Tumour hypoxia is linked to aggressive disease progression and resistance to therapy. To investigate effects on 
hypoxia the Applicant conducted a non-invasive FAZA PET study in the HT-29 colon cancer model, monitoring 
changes in the tumour microenvironment after treatment with MM-398 or free irinotecan at similar SN-38 
exposure in the tumour. Tumours in mice treated with MM-398 at 10 mg/kg bw showed significantly lower levels 
of hypoxia compared to those treated with CPT-11 at 50 mg/kg bw. Tumour growth was also significantly 
reduced in mice treated with MM-398 at 10 mg/kg bw, as compared with treatment with CPT-11 at 50 mg/kg 
bw.  
In a final mechanistic study the Applicant performed flow cytometry analysis on cell suspensions from tumour 
tissue to investigate the distribution of fluorescently-tagged liposomes in various animal tumour models. The 
results showed that F4/80-positive mature macrophages accumulated a larger proportion of the overall cellular 
liposomal load relative to their population size compared to other myeloid or non-myeloid cell populations. 
Macrophage and myeloid populations accounted for 78-94% of the cellular liposomal uptake.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
A study in conscious telemetered Beagle dogs was conducted to assess the effect of MM-398 on the 
cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Single iv infusion with MM-398 at doses up to 21 mg/kg (420 mg/m2) 
had no effect on cardiovascular, hemodynamic, electrocardiographic, respiratory parameters, or body 
temperature. The maximum plasma concentrations of irinotecan and SN-38 at the end of infusion were 7.5x and 
3.6x above therapeutic Cmax respectively.

No CNS safety pharmacology study was conducted.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies were performed with Onivyde to evaluate pharmacodynamic drug interactions.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics of irinotecan and the active metabolite SN-38 have been studied in 
relevant animal species, i.e. rats, dogs and tumour bearing mice, following IV administration of single and 
repeat doses of liposome encapsulated irinotecan (MM-398) and unencapsulated irinotecan (CPT-11). The TK 
analysis of the two pivotal toxicity studies in rats and dogs was not GLP compliant and is thus not considered 
valid to support the interpretation of these studies (see further under Toxicology). 
In all studies, total irinotecan levels (i.e. liposome encapsulated irinotecan and free irinotecan) were measured 
and used for the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan. Determination of encapsulated irinotecan in 
dogs following an IV single bolus dose of 10 mg/kg Onivyde showed a stable degree of 75 to 86% encapsulation 
up to the last determination 36 hours post-dose which indicates that the concentrations of total irinotecan 
represent encapsulated irinotecan to a corresponding degree.  
Absorption 
Single doses of 90 min IV infusions of MM-398 to SD rats and Beagle dogs showed some deviations from dose 
proportional plasma exposure (in terms of AUC) for irinotecan at the dose levels studied (higher than dose 
proportional from the low [6 mg/kg] to the mid [20 mg/kg] dose in rats and from the mid [30 mg/kg] to the high 
[50 mg/kg] in dogs. For SN-38 the increase in AUC was overall approximately dose proportional in dogs but 
generally less than dose proportional in rats.  
When compared at the same dose level (20 mg/kg in rats and 30 mg/kg in dogs) the AUC of irinotecan and 
SN-38 was higher for MM-398 than for unencapsulated irinotecan in rats (approximately 1700-fold and 90-fold, 
respectively) and dogs (approximately 40-fold and 3-fold, respectively). Terminal elimination half-life of 
irinotecan and SN-38 was longer for Onivyde (10 and 15h, respectively, in rats; 13h for both analytes in dogs) 
than following unencapsulated irinotecan (0.7 and 11h, respectively, in rats; 4.3 and 6.2h, respectively in dogs).  
Repeated doses of 90 min IV infusions of MM-398 once every third week for 18 weeks to rats and dogs showed 
approximately dose proportional plasma exposure (in terms of AUC) for irinotecan at the dose levels studied in 
rats (30, 75 and 190 mg/kg) and dogs (9, 15 and 21 mg/kg). For SN-38 the increase in total AUC was overall 
approximately dose proportional in dogs but generally less than dose proportional in rats. The accumulation of 
irinotecan was about 2-fold in rats but there was no evidence for accumulation of SN-38 in rats or of irinotecan 
and SN-38 in dogs. 
When compared at the same dose level (75 mg/kg in rats and 21 mg/kg in dogs) the AUC of irinotecan and 
SN-38 was higher for MM-398 than for unencapsulated irinotecan in rats (approximately 1000-fold and 50-fold, 
respectively) and dogs (approximately 150-fold and 3-fold, respectively). Terminal elimination half-life of 
irinotecan and SN-38 was longer for Onivyde (33 and 323h, respectively, in rats; 12 and 35h, respectively, in 
dogs) than following unencapsulated irinotecan (4.9 and 6.1h, respectively, in rats; 2.8 and 5.1h, respectively 
in dogs). MRT0-168 values for irinotecan and SN-38 were also longer for MM-398 (22.0 to 22.9h and 40.1 to 
53.8h, respectively, in dogs) than for unencapsulated CPT-11 (3.4 to 4.1h and 4.8 to 6.0h, respectively, in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 26/107 
  
  
dogs). The very long half-life of SN-38 in rats is likely due to the presence in rodent species of a plasma 
carboxylesterase activity that contributes to the systemic levels of SN-38 after administration of MM-398.  
Distribution 
Quantitative whole-body autoradiography following a single 90 min IV infusion of 10 mg/kg 14C-MM-398 and 
unencapsulated 14C-CPT-11 in Long Evans rats showed a wide distribution to tissues for both formulations with 
the highest concentrations generally observed at the end of the infusion. For several of the tissues (e.g. 
including CNS, pigmented skin, liver [and bile], kidney, epididymis, testis, lung, trachea, heart, bone marrow, 
blood and spleen) the concentrations of radioactivity was higher for 14C-MM-398 than for unencapsulated 
14C-CPT-11 with the highest levels for 14C-MM-398 in plasma, bile and spleen. Tissue levels generally remained 
higher for a longer period following 14C-MM-398. These results were supported by another study which showed 
increased levels and prolonged duration in plasma, spleen, and liver of total irinotecan and/or SN-38 for MM-398 
as compared to unencapsulated CPT-11 following a single bolus IV infusion of 10 mg/kg. 
The radioactive levels in the gastro-intestinal contents of rats were much higher for unencapsulated 14C-CPT-11 
than for14C-MM-398 and the levels of irinotecan and SN-38 in intestines (with contents) in tumour bearing mice 
after a single IV bolus administration of 40 mg/kg were in general higher for unencapsulated CPT-11 than for 
MM-398. Together the results indicate a slower elimination of MM-398 than of unencapsulated CPT-11. This is a 
possible explanation for the increased and prolonged plasma and tissue levels observed for MM-398.  
While the relative proportions of radioactivity in brain versus plasma were lower for 14C-MM-398 than for 
unencapsulated drug, the absolute radioactive concentrations were 18x higher in the CNS of rats given 
14C-MM-398. This indicates that MM-398 may be able to pass the blood brain barrier Alternatively, the higher 
CNS concentrations could be due to a longer plasma half-life of MM-398. Retention of 14C-MM-398-derived 
radioactivity in the uvea of the eye may indicate binding to ocular melanin. A lower distribution of radioactivity 
into the cellular fraction of blood following 14C-MM-398 than following unencapsulated 14C-CPT-11 was also 
indicated. 
In tumour bearing mice, highest tissue exposure to irinotecan and SN-38 for MM-398 in terms of Cmax and 
AUC0-∞ was obtained in the liver whereas tumours had the lowest Cmax of irinotecan, and lowest Cmax and AUC0-∞ 
of SN-38. The AUCs of irinotecan and SN-38 in plasma, organs and tumours were increased for MM-398 as 
compared to unencapsulated CPT-11. For irinotecan the largest increase was observed in tumours (28-fold) 
whereas for SN-38, the increase in tumours (6-fold) was lower than in the liver (16-fold) and the kidney 
(10-fold). Following MM-398, Cmax of irinotecan was increased in tumours but to a slight extent also in the liver, 
1.6-fold and 1.1-fold, respectively. For SN-38, Cmax was increased in liver and kidney but decreased in tumours 
and in small and large intestine. The MRT and t½ of irinotecan and SN-38 were increased for MM-398 as 
compared to unencapsulated CPT-11 and were longer in tumours than in the other tissues (at least 
approximately 3-fold for irinotecan and 2-fold for SN-38). According to the Applicant the increase in Cmax of 
irinotecan in tumours together with a longer duration in tumours as compared to other tissues indicate 
favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics for MM-398 both with respect to efficacy and safety. 
Metabolism 
After release from the Onivyde liposomes, irinotecan is expected to follow the same metabolic fate as 
unencapsulated irinotecan. The active metabolite SN-38 is reported to be formed from irinotecan via 
carboxylesterase-mediated cleavage in the liver and intestines. Plasma carboxylesterase activity and possibly 
more efficient carboxylesterases in rodents suggest that exposure comparisons from dog studies may be more 
relevant for the estimation of margins to human exposure. The active SN-38 is further metabolised to the 
inactive SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G) via uridine-5’-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A isoforms in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 27/107 
  
  
the liver and subsequent deglucuronidation by intestinal β-glucuronidase. Irinotecan is also metabolised by 
CYP3A4 to various oxidative metabolites, including APC and NPC. While NPC can be converted to SN-38 by 
carboxylesterases, APC is not and does most likely not contribute directly to the activity and toxicity profile of 
irinotecan in vivo.  
Excretion 
A mass balance study of a single 90 min IV infusion of 5 mg/kg encapsulated 14C-CPT-11 in intact and bile duct 
cannulated SD rats showed that faecal excretion was the major route for excretion in intact rats with 78.3 to 
83.4% and 16.5 to 22.9% of the radioactive dose detected in faeces and urine, respectively, and that biliary 
excretion represented 77% of the faecal excretion.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of Onivyde (MM-398) was characterized in mice, rats and dogs. The in life-phase of the 
pivotal toxicity studies in rats and dogs was GLP compliant; however, the TK/bioanalysis part was not (see 
below). The study package comprised single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 18-weeks duration 
(dosing once every third weeks, in total 6 cycles), and an in vitro blood compatibility study.  The genotoxic, 
carcinogenic, reproductive and developmental toxicity potential of the API irinotecan has been determined 
previously. Ninety (90)-minute intravenous (iv) dosing has been used in all in vivo studies, as this is the 
administration route that will be used clinically.  
The general scientific integrity and validity of the pivotal toxicity studies was called into question, considering a 
number of GLP issues that needed to be addressed. The Applicant clarified that at the time of the initiation of the 
two pivotal studies, the test facility where the in life phase of both pivotal toxicity studies [6-cycle rat 
(PEP02-NC-G-Tx-010, 1005-3071) and dog (PEP02-NC-G-Tx-011, 1006-2162)] has been performed, was under 
OECD compliant GLP monitoring. Moreover, the full GLP compliance status of the in life phase of the two studies 
has been confirmed by a dedicated GLP Study Audit (Study audit report 15842) performed at the CiToxLAB 
facility, in November 2015 as part of a biannual routine inspection program. However, the Monitoring Authority 
could not comment on the GLP status of the TK/bioanalytical phase of the studies performed at non-OECD 
subcontractor sites, therefore the audit does not cover the GLP status of the TK/bioanalytical analyses and this 
data cannot be used to support the interpretation of the study results. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose studies were performed in ICR mice, Sprague Dawley rats and Beagle dogs. The approximate lethal 
dose in mice was 200 mg/kg for both MM-398 and CPT-11. Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was evident. Doses of 
MM-398 at ≥400mg/kg caused thymus atrophy, spleen atrophy and pale liver.   
In rats, 960 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg were lethal doses in MM-398 and CPT-11 dosed animals, respectively. Main 
clinical signs were dose-dependent GI toxicity, hypoactivity and irregular respiration. Body weight reductions 
were evident in all dose groups. Rats dosed with MM-398 at ≥480 mg/kg showed reductions in leukocytes that 
partly recovered before termination of the study. 
Dogs exposed to MM-398 and CPT-11 showed pronounced GI toxicity including emesis and diarrhoea. All 
treatment groups showed dose-dependent reductions in leukocytes. Preterminally euthanized animals had small 
spleens and thymuses. All exposed groups showed reductions in body weight and food consumption. The 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 15 mg/kg bw (300 mg/m2). The exposure margin from MTD to human 
therapeutic dose (80 mg/m2) was 3.8x.

Preterminal mortalities and unscheduled sacrifice of animals occurred in all repeat-dose toxicity studies with 
CPT-11 and MM-398. A clear species difference in sensitivity was observed. Despite high exposure to irinotecan 
and SN-38, only occasional rats treated with MM-398 or CPT-11 were found dead or preterminally sacrificed. In 
most cases, the cause of death was unrelated to the compound. In the 4-week study, one female rat died after 
treatment with MM-398 at a dose of 260mg/kg (1560 mg/m2) on SD 13. No specific cause of death was 
determined. In the 18-week study, one male dosed with MM-398 at 190 mg/kg (1140 mg/m2) was euthanized 
during the recovery period due to deteriorating condition. The margins between these mortalities and the 
human therapeutic dose are in the range of 14-19x.  
In contrast, dogs showed severe GI toxicity at relatively low doses, causing preterminal sacrifice of two males 
treated at 16 mg/kg (320 mg/m2) in the 4-week study. Both dogs had evidence of GI bleeding, and

histopathology revealed mucosal hemorrhage and atrophy, and crypt epithelial necrosis. The margin between 
the dose of irinotecan causing mortality in the 4-week dog study and the human therapeutic dose is 4x.  
In the dog 6-cycle study, a total of 13 dogs were found dead and an additional 6 dogs were removed from the 
study early. Changes in the bone marrow, GI tract and lymphoid tissues accounted for the mortality in the 
majority of dogs (see below). At LOAEL for mortality (21 mg/kg bw = 420 mg/m2) the margin to human 
therapeutic dose of irinotecan was 5x. 
Gastrointestinal tract 
The GI tract was a target of toxicity for MM-398 and CPT-11 in the repeat-dose toxicity testing. The effects were 
not as dramatic as in the single-dose studies, since the doses used were lower. In rats, the GI-effects were 
mainly limited to reductions in food consumption and body weight decrease. Body weights were 
dose-dependently decreased immediately following the 90-minute infusions but returned to control levels within 
9 days in the 6 cycle study. Food consumption decreased in all dose-groups but returned to control levels in 
males during recovery. CPT-11 caused less pronounced effects on body weight and food consumption as 
compared to MM-398 at the same dose.  
In dogs, the high dose group (16mg/kg) in the 4–week study showed reductions in food intake with 
accompanying reductions in body weight. Two preterminally sacrificed dogs showed GI haemorrhage, intestinal 
mucosal atrophy and crypt epithelial necrosis (see above). In the 6-cycle study, all dose groups showed 
transient reduction in food intake, but no significant reduction in body weight. Pre-terminally dead/euthanized 
dogs at ≥ 21 mg/kg showed intestinal crypt epithelium necrosis and dilatation, mucosal villous atrophy, and 
congestion/haemorrhage.  MM-398 and CPT-11 caused similar GI toxicity in dogs when given at the same dose.  
Bone marrow 
Bone marrow hypocellularity, reflected by peripheral haematology effects, was consistently found in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies. In the 4-week rat study, red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin (HGB) and white blood 
cells (WBC) were dose-dependently decreased and platelets (in males) were dose-dependently increased at 
MM-398 doses from 65 to 260 mg/kg. Similar effects were seen with CPT-11 at the same dose (130 mg/kg). 
Bone marrow hypocellularity was observed in MM-398 high dose (260 mg/kg) rats in the 4-week study, and at 
190 mg/kg in the 18-week study. Female dogs exposed to 8 mg/kg MM-398 in the 4-week study showed 
reversible neutropenia. In the 18-week study, bone marrow hypocellularity was observed in pre-terminally 
dead/euthanized dogs treated with MM-398 or CPT-11 at > 21 mg/kg bw.  Dogs treated with MM-398 at 
≥15mg/kg and with CPT-11 at 21 mg/kg had decreased levels of RBC, HGB, haematocrit and WBC.  
Lymphoid organs 
Lower thymus weights (32-80%) were observed in rats exposed to MM-398 ≥65mg/kg once weekly for 4 weeks. 
These effects correlated with thymic atrophy that was dose-dependent in severity and frequency. Dogs exposed 
to 16mg/kg MM-398 or CPT-11 for 4 weeks showed slightly reduced thymus weights, but without microscopic 
correlation. In the 18-week study, pre-terminally dead/euthanized dogs treated with MM-398 or CPT-11 at > 21 
mg/kg showed lower thymus weights correlated with lymphoid atrophy/necrosis.  
Lymphoid atrophy/necrosis was present in the spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer´s patches of dogs treated with 
MM-398 at > 15 mg/kg, and with CPT-11 at 21 mg/kg, for 18 weeks. Atrophy of Peyer´s patches was also 
present in dogs treated at > 8 mg/kg in the 4-week study.

Extramedullary haematopoiesis (EMH) was present in rats treated with CPT-11 (130mg/kg) in the 4-week study. 
In the 18-week rat study, all MM-398 exposed groups showed EMH in the spleen. In the 4-week dog study, 
splenic EMH was noted in the high dose MM-398 and CPT-11 groups. In the 18-week dog study, EMH was 
observed both in the spleen and liver in dogs treated with MM-398 at > 15 mg/kg and with CPT-11 at > 21 
mg/kg.  
Liver 
Liver weights were 6-24% lower in rats exposed to MM-398 ≥65mg/kg in the 4-weeks study. No microscopic 
correlation was found. Minimal to mild multifocal liver degeneration/necrosis (without effect on liver weight or 
serum chemistry parameters) was reported for all MM-398 exposure groups in the 6-cycle study in rats. No 
similar findings were present in dogs.  The margin between LOAEL (30 mg/kg = 180 mg/m2, incidence 1/40 rats) 
and human therapeutic dose of irinotecan is 2x.  
Vehicle-associated effects 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, vacuolation and histiocytosis in multiple organs were observed in all 
MM-398 dose groups, as well as in the vehicle control groups. These findings are considered to be related to 
phagocytosis of the liposome. On the whole, similar findings were seen in MM-398 treated animals and controls. 
Histiocytosis in the heart was only observed in rats treated with MM-398 at > 190 mg/kg (1140 mg/m2). In 
dogs, minimal histiocytosis in the spleen was present in vehicle controls and all MM-398 treated groups in the 
18-week study.  
Other findings 
Other findings related to administration of MM-398 included renal medullary tubular hypertrophy in rats at 260 
mg/kg in the 4-week study, decreased activated partial thromboplastin (APTT) in male rats at > 65 mg /kg in the 
4-week study, lower platelets, PCT and reticulocytes in dogs treated at > 15 mg/kg MM-398 or 21 mg/kg CPT-11 
in the dog 18-week study, and dental effects treated with MM-398 or CPT-11 in the rat 18 week-study.  
Reversibility 
All major findings related to treatment with MM-398 or CPT-11, and the vehicle-associated histiocytosis, were 
fully or partly reversible upon cessation of treatment. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been conducted with Onivyde. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with Onivyde. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with Onivyde.  
In the 4 week rat study, moderately lower prostate weights were reported in males at ≥65mg/kg MM-398. 
Histopathology showed mild atrophy of both prostate and seminal vesicles. In the 18 week study, 1 male rat in 
the high dose group had necrosis and atrophy of the testis unilaterally and severe aspermia of epididymis.  
Dogs exposed to 16mg/kg MM-398 or CPT-11 in the 4-week study showed slightly lower prostate and testis 
weights, but no histological correlation could be made. In dogs that were euthanized/removed early from the 
study in the 6-cycle study (> 21 mg/kg MM-398 or CPT-11), prostate and testes weight reductions of 45-73% 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 32/107 
  
  
were observed. Microscopically, the lower prostate and testes weights correlated with acinar atrophy and 
degeneration/necrosis of seminiferous epithelium, respectively. 
Ovary weight reduction of 16-24% without any obvious histopathological correlation was reported in the rat 
4-week study in females exposed to ≥65 mg/kg MM-398. In the 4-week dog study, lower uterus weight without 
any histopathological correlation was present at 16 mg/kg MM-398 or CPT-11. Decreased ovary and uterus 
weight, correlated with reduced number of follicles and atrophy, respectively, was observed in the 18-week dog 
study at > 21 mg/kg MM-398 or CPT-11.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic evaluations have been performed for both CPT-11 and MM-398 in single- and repeat-dose studies. 
These analyses were not GLP compliant and thus cannot be used to calculate margins to human therapeutic 
exposure. Some of the TK data suggests that the rat conversion of irinotecan to the active metabolite SN-38 is 
more efficient in the rat than in the dog. A possible explanation is that rodent species have a plasma 
carboxylesterase activity that contributes to the systemic levels of SN-38 after administration of irinotecan, 
while dogs and humans do not express plasma carboxylesterase enzymes.  
Local Tolerance  
Transitory skin reactions, including reddening and/or swelling and slow skin edema were seen in rats and/or 
dogs treated with MM-398 at ≥21 mg/kg. Similar findings were recorded also in animal receiving CPT-11 and 
empty liposomes, suggesting these effects were procedure-related.  
Other toxicity studies 
Haemolytic and flocculation potential 
The haemolytic and flocculation potential of MM-398 was tested in vitro using human whole blood and plasma. 
No haemolytic effect of MM-398 was observed, and although some flocculation was seen in the samples spiked 
with liposome or MM-398, this is not considered an issue for further consideration. 
Phototoxicity 
No phototoxicity studies were performed with MM-398. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant has performed a Phase I assessment, as specified in the ERA guideline. Since irinotecan is an 
ionisable compound, Log Dow values were applied instead of Log Kow. These values were determined 
experimentally according to the OECD 107 guideline. All three values were below the PBT action limit of 4.5, as 
specified in the ERA guideline.  
The original ERA document was updated in terms of recalculated PECsw based on refined Fpen value for the 
sought indication. The refined Fpen was calculated to 0.00001. Applying this value to the formula, the resultant 
PECsw is 0.00064 µg/l, which is below the threshold of 0.01 µg/l.  Thus there is no need for a Phase II 
environmental fate and effect analysis, provided that the Log Dow values can be supported by experimental 
data.

Anti-tumour efficacy and proof of principle have been demonstrated in various rodent tumour models, including 
pancreatic cancer. The results of these studies have provided the basis for dose setting and schedule in the 
clinic. Comparisons between liposome encapsulated irinotecan (MM-398) and non-liposomal irinotecan 
(CPT-11) suggest that the liposomal formulation exerts a more potent anti-tumour effect. 
Questions were raised about the role of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) as drug deposits for MM-398 
drug uptake/release, the distribution of Onivyde in tumours and the liposomal uptake capabilities by pancreatic 
cancer cells. The Applicant clarified that TAMs were not proposed to be the sole provider of tumour-based drug 
release. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis on several pancreatic cancer models showed 
liposome “hotspots” in perivascular areas of the tumour stroma, which is known to be enriched with TAMs in 
pancreatic cancer. Despite this, DNA damage was localized to tumour cells, proving drug release from the 
tumour stroma. 
Lack of proof-of-concept of sufficient tumour SN-38 level achievement after TAM drug uptake/release was raised 
as a concern. The Applicant provided data showing that tumour SN-38 levels at 72 h were consistent with 
concentrations needed to elicit cell death as determined from in vitro experiments. The relationship between 
SN-38 concentration and cell death was measured in a panel of pancreatic cell lines and found IC50 levels of less 
than 10 nM for a large number of cell line models. 
To address some uncertainties regarding the effect of Onivyde in animal models of pancreatic cancer, the 
Applicant submitted a new pharmacology study showing efficacy of Onivyde in three gemcitabine-resistant PDX 
models (#12424, #14312, #19015) as well as in two gemcitabine-sensitive PDX models (#14244, #15010). 
These results strengthen the non-clinical proof of concept for Onivyde. A comparison between MM-398 and 
unencapsulated irinotecan in a gemcitabine-sensitive PDX model showed significantly improved tumour growth 
inhibition (TGI) with Onivyde relative to unencapsulated irinotecan. Unfortunately, no comparison was made in 
a gemcitabine-resistant PDX model, which is the most relevant model for the sought indication. However, the 
Applicant submitted supportive data, showing consistently greater TGI upon treatment with Onivyde at lower

doses versus conventional irinotecan in cell-line derived pancreatic cancer models, including the 
gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 model. In summary, Onivyde at doses of 10-20 mg/kg bw (iv administration, q7d, 
3-5 doses in total) showed efficacy in several different mouse models of pancreatic cancer. This corresponds to 
an efficacious dose of 30-60 mg/m2 in mice, which is somewhat lower than the recommended starting dose of 
80 mg/m2 in patients. 
In a xenograft colon cancer model in mice, comparing Onivyde and free irinotecan (iv administration) a much 
better tumour growth control despite equal SN-38 exposure (plasma, tumour) was observed with the liposomal 
formulation. The key factor behind this effect was proposed to be the longer duration of SN-38 exposure in the 
tumour obtained with Onivyde as compared with free irinotecan administration. This notion is somewhat 
contradictory to the results obtained in the rat glioblastoma model, suggesting differences between tumours 
and/or species. 
Since irinotecan is a known active substance, the lack of secondary pharmacology studies is accepted. However, 
the Applicant’s assertion that topoisomerase I is the exclusive target for irinotecan is not agreed with. There are 
several reports in the literature, describing the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by irinotecan, at clinically 
relevant concentrations.  This mechanism has been proposed as an explanation for the cholinergic syndrome 
observed in some patients treated with irinotecan, although other mechanisms have also been implicated. 
Cholinergic syndrome is listed as an adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC. 
In safety pharmacology studies in dogs, ONIVYDE had no effect on cardiovascular, hemodynamic, 
electrocardiographic, or respiratory parameters at doses up to 21 mg/kg (420 mg/m2). The lack of CNS safety 
pharmacology study can be accepted based on the already known safety pharmacology profile of irinotecan, and 
the fact that clinical CNS effects (cholinergic syndrome) have already been identified. Furthermore, in a limited 
evaluation of CNS effects in the 18-week repeat dose toxicity study in rats doses of MM-398 up to 190 mg/kg bw 
did not produce any CNS-related signs, in contrast to free irinotecan at 75 mg/kg bw, which caused 
uncoordinated gait and tremor (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). According to the Applicant, this difference may be 
explained by the prevention of entry into the brain due to the size of the liposome being too large to pass 
through the blood brain barrier. On the other hand, iv administration of Onivyde gave higher concentrations of 
irinotecan and SN-38 in the brain as compared with CPT-11 in the rat glioblastoma model.   
The Applicant was asked to clarify the pharmacokinetics of Onivyde with regard to passage over the 
blood-barrier. It was suggested that the longer plasma half-life of Onivyde, causing extended systemically 
released irinotecan, was the most likely explanation for the higher concentrations of Onivyde in the brain versus 
non-liposomal irinotecan.  
Since irinotecan has been co-administered with 5-FU/LV in clinical practice, non-clinical studies on 
pharmacodynamic drug interactions are not considered needed.  
The Applicant was asked to clarify and discuss possible reasons for the large differences in half-life of SN-38 
between MM-398 and CPT-11. The Applicant clarified that in both non-clinical and clinical studies the half-life of 
SN-38, as measured from the time of injection of both liposomal and unencapsulated irinotecan formulations, 
was increased by liposomal encapsulation. This was considered to be the key mechanism behind drug retention 
in tumours. 
Single and repeat-dose non-GLP pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies in rat and dogs showed that MM-398 
results in higher plasma exposure (in terms of AUC) and a prolonged period in plasma of irinotecan and its active 
metabolite SN-38 as compared to non-liposomal irinotecan (CPT-11) when given at the same dose levels. This 
was related to slower CL, lower Vd, longer t½ and longer MRT for the MM-398 formulation. A wide distribution to 
tissues was observed and for several tissues the levels were increased and remained higher for a longer period 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 35/107 
  
  
following MM-398 as compared to CPT-11. In tumour bearing mice, the largest increase for MM-398 in tissue 
exposure in terms of AUC was observed in tumours for irinotecan, whereas for SN-38, the increase in tumours 
was lower than in the liver and the kidney. The MRT and t½ of irinotecan and SN-38 were also increased and were 
at least 2 to 3-fold longer in tumours than in the other tissues. While Cmax of irinotecan was increased in 
tumours, and to a slight extent also in the liver, Cmax of SN-38 was decreased in tumours but increased in liver 
and kidney following MM-398.  
Irinotecan is metabolised to SN-38 via carboxylesterase-mediated cleavage in the liver and intestines and 
CYP3A4 to APC and NPC, which can be converted to SN-38 by carboxylesterases. The active metabolite SN-38 
is further metabolised to the inactive SN-38 glucuronide via UGT1A isoforms in the liver and subsequent 
deglucuronidation by intestinal β-glucuronidase. Faecal excretion, of which a major part is represented by biliary 
excretion, was shown to be the major route for excretion of MM-398-derived radioactivity in rats. 
The doses chosen for the studies are appropriate to characterize the toxicity of Onivyde and to make proper 
hazard evaluations and risk assessments. 
Single dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies with MM-398 in mice, rats and dogs have identified the GI system 
and bone marrow as main target organs for toxicity. The severity of effects was dose related and reversible. The 
no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats and dogs following 90 min intravenous infusion of ONIVYDE 
once every 3 weeks for 18 weeks was at least 180 mg/m2. GI toxicity is a well-known adverse effect of 
irinotecan. Diarrhoea has been included as an important identified risk in the RMP for Onyvide, and reflected in 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the proposed SmPC. Bone marrow adverse effects have also previously been reported for 
irinotecan. Leukopenia/neutropenia and anaemia are included as important identified risks in the RMP for 
Onyvide, and have been included under sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the proposed SmPC. 
In addition, adverse effects have been observed in lymphoid organs, liver, and male and female reproductive 
organs. Some of the effects on lymphoid organs may be related to stress, while others appear to be secondary 
to bone marrow toxicity. The inclusion of Leukopenia as an important identified risk in the RMP for Onyvide is 
considered to cover the effects on lymphoid organs observed in the non-clinical repeat dose toxicity studies. The 
observed EMH in repeat dose toxicology studies is most likely a compensatory effect secondary to bone marrow 
toxicity and is not considered to be an adverse finding.  
Histiocytosis in multiple organs of animals administered MM-398 as well as in animals given vehicle control 
(empty liposome) reflects phagocytosis of the liposome and, in the absence of other associated toxicity, is not 
considered an adverse finding. Nevertheless, the Applicant was asked to discuss findings of non-reversible 
accumulation of foamy histiocytes in the lungs of control dogs and presence of foamy histiocytes in the spleen 
of recovery animals. The Applicant clarified that foamy histiocytes in the lungs were observed also in dogs 
treated with unencapsulated irinotecan, and that interstitial pulmonary disease (IPD) has been reported in 
patients treated with non-liposomal irinotecan. For that reason, ILD is included as an important potential risk in 
the RMP for Onivyde. With regard to foamy histiocytes in the spleen, this was concluded to be of negligible 
clinical relevance. 
All major toxicity findings, and the vehicle-associated histiocytosis, were fully or partially reversible upon 
cessation of treatment. Histiocytosis in the absence of signs of other toxicity (e.g. necrosis, inflammation) is not 
considered to be an adverse finding.  
Unencapsulated irinotecan (CPT-11), included for comparison in these studies, showed a similar though less 
pronounced toxicity profile. The reason for the more prominent toxicity seen with MM-398 is most likely the 
considerably higher exposures achieved with this formulation.

Non liposomal irinotecan and SN 38 were genotoxic in vitro in the chromosomal aberration test on CHO cells as 
well as in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice. However, in other studies with irinotecan they have been shown 
to be devoid of any mutagenic potential in the Ames test. For non liposomal irinotecan, in rats treated once a 
week during 13 weeks at the maximum dose of 150 mg/m², no treatment related tumours were reported 91 
weeks after the end of treatment. Under these conditions, there was a significant linear trend with dose for the 
incidence of combined uterine horn endometrial stromal polyps and endometrial stromal sarcomas. Due to its 
mechanism of action, irinotecan is considered a potential carcinogen (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Non liposomal irinotecan was teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses below the human therapeutic dose. In rats, 
pups born from treated animals and having external abnormalities showed a decrease in fertility. This was not 
seen in morphologically normal pups. In pregnant rats there was a decrease in placental weight and in the 
offspring a decrease in foetal viability and increase in behavioural abnormalities. 
Non liposomal irinotecan caused atrophy of male reproductive organs both in rats and dogs after multiple daily 
doses of 20 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg, respectively. These effects were reversible upon cessation of treatment.  
Adequate information has been reflected in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC for Onivyde. 
According to the distribution studies, MM-398 is distributed to the uvea. There is also UV absorbance at 360nm. 
The Applicant provided clinical data, emphasizing the lack of phototoxic events with unencapsulated irinotecan 
as well as the absence of such findings in the NAPOLI study. Based on this data it is concluded that there is no 
specific concern regarding a risk for photosensitivity reactions associated with treatment using MM-398. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new toxicity issues have been identified with the liposomal formulation of irinotecan. Non-clinical GI and 
bone marrow toxicity of irinotecan are known to translate to the clinic. Both are included as important identified 
risks in the RMP for Onivyde.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The plasma pharmacokinetics of total irinotecan and total SN 38 were evaluated in patients with cancer who 
received Onivyde, as a single agent or as part of combination chemotherapy, at doses between 60 and 180 
mg/m2. 
Bioanalysis 
LC/MS/MS methods for determination of total irinotecan (encapsulated+un-encapsulated), the active 
metabolite SN-38 and the SN-38-glucuronide have been developed and pre-validated. A validated method for 
determination of liposome-encapsulated irinotecan and separation of un-encapsulated irinotecan is also 
reported. 
Absorption 
N/A 
Distribution 
Plasma exposure of total (encapsulated+un-encapsulated) irinotecan consists almost only of encapsulated 
irinotecan (the encapsulated form was 95.4% of the total and the un-encapsulated irinotecan, while not 
measured directly, was estimated to be <5%). 
The volume of distribution (Vd) estimates in patients administered with MM-398 were approximately 2 L/m2 (see 
table below). 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of total irinotecan and SN 38 analytes, following the administration of Onivyde 
80 mg/m2 are presented in the table below.

The plasma protein binding of Onivyde is negligible (< 0.44% of total irinotecan in Onivyde). The plasma protein 
binding of non-liposomal irinotecan is moderate (30% to 68%), and SN 38 is highly bound to human plasma 
proteins (approximately 95%). 
Table 7: In vitro plasma protein binding of MM-398 
Elimination 
The metabolic conversion of irinotecan to the active metabolite SN-38 is mediated by carboxylesterase 
enzymes. In vitro studies indicate that irinotecan, SN-38 and another metabolite aminopentane carboxylic 
acid (APC) do not inhibit cytochrome P-450 isozymes. SN-38 is subsequently conjugated predominantly by the 
enzyme UDP-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) to form a glucuronide metabolite. 
The systemic exposure of the active metabolite SN-38, following single iv infusions of 60-120 mg/m2 was 
<0.1% of the exposure of total irinotecan.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 41/107 
  
  
 
 
Preliminary data on systemic and local concentration in the tumour 72h post a single iv infusion of 80 mg/m2 
Onivyde, show that the local concentration in the tumour of SN-38 is about 4-fold higher compared to the 
plasma level of SN-38 (Study MM-398-01-01-02). The plasma level of total irinotecan is about double as high as 
the level in the tumour. 
SN-38 reached its Cmax after about 21h following treatment with Onivyde, its t 1/2 varied between ca 60-75h. 
UGT1A1 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity such 
as the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. Genotype frequency of genetic polymorphism of the UGT1A1 family has been 
performed for UGT1A1*28, *93 (UGT1A1 G3156A), *6, *27, *7 (UGT1A1T-3279G), *29, UGT1A9*22 (*1b) and 
DPYD*2A. No correlation between the different genes studied and PK of irinotecan/SN-38 were reported.  
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with ONIVYDE using the results of a subset with 
UGT1A1*28 genotypic testing, in which the analysis adjusted for the lower dose administered to patients 
homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele, patients homozygous (N=14) and non-homozygous (N=244) for this 
allele had total SN-38 average steady-state concentrations of 1.06 and 0.95 ng/ml, respectively. 
Both irinotecan and SN-38 are known to exist in an active lactone form and an inactive carboxylate form. 
The half-life (t 1/2) of total irinotecan following infusion of Onivyde varies between 12–55 h. In study PEP0206, 
the t 1/2 was calculated to 21 and 8 h following infusion with Onivyde and the commercial available irinotecan, 
respectively  
The urinary excretion of non-liposomal irinotecan is 11% to 20%; SN-38, <1%; and SN-38 glucuronide, 3%. 
The cumulative biliary and urinary excretion of irinotecan and its metabolites (SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide) 
over a period of 48 hours following administration of irinotecan in two patients ranged from approximately 25% 
(100 mg/m2) to 50% (300 mg/m2) (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Unchanged drug was the major excretion product in both urine and faeces (Table xxx).

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-proportionality 
In the literature, the exposure of irinotecan is reported to increase in a dose-proportional manner following iv 
infusion of a sterile solution (Mathijssen et al, 2001). 
 Following single doses of Onivyde 60-180 mg/m2, a dose proportional increase in exposure of total irinotecan 
was observed. Cmax of SN-38 increased dose-proportionally, but AUC increased less than dose-proportional.

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
No dedicated pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients with renal impairment. In a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, mild-to-moderate renal impairment had no effect on the exposure of total SN-38 after 
adjusting for BSA. The analysis included 68 patients with moderate (CLcr 30 - 59 mL/min), 147 patients with 
mild (CLcr 60 - 89 ml/min) renal impairment, and 135 patients with normal renal function (CLcr > 90 ml/min). 
There was insufficient data in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 ml/min) to assess its effect on 
pharmacokinetics (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Impaired hepatic function 
No dedicated pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. In a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, patients with baseline total bilirubin concentrations of 1-2 mg/dl (n=19) had average 
steady state concentrations for total SN-38 that were increased by 37% (0.98 [95%CI: 0.94 - 1.02] and 1.29 
[95%CI: 1.11 - 1.5] ng/ml, respectively) compared to patients with baseline bilirubin concentrations of < 1 
mg/dl (n=329); however, there was no effect of elevated ALT/AST concentrations on total SN-38 
concentrations. No data are available in patients with total bilirubin more than 2 times the ULN (see sections 4.2, 
4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Race 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis suggest that Asians have 56 % lower total irinotecan average steady 
state concentration (3.93 [95 %CI: 3.68- 4.2] and 1.74 [95 %CI: 1.58-1.93] mg/l, respectively) and 8 % higher

total SN-38 average steady state concentration (0.97 [95 %CI: 0.92-1.03] and 1.05 [95 %CI: 0.98-1.11] 
ng/ml, respectively) than Caucasians. 
Gender 
Gender was found as a covariate impacting the SN-38 exposure. Higher SN-38 concentrations were observed in 
females than in males: SN-38 Converted Cavg were 0.8 ng/mL in females and 0.7 ng/mL. The Applicant claimed 
this observation is likely confounded by the interaction between sex and BSA, as females had lower BSA 
compared to males (mean BSA of 1.8 m2 in males and 1.6 m2 in females). 
The effect of gender was not reported for un-encapsulated irinotecan. 
Weight 
In the PPK analysis, there was no association between BSA and race-adjusted concentrations for irinotecan. For 
SN 38, increased BSA was associated with lower SN-38 exposure (despite higher doses administered in patients 
with higher BSA). 
In the clinical studies, Onivyde was administered using BSA-based dosing. The proposed BSA-based dosing was 
further supported through simulations. Comparison of the simulated pharmacokinetic parameters for irinotecan 
and SN-38 was evaluated by simulating Cavg and Cmax if patients had been dosed with either a BSA-based dose 
of 80mg/m2 or an equivalent fixed dose of 135.73 mg (i.e., the nominal dose for a subject with median BSA). 
The analysis showed reduced variability in SN-38 Cmax with BSA-based dosing (in line with the results from the 
covariate analysis). The interquartile range for SN-38 Cmax was 74% with flat dose and 57% with BSA-based 
dose. 
Elderly 
The PopPK suggests that the effect of the covariate “age” had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of 
irinotecan and SN-38. No effect of age has been reported for un-encapsulated irinotecan. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Variability of pharmacokinetic parameters was assessed in the popPK analysis. Total irinotecan was modelled as 
a two-compartmental model with central clearance inter-individual variability (IIV) of 88% and central volume 
IIV of 49%. SN-38 was modelled as a one-compartmental model with central clearance IIV of 55%. 
The standard deviation of residual error was 0.30 and 0.16, for irinotecan and SN-38, respectively. 
High inter-individual variability, up to 75%, was seen in total exposure following 90-min iv infusions of Onivyde. 
PK in target population 
The PK following treatment with Onivyde has been studied in patients with solid tumours including patients with 
the proposed indication metastatic pancreatic cancer. The exposure of total irinotecan, both Cmax and AUC, 
were much higher following an iv infusion of 120 mg/m2 Onivyde compared to an infusion of 300 mg/m2 with the 
un-encapsulated irinotecan. The Cmax of SN-38 was about 5-fold higher after infusion with the commercial 
formulation compared to with Onivyde although the dose was just 2.5-fold higher. The total exposure of SN-38 
after treatment with the un-encapsulated irinotecan was about half compared to with Onivyde.

PPK analysis was conducted with the objectives of describing the PK profiles of total irinotecan (CPT11) and the 
active metabolite SN-38, and to evaluate the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. 
Data from six studies were used to build the model, and included 1800 factors samples (355 subjects) and 1773 
SN-38 samples (353 subjects). 
Methods 
Parameter estimations were performed using NONMEM version 7.3, with default setting FOCEI with Laplacian 
method. Measured concentrations below the limit of quantification were modelled as mixed continuous and 
categorical method (M3 method; Bergstrand & Karlsson, 2009). The M3 method was implemented using 
log-transformed values of concentration and the Laplacian estimation method. 
The covariates investigated for influence on the pharmacokinetic parameters of irinotecan included BSA and CL 
on central volume and on clearance, respectively. Other covariates explored were: 
•  BSA: body surface area; 
•  Measurements of hepatic function: AST, ALT, albumin, liver metastasis status, bilirubin, UGT1A1*28);  
Assessment report

•  Renal function: creatinine clearance; 
•  Demographics: sex, age, race; 
• 
 External functions: co-administration with 5-FU and manufacturing site. 
The covariate model was similar for SN-38, with the exception that the estimated clearance and volume of 
distribution of irinotecan, and manufacturing site were added as to the SN-38 input flux. 
Covariate relationships were investigated using a full-covariate method (Gastonguay 2011). Highly correlated 
covariates were evaluated, but only the most significant was retained and considered for further evaluation.  
Results 
The final model for irinotecan was a two-compartment model. The final model for SN-38 pharmacokinetic was a 
one-compartmental model with two input fluxes: 1) initial amount administered with Onivyde as an impurity 
within liposomes, and 2) in vivo conversion of irinotecan released from Onivyde. Final estimated parameters of 
irinotecan and SN-38 are shown in Table  and Table .

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal drug/drug interaction studies were performed. Information about drug interactions with Onivyde is 
referenced from the published scientific literature for nonliposomal irinotecan. 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers 
Patients receiving concomitant non-liposomal irinotecan and CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants 
phenytoin, phenobarbital or carbamazepine have substantially reduced exposure to irinotecan (AUC reduction 
by 12% with St John’s wort, 57%-79% with phenytoin, phenobarbital, or carbamazepine) and SN-38 (AUC 
reduction by 42% with St John’s wort, 36%-92% with phenytoin phenobarbital, or carbamazepine). 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and UGT1A1 inhibitors 
Patients receiving concomitant non-liposomal irinotecan and ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibitor, 
have increased SN-38 exposure by 109 %. Therefore, co-administration of Onivyde with other inhibitors of 
CYP3A4 (e.g. grapefruit juice, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole) may increase systemic exposure of Onivyde.

In study MM-398-07-03-01(NAPOLI 1) Onivyde was administered in combination with 5-Fluorouracil and 
Leucovorin. Co-administration of Onivyde with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin does not alter the pharmacokinetics of 
Onivyde based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The active substance of Onivyde is irinotecan which is encapsulated in long-circulating liposomes. The drug 
product liposome is a small unilamellar lipid bilayer vesicle, approximately 110 nm in diameter, which 
encapsulates an aqueous space which contains irinotecan in a gelated or precipitated state, as sucrosofate salt. 
Onivyde has been shown to extend circulation of irinotecan and prolong the duration of active therapy at the site 
of tumour cells to inhibit tumour growth. 
Irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate) is an antineoplastic agent of the topoisomerase I inhibitor class. 
Irinotecan is a semi-synthetic derivative of camptothecin, an alkaloid extract from plants such as Camptotheca 
acuminata. Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I, which relieves torsional strain 
in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the 
topoisomerase I - DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Irinotecan serves as a 
water-soluble precursor of the lipophilic metabolite SN-38, which is formed from irinotecan primarily by liver 
carboxylesterase enzymes. The SN-38 metabolite is approximately 1000 times more potent than irinotecan as 
an inhibitor of topoisomerase I purified from human and rodent tumour cell lines. The precise contribution of 
SN-38 to the activity of IRINOTECAN in humans has not been completely defined. Both irinotecan and SN-38 
exist in an active lactone form and an inactive hydroxy acid anion form. An acidic pH promotes the formation of 
the lactone whereas a basic pH favours the hydroxy acid anion form. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No primary or secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed. Topoisomerase I is the exclusive target 
for the API of MM-398, irinotecan. 
PKPD relationship 
The PK is considered descriptive in the current submission. However, the exposure-efficacy analysis indicates 
that increased exposure to irinotecan and SN-38 are associated with longer overall survival and progression-free 
survival. 
Higher irinotecan exposures were associated to a higher probability of incidence and severity of diarrhoea and 
higher SN-38 exposures with higher probability and severity of neutropenia, and with higher probability of 
anaemia. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Onivyde is a liposomal formulation of irinotecan with different pharmacokinetic properties compared to 
non-liposomal irinotecan. The dose concentration and strength are different in comparison to non-liposomal 
irinotecans. Onivyde is not equivalent to other non-liposomal irinotecan formulations and should not be 
interchanged.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 48/107 
  
  
Once released from the liposome-based particles, irinotecan is hypothesized to follow the same excretion route 
as the un-encapsulated irinotecan. The Applicant has therefore not further characterised the elimination of 
irinotecan, drug-drug interactions and PK of irinotecan in special populations. 
The PK following treatment with Onivyde has been studied in patients with solid tumours including patients with 
the proposed indication of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Analytes measured in clinical trials include total 
irinotecan (which includes encapsulated and un-encapsulated irinotecan), its active metabolite SN-38 and its 
inactive glucuronidated form SN-38G. In one study (PEP0201), encapsulated irinotecan and total irinotecan 
were directly measured. 
Irinotecan released from liposome encapsulation follows a similar metabolic pathway reported with 
non-liposomal irinotecan. Liposome encapsulation of irinotecan extends circulation and limits distribution 
relative to those of the non-liposomal irinotecan. The small volume of distribution suggests that Onivyde is 
largely confined to vascular fluid (see section 5.2 of the SmPC). 
The disposition of Onivyde and non-liposomal irinotecan has not been fully elucidated in humans. 
Linear PK of irinotecan is reported following iv infusion with un-encapsulated irinotecan solutions as well as 
following single doses with Onivyde (60-180 mg/m2). 
The systemic exposure of total irinotecan (Cmax and AUC) was much higher following an iv infusion of 120 mg/m2 
Onivyde compared to an infusion of 300 mg/m2 with the un-encapsulated irinotecan. A smaller Vss can be 
expected for a liposomal formulation. The Cmax of SN-38 was about 5-fold higher with the commercial 
formulation compared to with Onivyde although the dose was just 2.5-fold higher. The total exposure of SN-38 
after the commercial formulation was about half of exposure compared to after Onivyde. 
Preliminary data on local concentration of irinotecan and SN-38 in tumours, following a single dose of 80 mg/m2 
Onivyde have been presented. Data on systemic and local concentration in the tumour 72h post a single iv 
infusion of 80 mg/m2 Onivyde, show that the local concentration in the tumour of SN-38 is about 4-fold higher 
compared to the plasma level of SN-38 (the plasma level of total irinotecan is about double as high as the level 
in the tumour). However, the same comparison of tumour concentration and plasma levels following treatment 
with the un-encapsulated irinotecan is unknown. 
No correlation between the different genes of the UGT1A1 family studied and PK of irinotecan/SN-38 were 
reported however, the data set was relatively limited and it is uncertain whether the study was too small to 
detect a difference in SN-38 exposure. 
The PPK analysis appears to have been reasonably well performed. 
No in vivo data following repeated dosing have been provided. But considering the long t 1/2 for SN-38 and the 
high inter-individual variability, patients might still be exposed at the time for next dose. Simulation of expected 
steady state exposure using single dose data will not predict any potential time-dependency in the PK. Patients 
have been repeatedly dosed and efficacy/safety data are available. 
The systemic exposure of parent compound and/or metabolites are unknown in patients with different degrees 
of decreased renal function. 
No data on influence of renal impairment on the PK of irinotecan have been presented however data from popPK 
analysis in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment indicated that no dose adjustment is recommended 
in those patients. Onivyde is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 
ml/min) (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC).

Neither has any dedicated study on PK of Onivyde in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment been 
performed. Based on nonclinical data, an increased tissue distribution of 14C-irinotecan was seen in the rat, with 
higher levels in the liver, following administration with the liposomal compared to un-encapsulated solution for 
injection. The use of Onivyde should be avoided in patients with bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dl, or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or > 5 
times ULN if liver metastasis is present (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
The effect of hepatic impairment was explored. Higher baseline bilirubin was associated with higher SN-38 
concentration following the administration of Onivyde. Albumin has a weak association to the exposure of total 
irinotecan. The Applicant claims no significant associations were observed between total irinotecan or SN-38 and 
ALT, AST, and liver metastasis status. However, a significant association between total irinotecan (Composite 
Cavg P=0.0001) and CPT 11 (Cavg P=0.0002) were found. 
The association between UGT1A1*28 homozygosis to SN-38 exposure is evaluated stratified by race. While the 
effect of UGT1A1*28 homozygosis to SN-38 exposure was well-documented in Caucasians, the effect was less 
well-studied in Asians (Beutler1998), who have a relatively low incidence of UGT1A1*28 homozygosity. Data 
from Study MM-398-07-03-01 was consistent with the reduced incidence of UGT1A1*28 homozygosity in Asians 
compared to Caucasians: homozygosity was observed in 23/243 (9.5%) Caucasians, 2/129 (1.5%) Asians, and 
2/26 (7.6%) other races. Because race was a strong covariate for CPT11, the evaluation of the association 
between the maximum concentration of SN-38 converted and UGT1A1*28 homozygous was performed 
separately for each race group. Caucasians UGT1A1*28 homozygous have higher level of SN-38 converted 
compared to non-homozygous Caucasians. However, this difference is not statistically significant.  
Total and converted SN-38 Cavg is higher in Caucasian UGT1A1*28 homozygous due to reduced UGT1A1 
enzymatic activity.  
Co-administration of Onivyde with inducers of CYP3A4 may reduce systemic exposure of Onivyde. Onivyde 
should therefore not be administered with strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers such as anticonvulsants (phenytoin, 
phenobarbital or carbamazepine), rifampin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort unless there are no therapeutic 
alternatives. The appropriate starting dose for patients taking these anticonvulsants or other strong inducers 
has not been defined. Consideration should be given to substituting with non-enzyme inducing therapies at least 
2 weeks prior to initiation of Onivyde therapy (see sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Onivyde should not be administered with strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors (e.g. grapefruit juice, clarithromycin, 
indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole). Strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors should be discontinued at least one week prior to starting Onivyde therapy Onivyde should not 
be administered with strong UGT1A inhibitors (e.g. atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir) unless there are no 
therapeutic alternatives (see sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
No interaction of Onivyde with other medicinal products is known. 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients aged 28 to 87 years, of whom 11% were ≥75 years 
suggests that age had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure to irinotecan and SN 38 (see section 5.2 
of the SmPC). 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis in 196 male and 157 female patients suggests that gender had no 
clinically meaningful effect on the exposure to irinotecan and SN 38 after adjusting for body surface area (BSA).

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Irinotecan, the active substance of Onivyde, is a known active substance and overall the clinical pharmacology 
study package is considered sufficient. The PK of irinotecan/SN-38 following administration of Onivyde is 
considered descriptive. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
In support of the MAA, the applicant submitted one pivotal study (NAPOLI-1) and several supportive studies: 
- PEP0208: phase II study of MM-398 in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer previously treated with 
gemcitabine containing regimens (main supporting study) 
- PEP0201: phase I, DLT and MTD in solid tumours

Evaluating the Efficacy and Tolerability of PEP02 with or without Cisplatin in Patients with Recurrent or 
Metastatic Squamous Carcinoma of the Uterine Cervix). Phase II not performed, study terminated.  
- PEP0203: A multi-center,  open-label  phase  I  dose-escalation  study  of  PEP02  in  combination  with  5- 
fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in advanced solid tumours

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The single-agent MM-398 dose and schedule is based on results from a phase I dose escalating trial in advanced 
solid  tumour  patients  (PEP0201).  An  accelerated  titration  design  based  on  single-patient  cohorts  was  used, 
starting from an initial MM-398 dose of 60 mg/m2 (i.e 1/10 of the LD 10 in mice) and escalated to 120 mg/m2, 180 
mg/m2, 240 mg/m2, 300 mg/m2, and then subsequently escalated by 50 mg/m2 with every 3 weeks infusions, 
until  MTD  was  reached.  Because  the  dose-toxicity  correlation  of  irinotecan  has  been  well  established  and 
documented, one to two patients cohorts were employed at the lower dose levels (up to 240 mg/m2), followed 
by  the  three-patient  cohort  at  the  higher  dose  level  (≥300  mg/m2).  A  total  of  11  patients  were  enrolled, 
including 1 patient at dose level 0 (60 mg/m2), 6 patients at dose level 1 (120 mg/m2) and 4 patients at dose 
level 2 (180 mg/m2). At this latter dose level, two out four patients had DLTs (i.e, grade 4 leucopenia and 
neutropenia lasting for longer than 3 days; grade 3 febrile neutropenia and grade 3 diarrhoea). The dose was 
then reduced (120 mg/m2), and 1 patient among a total of 6 treated at this dose level experienced a DLT (Grade 
3 infection). Therefore, based on these results 120 mg/m2 was determined as MTD for MM-398 single agent (see 
further details in Section 2.1.3). Overall, 2 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer patients, both treated at 
180 mg/m2 dose level, were enrolled in study PEP0201, including 1 patient who achieved PR and 1 patient who 
reported PD.  
Assessment report

This single-agent MM-398 regimen (120 mg/m2  every 3 weeks) was then used in a phase II study, conducted 
in  pancreatic  cancer  patients  previously  treated  with  gemcitabine  (PEP0208),  and  based  on  its  efficacy  and 
safety results, the NAPOLI-1 study was originally designed and started enrolment. 
The  recommended  dose  of  MM-398  in  combination  with  5-FU/LV  when  administered  every  3  weeks  was 
investigated in a dose-escalation study conducted in advanced solid tumours (PEP0203), with a MM-398 starting 
dose of 60 mg/m2, subsequently escalated by increments of 20 mg/m2 between dose levels. The 5-FU/LV was 
given on days 1 and 8 of each cycle at a fixed dose of 2,000 mg/m2 and 200 mg/m2, respectively. Overall, 16 
patients were enrolled, including 3 patient at dose level 60 mg/m2, 6 patients at dose level 80 mg/m2, 5 patients 
at dose level 100 mg/m2 and 2 patients at dose level 120 mg/m2. Both patients treated with MM-398 120 mg/m2 
experienced DLTs (i.e, Grade III diarrhoea, Grade IV neutrophil count decreased, and Grade III infection in one 
patient and Grade III diarrhoea, Grade III leucopenia, and Grade III neutropenia in the other). Therefore, the 
dose level was decreased to 100 mg/m2 and additional patients were included. Overall, two patients treated with 
MM-398 100 mg/m2 experienced DLTs (i.e, fatigue, anaemia, white blood cell count decreased and neutrophil 
count  decreased,  all  Grade  III,  in  one  patient;  grade  III  anorexia,  diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  gastric  ileus, 
febrile neutropenia and infection, and grade IV leucopenia, and neutropenia in the other patient). No DLTs were 
reported  in  the  6  patients  treated  at  80  mg/m2  dose  level  that  was  considered  the  MTD  of  MM-398  in 
combination with 5-FU/LV given every 3 weeks. In total, 5 patients with advanced previously treated pancreatic 
cancer were enrolled in study PEP0203 across dose levels (1 at 60 mg/m2, 3 at 80 mg/m2, and 1 at 120 mg/m2). 
Stable disease was reported in all patients, with the exception of 1 patient in which a PD was recorded after 2 
cycles of MM-398 80 mg/m2 treatment (see further details in Section 2.1.3). This schedule was not incorporated 
in the NAPOLI-1 study. 
A combination arm of MM-398 + 5-FU/LV was only added when the NAPOLI-1 study had already started, based 
on the availability of acceptable safety data from an investigator initiated randomized phase II study, conducted 
by the GERCOR French cooperative group to compare MM-398 versus irinotecan in combination with 5-FU/LV as 
second line therapy in unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer patients (PEPCOL). In this study, the dose of 
MM-398 was 80 mg/m2 administered every 2 weeks in combination with with 5-FU/LV at 2400/400 mg/ m2.

Page 54/107 
  
  
Background 5FU/LV, dose and mode of administration  
- Arm C (MM-398+5-FU/LV): 5-FU 2,400 mg/m2 by IV infusion over 46 hours (± 60 minutes) every 2 weeks; LV 
400 mg/m2 of the l + d racemic form by IV infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks. 
Anti-emetic premedication as per standard institutional practices was administered in all arms. Prophylactic 
atropine could be prescribed to patients treated with Onivyde who experienced acute cholinergic symptoms in 
the previous cycles. 
In all arms, patients were to be treated until disease progression. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: To compare overall survival (OS) following treatment with MM-398, with or without 5-FU and 
leucovorin (5-FU/LV), versus 5-FU/LV, in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer that had progressed on 
gemcitabine based therapy. 
Secondary objective: To compare the following between the experimental and control arms: progression free 
survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), objective response rate (ORR), tumour marker response of 
CA19-9, clinical benefit response (CBR) rate, quality of life (QOL), safety and adverse event (AE) profiles, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: OS defined as the time from the date of patient randomization to date of death or the date last 
known alive. For each patient who was not known to have died as of the cut-off date for a particular analysis, OS 
was censored for that analysis at the date of last contact prior to the data cut-off date. 
Secondary endpoints: 
- PFS defined as the time in months from the date of patient randomization to the date of death or disease 
progression, whichever occurred earlier. 
- TTF defined by the occurrence of discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, 
treatment toxicity, and death. 
- ORR defined by the percentage of patients in the study population with a best overall response of Complete 
Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by the investigator. The best overall response was defined 
as the best response per RECIST (version 1.1) recorded from randomization until progression or end of study. 
- Tumour marker response of CA19-9 defined as a decrease of ≥50% of CA19-9 in relation to the baseline level 
at least once during the treatment period. Only patients with elevated baseline CA19-9 value (> 30 U/mL), i.e. 
the TMRE population, were included in the calculation of tumour marker response rate. 
- CBR is based on pain assessment and analgesic consumption. All patients were asked to complete a daily pain 
assessment and analgesic consumption diary throughout their participation in the study. 
Sample size 
For the sample size calculations, it was assumed that the median Overall Survival times were 4.5 months for the 
MM 398 monotherapy (Arm A), 3 months for the control arm (Arm B), and 6 months for the combination arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 55/107 
  
  
(Arm C), corresponding to hazard ratios (HR) of 0.67 and 0.5 in favor of Arm A and Arm C relative to Arm B, 
respectively. Both Arm A and Arm C were compared to Arm B.   
A total of 305 events provided at least 85% power to detect the hypothesized OS advantage for Arm A relative 
to Arm B. The planned study size also provided at least 99% power to detect the OS advantage for Arm C relative 
to Arm B. With a 14 month patient accrual and up to 3 months follow up time, it was expected that a total of 
approximately 405 patients would be randomized. 
The sample size and power calculations also assumed that approximately 65 patients were randomized in 
protocol version 1 and that the remaining patients were randomized under the 3-arm versions of the protocol.  
These power statements were based on the corresponding two pairwise unstratified logrank tests using a 
Bonferroni-Holm testing procedure which strongly controls the family wise error rate for the planned 
comparisons at the two-sided 0.05 level, i.e. one sided 0.025 level. 
The primary analysis was to take place when at least 305 death events have occurred. The final number of 
patients enrolled and included in the analyses included all patients randomized under protocol version 1.1 (and 
later). 
Randomisation 
Patients have been randomized to treatment arms using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) at a 
central location, based on stratified factors such as baseline albumin levels (≥ 4.0 g/dL vs < 4.0 g/dL), KPS (70 
and 80 vs ≥ 90), and ethnicity (Caucasian vs East Asian vs All Others). 
In the original protocol, randomization in a 1:1 ratio to MM-398 monotherapy vs 5-FU/LV control arm was 
performed. Starting from protocol version 2, a third arm was added to investigate MM-398 in combination with 
5-FU/LV, and patients were assigned to treatment arms via randomized blocks within a stratum (1:1:1 ratio).

Primary Endpoint Analysis:  
The primary analysis involved 2 pairwise comparisons of survival in the ITT population using un-stratified 
logrank test. The testing was carried out using a Bonferroni-Holm testing procedure to strongly control the 
family wise Type I error rate at the 2-sided 0.05 level.  Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed on each 
treatment group to obtain nonparametric estimates of the survival function and the median survival time. 
Corresponding 95% confidence intervals were computed using the log-log method. Unstratified Cox proportional 
hazards regression were used to estimate hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The 
proportional hazards assumptions were examined by Cox regression models with treatment as a 
time-dependent covariate.  
Secondary Endpoint Analysis:  
PFS was compared pairwise (Arm A v. Arm B, Arm C v. Arm B) using un-stratified logrank tests. Kaplan-Meier 
analyses were performed on each treatment group to obtain nonparametric estimates of the PFS function and 
the median PFS time. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals were computed using the log-log method. 
Unstratified Cox proportional hazards regressions were used to estimate hazard ratios and their corresponding 
95% confidence interval.  
The number and percentage of patients in the ITT, PP, and EP populations experiencing objective response 
(confirmed CR + PR) at the time of analysis was presented and the 95% confidence interval for the proportion 
was calculated based on the normal approximation. Differences in objective response rates between treatment 
arms were compared pairwise using Fisher’s exact tests. Analyses of ORR were based on unconfirmed tumour 
response assessments per investigator under RECIST version 1.1 criteria, as well as confirmed tumour 
responses.    
Clinical benefit response rates were compared pairwise on the CBRE population using Fisher’s Exact Tests. 
Contingency tables for pain classification, KPS, and overall clinical benefit response, were also presented for 
each treatment group. Median time to clinical benefit response and median duration of clinical benefit response 
were computed using data from patients with clinical benefit response.   
Regarding the Tumour Marker Response Analysis, CA 19-9 serum levels were measured within 7 days before the 
start of treatment (baseline), and subsequently every 6 weeks. Tumour marker response was evaluated by the 
change in CA19-9 serum levels and defined as a decrease of 50% of CA19-9 in relation to the baseline level at 
least once during the treatment period. Only patients with elevated baseline CA19-9 value (> 30 U/mL), i.e. the

TMRE population, were included in the calculation of tumour marker response rate. Tumour marker response 
rates from the treatment arms were compared pairwise using Fisher’s exact tests.

Of the 577 patients screened for inclusion, 417 patients were randomized and are included in the Intent-to-Treat 
(ITT) population. These patients were enrolled in 76 study sites in North America (20 sites), Europe (30 sites),

Asia (12 sites), South America (8 sites), and Oceania (6 sites). Out of the 417 patients included, 151 (36%) 
were enrolled in Europe, 125 patients (30%) in Asia, and 68 (16%) in North America, while the remaining part 
(18%) was from Australia and South America. 
Conduct of the study 
Overall, 2 protocol amendments were implemented to the original version of NAPOLI-1 study (dated 6 Oct 
2011).  
The main changes introduced by protocol amendments are reported in the following Table:

Changes 
The study design was changed by the addition of the third treatment arm 
(MM-398 and 5-FU/LV combination). 
Based on statistical assumption for the 3-arm study, the total number of 
patients required to be enrolled was increased from 270 to 405; moreover, 
the primary analysis for overall survival was to take place after 305 death 
events instead of 220 initially planned. 
Requirement for a formal interim analysis, for safety and futility, was 
removed. Instead, a requirement for an intensive safety review of the first 15 
subjects enrolled in each arm by the independent DSMB was added to ensure 
the safety of the new combination arm. 
The restriction excluding patients previously treated with irinotecan from 
participating in the study was removed to be consistent with the absence of 
restriction in case of previous treatment with 5-FU/LV. Inclusion of such 
patients was left to the investigator’s discretion. 
Dose modification guideline for patients who were homozygous for 
UGT1A1*28 and had already had their dose increased was clarified. 
To keep the response assessment consistent with the RECIST 1.1. guidelines, 
confirmation of a PR or CR was no longer required. 
In case of study treatment discontinuation for reasons other than disease 
progression, tumour assessment every 6 weeks was continued during the 
follow-up period until documentation of objective disease progression. Since 
post-study therapy can affect the tumour response status, censoring for 
tumour response analysis was applied at the time of new anti-neoplastic 
therapy starts, and, not further tumour assessments was required from then 
onwards. 
In addition to Arm A, PK assessments were now required for patients on Arm 
B and C as well. The requirement of an optional PK sample was added to be 
collected in Cycle 1, any time between 8 and 72 hours following administration 
of MM-398, from patients in Arm A and C patients only.  
The dose for the l isomeric form of leucovorin was added, due to the ongoing 
global shortages for oncology drugs. 
Clarification that all efficacy comparisons between Arm A and Arm B would 
include all patients randomized to either arm, under all versions of the 
protocol. The efficacy comparisons between Arm B and Arm C would include 
only patients randomized under protocol version 2 or later. 
An additional sensitivity analysis was added to censor the overall survival at a 
date where any post-treatment anti-cancer therapy was first administered.

- Quality of life (QoL): 
The status of QoL (improved, stable, or worsened) is registered through the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. 
Baseline median Global Health Status, Functional Scale and Symptoms Scale scores were similar among 
treatment arms. For Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, and Cognitive Functioning median scores at 
baseline were ≥75, indicating a high/healthy level of functioning. At Week 6 and Week 12 no appreciable 
changes from baseline were registered for both domains.  
Regarding symptom scales, median baseline scores were in the range 0-33, indicating low levels of 
symptomatology. No appreciable change from baseline in median scores were reported at Week 6 and Week 12 
for pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, and constipation. A post-baseline increase in median symptom 
scores from 0 (i.e., no symptomatology) to 16.7-33.3 was registered for nausea/vomiting and diarrhoea.

Supportive studies 
-  PEP0208: a phase II study of  liposomal irinotecan (formerly PEP02) in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
cancer previously treated with gemcitabine containing regimens.  
The results of PEP0208 led to the development of the phase 3 NAPOLI-1 study, which is the basis for this 
marketing authorization application. Forty (40) patients were enrolled to receive single-agent MM-398 120 
mg/m2 q3w until disease progression. Median OS was 5.2 months. Tumour response rate in the PP population 
was 7.5% and involved 3 patients with PR.   
-  PEP02 (human plasma protein binding to liposomal irinotecan) 
-  PEP0201 (phase I, DLT and MTD in solid tumours).  
The MTD was determined as a dose of 120mg/m2 while in PEP02 MM-398 was given as a 90-minute infusion on 
a q3w schedule, and chosen as recommended dose of MM398 single agent in future studies.  
-  PEP0202: a Phase I Dose Escalation Study Followed by Multi-National, Open-Label Randomized Phase II 
Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Tolerability of PEP02 with or without Cisplatin in Patients with Recurrent 
or Metastatic Squamous Carcinoma of the Uterine Cervix).  
When the dose was escalated to the second level (MM-398 80 mg/m2 + cisplatin 60 mg/m2), two of the patients 
in this cohort developed SAEs which led to death. The study was terminated before the MTD of MM-398 in 
combination with cisplatin 60 mg/m2 given every 3 weeks could be determined.  
-  PEP0203: a multi-center, open-label phase I dose-escalation study of PEP02 in combination with 5- 
fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in advanced solid tumours.  
MTD of MM-398 was determined to be 80 mg/m2. All treatment-related AEs and grade III or above at the MTD 
dose level were 51.1% and 10.6%, respectively.  
Among the 15 efficacy evaluable patients with advanced solid tumour refractory to standard systemic 
treatment, the best tumour response were confirmed as PR in 2,  SD in 9 and PD in 5. The overall tumour 
response rate and disease control rate were 13.3% and 73.3%, respectively. The dose of 80 mg/m2 of PEP02 in 
combination with D1 and D8 infusion of 5-FU/LV in q3w schedule was recommended for the future phase II 
studies. 
-  PIST-CRC: a phase I and Pharmacokinetic Study of Biweekly MM-398 in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal 
Cancer Refractory to First-line Oxaliplatin-based Chemotherapy) 
Of the 18 treated patients, the overall response rate achieved 22.2%. There were 4 patients with partial 
response (PR) (2 in 80mg/ m2, 1 in 90 mg/ m2, 1 in 100 mg/ m2), 9 patients with stable disease (SD), and 5 with 
progressive disease (PD). The disease control rate was 72.2%.

-  PEP0206 : a randomized phase II Study of MM-398, Irinotecan or Docetaxel as a Second Line Therapy in 
Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma 
The number of patients with confirmed partial or complete response (PR or CR) was 6 in the MM-398 arm 
(objective tumour response rate of 13.6%), 3 in the irinotecan arm (6.8%), and 7 in the docetaxel arm (15.9%). 
No differences were seen in the mPFS: MM-398, 81 days, irinotecan 79.5 days, docetaxel 82 days. The 3 
treatments showed similar efficacy in terms of the survival parameters. 
-  PEPCOL: a randomized phase II study of MM-398 or irinotecan in combination with leucovorin and 
5-fluorouracil as second-line therapy in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer 
Fifty-five patients with unresectable mCRC who had failed one prior oxaliplatin-based first-line therapy were 
randomly assigned to FUPEP (MM-398 80 mg/m² d1, folinic acid (FA) 400 mg/m² d1, 5-FU 2,400 mg/m² d1-2) 
or FOLFIRI (FOLFIRI1: irinotecan 180 mg/m² d1, FA 400 mg/m² d1, 5-FU bolus 400 mg/m² d1, 5-FU infusion 
2,400 mg/m² d1-2; or modified FOLFIRI3: irinotecan 90 mg/m² d1 and 3, FA 400 mg/m² d1, 5-FU infusion 
2,400 mg/m² d1-2). Bevacizumab q2w (5 mg/kg) was allowed in both arms as of June 2012 (TML study report). 
The primary endpoint was the objective tumour response (OR). OR rate were 16.7% (n=4/24) and 11.5% 
(n=3/26) in the FUPEP and the FOLFIRI arms, respectively. Most common grade 3-4 adverse events reported in 
the respective FUPEP and the FOLFIRI arms were diarrhoea (21% vs 33%), neutropenia (11% vs 30%), 
mucositis (11% vs 11%), and alopecia (G2: 25% vs 26%).   
Translational research 
Translational samples have been collected from a subset of consenting patients: archival tumour material has 
been collected from 26% of the patients, while plasma and whole blood PAXgene material has been collected 
from 47% of the patients. Discussions with vendors to evaluate best approaches, prioritization of sample use 
and methodologies as well as method development are ongoing. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAA is based on one pivotal trial, NAPOLI-1, and several supportive studies.  
The dose-escalation trial PEP0203 established the irinotecan dose of 80 mg/m2, in combination with day 1 and 
day 8 5FU (2000 mg/m2) / LV (200 mg/m2) infusion q3w as the recommended schedule for further studies.  
The PEPCOL trial (a randomized phase II study of MM-398 or irinotecan in combination with leucovorin and 
5-fluorouracil as second-line therapy in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer) was the basis 
for the introduction of the combination arm (MM-398+5FU/LV) in the pivotal NAPOLI-1 trial; in PEPCOL, a 
combination of MM-398 (given q2w at a dose of 80 mg/m2 to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
previously treated with oxaliplatin) with 5-FU (2400 mg/m2 day1-2) / LV (400 mg/m2 day 1) was administered 
with encouraging tumour response and less AEs (namely diarrhoea and neutropenia) than in the FOLFIRI arm. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study was subject to CHMP advice when a third arm (MM-398 + 5FU/LV) was proposed to be added to the 
ongoing MM-398 vs. 5FU/LV study. In the advice it was recommended that the design should be simplified, 
comparing MM-398 vs. standard irinotecan both on top of 5FU/LV, meaning that a completely new study was 
recommended. For obvious reasons this design would have provided a more straight forward possibility to 
assess the benefit of MM-398 compared with standard irinotecan.

Irinotecan in regimens such as FOLFIRI, however, has not been demonstrated to be beneficial in pancreatic 
cancer after failure on gemcitabine. Whilst not considered to be the most informative, the design, including 
5FU/LV alone as reference therapy, is accepted from a regulatory perspective.  
The 5FU/LV regimens in the control arm B versus the experimental arm C are dissimilar enough to warrant 
further discussion: 
In the experimental arm (MM-398+5-FU/LV, arm C), the nominal dose of 5-FU was 2,400 mg/m2 IV over 46 
hours every 2 weeks, per 6 weeks 7,200 mg/m2. Over a mean of 15 weeks of exposure, this led to a 6-week 
average dose intensity of 5065 mg/m2 and relative dose intensity for 5FU of 83.9%. 
In the control arm (5-FU/LV, arm B), the nominal dose of 5-FU was 2,000 mg/m2 IV over 24 hours, administered 
weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks’ rest, per 6 weeks 8,000 mg/m2. Over a mean of 10 weeks of 
exposure; the 6-week average dose intensity was 6,710 mg/m2. The relative dose intensity for 5FU is 95.7%. 
The nominal 6-week dose of 5FU was thus slightly higher in the control arm (8,000 vs. 7,200), but the infusion 
time was shorter (24 vs. 46 h). To this may be added that LV dose also differed: 200 mg/m2 (arm B) vs 400 
mg/m2 (arm C). Qualitatively, longer infusion time and higher LV dose would favour the experimental arm, 
whilst the higher dose would favour the control group. Quantitatively, however, the differences are considered 
minor and highly unlikely per se to result in a difference in PFS/OS between arms B and C.  
The 6-week average dose intensity over the mean period of exposure is a function of variability in exposure 
time/completion of cycles and dose reductions; the main factor in both study arms being variable exposure time, 
most notable for the control arm, where the relative dose intensity was very high (96%). The high relative dose 
intensity in the control arm, however, shows that there was room for a more intensive 5FU/LV regimen.  
The number of different 5FU/LV regimens still in clinical use is large, meaning that there is no “gold standard”; 
here illustrated by two second-line studies conducted in patients with pancreatic cancer who have received 
gemcitabine first-line. In the phase III PANCREOX trial mFOLFOX6 was compared with 5FU/LV. The selected 
control regimen was LV 400 mg/m2 and 5FU 2400mg/m2 over 46 hours q2w, i.e. the same as the background 
5FU/LV regimen in arm C. This was a negative trial (OS HR 1.8, p=0.02).  
In the phase III CONKO-003 trial, a combination of oxaliplatin with 5-FU/LV (OFF regimen) was compared with 
5FU/LV. The control regimen was LV 200 mg/m2 followed by a continuous IV infusion of fluorouracil 2,000 
mg/m2 over 24 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. After a 3-week rest period from day 23 to 42, the second course 
was initiated on day 43 (i.e. day 1 of the second cycle). The 5FU/LV regimen was the same for the experimental 
and the control arm; the difference with the control arm in NAPOLI-1 lies in the more spaced administration of 
5FU/LV in CONKO, i.e. a less intensive regimen. A survival benefit related to oxaliplatin add-on was shown, HR 
0.68 p=0.01. Efficacy wise the two regimes, OFF and MM398+5FU/LV, are indeed similar. However, oxaliplatin 
causes long lasting neurotoxicity.

Although it would have facilitated the assessment of the add-on benefit of MM-398 if the same 5FU/LV regimen 
had been used as background and control, the control regimen in NAPOLI-1 cannot be viewed as too 
non-intensive.  
In the monotherapy arm, MM-398 was administered at 120 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and in the combination arm 
80 mg/m2 every 2 weeks, i.e. the same dose intensity over a 6-week period. It cannot be excluded that this 
difference influences the anti-tumour activity. Therefore the add-on benefit of 5FU/LV to MM-398 cannot be 
disentangled, but it is considered acceptable from a regulatory perspective.  
The study population was heterogeneous, mainly in terms of prior lines of therapy and therefore also in terms of 
exposure to different cytotoxic agents. Apart from prior exposure to irinotecan (46 patients, 10%), this 
apparently did not influence to a major degree the relative activity of the combination regimen.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy analysis of OS was performed when 305 deaths had occurred (data cut-off 14 February 
2014).  
The primary endpoint assessment showed a median OS gain of 1.9 months in favour of the experimental arm 
(6.1 vs 4.2 months, HR 0.67, p=0.0122). A median OS benefit of two months (i.e. an about 50% increase from 
4 to 6 months) in this clinical setting is relevant from a regulatory perspective. However, the p-value is 
borderline significant, bearing in mind that the alpha was split at a significance level of 0.025.  
The primary analysis was non-stratified although it is normally expected that the primary analysis is stratified 
according to the factors used for stratification (EMA/CHMP/295050/2013). KPS was the only notable imbalance 
in stratification factors and seemingly favoured the experimental arm. It should be noticed, however, that the 
HR in patients with KPS <90 is 0.54 vs. 0.79 in those with KPS ≥90.  
As a sensitivity analysis, a stratified analysis is reported and shows a lower hazard ratio and a lower p-value: HR 
0.57 vs 0.67, p-value 0.0009 vs 0.012. These results, in the CHMP preferred analysis, make the “borderline 
concern” less of an issue.  
Fourteen (14) patients in the control group did not receive any study drug but were analysed as if they had 
received 5 FU/LV causing a possible OS bias. A more conservative analysis with the imputation of OS times for 
patients who did not have observed OS time due to early discontinuation from OS follow-up was provided. The 
outcome of the imputed dataset simulations both stratified and non-stratified, yielded similar values, therefore 
supporting the robustness of the primary OS analysis.  
Among the pre-planned OS subgroup analyses, a treatment effect favouring the 5-FU/LV over the combination 
arm has been observed for ethnicity other than caucasian and east asian, prior Whipple and prior irinotecan. This 
observation is also confirmed by univariate and multivariate analyses conducted to identify possible prognostic 
factors for both OS and PFS, which consistently showed prior irinotecan together with age>65 to negatively 
impact on the prognosis of patients treated with the combination arm.  
Despites the limitations of subgroup analyses,  the  observation  in  patients pre-treated  with  irinotecan  raises 
concerns due to the increasing use of irinotecan-containing regimen as first line therapy. Based on the limited 
data provided in patients with prior exposure to irinotecan, moreover showing no advantage (if not a detrimental 
effect) over 5FU/LV, the benefit of Onivyde in patients previously treated with an irinotecan-based regimen has 
not been demonstrated (see sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016

The PFS was assessed by the investigator, not by IRC. The combination of MM-398+5-FU/LV achieved a median 
PFS of twice that of the control arm of 5-FU/LV (3.1 vs 1.5 months, HR 0.56, p=0.0001).  
The combination of MM-398+5-FU/LV achieved a median TTF of 2.3 months compared to 1.4 months for the 
control arm of 5-FU/LV, HR 0.60, p=0.0002. TTF results are thus consistent with PFS outcomes. 
The confirmed ORR for MM-398+5-FU/LV was 7.7% (95% CI: 2.86, 12.52) compared to 0.8% for 5-FU/LV. The 
confirmed ORR for MM-398 monotherapy was 3.3%, vs 0.7% for 5-FU/LV. As expected, the unconfirmed ORRs 
were higher than the confirmed ORRs: 16.2% for MM-398+5-FU/LV vs 0.8% of 5-FU/LV control arm; 6.0% for 
MM-398 vs 0.7% for 5-FU/LV.  
When comparing Onivyde monotherapy to 5FU/LV, the OS results are very similar with a HR 0.99. A trend 
towards better PFS results was observed, however the HR was 0.8, p=0.1. The unconfirmed ORR (RECIST 1.1) 
was 6% vs. 0.7% in the 5FU/LV arm. This trend towards higher activity of MM-398 is of some importance as it 
underlines that the survival benefit seen in the combination arm cannot be explained by the differences in the 
5FU/LV regimens and is caused by the add-on effect of MM-398.  
The decreases in the CA19-9 levels are consistent with the findings of other efficacy endpoints. 
The main objective of CBR assessment was to show an improvement in pain intensity in the combination arm 
which was not observed. 
Due to a very high attrition rate (only 60% had at least one post-baseline assessment), a conclusion on the 
effect of the addition of MM-398 to 5-FU/LV on the quality of life cannot be drawn. 
In the combination arm, the OS outcome is clearly worse in patients above 65 years of age, but put in relation 
to the control arm, there is still a likely benefit in this group of patients (OS HR 0.7). 
Discussions with participating investigators, key opinion leaders and internal experts are ongoing to determine 
priorities for the optimal studies on the translational samples collected in the context of the available results of 
the main study, NAPOLI-1, and emerging research in pancreatic cancer. Clinically relevant results will be 
communicated appropriately when they become available. Complete results will be provided as soon as possible, 
but are likely to be available in 2017, at the earliest. The Applicant is recommended to submit the results of the 
translational research as soon as available. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy results observed with Onivyde in terms of OS benefit and supportive evidence are considered 
clinically meaningful and statistically sufficiently robust to support approval in metastatic pancreatic cancer.  
The place of Onivyde in the algorithm of treatment in metastatic pancreatic cancer should be carefully 
considered given the increased use of FOLFIRINOX as first line therapy and the limited number of patients in the 
pivotal NAPOLI-1 study previously treated with both gemcitabine and irinotecan. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
The Applicant is recommended to conduct and submit the results of a translational research program in 
pancreatic cancer based on samples collected from completed and ongoing studies.

Patient exposure 
To assess the safety of Onivyde 80 mg/m2 plus 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 and leucovorin (LV) 400 mg/m2 administered 
every 2 weeks (q2w) in the proposed indication for pancreatic cancer, the most relevant data source is the 
safety analysis of the Phase 3, randomized controlled NAPOLI-1 study, focusing on the MM-398+5- FU/LV 
combination arm. The monotherapy Onivyde (120mg/m2) was also analysed in detail in order to identify 
undesirable effects associated with Onivyde that may not been uncovered from the Onivyde +5-FU/LV 
combination arm. 
Other than NAPOLI-1, only two studies contain Onivyde safety data in combination with 5-FU and LV, albeit in 
different patient populations: 
1. PEPCOL, an investigator sponsored study in colorectal cancer 
2. PEP0203 Phase 1 study in solid tumours 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 80/107 
  
  
PEPCOL employed the same dose and schedule as studied in NAPOLI-1, whereas the PEP0203 study employed 
an every-3-week (Q3W) MM-398 dosing schedule. MM-398 doses were escalated: 60, 80, 100 and 120 mg/m2. 
The dose and schedule for PEP0203 5-FU/LV administration was 5-FU 2000 mg/m2 mixed with leucovorin 200 
mg/m2 as a 24-hour continuous infusion on Days 1 and 8, every 21 days (3 weeks). 
All other studies with Onivyde (including an experimental arm of Onivyde 120 mg/m2 IV Q3W in the NAPOLI-1 
study) were conducted as a monotherapy or in combination with agents other than 5-FU and leucovorin 
(PEP0201, PIST-CRC, PEP0206, PEP0208, CITS) or in combination with cisplatin (PEP0202). For these reasons, 
no formal pooling of the safety data from the NAPOLI-1 study with other studies was conducted.  
Overall, 440 patients have received Onivyde in the completed and ongoing studies as of 14 February 2014. The 
440 patients treated with Onivyde in these clinical trials had a variety of advanced solid tumours with high unmet 
medical need. The largest patient exposure to Onivyde has been in patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic 
cancer (a total of 304 patients), primarily in the Phase 3 study, NAPOLI-1 (264 patients).

For most SOCs, the AEs that occurred/worsened from the first day of drug administration till up to 30 days to the 
last dose were more frequent in the MM-398 monotherapy arm, followed closely by the combination arm.  
The most striking difference between the experimental arms in the opposite sense is ‘blood’: 46.9% AEs in the 
monotherapy arm, compared to 57.3% in the combination arm.

The TEAE causality is in line with the known safety profile of standard irinotecan, i.e. gastrointestinal AEs and 
hematotoxicity.  
AEs’ incidence and severity was proportional with dose intensity in the MM-398 containing arms, with the 
exception of the PTs ‘neutropenia’, ‘WBC decreased’, ‘neutrophil count decreased’. ‘Fatigue’ and ‘asthenia’ were 
also more frequently observed in the combination arm. With regards to common TEAEs ≥ gr 3 (see also AESI), 
diarrhoea and vomiting were the leading AEs in MM-398 containing arms, and the incidence was proportional 
with the exposure to drug. 
Adverse drug reactions  
In order to determine the adverse drug reactions of MM-398 and to derive the frequencies of these adverse drug 
reactions for labelling, the following analyses of NAPOLI-1 study were performed. 
Any grade treatment emergent adverse events that occurred 3% higher frequency and/or Grade 3 or higher 
TEAES that occurred 2% higher frequency in either the MM-398 monotherapy or MM-398+5-FU/LV combination 
arms compared to the 5-FU-LV control arms were tabulated using MedDRA Preferred Terms. 
A similar analysis was performed using clustering of certain single MedDRA PT into medically relevant groups  in 
order to avoid underreporting of adverse reactions frequencies due to the similarities between some single 
MedDRA Preferred Terms. In addition to the cumulative frequencies of treatment emergent adverse events, an 
exposure adjusted adverse event rate was also calculated per person-years as n/T, where n=number of subjects 
with specified event and T=total person-years. Person-years were calculated as the time from the first dose date 
to: 
- the onset date of first event for subjects with event (patients with the event) 
- the minimum of (date of last dose + 30 days, date of death, February 14, 2014) (patients without the event) 
The following table of ADRs has been established on the basis of the criteria described above.

SAEs 
The incidence of SAEs in MM-398 containing arms was generally proportional with the exposure to liposomal 
irinotecan, with exception of ‘infections and infestations’. 
AESI: the AESIs were defined based on the known safety profile of Onivyde and on Camptosar label.  
Longitudinal data for AESI were requested and provided by the Applicant, as well as the prevalence/incidence of 
AESI overall and by grade ≥3, however not per treatment cycle. Information on any repeated gr3 or 4 AESI were 
provided. 
Most AESIs are early or very early events, according to the data; they wane / disappear after an average of six 
administrations. In the context of NAPOLI-1, six doses make up for 3 months (MM-398 administered q2w) of 
combination therapy and 4.5 moths for MM-398 monotherapy.  
A brief look at the line listings reveals that the patients still in treatment after 6 doses are about a third from the 
total. So it is these patients who begin to benefit from a milder AESI profile of the treatment.

Diarrhoea 
Severe diarrhoea occurred in 13% of patients in the combination arm. Diarrhoea starts early, after the first 
dose, but new onset diarrhoea is observed up to 4 doses. Early diarrhoea (onset day1, consistent with 
cholinergic hyperstimulation) occurred twice as frequently in the combination arm (29.9%) than in the other two 
arms. Late events (after day1) were more frequent in the monotherapy arm (66.7%) and in the combination 
arm (42.7%) than in the control arm. One third of the patients in the combination arm experience diarrhoea 
(mostly gr1-2) throughout the treatment, the prevalence of diarrhoea remains constant over time in MM-398 
containing arms, however treatment discontinuation due to diarrhoea was very low. Diarrhoea is more frequent 
and more severe in Caucasians. However, diarrhoea was manageable with atropine/loperamide and supportive 
therapy. 
Leukopenia/neutropenia 
Neutropenia had the highest frequency reported after the initial two doses in the MM-398+5-FU/LV arm (any 
grade 13.7% and 16.3% respectively; ≥grade 3 neutropenia was 9.4% after the first and second dose). 
Neutropenia was generally present throughout MM-398 treatment with the highest any grade and ≥grade 3 
prevalence after the second dose in the MM-398+5-FU/LV combination arm. In the MM-398+5-FU/LV arm the 
prevalence of any grade neutropenia ranged between 0-26.2 % while the prevalence of ≥grade 3 neutropenia 
was between 0-11.4%. 
Neutropenic fever/sepsis: The incidence and prevalence frequencies by dose are similar for these acute events 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 87/107 
  
  
which tended to occur early in the treatment. In the MM-398+5-FU/LV arm, 2 patients (1.9%) had an event 
after the second dose, 1 patient (1.3%) after the 3rd dose and 1 patient after the 9th dose. In the MM-398 
monotherapy arm, 5 patients (3.4%) experienced and event after the first dose, 1 (0.8%) after the second dose 
and 1 patients (1.5%) after the 3rd dose. Almost all events of neutropenic fever/sepsis were grade 3 or higher 
severity. 
Severe infections:  
The incidence and prevalence of these acute events are similar regardless of the dose. All events were noted 
within the initial 5 doses of Onivyde administered in either Onivyde arms with one exception (1 patient was 
reported to have experienced septic shock after the 12th dose of Onivyde+5-FU/LV administration). The 
majority of the sepsis/bacteraemia events had a severity of grade 3 or higher. 
Overall, severe neutropenia occurred in 20% of patients in the combination arm; severe neutropenic 
fever/sepsis in 3%; and fatal neutropenic sepsis in 0.8%. The cases of simultaneous occurrence of diarrhoea 
and neutropenia are especially complicated. 
Patients with baseline serum bilirubin levels ≥1.0 mg/dL, or with deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin e.g. 
Gilbert’s syndrome, may be at greater risk for leukopenia/neutropenia. 
Patients with obstructing pancreatic head lesions and indwelling biliary stents experienced infectious 
complications such as ascending cholangitis and biliary sepsis that could be potentially life threatening in the 
setting of profound myelosuppression. 
There is an increased risk of infections and haematological toxicity in patients with severe diarrhoea; the 
clinician should be aware of the risk and complete blood cell counts should be performed in these patients. 
Acute infusion reactions:  
Acute infusion reactions (consisting of rash, urticaria, periorbital oedema or pruritus) were reported 
in 8 of 117 patients (6.8%) in the Onivyde+5-FU/LV arm, 3 of 147 patients (2.0%) in the Onivyde 
monotherapy arm, and 8 of 134 patients (6.0%) in the 5-FU/LV arm. New events (all grade 1 or grade 2) 
occurred generally early during Onivyde treatment, with only 2 out of 10 patients noted with events after the 
fifth dose. 
Thromboembolic events 
In NAPOLI-1, thromboembolic events were reported in up to 6% of the patients in the combination arm and up 
to 14.3% of patients treated Onivyde monotherapy. In clinical studies with Onivyde, deep vein thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, and embolism were considered common AEs.

In NAPOLI-1, most “treatment-related deaths” were observed in the Onivyde monotherapy arm, 4/147 (GI 
toxicity, DIC, septic shock and infectious colitis); in the combination arm, there was one drug-related 
death/117, namely septic shock. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In NAPOLI-1, any grade decreased haemoglobin and decreased platelets were observed across arms, 
predominantly in the monotherapy and the combination arm; one case of gr4 thrombocytopenia was observed 
in the MM-398 arm. Any grade neutropenia was more frequent in the combination arm (51.8%), followed by 
monotherapy (35.6%), with control at 6%. Gr3 neutropenia had the same disposition: 15.8 vs 8.9 vs 2.3%. Gr4 
neutropenia was at 7.5% in the MM-398 group, 4.4% in the combination arm, with no cases registered in the 
control arm.  
Chemistry 
In NAPOLI-1, changes in liver function tests and electrolytes were observed across arms: increased alkaline 
phosphatase, ALT, AST and decreased albumin; decreased K, Mg and Na. Gr3 (11 patients) and 4 (1 patient) 
hypopotassaemia were observed in MM-398 monotherapy arm; in the combination arm there was one gr 4 
hypoK. As for hypoNa, in the monotherapy arm 14 patients experienced gr3 events and one a gr4 event.  
The supportive studies seem to exhibit a similar pattern of laboratory findings.

Overall, no major clinical differences in safety or efficacy were reported between patients ≥65 years and 
patients <65 years, although a higher frequency of discontinuation (14.8% vs. 7.9%) was noted in the former 
group treated with Onivyde+5-FU/LV in the NAPOLI-1 study and in some cases the adverse reactions did not 
resolve. Grade 3 or higher and serious treatment emergent adverse reactions were more frequent in patients 
< 65 years (84.1% and 50.8%) compared to patients ≥ 65 years (68.5 % and 44.4%). Conversely, patients 
> 75 years (n=12) experienced more frequent serious adverse reactions, dose delay, dose reduction and 
discontinuation compared to patients ≤ 75 years (n=105) when treated with Onivyde+5-FU/LV in the 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma study (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

Hepatic Impairment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 90/107 
  
  
 
 
 
No dedicated hepatic impairment study has been conducted with Onivyde. In clinical studies of non-liposomal 
irinotecan administered on a weekly dosage schedule, patients with modestly elevated baseline serum total 
bilirubin levels (1.0 to 2.0 mg/dl) had a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first cycle Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 mg/dl. No data are available for 
patients with total bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dl. 
Renal Impairment 
There are no safety data in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.  
Body Weight/BMI 
Onivyde is dosed based on body surface area that is calculated using body weight. No further dose adjustment 
is recommended based on body weight or BMI. In NAPOLI-1 study, 5 of 8 underweight patients experienced a 
grade 3 or 4 adverse reaction, mostly myelosuppression, while 7 of the 8 patients required dose modification 
such as dose delay, dose reduction or dose discontinuation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Race 
Compared to Caucasians, Asian patients were observed with a lower incidence of diarrhoea [14 (19.2%) out 
of 73 Caucasians had a ≥ Grade 3 diarrhoea, and 1 out of 33 (3.3%) Asians had a ≥ Grade 3 diarrhoea], but a 
higher incidence and higher severity of neutropenia. In patients receiving Onivyde+5-FU/LV, the incidence of 
≥ Grade 3 neutropenia was higher among Asian patients [18 of 33 (55%)] compared to White patients 
[13 of 73 (18%)]. Neutropenic fever/neutropenic sepsis was reported in 6% of Asian patients compared to 1% 
of White patients (see section 4.8 of the SmPC).

Additional notable clinically relevant differences in the frequency of other AEs include a higher rate of nausea, 
vomiting, decreased appetite and alopecia were reported for Asians compared to Caucasians in Onivyde 
containing arms. Fatigue was reported with higher frequency in the Caucasians compared to Asians.  
Patients with prior Whipple procedure 
In the clinical study evaluating Onivyde+5 FU/LV, patients with a prior Whipple procedure had a higher risk of 
serious infections following treatment with Onivyde+5 FU/LV [9 of 29 (30%) compared] to 11 of 88 (12.5%) 
patients with no prior Whipple procedure (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Patients with UGT1A1 allele 
Individuals who are 7/7 homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia from 
non-liposomal irinotecan. In the clinical study evaluating Onivyde+5-FU/LV, the frequency of ≥ Grade 3 
neutropenia in these patients [2 of 7 (28.6%)] was similar to the frequency in patients not homozygous for the 
UGT1A1*28 allele who received a starting dose of Onivyde of 80 mg/m2 [30 of 110 (27.3%)] (see sections 4.8 
and 5.1 of the SmPC). 
The Applicant provided data from NAPOLI-1 regarding the incidence /severity grade of leukopenia/neutropenia 
in UGT1A1*28 homozygous vs heterozygous patients during the first therapy cycle.

Table 49: Incidence and grade of neutropenia and diarrhoea AESI, NAPOLI-1 study, safety population, cycle 1,

The patients with UGT1A1*28 6/6 have been treated with higher doses than those with UGT1A1*28 7/7 
(homozygous), leading to higher rates of neutropenia and diarrhoea in the former group. 
Long-term safety data 
Based on the limited number of patients who received MM-398 for more than 1 year (8 patients), and 
considering the across different characteristics (race, age, sex, dose exposure, TEAEs, grades, seriousness, 
dose modification), no specific patterns in frequency or types of AEs emerged in this long term safety population 
compared to the overall safety analysis population.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  formal  drug/drug  interaction  studies  were  performed.  Interaction  with  other  medicinal  products  has 
previously been described in the EU SmPC of irinotecan.  In study MM-398-07-03-01(NAPOLI 1) Onivyde was 
administered in combination with 5-Fluorouracil and Leucovorin.  
Compared  to  monotherapy  administration,  co-administration  with  5-FU/LV  in  the  Study  MM-398-07-03-01 
resulted in a reduced total irinotecan and SN-38 exposure.

Table 50: Summary of dose reductions and treatment duration – NAPOLI-1 
The patients in MM-398+5FU/LV combination arm had more 1-dose and 3-dose reductions than the 
monotherapy arm, but also a treatment duration over 18 weeks in 35% of the patients (compared with 22.4 % 
in the monotherapy arm).  
Dose delays 
MM-398 monotherapy: 49 patients (33.3%) experienced TEAEs that required dose delay, mostly due to GI 
disorders (12.2%), followed by blood disorders (6.8%). The dose delay ranged from 14-33% during the first 10 
doses administered, with delay of 7 days. 
MM-398+5-FU/LV: dose delays were required in almost two thirds of the patients (61.5%).  Neutropenia (14.5 
%), WBC (12.0%), neutrophil count decreased (9.4%), diarrhoea (7.7%), fatigue (6.8%), vomiting (6.0%), 
and platelet decrease (5.1%) were the most common events requiring a dose delay; all other events were 
reported in less than 5% of patients. In the MM-398+5-FU/LV arm, 27% of patients required a dose delay in the 
beginning of the treatment with a subsequent gradual decrease in the frequency of patients who needed dose 
delay (range 8-17% during the first 10 doses administered). The median dose delay for most doses 
administered was 14 days, i.e. the investigators most often delayed treatment until the next scheduled 
treatment date. 
5-FU/LV: 43 patients (32.1%) required dose delay due to TEAEs; mostly due to GI disorders (10.4%), and 
‘General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (8.2%). 
Dose reductions 
MM-398 monotherapy: 46 patients (31.3%) experienced TEAEs that required dose reductions (34.7% subjects 
with more than one dose reduction). Diarrhoea was reported in 17 patients (11.6%) and vomiting in 9 patients 
(6.1%); all other events in this treatment group that required dose reductions were reported in less than 5% of 
patients.  
MM-398+5-FU/LV: 39 patients (33.3%) experienced TEAEs that required dose reductions (42.7% subjects with 
more than one dose reduction in table 8.3). Neutropenia (10 patients, 8.5%), neutrophil count decreased (8 
patients, 6.8%), diarrhoea (7 patients, 6.0%), and white blood cell count decreased (6 patients, 5.1%) were the 
most common events requiring a dose reduction; all other events were reported in less than 5% of patients.  
Dose reductions occurred in the first 6 cycles in the combination arm. 
5-FU/LV: 5 patients (3.7%) required dose reductions due to TEAEs.

Overall, 17 patients (11.6%) treated with MM-398 monotherapy experienced TEAEs leading to dose 
discontinuation, while with MM-398+5-FU/LV combination therapy, 13 patients (11.1%) required dose

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database consists of 440 patients from 9 clinical studies. As the safety profile of the active substance 
is known, the size of the safety database is considered sufficient to assess the risks associated with 
MM-398/5FU/LV combination in the proposed indication. The pivotal study NAPOLI-1 was used to derive the 
Safety Analysis Population including 264 patients. 
The  most  common  AEs  in  the  Onivyde-containing  arms  are  similar  to  the  known  safety  profile  of  standard 
irinotecan in cancer patients.  
Diarrhoea  is  a  very  common  adverse  reaction  leading  to  colitis,  ileus,  gastroenteritis,  fatigue,  dehydration, 
weight loss, renal toxicities, hyponatraemia, and hypokalaemia. Renal impairment and acute renal failure have 
been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhoea. In the 
pivotal  clinical  study,  Grade 3  or  4  diarrhoea  occurred  in 15  out  of 117  patients (12.8%)  receiving  Onivyde 
+5-FU/LV.  For  patients  experiencing  late  diarrhoea  (> 24 hours),  the  median  time  to  late  diarrhoea  onset 
was 8 days from the previous dose of Onivyde. Early onset diarrhoea, typically appearing ≤24 hours after dose 
administration, can occur and is usually transient. Early onset diarrhoea may also be accompanied by cholinergic 
symptoms  that  can  include  rhinitis,  increased  salivation,  flushing,  diaphoresis,  bradycardia,  miosis  and 
hyperperistalsis  that  can  induce  abdominal  cramping.  In  the  pivotal  clinical  study,  early  diarrhoea  onset 
occurred  in 35  patients  (29.9%)  and  cholinergic  events  occurred  in 4 patients  (3.4%)  receiving  Onivyde 
+5-FU/LV. In patients experiencing early diarrhoea, therapeutic and prophylactic atropine should be considered 
unless contraindicated. Patients should be made aware of the risk of delayed diarrhoea which can be debilitating 
and,  on  rare  occasions,  life  threatening  since  persistent  loose  or  watery  stools  can  result  in  dehydration, 
electrolyte imbalance, colitis, gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration, infection or sepsis. As soon as the first liquid stool 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 96/107 
  
  
 
 
occurs, the patient should start drinking large volumes of beverages containing electrolytes. Patients should 
have loperamide (or equivalent) readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhoea. Loperamide should be 
initiated at first occurrence of poorly formed or loose stools or at the earliest onset of bowel movements more 
frequent than normal. Loperamide should be given until patient is without diarrhoea for at least 12 hours. If 
diarrhoea persists while patient is on loperamide for more than 24 hours, adding oral antibiotic support (e.g. 
fluoroquinolone for 7 days) should be considered. Loperamide should not be used for more than 48 consecutive 
hours due to risk of paralytic ileus. If diarrhoea persists for more than 48 hours, stop loperamide, monitor and 
replace fluid electrolytes and continue antibiotic support until resolution for accompanying symptoms.  Onivyde 
treatment should be delayed until diarrhoea resolves to ≤ Grade 1 (2 3 stools/day more than pre-treatment 
frequency).  Onivyde  must  not  be  administered to  patients  with  bowel obstruction  and  chronic  inflammatory 
bowel disease, until it is resolved. Following Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea, the subsequent dose of Onivyde should be 
reduced (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Myelosuppression, especially neutropenia, was more frequent and severe in the Onivyde-containing arms 
compared to the control arm, and were most frequent in the combination arm. Dose delay, dose reduction, and 
colony stimulating factors were used to manage myelosuppression. Complete blood cell count monitoring is 
recommended during Onivyde treatment. Patients should be aware of the risk of neutropenia and the 
significance of fever. The median time to nadir for ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia is 23 (range 8 - 104) days post first 
dose of treatment with Onivyde. Febrile neutropenia (body temperature > 38°C and neutrophil count ≤1,000 
cells/mm3) should be urgently treated in the hospital with broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Onivyde 
should be withheld if neutropenic fever occurs or the absolute neutrophil count drops below 1500/mm3. Sepsis 
with neutropenic fever and consequent septic shock with fatal outcome has been observed in patients with 
metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with Onivyde. In patients who experienced severe 
haematological events, a dose reduction or treatment discontinuation is recommended (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4).  Patients with severe bone marrow failure should not be treated with Onivyde. 
History of prior abdominal radiation increases the risk of severe neutropenia and febrile neutropenia following 
Onivyde treatment. Close monitoring of blood counts is recommended, and the use of myeloid growth factors 
should be considered for patients with a history of abdominal radiation. Caution should be exercised in patients 
receiving concurrent administration of Onivyde with irradiation. 
Patients with deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin, such as those with Gilbert’s syndrome, may be at greater risk 
of myelosuppression when receiving therapy with Onivyde. 
Thrombocytopenia was infrequent, as has been documented with non-liposomal irinotecan. 
Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines in patients immunocompromised by chemotherapeutic 
medicinal products including Onivyde may result in serious or fatal infections; therefore vaccination with a live 
vaccine should be avoided. Killed or inactivated vaccines may be administered; however, the response to such 
vaccines may be diminished (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
In patients treated with Onyvide, higher total irinotecan Cmax is associated with higher probability of diarrhoea 
(gastrointestinal toxicity), and higher SN-38 Cmax is associated with higher probability of developing neutropenia 
(bone marrow suppression). 
As reported in the PK results, race was a strong covariate in the Onivyde treatment. In NAPOLI-I, Asians showed 
higher frequency of Grade ≥3 drug related TEAEs in the Onivyde combination arm compared to Caucasians 
(72.7% vs 45.2%). This is mainly due to an increased frequency of Grade 3 or higher neutropenia and febrile 
neutropenia in Asians compared to Caucasians. Diarrhoea was less frequent and less severe in Asians compared 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/589179/2016 
Page 97/107 
  
  
to Caucasians in the MM-398 combination arm. This observation could be related to the high prevalence of 
UGT1A1*6 variant in Asian patients, and unfortunately this was not tested in the study. 
The Applicant provided data from NAPOLI-1 regarding the incidence /severity grade of leukopenia/neutropenia 
in UGT1A1*28 homozygous vs heterozygous patients during the first therapy cycle.  
A reduced starting dose of Onivyde (liposomal irinotecan) of 60 mg/ m2 should be considered for patients known 
to be homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele. Patients without drug related toxicities during the first cycle of 
therapy may have the dose of Onivyde increased to a total dose of 80 mg/m2 in subsequent cycles based on 
individual patient tolerance (see sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC). In these patients, a new cycle of 
therapy should not begin until adverse event resolves to ≤ Grade 1. At a first occurrence of a Grade 3 or 4 
adverse reaction (ADR), the Onivyde dose should be reduced to 50 mg/m2. At a second occurrence of a Grade 
3 or 4 ADR, the Onivyde dose should be reduced to 40 mg/m2. At a third occure, treatment should be 
discontinued. 
Overall, the safety profiles of Onivyde monotherapy and Onivyde+5-FU/LV combination therapy were consistent 
with the safety profile of standard irinotecan and 5-FU.  
In comparison with the reference product, certain known AEs of irinotecan have so far not been observed with 
Onivyde: anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions; interstitial lung disease; acute pancreatitis, either because 
liposomal irinotecan does not exhibit these AEs or due to the limited safety database available. 
The Onyvide+5-FU/LV combination was generally better tolerated than the Onyvide monotherapy (mostly due 
to less frequent and less severe GI adverse reactions), with the exception of higher incidence of neutropenia.  
In the Onyvide+5-FU/LV arm, 27% of patients required a dose delay in the beginning of the treatment with a 
subsequent gradual decrease in the frequency of patients who needed dose delay (range 8-17% during the first 
10 doses administered). The median dose delay for most doses administered was 14 days, i.e. the investigators 
most often delayed treatment until the next scheduled treatment date. For the Onyvide monotherapy arm the 
dose delay ranged from 14-33% during the first 10 doses administered, with delay of 7 days. Dose reductions 
occurred in the first 6 cycles in the combination arm. Regarding discontinuations, with the exception of a shorter 
mean time to discontinuation due to AEs in the combination arm, swift investigator decision in the control arm 
and subject’s decision not to participate in the control arm (all expected), the results were overall balanced.  
Hypersensitivity reactions, including acute infusion reaction may occur and Onivyde should be discontinued in 
case of severe hypersensitivity reactions. 
In clinical studies of non-liposomal irinotecan administered on a weekly dosage schedule, patients with modestly 
elevated baseline serum total bilirubin levels (1.0 to 2.0 mg/dl) had a significantly greater likelihood of 
experiencing first cycle Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 
mg/dl. Regular monitoring of complete blood counts should be conducted in patients with total bilirubin of 1.0 
2.0 mg/dl due to possible increase of the concentration of SN 38 and thus increased risk of neutropenia in this 
population. The use of Onivyde should be avoided in patients with bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dl, or aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or > 5 
times ULN if liver metastasis is present. In addition, caution is required when Onivyde is given in combination 
with other hepatotoxic medicinal products, especially in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Patients with a history of a Whipple procedure have a higher risk of serious infections following Onivyde 
treatment. Patients should be monitored for signs of infections (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).

Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)-like events leading to fatalities have occurred in patients receiving non-liposomal 
irinotecan. No cases of ILD-like events have been reported with Onivyde therapy in clinical studies. Risk factors 
include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic medicinal products, colony stimulating factors or having 
previously received radiation therapy. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory 
symptoms before and during Onivyde therapy. A reticulo-nodular pattern on chest X-ray was observed in a small 
percentage of patients enrolled in a clinical study with irinotecan. New or progressive dyspnoea, cough, and 
fever should prompt interruption of Onivyde treatment, pending diagnostic evaluation. Onivyde should be 
discontinued in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of ILD. 
Because of the increased risk of ADRs (including Grade 3/4), caution should be exercised when using Onivyde in 
patients with body mass index <18.5 kg/m2. 
Forty one percent (41%) of patients treated with Onivyde across the clinical program were ≥ 65 years. No dose 
adjustment is recommended. 
It is recommended that patients receive premedication with standard doses of dexamethasone (or an equivalent 
corticosteroid) together with a 5-HT3 antagonist (or other antiemetic) at least 30 minutes prior to Onivyde 
infusion (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during Onivyde treatment and 1 month 
thereafter. Males should use condoms during Onivyde treatment and 4 months thereafter.   
There are no adequate data on the use of Onivyde in pregnant women. Onivyde can cause harm to the foetus 
when administered to the pregnant woman, as the main ingredient irinotecan has been shown to be embryotoxic 
and teratogenic in animals. Therefore, based on results from animal studies and the mechanism of action of 
irinotecan, Onivyde should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If Onivyde is used during 
pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving therapy, the patient should be informed about the 
potential hazard to the foetus. 
It is unknown whether Onivyde or its metabolites are excreted into human milk. Because of the potential for 
serious adverse reactions of Onivyde in breast-feeding infants, Onivyde is contraindicated during breast-feeding 
(see sections 4.3 and 4.6 of the SmPC). Patients should not breast-feed until one month after the last dose. 
There are no data on the impact of Onivyde on human fertility. Non-liposomal irinotecan was shown to cause 
atrophy of male and female reproductive organs after multiple daily irinotecan doses in animals (see sections 
4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC). 
In clinical trials, Onivyde was administered at doses up to 240 mg/m2 to patients with various cancers. The 
adverse reactions in these patients were similar to those reported with the recommended dosage and regimen. 
There have been reports of overdose with non-liposomal irinotecan at doses up to approximately twice the 
recommended therapeutic dose of irinotecan, which may be fatal. The most significant adverse reactions 
reported were severe neutropenia and severe diarrhoea. There is no known antidote for overdose of Onivyde. 
Maximum supportive care should be instituted to prevent dehydration due to diarrhoea and to treat any 
infectious complications (see section 4.9 of the SmPC). 
Onivyde has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. During treatment patients should 
observe caution when driving or using machines (see section 4.7 of the SmPC). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate, contained in Onivyde, is a known active substance, whose safety profile is 
well established. In NAPOLI-1, most TEAEs of Onivyde in combination with 5FU/LV were manageable with 
supportive therapy, dose delays or both. No unexpected safety findings have so far emerged from the liposomal 
irinotecan development program to challenge what is previously known from standard irinotecan.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers that irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate is not a new active 
substance, as it is a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional expert consultation 
During the evaluation procedure for Onivyde, a Healthcare Professional consultation was launched to check 
whether there could be a potential risk of medication errors between the liposomal and non-liposomal 
formulation of irinotecan on the basis of the proposed product information and what measures could be 
implemented in the packaging or SmPC to minimise such risk. 
The comments received in this consultation prompted the PRAC and CHMP to request further changes to the 
labelling (mainly to clearly differentiate both formulations and indicating that they are not equivalent). The MAH 
adequately addressed these concerns by amending the labelling and SmPC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Favourable effects 
In the pivotal trial, conducted in a heterogeneous population with respect to prior therapy, the primary endpoint 
of OS, resulted in a median 1.9 month survival benefit in favour of the experimental arm (6.1 vs 4.2 months, HR 
0.67, p=0.0122, cut-off 0.025). As a sensitivity analysis, a stratified analysis by baseline stratification factors is 
reported and shows more convincing results with an HR of 0.57 (p-value = 0.0009). As this stratified analysis 
would be the CHMP preferred analysis, the concerns related to the statistically borderline character of the 
primary analysis are alleviated.  
An improved survival of median 2 months, or a 50% prolongation of median survival, is considered clinically and 
regulatory meaningful in patients with relapsed/refractory pancreatic cancer.  
The combination of Onivyde+5-FU/LV achieved a median investigator-assessed PFS of 3.1 vs 1.5 months for the 
control arm, HR 0.56, p=0.0001. Delayed tumour progression in pancreatic cancer is expected to delay 
symptom progression in this condition characterised by severe symptoms: mainly pain, weight loss and fatigue.  
The confirmed ORR for Onivyde+5-FU/LV was 7.7% (95% CI: 2.86, 12.52) compared to 0.8% for 5-FU/LV.  
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The 5FU/LV regimens in the control arm and the experimental arm were dissimilar enough to warrant further 
discussion. It would have facilitated the assessment of the add-on benefit of Onivyde if the same 5FU/LV 
regimen had been used as background and control, but the differences are considered too small to be of 
relevance in terms of survival.  
With reference to the CONKO-003 trial, the control 5FU/LV regimen in NAPOLI-1 cannot be viewed as too 
non-intensive.  
A trend towards improved PFS (HR 0.8, p=0.1) was shown in the comparison of Onivyde vs. 5FU/LV, at very 
similar OS (HR 0.99). In this context it is acknowledged that it is unknown whether 5FU/LV provides a survival 
benefit in this population.  
In the monotherapy arm, Onivyde was administered at 120 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and in the combination arm 
80 mg/m2 every 2 weeks, i.e. the same dose intensity over a 6-week period. The importance of this difference 
from a benefit/risk perspective is unknown. Therefore the add-on benefit of 5FU/LV to Onivyde cannot be 
disentangled, however this is not a regulatory concern.  
Due to a too high early attrition rate, informative HRQoL data are not available. 
Among the pre-planned OS subgroup analyses, a treatment effect favouring the 5-FU/LV over the combination 
arm has been observed for prior irinotecan use. This observation is also confirmed by univariate and multivariate 
analyses conducted to identify possible prognostic factors for both OS and PFS, which consistently showed that 
prior irinotecan, together with age>65, negatively impacted on the prognosis of patients treated with the 
combination arm.

The lack of benefit (if not a detrimental effect) in patients pre-treated with irinotecan raises concerns due to the 
increasing use of irinotecan-containing regimen as first line therapy. Due to the limited number of patients with 
prior exposure to non-liposomal irinotecan, the benefit of Onivyde has not been established in this population. 
This information has been reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The TEAE causality seems in line with the known safety profile of irinotecan, i.e. gastrointestinal AEs and 
hematotoxicity. Whilst the dose intensity per 6 weeks was the same (120 mg/m2 x 2 vs 80 mg/m2 x 3), the 80 
mg/m2 regimen in combination with 5FU/LV resulted in more myelosuppression, but gastrointestinal adverse 
reactions were more commonly observed in the 120 mg/m2 arm. ‘Fatigue’ and ‘asthenia’ were also more 
frequently observed in the combination arm.  
In comparison with the 5-FU/LV control arm almost all adverse reactions were more commonly observed in the 
combination arm. These differences resulted in more dose reductions (33% vs. 4%) and discontinuations (11% 
vs. 8%). 
Early diarrhoea (onset day1, consistent with cholinergic hyper-stimulation) occurred twice as frequently in the 
combination arm (29.9%) than in the other two arms. Late events (after day1) were more frequent in the 
combination arm (42.7%) than in the control arm. However, diarrhoea was manageable with supportive 
therapy. 
Patients with baseline serum bilirubin levels ≥1.0 mg/dL, or with deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin e.g. 
Gilbert’s syndrome, may be at greater risk for neutropenia. Patients who are homozygous for UGT1A1*28 have 
a greater risk of haematological toxicity with irinotecan.  
In patients treated with Onyvide, diarrhoea (gastrointestinal toxicity) is associated with total irinotecan Cmax, 
and neutropenia (bone marrow suppression) is associated with unencapsulated SN-38 Cmax. The observed 
incidence of grade≥3 diarrhoea and neutropenia by race are also consistent with the difference in the 
pharmacokinetics. 
There is an increased risk of infections and haematological toxicity in patients with severe diarrhoea. Close 
clinical monitoring is advised.  
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In comparison with standard irinotecan, certain known AEs of irinotecan have so far not been observed with 
Onivyde, such as interstitial lung disease and acute pancreatitis; either because liposomal irinotecan does not 
exhibit these AEs or due to the limited safety database available. These events will be monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The newer approaches to the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma – e.g. 5-FU/LV with 
irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel have improved the outcomes in this 
patient group, with response rates between 23% and 31%, PFS of 5.5–6.6 months, and OS between 8.5 and 11 
months. Due to good tolerability, however, gemcitabine monotherapy remains a viable treatment option.  
In the next-line setting the prognosis is very poor and tolerability becomes an even more important issue. No 
patient reported outcome data are available to inform the assessment with regard to the perceived side effects 
of therapy. Therefore conventional adverse event reporting has to be used in the assessment of tolerability.  
With respect to efficacy, survival is the best overall measure of treatment benefit, but delayed progression is 
likely to be related to delayed symptomatic progression. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In view of the survival benefit of Onivyde in combination with 5-FU/LV and the identified risks of irinotecan, the 
benefit/risk balance of Onivyde in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas previously treated with a 
gemcitabine based therapy is considered favourable.

1.  Introduction 
On the 16 March 2021, the MAH submitted the final study results from a completed phase IIIB 
paediatric clinical study for Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel; ATC code: L01XX71) in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure (PAM) for this study.  
A short critical expert overview summarizing the results in the final CSR has also been provided. 
This phase IIIb clinical study is not part of any paediatric investigational plan (PIP). 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the Phase IIIb study CCTL019B2001X (hereafter referred to as study B2001X) in 
paediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 
treated with tisagenlecleucel is a stand-alone study.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Kymriah is an immunocellular therapy containing tisagenlecleucel, autologous T cells genetically 
modified ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). 
Kymriah comprises cell dispersion for infusion, where 1-3 infusion bags contain a total of 1.2x106 to 
6x108 CAR-positive viable T-cells. The concentration of CAR-positive viable T-cells is dependent on 
patient body weight for treatment of patients with B-cell ALL. The cellular composition and the final cell 
number varies between individual patient batches. 
The approved dose range for paediatric and young adult patients with B-cell ALL is 0.2 to 5x106 CAR-
positive viable T-cells/kg body weight for subjects ≤50 kg and 0.1 to 2.5x108 CAR-positive viable T-
cells (non-weight based) for patients >50 kg.  
No change in formulation was made for the paediatric population in study B2001X. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study CCTL019B2001X (B2001X; Protocol version 4.0 dated 06.08.2019). The Final Report is 
• 
dated 5th March 2021. 
Study B2001X is a phase IIIb open-label, multicentre, single arm study designed to further evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL 
after the closure of enrolment to the pivotal study CCTL019B2202 (hereafter referred to as B2202). 
The inclusion of certain patients not studied during study B2202 was also allowed, e.g., < 3-year-olds 
or patients with prior blinatumomab exposure.  
Kymriah (INN: tisagenlecleucel, product code CTL019) was approved in the EU via the centralized 
procedure (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004090) on 23-Aug-2018 and is indicated for the treatment of:

• 
Paediatric and young adult patients up to and including 25 years of age with B-cell ALL that is 
refractory, in relapse post-transplant or in second or later relapse. 
•  Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or 
more lines of systemic therapy. 
The evidence of efficacy in paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL was at the time of 
initial marketing authorization (MA) primarily based on data from the pivotal study B2202, which is a 
phase II open-label, multicentre, single arm study. In addition, the final results from the complete data 
set of study B2205J, which was reviewed during a previous Article 46 procedure (Procedure No. 
EMA/H/C/004090/P46/011), have provided supportive evidence for the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in 
the approved ALL indication (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/004090/II/0030). Study B2205J was a phase II, 
open-label, multicentre, single arm study that was designed to demonstrate or support the efficacy and 
safety of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric and young adult patients with B-cell ALL who had relapsed or 
were refractory to prior therapies. 
The final results of study B2001X are now submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No 1901/2006, which requires that any MAH-sponsored study involving use in a paediatric population 
of a medicinal product covered by a MA, whether or not it is conducted in compliance with an agreed 
PIP, should be submitted to the competent authority within six months of completion of the concerned 
study. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study B2001X 
Methods 
Objectives and outcome/endpoints 
The primary objective of study B2001X was to evaluate the safety of tisagenlecleucel treatment as 
measured by adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities. 
Secondary objectives included various efficacy, exposure-responses to cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS) grades, clinical cellular kinetic, and immunogenicity endpoints. These included, but were not 
limited to: response using MRD assessments before infusion and Day 28 ± 4 days and before 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) by local assessment, i.e. flow cytometry with or 
without qPCR. 
Study objectives and related endpoints are shown in Table 1.

Study design 
Study B2001X had the following sequential phases for all patients: screening including leukapheresis, 
enrolment and pre-treatment (cell product preparation, bridging- and lymphodepleting [LD] 
chemotherapy), treatment and follow-up, which included a single tisagenlecleucel infusion and follow-
up until month 12. After 12 months post-infusion, the patients were transitioned into the long-term 
follow-up (LTFU) study A2205B for lentiviral vector safety and efficacy follow-up that was run under a 
separate protocol in accordance with health authority guidelines for patients treated with gene 
therapies (Figure 1). The main purpose of the study was to assess the safety of tisagenlecleucel for up 
to 12 months post-infusion.

7. Patients previously treated with blinatumomab who had detectable leukemia and documented 
CD19+ expression (via flow cytometry) and confirmed absence of CD19- leukemic blasts at Screening 
could be included. In that case, at least a 1-week washout period had to be applied from last dose of 
blinatumomab to start of leukapheresis. Patients previously treated with blinatumomab and no 
detectable MRD (i.e. MRD negative demonstrated by leukemic blasts < 0.01%) were excluded.  
Note: blinatumomab must not have been administered as a bridging therapy prior to tisagenlecleucel

8. Signed written informed consent forms (ICFs) and assent forms if applicable must have been 
obtained prior to any study procedures. 
9. Must have met the institutional criteria to undergo leukapheresis or have had an acceptable, stored 
leukapheresis product. 
10. Once all other eligibility criteria were confirmed, must have had a leukapheresis product of non-
mobilized cells received and accepted by the manufacturing site. Note: Leukapheresis product were not 
shipped to or assessed for acceptance by the manufacturing site until documented confirmation of all 
other eligibility criteria was received.  
11. Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia involvement defined as CNS-3 by 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings only were eligible but had their tisagenlecleucel infusion delayed until 
CNS disease was reduced to CNS-1 or CNS-2 by CSF findings. Patients with other forms of active CNS-
3 leukemic involvement such as CNS parenchymal or ocular disease, cranial nerve involvement or 
significant leptomeningeal disease were not eligible. However, such patients with other forms of CNS-3 
leukemic involvement (non-CSF involvement) were eligible if there was documented evidence of 
disease stabilization for at least 3 months prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. Patients must have had no 
acute/ongoing neurologic toxicity > grade 1 with the exception of a history of controlled seizures or 
fixed neurologic deficits that had been stable/improving over the previous 3 months.

f. Radiotherapy 
•  Non-CNS site of radiation had to be completed > 2 weeks prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
•  CNS directed radiation had to be completed > 8 weeks prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
g. Anti-T-cell antibodies: Administration of any T-cell lytic or toxic antibody (e.g. alemtuzumab) 
within 8 weeks prior to tisagenlecleucel was prohibited since residual lytic levels could destroy the 
infused tisagenlecleucel cells and/or prevent their in vivo expansion. If such an agent had been 
administered within 8 weeks prior to tisagenlecleucel, the Sponsor was to be contacted, consultation 
with a pharmacology expert was to be considered, and measurement of residual drug levels was to be 
considered, if feasible, prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
17. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

pregnant, and sexually active males, unless they agreed to using highly effective methods of 
contraception from enrollment and for at least 12 months after the tisagenlecleucel infusion and until 
CAR T-cells were no longer present by q-PCR on 2 consecutive tests. q-PCR test results were available 
upon request. In addition, male participants must not have donated sperm for the time period specified

above. NOTE: If local regulations deviated from the contraception methods listed in the protocol to 
prevent pregnancy, local regulations applied and were to be described in the ICF. 
In addition to exclusion criteria, live vaccines were not to be used in tisagenlecleucel recipients for at 
least 6 weeks prior to the start of LD chemotherapy, during tisagenlecleucel treatment, and until 
immune recovery following treatment with tisagenlecleucel. 
Treatments 
Leukapheresis: Leukapheresis was performed as per study protocol or per local institutional 
guidelines. The manufacturing facility evaluated the patient’s leukapheresis product for acceptance. 
Final enrollment was defined as the point at which the patient met all clinical inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, and the patient’s leukapheresis product was accepted for manufacturing. 
Lymphodepletion (LD): If patients had a white blood cell (WBC) count ≤ 1,000 cells/μL within 1 
week prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, LD regimen was not required. LD chemotherapy was to start 1 
week prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, which meant that tisagenlecleucel was infused 2 to 14 days 
after LD depending on the LD regimen used. LD could be repeated in case tisagenlecleucel was delayed 
by more than 4 weeks. The preferred regimen was as follows: 
• 
Fludarabine (30 mg/m2 i.v. daily for 4 days), and 
Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 i.v. daily for 2 days starting with the first dose of fludarabine) 
If the patient had a previous grade 4 hemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide, or demonstrated a 
chemo-refractory state to a cyclophosphamide-containing regimen administered shortly before LD 
chemotherapy, then the following were to be used: 
•  Cytarabine 500 mg/m2 i.v. daily for 2 days, and 
• 
Etoposide 150 mg/m2 i.v. daily for 3 days starting with the first dose of cytarabine. 
No other regimen was allowed for LD. Female patients of childbearing potential were to have a 
negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 24 hours prior to the start of LD therapy or within 5 
days prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Tisagenlecleucel infusion: Tisagenlecleucel was released to the study site provided all required 
safety and quality release specifications were met.  
Once tisagenlecleucel transduced viable T-cells were thawed and at room temperature (20°C to 25°C), 
they were to be infused within 30 minutes to maintain maximum product viability, including any 
interruption during the infusion. 
Based on the patient’s weight reported at the time of leukapheresis/Screening (note: for patients with 
a historical leukapheresis product, the patient’s weight reported at the time of Screening was used), 
one of the 2 following allowable dose ranges was prepared: 
• 
• 
For pediatric and young adult patients with r/r ALL whose weight was ≤ 50 kg, the targeted 
dose was 0.2 to 5.0 × 106 autologous CAR-positive viable T-cells per kg body weight. 
For pediatric and young adult patients with r/r ALL whose weight was > 50 kg, the targeted 
dose was 0.1 to 2.5 × 108 autologous CAR-positive viable T-cells. 
Patients were infused with the maximum cell dose within the recommended ranges that can be 
individually manufactured. Products falling below the minimum values in the above allowable cell dose 
ranges were evaluated for provision to the patient under exceptional circumstances after approval by 
Health Authorities for infusion.

The tisagenlecleucel dose was administered via a single intravenous (IV) infusion. 
Statistical Methods 
Sample size 
There were no formal sample size calculations performed for this study. Based on the estimated 
availability of eligible patients who could provide an acceptable leukapheresis product of non-mobilized 
cells to the manufacturing site, manufacturing capacity of tisagenlecluecel product, and an anticipated 
recruitment duration will be ~ 2 years, it was anticipated to enrol approximately 80 patients.  
Analysis sets 
The Screened Set comprised all patients who have signed the informed consent/assent and were 
screened in the study.  
The Enrolled set (ENS) comprised all patients who were enrolled in the study. Enrolment date was 
defined as the point at which the patient met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the patients’ 
leukapheresis product was received and accepted by the manufacturing facility. 
The Full analysis set (FAS) comprised of all patients who received infusion of tisagenlecleucel. 
The Safety set (SAF) comprised of all patients who received infusion of tisagenlecleucel.  
The Per-protocol set (PPS) consisted of a subset of patients in the FAS who were compliant with major 
requirements of the clinical study protocol. 
The Cellular kinetic analysis set (CKAS) consisted of a subset of patients in the FAS who had at least 
one sample providing evaluable CKAS data.  
Primary analysis 
The primary variable was overall TEAEs (including SAEs and laboratory abnormalities observed after 
tisagenlecleucel infusion) in the Safety set (SAF, equivalent to FAS), for which no statistical hypothesis 
testing was planned or performed.  
Statistical methods for secondary endpoints 
For secondary endpoints response was determined by the investigator. The FAS was used as the 
efficacy analysis set.  
Estimates of:  
• 
• 
• 
The proportion of patients who achieved complete remission (which included CR or CRi during 
the 6 months after tisagenlecleucel infusion),  
Percentage of patients who achieved CR or CRi and then proceed to SCT while in remission 
before Month 6 response assessment, and  
Percentage of patients who achieved CR or CRi and then proceed to HSCT while in remission 
before Month 6 response assessment, and  
•  Response at Day 28 ± 4 days*, were all summarised with two-sided exact 95% Clopper-
Pearson confidence intervals.  
Duration of remission (DOR) was defined as the duration from the date when the response criteria of 
CR or CRi was first met to the date of relapse or death due to underlying cancer.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/617616/2021  
Page 11/54 
 
 
 
Relapse free survival (RFS) was measured by the time from achievement of CR or CRi whichever 
occurred first to relapse or death due to any cause during CR or CRi.  
Event free survival (EFS) was the time from date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to the earliest of: 
Death from any cause after remission, Relapse or Treatment failure. Treatment failure was defined as 
no response in the study and discontinuation from the study due to any of the following reasons: 
Death Adverse event, Lack of efficacy, New anticancer therapy.  
For time-to-event analyses (DOR, RFS, EFS and OS), the survival function was estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier (product-limit) method. Median survival and KM-estimates at specific time points with 
95% confidence intervals were presented.  
For DOR, RFS and EFS Patients were censored at the last disease assessment prior or on the date of: 
ongoing no event, lost to follow-up, withdrew consent, New anti-cancer therapy, adequate assessment 
no longer available, event after at least two missing scheduled disease assessments. Sensitivity 
analyses not censoring for HSCT were performed. As HSCT was considered an important treatment 
option in responding patients, it was deemed appropriate to consider the date of HSCT as the 
censoring date, instead of censoring at the last tumour assessment date. A sensitivity analysis was to 
be performed in which the date of relapse or death (if due to the underlying cancer) after HSCT was 
used for the calculation of DOR. In case of treatment failure, the event date was set to Study Day 1. In 
addition, a sensitivity analysis of EFS was performed by considering time of discontinuation from the 
study as the event time for treatment failure, instead of setting to Study Day 1.  
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from date of first tisagenlecleucel infusion to the date of 
death due to any reason. Patients not known to have died were censored at latest date known to be 
alive. No censoring for SCT was done.  
Missing Data  
Patients with unknown clinical response were treated as non-responders, or by censoring for the time 
to event endpoints as described above.  
Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses were considered exploratory, ORR by age subgroups (< 12y, ≥12y to <18y, ≥ 18y) 
tumour burden at baseline were presented.  
Interim analysis 
No formal interim analysis was planned or performed; safety was reviewed periodically. 
Assessor’s comment 
Standard methods have been applied for estimation of primary and secondary endpoints. The 
censoring rules applied to the time-to-event endpoints are the same as in the preceding B2202 pivotal 
study. Overall, the statistical methods are endorsed.  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Study B2001X enrolled and treated paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL at 11 
investigative centers in 9 countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Japan, 
and Norway). Study initiation date was 24-Apr-2017 (first patient first visit) and study completion date 
was 13-Oct-2020 (last patient last visit).

A total of 81 patients were screened, 77 (95.1%) of whom satisfied all eligibility criteria; of these, 74 
patients (91.4%) were enrolled in the study and 3 (3.7%) were not enrolled (1 patient died, 1 was not 
enrolled due to physician decision and 1 was a screen failure).  
Table 2: Overview of paediatric disposition during Study B2001X 
Of the 74 patients who constituted the Enrolled set, 69 (93.2%; 52 pediatrics) were infused and 
received tisagenlecleucel and thereby constituted the FAS (Table 2). The remaining 5 patients (6.8%) 
discontinued after enrolment and prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion due to the following reasons: There 
were 4 patients (5.4%) who died while waiting for infusion and 1 patient (1.4%) had their 
investigational product not released from manufacturing, i.e. product could not be manufactured. 
Among the 69 patients who received tisagenlecleucel infusion in the FAS, 33 (47.8%) completed both 
their treatment and primary follow-up phase of whom 36.2% (25/69) were pediatric patients. Reasons 
for discontinuing tisagenlecleucel infusion and the primary follow-up- phase are detailed in Table 2.  
Patients < 12 years of age 
A total of 42 patients were < 12 years of age in the FAS; 20 patients (47.6%) completed the primary 
follow-up phase and 22 patients (52.4%) discontinued. The most frequent reason for discontinuation 
was progressive disease (16.7%; 7/42), followed by lack of efficacy (11.9%; 5/42), death (9.5%; 
4/42), physician’s decision and patient/guardian decision (4.8%; 2/42 of each). The remaining 2 
patients discontinued due to new therapy for study indication and protocol deviation. The majority of 
patients (83.3%; 35/42) < 12 years of age were enrolled into the LTFU study A2205B. 
Patients ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age

A total of 10 patients were ≥ 12 and < 18 years of age in the FAS; 5 patients (50%) completed the 
primary follow-up phase and 5 patients (50%) discontinued (all due to progression of the underlying 
disease). Over half of patients (60%; 6/10) ≥ 12 and < 18 years of age were enrolled into the LTFU 
study A2205B. 
Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations are presented for the FAS by deviation category in Table 3.  
There were no major protocol deviations.  
Table 3: Protocol deviations (FAS) 
Treatment deviations mainly consisted of total window between signature of ICF and tisagenlecleucel 
infusion exceeded 16 weeks (8 patients, 11.6%); and cardiac evaluation was not repeated prior to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion (6 patients, 8.7%). In addition, influenza testing was not performed, or no 
confirmation of symptoms was performed prior to infusion for 1 patient (1.4%), and 1 patient (1.4%) 
had an uncontrolled active infection prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Exclusion criteria deviations consisted of patient had active or latent hepatitis B per exclusion criteria 
at study entry (4 patients, 5.8%); use of non-study chemotherapy within excluded time frame prior to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion (3 patients, 4.3%); patient had active CNS involvement by malignancy, 
defined as CNS-3 per NCCN guidelines per exclusion criteria at study entry (2 patients, 2.9%); and use 
of steroid medication within excluded time frame prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion (1 patient, 1.4%). 
Inclusion criteria deviations consisted of ALT results not meeting the inclusion criteria (2 patients, 
2.9%), written informed consent not obtained (2 patients, 2.9%) AST results not meeting the inclusion 
criteria (1 patient, 1.4%), age at initial diagnosis not met (1 patient, 1.4%), and incorrect version of 
informed consent obtained (1 patient, 1.4%).

The median age at initial diagnosis for patients ≥ 18 years of age in the FAS (n=17) was 17.0 years; 
most patients (94.1%; 16/17) were ≥ 10 years at the initial diagnosis (i.e. a number of years prior to 
Screening). All patients had relapsed disease. 
Prior anti-neoplastic therapy 
All patients had received prior antineoplastic therapy. The number of prior lines of therapy are shown 
in Table 8.  
Table 8: Primary disease history and prior antineoplastic therapies (FAS) 
The majority of patients (81.2%) discontinued prior antineoplastic medications due to completion of 
the prescribed regimen; 8.7% discontinued due to disease progression. The best hematological 
response at last treatment was CR (36.2%), CRi (1.4%), PR (7.2%), treatment failure (20.3%), 
unknown (15.9%), or not applicable (18.8%). 
All patients had received prior antineoplastic therapy. Of the 52 paediatric patients there were 21.2% 
(11/52) with prior exposure to blinatumomab and 9.6% (5/52) with prior inotuzumab therapy. This 
trend was consistent with the overall study population, e.g. 21.7% (15/69) with prior blinatumomab 
exposure; 10.1% (7/69) with prior inotuzumab exposure.  
A total of 6 patients (8.7%) had prior antineoplastic surgery (4 patients, 5.8% had a biopsy and 2 
patients, 2.9% had other procedure). Overall, 42.0% of patients had prior radiotherapy, at the last 
radiotherapy mostly in the body (26.1%) as conditioning for SCT (31.9%). All patients had prior 
antineoplastic medications, mostly as an induction treatment (37.7%) followed by conditioning for SCT 
(27.5%), salvage (18.8%), maintenance (13.0%), or consolidation (2.9%).  
Furthermore, a number of participants had received prior HSCT (Table 9). The allogenic donor was 
most frequently unrelated (fully matched (38.1%)) or sibling (fully matched (26.2%)) or unrelated 
(any mismatch (23.8%)). The MRD status was negative prior to HSCT for the majority of patients 
(61.9%).

Exposure to study treatment 
Regarding the tisagenlecleucel dose, the majority of patients (85.5%) had a dose within the target 
range, 11.6% (8/69) had a dose below the target range, and 2.9% (2/69) had a dose above the target 
range. Similar values were obtained for patients ≤ 50 kg and > 50 kg. The mean weight-adjusted 
transduced cell dose infused was 2.2 × 106 cells/kg overall; 2.2 × 106 cells/kg for patients ≤ 50 kg and 
2.1 × 106 cells/kg for patients > 50 kg. The mean weight-adjusted total cell dose infused was 10.8 × 
106 cells/kg; 12.3 × 106 cells/kg for patients ≤ 50 kg and 7.0 × 106 cells/kg for patients > 50 kg. 
Weight adjusted dose is based on weight used for manufacturing. The target dose range is 0.2 to 5 x 
106 CAR-positive cells/kg for patients ≤ 50 kg, and 0.1 to 2.5 x 108 tisagenlecleucel for patients >50 
kg. Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the SAF (N). 
Patients < 12 years of age 
Regarding the tisagenlecleucel dose, the majority of patients < 12 years of age in the SAF (90.5%; 
38/42) had a dose within the target range, 7.1% (3/42) had a dose below the target range, and 1 
patients (2.4%) had a dose above the target range. The mean weight-adjusted transduced cell dose 
infused was 2.3 × 106 cells/kg overall; 2.3 × 106 cells/kg for patients ≤ 50 kg and 1.8 × 106 cells/kg 
for patients > 50 kg. The mean weight-adjusted total cell dose infused was 13.2 × 106 cells/kg; 13.4 × 
106 for patients ≤ 50 kg and 3.0 × 106 cells/kg for patients > 50 kg. 
Patients ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age 
The majority of patients ≥ 12 and < 18 years of age in the SAF (80.0%; 8/10) had a dose within the 
target range, and 20.0% (2/10) had a dose below the target range. The mean weight-adjusted 
transduced cell dose infused was 1.7 × 106 cells/kg overall; 1.9 × 106 cells/kg for patients ≤ 50 kg and 
1.4 × 106 cells/kg for patients > 50 kg. The mean weight-adjusted total cell dose infused was 7.7 × 
106 cells/kg; 7.5 × 106 patients ≤ 50 kg and 8.2 × 106 cells/kg for patients > 50 kg.

Patients ≥ 18 years of age 
The majority of patients ≥ 18 years of age in the SAF (76.5%; 13/17) had a dose within the target 
range, 17.6% (3/17) had a dose below the target range and 1 patient (5.9%) had a dose above the 
target range. The mean weight-adjusted transduced cell dose infused was 2.2 × 106 cells/kg overall; 
0.1 × 106 cells/kg for patients ≤ 50 kg and 2.3 × 106 cells/kg for patients > 50 kg. The mean weight-
adjusted total cell dose infused was 6.6 × 106 cells/kg; 0.1 × 106 patients ≤ 50 kg and 7.0 × 106 
cells/kg for patients > 50 kg.  
One patient aged 33 years received a split dose of tisagenlecleucel due to Urgent Safety Measure. The 
patient was administered the split dose safely over 2 days: 0.5 × 108 cells (partial infusion) on 15-
Aug-2018 and 0.8 × 108 cells (full infusion) on 16-Aug-2018, resulting in a total dose of 1.3 × 108 
cells. The mean weight-adjusted total cell dose for this patient was 2.6 × 106 cells/kg and the mean 
tisagenlecleucel dose was 2.2 × 106 cells/kg, which was within the target dose range. 
Assessor’s comment 
The clinical study report (CSR) does not clearly identify whether any delays were reported for 
tisagenlecleucel production and in relation to leukapheresis and time to infusion. Information on the 
time interval between screening and enrolment, and the time from enrolment to infusion for study 
B2001X was omitted from the CSR. 
The majority of participants (55.1%) had received one HSCT prior to tisagenlecleucel treatment, in 
common with the proportion reported for study B2202, where 53.2% of the infused participants had 
undergone one prior HSCT. 
In contrast to study B2202, study B2001X allowed for the inclusion of participants who were previously 
treated with blinatumomab when CD19 tumour expression was demonstrated (via flow cytometry) at 
screening. Of the 52 paediatric patients enrolled, 21.2% (11/52) had previously been exposed to 
blinatumomab. This proportion was consistent with the overall study population where 21.7% (15/69) 
had prior blinatumomab exposure. Currently the product information states that “there is limited 
experience with Kymriah in patients exposed to prior CD19-directed therapy”. Data on enrolled 
patients who were previously treated with blinatumomab in study B2001X indicates revision of section 
4.4 of the SmPC is appropriate. 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy was assessed as a secondary endpoint in this study.  
The median duration of study follow-up defined as the time from Kymriah infusion to the date of 
completion or discontinuation from follow-up prior to the data cut-off date in the SAF was 11.6 months 
(range: 0.2-13.1). The majority of patients (42.0%; 29/69) were followed up for 6 to < 12 months, 
whereas 29.0% (20/69) of each were followed up for either < 6 months or ≥ 12 months. 
Overall response assessments are presented for the FAS (Table 10). The median follow-up time for 
ORR was 11.7 months (without censoring HSCT) with a maximum follow-up time of 24.4 months.  
Overall, efficacy results were consistent in pediatrics (i.e. non-adolescents and adolescents) vs. the 
overall study population with respect to ORR, DOR, and EFS, during study B2001X.

ORR for Patients ≥ 18 years of age 
The ORR (BOR as CR or CRi, confirmed response) reported during the 6 months after tisagenlecleucel 
administration for patients ≥ 18 years of age in the FAS (n=17) was 76.5% (95% CI: 50.1, 93.2). The 
BOR (confirmed response) was CR for 29.4% (5/17), CRi for 47.1% (8/17), no response for 2 patients 
(11.8%), and unknown for 2 patients (11.8%). 
DOR in Patients ≥ 18 years of age 
A total of 13 patients ≥ 18 years of age had a BOR of CR or CRi (confirmed response) in the FAS. 
Overall, 30.8% (4/13) who achieved a BOR of CR or CRi reported relapse or death due to underlying 
cancer. The estimated DOR probability was 100.0% (95% CI: 100.0, 100.0) 28 days after patients first 
met BOR of CR or CRi (confirmed response), 92.3% (95% CI: 56.6, 98.9) 3 months after patients first 
met BOR of CR or CRi (confirmed response), 75.5% (95% CI: 41.6, 91.4) 6 months after patients first 
met BOR of CR or CRi (confirmed response), and 66.1% (95% CI: 32.5, 85.8) 9 months after patients 
first met BOR of CR or CRi (confirmed response).

EFS in patients >18 years of age 
Among the patients ≥ 18 years of age who had EFS data in the FAS (n=17), 29.4% (5/17) had an 
event of relapse. The estimated EFS probability was 100.0% (95% CI: 100.0, 100.0) at Day 28, 85.1% 
(95% CI: 52.3, 96.1) at Month 3, 68.8% (95% CI: 36.4, 87.1) at Month 6, and 60.2% (95% CI: 28.8, 
81.3) at month 9 and month 12. 
Patients with low baseline tumor burden 
A total of 26 patients had low bone marrow tumor burden at Baseline in the FAS. The ORR reported 
during the 6 months after tisagenlecleucel administration was 88.5% (95% CI: 69.8, 97.6). The BOR 
(confirmed response) was CR for 61.5% (16/26), CRi for 26.9% (7/26), no response for 1 patient 
(3.8%) and unknown for 2 patients (7.7%). 
Patients with high baseline tumor burden 
A total of 40 patients had high bone marrow tumor burden at Baseline in the FAS. The ORR reported 
during the 6 months after tisagenlecleucel administration was 77.5% (95% CI: 61.5, 89.2). The BOR 
(confirmed response) was CR for 52.5% (21/40), CRi for 25.0% (10/40), no response for 2 patients 
(5.0%), and unknown for 7 patients (17.5%). 
Clinical Response 
Among the 69 patients who received tisagenlecleucel, 41 patients (59.4%; 95% CI: 46.9, 71.1) 
achieved CR or CRi at month 6 without HSCT between the tisagenlecleucel infusion and the month 6 
response assessment. One patient (1.4%; 1/69) achieved CR or CRi and then proceeded to HSCT while 
in remission before the month 6 response assessment in the FAS. 
A Kaplan-Meier plot for OS (without censoring HSCT) is shown in Figure 2.

Assessor’s comments: 
Data for the paediatric population (< 18 years) were provided for ORR, DOR and EFS. All other 
parameters related to efficacy were only provided for the overall population such as RFS, OS and 
findings related to tumour burden which limits assessment according to age.

The age group of patients between 12-18 years and >18 years appears to show a lower estimated 
event-free probability in terms of EFS at 12 months compared to those <12 years. Values for 12-18 
years (46.7%, [95% CI: 15.0 – 73.7] n=10) and >18 years (60.2% [95% CI: 28.8, 81.3] n=17) 
compared to those <12 (76.9% [95% CI: 58.6, 87.9], n=42). However, the sample size for the two 
age groups >12 years is small with wide confidence intervals and should therefore be interpreted with 
caution. 
The estimated event-free probability for DOR was similarly lower in the group 12 -<18 years at 9 
months (66.7% [95% CI: 28.2, 87.8] n=10) and those >18 (66.1% [95% CI: 32.5, 85.8] n=17) 
compared to those <12 years (83.4% [95% CI: 64.3, 92.8] n=42). Again, the sample sizes are 
smaller for those 12 -<18 and >18 years.    
In the overall study population, patients with low and high tumour burden at baseline achieved a BOR 
at 28 days post-infusion of 96.2% (95% CI: 80.4, 99.9; n=26) and 77.5% (95% CI: 61.5, 89.2; n= 
40) respectively (Table 10). The data was presented for the overall population, and it was not possible 
to determine any differences for the lower age groups (<18 years).  
Cellular kinetics 
Tisagenlecleucel transgene levels in peripheral blood were determined by qPCR. The cellular kinetic 
parameters were estimated from the individual concentration versus time profiles using a non-
compartmental approach within the modelling program Phoenix® (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). 
Data observed in this study are consistent with the cellular kinetics and exposure results previously 
observed and reported in paediatric and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL in Study B2202. 
Cellular kinetics and exposure parameters (AUCs, Cmax, Tmax) from the study were summarized by 
response on Day 28 ± 4 days and by CRS grade. 
For patients with CR/CRi response (without confirmation) at Day 28 ± 4 days, the geometric mean 
(geometric CV) AUC0-28d was 352000 copies/µg x day (171.8%) and AUC0-84d was 
526000 copies/µg × day (182.0%). Geometric mean (geometric CV) Cmax was 34400 copies/µg 
(222.7%) and median Tmax for the tisagenlecleucel transgene was 9.9 days, which is consistent with 
that observed among responding pediatric patients with r/r B-cell ALL in previous studies. For the only 
patient with NR (without confirmation) at Day 28 ± 4 days, PK parameters were not evaluated. 
Transgenes were detected by qPCR in peripheral blood up to 379 days, i.e. maximum Tlast, among 
patients with CR/CRi response (without confirmation) at Day 28 ± 4 days. 
In general, patients presenting CRS showed a trend towards higher maximal expansion (Cmax) and 
exposure (AUC0-28d and AUC0-84d) relative to those without CRS. 
• 
• 
• 
For patients with maximum grade-1/2 CRS, the geometric mean (geometric CV) Cmax was 
31200 copies/µg (199.3%); maximum grade-3 CRS, 66600 copies/µg (299.9%); and 
maximum grade-4 CRS, 87900 copies/µg (84.9%). 
For patients with maximum grade-1/2 CRS, the geometric mean (geometric CV) AUC0-28d was 
37400 copies/µg × day (72.6%); maximum grade-3 CRS, 64300 copies/µg × day (272.8%); 
and maximum grade-4 CRS, 890000 copies/µg × day (119.1%). 
For patients with maximum grade-1/2 CRS, the geometric mean (geometric CV) AUC0-84d was 
536000 copies/µg × day (65.2%); maximum grade-3 CRS, 1720000 copies/µg × day 
(174.8%); and maximum grade-4 CRS, 1430000 copies/µg × day (125.1%).

Safety  
The study included 52 children (<18 years old) and 17 young adults. Safety data from the total 
population and from children separate is presented. The assessment for this procedure, focused on 
safety in the paediatric population (52 subjects) including 1 infant/toddler, 41 children, and 10 
adolescent patients. 
Most safety endpoints are analyzed for this study’s paediatrics as divided into patients younger than 12 
years (hereafter referred to as non-adolescents) and ≥ 12-years-old (hereafter referred to as 
adolescents). As the number of infants and toddlers was limited, this classification was combined with 
the children thereby forming the non-adolescent grouping.  
Safety results are based on completed treatment and follow-up of 42 non-adolescents and 10 
adolescents. 
All paediatrics had an initial diagnosis of B-cell ALL. At baseline, more than two-thirds had leukemia 
CNS-1 classification (33 non-adolescents, 78.6%; 8 adolescents, 80.0%) and less than one-third had 
extra-medullary involvement (5 non-adolescents, 11.9%; 3 adolescents, 30.0%).  
All paediatrics had received prior antineoplastic therapy. Of these 52, there were 11 paediatrics with 
prior exposure to blinatumomab and 5 paediatrics with prior inotuzumab therapy. 
The mean duration of follow-up of patients in the safety set was 8.7 months (range: 0.2 to 13.1); 
42.0% of patients were followed up for 6 to < 12 months, 29.0% were followed up for < 6 months and 
29.0% were followed up for ≥ 12 months.

19.0%). Nausea, vomiting, and cough were less frequent within the 8 weeks after infusion vs. any 
time post-infusion.  
The most frequent grade 3 AE was hypokalaemia, and most frequent grade 4 AE was CRS. 
Adolescents 
The most frequent AEs by primary SOC any time post CTL019 infusion in patients ≥ 12 and <18 years 
of age were immune system disorders (8 patients, 80.0%); blood and lymphatic system disorders (7

patients (20.0%). Nausea and nasopharyngitis were less frequent within the 8 weeks after infusion vs. 
thereafter, albeit the numbers of patients were limited.  
The most frequent grade-3 AEs was arthralgia, febrile neutropenia, and hypertension (2 patients/each, 
20.0%). The most frequent grade-4 AEs were CRS, neutrophil count decreased, and neutropenia (2 
patients/each, 20.0%). 
In the overall study population, there were 64 patients (92.8%) with AEs suspected to be related to 
tisagenlecleucel as assessed by the Investigator with onset any time post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. Of 
these 64, 21 patients (30.4%) presented maximum grade 3 and 25 patients (36.2%) presented 
maximum grade 4. The most frequent of this type of event was CRS. 
Assessor’s comments 
The number of children included in study B2001X (52 subjects) is small and only the most common 
AEs would be detected. Due to the limited number of adolescents (10 subjects) and imbalance in the 
number of patients within each subpopulation, it is difficult to assess any difference in AE profile 
between non-adolescent and adolescent group. 
The most important AEs like CRS, pyrexia, haematological AEs and hypogammaglobulinemia are 
frequently observed in the current study as earlier reported in study B2202, which is the basis for 
frequency data referred in the current product information.  
Grade 3 AEs were reported in 33.3% in the non-adolescent group and in 30.0% in the adolescent 
group, grade 4 AEs were reported in 50.0% and in 70.0% in the respective groups.  In non-
adolescents, the most frequent grade 3 AE was hypokalaemia (16.7%), and most frequent grade 4 AE 
was CRS (21.4%). In adolescents the most frequent grade 3 AEs was arthralgia (20.0%), febrile 
neutropenia (20%), and hypertension (20%), the most frequent grade 4 AEs were CRS (20.0%), 
neutrophil count decreased (20%), and neutropenia (20.0%).  
The mean duration of follow-up of patients in the safety set was 8.7 months (range: 0.2 to 13.1); 
42.0% of patients were followed up for 6 to < 12 months, 29.0% were followed up for < 6 months and 
29.0% were followed up for ≥ 12 months. As experienced in earlier studies, most AEs were reported 
first 8 weeks following infusion, indicating the observation time in the current study is sufficient for an 
overall picture of the safety profile in this patient group.  
In general, the AEs reported in the current study are comparable to what have been observed in Study 
B2202 including 79 children and adolescents. The data from the adolescent group in the current study 
is however too small for assessing the safety profile adequately. The MAH does not propose any 
updates of the safety part of the product information based on data from the current study.  
Paediatric patients are now included in several studies (i.e., B2001X, B2202, and B2205J), and the 
MAH should submit a Type-II variation to reflect the pooled safety data from these studies in section 
4.4 and 4.8 of the product information. 
Death and Serious AEs  
Deaths 
There were 9 deaths post-tisagenlecleucel infusion in the whole study population, 4 were non-
adolescents and 2 were adolescents.  
Three children died within ≤ 30 days of CTL019 infusion:

Patient (14 years of age at Screening) died on 11-Mar-2019 (Day 294) due to study indication. 
Patient (14 years of age at Screening) died on 05-Jan-2019 (Day 460) due to study indication. 
In addition, eight patients in the paediatric group died before any CTL019 infusion had started. 
Of these 6 paediatrics, 1 death was assessed as causally related to study drug by the Investigator:  
Patient– Death (Cytokine release syndrome, Tumour lysis syndrome), SAE (Allergic transfusion 
reaction, Cytokine release syndrome [2 occurrences], Tumour lysis syndrome) 
Patient details: 5 years, male, Asian 
The patient was diagnosed with ALL in Aug-2016; the most recent relapse/progression was on 09-Oct-
2018. No prior antineoplastic therapy was reported. 
Event description: 
On 01-Apr-2019, the patient received the CTL019 infusion (Day 1). 
On 02-Apr-2019 (Day 2), during the Post-Infusion Period, the patient had a body temperature between 
38 ºC and 39 ºC, and was diagnosed with a non-serious grade 1 AE of CRS. He was subsequently 
transferred to the ICU. On the same day, the patient’s ferritin level was 1981.8 ng/mL (normal range: 
0 to 279.9 ng/mL), and CRP was 2.4 mg/dL (normal range: 0 to 2 mg/dL). The event of CRS was 
treated with meropenem, teicoplanin, voriconazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and paracetamol. 
On 08-Apr-2019 (Day 8), the patient’s body temperature increased to 41 ºC, and he was tachycardic 
and hypertensive; and the non-serious event of CRS was upgraded to a grade 3 SAE. On the same day 
the patient’s CRP was 5.6 mg/dL, and ferritin was 1749.7 ng/mL. The event was further treated with 
tocilizumab, and methylprednisolone.  
On 13-Apr-2019 (Day 13), the patient was diagnosed with a grade 4 SAE of tumour lysis syndrome, 
which was treated with rasburicase and paracetamol. 
On 14-Apr-2019 (Day 14), the SAE of CRS progressed to grade 4, and was further treated with 
micafungin and phenylephrine. On the same day, a chest x-ray showed a decrease in the radiolucency 
of the right lung and exacerbation of pulmonary oedema. The patient underwent endotracheal 
intubation for CRS-related hypoxia. On 16-Apr-2019 (Day 16), the patient exhibited decreased kidney 
function and urine output, and hence underwent dialysis for CRS-related acute kidney injury. 
The patient died on 17-Apr-2019 (Day 17) due to CRS and tumour lysis syndrome secondary to ALL. 
No autopsy was performed.

The Investigator suspected a relationship between the investigational treatment and the events CRS 
and tumor lysis syndrome, the reason cited being that the events occurred after the CTL019 infusion. 
Serious Adverse Events 
The most frequent SAEs that occurred at any time post CTL019 infusion by PT were CRS (28 patients, 
40.6%), followed by pyrexia (11 patients, 15.9%); and recurrent ALL, herpes zoster, and sepsis, each 
of which occurred in 3 patients (4.3%). All remaining individual SAEs occurred in no more than 2 
patients (2.9%).  
The most frequent SAEs suspected to be related to CTL019 by PT were CRS (28 patients, 40.6%) and 
pyrexia (8 patients, 11.6%). All remaining individual SAEs suspected to be related to CTL019 occurred 
in no more than 2 patients (2.9%). 
The most frequent SAEs within 8 weeks post CTL019 infusion by PT were CRS (28 patients, 40.6%) 
and pyrexia (7 patients, 10.1%), while remaining individual SAEs occurred in no more than 2 patients 
(2.9%). 
The most frequent SAEs suspected to be related to CTL019 within 8 weeks post infusion by PT were 
CRS (28 patients, 40.6%) and pyrexia (5 patients, 7.2%). All remaining individual SAEs suspected to 
be related to CTL019 occurred in no more than 2 patients (2.9%). 
Assessor’s comments 
Among the 6 deaths occurring post-infusion in children, one death (5 years old) associated with 
Cytokine release syndrome and Tumour lysis syndrome was assessed as causally related to study drug 
by the Investigator. The case was treated according to the CRS management algorithm.  
No specific pattern of AEs contributing to fatal outcome can be identified based on the current study. 
The MAH does not propose any updates of the product information based on data from the study 
B2001X. 
Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) 
CRS was reported in 71.1% (37) of pediatrics, maximum grade 3 and 4 was observed in 34.6% (18 
pediatrics). The corresponding numbers in the non-adolescent group were 71.4% (30 subjects) and 
35.7% (15 subjects) grade 3 and 4, and in the adolescents group 70.0% (7 subjects) and 30.0% (3 
subjects) grade 3 and 4.  
Median duration of CRS was 7 days 
•  42.2% of patients with CRS were admitted to the ICU (19 out of 45) for the treatment of CRS.   
•  Median duration of the ICU stay was 8 days 
Systemic anti-cytokine therapy was administered to 42.2% of patients with CRS resulting in CRS 
improvement or resolution. Further, tocilizumab was administered to 37.8% of patients and by 
quantity: 1 dose (20.0%), 2 doses (11.1%), 3 doses (2.2%), and 4 doses (4.4%). Siltuximab was 
administered to 4.4% of patients and corticosteroids to 8.9% of patients. 
Serious neurological adverse reactions 
There were few AEs of confusional state, encephalopathy, seizures, delirium, and tremor in paediatric 
patients, all of which occurred within 8 weeks post-infusion. Seizure presented in 5 non-adolescents 
(11.9%), tremor in 3 non-adolescents (7.1%) and 1 adolescent (10.0%), confusional state and

delirium presented in 2 non-adolescents (4.8%, each), and encephalopathy presented in 1 non-
adolescent (2.4%). 
For patients by maximum severity grade, grade-3/4 events presented only as grade-3 seizure (2 non-
adolescents, 4.8%), grade-3 confusional state or grade-3 encephalopathy (1 non-adolescent/each, 
2.4%). 
Infections 
Non-adolescents: Overall, events of infections and infestations SOC with onset any time post-
tisagenlecleucel infusion presented in 27 non-adolescents (64.3%), with 8 patients (19.0%) having 
maximum grade-3 events and 1 patient (2.4%) having maximum grade-4 event. The most frequent of 
each category by frequency: URTI (non-adolescents: 7 patients, 16.7%); and by maximum severity: 
pneumonia (grade 3: 3 patients, 7.1%), and sepsis (grade 4: 1 patient, 2.4%). 
Adolescents: Overall, events of this SOC with onset any time post-infusion presented in 7 adolescents 
(70.0%), with 4 patients (40.0%) having maximum grade-3 events and 1 patient (10.0%) having 
maximum grade-4 event. The most frequent of each category by frequency: nasopharyngitis 
(adolescents: 3 patients, 30.0%); and by maximum severity: atypical pneumonia, bacterial infection, 
device-related infection, herpes zoster, sepsis, or systemic infection (grade 3: 1 patient/each, 10.0%); 
and sepsis (grade 4: 1 patient, 10.0%). 
The majority of AEs occurred within 8 weeks after infusion, i.e. no further substantial increase in 
reporting rate when onset was any time post-infusion, for both non-adolescents and adolescents. 
Tumor lysis syndrome 
The 1 case (1.4%) presenting grade-4 tumor lysis syndrome within 8 weeks after infusion had fatal 
outcome and is described above. 
Prolonged depletion of normal B-cells/agammaglobulinemia 
The PT of hypogammaglobulinemia with onset any time post-tisagenlecleucel infusion presented in 16 
non-adolescents (38.1%), with 2 patients (4.8%) having maximum grade-3 events and no patient 
having maximum grade-4 event. 
The PT of hypogammaglobulinemia with onset any time post-infusion presented in 3 adolescents 
(30.0%) with no patient presenting a grade 3/4 event.  
The majority of AEs occurred within 8 weeks after infusion, i.e., no further substantial increase in 
reporting rate when onset was any time post-infusion, for both non-adolescents and adolescents. 
Haematological disorders including cytopenias 
There were few AEs of febrile neutropenia, anaemia, WBC decreased, and platelet count decreased in 
paediatric patients. All within 8 weeks post-infusion, febrile neutropenia (2 non-adolescents, 4.8%; 2 
adolescents, 20.0%), anaemia and WBC decreased (10 non-adolescents/each, 23.8%; 1 
adolescent/each, 10.0%), or platelet count decreased (6 non-adolescents, 14.3%; 1 adolescent, 
10.0%). 
For patients by maximum severity grade, grade-3/4 events presented only as grade-3 febrile 
neutropenia (2 non-adolescents, 4.8%, 2 adolescents, 20.0%), grade-3 anaemia (5 non-adolescents, 
11.9%; 1 adolescent, 10.0%), grade-3 WBC decreased (3 non-adolescents, 7.1%), grade-3 platelet 
count decreased (2 non-adolescents, 4.8%), grade-4 WBC decreased (5 non-adolescents, 11.9%; 1 
adolescent, 10.0%), or grade-4 platelet count decreased (2 non-adolescents, 4.8%; 1 adolescent,

When onset was anytime post-infusion, there was onset of 1 event each in an additional patient: in 
non-adolescents, febrile neutropenia, grade-3 anaemia, grade-4 WBC decreased, and platelet count 
decreased; and in adolescents, WBC decreased. 
Clinical laboratory abnormalities 
Data are presented for the whole study population and no specific safety issues have been highlighted 
for the paediatric population. 
MAH conclusion on safety 
Treatment is associated with significant toxicity in the initial 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion, 
especially in patients with high disease burden; however, AEs can be managed with the application of 
specific protocol-mandated algorithms/guidelines at centres with appropriate training in 
tisagenlecleucel safety management. 
• 
The majority of patients develop CRS. Key elements of this protocol-mandated algorithm 
include an improved CRS grading scale and the administration of anti-cytokine therapy. 
Cytokine release syndrome is limited to the first 8 weeks post-infusion. 
•  Neurological events are transient, can be associated with CRS, and typically occur within the 
initial 30 days post-tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
•  Other AEs are well characterized and are manageable with supportive care. 
• 
Patients with pre-existing and prolonged neutropenia post-tisagenlecleucel infusion may be at 
increased risk for severe or fatal infections. 
Of the 9 post-infusion deaths during study B2001X, 4 were non-adolescents and 2 were adolescents. 
Of these 6 paediatrics, 5 were due to study indication. The remaining case (1.4%), i.e., AE with fatal 
outcome, that was not attributed to the underlying disease (primary reason for death outcome was 
multi organ failure syndrome) was in a child. 
Immunogenicity 
Humoral immunogenicity assessments were performed for the measurement of antibodies binding to 
murine CAR19 (for simplicity named here anti-mCAR19 antibodies) in human serum. Cellular 
immunogenicity measures the presence of CAR19-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells against 
tisagenlecleucel. 
Humoral Immunogenicity 
The humoral immunogenicity assessment included evaluation of pre-existing (pre-treatment) and post-
treatment anti-tisagenlecleucel antibodies to examine the incidence of immunogenicity with treatment, 
as a secondary endpoint. A validated assay was used to determine presence of anti-mouse CAR19 (m-
CAR19) antibodies in serum of patients who received tisagenlecleucel treatment. Antibodies binding to 
tisagenlecleucel (anti-mCAR19) in human serum were measured using a flow cytometry method. Anti-
mCAR19 antibodies in human serum samples were captured by Jurkat cells transfected to express 
murine CAR19. Untransfected cells were used as reference. The method measures bound IgG/M on 
viable cells. Subjects were counted as positive if they had one or more positive sample post Baseline, 
otherwise negative if they had at least one negative sample post Baseline and otherwise unknown.

Humoral immunogenicity interpretation data are presented overall for the SAF in Table 13. The 
majority of patients were humoral-immunogenicity reactive at Baseline (89.9%; 62/69), while 94.2% 
(65/69) were positive at any time point post-infusion. Humoral immunogenicity data summarized by 
Day 28 response and time point showed that pre-existing anti-mCAR19 antibodies were detected in 
similar proportion of patients as those who achieved a BOR of CR/Cri, which is consistent with that 
previously observed in pediatric r/r ALL patients in study B2202.

* Summary at any time post-baseline also includes unscheduled assessments. Subjects are counted as positive if 
they have one or more positive samples post-baseline, otherwise negative if they have at least one negative sample 
post baseline and otherwise unknown. 
Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the SAF (N). 
A strip plot of anti-mCAR19 antibodies by time points is shown in Figure 3. Median mean fluorescent 
intensity signals were observed to be similar at different time points, (i.e. enrollment, Day 14, Day 28,

Assessor’s comments: 
Humoral immunogenicity data is only provided for the safety population as a whole. It is therefore not 
possible to distinguish data from the different age groups in the paediatric population. Although the 
majority of participants had pre-existing antibody responses, the frequency of antibody responses in 
the study population was reduced over time and it is not clear from Table 13 if there were differences 
according to age, for example if all patients <18 years were seropositive, and whether any of those 
seronegative at baseline did seroconvert. In addition, no indication is provided as to whether any of 
the antibody responses may be neutralizing. Thus, the MAH is recommended to discuss this data when 
the Bioanalysis reports are submitted (Q4 2021).  
Cellular immunogenicity results 
Activation of T-cells in PBMC collected from patients in response to mCAR19-derived peptides was used 
to assess the cellular immunogenicity against tisagenlecleucel. T-cell activation was measured by the 
percentage of interferon gamma (IFNγ)-positive cells detected by intracellular staining and subsequent 
flow cytometric analysis. Net responses (in %) were calculated for two non-overlapping mCAR19 
peptide pools (i.e. Pool 1 and Pool 2), which together span the full mCAR19 protein sequence. Cellular 
immunogenicity assessment included the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells specific to mCART 
peptides and were measured pre-dose (Enrollment) and up to 12 months post-tisagenlecleucel dose. 
Cellular responses were consistent over time for all patients with mean values < 0.5% at any time 
point, demonstrating that cellular immunogenicity does not fluctuate over time.  
Assessor’s comment: 
Strip plots in the CSR were shown for CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells for each pool separately. Although both 
pools together span the entire mCAR19 protein sequence, further information of the difference 
between these pools would have been useful since there was slightly greater spread in responses for

pool 2 for CD3+CD4+ cells. This should be discussed in the Bioanalysis report due to be submitted Q4

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The complete data set of the clinical study B2001X submitted and reviewed under this Article 46 
procedure is not part of a PIP but includes participants <26 years (and one participant aged 33 years). 
A total of 52 participants in the FAS population were <18 years (75%). Study treatment and follow-up 
was completed for 47.6% (20/42) of the patients <12 years of age and for 50% (5/10) of those 12-
<18 years of age. The main reasons for discontinuation was progressive disease and lack of efficacy in 
patients <12 years.  
Efficacy: 
Study B2001X enrolled comparable patient populations with r/r B-cell ALL and had a similar study 
design as the pivotal study B2202 and the key supportive study B2205J. However, the main purpose 
for the conductance of this study was to further evaluate the safety of tisagenlecleucel for up to one 
year post-infusion. Assessment of efficacy was therefore only defined as secondary endpoints in this 
study and the follow-up was rather limited. Data for the efficacy endpoints ORR, DOR and EFS have 
been provided for the paediatric population (<12 years and 12-<18 years). However, the remaining 
efficacy parameters for other relevant secondary endpoints were only provided based on the overall 
population which limits the assessment in this group. 
In line with the definition of ORR in study B2205J, ORR was measured within 6 months after 
tisagenlecleucel administration in study B2001X, but within 3 months in the pivotal study B2202. The 
ORR reported in the final analysis of study B2001X in the FAS of 69 patients was 82.6% (57/69; 95% 
CI: 71.6, 90.7). Among the responding patients, 56.5% (39/69) achieved a CR, while 26.1% (18/69) 
obtained a CRi. The findings relating to ORR for the paediatric age groups in study B2001X were 
similar to that of the overall population and to the efficacy results reported earlier for study B2202, but 
slightly higher than observed in study B2205J. The proportion of infused patients who achieved a best 
response of CR was similar in the three clinical studies (62% in B2202 and 59.4% in B2205J), while a 
slightly lower proportion in study B2205J obtained a best response of CRi (i.e. 10.9% vs. 26.1% in 
B2001X and 20.3% in B2202). The proportion of patients who achieved CR or CRi and then proceeded 
to HSCT while in remission within the first 6 months post-infusion was lower (1.4%) in study B2001X 
than in the two other clinical studies (i.e. 8% in both B2202 and B2205J). 
The median DOR for the overall population was not reached in any of the three clinical studies. The 
median follow-up in study B2001X from onset of response was 8.9 months. In line with the results 
from the latest interim analysis reported for study B2202, the median EFS and OS was not reached at 
the data cut-off (DCO) for the final analysis of study B2001X. Nevertheless, the estimated event-free 
probability for the overall population was comparable to that reported in the two other clinical studies 
at month 6 (76% vs. 71% in B2202 and 67% in B2205J) and slightly higher at month 12 (67% vs. 
56% in B2202 and 54% in B2205J). Moreover, the estimated probability of survival from infusion in 
the infused patient population was similar to the two other clinical studies at month 6 (94% vs. 89% in 
B2202 and 84% in B2205J), but somewhat higher at month 12 (88% vs. 76% in B2202 and 65% in 
B2205J).   
The age group of patients between 12-18 and >18 years in study B2001X appears to show a lower 
estimated event-free probability in terms of DOR and EFS at 9 and 12 months respectively, compared 
to those <12 years. However, the sample size for the two age groups >12 years is small with wide 
confidence intervals and should therefore be interpreted with caution. Data for the age group 18-<25 
years was not tabulated. The MAH has provided upon request data according to each age subgroup as 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

well as for the overall study population (i.e. <12 years; 12-<18 years, >18 years, Overall) for the 
clinical studies conducted in r/r ALL patients (i.e. B2001X, B2202, and B2205J). They concluded in 
their assessment of this data that there is no need to revise the current product information for the 
paediatric population for the approved ALL indication. However, in contrast to the clinical studies 
B2202 and B2205J, study B2001X permitted inclusion of individuals below 3 years of age, and 
individuals that who had experienced prior anti-CD19-directed therapy (i.e., blinatomumab). Three 
participants below the age of three years were enrolled in study B2001X rendering the following 
statement in section 4.2 of the SmPC as factually incorrect “Paediatric population; B-cell ALL: No 
formal studies have been performed in paediatric patients below the age of three years”. Since B2001X 
is a formal clinical study, the wording will need to be amended to reflect the current experience with 
Kymriah in this paediatric patient group to “There is limited experience with Kymriah in paediatric 
patients below the age of 3 years”. Furthermore, this will need to be reconsidered when data from the 
required PAMs to the MA concerning r/r ALL patients have been completed. 
The MAH has provided data regarding the median time for tisagenlecleucel production which was 
omitted from the main text of the CSR. The current SmPC section 4.2, states that manufacture and 
release of Kymriah usually takes about 3-4 weeks. However, the time interval from enrolment to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion in study B2001X was found to be variable with a median of 64 days and 
maximum time of 219 days. 
In contrast to the pivotal study B2202 and study B2205J, patients in study B2001X who were 
previously treated with blinatumomab when CD19 tumor expression was demonstrated (via flow 
cytometry) at screening were eligible for participation. The MAH has provided data from the 15 
patients enrolled in study B2001X who were previously treated with blinatumomab prior to study entry, 
based on analysis from a DCO of 04-Nov-2019 whilst the DCO for the last patient last visit for study 
B2001X was 13-Oct-2020. There was a consistent trend in most parameters towards sub-optimal 
outcomes in patients that received prior blinatumomab compared to those patients who had not 
previously been treated with blinatumomab. On the other hand, duration of response appeared similar 
in patients previously treated with blinatomumab. However, these findings should be interpreted with 
caution due the small cohort size, the broad confidence intervals, and because such patients may have 
had more advanced/aggressive disease. Nevertheless, the current statement in the SmPC section 4.4 
“There is limited experience with Kymriah in patients exposed to prior CD19-directed therapy” should 
be expanded to include the following statement “While some activity of tisagenlecleucel has been 
observed, data are currently too limited to make an adequate assessment of the benefit-risk profile in 
these patients.” Furthermore, revision of this statement should be reconsidered when additional data 
becomes available from the agreed non-interventional PAES B2401. 
In general, the efficacy results from the final analysis of study B2001X (FAS) are considered to support 
the data underlying the approved indication for Kymriah in r/r ALL patients.  
Cellular kinetics: 
Characterisation of the cellular kinetics was a secondary endpoint in the B2001x study. Overall, the 
observed cellular kinetics was comparable to previous results from studies B2202 and B2205J.  
Increasing Cmax, AUC0-28d and AUC0-84d were associated with higher grade CRS, which is in line with 
previous findings in B2202 and B2205J trials.  
Safety 
Evaluation of the safety of CTL019 therapy was the primary endpoint of study B2001X, in which a total 
of 52 paediatric patients <18 years of age was included; 42 non-adolescents (<12 years of age) and 
10 adolescents (12-<18 years of age). 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/617616/2021  
Page 37/54 
 
 
 
The mean duration of follow-up of patients in the safety set was 8.7 months (range: 0.2 to 13.1); 
42.0% of patients were followed up for 6 to < 12 months, 29.0% were followed up for < 6 months and 
29.0% were followed up for ≥ 12 months. As experienced in earlier studies, most AEs were reported 
first 8 weeks following infusion, indicating the observation time in the current study is sufficient for an 
overall picture of common AEs in this patient group. 
Due to the limited number of adolescents (10 subjects) and imbalance in the number of patients within 
each subpopulation, it is difficult to assess any difference in AE profile between non-adolescent and 
adolescent group, and the data from the adolescent group is too small for assessing the safety profile 
adequately. 
In general, the AEs reported in the current study are comparable to what have been observed in earlier 
studies in ALL patients (Study B2202, and study B2205J). The most important AEs like CRS, pyrexia, 
haematological AEs and hypogammaglobulinemia were frequently observed in the current study in line 
with what has earlier been reported in study B2202, which is the reference to ADR frequency data in 
the current product information. Grade 3 AEs were reported in 33.3% in non-adolescent group and in 
30.0% in the adolescent group, grade 4 AEs were reported in 50.0% and in 70.0% in the respective 
groups in study B2001X.  
The majority of patients reported CRS limited to the first 8 weeks post-infusion. The reactions were 
adequately managed with treatment according to the management algorithm. However, CRS was a 
contributing factor in fatal outcome in a 5-year-old child. 
Neurological events were observed. The MAH has provided an overview of time to onset, duration, 
management and relationship to possible concomitant CRS.  
Most frequent infections were URTIs and nasopharyngitis, while pneumonia was the most commonly 
occurring severe infection. Most infections were seen first 8 weeks post-infusion.  
The review of fatal cases did not identify a definitive pattern as most patients had underlying 
contributing comorbidities and complications associated with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. Of 
interest is the one case (a 5-year-old) reporting CRS and tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), the one case 
(9 year old) reporting CRS, Febrile neutropenia, Hyponatraemia, Infection and the one case (3 years 
old) reporting Seizure, Central nervous system infection, Pneumonia and Multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome. Only the case with CRS and TLS were suspected related to the study drug by the 
investigator. 
Overall, it can be concluded that the pattern of AEs reported in study B2001X are comparable to AEs 
reported in children with ALL in earlier clinical studies. The data from the adolescent group in the 
current study is however too small for assessing the safety profile adequately.  
The MAH does not propose any updates of the safety and efficacy parts of the product information 
based on data from the current study. However, paediatric patients are now included in several studies 
(i.e., B2001X, B2202, and B2205J), while the product information refers to safety data from the pivotal 
study B2202 only and efficacy data are reported from the two clinical studies B2202 and B2205J. 
Regarding safety, the MAH should submit a type II variation to reflect pooled data for the three clinical 
studies B2001X, B2205J and B2202 in the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8 concerning the paediatric and 
young adult ALL population.

3.  Request for Supplementary Information 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  The MAH is requested to provide information on the time interval from screening to enrolment 
(defined as the point at which the patient met all clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria and their 
leukapheresis product was accepted for manufacturing), and from enrolment to infusion with 
tisagenlecleucel. 
2.  Neurological events were observed. However, time to onset, duration and how they were 
treated is not described. The MAH is requested to provide an overview of time to onset, 
duration, management and relationship to possible concomitant CRS. 
3.  The MAH should review the data of the 15 patients enrolled in study B2001X who were 
previously treated with blinatumomab and discuss whether section 4.4. of the SmPC should be 
updated accordingly 
4.  The MAH should review all available data concerning safety and efficacy in paediatric patients 
with r/r ALL and provide a summary assessment, which shows that there is currently no need 
for revision of the product information regarding the approved ALL indication. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.  
4.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1 
The MAH is requested to provide information on the time interval from screening to enrolment (defined 
as the point at which the patient met all clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria and their leukapheresis 
product was accepted for manufacturing), and from enrolment to infusion with tisagenlecleucel. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The time interval from screening to enrolment and from enrolment to tisagenlecleucel infusion 
for patients enrolled in study B2001X is presented in Table 14.

Table 14: Time since screening and enrolment to CTL019 infusion (Safety set) 
Source: [t1_ema_b2001x:Table 1] 
Of note, the time interval from screening to enrolment in study B2001X (median:10.0 days) 
encompassed the provision of cryopreserved apheresis material by the study site, and the subsequent 
acceptance for manufacturing by Novartis; this might have included a number of apheresis attempts 
for some patients. The time interval from study enrolment to tisagenlecleucel infusion (median: 64 
days) was similarly variable, since it encompassed a number of Novartis- and study site-based 
activities, including the scheduling of manufacturing and the manufacturing period itself, and the 
delivery of the final manufactured product back to the study site. Once the final product was received 
by the study site, the study subject underwent additional protocol-mandated activities, such as disease 
restaging and lymphodepletion therapy, prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The requested data has been provided. It is acknowledged that this could be due to multiple apheresis 
attempts before cells were considered suitable for manufacturing. The time interval from enrolment to 
tisagenlecleucel infusion was similarly variable with a median of 64 days and maximum time of 219 
days.  
According to the CSR, tisagenlecleucel was released to the study, provided all required safety and 
quality release specifications were met. It is therefore anticipated that all tisagenlecleucel infusions fell 
within the required specifications. However, it is not clear whether for some participants, the product 
did not fall within the required specifications, and that apheresis and subsequent manufacturing had to 
be repeated. However, this will not be pursued further in this procedure since it will be addressed in 
one of the PAMs that the MAH has committed to conduct as part of the MA (agreed Annex II condition). 
Issue clarified and will not be pursued further in this procedure.

Neurological events were observed. However, time to onset, duration and how they were treated is not 
described. The MAH is requested to provide an overview of time to onset, duration, management and 
relationship to possible concomitant CRS. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
A total of 22 events of serious neurological adverse reactions (SNARs), including both nonserious and 
serious AEs, were reported in 18 patients (26.1%) post-tisagenlecleucel infusion (Table 15).  In 17 
(24.6%) patients these SNARs occurred within the initial 8 weeks post-tisagenlecleucel infusion with 
Grade 3 and Grade 4 SNARs occurring in 6 (8.7%) and 1 (1.4%) patients, respectively. There were no 
fatal SNARs. The most frequent MedDRA PTs reported (≥ 5%) were seizure (6 patients; 8.7%) and 
tremor (4; 5.8%). 
Time to onset 
The median time to onset of the first SNAR was 9.0 days (range: 2 to 121).

Sources: [t4_ema_b2001x], [t5_ema_b2001x] 
Duration 
The majority of events of SNARs (17 out of 22; 77.3%) were resolved as of the data cut-off date. The 
Kaplan-Meier estimated probability of SNARs having completely resolved was 55.6% (95% CI [36.2, 
76.8]) at Day 7 and 72.2% [51.9, 89.4] from Day 28 onwards. 
Management 
The majority of the tisagenlecleucel-related SNARs were treated by concomitant medication  
Relation to episodes of CRS 
Of the 22 total events of SNARs reported, 3 (13.6%) occurred in patients who did not develop CRS at 
any time point during the study. One event of SNARs (4.5%) occurred prior to the onset of CRS and 
during CRS. Ten events occurred after the onset of CRS, six of which (27.3%) resolved prior to 
resolution of CRS and four (18.2%) after resolution of CRS. Eight events (36.4%) occurred after CRS 
had already resolved. 
Overall, it appears that the onset of events of SNARs typically occurred either during the course of CRS 
or after the resolution of CRS. However, SNARs starting prior to the onset of CRS and SNARs not in 
conjunction with CRS were also observed (Table 16).

The data provided is based on study B2001X, including 69 patients, of which 42 are <12 years of age, 
10 are 12 - <18 years of age and 17 are ≥18 years of age.  
Time to onset 
Time to onset in all patients was median 9 days (range 2 to 121), but median time to onset varied 
from 8 days in the group <12 years to 20 days in the group 12-<18 years. 
Duration 
At time of data cut-off 77.3% of serious neurological AE were resolved. The duration has been given by 
probability estimates. It is estimated that 55.6% (36.2-76.8) are resolved by day 7 post-infusion, 
66.7% (46.4-85.6) are resolved by day 14, 72.2% (51.9-89.4) by day 28 and 85.2% (64.6-97.0) by 
day 91. This means that among ca 75% of patients the serious neurological AEs did not last beyond 
four weeks. 
Management 
The majority of the tisagenlecleucel-related SNARs were treated by concomitant medication, no further 
description. 
Serious neurological AEs in relation to episodes of CRS 
Neurological AEs were seen both during the CRS episode (27.3%), during and after resolution of CRS 
(18.2%) and after resolution of CRS (36.4%). Even in 13.6% neurological events were seen without 
episodes of CRS. The numbers are small in each category and no specific trend can be concluded. 
Data currently given in section 4.4 concerning median time to onset and median time to resolution is 
based on study B2202. It can be agreed that new data from study B2001X are more or less similar to 
what was reported for study B2202. However, the duration of neurological AEs seems to be longer in 
study B2001X than in study B2202 (median time to resolution 8 days). It would be preferred that data 
in SmPC reflects the overall experience in paediatric B-cell ALL based on data from all studies (B2001X, 
B2205J and B2205).  
In conclusion 
The MAH should submit a Type-II variation to reflect pooled data on neurological AEs in paediatric B-
cell ALL studies in SmPC section 4.4, see also Q 4. 
Question 3 
The MAH should review the data of the 15 patients enrolled in study B2001X who were previously 
treated with blinatumomab and discuss whether section 4.4. of the SmPC should be updated 
accordingly. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The inclusion of certain patients not studied during study B2202 was allowed in study B2001X. This is 
the case for patients with prior blinatumomab exposure. Fifteen patients with prior blinatumomab 
exposure were enrolled in study B2001X. Outcomes for these patients were previously presented 
(Krueger et al 2020). Out of a total of 67 patients included in the FAS who at the DCO for the interim 
publication analysis completed 3 months of follow up or prematurely discontinued study B2001X, 15 
patients had received blinatumomab prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. The efficacy of tisagenlecleucel 
in this population is summarized in Table 17 below.

Table 17: Efficacy Summary (Krueger et al. 2020) 
a 3 patients with no CR/CRi, 5 early progression, 2 deaths precluding disease evaluation 
Although outcomes in patients with prior blinatumomab tend to be numerically lower than those for the 
overall population, these results should be interpreted with caution due to a number of reasons, 
including small cohort size, short follow-up (median follow-up from infusion to DCO: 9.6 months 
[range, 0.2-16.5 months] in Krueger et al 2020), and potential confounding factors. For example, 
patients with prior blinatumomab had more previous lines of treatment than the overall population 
(median of 3 versus 2, respectively), and more patients in the prior blinatumomab cohort had previous 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation than those in the overall population (87% versus 61%, 
respectively) (Krueger et al 2020). In addition, patients might have simply required treatment with 
blinatumomab as a means to control aggressive disease (such as chemotherapy-refractory ALL), which 
can be associated with worse outcomes. Due to these limitations and consequent unfeasibility to 
clearly interpret these limited data, Novartis is of the opinion that an update of the SmPC is not 
warranted. Notably, currently the product information states that “there is limited experience with 
Kymriah in patients exposed to prior CD19-directed therapy”, this statement remains accurate and 
appropriate. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The Krueger et al. reference (https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.10518 ) is an 
abstract published in May 2020, that does not appear to have been included in the dossier. The 
efficacy summary provided in Krueger et al. 2020 for study B2001X is based on data from a DCO of 
04-Nov-2019; whilst the DCO for the last patient last visit for study B2001X was 13-Oct-2020. The 
data presented in Krueger et al. 2020 therefore do not correspond to the complete and final data 
analysis of study B2001X. 
The data for overall survival (OS) at 12 months was presented in the abstract but not listed in Table 2-
4. The median OS at 12 months for all patients (n=67) was 83% (95% CI: 69-72), whereas for 
patients who had received prior blinatumomab (n=15) the median OS was 53% (95% CI:19-78) and 
91% (95% CI: 74-97) for patients with no prior blinatumomab exposure (n=50). There was therefore 
a consistent trend in the majority of parameters towards sub-optimal outcomes in patients that had 
received prior blinatumomab. While it is agreed that the cohort size is small, the confidence intervals 
are broad and such patients may have had more advanced/aggressive disease where the results 
should be interpreted with caution, duration of response was similar between the groups. The wording 
of the SmPC section 4.4 should be modified to reflect the current experience by adding the following 
“while some activity of tisanglecleucel has been observed, data are currently too limited to make an 
adequate assessment of the benefit-risk profile in these patients” to the current statement.

Furthermore, revision of this statement should be reconsidered when additional data becomes 
available from one of the agreed PAES which is ongoing (i.e., the non-interventional study B2401). 
Issue not resolved but will not be pursued further in this procedure. However, the required 
changes to the SmPC should be implemented at the time the required type II variation is 
submitted. 
Question 4 
The MAH should review all available data concerning safety and efficacy in paediatric patients with r/r 
ALL and provide a summary assessment, which shows that there is currently no need for revision of 
the product information regarding the approved ALL indication. 
Summary of MAH’s response 
Safety data 
Overall, the AE profile by SOC and PT of the respective three age groups and the overall study 
population was similar across all three studies (Table 18 and Table 19).

Key efficacy and safety results across 212 patients (171 pediatric patients) from three studies in r/r 
ALL did not indicate clinically meaningful differences between the respective age groups across the 
studies, or when comparing the age groups to the overall study population within each individual 
studies. For safety, the results are similar between the three age groups in each individual study, with 
no trend observed.  
Summary of efficacy data 
In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric patients 
with r/r ALL, data from three studies in pediatric r/r ALL are provided in this response. Novartis has 
conducted additional age-wise analysis to supplement already reported clinical study data. The age 
subgroups are < 12 years (non-adolescents); 12 - < 18 years (adolescents), ≥ 18 years. 
Overall response rate 
The ORR (CR+CRi) was consistently high in all three age groups across the studies. The ORR was 
similar among the three studies: ranging between 70.3% and 82.6% (Table 20). Response rates were 
similar across all age subgroups in all three studies. Although the > 18 years subgroup response rate 
was numerically lower in all three studies, due to the low sample size and wide confidence intervals, it 
is difficult to draw any conclusions about potential efficacy differences based on age.

RSI_Jun21_1.1.b] 
In Studies B2202 and B2205J, nearly all patients who achieved BOR of CR or CRi also achieved bone 
marrow MRD negative remission: 43/45 in study B2205J and 64/65 in study B2202. In Study B2001X, 
bone marrow MRD evaluation was missing for a larger proportion of patients as compared to the other 
two trials. However, available data show that most of responding patients did achieve bone marrow 
MRD negative remission. MRD evaluations were performed by local assessment in Study B2001X, while 
it was performed by central evaluations in Studies B2202 and B2205J. 
Duration of remission 
Median duration of remission was not reached in Studies B2202 and B2205J (Study B2202- Section 
11.1.3.11, and Study B2205J-Section 11.2.3). For B2001X, median estimate was 14.4 months, 
however it should be considered with caution as majority of patients were censored before 12 months.

Comparing DOR between the pediatric age subgroups, there was no noticeable trend differentiating 
patients < 12 years old vs. 12 to < 18 years old. The improvement in DOR for patients < 12 years old 
observed in study B2001X was not observed in studies B2205J and B2202 (Table 21). 
When comparing patients > 18 years old to the pediatric population, it is seen that the > 18 years 
subgroup had numerically lower DOR at 9 months in all three studies. However, due to the low sample 
size and wide confidence intervals, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about potential efficacy 
differences for patients > 18 years old.

Event-free survival 
A similar proportion of pediatric patients across the three studies experienced treatment failure, 
relapse, or death due to any cause after remission. These values were similar to those of the overall 
population in the individual studies. (Table 22).

When comparing patients > 18 years old to pediatric population, it was seen that the > 18 years 
subgroup had numerically lower EFS at 12 months in all three studies. However, due to the low sample 
size and wide confidence intervals, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about potential efficacy 
differences for patients > 18 years old.

Survival rate was similar in the pediatric age groups in all three studies, and consistent with the overall 
population (Table 23).

subgroup had numerically worse survival at 12 months in all three studies. However, due to the low 
sample size and wide confidence intervals, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about potential efficacy 
differences for patients > 18 years old.

Overall efficacy conclusions 
Key efficacy and safety results across 212 patients (171 pediatric patients) from three studies in r/r 
ALL did not indicate clinically meaningful differences between the respective age groups across the 
studies, or when comparing the age groups to the overall study population within each individual 
studies. For efficacy, there was no clear trend observed based on age within the pediatric population 
(patients < 18 years old). Although a trend towards reduced efficacy in the patients over 18 years old 
was observed in all three studies, this should be interpreted with caution due to the low sample size 
and the fact that confidence intervals were overlapping. Historically it has been observed that 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/617616/2021  
Page 50/54 
 
 
 
 
adolescents and young adults have worse prognosis with ALL, which may be due to the difference in 
the disease biology or host factors. This difference in underlying disease characteristics could explain 
the trend in efficacy outcomes, however given the lack of statistical significance, no conclusion can be 
made. 
In view of these results, Novartis is not of the opinion that there is a need to update the current data 
presented in the product information for the pediatric population in the approved ALL indication. 
Assessment of MAH’s response 
Safety data 
The MAH has presented safety data in ALL patients separately for the three studies (Study B2001X, 
B2205J and B2202). The MAH states that “Overall the AE profile by SOC and PT of the respective three 
age groups and the overall study population was similar across all three studies.”, and concludes that 
“In view of these results, Novartis is not of the opinion that there is a need to update the current data 
presented in the product information for the paediatric population in the approved ALL indication.” 
In the current SmPC section 4.8 it is stated that for the B-cell ALL population “The adverse reactions 
described in this section were characterised in 79 patients infused with Kymriah in the multi-centre, 
pivotal clinical study B2202.” Also, the data given in SmPC section 4.4 concerning time to onset and 
duration of AEs in the paediatric ALL population is based on study B2202 (see Q 2). 
According to SmPC guidelines, section 4.8 “Safety data from several studies should be pooled to 
increase the precision of adverse reaction rates as appropriate without introducing bias (e.g. major 
difference in population characteristics or exposure to the product).” 
The complete information on AEs in the paediatric and young adult ALL population in section 4.4 and 
4.8 should be revised by referring to “studies in paediatric and young adult B-cell ALL patients,”, e.g. 
frequencies, time to onset and duration based on the pooled data from all three studies B2001X, 
B2205J and B2202.  
In conclusion on safety data 
The MAH should submit a type II variation to reflect pooled data for the three studies B2001X, B2205J 
and B2202 in SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8 concerning the paediatric and young adult ALL population.  
Efficacy data 
Summary data has been provided according to age group for the three clinical studies as requested.  
It is agreed that the efficacy findings are in general similar between the different studies. However, 
event-free survival appears more sustained in children < 12 years in study B2001X at 12 months 
compared to the same age group in the two clinical studies B2202 and B2205J. Similarly, DOR at 9 
months was greater for children <12 years in study B2001X compared to the same age group in the 
B2202 and B2205J studies. The observations of lower efficacy in patients >18 years is acknowledged, 
however, the focus of the evaluation for this procedure are patients <18 years of age. 
According to the SmPC guideline, ‘the results of all pharmacodynamic (clinically relevant) or efficacy 
studies conducted in children should be presented’. Furthermore, it states that ‘the information should 
be updated when new relevant information becomes available’ and ‘the results should also be 
presented by age or relevant subsets.’ The MAH has, upon request, now provided information 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/617616/2021  
Page 51/54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
according to age from an additional clinical study. However, including this data may be delayed until 
further information is available for the paediatric population as discussed below. 
Study B2001X included participants <3 years of age, in addition to those that had received prior 
blinatumomab. Such participants were excluded from study B2202. As a result, there were no data on 
the benefit-risk profile in the youngest ALL patients less than 3 years of age at the time of the initial 
MA of Kymriah and the SmPC therefore currently states under special populations regarding the B-cell 
ALL indication that “no formal studies have been carried out in paediatric patients below the age of 
three years”. In the B2001X study, three participants were <3 years of age at screening where the 
youngest was a 10-month-old female. Since B2001X is a formal study, the SmPC should be revised to 
state: “There is limited experience with Kymriah in paediatric patients below the age of 3 years.”   
Since children with r/r ALL less than 3 years old were excluded from the pivotal study B2202, the MAH 
agreed to conduct a post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) to fulfil one of the required PAMs to the 
MA (ANX 006; Category 1) in order to characterize the efficacy and safety of Kymriah in ALL patients 
below the age of 3 years. This data will be derived from paediatric r/r ALL patients treated with 
tisagenlecleucel participating in the non-interventional registry study B2401. The final study results 
from this study are expected in December 2023. The SmPC should therefore be updated when the 
agreed PAES B2401 in ANX 006 is fulfilled. 
Issue clarified. However, Section 4.2 of the SmPC should reflect the current experience with 
Kymriah in children below 3 years of age, since B2001X is a formal study. This should be 
implemented at the time the requested type II variation is submitted.  Furthermore, the 
SmPC should be updated as and when more information on the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel 
in paediatric patients with r/r ALL becomes available based on completion of the respective 
required PAMs to the MA concerning r/r ALL patients. 
5.  MS comments on the CAT Rapporteur’s Preliminary 
responses assessment report  
Comments to the CAT Rapporteur’s preliminary responses assessment report dated 23-Sep-2021 were 
received from one member state.  
The recommendation to update section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC with the pooled safety data was 
supported.  
Regarding data in paediatric patients less than 3 years of age, the current statement in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC “No formal studies have been performed in paediatric patients below 3 years of age” is no 
longer considered correct since B2001X is a formal study, and 3 patients less than 3 years were 
included in this study. Consideration should therefore be given as to whether this is acceptable or 
whether data on these patients should be requested to amend the statement to reflect the current 
experience.  
Regarding data in blinatumomab-experienced patients, the uncertainties were acknowledged, however, 
the available data could also be considered reassuring since patients pre-exposed to blinatumomab 
could still respond to tisagenlecleucel. Further, although efficacy appears to be lower in patients pre-
exposed to blinatumomab, which may be driven by a somewhat lower response rate (DoR is the 
same), this might be due to differences in disease characteristics but could also be a chance finding 
given the very low sample size.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/617616/2021  
Page 52/54 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, the Member State proposes to expand the statement on prior treatment with anti-CD19-
directed therapy in section 4.4 of the current SmPC and indicate that While activity of tisanglecleucel 
has been observed, data are currently too limited to make an adequate assessment of the benefit-risk 
profile in these patients.  
6. Overall conclusion and recommendation 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the MAH has submitted the final study 
results from the complete data set of study B2001X. The study is a phase IIIb open-label, multicentre, 
single-arm study designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in paediatric 
and young adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL after the closure of enrolment to the pivotal study B2202. 
The evidence of efficacy for the approved ALL indication was primarily based on data from the pivotal 
study B2202 at the time of initial MA. In addition, the final results from the complete data set of study 
B2205J have provided supportive evidence for the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in r/r B-cell ALL patients. 
The efficacy results from the final analysis of study B2001X are considered to support the results from 
the two clinical studies B2202 and B2205J, underlying the approved indication of Kymriah in r/r ALL 
patients.  
Overall, it can be concluded that the pattern of AEs reported in study B2001X is comparable to AEs 
reported in children with ALL in earlier studies. The data from the adolescent group in the current 
study is however too small for assessing the safety profile adequately. The MAH does not propose any 
updates of the safety or efficacy parts of the product information based on data from the current 
study. However, paediatric patients are now included in several studies (i.e. B2001X, B2202, and 
B2205J), while the product information refers to safety data from the pivotal study B2202 only and 
efficacy data from the two clinical studies B2202 and B2205J. The MAH should therefore submit a 
Type-II variation to reflect the pooled safety data in paediatric patients with r/r ALL from the three 
clinical studies B2001X, B2202, and B2205J in the SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8. 
The data provided according to age subgroups and for the overall population on efficacy in paediatric 
and young adult patients with r/r ALL has been provided.  However, the following revisions to sections 
4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC regarding efficacy should be implemented: 
SmPC section 4.2 “Paediatric population: B-cell ALL: No formal studies have been performed in 
paediatric patients below the age of three years”.  
Should be modified to: 
SmPC section 4.2 “Paediatric population: B-cell ALL “‘There is limited experience with Kymriah in 
paediatric patients below the age of 3 years”.  
SmPC section 4.4 “There is limited experience with Kymriah in patients exposed to prior CD19-directed 
therapy”  
should be expanded to: 
SmPC section 4.4 “There is limited experience with Kymriah in patients exposed to prior CD19-directed 
therapy. While activity of tisanglecleucel has been observed, data are currently too limited to make an 
adequate assessment of the benefit-risk profile in these patients” 
Both of these statements will need to be reconsidered as information in the paediatric population 
becomes available when the required PAMs to the MA concerning r/r ALL patients have been 
completed.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/617616/2021  
Page 53/54 
 
 
 
 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Kymriah remains positive for the treatment of paediatric and young 
adult patients up to and including 25 years of age with B-cell ALL that is refractory, in relapse post-
transplant or in second or later relapse. 
  Fulfilled: 
  Not fulfilled: 
The procedure is concluded. However, the MAH should submit an application for a variation to update 
section 4.4. and 4.8 of the SmPC with the pooled safety data in paediatric and young adult patients 
with r/r B-cell ALL from the three clinical studies B2001X, B2202, and B2205J. At this time, the 
requested changes to the SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4 regarding current experience with Kymriah in 
patients below the age of 3 years and those previously exposed to blinatomumab should be made.

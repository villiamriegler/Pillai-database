2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant has applied for the following indication: Regular treatment of asthma in adults and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older where use of a combination of long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) 
and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) is appropriate: - patients not adequately controlled with inhaled 
corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists, or - patients not adequately 
controlled with long-acting beta2-agonists and low dose of inhaled corticosteroids. This includes 
patients with mild to severe asthma not adequately controlled by the Global Initiative for Asthma 
(GINA) treatment step 2 or 3.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways associated with airways inflammation and 
hyper-responsiveness.  
Asthma is a common disease affecting an estimated 340 million people worldwide. The prevalence of 
asthma is increasing in industrialised and developing countries and the number of persons with asthma 
is estimated to reach 400 million by the year 2025. The Global Asthma Report estimates that 23.7 
million disability-adjusted life years are lost annually due to asthma, representing 1% of the total 
global burden. The prevalence in Europe is up to 10%.  
It is estimated in Europe that 17% of patients have difficult to treat asthma and 3-4% have severe 
asthma (GINA). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Asthma is a heterogenous disease with different underlying disease processes, different phenotypes 
(recognizable clusters of demographics, clinical and pathophysiological characteristics). The most 
recently identified phenotypes are allergic asthma, non-allergic asthma, late onset (adult onset) 
asthma, asthma with persistent airflow limitation and asthma with obesity.  
The pathophysiology of asthma is characterised by inflammation and intermittent obstruction of the 
airways and bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Inflammation in asthma generally involves the same cells 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 11/147 
 
 
 
involved in the allergic response in the nasal passages and skin, (atopy) and includes mast cells, 
eosinophils and Th2 lymphocytes.   
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Asthma is a heterogenous disease usually characterised by chronic inflammation. It is defined by the 
history of respiratory symptoms - wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough that vary 
over time and in intensity, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation. These variations are 
often triggered by factors such as exercise, allergen or irritant exposure, changing weather or viral 
respiratory infections. Symptoms occur particularly at night or in the early morning. Symptoms (and 
airflow limitations) may resolve spontaneously or in response to medication and in cases may be 
absent for a period of time (weeks or months at a time). Patients may experience sudden 
exacerbations that may be life threatening, carrying a significant burden to the individual and the 
community. Asthma is usually associated with airway hyperresponsiveness to direct and indirect 
stimuli, and with chronic airway inflammation. These features persist even when symptoms are absent, 
or lung function is normal but may normalise with treatment. 
Diagnosis is based on two key features: 
• 
• 
A history of variable respiratory symptom; 
variable expiratory airflow limitation and reversibility. 
Patient scan be classified as mild, moderate and severe based on symptom control and treatment 
requirements. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The long-term treatment goals are symptom control and risk reduction. Symptom control aims to have 
only occasional daytime symptoms without sleep disturbance or exercise limitation. Risk reduction 
involves preventing exacerbations, preserving lung function and avoiding asthma deaths.  
The pharmacological options for long – term treatment of asthma fall into three categories: 
•  Controller medications [these are used to reduce airway inflammation, control symptoms, reduce 
future risk (exacerbations, decline in lung function] which should be initiated as soon as possible; 
•  Reliever (rescue) medications; 
•  Add- on therapies for patients with severe asthma. 
Low dose ICS provides most of the clinical benefits for most of patients with asthma. However, ICS 
responsiveness varies between patients. Some patients will require medium dose ICS if their asthma 
remains uncontrolled, despite good adherence and inhaler usage technique. 
In clinical practice, the choice of medication, device and dose should be based for each individual 
patient on assessment of symptom control, risk factor, patients’ preferences and practical issues (e.g. 
cost, ability to use the device, and adherence).  
The stepwise approach to asthma treatment is widely use (Figure 1).  
Patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance low dose ICS and ‘as needed’ short-acting beta2-
agonists  or  LABA  (GINA  step  2  and  3)  have  the  following  treatment  options  in  addition  to  optimising 
treatment compliance and modifying risk factors; 
•  Combination low dose LABA/ICS with as needed short acting beta2-agonists; 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 12/147 
 
 
 
•  Combination low dose formoterol/ICS maintenance and reliever. 
Figure 1: Stepwise approach to asthma therapy 
Recommended clinical practice in the treatment of asthma is to start at the lowest dose of medication 
and escalate to the mid- and high doses, as needed. After asthma control is achieved, 
recommendations are to step back to the lowest dose available, which can maintain symptom stability. 
The step down should be considered when asthma symptoms have been well controlled and lung 
function has been stable for 3 or more months. If the patient has risk factors for exacerbations the 
past year or persistent airflow limitation, the step down should be closely supervised. 
About the product 
BroPair Spiromax multi-dose powder inhaler (also referred as ‘FS MDPI’) is an inhalation-driven multi-
dose dry powder device containing a blend of fluticasone propionate (Fp), an ICS and salmeterol 
xinafoate (Sx), a LABA as actives substances.  
Fp given by oral inhalation at recommended doses has a glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory action within 
the lungs, resulting in reduced symptoms and exacerbations of asthma, with less adverse effects than 
when corticosteroids are administered systemically.  
Sx is a selective LABA with a long side chain which binds to the exosite of the receptor. Salmeterol 
produces a longer duration of bronchodilation, lasting for at least 12 hours, than recommended doses 
of conventional short acting ß2 agonists. Salmeterol provides symptomatic relief, by reducing the 
bronchoconstriction.  
The applicant initially seek approval for FS MDPI, at nominal doses of 50/12.5 (low), 100/12.5 (mid), 
and 200/12.5 (high) mcg bid, for the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in 
patients aged 12 years and older.  
Claimed Indications and recommendation for use  
BroPair Spiromax is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product 
(inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist) is appropriate: 
- patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-acting 
β2 agonist, or  
- patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist. 
Proposed posology: 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 13/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
One inhalation of 14 micrograms salmeterol and 55 micrograms fluticasone propionate or one 
inhalation of 14 micrograms salmeterol and 113 micrograms fluticasone propionate or one inhalation of 
14 micrograms salmeterol and 232 micrograms fluticasone propionate twice daily. 
The same posology is proposed for adults and adolescents 12 years and older. 
Once control of asthma is achieved, treatment should be reviewed, and consideration given as to 
whether patients should be stepped down to BroPair Spiromax containing a lower dose of the inhaled 
corticosteroid and then ultimately to an inhaled corticosteroid alone. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The Applicant has developed BroPair Spiromax to allow treatment of the entire spectrum of asthma 
patients for whom combination therapy is appropriate. The FS MDPI contains the same active 
ingredients (in lower amounts) as Seretide Accuhaler, which is marketed throughout Europe, and 
Advair Diskus, which is marketed throughout the US. The FS MDPI is marketed in both the US and 
Canada, with low-, mid-, and high-dose. 
The Applicant considered that Advair Diskus and the EU equivalent product (Seretide Accuhaler) can be 
considered clinically the same based on their comparability. The comparability is also supported by 
their performance profiles in vitro. The in vitro profile of an Advair Diskus batch used in the clinical 
study (FSS-AS-305) fell within the profile for marketed batches of Seretide Accuhaler, indicating that 
Advair Diskus was a good representative for Seretide Accuhaler and specific clinical trials with Seretide 
Accuhaler were therefore not considered necessary by the applicant.  
The FS MDPI delivers drug to the airways as a fine powder without the use of propellants. As an 
inhalation-driven device, FS MDPI eliminates the need for coordination of actuation and inspiration. The 
active ingredients are dispersed in a lactose monohydrate excipient and contained within a reservoir. A 
metered dose of drug is delivered to a dose cup via an air pulse-activated mechanism when the cap is 
opened. 
The Applicant has developed a formulation containing drug and carrier particles of appropriate particle 
sizes that take advantage of the cyclone de-agglomerator; allowing  for formulation drug 
concentrations in the FS MDPI to be significantly lower than those in Advair Diskus or Seretide 
Accuhaler, while achieving similar (or lower) systemic exposure and comparable clinical benefits. This 
novel, inhalation-driven MDPI device, does not require patient coordination of device actuation with 
inhalation, and has been used in the current programme with the goal of reducing administration 
errors associated with conventional metered dose inhalers (MDIs). 
Despite the availability of combination products containing Fp and salmeterol for a number of years, 
the applicant considered that reducing the systemic exposure of salmeterol could potentially reduce the 
side effects due to this LABA while maintaining comparable efficacy, and thus developed BroPair 
Spiromax in a novel device at lower doses to offer an alternative option for some patients who are 
unable to tolerate the currently available products.  
Regulatory History and Discussions with Health Authorities 
The Applicant received National Scientific Advices from the Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency (MHRA, United Kingdom) and from the Medicinal Products Agency (MPA, Sweden), 
which covered the following topics related to clinical development: 
•  Both agencies agreed that the US-sourced comparators can be considered comparable, and 
they can provide relative efficacy and safety information for the EU application. Both agencies 
agreed that the programme conducted could be suitable. The MHRA commented it would be

important to demonstrate clearly that the lower doses administered with the Teva products 
(compared with the doses administered in the same fixed-dose combinations already available 
on the market) do not lessen the effect with respect to efficacy. The MPA commented that 
uncertainty with regard to dose potency relative to existing products on the market was of 
concern, so it would be valuable to at least have available in vitro data comparing the different 
strengths. 
•  Acceptability of the 6-month duration of Study FSS-AS-305 in adolescents and adults aged 12 
years of age and older with asthma to assess long-term safety: Both agencies considered the 
duration could be adequate. 
•  Adequacy of the sample size of patients aged 12-17 years studied in the clinical programme to 
support use in adolescents in the EU (13-17 years): MPA commented that the data provided for 
adolescents would not be sufficient for a stand-alone assessment, but extrapolation of adult 
data would be accepted unless there were any specific concerns identified. MHRA commented 
that the number of adolescent patients is lower than would be considered ideal but could be 
adequate depending on the results. 
•  Acceptability of extrapolation of data from paediatric patients to the adolescent population, if 
necessary: MHRA agreed that extrapolation from data generated in children 12 years of age 
and younger to the adolescent population could be possible. 
The Applicant did not mention the Scientific Advice received by CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/3754/1/2018/II, 22 
February 2018), which raised some issues with respect to a part of the proposed indications and the 
need for evidence about which dose levels for approved products, the doses proposed with FS MDPI 
correspond to (please see sections 1.1 Submission of the dossier and 2.5.3 Discussion on Clinical 
Efficacy of this report). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product BroPair Spiromax, also referred to as FS MDPI or as drug product, is presented as 
inhalation powder containing salmeterol xinafoate 12.75 micrograms in combination with fluticasone 
propionate in two different strengths: 100 or 202 micrograms. 
The only other ingredient is lactose monohydrate. 
Each delivered dose (the dose from the mouthpiece) contains 12.75 micrograms of salmeterol (as 
salmeterol xinafoate) and 100 or 202 micrograms of fluticasone propionate. 
Each metered dose contains 14 micrograms of salmeterol (as salmeterol xinafoate) and 113, or 
232 micrograms of fluticasone propionate. 
The product is available in a white inhaler with a semi-transparent yellow mouthpiece cover. The parts 
of the inhaler coming into contact with the inhalation powder or the patient mucosa are made of 
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP). Each inhaler contains 
60 doses and is foil-wrapped with desiccant, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance fluticasone propionate 
General information

The chemical names of fluticasone propionate are androsta-1, 4-diene-17-carbothioic acid,6,9-difluoro- 
1-hydroxy-16-methyl-3-oxo-17-(1- oxopropoxy)- (6α,11β,16α,17α)-S-(fluoromethyl) ester, S-
Fluoromethyl 6α, 9-difluoro-11β,17-dihydroxy-16α-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17β- 
carbothioate,17-propionate, (6α, 11β, 16α, 17α)- 6,9-difluoro-11-hydroxy-16- methyl-3-oxo-17-(1-
oxopropoxy)androsta-1,4- diene-17-carbothioic-acid,S-(fluoromethyl) ester and 6α, 9-difluoro-17-
{(fluoromethyl)sulphanyl}carbonyl}-11β-hydroxy-16α-methyl-3- oxoandrosta-1,4-dien-17α-yl 
propanoate corresponding to the molecular formula C25H31F3O5S. It has a relative molecular mass of 
500.6 g/mol and the following structure in Figure 2: 
Figure 2: fluticasone propionate structure 
The active substance is a white or almost white powder, non-hygroscopic and practically insoluble in 
water. It has multiple chiral centres but one single enantiomer, as shown in Figure 2 is obtained from 
the synthetic route and controlled in the specification via optical rotation. 
During the procedure, in response to a major objection (MO), fluticasone propionate polymorphism has 
been discussed. Fluticasone propionate exhibits polymorphism with two known forms; Form I and Form 
II. The therapeutically relevant form is routinely produced by the CEP holder. The other form has only 
been obtained under supercritical fluid extraction techniques. The polymorphic forms of fluticasone 
propionate have been investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC) and infrared (IR) tests, confirming that only desired form is present in the active substance. In 
response to the same MO, it has been demonstrated that morphology, crystallinity, specific surface 
area and morphic form are consistent also during the stability studies performed on the micronised 
active substance. Routine monitoring of morphic form is not required. 
As there is a monograph of fluticasone propionate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer 
of the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia 
(CEP) for fluticasone propionate which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation 
Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Only one site is involved in the manufacture and micronisation of the active substance. Information on 
the micronisation process and validation was provided during the procedure in response to a major 
objection (MO). In response to the same MO, it was demonstrated that the controls employed for the 
validated crystallisation and micronisation procedures ensure consistent quality of the micronised 
active substance, as controlled in the active substance specification, which consequently results in 
consistent finished product performance.

The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene bags placed in a fibre drum. After micronisation, 
the  active  substance  is  stored  in  double  polyethylene  bags  placed  inside  an  aluminium  foil  liner.  The 
polyethylene bags comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification, includes tests for: appearance (visual), identity (IR), specific optical 
rotation (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), microbiological examination of non-sterile products (Ph. Eur.) and particle size distribution 
(laser diffraction). 
The  specification  tests  include  all the  monograph  tests  with  the  addition  particle  size  distribution  and 
residual  solvents  and  microbiological  examination,  which  is  required  for  active  substances  used  for 
inhalation route. The test for acetone described in the monograph is replaced by test for residual solvents 
by gas chromatography. The specification of the finished product manufacturer is fully in line with the 
specification of the active substance manufacturer. The finished product manufacturer has adopted the 
analytical methods for particle size distribution and residual solvents used by the CEP holder. All other 
analytical methods are as per Ph. Eur. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and 
non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used has been presented.  
Batch analysis data from five production scale batches were provided, demonstrating compliance with 
the proposed specifications. The batch data provided are considered to be sufficient. Consistency and 
uniformity of the active substance quality have been demonstrated.  
Stability 
As no re-test period is proposed in the CEP, stability data from three commercial scale batches of active 
substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the container stated in the CEP for up to 60 months 
under  long  term  conditions  (25°C  ±  2°C,  60%  ±  5%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions (40°C ± 2°C, 75% ± 5% RH)   according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The tested 
parameters were within the specifications. Additional data form three commercial scale batches of the 
micronised  active  substance  stored  in  the  proposed  container  used  after  micronisation  for  up  to  48 
months under long term conditions (25°C ± 2°C, 60% ± 5% RH) were provided.  These batches were 
tested for particle size distribution only. The tested parameter was within the specifications.  
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently  stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  retest  period  of  60  months  when  stored  in  the 
packaging  stated  in  the  CEP  as  proposed  by  the  active  substance  manufacturer  and  of  24  months 
proposed by the finished product manufacturer.

relative molecular mass of 603.74 g/mol and the following structure in Figure 3: 
Figure 3: salmeterol xinafoate structure 
The active substance is a white or almost white powder and is sparingly soluble in water. As stated in 
literature, salmeterol xinafoate is the racemic form of 1-hydroxy-2-naphtoic acid salt of salmeterol. 
During the procedure, in response to a MO, salmeterol xinafoate polymorphism has been discussed.  
Salmeterol xinafoate exhibits polymorphism with two known forms; Form I and Form II. The 
therapeutically relevant form is routinely produced by the CEP holder. The other form has only been 
obtained under supercritical fluid extraction techniques. The polymorphic forms of salmeterol xinafoate 
have been investigated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and 
infrared (IR) tests, confirming that only desired form is present in the active substance. In response to 
the same MO, it has been demonstrated that morphology, crystallinity, specific surface area and 
morphic form are consistent also during the stability studies performed on the micronised active 
substance. Routine monitoring of morphic form is not required. As there is a monograph of salmeterol 
xinafoate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active substance has been granted 
a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for salmeterol xinafoate which has 
been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Only one site is involved in the manufacture and micronisation of the active substance. Information on 
the micronisation process and validation was provided during the procedure in response to a MO. In 
response to the same MO, it was demonstrated that the   demonstrating that the controls employed for 
the validated crystallisation and micronisation procedures ensure consistent quality of micronised 
active substance, controlled in the active substance specification, which consequently results in 
consistent finished product performance.  
The micronised active substance is packaged in double polyethylene bags placed inside an aluminium 
foil pouch with a desiccant. The foil pouch is placed inside a high-density polyethylene container. The 
polyethylene bags comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identity (IR), related 
substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC), microbiological examination of non sterile products (Ph. Eur.) and particle size distribution 
(laser diffraction). 
The specification tests include all the monograph tests with the addition of residual solvents, particle 
size distribution and microbiological examination, which is required for active substances used for

inhalation route. Although the CEP includes the test for palladium, the applicant has adequately 
justified its omission from the specification during the procedure.  
The finished product manufacturer has adopted the analytical methods for particle size distribution and 
residual solvents used by the CEP holder. All other analytical methods are Ph. Eur. The analytical 
methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
has been presented.  
Batch analysis data from three production scale batches are provided, demonstrating compliance with 
the proposed specifications. Consistency and uniformity of the active substance quality have been 
demonstrated.  
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of non-micronised active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25°C ± 2°C, 60% ± 5% RH) and 
for up to 6 months at accelerated conditions (40°C ± 2°C, 75% ± 5% RH), and stability data from three 
commercial scale batches of micronised active substance for up to 60 months under long term conditions 
(25°C ± 2°C, 60% ± 5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
These  batches  were  tested  for  appearance,  water,  impurities  and  assay.  Data  on  particle  size  was 
provided for 2 of the three batches stored at long term conditions for 24 months. The tested parameters 
were within the specifications.  
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently  stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  by  the  active  substance 
manufacturer of 60 months stored in the proposed packaging as stated in the CEP. 
2.2.4.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder (FS MDPI) is a blend of fluticasone propionate and 
salmeterol xinafoate as the active pharmaceutical ingredients, and lactose monohydrate as a carrier.  
An overage is introduced to account for the active substance loss during the finished product 
manufacturing process; adequate justification has been provided during the procedure. The target fill 
weight includes an overfill to ensure delivery of the label claim number of actuations (60).  
The inhalation powder is a blend of the two active substances, fluticasone propionate (FP) and 
salmeterol xinafoate (SX) with lactose. Coarse lactose carries the micronised active substances 
particles on its surface up to the moment of inhalation, when the active substances de-aggregate and 
detach from the surface of the carrier. The fine lactose stearate modulates particle-particle interaction 
and therefore improves the de-aggregation/re-suspension of the active substances’ particles in the 
inspired air flow during inhalation.  
Lactose is a well-known pharmaceutical ingredient used for this route of administration and 
pharmaceutical form and its quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC 
and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.

The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop lower strength alternatives to the already 
marketed long acting beta agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) combinations achieving, 
the same efficacy as marketed inhalation powders using a lower strength of both active substances. 
Initially three strengths were developed (55/14 mcg, 113/14 mcg and 232/14 mcg); however only the 
two higher strengths are proposed for marketing. The lower strength has been used to generate some 
stability data which are of relevance for the two strengths proposed for marketing. Teva has already 
experience in the development of inhalation powders in the EU market using the same delivery device 
(e.g. DuoResp Spiromax EMEA/H/C/002348); in fact Aerivio Spiromax (EMEA/H/C/002752), which now 
is withdrawn, contained the same active substances as the proposed product at a higher strength and 
used the same delivery device. 
Different batches of FP and SX with a range of particle size distribution (PSD) have been used in 
finished product development and evaluated for impact on blend uniformity (BU), dose content 
uniformity and aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD). During development, lactose batches 
with a range of PSD focusing on the percentage of fine lactose (particulate below 10 micrograms) have 
been evaluated. Two optimised grades of lactose, Grade 4 and Grade 5 were selected for the 
manufacture of FS MDPI 232/14 and 113/14, respectively. The selection of the grades was based on 
the effect of fine lactose on the aerodynamic performance and the need to achieve proportionality 
between the various strengths of FS MDPI. The choice of the lactose grades has been fully justified. 
To address a MO, in addition to particle size, particle shape, rugosity and amorphous content of both 
active substances and excipient have been discussed in detail as these are critical material attributes 
that may influence the homogeneity, reproducibility and the performance and quality of the finished 
product for use via the inhalation route. It was concluded that PSD of the active substances and 
lactose is the only parameter that needs to be controlled as consistency of the other characteristics is 
ensured by the validated manufacturing methods of the components of the finished product. 
The formulation and manufacturing development have been described in detail, from pilot scale to the 
commercial scale. The development programme was divided into two phases: development of a range 
of FS MDPI product strengths for a Phase 2b ranging clinical study to establish the appropriate doses 
for different asthma severities in placebo-controlled studies and development of a range of FS MDPI 
product strengths for Phase 3 efficacy and long-term safety clinical studies. The manufacturing process 
consists of blending the micronised active substances with the lactose, filling and equilibrating the 
devices, packaging and labelling of the devices. A design of experiments (DoE) was used to evaluate 
the main effects of the blending process parameters (i.e. impeller speed and mixing time) and material 
attributes on the blend uniformity and pharmaceutical performance. Product development and 
optimisation was continued with FS MDPI 50/12.5, 100/12.5 and 200/12.5 products. The formulation 
strategy was finalised for the Phase 3 clinical and registration programs such that all strengths were 
developed using the same delivery device, with each strength requiring its own blend.  Comparison 
data between the FS MPDI and the products used in used in phase 3 clinical trials have been provided 
confirming that the product performance is equivalent.  
The  delivery  device  is  a  breath  actuated  multidose  reservoir  dry  powder  inhaler,  hence  the  finished 
product and the device are considered to constitute an integral “drug device combination product”. The 
inhaler is a white with a translucent yellow mouthpiece cover. Each inhaler consists of the following main 
components:  upper  case  assembly,  bellows  and  yoke  assembly,  filter,  and  lower  case  assembly  as 
depicted in Figure 4 below. The parts of the inhaler coming into contact with the inhalation powder or 
the  patient  mucosa  are  made  of  acrylonitrile  butadiene  styrene  (ABS),  polyethylene  (PE),  and 
polypropylene (PP). The contact material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product. The same device is used for all strengths. Each inhaler contains 60 doses and is wrapped in 
a 4-ply foil laminate with desiccant to protect the products from moisture over long-term storage. The

same variant (NB7/3) of the device and the same secondary packaging have been used throughout the 
development  of  the  product;  the  cup  size  used  to  measure  the  dose  was  optimised  and  fixed  at  the 
beginning of the development. 
Figure 4: FS MDPI device components 
The finished product characterisation studies were conducted in accordance with EMA guideline 
“Guidance on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal products” (CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 
Corr, June 2006). To assess the pharmaceutical performance of the FS MDPI product strengths, a 
bracketing approach for the middle strength was proposed.  However, since the composition of the 
three strengths is not dose proportional and the blends are different, a MO on the acceptability of the 
bracketing approach used during pharmaceutical development, was raised requesting the missing in 
vitro data on the middle strength. This part of the MO was resolved by performing a flow rate study. It 
was demonstrated that the evaluated patient flow rates have no notable impact on the pharmaceutical 
performance of the product; it was concluded that the bracketing approach was acceptable. The 
finished product characterisation studies to determine that appropriate storage conditions, facilitate 
correct use and maintenance of the inhaler, and contribute to patient compliance were originally 
conducted applying the delivered dose testing regime described by the US FDA Draft Guidance for 
Industry Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) and Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) Drug Products (1998) (one 
delivered dose is measured at the beginning, middle and end of inhaler life and is referred to as Dose 
Content Uniformity through life (DCU-TL)). To validate the data generated using this approach, a 
comprehensive study bridging the adopted testing regime to the one described by Ph. Eur. (3 
beginning, 4 middle and 3 end of inhaler life) in the uniformity of delivered dose (UDD) as required 
described in the Ph. Eur. has been conducted. Based on this study it was concluded that the 
differences in the test regime do not impact on data generated, as the DCU results are statistically 
comparable to the UDD results. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 4 main stages: blending, filling, device assembly, packaging. 
The process is typical for manufacturing of inhalation powders, which are normally considered

specialised pharmaceutical forms and their manufacture is considered to be a non-standard process. 
Controls are applied to critical steps of the manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing process as well as in-process controls performed have been sufficiently described. 
In-process controls have been identified and are considered adequate. 
The holding times of each step, including the equilibration step, have been adequately justified. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated during process validation at commercial 
scale  on  three  batches  per  strength  for  each  site.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance  and  description  of  the  inhaler,  dose  counter  and  of  the  powder  (visual  inspection), 
identification  (UPLC  and  TLC),  assay  (content  per  inhaler  UPLC),  related  substances  (UPLC),  water 
content  (Karl  Fischer),  net  content  (fill  weight),  uniformity  of  delivered  dose  (Ph.  Eur.),  number  of 
actuations per inhaler, dose counter reading (at actuation 58), APSD (next generation impactor (NGI) 
Ph. Eur.), microbiological examination for non-sterile products (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed finished product specification contains the required tests for this dosage form and it is in 
line with the “Guidance on the Pharmaceutical Quality of Inhalation and Nasal products” 
(CHMP/QWP/49313/2005 Corr, June 2006) and the “Preparations for Inhalation” Ph. Eur. monograph. 
The limits for impurities and degradation products at release and during shelf-life are in agreement 
with ICH Q3B. The limit for assay has been tightened to 90-105 % during the procedure in line with 
batch and stability data. The applicant is recommended to monitor the first 20 commercial batches of 
the finished product for assay and eventually to tighten the specifications limits further (see 
Recommendation). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 
3 batches of the highest dose, which represent the worst-case scenario, using a validated ICP-MS 
method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 
30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be 
concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed, in response to a MO, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional 
control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for twelve commercial scale batches per strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
The applicant proposes a shelf-life of 18 months and of 2 months after opening the foil with certain 
precautions for storage. 
Stability data from 9 commercial scale batches of  development strength (low, middle and high) of the 
finished product stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH),  for up to 
12 months under intermediate conditions (40 ºC / 60% RH), and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary and secondary 
(protective film foil with desiccant) packaging proposed for marketing. The inhalers were stored in the 
upright and inverted position. 
The in-use stability studies were conducted over a period of 3 months on the low and high strength 
(bracketing approach) of the batches used for the long term stability study, to assess the product 
performance, after being dispensed to the patients outside the protective film foil and kept under 
intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 60% RH) for up to two months. The inhalers were stored in the 
horizontal position. 
Samples were tested in line with the shelf-life specification given. The analytical procedures used are 
stability indicating.  
No significant changes were observed in the long term, accelerated studies and in-use studies and all 
results were within the proposed specification limits. 
Of note the impact of moisture was also investigated during development studies on the un-pouched 
inhalers under low, medium and high humidity (25°C/less than 30% RH, 25°C/60% RH and 25°C/75% 
RH, respectively) on three batches of the low and high strength (bracketing approach). The effect of 
moisture was assessed by testing inhalers for DCU, DCU-TL, APSD and water content. The results of 
the study demonstrate that different levels of moisture exposure have no impact on the 
pharmaceutical performance of both product strengths.  
No photostability stability studies were performed due to the nature of the container closure system. 
Since the DPI excludes light, this is accepted. 
The applicant had initially proposed different shelf-lives for different strengths, but this was not 
accepted. Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 18 months and of 2 months after

2.2.5.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
In response to three major objections raised one for each active substance and one of the finished 
product development on the characterisation of the finished product components, the applicant has 
supplemented the submission with additional information on the physico-chemical characteristics of the 
active substance which could have an impact on the aerodynamic performance of the product. In 
response to the same MO raised for the finished product the bracketing approach used during the 
development has been adequately justified. The risk of nitrosamine contamination was also evaluated 
to address a MO and no risk was identified. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.   
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was one minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on 
the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, resulting in the recommendation to monitor the first 20 
commercial batches of the finished product for assay and eventually to tighten the specifications limits 
further was agreed. 
2.2.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.7.  Recommendation for future quality development   
3.2.P.5 - The applicant is recommended to monitor the first 20 commercial batches of the finished 
product for assay and eventually to tighten the specifications limits further, if supported by data. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) and salmeterol xinafoate (Sx) have been used via inhalation alone and 
together for treatment of upper respiratory diseases for several years. The pharmacological and 
toxicological aspects of the respective individual and combined products have been well characterised 
and extensively reviewed.  
Fluticasone propionate is a potent fluorinated glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory activity that is 
commonly used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. It has been marketed in the EU for many years 
and has been shown to reduce symptoms and exacerbations of asthma and to decrease airway 
reactivity to histamine and methacholine in patients with hyperreactive airways. It is a well-established 
active substance and is recommended for use in the management of asthma in both adults and 
adolescents.  
Salmeterol xinafoate is a long-acting β-agonist bronchodilator that exerts a preferential effect on β2-
adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle to produce relaxation and bronchodilation that lasts

EMA/141972/2021

for 12 hours after a single dose. It is used via the orally inhaled route in the management of patients 
with reversible airways obstruction associated with mild to moderate asthma and is particularly useful 
in patients with reversible airways obstruction who continue to experience symptoms despite 
treatment with an anti-inflammatory agent such as an inhaled corticosteroid.  
The fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FS) combination is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma 
where use of a combination product (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist) is appropriate: 
in patients no adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short acting 
β2-agonist or in patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting 
β2-agonist. FS fixed-dose combination products have been marketed in the EU for over 20 years in dry 
powder inhalation formulation.  
Taking into account available information from published pharmaco-toxicological literature on Fp and 
Sx and on their use in combination which sufficiently demonstrated the safety and the efficacy of those 
active substances, no new non-clinical studies were conducted by the applicant to directly support this 
application. The information presented in the below sections are based on literature data. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamics 
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 
The anti-inflammatory activity of fluticasone propionate has been demonstrated by its effects on a 
number of inflammatory mediators and markers in vitro and in vivo. 
In vitro studies 
In vitro studies have shown that Fp potently inhibits anti-CD3-induced proliferation of T-cells taken 
from normal volunteers, with a median effective dose (ED50; at approximately 0.3 nM) that is lower 
than budesonide (0.8 to 2.0 nM) and dexamethasone (5.9 nM). Fp also more potently inhibits 
phytohaemaglutinin-stimulated proliferation of lymphocytes compared to budesonide and 
beclomethasone dipropionate. The proliferation of lymphocytes from corticosteroid-resistant patients 
could also be inhibited by Fp. 
Cytokine generation is inhibited by Fp in a range of human cells. In mast cell studies, Fp was found to 
have median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of <1 nM for inhibition of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, 
IL 8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Concentrations required to inhibit epithelial cell cytokine 
production were slightly greater, with IC50 values of 5, 10, and 1 nM for inhibition of IL-6, IL-8, and 
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, respectively. However, Fp potently inhibited 
epithelial TNF-α generation, with an IC50 value of 0.1 nM. Fp has also been shown to inhibit platelet-
derived growth factor stimulated production of IL-l-β and IL-6 in human alveolar macrophage and 
fibroblast cells. The IC50 value was found to be 0.1 nM for inhibition of IL-l-β and IL-6, respectively, in 
both cell types. 
In vivo studies 
Guinea pigs treated with Fp before intratracheal IL-5 administration showed potent Fp-related 
inhibitory activity against IL-5-induced eosinophilia when eosinophil numbers in bronchioalveolar 
lavage fluid (BALF) were measured after 24 hours. 
Inhibition of histamine challenge-induced mucosal oedema, a model not traditionally recognised as 
being highly corticosteroid responsive, has also been investigated. There was some inhibition with 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 25/147 
 
 
 
beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) at the earliest time, but this was rapidly lost. In contrast, Fp, at 
10% of the dose of BDP, gave a marked and longer lasting response. 
A 5% toluene disocyanate solution was administered intranasally to rats, over an 8-week period, to 
increase mast cell proliferation in nasal mucosa. Fp treatment was found to potently inhibit this 
response; an intranasal dose of 50 mcg/day reducing mast cell numbers to basal levels. The study 
demonstrates the ability of Fp to decrease inflammatory cell accumulation induced by an intranasal 
stimulus. Studies in rodents were conducted to quantify and compare anti-inflammatory activity after 
topical administration of Fp and the ability to produce specific systemic steroid-related effects after 
topical, oral, or parenteral administration. Topical anti-inflammatory activity was measured in rats and 
mice using the inflammatory response to croton oil applied topically to the ear. Results showed that Fp 
was essentially equipotent with fluocinolone acetonide in both rats and mice. Systemic responses to 
repeated topical applications of Fp were assessed by measurement of thymus involution and reduction 
in stress-induced plasma corticosterone (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis suppression) in 
rats and mice, and adrenal atrophy in the rat. In these tests Fp was 50-100 fold less potent than 
fluocinolone acetonide in the rat (56-fold greater therapeutic index) and 100-times less potent than 
fluocinolone acetonide in mice (relative therapeutic index 91). Therefore, in both species, the 
separation between topical anti-inflammatory and systemic activity after topical application was highly 
favourable to Fp. Comparison of systemic activity after topical and subcutaneous dosing of Fp shows 
that, in both rats and particularly in mice, Fp is more potent when given subcutaneously. After oral 
dosing in rats, Fp caused some thymus involution, adrenal atrophy and HPA axis suppression but was 
6- to 38-times less potent than betamethasone alcohol. In the mouse, oral Fp is 60- to 200-times less 
potent than betamethasone alcohol. 
Animal studies of the relative anti-inflammatory and HPA axis inhibitory potencies of topically applied 
drug demonstrated that Fp has an advantageous therapeutic index (>200-times that of 
beclomethasone dipropionate). 
In an ovalbumin (OVA) challenge assay in mice, intranasal administration of fp can modulate the 
remodelling of airway smooth muscle via regulation of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 production 
and active TGF-β1 signalling. When rats were exposed to aerosolised OVA (1%), the allergen-induced 
progression of established structural airway changes could be inhibited by treatment with inhaled Fp. 
In monkeys, Fp markedly inhibited allergen (dinitrophenol Ascaris suum allergen [DNP A])-induced 
airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in an asthma model. Similar effect was observed after the 
treatment with prednisolone. 
Salmeterol Xinafoate (Sx) 
In vitro studies 
The persistent action of the drug could be fully reversed by the β1- and β2-adrenoceptor blocker, 
sotalol, but when the antagonist was washed out, the activity of Sx was reasserted. Despite the 
sustained agonist action, no tolerance or tachyphylaxis has been observed with Sx in respiratory 
smooth muscle. Binding studies suggest that the long duration of effect of salmeterol is due to a 
unique method of action whereby a portion of the molecule binds with high affinity to nonpolar 
domains or exosites from where the rest of the molecule can interact freely with the active site of the 
β2 adrenoceptor. 
The pharmacologic effects of β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including Sx, are at least in part 
attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic 
AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibit the release of mediators of 
immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 26/147 
 
 
 
Sx also inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory and spasmogenic mediators in the lung by an action at 
β2-adrenoceptors on mast cells. Histamine, leukotriene, and prostaglandin D release from human lung 
fragments in vitro is inhibited by Sx in a concentration dependent manner. 
There has been some debate about the anti-inflammatory properties of Sx. In vitro it has a potent 
effect on the IgE-dependent release of histamine, prostaglandin D2, and leukotrienes C4 and D4 from 
passively sensitised human lung fragments, achieving log IC50 values of 8.54, 9.07, and 8.8, 
respectively. As with its effect on smooth muscle, the response has a long duration (>20 hours) and is 
competitively antagonised by propranolol. Because mast cells are the predominant source of mediators 
with reversed anaphylactic challenge, this inhibitory effect of Sx enhances its therapeutic potential in 
asthma. 
Sx, and the related substance salbutamol, do not inhibit IL-1 β production in vitro, but both inhibit 
TNF-α secretion by lipopolysaccharide-activated TPH-1 cells with an IC50 of approximately 0.1 mcM. 
This inhibition is reversible by β2-antagonists. In T-cells, salmeterol inhibits activation (proliferation 
and IL-2 secretion in response to anti-CD3 antibody) at about 1 mcM but this effect is not reversible by 
β2-antagonists. 
Sx inhibits the formation of thromboxane through inhibition of leukotriene-B4 but these effects are 
only seen at high concentrations and are not susceptible to blockade by propranolol, suggesting that 
this response is a non-specific effect on the cell membrane. 
Several in vitro studies suggest that Sx may significantly influence mucociliary clearance by increasing 
ciliary beat frequency and attenuating the ciliary beat frequency slowing induced by Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa toxin pyocyanin. Sx also demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inhibition of the 
release of inflammatory mediators including histamine, thromboxane, and leukotriene. 
In vivo studies 
In the isolated guinea pig fundus preparation, Sx produced smooth muscle relaxation. The 
concentration required to cause relaxation of guinea pig fundus, containing β3-adrenoceptors, was at 
least 1000-fold of that required to activate β2-adrenoceptors in airways smooth muscle, confirming the 
selectivity of Sx. 
The potency and duration of action of the bronchodilator activity of Sx was determined in conscious 
guinea pigs following inhaled and oral administration. Nebulised aerosols of 0.012-12 mcM (equivalent 
to 5-5000 mcg/mL) caused dose-related inhibition of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, with 
bronchodilator activity being similar to Sx. There were no clear differences between the durations of 
action of Sx and salbutamol by the oral route. However, following inhaled administration, the duration 
of action of Sx was substantially longer, exceeding 6 hours, compared with 1.5-3 hours for salbutamol. 
In conscious guinea pig, inhaled Sx and salbutamol were approximately similar in producing dose-
related inhibition of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction over a concentration range of 0.012-12 
mM. However, at threshold effective concentrations, the duration of protection afforded by Sx 
exceeded 6 hours compared to <1.5 hours with salbutamol.  
Sx has been shown to inhibit the extravasation of protein into the airways of guinea pigs challenged 
with histamine aerosol in a dose-dependent manner with duration of 6-8 hours. Because this protection 
was blocked by prior treatment with propranolol, it involved stimulation of β2-adrenoceptors. 
Activation of these receptors has been reported to maintain the integrity of the endothelial cell gap 
junctions, thereby preventing leakage of plasma proteins into the extravascular compartments. 
Sx has also been shown to inhibit acute leukocyte influx after endotoxin (neutrophils), platelet-
activating factor (PAF), and antigen (eosinophils) challenge of guinea pig airways in vivo, whereas in 
these models salbutamol is ineffective. A possible explanation for these findings may be found in 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 27/147 
 
 
 
considering the time course of cell infiltration in these models, which ranges from 4 to >8 hours. Over 
this period, any inhibitory effects of short-acting β-agonists (such as salbutamol) will decline, whereas 
this will not be the case with salmeterol. 
All β2-agonists relax the tissue of isolated airways (eg, guinea pig trachea) when tone is induced with 
prostaglandin PGF2α, carbachol, or through electrical stimulation. However, whereas the onset of 
action of isoprenaline, salbutamol, and fenoterol is rapid (<4 minutes), Sx is slow to reach equilibrium 
under these conditions. 
Nebulised aerosols of Sx (0.001-1 mg/mL) caused a dose-related inhibition of plasma protein 
extravasation (PPE) induced by histamine. Both Sx and salbutamol had an ED50 of approximately 0.01 
mg/mL, but the duration of action of Sx was substantially longer, being 6-8 hours compared with less 
than 2 hours for salbutamol. Orally administered Sx (0.01-1 mg/kg) also reduced histamine-induced 
PPE in a dose-related manner with an ED50 of 0.02 mg/kg. Prior treatment of animals with propranolol 
abolished the inhibition of PPE, indicating that these effects were mediated by β-adrenoceptors, 
probably at the level of the vascular endothelium. 
The effects of Sx on behavior, muscle tone, reflexes, and autonomic function were investigated after 
intravenous dosing in the dog and acute oral administration in the conscious rat and dog. These effects 
were consistent with the known pharmacology of β2-adrenoceptor agonists. 
Fluticasone and Salmeterol Combination (FS MDPI) 
The combination can offer a more convenient regime for patients requiring concurrent LABA and ICS. 
The products are designed to produce a greater improvement in pulmonary function and symptom 
control than either fluticasone propionate or salmeterol used alone at their recommended dosages. 
β2-agonists relax airway smooth muscle, but also inhibit mediator release from mast cells, prevent 
plasma exudation and inhibit activation of sensory nerves, whereas corticosteroid have inhibitory 
effects on the cells of chronic inflammation, including T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, macrophages, and 
dendritic cells, resulting in reduced airway hyper responsiveness. Corticosteroids increase the 
expression of β2-receptors and protect them against down-regulation in response to long-term β2-
agonist exposure, whereas β2-agonists may enhance the anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids. 
Thus, each class of drug enhances the others beneficial actions. 
Sx, in combination with Fp, can enhance glucocorticoid receptors (GR) nuclear translocation in vivo, as 
well as in vitro, and the data suggest that Sx may play an important role in the additional benefits 
seen with combination therapy. GR are specific cytoplasmic transcription factors that mediate the 
biological action of corticoids. In vitro, the enhanced GR nuclear translocation is associated with an 
amplified GR functional response. This may account, at least in part, for the effect seen with Sx alone 
in vivo. 
Overall, the combination of Sx and Fp is considered to enhance aspects of allergen-induced airway 
remodelling without causing changes in airway responsiveness. 
2.3.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamics  
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 
Fp has not been associated with adverse effects on the cardiovascular or central nervous systems. 
Fp has been screened for a wide range of steroid hormonal or anti-hormonal activity in rats and mice 
and was found to be devoid of androgenic, anabolic, estrogenic, and anti-gonadotrophic activity, while 
some progestational, anti-androgenic, and anti-estrogenic activity was noted in oestrogen-primed 
Assessment Report

Page 28/147 
 
 
 
weanling rabbits. Weak anti-anabolic activity, another characteristic of potent glucocorticoids, was 
observed in the castrated rat. Fp lacked mineralocorticoid activity but caused significant diuresis and 
urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. In dogs, Fp administered via inhalation at dose levels 3-
fold higher than the maximum recommended clinical dose, has been associated with marked 
suppression of plasma cortisol concentrations and adrenal function.  
Corticosteroids attenuate the immune and inflammatory response by several mechanisms. Local 
administration of corticosteroids is used extensively in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis and 
is considered to be the most efficient safe anti-inflammatory treatment currently available. Several 
studies have shown that ICS decrease the number of eosinophils in the airways of asthmatic patients 
and reduce the presence of eosinophil granule proteins in BALF. The effect of ICS after repeated 
allergen exposure-induced bone marrow activation and airway eosinophilia was investigated by 
assessing the number of eosinophils in bone marrow, BALF, and airways tissue in a BALB/c mouse 
model. Treatment with Fp significantly reduced the increase of absolute number of mature bone 
marrow eosinophils and showed a tendency towards decrease in the immature bone marrow eosinophil 
number compared to controls. However, Fp had no significant effect on BALF and airways tissue 
eosinophils. In this murine allergy model, intranasal corticosteroid reduced number of bone marrow 
mature eosinophils, but did not significantly affect airways cell populations.  
Salmeterol xinafoate (Sx)  
Salmeterol-related effects on behaviour, muscle tone, reflexes, and autonomic function have been 
evaluated from a non-clinical viewpoint; the results were consistent with the known pharmacology of 
β2 adrenoceptor agonists. In addition, Sx has been associated with signs such as vasodilation, 
tachycardia, vomiting, and decreased activity, which were all attributed to exaggerated pharmacology. 
No evidence of dysrhythmia or significant changes in electrocardiogram data has been noted in 
monkeys.  
Fluticasone and Salmeterol Combination (FS MDPI) 
In anaesthetised guinea pigs, there was no marked effect on the cardiovascular system when Fp was 
administered prior to Sx. Fp administered subcutaneously for 14 days to mice did not affect the 
contraction of isolated uteri due to Sx, showing no drug interaction. 
Doses of less than 25 mg/kg/day of Fp and Sx in rats are capable of eliciting significant skeletal muscle 
hypertrophy with minimal or no cardiac hypertrophy, thus highlighting their significant clinical potential 
for muscle wasting conditions. 
2.3.2.3.  Safety Pharmacology 
No new safety pharmacology studies were conducted for this submission. 
A safety pharmacology study outlined in an approved (Advair) product determined the potential 
interaction of subcutaneously administered Fp with the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of 
intravenously administered Sx in anaesthetised guinea pigs. Salmeterol at doses (including and 
exceeding those required for pharmacological effects or amounts likely to be absorbed clinically after 
inhalation), had no effects other than those consistent with the known pharmacological profile of the 
compound (decreases in blood pressure and increases in heart rate). These effects were not 
exacerbated by pre-treatment with Fp.  
2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamics drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic interaction animal studies were conducted with the combination. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 29/147 
 
 
 
Non-clinical interaction studies would not add to the body of data already available, based on the fact 
that there is sufficient clinical experience with combined use of the individual medicinal products in 
patients.  
Preterm birth was induced with a combination of mifepristone and prostaglandin E2 on day 19 of 
pregnancy. Rats were treated with Sx or gestagens (progesterone or 17- hydroxyprogesterone) or 
their combination. The treatments were launched on different days (15-18) of pregnancy. The efficacy 
of treatment was determined in terms of the delivery time counted from the mifepristone injection. 
Salmeterol treatment delayed premature labour by 2.4 hours, whereas the delay due to gestagen-
salmeterol combinations was more than 5 hours. Parallel treatment with salmeterol and gestagens can 
be more than twice as effective as Sx therapy alone. 
Studies in laboratory animals (minipigs, rodents, and dogs) have demonstrated the occurrence of 
cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death (with histological evidence of myocardial necrosis) when β-
agonists and methylxanthines are administered concurrently. The clinical significance of these findings 
is unknown. This is reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 
Fp is associated with low oral bioavailability due to poor absorption and extensive first-pass 
metabolism; however, the majority of Fp delivered to the lung is systemically absorbed. 
Due to low oral bioavailability, the swallowed portion of inhaled dosages should have less systemic 
effect than other inhaled steroids. Evidence to support this hypothesis has been obtained by measuring 
plasma cortisol, as an index of adrenal suppression, during Fp administration. Orally administered Fp, 
in doses up to 16 mg, had no effect on plasma cortisol levels. Intranasal Fp 2 mg twice daily for 7 days 
also had no effect on plasma cortisol. Inhalation administration to rats involves a significant ingestion 
of the dose, with subsequent excretion via the feces. Direct pulmonary dosing in dogs involved higher 
systemic exposure.  
Salmeterol xinafoate (Sx) 
Salmeterol is extensively absorbed across the gastrointestinal tract in both rat and dog after oral 
administration. However, the clearance of Sx is about 3-times higher in rat than in dog, indicating that 
hepatic extraction is also higher in the rat. 
In radiolabelled studies in rat, dog, mouse, and pregnant rabbit, peak plasma levels were attained 
within 1 hour of dosing and were much lower than the mean peak concentrations of total drug related 
material, indicating extensive metabolism. However, Sx represented a much higher proportion of the 
circulating radioactivity in the dog than in the rat. This is consistent with the oral bioavailability of Sx 
being lower in rats (<15%) than in dog (approximately 60%). 
The maximum concentration of Sx detected in plasma from animals in repeat-dose, combined 
oral/inhalation toxicity studies exceeds by several hundred-fold the maximum concentrations (200 
pg/mL) determined after the standard therapeutic dose in humans. Salmeterol acts locally in the lung; 
the applicant therefore considered that plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect. Because of the 
low therapeutic dose, systemic levels of Sx are low or undetectable after inhalation of the 
recommended dose in humans.  
Fluticasone and Salmeterol Combination 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 30/147 
 
 
 
Both Fp and Sx work locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect in 
humans. 
Toxicokinetic data from the Fp/Sx combination studies generally showed dose-related but not dose-
proportional increases in plasma concentrations. In a single dose inhalation study in dogs, Fp and Sx 
were administered as a powder in a 1:1 combination and Sx was absorbed faster and to a greater 
degree than Fp. 
Distribution 
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 
Studies examining the distribution of radiolabeled Fp in rats have shown that only traces of 
radioactivity pass into the systemic circulation after an oral dose. When administered orally to 
pregnant rats (100 mcg/kg) or rabbits (300 mcg/kg), a very small fraction of the dose (<0.005%) 
passes across the placenta. 
Fp binds to the same high degree (94.6-96.5%) to plasmas proteins of rats, dogs, and humans. Fp is 
weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Fp 
binds to a lower degree (17-31%) to the red blood cells in rats, dogs, and humans. 
Salmeterol xinafoate (Sx) 
The distribution of Sx in body tissues is consistent with that expected of a highly lipophilic base. At 
least 93% of the Sx distributed between erythrocytes and plasma is reversibly bound to the plasma 
proteins, β1-acid glycoprotein and albumin, in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and man. The high plasma 
clearance of Sx indicates that changes in the degree of protein binding are unlikely to influence the 
rate of elimination. 
Fluticasone and Salmeterol Combination 
A placental study in mice showed that both Fp administered subcutaneously at 100 mcg/kg and Sx 
administered orally at 10 mg/kg crossed the placenta. Based on radioactivity, Fp crosses the placenta 
to a greater degree than Sx. Their levels in the fetuses were low as the maximum percent of the dose 
was 0.2% for Fp and 0.043% for Sx.  
Metabolism 
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 
Around 64% of an inhaled or intranasal dose of Fp is swallowed and then excreted unabsorbed in the 
feces as the unchanged compound. The remainder of the dose is subject to rapid and extensive 
metabolism in the liver, either pre-systemically following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract or 
after absorption from the site of administration into the systemic circulation. 
In mice, rats, and dogs, Fp partially undergoes hydrolysis of the –COSCH2F substitution at the 17-
position to the –COOH derivative. In dogs, Fp also undergoes defluorination at the 6 position. Both 
metabolites are excreted as the glucuronide. The predominant route of excretion for the metabolites 
and unchanged Fp was fecal. 
The only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17β-carboxylic acid derivative of Fp, which is 
formed through the CYP 3A4 pathway. This metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2000) than 
the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible 
pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human 
hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. 
Salmeterol xinafoate (Sx) 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021

Salmeterol is extensively metabolised by the liver. An in vitro study using human liver microsomes 
showed that Sx is extensively metabolised to α-hydroxysalmeterol (aliphatic oxidation) by CYP 3A4. 
This metabolite strongly binds to guinea pig tracheal tissue. Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP 
3A4, essentially completely inhibited the formation of α-hydroxysalmeterol in vitro. 
In humans, Sx undergoes aliphatic oxidation, whereas in rat, rabbit, and mouse the predominant 
metabolic route is glucuronidation of Sx. The major Sx metabolite in the dog was identified as the 3-
catechol sulphate of the benzoic acid derivative. The major metabolite of Sx in humans, hydroxylated 
on the butyl chain, is only a minor metabolite in the rat. However, exposure to this metabolite during 
rat toxicology studies was 100-fold greater than in human. This metabolite, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic 
acid (HNA), is pharmacologically active, but the effect is of shorter duration than that of Sx. 
Elimination 
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 
Pharmacokinetic data from laboratory animals indicate a rapid and extensive metabolic clearance with 
rapid elimination in the bile and excretion in feces. This is supported by results from radiolabeled 
dosing via intravenous route to rats and dogs and via oral and subcutaneous routes in mice, rats, and 
dogs. Studies in bile-duct cannulated animals support biliary excretion. No unchanged drug is excreted 
in the bile of rats or dogs, but a significant amount (up to 40%) of unchanged compound was found in 
the feces of dogs dosed orally with fluticasone propionate. Renal excretion is of minor importance, as 
urinary excretion accounts for less than 5% of a parenteral dose. 
Oral or subcutaneous Fp administration to lactating rats resulted in measurable levels in milk. It is not 
known if Fp is excreted into the milk of lactating humans. 
Salmeterol xinafoate (Sx) 
In all species, Sx and its metabolites are excreted predominantly in the bile. Enterohepatic circulation 
of Sx has been demonstrated in the rat; however, no enterohepatic circulation of drug-related material 
occurs in the dog. 
With the exception of the rabbit, HNA accumulated on repeat dosing in animals. Accumulation was also 
observed in humans, but the steady-state concentrations in humans are 1000-fold lower than those 
seen in species used in toxicology testing. It is unlikely that the major metabolite of HNA in humans is 
the same as that in rat. HNA and its metabolites are excreted predominantly via urine. 
Studies have shown that Sx and its metabolites are excreted into the milk of lactating animals. 
Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions 
Nonclinical PK interaction studies would not add to the body of data already available because there is 
sufficient clinical experience with combined use of the individual medicinal products in patients. 
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 
Fp is a substrate of CYP 3A4. The use of strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, atazanavir, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) 
with Fp products is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may 
occur. 
A drug interaction trial with Fp aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a 
strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma Fp exposure, resulting in significantly 
reduced serum cortisol concentrations. During post-marketing use, there have been reports of clinically 
significant drug interactions in patients receiving Fp and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid 
effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression.

Clinical coadministration of orally inhaled Fp (1000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) 
resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in plasma Fp exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol area 
under the curve (AUC), but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol. 
Salmeterol xinafoate (Sx) 
Salmeterol is also a substrate of CYP 3A4. The use of strong CYP 3A4 inhibitors (eg, ritonavir, 
atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, 
telithromycin) with salmeterol products is not recommended because increased cardiovascular adverse 
effects may occur. 
In a drug interaction trial in 20 healthy human subjects, co-administration of inhaled Sx (50 mcg twice 
daily) and oral ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in greater systemic exposure to 
Sx (AUC increased 16-fold and Cmax increased 1.4-fold). Three subjects were withdrawn due to β2-
agonist side effects (2 with prolonged QTc and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Although 
there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of Sx and ketoconazole was 
associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with Sx and placebo administration. 
Salmeterol products should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such 
agents, because the action of Sx on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents. 
Salmeterol did not affect pentobarbitone-induced sleeping time in mice suggesting it is unlikely to 
interfere with hepatic drug metabolism. 
Fluticasone and Salmeterol Combination 
Plasma concentrations of Sx and Fp administered concomitantly were determined in single dose 
inhalation studies in the rat and dog. Plasma levels at the lowest dose levels used in the studies (28/73 
mcg/kg in the rat, and 48/50 mcg/animal in the dog) were about 30-fold and 26-fold greater in rat and 
13-fold and 3- to 5-fold greater in dog than the peak levels likely to occur in man for Sx and Fp. 
Repeat dose pharmacokinetics of Sx and Fp has been obtained by monitoring plasma concentrations in 
inhalation toxicity studies in the rat and dog. In both species, plasma levels of Fp were not affected by 
concurrent salmeterol administered and plasma levels of salmeterol were not affected by co-
administration with Fp. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological aspects of the respective individual and combined products have been very well-
characterised and summarised in previous regulatory reviews, approved product labels, and published 
literature that are available in the public domain. The toxicological profile of Fp and Sx is generally 
characterised by the exaggerated glucocorticoid and β-agonist pharmacological activity of each drug. 
The applicant did not provide additional nonclinical studies as there is sufficient clinical experience with 
the individual and combined products in patients. 
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 
In acute toxicology studies in mice, rats, and dogs, Fp’s toxic manifestations were characteristic of 
glucocorticoids (eg, weight loss, decreased thymus weight, and/or decreased cortisol levels). Minimal 
toxicity and no mortality were observed after very high oral doses (≥1000 mg/kg) in mice and rats, 
which is likely due to extensive first-pass metabolism. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 33/147 
 
 
 
Salmeterol xinafoate (Sx) 
Salmeterol acute toxicology has been evaluated in rats, mice and dogs. No mortality was observed 
after administering inhalation doses of 2.9 or 0.7 mg/kg to rats or dogs, respectively, or oral doses of 
150 or 1000 mg/kg to mice or rats. Mortality was noted in mice after oral administration of salmeterol 
base at 125 mg/kg. 
Fluticasone and Salmeterol Combination 
Acute inhalation toxicology studies of Fp and Sx dry powder combinations have been performed in rats 
and dogs. 
The studies in rats included a 1:2 [ratio] combination dose (at a high dose of 1.93 mg/kg Fp and 3.63 
mg/kg Sx) that resulted in typical β2-agonist (eg, cardiotoxicity) and glucocorticoid (eg, decreased 
body weight gain and lymphoid depletion) effects and some local effects (eg, irritation to the larynx 
and nasal cavity), a 2:1 combination at lower doses (0.46 or 0.91 mg/kg Fp and 0.25 or 0.49 mg/kg 
Sx) showed similar findings to a lesser degree and no larynx or nasal cavity irritation, a subsequent 
2:1 combination (at 1.1 or 5.4 mg/kg Fp and 0.56 or 2.8 mg/kg Sx) showed only atrial myocarditis, 
which is characteristic of β2-agonism, and a third study that was comprised of a single inhalation dose 
of Sx alone at 5.2 mg/kg, which was associated with ventricular degeneration, and a combination of Fp 
at 1.9 mg/kg and Sx at 3.3 mg/kg that produced atrial myocarditis in addition to ventricular 
degeneration. The latter study suggested the potential for enhanced cardiotoxicity with the 
combination; however, subsequent repeat-dose toxicology studies suggest the combination is not 
associated with significant effects on ECG or cardiac histopathology. 
A single-dose inhalation toxicology study in dogs at a 1:1 combination (0.016 or 0.164 mg/kg Fp and 
0.017 or 0.178 mg/kg Sx) revealed findings characteristic of β2-agonists and glucocorticoids. The low 
dose showed a decrease (50%) in body weight gain and the high-dose group showed an increased 
(33%) body weight gain, suggesting the β2 agonist’s pharmacological effect (increased body weight 
gain) offset the decreased body weight gain effect of the glucocorticoid. 
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 
The toxicological profile of Fp is generally characterised by exaggerated glucocorticoid pharmacological 
activity. Fp at high doses is associated with findings such as lymphoid depletion, decreased 
cortisosterone levels, decreased body weight gain, increased red blood cell (RBC) counts, and 
decreased white blood cell (WBC) counts, and liver, adrenal, spleen and thymus histopathology 
findings in rats; and decreased cortisol response to Synacthen (ACTH), decreased body weight gain, 
increased urea and cholesterol levels, increased liver weights, decreased adrenal weights, and thymic 
atrophy in dogs. 
Salmeterol xinafoate (Sx) 
The observations from repeat-dose toxicology studies conducted in rats and dogs were generally 
characteristic of β-agonists. 
Salmeterol at high enough doses was associated with findings such as reductions in the number of 
platelets, decreased plasma glucose, increased urea and creatinine, increased urine volume associated 
with decreased specific gravity, increased heart and lung weights and decreased liver and kidney 
weights, and skeletal muscle hypertrophy in rats; and tachycardia, vasodilation, hypoglycemia, 
palpillary muscle fibrosis and calcification, and increased muscle mass in dogs.

Fluticasone and Salmeterol Combination 
A battery of repeat dose toxicology studies conducted in rats and dogs have been conducted for Advair 
Diskus. The combination toxicology studies were not designed such that NOAEL levels for the 
combination could be determined. Instead, the approach was to give the drugs in combination at doses 
with known toxic effects to see if toxicity was altered in the presence of the other drug. The findings 
were generally as expected for the doses of Sx and Fp administered, most being typical of β2-agonist 
or corticosteroid excess. The repeat dose toxicity studies confirm previous findings that Fp enhances 
the cardiac toxicity of Sx in rats. The atrial myocarditis and coronary arteritis observed in rats was not 
observed in dogs. Overall, there was no evidence for synergism, potentiation, or unique effects of the 
combination. 
2.3.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No new genetic toxicology studies were conducted for this submission. 
Fluticasone Propionate (Fp) 
Fp did not induce gene mutation in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells in vitro. No significant clastogenic 
effect was seen in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus 
test. 
Salmeterol Xinafoate 
Salmeterol produced no detectable or reproducible increases in microbial and mammalian gene 
mutation in vitro. No clastogenic activity occurred in vitro in human lymphocytes or in vivo in a rat 
micronucleus test. 
Fluticasone and Salmeterol Combination 
No genetic toxicology studies could be found with the combination. According to ICH M3, combination 
genotoxicity studies are not needed when the individual agents have been appropriately tested. 
2.3.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No new carcinogenicity studies were conducted for this submission. 
Fluticasone Propionate (Fp) 
Fp demonstrated no tumorigenic potential in mice at oral doses up to 1000 mcg/kg for 78 weeks or in 
rats at inhalation doses up to 57 mcg/kg for 104 weeks. 
Salmeterol Xinafoate (Sx) 
In an 18-month carcinogenicity study in CD-mice, Sx at oral doses of 1.4 mg/kg and above caused a 
dose-related increase in the incidence of smooth muscle hyperplasia, cystic glandular hyperplasia, 
leiomyomas of the uterus, and ovarian cysts. No tumours were seen at 0.2 mg/kg. 
In a 24-month oral and inhalation carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats, salmeterol caused a 
dose-related increase in the incidence of mesovarian leiomyomas and ovarian cysts at doses of 0.68 
mg/kg and above. No tumours were seen at 0.21 mg/kg. These findings in rodents are similar to those 
reported previously for other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs. The relevance of these findings to human 
use is unknown.

According to ICH M3 on-clinical safety studies for the conduct of human clinical trials for 
pharmaceuticals, combination carcinogenicity studies are not needed when the individual agents have 
been appropriately evaluated. 
2.3.4.5.  Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity 
Fluticasone Propionate (Fp) 
Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered 
systemically throughout the period of organogenesis at relatively low-dosage levels; however, when 
delivered via inhalation to rats, Fp did not induce teratogenicity at a maternal toxic dose. 
Cleft palate and fetal skeletal variations were observed in mouse fetuses at a maternal subcutaneous 
dose of 45 mcg/kg/day. The mouse NOAEL was observed with a dose a maternal subcutaneous dose of 
15 mcg/kg/day. 
Omphalocele, decreased body weight, and skeletal variations were observed in rat fetuses, in the 
presence of maternal toxicity, at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 100 mcg/kg/day. The rat no NOAEL 
was observed at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 30 mcg/kg/day. 
In an embryofetal development study with pregnant rats dosed by the inhalation route throughout the 
period of organogenesis, Fp produced decreased fetal body weights and skeletal variations, in the 
presence of maternal toxicity, at a maternal inhalation dose of 25.7 mcg/kg/day; however, there was 
no evidence of teratogenicity. The NOAEL was observed with a maternal inhalation dose of 5.5 
mcg/kg/day. 
In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits that were dosed by the subcutaneous route 
throughout organogenesis, Fp produced reductions of fetal body weights, in the presence of maternal 
toxicity, at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.57 mcg/kg/day. Teratogenicity was evident based upon 
a finding of cleft palate for 1 fetus at a a maternal subcutaneous dose of 4 mcg/kg/day. The NOAEL 
was observed in rabbit fetuses with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0.08 mcg/kg/day. 
Fp crossed the placenta following subcutaneous administration to mice and rats and oral administration 
to rabbits. 
In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late gestation through 
delivery and lactation (Gestation Day 17 to Postpartum Day 22), Fp was not associated with decreases 
in pup body weight, and had no effects on developmental landmarks, learning, memory, reflexes, or 
fertility at doses up to 50 mcg/kg/day. 
Salmeterol Xinafoate (Sx) 
β2-agonists have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically 
at relatively low dosage levels and may interfere with uterine contractility. 
In 2 embryofetal development studies, pregnant rats received Sx by oral administration at doses 
ranging from 100 to 10,000 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. Salmeterol produced no 
maternal toxicity or embryofetal effects at maternal oral doses up to 10,000 mcg/kg/day. 
In 3 embryofetal development studies, pregnant rabbits received oral administration of Sx at doses 
ranging from 100 to 10,000 mcg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. In pregnant Dutch rabbits 
administered Sx at maternal oral doses of 1,000 mcg/kg/day and higher, fetal toxic effects were 
observed characteristically resulting from beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. These included precocious 
eyelid openings, cleft palate, sternebral fusion, limb and paw flexures, and delayed ossification of the 
frontal cranial bones. No such effects occurred at a Sx dose of 600 mcg/kg/day. New Zealand White

rabbits were less sensitive, as only delayed ossification of the frontal cranial bones was observed at a 
Sx maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day. 
In a peri- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats dosed by the oral route from late 
gestation through delivery and lactation, Sx at a maternal oral dose of 10,000 mcg/kg/day was 
fetotoxic and decreased the fertility of survivors. Sx crossed the placenta following oral administration 
to mice and rats. 
No effects on fertility or reproductive performance were identified in rats treated with Sx at oral doses 
up to 2 mg/kg. 
Fluticasone and Salmeterol Combination 
In the mouse reproduction assay, Fp by the subcutaneous route at 150 mcg/kg/day combined with oral 
Sx at 10 mg/kg/day produced cleft palate, fetal death, increased implantation loss, and delayed 
ossification. These observations are characteristic of glucocorticoids. No developmental toxicity was 
observed at combination doses of Fp subcutaneously up to 40 mcg/kg/day and oral doses of salmeterol 
up to 1.4 mg/kg/day. 
In rats, combining Fp subcutaneously at 100 mcg/kg/day and an oral dose of Sx at 10 mg/kg/day 
produced decreased fetal weight, umbilical hernia, delayed ossification, and changes in the occipital 
bone. No such effects were seen when combining Fp subcutaneously at a dose of 30 mcg/kg/day and 
an oral dose of salmeterol at 1 mg/kg/day. 
2.3.4.6.  Juvenile toxicity 
Subcutaneous administration of 1, 5 or 10 mcg/kg/day Fp to juvenile rats from day 8-43 of life did not 
affect survival or general health of treated rats. Male and female animals receiving 10 mcg/kg/day 
exhibited a reduced rate of body weight gain, but sexual maturation, as assessed by the decent of 
testes or vaginal opening, was unaffected. Examination of the epiphyses of the femur indicated no 
major corticosteroid effects on growth. A decrease in thymus weight was seen in animals receiving 5 or 
10 mcg/kg/day, but no corresponding histological changes were detected. Based on these findings, it 
was concluded that fluticasone propionate had no specific effects on the maturation of juvenile rats. 
In a juvenile dog study, 5, 15 or 25 mcg/kg/day Fp was administered by head-only inhalation to 2-
week-old dogs for 20 minutes per day for 7 weeks. There were no adverse developmental or irritation 
effects observed in the lungs or other respiratory tract structures among treated dogs. Treatment-
related findings were limited to a decrease in body weight gain in male dogs of all groups and 
macroscopic and microscopic pathological changes in the adrenal glands, including atrophy of the zona 
fasciculata in the adrenals of males and females receiving 15 or 25 μg/kg/day. 
In a separate juvenile dog study, Fp was administered to juvenile dogs by face mask inhalation at 
doses of 7.2 or 52.6 mcg/kg/day for 5 weeks, findings included a decrease in body weight gain, a 
marked decrease in plasma cortisol levels, atrophy of the zona fasciculata in the adrenal gland and 
depletion of lymphocytes in the thymus, which correlated with a decrease in adrenal and thymus 
weights in animals receiving 52.6 mcg/kg/day. 
Similar findings were observed in longer term studies with Fp in dogs. In a 13-week study where 
juvenile dogs were administered Fp by face mask inhalation at doses of 4, 12 or 29 mcg/kg/day, no 
treatment related findings in clinical observations, ophthalmoscopic examinations, or in haematology/ 
clinical chemistry parameters were noted at any dose. There was no evidence of lung developmental 
impairment. The only effect noted was the slightly lower body weight gain for the high dose females 
when compared to the controls. Plasma cortisol levels were reduced in the intermediate and high dose

groups in a dose related manner. Postmortem evaluations revealed a reduction in adrenal weights in 
animals receiving the high dose, and histopathological examination revealed marked atrophy of the 
zona fasciculata in the adrenal glands of all animals receiving the high dose, with mild atrophy being 
observed in one intermediate animal. The adrenal findings are consistent with the exaggerated 
pharmacological responses to corticosteroids. 
2.3.4.7.  Local tolerance 
No local tolerance studies were conducted. 
2.3.4.8.  Other toxicities studies 
Impurities and Degradation Products 
All impurities/degradation product specifications are below the ICH Q3A (Impurities in new drug 
substances) and Q3B (Impurities in new drug products) qualification thresholds for the active 
substance and finished product, respectively. Therefore, impurities/degradation products should not 
present a safety concern for FS MDPI. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of FS Spiromax containing fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate is considered 
unlikely to result in any significant increase in the exposure of the environment to the active 
substance. Moreover, taking into account that the predicted environmental concentration in surface 
water (PECsw) for FS PMDI was lower than the PECsw of approved fluticasone/salmeterol products, no 
additional Phase 1 and 2 data were deemed necessary to provide as part of this application. Thus, the 
ERA is expected not to be increased and therefore salmeterol xinafoate/fluticasone propionate is 
considered unlikely to present a risk to the environment by the applicant.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
No new non-clinical pharmacology studies were conducted for fluticasone propionate (Fp), Salmeterol 
xinafoate (Sx) or the Fluticasone-Salmeterol (FS) combination. This is considered acceptable and in 
line with the EMA’s guideline on the development of fixed dose combinations (EMA/CHM/SWP/258498). 
A literature review of the pharmacology of the individual components alone and in combination has 
been presented and is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Comprehensive  information  on  the  non-clinical  pharmacology  of  each  single  agents  (salmeterol  and 
fluticasone) or two agents combinations are documented in the published literature. Each of individual 
components are known to have different mechanism of actions.  
Fluticasone propionate is a potent fluorinated glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory activity that is 
commonly used to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis. Fluticasone propionate has been marketed in the 
EU for many years and has been shown to reduce symptoms and exacerbations of asthma and to 
decrease airway reactivity to histamine and methacholine in patients with hyperreactive airways. 
Fluticasone propionate is a well-established active substance and is recommended for use in the 
management of asthma in both adults and adolescents. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 38/147 
 
 
 
Salmeterol xinafoate is a LABA bronchodilator that exerts a preferential effect on β2-adrenergic 
receptors on bronchial smooth muscle to produce relaxation and bronchodilatation that lasts for 12 
hours after a single dose. Salmeterol is used via the orally inhaled route in the management of patients 
with reversible airways obstruction associated with mild to moderate asthma. Salmeterol is particularly 
useful in patients with reversible airways obstruction who continue to experience symptoms despite 
treatment with an anti-inflammatory agent such as an inhaled corticosteroid.  
The fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FS) combination is already authorize and indicated in the 
regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product (inhaled corticosteroid and long-
acting β2-agonist) is appropriate: in patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 
'as needed' inhaled short acting β2-agonist or in patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled 
corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist. FS fixed-dose combination products have been marketed in 
the EU for over 21 years in dry powder inhalation formulations (e.g. Seretide Diskus). 
Overall, CHMP agreed that LABA and ICS may optimise each other’s beneficial actions in the airways, 
and that the low systemic effects of these drugs should not result in any increase in adverse effects. 
The secondary pharmacodynamic and safety pharmacology effects of the fluticasone and salmeterol 
combination are largely predictable from well-defined pharmacology of the two individual agents. The 
Applicant relied on the literature on non-clinical data concerning secondary pharmacodynamics of the 
active substances. This was considered acceptable by CHMP. Furthermore, CHMP acknowledged that 
patients have already been exposed to fluticasone and salmeterol and information on potential effects 
on the central nervous system, cardiovascular system and respiratory function might be based on 
clinical data, therefore, the absence of extensive non-clinical data is justified.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions are described in the relevant sections of the SmPC. The absence of 
pharmacodynamic interaction animal studies is acceptable by CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate has been well characterised in 
humans and non-clinical species. No additional new pharmacokinetic animal studies were performed to 
support this submission. This is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Both fluticasone and salmeterol exert their effects locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not 
predict therapeutic effect in humans. Fluticasone propionate is associated with low oral bioavailability 
and considerable pulmonary bioavailability, with most fluticasone propionate delivered to the lung 
being systemically absorbed. Salmeterol is extensively absorbed after oral and inhalation 
administration; however, detectable systemic levels are very low because the therapeutic dose is so 
small. Fluticasone and salmeterol are highly bound to plasma proteins. Both compounds are 
metabolised through the cytochrome P450 isozyme (CYP) 3A4 pathway. Fluticasone is associated with 
a rapid and extensive metabolic clearance with rapid elimination in the bile and excretion in feces, 
while salmeterol and its metabolites are excreted predominantly in the bile. The terminal half-life in 
humans for both compounds is approximately 5½ hours. 
Lactose monohydrate is a well characterize excipient used in the final drug product. This excipient may 
contain trace amounts of milk protein which may cause reactions in patients with hypersensitivity or 
allergy to milk protein. In addition, lactose is contraindicated in patients with galactose intolerance, 
Lapp lactase deficiency or with glucose- galactose malabsorption and patients with these rare 
hereditary problems should not take this medicine.  
Toxicology

No new single dose toxicity studies were conducted by the Applicant for this submission. This is 
considered acceptable by CHMP. Furthermore, the innovator combination product as well as the 
individual components is on the market for a period of over 10 years. 
Overall, previously single dose toxicity studies conducted individually or in combination demonstrated 
no specific target organ toxicity.  
The currently available non-clinical data for each single agents and in combination, together with the 
clinical experience with the active substances in FS MDPI and the general use of LABA/ICS combinations 
in  clinical  settings  do  not  indicate  additional  safety  concerns  for  BroPair  Spiromax  and  are  therefore 
considered adequate to support the marketing authorisation application without additional pharmacology 
studies. 
Environmental risk assessment (ERA) 
The justification for the absence of an ERA is acceptable and an ERA is not deemed necessary. FS 
Spiromax is considered unlikely to present a risk to the environment when use as prescribed. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been conducted by the applicant which is considered in line with the 
EMA’s guideline on the development of fixed dose combinations and acceptable by CHMP. The 
pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological aspects of fluticasone and salmeterol have been 
extensively studied and are well characterised. The results of the non-clinical data are appropriately 
described in the SmPC section 5.3.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology programme for BroPair Spiromax (FS MDPI) included studies to characterise 
the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Fp and/or salmeterol after single-dose oral inhalation administration. This 
application relied, in part, on the previously demonstrated PK and safety of Advair Diskus and Seretide 
Accuhaler.  
The intent of the PK studies was to characterise the PK of the FS MDPI and to compare the exposure of 
Fp and/or salmeterol administered from FS MDPI with administration from Advair Diskus. To this end, 
the applicant conducted 2 clinical studies with FS MDPI that included PK evaluation (Study FSS-AS-
10042 and Study FSS-AS-201). These studies used a matched number of inhalations for 
administration using the FS MDPI and Advair Diskus inhalers. Furthermore, the FSS-AS-10042 study 
used the final version of the FS MDPI device/formulation, which was identical to that used in the Phase 
3 studies. Study FSS-AS-10042 was a single-dose, crossover study. It compared the PK profiles of FS 
MDPI and Advair Diskus in patients with persistent asthma. The study also included comparison of Fp 
MDPI and Flovent Diskus.  
In addition to the PK study of FS MDPI, PK studies of Fp MDPI with a comparator (Flovent Diskus) were 
also performed. The Fp MDPI device is identical to the FS MDPI device but delivers Fp alone. As such, 
the PK data for Fp delivered from the Teva Fp MDPI device is included in this submission as supportive 
only (the mono-component Fp was not submitted for approval in the EU).

EMA/141972/2021

Two Phase 2 studies included an evaluation of the PK of Fp delivered from the MDPI device (Studies 
FpS-AS-201 and FpS-AS-202), and one Phase 2 study included an evaluation of the PK of salmeterol 
delivered from the MDPI device (FSS-AS-201). Each of these studies also included a comparator 
(either Flovent Diskus or Advair Diskus, as appropriate). 
The oral bioavailability of Fp is approximately 0% due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Salmeterol 
systemic exposure is partly attributable to oral absorption. However, the studies with FS MDPI did not 
include a treatment arm with charcoal administration for oral drug removal. Instead, a post-hoc 
analysis of salmeterol area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 to 30 minutes post-
dose (AUC0-30min) was conducted as this is an acceptable surrogate of efficacy related exposure for 
drugs that are rapidly absorbed via the lungs (maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax] 
occurring within 5 minutes or less), such as salmeterol. 
Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 
In Study FSS-AS-10042, after administration of Fp via the FS MDPI device, plasma Fp levels exhibited 
a time to maximum plasma concentration (tmax) ranging from 1 to 2 hours. After reaching peak levels, 
Fp subsequently declined in a multiphasic manner. The elimination half-life (t½) was approximately 10 
hours. Plasma concentrations of Fp peaked between 0.5 and 4 hours after treatment. Upon reaching 
peak levels, Fp concentrations decreased in a multiphasic manner. Comparisons between FS MDPI and 
Advair Diskus showed that the ratio of geometric LS means was close to unity for exposure 
parameters. All exposure parameters for FS MDPI/Advair Diskus comparisons had their 90% CI 
contained within the 80% to 125% boundaries. 
Dose proportionality of AUC0-t and Cmax for Fp was evaluated in an exploratory manner by application of 
a power model to data obtained with Fp MDPI from Study FpS-AS-201 and Study FpS-AS-202 
(summary of PK results in both studies is presented below). Over a nominal dose range (12.5 to 400 
mcg) of Fp MDPI, the increases in Fp AUC0-t were approximately dose proportional while those for 
Cmax were slightly less than dose proportional. For the Fp MDPI 50, 100, and 200 mcg nominal doses, 
both PK parameters for Fp increased in an approximately dose proportional manner, as indicated by 
90% CI of the slopes that generally contained unity. This outcome is consistent with the in vitro 
proportionality of the delivered and aerodynamic performance between the 3 strengths. 
In both studies, exposure (as assessed by area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 
to the time of the last measurable drug concentration [AUC0-t] and maximum observed plasma 
concentration [Cmax]) increased in proportion to the increasing dose of Fp MDPI. The Fp MDPI 50 mcg 
strength corresponds to the low strength of FS MDPI (50/12.5 mcg) included in this application. The 
results from these studies were supportive of the studies with FS MDPI where the exposure of Fp 
administered from FS MDPI increased with increasing doses in the same manner.  
PK of Fp after multiple administrations were not studied in this programme. Although some 
accumulation is predicted to occur following bid administration of Fp and salmeterol, on the basis of 
the single-dose profiles, the PK are expected to be linear. The systemic exposures are expected to be 
lower to the systemic exposure after repeat administration of Advair Diskus or Seretide Accuhaler. 
Study FpS-AS-201: summary of PK results 
Fp AUC0-t and Cmax increased with increasing dose of Fp MDPI. The tmax was similar across treatments 
(median tmax ranged from 0.8 through 1.1 hours).

Table 2: Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Fluticasone Propionate (Study 
FpS-AS-201) 
This study assessed Fp exposure after Fp MDPI single doses of 12.5 mcg, 25 mcg, 50 mcg, and 100 
mcg in a parallel-group design. Exposure (as assessed by AUC0-t and Cmax) increased in a dose 
proportional manner with increasing doses of Fp MDPI. The 50mcg dose of Fp in the Fp MDPI 50 mcg 
strength corresponds to the Fp dose in the low strength of FS MDPI (50/12.5 mcg) included in this 
application. The exposure parameters of Fp after administration from FS MDPI are expected to increase 
similarly with dose, since the device used is the same as Fp MDPI and the Fp exposure was similar 
when the higher strength (200 mcg) of Fp MDPI and FS MDPI was compared (Study FSS-AS-10042). 
Overall, Fp systemic exposure (both area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve from time 0 
to the time of the last measurable drug concentration [AUC0-t] and maximum observed plasma 
concentration [Cmax]) was higher for Fp MDPI (100 mcg bid) than Flovent Diskus (100 mcg bid), 
reflecting better efficiency of delivery from the MDPI device. In addition, Fp systemic exposure (both 
AUC0-t and Cmax) was lower for both 25 and 50 mcg bid Fp MDPI doses compared with 100 mcg bid 
Flovent Diskus. 
Study FpS-AS-202: summary of PK results 
Systemic exposure (both AUC0-t and Cmax) to Fp was higher for Fp MDPI (200 and 400 mcg bid) than 
Flovent Diskus (250 mcg bid). However, the differences in exposure parameters for Fp MDPI (400 mcg 
bid) relative to Flovent Diskus (250 mcg bid) were within 2-fold. Systemic exposure (both AUC0-t and 
Cmax) to Fp was lower for both the 50 and 100 mcg bid Fp MDPI doses compared with 250 mcg bid 
Flovent Diskus.  
The tmax was similar across treatments.

Table 3: Fluticasone Propionate Pharmacokinetics Descriptive Statistics (Study 
FpS-AS-202) 
The exposure (as assessed by AUC0-t and Cmax) increased with increasing Fp MDPI dose, using a 
parallel-group design. Fluticasone administered from FS MDPI is expected to increase with increasing 
doses in the same manner because it is the same device as Fp MDPI and has been shown to result in 
similar PK when the same dose of Fp is administered from either product. 
Salmeterol 
After administration of salmeterol via FS MDPI or Advair Diskus, plasma salmeterol levels exhibited a 
rapid rise with maximal concentrations occurring approximately 0.08 to 2 hours after dosing and 
subsequently declined in a multiphasic manner. The elimination t½ was approximately 12 hours. 
Dose proportionality of AUC0-t and Cmax for salmeterol was evaluated in an exploratory manner by 
application of a power model to data from Study FSS-AS-201 (a summary of the PK results is 
presented below). Over a nominal dose range of FS MDPI 100/6.25 to 100/50 mcg, the increases in 
salmeterol AUC0-t and Cmax were slightly greater than dose proportional. Between the FS MDPI 
100/6.25 to 100/25 mcg nominal doses, both PK parameters for salmeterol increased in a dose 
proportional manner, as indicated by 90% CI of the slopes that contain unity. This outcome is 
consistent with the in vitro proportionality of the delivered and aerodynamic performance between the 
3 strengths. 
Post-hoc analyses of salmeterol area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 30 
minutes post-dose (AUC0-30min) were conducted. This is considered to be a surrogate for efficacy. The 
overall ratio of exposure for FS MDPI versus Advair Diskus was about 77% to 85% for the partial 
exposure AUC0-30min. The total systemic exposure (AUC0-t), however, represents a surrogate for safety; 
the ratio of FS MDPI versus Advair Diskus was about 50% for the total exposure. 
Notably, while the safety exposure is only half that of Advair Diskus, the applicant considered that the 
targeted exposure to the lungs, resulting in a clinical effect, is 77% to 85% of Advair Diskus.  
PK of salmeterol after multiple administrations from FS MDPI were not studied in this programme but 
are expected to be lower to the systemic exposure after repeat administration of Advair Diskus or 
Seretide Accuhaler.

Study FSS-AS-201: Summary of PK results 
The plasma concentration-versus-time profiles of salmeterol after administration from FS MDPI at 
100/6.25, 100/12.5, 100/25, and 100/50 mcg and from Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg in patients with 
asthma are illustrated in Figure 5. 
The mean plasma concentrations of salmeterol were highest at 5 minutes after treatment for each FS 
MDPI dose level. Thereafter, the mean plasma concentrations of salmeterol declined, but were still 
quantifiable through 12 hours (the last time point sampled) after treatment. There was a dose-related 
increase in the mean plasma concentrations of salmeterol across the range of FS MDPI doses 
evaluated.

The PK parameters for salmeterol after administration of FS MDPI and Advair Diskus are summarised 
in Table 4. Both AUC 0-t and C max of salmeterol increased with increasing FS MDPI doses. Across all 
FS MDPI groups, t max occurred earlier (median=0.1 hour) compared with Advair Diskus (median=0.5 
hour).

Differences between the FS MDPI doses and the Advair Diskus group for AUC0-t and Cmax were analysed 
using an analysis of variance with fixed effects of sequence, period, and treatment (Table 5). Only the 
FS MDPI 100/50 mcg dose demonstrated a geometric mean ratio (GMR) that was greater than 1 for 
AUC0-t when compared with Advair Diskus, with all other FS MDPI doses showing ratios that were less 
than 1. For the Cmax, the FS MDPI 100/50 and 100/25 mcg doses showed a GMR greater than 1 
whereas the ratios for the FS MDPI 100/12.5 and 100/6.25 mcg doses were less than 1.

Table 5: Treatment Comparison of Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Salmeterol 
Between FS MDPI Dose Groups and Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg (Study FSS-AS-201) 
The applicant considered that the PK evaluation of FS MDPI showed that following administration with 
Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg, systemic exposure to salmeterol (AUC0-t and Cmax) was higher than 
following administration with the FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg strength and lower strengths of salmeterol, 
while exposure with Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg was lower than following administration of the FS MDPI 
100/25 mcg strength and the higher strengths of salmeterol. Both AUC0-t and Cmax of salmeterol 
increased with increasing FS MDPI doses. Although overall systemic exposure (AUC0-t) with FS MDPI 
100/12.5 mcg was approximately 43% that of Advair Diskus, in a post-hoc analysis the partial 
exposure representing lung absorption systemic exposure (AUC0-30 min) for FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was 
approximately 85% that of Advair Diskus. 
A discussion was provided on the concept of similarity of systematic exposure to salmeterol between 
FS MDPI and Advair Diskus, when a geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 0.427 for AUC0-t and 0.795 for the 
Cmax, was observed with the comparison of the dose selected for the Phase 3 studies FS MDPI 100/12.5 
and Advair Diskus 100/50mcg. Of note, the 100/50mcg dose inhalation powder is the lowest of the 
three strengths approved for Advair Diskus.  
The treatment comparison of FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg to Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg for salmeterol for 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 30 minutes postdose (AUC0-30min) 
and maximum observed plasma drug concentration in the first 30 minutes after administration (Cmax, 
0-30min) resulted in GMRs of 0.848 pg•h/mL and 0.925 pg/mL, respectively. The data demonstrated 
that partial exposure for salmeterol, which is a surrogate for efficacy, is comparable between the FS 
MDPI dose of 100/12.5 mcg and Advair Diskus dose of 100/50 mcg. The Applicant concluded that the 
clinical data demonstrated a dose response for the range of salmeterol doses tested in the Phase 2 
Study FSS-AS-201 that were specifically designed to select the most optimal dose of salmeterol.  
Relative Bioavailability from FS MDPI as Compared with Advair Diskus 
No formal relative bioavailability studies were performed with FS MDPI. However, systemic exposure 
was compared between FS MDPI and Advair Diskus.  
At comparable doses, systemic exposure was higher for both Fp and salmeterol after administration of 
FS MDPI low-, mid-, and high-dose strengths compared to Advair Diskus. Therefore, the applicant 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021

developed FS MDPI products at lower doses/strengths (delivered doses 50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 
200/12.5 mcg) than Advair Diskus/Seretide Accuhaler (100/50, 250/50, and 500/50 mcg); as those 
give lower systemic exposures of both Fp and salmeterol than the corresponding Advair 
Diskus/Seretide Accuhaler doses/strengths.  
The PK properties following administration with the combination inhaler, FS MDPI, were compared to 
that of the Advair Diskus inhaler. The systemic exposure of Fp and salmeterol after administration of 
FS MDPI relative to the Advair Diskus was evaluated from PK analyses in patients with asthma 
conducted with the “to be marketed formulation” in the Teva Phase 1 clinical Study FSS-AS-10042. It 
was shown that the highest proposed dose of FS MDPI (200/12.5 mcg) resulted in similar systemic 
exposure of Fp and lower systemic exposure of salmeterol than the highest marketed dose of Advair 
Diskus or Seretide Accuhaler (500/50 mcg).  
Although this study included a comparison of high- strength FS MDPI (200/12.5 mcg) to both Advair 
Diskus and Flovent Diskus, the comparison to Flovent Diskus is less directly comparable, since 2 
inhalations were used to administer the dose with the Flovent Diskus inhaler, whereas the high-dose 
strength was administered with 1 inhalation for both the FS MDPI and Advair Diskus inhalers. 
Post-hoc analyses of the dose-ranging Study FSS- AS-201 and PK Study FSS-AS-10042, however, 
showed that AUC0-30min for Fp and salmeterol from FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg was approximately 77% that 
of Advair Diskus. The ratio of geometric LS mean AUC0-30min between FS MDPI and Advair Diskus 
showed that salmeterol exposure from FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg was approximately 23% lower than 
from Advair Diskus 500/50 mcg. Although the overall systemic exposure with FS MDPI was only about 
50% of Advair Diskus, the effective dose delivered to the site of action, the lungs, was approximately 
77% of Advair Diskus. 
Based on in vitro and in vivo dose proportionality observed across strengths of the 2 products, the 
applicant considered that the low, mid-, and high-dose strength FS MDPI are expected to give lower 
systemic exposures and similar lung exposures to Fp and salmeterol than the corresponding low-, mid-
, and high-dose strengths of Advair Diskus. 
Bioequivalence  
No formal bioequivalence studies were conducted with FS MDPI. Since the FS MDPI clinical programme 
demonstrated efficacy and safety with replicate Phase 3 randomised control studies, bioequivalence 
was not assessed by the applicant. However, the systemic PK of FS MDPI has been compared to Advair 
Diskus.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Fluticasone Propionate (Fp) 
There is a linear increase in systemic exposure with increasing inhaled dose for Fp. 
There is no information regarding dose-proportionality of Fp exposure from FS MDPI. However, the 
dose-proportionality of Fp exposure has been evaluated in an exploratory manner for the identical Fp 
MDPI device. For Fp MDPI, the increase in exposure for Fp for both Cmax and AUC0-t was approximately 
proportional to dose for 50, 100, and 200 mcg across Studies FpS-AS-201 and FpS-AS-202.  
The same device is used for the FS MDPI and the Fp MDPI. After administration of Fp via the 
applicant’s Fp MDPI or the Advair Diskus devices, plasma Fp levels exhibited a rise with maximal 
concentrations occurring approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing and subsequently declined in a 
multiphasic manner. The t½ was approximately 10 hours.

Dose proportionality of AUC0-t and Cmax for Fp was evaluated in an exploratory manner by application 
of a power model to data from Study FpS-AS-201 and Study FpS-AS-202 (Table 6). 
Table 6: Fluticasone Propionate Dose Proportionality for Fp MDPI (Studies FpS-AS-
201 and FpS-AS-202) 
In addition, this was consistent with the in vitro proportionality of the delivered and aerodynamic 
performance between the 3 strengths, Fp MDPI 50, 100, and 200 mcg. 
Over the whole dose range of Fp MDPI 12.5 to 400 mcg, the increases in Fp AUC 0-t were 
approximately dose proportional while those for Cmax were slightly less than dose proportional. For the 
proposed strengths of Fp MDPI (50, 100, and 200 mcg), PK parameters for Fp increased in an 
approximately dose proportional manner, as indicated by 90% CI of the slopes that contain unity. 
Salmeterol 
After administration of salmeterol via FS MDPI or Advair Diskus, plasma salmeterol levels exhibited a 
rise with maximal concentrations occurring approximately 0.08 to 2 hours after dosing and 
subsequently declined in a multiphasic manner. The t½ was approximately 12 hours.  
Dose proportionality of AUC0-t and Cmax for salmeterol was evaluated in an exploratory manner by 
application of a power model to data from Study FSS-AS-201 (Table 7)

Table 7: Salmeterol Dose Proportionality for FS MDPI (Study FSS-AS-201) 
Over the whole dose range of FS MDPI 100/6.25 to 100/50 mcg, the increases in salmeterol AUC0-t 
and Cmax were slightly greater than dose proportional. For the proposed strength of FS MDPI 100/12.5 
and the bracketing strengths of FS MDPI 100/6.25 and 100/25 mcg, PK parameters for salmeterol 
increased in an approximately dose proportional manner, as indicated by 90% CI of the slopes that 
contain unity. 
In addition, this was consistent with the in vitro proportionality of the delivered and aerodynamic 
performance between the 3 strengths, FS MDPI 100/6.25, 100/12.5, and 100/50. 
Formulation 
The clinical development of FS MDPI was originally intended for the US market; therefore, the 
comparator product used in the clinical studies was the US combination product Advair Diskus. The 
applicant considered that Advair Diskus and the EU equivalent product (Seretide Accuhaler) can be 
considered to be clinically the same based on their comparability. The fixed-dose combination FS MDPI 
was formulated to achieve similar efficacy to Advair Diskus (Seretide Accuhaler), but with a lower 
nominal dose. This was thought that it was accomplished via improvement in the percentage of 
inhalable drug particles.

EMA/141972/2021

The Applicant was requested by CHMP to further justify the selected dose for salmeterol in FS MDPI. 
This is presented below.  
The formulation development for FS MDPI resulted in a higher amount of salmeterol fine particles 
fractions compared to salmeterol delivered from Advair Diskus. 
The overall systemic exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the 
time of the last measurable drug concentration [AUC0-t] ratio) and peak plasma concentration 
(maximum observed plasma drug concentration [Cmax] ratio) of salmeterol with FS MDPI is 
approximately 50% and 80%, respectively, that of Advair Diskus. Therefore, the dose selected for 
further clinical development, based on efficacy in the Phase 2 dose-ranging study, was 12.5 mcg. 
Relative to Advair Diskus, the systemic exposure ratio was 0.427 for the AUC0-t and 0.795 for the 
Cmax (Table 8 and Table 9). The final Phase 3 formulation was assessed in the Phase 1 crossover 
Study FSS-AS-10042, which showed that relative to Advair Diskus the systemic exposure ratio of 
salmeterol was 0.496 for the AUC0-t and 0.811 for the Cmax.

Table 9: Treatment Comparison of Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Salmeterol 
Between FS MDPI Dose Groups and ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50 mcg (Pharmacokinetic 
Analysis Set, Study FSS-AS-201) 
The AUC0-t represents the systemic exposure due to the drug absorbed by the lungs as well as any 
absorption of swallowed drug. For drugs that are rapidly absorbed via the lungs, like salmeterol, partial 
exposure data (AUC0-30min) can provide a good estimate of lung delivery because this represents 
exposure before orally absorbed drug reaches the systemic circulation. As advised in the CHMP 
Scientific Advice received (EMEA/H/SA/3754/1/2018/II), a post-hoc analysis of salmeterol 30 minutes 
exposure following administration with FS MDPI was compared to Advair Diskus. This post-hoc analysis 
of the partial AUC0- 30min and maximum observed plasma drug concentration in the first 30 minutes 
after administration (Cmax, 0-30min) for salmeterol in Study FSS-AS-10042 is included in Table 10. 
Specifically, FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg was compared to Advair Diskus 500/50 mcg and resulted in ratios 
of exposure for salmeterol Cmax, 0-30min and AUC0-30min of 0.843 and 0.766, respectively. 
Table 10: Treatment Comparison of Post-hoc Pharmacokinetic Parameters for 
Salmeterol (Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set, Study FSS-AS-10042) 
Similarly, a post-hoc analysis of the partial area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and 
Cmax for salmeterol in Study FSS-AS-201 is presented in table 26 below. The treatment comparison 
of FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg to Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg for salmeterol resulted in ratios for Cmax, 0-
30min and AUC0-30min of 0.925 and 0.848, respectively. The Applicant considered that the results 
indicated that the early exposure due to lung absorption is close to similar for the 2 products and well

within the range where comparable clinical efficacy could be expected. However, the strengths of these 
products are different. 
Furthermore, for orally inhaled drugs such as salmeterol, the overall systemic exposure results from 
both absorption at the site of action, the lungs, and orally absorbed drug that was swallowed, therefore 
the overall systemic exposure can be considered as a surrogate indicator for safety. In the applicant’s 
views, the fact that the overall systemic exposure to salmeterol is lower for FS MDPI than for Advair 
Diskus suggests a more favourable safety profile for FS MDPI (this is further discussed in section 2.6.1 
‘Discussion on clinical safety’).  
Specifically, when the comparison of the overall systemic exposure (AUC0-t) and the partial exposure 
(AUC0-30min) for salmeterol delivered by the 2 inhalers in 2 separate studies are considered side-by-
side, FS MDPI is delivered more efficiently to the lungs (AUC0-30min ratios of 0.766 to 0.848) 
compared to Advair Diskus, while providing an overall systemic exposure ratio that is lower (AUC0-t 
ratios of 0.427 to 0.496) compared to Advair Diskus (Table 11). 
Table 11: Comparison of Salmeterol Total Systemic Exposure and Partial Exposure 
with the FS MDPI Compared to ADVAIR DISKUS (Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set, 
Studies FSS-AS-10042 and FSS-AS-201) 
The efficacy of different doses of salmeterol was investigated in Study FSS-AS-201 (presented in 
section 2.5.1 ‘Dose response studies’ and discussed under section 2.5.3 ‘Discussion on clinical 
efficacy’). The comparison of the 4 strengths of salmeterol in FS MDPI compared to Advair Diskus 
showed that the 12.5-mcg strength of salmeterol in FS MDPI (100/12.5 mcg) best matched Advair 
Diskus 100/50mcg. Thus, the 12.5-mcg dose of FS MDPI (100/12.5 mcg) was selected based on the 
“matched efficacy” relative to Advair Diskus.  
Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination 
No additional studies have been performed with FS MDPI.   
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of inhaled Fp and salmeterol delivered in 
combination have been well described for Advair Diskus and Seretide Accuhaler.

The mean Cmax of Fp was approximately 62 pg/mL at nominal 200 mcg delivered from the FS MDPI in 
Study FSS-AS-10042 with a tmax of approximately 1 to 2 hours.  
The mean Cmax of salmeterol ranged from 16 to 155 pg/mL at the lowest and highest nominal doses 
(6.25 and 50 mcg, respectively) in Study FSS-AS-201 and was approximately 60 pg/mL at 12.5 mcg 
(nominal dose) in Study FSS-AS-10042. The tmax for salmeterol was generally 0.1 to 2 hours across 
both studies.  
The rate of absorption of Fp and salmeterol from FS MDPI could be compared to that from Advair 
Diskus, and both result in low concentrations of circulating Fp and salmeterol after inhalation of 
recommended doses. 
After intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for Fp was rapid and consistent with its 
high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of 
Fp bound to human plasma proteins averaged 99%. The percentage of salmeterol bound to human 
plasma proteins averaged 96% in vitro, at concentrations that are much higher than those achieved 
after administration of therapeutic doses of salmeterol. 
Fluticasone propionate has one circulating metabolite, the 17β-carboxylic acid derivative of Fp, which is 
formed through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 pathway. This metabolite has much lower affinity 
(approximately 1/2000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor and had negligible 
pharmacological activity in animal studies. Salmeterol base is extensively metabolised by hydroxylation 
to α-hydroxysalmeterol (aliphatic oxidation) by CYP3A4. 
The total clearance of Fp is high (average, 1093 mL/min), with poly-exponential kinetics. Less than 5% 
of a radiolabelled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites; the remainder was excreted in 
the faeces as parent drug and metabolites. Salmeterol elimination is predominantly as α-
hydroxysalmeterol in the faeces. 
Special populations 
In Study FSS-AS-10042, subgroup PK analyses by age group (12 to 17 years or ≥18 years) and by 
sex were performed. Although the subgroups were small, systemic exposure of Fp and salmeterol for 
all subgroups in all treatments was not markedly different from the overall study population. The t½ 
was not impacted by age or sex. 
In addition, a population PK analysis was performed for Fp and salmeterol using data from 9 controlled 
clinical studies that included 350 patients with asthma aged 4 to 77 years who received treatment with 
the comparator drug Advair Diskus, Advair HFA, Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA, or chlorofluorocarbon-
propelled Fp inhalation aerosol. These analyses showed no clinically relevant effects of age, sex, race, 
body weight, body mass index, or percent of predicted FEV1 on apparent clearance and apparent 
volume of distribution for either Fp or salmeterol. 
The effect of hepatic or renal dysfunction on the PK of Fp or salmeterol after administration from FS 
MDPI has not been studied. However, the applicant confirmed that there was no need to adjust the 
dose in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In Study FSS-AS-10042, the exposure of Fp was similar with and without co-administration of 
salmeterol in the MDPI device (Fp MDPI 200 mcg vs FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg). This is consistent with 
the finding that the in vitro performance of Fp, evaluated as delivered dose and fine particle dose, is 
equivalent when comparing the corresponding strengths of the mono and combination therapies.

No studies have been performed with FS MDPI to investigate the effect of Fp on salmeterol PK when 
given in combination. However, a study comparing salmeterol PK after administration of salmeterol 
100 mcg to salmeterol 100 mcg/Fp 500 mcg found that, although salmeterol plasma concentrations 
were measurable only during the first 0.5 hours after dosing, co-administration of Fp did not affect the 
Cmax of salmeterol. 
The population PK analysis from 9 controlled clinical studies in 350 patients with asthma showed no 
significant effects on Fp or salmeterol PK after co-administration with beta2-agonists, corticosteroids, 
antihistamines, or theophyllines. 
No studies have been performed with FS MDPI to investigate the potential for drug-drug interactions 
with other products. However, Fp PK have been studied in drug interaction studies with ritonavir, 
ketoconazole, and erythromycin and salmeterol PK have been studied in drug interaction studies with 
ketoconazole and erythromycin (Seretide Accuhaler SmPC). 
Because Fp and salmeterol are substrates of CYP3A4, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors have the potential to 
increase the plasma exposure of Fp (eg, ritonavir and ketoconazole) and salmeterol (eg, ketoconazole 
and erythromycin) (Seretide Accuhaler). The increased plasma Fp exposure associated with co-
administration with ritonavir and ketoconazole also resulted in reduction in serum cortisol area under 
the plasma concentration-time curve. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No studies with a PD component were conducted as part of the FS MDPI programme. 
In the Phase 3 long-term safety study (FSS-AS-305) using FS MDPI, 24-hour urinary cortisol was 
collected at baseline, at week 14, and at week 26 to study the effects of medium and high doses of Fp 
and FS MDPI on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. No significant differences across 
treatments were observed in 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion in patients 12 years of age and older 
with persistent asthma. Studies for Advair Diskus (see USPI 2019) were conducted with healthy adult 
subjects and in adult and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older with asthma to examine PD 
effects of Fp and salmeterol at therapeutic and higher doses. No significant differences were observed 
in any of the PD effects of salmeterol (pulse rate, blood pressure, QTc interval, potassium, and 
glucose) whether the salmeterol was given as Advair Diskus, concurrently with Fp from separate 
inhalers, or as salmeterol alone. Thus, the systemic PD effects of salmeterol were not altered by the 
presence of Fp in Advair Diskus.  Additionally, no significant differences across treatments were 
observed by salmeterol on the effects of Fp on the HPA axis (cortisol excretion and plasma cortisol 
level) (Seretide Accuhaler). No controlled study data with continuous 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) 
monitoring was collected using FS MDPI. 
The proposed SmPC (Section 4.5) provides information regarding the potential interactions, based on 
approved products containing one or more of these components. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The objective of the clinical pharmacology programme was to identify (low, mid and high) doses of Fp 
and salmeterol that could be comparable in efficacy but with lower systemic exposure than the 
marketed comparators Flovent Diskus and Advair Diskus. This rationale was based on the fact that 
most of the clinical benefit of ICS is achieved with low-dose ICS along with the fact that the ICS dose-
response curve is flat with little increase in efficacy with 2-fold increases in the dose. This suggested 
that there was room to reduce the ICS dose and corresponding exposure without loss of clinical 
efficacy, thus, providing benefit to patients. Indirect evidence was used to support the fact that the 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 57/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
doses of Fp and salmeterol demonstrated efficacy comparable to that of Flovent Diskus and Advair 
Diskus in Phase 2 studies.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Common methods for the PK analysis were used and were considered appropriate by CHMP. The 
standard PK parameters were investigated.  
No BE studies were performed by the applicant. A formal comparative bioavailability study between FS 
MDPI and Advair Diskus and/or a formal BE study between FS MDPI and Fp MDPI could have provided 
more useful information. However, as a full clinical programme was conduction by the applicant, this 
issue was not further pursued.  
Overall, dose proportionality of FS MDPI with respect to the PK parameters has been shown. However, 
the proposed doses contain significantly lower amounts of the active substances compared to the 
extensively studied and already marketed combination of Fp and salmeterol. Therefore, the applicant 
was requested by CHMP to justify the amount of salmeterol, which is considered very low compared to 
the amount in the already marketed products, with established efficacy/safety and with at least 20 
years post-marketing experience. In addition, the results for the AUC0-t for salmeterol were not of the 
same magnitude as those for the Cmax. AUC0-t for salmeterol is significantly lower, ~46% of the 
AUC0-t from Advair Diskus50/500mcg, when Cmax is ~74% of the Cmax from Advair Diskus. The 
Applicant clarified that the formulation of BroPair Spiromax (FS MDPI) was developed to achieve 
comparable efficacy to the ICS/LABA combination Advair Diskus (Seretide Accuhaler) and, importantly, 
to achieve this efficacy with a lower nominal dose. The applicant considered that the PK demonstrated 
that the overall systemic exposure was lower with FS MDPI compared to Advair Diskus, supporting the 
safety of FS MDPI. Furthermore, the use of 30-minute partial exposure data has been recognised as a 
mean to assess the efficacy of medicinal products, such as salmeterol, that are characterised by very 
rapid lung absorption and significant but delayed gastrointestinal absorption. Using this approach, the 
early exposure (AUC0-30min ratio) in the clinical studies comparing FS MDPI and Advair Diskus 
resulted in exposure ratios of 0.766 and 0.848, which could support that delivery to the lungs is not 
substantially less. This was acknowledged by CHMP. However, dose responses for both salmeterol and 
fluticasone are further discussed in section 2.5.3 ‘Discussion on clinical efficacy’.  
Based on an overall systemic exposure to salmeterol that is lower for FS MDPI than for Advair Diskus, 
a more favourable safety profile for FS MDPI is suggested by the applicant. However, this is further 
discussed in the clinical safety section 2.6.1. ).  
The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of inhaled Fp and salmeterol delivered in 
combination have been well described for the authorised Advair Diskus (US). Therefore, much of the 
data for these sections are referenced from the applicable prescribing information, with FS MDPI data 
included where applicable. This was considered acceptable by CHMP.  
The popPK analysis performed for Fp and salmeterol from comparators showed no clinically relevant 
effects of age, sex, race, body weight, body mass index, or percent of predicted FEV1 on apparent 
clearance and apparent volume of distribution for either Fp or salmeterol. In addition, in study FSS-AS-
10042, the PK of FS MDPI appears similar between adolescents and adults. BroPair is indicated for 
adolescents 12 years and older. No dosage adjustment is considered necessary. There is no need to 
adjust the dose in elderly patients or in patients with renal impairment. In addition, the effect of 
hepatic dysfunction on the PK of Fp or salmeterol after administration from FS MDPI has not been 
studied. This information have been adequately reflected in the SmPC, section 4.2.   
Pharmacodynamics 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 58/147 
 
 
 
The mechanism of action and the pharmacodynamic properties of both active substances have been 
studied and are well known from already approved products containing the same active substances 
and marketed for approximately 20 years. Therefore, no PD studies were conducted as part of the FS 
MDPI programme, which is acceptable by CHMP. The proposed SmPC provides adequate information 
regarding potential interactions.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK and PD of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol xinafoate with FS MDPI have been 
sufficiently characterised to support its approval for the treatment of asthma. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
A full clinical development programme for FS MDPI, including Phase 1 to Phase 3 studies and 2 
replicate pivotal Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies was conducted. A monotherapy of Fp MDPI, was 
included in many of the studies and is mentioned in this report, but the Fp MDPI monotherapy product 
is not part of this submission. 
The clinical development was originally intended for the US market; therefore, the comparator product 
used in the clinical studies was the US combination product Advair Diskus.  
Advair Diskus and the EU equivalent product (Seretide Accuhaler) can be considered to be clinically the 
same based on their comparability. The 2 inhalers use the same device and the same active ingredient 
combination of Fp and salmeterol in 12.5 mg lactose monohydrate. While the pre-dispensed (metered) 
dose strengths for Seretide Accuhaler and Advair Diskus are the same (100/50, 250/50, and 500/50 
mcg), there are minor differences in the delivered dose, which would not be expected to impact 
efficacy or safety. 
Furthermore, in vitro data demonstrating the comparability of Seretide Accuhaler to Advair Diskus 
were included in this application in line with the advice received from CHMP 
(EMEA/H/SA/3754/1/2018/II). The in vitro profile of an Advair Diskus batch used in the clinical study 
(FSS-AS-305) fell within the profile for marketed batches of Seretide Accuhaler, indicating that it was 
a good representative for Seretide Accuhaler. In addition, the PK characteristics described in the 
respective labels for Seretide Accuhaler and Advair Diskus were reviewed. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The salmeterol dose used in the Phase 3 clinical programme was chosen based on the efficacy results 
from a Phase 2 dose-finding study (Study FSS-AS-201) and the Fp doses used in the Phase 3 clinical 
programme were based on the efficacy results from 2 Phase 2 dose-ranging studies (FpS-AS-201 and 
FpS-AS-202). 
2.5.1.1.  Study FSS-AS-201 
This was a six-period crossover, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of four doses of 
FS Spiromax (Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol Xinafoate Inhalation Powder) administered as single 
doses compared with single doses of fluticasone propionate Spiromax and open label Advair Diskus in 
adult and adolescent subjects with persistent asthma.  
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the dose response, efficacy, and safety of 4 
different doses of salmeterol (6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mcg) each combined with a fixed dose of Fp (100 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 59/147 
 
 
 
mcg) delivered as FS MDPI when administered as a single dose in patients 12 years of age and older 
with persistent asthma. The primary efficacy endpoint was the baseline-adjusted area under the curve 
for the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) over 12 hours post dose (FEV1 AUC0-12).  
This was a Phase 2, multicentre, randomised, double-blind and open-label, active-controlled, single-
dose, 6-period crossover, dose-ranging study. After screening, eligible patients participated in a 14-
day run-in period, during which, patients discontinued their asthma medication and were provided with 
Fp MDPI 50 mcg. Patients were instructed to administer 2 inhalations of Fp MDPI 50 mcg bid. Patients 
were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences containing the following 6 treatment groups: 
Treatment A: FS MDPI 100/6.25 mcg, 1 inhalation bid; Treatment B: FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg 1 
inhalation bid; Treatment C: FS MDPI 100/25 mcg, 1 inhalation bid; Treatment D: FS MDPI 100/50 
mcg, 1 inhalation bid; Treatment E: Fp MDPI 100 mcg, 1 inhalation bid; Treatment F: Advair Diskus 
100/50 mcg, 1 inhalation bid.  
All treatments were double-blind, with the exception of Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg, which was open-
label. All patients were to participate in all 6 treatment periods and receive all 6 treatments. The 6 
treatments were separated by a washout period of 5 to 7 days. 
PK results for study FSS-AS-201 are presented in section 2.4.2 ‘Pharmacokinetics’.  
Safety results are presented and discussed in section 2.6 ‘Clinical safety.’ 
Efficacy results 
For the primary efficacy endpoint of baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUC0-12h, all formulations of FS MDPI 
were superior (p<0.0001) compared with Fp MDPI 100 mcg, indicating that the addition of salmeterol 
to the Fp formulation improved lung function in patients with asthma. Increases in FEV1 AUC0-12h 
ranged from 151.7 mL for FS MDPI 100/6.25 mcg to 251.3 mL for FS MDPI 100/50 mcg. The mean 
increase after Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg (241.9 mL) was similar to that seen after FS MDPI 100/12.5 
mcg (252.5 mL) and was also superior (p <0.0001) compared to the Fp MDPI 100 mcg formulation 
without salmeterol. 
The baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUC0-12h overall result (FAS) for FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was comparable 
to that for Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg (least squares [LS] mean 3.42 mL; p=0.8503). The FEV1 AUC0-
12h for the FS MDPI combination with a lower strength of salmeterol (100/6.25 mcg) was significantly 
lower than that for Advair Diskus (LS mean -41.7 mL; p<0.0229). Overall, there was a linear 
increasing trend in mean values with increasing doses of salmeterol. In the per-protocol analysis set, 
only FS MDPI 100/50 mcg was significantly superior to Advair Diskus (LS mean 60.29 mL, p=0.0011). 
While some differences were observed between treatment groups within some cohorts on some 
efficacy parameters, there was no trend in favour of or against any single treatment, and overall 
results provided support for the sustained efficacy of FS MDPI as measured by lung function and other 
important asthma functional endpoints. The demonstration of comparable efficacy results provides 
further evidence that the small differences in incidence of exacerbations in some of the MDPI groups 
were due to chance and not due to less efficacy of the MDPI treatment groups relative to the active 
control. 
The Applicant concluded that the clinical data demonstrated a dose response for the range of 
salmeterol doses tested in the Phase 2 Study FSS-AS-201 that were specifically designed to select the 
most optimal dose of salmeterol.

2.5.1.2.  Study FpS-AS-201 
This was a 12-Week dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fp Spiromax 
(Fluticasone Propionate Inhalation Powder) administered twice daily compared with placebo in 
adolescent and adult subjects with persistent asthma uncontrolled on nonsteroidal therapy. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the dose response, efficacy, and safety of 4 
different doses of Fp (12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mcg) delivered as Fp MDPI when administered bid in 
patients 12 years of age and older with persistent asthma who are uncontrolled on nonsteroidal 
therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in trough FEV1 over the 12-week 
treatment period.  
This was a Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and open-label active-controlled, parallel-
group, multicentre, dose-ranging study. The study consisted of a 14-day (±2 days) pre-treatment run-
in period, during which time, patients continued on their current asthma medications (i.e., non-
corticosteroid maintenance medication and short-acting beta 2 agonists [SABAs]). Patients were also 
instructed to administer 1 inhalation of placebo MDPI (single-blind) bid. 
Upon successful completion of the run-in period, patients who continued to meet eligibility criteria were 
randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups: Fp MDPI 12.5 mcg, 1 inhalation bid (25 mcg daily 
dose); Fp MDPI 25 mcg, 1 inhalation bid (50 mcg daily dose); Fp MDPI 50 mcg, 1 inhalation bid (100 
mcg daily dose); Fp MDPI 100 mcg, 1 inhalation bid (200 mcg daily dose); Placebo MDPI, 1 inhalation 
bid; Flovent Diskus 100 mcg, 1 inhalation bid (200 mcg daily dose).  
All treatments were double-blind, with the exception of Flovent Diskus 100 mcg, which was open-label. 
The treatment period lasted for 12 weeks. Plasma pharmacokinetic samples were obtained from a 
subset of patients before treatment and through 12 hours after administration of the first dose of study 
drug on day 1. 
PK results for study FpS-AS-201 are presented in section 2.4.2 ‘Pharmacokinetics’.  
Safety results are presented and discussed in section 2.6 ‘Clinical safety.’ 
Efficacy results 
The effect of Fp MDPI was seen on the primary and most secondary measures of asthma control within 
the first week and maintained over 12 weeks. For the primary efficacy endpoint of trough FEV1, there 
was an increase in LS mean FEV1 from baseline over the 12-week treatment period, with a statistically 
significantly greater change seen with Fp MDPI 25, 50, and 100 mcg groups when compared with 
placebo. The change from baseline in trough FEV1 over the 12-week treatment period with Fp MDPI 
12.5 mcg was not statistically significantly different from placebo. The magnitude of increases in FEV1 
with Fp MDPI suggest a dose response, with greater increases in FEV1 with higher doses of Fp MDPI. 
Results with Flovent Diskus appeared to be most consistent with the Fp MDPI 25 and 50 mcg groups. 
The change from baseline in trough FEV1 for all Fp MDPI groups was not significantly different when 
compared with Flovent Diskus. 
2.5.1.3.  Study FpS-AS-202 
This was a 12-week dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fp Spiromax (Fluticasone 
Propionate Inhalation Powder) administered twice daily compared with placebo in adolescent and adult 
subjects with severe persistent asthma uncontrolled on high dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the dose response, efficacy, and safety of 4 
different doses of Fp (50, 100, 200, and 400 mcg) delivered as Fp MDPI when administered bid in 
Assessment Report

patients 12 years of age and older with severe persistent asthma who are uncontrolled on high dose 
ICS therapy.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in trough FEV1 over the 12-week 
treatment period.  
This was a Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and open-label active-controlled, parallel-
group, multicentre, dose-ranging study. The study consisted of a 14-day (±2 days) pre-treatment run-
in period, during which, patients continued using their current asthma medications (i.e., SABA and ICS 
at fixed doses) and were also instructed to administer 1 inhalation of placebo MDPI (single-blind) bid. 
Upon successful completion of the run-in period, patients who continued to meet eligibility criteria were 
randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups: Fp MDPI 50 mcg, 1 inhalation bid (100 mcg daily 
dose); Fp MDPI 100 mcg, 1 inhalation bid (200 mcg daily dose); Fp MDPI 200 mcg, 1 inhalation bid 
(400 mcg daily dose); Fp MDPI 400 mcg, 1 inhalation bid (800 mcg daily dose); Placebo MDPI, 1 
inhalation bid; Flovent Diskus 250 mcg, 1 inhalation bid (500 mcg daily dose). 
All treatments were double-blind, with the exception of Flovent Diskus 250 mcg, which was open-label. 
The treatment period lasted for 12 weeks. Plasma PK samples were obtained from a subset of patients 
before treatment and through 12 hours after administration of the first dose of study drug on day 1. 
Efficacy results 
There was no statistically significant difference in the change in FEV1 from baseline over the 12-week 
period between the Fp MDPI dose group and placebo, but there was also no statistically significant 
difference between Flovent Diskus and placebo, indicating that the study did not have the sensitivity to 
detect differences in efficacy. 
Some differences were seen in favour of Fp MDPI compared with placebo in supportive analyses, 
particularly in the clinically relevant endpoints of rescue medication use and asthma exacerbations. 
The primary efficacy endpoint results showed that no treatment group, including Flovent Diskus, was 
superior to placebo MDPI in trough FEV1 change from baseline over 12 weeks. Treatment group 
differences were minimal. Numerically, the results for the Fp MDPI 100 and 200 mcg groups were the 
most similar to the results for Flovent Diskus (least squares [LS] mean differences from Flovent Diskus 
of -0.008 and 0.004, respectively). When last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used 
to calculate the trough FEV1 change from baseline to endpoint, Fp MDPI 200 mcg bid and Flovent 
Diskus 250 mcg bid were superior to placebo. The improvement in the Fp MDPI 200 mcg bid treatment 
arm was numerically higher than that in the Flovent Diskus 250 mcg bid treatment arm, but the 
difference was not statistically significant. As the Fp MDPI 200 mcg bid and Flovent Diskus 250 mcg bid 
treatment arms were less likely to have patients withdrawn from the study when compared to the 
placebo MDPI arm, an analysis using an LOCF approach was used to accommodate effects introduced 
from differential withdrawal rates observed in the study and in recognition that it has been used in 
other approved development programs such as Flovent Diskus. The secondary efficacy outcomes were 
similar in that no treatment group was clearly superior to placebo. Over the 12-week treatment period, 
change in weekly average AM PEF from baseline was not significant for any Fp MDPI dose levels 
compared with placebo; this was also true for the change in weekly average PM PEF from baseline. The 
percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods increased from baseline over the 12-week treatment period 
for all treatment groups; however, the difference from placebo was not statistically significant for any 
Fp MDPI group. The probability of remaining in the study (ie, not meeting stopping criteria for 
worsening asthma) at the end of the 12-week treatment period was significantly higher for all Fp MDPI 
treatment groups compared with placebo.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
To support the efficacy of FS MDPI, 2 replicate, multicentre, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-
group, 12-week Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies (FSS-AS- 301 and FSS-AS-30017) in adult and 
adolescent patients (12 years of age or older) with asthma were conducted. In addition to these 
studies, a 26-week, open-label, long-term safety study with comparator and substitution design was 
conducted (Study FSS-AS-305).  
The two replicate phase 3 efficacy and safety studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 will be presented 
together, followed by the long-term safety study FSS-AS-305.

Screening  
Study FSS-AS-301: Approximately 625 patients (125 per treatment arm) were planned for inclusion 
in the study. A subset, including approximately 300 patients at selected sites, was planned to perform 
additional serial spirometry testing at randomisation visit (RV) and week 12. The study consisted of a 
screening visit (SV), followed by a 14- to 21-day run-in period, a 12-week (±2 days) treatment period, 
and a 7-day (±2 days) follow-up period, for a total duration of patient participation in this study of

approximately 16 weeks. Patients also had the option to participate in a pre-screening period for up to 
30 days. 
Study FSS-AS-30017: Approximately 715 patients (143 per treatment arm) were planned for 
inclusion in the study. A subset, including approximately 300 patients at selected sites, was planned to 
perform additional serial spirometry testing at RV and week 12. The study consisted of a screening 
visit (SV) followed by a 14- to 21-day run-in period, a 12-week (±2 days) treatment period, and a 7-
day (±2 days) follow-up period, for a total duration of patient participation in this study of 
approximately 16 weeks. Patients also had the option to participate in a pre-screening period for up to 
30 days. 
Run-in period (Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017) 
Patients who met all selection criteria at the SV began a 14- to 21-day run-in period. 
Albuterol/salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) metered-dose inhaler (MDI), a SABA inhaler, was 
provided to replace the patient’s current rescue medication, and was to be used as needed for 
symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms during the run-in and treatment periods.  
During the run-in period in the Study FSS-AS 301, patients discontinued their current ICS and instead 
took 1 inhalation twice a day of a single-blinded placebo MDPI device and 1 puff twice a day of an 
open-label QVAR (beclomethasone dipropionate [a registered trademark of IVAX LLC, a member of the 
Teva Group]) 40 mcg HFA MDI (or equivalent). 
During the run-in period in the Study FSS-AS -30017, patients discontinued their current ICS and 
instead took 1 inhalation twice a day of a single-blinded Fp MDPI 50 mcg. 
Patients who failed screening for spirometry or for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 
reversibility were permitted to retest once within 7 days of the SV provided that they had met all other 
selection criteria. 
Study Participants (Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017) 
Main Inclusion Criteria  
a. Severity of Disease: The patient had persistent asthma with a FEV1 ≥40% and ≤85% of the value 
predicted for age, height, sex, and race as per the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
III (NHANES III) reference values at the SV. 
b. Current Asthma Therapy: Patients were required to have a treatment regimen that included a 
SABA (albuterol/salbutamol) for use as needed for a minimum of 8 weeks before the SV. Patients were 
required to have a low-dose or mid-dose of ICS (Study FSS-AS-301), a qualifying dose of ICS (Study 
FSS-AS-30017) as part of their asthma management plan, either as ICS monotherapy or as an 
ICS/LABA combination, for a minimum of 1 month before providing consent. 
Patients on ICS/LABA combination therapy were required to have a pre-screening visit in order to 
change to a comparable dose of ICS monotherapy. The ICS component of the patient’s asthma therapy 
was to be stable for a minimum of 1 month before the ICF was signed.  
c. Reversibility of Disease: The patient had demonstrated at least 15% reversibility (all patients) 
and at least a 200-mL increase from baseline FEV1 (patients age 18 and older) within 30 minutes after 
2 to 4 inhalations of albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI (90-mcg ex-actuator) or equivalent at the SV. 
Reversibility values of 14.50 to 14.99 were rounded to 15.  
Note: Patients who did not qualify for the study due to failure to meet reversibility were permitted to 
perform a retest once within 7 days or were considered a screen failure and permitted to rescreen once 
at least 7 days after the date of first screening.

d. Asthma diagnosis: The patient had a diagnosis of asthma as defined by the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH). The asthma diagnosis had been present for a minimum of 3 months and had been stable 
(defined as no exacerbations and no changes in asthma medication) for at least 30 days before the ICF 
was signed. 
Main Exclusion Criteria  
a. The patient had a history of a life-threatening asthma exacerbation that was defined for this protocol 
as an asthma episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory 
arrest, or hypoxic seizures. 
b. The patient currently smoked or had a smoking history of 10 pack-years or more (a pack-year was 
defined as smoking 1 pack of cigarettes/day for 1 year). The patient must not have used tobacco 
products within the past year (eg, cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, or pipe tobacco). The patient 
had a culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory 
tract, sinus, or middle ear that had not resolved at least 2 weeks before the SV.  
c.  The patient had an asthma exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids within 30 days before 
the SV or had any hospitalisation for asthma within 2 months before the SV. 
Treatments (Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017) 
Each qualified patient was randomly assigned to 1 of the 5 treatment groups. During the treatment 
period, each patient received the assigned active or placebo medication. All treatments were 
administered via Teva MDPI devices with identical external appearance, allowing the double-blind 
design to be preserved. All treatments were administered as a single inhalation twice a day. All 
patients were provided with study-specific rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol HFA MDI) for use 
on an as-needed basis for the immediate relief of asthma symptoms throughout the treatment period. 
Study drug was administered twice a day, in the morning (AM) and in the afternoon (PM), after the 
completion of the asthma symptoms score and the PEF measurements, in that order.

Simple size 
For Study FSS-AS-301, sample size and power calculations were mainly driven by demonstrating 
superiority of Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily over placebo in change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 
12 and the superiority of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily over Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily in 
standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h at week 12. 
For the superiority comparison of Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily versus placebo in change from 
baseline in trough FEV1 at week 12, assuming that the change from baseline in trough FEV1 at 
week 12 is analysed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with only a single factor of 
treatment group, that a true treatment difference is 130 mL between Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily and 
placebo, and that a common SD is 314 mL, then 106 patients per treatment group (a total of 530 
patients) yields an approximate statistical power of 85%, at a significance level of 0.05, for the 2-
sided superiority test of Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily versus placebo. The treatment effect and 
variability assumptions made for this power calculation were based on data collected in the applicant’s 
studies. 
For the superiority comparison of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily and Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily in 
standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h at week 12 in the serial spirometry subset, 
assuming that the standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC 0-12h at week 12 is analysed using an 
ANOVA model with only a single factor of treatment group, that a true treatment difference is 200 mL 
between FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily and Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily, and that a common SD is 
200 mL, then 48 patients per treatment group (a total of 240 patients) yields a statistical power of 
greater than 99%, at a significance level of 0.05, for the 2-sided superiority test of FS MDPI 50/12.5 
mcg twice daily versus Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice daily. The treatment effect and variability assumptions 
made for this power calculation were based on data collected in previous the applicant’s studies. 
Assuming a dropout rate of 15%, 125 patients per treatment group (a total of 625 patients, with 
a subset of approximately 300 patients who performed serial spirometry) yields a statistical power of 
at least 85%, at a significance level of 0.05, for demonstrating superiority of Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice 
daily over placebo and superiority of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg twice daily over Fp MDPI 50 mcg twice 
daily. 
For Study FSS-AS-30017, sample size and power calculations were mainly driven by demonstrating 
superiority of Fp MDPI 100 mcg twice daily over placebo in change from baseline in trough FEV1 at 
week 12 and the superiority of FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg twice daily over Fp MDPI 100 mcg twice daily in 
standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1, AUEC0-12h at week 12. 
For the superiority comparison of Fp MDPI 100 mcg twice daily versus placebo in change from 
baseline in trough FEV1 at week 12, assuming that the change from baseline in trough FEV1 at 
week 12 is analysed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with only a single factor of 
treatment group, that a true treatment difference is 130 mL between Fp MDPI 100 mcg twice daily and 
placebo, and that a common SD is 336 mL, then 121 patients per treatment group (a total of 605 
patients) yields an approximate statistical power of 85%, at a significance level of 0.05, for the 2-
sided superiority test of Fp MDPI 100 mcg twice daily versus placebo. The treatment effect and 
variability assumptions made for this power calculation are based on data collected in Teva studies.

only a single factor of treatment group, that a true treatment difference is 200 mL between FS MDPI 
100/12.5 mcg twice daily and Fp MDPI 100 mcg twice daily, and that a common SD is 200 mL, then

99%, at a significance level of 0.05, for the 2-sided superiority test of FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg twice 
daily versus Fp MDPI 100 mcg twice daily. The sample size of 300 patients performing serial 
spirometry assumes a dropout rate of up to approximately 20%. The treatment effect and variability 
assumptions made for this power calculation are based on data collected in previous Teva studies.  
Assuming a dropout rate of 15%, 143 patients per treatment group (a total of 715 patients, with 
a subset of approximately 300 patients who perform serial spirometry) yields a statistical power of at 
least 85%, at a significance level of 0.05, for demonstrating superiority of Fp MDPI 100 mcg twice daily 
over placebo and superiority of FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg twice daily over Fp MDPI 100 mcg twice daily. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) Studies FS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 
Study FSS-AS-301 was a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled randomised clinical study. 
Patients who met all randomisation criteria at the RV were randomly assigned to receive Fp MDPI 50 
mcg, Fp MDPI 100 mcg, FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg, FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg, or placebo MDPI in a 
1:1:1:1:1 ratio for the entire 12-week treatment period. Randomisation was assigned using interactive 
response technology (IRT). Approximately 125 patients were randomised into each treatment arm. 
After randomisation, patients and investigators remained blinded to randomised treatment assignment 
during the study. In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study were blinded to the 
study drug identity after the run-in period until the database was locked for analysis and the treatment 
assignment was revealed. 
Study FSS-AS-30017 was a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled randomized clinical 
study. Patients who met all randomisation criteria at the RV were randomly assigned to receive Fp 
MDPI 100 mcg, Fp MDPI 200 mcg, FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg, FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg, or placebo MDPI in 
a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio for the entire 12-week treatment period. Randomisation was assigned using 
interactive response technology. Approximately 143 patients were randomised into each treatment 
arm. After randomisation, patients and investigators remained blinded to randomised treatment 
assignment during the study. In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study were 
blinded to the study drug identity after the run-in period until the database was locked for analysis and 
the treatment assignment was revealed.   
Statistical methods (Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017) 
Hypothesis: These were superiority trials. The list of primary and secondary endpoints controlled for 
Type I error under Multiplicity section is included below. 
Primary endpoint and analysis 
The primary analysis of trough FEV1 was conducted in FAS, and FEV1 AUECO0-12h in Serial 
Spirometry Subset, whereas supportive analyses in ITT and PP. 
The baseline FEV1 was the average of the 2 pre-dose FEV1 measurements (30 and 10 minutes pre-
dose) at the RV. If 1 pre-dose FEV1 measurement was missing, the other non-missing measurement 
was used as baseline; if both pre-dose FEV1 measurements were missing, baseline was treated as 
missing. In order to account for missing data, the modified baseline observation carried forward 
(BOCF) method was implemented. 
The analysis of change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 12 was performed using an ANCOVA 
model with effects due to baseline trough AM FEV1, sex, age, (pooled) centre, previous therapy (ICS 
or ICS/LABA), and treatment. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 71/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Baseline-adjusted FEV1 was calculated as post-dose FEV1 after subtracting the baseline FEV1 value. If 
a patient was missing post-dose spirometry measurements intermittently, then those missing values 
were ignored, and the trapezoidal rule simply spanned the missing timepoint(s). 
The analysis of standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h was performed using an ANCOVA 
model with fixed effects of treatment, sex, (pooled) centre, previous therapy (ICS or ICS/LABA), and 
with covariates of age and baseline FEV1. For those serial spirometry patients who did not perform 
serial spirometry at week 12, missing data were imputed via LOCF, which is the last observed serial 
spirometry, performed either ET (early termination) or TV1 (baseline). A sensitivity analysis used a 
modified BOCF method, where the post-dose value of FEV1 at TV1 was used. 
Sensitivity analyses: 
- 
- 
A cumulative proportion of responders analysis (CPRA) graph (Farrar et al, 2006) was provided for 
the change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 12 
Tipping Point Analysis for change from baseline in trough FEV1 at Week 12. This is a sensitivity 
analysis utilizing multiple imputations under the MNAR assumption. 
-  Other Multiple Imputation Sensitivity Analysis for Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 at Week 
12. Like the tipping point analysis, this analysis described utilizes multiple imputations under the 
MNAR assumption for those patients who withdrew due to worsening asthma. Missing data for 
patients who withdrew for other reasons are treated as MAR. 
- 
Sensitivity Analysis for Standardised Baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h at Week 12: For those 
serial spirometry patients who withdrew due to worsening of asthma, and did not perform serial 
spirometry at week 12, missing data were to be imputed via BOCF. For patients who withdrew due 
to other reasons, missing data were to be imputed via LOCF, which is the last observed serial 
spirometry performed either ET or TV1 will be carried forward. 
Analysis sets 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomised patients. Treatment was assigned based 
upon the treatment to which patients were randomised regardless of which treatment they received. 
The ITT population served as the supportive population for efficacy analyses. 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug and had at least 1 postbaseline trough FEV1 assessment. The FAS served as the primary 
analysis set for efficacy analyses. Pulmonary function test data could be excluded from the FAS for 
visits in which patients took (within 7 days of the visit) any of a limited subset of prohibited asthma 
medications that could significantly confound interpretation. These medications were oral or systemic 
corticosteroids; LABAs or long-acting muscarinic antagonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists/5-
leukotriene oxidase inhibitors (eg, zileuton [ZYFLO (Cornerstone Therapeutics)]); and oral B-agonists. 
A blinded statistical data review (SDR) meeting was conducted before database lock in order to 
determine and document the PFT data excluded from the FAS.  
The per-protocol (PP) population included all data from randomised patients prior to experiencing a 
major protocol violation and who had greater than 80% compliance to the study drug over the entire 
treatment period. Patient diary data were the primary source for the compliance calculations, unless 
otherwise specified. Major protocol violations were determined prior to unblinding. Note that since the 
use of incorrect study drug was considered a major protocol violation, for treatment assignment in the 
PP population, “as randomised” coincided with “as treated.” The PP population served as the supportive 
population for the primary efficacy analysis only.

EMA/141972/2021

The safety population included all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. In 
this population, treatment was assigned based upon the treatment patients actually received 
regardless of the treatment to which they were randomised. The safety population was used for all 
analyses of safety data. 
Serial Spirometry Subset. A subset of approximately 300 patients who performed post-dose serial 
spirometry was used for the primary endpoint of the standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h 
at week 12 and for other postdose spirometry endpoints. These patients were enrolled at 
investigational centres that were preselected based on their capabilities and prior experience with 
serial spirometry. If an investigational centre was designated as a serial investigational centre, then all 
patients at that investigational centre were serial spirometry patients. Patients could not opt out of 
serial spirometry participation. 
Missing data 
For the primary endpoint of change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 12, missing data caused by 
early dropout from the study were handled by penalizing the positive change from baseline in trough 
FEV1 score using a baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) method. This method assigned these 
patients a change from baseline in trough FEV1 score of zero, thus the discontinued patients were 
treated as failures and were assigned a poor score. Discontinued patients that have negative change 
from baseline with last non-missing FEV1 score did not have their results adjusted, since their scores 
was already poor.  
For the supporting primary endpoint of standardised baseline-adjusted trough FEV1 AUEC0-12wk, 
missing data were handled similarly.  
For the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), there were no imputation for missing data. For 
the ANCOVA model, except for the primary endpoint change from FEV1 at week 12 and the 
standardised baseline-adjusted trough FEV1 AUEC0-12wk, missing data were imputed via last 
observation carried forward (LOCF). 
For the tipping point sensitivity analysis, missing FEV1 values were imputed for patients who 
discontinued treatment before the week 12 visit. Missing FEV1 values in the placebo group are 
assumed missing at random (MAR). Missing FEV1 values for the active treatment groups were imputed 
in the same manner, but then a constant (positive value) shift was subtracted from the imputed FEV1 
values. The initial shift value was zero (representing MAR) and it then was increased, and the process 
repeated until the treatment effect is no longer significant at the 5% level. Similar to the tipping point 
analysis, the other sensitivity analysis described utilizes multiple imputations under the missing not at 
random (MNAR) assumption for those patients who withdrew due to worsening asthma. Missing data 
for patients who withdrew for other reasons are treated as MAR. 
Multiplicity 
FSS-AS-301: A fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure was used to control the overall Type I error 
rate at the 0.05 level (2-sided) for the primary endpoints analysis. The same testing sequence was 
used in FSS-AS-30017: for Standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h at week 12:  1) FS 
200/12.5 vs Fp200, 2)FS 100/12.5 vs Fp 100, 3) FS200/12.5 vs Placebo, 4) FS 100/12.5 vs Placebo; 
for trough FEV1: 5) FS200/12.5 vs Placebo, 6) FS100/12.5 vs Placebo, 7) Fp200 vs Placebo, 8) Fp100 
vs Placebo. 
If the p-value was less than 0.05 for all inferential comparisons for the primary analysis, then 
inferential testing was extended to the secondary analysis.

secondary endpoints, and the sequence of the multiple testing procedures for the secondary endpoints. 
The changes are based on feedback from regulatory authorities. This revision was considered 
substantial. Non-substantial revisions have been made to the protocol (and protocol synopsis, as 
appropriate). 
The primary reason for Amendment 02 Dated 19 February 2015 was the change to the inclusion 
criteria to allow patients on low-dose and mid-dose ICSs to participate in this study which evaluates 
the efficacy of both low-dose and mid-dose ICS containing study drugs. This revision was considered to 
be substantial. Other non-substantial revisions were made to the protocol (and protocol synopsis, as 
appropriate). 
The primary reason for Amendment 01 Dated 17 November 2014 was the change to the primary 
endpoint as requested by FDA on 19 July 2014. This revision was considered to be substantial. 
Additionally, there was a clarification to when a severe asthma exacerbation would be considered a 
serious adverse event. Other non-substantial revisions were made to the protocol (and protocol 
synopsis, as appropriate). 
Study FSS-AS-30017 
There were 4 global amendments to the protocol for this study and 3 administrative letters. Changes 
to the protocol were considered to have no negative impact on the safety of patients already enrolled 
into the study at the time of each amendment.  
A protocol version specific to Canada (dated 31 July 2014) was needed to satisfy a Health Canada 
requirement that patients be informed about study drugs given during the run-in period. Therefore, 
while the global protocol specifies single-blind placebo during the run-in period, the protocol for 
investigational centres in Canada specifies open-label placebo. Updated versions of the country-specific 
protocol were issued with subsequent amendments to the global protocol.  
Amendment 1 (dated 02 December 2014) to the protocol was issued after 147 patients had been 
enrolled into the study. 
The following major procedural changes (not all-inclusive) were made to the protocol: 
-  Rescreening and retesting procedures for spirometry and reversibility were clarified. 
- 
Spirometry procedures were updated from 5 to 8 permissible efforts per test.  
-  Clarification was provided about when a severe asthma exacerbation would be considered a 
serious adverse event. 
Amendment 2 (dated 10 December 2014) to the protocol was issued when 147 patients had been 
enrolled into the study to correct the EudraCT number on the signature page. 
Amendment 3 (dated 19 February 2015) to the protocol was issued when 543 patients had been 
enrolled into the study. 
The following major procedural changes (not all-inclusive) were made to the protocol: 
- 
Inclusion criteria were updated to allow patients who had had changes in their ICS treatment 
over 1 month prior to screening to participate.

Amendment 4 (dated 09 April 2015) to the protocol was issued when 602 patients had been enrolled 
into the study. 
The following major procedural changes (not all-inclusive) were made to the protocol: 
- 
Based on discussions with the US FDA, the analysis of the primary endpoint of change from 
baseline in trough FEV1 was changed from over the 12-week treatment period to at week 12, 
and the primary endpoint for serial spirometry was specified as standardised baseline-
adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h  at week 12 (TV9). 
- 
As recommended by the FDA for a similar study, the CPRA graph was added to examine all 
possible response levels of interest. 
-  Related to the change in the primary endpoint, the analysis methods were changed, the 
methods for handling missing data were modified, and the sequential order of comparisons 
was adjusted.  
- 
- 
Statistical power considerations were recalculated based on the change in the primary 
endpoint and on newly available data from Teva studies. 
A subgroup analysis by region (US and non-US) was added. 
Baseline data 
Study FSS-AS-301 
The treatment groups were similar with regard to age (mean age ranged from 40.6 to 43.3 years 
across groups), sex (slightly over half female in all groups), race (approximately three-quarters white 
in all groups), and BMI (mean BMI ranged from 27.63 to 28.00 kg/m2 across groups). The FAS was 
nearly identical to the ITT population in these characteristics. In the serial spirometry subset, which 
included about half as many patients as the ITT population, mean ages were slightly younger, the 
proportions of patients who were black were greater, the proportions of patients who were Hispanic or 
Latino were greater, and mean BMIs were slightly greater relative to the ITT population. 
Study FSS-AS-30017 
The treatment groups were similar with regard to age (mean age ranged from 44.3 to 45.7 years 
across groups), sex (approximately 60% female in all groups), race (approximately 80% white in all 
groups), and BMI (mean BMI ranged from 29.3 to 30.2 kg/m2 across groups). The FAS was nearly 
identical to the ITT population in these characteristics. In the serial spirometry subset, which included 
under half as many patients as the ITT population, mean ages were slightly younger, the proportions 
of patients who were black were greater, and mean BMIs were slightly greater relative to the ITT 
population. 
All patients enrolled in the study were required to have persistent asthma. Baseline spirometry results 
were generally similar between patients across treatment groups; mean FEV1 ranged from 2.069 L to 
2.157. Among the 120 (16%) patients overall who were prior smokers, the proportions did not differ 
greatly across treatment groups. However, mean numbers of pack-years ranged from 2.9 for FS MDPI 
200/12.5 mcg to 4.8 for Fp MDPI 200 mcg. The proportions of patients whose previous asthma therapy 
included an ICS/LABA ranged from 50% (73 of 146 patients in the FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg group) to 
60% (88 of 146 patients in the Fp MDPI 100 mcg group; Table 19). The FAS was nearly identical to the 
ITT population in these characteristics.

Table 15: (Summary of Clinical Efficacy): Baseline Disease Characteristics by 
Treatment Group (Intent-to-Treat Population) 
Numbers analysed 
Jointly in 2 studies, 1375 patients were randomised to Fp MDPI, FS MDPI, or placebo treatment, and of 
those patients, 1360 were included in the FAS population. The majority of patients in all treatment 
groups in the FAS population completed the study. 
Only 9% of patients overall discontinued the studies prematurely. The most common reasons for 
discontinuation overall were withdrawal by subject, disease progression, adverse events, and lack of 
efficacy. 
In both studies, proportionally more patients who received placebo treatment (55 [20%] patients) 
discontinued from the studies than those who received Fp MDPI or FS MDPI treatment (30 [5%]

patients in the combined FS MDPI group). This disparity is due to discontinuation due to disease 
progression (3 [<1%] patients in the combined FS MDPI groups), lack of efficacy (1 [<1%] patient in 
the combined FS MDPI groups), and adverse events (7 [1%] patients in the combined FS MDPI 
groups), all of which were higher in the placebo group than in the Fp MDPI or FS MDPI groups. The 
proportion of patients completing or discontinuing the studies were similar in the Fp MDPI and FS MDPI 
groups. 
In both Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017, the difference in the number of patients was minimal 
between the FAS and ITT populations, which were used as the primary and supportive populations, 
respectively, for the efficacy analyses. 
In Study FSS-AS-301, the ITT population included 647 patients. The FAS included 640 patients, 
reflecting the exclusion of 7 patients relative to the ITT population, as follows (by definition, patients 
who were randomised but not treated were included in the ITT population for analysis, but excluded 
from the FAS population). Of these 7 patients excluded from the FAS (of which one did not meet 
selection criteria and 6 did not meet randomisation criteria but was randomised in error), only 1 
patient was treated with study drug. 
In Study FSS-AS-30017, the ITT population included 728 patients. The FAS included 720 patients, 
reflecting the exclusion of 8 patients relative to the ITT population. Of these 8 patients excluded from 
the FAS (of which 3 did not meet selection criteria and 2 did not meet randomisation criteria and were 
not treated but were randomised in error, only 3 patients were treated with study drug. 
Table 16: (Summary of Clinical Efficacy): Patient Disposition by Treatment Group 
(All Patients, Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 Pooled) 
The exclusion of less than 1% of the patients and approximately 9% discontinuations are not expected 
to have an impact on the outcome of the studies.

Outcomes and estimation 
Study FSS-AS-301 
Primary endpoints 
All comparisons of interest were statistically significant for both co-primary endpoints following the 
fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure (results for the FAS are shown in the below Table). Results 
in the ITT and PP populations were nearly identical to those in the FAS. For both endpoints, 
improvements were greater in the FS MDPI and Fp MDPI groups than in the placebo group, and greater 
in the FS MDPI groups than in the Fp MDPI groups, supporting the additional benefit of the salmeterol 
xinafoate (Sx) in combination with fluticasone propionate (Fp). Serial spirometry results showed that 
the immediate improvements observed in the active treatment groups were sustained over the 12 
hours of testing, and the PD profile was consistent with a twice-daily dosing regimen. Results were 
robust in supportive and sensitivity analyses. In subgroup analyses, results for active treatment groups 
were numerically superior to those for placebo for both endpoints and were generally comparable to 
findings for the overall FAS.

(FAS) 
Comparisons of combination therapy with monotherapy were not controlled for multiplicity but 
indicated improvement for FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg compared with Fp MDPI 50 mcg (p=0.0022) and Fp 
MDPI 100 mcg (p=0.0166) and for FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg compared with Fp MDPI 100 mcg 
(p=0.0202) in Study FSS-AS-301 (Table 18).

Treatment Group (Full Analysis Set, Study FSS-AS-301)
Secondary endpoints 
Results of secondary efficacy analyses further support the conclusion that treatment with Fp MDPI and 
FS MDPI was associated with improved lung function and the additional benefit of combination therapy, 
as follows:  
-  Results for FS MDPI and Fp MDPI 100 mcg were statistically significantly superior to placebo 
for change from baseline in the weekly average of daily trough AM PEF over 12 weeks, 
change from baseline in the weekly average of total daily asthma symptom score over weeks 
1 to 12, and change from baseline in the weekly average of total daily rescue medication use 
over weeks 1 to 12 (and there was a trend in favour of Fp MDPI 50 mcg for the latter 2 of 
these 3 endpoints). There was a trend in favour of each active treatment group relative to 
placebo for change from baseline in AQLQ(S).  
-  Combination therapy was statistically significantly superior to monotherapy for daily trough 
AM PEF, and numerically superior for the other endpoints. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 81/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
For withdrawal because of worsening asthma, only 7 patients overall met the criteria (4 
patients in the placebo group, 0 patients in the FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg group, and 3 in the 
other active treatment groups).  
-  Differentiation between Fp MDPI and FS MDPI treatments was evident, particularly for 
weekly average of the daily trough AM PEF.  
-  Results for the important secondary endpoint of time to 15% and 12% improvement from 
baseline in FEV1 post-dose at TV1 (after the first dose) showed that FS MDPI was superior to 
placebo. Ad hoc analyses of time to onset of these improvement thresholds showed that 
improvements in asthma control occurred within 15 minutes of inhaled administration for 
approximately one-fifth of patients treated in the FS MDPI groups. 
Other efficacy variables 
Findings for other efficacy variables were consistent with the outcomes for the primary and secondary 
variables, including the following details:  
- 
The proportions of patients who met asthma alert criteria were 24% in the placebo group 
compared with 7% to 15% in the active treatment groups, and there was apparent dose-
associated separation within the Fp MDPI and FS MDPI treatments.  
-  Mean decreases in rescue medication use from baseline to day 14 were greater for FS MDPI 
and Fp MDPI than for placebo, and greater for FS MDPI than for Fp MDPI. This was also true 
at subsequent weeks and at endpoint. Dose-dependent differentiation within the Fp MDPI 
and FS MDPI groups was not evident. 
-  Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free, symptom-free, and asthma-control 
days was greater for FS MDPI than for Fp MDPI and placebo. Change from baseline for 
symptom-free and asthma-control days appeared to be dose-dependent for FS MDPI but not 
for Fp MDPI.  
-  Change from baseline for trough FVC and trough FEF25-75 supported the findings for FEV1. 
- 
The proportions of patients who experienced a clinically significant change from baseline in 
the AQLQ(S) were similar between placebo and Fp MDPI at just under half of patients, and 
the proportions for FS MDPI were slightly over half of patients. Dose-associated separation 
was observed for FS MDPI but not for FP MDPI.  
-  Change from baseline in ACT scores showed statistically significant differences in change 
from baseline for all active treatments compared with placebo. At each assessment and 
overall, the FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg group had the smallest proportions of patients with ACT 
scores ≤19, and proportions were greatest for placebo. Effects appeared to be dose-
dependent for FS MDPI but not Fp MDPI. 
Study FSS-AS-30017 
Primary endpoints 
All comparisons of interest were statistically significant for both co-primary endpoints following the 
fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure when analysed for both the FAS and the ITT population 
(results for the FAS are shown in Table 19) and, with the exception of FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg 
compared with Fp MDPI 200 mcg for trough FEV1, for the PP population. For both endpoints, 
improvements were greater in the FS MDPI and Fp MDPI groups than in the placebo group, and greater 
in the FS MDPI groups than in the Fp MDPI groups, supporting the additional benefit of the Sx in 
combination with Fp. Serial spirometry results showed that the improvements observed in the active

treatment groups were sustained over the 12 hours of testing, and the PD profile was consistent with a 
twice-daily dosing regimen. Results were robust in supportive and sensitivity analyses. In subgroup 
analyses, results for active treatment groups were numerically superior to those for placebo for both 
endpoints and were generally comparable to findings for the overall FAS.

Results suggest some dose-associated differentiation between the higher and lower doses for Fp MDPI 
for trough AM and PM PEF over the 12-week treatment period, change from baseline in AQLQ(S) score 
and proportion of patients with an MID for AQLQ(S) or PAQLQ(S), and change from baseline in rescue 
medication use and in percentage of rescue-free days. Some differentiation was also evident for FEV1, 
FEF 25-75, and FVC at each visit, mainly for Fp MDPI but also for FS MDPI to a lesser extent. Slight 
differentiation between the higher and lower doses for FS MDPI was evident for percentage of 
symptom-free days and percentage of asthma-control days.

Secondary endpoints 
Results of secondary efficacy analyses further support the conclusion that treatment with Fp MDPI and 
FS MDPI was associated with improved lung function and the additional benefit of combination therapy, 
as follows: 
-  Results for FS MDPI and Fp MDPI were each statistically significantly superior to placebo for 
change from baseline in the weekly average of daily trough AM PEF over 12 weeks, change 
from baseline in the weekly average of total daily asthma symptom score over weeks 1 to 
12, change from baseline in the weekly average of total daily rescue medication use over 
weeks 1 to 12, time to withdrawal for worsening asthma, and change from baseline in 
AQLQ(S). 
- 
All comparisons of combination therapy to monotherapy showed statistically significant 
differences in favour of combination therapy for daily trough AM PEF; the comparison of FS 
MDPI 200/12.5 mcg with Fp MDPI 200 mcg was statistically significant for asthma symptom 
scores and for rescue medication use. Results for combination therapy were numerically 
superior to monotherapy for the other secondary endpoints except for time to withdrawal for 
worsening asthma.  
- 
Twenty (14%) patients in the placebo group and 9 (1.6%) in all active treatment groups 
were withdrawn because of worsening asthma.  
-  Differentiation between Fp MDPI and FS MDPI treatments was evident for most secondary 
endpoints.  
-  Results for the important secondary endpoint of time to 15% and 12% improvement from 
baseline in FEV1 postdose at TV1 (after the first dose) showed that FS MDPI was superior to 
placebo. Ad hoc analyses of time to onset of these improvement thresholds showed that 
improvements in asthma control occurred within 15 minutes of inhaled administration for 
21% of patients treated with FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and for 34% of patients treated with FS 
MDPI 200/12.5 mcg. 
Other efficacy variables 
Findings for other efficacy variables were consistent with the outcomes for the primary and secondary 
variables, including the following details: 
- 
The proportions of patients who met asthma alert criteria were 38% in the placebo group 
compared with 9% to 18% in the active treatment groups.  
-  Mean decreases in rescue medication use from baseline to day 14 were greater for FS MDPI 
and Fp MDPI than for placebo, and greater for FS MDPI than for Fp MDPI. This was also true 
at subsequent weeks and at endpoint. Dose-dependent differentiation within the Fp MDPI 
and FS MDPI groups was evident at all weeks. 
-  Change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free, symptom-free, and asthma-control 
days was greater for FS MDPI than for Fp MDPI and placebo. Change from baseline for 
rescue-free days appeared to be dose-dependent for Fp MDPI, and change for symptom-free 
and asthma-control days appeared to be dose-dependent for FS MDPI but not for Fp MDPI.  
-  Change from baseline for trough FVC and trough FEF25-75 supported the findings for FEV1.  
- 
The proportions of patients who experienced a clinically significant change from baseline in 
the AQLQ(S) were lower for placebo (34%) than active treatment groups (38% to 48%).

-  Change from baseline in ACT showed notable differences (p<0.05) from baseline for all 
active treatments compared with placebo. At each assessment and overall, the FS MDPI 
100/12.5 mcg group had the smallest proportions of patients with ACT scores ≤19, and 
proportions were greatest for placebo. 
Study FSS-AS-301 and Study FSS-AS-30017 
Primary efficacy endpoints in placebo-controlled Phase 3 asthma studies 
All primary FEV1 endpoint comparisons of interest as specified in the fixed-sequence multiple testing 
procedure were statistically significant (p<0.05). FS MDPI achieved greater increases from baseline 
FEV1 in the comparisons between FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg and Fp MDPI 50 mcg, between FS MDPI 
100/12.5 mcg and all 3 Fp MDPI doses, and between FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg and Fp MDPI 200 mcg, 
demonstrating, according to the applicant, the clinical benefit of adding salmeterol to Fp in the FS 
MDPI. 
The improvement in FEV1 was sustained over the 12-week duration of both studies. Benefit in lung 
function was demonstrated for all doses of FS MDPI, including the low dose strength of 50/12.5 mcg 
compared to placebo.  
There was an apparent dose-dependent increase in trough FEV1 following Fp MDPI monotherapy 
treatment in both studies that was more pronounced in Study FSS-AS-30017 (Figure 10). No 
apparent trend in dose-dependency in trough FEV1 was observed after FS MDPI combination 
treatment; this finding is likely due to the fixed dose of salmeterol in the FS MDPI treatment groups 
that masks any dose-response contribution from Fp. 
Figure 10: Mean change from baseline in trough FEV1 at each visit by treatment 
group (Study FSS-AS-301 and Study FSS-AS-30017) 
Results of the primary endpoint analysis of standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h at week 12 
in both studies achieved statistical significance (p<0.05) in comparisons between all FS MDPI doses 
against corresponding Fp MDPI doses and both FS and Fp MDPI compared with placebo.  
No dose-dependent trends were apparent after 12 weeks of treatment with FS MDPI. Relative to 
treatment visit 1 (TV1), serial spirometry findings at week 12 showed improvements in the FS MDPI 
treatment groups that were not seen in the placebo group; this was particularly apparent in Study 
FSS-AS-30017 (Figure 11 and Figure 12). These serial spirometry results confirm that the bid dosing 
regimen is appropriate for FS MDPI.

50 and 100 mcg doses, respectively (Figure 13 and Figure 14 respectively). There were also 
improvements for FS MDPI 50/12.5 and 100/12.5 mcg doses compared with Fp MDPI 100 and 200 
mcg doses, respectively. Results for the standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h based on

Overall, in both studies, all comparisons of interest were statistically significant for both co-primary 
endpoints following the fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure when analysed for both the FAS and 
ITT population. For both endpoints, improvements were greater in the FS MDPI and Fp MDPI groups. 
Serial spirometry results showed that the immediate improvements observed in the active treatment

regimen. Results were robust in supportive and sensitivity analyses. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints in placebo-controlled Phase 3 asthma studies 
Secondary efficacy variables were analysed using the FAS. Because all primary endpoint comparisons 
as specified in the fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure were statistically significant, inferential 
testing was extended to the secondary efficacy endpoints. The secondary efficacy results for Studies 
FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 are shown in Table 21.

Analysis of Change From Baseline in Trough FEV1 at Week 12 and Standardised Baseline-Adjusted FEV1 
AUEC0-12h From Serial Spirometry (Side by Side Comparison) 
The change from baseline in trough FEV1 over the 12-week treatment period is shown in Figure 1 
(Study FSS-AS-301) and Figure 2 (Study FSS-AS-30017). The mean treatment differences in the 
change from baseline in trough FEV1 for the Fp MDPI and FS MDPI treatment groups versus placebo 
are shown graphically in Figure 15. Statistical significance (p<0.05) was achieved in all FS MDPI doses 
compared to placebo. 
In the comparison of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg compared to Fp MDPI 50 mcg, FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg 
compared to all 3 Fp MDPI doses, and for FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg compared to Fp MDPI 200 mcg, FS 
MDPI showed an improvement, with greater increases from baseline FEV1 compared to Fp MDPI 
(unadjusted p<0.05). 
The mean treatment differences in the change from baseline in trough FEV1 for Fp MDPI versus FS 
MDPI are shown graphically in Figure 16. In the comparison of FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg to Fp MDPI 50 
mcg, FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg to all 3 Fp MDPI doses, and FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg to Fp MDPI 200 mcg, 
FS MDPI showed an improvement, with greater increases from baseline FEV1 compared to Fp MDPI 
(unadjusted p<0.05). 
There was an apparent dose-dependent increase in trough FEV1 following Fp MDPI monotherapy 
treatment in both studies that was more pronounced in Study FSS-AS-30017. No trends to dose 
dependency were observed following FS MDPI combination treatment for FEV1. Treatment with Fp

0.151 L in FSS-AS-301 and 0.123 L in FSS-AS-30017). 
Change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 12 in the 2 Phase 3 studies (FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-
30017) are presented for the ITT population and are almost identical to the results for the FAS.

presents observed values; no missing data imputation was performed. Over the 12-week treatment period, 
proportionally more patients in the placebo group (26%) discontinued treatment than patients in the FS MDPI 
treatment groups (6% to 7%). This disparity was due to discontinuations due to disease progression (12% for 
patients in the placebo group versus ≤1% for patients in the FS MDPI groups), lack of efficacy (5% versus 0%, 
respectively), and withdrawal by patient (5% versus 1% to 2%, respectively).

Fp100 and FS groups showed statistically significant improvement vs Placebo 
in terms of PEF, asthma score and use of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation 
aerosol. Fp50 showed a positive trend but did not reach statistical 
significance. No patients in the FS100 withdrew for worsening asthma during 
the 12-Week treatment period, and only 1 from Fp50, Fp100 and DS50 
compared to 4 in the Placebo group. 
Change from Baseline in the AQLQ(S) Score was significant for FS groups vs 
Placebo. A positive trend was observed for Fp groups.

Notes 
The primary endpoint has been met.  
Fp and FS groups showed statistically significant improvement vs Placebo in 
terms of PEF, and there was a statistically significant improvement of 
FS200/12.5 vs Fp200, and FS100/12.5 vs Fp100.  
Fp and FS groups showed statistically significant improvement vs Placebo in 
terms of asthma score, and there was a statistically significant improvement 
of FS200/12.5 vs Fp200, but not for FS100/12.5 vs Fp100.  
Fp and FS groups showed statistically significant improvement vs Placebo in 
terms of albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use, and there was a 
statistically significant improvement of FS200/12.5 vs Fp200, but not for 
FS100/12.5 vs Fp100.    
20 patients in the Placebo group withdrew for worsening asthma during the 
12-Week treatment period, and only 1 from Fp100, 3 in Fp200, 1 in 
FS100/12.4 and 4 in FS200/12.5.  
Change from Baseline in the AQLQ(S) Score was significant for FS and Fp 
groups vs Placebo.  
2.5.2.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Pooled data from Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 by dose group showed similar baseline 
trough FEV1 values across all FS MDPI and placebo groups. At week 12, all FS MDPI dose groups 
showed greater increases in mean change trough FEV1 (0.340, 0.300, and 0.290 L in the 50/12.5, 
100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg groups, respectively) than the placebo group (0.104 L). At week 12, the 
increase in mean baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h was similar (0.366, 0.356, and 0.369 L) in the FS 
MDPI 50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg groups, respectively. All FS MDPI dose groups showed 
greater increases in mean baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h than the corresponding Fp MDPI groups 
(0.212, 0.192, and 0.194 L in the 50, 100, and 200 mcg groups, respectively) and the placebo group 
(0.032 L). 
Data from Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 were also pooled for the same subgroups (sex, 
age, race, and geographic region); a summary of patient subgroups by treatment group for the FAS 
(pooled Phase 3 studies) is provided in Table 28 and further details on the results of the subgroup 
analyses are provided below. 
The majority of patients were 18 to 64 years of age, from the US, female, and white. Overall, 
treatment effects were variable due to the small sample size and baseline imbalances in some groups. 
Improvement in lung function was consistently observed across majority of subgroups following 
treatment with FS MDPI with greater effects observed in the FS MDPI relative to the Fp MDPI groups. 
The forest plots illustrate that consistent differences are demonstrated in the subgroup categories (e.g. 
“Female,” “Male,” “White,” “Black,” etc.) for FS MDPI versus placebo, and for FS MDPI versus Fp MDPI. 
This provided evidence that no important interactions were present in any subgroups with reasonable 
sample sizes.

2.5.2.4.  Supportive study (FSS-AS-305) 
Title of study:  
A 26-Week Open-Label Study to Assess the Long-Term Safety of Fluticasone Propionate Multidose Dry 
Powder Inhaler and Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol Multidose Dry Powder Inhaler in Patients 12 
Years of Age and Older with Persistent Asthma.  
Methods 
Study Participants  
Demographic characteristics were generally well-balanced across the treatment groups and similar to 
the pooled and individual Phase 3 studies.  
Figure 19: Overall Study FSS-AS-305 Schema 
Study design: 
Study FSS-AS-305 was a stratified, randomised, open-label, active drug-controlled study with no 
blinding. The study consisted of a 14-day (±2 days) pre-treatment run-in period, during which time 
patients continued using their current asthma medication (except for their SABA, which was replaced 
by the sponsor-provided study rescue medication). This run-in period provided treatment baseline for 
safety and for asthma status and established compliance. After successful completion of the run-in 
period, patients who remained eligible were stratified by cohort (ICS or ICS/LABA) as well as by 
treatment strength (mid- or high-). Patients were assigned to either the ICS monotherapy cohort or 
the ICS/LABA-combination therapy cohort based on their current asthma maintenance therapy. Within 
each cohort, patients were stratified into either the mid- or high-treatment strength based on the daily 
dose of their current asthma maintenance therapy.  
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 102/147 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients in each strength of the ICS/LABA-combination cohort were randomly assigned in a 3:1 
distribution to either the FS MDPI or Advair Diskus treatment group. 
Run in period 
During the run-in period, patients continued using their current asthma medications (i.e., ICS/LABA 
combination). The mid- and high-strength ICS/LABA treatment groups included only patients who were 
receiving an ICS/LABA combination of the same strength prior to the study and during the study run-in 
period. Thus, patients randomised to the mid- and high-strength FS MDPI combinations substituted FS 
MDPI for their existing combination inhaler. Since 286 (42.4%) patients of the overall study population 
were using Advair Diskus as their usual medication prior to the study, patients randomised to the mid- 
and high-strength Advair Diskus treatment groups were a mixed population with some substituting 
Advair Diskus for a different combination inhaler and some continuing to use Advair Diskus at the same 
strength. This run-in period provided treatment baseline for safety and for asthma status and 
established compliance.  
Treatments 
Fp MDPI, 100 and 200 mcg, 1 inhalation twice a day and FS MDPI, 100/12.5 and 200/12.5 mcg, 1 
inhalation twice a day.  
Flovent HFA, 110 and 220 mcg, 2 puffs twice a day; Advair Diskus, 250/50 and 500/50 mcg, 1 
inhalation twice a day. 
The treatment period lasted for 26 weeks. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety of Fp inhalation powder in 2 
strengths and FS inhalation powder in 2 strengths when administered with the Teva MDPI device over 
26 weeks in patients 12 years of age and older with persistent asthma. 
The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of Fp MDPI in comparison to Flovent 
HFA and FS MDPI in comparison to Advair Diskus. 
The efficacy objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Fp MDPI in comparison to Flovent 
HFA and FS MDPI in comparison to Advair Diskus. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary outcome measure was the incidence and type of all adverse events for Fp MDPI and FS 
MDPI. 
Efficacy was not a primary or secondary objective in this study. The principal efficacy variable was the 
change from baseline in trough FEV1 over the 26-week treatment period. 
Sample size 
674 patients were randomised to receive Fp MDPI, FS MDPI, Flovent HFA, or Advair Diskus, and 673 
patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and were evaluated for safety in the study. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
FSS-AS-305 was a randomised, open-label, active drug-controlled study with no blinding. Patients 
were stratified by cohort (ICS or ICS/LABA) and by treatment strength (mid- or high-). Patients were 
assigned to either the ICS-monotherapy cohort or the ICS/LABA combination cohort based on their 
current (before the SV or, if needed, the pre-screen visit) asthma maintenance therapy. Within each

cohort, patients were assigned to either the mid- or high-treatment strength based on the daily dose of 
their current asthma maintenance therapy. Patients in each strength of the ICS-monotherapy cohort 
were randomly assigned in a 3:1 distribution to either the Fp MDPI or Flovent HFA treatment arm. 
Patients in each strength of the ICS/LABA-combination cohort were randomly assigned in a 3:1 
distribution to either the FS MDPI or Advair Diskus treatment arm. It was possible for strengths and 
cohorts to be closed once predetermined randomisation goals were met.  
Statistical methods 
The primary outcome measure was the incidence and type of all adverse events for Fp MDPI and FS 
MDPI. 
Efficacy was not a primary or secondary objective in this study. The principal efficacy variable was the 
change from baseline in trough FEV1 over the 26-week treatment period. The FAS was used for all 
analyses of efficacy data.  
Principal efficacy analysis 
The principal efficacy analysis of change from baseline (collected at TV1) in trough FEV1 over the 26-
week treatment period (with mid- and high-strength data combined within each cohort) was performed 
using a MMRM with effects due to baseline FEV1, sex, age, (pooled) investigational centre, visit, 
treatment, and visit-by-treatment interaction. No explicit structure was assumed for the covariance 
among the repeated measures. Contrasts for treatment comparisons of interest were constructed. 
Missing data were not explicitly imputed in the MMRM analyses, but all non-missing data for a patient 
were used within the analysis to estimate the time-averaged difference between treatment groups over 
26 weeks. While safety was the primary objective of the study, there was reasonable power for 
demonstrating non-inferiority of the study drug to the comparator drug within each cohort. The 
statistical analysis plan specified that noninferiority would be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 
95% CIs for the treatment difference was greater than –125 mL.  
No sensitivity analysis of the principle analysis was planned for this study. 
No efficacy subgroup analysis of the principle analysis was planned. 
Analysis sets 
The safety population included all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of randomised 
study drug. Treatment was assigned based upon the treatment patients actually received, regardless 
of the treatment to which they were randomised. The safety population was used for all analyses of 
safety data, including safety subgroup analyses. 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomised patients. Treatment was assigned based 
on the treatment to which patients were randomised, regardless of which treatment they actually 
received. 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug and had at least 1 postbaseline trough FEV1 assessment. The FAS was used for all analyses 
of efficacy data.

Demographic Characteristics 
The treatment groups were similar in most demographic characteristics. However, the age of mid-
strength ICS patients (mean: 41.5 years in the Fp MDPI 100 mcg group and 38.4 years in the Flovent 
HFA 110 mcg group; median: 41.0 and 40.0 years, respectively) appeared to be slightly lower than the 
ages of patients in other groups (means ranged from 42.0 to 46.1 years; medians ranged from 44.5 to 
52.0 years). Most groups had a slightly larger proportion of females than males; the sexes were more 
equivalently represented in the Advair Diskus groups and the FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg group. In all

treatment groups, mean BMI values (ranging from 28.6 to 32.0 kg/m2; median values were similar) 
indicated that the study population was mostly overweight to obese. 
Recruitment 
Period: 14 July 2014 to 20 July 2015 
Duration of Treatment: This study consisted of a SV, a 14-day (±2 days) run-in period, a 26-week 
treatment period, and a 1-week follow-up period. Patients were expected to participate in this study 
for a minimum of 29 weeks. It was also possible for patients to participate in an optional pre-screening 
period for up to 30 days before the SV, during which no study drug was administered. 
Conduct of the study 
There was 1 amendment (dated 14 January 2015) to the protocol for this study to change when an 
asthma exacerbation was to be considered a serious adverse event. An asthma exacerbation, 
regardless of severity, was to be recorded as an adverse event only if it met the criteria of a serious 
adverse event. Otherwise they were to be recorded only on the asthma exacerbation page of the CRF. 
Before the amendment was issued, the definition of a serious adverse event mandated that any severe 
asthma exacerbation, defined as an event that required systemic corticosteroid use for ≥3 days or 
hospitalisation or an ED visit because of asthma requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids, was 
required to be reported as a serious adverse event regardless of whether it met the standard criteria 
for serious adverse events. The amendment removed this requirement, thus instituting more standard 
criteria for the definition of a serious adverse event. 
Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics were generally similar across treatment groups. All patients enrolled in the 
study were required to have a diagnosis of persistent asthma. The duration of asthma history was at 
least 10 years for the majority of patients across treatment groups. The Fp MDPI 200 mcg group, 
however, was notable for having 20 (16%) patients with asthma duration of 1 to <5 years, compared 
with a range of 2% to 11% with this duration across other groups. Previous MDI experience was more 
variable across treatment groups, but most patients had MDI experience of at least 10 years. Previous 
DPI experience was also variable across treatment groups, but the majority had at least 1 year and 
less than 15 years.  
Numbers analysed 
These 674 patients were included in the ITT population. A total of 673 (>99%) patients received at 
least 1 dose of study drug and were evaluable for safety; 659 (98%) patients were evaluable for 
efficacy (FAS); and 595 (88%) patients completed the study (at least 26 weeks of open-label 
treatment).  
A total of 79 (12%) patients were discontinued from the study, including 41 (12%) patients in the ICS 
cohort (in which the highest rate of withdrawals [7 (17%) patients] occurred in the Flovent HFA 110 
mcg group and the lowest rate [13 (10%) patients] occurred in the Fp MDPI 200 mcg group) and 38 
(11%) patients in the ICS/LABA cohort (in which the highest rate of withdrawals [6 (14%) patients] 
occurred in the Advair Diskus 500/50 mcg group and the lowest rate [10 (8%) patients] occurred in 
the FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg group). 
Withdrawal rates across all treatment groups ranged from 8% to 17%. The most frequent reason for 
withdrawal across all treatment groups was withdrawal by patient, which occurred for 37 patients 
overall, which was 46.8% of the 79 patients overall who withdrew and 5% of randomised patients. No 
treatment group had a notably greater rate of withdrawals compared with the other groups. Eleven

patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Two patients discontinued treatment 
because of lack of efficacy, and 2 patients discontinued treatment because of disease progression. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The treatment effect and the lower limit of the 95% CIs for all doses of Fp MDPI and FS MDPI 
exceeded the –125 mL non-inferiority margin for FEV1 when compared to Flovent HFA and Advair 
Diskus, respectively For FS MDPI, numerical differences favoured FS MDPI over Advair Diskus at the 
high dose. The non-inferiority margin of -125 mL was below the estimated minimal clinically important 
difference of 230 mL reported for FEV1. The applicant considered that the study drug was at least as 
effective as the comparator drug for both the ICS and ICS/LABA cohorts. While the study design was 
open-label due to the difficulty of blinding the active comparator, the applicant considered that the 
efficacy results were useful to show that meaningful differences between the treatments were not 
observed.  
The non-inferiority comparison is displayed graphically in Figure 20. The top 3 lines represent the 
comparisons for the mono-product, Fp MDPI versus Flovent HFA, while the bottom 3 lines represent 
the comparison of FS MDPI and Advair Diskus for the mid-strength doses (3rd from bottom) followed 
by the comparison of the high-strength doses, with the comparison of both strengths combined at the 
bottom. In the case of the mid-strength comparison, the 95% CI was centred around 0, while for the 
high-strength dose comparison, it was shifted to the right in favour of FS MDPI over Advair Diskus. 
According to the applicant, the data supported the comparability of both the mid- and high-strength 
doses of FS MDPI to Advair Diskus. It is not thought to be reasonable to extrapolate this comparison to 
low-strength FS MDPI based on in vitro proportionality of the 3 dose strengths, the relative efficacy of 
the low-strength dose compared to the mid-strength dose in Study FSS-AS-301, and the demonstrated 
efficacy of the low-strength dose compared to placebo.

In Study FSS-AS-305, the primary efficacy variable of the change from baseline in trough FEV1 over 
the 26-week treatment period was comparable for both the mid- and high-dose strengths between the 
FS MDPI and ADVAIR DISKUS treatments within the respective ICS/LABA dose strength cohorts (Table

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dose response studies 
The study design, subject disposition and recruitment criteria were appropriate in the studies 
submitted in support of dose selection for the monotherapy components of BroPair Spiromax. The 
studied population were relevant to the enrolled population in pivotal studies and the efficacy 
endpoints (trough FEV1) were considered clinically relevant.  
The 3 doses of fluticasone propionate (Fp) were selected for Phase 3 development on the basis of PK 
studies along with efficacy and safety in Phase 2 dose-ranging studies (FpS-AS-201 and FpS-AS-202). 
The assessment of Fp PK parameters in the Phase 2 studies demonstrated proportional increases in the 
PK parameters across all the doses tested. The Fp doses selected (50, 100, and 200 mcg) were shown 
to be the most effective doses in the treatment of patients with asthma that were symptomatic despite 
ICS therapy. Similarly, the salmeterol dose for Phase 3 development was selected on the basis of PK 
studies along with efficacy and safety in a Phase 2 dose-ranging study (FSS-AS-201). Increased 
systemic exposure to salmeterol with increasing FS MDPI doses, dose-related improvements in 
pulmonary function, and a similar benefit provided by the FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg dose relative to 
Advair Diskus 100/50 mcg all supported the selection of the 12.5 mcg dose of salmeterol for Phase 3 
development. 
However, the proposed doses contain significantly lower amounts of the active substances compared to 
the extensively studied and already marketed combination of Fp and salmeterol. Therefore, the 
applicant was requested by CHMP to justify the amount of salmeterol, which is considered very low 
compared to the amount in the already marketed products, with established efficacy/safety and with at 
least 20 years post-marketing experience. The use of 30-minute partial exposure data has been 
recognised as a mean to assess the efficacy of medicinal products, such as salmeterol, that are 
characterised by very rapid lung absorption and significant but delayed gastrointestinal absorption. 
Using this approach, the early exposure (AUC0-30min ratio) in the clinical studies comparing FS MDPI 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 109/147 
 
 
 
 
 
and Advair Diskus resulted in exposure ratios of 0.766 and 0.848, which could support that delivery to 
the lungs is not substantially less. This is further discussed in section 2.4.4 ‘Discussion on clinical 
pharmacology’ and was acknowledged by CHMP. In addition, the clinical data demonstrated a dose 
response for efficacy using a range of salmeterol doses tested in the Phase 2 Study FSS-AS-201 that 
were specifically designed to select the most optimal dose of salmeterol. The applicant stated that the 
dose of salmeterol selected for FS MDPI for Phase 3 development, 12.5 mcg, was based on indications 
of therapeutic comparability to salmeterol 50 mcg in the active comparator, Advair Diskus in the Phase 
2 study. The Applicant therefore considered that the Phase 2 salmeterol dose-ranging study efficacy 
data with the active comparator Advair Diskus, the PK exposure data, and the Phase 3 clinical efficacy 
data indicated that the formulation strategy was successful for salmeterol in achieving comparable 
efficacy with a lower dose strength.  
Moreover, there were no robust dose response relation based on the phase II studies with Fp 
monotherapy and CHMP considered that the design of the studies might not have been optimal to 
detect differences between the three different strengths. Therefore, the applicant was requested to 
provide further justification on the Fp doses chosen and to further discuss any additional benefit with 
the increase in Fp strength. The applicant highlighted that dose-ranging studies that had been 
conducted with the Fp mono-product did not report statistically significant differences between Fp 
doses but, in general, reported tendencies for dose-related improvements. The applicant provided the 
results of 3 studies from the Literature characterizing the change in FEV1 in response to different doses 
of Fp. A comparison of 100 mcg/day and 200 mcg/day doses of Fp resulted in a difference of 
approximately 40 mL in the change from baseline in FEV1 at endpoint. For comparison, in Study FSS-
AS-301 submitted in this application, the difference in the FEV1 change from baseline between the Fp 
MDPI 100 mcg/day (mid ICS dose) and 200 mcg/day (high ICS dose) treatment groups was 
approximately 32 mL, and in Study FSS-AS-30017 submitted in this application, the difference was 
approximately 60 mL between the Fp MDPI 200 mcg/day and 400 mcg/day treatment groups. 
According to the applicant, in order to see bigger differences, it is necessary to use doses of Fp that 
differ by more than 2-fold. Overall, CHMP acknowledged the applicant’s position on the relatively flat 
dose-response curve to Fp and ICSs in general which is well described and supported by the literature. 
CHMP also agreed that the benefit of combining an ICS with a LABA compared to an ICS alone has 
been demonstrated throughout the literature, whether the combination is compared to the same ICS 
dose or an increased ICS dose. It was acknowledged that due to the small differences in efficacy 
between Fp doses, a detectable difference in lung function between doses of the combination is not 
expected because the addition of salmeterol is likely to obscure any small difference. Nevertheless, 
while the applicant presented sufficient justification for the salmeterol dose and the three doses of Fp 
based on Phase 2 studies, the low FS MDPI dose strength was considered to be insufficiently supported 
by the clinical efficacy Phase 3 results. This is further discussed below.   
Main studies 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two replicate, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-group, 12-week Phase 3 efficacy and safety 
studies (FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017) in adult and adolescent patients (12 years of age or older) 
with asthma were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of FS MDPI across a spectrum of asthma 
severities. In addition to these studies, a 26-week, open-label, long-term safety and efficacy study 
with the mid- and high-strength doses of FS MDPI was conducted (Study FSS-AS-305). 
Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 were designed to show superiority of Fp mono-product 
(nominal doses of 50, 100, and 200 mcg) over placebo and to show superiority of the FS combination 
(nominal doses of 50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg) over Fp mono-product in adults and 
Assessment Report

adolescents in a broad range of asthma severity. The primary endpoints in both studies were the 
change from baseline in trough (morning pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) FEV1 at week 12 and 
the standardised baseline-adjusted post-dose FEV1 AUEC0-12h at the week 12 visit, analysed for the 
subset of approximately 300 patients who performed post-dose serial spirometry.  
Deviations from the Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of 
asthma (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1) in treatment duration (12 weeks instead of at least 6 months) 
and primary endpoint (lung function instead of reduction in asthma exacerbations) are considered to 
be acceptable based on the well- recognised efficacy of fluticasone and salmeterol. With regard to the 
long-term safety study (FSS-AS-305), considering the well-recognised efficacy and safety of 
fluticasone and salmeterol a six months safety study was considered to be adequate to assess the 
safety of BroPair Spiromax.  
It is, however, noted that the initially intended indication for the FS MDPI combination product also 
contains a substitution indication [patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid 
and long-acting β2 agonist]. This substitution indication would include the switch from an open 
combination of any ICS and any LABA but also the switch from any LABA/ICS fixed combination 
products. Whereas the step-up indication [patients not adequately controlled with inhaled 
corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short-acting β2 agonist] could be considered well covered by 
the clinical programme (EMEA/H/SA/3754/1/2018/II), the substitution indication was not (this is 
further discussed below). 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria in the Phase 3 studies were the same with those commonly used in 
asthma studies and thus considered acceptable. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to allow 
for selection of patients with well-characterised asthma that was stable enough for the study and were 
likely to benefit from treatment with FS MDPI. Since the dose of ICS was used to define patients’ 
asthma severity, different baseline asthma therapies were required for inclusion in the studies 
reflecting the dose of ICS being studied. This ensured that a range of asthma severity was evaluated in 
the development programme to treat a broadened spectrum of asthma severity encountered clinically.  
The randomisation criteria and schemes as well as blinding were considered acceptable. 
Most of the major amendments for Studies FSS-AS-301 and Study FSS-AS-30017 were made to the 
protocol, based on regulatory feedback or at the request of regulatory authorities. However, those are 
not considered to have an impact on the outcome of the study. 
The primary endpoint ‘change in FEV1 at week 12’ can be considered adequate since the effect of ICS 
can be assessed after 3 months. Furthermore, this primary endpoint can be considered acceptable as a 
commonly used endpoint for respiratory products intended for use in asthmatic patients. Upon request 
by CHMP, the applicant clarified why the comparison of FS MDPI vs Fp MDPI for trough FEV1 was not 
included in the primary endpoint. A sequential approach was used in the study design, first comparing 
the mono-product to placebo to demonstrate a significant effect, and then comparing the combination 
to the mono-product, to prove the efficacy of Fp MDPI and the FS MPDI combination. Moreover, two 
different endpoints were used to demonstrate efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-
agonists, which act by different mechanisms to improve pulmonary function.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 
In the 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies (FSS-AS-301 and FS-AS-30017), 1375 patients were randomised to Fp 
MDPI, FS MDPI, or placebo treatment; and of those patients, 1360 were included in the FAS

population. The majority of patients in all treatment groups in the FAS population completed the study; 
only 9% of patients overall withdrew from the studies prematurely. 
Patients were required to be on a stable maintenance dose of low- or mid-strength ICS or ICS/LABA 
(Study FSS-AS-301) or mid- to high-strength ICS or ICS/LABA (Study FSS-AS-30017) at study entry. 
Study FSS-AS-301 evaluated low- to mid-doses of Fp MDPI 50 and 100 mcg bid and FS MDPI 50/12.5 
and 100/12.5 mcg bid, whereas Study FSS-AS-30017 evaluated mid to high doses of Fp MDPI 100 and 
200 mcg bid and FS MDPI 100/12.5 and 200/12.5 mcg bid. 
In both studies the primary endpoints included: 
1.  Change from baseline in trough (AM pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) FEV1 at week 12 
2.  Standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h at week 12, analysed for the subset of 
approximately 300 patients who performed serial spirometry 
A fixed-sequence multiple testing procedure was used to control the overall Type I error rate at the 
0.05 level (2-sided) for the primary endpoints analysis. 
Phase 3 Studies Efficacy Results 
In both studies, the results for the change from baseline in trough FEV1 at week 12 in the Fp MDPI and 
FS MDPI groups were statistically significantly superior to those in the placebo group.  
Comparisons of combination therapy with monotherapy were not controlled for multiplicity but 
indicated improvement for FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg compared with Fp MDPI 50 mcg (p=0.0022) and Fp 
MDPI 100 mcg (p=0.0166) and for FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg compared with Fp MDPI 100 mcg 
(p=0.0202) in Study FSS-AS-301 and improvement for FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg compared with Fp MDPI 
100 mcg (p=0.0005) and Fp MDPI 200 mcg (p=0.0356) and for FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg compared with 
Fp MDPI 200 mcg (p=0.0309) in Study FSS-AS-30017. 
Results for the standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h based on serial spirometry for 
combination therapy compared with monotherapy indicated that FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and 200/12.5 
mcg doses were statistically significantly superior to Fp MDPI 100 and 200 mcg doses, respectively, 
and that FS MDPI 50/12.5 and 100/12.5 mcg doses were statistically significantly superior to Fp MDPI 
50 and 100 mcg doses, respectively. There were also improvements for FS MDPI 50/12.5 and 
100/12.5 mcg doses compared with Fp MDPI 100 and 200 mcg doses, respectively. Results for the 
standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h based on serial spirometry in the FS MDPI and Fp 
MDPI groups were statistically significantly superior to those in the placebo group. 
In both studies combined, all dose strengths of the FS MDPI combination compared to placebo for 
trough FEV1 resulted in a difference from placebo in least squares (LS) mean ranging from 0.262 to 
0.276 L (all p-values for comparisons were <0.0001). In comparing the Fp MDPI mono-product doses, 
there were numeric differences between the doses in trough FEV1 ranging from approximately 30 to 60 
mL. According to the applicant, this is consistent with the flat dose-response curve that is consistently 
reported for all ICS and the reported differences for Fp in the literature. The trough FEV1 endpoint is 
not expected to be able to differentiate between different doses of the combination due to the 
relatively small dose response to Fp and the confounding influence of the added LABA.  
For all dose strengths of the FS MDPI combination compared with placebo for the post-dose FEV1 
AUEC0-12h, the difference in LS mean from placebo ranged from 0.322 to 0.335 L (all p- values for 
comparisons were <0.0001). This endpoint primarily assesses bronchodilation due to the LABA 
salmeterol. Since all strengths of the combination used the same dose of salmeterol, it was considered 
that this endpoint is not expected to differentiate between the combination doses.

Overall, the data provided showed for both primary endpoints superiority for Fp MDPI over placebo and 
superiority for the FS MDPI combination over Fp MDPI. These findings are expected based on the well-
known efficacy pattern for the fluticasone propionate and salmeterol substances. However, CHMP 
considered that the recorded differences between doses investigated were minor and the clinical 
relevance questionable. While this could be expected as the dose/effect relationship is known to be flat 
and thus assay sensitivity for picking up differences between doses often poor with this kind of study 
design, CHMP expressed some concerns about the clinical efficacy results of the FS MDPI low dose 
obtained in FSS-AS-301 (this is further discussed below).   
Pooled data from Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies, the demographics characteristics were similar across the FS MDPI and 
placebo treatment groups. 
Pooled data from Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 by dose group showed similar baseline 
trough FEV1 values across all FS MDPI and placebo groups. At week 12, all FS MDPI dose groups 
showed greater increases in mean change trough FEV1 (0.340, 0.300, and 0.290 L in the 50/12.5, 
100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg groups, respectively) than the placebo group (0.104 L). At week 12, the 
increase in mean baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h was similar (0.366, 0.356, and 0.369 L) in the FS 
MDPI 50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg groups, respectively. All FS MDPI dose groups showed 
greater increases in mean baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h than the corresponding Fp MDPI groups 
(0.212, 0.192, and 0.194 L in the 50, 100, and 200 mcg groups, respectively) and the placebo group 
(0.032 L). 
Primary efficacy results presented for each of the three proposed strengths (low, mid and 
high) 
Low-strength Combination (FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg) 
The low-strength combination was assessed in Study FSS-AS-301.  
The change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 0.319 L for the FS MDPI low-strength combination 
compared with 0.053 L for placebo and 0.172 L for Fp MDPI 50 mcg. When FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg was 
compared to placebo, the difference was 0.266 L (p<0.0001), and when compared to Fp MDPI 50 mcg, 
the difference was 0.147 L (p=0.0022).  
The change from baseline post-dose FEV1 AUC0-12h was 0.399 L for the FS MDPI low-strength 
combination (50/12.5 mcg) compared to 0.074 L for placebo and 0.268 L for Fp MDPI 50 mcg. When 
FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.325 L (p=0.0000) and when 
compared to Fp MDPI 50 mcg, the difference was 0.131 L (p=0.0322). The difference between the low- 
strength FS MDPI and Fp MDPI provides evidence for the added benefit of salmeterol in the low-
strength dose. 
Mid-strength Combination (FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg) 
The mid-strength combination was assessed in patients with both mild to moderate asthma (Study 
FSS-AS-301) and moderate to severe asthma (Study FSS-AS-30017).  
In patients with mild to moderate asthma, the change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 0.315 L for the 
FS MDPI mid-strength combination compared to 0.053 L for placebo and 0.204 L for Fp MDPI 100 mcg. 
When FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.262 L (p<0.0001), and 
when compared to Fp MDPI 100 mcg, the difference was 0.111 L (p=0.0202).  
In patients with moderate to severe asthma, the change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 0.271 L for 
the FS MDPI mid-strength combination compared to -0.004 L for placebo and 0.119 L for Fp MDPI 100 
mcg. When FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.274 L (p<0.0001), 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 113/147 
 
 
 
and when compared to Fp MDPI 100 mcg, the difference was 0.152 L (p=0.0005). Thus, in both 
patient populations, the FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg showed significant improvement in trough FEV1 over 
placebo and over Fp MDPI 100 mcg. 
These observations were however considered to be predictable since the dose is the same, the inhaler 
is the same and only the addition of salmeterol can produce some difference. 
In patients with mild to moderate asthma, the change from baseline post-dose FEV1 AUC0-12h was 
0.408 L for the FS MDPI mid-strength combination compared to 0.074 L for placebo and 0.254 L for Fp 
MDPI 100 mcg When FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.335 L 
(p=0.0000), and when compared to Fp MDPI 100 mcg, the difference was 0.154 L (p=0.0076).  
In patients with moderate to severe asthma, the change from baseline post-dose FEV1 AUC0-12h was 
0.442 L for the FS MDPI mid-strength combination compared to 0.121 L for placebo and 0.260 L for Fp 
MDPI 100 mcg. When FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.322 L 
(p=0.0000), and when compared to Fp MDPI 100 mcg, the difference was 0.182 L (p=0.0010).  
Thus, in both populations, the difference between the mid-strength FS MDPI (100/12.5 mcg) and Fp 
MDPI 100 mcg provides evidence for the significant added benefit of salmeterol in the mid strength 
dose. 
High-strength Combination (FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg) 
The change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 0.272 L for the FS MDPI high-strength combination 
compared to -0.004 L for placebo and 0.179 L for Fp MDPI 200 mcg. When FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg was 
compared to placebo, the difference was 0.276 L (p-value<0.0001), and when compared to Fp MDPI 
200 mcg, the difference was 0.093 L (p=0.0309). The difference between FS MDPI and Fp MDPI for the 
trough FEV1 endpoint reflects the contribution of salmeterol at the end of the dosing period.  
The change from baseline post-dose FEV1 AUC0-12h was 0.446 L for the FS MDPI high-strength 
combination compared to 0.121 L for placebo and 0.267 L for Fp MDPI 200 mcg. When FS MDPI 
200/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.326 L (p=0.0000), and when compared 
to Fp MDPI 200 mcg, the difference was 0.179 L (p=0.0009). The difference between the high-strength 
FS MDPI and Fp MDPI provides evidence for the significant added benefit of salmeterol in the high-
strength combination.  
Supportive Phase 3 Study FSS-AS-305 
This was a 26-week, randomised, open-label, active drug-controlled, Phase 3 study in 674 patients 
with persistent asthma. Patients were stratified by cohort (ICS or ICS/LABA) and by treatment 
strength (mid or high). Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1 distribution (investigational drug: 
comparator) based on their prior asthma maintenance therapy to either open-label Fp MDPI (100 or 
200 mcg) or Flovent HFA (110 or 220 mcg) (ICS cohort) or FS MDPI (100/12.5 or 200/12.5 mcg) or 
Advair Diskus (250/50 or 500/50 mcg) (ICS/LABA cohort). Within each cohort, patients were assigned 
to either the mid- or high-strength treatment based on the daily dose of their current asthma 
maintenance therapy. 
Demographic characteristics were generally well-balanced across the treatment groups and similar to 
the pooled and individual Phase 3 studies.  
While safety was its primary objective, the study included a planned efficacy analysis of the change 
from baseline in trough FEV1 over the 26-week treatment period. The applicant considered that this 
had reasonable power for demonstrating non-inferiority of the investigational product to the 
comparator product within each cohort.  
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 114/147 
 
 
 
The non-inferiority comparison, in an open label setting, of the mid- and high-strength doses of the 
combination showed that FS MDPI was non-inferior to Advair Diskus (lower limit of non-inferiority of -
0.125 L). In direct comparison of FS MDPI (200/12.5 mcg) to Advair Diskus (500/50 mcg), the LS 
mean difference was 0.059 (95% CI: -0.032, 0.150). The high-strength dose of FS MDPI (200/12.5 
mcg) is according to the applicant comparable to the high-strength dose of Advair Diskus (500/50 
mcg). This, however, was performed with an open-label study design and thus the results are 
questionable. In addition, there was no direct demonstration of therapeutic equivalency or comparable 
efficacy of FS MDPI (200/12.5 mcg) to Advair Diskus (500/50 mcg). Therefore, serious concerns were 
expressed by CHMP with regard to the initially proposed substitution indication. This is further 
discussed below.  
Elderly (patients >65 years of age) 
The data submitted for patients older than 65 years of age were considered to be limited by CHMP. 
Furthermore, there was a greater variability in the treatment responses observed in the >65 years of 
age subgroup. Upon request by CHMP, the applicant provided further justification demonstrating that 
the older population did not respond differently to FS MDPI than the population as a whole. It was also 
agreed by CHMP that the greater variability in the treatment responses observed in the >65 years of 
age subgroup in this clinical programme can be attributed to the variation in a single response 
associated with a small sample size and not a unique characteristic of the population. Furthermore, 
currently approved inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist 
combinations do not require any dosage adjustment for patients aged 65 years and older. Thus, the 
information reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC, ‘there is no need to adjust the dose in elderly 
patients’ is supported by CHMP. 
Adolescents (12 years of age and older) 
Results in adolescents were consistent with those in adults in both pivotal replicate phase 3 studies. 
Greater effects relative to placebo were observed for FS MDPI in adolescent patients consistent with 
the overall treatment results observed. The combination showed a greater effect than Fp alone. 
Therapeutic indication 
With regard to the therapeutic indication for BroPair Spiromax, the following indication was initially 
proposed by the applicant:  
BroPair Spiromax is indicated for use in adults and adolescents 12 years and older.  
BroPair Spiromax is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product 
(inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist) is appropriate: 
- 
or 
- 
patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-
acting β2 agonist  
patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 
agonist. 
In line with the CHMP SA advice received (EMEA/H/SA/3754/1/2018/II), the CHMP considered that the 
second part of the indication: ‘patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and 
long-acting β2 agonist’ (substitution indication) was not adequately supported by the clinical 
development programme. Furthermore, CHMP considered that therapeutic equivalence has not been 
adequately demonstrated between FS MDPI and the active comparator Advair Diskus in clinical study 
FSS-AS-305 as this study was not considered sensitive enough to demonstrate comparability of pre-
dose FEV1 between FS MDPI and Advair Diskus as there was no difference in effect between the two 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 115/147 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ICS doses investigated. Therefore, interchangeability between FS MDPI and the approved comparator 
Advair Diskus (or other approved products) cannot be claimed. Therefore, a major objection was raised 
by CHMP. Nevertheless, within their responses, the applicant indicated that the substitution indication 
was not further pursued.  
Moreover, CHMP considered that it was important to stress that the doses to be used with BroPair 
Spiromax do not correspond to any approved doses for other salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 
containing products. Thus, the following text was added to section 4.2 of the SmPC to avoid any 
potential confusion and/or dosing errors: 
‘Note that the delivered doses for BroPair Spiromax are different from other salmeterol/fluticasone 
propionate containing products on the market. The products are thus not interchangeable on dose 
bases and different dose levels (including medium/high doses of fluticasone propionate) for different 
products do not necessarily correspond to each other.’ 
With regard to the ‘step-up’ indication (patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled 
corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist), CHMP noted that the asthma guideline requires equal 
emphasis to be placed on lung function and symptomatic endpoints to provide sufficient evidence of 
efficacy. However, in both pivotal clinical studies 301 and 30017 and in particular in study 301 a 
clinically relevant patient-derived benefit as measured by AQLQ of the FS MDPI over the monotherapy 
Fp was not seen. Therefore, the applicant was requested by CHMP to provide further justification to 
support the clinical efficacy supporting the use of FS MDPI low-, mid- and high-dose strengths in the 
asthma ‘step-up’ indication.  
Taking into account that fluticasone propionate (Fp) and salmeterol are not new active substances but 
are well-established pharmaceutical agents, primary endpoints focusing on lung function were selected 
accordingly by the applicant, in line with other approved ICSs and LABA inhaler development 
programs. This was well acknowledged by CHMP. However, the symptomatic asthma endpoints were 
included in secondary pre-specified analyses, and thus were not adequately powered to show a 
statistically significant effect. The Applicant argued that as symptomatic asthma endpoints have a high 
degree of variability; the BroPair Spiromax Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies were powered for their 
coprimary endpoints and did not have sufficient power to show significant effect for all 3 dose 
strengths for a single, prespecified, key secondary endpoint. Nevertheless, the applicant stated in their 
response that the results of pivotal studies demonstrated nominally significant improvements across a 
series of pre-specified symptomatic endpoints and better characterised efficacy of BroPair Spiromax in 
its totality across several unique symptomatic endpoints as summarised below.  
Low strength: FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg compared to Fp MDPI 50 mcg 
The low-strength combination did not show a statistically significant improvement over the low-
strength mono-product for any of the symptom-related endpoints in Study FSS-AS-301. However, the 
applicant indicated that there was a large difference between the treatments in the daily rescue 
medication use. The change from baseline in the weekly average daily rescue medication use over 12 
weeks decreased by a greater extent with FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg compared to Fp MDPI 50 mcg 
(difference of least squares [LS] mean: -0.239 puffs/day; nominal p=0.0640). In addition to a large 
difference in rescue medication use, there was a numeric improvement for the combination product 
over the mono-product across multiple symptom-related endpoints. For all the following symptom-
related endpoints, the numeric difference favoured low strength of FS MDPI in providing greater benefit 
than the low strength of Fp MDPI.  
In light of this, the applicant stated that the benefit that was seen in the reduced use of daily rescue 
medication together with the numeric benefits seen with the combination over the mono-product for 
multiple symptom-related endpoints, supports the clinical efficacy of the low-strength combination. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 116/147 
 
 
 
While several different symptom-related endpoints favoured FS MDPI, the differences between the low-
strength combination treatment and the low-strength monotherapy were considered to be small by 
CHMP. While a clinical benefit was seen, the significance of such finding did not reach statistically 
significant levels. 
Medium strength: FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg compared to Fp MDPI 100 mcg 
The mid-strength combination demonstrated a significant improvement over the mid-strength mono-
product for the AQLQ, as well as for daily rescue medication use and the percentage of asthma control 
days. 
Other secondary endpoints achieved large differences but did not reach statistical significance, with FS 
MDPI providing greater benefit than Fp MDPI for the change from baseline in both the weekly average 
of the daily asthma symptom score over 12 weeks (Study FSS-AS- 30017) and the percentage of 
rescue-free days during 12 weeks (Study FSS-AS-301). Thus, the applicant concluded that these 
endpoints supported the efficacy of the mid-strength combination, FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg, in providing 
a significant improvement in symptom-related endpoints. This was agreed by CHMP. 
High strength: FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg compared to Fp MDPI 200 mcg 
The high-strength combination demonstrated a significant improvement over the high-strength mono-
product for the 3-following symptom-related endpoints the change from baseline in the weekly average 
of the daily asthma symptom score, the weekly average of daily rescue medication use, and the 
percentage of symptom-free days. 
While the high-strength dose did not produce a statistically significant benefit of the combination over 
the mono-product for the AQLQ, the applicant indicated that this could be the result of the fact that 
Study FSS- AS-30017 was not powered to demonstrate a significant effect for this comparison. Overall, 
the endpoints of daily asthma symptom score, daily rescue medication use, and the percentage of 
symptom-free days support the efficacy of the high-strength combination, FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg, in 
providing a significant improvement in symptom-related endpoints.  
Cumulatively, the applicant was of the opinion that there was evidence of benefit for all 3 dose 
strengths in improving symptom- related endpoints despite the fact that statistical significance was not 
reached in several endpoints.  
Nevertheless, CHMP considered that the available results for the proposed FS MDPI low-strength 
combination (FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg) were not compelling and did not fulfil the requirements of the 
clinical investigation for treatment in Asthma (CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1) nor the fixed dose 
guideline(EMA/CHMP/158268/2017) based on the following issues: positive results on lung function 
alone were considered to be insufficient for approval; the low-strength combination did not show a 
statistically significant improvement over the low-strength mono-product for any of the symptom-
related endpoints in Study FSS-AS-301 and thus a clear benefit for symptoms or asthma control was 
not considered to be shown. Therefore, CHMP considered that the proposed low-strength combination 
was not sufficiently supported by the clinical efficacy data submitted. Based on the concerns expressed 
by CHMP, the applicant decided to withdraw the low-strength combination for BroPair Spiromax.  
Overall, CHMP considered that a favourable clinical effect was demonstrated only for the mid- and 
high-strength combination (FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg, respectively) in the 
Asthma ‘step-up’ indication.  
The final indication granted by CHMP is as follows:  
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021

BroPair Spiromax is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 
years and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-
acting β2 agonists. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, CHMP considered that a favourable clinical effect was demonstrated for the mid- and high- 
strengths of BroPair Spiromax (FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg, respectively) in 
the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older not adequately 
controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-acting β2 agonists. The low-
strength of BroPair Spiromax (FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg) was not considered approvable and was thus 
withdrawn by the applicant.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
A total of 9 clinical studies in adult and adolescent patients have been completed and support the 
safety of FS MDPI. The Phase 3 Safety Pool (Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017) served as the 
primary dataset for presentation and discussion of the safety profile of FS MDPI. Additionally, results 
from the Phase 2/3 Safety Pool (Studies FSS-AS-301, FSS-AS-30017, FpS-AS-201, and FpS-AS-
202), a 26-week, open-label, long-term safety study (Study FSS-AS-305), and the other Phase 1 
and 2 studies (FSS-AS-201, FpS-AS-101, FpS-AS-102, and FSS-AS-10042) are presented where 
relevant as supportive information for safety assessment. 
Patient exposure 
In the Phase 3 Safety Pool, 1364 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and were included 
in the safety population. Overall, 1252 patients (91%) completed 12 weeks of treatment. In the 12-
week studies, 542 patients received treatment with FS MDPI.  
In the Phase 2/3 Safety Pool, 2625 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and were 
included in the safety population, and 2194 (83%) completed the study. Of the 2625 patients who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug, 1511 (58%) patients were in the US and 1114 (42%) patients 
were in other geographic regions. Of the 2625 patients in the Phase 2/3 Safety Pool, 653 (25%) 
patients were from the EU, while within the non-US region, 59% (653) patients were from the EU. 
There was a total of 1375 patients in the Phase 3 Safety Pool, and of these, 27% (365) patients were 
from the EU, while within the non-US region, 62% (365) patients were from the EU. 
In the 26-week safety study (Study FSS-AS-305), a total of 673 patients received at least 1 dose of 
study drug and 595 patients (88%) completed 26 weeks of treatment. 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies, the median duration of exposure in the FS MDPI dose groups was 85 
days. The mean duration of exposure across all FS MDPI doses combined was 83.0 days, while in the 
placebo group it was slightly lower at 74.8 days because of the higher rate of premature withdrawal. 
This difference needs to be considered in the interpretation of the adverse events results. The majority 
of patients received >8 to ≤12 weeks of treatment (94% in the combined FS MDPI group and 80% in 
the placebo group). 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 118/147 
 
 
 
In Study FSS-AS-305, exposure of study drug was comparable across treatment groups. The median 
duration of exposure was 182 days (26 weeks) in all treatment groups, and the majority of patients 
received treatment for between 22 and 26 weeks. 
Overall Extent of exposure 
The number of patients and healthy volunteers treated in each of the individual studies with FS MDPI is 
summarised in Table 28. A total of 3455 patients and healthy volunteers received at least 1 dose of 
study drug in the studies, of whom 904 received treatment with FS MDPI, all of whom received the 
doses proposed for commercialisation (FS MDPI 50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg). A total of 
2637 patients were randomly assigned to the 12-week studies FSS-AS-301, FSS-AS-30017, FpS-AS-
201, and FpS-AS-202, and 2625 received at least 1 dose of randomised treatment. Of these, 2194 
patients completed 12 weeks of treatment, of whom 519 patients received treatment with FS MDPI. In 
the 12-week studies, 542 patients received treatment with FS MDPI; all of whom received the doses 
proposed for commercialisation. A total of 674 patients were randomly assigned to the 26-week study 
(FSS-AS-305). Overall, 595 patients completed 26 weeks of treatment, of whom 226 patients received 
treatment with FS MDPI (FSS-AS-305).

Adverse events 
The adverse event profile was similar in the Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 Safety Pools and in the long-term 
Study FSS-AS-305 and generally consistent with the established adverse event profile of Advair Diskus 
and Advair HFA. Abnormalities identified upon oropharyngeal examination were reported as adverse 
events of oral candidiasis, and included oral fungal infection, oropharyngeal candidiasis, and 
oropharyngitis fungal.

Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
The treatment-emergent adverse event profile was found to be similar within and across studies for all 
FS MDPI treatment groups. The few instances of differences need to be considered in the context of 
the longer duration of exposures in the FS MDPI groups relative to the placebo and the differences in 
design between the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. 
Common Adverse Events 
In the Phase 3 Safety Pool the incidence of patients who had treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) was similar for FS MDPI treatment groups (36% to 42%) compared with the placebo group 
(36%). In the Phase 2/3 Safety Pool, the incidence of patients who had TEAEs was similar for FS MDPI 
treatment groups (36% to 42%) compared with the placebo group (33%). 
In the Phase 3 Safety Pool, the System Organ Classes (SOCs) with the highest incidence of adverse 
events (across all treatment groups) were infections and infestations (17% to 29%); respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders (5% to 11%); nervous system disorders (2% to 9%); 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2% to 7%); gastrointestinal disorders (2% to 8%); 
and injury, poisoning and procedural complications (1% to 5%). All other SOCs had incidences of 
adverse events <5% in any FS MDPI treatment group. In the Phase 2/3 Safety Pool, the incidence of 
adverse events by SOCs had a similar distribution. 
In both the Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 Safety Pools, 6 different treatment-emergent adverse events 
occurred in at least 3% of patients in any FS MDPI treatment group and were more common in any FS 
MDPI treatment group than in placebo-treated patients. These 6 PTs for which the incidence was 
higher in the FS MDPI-treated patients than in placebo were nasopharyngitis, cough, headache, URI, 
back pain, and oral candidiasis. 
In Study FSS-AS-305, the incidence of patients who had severe treatment-emergent adverse events, 
serious treatment-emergent adverse events, or an adverse event causing withdrawal was low (≤10% 
in any treatment group). The incidence of patients who had treatment-related treatment-emergent 
adverse events was lower among the FS MDPI treatment groups (8% for both mid- and high-strength 
groups) compared with the Advair Diskus treatment groups (10% and 18% for mid- and high-strength 
groups, respectively). The incidence of patients who had treatment-emergent adverse events was 
similar in all study groups (65% to 77%). The SOCs with the highest incidence of adverse events 
across the treatment groups were infections and infestations (42% to 59%); respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (17% to 28%); injury, poisoning and procedural complications (2% to 17%); 
gastrointestinal disorders (6% to 15%); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (2% to 15%); 
nervous system disorders (2% to 12%); general disorders and administration site conditions (5% to 
11%). 
In the Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 Safety Pools, asthma exacerbations occurred at a similar frequency 
within and across all FS MDPI treatment groups (1% to 4%). Asthma exacerbations were reported at a 
higher percentage of patients treated with placebo (11% to 12%). The incidence of severe asthma 
exacerbations was low (≤1%) across all treatment groups. The incidence and severity of adverse 
events were not dependent on disease severity.  
The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar in Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017, 
despite a milder asthma severity in Study FSS-AS-301. Similarly, the incidence and severity of adverse 
events did not vary systematically with the dose of ICS used (an indication of a patient’s asthma 
severity).

Table 29: (Clinical Overview): Brief Summary of Treatment-Emergent Adverse 
Events by Treatment Group: Long-Term Safety Study FSS-AS-305 
Adverse Drug Reactions 
The treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 3% of patients in any FS MDPI 
treatment group in the Phase 3 Safety Pool and were more common in FS MDPI-treated patients than 
placebo-treated patients, which are known common adverse reactions related to treatment with 
Fp/salmeterol in an asthma population, were nasopharyngitis, headache, cough, oral candidiasis 
(including oropharyngeal candidiasis, oral fungal infection, and oropharyngitis fungal), and back pain 
(Table below). 
Treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 3% of patients in any FS MDPI treatment 
group in Study FSS-AS-305 are similar to the profile observed in the Phase 3 Safety Pool studies and 
are known common adverse reactions related to treatment with FS in an asthma population, including 
urinary tract infection (URI) or inflammation, bronchitis, cough, headache, nausea, vomiting, and 
musculoskeletal pain. Overall, a review of the reported adverse events revealed no new safety issues 
with FS MDPI treatment compared with Advair Diskus or Seretide Accuhaler.

Within the Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 Safety Pools, the reports of hypersensitivity reactions were low, no 
patients treated with FS MDPI had an adverse event of anaphylactic shock or angioedema, and the 
incidence of infections and infestations was similar across study groups. Treatment-emergent adverse 
events that occurred in at least 3% of patients in any FS MDPI treatment group in the Phase 3 Safety 
Pool and are known common adverse reactions related to treatment with Fp and salmeterol in patients 
with asthma include URI or inflammation, cough, headache, and musculoskeletal pain. 
Adverse reactions observed in the studies with FS MDPI are the same as those already known for the 
combination of the active substances.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
A total of 22 patients reported treatment-emergent serious adverse events in the Phase 3 and Phase 
2/3 Safety Pools, with a similar incidence observed among treatment groups (0% to 2%). Asthma was 
reported as a serious adverse event by 4 patients who received placebo and 1 patient who received FS 
MDPI 200/12.5 mcg. All other treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred in 1 patient each. 
Only 3 patients (2 patients treated with placebo and 1 patient treated with FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg) 
reported a serious adverse event (asthma) considered by the investigators to be related to the study 
drug; 3 events were considered by the investigators to be severe. 
In Study FSS-AS-305, the incidence of serious adverse events (5% to 10%) was higher than that 
observed in the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 Safety Pools (0% to 2%), with similar incidences across FS MDPI 
and Advair Diskus treatment groups. Forty-four patients had 1 or more serious adverse events during 
this study. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the treatment groups within 
the ICS/LABA cohorts. As in the Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 Safety Pools, asthma exacerbation was the 
most frequently reported serious adverse event (24 patients overall): FS MDPI treatment groups (3% 
to 6%) and Advair Diskus groups (2% to 5%). No serious adverse event in any of the FS MDPI groups 
was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. 
Death 
One death was reported in the FS MDPI clinical development programme. The patient (in Study FSS-
AS-30017) received FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and had a fatal adverse event of jaundice that was 
considered by the investigator and the sponsor to be not related to the study drug. The reported cause 
of the jaundice was fulminant hepatitis progression. It was not known whether the patient had pre-
existing abnormalities.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
A detailed evaluation of adverse events due to localised infections of the mouth and pharynx with 
Candida albicans, paradoxical bronchospasm and upper airway symptoms, immediate hypersensitivity 
reactions, evidence of immunosuppression, hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, reduction in bone 
mineral density or associated consequences (i.e., vertebral fractures), effects on growth, hypokalaemia 
and hyperglycaemia, potential cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) effects, glaucoma and 
cataracts, and eosinophilic conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome was performed to evaluate these 
known issues associated with the use of Advair Diskus. 
Within the Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 Safety Pools, no new safety concerns were identified. Reports of 
hypersensitivity reactions were low, no patients treated with FS MDPI had an adverse event of 
hypersensitivity, anaphylactic shock, or angioedema, and the incidence of infections and infestations 
was similar across study groups. All of the reported hypersensitivity reactions were considered to be

not treatment related. In the long-term safety Study FSS-AS-305, 1 patient treated with FS MDPI 
100/12.5 mcg reported an adverse event of mild angioedema that was considered by the investigator 
to be not related to study drug. There were no adverse event reports of hypercorticism, adrenal 
suppression, decreased bone mineral density or associated consequences (i.e., vertebral fractures), 
glaucoma, cataracts, eosinophilic conditions, or Churg-Strauss syndrome adverse events across the 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. 
Although 1 patient treated with placebo had mild bronchospasm in a Phase 3 study, there were no 
adverse event reports of bronchospasm in patients treated with FS MDPI across the Phase 2 and Phase 
3 studies. 
Adverse Events in Adolescents 
FS MDPI was generally well tolerated in the adolescent population with an adverse event profile similar 
to that seen in adults. There was no apparent difference in the adverse event profile with regard to 
age, nor was there evidence of an effect of age on the adverse event profile of FS MDPI as compared 
with placebo. 
There were no reports of hypercorticism, adrenal suppression, decreased bone mineral density or 
associated consequences (i.e., vertebral fractures), glaucoma, cataracts, eosinophilic conditions, or 
Churg-Strauss syndrome adverse events across the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. Although effects on 
growth were not specifically evaluated in the FS MDPI programme, no adverse growth effects were 
reported for the 58 patients 12 to 17 years of age. 
There was no apparent difference in the adverse event profile of FS MDPI compared to that of the 
already marketed combination. 
Laboratory findings 
No clinically meaningful differences (versus active comparators or placebo) or patterns of abnormality 
associated with FS MDPI administration were observed in clinical laboratory evaluation parameter 
values across the clinical studies included in the clinical development programme. There were no cases 
of elevated alanine aminotransferase ≥3× upper limit of normal (ULN) with elevated total bilirubin ≥2× 
ULN. 
Although incidental abnormalities in potassium or glucose elevations were reported, there were no 
clinically meaningful differences (versus Advair Diskus or placebo) or potentially clinically important 
trends with FS MDPI administration. 
Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms 
There were no clinically meaningful differences (versus Advair Diskus or placebo) or potentially 
clinically important trends in vital signs (pulse rate and blood pressure), ECG intervals, or overall ECG 
assessments associated with FS MDPI administration across the clinical studies included in the clinical 
development programme. No controlled study data with continuous 24-hour ECG monitoring were 
collected using FS MDPI. 
Physical Examinations 
Across all clinical studies included in the clinical development programme, the greatest number of 
shifts in physical examination findings from normal to abnormal were reported for chest and lungs in 
the placebo groups. Overall, shifts from normal to abnormal in physical examination findings across all 
treatment groups were few and sporadic. 
Oropharyngeal Examination 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 123/147 
 
 
 
Safety was monitored by oropharyngeal examinations. Patients who demonstrated oropharyngeal signs 
consistent with oral candidiasis were evaluated by obtaining and analysing a swab of the suspect area. 
Any unfavourable, clinically significant change relative to baseline was reported as an adverse event. 
The incidence of positive swab test results was higher among patients treated with FS MDPI compared 
with placebo and similar to ADVAIR DISKUS. 
In the Phase 3 Safety Pool, the incidence of patients who reported an adverse event of oral 
candidiasis, including oropharyngeal candidiasis, appeared to be dose-related with higher incidences 
reported in FS MDPI-treated patients (1.6% to 3.4%) compared with placebo-treated patients (0.7%). 
As seen with other fluticasone-containing products, the incidence of oral candidiasis appears to be 
related to the dose of fluticasone. 
In the Phase 2/3 Safety Pool, the incidence oral candidiasis, including oral fungal infection, 
oropharyngeal candidiasis, and oropharyngitis fungal, was higher in the FS MDPI-treated patients 
(1.6% to 3.4%) compared with the placebo group (0.4%). 
In the long-term study (Study FSS-AS-305), the incidence of oral candidiasis was highest in patients 
treated with high-dose ADVAIR DISKUS (11%). The incidence of oral candidiasis was similar across the 
remaining treatment groups across the ICS/LABA cohorts (4% to 5%). 
Asthma Exacerbations 
Asthma exacerbations were categorised as mild, moderate, or severe at the investigator’s discretion. 
Severe asthma exacerbations were defined as requiring systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 days, 
hospitalisation, or emergency room visitation and were also labelled as serious adverse events in the 
Phase 3 and FSS-AS-305 studies. 
In the Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 Safety Pools, asthma exacerbations occurred at a lower frequency within 
and across all FS MDPI treatment groups (1% to 4%) compared to placebo (11% to 12%); the 
incidence was highest in the placebo group in Study FSS-AS-30017, reflecting the more severe disease 
in this study. The incidence of severe asthma exacerbations was low (≤1%) across all treatment 
groups. 
The incidence of asthma exacerbations that were recorded as serious adverse events in Study FSS-AS-
305 was primarily a result of the protocol definition. Initially, an asthma exacerbation was reported as 
a serious adverse event if it met the criteria for a severe asthma exacerbation. After a protocol 
amendment, however, an asthma exacerbation was reported as a serious adverse event only if it met 
the standard criteria for a serious adverse event. 
Within the ICS/LABA cohort in Study FSS-AS-305, the incidence of asthma exacerbation regardless of 
severity was similar between patients treated with FS MDPI and those treated with Advair Diskus at 
the mid-strength (13 [11%] and 5 [12%] patients, respectively). However, in the high-strength 
ICS/LABA cohort, the incidence was greater in the FS MDPI group (20 [15%] patients) than in the 
Advair Diskus group (3 [7%] patients). This open-label safety study was not designed to evaluate 
treatment differences in asthma exacerbation incidence. Prior history of asthma exacerbations was not 
collected and was not used to ensure proper balance in randomisation across the treatment groups. 
Thus, ad hoc statistical analyses were performed to determine if the incidence of asthma exacerbations 
was different across treatment groups. This analysis indicated that the incidence of asthma 
exacerbation events was not different between the FS MDPI and Advair Diskus groups, at both the 
mid- and the high-strengths in the ICS/LABA cohorts. The Applicant considered that the most likely 
explanation for the apparent differences is the rarity of the events and the smaller numbers of patients 
in the active comparator groups relative to the study drug groups (3:1 randomisation ratio). 
Urinary Cortisol Assessments 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 124/147 
 
 
 
Exogenously administered ICSs can result in suppression of endogenous corticosteroid production, 
especially at higher doses, thus 24-hour urine cortisol assessments were performed in Studies FSS-AS-
305 and FpS-AS-202. Differences in urine cortisol between treatment groups within cohorts were 
minimal, and there was no apparent trend for greater or lesser changes for study drug treatment 
compared with active comparator treatment. The magnitude of the changes did not appear to increase 
between weeks 14 and 26. In Study FSS-AS-305, there was no apparent trend for greater or lesser 
changes from baseline in urine cortisol level for FS MDPI or Advair Diskus groups. Adverse events 
associated with low urine cortisol findings were not reported for any patients in the FS MDPI or Advair 
Diskus groups. 
Safety in special populations 
There was no apparent evidence of an effect of sex (male or female), age (12 to 17 years, 18 to 64 
years, or ≥65 years), or race (white, black, or other races) in subgroups with reasonable sample sizes 
(i.e. >10) on the adverse event profile of FS MDPI as compared with active comparators or placebo. 
Thus, the applicant concluded that no dose adjustment for these factors is needed. 
The incidence of adverse events was higher among patients in the US compared with the non-US but 
appeared to be balanced between placebo and active treatment groups. 
Adolescent population 
FS MDPI was generally well tolerated in the adolescent population with an adverse event profile similar 
to that seen in adults. There was no apparent difference in the adverse event profile with regard to 
age, nor was there evidence of an effect of age on the adverse event profile of FS MDPI as compared 
with placebo. 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women that specifically test the effects 
of FS MDPI on pregnancy. However, the comparator products, Advair Diskus or Seretide Accuhaler, are 
recommended for use during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the risk to the foetus. 
Current asthma guidelines call for the use of moderate dose ICSs or corticosteroids with a LABA, in the 
treatment of moderate asthma in pregnant women and for combination therapy in severe asthma. 
Analyses of human birth defect databases have demonstrated a possible association between ICS 
usage and isolated anorectal atresia. A combination of a beta-agonist and ICS was associated with an 
increased risk of omphalocele and renal dysplasia. Since the data are insufficient to determine if there 
is any added risk to the foetus from the treatment, FS MDPI should be used during pregnancy only if 
the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. 
There are also no well-controlled human studies that have investigated the effects of FS MDPI on pre-
term labour or labour at term. Because of the potential for beta-agonist interference with uterine 
contractility, use of FS MDPI during labour should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits 
clearly outweigh the risks. 
There are no data from controlled trials on the use of FS MDPI by nursing mothers. It is possible that 
very low concentrations of Fp and salmeterol may appear in breast milk, but they are unlikely to affect 
the nursing infant. 
The following are known from the already approved combination:  
Fertility 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 125/147 
 
 
 
There are no data in humans. However, animal studies showed no effects of salmeterol or fluticasone 
propionate on fertility. 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicates no 
malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity related to Seretide. Animal studies have shown reproductive 
toxicity after administration of β2 adrenoreceptor agonists and glucocorticosteroids. 
Administration of Seretide to pregnant women should only be considered if the expected benefit to the 
mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus. 
The lowest effective dose of fluticasone propionate needed to maintain adequate asthma control should 
be used in the treatment of pregnant women. 
Breastfeeding 
It is unknown whether salmeterol and fluticasone propionate/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Studies have shown that salmeterol and fluticasone propionate, and their metabolites, are excreted 
into the milk of lactating rats. 
A risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue Seretide therapy considering the benefit of breastfeeding 
for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions have not been studied in the FS MDPI clinical programme, however drug-drug 
interactions with the components contained in FS MDPI have been described for Advair Diskus and 
Seretide Accuhaler.  
The drug-drug interactions of the already marketed product have been included in the approved SmPC 
in section 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction. 
No additional drug-drug interactions were observed during the trials with FS MDPI.  
Hepatic and Renal Impairment 
Formal PK studies using FS MDPI have not been conducted in patients with hepatic or renal 
impairment.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Withdrawals due to Adverse Events 
In the Phase 3 and Phase 2/3 Safety Pools, the incidence of adverse events leading to withdrawal was 
low and similar across treatment groups (0% to 3%). In the Phase 2/3 Safety Pool, asthma was 
reported as an adverse event leading to withdrawal by 5 (1.0%) patients who received placebo and 1 
patient (0.2%) who received FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg. 
Similar rates of withdrawal due to worsening asthma were seen among patients who received the low 
and mid doses in Study FSS-AS-301 (FS MDPI 50/12.5mcg: <1%, FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg: 0%) and in 
Study FSS-AS-30017 (FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg: <1%). A slightly higher withdrawal rate of 3% due to 
worsening asthma was observed at the high dose of 200/12.5 mcg. Patients treated with FS MDPI in 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 126/147 
 
 
 
each Phase 3 study withdrew due to worsening asthma at lower rates compared to patients who 
received placebo (Study FSS-AS-301: 3%; Study FSS-AS-30017: 13%). 
Among the adverse events that led to withdrawal from the study, the adverse events of URI and 
tachycardia were considered related to treatment with FS MDPI. 
In the long-term safety study, 11 patients overall withdrew from the study due to adverse events. No 
single adverse event preferred term was reported as a reason for withdrawal for more than 1 patient. 
Within and across the ICS/LABA cohorts, the incidence of these events was relatively similar. In the FS 
MDPI and Advair Diskus groups, the adverse events (in 1 patient for each group of events) of 
dizziness, nausea, and vomiting; gastroesophageal reflux disease; chest discomfort, feeling jittery, and 
cough; pain in extremity; rhinitis allergic; and asthma led to withdrawal from the study. 
The percentage of withdrawals due to adverse events (~1%) is considered low. However, there were 
imbalances between FS MDPI and active comparator. 
Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively, from post-marketing data sources (including non-serious reactions originating from 
solicited reports), from the date of launch in April 2017 until August 2019, 108 case reports concerning 
Airduo Respiclick (salmeterol + Fp) were received and processed in the applicant global safety 
database. Out of these 108 cases, 19 were assessed as serious. Fifteen of these 19 cases were from 
the same literature article titled “Inhaled corticosteroid related adrenal suppression detected by poor 
growth and reversed with ciclesonide”. None of these published cases are for FS MDPI/Airduo 
Respiclick as it was approved after the publication was submitted to the journal. 
Although primary adrenal disorders are uncommon in this patient population and more likely to be 
associated with the use of systemic corticosteroids, adrenal suppression remains an important 
identified risk linked to fluticasone use. Systemic adverse effects may occur with any ICS, particularly 
at high doses prescribed for long periods.  
From the efficacy point of view, no new significant efficacy or effectiveness information was revealed in 
the reporting period. 
Overall, from the data reviewed and analysed originating from post-marketing sources, no new safety 
issues and no signals were identified during the reporting period. 
There is no marketing experience with FS MDPI, since it has not been marketed yet. It appears that no 
new safety issues and no signals were identified during the reporting period for the combination of Fp 
and salmeterol. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Introduction 
A total of 9 clinical studies in adult and adolescent patients have been completed and support the 
safety of FS MDPI. The Phase 3 Safety Pool (Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017) served as the 
primary dataset for presentation and discussion of the safety profile of FS MDPI. Additionally, results 
from the Phase 2/3 Safety Pool (Studies FSS-AS-301, FSS-AS-30017, FpS-AS-201, and FpS-AS-202), 
a 26-week, open-label, long-term safety study (Study FSS-AS-305), and the other Phase 1 and 2 
studies (FSS-AS-201, FpS-AS-101, FpS-AS-102, and FSS-AS-10042) are presented where relevant as 
supportive information for safety assessment. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 127/147 
 
 
 
The demographics for the Phase 2/3 Safety Pool were overall similar to the reported prevalence of 
asthma in children, females, and males and are considered to be representative of the population 
proposed for treatment (i.e. patients who require regular treatment of asthma aged 12 years and 
older). 
Patient exposure  
A total of 3455 patients and healthy volunteers received at least 1 dose of study drug in the studies, of 
whom 904 received treatment with FS MDPI, all of whom received the doses proposed for 
commercialisation (FS MDPI 50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg). A total of 2637 patients were 
randomly assigned to the 12-week studies FSS-AS-301, FSS-AS-30017, FpS-AS-201, and FpS-AS-202, 
and 2625 received at least 1 dose of randomised treatment. Of these, 2194 patients completed 12 
weeks of treatment, of whom 519 patients received treatment with FS MDPI. In the 12-week studies, 
542 patients received treatment with FS MDPI; all of whom received the doses proposed for 
commercialisation. A total of 674 patients were randomly assigned to the 26-week study (FSS-AS-
305). Overall, 595 patients completed 26 weeks of treatment, of whom 226 patients received 
treatment with FS MDPI (FSS-AS-305). 
Adverse events 
The numbers of patients and healthy volunteers studied are considered sufficient for the well-studied 
and well-known fluticasone propionate and salmeterol active substances. 
No new safety signals were detected during the phase 3 studies with FS MDPI. 
A greater proportion of patients withdrew early because of worsening of asthma in the placebo 
compared to the active treatment groups. This was more evident in the Phase 2 studies where all 
patients meeting stopping criteria for worsening asthma were withdrawn, unlike in the Phase 3 studies. 
This resulted in a longer duration of exposure in the active treatment groups compared to the placebo 
group.  
In the 3 Phase 2 studies and 3 Phase 3 studies, the safety results for FS MDPI were overall similar to 
those of the comparator marketed product Advair Diskus. 
However, in Study FSS-AS-305, there were slight imbalances in the incidence of asthma exacerbations. 
Upon request by CHMP, the Applicant clarified that this safety study was not designed to detect 
differences in the incidences of asthma exacerbations, and there was no collection of baseline asthma 
exacerbation rates within the treatment groups. Moreover, asthma exacerbation events were relatively 
rare and, particularly in view of the 3:1 randomisation ratio, the imbalance seen was likely due to 
chance, according to the applicant. Furthermore, pre-amendment protocol, which stipulated that any 
severe asthma exacerbation had to be reported as a serious adverse event, may have inflated the 
number of asthma exacerbations that were considered serious adverse events. Numerically more 
asthma and severe asthma exacerbations were observed in the long-term study FSS-AS-305 than in 
both Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017. While it is challenging to make direct comparisons 
between data from different studies, there are a number of factors that likely contributed to these 
observed differences. The patients enrolled in the FS MDPI treatment groups in Study FSS-AS-305 had 
relatively more severe asthma. Also, the fact that Study FSS-AS-305 was more than twice the duration 
of Study FSS-AS-30017 may have contributed to the larger number of asthma exacerbations observed. 
As a result, an ad hoc analysis was conducted to compare exacerbations between treatments. 
Considering that the analysis found no difference in asthma exacerbations between the treatments, the 
most likely explanation for the apparent differences is the rarity of the events and the smaller numbers 
of patients in the active comparator groups relative to the study drug groups (due to the 3:1 
randomisation ratio in favour of the study drug groups). While the overall number of asthma 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 128/147 
 
 
 
 
exacerbations reported in the study was low and analysis showed that there were no differences 
between treatment groups, asthma exacerbations were examined in subgroups by age, gender, and 
race. Within each treatment group, none of the subgroups was disproportionately affected with asthma 
exacerbations. Analyses of the combined data for FS MDPI and Advair Diskus determined that the 
percentages of patients with asthma exacerbations did not differ greatly across the subgroups. 
Subgroups with greater numbers of asthma exacerbations were part of subgroups that were much 
larger than the subgroups with smaller numbers of exacerbations, and this most likely accounted for 
the small differences. This was supported by CHMP.  
The Applicant claimed that FS MDPI would offer an option for some patients who are unable to tolerate 
the currently available products, due to the lower doses presented within BroPair Spiromax. 
Nevertheless, it should be noted that no large difference in safety profiles were seen when comparing 
the FS MDPI to Advair Diskus. Furthermore, the applicant confirmed that the clinical development 
programme for FS MDPI did not include clinical trials designed to assess superiority of the safety profile 
of FS MDPI versus Advair Diskus, and no a priori statistical analysis was implemented to compare the 
safety profiles of the 2 ICS/LABA treatments. The Applicant has provided evidence that the MDPI 
device is most likely safe when used with the SABA rescue medication albuterol. In the case of FS 
MDPI, significantly lower amounts of both fluticasone and salmeterol are used which could probably be 
associated with lesser adverse events compared to approved products. However, based on the clinical 
safety design, no firm conclusion can be made. 
Frequently reported adverse events that occurred in at least 3% of FS MDPI-treated patients and more 
commonly than in patients treated with placebo included nasopharyngitis, cough, URI, and headache, 
which were not more common among active treatment patients relative to placebo, and oral 
candidiasis, which occurred primarily among active treatment patients as expected with the drug class. 
Serious adverse event/deaths 
There was no apparent difference in the adverse event profile of FS MDPI compared to that of the 
already marketed combination. 
One death was reported in the FS MDPI clinical development programme which was considered by the 
investigator and the sponsor not to be related to the study drug.  
Laboratory findings 
No clinically meaningful differences (versus active comparators or placebo) or patterns of abnormality 
associated with FS MDPI administration were observed in clinical laboratory evaluation parameter 
values across the clinical studies included in the clinical development programme. This was agreed by 
CHMP. 
Safety in special populations 
There was no apparent evidence of an effect of sex (male or female), age (12 to 17 years, 18 to 64 
years, or ≥65 years), or race (white, black, or other races) in subgroups with reasonable sample sizes 
(i.e. >10) on the adverse event profile of FS MDPI as compared with active comparators or placebo. 
Thus, the applicant concluded that no dose adjustment is needed. 
Safety in patients from Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 who were treated with FS MDPI aged 
65 years and older was reviewed in detail upon request by CHMP. In these studies, there were no 
serious adverse events or deaths reported in the patients aged 65 years and older. In the other studies 
(Studies FpS-AS-201 and FSS-AS-305), there were a total of 6 patients, aged 65 years and older, who 
experienced serious adverse events [Study FpS-AS-201: 1 serious adverse event of volume depletion 
(placebo); Study FSS-AS-305: 1 serious adverse event of malignant melanoma (Advair Diskus 250/50 
mcg), 1 serious adverse event of arthritis (FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg), 1 serious adverse event of

pneumonia (Advair Diskus 500/50 mcg), 1 serious adverse event of basal cell carcinoma (FS MDPI 
200/12.5 mcg), and 1 serious adverse event of pulmonary mass, benign nodule (Fp MDPI 200 mcg)]. 
Overall, for the FS MDPI treatments in Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017, the incidence of total 
adverse events in patients aged 65 years and older was slightly higher than that in patients younger 
than 65 years old (42.6% vs 36.9%, respectively), a difference reflective of the increased prevalence 
of comorbid conditions in the elderly. The evaluation of safety concluded that the overall incidence of 
adverse events was comparable between the younger and older age groups. The events occurring with 
a slightly increased incidence in the elderly group are common in this age group. Thus, there were no 
trends to suggest that the older population differs substantially from the rest of the population with 
respect to safety.  
Upon request by CHMP, the applicant clarified that the safety profile of BroPair Spiromax did not differ 
between adolescent patients and adults. Although the number of adolescents included was rather 
limited, CHMP agreed that the available safety data are considered sufficient for the evaluation of the 
safety profile of FS MDPI in adolescents.  
FS MDPI demonstrated a favourable safety profile in the regular treatment of asthma in patients aged 
12 years and older. The results from both pooled analyses and individual studies evaluating FS MDPI 
treatment are consistent with the extensively characterised profile of the currently available inhaled 
ICS/LABA combination drug, Seretide Accuhaler, and include URI, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, oral 
candidiasis, cough, bronchitis, headache, nausea, vomiting, and musculoskeletal pain. No new safety 
issues were identified for all doses of FS MDPI evaluated. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions 
Drug-drug interactions have not been studied in the FS MDPI clinical programme, however drug-drug 
interactions with the components contained in FS MDPI have been described for Advair Diskus and 
Seretide Accuhaler. Those have been adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Discontinuations due to adverse events 
The percentage of withdrawals due to adverse events (~1%) is considered low.  
Long-Term Safety 
The known history of systemic and local corticosteroids and β2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs has shown 
that long-term use may result in immunosuppression, hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, 
reduction in bone mineral density or associated consequences (i.e. vertebral fractures), growth effects, 
cardiovascular effects, CNS effects, and glaucoma and cataracts, especially at higher doses. ICS use in 
patients with asthma has not been associated with evidence of immunosuppression, nor was any 
evidence of immunosuppression found in the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 Safety Pools. In the long-term 
study (Study FSS-AS-305), there was no evidence of opportunistic or severe infections suggestive of 
immunosuppression with FS MDPI or Advair Diskus treatment. No instances of the adverse events 
hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, reduction in bone mineral density or associated consequences 
(i.e. vertebral fractures), growth effects, and glaucoma and cataracts were observed. Nevertheless, 
and in line with similar products of the same class, appropriate warning has been included in section 
4.4. of the SmPC.  
Overall, there were no safety concerns for any of the 3 dose strengths of FS MDPI. The clinical safety 
development programme has confirmed that FS MDPI is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for 
adult and adolescent patients with asthma. The number of studies as well as the number of adult 
patients (<65 years of age) are considered sufficient to draw conclusions on the safety of the 
combination of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, especially when combination of the same active

substances have been extensively studied, approved and marketed (e.g. Advair Diskus or Seretide 
Accuhaler).  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the clinical safety assessment of FS MDPI is considered comprehensive and adequate to 
support an approval of the mid- and high-dose strengths for the treatment of Asthma in both Adult and 
adolescents aged 12 years and older.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways associated with airways inflammation and 
hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, 
and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with 
widespread but variable airflow obstruction. Patients with asthma can experience exacerbations that 
may be life threatening and carry a significant burden to patients and the community. 
Asthma is a common disease affecting an estimated 340 million people worldwide and despite existing 
therapies, there are still significant unmet medical needs. The Global Burden of Asthma Report 
estimates that 23.7 million disability-adjusted life years are lost annually due to asthma, representing 
1% of the total global burden. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, there 
were 383,000 deaths due to asthma in 2015. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The long-term treatment goals are symptom control and risk reduction. Symptom control aims to have 
only occasional daytime symptoms without sleep disturbance or exercise limitation. Risk reduction 
involves preventing exacerbations, preserving lung function and avoiding asthma deaths.  
Patients not adequately controlled with a maintenance low dose ICS and ‘as needed’ short-acting 
beta2-agonists or LABA (GINA step 2 and 3) have the following treatment options in addition to 
optimising treatment compliance and modifying risk factors; 
• 
• 
Combination low dose LABA/ICS with as needed short acting beta2-agonists  
Combination low dose formoterol/ICS maintenance and reliever. 
The Applicant developed the FS MDPI, a multidose dry powder inhaler with the combination of Fp, an 
ICS, and salmeterol, a LABA. The FS MDPI has been developed to supply multiple dosage strengths of 
Fp with a fixed dosage of salmeterol (50/12.5 [low], 100/12.5 [mid], and 200/12.5 [high] mcg) to 
allow treatment of the entire spectrum of asthma patients not adequately controlled with inhaled 
corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-acting β2 agonists.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
To demonstrate the efficacy of FS MDPI, 2 replicate, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-group, 
12-week Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies (FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017) in adult and adolescent 
patients (12 years of age or older with baseline FEV1 40% to 85% of predicted normal) with asthma to 
evaluate the efficacy of FS MDPI across a spectrum of asthma severities were conducted. In addition to 
these studies, a 26-week, open-label, long-term safety and efficacy study with the mid- and high-
strength doses of FS MDPI was conducted (Study FSS-AS-305). 
Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 were designed to show superiority of Fp (nominal doses of 50, 
100, and 200 mcg) over placebo and to show superiority of the FS combination (nominal doses of 
50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg) over Fp in adults and adolescents in a broad range of asthma 
severity. The co-primary endpoints in both studies were the change from baseline in trough (morning

pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator) FEV1 at week 12 and the standardised baseline-adjusted 
post-dose FEV1 AUEC0-12h at the week 12 visit, analysed for the subset of approximately 300 patients 
who performed post-dose serial spirometry.  
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics of patients enrolled to both pivotal studies were 
very similar.  
In the 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies (FSS-AS-301 and FS-AS-30017), 1375 patients were randomised to Fp 
MDPI, FS MDPI, or placebo treatment, and of those patients, 1360 were included in the FAS 
population. The majority of patients in all treatment groups in the FAS population completed the study; 
only 9% of patients overall withdrew from the studies prematurely. 
The long-term Study FSS-AS-305 was a 26-Week Open-Label Study to Assess the Long-Term Safety of 
Fluticasone Propionate Multidose Dry Powder Inhaler and Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol Multidose 
Dry Powder Inhaler in Patients 12 Years of Age and Older with Persistent Asthma. The primary 
objective of the Study FSS-AS-305 was to evaluate the long-term safety of Fp inhalation powder in 2 
strengths and FS inhalation powder in 2 strengths when administered with the Teva MDPI device over 
26 weeks in patients 12 years of age and older with persistent asthma. The secondary objective of the 
study was to evaluate the safety of Fp MDPI in comparison to Flovent HFA and FS MDPI in comparison 
to Advair Diskus. The efficacy objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Fp MDPI in 
comparison to Flovent HFA and FS MDPI in comparison to Advair Diskus. Therefore, efficacy was not a 
primary or secondary objective in this study. The principal efficacy variable was the change from 
baseline in trough FEV1 over the 26-week treatment period. 
Demographic characteristics in Study FSS-AS-305 were generally well-balanced across the treatment 
groups and similar to the pooled and individual Phase 3 studies.  
In the long-term safety Study FSS-AS-305, 674 patients were randomised to receive Fp MDPI, FS 
MDPI, FLOVENT HFA, or Advair Diskus, and 673 patients received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
were evaluated for safety in the study. A total of 79 (12%) patients withdrew from the study. 
A monotherapy of Fp, fluticasone propionate multidose dry powder inhaler (Fp MDPI), was included in 
many of the studies and is mentioned in this submission, but the Fp MDPI monotherapy product is not 
part of this submission and was not submitted for approval in the EU. 
This clinical development programme attempted to confirm that FS MDPI is an effective and well-
tolerated treatment for adult and adolescent patients with asthma. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In both pivotal studies (FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017), the primary objectives were met. 
- Low-strength Combination (FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg) 
The low-strength combination was assessed in Study FSS-AS-301.  
Change from baseline in trough FEV1 
The change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 0.319 L for the FS MDPI low-strength combination 
compared with 0.053 L for placebo and 0.172 L for Fp MDPI 50 mcg. When FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg was 
compared to placebo, the difference was 0.266 L (p<0.0001), and when compared to Fp MDPI 50 mcg, 
the difference was 0.147 L (p=0.0022).  
Standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 136/147 
 
 
 
The change from baseline post-dose FEV1 AUC0-12h was 0.399 L for the FS MDPI low-strength 
combination (50/12.5 mcg) compared to 0.074 L for placebo and 0.268 L for Fp MDPI 50 mcg. When 
FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.325 L (p=0.0000) and when 
compared to Fp MDPI 50 mcg, the difference was 0.131 L (p=0.0322).  
- Mid-strength Combination (FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg) 
Change from baseline in trough FEV1 
The mid-strength combination was assessed in patients with both mild to moderate asthma (Study 
FSS-AS-301) and moderate to severe asthma (Study FSS-AS-30017).  
In patients with mild to moderate asthma, the change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 0.315 L for the 
FS MDPI mid-strength combination compared to 0.053 L for placebo and 0.204 L for Fp MDPI 100 mcg. 
When FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.262 L (p<0.0001), and 
when compared to Fp MDPI 100 mcg, the difference was 0.111 L (p=0.0202).  
In patients with moderate to severe asthma, the change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 0.271 L for 
the FS MDPI mid-strength combination compared to -0.004 L for placebo and 0.119 L for Fp MDPI 100 
mcg. When FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.274 L (p<0.0001), 
and when compared to Fp MDPI 100 mcg, the difference was 0.152 L (p=0.0005).  
Standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h 
In patients with mild to moderate asthma, the change from baseline post-dose FEV1 AUC0-12h was 
0.408 L for the FS MDPI mid-strength combination compared to 0.074 L for placebo and 0.254 L for Fp 
MDPI 100 mcg When FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.335 L 
(p=0.0000), and when compared to Fp MDPI 100 mcg, the difference was 0.154 L (p=0.0076).  
In patients with moderate to severe asthma, the change from baseline post-dose FEV1 AUC0-12h was 
0.442 L for the FS MDPI mid-strength combination compared to 0.121 L for placebo and 0.260 L for Fp 
MDPI 100 mcg. When FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.322 L 
(p=0.0000), and when compared to Fp MDPI 100 mcg, the difference was 0.182 L (p=0.0010).  
- High-strength Combination (FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg) 
Change from baseline in trough FEV1 
The change from baseline in trough FEV1 was 0.272 L for the FS MDPI high-strength combination 
compared to -0.004 L for placebo and 0.179 L for Fp MDPI 200 mcg. When FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg was 
compared to placebo, the difference was 0.276 L (p-value<0.0001), and when compared to Fp MDPI 
200 mcg, the difference was 0.093 L (p=0.0309). The difference between FS MDPI and Fp MDPI for the 
trough FEV1 endpoint reflects the contribution of salmeterol at the end of the dosing period.  
Standardised baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h 
The change from baseline post-dose FEV1 AUC0-12h was 0.446 L for the FS MDPI high-strength 
combination compared to 0.121 L for placebo and 0.267 L for Fp MDPI 200 mcg. When FS MDPI 
200/12.5 mcg was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.326 L (p=0.0000), and when compared 
to Fp MDPI 200 mcg, the difference was 0.179 L (p=0.0009). The difference between the high-strength 
FS MDPI and Fp MDPI provides evidence for the significant added benefit of salmeterol in the high-
strength combination.  
Comparisons of combination therapy with monotherapy were not controlled for multiplicity but 
indicated an overall improvement for FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg compared with Fp MDPI 50 mcg and Fp 
MDPI 100 mcg and for FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg compared with Fp MDPI 100 mcg in Study FSS-AS-301

and improvement for FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg compared with Fp MDPI 100 mcg and Fp MDPI 200 mcg 
and for FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg compared with Fp MDPI 200 mcg in Study FSS-AS-30017. 
Pooled data from Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 by dose group showed similar baseline 
trough FEV1 values across all FS MDPI and placebo groups. At week 12, all FS MDPI dose groups 
showed greater increases in mean change trough FEV1 (0.340, 0.300, and 0.290 L in the 50/12.5, 
100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg groups, respectively) than the placebo group (0.104 L). At week 12, the 
increase in mean baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h was similar (0.366, 0.356, and 0.369 L) in the FS 
MDPI 50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg groups, respectively. All FS MDPI dose groups showed 
greater increases in mean baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h than the corresponding Fp MDPI groups 
(0.212, 0.192, and 0.194 L in the 50, 100, and 200 mcg groups, respectively) and the placebo group 
(0.032 L). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
Low strength: FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg compared to Fp MDPI 50 mcg 
The change from baseline in the weekly average daily rescue medication use over 12 weeks decreased 
by a greater extent with FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg compared to Fp MDPI 50 mcg (difference of least 
squares [LS] mean: -0.239 puffs/day; nominal p=0.0640).  
Medium strength: FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg compared to Fp MDPI 100 mcg 
The mid-strength combination demonstrated a significant improvement over the mid-strength mono-
product for the AQLQ, as well as for daily rescue medication use and the percentage of asthma control 
days. 
High strength: FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg compared to Fp MDPI 200 mcg 
The high-strength combination demonstrated a significant improvement over the high-strength mono-
product for the 3-following symptom-related endpoints: the change from baseline in the weekly 
average of the daily asthma symptom score; the weekly average of daily rescue medication use and 
the percentage of symptom-free days. 
Note: the symptomatic asthma endpoints were included in secondary pre-specified analyses, and thus 
were not adequately powered to show a statistically significant effect. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  duration  of  both  pivotal  studies  was  only  12  weeks;  however,  it  is  considered  acceptable  for 
substances with a well-known efficacy profile. In both pivotal studies, the comparison of FS MDPI vs Fp 
MDPI for trough FEV1 was not included in the primary endpoint. However, a sequential approach was 
used  in  the  study  design,  first  comparing  the  mono-product  to  placebo  to  demonstrate  a  significant 
effect, and then comparing the combination to the mono-product, to prove the efficacy of Fp and the 
combination. Moreover, two different endpoints were used to demonstrate efficacy of the ICS and the 
LABA included in FS MDPI, which act by different mechanisms to improve pulmonary function.  
An additional benefit was seen when salmeterol was added to FS MDPI (fixed-dose combination 
containing fluticasone propionate and salmeterol), however better clinical efficacy results were 
reported for the mid- and high-strengths investigated in the pivotal studies and therefore only the mid- 
and high strengths are considered to be approvable. The effect observed with the mid- and high dose 
is considered clinically significant and relevant for the intended population. 
For BroPair Spiromax, the following indication was initially proposed by the applicant:  
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 138/147 
 
 
 
BroPair Spiromax is indicated for use in adults and adolescents 12 years and older.  
BroPair Spiromax is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma where use of a combination product 
(inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist) is appropriate: 
- 
patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-
acting β2 agonist  
or 
- 
patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 
agonist. 
Nevertheless, the second part of the indication: ‘patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled 
corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist’ (substitution indication) was not adequately supported by the 
clinical development programme. Therefore, interchangeability between FS MDPI and the approved 
comparator Advair Diskus (or other approved products) cannot be claimed. The applicant agreed to 
amend the indicated to the ‘step-up’ part only (i.e. ‘patients not adequately controlled with inhaled 
corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-acting β2 agonist’) in line with the clinical efficacy data 
provided in support of this application.  
The final indication agreed by CHMP is as follows:  
BroPair Spiromax is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 
years and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-
acting β2 agonists. 
Moreover, as the doses to be used with BroPair Spiromax do not correspond to any approved doses for 
other salmeterol/fluticasone propionate containing products; the following text was added to section 
4.2 of the SmPC to avoid any potential confusion and/or dosing errors: 
‘Note that the delivered doses for BroPair Spiromax are different from other salmeterol/fluticasone 
propionate containing products on the market. The products are thus not interchangeable on dose 
bases and different dose levels (including medium/high doses of fluticasone propionate) for different 
products do not necessarily correspond to each other.’ 
The data submitted for patients older than 65 years of age were considered to be limited by CHMP. 
Furthermore, there was a greater variability in the treatment responses observed in the >65 years of 
age subgroup. However, this could be attributed to the variation in a single response associated with a 
small sample size and not a unique characteristic of this population. Overall, it was considered that the 
older population did not respond differently to FS MDPI than the population as a whole. Thus, there is 
no need to adjust the dose in elderly patients. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of the individual active substances fluticasone propionate and salmeterol is generally 
well characterised either as monotherapy and/or double fixed dose combinations. The overall safety 
profile of BroPair Spiromax was consistent with the expected safety profile for these classes of drugs 
used in the treatment of patients with asthma. 
Overall, 3455 patients and healthy volunteers received at least 1 dose of study drug in the studies, of 
whom 904 received treatment with FS MDPI, all of whom received the doses proposed for 
commercialisation (FS MDPI 55/14, 113/14, and 232/14 mcg; metered doses).

Adverse reactions that occurred in at least 3% of patients in any FS MDPI treatment group included 
urinary tract infection (URI) or inflammation, cough, headache, and musculoskeletal pain, which were 
more common among active treatment patients relative to placebo, and oral candidiasis, which 
occurred primarily among active treatment patients, as expected with this class of products. Those are 
known common adverse reactions related to treatment with fluticasone propionate and salmeterol in 
patients with asthma. Few adverse events were reported for vital signs (specifically blood pressure), 
ECG, or cardiac abnormalities; however, there were no serious adverse events in these categories. 
The reports of hypersensitivity reactions were low, no patients treated with FS MDPI had an adverse 
event of anaphylactic shock or angioedema, and the incidence of infections and infestations was similar 
across study groups.  
A detailed evaluation of adverse events due to localised infections of the mouth and pharynx with C. 
albicans, paradoxical bronchospasm and upper airway symptoms, immediate hypersensitivity 
reactions, evidence of immunosuppression, hypercorticism and adrenal suppression, reduction in bone 
mineral density or associated consequences (i.e., vertebral fractures), effects on growth, hypokalaemia 
and hyperglycaemia, potential cardiovascular and CNS effects, glaucoma and cataracts, and 
eosinophilic conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome was performed to evaluate these known issues 
associated with the use of Advair Diskus or Seretide Accuhaler in an asthma population. No new safety 
concerns were identified. However, and in line with similar products of the same class, appropriate 
warning has been included in section 4.4. of the SmPC.  
There were slight imbalances in the incidence of asthma exacerbations in the long-term safety Study 
FSS-AS-305. Numerically more asthma and severe asthma exacerbations were observed in the long-
term study FSS-AS-305 than in both Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017. However, an ad hoc 
analysis was conducted to compare exacerbations between treatments. Considering that the analysis 
found no difference in asthma exacerbations between the treatments, the most likely explanation for 
the apparent differences is the rarity of the events and the smaller numbers of patients in the active 
comparator groups relative to the study drug groups (due to the 3:1 randomisation ratio in favour of 
the study drug groups). Asthma exacerbations were examined in subgroups by age, gender, and race. 
Within each treatment group, none of the subgroups was disproportionately affected with asthma 
exacerbations. Analyses of the combined data for FS MDPI and Advair Diskus determined that the 
percentages of patients with asthma exacerbations did not differ greatly across the subgroups.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The duration of the long-term safety study (FSS-AS-305) was considered to be short (i.e. six months 
safety study) and therefore uncertainties remain on the unfavourable effects that could arise with the 
use of FS MDPI in a real-world setting especially in the under-represented populations (i.e. adolescents 
and elderly patients). However, considering the well-recognised safety profile of fluticasone propionate 
and salmeterol, this study was considered adequate to assess the safety of BroPair Spiromax.  
A greater proportion of patients withdrew early because of worsening asthma in the placebo group vs 
the active treatment groups. This was more evident in the Phase 2 studies where all patients meeting 
stopping criteria for worsening asthma were withdrawn, as opposed to the Phase 3 studies. This 
resulted in a longer duration of exposure in the active treatment groups vs the placebo group.  
In the long-term safety Study FSS-AS-305, there were slight imbalances in the incidence of asthma 
exacerbations. This open-label safety study was not designed to detect differences in the incidences of 
asthma exacerbations (which were relatively rare) and there was no collection of baseline asthma 
exacerbation rates within the treatment groups, which can contribute to observed differences. The ad 
hoc statistical analyses of all asthma exacerbations and severe asthma exacerbations showed no 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021  
Page 140/147 
 
 
 
differences within cohorts between the respective study drug group and active comparator for each 
dose strength and with dose strengths combined, indicating that apparent differences are most likely 
due to chance. 
While there was no apparent difference in the adverse event profile of FS MDPI compared to the safety 
profile of already marketed combination products containing the same actives substances, the 
significantly lower amounts of both fluticasone and salmeterol used in FS MDPI could be associated 
with lesser adverse events compared to approved products. However, since the clinical development 
programme for FS MDPI did not include clinical trials designed to assess superiority of the safety profile 
of FS MDPI versus Advair Diskus, and no a priori statistical analysis was implemented to compare the 
safety profiles of the 2 ICS/LABA treatments, no conclusion can be made.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Fixed-dose combination products containing a LABA and an ICS are considered as a standard therapy 
for patients with asthma. There are many LABA/ICS products with an established efficacy and safety 
profile available on the EU market including approved ICS/LABA containing the same actives 
substances as BroPair Spiromax and for which the clinical efficacy and clinical safety have been well 
characterised and demonstrated. The aim of the clinical programme for BroPair Spiromax was to 
identify doses of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol that were comparable in efficacy but with lower 
systemic exposure than the currently marketed products containing the same active substances (e.g. 
Advair Diskus, Seretide Accuhaler) and to confirm that BroPair Spiromax is an effective and well-
tolerated treatment for adult and adolescent patients with asthma. 
A broader indication in Asthma was initially sought. To support the initially proposed ‘step-up’ 
indication in Asthma (i.e. patients not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as 
needed’ inhaled short-acting β2 agonist); two replicate, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-
group, 12-week Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies (FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017) in adult and 
adolescent patients (12 years of age or older with baseline FEV1 40% to 85% of predicted normal) with 
asthma to evaluate the efficacy of BroPair Spiromax low-, mid- and high- strengths (FS MDPI 50/12.5 
mcg, FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg, respectively) across a spectrum of asthma 
severities were conducted. 
In both pivotal studies (FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017), the primary objectives were met. When 
BroPair Spiromax low strength (FS MDPI 50/12.5 mcg) was compared to placebo, the difference was 
0.325 L (p=0.0000). When BroPair Spiromax mid-strength (FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg) was compared to 
placebo, the difference was 0.274 L (p<0.0001). When BroPair Spiromax high-strength (FS MDPI 
200/12.5 mcg) was compared to placebo, the difference was 0.326 L (p=0.0000).  
Comparisons of combination therapy (BroPair Spiromax FS MDPI) with monotherapy (Fp MDPI) were 
not controlled for multiplicity but indicated improvement for BroPair Spiromax compared with the ICS 
monotherapy (Fp MDPI) in both pivotal phase 3 studies. 
Pooled data from both pivotal phase 3 Studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017 by dose group showed 
similar baseline trough FEV1 values across all BroPair Spiromax (FS MDPI) and placebo groups. At 
week 12, all FS MDPI dose groups showed greater increases in mean change trough FEV1 (0.340, 
0.300, and 0.290 L in the 50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg groups, respectively) than the 
placebo group (0.104 L). At week 12, the increase in mean baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUEC0-12h was 
similar (0.366, 0.356, and 0.369 L) in the FS MDPI 50/12.5, 100/12.5, and 200/12.5 mcg groups, 
respectively. All FS MDPI dose groups showed greater increases in mean baseline-adjusted 
FEV1 AUEC0-12h than the corresponding Fp MDPI groups (0.212, 0.192, and 0.194 L in the 50, 100, and 
200 mcg groups, respectively) and the placebo group (0.032 L). 
To support the initially proposed ‘substitution’ indication in Asthma (i.e. patients already adequately 
controlled on both inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2 agonist), a 26-week, open-label, long-term 
Assessment Report 
EMA/141972/2021

safety and efficacy study with the mid- and high-strength doses of BroPair Spiromax was conducted 
(Study FSS-AS-305). However, the study was not powered to show differences in efficacy. Thus, the 
substitution indication was not adequately supported by the clinical development programme and was 
therefore withdrawn by the applicant. In addition, interchangeability between BroPair Spiromax and 
the approved comparator Advair Diskus (or other approved products) cannot be claimed. This has been 
adequately reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
In addition, the presented results for the proposed BroPair Spiromax low-strength combination (FS 
MDPI 50/12.5 mcg) were not compelling. The low-strength combination did not show a statistically 
significant improvement over the low-strength mono-product for any of the symptom-related 
endpoints in Study FSS-AS-301 and thus a clear benefit for symptoms or asthma control was not 
considered to be shown; and was thus withdrawn from the dossier.  
A favourable clinical effect was demonstrated only for the mid- and high-strength combination (FS 
MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg, respectively) in the following indication:   
‘BroPair Spiromax is indicated in the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 
years and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-
acting β2 agonists.’ 
Taking into account the well-established safety profile of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, the 
six-month long-term safety study (FSS-AS-305) adequately assessed the safety of BroPair Spiromax. 
Based on the safety results presented from this long-term safety study, there is currently no trend to 
suggest a negative benefit risk for safety. The overall safety profile of the BroPair Spiromax medium 
and high ICS dose strengths (FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg, respectively) in the 
asthma population investigated was comparable to the one previously established in asthma patients. 
Overall, the main ADRs that have been observed are known class effects of inhaled products including 
ICS and LABA. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Generally, for a new controller treatment the preferred endpoint is exacerbations. Measurement of lung 
function parameters alone is considered to be insufficient in the assessment of therapeutic effect. 
However,  the efficacy of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol is well-recognised and the efficacy 
results for the mid- and high strengths (FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg, 
respectively), as demonstrated in the phase 3 pivotal studies FSS-AS-301 and FSS-AS-30017, were 
clinically significant and relevant. In addition, the overall safety profile of BroPair Spiromax was 
comparable to the one previously established in asthma patients. Overall, the benefit of BroPair 
Spiromax mid- and high strengths (FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and FS MDPI 200/12.5 mcg, respectively) 
outweighs the risk in patients with asthma.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The B/R of BroPair Spiromax mid- and high strengths (FS MDPI 100/12.5 mcg and FS MDPI 200/12.5 
mcg, respectively) is positive for the regular treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents aged 12 
years and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and ‘as needed’ inhaled short-
acting β2 agonists.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Anakinra (trade name Kineret) is a recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor 
antagonist, which binds to the interleukin-1 receptor and prevents the activity of the cytokines IL-1α 
and IL-1β by competitively inhibiting their binding to interleukin-1 receptor type 1, thereby controlling 
active inflammation. 
Anakinra was first approved in EU/EEA in 2002 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults. 
Anakinra was approved for Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) in 2013 and Still’s disease 
in 2018 in adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body weight of 
10 kg or above. 
This type-II variation application includes the proposed new indication: 
Kineret is indicated for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Kineret should be given in 
combination with colchicine, if appropriate. 
The recommended dose for both adults and children weighing 50 kg or more is 100 mg/day by 
subcutaneous injection. Patients weighing less than 50 kg should be dosed by body weight with a 
recommended dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a rare monogenic inherited condition that shares the same 
pathophysiological feature resulting from the activation of the inflammasome with several other 
hereditary periodic fever syndromes, e.g., CAPS. FMF is caused by mutations in the Mutated 
Mediterranean fever-associated gene (MEFV) gene coding for pyrin, which is a component of the 
inflammasome functioning in inflammatory response and production of Il-1β (Figure 1).  
FMF manifests with a typical clinical picture with recurrent febrile episodes with abdominal, chest and 
joint pain.

Figure 1 The activation of the inflammasome in hereditary periodic fever syndromes 
Epidemiology  
FMF has traditionally been considered an autosomal recessive disease. FMF was originally restricted to 
populations living around the Mediterranean basin. For example, there is an estimated total of 100 000 
FMF patients in Turkey1. The prevalence rate in France in 2013 was estimated at 1 in 5000 individuals, 
i.e. 5000 to a maximum of 10 000 patients2. Significant number of patients are also found in Germany, 
Greece, Cyprus, and Italy 1,3,4. Most FMF patients in France are of North African origin, and most of 
those who live in Germany are of Turkish origin. Most FMF patients in Italy are located in the central 
and southern parts of the country, probably originating from Phoenicians and other ascendants who 
came by way of the sea1. Because of ongoing migration, the future incidence is likely to increase in the 
EU 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
FMF is typically presented with recurrent febrile attacks, accompanied by signs of peritonitis, pleuritis 
or acute synovitis, lasting 1 to 3 days, and resolving spontaneously. The skin may be affected by 
erysipelas-like erythema. Attacks occur randomly, from once per week to once in several months, and

patients are free of symptoms between the attacks. Emotional stress, fatigue, surgery, menstruation, 
vigorous exercise, and cold exposure may trigger an attack, but no definite precipitant is known.  
Typical laboratory manifestations of an FMF attack are elevated acute-phase reactants including 
erythrocyte sedimentation (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), fibrinogen, 
haptoglobin, C3, and C4. The most severe and potentially life-threatening complication of FMF is 
secondary amyloid A amyloidosis being the primary cause of premature death in FMF patients.  
The median age of disease onset in children was in one study 2.6 (IQR 1.2 to 4.9) years with 16 % 
having onset below 2 years of age. The lowest age of onset described is 4 months. Early onset may 
cause more severe disease.  
FMF is diagnosed by the clinical picture and the diagnoses can be supported, but not necessarily 
excluded, by genetic testing. Various diagnostic criteria have been suggested, including the Tel 
Hashomer criteria. 
Management 
According to a recent (European League Against Rheumatism) EULAR guideline5 there are 2 main goals 
in the treatment of FMF: 
• 
• 
To prevent the clinical attacks.  
To suppress chronic subclinical inflammation and elevation of acute phase reactants, in 
particular SAA protein, and its consequences, including secondary AA amyloidosis and other 
long-term complications. 
Colchicine, an alkaloid with inhibitory effects on multiple cellular functions, including microtubule 
assembly, cell adhesion, and inflammasome activation is in the EULAR guideline recommended to be 
given as soon as the clinical diagnosis is established. The colchicine dose ranges between 1 and 3 mg 
daily and is determined clinically on the basis of its effect on the prevention of attacks. Continuous 
therapy with colchicine prevents FMF attacks in 60 to 65 % of patients and induces partial remission in 
a further 30 to 35 %. In addition, regular use of colchicine reduces the long-term risk of amyloidosis.  
In patients who fail to respond to colchicine or who cannot tolerate it, biological drugs, especially IL-1 
treatment, should be considered according to the recent EULAR guideline. The long-acting IL-1β 
antibody canakinumab was approved for treatment of FMF in the EU/EEA on 23 October 2009. 
2.1.2.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Kineret was first approved in EU on 8 March 2002 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 
adults. It was then approved for Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) in 2013 and Still’s 
disease in 2018 in adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body 
weight of 10 kg or above. 
Since the introduction of anakinra in 2002 in the EU for the treatment of RA, a number of inflammatory 
disorders have been found to benefit from IL-1 inhibition. Although not approved for the treatment of 
FMF, there are numerous publications since more than a decade from several countries, reporting the 
usefulness of anakinra in FMF.

On October 2019, the MAH applied for an extension of indication for Kineret, under Article 16 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex II (point 2a). 
This proposed indication is for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Kineret should be 
given in combination with colchicine, if appropriate. The proposed target population is adults, 
adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body weight of 10 kg or aboveThis 
application is primarily based on bibliographical data from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study in patients with FMF (Ben-Zvi et al. 2017)6. 
In addition, the following studies and analysis have been submitted as supportive data: 
•  Bibliographic data from 12 retrospective uncontrolled clinical studies of anakinra in patients 
with FMF (Table 1); 
•  Recent data from an ongoing real-world study conducted at the Tel Hashomer hospital in Israel 
(interim report); 
• 
Efficacy and safety data in the paediatric population from anakinra treatment of a related 
hereditary periodic fever syndrome sharing the same pathophysiological features as FMF: CAPS 
(MAH study report 03-AR-0298 from the pivotal study submitted in support of the CAPS 
indication); 
•  MAH´s data from company-sponsored studies of anakinra in other indications; 
•  Data from MAH’s post-marketing safety database in various indications, including FMF. 
Studies and case reports describing anakinra treatment of FMF were identified through literature 
search to further support the application. 
The MAH did not receive scientific advice for this application. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The principal biological action of anakinra is to antagonise the effects of IL-1 cytokines, which is 
utilised to mitigate the symptoms of IL-1 driven diseases such as FMF. No additional pharmacodynamic 
studies relating to the proposed indication have been performed. In essence, the pharmacodynamic 
studies performed show that anakinra efficiently inhibits the action of the cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β. 
These cytokines are proinflammatory and mediates local and systemic inflammation in rheumatoid 
arthritis, cryopyrinopathies and other IL-1 driven diseases, e.g. FMF and Still’s disease. 
An extensive number of safety pharmacology and toxicology studies have been conducted (all included 
in the original MAA) covering general toxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity 
(tumour stimulation) and antigenicity/immunotoxicity. All studies were conducted in compliance with 
GLP. 
The application also refers to two studies in juvenile animals also submitted with the procedure (II-
0056) for the indications of active Still’s disease, Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) and 
Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD) in 2017. One study (GLP compliant) was specifically aimed to

investigate memory and learning function in developing juvenile rats treated with anakinra to support 
paediatric indications. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Anakinra is a recombinant protein consisting of 153 amino acids with a molecular mass of 17.3 kDa 
and almost identical to the naturally occurring nonglycosylated form of human IL-1Ra except for the 
addition of an N-terminal methionine residue. IL-1Ra is a member of the IL-1 cytokine family. The IL-1 
signalling pathway consists of two agonists (IL-1α and IL-1β), two classes of receptors (IL-1RI and IL-
1RII), which exist in both membrane bound and soluble forms, and one soluble antagonist (IL-1Ra). 
The membrane bound IL-1RI present in various types of cells is responsible for the initial signalling 
action of IL-1α and IL-1β. The circulating receptor antagonist IL-1Ra binds to the type I receptor and 
antagonises the actions of IL-1α and β by a competitive binding to the receptor without possessing any 
intrinsic agonist activity. In this way it can suppress the inflammatory processes mediated by IL-1α 
and IL-1β. The endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) binds with approximately a 100-fold 
higher affinity to IL-1RI than to IL-1RII (Dripps et al. 1991)7. 
Anakinra has been demonstrated to be active in animal models of inflammatory diseases, such as rat 
and guinea pig experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models of multiple sclerosis; rat models of 
stroke and head trauma; mouse models of graft-versus-host disease, corneal allograft survival; and 
several animal models of arthritis. A more detailed description of the pharmacological and 
pharmacodynamics properties of anakinra was provided in the original MAA. 
IL-1 cytokines are major drivers of many autoinflammatory diseases and the most powerful 
endogenous pyrogens and potent recruiters and activators of neutrophils and macrophages. 
Dysregulation of the IL-1 cytokines has been demonstrated to result in the so-called monogenic 
autoinflammatory disorders such as cryopyrinopathies (CAPS/ Neonatal Onset Multisystem 
Inflammatory Disease (NOMID)) and FMF. 
FMF is an autosomal recessive inherited autoinflammatory disease with mutations in a gene designated 
MEFV. The MEFV gene encodes a 781 amino acid protein known as pyrin. The majority of the 
mutations are localised in exon 10, which encodes the B30.2/SPYR domain of the molecule where most 
recessive mutations associated with FMF are found. Disease-associated mutations produce less of the 
pyrin protein, i.e. a negative regulator of caspase1, leading to a net increase in mature IL-1β. Indeed, 
the mutant form of pyrin encoded by the MEFV gene has been shown to enhance inflammation through 
IL-1β secretion and production. Monocytes from FMF patients with MEFV-mutation stimulated with 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) displayed an increased secretion of IL-1β (Omenetti, et al. 2014 - NEW) 8. 
Likewise, in a mouse model of FMF (FMF-KI), aberrant caspase-1 activation mediated the maturation 
and release of IL-1β (Sharma et al. 2017 - NEW) 9. Mice deficient in pyrin, demonstrate increased 
maturation and secretion of IL-1β (Chae et al. 2003 - NEW)10. In contrast to its biologic homolog IL-
1α, IL-1β requires proteolytic cleavage by caspase-1 to become activated.

2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in relation to non-clinical pharmacokinetics which was 
considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology  
No new toxicology studies were submitted. However, the studies in juvenile animals are summarised 
here as background information.  
Juvenile toxicity study: a feasibility study in the neonatal rat 
Study title: Anakinra: A Feasibility Study by Subcutaneous Injection in Rats to Determine the 
Tolerability of the Proposed High Dose Level and Confirm Feasibility of Once and Twice Daily Dosing 
(Charles River Study no. 497888).  
The objective of this study was to determine the tolerability of the proposed high dose level and 
confirm feasibility of once and twice daily dosing of anakinra, when administered by s.c. injection to 
juvenile rats. This study was not conducted in compliance with GLP. 
Anakinra was administered to two groups of 4 male and 4 female Sprague-Dawley rat pups in each 
group, each received anakinra by subcutaneous (SC) injections of 2 mL/kg. The doses of anakinra 
were 100 mg/kg/day (Group 1) and 200 mg/kg/day (100 mg/kg/bid) (Group 2), respectively. The 
formulation was used as received, i.e. anakinra drug substance containing 50 mg anakinra/mL. The 
pups were treated every day from day 4 until day 10 postpartum (Group 1) or until day 19 postpartum 
(Group 2).  
All the animals were observed twice daily for mortality/moribundity and examined for reaction to 
treatment regularly throughout the day on dosing days. Following completion of dosing, all animals 
were sacrificed.  
There were no clinical signs or effects on body weight in any of the animals administered with 
anakinra.  
The administration of anakinra was well tolerated at dose levels of 100 mg/kg after administration 
either once or twice daily to juvenile animals.  
Juvenile toxicity study: a 6-week neonatal/juvenile study in the rat 
Study title: Anakinra: A 6 week neonatal / juvenile study to determine the adverse effects on memory 
and learning functions in rats after subcutaneous injection followed by a one-month recovery period 
(Charles River Study no. 498001).  
The objective of this study was to determine any adverse effects of anakinra on the learning and 
memory function when administered by twice daily subcutaneous injections to juvenile rats and after a 
one moth recovery period. In addition, exposure to anakinra was determined in serum and 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The study was conducted in compliance with GLP (serum and CSF analysis 
were performed as non-GLP).  
Anakinra was administered to three groups of 20 male and 20 female Sprague-Dawley rat pups, each 
received anakinra twice daily from Day 7 postpartum until at least Day 44 postpartum (where Day 0 
was the day of birth) by SC injections of 2 mL/kg. The daily doses of anakinra were 20, 60 and 200 
mg/kg (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/bid). Control animals received vehicle (10 mM citrate buffer, 140 mM 
sodium chloride, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.1% Polysorbate 80, pH 6.5).

The following parameters and endpoints were evaluated in all animals: clinical signs, body weights, 
multiple Y water maze test (function of learning), and gross necropsy. Two groups of one control and 
one of high dose animals, 5 males and 5 females in each group, were designated satellite animals, 
used for collecting brain and liver, serum and CSF samples for later weight measurements and 
bioanalysis.  
The serum levels of anakinra showed that all Group 4 high dose animals treated at 200 mg/kg/day 
were exposed to anakinra and there was low variability between animals. The anakinra levels in the 
high dose animals treated at 200 mg/kg/day ranged between 15 and 33 μg/mL with a mean of 22 
μg/mL, 2 hours post-dosing. The anakinra levels in CSF from high dose animals ranged between 0.13 
and 0.22 μg/mL with a mean of 0.18 μg/mL, i.e. approximately 1 % of the serum levels. There was no 
anakinra detected in the serum samples or CSF samples of control animals.  
Signs of reaction to treatment with anakinra were confined to an increase in the incidence of animals 
with red staining of the muzzle and a wet muzzle at 60 and 200 mg/kg/day when compared to the 
controls.  
There was no effect of dose administration on body weight gains.  
In all anakinra dosed groups, the performance in the Y-maze learning test was similar, both during the 
treatment period and in the recovery period.  
Liver and brain absolute weights in all anakinra dosed animals were comparable to the controls. 
Brain/body weight ratios in all anakinra dosed animals were also comparable to the controls.  
Administration at 200 mg/kg/day in males and 60 or 200 mg/kg/day in females was associated with an 
increase in non-adverse clinical observations (fur staining and wet fur) which were found to recover 
after the cessation of dosing. The anakinra-treated animals did not show any signs of adverse effects 
on the hippocampus-dependent memory and learning function test when compared with vehicle-
treated control animals, either on last week of dosing or after a one-month recovery period.  
Overall, the administration of anakinra by twice daily SC injection to Sprague-Dawley rats from Day 7 
postpartum to at least Day 44 postpartum was in general well tolerated in rats at levels of up to 200 
mg/kg/day. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Anakinra is the recombinant form of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) produced in 
E coli K12 using recombinant DNA techniques. E coli K12 is non-pathogenic, non-toxigenic, and has an 
extended history of safe large-scale use. It has also been shown to survive poorly in the environment 
and is not known to have adverse effects on humans, plants or other microorganisms. 
Approval of the application for the addition of a therapeutic indication does not increase the use of the 
active moiety and does not alter significantly the concentration or distribution of the substance, its 
metabolites, or degradation products in the environment. 
Considering the protein nature of anakinra, it is not expected to be stable or remain biologically active 
in the environment and it is unlikely to pose a risk to the environment even if adding a new therapeutic 
indication. The absence of an updated ERA is therefore acceptable.

2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of anakinra have been defined 
and documented by non-clinical studies in accordance to current practice and regulatory guidelines 
presented and assessed by CHMP at the time of the MA. 
No anakinra related effects were seen in safety pharmacology studies investigating analgesic activity, 
central/autonomic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or renal functions at that time.  
In the present application, no additional pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetics or toxicology studies 
relating to the proposed indication have been performed. However, the results of two toxicology 
studies in juvenile rats were summarised in the non-clinical overview. 
The results of the juvenile toxicity study (Study 497888) showed that the administration of anakinra 
was well tolerated at dose levels of 100 mg/kg after administration either once or twice daily to 
juvenile animals.  
The results of the juvenile toxicity study (Study 498001) showed that the administration of anakinra 
by twice daily subcutaneous injection was in general well tolerated in rats at levels of up to 
200 mg/kg/day. The cognitive performance of the anakinra treated adolescent animals was tested in a 
multiple Y water maze test. The anakinra-treated animals did not show any signs of adverse effects on 
the hippocampus-dependent memory and learning function test when compared with vehicle-treated 
control animals, either on last week of dosing or after a one-month recovery period. The pre-clinical 
safety data section of the SmPC is considered up to date and no further changes are proposed in this 
application. This is acceptable to CHMP. 
The MAH has provided a justification for not performing any additional ERA studies, due to the active 
substance being a protein. This is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP. The subcutaneous use of anakinra in both the paediatric and the adult population is 
supported from a non-clinical perspective as per details assessed in previous applications. There were 
no relevant findings from the non-clinical safety evaluation that indicated any risk of undesired effects 
in juvenile patients at the proposed dosing regimen.  
No environmental studies have been conducted to support the request for the extension of the 
indication. This is acceptable considering that anakinra is a protein and it is therefore unlikely to be 
stable or remain biologically active in the environment and pose a risk to the environment even when 
adding a new therapeutic indication. 
The pre-clinical safety data section of the SmPC (section 5.3) remains unchanged.

•  Tabular overview of clinical studies  
Efficacy data have been collected in a minimum of 200 colchicine-resistant, colchicine-intolerant or 
amyloidosis patients in 13 published studies, all including at least 5 patients, and in an ongoing interim 
retrospective real-world study of a cohort of 44 patients treated with anakinra at the Tel Hashomer 
hospital during the last decade (Table 1). 
The assessment of known and potential risks of anakinra treatment in FMF is mainly based on data 
from the use of anakinra in company sponsored clinical studies in multiple indications and the MAH 
post-marketing safety database, which includes ICSRs from patients treated for FMF as well as other 
indications in addition to bibliographic data from studies presented in Table 1.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
All published studies from the literature search related to clinical pharmacology were reviewed. No 
published studies reporting PK data in FMF patients were identified in the literature search. The MAH 
has not conducted any PK studies in patients with FMF. 
For the evaluation of the immunogenicity data (anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation) in this application, 
7 studies in different indications were evaluated. 
The PK of anakinra has previously been extensively described in healthy volunteers and in patients 
(RA, CAPS: Neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID)/ Chronic infantile neurological, 
cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA), JIA and SJIA) in the original MAA and the application for 
CAPS including the potential for interactions with other drugs. 
The effects of age (in adult and paediatric patients), body weight, renal function (a major potential issue 
in FMF as a result of amyloidosis in non-adequately treated patients) have also been addressed across 
indications. 
Anakinra PK data summarised in this submission were from healthy subjects and patients who were 
given anakinra s.c. doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg/day, fixed doses of 30 to 100 mg, or i.v. doses of 1 mg/kg 
or 70 mg. The age range was 2.26 to 86 years and the body weight 10 to 135 kg.  
Absorption 
Following s.c. administration of anakinra the bioavailability was complete (95.4 %), the median tmax 
was 4 to 6 hours and the terminal half-life was 5.7 to 8.26 hours, reflecting absorption rate-limited 
elimination. 
Distribution 
No new study has been submitted regarding anakinra distribution. 
Several publications indicate that anakinra in therapeutic concentrations penetrates the blood-brain-
barrier. 
Distribution into the CSF was demonstrated in the study submitted in support of the CAPS indication 
(study 03-AR-0298). The median CSF concentration increased from a baseline value before the first 
dose of anakinra of 15.7 pg/mL to a Month 3 concentration of 797 pg/mL. Relative to the concentration 
in serum, the exposure in CSF was low and the median CSF/serum ratio can be calculated to <0.2 %. 
Elimination 
Renal filtration and proximal tubular cell metabolism account for the majority of the elimination of 
anakinra. After adjusting for creatinine clearance (CLcr) and body weight, gender and age were not 
significant factors for the mean plasma clearance. 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 17/67 
 
 
 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The PK of anakinra was linear within the studied dose range.  
The PK of anakinra have been described in other indications and other populations, including CAPS 
which is a hereditary periodic fever syndrome in many ways comparable to FMF.  
It diseases such as RA, CAPS, JIA, and Still’s disease (SJIA) may be assumed to be similar in FMF 
patients is acceptable that the PK results obtained in healthy volunteers and in patients with other 
inflammatory. 
The conclusions and recommendations related to pediatric patients and renal impaired patients with 
FMF are similar to those in patients with other inflammatory diseases such as RA, CAPS, JIA, and Still’s 
disease (SJIA) and are acceptable. 
Special populations 
Children 
An increased dose-adjusted CL/F (clearance relative to bioavailability) and a decreased exposure have 
been indicated in paediatric patients. To achieve similar anakinra plasma concentrations, paediatric 
patients should be dosed by body weight, while paediatric patients with a body weight above 50 kg 
and adults may be given a fixed dose. 
Impaired renal function 
A study in chronic renal failure patients undergoing dialysis showed that the mean plasma clearance in 
subjects with chronic renal failure was reduced to 13 % of the value reported in healthy subjects, 
suggesting that the kidney is the major organ responsible for the elimination of anakinra. For patients 
with severe renal impairment (Clcr<30 mL/min) or end stage renal disease including dialysis the 
prescribed anakinra dose is recommended to be administered every other day. This recommendation is 
based on PK data and simulations in subjects with severe renal impairment and end stage renal 
disease (ESRD).  
In another study where anakinra PK was compared in subjects with various degrees of renal 
impairment, systemic anakinra exposure increased with decreasing renal function following a single 
s.c. dose of 100 mg anakinra. CL/F reduction was 16 %, 50 %, 70 % and 75 % in subjects with mild, 
moderate, and severe renal impairment, and subjects with ESRD, respectively, as compared to 
subjects with normal renal function. With appropriate adjustment of dosage anakinra can be given to 
patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD. 
Ethnicity 
FMF is restricted to people of Mediterranean descent. Thus, a comparison of PK across ethnic groups is 
not relevant for this application and not specifically discussed here.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No new studies to assess drug metabolism and drug interactions in FMF have been performed in 
addition to those included in the MAA, conducted in healthy volunteers and patients with other 
diseases.

EMA/236936/2020

The formation of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines 
(e.g., IL-1) during chronic inflammation. Thus, it may be expected that for an IL-1 receptor antagonist, 
such as anakinra, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be increased, i.e., normalised, during 
treatment. This would be clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. In 
patients receiving such drugs concomitantly with anakinra, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or drug 
concentration is recommended, with subsequent adjustment of the individual dose of medical product 
if necessary. 
Anakinra is expected to be used as add-on therapy to colchicine in many cases of FMF. Since colchicine 
is a CYP3A4 substrate, initiation of anakinra treatment may reduce the blood concentration of 
colchicine and thereby its clinical effect. However, in the published clinical studies in which anakinra 
was used as add-on therapy to colchicine, the overall anti-inflammatory effect of anakinra and 
colchicine increased upon initiating anakinra therapy, as documented by the reduced and normalized 
levels of inflammatory PD biomarkers SAA, CRP, and Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacology data for anakinra originate from the following sources: 
• 
• 
• 
PK studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with inflammatory diseases (RA, CAPS, JIA, 
and SJIA), including paediatric patients and patients with chronic renal failure. 
Published pharmacodynamics (PD) data in patients with FMF. 
Immunogenicity data (formation of anakinra-ADAs and NAbs) in patients with RA, CAPS, JIA, 
and SJIA. 
Mechanism of action 
FMF is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene coding for pyrin, which is a component of the 
inflammasome functioning in inflammatory response and production of Il-1β. Experimental studies 
showed that pyrin plays a pivotal role in the regulation of both inflammation and apoptosis, and 
mutated pyrin leads to full-blown inflammation characterized by excessive IL-1 secretion in FMF. 
Anakinra is a recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist, which binds to the 
interleukin-1 receptor and prevents the activity of the cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β by competitively 
inhibiting their binding to interleukin-1 receptor type 1, thereby controlling active inflammation. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
PD data were derived from at least 220 adult FMF patients given 100 mg daily s.c. administration of 
anakinra and at least 12 paediatric FMF patients given 1 to 2 mg/kg daily of anakinra. Duration of 
anakinra treatment was a few months in most studies ranging from a few days up to 98 months.   
The inflammatory biomarkers and the biomarkers reflecting renal function in individual studies are 
summarised in Table 2.

1) In studies where anti-interleukin-1 treatment were administered including both anakinra and canakinumab, the 
number of anakinra treated patients are presented as well as the total number of patients in the study. Results in 
these studies are presented for the total population (anakinra and canakinumab treated patients), since anakinra 
results are not presented separately in these publications. CRP, C-reactive protein; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate; SAA, Serum amyloid A.  
Inflammatory biomarkers were used as PD parameters in all 12 studies evaluating PD and renal 
biomarkers in 3 of these studies evaluating PD. A total of 239 patients received anakinra in the 12 
published studies with PD data in patients with FMF. In three studies, 30 out of 214 patients received 
another IL-1-blocker (canakinumab); the results do not distinguish between treatment with 
canakinumab or with anakinra, however the vast majority of patients (184 of 214) received anakinra 
treatment, so the results can generally be attributed to anakinra.   
In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Ben-Zvi et al. 2017) in patients with 
colchicine-resistant FMF defined as experiencing at least 1 attack per month in any of the FMF sites 
despite having received a maximal tolerated dose of colchicine. The inflammatory biomarkers CRP and 
SAA were measured before and at the end of treatment with study drugs. Daily administration of 
anakinra 100 mg for 4 months in 12 adult patients with colchicine-resistant FMF reduced inflammation 
as seen by lowering of CRP and SAA levels.

1) Comparison of mean values at study termination (4 months) 
In the retrospective study with review of 172 FMF patients (Akar et al. 2018) the majority (88%) of 
patients received anakinra and 12 % received canakinumab. Following at least 6 months anti-IL-1 
treatment, the inflammatory biomarkers CRP and ESR were statistically significantly reduced. The 
urinary protein excretion was statistically significantly reduced with a reduced number of patients with 
proteinuria.

A total of 44 colchicine-resistant FMF patients were included in the interim report from the ongoing 
retrospective study at the Tel Hashomer hospital, Israel. Median CRP decreased from 14.8 mg/dL (IQR 
2.5 to 71.2) before treatment to 2.3 mg/dL (IQR 0.5 to 13) during treatment, and median ESR 
decreased from 37 mm/hr (IQR 10.75 to 53.75) to 17 mm/hr. (IQR 10.5 to 13.9).  
The effect of anakinra in FMF patients on PD biomarkers has been summarised in Table 5 and Table 6.

The studies and case reports included in the submission showed that the inflammatory PD biomarkers 
CRP, ESR and SAA were decreased and normalised following anakinra treatment in FMF patients, 
supporting the mechanism of action of anakinra in FMF.  
The effect of anakinra treatment in FMF patients with amyloidosis on the renal biomarkers serum 
albumin and 24-h urine protein excretion support the renal preservative effect of anakinra in these 
patients. 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity of anakinra was not evaluated in patients with FMF in any published studies 
identified in the literature search, or in any internal study. 
ADA and NAb data were derived from company-sponsored clinical studies, including patients with JIA, 
SJIA, RA, and CAPS (CAPS patients not tested for NAb) who were given anakinra s.c. daily doses of 
0.04 mg/kg to 5.2 mg/kg. 
During the blinded phase of a study in patients with JIA including SJIA patients (following a 12-week 
open-label treatment with anakinra), 72 % of patients in the anakinra group and 44 % patients of 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 24/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients in the placebo group were ADA-positive. No patient treated with anakinra tested positive for 
NAbs. No ADA-related trends were observed in the rate and occurrence of AEs. Among the patients 
with SJIA, 71.4 % of the patients in the anakinra group (and no patients in the placebo group) were 
ADA-positive. No patient tested positive for NAbs. 
Anakinra-ADAs were reported in 3 studies in patients with RA, for 2.5 %, 51.1 %, and 60.5 % of 
patients in each study. Among these, 0.3 %, 1.9 % and 3.3 % of patients in each study tested positive 
for NAbs.  
In study 03-AR-0298 (submitted in support of the CAPS indication), ADA occurrence as well as the 
impact on various outcome measures, were estimated in patients with severe CAPS. 
Anakinra ADA assessments were made at Month 1, 3, 6 and then every 6 months until Month 60. No 
patient had anakinra ADAs at baseline. The proportion of patients with antibodies at least once post-
baseline was 82.5 %. During the first 36 months, the proportion of patients with antibodies (ADA+) 
ranged from 42.9 % (Month 1) to 78.6 % (Month 3). The number and proportion of patients with 
anakinra ADA at baseline, at the time point when the highest proportion of ADA+ patients was 
observed (Month 3), and the end of the study (Month 60) is shown in Table 7. At the end of study, 
50 % of the patients were ADA+.

During the CAPS study there was no consistent trend for dose modifications, change in DSSS (Disease 
Diary Symptom Sum Score) or treatment-emergent AEs for ADA- and ADA+ patients. Thus, the 
majority of the patients with CAPS on anakinra treatment for up to 5 years developed transient or 
persistent anakinra ADAs. Anakinra ADA was not associated with clinical adverse reactions, diminished 
efficacy or changed PK. All patients with CAPS responded favorably to treatment. 
Dose recommendations in FMF 
Adult patients   
The anakinra dose recommended for adults is 100 mg/day and is based on published data in patients 
with FMF, including the recently published double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in FMF 
(Ben-Zvi et al. 2017). 
In these publications, including > 220 adult patients with FMF, anakinra at a daily dose of 100 mg 
resulted in clinically relevant response, reduced and normalized levels of inflammatory biomarkers 
CRP, ESR and SAA and was well tolerated. 100 mg/day is also the approved dose for the RA indication 
and for Still´s disease in the EU.   
The 100 mg/day was also the dose given to 41 of the 44 patients at the Tel Hashomer hospital (Kivity 
2018, Interim report) which resulted in a clinically relevant response, reduced and normalised levels of 
inflammatory biomarkers CRP and ESR and was well tolerated in the majority of patients. 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 25/67 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric patients   
In paediatric patients with FMF (body weight < 50 kg) anakinra 1 to 2 mg/kg once daily is 
recommended. This dose level is based on 9 publications including a total of > 40 children, where 
1 to 2 mg/kg/day has been shown to provide a clinically relevant response, to reduce and normalise 
levels of inflammatory biomarkers CRP and ESR and to be well tolerated. Anakinra 1 to 2 mg/kg/day is 
also the approved starting dose in CAPS, with a maximum daily dose of 8 mg/kg. Once daily dosing of 
1 to 2 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 4 mg/kg is approved in EU for Still´s disease.  
Patients with renal impairment  
For patients with severe renal impairment (defined as Clcr < 30 mL/min, as estimated from serum 
creatinine levels) or end stage renal disease including dialysis the prescribed anakinra dose is 
recommended to be administered every other day. This recommendation is based on PK data and 
simulations in subjects with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease.   
The maximum tolerated dose of anakinra has not been established. No dose limiting toxicities were 
observed during clinical trials in patients with RA and CAPS. The highest doses reported have been 
given in an investigator sponsored clinical study of anakinra in subarachnoidal haemorrhage. In total 6 
patients were given anakinra as an i.v. bolus of 500 mg over 1 minute, immediately followed by a 10 
mg/kg/hr infusion over 24 hours. There were no new or unexpected AEs, and no SAEs considered 
related to anakinra treatment by either the investigator or the MAH. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
This submission is based on bibliographic data only.  
No new PK data have been submitted and no PK data are available in patients with FMF. However, the 
PK of anakinra has been investigated in both adults and children down to 8 months of age and >10 kg 
in other inflammatory indications, including CAPS - a related hereditary periodic fever syndrome - 
sharing the same pathophysiological features as FMF.  
The PK of anakinra is linear and age, body weight and sex are not significant factors for clearance 
relative to bioavailability (CL/F). A previously assessed Pop PK model has predicted a higher clearance 
in paediatric subjects and a higher dose compared to adults is needed to reach similar exposure. Renal 
clearance is a significant factor for CL/F and adjusted dosing is appropriate in subjects with severe 
renal impairment or ESRD. 
It is agreed that no differences in PK is expected across indications, and absence of PK data in FMF is 
therefore in this case acceptable.  PK of anakinra is comparable across indications/populations and 
extrapolation to FMF is considered acceptable.  
Anakinra is approved in children with CAPS from 8 months of age and with a body weight > 10 kg. No 
additional data in paediatric patients have been submitted but it can be accepted that these age and 
weight restrictions also apply to the FMF disease indication.  
In patients with FMF, mutation of the MEFV gene encoding for pyrin is leading to malfunctioning and 
overproduction of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the FMF inflammasome. Untreated FMF is characterised by 
increased CRP and SAA. Administration of Kineret results in a decrease in acute phase reactants (e.g. 
CRP and SAA). 
Immunogenicity and formation of ADAs and NAbs have not been investigated in FMF. The incidence of 
ADAs is high in CAPS, but does not appear to have an impact on efficacy, safety or PK. However, since 
anti-anakinra antibodies and NAbs were not evaluated in the FMF population the impact of NAbs on 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 26/67 
 
 
 
efficacy and safety, is therefore unknown. Even so, as it is not expected that patients with FMF will 
react differently than CAPS patients or patients with JIA, SJIA, RA, especially in terms of 
immunogenicity, and as there is also no indication that ADAs against anakinra cross-react with 
endogenous IL-1Ra in patients it is agreed that this concern is only reflected in RMP. RMP section 
SVII.3.1 Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks is updated accordingly 
with the information that no immunogenicity studies have been performed in FMF patients but due to 
similarities of FMF with other periodic fever syndromes, there are no indications that FMF patients react 
differently than patients with the approved indications. 
No dose finding study has been conducted in FMF. In most of the published studies included to support 
the submission, a dose of 100 mg/day anakinra in adult and 1 to 2 mg/kg/day in paediatric subjects 
(children weighing less than 50 kg) had been administered. In children with inadequate response the 
dose can be escalated up to 4 mg/kg/day. 
In previous anakinra submissions, dosing every other day has been approved in subjects with severe 
renal impairment or ESRD. This also applies to FMF 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology has been adequately described, mainly by data previously submitted 
in other inflammatory indications, to support the use of anakinra in FMF including the proposed dose.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response studies are included in this application. The proposed dose is discussed in the clinical 
pharmacology sections. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Anakinra for Colchicine-Resistant Familial Mediterranean Fever (Ben-Zvi et 
al 2017)  
Methods 
Design 
The main study was single-centre, randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled over a treatment 
period of 4 months. 
Study participants 
Patients enrolled in the study were adults with FMF (age range ≥18 years to ≤65 years) who were 
diagnosed according to the Tel Hashomer criteria. They were carriers of at least 2 MEFV mutations and 
had experienced at least 1 attack per month in any of the 4 FMF sites (abdomen, chest, joints, skin) 
despite having received a maximal tolerated dose of colchicine (dosage ≥2 to ≤3 mg/day). The FMF 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 27/67 
 
 
 
was thereby defined as colchicine-resistant. Patients intolerant to these dose levels of colchicine (with 
intolerance mainly manifested as symptoms of diarrhoea or abdominal upset or both) were included if 
their dosage was at least 1.5 mg/day. The patients continued colchicine treatment during the study. 
Treatments 
The study duration was 4 months. The patients received either anakinra or placebo as a daily self-
administered subcutaneous injection of 100 mg/day from prefilled syringes. Concomitant colchicine 
treatment was 2.1-2.2 mg/day. In both placebo and anakinra group, 92 % took other (unspecified) 
concomitant mediations during the trial. 
Objectives 
Primary efficacy outcomes were number of attacks per month, and number of patients with a mean of 
<1 attack per month.  
Febrile manifestations reported by patients were considered to be attacks only if they met the criteria 
defining attacks, and were confirmed by one of the study team members. The criteria defining an 
attack included all of the following symptoms: fever of ≥38°C lasting 6 hours to 7 days accompanied 
by painful manifestations in either the abdomen (with features consistent with a diagnosis of 
peritonitis), the chest (with features consistent with a diagnosis of pleuritis), the joints (with features 
consistent with a diagnosis of lower extremity large joint monoarthritis), or the skin (with features 
consistent with a diagnosis of erysipeloid rash). 
The secondary efficacy outcomes included the number of attacks per FMF site, levels of acute phase 
reactants, quality of life (QoL) as assessed using a 10-cm VAS, and the use of analgesic agents. 
Two post hoc analyses were also performed: 
•  Survival analysis with an endpoint of 4 attacks. The 4-attack target was based on the main 
inclusion criterion: at least 1 attack per month multiplied by 4 months (study duration). 
• 
Proportion of patients who achieved improvement with anakinra or placebo treatment, 
according to the modified familial FMF50 score. The calculation was based on the percentages 
of patients with ≥3 of the 4 following items change of at least 50 %; 1) the total number of 
attacks, 2) number of joint attacks, 3) CRP and SAA levels (or reaching normal values, defined 
as ≤5 mg/L for CRP and ≤10 mg/L for SAA), 4) and quality of life rating. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Sample size 
From the published paper: Originally, based on the assumption of a mean of 2.5 attacks per patient 
per month at baseline and a rate of 50% improvement with anakinra treatment, a sample size of 20 
patients per group was calculated to allow for detection of the differences between the anakinra and 
placebo groups with a power of 90% (using nQuery Advisor, version 2.1). However, due to slow 
enrolment and based on actual data, an interim analysis with re-evaluation of the sample size was 
performed. At this point, the evaluation was based on the actual mean of 5 attacks per patient per 
month at baseline, with a group mean of 1.66 attacks per patient per month in the anakinra group and 
3.49 attacks per patient per month in the placebo group, and a common standard deviation of 1.55, 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 28/67 
 
 
 
which led to a calculated sample size requirement of 12 patients per group, to allow for detection of 
differences between the anakinra and placebo groups with a power of 80% 
Randomisation and blinding 
From the published paper: Patients were recruited consecutively (by order of arrival) from our FMF-
dedicated clinic, and were randomly assigned, in a blinded manner, to receive treatment with either 
anakinra or placebo. Assignment to either the anakinra group or the placebo group was based on a 
predetermined key, unknown to both the investigators and the patients, that was established by an 
external company (TFS Trial Form Support, Lund, Sweden). The randomization was stratified by sex. 
During the study, patients continued to receive the treatments they had been taking prior to the study, 
particularly colchicine. Analgesic drugs used prior to recruitment were allowed as needed, but their use 
was monitored. 
Statistical methods 
From the published paper: Primary and secondary study outcomes were determined by comparing the 
mean values between the groups at study termination. Due to the small sample size, statistical 
analysis was based on the nonparametric Wilcoxon–Mann-Whitney rank sum test and the median test 
for quantitative parameters. The chi-square test was used for data classified as categorical. A Kaplan- 
Meier survival function curve analysis was performed using the log-rank test. Analyses were performed 
using 2-tailed tests. P values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
Because of dropouts, differences in the total number of attacks, number of attacks per site, number of 
AEs, and use of analgesics between the anakinra and placebo groups over the study period were 
adjusted for the actual time of patient participation in the study, and differences in levels of acute-
phase reactants and QoL between the groups were based on the last value available.

From the published paper: Physician examination was performed at the time of randomization, at the 
termination visit (mandatory), and during other study site visits, if required. Baseline parameters, 
including the physical examination findings, detailed medical history, mean number of attacks and 
body sites involved, and QoL evaluation, were obtained by the physician during the initial visit. QoL 
was also assessed at study termination. The study nurse communicated weekly with the patients by 
telephone, and patients visited the study site clinic twice (on days 30 and 60) for close monitoring of 
patient compliance, assistance with the interpretation of symptoms as attacks, and for guidance and 
care for AEs, including injection site reaction. Patients were encouraged to call the nurse and visit the 
study site, as necessary. Laboratory tests (blood and urine) and pregnancy tests were performed at 
each study site visit (on days 0, 30, 60, and 120). Two poststudy telephone calls by the study nurse 
were scheduled for days 150 and 180, to assess the development of long-term AEs. All study data 
were recorded in case report forms, including data transferred from patient diaries.

Baseline data 
In total, 25 patients with colchicine-resistant FMF (14 women) were enrolled; 12 randomised to receive 
anakinra and 13 to receive placebo. At randomisation, the patient groups were generally comparable in 
aspects relevant to evaluation of treatment effects (Table 8).

Outcomes and estimation 
The mean number of attacks per patient per month was statistically significantly lower (p=0.037) in 
those receiving anakinra (1.7) compared to placebo (3.5). The number of patients with <1 attack per 
month was significantly higher in the anakinra group; 6 patients, compared to none in the placebo 
group (p=0.005) (Table 9). In the anakinra group, 7 patients had a >90 % reduction in their stated 
attack frequency, while the frequency of attacks improved to a lesser degree in 5 patients. The 
difference between the anakinra and placebo groups in the individual sites reached statistical 
significance only for attacks in the joints (mean 0.8 and 2.1 respectively; p=0.019) indicating that the 
difference in mean total number of attacks was mainly driven by the lower number of attacks in the 
joints.  
A beneficial effect of anakinra was also noted in QoL (mean VAS score 7.7 in the anakinra group versus 
4.2 in the placebo group; p=0.045) (Table 9).  
Numerically lower CRP (3.9 versus 19.9 mg/L) and SAA (11.1 versus 110.3 mg/L) were noted for the 
anakinra treated patients at the last measurement compared to placebo (Table 9).

Ancillary analyses 
The post hoc survival analysis showed that the placebo-treated patients reached the target of 4 attacks 
significantly faster than the anakinra-treated patients (p=0.015 for difference in survival probability 
between groups, mean ±SD 39.6 ±22.2 days vs. 89.8 ±51.6 days) (Figure 3).

Retrospective uncontrolled studies 
Interim report of an ongoing study with anakinra at the Tel Hashomer hospital in Israel 
(Kivity 2018) 
Methods 
The present submission includes an interim report describing 44 patients with FMF who have been 
treated in a real word data (RWD) study. The study is an ongoing single-centre, retrospective, 
interview and database study. The primary aim of the study is to investigate the efficiency and safety 
of Anakinra treatment in colchicine resistant patients in a cohort sample size that has not yet been 
described in literature. 
Each patient was his own control: comparing FMF-related symptoms before and during treatment with 
anakinra.

Results 
In total, 44 patients with colchicine-resistant FMF treated with anakinra were identified. The age of the 
patients at time of the study was 44.02±13.3 years. Thirteen of the 44 patients had proteinuria prior 
to anakinra treatment initiation, seven with amyloidosis. Colchicine treatment were continued during 
anakinra treatment. Forty-one patients were treated with Anakinra 100mg daily, and 3 patients were 
treated with Anakinra 50mg daily.  
The duration of Anakinra treatment in the study was 18 months (interquartile range (IQR) 9-24). 
The median attacks per months before treatment was 4 (IQR 2-5) and after treatment 1 (IQR 0-2) p 
<0.001. The median attack duration before treatment was 3 days (IQR 3-3) and after treatment 1 day 
(IQR 0-2.7), p <0.001. Number of attack sites decreased, also median CRP and ESR values decreased 
during treatment.  
Published retrospective uncontrolled studies 
Study design and number of included subjects in the retrospective uncontrolled studies are listed in 
Table 1. As a rare disease, the FMF patient population is small in an individual country, and it should 
be noted that the patients in the large Turkish study by Akar et al. 2018 may overlap with some 
patients in the smaller Turkish studies. 
The Akar study is summarised below.  
Akar et al. 2018: A nationwide experience with the off-label use of interleukin-1 targeting 
treatment in familial mediterranean fever patients11 
Methods 
This is the largest of the retrospective studies including 172 patients who received at least 6 months of 
treatment with an IL-1 receptor antagonist at 21 Turkish centres. A total of 151 patients (88 %) were 
treated with anakinra and 21 with canakinumab (12 %).  
The reason for starting anti–IL-1 treatment was reported in 171 patients; 117 patients (68 %) started 
due to colchicine-resistant disease, 28 (16 %) due to the development/progression of amyloidosis in 
addition to colchicine-resistant disease, and 20 patients (12 %) started due the presence or 
progression of amyloidosis. Only 5 % had colchicine intolerance.  
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 36/67 
 
 
 
Anakinra was administered as a subcutaneous injection of 100 mg/day in 96.4 % of patients; the 
remaining patients received 50 to 300 mg/day. The mean dosage of colchicine received was 1.7 
mg/day. 
Results 
Among the 145 patients with colchicine-resistant disease and available efficacy information, the attack 
frequency was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) from 16.8 attacks/year (range 1 to 60) to 2.4 
attacks/year (range 0 to 36). Of the 145 patients, 61 (42.1%) were attack free, and 71 (49.7%) were 
reported to have attack frequencies of <6 per year during data collection. In 11 patients (8%), the 
attack rate did not change during anti–IL-1 therapy. In the remaining 2 patients, data for attack 
frequency after treatment were missing. Univariate analyses showed no significant associations 
between nonresponse to anti–IL-1 treatment and any of the demographic, disease-related clinical, and 
laboratory data or the presence of comorbidities other than the baseline attack frequency (r = -0.224, 
P = 0.003). 
Baseline data showed that 47 patients had urinary protein excretion of >500 mg/24 hours before the 
anti–IL-1 treatment. Anti–IL-1 treatment caused a significant reduction of urinary protein levels among 
those patients (from baseline 5458.7 mg/24 h [range 550–19 610] to 3557.3 mg/24 hours [range 0 to 
18 500]) after treatment. At the end of the observation period, 24-h urinary protein excretion had 
decreased in 36 of 47 patients (77 %), and 10 patients (21 %) had no significant proteinuria at all. 
The authors conclude that the results of their large observational study showed that anti–IL-1 
treatment (151 patients treated with anakinra and 21 treated with canakinumab) is an effective 
alternative treatment in patients resistant to colchicine or in patients with progressing amyloidosis, not 
only for controlling the attacks, but also in decreasing the proteinuria in colchicine-resistant patients 
with FMF in routine clinical practice. 
During the mean treatment period of 19.6 months (range 6 to 98), yearly attack frequency, serum 
levels of CRP, ESR, and 24-h urinary protein excretion were significantly reduced (p < 0.001) following 
anti–IL-1 treatment (Table 11).

Comparison and analyses of results across studies 
Study population 
Both paediatric and adult patients of both sexes intolerant to colchicine or with colchicine-resistant FMF 
have been treated with anakinra and evaluated in published studies. The age of the anakinra treated 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 37/67 
 
 
 
 
patients included in the published studies varies between 2 and 57 years. In the paediatric population, 
the majority of patients were older than 6 years old when they started anakinra treatment. 
Amyloidosis was the reason for initiation of anakinra in at least 48 patients in the published studies. 
Disease duration was not consistently reported, but ranged from three to 46 years. In most patients, 
colchicine was continued during anakinra treatment. The total number of unique patients is estimated 
to be at least 261 patients, including the patients in the ongoing study. 
Characteristics of the anakinra-treated patients with FMF presented in the selected published studies 
are described in Table 12.

Comparison of efficacy results across studies 
None of the efficacy measures are analysed across all studies. However, various important aspects of 
the evaluation of the efficacy of anakinra in colchicine-resistant FMF patient are similar in a number of 
publications. Those are presented in the following sections:

Efficacy in paediatric versus adult patients 
Persistence of efficacy and/or tolerance effects 
Responder rate 
Assessment of response to treatment varies among studies, however “complete response” is often 
reported and defined as the patient being attack-free and “partial response” as a reduced frequency 
and severity of attacks. Some studies also include normalisation of inflammatory markers in the 
evaluation of response. 
In the randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study responder rate was not presented, but if 
patients with fewer attacks than 1 per month is regarded as a responder, 6 out of 12 patients (50 %) 
in the anakinra group responded to treatment compared to 0 out of 13 patients in the placebo group. 
In Akar et al. 2018, the largest retrospective real-world study, 91.8 % of the 145 colchicine-resistant 
patients responded to IL-1 blocking treatment (42.1 % complete responders and 49.7 % partial 
responders). 
Across 9 other retrospective real-world studies where response rate was reported, the percentage of 
responders varied between 64 and 100 % in the study populations of colchicine-resistant or intolerant 
patients. Complete response was seen in 42 to 100 % of the patients. 
Effects on inflammatory markers 
Levels of the 3 inflammatory markers CRP, SAA and ESR are commonly evaluated during treatment of 
FMF. The effect on the markers are frequently used as a part of the judgement of complete response, 
partial response and treatment failure. 
The effect of anakinra on CRP, SAA and ESR is presented in Table 13 above. Across studies, anakinra 
given in combination with colchicine significantly reduce inflammation as measured by CRP, SAA 
and/or ESR levels compared to the preceding study period when colchicine was given alone.  
Across studies, inflammatory markers are reduced during treatment.  
Amyloidosis and renal function 
There is limited information about the effect of anakinra on amyloidosis. However, results are reported 
in the randomised study by Ben-Zvi and in three retrospective studies. Individual cases are presented 
from the studies, e.g. a patient with NS (Patient 1) had no attacks during anakinra treatment and 
partial remission of NS was observed after 1 year of anakinra therapy. Among 47 patients with urinary

protein excretion of >500 mg/24 hours at BL, 24-hour urinary protein excretion had decreased in 77 
% patients and 21 % patients had no significant proteinuria after anti-IL-1 treatment 
The authors summarise that anakinra induced remission of attacks, normalised acute phase reactants, 
suppressed amyloidosis-related GIS findings, and was life saving, giving chance for transplantation, 
and increased life quality of the patients.  
Sparse data, mostly from uncontrolled trials indicate that anakinra in colchicine-resistant patients may 
halt ongoing amyloidosis and decrease proteinuria. The expected mechanism of action is the 
suppression of SAA.  
Regular use of colchicine reduces the long-term risk of amyloidosis and is a well-established first line 
treatment recommended by EULAR (level of evidence 1b/grade A recommendation).  
There are insufficient data to support that anakinra monotherapy or anakinra in combination with 
colchicine reduce the risk of amyloidosis or improve renal function. Anakinra should be given in 
combination with colchicine if appropriate. 
Efficacy in colchicine-resistant or intolerant patients 
The medical need for treatment with anakinra in addition to, or as an alternative to colchicine, is in 
almost all publications described in general terms of treatment resistance or intolerance, including 
patients with amyloidosis. It may therefore be assumed that the FMF populations in the evaluated 
published studies include both patients resistant and intolerant to colchicine treatment. In three of the 
publications the two subpopulations are specified, resistance to colchicine appears to be the more 
common reason for the need of anakinra treatment. Efficacy results have in most publications not been 
presented separately for colchicine-resistant and colchicine-intolerant patients, except in one study of 
anakinra monotherapy (Kucuksahin et al. 2017) and the study by Meinzer et al. 2011. The evidence of 
efficacy of anakinra is thus based on populations of mixed resistant patients, and intolerant patients, 
including patients with amyloidosis. 
Therefore, in most of the studies included in the submission (randomized study, published 
retrospective studies and the interim report) a colchicine dose is stated. It appears that the majority of 
patients including in the studies to support the submission are colchicine resistant and has continued 
colchicine treatment concomitantly with anakinra. 
Anakinra as monotherapy and in combination with colchicine 
In 6 publications colchicine was reported to be concomitantly used during anakinra treatment, in 1 
study by Kucuksahin et al. 2017 anakinra monotherapy was given, and in 2 publications anakinra was 
used alone in some patients, and in combination with colchicine in other patients. In 5 publications it 
was not reported whether anakinra was used alone or in combination with colchicine during the study 
periods. 
In the Kucuksashin study, 26 patients with FMF were treated with anakinra monotherapy 100 mg/day, 
and 2 with canakinumab 150 mg/month. The treatment was switched from colchicine to anakinra in 24 
patients for several reasons; 20 patients were resistant to colchicine, 7 were intolerant to colchicine, 
and 2 had prolonged arthritis during colchicine treatment. 
The following results were observed: 
•  16 of the 20 colchicine-resistant patients had no attacks during anakinra monotherapy, and 4 
had decreased frequency and severity of attacks.  
•  6 of the 7 patients intolerant to colchicine were attack-free during anakinra monotherapy, 
while 1 had decreased frequency and severity of attacks.  
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 44/67 
 
 
 
•  2 patients with prolonged arthritis were attack-free during anakinra monotherapy. 
•  Overall, anakinra monotherapy was effective in eliminating or reducing the number of attacks 
in 100 % of patients in this study. 
From the Kucuksahin publication: In this study, anti-IL-1 treatments were used for patients with 
incomplete control of FMF disease activity despite colchicine treatment in 20 patients. Anakinra was 
used in these patients with excellent responses. It has not been stated why patients with incomplete 
response to colchicine were switched from colchicine and not instead offered an IL-1 blocking agent as 
add-on. The publication support that a clinical response is seen in both populations (colchicine resistant 
and colchicine intolerant), but if the response had been even better as add-on treatment remains 
unknown.  
Although these results are not obtained from controlled studies, the above mentioned cases support 
efficacy of anakinra use in monotherapy.  
Colchicine treatment is recommended by EULAR and the level of evidence is high. First-line treatment 
of FMF should be colchicine, and an IL-1 blocker added in case of inadequate response or as 
monotherapy in case of intolerance to colchicine.  
Efficacy in paediatric versus adult patients 
The majority of patients in the patient population were adults. The MAH provided an overview of data 
in paediatric FMF patients from published studies, including at least 52 paediatric patients (Table 14). 
Assessment report

Table 14 Overview of paediatric patients with FMF treated with anakinra 
In the publication by Özcakar et al. 2016 the age of the 10 included patients ranged between 6.5 to 18 
years, with most patients in their early teens. An attack frequency of 12 to 168 per year before 
anakinra treatment decreased to 0 to 3 per year after treatment. An anakinra pretreatment ESR level 
range of 53 to 82 mm/h decreased to a posttreatment range of 15 to 40 mm/h during attack free 
periods, and an anakinra pretreatment CRP level range of 11 to 120 mg/L decreased to a 
posttreatment range of 0.4 to 8 mg/L during attack free periods. 
Basaran et al. 2015 describes 8 patients aged 10 to 19 years, most in their late teens, on a per patient 
basis. All patients were reported to be in remission or complete remission during treatment. 
In the publication by Meinzer at al 2011, 2 of the patients were adults when starting treatment with 
anakinra (51 and 45 years of age), and 4 were paediatrics (12, and 3 patients were 7 years). 
Complete remission was observed in 5 of the 6 anakinra treated patients and rare moderate episodes 
were reported for 1 patient. 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 46/67 
 
 
 
 
Patients included in the submitted studies are mostly above 6 years old, although at least one patient 
aged 2 seems to be included (Eraglu et al. 2015). Doses used ranged from 1mg/kg/day up to 
5mg/kg/day. In the Eroglu et al. study, nine patients responded to treatment at the third month, but 
four of them were switched to canakinumab due to noncompliance, local side effects and active 
arthritis. 
The proposed indication includes children from the age of 8 months, but data in children are very 
limited. According to the literature included to support the present application, symptoms related to 
FMF are often noted only when children become more verbal, usually after 2 years of age. However, 
the onset of disease appears to be before 2 years of age in approximately 24 % of subjects28,29,30. As 
treatment is not initiated until the disease is diagnosed, the actual medical need < 2 years of age could 
be questioned. This is supported by the low number of subjects < 2 years of age with FMF identified 
and included in the submission.  
In previous submissions for other indications, the PK/PD relationship and a suitable posology have 
been established in children from 8 months of age. A weight-based dose is required in subjects < 50 
kg to ensure comparable exposure. It is considered reasonable to extrapolate efficacy of Kineret 
treatment of FMF from children 2-18 years to children < 2 years of age. FMF is of the same family of 
hereditary periodic fever syndromes as CAPS and share the same clinical features. In CAPS, Kineret is 
indicated in children from 8 months of age.  
Persistence of efficacy and/or tolerance effects 
The published studies were not specifically designed to study long-term treatment, however almost all 
real-world studies present efficacy data in patients with FMF during extended anakinra treatment 
periods. None of the studies report a change in response to treatment over time or a need to increase 
dose due to development of tolerance.  
The mean anakinra treatment duration in Akar et al. 2018, the largest real-world study, was 1.6 years 
with a range 0.5 to 8.2 years. The median anakinra treatment periods in the other published studies 
varied between 8 and 36 months. The median duration of anakinra treatment in the interim report was 
18 months.  
The long-term efficacy of anakinra in diminishing symptoms caused by increased secretion of 
interleukin 1- β is supported by results from a prospective, open-label study (study report 03-AR-
0298). Study objectives included determining the effects in controlling the inflammatory 
manifestations in paediatric and adult patients with NOMID. CAPS belong to the autoinflammatory 
syndromes and includes subtypes out of which the most severe phenotype is NOMID. CAPS is a 
disorder caused by genetic mutations leading to an overproduction of IL-1β. This leads to a 
generalised, often chronic systemic inflammation clinically characterized by fever, fatigue, myalgia and 
joint pain, elevations of acute-phase reactants, and inflammatory haematological changes including 
anaemia. The results in the efficacy population (median age 8.6 years) showed clinical response was 
consistent across subgroups, including age and gender, and was sustained up to 5 years (study report 
03-AR-0298).

Anakinra has been used in FMF up to 8 years. None of the presented studies discuss development of 
tolerance or change in response over time. Some publication bias is anticipated, but yet the results are 
acknowledged.  
Long-term anakinra efficacy treatment is supported by data from the CAPS study where patients were 
treated up to 5 years without signs of tolerance. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of anakinra in the treatment of FMF is primarily based on a small randomised placebo-
controlled, double-blind, investigator-initiated study including 25 adults subjects (Ben-Zvi et al. 2017). 
In this study, 12 subjects received anakinra and 13 received placebo. The population included was 
defined as colchicine-resistant, maintaining colchicine treatment at the tolerated dose. Follow up of 
these patients is only 4 months. 
In support of this application, a number of retrospective studies describing the outcome of anakinra 
treatment were also reviewed (Akar et al 2018 and others; see Table 1).  
In addition, the interim study report from a retrospective cohort of patients treated with anakinra for 
FMF refractory to colchicine at Tel Hashomer hospital was submitted. A total of 44 patients were 
treated with anakinra. The duration of anakinra treatment was 18 months.  
The total population consisted of at least 277 anakinra treated patients, including 12 patients in the 
Ben-Zvi study, at least 221 patients in retrospective real-world studies, and 44 patients in the interim 
report from the ongoing retrospective real-world study. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
It is generally accepted that overproduction of IL-1β plays a major role in the development of FMF.  
A positive efficacy response of anakinra is seen both in terms of reducing the number of attacks, as 
well as in the decreased levels of inflammatory markers (SAA, CRP, and ESR) in FMF resistant to 
colchicine and also to some extent in patients intolerant to colchicine, though numbers of each study in 
general are small. The results are consistent across the prospective randomised placebo-controlled 
study and the retrospective real-world studies with apparently higher response rates in the 
retrospective studies. Though only publications from English language journals were included in the 
initial submission, the literature search was deemed accepted by CHMP. 
Although significant treatment effect was obtained for number of attacks, a decrease in abdominal and 
thoracic attacks was not significant. Also, a numerical decrease in CRP and SAA was obtained but not 
statistically significant. No information on long term data was provided for these patients. The 
applicant justified the absence of data by the fact that the study was an investigator-sponsored study 
and not a study sponsored by the MAH. Nonetheless, supportive real-world studies, such as the 
reported by Akar et al.2018, provided some long-term data obtained from the use of anakinra to treat 
FMF which support the long-term use for Kineret.  
Colchicine reduces the risk of amyloidosis and anakinra should be given in combination with colchicine, 
if appropriate. Data are insufficient to support that anakinra reduces the risk of amyloidosis or improve 
renal function. 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 48/67 
 
 
 
The responder rate is overall high and of clinical significance in the studies included in the submission. 
The clinical effect of anakinra is presented in both clinical symptoms of attacks as well as in reduced 
levels of inflammatory markers such as SAA, CRP and ESR. In the randomised study, the response rate 
is 50 %. Overall, data from the published studies, consistently demonstrate that anakinra is efficacious 
in the treatment of FMF, across age groups, though some publication bias is expected with a potential 
overestimation of the treatment effect. 
Most publications do not distinguish between efficacy results in patients with colchicine-resistant FMF 
and efficacy results in colchicine-intolerant patients with FMF. In one study that separately reports 
efficacy of anakinra monotherapy in patients intolerant to colchicine, and in patients resistant to 
colchicine, anakinra decrease attack rate and improve efficacy outcomes in both groups. Colchicine 
treatment is recommended by EULAR and the level of evidence is high. Colchicine has been found to 
reduce the long-term risk of amyloidosis. Therefore, first-line treatment of FMF should be colchicine, 
and an IL-1 blocker added in case of inadequate response or as monotherapy in case of intolerance to 
colchicine. In line with this guidance, the SmPC recommends the use of Kineret in combination with 
colchicine, if appropriate. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The proposed indication includes children from the age of 8 months, although data in children are very 
limited. It is nevertheless considered reasonable to extrapolate the efficacy of Kineret treatment of FMF 
from children 2-18 years to children < 2 years of age. FMF is of the same family of hereditary periodic 
fever syndromes as CAPS and share the same clinical features. The safety profile appears similar 
across indications, also when Kineret is administered with colchicine. However, data to support safety 
in children < 2 years of age are limited and rely on extrapolation from children > 2 years of age. To 
support this, the use of Kineret in children < 2 years in other indications is reassuring. Regarding long-
term treatment, the published studies –uncontrolled studies and case reports - include treatment of 
paediatric subjects for up to 40 months. In the recently submitted PASS study Sobi.ANAKIN-302, the 
most frequent reason (43.1 %) for Kineret discontinuation is disease remission questioning long-term 
efficacy, whereas the long-term safety profile in other indications is reassuring. There are no identified 
safety concerns in FMF compared to other indications and it is considered that efficacy in children < 2 
years of age is comparable to efficacy in children > 2 years of age. Though the medical need in 
children < 2 years of age is limited due to delay in diagnosis, treatment could be appropriate and there 
are data to support a safe and efficacious posology from other indications.  
In conclusion, it is agreed to align the indication in FMF in line with the other following 
autoinflammatory periodic fever syndromes i.e. in children and infants aged 8 months and older with a 
body weight of 10 kg or above. The SmPC states that efficacy data in children < 2 years of age with 
FMF are limited.    
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy data of anakinra in FMF based on bibliographic data has been presented to support the 
submission. Overall, data from the published studies, consistently demonstrate that anakinra is 
efficacious in the treatment of FMF, across age groups, though some publication bias is expected with 
a potential overestimation of the treatment effect. The CHMP agreed that anakinra should be given 
with colchicine if appropriate in children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body weight of 
10 kg or above.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evaluation of anakinra in FMF is based on the following sources: 
•  A published single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled prospective study 
(Ben-Zvi et al. 2017). 
•  A review of other relevant publications including safety data in patients diagnosed with FMF, 
who have received at least 1 dose of anakinra, and have any reported safety data, the largest 
study comprising 155 patients (Akar et al. 2018). 
•  Data from an interim report of an ongoing retrospective study in Israeli patients with FMF, 
treated with anakinra. 
•  Company-sponsored clinical studies comprising 6404 subject-years in 8518 subjects. 
• 
Post-marketing anakinra exposure data of approximately 102 600 patient-years in various 
indications since the first approval of anakinra for RA in 2001. The post marketing safety data 
from the MAH safety database includes 3576 case reports with 7377 medically confirmed post-
marketing AEs, whereof 114 medically confirmed case reports with 223 events that concern 
patients where the indication for anakinra treatment is stated to be FMF.  
There are no company sponsored studies in patients with FMF.  
Safety data have been obtained from 20 publications. From these it is estimated that between 278 and 
438 patients with FMF have been treated with anakinra. This estimation is calculated using a 
conservative approach for the lower limit (where all possible duplicated patients are excluded) and a 
liberal approach for the higher limit (where no patients are excluded). 
Patient exposure 
Since May 1994 and up to May 1, 2018, the estimated exposure to anakinra in completed company 
sponsored clinical studies is 6404 subject-years, in 8518 subjects. In addition, up to May 1, 2018, it 
was estimated that 2 patients have been exposed to anakinra in one ongoing double-blind clinical 
study in Still’s disease (Sobi.ANAKIN-301) and 96 patients are estimated to have been exposed to 
anakinra in one ongoing double-blind clinical study in acute gouty arthritis (Sobi.ANAKIN-401). The 
estimation is based on the randomisation scheme for the respective studies. 
Since the MAH has no access to the data reported in the published studies included in this application, 
it cannot be excluded that some patients are included in two or more studies, resulting in a risk for 
data overlap. Taking the risk for overlap into account, it is estimated that between 278 and 438 
patients with FMF have been treated with anakinra and reported in the >15 published studies included 
in this application. This estimation is calculated using a conservative approach for the lower limit 
(where all possible duplicated patients are excluded) and a liberal approach for the higher limit (where 
no patients are excluded).  
The administered anakinra doses in the published studies and poster abstracts were: 
•  100 mg/ day (with a minimum dose of 50 mg/day s.c. (or 100 mg every other day), and a 
maximum dose of 300 mg/day s.c.) in adult patients (including patients with a history of kidney 
transplant). 
•  1 to 2 mg/kg/day s.c., with a maximum dose of 100 mg/day s.c. in paediatric patients.

In addition to the published studies, an interim report is available from the ongoing retrospective study 
in Israeli patients with FMF, conducted at the Tel Hashomer hospital (Kivity 2018). In this study, 44 
patients with colchicine-resistant FMF were treated with anakinra 100 mg daily for more than 2 
months. 
Adverse events 
Overall the most commonly reported AEs were injection site reactions (ISRs), constituting almost half 
of the reported AEs, followed by infections, both serious and non-serious. 
Less frequently reported AEs (n>5) include known AEs such as allergic reactions, and headache. 
Gastrointestinal AEs have also been reported. 
Table 15 presents the secondary outcomes with regard to safety from the randomised placebo-
controlled, double-blind study (Ben-Zvi, 2017). The safety outcomes were, in general, similar between 
the 2 patient groups, including the number of AEs, the rate of AEs, associations of AEs with specific 
organ systems, and associations of AEs with the study drug and severity. No SAEs were recorded, and 
none of the AEs were graded as severe.

Injection site reactions 
In other indications than FMF ISRs are usually the most frequently reported AEs during anakinra 
treatment. In the prospective controlled study (Ben-Zvi et al. 2017) approximately 45 % of patients 
experienced ISRs and the frequencies of ISRs in the anakinra and placebo groups were comparable. 
In the published studies the frequency of ISRs is lower than what would be expected compared to 
company sponsored studies in RA where approximately 70 % of patients experienced ISRs. In the 
interim report, there were 11 (25 %) patients with ISRs, whereof 5 stopped anakinra treatment. 
ISR are frequent during anakinra treatment, in some cases this may lead to anakinra discontinuation. 
In the SmPC the frequency is “Very common” for injections site reaction. The types and frequencies of 
ISRs are similar in FMF to those seen in RA and SJIA. Discontinuation of Kineret due to ISR have 
occurred in FMF. 
Infections 
In the prospective controlled study there were no serious infections and the frequency of non-serious 
infections was similar in anakinra treated patients and patients receiving placebo. In total 4 out of 12 
patients receiving anakinra experienced non-serious infections, compared to 3 out of 13 patients 
receiving placebo. 
There are several infections reported in the published literature, both serious and non-serious. The 
frequencies vary from 3 in 151 patients (Akar et al. 2018) to 1 in 12 patients. 
In the interim report, there were 3 serious infections requiring hospitalisation, all 3 were considered 
related to anakinra. No non-serious infections were reported. 
Anakinra has been associated with an increased risk for serious infections, and in patients with RA it is 
recommended that anakinra is temporary stopped during infections. However, anakinra has been used 
also during infections without complications. 
The use of anakinra during infections has also been documented in the literature including continued 
use of anakinra during 3 serious infections and continued use of anakinra during an episode of MAS 
with evidence of an human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) infection. Furthermore, anakinra has been 
administered to 1015 patients with sepsis in placebo-controlled company sponsored studies. It was 
concluded that anakinra did not negatively affect the sepsis treatment outcome, and was well 
tolerated, with no difference in frequency of deaths, discontinuations due to AEs or SAEs compared to 
patients receiving placebo. To stop anakinra treatment during infections could trigger disease flares. 
There are no indications, either from the pivotal registration study in severe CAPS, from case reports in 
the literature, or clinical studies in sepsis that treatment of infections becomes more difficult by 
continued anakinra treatment. Also, dose increases of anakinra in connection with infections have been 
well tolerated. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the prospective controlled study there were no serious or severe AEs, however, one patient stopped 
anakinra due to an allergic reaction. 
Also, in the published literature, e.g., allergic reactions and ISRs sometimes cause discontinuation of 
anakinra treatment. 
In the interim study report from Tel Hashomer hospital, 5 patients reported local site reactions severe 
enough to cause treatment cessation. 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 52/67 
 
 
 
No specific narratives of SAEs are described in the publications included in the application.  
In the prospective controlled study there were no deaths. 
In the published retrospective real world studies, there was 1 report of death. This was an 
unidentifiable FMF patient with kidney transplantation on anakinra treatment and concomitant 
immunosuppressives who developed pneumonia and died due to septic shock. No other deaths were 
reported in the published literature included in this application.  
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory values related to the safety profile of anakinra in patients with FMF are available in 2 
published studies: 
In Akar et al. 2018, baseline data showed that 47 patients had a mean urinary protein excretion of 
5458,7 mg/24h (range 550 to19 610), which was significantly reduced to 3557 mg/24h (range 0 to 
18 500) after anakinra treatment. Although non-significant, there was also a reduction in serum levels 
of creatinine, baseline 1.2 mg/dl (0.3 to 10.2) to 1.1 mg/dl (0.4 to 7.7). 
In all remaining published studies, no safety laboratory evaluation was presented.  
No new safety concerns with impact on laboratory values have been identified in FMF.  
Safety in special populations 
Information on safety in special groups and situations is limited in the published studies. 
Paediatric subjects 
Based on the published data, and using the conservative approach, a total of 181 cases reports in 
patients with FMF were identified in the literature. The studies included both paediatric and adult 
patients. There were 24 patients under 18 years of age and only one subject under 2 years of age, 
with most of paediatric patients being older than 6 years old.  
Numbers are small, but there are no indications of differences in the safety profile in paediatric 
subjects compared to adults in FMF. Additionally, the safety profile appears similar across indications, 
also when Kineret is administered with colchicine. However, data to support safety in children < 2 
years of age are limited and would rely on extrapolation from children > 2 years of age. The use of 
Kineret in children < 2 years in other indications including long-term use is reassuring. 
Regarding long-term treatment, the published studies include treatment of paediatric subjects for up to 
40 months. However, these are uncontrolled studies, mainly case reports and the level of evidence is 
limited. In the recently submitted PASS study Sobi.ANAKIN-302, the most frequent reason (43.1 %) 
for Kineret discontinuation was disease remission. The long-term safety profile in other indications is 
on the other hand reassuring.  
In FMF, data on safety, as well as in efficacy, are limited in children < 2 years of age.  
However, there are no identified safety concerns in FMF compared to other indications and it is 
considered likely that efficacy in children < 2 years of age is comparable to efficacy in children > 2 
years of age. Though the medical need in children < 2 years of age is limited due to delay in diagnosis, 
treatment could be appropriate and there are data to support a safe and efficacious posology from 
other indications.  
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 53/67 
 
 
 
Extrapolation of safety of anakinra treatment of FMF from older children to children below the age of 2 
is reasonable, and is further supported by safety data in children 8 months and older with the related 
hereditary periodic fever CAPS/NOMID.  
Therefore, it can be agreed to restrict the indication in FMF in line with the restrictions in the other 
approved autoinflammatory periodic fever syndromes i.e. in children and infants aged 8 months and 
older with a body weight of 10 kg or above. The product information should state that efficacy data in 
children < 2 years of age with FMF are limited. 
Elderly population 
No elderly patients (> 65 years old) with FMF on anakinra treatment were reported in the published 
studies and abstracts included in this application. Safety in elderly patients has previously been 
evaluated, mainly in RA patients. A total of 752 patients ≥ 65 years of age, including 163 subjects ≥ 
75 years of age, have been studied in earlier, company sponsored clinical studies. No differences in the 
safety profiles were observed between elderly and younger subjects, except for ISRs that were less 
frequent among elderly patients. 
Data in the elderly are also limited in CAPS and Still’s disease.  
Hepatic impairment 
No patients with FMF and hepatic impairment were described in the published literature included in this 
application. In total 14 patients with hepatic impairment have been included in a company sponsored 
study 0502, in the original MAA application.  
For patients with hepatic insufficiency, no dosage adjustment is warranted. 
Renal impairment 
In the published literature and abstracts included in this application, between 39 and 70 patients with 
FMF and renal impairment were identified. 
In company sponsored studies of anakinra in other indications there have been no relevant differences 
in the safety profile between subjects with normal renal function and those with different degrees of 
renal impairment. 
From the published literature and abstracts included in this application, there are no indications that 
renal impairment, including renal impairment due to amyloidosis, alters the safety profile of anakinra, 
or that treatment with anakinra is harmful to patients with proteinuria or increased creatinine levels. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interactions have been reported in the published literature included for this application. 
The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-1). In 
conditions with increased IL-1 levels it may be expected that for an IL-1 receptor antagonist, such as 
anakinra, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalised during treatment. This would be 
clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin). Upon start or 
end of anakinra treatment in patients on these types of medicinal products, it may be relevant to 
consider therapeutic monitoring of the effect or drug concentration of these products and the individual 
dose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted. 
In company sponsored clinical studies, no interactions between anakinra and non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and DMARDs have been observed. 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 54/67 
 
 
 
Initiation of anakinra and colchicine treatment in parallel may reduce the clinical effect of colchicine. 
However, in the published literature when using anakinra as add-on therapy, the overall anti-
inflammatory effect of anakinra and colchicine have been shown to increase upon initiation of anakinra 
treatment reflected by a reduced and normalized CRP and ESR levels. 
There are no indications from the literature that combined administration of colchicine and anakinra 
would change the safety profile of anakinra. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the published literature, e.g, allergic reactions and ISRs sometimes cause discontinuation of 
anakinra treatment. 
In the interim report, there were 11 (25 %) patients with ISRs, whereof 5 stopped anakinra treatment. 
According to the SmPC, discontinuation due to AEs in CAPS and SJIA is uncommon. The data in FMF 
indicate a higher rate of discontinuation, but the frequency is unclear due to limited data. 
In 12 FMF patients treated 4 months with Kineret in the published randomised controlled study no 
allergic event was reported as serious and no event required discontinuation of Kineret. 
Post marketing experience 
The estimated total commercial patient exposure to anakinra, including use in Named Patient Programs 
and Compassionate Use Programs, since the initiation of anakinra clinical studies in May 1994 up to 
May 1, 2018, is 102,625 patient-years. The presented patient exposure has been estimated based on 
the amount of product distributed. 
Despite limited licensed indications, anti-IL1 agents are often used in real-life practice for an increasing 
number of diseases. 
The case reports in the MAH Safety Database represent spontaneous ICSRs reports received by the 
current MAH Sobi and the previous MAH Amgen, and includes reports from healthcare professionals, 
consumers, scientific literature, worldwide regulatory authorities, and solicited ICSRs from non-
interventional studies. Case reports from company sponsored clinical studies have been filtered and 
therefore do not appear among the post marketing AEs. 
Figure 5 shows the relative distribution of all AEs by SOC in patients with FMF compared to all other 
indications for anakinra treatment.  
In both groups the SOC “General disorders and administration site conditions” is the SOC with most 
AEs; this SOC contains all PTs related to ISRs, the most common anakinra ADRs. Various ISRs are 
more common in patients with FMF making the relative number of events in the “General disorders and 
administration site conditions” SOC higher. Events of infection are relatively less common in patients 
with FMF. The reasons for these differences are unknown, however, the number of patients with FMF is 
relatively low and data should therefore be interpreted with caution. With these exceptions the 
distribution of AEs is similar in the 2 groups.

Figure 5 Distribution of AEs by SOC, patients with FMF compared to patients treated with 
anakinra for other indications (SOC Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions, PTs

The overall distribution of AEs from spontaneous reports appears similar in FMF compared to other 
indications, but various ISRs appear more common in patients with FMF – this is in contrast to the 
published studies, where ISRs were less frequently reported, likely due to underreporting. A higher 
incidence of ISRs could explain the higher incidence of drug discontinuation. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data from at least 278 anakinra-treated patients with FMF in studies including a published 
randomised, placebo-controlled study, published retrospective real-world studies, and an interim 
report of an ongoing study in 44 Israeli patients on anakinra have been presented. Between 39 and 70 
patients with renal impairment (whereof between 22 and 39 patients with a kidney transplantation 
before starting anakinra treatment) were included in the studied population.  
No new clinically relevant AEs were seen in patients with FMF treated with anakinra and the safety 
profile of anakinra in patients with FMF was generally similar to that in other indications. In addition, in 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 56/67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with FMF the types and frequencies of ISRs are similar to those seen in RA and SJIA. Also, 
compared to CAPS and Still’s disease, more patients appear to discontinue treatment, nevertheless this 
may be biased due to limited in FMF. The product information is updated to reflect that 
discontinuations due to ISRs have occurred also in patients with FMF.  
The frequency of certain AEs reported in patients with FMF appears to be lower than that seen in other 
approved indications. This is likely due to underreporting in the published studies, which mainly focus 
on efficacy. In addition, there are no indications of a higher frequency of serious infections or other 
serious AEs in FMF than in other indications. 
From the published literature and abstracts included in this application, there are no indications that 
renal impairment, including renal impairment due to amyloidosis, alters the safety profile of anakinra, 
or that treatment with anakinra is harmful to patients with proteinuria or increased creatinine levels. 
In 12 FMF patients treated 4 months with Kineret in the published randomised controlled study no 
allergic event was reported as serious and no event required discontinuation of Kineret. The SmPC is 
updated to reflect this statement.  
There were no data in elderly patients with FMF. 
Based on the available data, the safety profile of Kineret in the FMF indication is acceptable.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Although the numbers are small, there are no indication of differences in the safety profile in paediatric 
subjects compared to adults in FMF. Furthermore, the safety profile appears similar across indications, 
also when Kineret is administered with colchicine.  
However, data to support safety in children < 2 years of age are limited and would rely on 
extrapolation from children > 2 years of age. The use of Kineret in children < 2 years in other 
indications including long-term use is reassuring. In addition, there are no identified safety concerns in 
FMF compared to other indications and it is considered likely that efficacy in children < 2 years of age 
is comparable to efficacy in children > 2 years of age. Though the medical need in children < 2 years 
of age is limited due to delay in diagnosis, treatment could be appropriate and there are data to 
support a safe and efficacious posology from other indications.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the available data, the overall safety profile of anakinra in FMF appear to be comparable to 
the safety profile in other indications. Anakinra exposure in FMF from published studies and the 
included interim report is supported by safety data of anakinra as treatment in several other 
indications.  
No new safety issues have been identified, the CHMP agreed that the and safety in children from 8 
months of age can be extrapolated from the data obtained for children with < 2 years in the context of 
the other approved indications, namely CAPS/NOMID.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

Routine risk communication: 
Information in SmPC section 4.8 and the 
following information in section 4.4: Kineret 
treatment should not be initiated in patients 
with active infections. Kineret treatment 
should be discontinued in RA patients if a 
serious infection develops. In Kineret treated 
CAPS or FMF patients, there is a risk for 
disease flares when discontinuing Kineret 
treatment. With careful monitoring, Kineret 
treatment can be continued also during a 
serious infection. Available data is limited 
regarding whether Kineret can be continued 
during serious infections in patients with 
Still’s disease. If Kineret treatment is 
continued during serious infections to reduce 
the risk for a disease flare, careful monitoring 
is required.  
Physicians should exercise caution when 
administering Kineret to patients with a 
history of recurring infections or with 
underlying conditions which may predispose 
them to infections. 
Patients should be screened for latent 
tuberculosis prior to initiating Kineret. The 
available medical guidelines should be taken 
into account. Screening for viral hepatitis 
should also be performed in accordance with 
published guidelines before starting therapy 
with Kineret.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, in section 4.1 of the SmPC the wording of the indication CAPS has been modified to 
regroup the CAPS and FMF indications under the term “Periodic fever syndromes” for the treatments of 
adults, adolescents, children and infants aged 8 months and older with a body weight of 10 kg or 
above.  
Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
A user consultation has not been performed for this Type-II variation application as the package leaflet 
included in this submission is identical to the previously readability tested package leaflet for Kineret 
(indicated for RA, CAPS and Still´s disease) with the only difference between the two leaflets being the 
new indication. As this information is the only differing aspect between the PILs, the result of the 
Readability Test for the Kineret (indicated for RA, CAPS and Still´s disease) also applies to Kineret 
(indicated for RA, CAPS, Still’s disease and FMF). 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
FMF is a rare, but the most common, hereditary periodic fever syndrome and is driven by 
inflammasome activation, which leads to the overproduction of IL-1β. FMF is a rare disorder, but the 
most common of the autoinflammatory syndrome (AIS), traditionally more common in the 
Mediterranean region, although an increase in incidence has been seen in other European countries 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 61/67 
 
 
 
 
with high Turkish or Algerian immigration, such as Germany and France. An increase in incidence has 
been seen in Italy as well.  
FMF is typically presented with recurrent febrile attacks, accompanied by signs of peritonitis, pleuritis 
or acute synovitis, lasting 1 to 3 days, and resolving spontaneously. The most severe and potentially 
life-threatening complication of FMF is secondary amyloid A amyloidosis, characterized by deposition of 
misfolded insoluble proteins in various organs and tissues. Amyloidosis results from excessive 
production of SAA, an acute phase protein released from hepatocytes via stimulation of 
proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α). Disease onset are seen frequently below the age of 
2.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Colchicine treatment should according to EULAR recommendations be initiated as soon as the clinical 
diagnosis has been established. Continuous therapy with colchicine prevents FMF attacks in 60 to 65 % 
of patients and induces partial remission in a further 30 to 35 %, and regular use of colchicine reduces 
the long-term risk of amyloidosis. However, as documented in a large number of studies, colchicine 
may be unsuitable or insufficient in a subset of patients with FMF who are non-respondent, partially 
respondent, or intolerant to colchicine. There is an unmet need if colchicine is inadequate– either 
because of insufficient response to treatment, or due to safety concerns or intolerance, such as renal 
impairment, hepatic impairment, gastrointestinal AEs, or potential drug-drug interactions.  
Symptoms related to FMF are often noted only when children become more verbal, usually after 2 
years of age. However, the onset of disease appears to be before 2 years of age in approximately 24 
% of subjects. As treatment is not initiated until the disease is diagnosed, the actual medical need < 2 
years of age could be questioned. This is supported by the low number of subjects < 2 years of age 
with FMF identified and included in the studies. 
The IL-1 inhibitor canakinumab is also approved the treatment of FMF in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 2 years and older. It should be given in combination with colchicine, if appropriate. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is primarily based on: 
•  Bibliographical data from 1 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of anakinra in 
patients with FMF (Ben-Zvi et al. 2017). 
The following studies and analysis have been submitted as supportive data: 
•  Multiple real-world clinical studies of anakinra in patients with FMF (List of studies can be 
found in Table 1) 
•  Recent data from an ongoing real-world study conducted at the Tel Hashomer hospital in 
Israel (interim report). 
• 
Efficacy and safety data in the paediatric population from anakinra treatment of a related 
hereditary periodic fever syndrome sharing the same pathophysiological features as FMF: 
CAPS (study report 03-AR-0298). 
•  MAH’s data from company-sponsored studies of anakinra in other indications. 
•  Data from the MAH’s post-marketing safety database in various indications, including FMF.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The safety and efficacy of Kineret in the treatment of patients with colchicine resistant FMF has been 
demonstrated in a randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled published study with a treatment 
period of 4 months. The mean number of attacks per patient per month was significantly lower in 
those receiving Kineret (1.7) compared to placebo (3.5). The number of patients with <1 attack per 
month was significantly higher in the Kineret group; 6 patients, compared to none in the placebo 
group. 
Additional published data in patients with FMF, intolerant to colchicine or with colchicine resistant FMF, 
demonstrate that the clinical effect of Kineret is evident in both clinical symptoms of attacks as well as 
in reduced levels of inflammatory markers, such as CRP and SAA. In the published studies the safety 
profile of anakinra in patients with FMF was generally similar to that in other indications. 
Most publications do not distinguish between efficacy results in patients with colchicine-resistant FMF 
and efficacy results in colchicine-intolerant patients with FMF. In one study that separately reports 
efficacy of anakinra monotherapy in patients intolerant to colchicine, and in patients resistant to 
colchicine, anakinra decrease attack rate and improve efficacy outcomes in both groups. Colchicine 
treatment is recommended by EULAR and the level of evidence is high. Colchicine has been found to 
reduce the long-term risk of amyloidosis. Therefore, Kineret should be given in combination with 
colchicine, if appropriate.  
Data from the published studies also demonstrate that anakinra is efficacious and safe in the treatment 
of FMF for the paediatric population. Extrapolation of efficacy and safety from children 2-18 years to 
children below 2 years of age is considered acceptable by CHMP since FMF is of the same family of 
hereditary periodic fever syndromes as CAPS which is indicated from 8 months of age and share the 
same clinical features.  
Overall, the benefits of anakinra have been reported consistently across age groups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Efficacy of anakinra in FMF is mainly based on retrospective studies published in English and 
publications bias is expected with a potential overestimation of the treatment effect. A small 
randomised placebo-controlled, double blinded trial (Ben-Zi et al) with 25 FMF patients is the only 
controlled data to support efficacy. A large retrospective analysis of 172 FMF patients (Akar et al) 
further support the application and the additional small retrospective uncontrolled studies are not 
considered of high relevance. In addition, the recent data from the ongoing real-world study conducted 
at the Tel Hashomer hospital in Israel has been submitted as supportive, although final results are still 
pending.  
It has been shown that anakinra is effective in normalising elevated SAA levels and reverse proteinuria 
and this may contribute to preventing amyloidosis and preserving renal function. However, clinical data 
are yet insufficient to support this assumption. 
The majority of FMF patients in the studies were also treated with colchicine. Data to support anakinra 
as monotherapy in FMF are limited. Data are insufficient to support that anakinra reduces the risk of 
amyloidosis or improve renal function. 
Efficacy data in children, especially the very young (under 2 years of age), are limited. This can be 
explained by the fact that symptoms related to FMF are often noted only when children become more 
verbal, usually after 2 years of age. The onset of disease appears to be before 2 years of age in 
approximately 24 % of subjects. Although the medical need in children under 2 years of age is limited 
Assessment report 
EMA/236936/2020  
Page 63/67 
 
 
 
due to delay in diagnosis, treatment could be appropriate and there are data to support a safe and 
efficacious posology from other indications.  
In addition, while extrapolation of efficacy and safety to children below the age of 2 is acceptable, no 
PK data in children below 8 months are available to support dosing. The indication is therefore limited 
to children above 8 months of age and above 10 kg in line with the other Kineret indications. In 
children with inadequate response the dose can be escalated up to 4 mg/kg/day. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events data in patients with FMF are based on post-marketing AE reports and published 
studies. The safety profile of anakinra is also well-established in other indications, including CAPS a 
periodic fever condition related to FMF. The most common known AEs with anakinra treatment are 
non-serious and mostly mild or moderate ISRs that usually transiently occur early during treatment 
across indications. This is true also for patients with FMF. In addition, there are no indications of a 
higher frequency of serious infections or other serious AEs in FMF than in other indications. No new 
ADRs have been identified. Discontinuations due to ISRs have occurred also in patients with FMF. 
In 12 FMF patients treated 4 months with Kineret in the published randomised controlled study no 
allergic event was reported as serious and no event required discontinuation of Kineret. 
Based on available data, the safety profile of anakinra is considered similar between paediatric and 
adult’s patients in FMF. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data in FMF in the retrospective published studies, where the main focus was often only 
efficacy, are limited. However, given the well-known safety profile of anakinra – also in another fever 
indication (CAPS) - the safety data are considered sufficient for making an adequate evaluation of the 
safety of anakinra in adult FMF. 
ISR are frequent during anakinra treatment, in some cases this may lead to anakinra discontinuation. 
In order to minimise this risk, physicians and patients (or caregivers) should receive educational 
material or information pack which give instructions on how to use the syringe and manage injection 
site reactions. 
Long term safety data in FMF are also limited but some supportive real-world studies provided some 
long-term data and also supported by the CAPS study where patient where treated up to 5 years. 
Safety data in children are also limited, but there are no indications of differences in the safety profile 
in paediatrics subjects compared to adults in FMF. No children below the age of 2 have been included 
in the clinical studies for the other indications (CAPS), but limited evidence from the literature and the 
few cases from the post-marketing safety database indicate similar safety in children younger than 2 
years compared to older children and adults.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
FMF is a serious condition with risk of amyloidosis with general devastating organ involvement 
including renal impairment. Amyloidosis is the primary cause of premature death in FMF patients. It is 
generally accepted that overproduction of IL-1β plays a major role in the development of FMF and IL-1 
Assessment report

Page 65/67 
 
 
 
 
blocking treatment is recommended by EULAR in in the rare patients who fail to respond to colchicine 
or who cannot tolerate it.  
Canakinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-1β, is approved for periodic fever syndromes 
including FMF. Anakinra is a recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist, 
which prevents the activity of the cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β. 
The efficacy of anakinra in terms of reducing the number of attacks, as well as in the decreased level 
of inflammatory markers (SAA, CRP and ESR) has been shown in patients with colchicine-resistant FMF 
and in colchicine-intolerant patients, patient populations with limited therapeutic alternatives in both 
the controlled study and in the retrospective published studies included to support the application. 
Moreover, anakinra treatment may contribute to the prevention of amyloidosis by lowering of SAA 
levels and reversal of proteinuria. However, clinical data are yet insufficient to support this 
assumption. 
The proposed therapeutic indication includes children older than 8 months, but data for children 
younger than 6 years are scarce. Dosage used in children ranges from the proposed doses up to 
5mg/kg. Long term data are not included.  
Although the medical need in children under 2 years of age is questioned due to delay in diagnosis, 
treatment could be appropriate and there are data to support a safe and efficacious posology from 
other indications. Efficacy extrapolation for children 2-18 years to children under 2 years of age is 
acceptable by CHMP. In children with inadequate response the dose can be escalated up to 
4 mg/kg/day. 
The safety profile of anakinra is well-known and no new safety concerns have been identified in the 
FMF indication. The most common AEs were non-serious and mostly mild or moderate ISRs, followed 
by infections, that usually transiently occur early during treatment across indications. Although safety 
data in children are limited there are no indications of differences in the safety profile in paediatrics 
subjects compared to adults in FMF. 
The benefit-risk of anakinra treatment in children with FMF is considered positive in children 8 months 
and older with a body weight of 10 kg or above in line with the other autoinflammatory periodic fever 
syndromes as the posology is established, and both efficacy and safety are expected to be comparable 
in children under 2 years and children above 2 years of age. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the efficacy of anakinra demonstrated in the randomised clinical study in patients colchicine-
resistant FMF, supportive data from retrospective uncontrolled studies and the know safety profile in 
other autoinflammatory period fever syndromes, the benefit-risk balance of Kineret is considered 
positive in the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Kineret is positive.

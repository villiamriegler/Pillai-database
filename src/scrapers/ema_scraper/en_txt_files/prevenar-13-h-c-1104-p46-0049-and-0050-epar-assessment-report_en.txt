6096A1-3024:  Evaluating  the  Safety,  Tolerability,  and  Immunogenicity  of  a  13-valent 
Pneumococcal  Conjugate  Vaccine  Given  With  DTaP  Compared  to  Open-  Label  DTaP  in 
Healthy Japanese Infants 
  Description 
Study  6096A1-3024-JA  (B1851056)  was  conducted  in  Japan  and  was  a  Phase  3,  parallel-group, 
randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  in  infants  and  toddlers  to  evaluate  the 
immunogenicity,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  subcutaneous  13vPnC  given  with  diphtheria,  tetanus, 
acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) compared to subcutaneous 7vPnC given with DTaP or DTaP alone in 
healthy  infants.  Subjects  were  randomized  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  receive 13vPnC  and  concomitant  DTaP 
(Group 1), 7vPnC and concomitant DTaP (Group 2), or DTaP (Group 3). 
  Methods 
  Objective(s) 
Primary Immunologic Objectives: 
 
 
To demonstrate that the immune responses to the 13 pneumococcal conjugates (1, 3, 
4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) induced by 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate  vaccine  (13vPnC)  are  noninferior  to  the  immune  responses  induced  by  7-
valent  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (7vPnC)  when  measured  1  month  after  the 
infant series. 
To  assess  whether  the immune  responses  as  measured  by  serum  antibody  responses 
to  diphtheria  toxoid,  tetanus  toxoid,  pertussis  toxoid  (PT),  and 
filamentous 
hemagglutinin (FHA) induced by diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) 
given with 13vPnC were comparable to the immune responses induced by DTaP given 
alone when measured 1 month after the infant series.

 
To evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC and 7vPnC given with 
DTaP as measured by  the  incidence  rates of  local  reactions, systemic events, and 
adverse events (AEs). 
Secondary: 
 
 
 
To demonstrate that the immune responses to the 13 pneumococcal conjugates (1, 
3,  4,  5,  6A,  6B,  7F,  9V,  14,  18C,  19A,  19F,  and  23F)  induced  by  13vPnC  are 
noninferior  to  the  immune  responses  induced  by  7vPnC  when  measured  1  month 
after the toddler dose. 
To  describe  antibody  responses  to  the  13  pneumococcal  conjugates  after  the 
toddler dose compared to antibody responses before the toddler dose and after the 
infant series within each of Groups 1 and 2. 
To  assess  whether  the  immune  responses  as  measured  by  serum  antibody 
responses to diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, PT, and FHA induced by DTaP given 
with  13vPnC  were  comparable  to  the  immune  responses  induced  by  DTaP  given 
alone when measured 1 month after the toddler dose. 
Exploratory: 
 
In subjects that received ActHIB: To describe the immune responses as measured 
by  serum  antibody  responses  to  Haemophilus  influenza  type  b  (Hib)  induced  by 
ActHIB given concomitantly with 13vPnC when measured 1 month after the infant 
series and after the toddler dose. 
  Study design 
This  was  a  Phase  3,  parallel-group,  randomized,  active-controlled,  double-blind,  multicenter  trial  to 
evaluate  the  immunogenicity,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  13vPnC  given  with  DTaP  compared  to 7vPnC 
given with DTaP or DTaP alone in healthy infants. 
Subjects  were  randomized  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  to  receive  13vPnC  and  concomitant  DTaP,  7vPnC  and 
concomitant  DTaP,  or  DTaP.  Administration  of  the  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccines  (13vPnC  and 
7vPnC)  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  and  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group  was  blinded  due  to  the  identical 
appearance of the vaccines. DTaP was administered open-label. 
In this study, the subjects in the 13vPnC+DTaP, 7vPnC+DTaP and the DTaP groups received 3 doses of 
their  assigned  study  vaccine  during  the  infant  series  and  another  toddler  dose.  In  the  infant  series, 
dose  1  of  the  study  vaccines  was  given  at  3  to  6  months  of  age,  dose  2  of  the  study  vaccines  was 
given 4 to 8 weeks after dose 1, and dose 3 of the study vaccines was given 4 to 8 weeks after dose 2. 
The toddler dose of the study vaccines was given at 12 to 15 months of age. In addition, subjects in 
the DTaP group received 3 catch-up doses of Prevenar (commercial product of 7vPnC for Japan,  with 
catch-up dose 1 given approximately 1 month after dose 3 of the infant series, catch-up dose 2 given 
approximately 1 month after catch-up dose 1, and catch-up dose 3 given approximately 1 month after 
the toddler dose. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Main  Criteria  for  Inclusion:  Subjects  eligible  to  participate  in  the  study  were  healthy  (as 
determined by medical history, physical examination, and judgment of the investigator) infants 
between  ≥3  months  and  ≤6  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  enrollment.  Parent/legal  guardian 
had  to  be  able  to  complete  all  relevant  study  procedures  during  study  participation,  and  was 
expected to be available for the duration of the trial. 
Subjects were ineligible to participate in the study if they had previously been vaccinated with 
any licensed or investigational pneumococcal, diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis vaccine,  had  a 
previous  anaphylactic  reaction  to  any  vaccine  or  vaccine-related  component,  contraindication 
to vaccination with a pneumococcal conjugate, diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis vaccine, had a 
bleeding diathesis, had a known or suspected immune deficiency or suppression, had a history 
of culture-proven invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae, or had any of the other exclusion 
criteria specified in the protocol. 
Sample  size  was  powered  to  confirm  the  noninferiority  of  immune  responses  to  the  13 
pneumococcal  conjugates  induced  by  13vPnC  relative  to  the  immune  responses  induced  by 
7vPnC  and  was  estimated  based  upon  the  proportions  of  responders  for  the  pneumococcal 
serotypes  for  both  the  7  common  serotypes  and  the  6  additional  serotypes  and  the  IgG 
geometric  mean  concentration  (GMC)  ratio  for  the  7  common  serotypes,  which  are  referred 
Prevenar 13 P46 049 and 050

from  the  data  for  Wyeth  studies  6096A1-3003-JA  (Japan  study),  6096A1-010-KP  (Korea 
study), and 6096A1-3004-TW (Taiwan study). 
A  sample  size  of  160  evaluable  subjects  per  group  was  estimated  to  provide  at  least  81% 
power  to  declare  noninferiority  for  all  primary  endpoints  (power  =  0.932  *  0.923  *  0.94  = 
0.809%).  Assuming  a  dropout  rate  of  about  10%,  178  subjects  per  group  (534  total)  were 
planned to be enrolled to ensure that 160 subjects per group were evaluable. 
Sample  size  estimation  was  also  considered  to  provide  appropriate  precision  from  the  clinical 
viewpoint  for  the  proportion  of  responders  for  each  antigen  induced  by  DTaP.  Vaccination  of 
160 subjects in each group was to provide 7.0%, 6.5%, 5.7%, and 4.6% precision (the lower 
bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval [CI] is 73.0%, 78.5%, 84.3%, and 90.4%) from 
estimates of the proportion of responders of 80%, 85%, 90%, and 95%, respectively. 
 
Treatments 
Subjects  received  1  dose  of  either  13vPnC+DTaP,  7vPnC+DTaP,  or  DTaP  depending  on 
treatment assignment at each of the 4 vaccination visits. Subjects in the DTaP group received 
1 dose of Prevenar at each of the 3 catch-up dose vaccination visits. 
Investigational products  were  administered  subcutaneously  by  injecting  0.5  mL  at  each  dose. 
The  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  (13vPnC,  7vPnC,  or  Prevenar)  was  administered  in  the 
left arm and DTaP was administered in the right arm. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity  Evaluations:  Blood  samples  (approximately  5  mL)  were  collected  before 
the  first  vaccination  of  investigational  product,  at  1  month  (28  to  42  days)  after  the  infant 
series, before the toddler dose, and 1 month (28 to 42 days) after the toddler dose. 
Pneumococcal antibody response was assessed in the 13vPnC+DTaP and 7vPnC+DTaP groups. 
Using  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA),  serum  concentrations  of  anticapsular 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) that were elicited by each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 
5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) and 7 pneumococcal serotypes (4, 6B, 7F, 9V, 
14, 18C, 19F,  and 23F) were determined in  subjects for  each blood sample. Assays of serum 
opsonophagocytic  activity  (OPA)  that  was  elicited  by  the  13  pneumococcal  serotypes  were 
performed  on  blood  samples  obtained  1  month  after  the  infant  series  and  1  month  after  the 
toddler  dose  for  subjects  with  an  adequate  amount  of  serum.  This  study  used  the  improved 
microcolony  assay  for  determination  of  OPA.  The  new  microcolony  OPA  (mcOPA)  assay 
specified cutoff criteria for OPA assay data as the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for each 
serotype.  In  previous  infant  studies  using  the  dribble  OPA  (dOPA)  assay,  an  OPA  serum 
response was determined using an OPA titer cut-off of 1:8 for all serotype-specific OPA assays. 
However, in both assay methods, an OPA titer is defined as the interpolated reciprocal serum 
dilution that results in complement mediated killing of 50% of the bacteria in each OPA assay. 
Antibody  responses  to  the  diphtheria  toxoid,  tetanus  toxoid,  and  pertussis  antigens  (PT  and 
FHA) were measured in each serum sample for all 3 vaccine groups. 
Safety Evaluations: 
Local  reactions  (tenderness,  redness,  and  swelling)  at  the  site  of  injection  of  pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (13vPnC or 7vPnC) in the 13vPnC+DTaP and 7vPnC+DTaP groups and at the 
site  of  injection  of  DTaP  in  the  DTaP  group  were  monitored  daily  for  7  days  after  each 
vaccination  in  electronic  diary  (e-diary).  Tenderness  was  recorded  as  no  discernible 
tenderness, tenderness present, or tenderness interfered with limb movement. For redness and 
swelling, the parent/legal guardian measured the actual size of the reaction with a caliper. For 
analysis  purposes,  measurements  recorded  for  redness  and  swelling  were  categorized  as 
absent (no redness or swelling present), mild (1 to 4 caliper units), moderate (5 to 14 caliper 
units), or severe (>14 caliper units). 
Systemic events (fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, decreased sleep, hives 
[urticaria],  and  the  use  of  antipyretic  medications  to  prevent  or  treat  symptoms)  were 
monitored  daily  for  7  days  after  each  vaccination  of  investigational  product  (other  than 
Prevenar for catch-up doses in the DTaP group) using an e-diary. Temperature was measured 
at bedtime daily and at any time during the 7 days that fever was suspected. Severity of fever 
),  moderate  >39.0°C  to 
was  categorized  as  absent  (<37.5°C),  mild  (
) for analysis. Other systemic events were reported as present 
or absent.

Adverse  events:  AEs  were  categorized  according  to  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). The relation between an AE and study vaccine was categorized as related 
or not related. AE severity was categorized as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. 
AEs  were  collected  from  the  signing  of  the  informed  consent  form  (ICF)  to  at  least  28  days 
after  the  administration  of  dose  3  of  the  infant  series  in  all  3  vaccine  groups  and  at  least  28 
days  after  the  administration  of  catch-up  dose  2  of  7vPnC  in  the  DTaP  group.  AEs  were  also 
collected at the time of the toddler dose through at least 28 days after the toddler dose visit in 
all  3  vaccine  groups  and  to  at  least  28  days  after  the  administration  of  catch-up  dose  3 
of7vPnC in the DTaP group. 
  Statistical Methods 
Immunogenicity  Analysis  Comparisons:  To  assess  the  pneumococcal  immune  responses 
induced by 13vPnC as measured by IgG concentrations, noninferiority comparisons were made 
directly  between  the  13vPnC+DTaP  and  7vPnC+DTaP  groups  for  the  7  serotypes  common  to 
13vPnC and 7vPnC. For the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC, noninferiority comparisons were 
made  between  individual  serotypes  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  and  the  lowest  response 
observed  among  the  7  common  serotypes  in  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group.  For  the  6  additional 
serotypes  in  13vPnC,  a  direct  comparison  was  also  done  to  assess  superiority.  To  assess  the 
pneumococcal  immune  responses  induced  by  13vPnC  as  measured  by  OPA  titers,  the 
comparison  was  only  constructed  directly  comparing  13vPnC+DTaP  group  to  7vPnC+DTaP 
group for all 13 serotypes.  
A  primary  immunological  comparison  for  the  pneumococcal  conjugate  vaccine  was  the 
proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  a  serotype-specific  IgG  concentration  ≥0.35  μg/mL  1 
month  after  the  infant  series  in  subjects  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  relative  to  the  immune 
responses  in  subjects  in  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group  for  the  7  common  serotypes  and  the  6 
additional  serotypes.  Another  primary  immunological  comparison  for  the  pneumococcal 
conjugate  vaccine  was  the  IgG  geometric  mean  concentration  (GMC)  ratio  1  month  after  the 
infant  series  in  subjects  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  relative  to  the  immune  responses  in 
subjects in the 7vPnC+DTaP group for the 7 common serotypes. 
A secondary immunological comparison was the IgG GMC ratio 1 month after the infant series 
in  subjects  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  relative  to  the  immune  responses  in  subjects  in  the 
7vPnC+DTaP group for the  6 additional  serotypes. Also, the comparisons of the proportion of 
subjects who achieved a serotype-specific IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL and IgG GMC ratio 1 
month  after  the  toddler  dose  in  subjects  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  relative  to  the  immune 
responses in subjects in the 7vPnC+DTaP group were secondary immunological comparisons. 
Other comparisons for 13vPnC+DTaP group relative to the immune responses in subjects in the 
7vPnC+DTaP group were of the proportion of subjects with serotype-specific IgG concentration 
≥0.15 μg/mL, the proportion of OPA titers ≥ the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), and the 
geometric mean titers (GMTs) of OPA for each of the 13 serotypes. 
The  immunological  comparison  of  interest  for  diphtheria  toxoid,  tetanus  toxoid,  and  pertussis 
antigens (PT and FHA) was the responses in subjects in the 13vPnC+DTaP group relative to the 
responses  in  subjects  in  the  DTaP  group  for  each  antigen  following  the  infant  series.  The 
primary  endpoints  for  diphtheria  toxoid,  tetanus  toxoid,  PT  and  FHA  were  the  proportions  of 
subjects  achieving  a  predetermined  antibody  level  measured  1  month  after  the  infant  series. 
Proportions were also calculated following the toddler dose. Antigen-specific GMCs/ GMTs after 
the infant series and after the toddler dose were also assessed. 
Immunogenicity Analysis Methods:  Within  each 13vPnC+DTaP group  and  7vPnC+DTaP group, 
the  GMCs  of  pneumococcal  IgG  and  the  GMTs  of  OPA  were  calculated.  The  IgG  antibody 
concentrations and OPA antibody titers were logarithmically transformed for analysis. Two (2)-
sided  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  were  constructed  by  back  transformation  of  the  CIs  for 
the  mean  of  the  logarithmically  transformed  assay  results,  computed  using  the  Student  t 
distribution.  IgG  GMC  ratios  (13vPnC+DTaP  /  7vPnC+DTaP)  and  their  corresponding  2-sided 
95%  CIs  will  be  calculated.  The  geometric  mean  fold  rises  (GMFRs)  in  IgG  antibody 
concentration (measured from before the toddler dose to after the toddler dose and measured 
Prevenar 13 P46 049 and 050

after  the  infant  series  to  after  the  toddler  dose)  and  in  OPA  titres  (measured  from  after  the 
infant  series  to  after  the  toddler  dose)  were  summarized  by  geometric  means  and  95%  CIs. 
For each serotype after infant series and after toddler dose, noninferiority was declared if the 
lower CI for the IgG GMC ratio was >0.5. Superiority was declared if the lower CI for the IgG 
GMC ratio was >1.0. Although not prespecified by the SAP or the protocol, the same criterion 
for superiority as was used in previous infant studies was used in this study. 
Within each 13vPnC+DTaP group and 7vPnC+DTaP group, the proportion of subjects achieving 
an IgG concentration ≥0.35 μg/mL for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes was calculated 
for each serotypes and  their exact,  2-sided 95% CIs for  the  proportions were calculated. The 
CI  for  the  single  proportions  was  computed  using  the  F  distribution.  The  differences  in 
proportions  (13vPnC+DTaP  –  7vPnC+DTaP)  and  their  corresponding  2-sided  95%  CIs  were 
calculated. For each serotype, noninferiority was declared if the lower CI for the difference was 
>-0.10.  Superiority  was  declared  if  the  lower  CI  for  the  difference  was  >0.  Although  not 
prespecified  by  the  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  or  the  protocol,  the  same  criterion  for 
superiority as was used in previous infant studies was used in this study. 
Within each 13vPnC+DTaP group and 7vPnC+DTaP group, the LLOQ for OPA titers was used to 
compute  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  OPA  titers 
  LLOQ  for  each  serotype,  along  with 
exact, 2-sided 95% CI. 
Within each group and for each DTaP antigen separately, the proportion of subjects achieving 
at  least  a  prespecified  antibody  concentration  was  computed  for  each  blood  sample.  The 
prespecified  antibody  levels  for  each  antigen  are  diphtheria  0.1  international  unit  (IU)/mL; 
tetanus,  0.01  IU/mL;  PT,  5  ELISA  units  (EU)/mL;  and  FHA,  5  EU/mL.  The  differences  in 
proportions (13vPnC+DTaP – DTaP) and their corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated 
after  the  infant  series  and  after  the  toddler  dose.  Antigen-specific  GMCs/  GMTs  and  their 
corresponding 2-sided 95% CIs were calculated after the infant series and the toddler dose.

The demographic characteristics of the evaluable infant and toddler populations were similar to those 
of all subjects with respect to sex, race, racial designation,  and weight at enrollment. The mean ages 
were  4.1  months  at  dose 1,  5.2  months  at  dose  2,  and  6.4  months  at  dose  3.  The  mean  age  at  the 
toddler dose was 13.4 months. 
 
Efficacy results 
Infant series 
Before vaccination, the percentage of subjects with IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL for the 7 
common  serotypes  ranged  from  0.6%  (serotype  4)  to  33.9%  (serotype  14)  in  the 
13vPnC+DTaP  group  and  ranged  from  0.6%  (serotype  4)  to  27.8%  (serotype  14)  in  the 
7vPnC+DTaP  group.  Before  vaccination,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  IgG  concentrations 
≥0.35 μg/mL for the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 1.1% (serotype 1) to 41.5% (serotype 
19A) in the 13vPnC+DTaP group and ranged from 1.1% (serotype 1) to 43.2% (serotype 19A) 
in the 7vPnC+DTaP group.  
The  direct  comparison  of  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  IgG  concentrations  ≥0.35 
μg/mL  1  month  after  the  infant  series  between  subjects  who  received  13vPnC+DTaP  and 
subjects  who  received  7vPnC+DTaP  is  presented  in  Table  23  for  the  evaluable  infant

When comparing the proportions of subjects who achieved IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL for 
the 6 additional serotypes 1 month after the 13vPnC+DTaP infant series to the lowest response 
observed  among  the  7  common  serotypes  in  the  7vPnC+DTaP  (96.6%  for  serotype  19F)  the 
noninferiority criterion was met for all of the 6 additional serotypes. 
The  direct  comparison  of  IgG  GMCs  1  month  after  the  infant  series  between  subjects  who 
received  13vPnC+DTaP  and  subjects  who  received  7vPnC+DTaP  is  presented  in  Table  25  for 
the  evaluable  infant  immunogenicity  population.  For  the  7  common  serotypes,  the  IgG  GMCs 
were numerically lower in the 13vPnC+DTaP  group than in the 7vPnC+DTaP group. However, 
the noninferiority criterion was met for all 7 common serotypes (lower limit of the 95% CI for 
the ratio >0.5).

The  direct  comparison  of  OPA  GMTs  1  month  after  the  infant  series  between  subjects  who 
received  13vPnC+DTaP  and  subjects  who  received  7vPnC+DTaP  is  presented  in  Table  27  for 
the  evaluable  infant  immunogenicity  population.  Although  functional  antibody  response  was 
intended  to  be  descriptive  and  was  not  prespecified  as  a  criterion  of  comparison,  the  lower 
limits  of  the  95%  CI  of  GMRs  exceeded  0.5  for  all  7  common  serotypes.  In  addition,  the 
immune response was statistically significantly greater (lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio 
>1.0)  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  than  in  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group  for  2  of  the  7  common 
serotypes (serotypes 6B and 19F). After the infant series, the majority of subjects achieved an 
OPA  titer  ≥  LLOQ  for  the  7  common  serotypes  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  (91.3%  [serotype 
9V] to 100% [serotypes 4, 14, and 18C]) and the 7vPnC+DTaP group (89.5% [serotype 19F] 
to 100% [serotypes 4 and 18C]). The differences in proportion of responders (13vPnC+DTaP – 
7vPnC+DTaP)  to each of the 7  common  serotypes ranged from  -1.8%  (serotype 9V) to 9.8% 
(serotype 19F). Although functional antibody response was intended to be descriptive and was 
not prespecified as a criterion  of  comparison,  the  lower limits of the 95% CI  exceeded  –10% 
for all 7 common serotypes. In addition, the immune response in the 13vPnC+DTaP group was 
statistically significantly greater (lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in proportions >0) 
than in the 7vPnC+DTaP group for serotype 19F.

Toddler dose 
Before the toddler dose, the  percentage of subjects with IgG concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL  for 
the  7  common  serotypes ranged  from  84.2%  (serotype  18C)  to  97.5%  (serotype  19F) in  the 
13vPnC+DTaP group and ranged from 83.0% (serotype 23F) to 98.7% (serotypes 4 and 14) in 
the  7vPnC+DTaP  group.  Before  the  toddler  dose,  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  IgG 
concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL for the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 72.2% (serotype 3) to 
99.4% (serotypes 5 and 6A) in the 13vPnC+DTaP group and ranged from 1.3% (serotype 1) to 
84.9% (serotype 19A) in the 7vPnC+DTaP group. 
The  direct  comparison  of  the  proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  IgG  concentrations  ≥0.35 
μg/mL  1  month  after  the  toddler  dose  between  subjects  who  received  13vPnC+DTaP  and 
subjects  who  received  7vPnC+DTaP  is  presented  in  Table  29  for  the  evaluable  toddler 
immunogenicity population. The noninferiority criterion was met for all 7 common serotypes.

Assessor’s  comment:  The  response  to  serotype  3  in  the  13vPnC+DTaT  group  was  lower 
following the toddler dose compared to the response to the infant series, in contrast to all other 
serotypes.

Assessor’s  comment:  The  lower  IgG  GMT  response  to  serotype  3  following  the  toddler  dose 
compared to the response to the infant series was not seen for the OPA GMTs.  
After  the  toddler  dose,  the  majority  of  subjects  achieved  an  OPA  titer  ≥  LLOQ  for  the  7 
common serotypes in  the 13vPnC+DTaP group  (98.6% [serotype  6B] to 100%)  [serotypes 4, 
9V, 14, and 18C]) and the 7vPnC+DTaP group (95.5% [serotype 19F] to 100%).% [serotypes 
4, 9V, 14, and 18C]). The differences in proportion of responders (13vPnC – 7vPnC) to each of 
the 7 common serotypes ranged from 0.0% (serotypes 4, 9V, 14 and 18C) to 3.8% (serotype 
19F).  Although  functional  antibody  response  was  intended  to  be  descriptive  and  was  not 
prespecified as a criterion of comparison, the lower limits of the 95% CI for the differences in 
proportion of responders exceeded –10% for all 7 common serotypes.  
After  the  toddler  dose,  the  majority  of  subjects  achieved  an  OPA  titer  ≥  LLOQ  for  the  6 
additional serotypes in the 13vPnC+DTaP group (95.1% [serotype 5] to 100% [serotypes 1, 3, 
6A, 7F, and 19A]). After the toddler dose, the percentage of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥ 
LLOQ for the 6 additional serotypes ranged from 0.7% (serotype 5) to 88.9% (serotype 6A) in 
the  7vPnC+DTaP  group.  The  differences  in  proportion  of  responders  (13vPnC+DTaP  – 
7vPnC+DTaP)  to  each  of  the  6  additional  serotypes  ranged  from  11.1%  (serotype  6A)  to 
98.6%  (serotype  1).  The  immune  response  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  was  statistically 
significantly greater (lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in proportions >0) than in the 
7vPnC+DTaP group for all 6 additional serotypes. In the 7vPnC+DTaP group, there was a high

percentage of subjects achieving an OPA titer ≥ LLOQ (88.9%) for serotype 6A, consistent with 
crossreactivity of functional antibody response between serotypes 6A and 6B. 
Concomitant Vaccine Antibody Response (DTaP Antigens) 
The GMCs for diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, PT, and FHA measured 1 month after the infant 
series  are  presented  in  Table  42  for  the  evaluable  infant  immunogenicity  population.  All 
subjects  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP,  7vPnC+DTaP,  and  the  DTaP  groups  had  the  prespecified 
antibody  level  after  the  infant  series  for  tetanus  in  the  evaluable  infant  immunogenicity 
population.  All  subjects  in  the  3  groups  also  had  the  prespecified  antibody  level  for  tetanus 
before  the  infant  series,  so  there  was  no  change  in  immune  response  to  be  detected.  The 
majority of subjects achieved the prespecified level after the infant series for diphtheria toxoid, 
PT,  and  FHA  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  (99.4%  in  each  antigen),  7vPnC+DTaP  (96.6%  in  each 
antigen), and the DTaP (100% in each antigen) groups in the evaluable infant immunogenicity 
population. In all 3 groups there was a marked  increase  in the proportions of subjects with a 
prespecified antibody level for diphtheria toxoid, PT, and FHA after the infant series compared 
with the corresponding proportions before the infant series. 
The  GMCs  for  diphtheria  toxoid,  tetanus  toxoid,  PT,  and  FHA  measured  1  month  after  the 
toddler dose are presented in Table 44 for the evaluable toddler immunogenicity population. All 
subjects  (100%)  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP,  7vPnC+DTaP,  and  the  DTaP  groups  achieved  the 
prespecified antibody level after the toddler dose for diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, PT, and 
FHA in the evaluable toddler immunogenicity population. 
Assessor’s  comments:  The  overall  immunogenicity  results  from  this  study  are  generally  in 
agreement  with  what  has  been  reported  from  previous  studies.  No  concerns  regarding 
immunogenicity are raised by these results.

Local  reactions,  infant  series:  The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  local  reactions 
within  7  days  after  doses  1  in  the  infant  series  are  presented  in  Table  53.  The  frequencies 
following  the  second  dose  were  generally  slightly  higher  compared  to  the  first  dose,  but  the 
frequencies for local reactions following the third dose were similar to those after the first dose 
(data  not  shown  in  this  AR).  Most  local  reactions  reported  within  7  days  of  vaccine 
administration were mild or moderate in severity. 
Local  reactions  toddler  dose:  The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  with  local  reactions 
reported  within  7  days  after  the  toddler  dose  are  presented  in  Table  59.  Most  local  reactions 
reported within 7 days of vaccine administration were mild or moderate in severity and only 1 
subject in the 13vPnC+DTaP group experienced significant tenderness.

Systemic  reactions,  infant  series:  The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  systemic 
events,  including  the  use  of  antipyretic  medications,  within  7  days  after  doses  1,  2,  and  3  of 
the  infant  series  are  presented  in  Table  61.  After  each  dose  of  the  infant  series,  the 
percentages  of  subjects  who  reported  any  systemic  events  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  were 
higher than those in the DTaP group but were similar to those in the 7vPnC+DTaP group. The 
frequencies of systemic reactions were similar following the second and third compared to the 
first dose.

Adverse  events:  AEs  were  reported  by  similar  percentages  of  subjects  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP, 
7vPnC+DTaP,  and  DTaP  groups  during  the  infant  series  and  at  the  toddler  dose.  In  the  3 
vaccine groups, the most frequently reported types of AEs were infections and infestations. The 
AEs reported were generally consistent with childhood illnesses. 
Serious adverse events, Infant series: Febrile convulsion was reported during the study by 22 
subjects:  6  subjects  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group,  9  subjects  in  the  7vPnC+DTaP  group  and  7 
subjects  in  the  DTaP  group.  All  cases of  febrile  convulsion  reported during  the  study  met  the 
criteria for an SAE, and all led to withdrawal. One (1) case of febrile convulsion that occurred 
after the toddler dose for a subject in the DTaP group (subject 10011016) persisted when the 
subject was discontinued from the study, and the event was resolved after the discontinuation. 
All  other  cases  were  resolved  during  the  subject’s  participation  to  the  study.  The  majority  of 
febrile convulsions occurred due to fever caused by concurrent viral illness. None of the cases 
of febrile convulsion was considered related to the study vaccine. 
Kawasaki’s disease  was reported  as an  SAE  during the study by 4 subjects: 2 subjects in the 
DTaP  group  and  1  subject  each  in  the  13vPnC+DTaP  group  and  7vPnC+DTaP  group;  all  of 
these cases led to withdrawal. In addition, 1 subject in the 13vPnC+DTaP group was diagnosed 
as having Kawasaki’s disease after having completed the study, though the symptom had been 
reported  at  the  toddler  dose;  as  noted  in  Section  12.4.2.3,  this  event  met  the  criteria  for  an 
SAE although it was not recorded as such in the study database. 
All  cases  of  Kawasaki’s  disease  persisted.  However,  all  acute  symptoms  resolved  and  all 
subjects  are  being  followed  for  long  term  follow  up.  None  of  the  cases  of  Kawasaki’s  disease 
was considered related to the study vaccine. 
Based  on  recent  national  surveillance  reviews  in  Japan  in  2007  and  in  2009,  the  number  of 
patients with Kawasaki’s disease is increasing. In the nationwide survey of Kawasaki’s disease 
conducted in 2007, targeting patients who were affected by this disease in 2005 and 2006, the 
average  annual  incidence  rate  was  184.6  per  100,000  children  aged  0-4  years.  In  the 
nationwide survey of Kawasaki’s disease conducted in 2009, which included patients treated for 
the  disease  in  2007  and  2008,  annual  incidence  rates  were  215.3  and  218.6  per  100,000 
Prevenar 13 P46 049 and 050

children  aged  0-4  years  in  2007  and  2008,  respectively.  These  were  the  highest  annual 
Kawasaki’s disease incidence rates ever recorded in Japan. 
Assessor’s  comment:    There  was  a  significant  difference  in  the  proportion  of  recipients  of  
13vPnc  and  7vPnC  who  experienced    fever  (≥37.5°C  but  ≤39°C)  compared  to  DTaP.  The 
serious adverse events of febrile seizures and Kawasakis disease were fairly equally distributed 
between all vaccine groups. The discussions/conclusions of the MAH regarding these 2 events 
are endorsed. 
Serious  adverse  events,  Toddler  dose:  In  the  DTaP  group,  1  severe  AE  of  febrile  convulsion 
occurred in the after toddler dose safety population. There were no related severe AEs. 
6096A1-1000; A Phase 1 Open-label Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of a Single Dose of 
13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Healthy Chinese Adults, Children and Infants 
  Description 
Study  6096A1-1000-CN  (B1851046)  was  conducted  in  China  and  was  a  Phase  1,  open-label, 
single-center  study  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  a  single  intramuscular  dose  of 
13vPnC  for  approximately  1  month  after  vaccination  in  healthy  Chinese  subjects  in  3  age 
groups: 
  Group 1: Adults aged 18 through 55 years (before the fifty-sixth birthday) 
  Group 2: Children aged 3 through 5 years (before the sixth birthday) 
  Group 3: Infants aged approximately 2 months (42 to 98 days) 
Subjects were enrolled into the 3 age groups sequentially: Group 1, followed by Group 2, and 
then  Group  3.  The  safety  of  subjects  in  Groups  1  and  2  was  assessed  by  a  safety  review 
committee prior to enrolling subjects in the subsequent age group. 
All vaccinated subjects were assessed for safety for approximately 1 month after vaccination. 
  Methods 
  Objectives 
To assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 13vPnC in healthy Chinese subjects in 3 
age groups: 
  Group 1: Adults aged 18 through 55 years (before the fifty-sixth birthday) 
  Group 2: Children aged 3 through 5 years (before the sixth birthday) 
  Group 3: Infants aged approximately 2 months (42 to 98 days) 
  Study design 
This  was  a  phase  1,  open-label,  single-center  study  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  a 
single dose of 13vPnC for approximately 1 month after vaccination in healthy Chinese subjects 
in  3  age  groups:  adults,  children  3-5  years  and  infants  2  months  of  age.  Subjects  were 
enrolled into the  3  age groups sequentially: group 1,  followed by group 2, and then group 3. 
The  safety  of  subjects  in  groups  1  and  2  was  assessed  by  a  safety  review  committee  (SRC) 
prior to enrolling subjects in the subsequent age group. 
All vaccinated subjects were assessed  for safety  for approximately 1 month after vaccination. 
At the end of the study, parents/legal guardians of infants in group 3 were offered 3 additional 
doses of Prevenar for their children in order to  complete the infant pneumococcal  vaccination 
schedule recommended in China. 
  Study population /Sample size 
Main Criteria for Inclusion: Healthy Chinese male or female adults, children and infants with a 
signed  and  dated  informed  consent  document  with  no  previous  vaccination  with  licensed  or 
investigational pneumococcal vaccine. At the time of enrollment subjects in group 1 were to be 
aged  18  through  55  years,  subjects  in  group  2  were  to  be  aged  3  through  5  years,  and 
subjects in group 3 were to be aged 42 to 98 days. Subjects were to be healthy as determined 
by medical history, physical examination, and judgment of the investigator.

Subjects  and/or  parent/legal  guardian  had  to  be  willing  and  able  to  comply  with  scheduled 
visits, and study procedures.  All male and female  subjects (in  group 1) who  were  biologically 
capable of having children were to  agree and commit to the use of a reliable method of birth 
control from the signing of the ICF until the end of the study. Female subjects (in group 1) who 
were biologically capable of having children were to have negative urine pregnancy tests. 
Subjects  were  ineligible  to  participate  if  they  were  previously  vaccinated  with  a  licensed  or 
investigational  pneumococcal  vaccine,  had  a  previous  anaphylactic  reaction  to  any  vaccine  or 
vaccine-related  component,  or  if  there  was  any  contraindication  to  vaccination  with 
pneumococcal  vaccine.  Subjects  with  previous  conditions  such  as  bleeding  diathesis  or 
prolonged  bleeding,  known  or  suspected  immune  deficiency  or  suppression,  major  known 
congenital malformation or serious chronic disorder, significant neurological disorder or history 
of  seizure,  severe  acute  or  chronic  medical  or  psychiatric  condition  or  laboratory  abnormality 
were  also  ineligible  to  participate.  Women  who  were  breastfeeding  or  pregnant  (known  or 
suspected),  and  subjects who  received  any  investigational products or  medical  devices  within 
28 days before investigational product administration or during the study were excluded from 
participation. Subjects who were related to site staff or Pfizer employees also were not eligible 
to participate. 
Determination of Sample Size: Approximately 72 subjects participated in this study at 1 site. A 
sample size of 20 adults aged 18 through 55 years, 20 children aged 3 through 5 years, and 20 
infants  aged  42  to  98  days  was  required  for  this  study  based  on  regulatory  requirements  in 
China. An additional 4 subjects were to be enrolled in each age group for a total of 24 subjects 
per age group to allow for drop-outs. 
 
Treatments 
13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (13vPnC) is the investigational product used in this 
study. 13vPnC was supplied as a 0.5 mL suspension in a prefilled syringe.  A single dose (0.5 
mL)  of  13vPnC  was  administered  intramuscularly  into  the  deltoid  muscle  of  the  arm  or 
anterolateral muscle of the thigh, as appropriate. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety  Evaluations:  Any  subject  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  investigational  product  was 
included  in  the  evaluation  for  safety.  Subjects  were  observed  for  any  acute  reactions  for  at 
least 30 minutes after vaccination. Each  day  for 7  days after vaccination (days 1 to 7, where 
day  1  is  the  day  of  vaccination),  the  subject  or  the  subject’s  parent/legal  guardian/caregiver 
monitored and recorded the following in an e-diary: 
Local reactions 
  Group 1: pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site 
  Groups 2 and 3: tenderness, redness, and swelling at the injection site 
Systemic events 
  Group 1: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain 
  Groups 2 and 3: fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased sleep, and decreased 
sleep 
Use of antipyretic medication to treat or prevent symptoms 
These  prospectively  collected  local  reactions  and  systemic  events  were  considered  solicited 
AEs. All other AEs (including SAEs) were collected and recorded in the CRF from the signing of 
the ICF until the end of the study (approximately 1 month after vaccination). A Safety Review 
Committee  (SRC)  reviewed  safety  data  (SAEs,  solicited  local  reactions  and  systemic  events) 
during  day  1  through  day  7  and  determined  whether  the  study  should  proceed  to  enroll 
subjects  in  the  subsequent  age  group,  i.e.  in  progressively  more  vulnerable  populations, 
Groups 1 to 3. 
  Statistical Methods 
The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  solicited  local  reactions,  systemic  events,  and  use  of 
antipyretic medications on any day within the  7-day  period (days 1 to 7) after investigational 
product administration was summarized for each group. 
Other AEs reported within approximately 1 month after vaccination were categorized according 
to the Medical  Dictionary for  Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and were summarized by group.

All summaries showed, by  group, the number and percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 
event and the number of events. 
Safety data was summarized periodically  during  the study to  ensure the safety of subjects or 
as needed for safety review by the SRC.

Table  8  presents  the  subjects  reporting  local  reactions  within  7  days  (safety  population).  In 
group 1, the most frequently reported local reaction was pain at the injection site, reported by 
23 subjects (95.8%). The  pain at the  injection  site was mostly mild to moderate in intensity. 
Table 8 also shows that  1  subject  in group  1  had  an  emergency room  (ER) visit due to pain. 
This was actually a data entry error in e-diary (the data entry error details have been recorded 
on  site  source  documents,  which  have  been  verified  by  the  site  manager  during  the  onsite 
monitoring visit). The subject visited the ER because of a fever of 38.5°C rather than pain at 
injection site. 
In  group  2,  the  most  frequently  reported  local  reaction  was  tenderness,  reported  by  18 
subjects (75%), but in no case did it interfere with limb movement. 
In  group  3,  the  most  frequently  reported  local  reaction  was  swelling,  reported  by  6  subjects 
(25%), which was mild or moderate in intensity. 
Table 8 Subjects Reporting Local Reactions Within 7 Days – Safety Population 
Abbreviation: NA = Not applicable; CRF = Case report form. 
a. N = number of subjects reporting yes for at least 1 day or no for all days. 
b. n = Number of subjects reporting the specific characteristic.

c. Exact 2-sided confidence interval (CI) based on the observed proportion of subjects. 
d. For Group 1, mild is 2.5 to 5.0 cm, moderate is >5.0 to 10.0 cm, severe is >10.0 cm, and necrosis 
or exfoliative dermatitis, if any of them is recorded on the adverse event CRF to be evident. For Group 
2 or Group 3, mild is 0.5 to 2.0 cm, moderate is >2.0 to 7.0 cm, and severe is >7.0 cm. 
e. For Group 1 only. Mild = does not interfere with activity, moderate = interferes with activity, severe 
=prevents  daily  activity,  and  ER  or  Hospitalized  =  requires  an  emergency  room  (ER)  visit  or 
hospitalization. 
f.  Data  entry  error  in  e-dairy  for  subject  10011024's  ER  visit  due  to  pain  at  injection  site.  Subject 
visited the ER due to fever rather than pain. 
g. For Group 2 or Group 3 only. 
h.  Any  local  reaction  =  any  redness,  any  swelling,  or  any  pain  at  injection  site  for  Group  1;  any 
redness, any swelling, or any tenderness for Group 2 or Group 3. 
Table 11 presents the subjects reporting systemic events and antipyretic use within 7 days, in 
group  1.  According  to  the  SFDA  grading  for  fever,  1  subject  in  group  1  had  fever  ≥37.7°C 
which was considered mild and was ≥37.7°C but ≤38.5°C. 
Table  12  presents  the  subjects  reporting  systemic  events  and  the  antipyretic  medication  use 
within 7 days in group 2 and 3 (safety population). 
In group 2, only 1 subject reported a systemic event of increased sleep. In group 3, 3 subjects 
each  reported  irritability  and  increased  sleep,  while  4  subjects  reported  decreased  sleep.  No 
subjects in either group 2 or 3 reported fever ≥38.0°C. No subjects in either group 2 or 3 used 
antipyretic medication within 7 days of vaccination.

Summary of Adverse Events 
Only  1  AE  (bronchopneumonia)  was  reported  in  this  study,  which  occurred  in  group  3  and  was  also 
serious and severe. This AE was determined by the investigator to be not related to the vaccination. No 
non-serious AEs were reported during the study. 
Assessor’s  comment:  The  Chinese  study  was  very  small,  and  the  safety  data  obtained  are  not 
considered to add much to the already substantial safety data base of Prevenar 13.  
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  Japanese  study  generally  confirmed  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  results  obtained  in  other 
studies  with  Prevenar13.  The  Chinese  study  only  had  a  safety  objective,  and  considering  the  limited 
size of the study it is not considered to contribute to the overall safety information for Prevenar 13.  
III. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

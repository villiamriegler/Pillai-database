Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Qutenza 
capsaicin 
On 23 July 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion 
recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Qutenza. The 
marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Astellas Pharma Europe B.V. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows2: 
“Qutenza is indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in non-diabetic adults either alone or 
in combination with other medicinal products for pain.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

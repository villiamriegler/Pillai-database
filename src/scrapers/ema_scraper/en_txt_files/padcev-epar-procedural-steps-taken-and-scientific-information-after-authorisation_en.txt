Based on a comprehensive review of the safety data 
order to introduce new posology recommendations in 
case of pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease (ILD), 
add a new warning on ‘pneumonitis/ILD’ and add it 
to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The RMP 
relevant to pneumonitis/Interstitial lung disease (ILD) the 
following information have been added to the SmPC: 
Severe, life-threatening or fatal pneumonitis/ILD have 
occurred in patients treated with enfortumab vedotin. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms indicative of 
pneumonitis/ILD such as hypoxia, cough, dyspnea or 
interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Corticosteroids 
should be administered for Grade ≥ 2 events (e.g., initial 
dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed 
by a taper). 
Withhold Padcev for Grade 2 pneumonitis/ILD and consider 
dose reduction. Permanently discontinue Padcev for Grade 
≥3 pneumonitis/ILD.

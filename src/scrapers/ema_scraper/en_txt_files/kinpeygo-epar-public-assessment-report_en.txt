2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Kinpeygo was originally developed for the indication: treatment of primary immunoglobulin A (IgA) 
nephropathy (IgAN) in adults at high risk of disease progression. The indication was, however, 
restricted during the CHMP assessment to the treatment of primary IgAN in adults at risk of rapid 
disease progression with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥1.5 g/g (see further details in 
section 2.4. ). 
Assessment report  
EMA/570757/2022 
Page 10/116 
 
 
 
 
IgAN, sometimes referred to as Berger’s disease, is a serious, immune complex-mediated autoimmune 
kidney disease. It is a form of glomerulonephritis, an inflammatory condition affecting the glomeruli. 
Primary IgA nephropathy is characterised by deposition of the IgA antibody in the glomerulus. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
IgA nephropathy is the most prevalent primary chronic glomerulonephritis worldwide (KDIGO 20211). 
IgAN is an orphan disease that is estimated to affect approximately 200,000 people in the EU and in 
the United Kingdom. There are geographical differences in the disease prevalence, with a higher 
prevalence in individuals of East Asian origin compared with Caucasians and an even lower prevalence 
in individuals of African origin. There are also notable differences in sex distribution, with a markedly 
higher male predominance in Caucasian populations compared to an equal prevalence in males and 
females in Asia (Feehally and Cameron 20112, Schena and Nistor 20183, Wyatt and Julian 20134). 
Primary IgAN can occur at any age, but the clinical onset is common during the second or third 
decades of life (Donadio and Grande 20025). Patients with IgAN are therefore younger and often have 
a lower comorbid condition burden than most other patients with chronic kidney disease (Knoop et al 
20136). 
It is a life-threatening condition that is chronically debilitating due to progressive loss of kidney 
function that results in reduced quality of life and shortened life expectancy (Glassock et al 20197, 
Jarrick et al 20198, Knoop et al 20136). Up to 50% of patients with IgAN develop End Stage Renal 
Disease (ESRD), requiring haemodialysis and kidney transplantation, within 20 years of diagnosis (Lai 
et al 20169, Moriyama et al 201410, Schena 199011, Vecchio et al 201512, Wyatt and Julian 201313).  
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
IgA nephropathy is a disease characterised by the deposition of mucosal galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-
IgA1) antibodies, either alone or in complex with immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA auto-antibodies, 
in the glomerular mesangium, where they initiate a cascade of inflammatory events, eventually 
causing irreversible glomerulosclerosis and loss of filtration capability. Although IgAN manifests in the 
kidney, there is data supporting a pivotal role of the mucosal immune system in the pathogenesis of 
1 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical practice guideline for the management of glomerular 
diseases.

the condition (Barratt 202014, Boyd et al 201215, Kiryluk et al 201416, Lai 201217, McCarthy et al 
201118, Wyatt and Julian 201313). It is thought that the origins of the disease reside in the mucosal 
tissue of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Barratt 202014, Selvaskandan et al 201919). Peyer’s patches 
are aggregations of lymphoid follicles, located in the mucosal layer of the intestine, and concentrated 
in the ileum, where they produce mucosal IgA antibodies, which play a key role in the gut immune 
system’s first-line defence. They are part of the gut-associated lymphoid system (GALT) and serve as 
antigen sampling and inductive sites. Peyer’s patches are the main source of primed, Gd-IgA1-
expressing mucosal B-cells (Boyd et al 201215).  
In IgAN patients, mucosal B-cells located in Peyer’s patches are primed to produce Gd-IgA1, which in 
circulation can form immune complexes with IgG or IgA auto-antibodies (Wyatt and Julian 201313, 
Smith et al 2006, Suzuki et al 201120, Tomana et al 199921). These complexes bind to mesangial cells 
in the glomeruli, the kidney’s filtration apparatus, and initiate an inflammatory cascade that damages 
the membranes, resulting in renal injury (Wyatt and Julian 201313, Suzuki et al 201122, Novak et al 
201323, Novak et al 201524). As the disease progresses, the glomeruli are destroyed, leading to 
deterioration of renal function which ultimately may result in ESRD and the need for either dialysis or 
kidney transplantation.  
This pathogenesis suggests the local mucosa of the ileum to be the origin of IgAN, and thereby a 
relevant drug target for a potential disease-modifying treatment to delay or prevent ESRD. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The disease can be classified into primary or secondary forms. In the primary form, there are no 
relevant associated co-morbidities, whereas in the secondary form, the condition may be diagnosed in 
patients with non-renal diseases, ranging from chronic liver disease and inflammatory states to chronic 
infections and neoplasms. In the Kinpeygo clinical development programme, patients with primary 
IgAN only were studied. 
Primary IgAN can occur at any age, but the clinical onset is common during the second or third 
decades of life (Donadio and Grande 20025). Children and adolescents with IgAN typically present with 
painless macroscopic haematuria during an acute upper respiratory tract or GI illness, whereas adults 
usually present with proteinuria, microscopic haematuria, or hypertension. The first indication of IgAN, 
that may be detected incidentally through dipstick or laboratory testing of a urine sample, is usually 
the appearance of protein and/or blood in the urine (proteinuria and haematuria, respectively),

indicating leakage through the damaged glomeruli in the kidney. IgAN can only be diagnosed with a 
kidney biopsy. There are no validated diagnostic serum or urine biomarkers for IgAN. 
Most commonly, IgAN is asymptomatic and follows a slowly progressive course with approximately 
25% to 30% of any cohort developing kidney failure within 20 to 25 years of presentation. There is 
good evidence that the epidemiology, clinical presentation, disease progression, and long
term 
outcome of IgAN differ across ethnic populations around the world. IgAN is most prevalent and more 
‐
likely to cause kidney failure in people of East Asian ancestry, followed by Caucasians, and is relatively 
rare in individuals of African descent. It is currently unclear if these observations are due to differences 
in pathogenesis and/or the contribution of varying genetic and environmental influences. 
Clinical predictors of progression of IgA nephropathy include a reduction in GFR (manifested by 
elevated serum creatinine), hypertension (>140/90 mmHg), and persistent protein excretion above 
1g/day. Patients who have recurrent episodes of gross haematuria without proteinuria are at low risk 
for progressive kidney disease. Other potentially modifiable risk factors for progressive disease include 
obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and hyperuricemia and smoking. 
Certain findings on renal biopsy (Histologic predictors of progression) in patients with IgA nephropathy 
have also been associated with an increased risk of progressive disease. These include markers of 
more severe inflammatory disease, such as crescent formation and immune deposits in the capillary 
loops in addition to the mesangial deposits that are present in all patients, and markers of chronic 
fibrotic disease such as glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and vascular disease. 
2.1.5.  Management 
There are currently no treatments approved for the management of patients with primary IgAN in the 
European Union. Standard of care comprises supportive therapy, which focuses on lowering of 
proteinuria and optimising blood pressure control by maximum tolerated inhibition of the renin 
angiotensin system (RAS), together with a low sodium diet (KDIGO 2021 guideline). When proteinuria 
persists despite optimal RAS inhibition with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or 
angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), patients are at risk of progression to ESRD. There are 
no further recommended treatments, and therapeutic options are generally limited to consideration of 
a 6-month treatment course of high-dose systemic glucocorticosteroids (GCS). However, the benefit-
risk balance for the use of GCS over optimised supportive care in IgAN has been questioned, based on 
the increased risk of serious steroid-related adverse effects, in particular life-threatening serious 
infections reported in two recent randomised controlled trials in IgAN patients (STOP-IgAN and 
TESTING, Lv et al 201725, Rauen et al 201526, Rauen et al 202027). Additional immunosuppressants 
beyond GCS, such as cyclophosphamide, are suggested for specific situations only, for example in 
cases of crescentic IgAN where renal function is rapidly deteriorating. Therefore, there is a high unmet 
medical need for a targeted treatment with a favourable benefit-risk profile for patients with primary 
IgAN at risk of progressing to ESRD.

2.1.6.  About the product 
Kinpeygo is an oral, 4 mg modified-release hard capsule containing budesonide as active substance, a 
well-known corticosteroid that is used in a number of inflammatory diseases. 
The proposed recommended dose is 16 mg once daily in the morning, at least one hour before a meal, 
for 9 months.  
The modified-release capsule formulation provides a two-step release by combining a delayed capsule 
disintegration with a sustained/prolonged release of the active substance budesonide in the ileum.  
2.1.7.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
IgAN is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. 
Progression to ESRD occurs in up to 50% of affected patients, often over 20-25 years of 
observation.  
There are currently no treatments approved for the management of patients with primary 
IgAN.  Current standards of care focus on optimisation of antihypertensive and antiproteinuric 
therapies (typically renin-angiotensin system blockade) to reduce disease progression (KDIGO 
2021). 
The main evidence for safety and efficacy of Kinpeygo (budesonide) is derived from a 
randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in a high-risk primary IgAN 
population of patients with significant proteinuria and mild to moderate loss of kidney function 
on a background of optimised RAS inhibitor therapy (Nef-301). Additionally, there are 
supportive data from a placebo-controlled phase 2b clinical trial (Nef-202). The strength of 
evidence was considered sufficient to support an accelerated assessment. 
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as there were major objections in quality and clinical and a number of other 
concerns which precluded an assessment under accelerated timelines.  
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a conditional marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data.  
Based on the observed difference in eGFR slope over 1 year, it is highly likely that the primary eGFR 
AUC(0-2) endpoint and eGFR 2-year slope will be statistically significant in this patient population after 2 
years of follow-up at the time of the Part B analysis of the phase 3 trial, which is fully recruited and 
ongoing. There is ≥90% power for the Part B analysis of 2-year chronic slope in this patient 
population. A difference in chronic slope of 4.79 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year in the subgroup of patients 
with UPCR ≥1.3 g/gram is well in excess of the 0.85 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year threshold given for the 
1-year eGFR chronic slope to predict longer term clinical benefit on the composite clinical endpoint in 
Table 3 of Inker et al 201928. Therefore, longer term clinical benefit in this patient population is highly

likely to be confirmed at the time of the final analysis of the phase 3 study. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed.  
Patients with baseline UPCR ≥1.3 g/gram are at risk of rapid disease progression to ESRD over a short 
period of time, and represent a group of patients for whom the unmet medical need is considerable. 
Without treatment, an eGFR deterioration of 9.36 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year would be expected (1-
year eGFR slope in the placebo group of the Phase 3 trial), and as a result these patients are at 
significant risk of requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation in the near term. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the 
fact that additional data are still required.  
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability of Kinpeygo for this restricted patient 
population are considered to outweigh the potential risks, including any uncertainties regarding the 
interpretability and durability of the benefits shown for UPCR. In these patients with higher levels of 
baseline proteinuria, the applicant believes a positive benefit-risk profile has already been 
demonstrated during the first year of follow-up, including substantial eGFR benefit over 1 year. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as modified release hard capsules containing 4 mg budesonide as 
active substance. 
Other ingredients are: 
Capsule content: Sugar spheres (sucrose and corn starch), hypromellose, macrogol, citric acid 
monohydrate, ethylcellulose, medium chain triglycerides and oleic acid; 
Capsule shell: hypromellose, macrogol, titanium dioxide (E171), methacrylic acid and methyl 
methacrylate copolymers, talc and dibutylsebacate; 
Printing ink: shellac and iron oxide black (E172). 
The product is packaged in white high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with white polypropylene 
(PP) child-resistant closures with induction seals as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of budesonide is 6α, 17α -[(1RS)-butylidenebis(oxy)]-11β, 21-dihydroxypregna-
1,4-diene-3,20-dione corresponding to the molecular formula C25H34O6. It has a relative molecular 
mass of 430.5 g/mol and the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/570757/2022 
Page 15/116 
 
 
 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The active substance (AS) is a slightly hygroscopic white to off-white crystalline solid, practically 
insoluble in water. 
Budesonide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of nine chiral centres. Eight 
stereocentres are defined whereas the other is a mixture of epimers at C* (Figure 1). 
Polymorphism has not been observed for budesonide. 
As there is a monograph of budesonide in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturers of the 
active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) 
which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information for both manufacturers has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the 
Certificates of Suitability (CEP 2010-190 and CEP 1997 067). 
For  CEP  2010  190,  the  container  closure  system  is  stated  in  the  CEP.  For  CEP  1997-067,  the  active 
substance is packaged in the PE bags are placed inside thermally welded polyester-aluminium- polyester 
polypropylene (PAPP). Between the double PE bag and PAPP, oxygen scavengers are placed. The bag is 
then placed alternatively into a fibre carton drum or Moplen® containers. The container closure system 
complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The consolidated active substance specification covering both sources of AS includes tests for identity, 
assay, impurities, loss on drying, microbiological quality and residual solvents (all Ph. Eur.). 
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph.  Additional  specifications have  been  set  for  particle  size  distribution  (laser diffraction).  All 
additional methods have been adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2.  
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 3 production scale batches of active substance from each manufacturer were 
provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

Stability 
Stability is covered in CEP 2010-190 which indicates a re-test period of 24 months for both micronized 
and non-micronized material, without any special storage conditions. Only micronized AS is used to 
manufacture finished product. 
For CEP 1997-067, which does not include a re-test period, stability data for up to 5 years under long-
term conditions (25 °C/60% RH) and 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C/75% RH) were 
submitted. These studies used an earlier packaging format without the oxygen scavenger. Further data 
was provided up to 12 months under long term conditions with the scavenger which does not impact 
the stability profile. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance in CEP 1997-067 is sufficiently stable. The 
stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months protected from light in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as white, modified release, size 1, hard capsules containing 4 mg 
budesonide as active substance. The capsules are enterically coated and contain beads with additional 
modified release properties. 
The proposed finished product is designed to pass through the stomach intact and then provide a 
delayed and somewhat prolonged release of budesonide in the ileum, for local pharmacological effect. 
The active substance budesonide is practically insoluble in water and belongs to Biopharmaceutical 
Classification System (BCS) Class II (low solubility, high permeability) and so is micronized. It is 
ensured by each of the active substance manufacturer that the same crystalline polymorph is routinely 
formed as demonstrated comparative XRPD profiles. 
Formulation development was based on analysis of the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and risk 
assessment of critical quality attributes (CQAs) of coated beads and enteric coated capsules. The QTPP 
was defined as a modified release oral capsule containing 4 mg budesonide which meets compendial 
and other quality standards, and which is delivered intact to the ileum. After capsule disintegration, a 
prolonged release of the complete dose of budesonide is intended. Assay, content uniformity, 
impurities and dissolution have been identified as CQAs. The effect of most of the critical material 
attributes (CMAs) on CQAs has been rated by the applicant as “no impact” or “low” due to prior 
knowledge and initial experimental data. 
Several formulations were used during the product development, denoted by letters A- F. Formulation 
F (Nefecon-F) was used for phase 3 clinical study and is the intended final commercial product. The 
development through all formulations (A, B, C-D-E to F) has been described. A detailed overview of 
development and clinical batches was presented (from 2004 – 2020). Pharmacokinetic studies have 
been performed (PK study Nef-103, Nef-104 and Nef-105) to assess the improved formulations 
including selection of Nefecon-F. Based on the results of these studies using Nefecon-A as reference, 
formulation improvements have been made to obtain a robust phase 3 and final commercial product 
with the desired release profile. Sufficient information has been given on changes in formulation, batch 
size and manufacturing size as well as corresponding dissolution data for batches used in 
bioequivalence and clinical studies.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with compendial 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
The release profile of the active substance in the target region, the ileum, has been demonstrated in 
vivo. 
Dose dumping was investigated during development in the range of 0 – 40% ethanol. The results 
indicate that the release profile is not significantly altered in the presence of alcohol and no dose 
dumping occurs. 
The development of the manufacturing process included the identification of critical process 
parameters (CPPs). CPPs and their impact on CQAs were discussed for manufacturing of the beads and 
for manufacturing of the capsules. Risk assessments were carried out with follow up experimentation 
(including design of experiments) that lead to the risk of all but 1 CPPs being defined as low, which 
was not considered acceptable by CHMP. Definition of CPPs was subsequently amended to include 
additional parameters. 
It was unclear in the original dossier whether or not design spaces were claimed for certain steps as 
the process had not been clearly defined, resulting in a major objection. In response, the applicant 
explained that it was not the intention to claim design spaces and revised the process description to 
include set-points and associated normal operating ranges (NORs). A PAR is proposed for 1 step and 
the applied range ensures that the beads exhibit the desired release profile without re-processing. All 
other process parameters are defined by setpoints with associated NORs based on equipment 
capability. The process as defined is considered suitably robust. 
Development of the dissolution methods has been extensively discussed. The dissolution methods are 
deemed critical by the CHMP since they ensure the desired release profile. The initially proposed 
method for both the IPC and the finished product release test was not considered sufficiently 
discriminatory by CHMP thus resulting in a major objection. In response, the applicant submitted a new 
release method which was more discriminatory and after tightening the specifications, was considered 
acceptable by CHMP. 
The revised specifications have been set based on batches used in relevant clinical studies including PK 
studies and are now considered acceptable. Discriminatory power was investigated for capsules by 
varying critical material attributes (CMAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs). The method was 
able to discriminate bad batches from those manufactured according to the agreed process description 
and is considered adequate. 
The applicant currently applies a different dissolution method for IPC of beads compared to the QC 
method for finished product The applicant wasn’t able to demonstrate that the revised IPC method was 
suitable for the bead curing IPC within the frame of this procedure. Therefore, the existing method will 
still be used for now. At the request of CHMP, specification limits have been tightened in line with 
relevant clinical batches. The CHMP recommended the applicant to re-develop the dissolution IPC 
method for beads and to implement a more discriminatory dissolution method post-approval. The 
applicant has committed to doing so (REC). 
The primary packaging is white HDPE bottles with white PP child-resistant closures with induction seals. 
The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of coating of sugar spheres to produce beads with modified release 
properties that are filled into capsules that are enterically coated. The process is considered to be a 
non-standard manufacturing process due to the modified release properties and low active substance 
content. 
The updated IPCs as well as targets and ranges for process parameters are considered justified and 
adequate. No intermediates are defined in the current process. 
The information provided on the holding time for bulk product (enteric coated capsules) and the bulk 
product packaging material is satisfactory. Confirmation of compliance with requirements of NfG on 
Start of Shelf Life of the Finished Dosage Form (CPMP/QWP/072/96) was provided. 
In the initial submission, no process validation data was submitted which is not acceptable for a non-
standard process resulting in a 3rd major objection. In response, the applicant submitted a validation 
report covering four commercial scale batches. With subsequent revisions and further tightening of 
process parameters, the CHMP considers that it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including description, identification (UPLC, UV), assay (UPLC), impurities (UPLC), uniformity of dosage 
units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (UPLC) microbial limits (Ph. Eur.) and residual solvents (HS-GC). 
The finished product specification contains all parameters relevant for this dosage form and is 
acceptable. The proposed limits for residual solvents and impurities have been satisfactorily discussed 
and justified during the procedure considering a maximum daily dose (MDD) of 16 mg (4 capsule with 
4 mg budesonide), the relevant guidelines and the presented data. The final assay range limits 
(release and shelf life) are also acceptable. The limits for dissolution are acceptable as discussed 
above. Omission of testing for water content and disintegration have been justified and can be 
accepted. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on 3 batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant 
elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls in the finished product specification. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active 
substance or the related finished product. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Batch analysis results are provided for 13 production scale batches of the commercial formulation 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 months under long 
term conditions (25ºC / 60%RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product were identical to those 
proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Samples 
were tested for appearance, assay, impurities, dissolution and water content. Under long term conditions, 
no significant changes were observed to any of the measured parameters. Under accelerated conditions, 
there was a slight increase in impurity content but within the specification limits. 
In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Kinpeygo is photostable, either in- or outside of the bottle. 
The results from two in-use studies were provided. The studies mimic the use of the bottles for a 
duration of 60 days. The amount of water did not change significantly, and no effect of the slight water 
increase was observed on the measured parameters. In-use stability of the final finished product if 
stored below 25°C is defined as one month, which is acceptable as it covers the intended dosage 
regimen. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years without specific storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The 3 interlinked major 
objections covering the description of the manufacturing process (ranges and design spaces), 
validation of the manufacturing process, and the development and discriminatory nature of the 
dissolution methods used for release to confirm the desired modified release properties have been 
adequately addressed. Process validation data has been submitted confirming the robustness of the 
process and the process description was amended by defining set-points and tightening associated 
NORs to ensure that the product meets its quality requirements without further processing. The QC 
dissolution method was replaced and suitable limits were established, whereas the applicant committed 
to further developing the IPC method post-approval.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
the applicant is recommended to re-develop the dissolution IPC method for cured beads and to 
implement a more discriminatory dissolution method 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature and data from a reference medicinal 
product. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC 
of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A comprehensive environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been provided by the applicant. 
The PEC/PNEC ratio for microorganisms is below 0.1, and the PEC/PNEC ratio for surface water and 
ground water are <1. The PEC value is below 0.01 μg/L, which is below the trigger for a Phase II 
environmental fate and effects analysis, unless other environmental concerns are apparent. However, 
budesonide is an endocrine active substance, which can be regarded as an environmental concern, and 
a tailored Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis, addressing its specific mechanism of action, 
was performed by the applicant. 
The potential endocrine disrupting properties were addressed in a zebrafish full lifecycle test and the 
most sensitive endpoint (early life stage survival of F1 generation, which was the most sensitive 
endpoint of all aquatic long-term studies) was used in the Predicted Environmental Concentration 
(PEC)/Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) assessment. In addition, budesonide is not persistent, 
and it is not likely to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms, which means it is not a PBT or a vPvB 
substance. 
Budesonide showed no toxicity to the sediment dwelling organism Chironomus riparius. 
The provided extensive ERA has not identified any potential risk or significant risk to the environment 
as a consequence of the use of budesonide (Kinpeygo).

2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical sections of the SmPC are acceptable and in line with the reference product. The 
grounds for not providing new non-clinical data are adequately justified. The non-clinical overview on 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology submitted by the applicant for Kinpeygo is considered 
sufficient and the ERA is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for a modified-release hard capsule containing budesonide. To support the 
marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted 6 phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, 2 
randomised double-blind placebo-controlled studies and 1 open-label uncontrolled study in adult 
patient with primary IgAN. Study Nef-301 was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
In the clinical development program, another name for the intended product was used “Nefecon” and 
is used synonymously in the report for the current name “Kinpeygo” in particular when referring to the 
different formulations (Nefecon A to F).  
GCP aspect 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Data from 6 healthy volunteer studies are included with this application to support the 
biopharmaceutics and clinical pharmacology of Kinpeygo. This includes studies that were conducted as 
part of the formulation development (Nef-103, Nef-104, Nef-105), a pharmacodynamic (PD) and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) study that assessed the effect of single doses of Kinpeygo on serum cortisol, 
with the oral budesonide product Entocort included as comparator (Nef-101), and 2 studies that have 
assessed the impact of food on the bioavailability of Kinpeygo (Nef-106, Nef-107). 
The Nefecon-F formulation used in the phase 3 Nef-301 study is the intended Final Commercial Product 
(FCP). Following demonstration of efficacy in the phase 2b Nef-202 study using the initial Nefecon-A 
formulation, subsequent formulations were developed (Nefecon A, B, C, D, E and F) for pharmaceutical 
reasons to improve patient compliance (by using a smaller capsule) and to gain a robust formulation 
and manufacturing process suited for commercial production. In terms of PK, the aim was for 
subsequent formulations and the FCP to mimic the PK properties of Nefecon-A. 
 
 
 
Table 4 Overview of PK parameters for a single 16 mg dose of the Nefecon-A and Nefecon-F 
formulations (healthy volunteer studies) 
Absorption 
The Kinpeygo formulation is designed to deliver budesonide topically in the ileum. 
The extent of oral absorption of budesonide seems to be complete (Edsbäcker and Andersson 200429) 
and is rapid.  
The time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) is formulation dependent. For Nefecon-F, median 
Tmax ranged from 5.0 to 5.5 hours in the fasted state (studies Nef-105, Nef-106, and Nef-107). 
Following single oral administration of a 16 mg dose of Nefecon-F to healthy subjects, geometric mean 
Cmax ranged between 3.2 and 4.4 ng/mL, and AUC (0-24) ranged between 24.1 and 24.8 ng/mL×h. 
Bioavailability 
Systemic bioavailability of budesonide is low (approximately 10%) due to high first-pass metabolism. 
Bioequivalence 
Bioequivalence studies (Nef-103, Nef-104, and Nef-105) were carried out to address equivalence for 
manufacturing changes during the development (Nefecon formulations A, B, C, D, E and F) and to 
justify changes between clinical trials formulation and finished product intended for marketing.  
Nefecon B formulation was compared to Nefecon A in phase 1 healthy volunteer comparative BA/BE 
study Nef-103. Nefecon C, D and E formulations were compared to Nefecon A in phase 1 healthy 
volunteer comparative BA/BE study Nef-104. Nefecon F is the formulation used in the pivotal phase 3 
study Nef-301 and was assessed versus Nefecon A in phase 1 healthy volunteer comparative BA/BE 
study Nef-105.

The results of study Nef-105 (A Five-Period, Open-Label, Randomised, Repeat Design, Cross-Over 
Study to Assess Budesonide Pharmacokinetic Variables and Intra-Individual Variability of Kinpeygo 
Formulations A and F, and to Assess Single Dose Administration Entocort Pharmacokinetic-Parameters 
in 24 Healthy Volunteers) are presented below:  
Figure 2 Plot of mean plasma budesonide concentrations versus time by treatment on linear 
and semilogarithmic scales – PK analysis set 
The plasma concentration-time profile for Entocort EC was different from the plasma concentration-
time profile for the Kinpeygo formulations. The onset of absorption for Entocort EC was rapid with a 
median Tlag of 40 minutes. 
The ratio of Cmax to AUC was lower for Entocort EC than for Kinpeygo due to a flatter plasma 
concentration-time profile, indicating a longer release and absorption phase. 
The Entocort EC dose contained 9 mg budesonide, which is the highest clinically approved dose that 
could be administered during this study. Even when scaled for the differences in budesonide content, 
the Cmax and AUC obtained from Entocort EC were lower than that seen with the Kinpeygo 
preparations.

Influence of food 
Studies Nef-106 and Nef-107 assessed the effect of food on the bioavailability of Kinpeygo. No 
clinically relevant effect of food on the overall systemic exposure of budesonide was observed when 
either a moderate or high fat meal was consumed 1 hour after a single Kinpeygo 16 mg dose, or when 
a moderate fat meal was consumed 2 hours prior to Kinpeygo dosing. There was a small decrease in 
Cmax observed under fed conditions compared with the fasted condition that was not considered 
clinically relevant.

Distribution 
Budesonide is rapidly and extensively distributed into tissues and organs. Approximately 85 to 90% of 
budesonide binds to plasma proteins in blood over the concentration range of 1 to 100 nmol/L. The 
volume of distribution at steady state is 3 to 4 L/kg (Edsbäcker and Andersson 200429). 
Elimination 
Budesonide has a high clearance rate of approximately 72 to 80 L/h (Edsbäcker and Andersson 200429, 
Entocort SmPC DK 2020 (EN)), that is close to the estimated liver blood flow, and accordingly suggests 
that budesonide is a high hepatic clearance drug (Ryrfeldt et al 198430). For Nefecon-F, mean T1/2 
ranged from 5.0 to 6.8 hours in healthy volunteer studies. 
Excretion 
Budesonide is excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. After oral administration, no 
unchanged budesonide is detected in urine (Edsbäcker and Andersson 200429, Ryrfeldt et al 198430, 
Entocort SmPC DK 2020 (EN)). 
Metabolism 
Budesonide is rapidly metabolised by the liver, primarily by oxidative pathways via the cytochrome 
CYP3A4 and transported by the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and is also metabolised to a lesser 
extent locally in the gut (Edsbäcker and Andersson 200429). There is known polymorphisms in CYP3A4 
(*22) and MDR1. 
The main metabolites of budesonide are 16α-hydroxyprednisolone and 6β-hydroxybudesonide, which 
have less than 1% of the glucocorticoid receptor affinity and anti-inflammatory activity of budesonide 
(Edsbäcker and Andersson 200429). After oral administration, it is estimated that approximately 90% 
of budesonide is cleared by first-pass metabolism through hepatic biotransformation, with the 
metabolites mainly excreted via the kidneys. 
There are no Kinpeygo PK data related to intrinsic or extrinsic factors and no drug-drug interaction 
studies have been performed with Kinpeygo. The proposed prescribing information for Kinpeygo 
includes guidance on the use of budesonide in specific patient populations is aligned with the SmPC for 
the oral budesonide product Entocort. 
The PK of Kinpeygo has not been evaluated in IgAN patients.  
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Budesonide has a potent glucocorticoid effect and a weak mineralocorticoid effect, exhibiting potent 
immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo.  
Systemic bioavailability of Budesonide is low (approximately 10%) due to high first-pass metabolism. 
Kinpeygo is formulated for local treatment of the gut mucosa in the ileum.   
By directing release of budesonide to the ileum where the target immune tissues reside in high 
density, a local pharmacological effect is anticipated. The intended action of Kinpeygo is the 
suppression of mucosal B-cells, located in the Peyer’s patches in the ileum, and inhibition of their 
proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells that produce Gd-IgA1. Consequently, it is expected 
that the occurrence of Gd-IgA1 antibodies and formation of immune complexes in the systemic

circulation will be suppressed, therefore preventing the downstream effects of glomerular mesangial 
deposition of immune complexes containing Gd-IgA1, manifesting as glomerulonephritis and loss of 
renal function. 
Primary pharmacology 
The mechanism of action of Kinpeygo is supported by exploratory analyses of patient serum samples 
from the Nef-202 study, where systemic levels of Gd-IgA1 and of IgA-containing immune complexes 
were significantly reduced by treatment with Kinpeygo in a dose dependent manner (Bhachu et al 
201831). It was also shown that IgA antibodies for two common dietary antigens, casein and gliadin, 
were reduced, as was I-FABP, a marker of gut permeability (Muto et al 201832), in contrast to 
systemically derived IgA specific for tetanus toxid, which was unchanged. In addition, the cytokine B-
cell activating factor of the tumour necrotising factor (TNF) family (BAFF) as well as the soluble forms 
of the cytokine receptors B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and T cell activator and calcium modulating 
ligand interactor (TACI), all involved in B-cell regulation (Bossen and Schneider 200633), were 
significantly reduced in response to Kinpeygo treatment (Molyneux et al 202034). BAFF is a cytokine 
commonly increased in IgAN and its serum levels have been shown to be associated with the clinical 
and histopathological severity of the disease (Xin et al 201335). 
In the original submission, the PD marker results of Study Nef-202 were provided partially only as 
copies from poster presentations. Upon request, the applicant submitted the totality of the PD data 
along with a statistical evaluation. The most relevant findings are presented below. 
For the IgA-related markers Gd-IgA1 and IgA-IgG complexes, a small and dose-dependent 
decrease compared to placebo was observed with Kinpeygo after 9 months. This decrease 
was no longer present after 12 months, i.e. 3 months after cessation of treatment.

The cytokine BAFF was dose-dependently reduced vs. placebo after 9 months’ treatment with 
Kinpeygo. After 12 months (i.e. 3 months after cessation of Kinpeygo), it was markedly increased 
compared to baseline. In the placebo group the BAFF level also was increased over baseline after 12 
months for unknown reasons. Also with the other cytokines tested (BCMA, TACI and APRIL) no 
consistent changes were observed.

The figure and table below show IgA-antibodies against the food proteins casein and gliadin. In case of 
anti-gliadin, the variability was high so that no conclusions can be drawn. Anti-casein was decreased 
vs. baseline and compared to placebo after 9 months with Kinpeygo. Dose-dependency can be seen. 
Three months later (Month 12), there was still a decrease vs. baseline, but at this time point anti-
casein was also decreased in the placebo group to virtually the same extent. The meaning of this 
finding is unclear.

Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP or FABP2) showed a dose- and time-dependent decrease 
from baseline in response to Kinpeygo. The strongest effect was -26.9% compared to placebo and was 
observed after 12 months with 16 mg Kinpeygo. The variability was rather high so that statistical 
significance was not always reached.

Secondary pharmacology 
Following single oral doses of Kinpeygo and Entocort to healthy volunteers (study Nef-101) both 
products suppressed serum cortisol levels compared to baseline.  
An evaluation of the extent of cortisol suppression after repeated dosing with Kinpeygo in IgAN 
patients, based on 24-hour urine cortisol excretion, was studied in Nef-202 and Nef-301.

PD in Patients 
In the Kinpeygo IgAN patient studies the effect of Kinpeygo on urine cortisol suppression following 
repeat dosing was assessed. In both Nef-301 and Nef-202, 24-hour urine cortisol collections were 
analysed by a central laboratory at baseline, after 1 month in Nef-202, and after 3, 6, and 9 months of 
treatment in both studies, and during follow-up after the last treatment dose had been administered.

In Nef-301, 24-hour urine cortisol excretion was suppressed by approximately 70% with Kinpeygo 16 
mg compared to placebo and showed reversibility to baseline levels after 3 months of follow-up.

baseline (SAS) 
In Nef-202, 24-hour urine cortisol excretion was suppressed by approximately 80% and 60% with 
Kinpeygo 16 mg and Kinpeygo 8 mg, respectively, compared to placebo, which remained stable from 
Month 1 throughout treatment. This was followed by a return towards baseline values following 
discontinuation of treatment, which was somewhat slower for the Kinpeygo 16 mg dose compared with 
Kinpeygo 8 mg. Therefore, as would be expected for a budesonide product on repeat dosing, and as 
has also been observed with other oral budesonide products (Entocort SmPC DK 2020 (EN)), there is 
evidence of cortisol suppression after multiple doses of Kinpeygo in patients.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK properties of budesonide have extensively been characterised during the development 
programs for marketed products containing this active substance. The clinical pharmacology programs 
have included studies on PK properties, metabolism and elimination, drug-drug interactions, and the 
PK in subjects with hepatic impairment. Apart from the site of release in the GI tract and the 
concentration-time profile for budesonide in plasma, all other properties for budesonide were expected 
to be similar to Kinpeygo as for other oral budesonide products.  
Kinpeygo PK has only been studied in healthy volunteers following single oral doses. Kinpeygo PK 
results from the healthy volunteer studies are deemed representative for the target population of 
patients with IgAN. As systemic exposure to budesonide is not required for a therapeutic effect of 
Kinpeygo in IgAN, plasma PK parameters are relevant only for assessment of safety related to 
systemic GCS effects. 
Based on Nefecon-F PK data from Study Nef-105, demonstrating a short half-life (~5 hours), it is 
considered unlikely that the Kinpeygo 16 mg repeated dosing regimen would lead to an accumulation 
of budesonide when used in IgAN patients. No accumulation of budesonide has been observed on 
repeated administration of Entocort EC (Edsbäcker and Andersson 200429). The PK of Kinpeygo has not 
been evaluated in IgAN patients. There is no scientific reason to believe that the GI tract of patients 
with IgAN is different from healthy volunteers in terms of release characteristics of budesonide from 
Kinpeygo, rate and extent of absorption, or degree of first-pass metabolism, therefore, Kinpeygo PK 
results from the healthy volunteer studies are deemed representative for patients with IgAN. 
The Kinpeygo formulation is designed to deliver budesonide topically in the ileum. The delayed onset of 
release of budesonide is achieved by a pH-governed polymer coating of the capsules, intended to 
prevent capsule disintegration until it reaches the ileum. Assuming a normal GI transit time, onset of 
Assessment report  
EMA/570757/2022 
Page 38/116 
 
 
 
 
budesonide drug release after 2-3 hours and peak budesonide plasma concentration at around 4-5 
hours for Kinpeygo indicate that the major proportion of the active substance is released in the ileum, 
where Peyer’s patches reside, therefore meeting the requirements for a product intended to act locally 
in this area of the small intestine. 
Bioequivalence studies were carried out to address equivalence for manufacturing changes during the 
development and to justify changes between clinical trials formulation and finished product intended 
for marketing. Following demonstration of Kinpeygo efficacy in the phase 2b Nef-202 study using the 
Nefecon-A formulation, the aim was for subsequent formulations to mimic the PK properties of 
Nefecon-A. Nefecon F (= final commercial product) is the formulation used in the pivotal phase 3 study 
Nef-301 and was assessed versus Nefecon A in the phase 1 healthy volunteer comparative BA/BE 
study Nef-105. The applicant claims bioequivalence between both formulations in terms of AUC and 
Cmax, however, the 90% CIs for Cmax and AUC ranged from 82.8% to 126.3%, overlapping the upper 
boundary for a conventional BE margin. Accordingly, both Nefecon preparations can at best be 
assessed as similar with regard to PK, but not as bioequivalent. However, since Nefecon F formulation 
has been used in the pivotal study, demonstrating efficacy in terms of reduction in proteinuria, with an 
acceptable safety profile, this concern is considered negligible from a clinical perspective; however 
might hamper the pooling of data with results derived from the part 2B study Nef 202, where Nefecon 
A has been used. Another critical point is the observed lower Cmax and AUC obtained from Entocort EC 
compared to Nefecon preparations, even when scaled for the differences in budesonide content. 
However, even though the Cmax and AUC of Nefecon are considerably higher than with Entocort, they 
are still of a similar dimension. Furthermore, safety data did not raise concern for a clinically relevant 
increase of unwanted systemic glucocorticoid side effects in comparison to Entocort. Therefore, the 
transfer of the PK-related instructions for use from Entocort is considered acceptable. 
Budesonide is metabolised by CYP3A4 and transported by MDR1(ABCB1). There is known 
polymorphisms in CYP3A4 (*22) and MDR1. Thus, the applicant has provided available literature on 
possible impact of CYP3A4 and ABCB1 Genotypes on the PKs of budesonide. Data from literature do 
not suggest a pronounced influence. 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with Kinpeygo. The respective section in the 
proposed SmPC is aligned with the SmPC for the oral budesonide product Entocort. This is acceptable 
to the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamics 
By directing release of budesonide to the ileum where the target immune tissues reside in high 
density, a local pharmacological effect is anticipated. The intended action of Kinpeygo is the 
suppression of mucosal B-cells, located in the Peyer’s patches in the ileum, and inhibition of their 
proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells that produce Gd-IgA1. Consequently, it is expected 
that the occurrence of Gd-IgA1 antibodies and formation of immune complexes in the systemic 
circulation will be suppressed, therefore preventing the downstream effects of glomerular mesangial 
deposition of immune complexes containing Gd-IgA1, manifesting as glomerulonephritis and loss of 
renal function. 
The applicant states that the mechanism of action of Nefecon is supported by exploratory analyses of 
patient serum samples from the phase 2b Nef-202 study, where systemic levels of Gd-IgA1 and of IgA-
containing immune complexes were significantly reduced by treatment with Kinpeygo in a dose 
dependent manner.  
The applicant provided the results of all exploratory biomarker measurements that were obtained 
within the phase 2 trial Nef-202. The selection of biomarkers was appropriate. All were described to be

increased in the serum of IgAN patients, and a causal relationship with IgAN pathogenesis is discussed 
(reviewed by Selvaskandan et al. 202036). 
The most pronounced effect was observed for FABP2 which became significantly reduced with Kinpeygo 
over time from baseline in a dose-dependent manner and compared to placebo. The magnitude of the 
effect was comparably high, -21.5% after 9 months and -26.9% after 12 months. Thus, this effect was 
still detectable 3 months after cessation of Kinpeygo administration. 
The IgA-related markers Gd-IgA1 and IgA-IgG complex, revealed a (mostly) statistically significant, 
dose-dependent decrease from baseline and compared to placebo after 9 months, but the decrease 
was no longer present after 12 months. Thus, this effect cannot explain the claimed persistent action 
of Kinpeygo after cessation of treatment. 
The IgA-antibodies against the food protein casein were significantly decreased with high-dose (16 mg) 
Kinpeygo after 9 months but not after 12 months. Intriguingly, the low Kinpeygo dose (8 mg) caused a 
marked and significant increase in anti-casein IgA vs. placebo after 12 months. This is biologically not 
plausible. 
Overall, the most consistent finding was a long-lasting (12 months) decrease in FABP2. This FABP2 
reduction is assumed to correspond to a decreased permeability of the gut mucosa which in turn 
prevents the organism from (potentially IgA-inducing) antigens. 
However, it did not become clear how the decreased permeability of gut mucosa translates to 
beneficial kidney effects since IgA-related markers were not consistently altered. Thus, at present, the 
PD findings cannot support the assumption of a prolonged treatment effect of enteral budesonide. This 
further emphasises the need of obtaining efficacy data on “hard” clinical endpoints (e.g., time to first 
occurrence of a composite of death, ESKD, or a decline exceeding 40% in eGFR). 
The applicant intends to follow the PD markers also in the ongoing phase 3 study (Nef-301). This may 
provide more robust data due to a higher patient number. 
Since dose-related suppressive effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) axis function is 
reported for budesonide in literature, the applicant performed a PD/PK study (Nef-101), that compared 
the effect of single doses of Kinpeygo (8 mg and 16 mg) and Entocort on serum cortisol. The change in 
serum cortisol AUC (0-24) was significantly lower for the 8 mg dose of Nefecon-A than for the 16 mg 
dose (8 mg: -1901 vs, 16 mg: -2401; p=0.003). Of note, adjusted Cmax serum budesonide values in 
study Nef-101 were found to be twice as high for Kinpeygo compared to Entocort.  
In the Kinpeygo IgAN patient studies, the effect of Kinpeygo on urine cortisol suppression following 
repeat dosing was assessed. In Nef-202, 24-hour urine cortisol excretion was suppressed by 
approximately 80% and 60% with Kinpeygo 16 mg and Kinpeygo 8 mg, respectively, compared to 
placebo. Furthermore, recovery from dose-dependent cortisol suppression after the 3-months off-
treatment period was not fully obtained in the 16 mg dose group in contrast to the 8 mg group. Based 
on these results and considering more frequently observed serious adverse events (SAEs) with the 16 
mg dose while demonstrating comparable efficacy with the 8 mg and 16 mg dose, the dose selection 
for the 16 mg daily dose remains unclear. However, it is acknowledged that the 16 mg dose was used 
in the pivotal phase 3 study and therefore this issue was not further pursued. 
Systemic action of budesonide is illustrated by a pronounced suppression of physiological cortisol 
production, with a clear dose dependency from 16 mg to 8 mg to placebo. The 8 mg dose, which is 
used during dose tapering, still shows a pronounced cortisol-suppressing effect. The data presented 
are not considered sufficient to allow abrupt discontinuation of Kinpeygo at the 8 mg dose. Tapering of

glucocorticoids must be done carefully to avoid both recurrent activity of the underlying disease 
(rebound effect) and possible cortisol deficiency resulting from HPA suppression during the period of 
steroid therapy. Budesonide plasma levels are disproportionately increased with the proposed 16 mg 
dose of Kinpeygo as compared to the standard 9 mg dose of Entocort (4-fold for Cmax and 2.5-fold for 
AUC), and the 8 mg tapering dose of Kinpeygo results in similar systemic budesonide exposure as the 
9 mg standard dose of Entocort. Therefore, inclusion of a further tapering step on the 4 mg dose level 
is required. The product information now reflects that when treatment is to be discontinued, the dose 
should be reduced to 8 mg once daily for the last 2 weeks of therapy. This may be followed by an 
additional 2-week period with 4 mg once daily at the discretion of the treating physician. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has exploratively studied several biomarkers in the phase 2 trial Nef-202, but 
mechanistic understanding how exactly oral budesonide could affect IgAN, and in particular why the 
effect of budesonide should persist after cessation of treatment is still incomplete. This is in part due to 
the high variability of the biomarker data. Data from more subjects will come from the ongoing phase 
3 programme.  
2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.4.5.1.  Dose response study 
The applicant conducted a supportive, phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of Kinpeygo (8 mg and 16 mg) in primary IgA 
nephropathy patients at risk of developing ESRD (Nef-202). 
The data demonstrated that Kinpeygo 16 mg per day generally provided better efficacy than Kinpeygo 
8 mg per day when compared with placebo across all renal function parameters evaluated at both 9 
and 12 months, with an acceptable safety profile. Therefore, the Kinpeygo 16 mg per day dose was 
selected for the following phase 3 study (Nef-301) (see section 2.4.5.5. Supportive study). 
2.4.5.2.  Main study

Methods 
The study consisted of 2 parts, Part A and Part B. The Part A study design includes a Screening Period 
(up to 35 days) followed by a 9-month blinded Treatment Period, and a 3-month Follow-up Period 
(including a 2-week Tapering Period).  
Part B consists of a 12-month (+14 to 35 days) observational follow-up period after Part A has ended. 
Each patient randomised will be followed for 25 months after the first dose (or, if the patient 
randomised does not receive any study drug, 25 months after the patient is randomised). The total 
duration of the study is up to 26.5 months (including the screening period and a final visit for replicate 
eGFR sampling at 2 years). The study is blinded throughout. No study drug is administered during Part

angina, class III or IV congestive heart failure, and/or clinically significant arrhythmia, as 
judged by the Investigator; had unacceptable blood pressure control (patients with ≥140 
mmHg systolic blood pressure or ≥90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure were not eligible); had 
known osteoporosis in medium- or high-risk category according to the 2010 American College 
of Rheumatology recommendations; had known glaucoma, known cataract(s), and/or history

randomisation; had been treated with any systemic GCSs within the 12 months before 
randomisation except for a maximum of 3 periods of 2 weeks with the equivalent of 0.5 
mg/kg/day prednisolone or less for non-IgAN indications; or were taking potent inhibitors of 
cytochrome P450 3A4. 
Treatments 
Kinpeygo 16 mg (four 4 mg budesonide modified release capsules QD) or placebo (4 matching 
capsules QD) was administered orally for 9 months during the Treatment Period in Part A. The daily 
dose of double-blinded study drug may have been reduced from 4 capsules QD (Kinpeygo 16 mg or 
placebo) to 2 capsules QD (Kinpeygo 8 mg or placebo) if clinically relevant AEs developed that the 
Investigator considered related to the study drug and that mandated dose reduction. The Medical 
Monitor was preferably to be consulted prior to reducing the daily dose of study drug. If a dose 
reduction was made, then the dose was not to be increased back to 4 capsules QD (Kinpeygo 16 mg or 
placebo). 
After completing 9 months of study treatment, the daily dose of study drug was reduced from 4 
capsules QD (Kinpeygo 16 mg or placebo) to 2 capsules QD (Kinpeygo 8 mg or placebo) for 2 weeks to 
prevent insufficiency of the adrenal glands (Tapering Period in Part A). Patients who had their daily 
dose of study drug reduced to 2 capsules QD (Kinpeygo 8 mg or placebo) due to safety and/or 
tolerability reasons during the Part A Treatment Period remained on this dose of study drug for an 
additional 2 weeks after completing 9 months of study treatment (during the Tapering Period in Part 
A). Patients who prematurely discontinued study treatment while taking 4 capsules QD (Kinpeygo 16 
mg or placebo) were to have the daily dose of study drug reduced to 2 capsules QD (Kinpeygo 8 mg or 
placebo) for 2 weeks, if feasible, to prevent insufficiency of the adrenal glands.

• 
To evaluate additional aspects of renal function, and safety and tolerability of Kinpeygo 16 mg 
treatment over 9 months compared to placebo. 
The secondary objectives of Part B are: 
• 
to assess the effects of the Kinpeygo 16 mg treatment given in Part A on different aspects of 
renal function and safety compared to placebo over 2 years. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Part A 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the Part A analysis was defined as the ratio of UPCR (based on 24 
hour urine collections) at 9 months following the first dose of study drug compared to baseline. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for the Part A analysis were: 
• Ratio of eGFR at 9 and 12 months compared to baseline calculated using the CKD-EPI formula; and 
• Ratio of urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) at 9 months compared to baseline. 
Part B 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the Part B analysis is an area under the curve (AUC)-based 
evaluation of eGFR calculated as a time-weighted average of eGFR recordings observed at each time 
point over 2 years. The eGFR at 2 years (which must be repeated to provide a second value obtained 
within 14 to 35 days) will be the geometric mean of the 2 assessments. An analysis of the 2-year eGFR 
slope will also be performed at this time. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for the Part B analysis are: 
• 
• 
Time to 30% reduction from baseline in eGFR confirmed by a second value, with ≥4 weeks of 
separation between the 2 sampling time points; 
Time from the first dose of study drug until receiving rescue medication; 
•  Ratio of UPCR, UACR, and eGFR compared to baseline averaged over time points between 12 
and 24 months, inclusive, following the first dose of study drug; 
• 
• 
Proportion of patients without microhematuria in at least 2 of the following time points: 12, 18, 
and 24 months following the first dose of study drug (patients defined as without 
microhematuria if the urine dipstick returned a result of negative or trace); 
Proportion of patients receiving rescue treatment; and 
•  SF-36 quality of life assessment at 9 and 24 months. 
Sample size 
The phase 2b study (Nef-202) gave an estimated standard deviation of 0.59 for the change in the log 
of UPCR from baseline after 9 months of treatment. Based on this assumption, 200 patients in Part A 
of Nef-301 would provide >90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at a 1-sided alpha level 
of 0.025 given a true 25% relative reduction in UPCR with Kinpeygo treatment compared to placebo. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking)  
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to Kinpeygo 16 mg or placebo within 35 days of Study Visit 1 
(screening) using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system. The study was double-blinded, 
and randomisation was stratified according to baseline proteinuria (<2 g/24 hours or ≥2 g/24 hours); 
baseline eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2); and geographic region (Europe, North 
Assessment report

America, South America, or Asia Pacific). Randomised patients received either Kinpeygo 16 mg (four 4 
mg budesonide modified release capsules once daily [QD]) or placebo (4 matching capsules QD) for a 
9-month Treatment Period.  
Both Kinpeygo and placebo were provided as modified release capsules. The capsules were carefully 
matched in appearance, smell, and taste to ensure maintenance of treatment masking. Part A was 
blinded, and the blinding was planned to remain in place throughout Part B. The patients, 
investigators, and site staff conducting study procedures, evaluating patients, entering study data, 
and/or evaluating study data were blinded to treatment assignment.  
Statistical methods 
In the study, two populations are defined: 
1. Part A Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes the first 201 patients randomised, regardless of whether the 
patient received study drug.  
2. Safety Analysis Set (SAS) includes all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug up to the 
data cut-off. Therefore, this population includes data from patients who have not yet completed the 9-
month treatment phase. The population comprises 294 patients in total: 150 patients who received 
Kinpeygo 16 mg and 144 patients who received placebo. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the Part A analysis, the ratio of UPCR at 9 months to baseline, was 
log-transformed prior to analysis, as were data from the other time points used in the analysis model. 
The treatment effect was expressed as a percent reduction in UPCR for Kinpeygo compared to placebo 
and was derived from the ratio of geometric least squares (LS) mean baseline ratios estimated at 9 
months for each treatment group. The primary analysis of the log-transformed post-baseline to 
baseline ratios in UPCR was analysed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis based 
on the Part A FAS and incorporating UPCR data from 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Baseline UPCR was 
included as a covariate and was calculated as the geometric mean of the 2 pre-randomisation UPCR 
measurements and log-transformed prior to inclusion in the analysis model. The model also included 
terms for treatment group, visit, log(baseline)-by-visit, and visit-by-treatment group interaction. A 
patient term was included as a random effect. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to model 
the within-patient correlation of data. The Kenward-Roger’s degrees-of-freedom adjustment was used. 
Restricted maximum likelihood was used to obtain parameter estimates. The LS means were estimated 
by visit along with the associated 95% and 96% confidence interval (CI) and p-values with the primary 
analysis taken from the estimate at 9 months. Geometric LS mean values were obtained by 
exponentiating the LS means. Model assumptions of the MMRM were assessed using residual plots 
(such as q-q plots, histograms, box plots, and scatter plots). 
The Part A secondary endpoint analysis of the ratio of eGFR at 9 and 12 months compared to 
baseline was analysed separately using robust regression having multiply imputed any missing data 
first in 3 phases: an imputation, analysis, and pooling phase, as described below. eGFR data were 
log-transformed prior to analysis. 
Robust regression was selected because previous eGFR data from Kinpeygo trials suggested the 
possibility of a small sub-population of patients having extreme outlying data resulting from very 
rapid progression of disease. This method down-weights the contribution of outlying data using a 
pre-defined algorithm.

During the conduct of the study, several protocol amendments were made. Two of those changes 
might be of clinical relevance: (1) the inclusion criterion #2 (diagnosis of IgAN with biopsy verification) 
was changed from “within the past 5 years” to “within the past 10 years;” (16 March 2018) and (2) the 
lower limit of the eGFR value was reduced from 45 to 35 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (2 January 2019).

2.4.5.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Given the comparable study designs, patient populations, study conduct, dosing regimen, and outcome 
measures in Nef-301 Part A and Nef-202, efficacy data were pooled to provide supportive efficacy 
estimates with increased precision compared with that of the individual trials. The final data from Nef-
202, on completion of the study and including all randomised patients, have been used in the pooled 
efficacy analyses to provide the most complete analysis of the data for Kinpeygo 16 mg (N=145) 
compared to placebo (N=152). In order to best describe the cumulative evidence of efficacy, the 
statistical methodology used in Nef-301, that is now considered the optimal approach, has been 
applied consistently to the Nef-202 data prior to pooled analysis. 
In general, prior to any pooling of efficacy data, Nef-202 endpoints were derived and re-analysed to 
correspond to the Nef-301 approach.

Efficacy Results 
Primary endpoint 
UPCR reduction from 9 months to baseline: 
Following rejection of the null hypothesis versus UPCR at the interim, the follow-up of all randomised 
patients continued to 9 months and a full analysis was performed.  
Geometric LSmean UPCR was reduced by approximately 20% from baseline (LSmean: 0.799) for 
Kinpeygo (16+8 mg/day combined) at 9 months based on the estimated back transformed LSmean 
from the model.

Exploratory Nef-201 study 
In addition, the applicant provided results derived from the exploratory study Nef-201, which was an 
open-label, un-controlled proof-of-concept study conducted at three clinical centres.  
A total of 16 patients (10 men and 6 women, aged 29 to 46 years) were included.  
The primary objective was to investigate the effect of Kinpeygo on albumin leakage and the secondary 
objectives were to investigate the effect of Kinpeygo on GFR in patients with IgA nephropathy as well 
as to study the safety of treatment with Kinpeygo. 
The median relative reduction in urinary albumin excretion was -23% at six months of treatment 
(interquartile range: -0.36, -0.04; p=0.04). and -40% (interquartile range: -0.58, -0.15) two months 
after treatment discontinuation. Serum creatinine was reduced by 6% (interquartile range: -0.12, -
0.02; p=0.003), and GFR (MDRD) increased approximately 8% (interquartile range: 0.02, 0.16; 
p=0.003) at six months of treatment.  
These results show that the beneficial outcome on renal function as assessed by urine albumin 
excretion was maintained for at least two months posttreatment and are therefore indicative of a 
disease-modifying effect of Kinpeygo treatment in IgAN patients. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of Kinpeygo was investigated in two clinical studies: the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial Nef-301 
and the supportive phase 2b study Nef-202.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The supportive phase 2b study (Nef-202) was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses (16 vs 8 mg/d) of Kinpeygo in primary IgAN 
patients at risk of developing ESRD. In the final analysis set n = 149 patients were included (n=48 
Kinpeygo 16mg/d; n=51 Kinpeygo 8mg/d; n = 50 placebo). The demographic and disease baseline 
characteristics of all study participants were well balanced, and as primary endpoint of this study, the 
mean reduction in UPCR at 9 months compared to baseline UPCR values has been evaluated 
Assessment report  
EMA/570757/2022 
Page 81/116 
 
 
 
 
 
(measured as a ratio of UPCR at 9 months compared to baseline).  
The pivotal phase 3 study (Nef-301) was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Kinpeygo (16 mg) compared to matching placebo in 
patients with primary IgAN on a background of optimised RAS inhibitor therapy. Only data from Part A 
(1 year treatment) have been submitted. Part B, a 12-month observational follow up period after 
treatment in Part A, is currently ongoing. The study included female and male patients ≥18 years of 
age with biopsy-verified primary IgAN, persistent proteinuria of ≥1 g/d and an eGFR of ≥35 mL/min 
per 1,73m2 and ≤90 ml/min per 1,73m2 using the CKD-EPI formula. The recruited population for the 
phase 3 trial Nef-301 is generally deemed acceptable.  
The Part A FAS included data from 199 patients: 97 patients in the Kinpeygo 16 mg group and 102 
patients in the placebo group. Subjects from the study group have been treated for 9 months with 16 
mg Kinpeygo per day, which corresponds to 4 capsules at 4 mg budesonide. In order to prevent 
adrenal insufficiency, subjects were treated with 8 mg Kinpeygo for 2 weeks, before the observational 
Part B of the study has started. Based on the outcome of a previous Scientific advice, subjects not 
tolerating the full dose of 16 mg/d due to adverse events (AEs) were treated with only 8 mg (2 
capsules) per day and continued after Part A for these 2 weeks also with the dose of 8 mg daily. 
Matching treatment in the placebo group has been performed accordingly. 
In Part A, proteinuria, more specifically the ratio of UPCR (based on 24 hour urine collections) at 9 
months following the first dose of study drug compared to baseline, was used as a single primary 
efficacy endpoint. There was intensive discussion about considering proteinuria as a robust primary 
surrogate endpoint as part of several Scientific Advices, therefore, the applicant followed the 
recommendation of the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/2293/2/2017/PA/SME/III) and additionally provided a 1-
year eGFR slope analysis from Part A as secondary endpoint.  
In Part B of the pivotal trial, the AUC-based evaluation of eGFR over 2 years has been selected as a 
primary efficacy endpoint supplemented by a 2-year eGFR slope analysis. Generally, the rate of eGFR 
decline, or eGFR slope, can be regarded as a valid endpoint and two- and three-year eGFR-based 
endpoints are now being used in all currently recruiting phase 3 studies of immunotherapies in IgAN to 
confirm response to treatment as also described in the literature. 
Statistical methods for efficacy analyses are generally appropriate to estimate the short-term (9/12 
months) effects on UPCR and eGFR. The primary estimand (particularly the hypothetical strategy to 
address rescue medication) and estimation (missing at random assumption) can be questioned but are 
addressed in sensitivity analyses.   
The 1-year eGFR was estimated via a robust regression model, which seems difficult to interpret and is 
seen critical due to possible down-weighting of subjects with “extreme” changes. The applicant was 
thus asked to estimate the 1-year changes from baseline using an MMRM model as for the primary 
endpoint considering an appropriate estimand and missing data handling. The evidence provided by 
the applicant on the adequacy of UPCR as a surrogate endpoint for renal function is generally 
considered appropriate, but the prediction of clinically relevant (long-term) outcomes reflecting renal 
change is seen critical due to the unclear treatment concept and uncertainties associated with the 
short-term treatment effect estimates (see further discussions on long-term clinical benefit). 
During the conduct of the study, several protocol amendments were made. Two of those changes 
might be of clinical relevance, which allowed for the recruitment of sicker patients. The applicant 
responded that the adjustment in biopsy verification requirements and the inclusion of patients with 
lower baseline eGFR have not had a bearing on the overall results, and had these criteria been in place 
from the beginning of the study the results would remain unaltered. The pre-defined treatment period 
of 9 months is applicable to all patients in the trial, including those with more advanced disease.

Whether any particular subgroups of patients may benefit from an extended treatment period cannot 
be answered from the Nef-301 trial. This acceptable and it is not considered that this would have an 
impact on the integrity of the data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Supportive phase 2b study (Nef-202) 
Upon 9 months treatment with Kinpeygo (16+8 mg/d, combined data) the UPCR was reduced 
approximately by 20% from baseline (LSmean 0.799; 8 mg/d: LSmean 0.847; 16 mg/d: 0.746) and 
additional minor decrease could be observed within the 3 months follow-up-phase (9 to 12 months) 
without further treatment. However, while the inclusion of a tapering phase during the 9 months of 
treatment within Part A allowing for dose reduction from 16 to 8 mg/d in case of arising safety issues 
is fully acknowledged, only borderline differences between the 16 mg/d and 8mg/d dosing regimen 
could be observed in any of the markers analysed. In a Scientific Advice, the selection of the dose of 
16 mg for the pivotal clinical trial has been seen critical due to the lack of evidence provided by some 
interim analyses. However, it is acknowledged that the 16 mg dose has been used for the pivotal 
phase 3 trial, and since dose reduction was rare in the pivotal study and AEs were generally 
manageable, it was agreed not to include any guidance for dose reduction in the Kinpeygo SmPC.  
Pivotal phase 3 study (Nef-301) 
The efficacy data from Part A show that the ratio of UPCR at 9 months to baseline was 0.69 in the 
Kinpeygo treatment arm and 0.95 in the placebo arm (CI 95%). This means a reduction of proteinuria 
(UPCR) of 31 % for Kinpeygo and 5 % for placebo during a treatment course of 9 months. The ratio of 
geometric LS means comparing Kinpeygo/placebo was 0.73 (27%, p 0.0003). The reduction of 
proteinuria could be observed already at earlier stages after starting the treatment (ratio geometric 
means comparing Kinpeygo/placebo 0.99 at 3 months and 0.86 at 6 months) but was more 
pronounced at 12 months showing a ratio of 0.52 (p < 0.0001). Reliability of these data derived from 
the primary MMRM analysis (Part A FAS) was strongly supported by supplementary and sensitivity 
analysis, indicating the robustness of the 9-month treatment effect on UPCR.  
The secondary efficacy analysis was about to determine (1) the ratio of eGFR at 9 and 12 months 
compared to baseline as well as (2) the ratio of UACR at 9 months compared to baseline. The ratio of 
geometric mean eGFR at 9 months compared to baseline showed a change of the eGFR of 0% in the 
Kinpeygo arm and a -7% change in the placebo arm. Comparing Kinpeygo versus placebo revealed a 
ratio of mean eGFR of 1.07 (= 7% more reduction of eGFR in the placebo arm). In contrast to 
proteinuria (primary endpoint), this effect was not pronounced after 12 months, which is not surprising 
because 1 year treatment/observation phase, especially under continues RAS treatment, is probably 
too short to see any effect at the level of eGFR. Additionally, the ratio of UACR at 9 months compared 
to baseline has been evaluated using MMRM analysis for Part A data. This ratio was 0.64 (= 36 % 
reduction) for the Kinpeygo arm and 0.93 (= 7% reduction) for the placebo arm following a very 
similar kinetics (3 -12 months) as shown for UPCR ratios (primary endpoint). Correspondingly, also the 
number of patients without microhematuria was higher at 9 months compared to baseline in the 
Kinpeygo treatment arm (Kinpeygo: from 38.1 to 63.9% versus placebo: from 31.4 to 37.3%). 
While acknowledging the robustness of the 9-month treatment effect on UPCR, it was unclear why the 
treatment difference gets even larger at 12 month and why the phase 3 results are not consistent with 
those observed in the phase 2 study (Nef-202). The (mean) eGRF values differ even more between 
studies. There is a peculiar (mean) increase of eGRF after 3 months treatment in Nef-301, and 
thereafter the eGFR decrease appears to be similar in the two arms. In the Nef-202 study the (mean) 
decrease in both arms appears linear and the slopes differ. These data raised questions about the 
ability of the drug to slow the rate of loss of kidney function and have a meaningful effect on

progression to kidney failure. The applicant was asked to discuss the observed increase of eGFR at 3 
months in study Nef-301 and respective differences to the phase 2 data. 
According to the applicant the observed increase of eGFR at 3 months in Nef-301 is considered most 
likely due to a direct anti-inflammatory effect on the kidney, as a consequence of low-level systemic 
exposure to budesonide.  
The applicant further pointed out that eGFR deteriorates more rapidly in patients with higher baseline 
levels of proteinuria and that the early acute increase in eGFR observed in the overall Nef-301 
population is reflected in a stabilisation of eGFR with Kinpeygo treatment relative to the more 
immediate deterioration of eGFR for placebo-treated patients with high baseline proteinuria.  
Regarding the difference in the eGFR curves between Nef-301 and Nef-202 the applicant argued, that 
a lower rate of eGFR decline in the placebo arm of Nef-301 (compared to Nef-202) for patients with 
UPCR<1.5 g/gram may have contributed to the difference between studies. The applicant´s discussion 
can be followed and is acknowledged. 
Since the applicant initially claimed approval of budesonide in a rather broad population of patients 
with IgAN, the applicant was requested to submit additional data to substantiate the use in a broad 
target population. In response, the applicant submitted additional pre-specified subgroup analyses of 
treatment effects on UPCR at 9 months and eGFR up to 1 year for the subgroups of patients with UPCR 
<1.5 g/g versus ≥1.5 g/g at baseline. UPCR sub-category (defined by <1.5 g/g versus ≥1.5 g/g) were 
consistent with the primary efficacy findings. In the subgroup analyses of UPCR at 9 months, there was 
no differential treatment effect on UPCR at 9 months according to baseline proteinuria or UPCR, in 
either the individual trials or the pooled analysis (Nef-202 and Nef-301). However, there was a 
statistically significant interaction for the eGFR treatment effect at 9 months according to baseline 
UPCR (p=0.0046) and baseline total proteinuria (p=0.0012) in the pooled analysis (Nef 202, Nef 301). 
The eGFR treatment effect was larger in patients with higher baseline levels of proteinuria, with similar 
patterns observed in the individual trials. The additional data provided for Kinpeygo in patients with a 
UPCR ≥1.5 g/g (a pre-specified subgroup) suggest evidence of relevant clinical benefit in terms of 
slowing the chronic rate of loss of renal function (eGFR), in patients with higher levels of UPCR at 
baseline. This subgroup was also noted to be at particular risk of rapid disease progression over a 
relatively short time period.  
The applicant argued that in patients with lower levels of proteinuria at baseline, where significant 
improvement in proteinuria is observed later in the treatment course (at 9 and 12 months), increasing 
separation of the eGFR curves has not yet had time to occur. The applicant’s statement is 
acknowledged; however, this will need to be demonstrated when corresponding data are available 
from the ongoing phase 3 study (Nef-301). 
Overall, uncertainties regarding the interpretability of the eGFR data persist in spite of additional 
analyses provided. The applicant’s confidence that the eGFR curves will continue to separate after 
treatment discontinuation is not yet shared. As stated by the applicant, there is no significant 
difference in treatment effect in terms of eGFR in the overall study population 
Given the limited data on the efficacy and safety currently available for Kinpeygo, the CHMP suggested 
that the indicated population should be restricted to patients with UPCR ≥ 1.5 g/gram until further data 
are available for a broader patient population. Thus, a cut-off value for proteinuria was proposed in 
section 4.1 of the SmPC, i.e. a UPCR ≥ 1.5 g/gram. 
Within the day 180 responses the applicant agreed to restrict the Kinpeygo indication at the time of 
this CMA but proposed a lower cut-off value with a UPCR ≥1.3 g/g. The argumentation put forward by 
the applicant was that the Kinpeygo treatment effect on the rate of loss of renal function estimated by 
the difference in 1-year chronic slope (from 3 months onwards) first becomes statistically significant at 
Assessment report  
EMA/570757/2022 
Page 84/116 
 
 
 
a baseline UPCR threshold of 1.3 g/gram. The applicant further stated that the pre-specified level of 
1.5g/gram was chosen arbitrarily and should therefore not be considered as a meaningful cut-off 
value. This is not considered a valid argument. The arbitrary selection of a threshold does not render it 
meaningless in the context of a confirmatory trial setting. Only patients with a baseline proteinuria of 
>1.5g/gram were a pre-specified subpopulation that showed a statistically significant treatment effect 
over placebo in eGFR. Therefore, this is the only cut-off value that could be considered for the 
restriction of the target population.  
The CHMP recommended to restrict the indication to the treatment of primary IgAN in adults at risk of 
rapid disease progression with a UPCR ≥1.5 g/gram. This was accepted by the applicant. 
Long term clinical benefit/Treatment concept 
Overall, epidemiologic data indicate a strong and consistent relationship between the level and 
duration of proteinuria and loss of kidney function in patients with IgAN. However, since there are 
knowledge gaps regarding the minimal magnitude and duration of proteinuria reduction that confers to 
a protective effect, the applicant was asked to further justify the relevance of the clinical results. It is 
generally agreed with the applicant that the data provided so far from the Kinpeygo trials demonstrate 
statistically significant and clinically relevant treatment benefits for UPCR/UACR and, partly, for eGFR, 
which distinguishes the Kinpeygo results from STOP-IgAN trial that failed to show any treatment effect 
on eGFR (Lennartz DP et al.37). 
It is acknowledged that the evidence presented suggest a high probability that UPCR could be 
considered a viable candidate for surrogacy in regard to long term clinical benefit. In addition, it is 
appreciated that the applicant has pointed out possible issues with the assumption of proportional 
hazard over the duration of the follow up period. However, there is only limited evidence that this is 
the case.  
If this assumption does not hold, the estimates of the median time to clinical outcome cannot be 
considered reliable. So, while the modelling document provided in the initial MAA as well as the 
additional reasoning provided by the applicant is seen as favourable evidence for the efficacy of 
Kinpeygo, the suggested effect size of 35.0 years (95% CI 19.2 to 71.6 years) is not seen as 
sufficiently robust to support such a claim. From a regulatory perspective, UPCR is still not a validated 
endpoint for renal outcome and a positive benefit risk assessment cannot be made on the basis of a 
robust UPCR effect at 9 or 12 months alone. In fact, there is little evidence of renal benefit for the pre-
specified subgroup of patients with lower levels of baseline proteinuria (cut-off value of <1.5 g/gram) 
based on the eGFR values. Thus, uncertainties regarding the interpretability of the surrogacy endpoint 
UPCR still persist.  
Since it is assumed that based on the pathophysiology of IgAN and due to the fluctuations in disease 
severity, life-long treatment cycles with Kinpeygo might be required, and major concerns were raised 
about the intended treatment concept of Kinpeygo. Especially because in the pivotal phase 3 study 
(Nef-301), a single 9-months treatment period (Part A) was used, but no limitation in the length of 
treatment was initially proposed in section 4.2 of the SmPC. In its response the applicant clarified that 
Kinpeygo should be seen as a treatment that can potentially delay disease progression rather than 
cure patients and suggested specifying the duration of a treatment cycle, 9 months, in section 4.2 of 
the SmPC. This proposal is deemed acceptable. Treatment duration of 9 months at a 16 mg once daily 
dose is supported by the pivotal phase 3 study (Nef-301 Part A) and the phase 2b study Nef 202.  
Dual RAS blockade

of Nephrology. 2020 Dec;33(6):1231-1239.

In both studies Nef-301 and 202, patients were on optimised ACEI and/or ARB therapy prior to 
randomisation and throughout the treatment and follow-up periods. Of note, in study Nef-202, 22% 
received both an ACEI and an ARB. In study Nef-301, a considerably smaller subset was on dual RAS 
blocking therapy: 3 patients (3.1%) in the budesonide group and 7 patients (6.9%) in the placebo 
group. It is known that inhibition of the RAS system leads to reduction in blood pressure and reduces 
proteinuria in IgAN. However, evidence from clinical trials showed that dual RAS blockade is associated 
with adverse drug reactions like severe hypotension, hyperkaliaemia and renal failure (e. g. ONTARGET 
study38). In addition, a post-hoc analysis of the STOP-IgAN trial which investigated single versus dual 
RAS blockade on renal endpoints in IgAN showed higher proteinuria with dual blockade over the 3-year 
trial (Lennartz DP et al37). Hence, recent KDIGO guidelines do not support dual blockade and 
recommend therapy with either an ACEi or ARB “Recommendation 2.3.2. We recommend that all 
patients with proteinuria >0.5 g/d, irrespective of whether they have hypertension, be treated with 
either an ACEi or ARB”.  
Analyses submitted by the applicant investigating the small subgroup of patients in studies Nef-202 
and Nef-301 who received dual blockade (ACEI plus ARB) did not hint at a worse benefit/risk profile 
compared to the overall study population. However, as evidence from literature indicates that dual RAS 
blockade is associated with adverse drug reactions like severe hypotension, hyperkaliaemia and renal 
failure, the applicant committed to provide a sensitivity analysis excluding patients who received 
background therapy with both an ACEI and an ARB with the results of the ongoing phase 3 study (Nef-
301). As the latest KDIGO recommendations do not recommend dual blockade, it is expected that in 
the future no patients will be treated with both an ACEI and an ARB. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
Conditional approval is sought on the basis of proteinuria reduction, measured by UPCR, supported by 
1-year eGFR data from the Part A of the pivotal phase 3 Nef-301 study. 
As the basis for a proposed full approval the primary objective of Part B of the Nef-301 study is to 
assess the effect of Kinpeygo 16 mg on the clinical consequences of proteinuria reduction, as 
measured by eGFR recorded over 2 years compared to placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint for the 
Part B analysis is a time-weighted average of eGFR recordings observed at each time point over 2 
years (AUC(0-2)). 
Additional analyses investigating the relationship of clinical outcome (e.g. time to first occurrence of a 
composite of death, ESKD, or a decline exceeding 40% in eGFR) and eGFR slope are expected for 
conversion of the conditional into a full Marketing Authorisation. In addition, the requested subgroup 
analysis excluding patients who received background therapy with both an ACEI and an ARB is 
expected to provide a cleared picture on renal clinical outcome events. 
Therefore, in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of budesonide for the treatment of primary IgAN 
and more particularly to assess the clinical consequences of proteinuria reduction, as measured by 
eGFR, the applicant will submit the results (including also a composite clinical outcome and sensitivity 
analysis according to background therapy) of Part B of study Nef-301, a phase 3, randomised, double-
blind, multicentre study comparing budesonide to placebo in patients with primary IgAN on a 
background of optimised RAS inhibitor therapy. This specific obligation is reflected in Annex II of the 
product information.

2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
While the primary endpoint UPCR is statistically significant in the overall study population, there is little 
evidence of renal benefit for the pre-specified subgroup of patients with lower levels of baseline 
proteinuria (cut-off value of <1.5 g/gram) based on the eGFR values provided. Therefore, a restriction 
of the target population in section 4.1 to patients with higher levels of baseline proteinuria (cut-off 
value of ≥1.5 g/gram) is recommended. 
2.4.8.  Clinical safety 
2.4.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The safety analysis set consists of 294 patients of which 150 have been treated with 
Kinpeygo and 144 with placebo with a cut-off date of 5th October 2020. The trial Nef-202 
also contributes to the safety profile of Kinpeygo, where patients were treated with 8/16mg 
of Kinpeygo or placebo. The study included 3 phases: a 6-month run in phase, a 9-month 
treatment phase and a 3-month follow-up phase which included an initial 2-week tapering 
period. Besides these two main studies, several pharmacology studies were performed with 
healthy volunteers. 
In the pivotal Nef-301, two populations are defined: 
1. FAS Part A included the first 201 patients randomised, regardless of whether the patient received 
study drug (the primary population for evaluation of Part A efficacy). For the purposes of safety 
analyses in this population for the summary of clinical safety, only patients who received at least one 
dose of study treatment are included, with all safety summaries presented by treatment received. Only 
these patients will have had the opportunity to have received the intended 9 months of therapy.  
2. SAS included all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug up to the data cut-off. Therefore, 
this population includes data from patients who have not yet completed the 9-month treatment phase. 
The population comprises 294 patients in total: 150 patients who received Kinpeygo 16 mg and 144 
patients who received placebo.

16 mg (48.5%) than with placebo (24.0%), in the Part A FAS. Similar frequencies were observed in 
the SAS (43.3% versus 18.8% for the Kinpeygo and placebo treatment groups, respectively). The 
most common TEAEs considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possibility of being

Adverse events of special interest 
The following, which are established potentially clinically significant consequences of steroid treatment, 
were considered adverse event of special interest (AESIs) in Nef-301 study:  
• Severe infection requiring hospitalisation; 
• New onset of diabetes mellitus;  
• Confirmed fracture; 
• New osteonecrosis;  
• Gastrointestinal bleeding that requires hospitalisation; 
• Reported occurrence of cataract formation, and  
• Reported onset of glaucoma. 
Glucocorticosteroids are also known to increase the risk of adverse gastrointestinal effects, such as 
gastritis, ulcer formation, and gastrointestinal bleeding (Messer et al 1983). As Kinpeygo directs the 
release of the active substance budesonide to the ileum, GI AEs were also evaluated across the patient 
studies.

2.4.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Clinical chemistry 
In the patient studies, there were no clinically relevant changes in median values of any clinical 
chemistry parameters observed over time between Kinpeygo and placebo. Any dose-related trends 
observed between Kinpeygo 16 mg and Kinpeygo 8 mg, relative to placebo were not considered 
clinically relevant. 
In Nef-301, there were no clinically relevant changes from baseline levels in liver enzymes ALT or GGT; 
median levels remained stable during treatment and follow-up. Numerical increases from baseline in 
bilirubin, together with modest decreases in ALP, AST, albumin and total protein observed with 
Kinpeygo treatment were not considered clinically relevant and resolved after the end of the treatment 
period. 
Numerical increases in median LDH, calcium, sodium, and phosphate levels and a small decline in 
median creatine kinase observed during Kinpeygo treatment were not considered clinically relevant 
and returned to baseline levels after the end of the treatment period. 
Hematology 
There were no clinically relevant changes in median values in any hematology parameters observed 
over time between Kinpeygo and placebo. 
In Nef-301, small, predictable increases in white cell counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, and a small, 
expected decrease in eosinophils were observed during Kinpeygo treatment, which returned to baseline 
levels after the end of treatment. These non-clinically significant changes in white cell counts and other 
hematological parameters are an expected effect related to GCS use and were also observed in Nef-
202. 
The Nef-301 study allowed patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus to be included if the 
condition was adequately controlled (defined as HbA1c ≤8% [64 mmol/mol]), whereas no patients 
with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus were allowed in the Nef-202 study. A markedly higher 
percentage of patients in the Kinpeygo 16 mg group of Nef-301 had a medical history of diabetes 
compared to the placebo group (9 patients [9.3%] versus 1 patient [1.0%] respectively in the Part A 
FAS; and 13 patients [8.7%] versus 5 patients [3.5%] respectively in the SAS. 
In addition, more Kinpeygo-treated patients had pre-diabetic levels of HbA1c ≥ 5.7% or FBG≥100 
mg/dL at baseline, as compared to placebo-treated patients (46% and 32% respectively). At a group 
level, a small numerical increase in median HbA1c levels was observed during Kinpeygo treatment, 
with some outliers also evident in the Kinpeygo treatment group.

2.4.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
As for other oral budesonide products (e.g., Entocort), Kinpeygo should be used with caution in 
patients with infections, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, glaucoma, or 
cataracts; or with a family history of diabetes or glaucoma; or with any other condition where the use 
of GCSs may have unwanted effects. Impaired liver function may reduce the rate of elimination of 
GCSs, resulting in higher systemic exposure. The Kinpeygo patient studies excluded patients with 
hepatic cirrhosis because of the risk of increased systemic exposure to budesonide. 
The pooled SAS was used for this evaluation of subgroups to maximize the number of events for 
analysis. A threshold incidence ≥10% in the Kinpeygo 16 mg treatment group with a 2-fold increase in 
rate over placebo was applied, which resulted in an evaluation of subgroups for the TEAEs of 
hypertension, edema peripheral, and acne. Subgroup summaries were produced where there were at 
least 20 patients exposed to Kinpeygo 16 mg. No safety concerns have been identified within any 
particular subgroups of intrinsic or extrinsic factors.

No immunological events were reported. However, a high local steroid exposure of the gut could 
potentially affect immunological gastrointestinal functions.

2.4.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No clinically relevant effect of food on the overall systemic exposure of budesonide was observed when 
either a moderate or high fat meal was consumed 1 hour after a single Kinpeygo 16 mg dose, or when 
a moderate fat meal was consumed 2 hours prior to dosing. 
No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been performed with Kinpeygo. Budesonide, the active 
pharmacological ingredient of Kinpeygo, is metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Drugs that 
induce CYP3A4 such as carbamazepine may lower plasma budesonide concentrations. Potent inhibitors 
of CYP3A4, including grapefruit juice, can increase plasma levels of budesonide. Thus, clinically 
relevant drug interactions with potent CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, 
indinavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, and cyclosporine are to be expected, and may increase systemic 
budesonide concentrations. 
The use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors was prohibited in the Kinpeygo phase 2 and 3 patient studies, and 
patients were also instructed to avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice. Given its low affinity for CYP3A4 
and low systemic exposure, budesonide is unlikely to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs after oral 
administration.

2.4.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database consists of data from the pivotal phase 3 clinical study (Nef-301) and the 
supportive phase 2 study (Nef-202). In the pivotal study Nef-301, 294 patients were randomised 1:1 
to treatment with 16 mg budesonide (150 patients), or placebo (140 patients). In the supportive Nef-
202 study, 153 patients were randomised at 1:1:1 ratios (16 mg budesonide, 8 mg budesonide, or 
placebo). 
The safety data based on Nef-301 consist of 2 parts i) FAS Part A with the first 201 randomised 
patients (superseded by the 9-Month Safety Cohort in the updated safety data report D120 SU data 
cut-off, in which all patients included received the full 9 months treatment; 134 – Kinpeygo, and 132 – 
Placebo) and ii) a SAS including further patients already randomised for Part B (n= 374). The phase 3 
SAS includes all available safety data from all visits in all 374 patients who had received at least one 
dose of study drug by the time of the data cut-off (cut-off 15 March 2021) and therefore includes some 
patients who have not yet completed the 9-month treatment phase. As part of the day 90 responses, 
updated safety information from study Nef-301 was provided. Overall, the provided data demonstrated 
an acceptable safety profile.   
The patient populations between the pivotal Nef-301 and supportive study Nef-201 vary in their 
baseline characteristics, with patients in the Nef-301 trials suffering from more advanced disease while 
also taking concomitant medication. None of the baseline characteristics appeared to be correlating 
with an increased risk factor to develop certain AEs. Thus, the pooled data are considered acceptable 
to assess the safety profile for Kinpeygo. 
The study population included in Nef-301 is considered representative for the intended target 
population and thus suitable to assess budesonide safety in the intended indication. Reliable 
conclusions on safety with regard to special populations are not possible, since the size of the study 
population is quite limited, which results in very small subgroups. For example, no meaningful 
conclusions can be drawn for patients aged >65 (n=10). The small size of the exposed population also 
favours confounding effects caused by baseline imbalances. For example, an analysis of glucocorticoid-
related AEs in the subgroups of patients with baseline UPCR below or above 1.5 g/gram is hampered 
by the fact that a greater proportion of patients with UPCR<1.5 g/gram was included in Nef-202 as 
compared to Nef-301 and that glucocorticosteroid-related AEs were probably over-reported in Nef-202 
in contrast to Nef-301 (AEs solicited using a questionnaire in Nef-202). The sparse safety data 
submitted (exposure below 300-600 patients as recommended in CPMP/ICH/375/95) might be partially 
compensated by the fact, that budesonide is a long-established medical drug. Furthermore, there may 
be yet unknown safety-related issues associated with its special pharmacokinetics and its use in a 
highly special target population. These will be monitored in post-marketing surveillance via periodic 
safety updates reports (PSURs) and in the ongoing phase 3 study (Nef-301). 
Concomitant medication is very common in patients with IgA nephropathy. Other than ARBs and 
ACEIs, part of the background RAS inhibitor therapy for both studies, the overall most common classes 
of concomitant medications were HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, dihydropyridine derivatives, and 
preparations inhibiting uric acid production – none were found to be associated with any of the 
observed TEAE. The median blood pressure was only transiently increased by budesonide. No drug-
drug interaction studies have been performed with Kinpeygo. Considering that budesonide is a well-
known substance and the respective section in the Kinpeygo SmPC is aligned with the SmPC for the 
oral budesonide product Entocort, this is considered acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/570757/2022

Budesonide is metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) – hence all drugs that induce or inhibit 
CYP3A4 affect the plasma concentration. Nevertheless, because of the delayed release mode of action, 
the systemic exposure should be significantly lower than when budesonide is administered 
systemically. Instead, the capsules pass through the GI tract to deliver its constituents mainly locally in 
the Ileum. The applicant has alleviated concerns regarding the influence of medication that can affect 
gastric pH. 
The incidence of TEAEs was balanced between the treatment arms – 85.8% in patients treated with 
budesonide compared to 69.7% in the placebo group. The most common TEAEs compared to placebo 
across both studies ranging from 10-20% of affected patients were hypertension, muscle spasms, 
edema peripheral, and acne – all known side effects from budesonide treatment.  
Updated safety data demonstrated that in patients with BMI≥30 kg/m2, 11 (12.9%) Kinpeygo-treated 
patients reported TEAEs of hypertension compared to none in the placebo-treated patients. The 
applicant has provided a discussion whether a warning for increased rate of hypertension in patients 
that have a BMI≥30 kg/m2 in section 4.4 should be included. The main counterargument was that 
there is no statistical difference between hypertension occurrence in BMI≥30 kg/m2 and BMI≤30 kg/m2 
for Kinpeygo and placebo-treated patients. It is considered that the statistical test used lacks the 
power to rule out that hypertension is increased in BMI≥30 kg/m2 patients. However, since 
hypertension is already included in 4.8 of the SmPC, this issue is not pursued further. 
Regarding body weight, the changes in mean body weight are not considered clinically relevant. 
Several outliers with body weight increase of ≥ 10 kg specifically occurred in the Kinpeygo group, but 
not with placebo. This weight gain was probably caused by increased appetite, edema and fluid 
retention as an effect of budesonide and/or a consequence of the underlying kidney disease. It is 
somewhat re-assuring that the incidence of severe infections requiring hospitalisation was not 
increased in the budesonide group, but on the other hand, the study population may not have been 
large enough to detect such events. However, the frequency of non-serious, specifically bacterial, 
infections appears to be numerically increased. Thus, the increased risk of infections is mentioned in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC, where adverse drug reactions typical of systemic glucocorticosteroids are 
listed. In analogy to the corresponding section of the SmPC of the reference product Entocort, this list 
has been extended by further examples of potential glucocorticoid-related AEs. 
Rates of serious TEAEs are low and distributed equally across treatment groups, 10.4% in the 
budesonide group versus 5.3% in placebo. Most serious TEAEs occurred once in single patients, with 
the exception of pulmonary embolism (2 events). In general, thromboembolic events are an issue as 
these are known to be associated with glucocorticoid therapy and occurred 5 times (3x deep vein/ 
venous thrombosis and 2x pulmonary embolism) during the Nef-301 and Nef-202 studies. The 
assessment of these events is complicated by risk factors and concomitant medications. The applicant 
also discussed the relationship between thromboembolic events and (locally delivered) budesonide and 
concluded based on literature and low systemic exposure that an inclusion in the SmPC is not needed. 
The applicant will closely monitor these events in upcoming periodic safety update single assessment 
(PSUSA) procedures and review the literature. There have been two deaths reported in the Kinpeygo 
treatment group; one was a fatal coronavirus infection that occurred during the “on treatment” phase 
and one was a cerebral haemorrhage that occurred during follow-up. Neither was considered by the 
investigator to be potentially related to study treatment. In addition, no immunological events were 
reported. However, a high local steroid exposure of the gut could potentially affect immunological 
gastrointestinal functions. Updated analysis and medical data review of the data by the applicant 
showed this is likely not the case.  
During the clinical development program, 24 patients that received the highest dose of Kinpeygo (16 
mg) were discontinued, 6 discontinued patients received the 8 mg dose, and 6 patients were on

placebo. All TEAEs that were the cause of study discontinuation occurred also in other patients and all 
TEAEs were expected from the safety profile of budesonide.  
Routine pharmacovigilance activities will include the collection, assessment and processing of individual 
case safety reports (ICSRs) and ongoing safety surveillance and periodic signal detection. In order to 
gain further post-authorisation exposure data on use of budesonide during pregnancy and/or lactation, 
a targeted specific adverse reactions questionnaire has been included in the risk management plan 
(RMP) for the risk “use in pregnancy and lactation”. In addition, pregnancy cases occurring in the post 
marketing setting should be collected and presented in the periodic safety update reports (PSUSRs) 
accordingly.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.4.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of Kinpeygo has been well characterised in the clinical development program and is 
in line with the known safety profile of already approved budesonide medicinal products. The most 
common adverse drug reactions were mainly of mild or moderate severity and reversible, reflecting the 
low systemic exposure to budesonide after oral administration.

2.5.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan  
The pharmacovigilance plan consists of routine pharmacovigilance activities including the collection, 
assessment and processing of individual case safety reports, an ongoing safety surveillance and 
periodic signal detection. Further, the following routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse 
reactions reporting and signal detection will address the missing information ‘use in pregnancy and 
lactation’: 
- Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaire: Targeted Pregnancy/ Breast-feeding follow-up 
questionnaire. The purpose of the targeted questionnaire is to closely follow-up events in pregnant/ 
breast-feeding women as well as the foetus/ born child and/or breast-fed child including but not limited 
to spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality of patient 
exposed to Kinpeygo during pregnancy and breast-feeding as well as any complications occurring in 
the foetus, the born child and/ or breast-fed child of patients exposed to Kinpeygo.  
- Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities: Cumulative review of case reports on the use of 
Kinpeygo in pregnancy and lactation, which will be included in the PSUR 
There will be no additional pharmacovigilance activities.

2.6.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.6.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.6.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Based on the fact that IgAN is a new indication for budesonide and will be authorised under a 
conditional marketing authorisation awaiting confirmatory efficacy results from part B of the pivotal 
study Nef-301, the PRAC is of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for Kinpeygo is 
needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for budesonide. The requirements for submission 
of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the 
CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request the alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international 
birth date (IBD). The IBD is 15 December 2021. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Kinpeygo (budesonide) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation (Reg Art 14-a).  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Kinpyego (budesonide) is intended for the treatment of primary IgAN in adults at risk of rapid disease 
progression with a UPCR ≥1.5 g/gram, based on the request of the CHMP to restrict the previously 
claimed broader indication. 
IgAN, sometimes referred to as Berger’s disease, is a serious, immune complex-mediated autoimmune 
kidney disease, that is the most prevalent primary chronic glomerulonephritis worldwide.  
Glomerulonephritis is an inflammatory condition affecting the glomeruli, characterised by 
intraglomerular inflammation and cellular proliferation associated with haematuria. The hallmark of 
which is the predominance of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1) deposits, either alone or with IgG, 
IgA, or both, in the glomerular mesangium. The disease can be classified into primary or secondary 
forms. In the primary form, there are no relevant associated co-morbidities, whereas in the secondary 
form, the condition may be diagnosed in patients with non-renal diseases, ranging from chronic liver 
disease and inflammatory states to chronic infections and neoplasms.  
It is a life-threatening condition that is chronically debilitating due to progressive loss of kidney 
function that results in reduced quality of life and shortened life expectancy. 
IgA nephropathy is an orphan disease that is estimated to affect approximately 200,000 people in the 
EU (including the United Kingdom), and approximately 130,000 people in the United States (National 
Organization for Rare Disorders [NORD]). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently no treatments approved for the management of patients with primary IgAN. 
Supportive treatment recommendations have been provided in the KDIGO 2021 guideline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/570757/2022 
Page 106/116 
 
 
 
Standard of care comprises of supportive therapy, which focuses on a lowering the proteinuria and 
optimal blood pressure control by maximum tolerated inhibition of the RAS, together with a low sodium 
diet (KDIGO 2021, Trimarchi et al 2019). For patients with persistent proteinuria >1 g/day, rigorous 
blood pressure control with ACEIs and/or ARBs [RAS inhibitor therapy] to achieve blood pressure 
targets of <130/80 mm Hg is the cornerstone of therapy.  
When proteinuria persists despite the optimal RAS inhibition with ACEIs/ARBs, patients are at risk of 
progression to ESRD, there are no further recommended treatments, and management options are 
generally limited to consideration of an off-label 6-month treatment course of high-dose systemic 
glucocorticosteroid.  
Additional immunosuppressants beyond glucocorticosteroid, such as cyclophosphamide, are suggested 
for specific situations only, for example in cases of crescentic IgAN where renal function is rapidly 
deteriorating.  Notably, the KDIGO 2021 guideline suggests that mycophenolate mofetil should not be 
used in IgAN patients due to heterogeneity of outcomes and potential side effects. 
Considering the lack of approved therapies, the severe side effects associated with systemic 
glucocorticosteroid use, and the possibility of progression to ESRD, dialysis and transplantation, there 
is an unmet medical need for an efficacious and safe treatment, especially for patients with persistent 
proteinuria despite optimized RAS inhibition. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy is based on pivotal data from Part A of the phase 3, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study of Kinpeygo 16 mg (N=97) once daily compared with placebo (N=102) 
in patients with primary IgAN on a background of optimized RAS inhibitor therapy (Nef-301). 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the Part A analysis was defined as the ratio of UPCR (based on 24 
hour urine collections) at 9 months following the first dose of study drug compared to baseline. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for the Part A analysis were ratio of eGFR at 9 and 12 months 
compared to baseline calculated using the CKD-EPI formula and ratio of UACR at 9 months compared 
to baseline. 
Additional efficacy data were provided from the supportive phase 2b randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study (Nef-202). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy results in the pivotal phase 3 study (Part A) (Nef-301) 
•  After 9 months of treatment, patients treated with Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily showed a 27% 
reduction in UPCR (primary endpoint) compared to placebo (96% CI 12% to 39%; p=0.0003).  
•  After 12 months (after 3 months of treatment withdrawal and observational follow up) patients 
treated with Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily showed a 48% reduction in UPCR compared to placebo 
(p<0.0001).  
• 
The ratio of UPCR at 9 months was 0.69 in the Kinpeygo treatment arm and 0.95 in the 
placebo arm (CI 95%). This means a reduction of proteinuria (UPCR) from baseline by 31% in 
patients treated with Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily compared with 5% in placebo-treated 
patients. The ratio of geometric LS means comparing Kinpeygo/placebo was 0.73 (27%, p 
0.0003), showing that the primary endpoint in Part A was met. 
Assessment report  
EMA/570757/2022 
Page 107/116 
 
 
 
• 
The reduction of proteinuria could be observed already at earlier stages after starting the 
treatment (ratio geometric means comparing Kinpeygo/placebo 0.99 at 3 months and 0.86 at 
6 months) but was more pronounced at 12 months showing a ratio of 0.52 (p < 0.0001). 
Reliability of these data derived from the primary MMRM analysis (Part A FAS) was strongly 
supported by supplementary and sensitivity analysis, indicating the robustness of the 9-month 
treatment effect on UPCR. 
• 
Improvements in UPCR due to Kinpeygo treatment were found to occur earlier in patients with 
higher levels of UPCR at baseline (≥1.5 g/gram; significant already after 6 months), compared 
to patients with lower levels of UPCR at baseline (<1.5 g/gram; significant reduction of UPCR 
evident only after 9 months). 
•  After 9 months of treatment, Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily provided a 7% treatment benefit on 
eGFR (secondary endpoint) compared to placebo (p=0.0014). This 3.87 mL/min/1.73 m2 
treatment benefit at 9 months corresponded to a reduction from baseline of 0.17 mL/min/1.73 
m2 in patients who received Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily and a deterioration from baseline of 
4.04 mL/min/1.73 m2 in patients who received placebo. 
• 
In the subgroup of patients with baseline UPCR ≥1.5 g/g, eGFR declined by 10.1 mL/min/1.73 
m2 over 12 months in the placebo group of Nef-301. In comparison, eGFR declined by only 1.1 
mL/min/1.73 m2 in the Kinpeygo treatment group, resulting in a difference of 8.98 
mL/min/1.73 m2 at 12 months. 
•  Additional eGFR slope data were evaluated from 3 months onwards up to the currently 
available 12-month time-point and analysed according to different baseline UPCR cut-offs from 
1.0 to 2.0 g/gram. The Kinpeygo treatment effect, in comparison to placebo, on the rate of loss 
of renal function (eGFR chronic slope) gradually increases and becomes statistically significant 
at a baseline UPCR cut-off of 1.3 g/gram, and then appears to plateau at an average of 6 to 
6.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year from UPCR≥1.4 g/gram, suggesting a relevant clinical benefit for 
Kinpeygo in terms of slowing the chronic rate of loss of renal function in patients with a UPCR 
≥1.5 g/g at baseline (a pre-specified subgroup). This subgroup was also noted to be at 
particular risk of rapid disease progression over a relatively short time-period and had a 
considerable unmet medical need. 
Efficacy results in the supportive Phase 2b study (Nef-202) 
•  After 9 months of treatment, patients treated with Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily showed a 26% 
reduction in UPCR compared to placebo (p=0.0051).  
•  After 9 months of treatment, Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily provided a 12% (7.63 mL/min/1.73 
m2) treatment benefit on eGFR (p=0.0026), compared to placebo. This corresponded to a 
stabilisation of eGFR (minor increase of 0.44 mL/min/1.73 m2 from baseline) in patients who 
received Kinpeygo 16 mg once daily and a deterioration from baseline of 7.19 mL/min/1.73 m2 
in patients who received placebo.  
In the pooled dataset comparing Kinpeygo 16 mg/day with placebo, the UPCR treatment effect was 
consistent across subgroups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
•  UPCR as surrogate endpoint of renal function is not considered fully validated and 
representative on its own for benefits in clinical outcome. Therefore, the benefit-risk 
assessment also included measures of eGFR values to evaluate Kinpeygo’s effect on renal 
Assessment report  
EMA/570757/2022 
Page 108/116 
 
 
 
function. Long term effects will be further assessed with the results of the ongoing phase 3 
study (Nef-301). 
• 
• 
The rate of loss of renal function (eGFR chronic slope) does not reach statistical significance in 
the overall study population and in subgroups with baseline UPCR levels <1.3 g/gram. 
Therefore, the indication was restricted to patients at risk of rapid disease progression with a 
UPCR ≥1.5 g/gram. 
Inconsistencies between the Nef-301 and Nef-202 trials in regard to eGFR curves were 
observed: There is a peculiar (mean) increase of eGFR after 3 months treatment in Nef-301, 
and thereafter the eGFR decrease appears to be similar in the two arms suggesting that there 
is no difference between the two arms in the rate of loss of kidney function from month 3 
through 12. In the Nef-202 study the (mean) decrease in both arms appears linear and the 
slopes differ. These data raised questions about the ability of the drug to slow the rate of loss 
of kidney function and have a meaningful effect on progression to kidney failure. However, 
these uncertainties have been addressed for now for a subgroup of patients with higher levels 
of baseline proteinuria in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation application 
• 
There were also uncertainties with respect to the relationship between the results of the 
surrogate endpoints and clinical outcome (e.g. time to first occurrence of a composite of death, 
ESKD, or a decline exceeding 40% in eGFR) which could not be resolved by the modelling data 
provided due to methodological concerns. However, despite these uncertainties an acceptable 
positive benefit/risk was concluded. In addition, these concerns will be addressed with the 
results of the ongoing phase 3 study (Nef-301). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
• 
• 
• 
The frequency of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug in Nef-301 study was 13 
(9.7%) in Kinpeygo 16 mg-treated patients vs. 2.3% in the placebo group, with 6 Kinpeygo-
treated patients undergoing dose reduction. In total, 13.1% of patients discontinued due to 
TEAEs versus 3.3% in the placebo group. 
The incidence of TEAEs was balanced between the treatment arms – 85.8% in patients treated 
with budesonide compared to 69.7% in the placebo group.  
The most common TEAEs compared to placebo across both studies (Nef 202, Nef-301) ranging 
from 10-20% of affected patients were muscle spasms, muscle spasms, hypertension, edema 
peripheral, and acne – all known side effects from budesonide treatment. 
•  Rates of serious TEAEs were low in Part A of study Nef-301 (10.4% in the budesonide group 
versus 5.3% in placebo). 
• 
Two deaths have been reported across the clinical development program, both in the Kinpeygo 
treated patients. Both were reported as not related to the treatment (corona infection and a 
case of cerebral haemorrhage during follow up 300+ days after last dose). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
•  Reliable conclusions on safety with regard to special populations are not possible, since the size 
of the study population is quite limited, which results in very small subgroups. For example, no 
meaningful conclusions can be drawn for patients aged >65 (n=10).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects 
The primary endpoint of the pivotal study, reduction of proteinuria (UPCR) at 9 months compared to 
baseline, was met. The reduction of proteinuria could be observed already at earlier stages after 
starting the treatment (at 3 months and 6 months) but was more pronounced at 12 months. Reliability 
of these data derived from the primary MMRM analysis (Part A FAS) was strongly supported by 
supplementary and sensitivity analysis, indicating the robustness of the 9-month treatment effect on 
UPCR.  
The key secondary endpoint analyses of renal function based on eGFR at 9 months showed a 
statistically significant and clinically relevant 7 % treatment benefit compared to placebo. In contrast 
to proteinuria (primary endpoint), this effect was not pronounced after 12 months, which is not 
surprising because 1 year treatment/observation phase, especially under continuous RAS treatment, is 
too short to see any effect at the level of eGFR.  
Additional analyses indicated that the difference in 1-year eGFR chronic slope between Kinpeygo and 
placebo first became statistically significant at a UPCR threshold of 1.3 g/gram, suggesting a relevant 
clinical benefit for Kinpeygo in terms of slowing the chronic rate of loss of renal function in patients 
with a UPCR ≥1.5 g/g at baseline (a pre-specified subgroup). This subgroup was also noted to be at 
particular risk of rapid disease progression over a relatively short time-period and had a considerable 
unmet medical need. However, there was no significant difference in eGFR chronic slope in the overall 
study population. 
Treatment duration of 9 months at a 16 mg once daily dose is supported by the pivotal phase 3 study 
(Nef-301 Part A) and the phase 2b study (Nef 202). Nevertheless, IgAN is a chronic autoimmune 
disease and repetition of treatment cycles may become necessary. Part B of the Nef-301 study and the 
open-label extension study (phase 3b Nef-301) will provide additional information on duration of 
efficacy and relapse for both single and repeated 9-months treatment cycles (see Annex II).  
Importance of unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Kinpeygo has been well characterised in the clinical development program and is 
in line with the known safety profile of already approved budesonide medicinal products. The most 
commonly reported adverse drug reactions were acne reported in approximately 10% of patients, 
hypertension, peripheral oedema, face oedema, and dyspepsia, each occurring in approximately 5% of 
patients; these were mainly of mild or moderate severity and reversible, reflecting the low systemic 
exposure to budesonide after oral administration. Overall, the data demonstrated an acceptable safety 
profile consistent with the known active ingredient. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the conduct of two double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials in an orphan disease with an 
acceptable large number of patients at intermediate to high-risk for disease progression is positively 
recognised. Treatment was generally well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with the known 
active ingredient.

The evidence provided by the applicant on the adequacy of UPCR as a surrogate endpoint for renal 
function is generally considered appropriate.  
However, in addition to the UPCR measures, the benefit-risk assessment needs to include measured 
eGFR values to evaluate Kinpeygo’s effect on renal function. While the primary endpoint UPCR is 
statistically significant in the overall study population, there is little evidence of renal benefit in terms 
of slowing the decline of renal function as measured by eGFR for the pre-specified subgroup of patients 
with lower levels of baseline proteinuria (cut-off value of <1.5 g/gram) based on the eGFR values 
provided.  
Therefore, the limitation of approval to the subgroup with higher levels of proteinuria appears justified 
for the following reasons. First, the primary endpoint reduction in UPCR has shown robust and 
statistically significant results in both the broad population and the pre-specified subgroup with UPCR ≥
1.5 g/gram at baseline. Second, the secondary endpoint on eGFR slope, necessary to support the 
clinical relevance of the surrogate primary endpoint on proteinuria, has revealed a convincing outcome 
only in the proposed subgroup, but not in the overall patient population. Third, the earlier reduction of 
UPCR in the pre-defined subgroup, which is reflected in a significantly delayed decline in eGFR over 1 
year when compared with placebo, provides a plausible rationale for the effect in the subgroup. 
Therefore, the indication is restricted to patients with higher levels of baseline proteinuria (cut-off 
value of ≥ 1.5 g/gram). The efficacy of Kinpeygo for the treatment of primary IgAN and more 
particularly the clinical consequences of proteinuria reduction, as measured by eGFR, will be confirmed 
with the results of Part B of study Nef 301 (see Annex II). 
The safety profile of Kinpeygo has been well characterised in the clinical development program and is 
in line with the known safety profile of already approved budesonide medicinal products. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available yet, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease. In 
addition, the product is designated as an orphan medicinal product.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed in section 3.7.2.  
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data on safety and efficacy 
through the phase 3 study (Nef-301).  
Data of eGFR slope were provided for UPCR cut-offs from ≥1.0 to 2.0 g/gram at baseline. These 
analyses indicate that the difference in 1-year eGFR chronic slope between Kinpeygo and placebo first 
becomes statistically significant at a UPCR threshold of 1.3 g/gram, suggesting a relevant clinical 
benefit for Kinpeygo in terms of slowing the chronic rate of loss of renal function in patients with a 
UPCR ≥1.5 g/g at baseline (a pre-specified subgroup). This subgroup was also noted to be at particular 
risk of rapid disease progression over a relatively short time-period and had a considerable unmet 
medical need. Clinical benefit in this patient population is considered likely to be confirmed at the time 
of the final analysis of the phase 3 study (Nef-301). 
Assessment report  
EMA/570757/2022 
Page 114/116 
 
 
 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as  
There are no treatments approved for the management of patients with primary IgIAN. Patients with 
baseline UPCR ≥1.3 g/gram are at risk of rapid disease progression to ESRD over a short period of 
time and represent a group of patients for whom the unmet medical need is considerable. Without 
treatment, an eGFR deterioration of 9.36 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year would be expected (1-year eGFR 
slope in the placebo group of the phase 3 trial), and as a result these patients are at significant risk of 
requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation in the near term.  
Although long term data are currently missing on whether the effects on proteinuria and eGFR are 
sustained over a longer time period and despite some uncertainties regarding the claimed locally acting 
targeted-release effect on the Peyer´s Patch, it is considered that the product will fulfil an unmet 
medical need in the approved indication for the treatment of primary IgAN in adults at risk of rapid 
disease progression with a UPCR ≥1.5 g/gram.  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. 
Considering the lack of approved therapies, the serious side effects associated with the use of 
systemically acting GCSs and the high likelihood of progression to ESRD, dialysis and transplantation, 
there is a high unmet medical need for an efficacious and safe treatment for IgAN, to prevent or 
reduce further deterioration in renal function, thereby preserving residual functionality and avoiding 
progression to ESRD. 
Efficacy of Kinpeygo has been demonstrated in a subgroup of patients with higher level of proteinuria. 
The profile safety of Kinpeygo containing a well-known active substance, budesonide, is considered 
acceptable. Long-term efficacy and safety will be addressed in the study Nef-301. 
In light of the above, it is agreed, that the benefits to public health of the immediate availability of the 
medicinal product outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Kinpeygo is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Kinpeygo is favourable in the following indication: 
Kinpeygo is indicated for the treatment of primary immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) in 
adults at risk of rapid disease progression with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥1.5 g/gram.

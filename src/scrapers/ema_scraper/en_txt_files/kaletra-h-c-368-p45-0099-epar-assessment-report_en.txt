INTRODUCTION 
As a reminder, Kaletra is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age of 2 years, in 
combination with other antiretroviral agents. 
Kaletra oral solution 80/20 mg/mL and Kaletra soft gel capsule 133.3/33.3 mg were approved in March 2001. A new 
formulation, Kaletra 200/50 mg tablet, was approved in June 2006. Finally, a lower dose lopinavir/ritonavir 100/25 mg 
paediatric tablet formulation received favourable CHMP opinion in January 2008.  
The  oral  solution  is  the  recommended  lopinavir/ritonavir  formulation  for  use  in  small  children  allowing  maximal 
flexibility  and  accuracy  of  dosing.    The  recommended  dose,  based  on  body  surface  area,  is  230/57.5  mg/m2  twice 
daily  taken  with  food,  up  to  a  maximum  dose  of  400/100  mg  twice  daily.  The  recommended  dose  for  the 
lopinavir/ritonavir 100/25 mg paediatric tablet is 2 to 4 tablets twice daily based on weight (range 15 to 40 kg). 
In  response  to  Article  45  of  the  Paediatric  Regulation,  a  line  listing  of  lopinavir/ritonavir  paediatric  studies  not 
previously submitted by Abbott was submitted to the EMEA (listed in table 1). 
In addition, a literature search was conducted to find studies not previously submitted by Abbott. Two studies were 
found to be relevant in the literature search (listed in table 2). Other studies that did not add significant clinical context 
and did not adequately support clinical information were excluded (e.g. case reports, studies with a small sample size, 
and studies with insufficient data). 
Moreover,  the  MAH  submitted  the  reports  for  two  completed  paediatric  studies  for  Kaletra  (M99-046  and 
R&D/04/110), in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products 
for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  studies  do  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for  Kaletra  and  that 
there is no consequential regulatory action.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Non-clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted a report for study TA98-022: 
Four-Week Oral Toxicity Study of Abbott-157378 in Combination with Ritonavir (Abbott-84538) in Immature (Juvenile) 
Rats 
Rapporteur’s comment:  
A 4 weeks study in juvenile rat had been submitted at the time of the initial MA application for KALETRA. It is unclear 
whether  study  TA98-022  corresponds  to  another  study  and,  in  the  later  case  to  what  extent  this  study  provides 
additional insight as regards the juvenile toxicity. 
The MAH should clarify.

Safety:  8.9% subjects 
with SAE.  Most common 
were pneumonia, fever, 
pancreatitis, and anemia. 
No safety signals not 
previously identified were 
noted in this study. 
Kaletra is already approved for the 
treatment of children aged 2 years 
and above at the dose of 
230/57.5mg/m2 twice daily. The 
indication was supported by study 
M98-940, an open-label study 
conducted in 100 antiretroviral 
naïve (44%) and experienced 
(56%) paediatric patients (aged 6 
months to 12 years). 
Of note, among the 14 254 subjects 
enrolled in the EAP, the paediatric 
population is confined to only 85 
patients and these patients are 12-
<18 years old. 
In agreement with the MAH, EAP 
cannot be used for assessing 
efficacy. Preliminary safety data 
from the first 1290 subjects 
included in this EAP study was 
provided at the time of MA. When 
reviewing the whole safety data 
from the EAP study, no apparent 
deviation from the known safety 
profile of KALETRA is observed. 
Therefore, no SPC change is 
requested on the basis of this 
study.

procedure to explore the possibility

to extend the indication for 
KALETRA to children less than 2

medical need, all PK data available 
on this topic, including data from 
publication provided in response to 
article 45, will be discussed in the 
setting of this FUM (see KALETRA 
FUM 093). 
Insofar that the once daily regimen 
is currently under assessment in 
adults and has raised major 
objections, any discussion on once 
daily regimen in children appears 
premature at this stage.

N/A 
Safety: No clinically 
relevant differences in 
AEs between treatment 
groups. Treatment 
emergent AEs related to 
underlying HIV disease. 
Efficacy: Virologic and 
immunologic response 
sustained through the 
first 48 weeks of 
treatment with 
lopinavir/ritonavir, 
nelfinavir, and ritonavir 
regardless of the line of 
PI therapy and in 
second-line PI use.  
44 patients (mean age:10.6 y-o; 
range:1-20) had received 
Kaletra in this Phase IV study. 
This observational cohort study 
was based on the Switzerland 
registry database and included 
subjects who received PI of 
interest from March 1996 to 
October 2003.  
Given that VIRACEPT and 
NORVIR (used as an 
antiretroviral agent) are quite 
marginalized in the therapeutic 
management of patients, 
comparisons made in this study 
are of poor relevance nowadays. 
24 weeks  PK: Plasma drug 
concentrations of all 
three drugs were at the 
higher limits of 
expected ranges for 
adult treatment at 
approved dosages.   
Safety: Well tolerated. 
One child with grade 3 
diarrhea possibly 
related. 
Efficacy: 60% with 
viral load < 50 
Whereas the prominent issue for 
paediatric patients is to 
substantiate the use of KALETRA 
in children below 2 years of age 
to answer a medical need in this 
population, no children below 2 
years of age were included in 
this study.  
Furthermore, dual boosted PIs 
become disputable concept, 
especially given the existing 
alternatives.

Results/Conclusions 
Rapporteur’s comment 
48 weeks  Safety: Side effects were 
transient except for 
dyslipidemia. No sign of 
lipodystrophy. Therapy was 
well tolerated.  
Efficacy: 57.1% (4/7) 
children with viral load <50 
copies/ml.  One child lost to 
follow up. 
Apart from the interest of the 
concept of the NNRTI sparing 
regimen which nevertheless 
remains to be validated in 
adults, this study cannot be 
reliably interpreted given the 
small number of patients 
included (n=8) 
24 weeks  PK: High interindividual 
variability and low 
concentrations in some 
patients were observed. 
Authors suggest that 
therapeutic drug monitoring 
may be useful in children. 
Safety: No significant 
adverse events were 
recorded during the 3 days 
of switch to once daily 
lopinavir/ritonavir. 
No children below 2 years of 
age were included in this 
study. 
Insofar that the once daily 
regimen is currently under 
assessment in adults and has 
raised major objections (see 
ongoing procedure Kaletra 
II67 to allow OAD 
administration in naïve adult 
and adolescent patients)., any 
discussion on once daily 
regimen in children appears 
premature at this stage. 
No measures are mandatory 
on the basis of this study at 
this stage.

Signs of lipodystrophy were 
noted in 28.6% of children in 
this 6 years retrospective

consistent with the prevalence 
of lipodystrophy reported in 
HIV-infected children in other 
studies. Furthermore, as a 
known risk factor, stavudine 
was the most prevalent NRTI 
at baseline in this cohort. 
No children below 2 years of 
age were included in this 
study. 
According to the authors, because of the 
unique epidemiology of pediatric HIV 
infection in Romania, children and 
adolescents who were treated with 
lopinavir/ritonavir-containing HAART were 
relatively old (mean age: 13 years), and 
most had acquired the infection 
horizontally, questioning the 
extrapolation of the study 
findings to vertically infected 
children. 
Of note, 37 deaths were observed; most of 
them occurred among children with 
advanced HIV disease at the time HAART

A specific cause of death was 
reported in half of the cases. 
Causes of death included tuberculosis (8 
cases), progressive encephalopathy (4 
cases), cytomegalovirus disease (3 cases), 
and pneumonia (2 cases). 
The mortality rate was 3.3 per 100 
patient-years during the first half of 
the study period (Nov 01 
through Dec 03) and was 1.2 per 
100 patient-years during the second half 
(Jan 04-Aug 06).  Although high, 
the mortality rate reported in 
this study seems compatible 
with the mortality rate of 
children with evidence of

Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion AND RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
Kaletra  is  currently  already  approved  for  the  treatment  of  children  aged  2  years  and  above  at  the  dose  of 
230/57.5mg/m2 twice daily. The indication was supported by study  M98-940, an open-label  study conducted in 100 
antiretroviral naïve (44%) and experienced (56%) paediatric patients (aged 6 months to 12 years). 
Whereas the prominent issue for paediatric patients is to substantiate the use of KALETRA in children below 2 years 
of  age  to  answer  a  medical  need  in  this  population,  a  very  limited  number  of  children  below  2  years  of  age  were 
included in studies provided in response to article 45 of the Paediatric Regulation.  
Furthermore,  insofar  that  there  is  an  ongoing  procedure  to  explore  the  possibility  to  extend  the  indication  for 
KALETRA  to  children  less  than  2  years  of  age,  all  PK  data  available  on  this  topic,  including  data  from  publications 
provided in the current procedure, will be discussed in the setting of this FUM (see KALETRA FUM 093). 
Overall, no new clinically relevant efficacy data were provided in the studies submitted. Most of the studies pertain to 
the efficacy of KALETRA in (heavily) treatment-experienced children, a population which is targeted by the approved 
therapeutic indications of KALETRA. 
Most  publications  are  old  publications  (only  5  published  after  2005).  Some  referred  to  outdated  strategies  (dual 
boosted  Protease  Inhibitors)  or  to  the  use  of  KALETRA  once  daily.  The  use  of  KALETRA  once  daily  in  children 
appears  a  premature  at  this  stage  insofar  that  this  OAD  regimen  is  currently  under  assessment  in  adults  and  has 
raised major objections. 
Finally, no apparent departure from the known safety profile of KALETRA was observed in the study provided.  
Overall, no SPC changes are deemed necessary on the basis of the studies provided in response to article 45 of the 
Paediatric Regulation.  
However, the MAH provided a non-clinical study report relative to juvenile toxicity (study TA98-022) without discussing 
the impact of this study as regards the already available data on this topic. Therefore, the MAH should clarify to what 
extent study TA98-022 provides additional insight as regards the juvenile toxicity of KALETRA. 
  Recommendation  
  Fulfilled –  
  Not fulfilled: 
The MAH should clarify to what extent study TA98-022 provides additional insight as regards the juvenile toxicity of 
KALETRA. 
ADDITIONAL  CLARIFICATIONS  REQUESTED 
The MAH should clarify to what extent study TA98-022 provides additional insight as regards the juvenile toxicity. 
A 30 day response timetable without clock stop will apply. 
In  response  to  Article  45  of  the  Paediatric  Regulation,  a  line  listing  of  lopinavir/ritonavir  paediatric  studies  not 
previously submitted by Abbott was submitted to the EMEA (listed in table 1). 
In addition, a literature search was conducted to find studies not previously submitted by Abbott. Two studies were 
found to be relevant in the literature search (listed in table 2). Other studies that did not add significant clinical context 
and did not adequately support clinical information were excluded (e.g. case reports, studies with a small sample size, 
and studies with insufficient data). 
Moreover,  the  MAH  submitted  the  reports  for  two  completed  paediatric  studies  for  Kaletra  (M99-046  and 
R&D/04/110), in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products 
for paediatric use.

Assessment of Applicant’s responses to RSI 
The applicant’s response to the RSI was as follows: 
“Study TA98-022 was included as it was data that had not been submitted to the EMEA and as it was juvenile toxicity 
study, the study could be considered relative to the article 45 initiative. However, TA98-022 provides no new data that 
would indicate a change in the risk/benefit profile of lopinavir/ritonavir or warrant a change in the labelling.” 
Rapporteur’s comment:  
The submission of study TA98-022 as a stand-alone non-clinical report is not acceptable. The applicant is requested 
to provide an expert’s critical discussion regarding this report to justify the assumption that no new data emerged from 
this study that would change the risk/benefit of Kaletra or warrant a change in product information. 
In  response  to  Article  45  of  the  Paediatric  Regulation,  a  line  listing  of  lopinavir/ritonavir  paediatric  studies  not 
previously submitted by Abbott was submitted to the EMEA (listed in table 1). 
In addition, a literature search was conducted to find studies not previously submitted by Abbott. Two studies were 
found to be relevant in the literature search (listed in table 2). Other studies that did not add significant clinical context 
and did not adequately support clinical information were excluded (e.g. case reports, studies with a small sample size, 
and studies with insufficient data). 
Moreover,  the  MAH  submitted  the  reports  for  two  completed  paediatric  studies  for  Kaletra  (M99-046  and 
R&D/04/110), in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products 
for paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  studies  do  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for  Kaletra  and  that 
there is no consequential regulatory action. 
The conclusions of CHMP following first tour assessment (outcome fax on 24 April 2009) were as follows: 
“Overall, no new clinically relevant efficacy data were provided in the studies submitted. Most of the studies pertain to 
the efficacy of KALETRA in (heavily) treatment-experienced children, a population which is targeted by the approved 
therapeutic indications of KALETRA. 
Most  publications  are  old  publications  (only  5  published  after  2005).  Some  referred  to  outdated  strategies  (dual

In response to the RSI 1 the applicant stated that: 
“Study TA98-022 was included as it was data that had not been submitted to the EMEA and as it was juvenile toxicity 
study, the study could be considered relative to the article 45 initiative. However, TA98-022 provides no new data that 
would indicate a change in the risk/benefit profile of lopinavir/ritonavir or warrant a change in the labelling.” 
However, the CHMP considered that the submission of study TA98-022 as a stand-alone non-clinical report was not 
acceptable.  The  applicant  was  requested  (RSI2)  to  provide  an  expert’s  critical  discussion  regarding  this  report  to 
justify  the  assumption  that  no  new  data  emerged  from  this  study  that  would  change  the  risk/benefit  of  Kaletra  or 
warrant a change in product information. 
Assessment of Applicant’s responses to RSI 2 
The applicant’s response to the RSI2 was as follows: 
In the 4-week juvenile toxicity study in rats that was dosed at 0/0, 10/5, 30/15 or 100/50 mg/kg lopinavir/ritonavir, there 
were no treatment-related deaths, changes in behaviour or physical condition of the animals. Body weight and food 
consumption  were  decreased  at  the  highest  dosage.  Microscopic  changes  included  centrilobular  hepatocytomegaly 
and  thyroid  follicular  cell  hypertrophy  and/or  hyperplasia  at  the  mid  and  high-dosages.  The  hepatocytomegally  was 
associated  with  increases in serum  ALT  and  liver  weights and  was  suggestive  of  an induction  response  for  hepatic 
glucuronosyl  transferase.  The  thyroid  changes  may  have  been  secondary  to  hepatic  enzyme  induction.  Since  the 
mild liver and thyroid changes at 30/15 mg/kg/day were not accompanied by relevant alternations in clinical 
chemistry parameters or decrements in body weight and food consumption, this dosage was considered to 
the be No-observed adverse- effect level (NOAEL). 
The target organ changes observed in the liver and thyroid of this study are generally similar to those previously 
observed in adult rats administered the drug combination at the same dosages. Plasma exposures to lopinavir and 
ritonavir  were  similar  or  greater  in  juvenile  animals  compared  to  what  has  been  achieved  in  adults  indicating  that 
juvenile  animals  do  not  have  an  increased  sensitivity  to  the  adverse  effects  associated  with  the  combination  of 
lopinavir/ritonavir. Overall, the findings in juvenile rats treated with lopinavir/ritonavir are not unexpected and 
do not represent either a new finding or a more severe manifestation of what has been well characterized in 
adult rats. 
Rapporteur’s comment:  
As  requested,  the  Applicant  has  submitted  a  brief  summary  of  results  for  study  TA98-022  and  concludes  that  “the 
findings in juvenile rats treated with lopinavir/ritonavir are not unexpected and do not represent either a new finding or 
a more severe manifestation of what has been well characterized in adult rats”.  
However, the Applicant did not clarify in his response to what extent this study differs to the one previously submitted 
in support to the paediatric indication.  
There  are  similarities  between  characteristics  of  study  mentioned  in  EPAR,  CHMP  initial  assessment  report  for  MA 
and  TA98-022 study:  age  of  the  juvenile  rat,  duration  of  administration  of  lopinavir/ritonavir,  maximum  administered 
dose. Indeed TA98-022 could have been submitted for MMA process for the report of this study was finalised in 1998.  
However, there is a discrepancy concerning NOAEL which is estimated to be 10/5 mg/kg/day  in CHMP documents 
and which is estimated to be 30/15 mg/kg/day in TA98-022 report. 
Following  an  e-mail  request  of  the  Afssaps/PTL  to  clarify  to  what  extent  this  study  differs  to  the  one  previously 
submitted  in  support  to  the  paediatric  indication,  the  Applicant  confirmed,  by  mail  dated  8th  October  2010,  that  “the 
study submitted with the MA application and the Study TA98 022 submitted in response to Article 45 was indeed the 
same” and that it was mistakenly re-submitted through the Article 45 procedure. 
Taking into account  
- the previous opinion of CHMP that “no SPC changes are deemed necessary on the basis of the studies provided in 
response to article 45 of the Paediatric Regulation” 
- the data provided by the Applicant and especially the Applicant’s mail dated 08/10/10,  
it could be considered that follow-up measure (FUM) KALETRA P45 099.2 is fulfilled.   
However,  as  part  of  a  separate  new  FUM,  the  Applicant  should  confirm  officially  that  study  TA98  022  submitted  in 
response to Article 45 was indeed the same that study submitted in the Marketing Authorisation Application and that it 
was mistakenly re-submitted through the Article 45 procedure. Moreover, the Applicant should explain the discrepancy

Overall Conclusion: 
It could be considered that follow-up measure (FUM) KALETRA P45 099.2 is fulfilled.   
However, as part of a separate new FUM to be answered within one month, the Applicant should officially confirm that 
study  TA98  022  submitted  in  response  to  Article  45  was  indeed  the  same  as  the  study  submitted  in  the  Marketing 
Application and that it was mistakenly re-submitted through the Article 45 procedure. Moreover, the Applicant should 
explain the discrepancy concerning NOAEL which is estimated to be 10/5 mg/kg/day in CHMP documents and which 
is estimated to be 30/15 mg/kg/day in TA98-022 report.

Addendum to Assessment report P45 099  
On 23 July 2009 the MAH received positive opinion for a once daily dosing 
regimen of Kaletra tablets for antiretroviral treatment in naïve adult patients 
and on 18 February 2010 for a once daily dosing regimen of Kaletra tablets 
for experienced antiretroviral treatment adult patients. 
In addition, subsequent to the date of the assessment report, the MAH 
fulfilled the requests identified on page 17 of the report (i.e., the request 
that the MAH confirm that study TA98 022 was the same study submitted in 
the original Marketing Application and addressed the apparent discrepancy 
concerning NOAL values).

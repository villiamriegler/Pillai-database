Renal and hepatic impairment 
Although the safety and efficacy of hydroxocobalamin have not been studied in renal and hepatic 
impairments, Cyanokit is administered as emergency therapy in an acute, life-threatening situation 
only and no dose adjustment is required in these patients. 
Method of administration 
Initial dose of Cyanokit is administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. 
The rate of intravenous infusion for the second dose ranges from 15 minutes (for patients extremely 
unstable) to 2 hours based on patient condition. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
None. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Treatment of cyanide poisoning must include immediate attention to airway patency, adequacy of 
oxygenation and hydration, cardiovascular support, and management of seizures. Consideration must 
be given to decontamination measures based on the route of exposure. 
Cyanokit does not substitute oxygen therapy and must not delay the set up of the above measures. 
The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely 
available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of 
clinical history and/or signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication.  
Cyanide poisoning may result from exposure to smoke from closed space fires, inhalation, ingestion, 
or dermal exposure. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogens, 
including cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, or prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside. 
Signs and symptoms of cyanide poisoning 
Common signs and symptoms of cyanide poisoning include: nausea, vomiting, headache, altered 
mental status (e.g. confusion, disorientation), chest tightness, dyspnoea, tachypnoea or hyperpnoea 
(early), bradypnoea or apnoea (late), hypertension (early) or hypotension (late), cardiovascular 
collapse, seizures or coma, mydriasis, and plasma lactate concentration > 8 mmol/L. 
In the setting of multiple casualties such as terrorism or chemical disaster, panic symptoms including 
tachypnoea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental 
status (confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning.

Smoke inhalation 
Not all smoke inhalation victims necessarily will have cyanide poisoning, but may present with burns, 
trauma, and exposure to additional toxic substances aggravating the clinical picture. Before Cyanokit 
is administered, it is recommended to check affected persons for the presence of the following: 
 
 
 
exposure to fire smoke in an enclosed area 
soot present around mouth, nose and/or oropharynx 
altered mental status 
In this setting hypotension and/or a plasma lactate concentration ≥ 10 mmol/L (higher than the one 
mentioned under signs and symptoms due to the fact that carbon monoxide contributes to lactic 
acidaemia) are highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning. In the presence of the above signs, treatment 
with Cyanokit must not be delayed to obtain a plasma lactate concentration. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Known hypersensitivity to hydroxocobalamin or vitamin B12 must be taken into benefit-risk 
consideration before administration of Cyanokit, since hypersensitive reactions may occur in patients 
receiving hydroxocobalamin (see section 4.8). 
Renal disorders  
Oxalate crystals have been observed in the urine of healthy volunteers given hydroxocobalamin. 
Cases of acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, renal impairment and urine calcium oxalate 
crystals present have been reported in patients treated with hydroxocobalamin following known or 
suspected cyanide poisoning. In some situations, hemodialysis  was required to achieve recovery  (see 
section 4.8). 
Therefore, as a precaution, after Cyanokit administration, regular monitoring of renal function 
(including blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine) should be performed until 7 days after drug 
onset. 
Increase in blood pressure 
Transient, generally asymptomatic, increase in blood pressure may occur in patients receiving 
hydroxocobalamin. The maximal increase in blood pressure has been observed toward the end of 
infusion (see section 4.8). 
Effects on blood cyanide assay 
Hydroxocobalamin will lower blood cyanide concentrations. While determination of blood cyanide 
concentration is not required and must not delay treatment with hydroxocobalamin, it may be useful 
for documenting cyanide poisoning. If a cyanide blood level determination is planned, it is 
recommended to draw the blood sample before initiation of treatment with Cyanokit. 
Interference with burn assessment 
Because of its deep red colour, hydroxocobalamin has the potential to induce a red colouration of the 
skin and therefore may interfere with burn assessment. However, skin lesions, oedema, and pain are 
highly suggestive of burns.

Interference with laboratory tests 
Because of its deep red colour, hydroxocobalamin has the potential to interfere with determination of 
laboratory parameters (e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and urine parameters). 
In vitro tests indicate that the extent and duration of the interference is dependant on numerous factors 
such as the dose of hydroxocobalamin, analyte, analyte concentration, methodology, analyser, 
concentrations of cobalamins-(III) including cyanocobalamin and partially the time between sampling 
and measurement. 
Based on in vitro studies and pharmacokinetic data obtained in healthy volunteers the following table 
describes interference with laboratory tests that may be observed following a 5 g dose of 
hydroxocobalamin. Interference following a 10 g dose can be expected to last up to an additional 
24 hours. The extent and duration of interference in cyanide-poisoned patients may differ according to 
the severity of intoxication. Results may vary considerably from one analyser to another, therefore, 
caution is required when reporting and interpreting laboratory results.

Hydroxocobalamin may interfere with all urine colorimetric parameters. The effects on these tests 
typically last 48 hours after a 5 g dose, but may persist for longer periods. Caution is required in the 
interpretation of urinary colorimetric tests for as long as chromaturia is present.

Interference with haemodialysis 
Because of its deep red color, hydroxocobalamin may cause haemodialysis machines to shut down 
due to an erroneous detection of a ‘blood leak’. This should be considered before haemodialysis is 
initiated in patients treated with hydroxocobalamin. 
Use with other cyanide antidotes 
The safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with Cyanokit has not been 
established (see section 6.2). If the decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with 
Cyanokit, these medicinal products must not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous 
line (see section 6.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Animal studies have shown teratogenic effects following daily exposure throughout organogenesis 
(see section 5.3). There are no adequate data from the use of hydroxocobalamin in pregnant women 
and the potential risk for humans is unknown.  
However, taken into account: 
- 
- 
- 
hydroxocobalamin may be given to a pregnant woman. 
that no more than two injections of hydroxocobalamin are to be administered, 
the potentially life threatening condition, 
the lack of alternative treatment, 
In case of known pregnancy at the time of treatment with Cyanokit or in case that pregnancy becomes 
known after treatment with Cyanokit, health care professionals are requested to promptly report the 
exposure during pregnancy to the Marketing Authorisation Holder and/or Health Authorities and to 
carefully follow-up on the pregnancy and its outcome. 
Breast-feeding  
Because hydroxocobalamin will be administered in potentially life-threatening situations, breast-
feeding is not a contraindication to its use. In the absence of data in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding 
discontinuation is recommended after receiving Cyanokit. 
Fertility 
No studies on fertility have been performed (see section 5.3).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
A total of 347 subjects were exposed to hydroxocobalamin in clinical studies. Of these 347 subjects, 
245 patients had suspected exposure to cyanide at the time of hydroxocobalamin administration. The 
remaining 102 subjects were healthy volunteers who had not been exposed to cyanide at the time of 
hydroxocobalamin administration. 
List of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been reported in association with Cyanokit use. However, 
because of the limitations of the available data, it is not possible to apply frequency estimations: 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. 
Immune system disorders 
Allergic reactions including angioneurotic oedema, skin eruption, urticaria and pruritus. 
Psychiatric disorders 
Restlessness. 
Nervous system disorders 
Memory impairment; dizziness. 
Eye disorders 
Swelling, irritation, redness.  
Cardiac disorders 
Ventricular extrasystoles. An increase in heart rate was observed in cyanide-poisoned patients. 
Vascular disorders 
Transient increase in blood pressure, usually resolving within several hours; hot flush. A decrease in 
blood pressure was observed in cyanide-poisoned patients. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Pleural effusion, dyspnoea, throat tightness, dry throat, chest discomfort. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, dysphagia.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Reversible red colouration of the skin and mucous membranes : most patients will experience it up to 
15 days after administration of Cyanokit. 
Pustular rashes, which may last for several weeks, affecting mainly the face and the neck. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
  Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, renal impairment, urine calcium oxalate crystals 
present (see section 4.4). 
  Chromaturia : all patients will show a dark red colouration of the urine quite marked during the 
first three days following administration. Urine colouration may last up to 35 days after 
administration of Cyanokit (see section 4.4 ). 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Headache; injection site reaction; peripheral oedema. 
Investigations 
Cyanokit may cause red discolouration of the plasma, which may cause artificial elevation or 
reduction in the levels of certain laboratory parameters (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Limited data on children (0 to 18 years old) treated with hydroxocobalamin did not show any 
difference in the safety profile of hydroxocobalamin between adults and children. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses as high as 15 g have been administered without reported specific dose related adverse 
reactions. If overdose occurs, treatment is directed to the management of symptoms. Haemodialysis 
may be effective in such a circumstance, but is only indicated in the event of significant 
hydroxocobalamin-related toxicity. However, hydroxocobalamin because of its deep red colour may 
interfere with the performance of haemodialysis machines (see section 4.4).

Mechanism of action 
The action of hydroxocobalamin in the treatment of cyanide poisoning is based on its ability to tightly 
bind cyanide ions. Each hydroxocobalamin molecule can bind one cyanide ion by substituting the 
hydroxo ligand linked to the trivalent cobalt ion to form cyanocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is a stable, 
non-toxic compound that is excreted in the urine.  
Efficacy 
Due to ethical considerations, no controlled human efficacy studies have been performed.  
 
Animal pharmacology 
The effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin was examined in a controlled study in cyanide-poisoned adult 
dogs. Dogs were poisoned by intravenous administration of a lethal dose of potassium cyanide. Dogs 
then received sodium chloride 9 mg/mL, 75 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin, administered 
intravenously over 7.5 minutes. The 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg doses are approximately equivalent to 
5 g and 10 g of hydroxocobalamin, respectively, in humans, not only on a body weight basis but also 
on Cmax basis of hydroxocobalamin [total cobalamins-(III), see section 5.2]. 
Survival at hour 4 and at day 14 was significantly greater in 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg 
hydroxocobalamin dose groups compared with dogs receiving sodium chloride 9 mg/mL alone:

Histopathology revealed brain lesions that were consistent with cyanide-induced hypoxia. The 
incidence of brain lesions was markedly lower in dogs having received 150 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin 
than in dogs having received 75 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL. 
The rapid and complete recovery of haemodynamics and subsequently of blood gases, pH, and lactate 
after cyanide poisoning likely contributed to the better outcome of the hydroxocobalamin-treated 
animals. Hydroxocobalamin reduced whole blood cyanide concentrations from about 120 nmol/mL to 
30-40 nmol/mL by the end of the infusion compared with 70 nmol/mL in dogs receiving sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL alone. 
 
Cyanide-poisoned patients 
A total of 245 patients with suspected or known cyanide-poisoning were included in the clinical 
studies of the efficacy of hydroxocobalamin as an antidote. Of the 213 patients in whom the outcome 
was known the survival was 58%. Of the 89 patients who died, 63 were initially found in cardiac 
arrest, suggesting that many of these patients had almost certainly suffered irreparable brain injury 
prior to administration of hydroxocobalamin. Among 144 patients not in initial cardiac arrest whose 
outcomes were known, 118 (82%) survived. Furthermore, in 34 patients with known cyanide 
concentrations above the lethal threshold (≥ 100 µmol/L), 21 (62%) survived following treatment with 
hydroxocobalamin. 
Administration of hydroxocobalamin was generally associated with a normalisation of blood pressure 
(systolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg) in 17 of 21 patients (81%) who had low blood pressure (systolic 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blood pressure > 0 and ≤ 90 mmHg) after exposure to cyanide. Where neurological assessment over 
time was possible, (96 patients of the 171 patients who presented with neurological symptoms prior to 
hydroxocobalamin administration), 51 (53%) patients receiving hydroxocobalamin showed 
improvement or a complete restoration.  
 
Elderly 
Approximately 50 known or suspected cyanide victims aged 65 or older received hydroxocobalamin 
in clinical studies. In general, the effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin in these patients was similar to 
that of younger patients. 
 
Paediatric population 
Documentation on efficacy is available for 54 paediatric patients. The mean age of the paediatric 
patients was about six years and the mean dose of hydroxocobalamin was about 120 mg/kg body 
weight. The survival rate of 41% depended very much on the clinical situation. Out of the 
20 paediatric patients without initial cardiac arrest, 18 (90%) survived, of whom 4 with sequelae. In 
general, the effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin in paediatric patients was similar to that of adults. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following intravenous administration of Cyanokit, significant binding to plasma proteins and low 
molecular weight physiological compounds occurs, to form various cobalamin-(III) complexes by 
replacing the hydroxo ligand. The low molecular weight cobalamins-(III) formed including 
hydroxocobalamin are termed free cobalamins-(III); the sum of free and protein-bound cobalamins is 
termed total cobalamins-(III). In order to reflect the exposure to the sum of all derivatives, 
pharmacokinetics of cobalamins-(III) were investigated instead of hydroxocobalamin, requiring the 
concentration unit µg eq/mL (i.e. cobalamin-(III) entity without specific ligand). 
Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were observed following single dose intravenous administration 
of 2.5 to 10 g of Cyanokit in healthy volunteers. Mean free and total cobalamins-(III) Cmax values of 
113 and 579 µg eq/mL, respectively, were determined following a dose of 5 g Cyanokit (the 
recommended initial dose). Similarly, mean free and total cobalamins-(III) Cmax values of 197 and 
995 µg eq/mL, respectively, were determined following the dose of 10 g Cyanokit. The predominant 
mean half-life of free and total cobalamins-(III) was approximately 26 to 31 hours at the 5 and 10 g 
dose level. 
The mean total amount of cobalamins-(III) excreted in urine during the collection period of 72 hours 
was approximately 60% of a 5 g dose and approximately 50% of a 10 g dose of Cyanokit. Overall, the 
total urinary excretion was calculated to be at least 60 to 70% of the administered dose. The majority 
of the urinary excretion occurred during the first 24 hours, but red coloured urine was observed for up 
to 35 days following the intravenous infusion. 
When normalized for body weight, male and female subjects revealed no major differences in plasma 
and urinary pharmacokinetic parameters of free and total cobalamins-(III) following the 
administration of 5 g or 10 g Cyanokit. 
In cyanide-poisoned patients, hydroxocobalamin is expected to bind cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, 
which is excreted in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of total cobalamins-(III) in this population may 
be affected by the body's cyanide load, since cyanocobalamin was reported to exhibit a 2-3 times 
lower half-life than total cobalamins-(III) in healthy volunteers.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In anaesthetised rabbits, hydroxocobalamin exerted haemodynamic effects (increased mean arterial 
blood pressure and total peripheral resistance, decreased cardiac output) related to its nitric oxide-
scavenging property. 
No special hazard for humans was identified based on conventional studies of single and repeated 
dose toxicity and genotoxicity. The liver and kidney were found to be the major target organs. 
However findings were only seen at exposure levels considered being higher than the maximum 
human exposure, indicating limited relevance to clinical use. In particular, liver fibrosis was observed 
in dogs after administration of hydroxocobalamin for 4 weeks at 300 mg/kg. The relevance of this 
finding to humans is unlikely since it was not reported in short-term studies conducted with 
hydroxocobalamin. 
Developmental toxicity, including teratogenicity, was observed in rats and rabbits at dose levels of 
150 mg/kg and higher administered daily throughout organogenesis. The dose of 150 mg/kg 
approximately corresponds to the maximum recommended human dose. 
No data are available on male and female fertility as well as on peri- and postnatal development. 
Hydroxocobalamin has not been evaluated for carcinogenic potential.

6.2 
Incompatibilities 
This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in 
section 6.6. 
Physical incompatibility (particle formation) was observed with the mixture of hydroxocobalamin 
reconstituted solution and the following medicinal products: diazepam, dobutamine, dopamine, 
fentanyl, nitroglycerin, pentobarbital, phenytoin sodium, propofol and thiopental.  
Chemical incompatibility was observed with the mixture of hydroxocobalamin reconstituted solution 
and the following medicinal products: epinephrine, lidocaine hydrochloride, adenosine, atropine, 
midazolam, ketamin, succinylcholine chloride, amiodarone hydrochloride, sodium bicarbonate, 
sodium thiosulfate, sodium nitrite, and has been reported with ascorbic acid.  
Consequently, these and other medicinal products must not be administered simultaneously through 
the same intravenous line as hydroxocobalamin. 
Simultaneous administration of hydroxocobalamin and blood products (whole blood, packed red cells, 
platelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma) through the same intravenous line is not recommended.  
6.3  Shelf life 
3 years. 
For the purpose of ambulatory use, Cyanokit may be exposed during short periods to the temperature 
variations of usual transport (15 days submitted to temperatures ranging from 5°C to 40°C), transport 
in the desert (4 days submitted to temperatures ranging from 5°C to 60°C) and freezing/defrosting 
cycles (15 days submitted to temperatures ranging from -20°C to 40°C). If these temporary conditions 
have been exceeded, the product should be discarded.

Chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) has been demonstrated for 6 hours at a temperature between 2°C and 40°C.  
From a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
would normally not be longer than 6 hours at 2°C to 8ºC. 
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Do not store above 25°C. 
For storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
Type II colourless 250 mL glass vial closed with bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium cap 
with a plastic lid.  
Each pack contains two vials (each vial packed in one cardboard box), two sterile transfer devices, 
one sterile intravenous infusion set and one sterile short catheter for administration to children. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
No special requirements for disposal. 
Each vial is to be reconstituted with 100 mL of diluent using the supplied sterile transfer device.  
Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is the recommended diluent. Only when 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is not available, Lactated Ringer solution or 
glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection can also be used.  
The Cyanokit vial is to be rocked or inverted for at least 30 seconds to mix the solution. It must not be 
shaken as shaking the vial may cause foam and therefore may make checking reconstitution less easy. 
Because the reconstituted solution is a dark red solution, some insoluble particles may not be seen. 
The intravenous infusion set provided in the kit must then be used as it includes an appropriate filter 
and is to be primed with the reconstituted solution. Repeat this procedure if necessary with the second 
vial.

Maximum dose 
Adults: The maximum total recommended dose is 10 g. 
Paediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the maximum total recommended 
dose is 140 mg/kg not exceeding 10 g. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Although the safety and efficacy of hydroxocobalamin have not been studied in renal and hepatic 
impairments, Cyanokit is administered as emergency therapy in an acute, life-threatening situation 
only and no dose adjustment is required in these patients. 
Method of administration 
Initial dose of Cyanokit is administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. 
The rate of intravenous infusion for the second dose ranges from 15 minutes (for patients extremely 
unstable) to 2 hours based on patient condition. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
None. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Treatment of cyanide poisoning must include immediate attention to airway patency, adequacy of 
oxygenation and hydration, cardiovascular support, and management of seizures. Consideration must 
be given to decontamination measures based on the route of exposure. 
Cyanokit does not substitute oxygen therapy and must not delay the set up of the above measures. 
The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely 
available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of 
clinical history and/or signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication.  
Cyanide poisoning may result from exposure to smoke from closed space fires, inhalation, ingestion, 
or dermal exposure. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogens, 
including cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, or prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside. 
Signs and symptoms of cyanide poisoning 
Common signs and symptoms of cyanide poisoning include: nausea, vomiting, headache, altered 
mental status (e.g. confusion, disorientation), chest tightness, dyspnoea, tachypnoea or hyperpnoea 
(early), bradypnoea or apnoea (late), hypertension (early) or hypotension (late), cardiovascular 
collapse, seizures or coma, mydriasis, and plasma lactate concentration > 8 mmol/L. 
In the setting of multiple casualties such as terrorism or chemical disaster, panic symptoms including 
tachypnoea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental 
status (confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Smoke inhalation 
Not all smoke inhalation victims necessarily will have cyanide poisoning, but may present with burns, 
trauma, and exposure to additional toxic substances aggravating the clinical picture. Before Cyanokit 
is administered, it is recommended to check affected persons for the presence of the following: 
 
 
 
exposure to fire smoke in an enclosed area 
soot present around mouth, nose and/or oropharynx 
altered mental status 
In this setting hypotension and/or a plasma lactate concentration ≥ 10 mmol/L (higher than the one 
mentioned under signs and symptoms due to the fact that carbon monoxide contributes to lactic 
acidaemia) are highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning. In the presence of the above signs, treatment 
with Cyanokit must not be delayed to obtain a plasma lactate concentration. 
Renal disorders 
Oxalate crystals have been observed in the urine of healthy volunteers given hydroxocobalamin. 
Cases of acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, renal impairment and urine calcium oxalate 
crystals present have been reported in patients treated with hydroxocobalamin following known or 
suspected cyanide poisoning. In some situations, hemodialysis was required to achieve recovery  (see 
section 4.8). 
Therefore, as a precaution, after Cyanokit administration, regular monitoring of renal function 
(including blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine)  should be performed until 7 days after drug 
onset. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Known hypersensitivity to hydroxocobalamin or vitamin B12 must be taken into benefit-risk 
consideration before administration of Cyanokit, since hypersensitive reactions may occur in patients 
receiving hydroxocobalamin (see section 4.8). 
Increase in blood pressure 
Transient, generally asymptomatic, increase in blood pressure may occur in patients receiving 
hydroxocobalamin. The maximal increase in blood pressure has been observed toward the end of 
infusion (see section 4.8). 
Effects on blood cyanide assay 
Hydroxocobalamin will lower blood cyanide concentrations. While determination of blood cyanide 
concentration is not required and must not delay treatment with hydroxocobalamin, it may be useful 
for documenting cyanide poisoning. If a cyanide blood level determination is planned, it is 
recommended to draw the blood sample before initiation of treatment with Cyanokit. 
Interference with burn assessment 
Because of its deep red colour, hydroxocobalamin has the potential to induce a red colouration of the 
skin and therefore may interfere with burn assessment. However, skin lesions, oedema, and pain are 
highly suggestive of burns. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interference with laboratory tests 
Because of its deep red colour, hydroxocobalamin has the potential to interfere with determination of 
laboratory parameters (e.g. clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation, and urine parameters). 
In vitro tests indicate that the extent and duration of the interference is dependant on numerous factors 
such as the dose of hydroxocobalamin, analyte, analyte concentration, methodology, analyser, 
concentrations of cobalamins-(III) including cyanocobalamin and partially the time between sampling 
and measurement. 
Based on in vitro studies and pharmacokinetic data obtained in healthy volunteers the following table 
describes interference with laboratory tests that may be observed following a 5 g dose of 
hydroxocobalamin. Interference following a 10 g dose can be expected to last up to an additional 
24 hours. The extent and duration of interference in cyanide-poisoned patients may differ according to 
the severity of intoxication. Results may vary considerably from one analyser to another, therefore, 
caution is required when reporting and interpreting laboratory results.

Hydroxocobalamin may interfere with all urine colorimetric parameters. The effects on these tests 
typically last 48 hours after a 5 g dose, but may persist for longer periods. Caution is required in the 
interpretation of urinary colorimetric tests for as long as chromaturia is present. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Interference with haemodialysis 
Because of its deep red color, hydroxocobalamin may cause haemodialysis machines to shut down 
due to an erroneous detection of a ‘blood leak’. This should be considered before haemodialysis is 
initiated in patients treated with hydroxocobalamin. 
Use with other cyanide antidotes 
The safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with Cyanokit has not been 
established (see section 6.2). If the decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with 
Cyanokit, these medicinal products must not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous 
line (see section 6.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Animal studies have shown teratogenic effects following daily exposure throughout organogenesis 
(see section 5.3). There are no adequate data from the use of hydroxocobalamin in pregnant women 
and the potential risk for humans is unknown.  
However, taken into account: 
- 
- 
- 
hydroxocobalamin may be given to a pregnant woman. 
that no more than two injections of hydroxocobalamin are to be administered, 
the potentially life threatening condition, 
the lack of alternative treatment, 
In case of known pregnancy at the time of treatment with Cyanokit or in case that pregnancy becomes 
known after treatment with Cyanokit, health care professionals are requested to promptly report the 
exposure during pregnancy to the Marketing Authorisation Holder and/or Health Authorities and to 
carefully follow-up on the pregnancy and its outcome. 
Breast-feeding  
Because hydroxocobalamin will be administered in potentially life-threatening situations, breast-
feeding is not a contraindication to its use. In the absence of data in breast-fed infants, breast-feeding 
discontinuation is recommended after receiving Cyanokit. 
Fertility 
No studies on fertility have been performed (see section 5.3).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
A total of 347 subjects were exposed to hydroxocobalamin in clinical studies. Of these 347 subjects, 
245 patients had suspected exposure to cyanide at the time of hydroxocobalamin administration. The 
remaining 102 subjects were healthy volunteers who had not been exposed to cyanide at the time of 
hydroxocobalamin administration. 
List of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been reported in association with Cyanokit use. However, 
because of the limitations of the available data, it is not possible to apply frequency estimations: 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Decrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. 
Immune system disorders 
Allergic reactions including angioneurotic oedema, skin eruption, urticaria and pruritus. 
Psychiatric disorders 
Restlessness. 
Nervous system disorders 
Memory impairment; dizziness. 
Eye disorders 
Swelling, irritation, redness.  
Cardiac disorders 
Ventricular extrasystoles. An increase in heart rate was observed in cyanide-poisoned patients. 
Vascular disorders 
Transient increase in blood pressure, usually resolving within several hours; hot flush. A decrease in 
blood pressure was observed in cyanide-poisoned patients. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Pleural effusion, dyspnoea, throat tightness, dry throat, chest discomfort. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, dysphagia.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Reversible red colouration of the skin and mucous membranes: most patients will experience it up to 
15 days after administration of Cyanokit. 
Pustular rashes, which may last for several weeks, affecting mainly the face and the neck. 
Renal and urinary disorders 
 Acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, renal impairment, urine calcium oxalate crystals 
present (see section 4.4). 
 Chromaturia: all patients will show a dark red colouration of the urine quite marked during the first 
three days following administration. Urine colouration may last up to 35 days after administration of 
Cyanokit (see section 4.4).   
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Headache; injection site reaction; peripheral oedema. 
Investigations 
Cyanokit may cause red discolouration of the plasma, which may cause artificial elevation or 
reduction in the levels of certain laboratory parameters (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Limited data on children (0 to 18 years old) treated with hydroxocobalamin did not show any 
difference in the safety profile of hydroxocobalamin between adults and children. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Doses as high as 15 g have been administered without reported specific dose related adverse 
reactions. If overdose occurs, treatment is directed to the management of symptoms. Haemodialysis 
may be effective in such a circumstance, but is only indicated in the event of significant 
hydroxocobalamin-related toxicity. However, hydroxocobalamin because of its deep red colour may 
interfere with the performance of haemodialysis machines (see section 4.4).

Mechanism of action 
The action of hydroxocobalamin in the treatment of cyanide poisoning is based on its ability to tightly 
bind cyanide ions. Each hydroxocobalamin molecule can bind one cyanide ion by substituting the 
hydroxo ligand linked to the trivalent cobalt ion to form cyanocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin is a stable, 
non-toxic compound that is excreted in the urine.  
Efficacy 
Due to ethical considerations, no controlled human efficacy studies have been performed.  
 
Animal pharmacology 
The effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin was examined in a controlled study in cyanide-poisoned adult 
dogs. Dogs were poisoned by intravenous administration of a lethal dose of potassium cyanide. Dogs 
then received sodium chloride 9 mg/mL, 75 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin, administered 
intravenously over 7.5 minutes. The 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg doses are approximately equivalent to 
5 g and 10 g of hydroxocobalamin, respectively, in humans, not only on a body weight basis but also 
on Cmax basis of hydroxocobalamin [total cobalamins-(III), see section 5.2]. 
Survival at hour 4 and at day 14 was significantly greater in 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg 
hydroxocobalamin dose groups compared with dogs receiving sodium chloride 9 mg/mL alone:

Histopathology revealed brain lesions that were consistent with cyanide-induced hypoxia. The 
incidence of brain lesions was markedly lower in dogs having received 150 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin 
than in dogs having received 75 mg/kg hydroxocobalamin or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL. 
The rapid and complete recovery of haemodynamics and subsequently of blood gases, pH, and lactate 
after cyanide poisoning likely contributed to the better outcome of the hydroxocobalamin-treated 
animals. Hydroxocobalamin reduced whole blood cyanide concentrations from about 120 nmol/mL to 
30-40 nmol/mL by the end of the infusion compared with 70 nmol/mL in dogs receiving sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL alone. 
 
Cyanide-poisoned patients 
A total of 245 patients with suspected or known cyanide-poisoning were included in the clinical 
studies of the efficacy of hydroxocobalamin as an antidote. Of the 213 patients in whom the outcome 
was known the survival was 58%. Of the 89 patients who died, 63 were initially found in cardiac 
arrest, suggesting that many of these patients had almost certainly suffered irreparable brain injury 
prior to administration of hydroxocobalamin. Among 144 patients not in initial cardiac arrest whose 
outcomes were known, 118 (82%) survived. Furthermore, in 34 patients with known cyanide 
concentrations above the lethal threshold (≥ 100 µmol/L), 21 (62%) survived following treatment with 
hydroxocobalamin. 
Administration of hydroxocobalamin was generally associated with a normalisation of blood pressure 
(systolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg) in 17 of 21 patients (81%) who had low blood pressure (systolic 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blood pressure > 0 and ≤ 90 mmHg) after exposure to cyanide. Where neurological assessment over 
time was possible, (96 patients of the 171 patients who presented with neurological symptoms prior to 
hydroxocobalamin administration), 51 (53%) patients receiving hydroxocobalamin showed 
improvement or a complete restoration.  
 
Elderly 
Approximately 50 known or suspected cyanide victims aged 65 or older received hydroxocobalamin 
in clinical studies. In general, the effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin in these patients was similar to 
that of younger patients. 
 
Paediatric population 
Documentation on efficacy is available for 54 paediatric patients. The mean age of the paediatric 
patients was about six years and the mean dose of hydroxocobalamin was about 120 mg/kg body 
weight. The survival rate of 41% depended very much on the clinical situation. Out of the 
20 paediatric patients without initial cardiac arrest, 18 (90%) survived, of whom 4 with sequelae. In 
general, the effectiveness of hydroxocobalamin in paediatric patients was similar to that of adults. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following intravenous administration of Cyanokit, significant binding to plasma proteins and low 
molecular weight physiological compounds occurs, to form various cobalamin-(III) complexes by 
replacing the hydroxo ligand. The low molecular weight cobalamins-(III) formed including 
hydroxocobalamin are termed free cobalamins-(III); the sum of free and protein-bound cobalamins is 
termed total cobalamins-(III). In order to reflect the exposure to the sum of all derivatives, 
pharmacokinetics of cobalamins-(III) were investigated instead of hydroxocobalamin, requiring the 
concentration unit µg eq/mL (i.e. cobalamin-(III) entity without specific ligand). 
Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were observed following single dose intravenous administration 
of 2.5 to 10 g of Cyanokit in healthy volunteers. Mean free and total cobalamins-(III) Cmax values of 
113 and 579 µg eq/mL, respectively, were determined following a dose of 5 g Cyanokit (the 
recommended initial dose). Similarly, mean free and total cobalamins-(III) Cmax values of 197 and 
995 µg eq/mL, respectively, were determined following the dose of 10 g Cyanokit. The predominant 
mean half-life of free and total cobalamins-(III) was approximately 26 to 31 hours at the 5 and 10 g 
dose level. 
The mean total amount of cobalamins-(III) excreted in urine during the collection period of 72 hours 
was approximately 60% of a 5 g dose and approximately 50% of a 10 g dose of Cyanokit. Overall, the 
total urinary excretion was calculated to be at least 60 to 70% of the administered dose. The majority 
of the urinary excretion occurred during the first 24 hours, but red coloured urine was observed for up 
to 35 days following the intravenous infusion. 
When normalized for body weight, male and female subjects revealed no major differences in plasma 
and urinary pharmacokinetic parameters of free and total cobalamins-(III) following the 
administration of 5 g or 10 g Cyanokit. 
In cyanide-poisoned patients, hydroxocobalamin is expected to bind cyanide to form cyanocobalamin, 
which is excreted in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of total cobalamins-(III) in this population may 
be affected by the body's cyanide load, since cyanocobalamin was reported to exhibit a 2-3 times 
lower half-life than total cobalamins-(III) in healthy volunteers. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In anaesthetised rabbits, hydroxocobalamin exerted haemodynamic effects (increased mean arterial 
blood pressure and total peripheral resistance, decreased cardiac output) related to its nitric oxide-
scavenging property. 
No special hazard for humans was identified based on conventional studies of single and repeated 
dose toxicity and genotoxicity. The liver and kidney were found to be the major target organs. 
However findings were only seen at exposure levels considered being higher than the maximum 
human exposure, indicating limited relevance to clinical use. In particular, liver fibrosis was observed 
in dogs after administration of hydroxocobalamin for 4 weeks at 300 mg/kg. The relevance of this 
finding to humans is unlikely since it was not reported in short-term studies conducted with 
hydroxocobalamin. 
Developmental toxicity, including teratogenicity, was observed in rats and rabbits at dose levels of 
150 mg/kg and higher administered daily throughout organogenesis. The dose of 150 mg/kg 
approximately corresponds to the maximum recommended human dose. 
No data are available on male and female fertility as well as on peri- and postnatal development. 
Hydroxocobalamin has not been evaluated for carcinogenic potential.

6.2 
Incompatibilities 
This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products except those mentioned in 
section 6.6. 
Physical incompatibility (particle formation) was observed with the mixture of hydroxocobalamin 
reconstituted solution and the following medicinal products: diazepam, dobutamine, dopamine, 
fentanyl, nitroglycerin, pentobarbital, phenytoin sodium, propofol and thiopental.  
Chemical incompatibility was observed with the mixture of hydroxocobalamin reconstituted solution 
and the following medicinal products: epinephrine, lidocaine hydrochloride, adenosine, atropine, 
midazolam, ketamin, succinylcholine chloride, amiodarone hydrochloride, sodium bicarbonate, 
sodium thiosulfate, sodium nitrite, and has been reported with ascorbic acid.  
Consequently, these and other medicinal products must not be administered simultaneously through 
the same intravenous line as hydroxocobalamin. 
Simultaneous administration of hydroxocobalamin and blood products (whole blood, packed red cells, 
platelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma) through the same intravenous line is not recommended.  
6.3  Shelf life 
3 years. 
For the purpose of ambulatory use, Cyanokit may be exposed during short periods to the temperature 
variations of usual transport (15 days submitted to temperatures ranging from 5°C to 40°C), transport 
in the desert (4 days submitted to temperatures ranging from 5°C to 60°C) and freezing/defrosting 
cycles (15 days submitted to temperatures ranging from -20°C to 40°C). If these temporary conditions 
have been exceeded, the product should be discarded.

Chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted solution with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) has been demonstrated for 6 hours at a temperature between 2°C and 40°C.  
From a microbiological point of view, the medicinal product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and 
would normally not be longer than 6 hours at 2°C to 8ºC. 
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Do not store above 25°C. 
For storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
Type I colourless 250 mL glass vial closed with bromobutyl rubber stopper and an aluminium cap 
with a plastic lid.  
Each pack contains one vial packed in one cardboard box, one sterile transfer device, one sterile 
intravenous infusion set and one sterile short catheter for administration to children. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
No special requirements for disposal. 
The vial is to be reconstituted with 200 mL of diluent using the supplied sterile transfer device. 
Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is the recommended diluent. Only when 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is not available, Lactated Ringer solution or 
glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection can also be used.  
The Cyanokit vial is to be rocked or inverted for at least 1 minute to mix the solution. It must not be 
shaken as shaking the vial may cause foam and therefore may make checking reconstitution less easy. 
Because the reconstituted solution is a dark red solution, some insoluble particles may not be seen. 
The intravenous infusion set provided in the kit must then be used as it includes an appropriate filter 
and is to be primed with the reconstituted solution.

Other sources of information 
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: 
Handling instructions 
Treatment of cyanide poisoning must include immediate attention to airway patency, adequacy 
of oxygenation and hydration, cardiovascular support, and management of seizures. 
Consideration must be given to decontamination measures based on the route of exposure. 
Cyanokit does not substitute oxygen therapy and must not delay the set up of the above 
measures. 
The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely 
available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. However, if a cyanide blood level 
determination is planned, it is recommended to draw the blood sample before initiation of 
treatment with Cyanokit. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history 
and/or signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. If there is clinical suspicion of cyanide 
poisoning, it is strongly recommended that Cyanokit be administered without delay. 
Preparation of Cyanokit 
Each vial is to be reconstituted with 100 mL of diluent using the supplied sterile transfer device. 
Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is the recommended diluent. Only when 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is not available, Lactated Ringer solution or 
glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection can also be used.  
The Cyanokit vial is to be rocked or inverted for at least 30 seconds to mix the solution. It must not be 
shaken as shaking the vial may cause foam and therefore may make checking reconstitution less easy. 
Because the reconstituted solution is a dark red solution, some insoluble particles may not be seen. 
The intravenous infusion set provided in the kit must then be used as it includes an appropriate filter 
and is to be primed with the reconstituted solution.  Repeat this procedure if necessary with the 
second vial. 
Posology 
Initial dose 
Adults: The initial dose of Cyanokit is 5 g (2 x 100 mL). 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population: In infants to adolescents (0 to 18 years old), the initial dose of Cyanokit is

Renal and hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in these patients. 
Method of administration 
Initial dose of Cyanokit is administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes. 
The rate of intravenous infusion for the second dose ranges from 15 minutes (for patients extremely 
unstable) to 2 hours based on patient condition. 
Simultaneous administration of Cyanokit and other products 
Cyanokit must not be mixed with diluents other than sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection or Lactated Ringer solution or glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection. 
As physical and chemical incompatibilities were observed with a number of selected medicinal 
products that are frequently used in resuscitation efforts, these and other medicinal products must not 
be administered simultaneously in the same intravenous line as hydroxocobalamin. 
If blood products (whole blood, packed red cells, platelet concentrate and fresh frozen plasma) and 
hydroxocobalamin are administered simultaneously, use of separate intravenous lines (preferably on 
contralateral extremities) is recommended. 
Combination with another cyanide antidote: Chemical incompatibility was observed with sodium 
thiosulfate and sodium nitrite. If the decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with 
Cyanokit, these medicinal products must not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous 
line.

before treating you with Cyanokit. 
that you have been treated with Cyanokit if you need to have the following: 
-  any blood or urine tests. Cyanokit may modify the results of these tests. 
-  burn assessement. Cyanokit may interfere with the assessment as it causes red coloration of 
the skin. 
-  haemodialysis. Cyanokit may lead to shut down of haemodialysis machines until it is 
eliminated from the blood (at least 5.5 to 6.5 days). 
-  monitoring of renal function: Cyanokit may lead to kidney failure and urine crystals.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: 
Handling instructions 
Treatment of cyanide poisoning must include immediate attention to airway patency, adequacy 
of oxygenation and hydration, cardiovascular support, and management of seizures. 
Consideration must be given to decontamination measures based on the route of exposure. 
Cyanokit does not substitute oxygen therapy and must not delay the set up of the above 
measures. 
The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely 
available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. However, if a cyanide blood level 
determination is planned, it is recommended to draw the blood sample before initiation of 
treatment with Cyanokit. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history 
and/or signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. If there is clinical suspicion of cyanide 
poisoning, it is strongly recommended that Cyanokit be administered without delay. 
Preparation of Cyanokit 
The vial is to be reconstituted with 200 mL of diluent using the supplied sterile transfer device. 
Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is the recommended diluent. Only when 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection is not available, Lactated Ringer solution or 
glucose 50 mg/mL (5%) solution for injection can also be used.  
The Cyanokit vial is to be rocked or inverted for at least 1 minute to mix the solution. It must not be 
shaken as shaking the vial may cause foam and therefore may make checking reconstitution less easy. 
Because the reconstituted solution is a dark red solution, some insoluble particles may not be seen. 
The intravenous infusion set provided in the kit must then be used as it includes an appropriate filter 
and is to be primed with the reconstituted solution.

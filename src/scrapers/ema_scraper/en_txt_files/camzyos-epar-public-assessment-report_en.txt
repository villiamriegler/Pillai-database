2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
The applicant is proposing the following indication:
Camzyos is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic (New York Heart Association, NYHA, 
class II-III) obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) in adult patients (see section 5.1).
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors
Prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
Estimates of the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in various countries range from 4 
to 7 per 10,000, covering various time frames from 1997 through 2016 (Javidgonbadi et al. 2019) 
(Husser et al. 2018) (Pujades-Rodriguez et al. 2018) (Magnusson et al. 2017) (Adalsteinsdottir et al. 
2014). A recent study by Lannou et al. estimated HCM prevalence in France at 10 per 10,000 (Lannou 
et al. 2020). However, this study used only inpatient records to identify HCM. Pujades-Rodriguez et al. 
reported on the proportion of HCM patients identified in inpatient and outpatient settings, and 
approximately 30% of HCM patients identified did not have a hospitalization for HCM (Pujades-
Rodriguez et al. 2018). Therefore, a study of HCM patients identified through inpatient records only 
would not provide an accurate estimate of disease prevalence.
The CARDIA study was the first to examine the prevalence of echocardiographic features of HCM (ie, 
hypertrophied, nondilated left ventricles and maximal wall thickness ≥15 mm that were not associated 
with systemic hypertension) in a general population of 4111 men and women (Maron et al. 1995). 
Although this study, as well as more recent population genetic studies (Semsarian et al. 2015), have 
shown a prevalence of HCM at approximately 1:500 or higher, most of the patients whose 
echocardiograph results met the criteria for HCM were asymptomatic and undiagnosed. This is 
supported by the observation that a majority of people with HCM are asymptomatic and do not receive 
an HCM diagnosis in their lifetime. In contrast, a recent analysis of a US claims database showed a 
prevalence of clinically established HCM of approximately 1:3000 (0.03%) (Maron et al. 2016). Thus, 
the number of patients with HCM who are diagnosed is much smaller, suggesting that most people 
with HCM experience a normal life span without limiting symptoms or the need for major treatments.
Prevalence of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Estimates of the proportion of patients with HCM who have obstructive HCM (oHCM) range from 22% 
to 70%. Javidonbadi et al. was the only study to report on oHCM specifically: 251 per 1.6 million or 1.6 
per 10,000. In that study, 22% of the HCM patients had oHCM (Javidgonbadi et al., 2019).
The prevalence of oHCM has been shown to increase with age. Husser et al., demonstrated that the 
prevalence of HCM in the German population increased from 7.4 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 5.2–10.1) in 0 to 9- year-olds to 298.7 per 100,000 persons (95% CI 276.4–322.4) in 
patients > 80 years (Husser et al. 2018). In all age categories, men had a numerically higher 
prevalence than women with significant differences in patients > 30 years. In the Cardiomyopathy 
Registry of the EURObservational Research Programme (EORP) the mean age of HCM diagnosis was 47 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 13/277
years, with 25th and 75th percentiles at 33 and 59 years of age, respectively (Charron et al. 2018). 
Using these data, and assuming an approximate 70% proportion of patients with oHCM, prevalence 
can be estimated as 1 and 21 per 10,000 (0 to 9-year-olds and > 80 years, respectively), throughout a 
wide age range.  
In summary, taking all mentioned prevalence studies above, and assuming an approximate 
70% proportion of patients with HCM have the obstructive phenotype, prevalence of symptomatic 
oHCM in the adult population is below approximately 5 in 10,000.
2.1.3.  Biologic features. Aetiology and pathogenesis
HCM
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disorder defined by left ventricular (LV) 
hypertrophy that cannot be explained by another cardiac or systemic disease (Marian and Braunwald 
2017). HCM is a chronic, progressive disease of the cardiomyocyte, and largely of the cardiac 
sarcomere, with a diverse clinical presentation and course. HCM can be familial and is the most 
common genetic disease affecting the heart muscle. Mutations in cardiac myosin and other sarcomere 
proteins increase calcium sensitivity of myofilaments and can dysregulate sarcomere structure, 
favouring the formation of excess cross-bridges during systole and diastole, altering sarcomere 
kinetics, and increasing sarcomere energy utilization, resulting in ventricular hypercontractility 
accompanied by reduced LV compliance, which is reflected clinically as reduced ventricular chamber 
size, often supranormal ejection fraction, and diastolic dysfunction. (Spudich 2019; McNamara et al. 
2017; Anderson et al. 2018; Adhikari et al. 2019; Toepfer et al. 2019; Sarkar et al. 2020; Toepfer et 
al. 2020). Over time, HCM leads to tissue remodelling, characterized histologically, by myocyte 
hypertrophy and disarray, microvascular remodelling, and fibrosis. Mutations in any of the structural 
genes of the sarcomere can be documented in approximately 40% of affected individuals overall and in 
about 60% of those with a family history of clinical disease (Ommen et al. 2020; Alfares et al. 2015; 
Elliott et al., 2014; Hershberger et al. 2009; Maron et al. 2012). Moreover, sarcomere hyperactivity 
underlying systolic and diastolic dysfunction in HCM has been reported regardless of aetiology (Hoskins 
et al. 2010) and often heralds the clinical onset of the disease (Ho 2011).
Obstructive HCM (oHCM)
Obstructive HCM (oHCM) and nonobstructive HCM (nHCM) are 2 subclassifications of HCM, based on 
the presence or absence of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, defined as peak LV outflow 
gradient ≥30 mmHg at rest or with provocation (Elliott et al. 2014). Both subtypes of HCM are 
characterized by LV hypercontractility, hypertrophy, and reduced compliance. However, oHCM also has 
reduced LV outflow due to structural changes in the LVOT.
The precise mechanism of LVOT obstruction remains an active area of study, but it is attributed to a 
combination of abnormal ventricular geometry caused by septal hypertrophy, reduced ventricular 
cavity size, and pathologic elongation of the mitral valve (Sherrid et al. 2000). Ventricular obstruction 
produces increased LV systolic pressure and a variable array of subsequent abnormalities, including 
prolongation of ventricular relaxation, the elevation of LV diastolic pressure, mitral regurgitation, left 
atrial (LA) enlargement, atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, and decreased forward cardiac output 
(Maron et al. 2003).

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis
Subjects with oHCM experience progressive diminishing cardiac function and are at greater risk to 
develop heart failure and symptoms from systolic dysfunction and atrial fibrillation, which increases 
risk for thromboembolic stroke. Additionally, patients with HCM have an increased risk of sudden 
cardiac death (SCD), which is directly related to changes in cardiac structure and function, including 
LVOT gradient, maximal wall thickness, and left atrial volume index (LAVI). The risk of SCD ranges 
from 0.5% to 2% per year in adults with HCM (Maron et al., 2003; Ho et al., 2018; Elliott et al., 2014; 
Ommen et al., 2020). A study with long-term follow-up of 1101 oHCM patients showed a significant 
association between LVOT peak gradient > 30 mmHg and unfavourable outcomes, including disease 
progression (NYHA Class III or IV) or death from heart failure or stroke (Maron et al. 2003).
Patients with oHCM often experience symptoms which include shortness of breath at rest or with 
exertion, fatigue, chest pain, and limited exercise capacity that worsen over time in the absence of 
effective treatment. The presence and degree of symptoms vary across patients. While some 
experience few symptoms and minor limitations in daily activities, many experience significant 
debilitating consequences and high symptom burden with profound effects on their daily lives, 
livelihood, and families (Zaiser et al. 2020). Variability in symptom presentation may lead to delays in 
diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and receiving treatment that targets diseases other than HCM.
2.1.5.  Management
Currently, there are no approved disease-specific or sarcomere-targeted therapies for oHCM in EU. The 
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline states that in the absence of large randomized clinical 
studies, pharmacological therapy is administered on an empirical basis to improve functional capacity, 
reduce symptoms, and prevent disease progression. The current guideline relies on the use of 
established negative inotropic agents, including beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers, and disopyramide, which results in a reduction of systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral 
valve/septal contact and LVOT obstruction (Elliott et al. 2014) (Ommen et al. 2020): 
Beta-blockers: Patients with symptomatic oHCM are treated initially with nonvasodilating beta-
blockers titrated to maximally tolerated dose (Class I recommendation, level of evidence B in 2014 
ESC and 2011 ACCF/AHA). Small and mostly retrospective studies suggest that oral propranolol can 
abolish or reduce resting and provocable LVOT obstruction and provide symptomatic benefit (Elliott et 
al. 2014; Ommen et al. 2020). However, there are no adequate, well-controlled, randomized, double-
blind studies of these compounds, and no robust, evidence-based benefits in HCM have been shown. 
None of the recommendations in the current ESC or American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association (AHA) treatment guidelines for HCM are supported by Level A Evidence. The only medicinal 
products approved in Europe for use in the management of HCM are the beta-blockers propranolol 
(Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Italy, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, 
Spain and Sweden) and nadolol (France). While these pharmacological therapies, originally developed 
for other CV diseases, are partially effective in some but not all patients, there are tolerability issues 
that can limit the possibility to titrate these drugs up to an optimal dose (Papadakis et al. 2020). 
Fatigue and significant reductions in heart rate and blood pressure inhibit their effective use. 
Furthermore, by limiting increases in heart rate response to exercise, they limit functional capacity. 
Patients may also become intolerant when these drugs are used chronically at high doses. Beta-
blockers with vasodilating properties should be avoided, as these can lead to a decrease in peripheral 
vascular resistance (afterload) that can exacerbate obstructive physiology in oHCM.
Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB): Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers inhibit calcium entry into excitable cells and thus blunt the ability of calcium to serve as an 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 15/277
intracellular messenger (Elliott et al. 2014; Ommen et al. 2020). Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers have a limited role in the treatment of symptomatic oHCM due to the fact that their potentially 
beneficial, negative inotropic effects are partially counteracted by their gradient-enhancing vasodilatory 
properties and negative effects on cardiac conduction. As a result, guidelines suggest caution in the 
use of these agents in oHCM with significant gradients due to their potential adverse hemodynamic 
effects (Gersh et al., 2011; Houston & Stevens, 2014). Like beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers 
can cause adverse hemodynamic effects due to vasodilating properties, and patients may become 
intolerant when they are used chronically at high doses. 
Anti-arrhythmic disopyramide: Disopyramide is a class IA anti-arrhythmic drug that is only 
recommended in the symptomatic oHCM population as add-on therapy for patients who do not obtain 
adequate relief of symptoms from the use of beta-blockers or CCBs alone. It has been shown to be 
effective in reducing LVOT obstruction and improving symptoms, likely through its negative inotropic 
effects. However, its use is limited by safety and tolerability concerns related to its anti-cholinergic side 
effects, and QT prolongation (Spoladore et al., 2012).
Nonpharmacological, invasive therapies, including septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation 
(ASA), are available for patients with LVOT gradient ≥50 mmHg, NYHA Class III or IV, and/or 
recurrent exertional syncope despite maximal pharmacological therapy (Elliott et al. 2014). These 
procedures can be effective in reducing obstruction and improving LV outflow. However, they do not 
address the underlying myocardial disease and are not a permanent treatment, as residual or 
recurrent obstruction may occur and/or underlying diastolic dysfunction with symptoms may remain 
(Osman et al., 2019). Furthermore, these therapeutic options require specialized clinical settings and 
experienced surgeons with multidisciplinary teams that may not be available to all patients (Elliott et 
al. 2014; Ommen et al. 2020; Houston and Stevens 2014). For patients with end-stage disease, 
orthotopic cardiac transplantation is the only effective treatment option.
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD): An ICD may be considered in HCM to prevent SCD. 
The ESC has developed an SCD risk calculator to inform recommendations for ICD implantation. 
The main goals of treatment in HCM are control of symptoms and improvement of exercise limitation, 
abolition or reduction of dynamic intraventricular gradients, treatment of LV dysfunction and heart 
failure, control of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias, and prevention of cardioembolism 
(Ammirati et al., 2016). Despite maximally tolerated treatment with current therapeutic options, many 
patients continue to show pathophysiological evidence of disease (e.g., LVOT gradient > 50 mmHg, 
systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, enlarged atria, elevated cardiac biomarkers) and/or 
impaired function (NYHA Class II-III and reduced patient-reported health status). 
Patients with oHCM experience considerable symptoms, functional impairment, and poor quality of life. 
In a recent patient-focused meeting on HCM, 53% of patients reported that their medical treatment 
had “helped somewhat,” leaving many patients without treatment regimens that provide consistent 
and meaningful relief of their symptoms (Patient-Focused Drug Development Meeting on HCM, 26 June 
2020) (Zaiser et al. 2020).
Therefore, the limited pharmacological and surgical options to treat the chronic and progressive 
symptomology of oHCM leave a significant treatment gap for oHCM patients and an unmet medical 
need for a targeted therapy that addresses the underlying disease pathophysiology of oHCM.

Mavacamten is a selective, allosteric, and reversible cardiac myosin inhibitor. Mavacamten modulates 
the number of myosin heads that can enter power-generating states, thus reducing (or in HCM 
normalizing) the probability of force-producing systolic and residual diastolic cross-bridge formation. 
Mavacamten also shifts the overall myosin population towards an energy-sparing but recruitable, 
super-relaxed state. Excess cross-bridge formation and dysregulation of the super-relaxed state of 
myosin are mechanistic hallmarks of HCM, which can result in hyper-contractility, impaired relaxation, 
excess energy consumption, and myocardial wall stress. In HCM patients, cardiac myosin inhibition 
with mavacamten normalises contractility, reduces dynamic LVOT obstruction, and improves cardiac 
filling pressures and biomarkers of cardiac stress, improving symptoms and exercise capacity.
The approved indication is:

2.3.2.  Active substance
General information
The chemical name of mavacamten is 6-[[(1S)-1-phenylethyl]amino]-3-propan-2-yl-1H-pyrimidine-
2,4-dione corresponding to the molecular formula C15H19N3O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 
273.33 g/mol and the following structure:
Figure 1: active substance structure
The chemical structure of mavacamten was elucidated by a combination of tests.  Spectroscopic tests, 
including 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), and 
ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), confirmed the linkage of the atoms and expected functional groups. 
Elemental analysis and mass spectrometry (MS) confirmed the molecular formula and molecular 
weight. Mavacamten exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centres. Single crystal 
X-ray diffraction confirmed the absolute stereochemistry of the one chiral centre in mavacamten.
The active substance is a white to off-white non-hygroscopic solid. In all aqueous conditions and non-
polar organic solvents, mavacamten is practically insoluble; mavacamten is freely soluble in polar 
organic solvents. 
Extensive polymorph screening experiments have been performed using vapor diffusion, evaporation, 
polymer-induced crystallization, cooling, slurry conversion, anti-solvent addition, and reverse anti-
solvent addition.  Polymorph type A is controlled at the level of the active substance by XRPD.
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls
Mavacamten is synthesized in five main steps using three well defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications.
One manufacturing site is proposed for the synthesis and manufacturing of the intermediates and 
active substance and one site for its micronisation.
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances.
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. 
Throughout the development of the mavacamten active substance manufacturing process, the 
synthetic route has remained unchanged. Modifications and improvements were made to the process 
to facilitate scale-up and establish appropriate controls. 
Although multivariate experiments were conducted to understand the impact of different factors in the 
synthetic route, no design space or model-based controls are claimed by the applicant. During the 
procedure, it has been clarified that normal operating ranges of all non-critical process parameters are 
fixed.
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process.
Mavacamten  active  substance  is  packaged  in  closed  double  polyethylene  bags  within  high-density 
polyethylene  drums.  The  double  polyethylene  bags  comply  with  the  EC  directive  2002/72/EC  and  EC 
10/2011 as amended.

The active substance specification is considered acceptable and have been set based on relevant 
guidelines and batch data. The limits for assay and residue on ignition have been tightened, as 
requested.
Limits for impurities have been set in line with ICH Q3E. One of the specified impurities is controlled at 
the qualification threshold limit according to ICH Q3A, and was qualified in a 13-week oral toxicity 
study in rats.
Adequate justification was provided also for those parameters that were intentionally not included in 
the specification such as elemental impurities and potentially mutagenic impurities. The analytical 
methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed. The parameters tested are the 
same as for release, with the exception that identification, residue on ignition and residual solvents 
were not tested; this is accepted as these are not stability indicating.  The analytical methods used 
were the same as for release and were stability indicating.
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. 
Results on stress conditions, with stability samples packaged in covered glass vessels were also 
provide on two batches. 
All tested parameters during long term, photostability and stress conditions were within the 
specifications. The indicative stability nature of the used HPLC method is also properly demonstrated.
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed manufacturer is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed 
container with no specific storage conditions.

The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate-release capsule in four 
strengths: 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg, based on the properties of the active substance, intended 
use, characterisation of the finished product and intended patient population. The pharmaceutical 
development focused on those critical quality attributes (CQAs) that could be impacted by the finished 
product formulation or manufacturing process, namely: assay, content uniformity and dissolution. A 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 20/277
risk assessment of the active substance attributes was performed to evaluate the impact that each 
attribute could have on the finished product CQAs. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph Error! Reference source not found.of this 
report.
Excipient compatibility with the active substance was evaluated. The early development formulations 
were manufactured with mavacamten as an oral suspension, followed by tablets and capsules. Two 
capsule formulations were used during development. Capsule 1, based on the tablet formulation, was 
used during Phase 2 and initial Phase 3 clinical studies; Capsule 1 formulation was then optimised into 
Capsule 2, which was used primarily in the Phase 3 clinical studies. In the revised Capsule 2 
formulation, the same excipients of Capsule 1 were used, The dissolution method was developed in 
parallel to the development of the formulation. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method was 
demonstrated by the evaluation of the impact on the dissolution profiles of different particle size of the 
active substance and different binder and lubricant levels. 
Since both Capsule 1 and Capsule 2 formulations were used for the pivotal Phase 3 study, a relative 
bioavailability study was carried out confirming bioavailability similarity for Capsule 1 and Capsule 2 
formulations. Dissolution data were presented in order to support the bridge in between the lower 
strengthof Capsule 1 and Capsule 2 formulations and within the formulations.
To address a multidisciplinary major objection (MO), a bioequivalence study has been conducted . The 
multidisciplinary major objection is considered resolved from the quality perspective.
The commercial manufacturing process for mavacamten capsules is comprised of conventional wet 
granulation, blending and encapsulation steps. Process conditions were identified through a systematic, 
risk-based approach. Based on these studies, a robust finished product manufacturing process for 
mavacamten capsules was developed that consistently produces a finished product that meets the 
defined CQAs. 
The primary packaging is polyvinylchloride (PVC) / polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) / aluminium foil 
blister. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls
The manufacturing process consists of 8 main steps:  pre-blending, wet granulation, fluid bed drying, 
milling, final blending and lubrication, encapsulation and packaging. The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process, using standard unit operations and established equipment.
A description of the manufacturing process was presented and is considered acceptable. 
The process parameters and in-process controls (IPCs) are in general set in line with the results of 
pharmaceutical development studies.  The IPCs are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.
The specifications and certificates of analysis for bulk product packaging materials were submitted, as 
requested.
Full process validation has not been carried out. This approach is considered acceptable based on a 
detailed pre-validation risk assessment, process validation scheme in 3.2.R, and the fact that a solid

tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form:    appearance  (visual),  water  content  (by  volumetric  Karl  Fischer 
titration), identification, assay and impurities (specified, unspecified, total, all by HPLC (RT and UV)), 
uniformity  of  dosage  units  (content  uniformity),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.,  HPLC/UV),  microbiological 
examination (Ph. Eur.).
The proposed specification for the finished product is in line with ICH Q6A, and it is acceptable for this 
type of dosage form. The specification parameters, analytical methods and acceptance criteria were 
satisfactorily described and justified. The limit for water was tightened, as requested.
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing.
The limit for individual unspecified impurities was tightened in line with the requirements of ICH Q3B 
based on mavacamten maximum daily dose of 15 mg, as requested. Furthermore, two impurities were 
specified in the finished product specification with an acceptable limit , applicable for each. This is 
accepted.Upon request, the applicant provided additional dissolution data generated with the proposed 
commercial dissolution method; the dissolution limit was requested to be tightened for all strengths. A 
tighter specification limit for two strengths only was proposed and accepted. Based on additional 
dissolution data for the remaining two strengths the proposed limit was considered justified.
The parameters excluded from the finished product specification (i.e. chiral purity, residual solvents, 
elemental impurities, and potentially mutagenic impurities) were sufficiently justified.
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on each component of the capsules on one batch of the finished product using a validated ICP-MS 
method were provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 
30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it can be 
concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. 
As requested by the CHMP in a MO, the risk assessment concerning the potential presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been updated during the procedure to consider in 
the risk assessment all suspected and actual root causes, in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and 
the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine 
impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the updated, more detailed 
risk assessment, the additional data provided on the individual components and the literature 
references, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the 
related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

2.4.  Non-clinical aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
Mavacamten (formerly known as MYK-461) is a novel small molecule specifically designed to directly 
modulate systolic and diastolic cardiac function at the source within the cardiomyocyte by selectively 
(but reversibly) inhibiting the enzymatic activity of myosin (adenosine triphosphate [ATP] turnover 
kinetics), the motor unit of the cardiac sarcomere.
In cardiac muscle, electrical depolarization and calcium (Ca2+) entry into the myocytes (the targets of 
traditional inotropic agents) facilitates the activation of the sarcomeres, exposing myosin-binding sites 
on actin and initiating the molecular cascade that translates chemical energy into mechanical force. 
This fundamental force-producing process, known as myosin’s chemo mechanical cycle, describes the 
conformational changes of each myosin motor as it 1) hydrolyses the high-energy ATP nucleotide into 
adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi); 2) transitions (as Pi is released) into a 
strongly bound cross-bridge with actin (“on-actin”), inducing a power stroke that provides contractile 
force and determines systolic kinetics; and 3) following ADP release, detaches from actin, determining 
the kinetics of diastolic relaxation. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that mavacamten directly slows 
cardiac myofibrillar ATP turnover (and therefore reduces cardiac contractile force) by allosterically 
inhibiting the release of Pi from myosin following ATP hydrolysis. This mode of inhibition prevents 
myosin from entering strongly bound “on-actin” states, effectively reducing the number of myosin 
heads that can form force producing cross-bridges, and thus, directly decreases sarcomere activity, 
myofilament tension, and at the ensemble level, overall myocyte systolic function. At rest, 
mavacamten also shifts the population of myosin heads readily available to interact with actin toward 
an energy-sparing “reserve” state with ultra-low ATP consumption rates, known as the super-relaxed 
(SRX) state. Under normal physiology, only a small fraction of all available myosin motors engages 
with actin during a cardiac cycle; the remainder are either primed for action, readily available to form 
cross-bridges, in a state known as the disordered-relaxed (DRX) state, or are sequestered, in reserve, 
in the SRX state. Mutations in genes encoding cardiac sarcomeric proteins, such as the myosin heavy 
chain (MHC) (MYH7 in humans/pigs and MYH6 in rodents) and myosin-binding protein-C (MYBPC3), 
contribute to functional derangements by releasing excess myosin heads from the SRX state favouring 
the formation of excess cross-bridges and increasing overall ATP use. In this setting, mavacamten has 
been shown to normalize (increase) the SRX population, restoring altered cross bridge kinetics and 
rescuing diastolic impairments. As such, mavacamten directly regulates cross bridge dynamics, and 
therefore can directly modulate cardiac systolic/diastolic behaviour in vivo. Mavacamten can also both 
normalize the excess residual cross-bridges that impair relaxation in HCM and reduce the heart’s 
energy burden. Mavacamten’s ability to decrease or, in HCM, normalize the number of available actin-
binding myosin heads has been confirmed via biomechanical studies in skinned ventricular fibres 
across multiple species, including minipigs with pathogenic HCM mutations. Overall, mavacamten 
normalized the sarcomeres’ enhanced sensitivity to Ca2+ in HCM, directly blunting hyperactivity, while 
preventing the excess diastolic tension caused by residual cross bridges. In cardiac myocytes, 
mavacamten decreases contraction in a dose-dependent manner, while increasing diastolic (resting) 
lengths and accelerating relaxation without impacting Ca2+ flux or electrical de-/re-polarization.

Therefore, targeted myosin inhibition with mavacamten results in a novel pharmacological profile: 
direct attenuation of contractile force at the sarcomere level which, unlike any traditional negative 
inotrope, occurs concomitantly with decreased diastolic tension and stresses due to a reduction in the 
number of residual (diastolic) cross-bridges.
2.4.2.  Pharmacology
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies
In vitro, mavacamten was demonstrated to be a selective and reversible inhibitor of basal cardiac 
myosin from bovine and human (IC50: 0.27 ± 0.02 μM and 0.52±0,09 μM, respectively) in absence of 
Ca2+ and in Ca2+-dependent regulated conditions (IC50: 0.53 ± 0.02 μM and 0.53±0.08 μM, 
respectively). Mavacamten inhibition of cardiac myosin was therefore achieved by inhibiting both basal 
ATPase activity as well as actin- and/or calcium activated ATPase rates. ATP turnover was decreased at 
both systolic and diastolic calcium levels. Inhibitory effects were reversible after rapid dilution. 
Modest inhibition in fast skeletal muscle myosin from rabbit (basal IC50: 4.71 ± 0.20 μM) but not 
chicken smooth muscle was observed, suggesting specificity towards cardiac myosin. In contrast, 
mavacamten inhibited myosin in slow skeletal muscle (bovine masseter, IC50: 0.43 ± 0.05 μM). 
Binding to human myosin in known hypertrophy cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutations (R403Q, R453C, 
R719W, R723G, and G741E in MYH7) was in the low micromolar range (wild-type myosin 0.91 ± 0.047 
μM and ranging from 0.65-1.31 μM for the mutations. In common laboratory animals, binding of 
mavacamten to cardiac myofibrils led to potent inhibition, similar to human myosin (IC50: 0.71 μM); in 
dog, rabbit, rat and mouse IC50 were 0.49 μM, 0.76 μM, 0.32 μM and 0.29 μM, respectively. 
Mavacamten was able to dose dependently displace actin fibers in an IVM assay (EC50: 0.14 ± 0.05 
µm) which was proportional to the dose-dependent reduction in gliding velocity (EC50: 0.24 ± 
0.05µm). In the loaded motility assay, a single concentration of mavacamten resulted in reduced 
power (up to 38 ± 7%), likely due to inhibiting the formation of active cross-bridges. Mavacamten was 
shown to dose dependently reduce myosin activity in the DRX state and increased the population of 
myosin in the SRX state. These effects were partially reversible by addition of either ADP or Ca2+ in 
presence of mavacamten. 
The mode of action of mavacamten was also investigated in human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes 
where mavacamten dose dependently decreased contractility. A maximum effect was reached after 20 
minutes for all concentrations tested (0.1-5 µM, IC50: 0.204µM). Beating rate was increased at all 
concentrations up to 1 µM where maximum contraction was reached. Mavacamten also dose 
dependently decreased sarcomere shortening during contraction and relaxation and increased the 
duration of contraction and relaxation as previously observed in bovine and rodent cardiac cells. 
Ex-vivo experiments in rat, using healthy left ventricular myocytes incubated with mavacamten 
showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the shortening fraction and contraction velocity (IC50: 0.25μM), 
with maximal inhibition occurring at 3µM. The effects of mavacamten were independent of Ca2+ 
signalling and could be reversed by incubation with a β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. Collectively 
these data demonstrated that mavacamten reduced contractility by a mechanism distinct from 
negative inotropes, which act by modulating calcium flux. Similarly, mavacamten dose dependently 
decreased tension in skinned left ventricular papillary muscle of rat and mini-pig independent of Ca2+ 
concentration. 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 25/277
In rat primary left ventricular myocytes, incubation of a single (0.25 µM) concentration of mavacamten 
resulted in the functional inhibition of the cardiac cells by reducing shortening fraction and velocity 
while accelerating relaxation. This state was reversed by co-incubation with isoproterenol, while 
maintaining lusitropy. Systolic and diastolic calcium-transient amplitudes were not affected by 
incubation with mavacamten. In isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, mavacamten decreased 
inotropic indices (lower maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure, lower developed pressures) 
while accelerating relaxation without altering heart rate. Mavacamten also reduced end-diastolic 
pressures as well as estimated end-diastolic stiffness. Co-incubation with isoproterenol did not alter 
these responses. 
Transgenic mice with mutations in troponin T resulting in pathogenic HCM phenotypes which displayed 
marked diastolic dysfunction with minimal fibrosis, were administered 0.83 mg/kg/day for 6 months. 
Mavacamten improved diastolic function while preserving fractional shortening. Administration of a 
mavacamten analog dose dependently hastened isovolumic relaxation and increased mitral-annulus 
early displacement. Together, these data suggest a proof of concept for the use of mavacamten in 
improving HCM in patients.   
In summary, the mode of action of mavacamten as an inhibitor of myosin on cardiac muscle which 
decreases overall ATP turnover (utilization) at the sarcomere and blunts the responses of the cardiac 
myofilament to mechanical stresses, triggering direct, sarcomere-targeted, negative inotropy while 
both decreasing diastolic tensions and accelerating relaxation due to the reduction of residual cross-
bridges has been sufficiently demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Mavacamten was able to improve HCM 
phenotype in a transgenic mouse, thus further lending support to the proof of concept for mavacamten 
as a therapy in HCM.
 Secondary pharmacodynamic studies
A kinome diversity screen (143 targets evaluated) was conducted to identify off-target binding after 
incubation with 10µM mavacamten. None of the targets showed relevant inhibition with rat GABAa 
showing a maximum inhibition of 38% at this concentration. Cytotoxicity of mavacamten was 
evaluated across 13 different cell lines following incubation for 48 hours at different concentrations. No 
meaningful cytotoxicity was induced by mavacamten in any cell line at any concentration. Literature 
evidence suggests that, while mavacamten binds to both myosin of smooth and skeletal muscle in 
vitro, there was no effect on skeletal performance at clinically relevant exposures. This was also 
reflected in the safety pharmacology studies which were devoid of notable effects on experiments 
which included forelimb/hindlimb grip strength as variables. Finally, literature evidence suggests a role 
for mavacamten in targeted myosin inhibition to correct both contractile and relaxation/filling 
deficiencies, thereby reducing myocardial stresses.
2.4.2.2.  Safety pharmacology programme
CNS safety in vivo
Rats administered 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg mavacamten did not show overt signs of CNS 
involvement in a standardized test battery including a functional observation battery or in evaluation of 
motor activity. A slight decrease in body temperature of 1°C was noted in the high dose group. The 
clinical relevance of this finding is unknown.
Cardiovascular safety in vitro
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 26/277
Minimal but statistically significant increased hERG inhibition of 5% and 9.6% in HEK293 cells was 
noted at 10µM and 60µM, respectively, compared to controls (1%). In contrast, the positive control 
terfenadine achieved a hERG inhibition of 80%. In subsequent assays with HEK293, rabbit purkinje 
fibers or stem cell-derived human cardiomyocytes, hERG showed comparable minimal inhibition at 
concentrations above 10 µM. The primary metabolite of mavacamten (MYK-1078) inhibited hERG by 
4% at 40 µM. Prolonged incubation (16 hours) over a mavacamten or MYK-1078 concentration range 
(0.1-30 µM) similarly did not result in an appreciable inhibition of hERG channels. However, incubation 
with 30µM mavacamten for 48 hours resulted in 31.5% hERG inhibition. Neither mavacamten nor MYK-
1078 produced statistically significant decreases in hERG surface expression, but not at levels to 
suggest activity as hERG trafficking inhibitors. Overall, it is not expected that mavacamten nor its 
primary metabolite would have the potential to inhibit hERG at clinically relevant concentrations based 
on in vitro data. 
In HEK 293 and human ventricular myocytes, effects of mavacamten and MYK-1078 on action potential 
duration (APD) and acute and longer-term effects (48 hours incubation) on Nav1.5-late, Cav1.2, 
Kir6.2/SUR2A (IKatp), IKs, IK1, IKur, and Ito currents were evaluated across a concentration range 
(0.3-3-10-30 µM). Mavacamten dose dependently decreased APD in human myocytes (healthy and 
hypertrophied) and decreased AP triangulation. This was attributed to an increased inhibition of the 
late component of the sodium current (INa-late current) compared to its ability to block IKr, which was 
demonstrated in both healthy and hypertrophied human heart myocytes. In contrast, MYK-1078 
moderately increased APD and mildly increased AP triangulation as result of increased IKr blockade 
compared to its ability to block INa-late. Comparing effects in healthy heart cells with diseased cells, 
mavacamten reduced INaL current more robustly in diseased cells. Neither mavacamten nor MYK-1078 
affected the maximum AP upstroke velocity. Mavacamten did not significantly decrease hKv4.3-WT 
(voltage gated potassium channel) surface expression across a dose range of 0.01-30 µM, thus 
suggesting mavacamten is not a hKv4.3 trafficking inhibitor.
The APD shortening effects of mavacamten were also examined in healthy myocytes treated with 10nM 
dofetilide (a selective IKr antagonist). Dofetilide induced prolongation of the APD was subsequently 
reduced by incubation with mavacamten. Acute effects of mavacamten on ion channels showed no 
appreciable inhibition. At 30 µM, mavacamten changed ion current amplitudes ranging from +4.3% 
(Kir6.2/SUR2A) to -40.4% (Nav1.5, late). Similar modulation of ion currents was observed after 
prolonged incubation. The APD shortering profile without indications of proarrhythmic risk was also 
predicted in an in silico model. 
No effects on resting membrane potential nor action potential parameters were observed in rabbit 
purkinje fibers incubated with mavacamten below 10µM. At 30 μM, a slight decrease in action potential 
duration at 50% of repolarization was observed but was not considered to be suggestive of an 
arrhythmogenic profile. MYK-1078 did not alter action potential duration in rabbit purkinje fibers and 
was thus also not considered to be arrhythmogenic. In stem cell-derived human cardiomycytes, 
mavacamten, MYK-1078 and a mavacamten analog (MYK 581) were shown to decrease cell motion. 
Short term incubation with mavacamten did not affect cardiac sodium channels but did so after 48 
hours in a dose dependent fashion. However, this is paralleled by the changes in basal impedance 
twitch amplitude and subsequent twitch duration. Mavacamten nor its primary metabolite showed 
overt dysrhythmic activity in stem cell derived cardiomyocytes.  
Cardiovascular and respiratory safety in vivo
Mavacamten administration to dogs and rats resulted in non-adverse changes of QTc. In the GLP 
compliant cardiovascular safety pharmacology, dogs dosed with 3 or 10 mg/kg but not 1 mg/kg 
developed dose dependent decreases in blood pressure and pulse pressure with compensatory 
increases in heart rate which were maintained for up to one week post dose. At 10 mg/kg QTc 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 27/277
prolongation at 1 week post dose, as well as increased respiratory rated and decreased tidal volume 
for up to 24 hours post dose were seen. The risk for mavacamten producing arrhythmia of either 
torsadogenic or non-torsadogenic origin was considered to be limited because ventricular restitution 
(QT/TQ) remained well below 1.0, which is the ratio of concern for reentrant arrhythmia. The ability of 
mavacamten to trigger an adaptive electrophysiological response in healthy hearts resulting in QT 
prolongation after sustained exposure was further evaluated in non-GLP studies in dog and rat. In the 
dog study, animals received 0 mg/kg PO bid on day 1, 1.5 mg/kg PO bid on day 2 and 0.3 mg/kg/day 
PO on days 3-15. The anticipated pharmacological effects of mavacamten (fractional shortening and 
increased left-ventricular end-diastolic dimensions) were also accompanied at first by a shortening of 
the QT-interval, but by the end of the study this turned into a statistically significant mild to moderate 
QTc prolongation (+19 ms (274 vs 255msc predose at the end of the study). The QT-prolongation was 
attributed primarily to lengthening of JTp interval (+19 ms on Day 15, 162 vs 144 ms predose) with 
negligible changes in the terminal portion of the T-wave suggesting preserved transmural 
repolarization and preserved late repolarizing currents. No changes in PR or QRS interval was noted 
which would suggest cardiac conduction. There were no additional notable findings for other 
haemodynamic parameters. From 3 mg/kg onward, cardiovascular effects were accompanied by 
vomiting, decreased activity, rapid breathing and decreased food consumption. At 10 mg/kg, animals 
had an increased respiratory rate and a decrease in tidal volume. 
In the rat study, animals received 2 or 4 mg/kg/day for 7 days. In addition to the anticipated 
pharmacological effects, mavacamten statistically increased QT-intervals which were linearly correlated 
with increased left-ventricular end-diastolic dimensions. QT-prolongation was accompanied by 
downregulation of genes encoding Ito and IKATP currents. 
Acute QT shortening, and longer-term QT prolongation was the result of adaptive responses to 
sustained myosin inhibition in ventricles with normal physiology due to changes in early repolarization 
currents, primarily by downregulation of the Ito and IKATP potassium channels in response to 
sustained myosin inhibition. In contrast, in HCM both these currents are already abrogated. Thus, it is 
considered that there is a decreased sensitivity of HCM hearts to mechanisms which lead to QT-
prolongation after exposure to mavacamten in the healthy heart.
2.4.2.3.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions
Because mavacamten is intended as monotherapy, no pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were 
performed.
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics
Methods of analysis
Concentrations of mavacamten (MYK-461) and MYK-460 were measured in plasma of mice, rats, 
rabbits and dogs with validated LC-MS/MS methods. The methods were validated over the range of 
1-2000 ng/mL. The validation was adequate regarding calibration, accuracy, precision, matrix effect, 
dilution integrity and stability. The methods used in the pharmacokinetic studies were considered fit for 
purpose.
Absorption
In vitro studies in Caco-2 cells showed high permeability and a low efflux ratio for mavacamten, 
indicating that the P-gp substrate potential is low.
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 28/277
Single dose pharmacokinetics were investigated in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. Tmax after oral 
administration was 0.5 h in mice, 0.7 – 2.7 h in rats, 0.3 – 0.5 h in dogs and 0.7 h in monkeys. AUC 
and Cmax increased generally dose-proportionally in rats (dose range 1 to 10 mg/kg) and dogs (dose 
range 0.1 to 3 mg/kg), except that Cmax increased slightly less than dose-proportionally in dogs. Oral 
bioavailability compared to IV administration was complete in mice and 75%, 87% and 47% in rats, 
dogs and monkeys respectively. Volume of distribution was 3.8 L/kg in mice, 5.0 – 9.0 L/kg in rats, 7.0 
L/kg in dogs and 11 L/kg in monkeys, which is beyond total body water in all species. After a single 
oral dose, clearance was 7.7 mL/min/kg in mice, 3.7 – 11 mL/min/kg in rats, 0.6 mL/min/kg in dogs 
and 3.0 mL/min/kg in monkeys, which is, respectively, about 8.5%, 10.6% <2% and 6.8% of liver 
blood flow. Elimination half-life was longer in dogs (130 – 161 h) than in other species (4.2 – 7.0 h in 
mice, 8.2 – 26 h in rats and 43 – 45 h in monkeys).
In a study in rats in which portal vein and femoral vein were cannulated, similar concentration-time 
profiles in portal vein and femoral vein indicate no relevant first pass effect in rats.
In multiple dose toxicokinetic studies, exposure to mavacamten increased approximately dose-
proportionally in mice and dogs and dose-proportionally or slightly more than dose-proportionally in 
rats (especially at the later time points). In mice, slight accumulation was observed (accumulation 
ratio up to 1.8). In rats and dogs, significant accumulation was observed (up to approximately 6-fold in 
rats and up to approximately 9-fold in dogs). In rats, accumulation was observed up to 90 days, but 
not or only to a limited extent thereafter. In dogs, accumulation was observed primarily in the first half 
of the studies and not or limited thereafter. No consistent gender effect was observed in mice and 
dogs. In rats, exposure was slightly higher in females (maximally up to two-fold) at doses larger than 
1 mg/kg. This can possibly be explained by a generally higher rate of metabolism in male rats and is 
not likely to be relevant for humans.
In rats, exposure was reduced in fed rats compared to fasted rats (ratio fed/fasted was 76% based on 
AUC0-24 and 69% based on AUC0-∞). In dogs, exposure was similar for fed and fasted dogs based on 
AUC0-96. Based on AUC0-∞, relative bioavailability fed/fasted was 1.23 i.e. exposure was slightly higher 
in fed dogs compared to fasted dogs. Overall, there does not appear to be a clear food effect in the 
investigated animals.
The effect of different formulations on bioavailability was investigated in dogs. The bioavailability of 
mavacamten administered via capsules to dogs increased from 16% to 64% when mavacamten was 
micronized, reducing particle size from 88 µm to 4 µm. Also among the liquid suspension formulations, 
bioavailability was higher (increasing from 35% to 107%) at smaller particle size (decreased from 300 
µm to 4 µm).
Distribution
In mice, plasma and heart tissue concentration-time profiles were investigated. Concentrations of 
mavacamten in heart tissue were approximately 3.5 x plasma concentrations after single oral dose and 
2 – 3 x plasma concentrations after repeated dosing for 5 days. Heart tissue concentrations in mice did 
not increase over 5 days daily dosing of 2.5 mg/kg/day.
In a single dose oral tissue distribution study in pigmented rats, mavacamten-related radioactivity was 
widely and rapidly distributed. Peak concentrations were mostly achieved at 0.5 h after dosing. 
Radioactivity was highest in diaphragm, oesophagus, kidneys, liver, myocardium, salivary glands, 
adrenal glands, skeletal muscle, small intestine and stomach mucosa. Low levels were found in the 
CNS, which were below or almost below LOQ at 720 h after dosing. In non-pigmented skin, levels were 
comparable to pigmented skin, indicating no binding to melanin. In eyes of non-pigmented rats, peak 
levels in uveal tract were around half the peak levels in pigmented rats, indicating limited binding to 
melanin. In several organs / tissues, measurable levels were still found at 720 h after dosing, such as 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 29/277
diaphragm, eye uveal tract, kidneys and myocardium. Due to its presence in skin and eye, 
mavacamten should be investigated for its phototoxic potential. In a multiple-dose tissue distribution 
study in rats, concentrations in organs and tissues were generally slightly lower on day 7 than on day 
1. Tissue to plasma ratios were approximately 3 in liver, kidney and oesophagus, 10 in myocardium 
and extensor digitorum longus muscle and 20 in soleus muscle. 
In dogs, the distribution of mavacamten in cardiac and skeletal muscle was investigated after a single 
oral dose of 1.5 – 30 mg/kg. Concentrations at 7 days were similar between left ventricle, soleus 
muscle and extensor digitorum longus muscle, except at the highest dose of 30 mg/kg, where 
concentrations in the muscles were lower than in left ventricle but at this dose, dogs were euthanized 
in moribund condition at 1 h after dosing. 
Protein binding of mavacamten-related radioactivity in plasma of mouse, rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey 
and human was 84%, 89%, 91%, 95% and 93% respectively and not concentration-dependent from 
0.2 to 10 µM. 
Blood-to-plasma ratios in blood from mouse, rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey and human were reported 
as 0.72, 0.82, 0.78, 0.82 and 0.79 in mouse, rat (~33%), dog (~25%), monkey and human (~30% in 
RBC). In an in vivo study in rats, a time effect in blood to plasma ratios was observed, with blood to 
plasma ratios lower than 1 shortly after administration and higher than 1 from one week after 
administration. 
Placental transfer and excretion in milk were not studied.
Metabolism
After in vitro incubation of [14C]mavacamten with liver microsomes or hepatocytes from mouse, rat, 
dog, monkey, and human, low levels of metabolites were found. In microsomes, less than 7.5% was 
metabolized. In hepatocytes, up to 20% was metabolized. Levels of metabolites were generally <5% 
of total radioactivity except for M4 in rat hepatocyte incubations which was found at 9% of total 
radioactivity. Metabolites found in human microsomes and hepatocytes were M1, M2 and M6 (<1% 
each). These metabolites were also found in the non-clinical species, except for dog hepatocytes where 
only M6 was found. M1 and M2 are both hydroxylated metabolites and M6 is formed by N-dealkylation 
of the phenylethyl group. M4 which was found in rat hepatocytes only, is a glucuronide of M1.
In an in vivo study in rats, parent compound was the main component in plasma, comprising 45% and 
67% of total radioactivity in orally and IV dosed rats, respectively. In IV dosed rats, 2% of metabolite 
M1 was found. In plasma of orally dosed rats, none of the identified metabolites were found. A large 
part of mavacamten-related radioactivity in plasma appears unidentified (in orally dosed rats more 
than half of total radioactivity). Study NC-20-0025 contains information regarding identified and 
unidentified metabolites found in urine and bile, but there is no information regarding unidentified 
metabolites found in plasma. In urine, low amounts of parent compound were found (6-7% of total 
radioactivity). Metabolites found in urine were M1 (44% after oral and 19% after IV administration), 
M2 (14% oral and 8% IV), M4 (IV 24%, oral only minor amount) and unidentified metabolite c (16% 
oral, 14% IV) and small amounts of M8 and several unidentified metabolites. In bile, only a small 
amount of parent compound was found (3.9%). Main metabolite in bile was M4 (glucuronide of M1, 
56%), followed by M8 and M1 (11% and 10%) and a low amount of M2. Also a considerable amount of 
unidentified metabolite i was found (25%), which most likely is a glucuronide linked metabolite, as well 
as minor amounts of several other unidentified metabolites. 
In a 6-week study in rats, percentages of MYK-460 relative to mavacamten in plasma of rats (0.18 – 
0.44% for Cmax and 0.03 – 0.26% for AUC) were similar to the amount of MYK-460 present at the 
start of the study (0.22%), indicating no conversion of mavacamten to MYK-460 in vivo in rats. In 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 30/277
dogs, percentages of MYK-460 relative to mavacamten on day 1 were somewhat higher (0.51 – 1.7%) 
than the amount of MYK-460 present at the start of the study (0.21%). The ratio of MYK-460 to 
mavacamten did however not increase over a period of 6 weeks.
Excretion
After oral administration to bile duct-intact rats, 58% was excreted in faeces, 23% in urine and 1.7% 
in expired air. After IV administration to bile duct-cannulated rats, 41% was excreted in bile, 7.6% in 
faeces and 31% in urine. A total of 8% was recovered from carcass and 6% from other sources such 
as cage rinse and cage wash. The recovery was at least 94% and therefore sufficient.
2.4.4.  Toxicology
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity
In a non-GLP oral toxicity study with dogs, administration of 30 mg/kg mavacamten resulted in 
extreme hypoactivity, unproductive retching (female only), and decreased capillary refill time (male 
only) approximately 1 hour following dose administration, resulting in animals being sacrificed in 
moribund condition. The doses up to 7 mg/kg were well tolerated without signs of toxicity. Gross 
necropsy and histopathology were not conducted.
2.4.4.2.   Repeat dose toxicity
The pivotal GLP-studies up to 26 and 39 weeks of duration and the highest tested dose level of 3 
mg/kg/day were conducted in rats and dogs, respectively. The main adverse effects seen in both 
species were observed in the heart and are considered related to the primary pharmacodynamic action 
of the substance. Cardiac failure at the top tested dose levels caused increased mortality and early 
euthanasia of the test animals (rats: ≥1.2 mg/kg/day, corresponding to AUC0-24 ≥9150 ng x h/mL; 
dogs: ≥0.45 mg/kg/day (males), corresponding to AUC0-24 = 17200 ng x h/mL). Effects observed in 
other organs and tissues (centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis, centrilobular congestion/vacuolation; 
pulmonary congestion/oedema, spleen oedema) seen in both species are considered secondary to the 
cardiac failure and reduced cardiac output. In rats, adverse heart changes included increased heart 
weight correlated with cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial and endocardial degeneration/inflammation, 
cartilaginous/osseous metaplasia (chorda tendineae) and valvular inflammatory cell 
infiltrate/inflammation. The ventricular and atrial dilatation seen at all dose levels in the 3-months 
study was ascribed by the applicant to an artefact during the tissue processing, as these findings were 
not confirmed in the 26 weeks study at the same dose levels. As the effect was indeed not observed 
upon longer exposure duration at the same dose levels, this is endorsed. Decreased systolic function 
(an increase in end diastolic and systolic chamber size and an associated reduction in indices of global 
left ventricular systolic performance (LV ejection fraction and fractional shortening) was seen in the 
26-week study at the dose level of 1.2 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 of ≥8490 ng x h/mL) which resolved after 
the recovery period. Increased levels of NT-proANP (cardiac biomarker indicative of heart stress) were 
measured (non-GLP) in the 3 months study at the dose level of 2.0/1.2 mg/kg/day at week 6 and at 
the end of dosing. NT-proANP is the biologically inactive fragment of the ANP prohormone which is 
secreted from the heart in response to atrial stretching or through stimulation by angiotensin II and 
endothelin. The most important stimulus for the release of this hormone into circulation is stretching of 
myocyte fibres. The expression and secretion of ANP increase significantly in pathological states 
accompanied by stretching the heart chambers, volume overload, and ischemic injury, such as heart 
failure and myocardial infarction. However, the individual variability in the NT-proANP levels in the 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 31/277
study was high, also in controls and pretest animals, and correlated poorly with histopathological 
findings. The levels of another cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP in the 26 week study at the same dose 
level were not affected. Also slightly higher troponin I levels were measured after the recovery period 
in the 3-months study in four high dose rats; in 3 out of 4 rats this correlated with increased heart 
weights compared to the controls. However, as the increased troponin I levels were seen only after the 
4-week recovery period and no evidence of cardiac necrosis was observed, the relevance of this finding 
is also questionable. 
The findings in dogs were in general comparable to the findings in rats. In general, mostly somewhat 
higher exposure was achieved at the same dose levels in male animals compared to females. Male 
dogs appeared to be more sensitive to mavacamten toxicity, with the dose level of 0.45 mg/kg/day 
causing mortality in the 13-week study in males but not in females (AUC0-24 = 17200 ng x h/mL in 
males vs 12300 ng x h/mL in females). The applicant suggested that this apparently higher male 
sensitivity to toxicity of mavacamten was caused by a higher exposure achieved in male dogs, which is 
supported by the toxicokinetic data from the 6-week and 3-month dog studies. Cardiac failure seen at 
this dose level was consistent with increased NT-proBNP levels in two males, one humanely euthanized 
on day 72 and one euthanized early as scheduled (dosing stopped earlier) on day 74. Therefore the 
highest dose level in the 39-week study was lower in males than in females (0.3 vs 0.45 mg/kg/day). 
Next to histopathological changes, ECG changes (increased heart rate and QTc prolongation) were 
reported starting from the dose level of 0.18 mg/kg/day in the 13- and 39-week studies (AUC0-24 ≥
3800 ng x h/mL); also QRS interval was prolonged in females administered 0.45 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 
= 12500 ng x h/mL) in the 39 week study. The changes were reversible in the recovery animals. It is 
noted that QTc interval prolongation was also seen in the healthy volunteers in the clinical studies and 
was considered to be not related to a direct drug effect on repolarizing currents, but rather to an 
indirect drug effect mediated by the on-target reduction in systolic cardiac function. Exposure to 
mavacamten decreases normal contractility in healthy hearts, whereas it normalizes hypercontractility 
in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Thus the ECG effects seen in healthy animals are not 
expected to be relevant for patients. Cardiac ventricle dilation was seen in the 13-week study at 0.45 
mg/kg/day at the necropsy of the early decedents and in one surviving female. Ventricular dilatation, 
associated with substantial increases in mean left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic and mean LV end-
systolic volumes and a substantial reduction in mean LV ejection fraction, was also seen in the 
echocardiogram evaluation in the high-dose males and females (0.30 and 0.45 mg/kg/day, 
respectively) in the 39-week study. These effects reversed by week 4 of the recovery phase and were 
still absent after 12 weeks of recovery. As the observed ECG changes (increased heart rate and QTc 
prolongation) at 0.18 mg/kg/day were minor and reversible in the recovery animals, the NOAEL in the 
13- and 39-week dog studies was set at 0.18 mg/kg/day (AUC ≥3800 ng x h/mL).
2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity
Mavacamten gave negative results in the Ames test up to the limit concentration of 5000 µg/plate and 
in the in vitro micronucleus assay in human lymphocytes, tested up to cytotoxic concentrations, both 
with and without metabolic activation. An in vivo bone marrow micronucleus test in rats dosed up to 8 
mg/kg (MTD) for 2 consecutive days was negative. As the bone marrow is a highly perfused tissue and 
the test substance was measured in plasma, the bone marrow exposure is considered adequately 
demonstrated. Based on the results of the in vitro and in vivo tests, mavacamten is concluded to be 
not genotoxic.

2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity of mavacamten was studied in the 104-week study with Sprague-Dawley rats and 6 
months study with transgenic RasH2 mice. The maximal achieved exposures (AUC0-24) were 3640 (M) 
and 2810 (F) ng x h/mL in rats and 30000 (M) and 50400 (F) ng x h/mL in mice. Administration of 
mavacamten did not affect survival. No gross necropsy or histopathological lesions were seen in both 
species which were attributed to the treatment. Mavacamten showed no carcinogenic potential when 
administered for 104 weeks to rats or 6 months to transgenic mice. 
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity
In the GLP-compliant FEED study, mavacamten did not show adverse effects on male or female fertility 
and early embryonic development up to the highest tested dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day. The toxicokinetic 
analysis has not been performed in the study; therefore, the applicant estimates the exposure based 
on the results of the 3-month repeated dose toxicity study at which the same dose levels were tested. 
This can be accepted; however, the achieved exposure levels were below the anticipated clinical 
exposure (0.4 and 0.8 in males and females, respectively), and the study as such is therefore 
considered insufficient to draw the conclusion about the potential effects of mavacamten on fertility 
and early embryonic development in the clinical settings. Such a risk is, however, not anticipated 
based on the pharmacological profile of mavacamten and the available data on secondary 
pharmacodynamics.
Developmental toxicity of mavacamten was tested in two GLP-compliant studies with rats and rabbits. 
In rats, increased post-implantation loss and reduced foetal body weight were seen at the dose level of 
1.5 mg/kg/day (maternal AUC0-24 = 16500 ng x h/mL) in the absence of maternal toxicity. Consistent 
with a lower foetal weight, delayed ossification consisting of increased incidences of incomplete 
ossification of cervical and thoracic vertebrae, and paws (phalanxes and metatarsals) was seen at the 
same dose level. At the same dose level, also skeletal and visceral malformations were observed. 
Skeletal malformations were manifested mainly as fused sternebrae (19 foetuses from 10 litters), 
whereas visceral malformations were observed in 2 foetuses from 2 litters and included one complete 
situs inversus and one foetus with the absence of the right atrioventricular valve associated with a 
ventricular septum defect. Although the visceral effects were considered only in two foetuses, they 
were still considered related to the test substance administration based on their nature and the active 
substance pharmacodynamic mode of action; furthermore, situs inversus and a ventricular septum 
effect were also observed in 2 foetuses from 2 litters which were found dead in the pre-and post-natal 
developmental toxicity study. Based on the result of the study, the NOAEL for developmental toxicity 
was set at 0.7 mg/kg/day (maternal AUC0-24 = 5690 ng x h/mL, exposure multiple of the anticipated 
clinical exposure of 0.3), whereas the NOAEL for maternal toxicity was set at the highest tested dose of 
1.5 mg/kg/day (maternal AUC0-24 = 16500 ng x h/mL).
In rabbits, maternal toxicity, manifested as lower body weight gain and lower food consumption, was 
seen from the dose level of 1.2 mg/kg/day (maternal AUC0-24 = 16500 ng x h/mL). At the highest 
tested dose of 2 mg/kg/day 2 females died prematurely; a mild bilateral ventricular dilatation was 
observed in both animals at gross necropsy. There were no effects on the number of corpora lutea, 
post-implantation loss, number of live foetuses or mean foetal weight. External, skeletal and visceral 
malformations were seen from the dose level of 1.2 mg/kg/day. A dose-dependent increase in the 
number of foetuses with cleft palate was seen from 1.2 mg/kg/day. At 2.0 mg/kg/day great vessels 
malformations (dilatation of pulmonary trunk and/or aortic arch) were noted in 4 foetuses from 4 
litters, and fused sternebrae were seen in 38 foetuses from 10 litters. Based on the results of the 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 33/277
study, the NOAEL for both maternal and developmental toxicity was set at the lowest tested dose of 
0.6 mg/kg/day (maternal AUC0-24 = 7160 ng x h/mL). 
In the rabbit study, mavacamten was detected in the embryos and extra-embryonic tissues (foetal 
envelopes, placenta, amniotic fluid) ca. 24 hours after dosing on GD12. Mavacamten was distributed in 
these tissues, with individual embryonic tissue to plasma concentration ratios ranging from 0.09 to 
0.15 across the dose levels; however, as the analyses were not performed under GLP, the results are 
considered to serve indicative purposes only. 
Based on the results of the developmental toxicity studies, mavacamten demonstrated a potential for 
foetal toxicity and teratogenicity in two species and should be regarded as a potential human 
developmental toxicant. The maternal plasma concentrations at the NOAEL were below the anticipated 
clinical exposure at the maximal recommended human dose. Considering that the observed effects 
were seen at maternal exposure levels below the anticipated clinical exposure and the observed effects 
are considered to be related to the pharmacologic mode of action, the use of mavacamten is 
contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of child-beating potential (WOCBP), unless the 
conditions listed in Section 4.6 of SmPC are met.
It is further proposed by the applicant to add the following sentence to the SmPC: “Women of 
childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after 
discontinuation of Camzyos, since it takes approximately 5 half-lives (approximately 45 days for 
CYP2C19 normal metabolisers and 115 days for CYP2C19 poor metabolisers) to eliminate mavacamten 
from the body after treatment discontinuation (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).” Therefore, before initiation 
of treatmentin women of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test result must be available and 
counselling should be provided regarding the serious risk to the foetus. The period of 6 months has 
been calculated as a 5 half-life times of mavacamten in poor CYP2C19 metabolizers. While this is 
endorsed, it is noted that the half-life times are calculated based on the single dose studies, and for 
mavacamten significant accumulation after repeated dosing was noted (up to factor 8 in humans). The 
applicant was asked to justify whether a period of 5 half-life times is sufficient, considering 
accumulation of mavacamten in humans, and to compare the plasma levels of mavacamten after this 
period to the plasma concentrations in maternal animals at which developmental effects were noted. 
The applicant has provided the results of the PBPK modelling which indicated that the predicted mean 
mavacamten concentrations 4 months after end of treatment would be at least factor 5 lower than the 
NOEL levels and at least factor 9 lower than the LOAEL levels in the rabbit and rat EFD studies. It is 
therefore concluded that the recommendation of the 6-month waiting period after the treatment in 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC is supported by the available data and is considered to offer sufficient 
protection against potential adverse effects on the foetus in women of childbearing potential.
In the GLP-compliant pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study, mavacamten was administered 
to pregnant dams from GD6 to PND20 at the dose levels of 0 (vehicle controls), 0.3, 0.75 and 1.5 
mg/kg/day. The toxicokinetic analysis was not performed, but maternal exposure was estimated from 
the results of the developmental toxicity study with rats in which maternal F0 AUC0-24 of 16500 ng x 
h/mL was achieved on GD12 at the same dose level. Pup exposure and excretion of mavacamten in the 
milk of lactating dams were not evaluated. Intact offspring that were found dead or euthanized for 
humane reasons during PND 0–4 were necropsied using a fresh dissection technique, which included 
examination of the heart and major vessels. The pups which were not selected as F1 generation were 
subjected to gross necropsy on PND 21. The selected F1 generation pups were kept untreated and 
assessed for sexual developmental landmarks (balano-preputial separation, vaginal patency), sensory 
function and neurobehavioral development. The F1 animals not selected for breeding were necropsied 
on PND 73-78; F1 animals selected for breeding were euthanized in PND 123-128 (males) or GD 15 
(females). The ovaries and uterus were examined for number and distribution of corpora lutea,

implantation sites, embryos, and early resorptions. Tissues with gross lesions were preserved, but no 
histopathological evaluation was conducted.
Mavacamten administration did not cause maternal toxicity or adverse effects on the number of 
implantation sites, unaccounted-for sites, gestation length and parturition in F0 females. No 
statistically significant effects were also seen on the mean number of F1 pups born, live litter size, 
percentage of males per litter at birth, and postnatal survival. However, it is noted that, although not 
statistically significant, a higher number of pups was found dead or euthanized in extremis from PND 0 
to the selection of F1 generation (pups (litter): 3(1), 6(3), 6(6) and 12(7)). Visceral malformation 
consisting of an intraventricular septal defect (1 mm in diameter opening in the anterior portion of the 
septum, an absent bicuspid valve, and a small tricuspid valve) was noted for one foetus in the 1.5 
mg/kg/day group, while situs inversus (the trachea, oesophagus, heart, great and major vessels were 
laterally transposed) and lobular dysgenesis of the lungs (only 1 lobe present) were noted for one 
foetus in the 0.75 mg/kg/day group. No other malformations were noted. Although the incidence of the 
observed findings was very low, they are consistent with the findings reported in the developmental 
toxicity with rats and are therefore considered to be likely related to the mavacamten administration. 
Therefore the lowest tested dose level of 0.3 mg/kg/day is considered the NOAEL for developmental 
defects. The necropsy of non-selected F1 pups on PND21 was uneventful.  
No adverse effects on development, fertility and reproductive performance were seen in the F1 
generation kept untreated until PND128 (males) and GD15 (females). Reproductive performance, 
mean numbers of corpora lutea, implantation sites, and intrauterine survival of the F2 embryos were 
not different from controls in the treated F1 animals. Also no effects on embryo-foetal development 
were noted in the F2 generation foetuses. Based on the results of the study, the highest administered 
dose level of 1.5 mg/kg/day is considered to be the NOAEL for F0 maternal toxicity and F1 
reproductive and maternal toxicity.
No studies in juvenile animals were performed. As mavacamten is developed for the treatment of 
symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in adult patients, juvenile studies are not 
warranted.
2.4.4.6.   Toxicokinetic data
Exposure to mavacamten increased approximately dose-proportionally in mice and dogs and dose-
proportionally or slightly more than dose-proportionally in rats (especially at the later time points). In 
mice, slight accumulation was observed (accumulation ratio up to 1.8). In rats and dogs, significant 
accumulation was observed (up to approximately 6-fold in rats and up to approximately 9-fold in 
dogs). In rats, accumulation was observed up to 90 days, but not or only to a limited extent 
thereafter. In dogs, accumulation was observed primarily in the first half of the studies and not or 
limited thereafter. No consistent gender effect was observed in mice and dogs. In rats, exposure was 
slightly higher in females (maximally up to two-fold) at doses larger than 1 mg/kg. This can possibly 
be explained by a generally higher rate of metabolism in male rats and is not likely to be relevant for 
humans.
Exposure was low in non-clinical species. Only in mice, exposures higher than the expected clinical 
exposure were reached (up to 8x the human exposure). In rats and dogs, exposures were below the 
expected clinical exposure in all studies.
In the embryo-foetal development study in rats, exposure in the pregnant females increased slightly 
more than dose-proportionally. In the embryo-foetal development study in rabbits, exposure in the 
pregnant females increased approximately dose-proportionally. Exposure in the foetuses was not 
investigated.

2.4.4.7.   Local Tolerance 
As mavacamten is intended to be taken orally and no local gastro-intestinal tract reactions were noted 
in the available toxicity studies, no local tolerance studies are warranted.
2.4.4.8.   Other toxicity studies
No separate studies were conducted on antigenicity, immunotoxicity and the dependence potential of 
mavacamten. As mavacamten is a small molecule, no antigenic response is expected. The available 
repeated dose toxicity studies gave no indication of adverse effects on primary and secondary 
lymphatic organs and tissues. Available repeated dose toxicity studies did not indicate any adverse 
effects on the central nervous system.
As the metabolic profile of mavacamten was similar between the preclinical species and humans, and 
all metabolites detected in plasma were <10% of the parent, no separate studies on metabolites are 
required.
The applicant has presented the overview of the batches used in the preclinical studies. In addition, a 
3-month repeated dose oral toxicity study was conducted with rats in which two batches of 
mavacamten were tested, one with pure substance and another spiked with a specified impurity . 
Administration of both batches at a dose level of 0.3 mg/kg/day caused higher body weight and body 
weight gain, as well as higher heart, adrenal and spleen weights in female animals. No effects were 
noted in males. The exposures to mavacamten were comparable between the batches. No differences 
in the toxicological profiles were noted between the two batches. Although the amount of the specified 
impurity may have been too low to detect meaningful effects, the study is considered sufficient to 
consider the specified impurity qualified up to the proposed specification limit.
For the second specified impurity, the specification limit is proposed based on the qualification 
threshold in accordance with ICH Q3A guideline. The substance is classified as ICH M7 class 5 
substance according to (Q)SAR expert-rule based prediction using Lhasa Limited Derek Nexus Version 
6.1 and (Q)SAR statistical-based prediction using Leadscope Inc. Leadscope Model Applier Version 3.0.

2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
Pharmacology
A cytotoxicity assay with mavacamten showed no evidence of cytotoxicity in an assay which evaluated 
cell count, nuclear size, DNA structure, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial mass, or 
cytochrome c release in HepG2 cells. Increased cell membrane permeability was noted at minimum 
and half-maximal concentrations of 4.08 and >10µM, respectively. Increased cell permeability was not 
associated with cytotoxicity in vitro at concentrations up to 7-fold higher than the minimum effective 
concentration for increased cell permeability. In dog and rat, there were no findings that could be 
correlated to increased cell permeability. Increased cell permeability in HepG2 cells was not considered 
toxicologically relevant by the applicant, which is acknowledged.
In safety pharmacology studies in rat and dog, QT prolongation was observed after dosing with 
mavacamten. After extensive in vitro studies to evaluate the mechanism behind this effect, the QT-
prolongation was considered to be hERG independent with low torsadogenic or proarrhythmic risk. It 
was considered likely that the acute QT shortening, and longer-term QT prolongation was the result of 
adaptive responses to sustained myosin inhibition in ventricles with normal physiology due to changes 
in early repolarization currents, primarily by downregulation of the Ito and IKATP potassium channels 
in response to sustained myosin inhibition. In contrast, in HCM, both these currents are already 
abrogated. In addition, INaL is also upregulated in HCM, which is a current that is moderately inhibited 
by mavacamten with potentially beneficial effects in mavacamten. Therefore, in HCM, the moderate 
but consistent INaL blockade by mavacamten coupled with its salutary functional effects most likely 
offset any mild downregulation of early repolarizing currents, leading to a neutral QT/APD response, or 
even shortening, as observed in HCM. Thus, it is considered that there is a decreased sensitivity of 
HCM hearts to mechanisms that lead to QT-prolongation after exposure to mavacamten in the healthy 
heart. 
Pharmacokinetics
Concentrations of mavacamten (MYK-461) and MYK-460 were measured in plasma of mice, rats, 
rabbits and dogs with validated LC-MS/MS methods. The validation was adequate regarding calibration, 
accuracy, precision, matrix effect and dilution integrity. Stability at room temperature was not reported 
in rats and dogs. In the response, the applicant stated that after ~22 hours, -18.6% difference was 
noted in rat plasma and -5.3% difference in dog plasma compared to a fresh sample, when stored at 
room temperature during method development. During the analyses of the samples, samples were 
only at room temperature during the extraction procedure, for maximally 2 h. Possible degradation 
during 2 h is not expected to have had a significant effect on the results. 
Oral bioavailability compared to IV administration was complete in mice and 75%, 87% and 47% in 
rats, dogs and monkeys, respectively. The bioavailability of mavacamten administered via capsules to 
dogs increased from 16% to 64% when mavacamten was micronized.
In rats, mavacamten-related radioactivity was highest in the diaphragm, oesophagus, kidneys, liver, 
myocardium, salivary glands, adrenal glands, skeletal muscle, small intestine and stomach mucosa. 
Low levels were found in the CNS. Mavacamten-related radioactivity was found in the skin and eye, 
indicating that mavacamten should be investigated for its phototoxic potential. 
Blood-to-plasma ratios in blood from mouse, rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey and human were reported 
as 0.72, 0.82, 0.78, 0.82 and 0.79 in mouse, rat (~33%), dog (~25%), monkey and human (~30% in 
RBC). This indicates no preferential distribution to red blood cells.

EMA/311929/2023 
Page 38/277
After in vitro incubation of [14C]mavacamten with liver microsomes or hepatocytes from mouse, rat, 
dog, monkey, and human, low levels of metabolites (generally  <5%) were found. In an in vivo study 
in rats, parent compound was the main component in plasma, comprising 45% and 67% of total 
radioactivity in orally and IV dosed rats, respectively. Unidentified metabolites were found in plasma, 
urine and bile of rats in considerable amounts. Although clinically, there is uncertainty regarding the 
metabolite profile in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers, this cannot be solved in the rat. Moreover, in the rat 
study, plasma was only sampled up to 72 h. It should be solved clinically. The issue regarding the 
unidentified metabolites in the rat is not further pursued.
After oral administration to bile duct-intact rats, 58% was excreted in faeces, 23% in urine and 1.7% 
in expired air. After IV administration to bile duct-cannulated rats, 41% was excreted in bile, 7.6% in 
faeces and 31% in urine. 
Toxicology
The toxicological behaviour of mavacamten was investigated in accordance with the requirements of 
ICH M3(R2). Pivotal GLP-compliant studies were conducted in rats and dogs as test species. It is noted 
that the achieved exposure in the conducted studies was below the anticipated clinical exposure at the 
MRHD, as the dosing levels were limited by severe cardiac toxicity and lethality in the healthy test 
animals. Due to this, the studies may not have been sufficient to assess the potential secondary 
pharmacologic effects of mavacamten; however, as there were no significant safety concerns identified 
in the submitted pharmacological studies, this limitation can be accepted.
Single doses of mavacamten up to 7 mg/kg were well tolerated without signs of toxicity in dogs, while 
administration of 30 mg/kg mavacamten resulted in animals being sacrificed in moribund condition. 
Repeated dose toxicity was investigated in the studies of up to 26 weeks duration in rats and up to 39 
weeks duration in dogs, with the animals dosed up to 3 mg/kg/day. The main adverse effects seen in 
both species were observed in the heart and are considered related to the primary pharmacodynamic 
action of the substance. Cardiac failure at the top tested dose levels caused increased mortality and 
early euthanasia of the test animals (rats: ≥1.2 mg/kg/day, corresponding to AUC0-24 ≥9150 ng x 
h/mL; dogs: ≥0.45 mg/kg/day (males), corresponding to AUC0-24 = 17200 ng x h/mL). Effects 
observed in other organs and tissues in both species (centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis, 
centrilobular congestion/vacuolation; pulmonary congestion/oedema, spleen oedema) are considered 
secondary to the cardiac failure and reduced cardiac output. In rats, adverse heart changes included 
increased heart weight correlated with cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial and endocardial 
degeneration/inflammation, cartilaginous/osseous metaplasia and valvular inflammation. Decreased 
systolic function was seen in the 26-week study at the dose level of 1.2 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 of 
≥8490 ng x h/mL), which resolved after the recovery period. There was no consistent effect on the 
levels of cardiac stress biomarkers (NT-proANP, NT-proBNP and troponin I).
The findings in dogs were in general comparable to the findings in rats. In general, mostly somewhat 
higher exposure was achieved at the same dose levels in male animals compared to females. Male 
dogs appeared to be more sensitive to mavacamten toxicity, with the dose level of 0.45 mg/kg/day 
causing mortality and early euthanasia in the 13-week study in males but not in females (AUC0-24 = 
17200 ng x h/mL in males vs 12300 ng x h/mL in females). The applicant suggested that this 
apparently higher male sensitivity to toxicity of mavacamten was caused by a higher exposure 
achieved in male dogs, which is supported by the toxicokinetic data from the 6-week and 3-month dog 
studies. Next to histopathological changes, increased heart rate and QTc prolongation were reported at 
≥0.18 mg/kg/day in the 13- and 39-week studies (AUC0-24 ≥3800 ng x h/mL); also, QRS interval was 
prolonged in females administered 0.45 mg/kg/day (AUC0-24 = 12500 ng x h/mL) in the 39-week 
study. The changes were reversible upon recovery. The QTc interval prolongation is considered to be 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 39/277
an indirect effect mediated by the on-target reduction in systolic cardiac function and not relevant for 
patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, for whom cardiac hypercontractivity is normally 
observed. Cardiac ventricular dilation, reversible upon recovery, was seen in the 13-week study at 
0.45 mg/kg/day at the necropsy of the early decedents and one surviving female, and in the 39-week 
study in the high-dose males and females (0.30 and 0.45 mg/kg/day, respectively). 
The compliant genotoxicity package indicated that mavacamten is not genotoxic. Mavacamten showed 
no carcinogenic potential when administered for 104 weeks to rats or for 6 months to transgenic mice.  
Mavacamten did not show adverse effects on male or female fertility and early embryonic development 
up to the highest tested dose of 1.2 mg/kg/day. However, as the achieved exposure levels in the 
submitted FEED study were below the anticipated clinical exposure, this study is not considered to 
provide sufficient evidence for the lack of effects of mavacamten on fertility. However, it is 
acknowledged that secondary pharmacodynamics data do not indicate possible concerns. In the 
developmental toxicity studies with rats and rabbits, mavacamten showed fetotoxic and teratogenic 
potential in both species at maternal exposure levels below the anticipated clinical exposure at the 
MRHD. In rats, increased post-implantation loss, reduced foetal body weight and skeletal and visceral 
malformations were seen in the absence of maternal toxicity. Skeletal malformations were manifested 
mainly as fused sternebrae, whereas visceral malformations were observed in 2 foetuses of two litters 
and included one complete situs inversus and one foetus with the absence of the right atrioventricular 
valve associated with a ventricular septum defect. Although the visceral effects were observed only in 
two foetuses, they were still considered related to the test substance administration based on their 
nature, the same effects seen in the pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity rat study and the active 
substance pharmacodynamic mode of action. In rabbits, external, skeletal and visceral malformations 
were observed, with a dose-dependent increase in the number of foetuses with cleft palate from 1.2 
mg/kg/day and great vessels malformations (dilatation of pulmonary trunk and/or aortic arch) and 
fused sternebrae at 2 mg/kg/day. Mavacamten was detected in rabbit embryos and extra-embryonic 
tissues (foetal envelopes, placenta, amniotic fluid) ca. 24 hours after dosing on GD12, with individual 
embryonic tissue to plasma concentration ratios ranging from 0.09 to 0.15 across the dose levels (non-
GLP measurements). Considering that mavacamten demonstrated clear teratogenic potential in two 
species at maternal exposure levels below the anticipated clinical exposure, and the observed effects 
are considered to be related to the pharmacologic mode of action, the use of mavacamten is 
contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential, unless the conditions listed 
in Section 4.6 of the SmPC are met.
It is further proposed by the applicant to add the following sentence to the SmPC: “Women of 
childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after 
discontinuation of Camzyos, since it takes approximately 5 half-lives (approximately 45 days for 
CYP2C19 normal metabolisers and 115 days for CYP2C19 poor metabolisers) to eliminate mavacamten 
from the body after treatment discontinuation.” Therefore, before initiation of treatmentin women of 
childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test result must be available and counselling should be 
provided regarding the serious risk to the foetus. The applicant has provided the results of the PBPK 
modelling which indicated that the predicted mean mavacamten concentrations 4 months after end of 
treatment would be at least factor 5 lower than the NOEL levels and at least factor 9 lower than the 
LOAEL levels in the rabbit and rat EFD studies. It is therefore concluded that the recommendation of 
the 4-month waiting period after the treatment in Section 4.6 of the SmPC is supported by the 
available data and is considered to offer sufficient protection against potential adverse effects on the 
foetus in women of childbearing potential.
In the pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study, mavacamten administration did not cause 
maternal toxicity or adverse effects on the number of implantation sites, unaccounted-for sites,

gestation length and parturition in F0 females up to the highest tested dose level of 1.5 mg/kg/day. No 
statistically significant effects were also seen on the mean number of F1 pups born, live litter size, 
percentage of males per litter at birth, and postnatal survival. Visceral malformations manifested as an 
intraventricular septal defect (1 mm in diameter opening in the anterior portion of the septum, an 
absent bicuspid valve, and a small tricuspid valve) and one situs inversus (laterally transposed 
trachea, oesophagus, heart, great and major vessels) with lobular dysgenesis of the lungs (only 1 lobe 
present) were noted for one foetus in the 1.5 mg/kg/day and one foetus in the 0.75 mg/kg/day 
groups, respectively. Although the incidence of the observed findings was very low, they are consistent 
with the findings reported in the developmental toxicity with rats and are therefore considered to be 
likely related to the mavacamten administration. Therefore the lowest tested dose level of 0.3 
mg/kg/day is considered the NOAEL for developmental defects. Mavacamten did not cause adverse 
effects on the development, fertility and reproductive performance of the F1 generation and on 
embryo-foetal development of the F2 generation foetuses. The highest administered dose level of 1.5 
mg/kg/day is considered to be the NOAEL for F0 maternal toxicity and F1 reproductive and maternal 
toxicity. The toxicokinetic analysis was not performed, but maternal exposure was estimated from the 
results of the developmental toxicity study with rats in which maternal F0 AUC0-24 of 16500 ng x h/mL 
was achieved on GD12 at the same dose level. Pup exposure and excretion of mavacamten in the milk 
of lactating dams were not evaluated.
As mavacamten is developed for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy in adult patients, juvenile studies are not warranted.
No local tolerance studies were conducted. This is endorsed because mavacamten is intended to be 
taken orally, and no local gastro-intestinal tract reactions are noted in the available toxicity studies. 
No antigenicity or immunotoxicity studies have been conducted. As mavacamten is a small molecule, 
no antigenic response is expected. In addition, the available repeated dose toxicity studies gave no 
indication of adverse effects on primary and secondary lymphatic organs and tissues.
No separate dependence studies have been conducted. Available repeated dose toxicity studies did not 
indicate any adverse effects on the central nervous system.
As toxicokinetic data indicate the distribution of mavacamten to skin and eyes, the applicant is 
requested to investigate its phototoxic potential in accordance with ICH M3 (R2) guideline. The 
applicant has provided the results of the UV-VIS absorbance of mavacamten which indicate the molar 
extinction coefficient (MEC) of 246 L/mol x cm in the wavelength range of 290-700 ng. Based on this 
mavacanten is not considered to be sufficiently photoreactive to result in direct cytotoxicity. 
As the metabolic profile of mavacamten was similar between the preclinical species and humans, and 
all metabolites detected in plasma were <10% of the parent, no separate studies on metabolites are 
considered necessary. 
Based on the conducted studies, the specified impurity s considered qualified up to the proposed 
specification limit. For the second specified impurity, the specification limit is proposed based on the 
qualification threshold in accordance with ICH Q3A guideline. According to Section 3.2.S.3.2.5 of the 
provided dossier, the substance is classified as ICH M7 class 5 substance; as it is predicted to be not 
mutagenic both by an expert-rule based and statistical-based QSARs.
Mavacamten is considered not to be PBT, nor vPvB.
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
Overall, the preclinical toxicology program was conducted according to ICH M3 guideline requirements. 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 41/277
The pivotal studies conducted in rats and dogs demonstrated adverse effects in the heart, which are 
considered related to the primary pharmacodynamic action of mavacamten. It is noted that the 
achieved exposure in the conducted studies was below the anticipated clinical exposure at the MRHD, 
as the dosing levels were limited by severe cardiac toxicity and lethality in the healthy test animals. 
Due to this, the studies may not have been sufficient to assess the potential secondary pharmacologic 
effects of mavacamten; however, as there were no significant safety concerns identified in the 
submitted pharmacological studies, this limitation was accepted. Adverse effects seen in the repeated 
dose studies included increased heart weight, cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial and endocardial 
degeneration/inflammation, cartilaginous/osseous metaplasia (rats), valvular inflammation, ECG 
changes (increased heart rate, QTc and QRS prolongation in dogs) and ventricular dilation. The ECG 
changes and ventricular dilation were reversible in recovery animals. At high dose levels, cardiac 
failure was seen, causing mortality and early euthanasia of the test animals. Effects observed in other 
organs and tissues (centrilobular hepatocellular necrosis, centrilobular congestion/vacuolation, 
pulmonary congestion/oedema, spleen oedema) were considered secondary to the cardiac failure and 
reduced cardiac output. 
Mavacamten is not genotoxic or carcinogenic and does not adversely affect fertility at the tested dose 
levels. Developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits demonstrated embryo-foetal toxicity in both 
species at maternal exposure levels below the anticipated clinical exposure at the MRHD, which is 
considered to be related to its pharmacologic mode of action. Mavacamten is suspected of causing 
congenital malformations when administered to pregnant women and is therefore contraindicated 
during pregnancy and in women of child-bearing potential, unless the conditions listed in Section 4.6 of 
the SmPC are met. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment 
and for 6 months after discontinuation. No information is available on its excretion in animal milk. 
In summary, mavacamten is considered approvable from the preclinical point of view.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology
Pharmacokinetics
Mavacamten is a reversible inhibitor of cardiac myosin that is developed for the treatment of obstructive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) in adults. The recommended starting dose is 2.5 mg orally once 
daily for CYP2C19 poor metabolisers and 5 mg orally once daily for CYP2C19 intermediate, normal, rapid 
and ultra-rapid metabolisers (non-poor metabolisers). After 4 weeks, the dose should be decreased to 
2.5 mg once daily or dosing should be paused if on 2.5 mg if the LVOT gradient with Valsalva manoeuvre 
is  <20  mmHg.  Twelve  weeks  after  treatment  initiation,  the  dose  may  be  stepwise  increased  to  a 
maximum of 5 mg once daily for CYP2C19 poor metabolisers and a maximum of 15 mg once daily for 
CYP2C19  intermediate,  normal,  rapid  and  ultra-rapid  metabolisers  in  case  of  persistent  symptoms  of 
obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and LVOT gradient with Valsalva manoeuvre >30 mmHg and 
LVEF > 55%. The dose is administered once daily independent of a meal. Available strengths are 2.5 
mg, 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg hard capsules.
The clinical pharmacology of mavacamten was assessed in healthy volunteers (11 studies) and patients 
with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (1 study). Dedicated healthy volunteer studies assessed 
the effect of food, relative bioavailability, intrinsic factors (race and hepatic impairment), and several 
drug-drug  interactions  (DDI)  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  mavacamten.  Furthermore,  a  mass-balance 
study characterised the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of mavacamten. In addition, sparse blood 
samples were obtained in clinical efficacy and safety studies (6 studies). Furthermore, several in vitro 
studies were performed investigating the permeability, plasma protein binding, blood-to-plasma ratio, 
metabolic  stability  in  human  liver  microsomes  and  human  hepatocytes  and  if  mavacamten  was  a 
substrate of CYP enzymes and transporters. Furthermore, in vitro studies were performed to investigate 
whether mavacamten was an inhibitor or inducer of CYP enzymes or transporters.
Physicochemical properties
Mavacamten  (C15H19N3O2)  has  a  molecular  weight  of  273.33  g/mol  and  a  pKa  of  9.03  ±  0.09. 
Furthermore, mavacamten is poorly soluble in water (pH independent over the physiologically relevant 
pH range). Mavacamten can be considered a BCS class II compound, since mavacamten has low solubility 
and high absorption in vivo.
Mavacamten  has  one  chiral  centre  and  is  in  the  (S)-configuration.  No  inter-conversion  to  the 
R-enantiomer occurs in vivo. 
Analytical methods
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 48/277
Mavacamten  was  analysed  in  K2-EDTA  plasma  using  LC-MS/MS.  Four  high-performance  liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods were developed for the quantitation 
of mavacamten from human plasma and urine. Based on the provided data, the analytical methods used 
to determine mavacamten in plasma appear to be sufficiently validated.
Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) modelling
The  applicant  submitted  two  population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  that  were  developed  using 
observations  of  healthy  volunteers,  obstructive  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  patients  and  non- 
obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients. For healthy volunteers, mainly dense samples were 
collected, whereas for patient data, only samples at trough and 1- or 2-hours post-dosing were available. 
Actual sampling and dosing times were however used.
The  final  model  consists  of  a  two-compartment  model  with  first-order  elimination  and  first-order 
absorption (including lag time). Several covariates were found to be influential in the models (i.e. body 
weight,  CYP2C19  genotype,  disease  status  (i.e.  healthy  volunteers  versus  patients),  concomitant 
administration of omeprazole or disopyramide, formulation, food intake and dose. The pharmacokinetics 
appear  to  be  quite  unpredictable  for  individual  subjects.  However,  on  a  population  level,  the  models 
capture  the  variability  adequately.  The  PopPK  models  are  not  able  to  predict  the  food  effect  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of mavacamten, as clear misspecifications could be observed in the pcVPCs of the first 
analysis.  In  the  second  population  pharmacokinetic  model,  submitted  later  in  the  procedure,  no 
goodness-of-fit  diagnostics  stratified  by  food  effect  were  provided.  After  correcting  the  influence  of 
several covariates in the population pharmacokinetic model, patients with oHCM were estimated to have 
a  higher  exposure  than  healthy  subjects.  The  reason  for  this  observation  remains  unknown.  The 
equations of the second population pharmacokinetic model, including model parameters and goodness-
of-fit diagnostics, are displayed below.

Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling
A PBPK model was used to investigate the effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor on the PK of mavacamten 
in CYP2C19 normal and poor metabolisers. The PBPK model was not sufficiently able to predict the PK 
in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers. Furthermore, the applicant included fm values for the contribution of 
CYP2C19, 3A4 and 2C9. However, in vitro data indicated that CYP3A5 was also involved in the 
metabolism to a significant extent. Vmax and Km were not determined for each CYP enzyme and an 
incorrect approach to determine the contribution of each CYP enzyme to the overall metabolism was 
used. The contribution of each CYP may be concentration-dependent, and mavacamten showed more 
than a dose-proportional increase in exposure (indicating saturation of the metabolism since it is not a 
substrate of P-glycoprotein). Overall, the contribution of CYP2C19, 3A4 and 3A5 may be different at 
higher/lower concentrations and depends on the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and 3A5 phenotypes. Overall, 
the PBPK model is currently not sufficient to waive clinical DDI studies.
In addition, PBPK modelling was used to investigate the induction potential towards CYP2B6 via CAR 
and the inhibition potential towards MATE1. Limited model qualification was provided for the prediction 
of induction for CYP2B6 and MATE1 inhibition. Therefore, the PBPK model was not sufficiently qualified 
to conclude that mavacamten does not induce CYP2B6 via CAR in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers receiving 
the highest dose. However, it is proposed by the CHMP that CYP2C19 poor metabolisers are restricted 
from treatment with dosages higher than 5 mg; therefore, this induction potential is likely not to occur 
in clinical practice. The PBPK model was not sufficiently qualified to conclude that mavacamten does 
not inhibit MATE1 at clinically relevant doses following repeated dosing.
Absorption
The pharmacokinetics of mavacamten in healthy volunteers was investigated following a single dose 
over a dosing range from 1 mg to 25 mg and following multiple dosing over a dose range of 12.5 to 
18.5 mg once daily for 28 days. Following a single dose, mavacamten is rapidly absorbed in plasma in 
healthy subjects. Median plasma tmax was around 2 hours.
No absolute oral bioavailability study was performed. Therefore, the exact oral bioavailability of the 
commercial formulation is unknown. Based on the data of the mass balance study (<4% of the 
radioactivity was eliminated in the first 48 hours and 85% is eliminated via urine), the absorption can 
be considered high (>85%). At Cmax, 80.3% of the radioactivity in plasma was parent compound. In 
contrast, co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitor resulted in an increase of 1.5-fold in Cmax indicating 
first-pass metabolism by CYP3A4 in the intestine or liver. This indicates that the absolute oral 
bioavailability can be estimated to be ~60-80%.
Co-administration of mavacamten with a high-fat meal decreased the Cmax with 55% and the AUC with 
13%. The decrease in AUC was not considered clinically relevant. The effect of a normal-fat meal on 
the Cmax and AUC is unknown, but likely less than the high-fat meal. In pivotal efficacy and safety 
study 005, mavacamten was taken without regard of food. It is therefore agreed that mavacamten 
may be given independent of food.
In the clinical studies, the inter-individual variability for Cmax ranged from 15% to 57% and for AUC 
ranged from 24% to 67% in subjects that were normal to rapid CYP2C19 metabolisers. The PopPK 
model estimated an inter-individual variability of 59%.
The Cmax appears to increase more than dose proportional over the concentration range 1 mg to 2 mg 
and dose proportional from 2 mg to 25 mg in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers. The AUC appears to 
increase more than dose proportional over the concentration range 1 mg to 5 mg and dose 
proportional from 5 mg to 25 mg in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers. In CYP2C19 poor metabolisers the 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 51/277
dose is proportional over the clinical dose range of 2.5 mg to 5 mg and  dosages are restricted to a 
maximum dose of 5 mg for poor metabolisers.
The accumulation was 2.2-fold for the Cmax and 7.3-fold for the AUC0-24 following a dose of 12.5 mg 
once daily in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers. Similar accumulation is expected over a dose range of 5 to 
15 mg (Cmax and AUC are dose-proportional). However, the AUC is more than dose proportional from 
2.5 mg to 5 mg dose range and the accumulation may thus be different at dosages <5 mg. Also, the 
degree of accumulation is dependent on the CYP2C19 phenotype. No information is available on the 
accumulation of mavacamten for the other CYP2C19 phenotypes (poor metaboliser, intermediate 
metaboliser, rapid metaboliser and ultra-rapid metaboliser) over the clinical dose range.
Five different formulations were used in the clinical studies: oral suspension, tablet campaign 1, tablet 
campaign 2, capsule 1 and capsule 2. A bioequivalence study was performed between the 15 mg 
capsule 1 formulation and 15 mg capsule 2 formulation (intended commercial formulation). 
Bioequivalence was shown between the two formulations. The 10 mg capsule 2 formulation strength 
can be waived via a biowaiver of strengths (see Quality AR). However, the two lower strengths of the 
capsule 2 formulation (2.5 mg and 5 mg) cannot be agreed based on a biowaiver of strength (the 
strengths were manufactured by the same manufacturing process and have the same qualitative 
composition, but the composition of the strengths is not quantitatively proportional and the dissolution 
was not similar). A bioequivalence study with the 5 mg strength (3 times) versus with the 15 mg 
capsule 2 formulation is needed to show that the different strengths are switchable. It was agreed to 
study this post-authorisation. Currently the SmPC has a warning regarding the switchability between 
the different available strengths.
Distribution
Mavacamten has an in vitro plasma protein binding of 93% and a blood-to-plasma ration of 0.79 ± 
0.12. Thus, mavacamten has a high plasma protein binding and does not significantly distribute to red 
blood cells. The protein binding was also assessed in vivo in the hepatic impairment study and ranged 
between 97 to 98% in subjects with normal or reduced hepatic function (independent of the hepatic 
function).
Mavacamten has a large apparent volume of distribution of 114 L to 206 L. A limited amount is 
distribution to semen at clinical dosages (ratio of 0.04).
Metabolism
The in vitro and in vivo metabolism rate of mavacamten is slow. Only 4% was metabolised after 1-
hour of incubation with human liver microsomes and 4-hour with human hepatocytes. In the mass 
balance study, the majority of mavacamten radioactivity is eliminated as metabolite and only a very 
small fraction as a parent in urine (<2%) and faeces (<1%).
In plasma of CYP2C19 normal metabolisers, the majority of radioactivity was parent compound (67-
77%), and all metabolites were present for <10% (the main metabolites M2 and M46 were present for 
2.3-4.6% and 1.4-7.9% of the total radioactivity, respectively). The majority is eliminated as 
metabolite, and <3% is eliminated as parent in the excreta. In urine, M2 is the main metabolite and 
represents ~50% of the excreted radioactivity (together with M13). Overall, this indicates that 
mavacamten is metabolised to a significant extent and based on the excreta data M2 is most likely the 
main metabolite formed. Furthermore, the metabolite profile in CYP2C19-poor metabolisers is partly 
unknown. Plasma samples from study 012 in CYP2C19-poor metabolisers and normal metabolisers 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 52/277
 
were used to investigate the presence of mavacamten and metabolites M2 (formed by CYP2C19), M6 
(formed by CYP3A) and M8. No other metabolites were measured. Metabolites M2 and M8 were only 
present to a very limited extent or not measured in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers. M6 AUC in poor 
metabolisers was similar to that in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers. It is unknown if other metabolites 
are formed in CYP2C19-poor metabolisers. Based on the provided data, it cannot be concluded that no 
other metabolites are formed in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers compared to CYP2C19 normal 
metabolisers. Furthermore, most metabolites were observed in the excreta and not in plasma.
Based on in vitro and mass balance studies, mavacamten metabolism involves mainly CYP2C19 and to 
a lesser extent CYP3A4, and 3A5 and to an even lesser extent by CYP2C9 in CYP2C19 normal to 
extensive metabolisers. In CYP2C19 poor metabolisers, mavacamten is metabolised by CYP3A4, 3A5 
and 2C9. Involvement of UGT enzymes in biotransformation appears marginal in CYP2C19 normal to 
extensive metabolisers as the very limited amount of metabolites excreted in urine were found to be 
glucuronides. The contribution of glucuronidation in CYP2C19-poor metabolisers is unknown.
Transporters
The applicant performed in vitro studies investigating if mavacamten is a substrate of P-glycoprotein 
and hepatic uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1 and NTCP) and the transporters 
OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. Based on these studies, mavacamten is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, OCT1, OCT2, NTCP, OAT1 and OAT3. Thus, hepatic uptake does not 
appear to be the rate limiting step in the clearance of mavacamten.
No studies were performed investigating if mavacamten is a substrate of BCRP. No in vitro study is 
needed to investigate if mavacamten is a substrate of BCRP, since the bioavailability appears to be 
high and the majority is eliminated as metabolite via urine. 
Excretion
The excretion of mavacamten related radioactivity is mainly via urine, only a small fraction (<10%) is 
eliminated via faeces. The elimination is slow and depends on the CYP2C19 phenotype; the elimination 
half-life of mavacamten ranged from 72 h in ultra-rapid metabolisers to 533 h in poor metabolisers. 
The elimination half-life was ~150 h in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers.
Pharmacokinetics in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients
The pharmacokinetics of mavacamten were investigated in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
following a single ascending oral dose of mavacamten (48 mg, 96 mg and 144 mg) divided into 8 
aliquots administered over a 2 h period. The PK in healthy volunteers following a single dose of 48 mg 
mavacamten divided into 8 aliquots 15 minutes apart was compared to the PK in patients with 
obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (see Table below). The tmax and AUC0-24 are comparable, but 
the Cmax and AUC0-inf is lower in patients compared to healthy volunteers. The elimination half-life is 
around half in patients compared to healthy volunteers.

No dedicated PK studies were performed following the administration of a single dose administered at 
once over the clinical dose range (2.5 to 15 mg) or following repeated dosing. Sparse blood sampling 
was performed in clinical studies 004 (n=21), 005 (n=123), 006 (n=39), 007 (n=90), and 008 
(n=13), and Population PK modelling was used to predict the PK. Based on the PopPK modelling, the 
applicant concluded that patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy exhibited a higher 
exposure than healthy subjects.
In patients that are CYP2C19 normal metabolisers, the predicted Cmax is 945 ng/mL, and AUC is 20.000 
ng × h/mL at steady state following once-daily dosing with 15 mg mavacamten. Similar exposure is 
expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers at steady state treated with 5 mg mavacamten once-daily.
Special populations
Genetic polymorphism
Mavacamten is mainly cleared by metabolism via CYP2C19 once it is systemically available in CYP2C19 
intermediate to ultra-rapid metabolisers. However, metabolism by CYP3A plays a role during absorption 
and  first-pass  metabolism  in  these  subjects  (Cmax  of  mavacamten  was  increased  1.5-fold  following 
concomitant administration with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor). Furthermore, in vitro data indicates that 
CYP3A5 is able to metabolise mavacamten to a more significant extent than CYP3A4. The potential effect 
of genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A5 on the PK of mavacamten, especially in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers 
is unknown.
Based on the PK data in subjects with different CYP2C19 metabolising status, the PK of mavacamten 
depends highly on the CYP2C19 metabolic status (see Table below) with a 2.2-fold higher Cmax and a 
6.9-fold higher AUC in poor metabolisers compared to ultra-rapid metabolisers. The Cmax/dose was 
1.8-fold higher in poor metabolisers and 1.2-fold lower in ultra-rapid metabolisers compared to normal 
metabolisers. The AUC/dose was 4.6-fold higher in poor metabolisers and 1.6-fold lower in ultra-rapid 
metabolisers compared to normal metabolisers.

Impaired renal function
No dedicated renal impairment study was performed. In the population pharmacokinetic model, renal 
function was not identified as a significant covariate for subjects with eGFR levels down to 
29.5 mL/min/1.73 m2. It can be agreed with the applicant that mild to moderate impaired renal 
function is not expected to translate in a significant increase in plasma exposure to mavacamten. 
Severe renal impairment is known to affect the metabolism capacity of the liver. Thus, severe renal 
impairment may have an effect on the PK of mavacamten. The effect of severe renal impairment was 
not investigated in clinical studies.
Impaired hepatic function
Mild and moderate hepatic impairment did not influence Cmax of mavacamten (1.1-fold increase), but 
significantly increased the plasma exposure (AUC; approximately 1.7 to 3.9-fold higher plasma 
exposure) and half-life of mavacamten. However, the subjects in the mild hepatic impairment group 
had higher AUCs than subjects in the moderate hepatic impairment group. Furthermore, the 
elimination half-life increased >2.5-fold in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment 
compared to normal hepatic function. No adjustment of the starting dose of 2.5 mg is needed in 
CYP2C19 poor metabolisers or for patients for which the CYP2C19 status is unknown. However, the 
dose should be reduced by half or more in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh class A) and moderate 
(Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment. No dose recommendation can be made for patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), because mavacamten has not been studied in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment.
Age
The influence of age (age range: 18–83 years) was investigated using the population pharmacokinetic 
model. No trends with age where identified. A total of 303 subjects were included in studies 001, 002, 
003, 009, 010, 011, 012, 013, 014, 015, 016, and 018 with age distribution as shown in the Table below.

No subjects were included in these studies with an age above 70. In study 007, submitted later in the 
procedure, patients ranged from 19 to 83 years. Mavacamten is indicated for subjects of 18 years and 
older in this procedure. Therefore, no clinical PK studies are needed in paediatric subjects.
Body weight
The exposure was 1.6-fold increased at a body weight of 45 kg compared to the reference body weight 
of 84 kg. The initial starting dose of 5 mg is not expected to translate in a significant safety risk in 
adult patients with a CYP2C19 intermediate to ultra-rapid phenotype as a consequence of increased 
mavacamten exposure due to low body weight. The exposure was 0.68-fold in subjects with CYP2C19 
intermediate to normal phenotype with a body weight of 140 kg compared to the reference body 
weight of 84 kg. CYP2C19 ultra-rapid metabolisers with a high body weight (>140 kg) may have a 
decreased exposure such that the efficacy may be reduced in these subjects. Furthermore, patients 
with a low body weight (<50 kg) and CYP2C19 poor metabolisers may have increased safety issues, 
especially at dosages of 5 mg once daily or higher.
Gender
No significant effect of gender (n = 261 males and n = 200 females) was identified in the population 
pharmacokinetic model after correcting for differences in body weight.
Race
In CYP2C19 normal metabolisers, no differences in the pharmacokinetics were observed between 
Japanese and Caucasian subjects following a single oral dose of 25 mg mavacamten. However, the 
ethnic prevalence of the CYP2C19 phenotypes is different, with a high frequency of the poor 
metabolising phenotype in Asians. Thus, a difference in PK due to race can be expected independent 
on the effect of body weight.
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies
Mavacamten as victim
Based on in vitro data, mavacamten appears to be mainly metabolised by CYP2C19 and can also be 
metabolised by CYP3A4 and 3A5. In vivo, the elimination half-life of mavacamten ranged from 72 h to 
533 h, depending on the CYP2C19 phenotype. Therefore, the effect of other medicinal products on the 
PK of mavacamten will depend on the CYP2C19 phenotype. CYP2C19 inhibitors may have a significant 
effect on the PK of mavacamten in CYP2C19 intermediate to ultra-rapid metabolisers but no effect in 
CYP2C19 poor metabolisers. CYP3A4/5 inhibitors may have a limited effect on the PK of mavacamten 
in CYP2C19 intermediate to ultra-rapid metabolisers but a significant effect in CYP2C19 poor 
metabolisers. Clinical DDI studies were conducted in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers to assess the 
clinical impact of the combination of mavacamten with omeprazole (proton pump inhibitor and weak 
CYP2C19 inhibitor) and with verapamil (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor). 
Co-administration of mavacamten with a moderate to weakCYP2C19 inhibitor (omeprazole) resulted in 
a 58% increase in AUC and no effect on the Cmax. The observed effect of omeprazole was not due to 
increased gastric pH since the solubility was similar over the pH range of 1-6. The effect of a strong 
CYP2C19 inhibitor on the PK of mavacamten was not investigated in a clinical DDI study but will be 
similar to the effect of poor CYP2C19 metabolising status. Therefore, the dose should be reduced from 
15 mg to 5 mg and from 10 mg and 5 mg to 2.5 mg or pause treatment if on 2.5 mg when starting 
with a CYP2C19 strong inhibitor in CYP2C19-intermediate to ultra-rapid metabolisers in patients that 
are CYP2C19 non-poor metabolisers.
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 56/277
Co-administration of mavacamten with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (verapamil) resulted in a ~15% 
increase in AUC in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers, which is not considered clinically significant. Cmax 
after this single dose was ~50% higher. No dose adjustment is required when mavacamten is co-
administered with verapamil or other moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors in CYP2C19 intermediate to ultra-
rapid metabolisers. The effect of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor on the PK of mavacamten was not 
investigated and may result in a significant increase in the Cmax, especially in CYP2C19-poor 
metabolisers. The effect of a CYP3A inhibitor in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers remains therefore 
unknown, but based on the elimination pathway, may be so significant that CYP3A4 strong inhibitors 
are contra-indicated.
Mavacamten as perpetrator
Mavacamten is not an in vitro inhibitor of CYP3A, glycoprotein and BCRP at maximal intestinal 
concentrations. Furthermore, mavacamten is not an inhibitor of OCT1, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 at 
maximal portal vein concentrations. In addition, mavacamten is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 and of the transporters OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE2-K 
and BSEP at maximal systemic concentration. Furthermore, mavacamten is not a time-dependent CYP 
inhibitor at clinically relevant concentrations. However, mavacamten is an inhibitor of MATE1 at 
maximal systemic concentrations and an inducer of CYPs and transporters via CAR and PXR at clinically 
relevant concentrations.
Clinical DDI studies were conducted in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers to assess the clinical impact of 
the combination of mavacamten as a CYP3 inducer with midazolam (CYP3A substrate) and with oral 
contraceptives. Co-administration of mavacamten for 15 to 28 days (maximal induction was obtained) 
did not affect the exposure to midazolam (CYP3A substrate) and of the biomarker 4-β 
hydroxycholesterol (indicator of PXR induction). Cmax of midazolam was 7% lower, and the AUC was 
24% lower. No change in 4-β hydroxycholesterol levels were observed. 4-β hydroxycholesterol is an 
acceptable biomarker to investigate the induction potential of CYP3A (Leil et al., 2014; Diczfalusy et 
al., 2011; Diczfalusy et al.,2008; Bjorkhem-Bergman et al., 2013). Furthermore, no effect was 
observed on the exposure to ethinyl oestradiol + norethindrone in oral contraceptives. Overall, this 
indicates that mavacamten is not an inducer of CYP3A via PXR in CYP2C19 normal metabolisers dosed 
up to 15 mg and in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers dosed up to 5 mg.
The effect of mavacamten on the pharmacokinetics of a MATE1 substrate was not investigated, but it 
cannot be excluded that mavacamten is a clinically relevant inhibitor of MATE1 following repeated 
dosing.
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacodynamics
Mechanism of action
Mavacamten is a selective, allosteric, and reversible cardiac myosin inhibitor and represents a first in 
class of therapeutic agent, the first medical therapy developed specifically for oHCM that targets the 
pathophysiology of the disease. 
Mavacamten modulates the number of myosin heads that can enter “on actin” power-generating 
states, thus reducing (or in HCM normalizing) the probability of force-producing (systolic) and residual 
(diastolic) cross-bridge formation. Mavacamten also shifts the overall myosin population towards an 
energy-sparing, but recruitable, super-relaxed state. Excess cross-bridge formation and dysregulation 
of the super-relaxed state of myosin are mechanistic hallmarks of HCM, which can result in hyper-
contractility, impaired relaxation, excess energy consumption, and myocardial wall stress. In HCM

patients, cardiac myosin inhibition with mavacamten normalises contractility, reduces dynamic left 
ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, and improves cardiac filling pressures.
Primary pharmacology
The pharmacodynamic effects of mavacamten were evaluated after single and multiple-dose 
administrations in healthy subjects (Table 3).
Study MYK-461-002 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled sequential-group single 
ascending-dose phase I study to investigate the safety and tolerability of mavacamten after single oral 
doses of 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 or 48 mg or placebo in 48 healthy subjects. Six cohorts of 8 adults were 
randomized 6:2, mavacamten to placebo. Doses 6 mg and higher were administered in 8 aliquots 15 
minutes apart. Secondary and exploratory objectives of this study were to investigate the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, respectively.
Transthoracic echocardiography showed dose-dependent reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF)(max mean decrease of 5.9% with 48 mg; Figure 2), left ventricular outflow trac velocity time 
integral (LVOT-VTI)(max mean decrease of 16.71% with 48 mg; Figure 3), left ventricular fractional 
shortening (LVFS)(max mean decrease of 22.46% with 48 mg; Figure 4) and stroke volume (SV) 
(max mean decrease of 18.55% with 48 mg; Figure 5) after a single administration of mavacamten 
doses ≥12 mg. Additionally, there was an inverse relationship between mavacamten plasma 
concentration and effects on LVEF (p=0.0126), LVOT-VTI (p<0.0001), LVFS (p<0.0001) and SV 
(p<0.001). No consistent, dose-dependent changes were evident in left ventricular end-diastolic 
volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) and isovolumetric relaxation time.

Study MYK-461-001 was a sequential group, single-ascending oral dose phase I study to investigate 
the safety and tolerability of mavacamten after single oral doses of 48, 96 and 144 mg (in 8 aliquots

(Figure 10) and LVESV (Figure 11). Generally, values returned to near baseline levels by 6 hours 
post-dose or by Day 2 in the lower dose groups. LVEF, LVOT-VTI, and LVFS remained slightly

was an inverse relationship between mavacamten plasma concentration and effects on LVEF 
(p<0.0001), LVOT-VTI (p<0.0001)), and LVFS (p=0.00167). The changes in resting LVEF, LVOT-VTI, 
and GLS returned to baseline values during the follow-up visits after discontinuation of the study drug. 
However, with respect to resting LVEDV, LVEDD, LVESD, and LVFS values did not fully return to 
baseline by D63 in the higher groups of 18.5 mg and 25 mg QD mavacamten but were returned to 
baseline after 100 to 200 days post-dose.

Resting transthoracic echocardiography
Resting transthoracic echocardiography showed dose-dependent reductions in LVEF (max mean 
decrease of 11.25% with 25 mg QD; Figure 12 and Figure 13), LVOT-VTI (max mean decrease of 
5.35 cm with 18.5 mg QD; Figure 14), and LVFS (max mean decrease of 11.11 % with 25 mg QD)

(max mean increase of 9.70 ml with 18.5 mg QD using 3D analysis), left ventricular end-diastolic 
diameter (LVEDD) (max mean increase of 0.41 cm with 25 mg QD), and left ventricular end-systolic 
diameter (LVESD) (max mean increase of 0.85 cm with 25 mg QD). Additionally, there were inverse 
relationships between mavacamten plasma concentration and effects on LVEF, LVOT-VTI, LVFS and 
positive relationships between mavacamten plasma concentration and effects on GLS, LVEDV, LVEDD, 
and LVESD.

Secondary pharmacology
Effect on cardiac electrophysiology
The concentration-response for the QTcF interval was analyzed and modelled. Data from 9 clinical 
studies were the basis for these analyses, including MYK-461-002, MYK-461-003, MYK-461-004, 
MYK-461-005, MYK-461-006, MYK-461-007 (data per cut-off date 27May2020), MYK-461-008 (data 
per cutoff date 22Jan2020), MYK-461-010, and MYK-461-014.
No evidence of QTc prolongation was noted in healthy subjects receiving single doses of mavacamten. 
However, prolonged exposure to supratherapeutic mavacamten plasma concentrations in healthy 
subjects was associated with a modest concentration-dependent increase in QTcF. A median 
concentration <1152 ng/mL would be expected to maintain the mean ΔΔQTcF <10 ms in healthy 
subjects (Figure 15). A median concentration <593 ng/mL would be expected to maintain the upper 
90% CI of mean ΔΔQTcF <10 ms. 
In oHCM subjects, there was no indication for any increase in QTcF in subjects with HCM receiving 
mavacamten; in fact, a slight exposure-dependent shortening was observed which averaged -8.7 ms 
(upper and lower limit of the 90% CI 6.7 ms and 10.8 ms, respectively) at the median steady-state 
Cmax of 452 ng/ml (Figure 15). Despite this decrease, the values remained within the normal range. 
Several key differences exist between these 2 populations of healthy subjects and oHCM subjects. 
Average baseline QTcF was considerably higher in oHCM subjects (442 ms) versus healthy subjects 
(399 ms). Exposure to mavacamten decreases normal contractility in healthy hearts, whereas it 
normalizes hypercontractility in oHCM. Thus, prolonged exposure to mavacamten is deleterious to 
healthy individuals but beneficial to oHCM patients. These results suggest not only the lack of QTc 
prolongation in the target population but a slight QTc shortening that may be partly mediated by 
inhibition of INaL, which is upregulated in HCM.

mavacamten once daily.
Isometric handgrip strength
Isometric handgrip strength was also assessed as a measure of skeletal muscle activity. In the single 
ascending dose study in healthy subjects (Study MYK-461-002), no clinically significant findings or 
trends were observed in handgrip strength. Mean changes from baseline tended to be negative for 
both the mavacamten and placebo groups. 
Also, in the single ascending dose study in oHCM subjects (Study MYK-461-001), no clinically 
significant findings or trends were observed in handgrip strength. Mean changes from Baseline tended 
to be negative for all groups, with larger general decreases observed in the higher dose mavacamten 
groups; however, overall trends in handgrip strength are difficult to discern due to the small sample 
size.
In the multiple ascending dose study in healthy subjects (Study MYK-461-003), handgrip strength 
generally increased slightly over time in the placebo group, while there were no apparent trends across 
time or dose in the mavacamten groups. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances
Calcium channel blockers (CCB) of the nondihydropyridine variety such as verapamil and diltiazem act 
directly on the myocardium to reduce contractility and heart rate. These features can have the salutary 
effects of decreasing LVOT obstruction and allowing the left ventricle more time to fill in diastole.  
However, CCB are not felt to be as potent or effective as beta adrenergic receptor blockers (BB) in the 
treatment of obstructive HCM. Thus, background therapy with CCB was not as prevalent in MYK-461-
005 (EXPLORER-HCM) as BB.  
Beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (BB) are very effective in reducing contractility and heart rate and 
have been used to treat obstructive HCM since the 1960s. In EXPLORER-HCM, reduction in LVOT 
gradient on mavacamten treatment was similar in subjects on background BB therapy versus those 
who were not (-37.5 mmHg vs -42.2 mmHg at rest, -50.0 mmHg vs -46.3 mmHg Valsalva). There was 
a slightly greater reduction in LVOT gradient at rest and with Valsalva manoeuvre in subjects who were 
not on background BB. Disopyramide and ranolazine are other agents which may also decrease 
contractile force, albeit via different mechanisms. Other than heart rate with regard to BB, there were 
no significant differences in parameters of LVEF or blood pressure between placebo and mavacamten 
and no excess of AEs related to heart failure regardless of background therapy for HCM.  
Despite both BB and CCB both acting to decrease myocardial contractility, combination therapy is 
sometimes necessary at the decision of the treating physician and thus is not uncommon in the 
treatment of obstructive HCM with BB-disopyramide and CCB-disopyramide being most frequently 
seen. Disopyramide was excluded in EXPLORER-HCM and this is discussed in greater detail in the 
response. While combination therapy was excluded in EXPLORER-HCM, in MYK-461-017 (VALOR-HCM) 
trial where all combinations were allowed, clinically prescribed combinations of BB-CCB (14%) and 
even triple therapy with BB-CCB-disopyramide (2.7%) were seen (refer to data in the response to 
Question 85). No excess of AEs have been seen in VALOR-HCM data. 
As such, mavacamten has been evaluated extensively in the setting of accepted background therapies 
of BB and CCB and more recently with combination therapies including those agents as well as other 
negative inotropes. This has resulted in no discernible signal for excessive decreases in cardiac 
function or risk for heart failure.

Genetic differences in PD response
Overall, 75.7% of subjects had HCM genotype assaying in the EXPLORER-HCM study (73.2% in the 
mavacamten group and 78.1% in the placebo group). The proportion of subjects with at least 1 
pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation was 31.1% in the mavacamten group and 22.0% in the 
placebo group. Four subjects (4.4%) in the mavacamten group with current HCM genotype testing had 
> 1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation identified. No subjects in the placebo group had > 1 
pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation identified. Consistent with the results from the published 
literature, the most common genes affected were MYBPC3 (12.2% of mavacamten subjects and 13.0% 
of placebo subjects) and MYH7 (7.8% of mavacamten subjects and 3.0% of placebo subjects). 
Subjects with any HCM pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation were included in a subgroup analyses 
of efficacy endpoints. Overall, there was no consistent relationship between the primary composite 
endpoint or the secondary endpoints response (including pVO2) and the genetic subgroups; the CI for 
the treatment effects were generally overlapping between subgroups (see outcomes and estimation).
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect
Exposure-response of LVEF in healthy subjects vs subjects with oHCM
Mavacamten therapy results in concentration-dependent reductions of LVEF. Baseline left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) is higher in oHCM subjects, consistent with their generally hypercontractile 
state, compared with healthy subjects. Furthermore, the slope of the concentration-dependent 
reduction in LVEF is steeper in oHCM with what appears to be a normalization of LVEF, compared with 
healthy subjects (Figure 16). Given the differences in response between healthy subjects and the 
target populations, only patient data were considered to further explore the ER relationships described 
below.

Exposure-response of LVEF in oHCM vs nHCM subjects
Nonobstructive HCM subjects had lower baseline LVEF than oHCM subjects; however, the data 
suggests once a lower baseline LVEF in nHCM is accounted for, the inverse (possibly sigmoidal-shape) 
relationship between exposure and LVEF does not differ by study population (nHCM versus 
oHCM)(Figure 17).
The evaluation of the impact of covariates on the mavacamten ER models focused on the most 
clinically relevant covariates. In the end, 5 continuous (LVEF, Valsalva LVOT gradient, NT-pro-BNP, 
lateral E/e`, and hsTroponin-I) and 6 categorical covariates (beta-blocker use (y/n), verapamil, 
diltiazem use (y/n), sex, NYHA BL (2/3), pacemaker use (y/n), population (oHCM/nHCM)) were tested 
in this ER analysis. The only 2 dependencies between covariate pairs were that nHCM subjects had 
lower baseline LVEF than oHCM subjects and that women had higher baseline LVEF than men.

Exposure-response of LVOT gradient
Mavacamten therapy results in a decaying exponential pattern with a marked beneficial effect LVOT 
gradient reduction during Valsalva in many subjects at mavacamten plasma concentrations as low as 
200 ng/mL with additional gradient reductions through 750 ng/mL in subjects with oHCM (Figure 18). 
The scatter plot also illustrates that some subjects require higher exposures to achieve a clinically 
relevant improvement in LVOT obstruction, supporting an individualized dose-titration strategy that is 
guided by directly measured LVEF and LVOT gradient by echocardiogram.

There was no significant correlation observed between baseline LVOT gradient and LVEF in either

decrease in LVEF with a greater LVOT gradient reduction from baseline in both treatment groups with a 
slightly stronger trend observed in the mavacamten treatment group (

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Pharmacokinetics
The  pharmacokinetics  of  mavacamten  have  been  investigated  in  12  dedicated  clinical  PK  studies  (11 
studies in healthy volunteers and 1 study in patients) in plasma. In addition, sparse blood samples were 
obtained in 5 clinical studies in which the efficacy and safety of mavacamten was investigated in patients 
with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Due to the significant effect of CYP2C19 phenotype on 
the PK, the starting dose is 2.5 mg with a maximum dose of 5 mg in CYP2C19 poor metabolisers and 
the starting dose is 5 mg with a maximum dose of 15 mg in CYP2C19 non-poor metabolisers.
Pharmacodynamics
Mavacamten is a first-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor representing the first medical therapy 
targeting the pathophysiology of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM). Mechanistic 
hallmarks of oHCM include excess cross-bridge formation and dysregulation of the super-relaxed state 
of myosin resulting in hypercontractility, impaired relaxation, excess energy consumption, and 
myocardial wall stress. Myosin inhibition by mavacamten reduces (or in HCM normalises) cardiac 
myosin cross-bridge formation, which normalises contractility, reduces dynamic LVOT obstruction, and 
improves diastolic dysfunction and biomarkers of cardiac stress, improving symptoms and exercise 
capacity.
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 75/277
The pharmacodynamic effects of mavacamten were evaluated after single and multiple-dose 
administrations in healthy subjects (Study MYK-461-002 and Study MYK-461-003) and subjects with 
HCM (Study MYK-461-001). In Study MYK-461-002, a single dose of mavacamten 12, 24, and 48 mg 
resulted in dose-dependent decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular 
outflow tract velocity integral (LVOT-VTI), left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS), and stroke 
volume (SV) in healthy volunteers. Additionally, a dose-proportional relationship between mavacamten 
plasma concentration and PD effects (LVEF, LVOT-VTI, LVFS and SV) was observed. No consistent, 
dose-dependent changes were evident in biplane 2- and 4-chamber left ventricular end-diastolic 
volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) and isovolumetric relaxation time. In 
Study MYK-461-003, multiple dosing of mavacamten resulted in dose-dependent decreases in LVEF, 
LVOT-VTI, and LVFS both in resting and post-exercise transthoracic echocardiography in healthy 
subjects. Additionally, multiple dosing of mavacamten resulted in dose-dependent increases in global 
longitudinal strain (GLS), LVEDV, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and left ventricular 
end-systolic diameter (LVESD). Generally, the largest effects were observed in the higher dose groups, 
i.e. 18.5 mg and 25 mg QD mavacamten. The effects caused by mavacamten were reversible as LVEF, 
LVOT-VTI, and GLS values returned toward baseline during the follow-up visits (up to Day 63) after 
discontinuation of the study drug. However, resting LVEDV, LVEDD, LVESD and LVFS values did not 
fully return to baseline by Day 63 in the higher groups of 18.5 mg and 25 mg QD mavacamten but 
were returned to baseline after 100 to 200 days post-dose. In patients with HCM (Study MYK-461-
001), a single dose of 48, 96, and 144 mg mavacamten resulted in dose-dependent decreases in LVEF, 
LVOT-VTI, LVFS, and stroke volume. Additionally, a single dose of 96 mg and 144 mg mavacamten 
resulted in dose-dependent increases in LVEDV and LVESV. 
Prolonged exposure with mavacamten in healthy subjects resulted in a concentration-dependent 
increase in QTcF. In oHCM subjects, treatment with mavacamten resulted in a slight concentration-
dependent QTcF shortening that may be partly mediated by inhibition of INaL, which is upregulated in 
HCM. Despite the slight QTcF shortening observed in oHCM subjects, the absolute values remained well 
within normal limits and represents a degree of normalization of the interval in this population, whose 
baseline QTc tends to be higher than that in healthy subjects (442 ms vs 399 ms, respectively). The 
totality of data suggests that mavacamten does not result in torsade de pointes in subjects with oHCM. 
Nevertheless, since a modest concentration-dependent QTcF prolongation in healthy subjects was 
found, ECG evaluation has been performed in subsequent clinical studies, which is considered a 
conservative and therefore acceptable approach.
No important effects on handgrip strength were observed, indicating that mavacamten specifically 
affects cardiac muscle activity, but not skeletal muscle activity, which is reassuring.
There are no pharmacodynamic interactions with accepted background therapies of beta-blockers and 
calcium channel blockers. Furthermore, there was no consistent relationship between pVO2max and 
HCM genotype.
Exposure-response analysis demonstrated a clear inverse relationship between mavacamten plasma 
concentrations versus LVEF and LVOT gradient. Nevertheless, a high interindividual PD variability (in 
addition to PK variability) has been observed, which underscores the need for an individualized dose-
titration strategy, as currently proposed by the applicant (see section “Dose-response studies”). 
Furthermore, relationship analysis of LVOT gradient versus NYHA class and pVO2max indicates that the 
largest improvements in NYHA class and pVO2max occur at LVOT gradients ≤ 30 mmHg. The baseline 
Valsalva LVOT gradient versus baseline LVEF by treatment group scatter plot showed no correlation in 
either mavacamten or placebo group. However, the absolute change from baseline in Valsalva LVOT 
gradient versus absolute change in LVEF showed a slight trend for a greater decrease in LVEF with a 
greater decrease in LVOT gradient.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The  pharmacokinetics  of  mavacamten  have  been  investigated  in  12  dedicated  clinical  PK  studies  (11 
studies in healthy volunteers and 1 study in patients) in plasma and via sparse sampling in 5 clinical 
efficacy  and  safety  studies  in  patients  with  obstructive  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy.  There  were 
concerns  regarding  effect  of  CYP2C19  phenotype  on  the  PK  and  posology  of  mavacamten.  A  revised 
posology was agreed for patients that are CYP2C19 poor metaboliser. If treatment initiation occurs prior 
to determination of CYP2C19 phenotype, patients should follow dosing instructions for poor metabolisers 
until CYP2C19 phenotype is determined.  
Generally, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mavacamten have been sufficiently 
evaluated.

2.5.5.1.  Dose response studies
The 5 mg starting dose and individualized echocardiogram-guided dose adjustments for the proposed 
posology are recommended based on the findings in the dose-ranging Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM study 
(MYK-461-004), the pivotal Phase 3 study EXPLORER-HCM (MYK-461-005) and the EXPLORER-LTE 
cohort in the ongoing extension study of long-term safety and efficacy of mavacamten (MAVA-LTE; 
MYK-461-007). The data from these studies and the clinical pharmacological knowledge of 
mavacamten have been integrated through modelling and simulation, namely population PK and PK/PD 
(E-R).
PIONEER-HCM
In the open-label dose-ranging PIONEER-HCM study, a wide exposure-response range was evaluated 
to identify the range of mavacamten plasma concentrations associated with therapeutic benefit and 
minimal risk in subjects with symptomatic HCM and LVOT obstruction. The study consisted of two-part 
(Part A (n=13)) and Part B (n=12)) and had a 12-week treatment phase followed by a 4-week 
washout phase. In Part A, which was designed to provide dose ranging information on mavacamten 
and PK/PD characterization at lower drug concentrations, the starting dose was 10mg for subjects who 
weighed ≤ 60 and 15 mg for subjects who weighed > 60 kg. In Part B, which was designed to 
characterize dose-response and to define the minimum inhibitory dose, the starting dose was 2 mg. 
Both Parts A and B had dose adjustments (based on percent decrease from baseline in LVEF (Part A) or 
LVOT gradient (Part B) at week 4. In total, 13 subjects were enrolled in Part A and 9 (69.2%) subjects 
completed the study. Four subjects discontinued the study due to failed screening (n=2) and 
withdrawn consent (n=2). In Part B, 12 subjects enrolled; 10 (83.3%) subjects completed the study 
while 2 failed Screening. The primary efficacy endpoint, change in post-exercise peak LVOT gradient 
from baseline to week 12, showed a significant 82% mean reduction from 103 ± 50 mmHg at baseline 
to 19 ± 13 mmHg at Week 12 (p = 0.008) in Part A and a significant 27% mean reduction from 86 ± 
43 to 63 ± 26 mmHg (p = 0.020) in Part B (Table 5). The primary efficacy endpoints were further 
supported by improvements in the secondary efficacy endpoints, dyspnea scores, exercise capacity 
(pVO2max) and NYHA FC for both Part A and Part B and systolic anterior motion (SAM) for Part A only. 
The observed effect is reversible considering that the LVOT gradient values returned toward baseline at 
week 16, i.e. 4 weeks after discontinuing mavacamten. Exposure-responses analyses showed a 
relationship between mavacamten plasma concentration and Valsalva LVOT gradient (Figure 23 and 
Figure 24) and LVEF (Figure 25 and Figure 26). Overall, results from this dose-ranging PIONEER-
HCM study provided the rationale for the individualized dosing algorithm based on PD and 
concentration targets used in the pivotal phase III study EXPLORER-HCM, i.e., a starting dose of 
mavacamten 5 mg and a provisional target therapeutic range of mavacamten plasma trough 
concentration between 350 and 1000 ng/mL.

Rationale for dose selection and titration regimen
Additional changes to the pivotal study EXPLORER-HCM titration scheme beyond echocardiogram-
guided dosing have been implemented in the proposed posology (Table 6). Of particular importance is 
the use of a more stringent down titration cut-off value (Valsalva LVOT gradient <20 mmHg vs <30 
mmHg); a minimum of 12 weeks and LVEF ≥55% prior to dose up-titration and a follow-up visit at 4 
weeks after any up-titration. The rationale for the dose selection and titration regimen, including these 
changes, are presented below.

Mavacamten starting dose
The results of the phase II dose-ranging PIONEER-HCM study in combination with phase I studies were 
included in the PK/PD modelling and provided the data to justify the 5 mg starting dose, the 15 mg 
maximum dose, and the dose-adjustment algorithms used in the pivotal EXPLORER-HCM study and in 
the EXPLORER-LTE cohort of the long-term extension study MAVE-LTE.
In the pivotal phase III study EXPLORER-HCM, the 5-mg starting dose was shown to be safe with the 
initial down titration capturing those subjects who required a dose reduction to 2.5 mg and no subject 
experienced a drop in LVEF <50% at the early-down titration point. By the end of the study, over 90% 
of subjects received either a 5, 10 or 15 mg dose, and only 4.9% received 2.5 mg. As in the pivotal 
study EXPLORER-HCM, the starting dose for subjects in the ongoing extension MAVE-LTE study 
(EXPLORER-LTE cohort) was 5 mg. In this study, the direct measurement of an early PD response 
(Valsalva LVOT gradient <30 mmHg), rather than plasma mavacamten concentrations, was used as 
the criterion for down-titration to 2.5 mg at Week 4. Based on the interim analysis in this study, no 
subjects reported an LVEF <50% at Week 4 and were down titrated due to meeting the early efficacy 
criteria of Valsalva LVOT gradient <30 mmHg.
According to the applicant, the starting dose of 5 mg is considered suitable for all patients, regardless 
of age, sex, body weight, CYP2C19 metabolizer status, mild or moderate hepatic or renal impairment, 
and concomitant medication. Although an increase in exposure is anticipated with certain patient 
factors, namely CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status (PMs) and lower body weight, the monitoring 
intervals prespecified in the dosing recommendations and described below are designed to effectively 
identify patients that may need dose adjustment in a timely manner.
Echocardiogram-guided dosing
The clinical experience and modelling, and simulation work support the use of clinically guided dosing 
using echocardiogram over the measurement of mavacamten plasma concentration. Both the 
pharmacologic effect of mavacamten on cardiac contractility, LVEF, and the attendant efficacy 
measure, LVOT gradient, can be readily measured on echocardiography. Additionally, due to the 
significant interindividual PK variability, monitoring of concentrations does not accurately predict LVEF. 
When study EXPLORER-HCM was initiated, limited exposure-response data were available. 
Consequently, blinded dose adjustment for individual subjects was based on a combination of clinical 
response (Valsalva LVOT gradient) and tolerability/safety (LVEF) together with mavacamten plasma 
concentrations aimed at maintaining concentrations between 350 to 700 ng/mL. Mavacamten plasma 
trough concentrations ≥1000 ng/mL or LVEF <50% triggered temporary treatment discontinuation. 
Study EXPLORER-HCM demonstrated that a starting dose of 5 mg with gradual adjustment and 
individualized up- or down-titration to doses of 2.5 to 15 mg based on echocardiography and plasma 
concentrations was safe and effective, and no excursions of plasma concentrations >1000 ng/mL 
occurred. Based on the results from study EXPLORER-HCM and PK/PD modelling, it was determined 
that echocardiographic monitoring of PD parameters (LVEF and LVOT gradient) could be utilized as a 
means to guide dose titration on an individual basis while monitoring disease status and clinical 
response after treatment initiation and at follow-up visits for up- or down-titration. The safety of dose 
adjustment based on clinically guided dose titration proposed for use in clinical practice is supported by 
data from the ongoing EXPLORER-LTE cohort and VALOR-HCM study in which titration was only based 
on monitoring of the PD parameters LVOT gradient and LVEF to manage individual patient dosing 
directly.
Dose-titration
The proposed mavacamten starting dose for all patients of 5 mg is followed by echocardiogram-guided 
dose adjustment. The rationale for the proposed mavacamten dose-adjustment regimen is to ensure 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 87/277
that the optimal dose for each individual is reached in a safe and effective manner. Careful titration 
and monitoring of the key response parameters, LVOT gradient and LVEF, are used to guide dose 
adjustment during mavacamten therapy to ensure the subject safety (i.e. few to no subjects 
experiencing LVEF <50, which is the lower limit of the normal range) and to attain the target efficacy 
criteria (Valsalva LVOT gradient <30 mm Hg).
An initial follow-up visit is proposed at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment initiation to assess for an early 
efficacy response (e.g., evidence of minimal residual obstruction [Valsalva LVOT gradient <20 
mmHg]), in which case dose reduction to 2.5 mg is recommended. The strategy for this approach at 
the initial visit window and the specified level of LVOT gradient reduction is to allow the opportunity to 
detect an early clinical response and assess tolerability (eg, maintenance of a normal LVEF and 
assessment of patient symptom status). It also ensures that the optimal dose is achieved in every 
patient at the earliest possible time point while avoiding excessive decreases in LVEF, as supported by 
PK/PD modelling. In the product information, a lower LVOT gradient threshold of <20 mmHg compared 
with <30 mmHg used in the EXPLORER-LTE cohort is proposed for down-titration due to the 
observation that many patients in the EXPLORER-LTE cohort were down titrated to 2.5 mg for an early 
response and later required up-titration back to 5 mg. The rationale for this change was supported by 
modelling and simulation to ensure patients achieved their individualized dose without any compromise 
to safety. In the EXPLORER-LTE cohort, 80 subjects who were down titrated to 2.5 mg at Week 4 (for 
LVOT gradient <30 mmHg) had a Week 12 Visit performed. At week 4, 52 (65.0%) of the 80 subjects 
had LVOT gradients <20 mmHg. Among these 52 subjects, 32.7% subsequently had LVOT gradient > 
30 mmHg at the Week 12 visit and therefore would have been considered for re-up-titration to 5 mg if 
the protocol had allowed. The other 28 (35.0%) subjects of the 80 who were down titrated to 2.5 mg 
at Week 4 had an LVOT gradient between 20 to 30 mmHg. Of these 28 subjects, 20 (71.4%) had an 
LVOT gradient > 30 mmHg at Week 12 and would have been re-up-titrated to 5 mg if the protocol had 
allowed it. Therefore, the more stringent threshold will minimize unnecessary dose fluctuations.
An increase in mavacamten dose may be considered 12 weeks after treatment initiation or after at 
least 12 weeks on a stable dose if symptoms of oHCM persist, i.e. Valsalva LVOT gradient is > 30 
mmHg, and LVEF is > 55%. A higher criterion of LVEF > 55% than the LVEF> 50% used in the clinical 
studies is proposed to ensure that a dose increase will be tolerated and provides an additional buffer 
for the expected effect on contractility with an increased dose. 
If LVEF is <50% at any visit, dosing with mavacamten should be interrupted and the patient should be 
re-assessed until LVEF is ≥50% at which point dosing at the same or lower dose can be resumed.
Monitoring intervals
Monitoring intervals in the proposed PI were modified from those used in the clinical studies based on 
modelling and simulation analysis. Based on the totality of data, the patient should be assessed for an 
early clinical response 4 and 8 weeks after treatment initiation. Patients who have not had their 
treatment paused, and who have a LVEF ≥55% and a LVOT gradient with Valsalva manoeuvre 
≥30 mmHg may have their dose increased by one level (e.g., 2.5 to 5 mg; 5 to 10 mg; 10 to 15mg; 
15 mg is the maximum daily dose) followed by a 4-week follow-up visit. This more conservative 
approach to dose increase is predicted to reduce the proportion of patients who experience an event of 
LVEF <50% compared with the schedule of potential dose increases used in the EXPLORER-LTE cohort 
(ie, at Weeks 4, 8, and 12). Once an individualised maintenance dose is achieved, patients should be 
assessed every 12 weeks. If at any visit the patient’s LVEF is <50%, the treatment with mavacamten 
should be interrupted for 4 weeks and until LVEF returns to ≥50%. Thereafter, the treatment may 
resume on the next lower dose level. The modelling and simulation work demonstrates that this 
approach for monitoring intervals ensures appropriate benefit/risk, which is supported through the 
evaluation of the time-course of mavacamten plasma concentrations, LVOT gradients, and LVEF, which 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 88/277
remain stable through 2 years of treatment and supported by available data in the ongoing study MYK-
461-007. This is consistent with observations in the ongoing study MYK-461-008, in which decreases in 
LVEF to <50% have not been observed with mavacamten treatment for up to a mean of 112.7 weeks.
The projected distribution of doses is highly similar between the proposed dosing regimen and both the 
simulated and observed distribution of doses using the MYK-461-005 titration regimen, providing 
additional support for the utility of the proposed dosing recommendations to achieve comparable 
efficacy to that achieved in the pivotal Phase 3 study MYK-461-005.
Proposed posology
Based on the collective knowledge from the clinical studies and modelling and simulation results, the 
following dosing recommendation is proposed in this study: 
-
-
-
-
-
Starting dose of 5 mg QD in all subjects
Down-titrate to 2.5 mg at 4 and 8 weeks based on Valsalva LVOT gradient <20 mmHg after 
treatment initiation
Consider step-wise dose increases (5, 10, up to a maximum of 15 mg) at Week 12, or after at 
least 12 weeks on a stable dose if 
o
o
Valsalva LVOT gradient ≥30 mmHg, and 
LVEF ≥55%
Evaluate LVEF and LVOT gradient 4 weeks after each dose increase
Discontinue dosing for 4 weeks any time LVEF is <50% and resume dosing at lower dose as 
indicated by clinical circumstances

- Known moderate or severe (as per investigator’s judgment) aortic valve stenosis at screening
Eligibility for the CMR substudy
At selected sites, subjects who provided additional, specific consent may have participated in the CMR 
substudy. To be eligible for participation in the substudy, subjects must not have had 1) an ICD or 
pacemaker or 2) Atrial fibrillation at screening (subjects who were in atrial fibrillation at the time of 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 90/277
imaging were asked to return for reassessment within 1 month, and if the subject was still in atrial 
fibrillation, they were disqualified from enrolling in the CMR substudy).
Treatments
The design of the study included a screening period of up to 35 days, a double-blind treatment period 
of 30 days in which subjects received 2.5, 5, 10 or 15 mg mavacamten or matching placebo once daily 
(1:1) , and a follow-up period of 8 weeks (or 20 weeks for subjects who chose not to roll over or were 
not eligible to roll over into MAVA-LTE) (Figure 27).
In the double-blind treatment period, eligible patients started with 5 mg mavacamten or a matching 
placebo. At Week 6, the mavacamten dose could be down-titrated based on mavacamten plasma 
concentration and echocardiography responses on week 4, i.e. assessment for an early response 
(Table 8). At Week 8 and 14 the dose could be up-titrated, down-titrated, or remained unchanged 
based on mavacamten plasma concentration and echocardiography responses on Week 6 and 12 
(Table 8 and Table 9). After the second dose adjustment at Week 14, no additional up-titrations were 
permitted. If at any subsequent on-treatment study visit (ie, Weeks 18, 22 or 26) PK and/or PD 
criteria were met for a decrease in dose, an unscheduled visit was arranged for 2 weeks later to reduce 
the mavacamten dose as outlined in Table 8. If the mavacamten dose was decreased at any time 
during the study, the subject was to continue on the reduced dose through Week 30/end of treatment 
unless safety or tolerability concerns required further dose reduction or discontinuation of study drug.

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) substudy
In addition to the primary schedule of study assessments, subjects who participated in the CMR 
substudy underwent CMR on Day 1 and at Week 30.
Objectives
The primary objective of this study was as follows:
•
To compare the effect of a 30-week course of mavacamten with placebo on clinical response 
comprising of exercise capacity and clinical symptoms in subjects with symptomatic oHCM
The secondary objectives of this study were as follows:
•
To compare the effect of a 30-week course of mavacamten with placebo on symptoms and 
LVOT obstruction as determined by Doppler echocardiography
•
To compare the effect of a 30-week course of mavacamten with placebo on exercise capacity, 
clinical symptoms, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs)
To assess the safety and tolerability of mavacamten
To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of mavacamten
•
•
The exploratory objective of this study was as follows:
•
To assess the effect of a 30-week course of mavacamten on LVOT obstruction; disease 
biomarkers; symptoms, health-related quality of life (QoL), and work activity as assessed by 
PROs; cardiac rhythm patterns as assessed by continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring; 
functional capacity as assessed by accelerometer; and risk for SCD as assessed by the HCM 
risk prediction model.
The objective of the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) substudy was as follows:
•
To assess the effect of mavacamten on cardiac mass and structure as evaluated by CMR.
Outcomes/endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint was composite functional response at Week 30, defined as achieving:
1. An improvement of ≥1.5 mL/kg/min in pVO2max as determined by CPET and a reduction of ≥1 
NYHA class or
2. An improvement of ≥3.0 mL/kg/min in pVO2max with no worsening in NYHA class.
The applicant argued that the combined interrogation of these two parameters provides 
complementary assessments of the impact of treatment on myocardial function (pVO2max) and 
symptomatic burden (NYHA class) and requiring an NYHA class improvement at the lower pVO2max 
threshold provided an increased level of stringency to support clinical relevance. In addition, this 
design was also intended to attenuate a potential placebo response rate if assessing NYHA class alone 
(up to ≈30%). Therefore, NYHA class was assessed as a component of the primary composite endpoint 
and a secondary endpoint. According to the applicant, the combination as a composite endpoint is 
supported by the fact that both measures are independent prognostic variables in HCM and allows an 
integrated assessment of both benefits on the functional and symptomatic limitations of oHCM 
patients.
The secondary efficacy endpoints, which were tested sequentially, were: 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 94/277
•
•
Change from baseline to Week 30 in postexercise LVOT peak gradient 
Change from baseline to Week 30 in pVO2max as determined by cardiopulmonary exercise 
testing (CPET)
•
Proportion of subjects who had at least 1 class of improvement from baseline in NYHA class at 
Week 30
•
Change from baseline to Week 30 in subject-reported health status as assessed by the KCCQ-
23 CSS
•
Change from baseline to Week 30 in subject-reported severity of HCM symptoms as assessed 
by the HCMSQ SoB domain score
The exploratory endpoints included absolute values and changes from baseline in multiple CPET and 
echocardiography parameters, PRO, and cardiac biomarkers. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the CMR substudy was change from baseline to Week 30 in left 
ventricular mass index (LVMI). Exploratory endpoints included changes in left atrial (LA) volume and 
LV wall thickness, volume, and function, as well as myocardial fibrosis assessed by extracellular 
volume fraction and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).
Sample size
The planned sample size of 220 subjects (1:1 ratio or 110 subjects per treatment group) was chosen 
to provide up to 96% power to detect superiority of MYK-461 in improving pVO2max and NYHA 
functional class relative to placebo with a type I error (overall 2-sided alpha) of 0.05. The power 
calculation was derived assuming a 25% difference between MYK-461 and placebo in clinical response. 
The clinical response rate for the mavacamten group was assumed to be 50% based on MYK-461-004 
and for placebo at 25%. Participants who terminate early or cannot be assessed for the clinical 
response at the end of the 30-week dosing period will be considered as non-responders. The sample 
size calculation was based on a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test for stratified categorical 
data. 
The study did not include sample-size re-estimation based on interim analysis.
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
Randomization was stratified by NYHA class (II or III), current treatment with a beta-blocker (yes or 
no), planned type of ergometer used during the study (treadmill or exercise bicycle), and consent for 
the CMR substudy (yes or no).
The study drug was administered in a double-blind manner via the IXRS, such that subjects, 
investigators and study site staff, including the pharmacist, did not know what study drugs and doses 
were administered. In addition, the sponsor, the central and core laboratories, and clinical site 
monitors were blinded to assigned treatment.
Subjects randomized to the placebo group took 1 placebo capsule by mouth once daily for 30 weeks. 
To maintain the study blind, subjects in the placebo group had the same titration assessments as 
subjects in the mavacamten group but remained on blinded placebo. To avoid bias, the IXRS randomly 
selected subjects from the placebo group to undergo unscheduled follow-up visits.
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 95/277
Members of the pharmacovigilance team were unblinded for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction (SUSAR) reporting. The independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) was provided 
unblinded safety and efficacy data for periodic review.
Statistical methods
All efficacy analyses were based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population unless otherwise noted, 
defined as all randomized subjects, regardless of whether or not they received study drug, with 
analyses conducted according to randomized treatment assignment. The composite functional endpoint 
rate was summarized by the treatment group using descriptive statistics to analyse and report the 
results. The estimates of treatment group differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on 
normal approximation were provided.
The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite functional analysis designed to capture the treatment 
effect of mavacamten relative to placebo on both symptoms and functional capacity. This primary 
composite endpoint at Week 30, was defined as achieving:
1) An improvement of ≥1.5mL/kg/min in pVO2max as determined by CPET and a reduction of ≥1 NYHA 
class or 
2) An improvement of ≥3.0mL/kg/min in pVO2max with no worsening in NYHA class 
For the primary efficacy analysis, a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test for categorical data was used 
to test the statistical significance of the difference in the composite functional endpoint rate between 
the mavacamten and placebo groups. An unstratified Chi-square test was performed as a sensitivity 
analysis.
The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was stratified for NYHA class (II or III), current treatment 
with β-blocker (yes or no) and type of ergometer (treadmill or exercise bicycle). Consent for the CMR 
substudy, which was used as a stratification factor in the randomization procedure, was not included as 
a stratification factor for the primary efficacy analysis.
No interim analysis was performed.
Missing data of pVO2max at week 30 were not imputed, and the participant was considered as a non-
responder. In the case that pVO2 at week 30 was available but NYHA class at week 30 was missing, 
the NYHA class at week 30 was imputed with the latest available record of NYHA class at week 26. 
Participants with missing response status at week 30 were classified as non-responders.
The secondary endpoints were each tested sequentially in the following order at a 2-sided alpha level 
of 0.05):
•
•
•
 Change from baseline to Week 30 in postexercise LVOT peak gradient
 Change from baseline to Week 30 in pVO2max as determined by CPET
Proportion of subjects who had at least 1 class of improvement from baseline in NYHA class at 
Week 30
•

Page 96/277
•
Change from baseline to Week 30 in subject-reported severity of HCM symptoms as assessed 
by the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Symptom Questionnaire (HCMSQ) shortness of breath (SoB) 
domain score
The CMH test was used to assess the categorical secondary endpoint (proportion of subjects who had 
at least 1 class of improvement from baseline in NYHA class) between the mavacamten and placebo 
groups. Between-group comparisons of the continuous secondary endpoints were based on analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) for LVOT gradient and pVO2max and based on a mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) for KCCQ-23 CSS and HCMSQ SoB domain score. The estimates of treatment group 
differences and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided.
Exploratory endpoints were summarized, and between-group comparisons were performed, as 
described above for secondary endpoints. The p-values generated from exploratory analyses were not 
adjusted for multiplicity and are considered descriptive.
The family wise error rate was controlled by applying a hierarchical test strategy for the primary and 
secondary endpoints.
Missing NYHA values will be handled the same way as for the primary endpoint.
Results
Participant flow
In this study, 429 potential subjects were screened, and 251 subjects (123 subjects to mavacamten 
and 128 subjects to placebo) were randomized, which all received at least 1 dose of study drug (Table 
10). The percentage of subjects who completed treatment was 97.2%, with 96.7% in the mavacamten 
group and 97.7% in the placebo group. A total of 67 subjects (26.7%) who had their Week 38/end of 
study visit via telephone communication rather than on site due to the COVID-19 pandemic were 
characterized as having discontinued the study due to “Other”. Consequently, the percentage of 
subjects who completed the study was 71.9% (71.5% and 70.3% in the mavacamten and placebo 
group, respectively). In addition to the 5 subjects who discontinued study treatment/study (2 due to 
AEs, 1 due to death, 2 subject withdrawals), 1 additional subject was lost to follow-up and did not 
complete the study, for a total of 6 subjects who discontinued the study.

Dose titration and modification
Temporary treatment discontinuation
As an additional safety precaution, dosing was temporarily discontinued if a subject met any of the 
following criteria: mavacamten plasma concentration ≥1000 ng/mL, resting LVEF <50%, or QTcF 
prolongation, based on blinded assessments at each study visit. 
No subjects met the temporary treatment discontinuation criterion of mavacamten plasma 
concentration ≥1000 ng/mL
Resting LVEF <50%
A total of 9 subjects (3.6%) had LVEF <50% (median 48%, range 35-49%) while on treatment, 
including 7 subjects in the mavacamten group (5.7%) and 2 subjects (1.6%) in the placebo group. 
Three of the 7 mavacamten subjects met the LVEF temporary discontinuation criterion at Week 6 (n = 
1) or Week 18 (n = 2). Per protocol, these subjects discontinued the study drug for a short period of 
time and subsequently resumed dosing and completed the study. For 4 mavacamten subjects, LVEF 
<50% occurred at the Week 30 visit, and no dose adjustments were made, as treatment ended at that 
visit. None of these subjects with LVEF <50% had any TEAEs of heart failure or systolic dysfunction 
coincident with LVEF reduction.
QTcF prolongation
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 99/277
Six subjects (2.4%) met the temporary discontinuation criterion of QTcF prolongation at least once 
during 30 weeks of treatment, including 3 subjects (2.4%) in the mavacamten group and 3 subjects 
(2.3%) in the placebo group. All 6 subjects underwent temporary treatment discontinuation and 
subsequently resumed dosing and completed treatment.
Dose reduction due to mavacamten plasma concentration ≥700 ng/mL to <1000 ng/mL
Across visits, 17 subjects had a total of 20 excursions of mavacamten plasma concentrations between 
700 and 1000 ng/mL (range: 703 to 844 ng/mL). For 3 of the 17 subjects, increased mavacamten 
concentrations were measured simultaneously with LVEF <50% (1 at Week 18, triggering temporary 
discontinuation of dosing and 2 at Week 30/end of treatment, with no dose reduction). A total of 13 
subjects (10.6%) receiving mavacamten had dose reductions following increases in mavacamten 
plasma concentration ≥700 ng/mL, including 8 subjects with dose reductions from 10 mg to 5 mg and 
5 subjects with dose reductions from 5 mg to 2.5 mg (Table 11). One subject with consecutive 
concentration values ≥700 ng/mL had 2 dose reductions: from 5 mg to 2.5 mg and from 2.5 mg to 
placebo. In all cases, mavacamten plasma concentrations decreased to <700 ng/mL following dose 
reduction.

Dose increases
Approximately 50% of subjects remained on mavacamten 5 mg throughout the treatment period 
(Table 12). Forty subjects (32.5%) had a dose increase from 5 to 10 mg at Weeks 8 or 14 and 
remained on 10 mg for the remainder of the treatment period; 13 subjects (10.6%) had a dose

increase from 5 to 10 mg at Week 8 and a further dose increase from 10 to 15 mg at Week 14 and 
remained on 15 mg for the remainder of the treatment period.

Protocol deviations
Important protocol deviations (IPD) were categorized depending on whether or not they were 
considered related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of subjects with IPDs not related to 
COVID-19 and with IPDs related to COVID-19 was approximately similar for the mavacamten and 
placebo groups (16.3% vs 13.3 % and 25.2% vs 28.9%, respectively) (Table 13).

Recruitment
This study was conducted at 68 centres, including 31 sites in the European Union, 29 sites in the 
United States, 6 sites in Israel, and 2 sites in the United Kingdom. Approximately half of the 
participants (n=128) were from European countries (Belgium, Czechia, Germany, Denmark, Spain, 
France, United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, and Portugal). The number of subjects enrolled 
from the European sites was equally distributed between the mavacamten and placebo groups, 64/123 
(52%) and 64/128 (50%) respectively. Other non-European countries participating in the study were 
United States (US) (43.0% subjects treated) and Israel (6.0% subjects treated). 
The first patient screened was on 30 May 2018, and the last patient observation for this report was on 
6 May 2020.
Conduct of the study
The original protocol for study MYK-461-005 was dated 14-Jul-2017. A total of 5 global amendments 
were issued. The first patient was enrolled on 25-Jun-2018 under protocol amendment 3 (21-Mar-
2018), and two amendments, 4 and 5, occurred during the conduct of the study. 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 102/277
Key efficacy changes are as follows: the primary efficacy endpoint in the original protocol initially 
assessed the improvement in pVO2max alone and was first modified with protocol amendment 2, dated 
25 Jan 2018, to a composite functional endpoint to add NYHA. The composite endpoint was defined as 
an improvement of ≥1.5 mL/kg/min in pVO2max as determined by CPET and a reduction ≥1 NYHA 
class. The primary endpoint was subsequently modified with protocol amendment 4, dated 13-Nov-
2018, in response to US health authority recommendation to include a second definition in the 
composite endpoint as follows: 1) An improvement of ≥1.5 mL/kg/min in pVO2max as determined by 
CPET and a reduction ≥1 NYHA class OR 2) An improvement of 3.0 mL/kg/min or more in pVO2max 
with no worsening in NYHA class. 
Secondary endpoints were also amended during the conduct of the study. The Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 23-item version (KCCQ-23) was changed from an exploratory to a 
secondary endpoint with protocol amendment 5. The endpoints of the proportion of subjects with post-
exercise LVOT peak gradient <30mmHg and <50mmHg at Week 30 were changed from secondary to 
exploratory endpoints under Amendment 5, dated 04-Oct-2019. 
These changes in primary and secondary endpoints were implemented at least 6 months before 
performing the primary analysis (triggered when all subjects completed 30 weeks of treatment) and 
the subsequent final database lock; the primary endpoint was updated approximately 1.5 years before 
primary data analysis. These changes therefore had no impact on the operations of data collection nor 
on the integrity of the efficacy results.
Baseline data
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics were generally similar for the mavacamten and 
placebo groups. The majority of subjects were male (59.4%) (with a greater proportion of females in 
the mavacamten group compared with the placebo group [46.3% vs. 35.2%]), white (91.2%), and not 
Hispanic or Latino (92.8%) (Table 14). The mean age of subjects was 58.5 years (range 18 to 82 
years). Mean baseline BMI was 29.4 kg/m2 (range 15.9 to 51.9 kg/m2). At baseline, the majority of 
subjects were NYHA Class II (72.9% overall), with the remainder NYHA Class III. Most subjects were 
using beta-blockers (75.3%), 16.7% were using non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers 
(verapamil or diltiazem), and 8.0% were using neither beta-blockers nor calcium channel blockers. Left 
ventricles were hypertrophic (mean LV maximum wall thickness 20 mm), and function was 
hypercontractile (mean LVEF 74%), with progressive obstruction from rest to provocation (mean 
resting LVOT gradients approximately 50 mmHg and increasing to approximately 85 mmHg after 
exercise)(Table 15). There was a high prevalence of SAM, mitral regurgitation, and LA enlargement.

HCM genotype
Overall, 75.7% of subjects had HCM genotype assayed in this study, including 73.2% (90 of 123 
subjects) in the mavacamten group and 78.1% (100 of 128 subjects) in the placebo group. The 
proportion of subjects with at least 1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation was 31.1% in the 
mavacamten group and 22.0% in the placebo group. Four subjects (4.4%) in the mavacamten group 
with current HCM genotype testing had > 1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation identified. No 
subjects in the placebo group had > 1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation identified.
For both treatment groups, the most common mutations identified were in the MYBPC3 (12.2% of 
mavacamten subjects and 13.0% of placebo subjects) and MYH7 (7.8% of mavacamten subjects and 
3.0% of placebo subjects) genes.
A total of 58.9% of mavacamten subjects and 52.0% of placebo subjects had at least 1 variant of 
uncertain significance (VUS). The most common VUSs identified were contained within the following 
genes:
• Mavacamten: FLNC (7.8%), MYH7 (5.6%), and MYBPC3 (4.4%)
• Placebo: MYBPC3 (7.0%), MYH6 (5.0%), FLNC (4.0%), and TPM1 (4.0%)
HCM-related medical history
HCM-related medical history was similar for the mavacamten and placebo groups, and for the majority 
of subjects, HCM symptoms were ongoing at baseline (Table 16). 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 107/277
Of note, fewer subjects in the mavacamten group compared with the placebo group had a history of 
atrial fibrillation (9.8% vs 18.0%, respectively). The proportion of subjects with a history of 
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), an important complication of HCM, was slightly higher for 
the mavacamten group compared with the placebo group (17.1% vs 12.5%, respectively). The overall 
history of septal reduction therapy (SRT) (myectomy or ASA) was 8.9% for the mavacamten group 
and 6.3% for the placebo group.

Concomitant medication
All subjects in the mavacamten group and 98.4% of subjects in the placebo group were taking at least 
1 concomitant medication. Across treatment groups, the 3 most common Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classes of concomitant medications were as follows:


Beta blocking agents (78.9% in the mavacamten group and 75.0% in the placebo group)
Lipid modifying agents (46.3% in the mavacamten group and 47.7% in the placebo group)
Antithrombotic agents (35.0% in the mavacamten group and 43.8% in the placebo group)
Calcium channel blocker use (verapamil or diltiazem) was reported for 20.3% of subjects in the 
mavacamten group and 13.3% of subjects in the placebo group (Table 14).
Other concomitant medications used by > 25.0% of subjects in either treatment group included 
analgesics, vitamins, diuretics, drugs for acid-related disorders, anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic 
products, and systemic antibacterials
Numbers analysed
A total of 251 subjects were randomized into the study and received at least 1 dose of the study drug 
and were included in the ITT and safety populations (Table 17). All 123 subjects in the mavacamten 
group had at least 1 detectable mavacamten plasma concentration and were included in the PK 
Population.

Outcomes and estimation
Primary endpoint
A greater proportion of subjects in the mavacamten group compared with the placebo group achieved 
the composite primary endpoint defined as achieving: 1. an improvement of ≥1.5 mL/kg/min in 
pVO2max as determined by CPET and a reduction of ≥1 NYHA class or 2. an improvement of ≥3.0 
mL/kg/min in pVO2max with no worsening in NYHA class (36.6% vs 17.2%, respectively). The 
between-group difference was 19.4% (95% CI: 8.67, 30.13; p=0.0005) (Table 18). In addition, the 
proportion of subjects who achieved both an increase of ≥3 mL/kg/min in pVO2max and an 
improvement of ≥1 NYHA class (ie, the more stringent criteria for each component of the composite 
primary endpoint) was greater for the mavacamten group compared with the placebo group (20.3% vs 
7.8%, respectively). The between-group difference was 12.5% (95% CI: 4.02, 21.01). 
There was no clear apparent concentration-response relationship within the range of concentrations 
achieved in the study.

Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint
Mavacamten showed consistent benefit for the primary composite functional endpoint and all 
secondary endpoints across a diverse range of subjects with respect to demographic characteristics, 
including age, sex, and BMI (Figure 28). The therapeutic effects of mavacamten were also observed 
across baseline disease characteristics, which included LVEF, NYHA class, NT proBNP levels, and HCM 
genotype. 
However, the magnitude of the treatment effect for the primary composite functional endpoint was 
greater for subjects who were not using beta-blockers (between-group difference 52.6%; 95% CI: 
32.9, 72.2) compared with those who were using beta-blockers (between-group difference 8.7%; 95% 
CI: -3.6, 21.1]). As expected, the mean peak heart rate with exercise was lower for subjects using 
beta-blockers compared with those not using beta-blockers (118 beats/min vs 138 beats/min, 
respectively at baseline). Similarly, mean baseline pVO2max by CPET tended to be lower for the beta-
blocker subgroup compared with the non-beta-blocker subgroup and mean (SD) change from baseline 
at Week 30 in pVO2max, a component of the composite functional endpoint, was lower for subjects 
using beta-blockers compared with those who were not using beta-blockers (1.1 [3.11] versus 2.2 
[3.04] mL/kg/min). This reflects the well-established blunting effect of beta-blockers on CPET 
performance. Furthermore, additional analyses were conducted to assess between-group differences 
by beta-blocker use (yes or no) in changes from baseline in measures of patient symptoms (NYHA 
class), health status (KCCQ-23 CSS), CPET parameters (pVO2max and VE/VCO2 slope), cardiac 
function and structure (LVOT gradient, LVEF, LAVI, and LVMI), and biomarkers of cardiac stress and 
injury (NT-proBNP and cTnI). These analyses show similar effects favouring mavacamten with 
overlapping CIs (Figure 29 and Table 19). Notably, the heart rate-independent parameter of CPET, 
VE/VCO2 slope (ventilatory efficiency) showed comparable improvements with mavacamten treatment 
compared with placebo regardless of beta-blocker use.

Secondary endpoints
Mavacamten-treated subjects demonstrated significant improvements compared with placebo for all 
secondary endpoints, including postexercise LVOT peak gradient, pVO2max, NYHA Class, KCCQ-23 
CSS, and HCMSQ SoB domain score (p-values ≤ 0.0006 for stratified and unstratified analyses)(Table 
20 and Table 21).

An LVOT peak gradient ≥50 mmHg at rest or post-exercise is the threshold for SRT eligibility. In the 
mavacamten group, 74.3% of subjects with postexercise LVOT peak gradient ≥50 mmHg at baseline 
achieved a gradient <50 mmHg at Week 30 compared with 20.8% in the placebo group (Difference 
53.5 [95% CI: 42.0, 65.0](exploratory endpoint). A peak LVOT gradient ≥30 mmHg is the criterion 
that defines obstruction in the HCM patient population. In the mavacamten group, 56.6% of subjects 
with postexercise LVOT peak gradient ≥30 mmHg at baseline achieved LVOT peak gradient <30 
mmHg at Week 30 compared with 7.0% in the placebo group (Difference 49.6 [95% CI: 39.3, 
59.9])(exploratory endpoint). With respect to Valsava LVOT peak gradient, these decreased rapidly 
upon initiation of mavacamten treatment to Week 4, decreased more gradually from Week 4 to Week 
18, and stabilized from Week 18 to Week 30 (Figure 30). The overall mean (SD) change from 
baseline to Week 30 was -49 (34.4) mmHg in the mavacamten group and -12 mmHg in the placebo 
group. The Valsalva LVOT gradient returned to baseline following 8 weeks of study drug washout. 
Similar findings were observed for changes from baseline to Week 30 in resting LVOT gradient (-39 
mmHg and -6 mmHg for the mavacamten and the placebo group, respectively). A complete response, 
defined as a reduction in resting and provoked LVOT gradients to <30 mmHg and achieving NYHA 
Class I, was demonstrated by 27% of mavacamten-treated subjects compared with 0.8 % of placebo 
subjects (Difference 26.6 [95% CI: 18.3, 34.8])(exploratory endpoint).

With respect to pVO2max, the proportion of subjects with improvements from baseline in pVO2max was 
greater for the mavacamten group compared with the placebo group across all thresholds of 
improvement. At Week 30, the proportion of subjects with an increase in pVO2max ≥1.5 mL/kg/min in 
the mavacamten group vs. the placebo group was 42% vs. 25%; the proportion of subjects with an 
increase ≥3.0 mL/kg/min was 24% vs 13%, respectively. Consistent pVO2 treatment effect in favour

For a majority of subjects in the mavacamten group (and more than twice as many as in the placebo 
group), mavacamten treatment was associated with ≥1 class improvement from baseline in NYHA 
class (65.0% mavacamten vs. 31.3% placebo, difference 33.8; 95% CI: 22.15, 45.43; p <0.0001). At 
baseline, all subjects were NYHA Class II or III; no subjects were Class I. In the mavacamten group, 
52 (42.3%) subjects improved from Class II to Class I, 19 (15.4%) subjects who improved from Class 
III to Class II, and 9 (7.3%) subjects who improved from Class III to Class I. One subject (0.8%)

worsened from NYHA Class II at baseline to Class III at Week 30 (Table 21). In the placebo group, 
31.3% (40 of 128 subjects) had an improvement of ≥1 NYHA class at Week 30, including 24 (18.8%) 
subjects who improved from Class II to Class I, 13 (10.2%) subjects who improved from Class III to 
Class II, and 3 (2.3%) subjects who improved from Class III to Class I. Nine subjects (7.0%) 
worsened from NYHA Class II at baseline to Class III at Week 30
With respect to KCCQ-23 CCS, a greater proportion of subjects in the mavacamten group compared 
with placebo achieved a clinically meaningful improvement of ≥10 points from baseline to Week 30 in 
the KCCQ-23 CSS (53.9% vs 33.8%, respectively). Similarly, a greater proportion of patients taking 
mavacamten compared to placebo achieved a clinically meaningful improvement (decrease) of ≥ 2.5 
points between baseline and Week 30 in the HCMSQ SoB domain score (50.0% vs 21.3%). At Week 
38, following 8 weeks of study drug washout, both mean KCCQ-23 CSS and HCMSQ SoB had returned 
to baseline values for the mavacamten group; the small increases from baseline seen in the placebo 
group were maintained.
Exploratory endpoints
Exercise performance by cardiopulmonary testing
Changes from baseline in CPET parameters, including increases in peak circulatory power, peak MET, 
percent predicted pVO2max, and ventilatory power and decrease in VE/VCO2 slope, were all greater for 
subjects in the mavacamten group compared with the placebo group, demonstrating overall 
improvements in exercise performance and cardiac output with mavacamten treatment (Table 22). 
Changes from baseline in RER were small and similar for both treatment groups, indicating that 
subjects attained their peak exercise in both groups.

leading to the difference shown in the figure.

Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and mitral regurgitation
Systolic anterior motion (SAM) is a paradoxical motion of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve during 
systole which can lead to septal contact, worsening LVOT obstruction and causing mitral regurgitation 
(MR). It occurs commonly in oHCM. At baseline, the proportion of subjects with SAM was similar for 
the mavacamten and placebo groups (82% and 81%, respectively). Of the subjects with SAM at 
baseline with nonmissing values at Week 30, no SAM was detected in 80.9% of subjects in the 
mavacamten group at Week 30 (76 of 94 subjects with nonmissing values) versus 34.0% of subjects 
in the placebo group (33 of 97 subjects) (Difference 46.8 [95% CI: 34.5, 59.2]). In addition, of the 
subjects with MR at baseline, 9.0% in the mavacamten group and no subjects in the placebo group had 
this resolved at Week 30 (Difference 9.0 [95% CI: 3.7, 14.3]).
Cardiac biomarkers
In mavacamten-treated subjects, NT-proBNP levels decreased rapidly during the initial 4 weeks of 
treatment and remained stable to the end of the 30 week treatment period. At Week 30, the reduction 
from baseline in NT-proBNP after mavacamten treatment was 80% greater than for placebo 
(proportion of geometric mean ratio between the 2 groups 0.20 [95% CI, 0.17 to 0.24]). With respect 
to cardiac troponin, at Week 30, the reduction from baseline in high-sensitivity (hs) cardiac troponin I 
(cTnI) after mavacamten treatment was 41% greater than for placebo (0.59 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.69]). 
At Week 38, following 8 weeks of study drug washout (for subjects with Week 38 evaluations), NT-
proBNP levels returned to baseline for the mavacamten group and remained unchanged for the placebo 
group.
LVEF
At baseline, LVEF was similar and hypercontractile for the mavacamten (74% [5.8%]) and placebo 
(74% [5.9%]) groups. There was a small mean (SD) decrease in LVEF (absolute change -4% [7.7%]) 
during 30 weeks of treatment with mavacamten compared with placebo (-0.0 [6.8]), which is within 
the variability of the measure (Figure 33). LVEF returned to baseline values following discontinuation 
of mavacamten.

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) substudy
In patients with HCM, CMR is the gold standard for measurement of ventricular mass, volumetric 
assessments, and noninvasive tissue characterization for the presence and extent of replacement 
myocardial fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). 
Results from the CMR substudy of EXPLORER-HCM showed structural changes represented by a 
reduction in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (mean between-group difference -16 g/m2; 95% CI:-
22.6, -9.0), global LV maximal wall thickness (mean between-group difference -2 mm; 95% CI: -3.9, -
0.9), and left atrial volume index (LAVI) (mean between-group difference -10 mL/m2; 95% CI: -16.0, -
4.6) over the 30 week treatment period (Table 23). LV hypertrophy and LA volumes are both indices 
of adverse prognosis in oHCM. The contractile function remains in the normal range with mavacamten 
treatment. Myocardial contraction fraction and contractile fraction (stroke volume/LV mass ratio) were 
maintained as load independent measures of LV pump reserve. No increase in cardiac fibrosis was 
observed among the mavacamten-treated subjects. Most of the subjects in the CMR substudy 
exhibited little or no replacement fibrosis at baseline as assessed by global mass of LGE and global 
percent of LGE, and there were no within- or between-group changes from baseline at Week 30.

period)(Figure 34). 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 127/277
After screening, subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the mavacamten or placebo treatment 
groups and stratified by the type of SRT procedure recommended (myectomy or alcohol septal ablation 
[ASA]) and NYHA functional class.
Placebo-controlled dosing or double-blind period (Day 1 to Week 16): On Day 1, subjects began dosing 
(blinded dose) with mavacamten 5 mg or placebo once daily for 16 weeks and were evaluated for 
possible down-titration at Week 4 based on VLVOT <30mmHg and up-titration at Weeks 8 and 12 to a 
maximum dose of mavacamten 15 mg based on LVEF ≥50% and VLVOT ≥30 mmHg (Table 25).
Active-controlled dosing period (Week 16 to Week 32): After the Week 16 assessments, subjects in the 
mavacamten group continued blinded mavacamten administration on the dose they were receiving at 
W16, and subjects in the placebo group began dosing with mavacamten 5 mg (blinded dose), once 
daily from Weeks 16 to 32. Placebo to mavacamten subjects were evaluated for possible down-titration 
at Week 20 based on VLVOT <30 mmHg and up-titration at Weeks 24 and 28 based on TTE dose 
titration guidelines of LVEF ≥50% and VLVOT ≥30 mmHg.
LTE dosing period (Week 32 to Week 128): After the Week 32 assessments, all subjects continued 
once-daily mavacamten (blinded dose) until Week 128. During this period, mavacamten dose may be 
up-titrated at any scheduled visit after Week 32 (visits scheduled every 12 weeks) if the site-read 
LVOT gradient with Valsalva manoeuvre is ≥30 mmHg and LVEF is ≥50%. Subjects whose 
mavacamten dose was increased during the LTE period attend an unscheduled study visit 4 weeks 
after the dose increase and then resume the regular study visit schedule.
At any time if LVEF <50%, then a protocol-defined temporary interruption occurred with follow-up 2-4 
weeks later. If LVEF was ≥50% at that visit, then dosing resumed at one lower dose strength. Dose 
may be down-titrated for safety at any time during the 3 dosing periods.
The study continues until Week 136 (EOS visit), following an 8-week posttreatment period. Throughout 
the study, all dose adjustments occur in a blinded manner via the IXRS.

Sample size
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
Eligible subjects will be randomized via an IXRS in a 1:1 ratio to receive double-blind treatment with 
mavacamten or matching placebo. Randomization will be stratified by the type of SRT recommended 
(myectomy or ASA) and NYHA functional class.
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 132/277
During the placebo-controlled treatment period (Day 1 to Week 16), study drug and dose will be 
blinded; and during the active-controlled treatment period (Week 16 to Week 32) and the LTE 
treatment period (Week 32 to 128) mavacamten dose will be blinded.
Sites and investigators will not be actively adjusting doses. All dose adjustments will occur in a double-
blind manner via IXRS, and all subjects, whether receiving mavacamten or matching placebo, will 
undergo assessments that could lead to a dose adjustment. Throughout the study, all study drug 
(mavacamten 2.5, 5, 10, or 15 mg and placebo-to-match mavacamten) will be dosed as a single 
capsule once daily. The sponsor, central and core laboratories, and clinical site monitors will also be 
blinded to assigned treatment. In addition, 1 or more sham temporary dose discontinuations for 
subjects in the placebo group may be performed by the IXRS to maintain the study blind during 
placebo-controlled dosing (Day 1 to Week 16).
Statistical methods
Approximately 100 subjects were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to mavacamten group and placebo 
group. This sample size provides adequate power to determine the superiority of mavacamten in 
reducing election of SRT or eligibility for SRT at the end of a 16-week treatment period. The proposed 
sample size of 50 subjects in each treatment group was to provide 95% power at a 2-sided 5% 
statistical significance level if the true SRT eligibility rates were 70% and 35% for the placebo and 
mavacamten groups respectively.
Efficacy (Primary Endpoint)
The comparison of the proportions of subjects meeting the primary endpoint between the mavacamten 
and placebo treatment groups stratified by the type of SRT procedure recommended and NYHA class 
was performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test. The point estimate and the 95% CIs 
for the treatment difference was provided.
Early termination from the study or lost to follow up prior to week 16 or other events (e.g. missed 
visit, inadequate ECHO imaging quality or other clerical reason) that led to missing data were imputed 
as SRT eligible (i.e. meeting the primary endpoint). For the intercurrent events that do not lead to 
missing data such as discontinuation of treatment or change in cardiac medication, all data collected 
was included for analysis under the ITT principle, which is the treatment policy strategy.
An additional stratification factor, baseline maximum LVOT gradient was included in the CMH test as a 
sensitivity analysis to estimate the treatment effect. A tipping point analysis was performed to assess 
the impact of the missing data and the robustness of the primary endpoint result.
Efficacy (Secondary Endpoints)
Secondary endpoints were tested in a pre-specified sequential order to control for multiplicity. 
Secondary endpoints were summarized for each treatment group at each visit using descriptive 
statistics. Change from baseline to Week 16 in post-exercise LVOT gradient was analyzed using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including treatment group, stratification factors, and baseline 
value. Proportion of subjects who had at least 1 class of improvement from baseline in NYHA class at 
Week 16 was analyzed using the same method as for the primary endpoint. Change from baseline to 
Week 16 in KCCQ-CSS, NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin I was analyzed using a mixed model with 
repeated measures (MMRM) including treatment group, stratification factors, baseline value, visit and 
visit by treatment interaction.
Missing data for LVOT gradient was imputed using a placebo-based MI approach via a regression model 
consists of placebo subjects only and including stratification factors and baseline LVOT values as

covariates. Missing data in NYHA class was imputed as ‘non-responder’, ie, for any subject whose 
NYHA class is missing at Week 16, they were considered as no improvement from the baseline. Missing 
data in KCCQ CSS, NT-proBNP, and cardiac troponin I was handled using a placebo-based MI via FCS 
regression model. For the intercurrent events that do not lead to missing data such as discontinuation 
of treatment or change in cardiac medication, all data collected was included for analysis under the ITT 
principle, which is the treatment policy strategy.
Results
Participant flow
In this study, a total of 112 subjects were randomized (56 subjects to each arm), of which 111 
received at least 1 dose of study drug (Table 27). 
The 07-Feb-2022 data cut-off date was chosen to allow all randomized subjects the opportunity to 
reach 16 week visit prior to the cut-off date. All randomized subjects have completed follow-up for 16- 
week double-blind treatment period at the time of data cut-off, except 2 subjects in placebo arm that 
discontinued study (1 subject who was withdrawn from study after receiving 1 dose as they met 
exclusion criterion of moderate to severe aortic stenosis, and 1 subject who withdrew consent after 
randomization but prior to taking their first dose).
In addition to subjects who discontinued study follow-up during the double-blind period, 2 subjects in 
mavacamten and 2 subjects in Placebo discontinued treatment as they proceeded with SRT. Therefore, 
54/56 mavacamten randomized subjects and 52/56 placebo randomized subjects completed treatment 
during the double-blind period.

Discontinuation of Study Therapy
In the double-blind period, 2 subjects in the mavacamten treatment group and no subjects in the 
placebo treatment group met the temporary discontinuation criterion of LVEF <50%. Both events 
occurred at Week 16. Both subjects were asymptomatic. After temporary discontinuation of 
mavacamten both subjects were able to resume mavacamten at 1 dose lower than they had been 
receiving at the time of the temporary discontinuation and remain in the study. Furthermore, 1 subject 
in the mavacamten group had 2 temporary interruptions of study drug for worsening atrial fibrillation 
(interruption of 1 day and 5 days; each time mavacamten was resumed at the same dose). 1 subject 
in the mavacamten group had temporary interruption of study drug for worsening palpitations, fatigue, 
and shortness of breath (subject proceeded to SRT without resuming mavacamten). 1 subject in the 
placebo group had temporary dose interruption for worsening dizziness and dyspnea (subject 
proceeded to SRT without resuming IP).
No subjects met the permanent discontinuation criteria of LVEF ≤ 30% in the double-blind period. 
However, during the long-term follow-up period, four subjects (1 in previous mavacamten group and 3 
in the previous placebo group) discontinued mavacamten to proceed to SRT.
Protocol deviations
The proportion of subjects with important protocol deviations (IPD) was approximately similar for the 
mavacamten and placebo groups (25.0% vs 26.8%, respectively) (Table 29). None of the IPDs were 
related to COVID-19.

Recruitment
This study was conducted at 19 study centers in USA.
The first patient was screened on June 2020 and the first patient was randomized on 29 July 2020. 
Conduct of study
The original protocol for study MYK-461-017 was dated 16 December 2019. As of 15 April 2022, there 
were 3 protocol amendments and 4 administrative letters. Key study level changes to Study MYK-461-

COVID-19
The first subject was randomized on 29 July 2020, which occurred during the global COVID-19 
pandemic. A COVID-19 Risk Assessment Plan was implemented to identify potential risks and 
mitigation strategies. AE’s and protocol deviations pertaining to COVID-19 were assessed and reported 
per FDA issued guidance. There were two subjects who were unable to complete a study visit within 
window due to COVID-19 infection (Week 12 and Week 32). Additionally, one subject was hospitalized 
with COVID-19 and had a delay in week 16 study visit, but the visit was completed within the allowed 
window.
Virtual/remote Site Initiation Visits (SIV) and interim monitoring visits were performed in lieu of in-
person visits as needed due to country and site restrictions, as indicated in the SMP.
Activity monitors (accelerometers) were originally distributed to sites by ActiGraph, but due to 
restrictions imposed by COVID-19, the CRO distributed in lieu of ActiGraph. Overall, there was minimal 
impact to the study conduct due to COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years.

Baseline data
Subject demographics and baseline characteristics were generally similar for the mavacamten and 
placebo groups (Table 31). The study included an US population, average age 60 years, and with a 
balanced gender ratio and average disease duration of 7 years. At baseline, the majority of subjects 
had NYHA Class III (92.0% overall) and most subjects were using beta-blocker monotherapy (45.5% 
overall). A total of 15.2% of subjects were using calcium channel blocker monotherapy. Overall, 33% 
of subjects were on combination therapy and 20% of subjects were on disopyramide monotherapy or 
in combination. The 6 subjects on no HCM medications did not tolerate standard of care (SoC) 
medications.
The proportion of subjects with each CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype was similar across treatment 
groups. Overall, majority of the subjects were rapid metabolizers, normal metabolizers, or 
intermediate metabolizers. There were 2 poor metabolizers.
The type of septal reduction therapy recommended at baseline was well balanced between the 
mavacamten and placebo groups (alcohol septal ablation 14.3% each and myectomy 85.7% each).

Baseline is defined as last non-missing measurement prior to the first dose. For subject randomized but not treated, 
the date of randomization was used to define the baseline value.
[1] n is the number of subjects with non-missing data.
[2] Pathogenic represents subjects with pathogenic result for at least one variant; VUS represents subjects with 
uncertain significance results and without pathogenic results; Negative represents subjects with benign or negative 
results; Missing include subjects who were not tested; Categories are mutually exclusive.
[3] HCM genome and CYP phenotype testing was optional and a separate informed consent form was signed if 
subject consented to these tests.
Echocardiography parameters
Baseline values for all echocardiography parameters evaluated were similar for the mavacamten and 
placebo groups (Table 32).

HCM genotype
Overall, 79.5% of subjects had HCM genotype assayed in this study, including 80.4% (45 of 56 
subjects) in the mavacamten group and 78.6% (44 of 56 subjects) in the placebo group. The 
proportion of subjects with >=1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation was 26.7% in the 
mavacamten and 18.2% in the placebo group. For both treatment groups, the most common 
mutations identified were in the MYBPC3 (17.8% of mavacamten subjects and 9.1% of placebo 
subjects) and MYH7 (2.2% of mavacamten subjects and 4.5% of placebo subjects) genes.
A total of 17.8% of mavacamten subjects and 25.0% of placebo subjects had at least 1 variant of 
uncertain significance (VUS). The most common VUSs identified were contained within the MYH7 genes 
and was similar across treatment groups.

HCM-related medical history
HCM-related medical history was generally similar for the mavacamten and placebo groups. Atrial 
fibrillation is a known complication of HCM. Of note, higher proportion of subjects in the mavacamten 
group compared with the placebo group had a history of atrial fibrillation (19.6% vs 14.5%, 
respectively)(Table 33). Accordingly, more subjects in the mavacamten group compared with the 
placebo group had cardioversion procedure for AF. Ventricular arrythmias are a known complication of 
HCM. The proportion of subjects with a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and 
implanted cardioverter defibrillator and/or pacemaker was similar for the mavacamten and the placebo 
groups (9 [16.1%] mavacamten, 10 [18.2%] placebo). History of prior septal myectomy (SRT) was 
not allowed in VALOR. One subject in the mavacamten group and 2 subjects in the placebo group had 
prior failed ASA procedures, which was allowed on approval by the MyoKardia or MedPace medical 
monitor.

HCM-Related Concomitant Medication
During the double-blind period, 92.9% of subjects in the mavacamten and 94.5% of subjects in the 
placebo group were taking at least 1 concomitant medication related to HCM. Across treatment groups, 
the 3 most common ATC classes of concomitant medications were as follows:


Long-term follow-up
As of the 07-Feb-2022 data cut, 71 subjects were randomized at least 32 weeks prior to the data cut-
off, permitting them the opportunity to have evaluable Week 32 data for this report. There were 38 
subjects in the previous mavacamten group (corresponding to 32 weeks of mavacamten treatment) 
and 33 subjects with evaluable data in the previous placebo group, (corresponding to 16 weeks of 
mavacamten exposure). Overall, 89 subjects had been exposed to at least 16 weeks of mavacamten 
treatment.
In the previous placebo group, 2 (6.1%) subjects proceeded to SRT and 3 (9.1%) subjects remain SRT 
eligible. While these subjects received mavacamten treatment in the active-controlled period of the 
study, these results are similar to those in the mavacamten arm of the double-blind period. In the 
previous mavacamten group, 2 (5.3%) subjects have proceeded to SRT and 2 (5.3%) are SRT 
guideline eligible. 
Of the original mavacamten treated subjects who were SRT eligible at Week 16, 7/8 (87.5%) subjects 
were randomized at least 32 Weeks prior to the data cut-off (Table 39). These 7 subjects have 
available Week 32 SRT guideline eligible data for this report. At Week 32, 6/7 (85.7%) subjects were 
not SRT eligible and 1 subject was SRT eligible. Of the original mavacamten treated subjects who were 
not SRT eligible at Week 16, 30/46 subjects were randomized at least 32 Weeks prior to the data cut-
off. These 30 subjects have available Week 32 SRT guideline eligible data for this report. At Week 32, 
27/30 (90%) subjects were not SRT eligible, 1 subject was SRT eligible, 1 subject was not evaluable, 
and 1 subject proceeded with SRT.

Interim analysis (cut-off date 31 August 2021) of the ongoing long-term extension (LTE) studies MYK-
461-007 (MAVA-LTE) and MYK-461-008 (PIONEER-OLE) provide supportive efficacy (Table 4).
Study MYK-461-007 has cohorts with both nHCM and oHCM subjects, enrolled from the parent Phase 2 
MYK-461-006 (MAVERICK-HCM) study and the Phase 3 MYK-461-005 (EXPLORER-HCM), respectively. 
Study MYK-461-006 was a Phase 2 study conducted in patients with nHCM that does not contribute to 
the efficacy analysis presented in this application; therefore, data from study MYK-461-007 is 
presented only for oHCM subjects enrolled from the parent Phase 3 MYK-461-005 (referred to as the 
EXPLORER-LTE cohort).
MYK-461-007: A Long-term Safety Extension Study of Mavacamten (MYK-461) in Adults with 
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Who Have Completed the MAVERICK-HCM (MYK-461-006) or 
EXPLORER-HCM (MYK-461-005) Trials (MYK-461-007; MAVA-LTE)
Methods 
The MAVA-LTE study (Study MYK-461-007) is an ongoing Phase II/III, dose-blinded, 5-years long-term 
extension (LTE) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability of mavacamten in subjects with symptomatic 
oHCM who completed the pivotal Phase 3 MYK-461-005 (EXPLORER-HCM) study through Week 38 
(EXPLORER-LTE Cohort) and in subjects with symptomatic nHCM who completed the Phase 2 
MAVERICK-HCM study through Week 24 (MAVERICK-LTE Cohort): Considering the proposed indication, 
i.e. treatment of symptomatic oHCM subjects, only results of the EXPLORER-LTE Cohort are discussed 
in the efficacy section. After the washout period (minimal 8 weeks) of the parent study, subjects 
enrolled in this LTE started with 5 mg mavacamten once daily unless at the end of treatment (EOT) in 
the parent study the subject had a dose of 5 mg and mavacamten plasma concentration ≥700 ng/mL, 
in which case the starting dose in this LTE study was 2.5 mg mavacamten. At Week 4, the 
mavacamten dose could be down-titrated based on site-read echocardiograms of Valsalva LVOT 
gradient and LVEF, i.e. assessment for an early response. At Week 8 and 12, the dose could be up-
titrated, down-titrated, or remained unchanged based on Valsalva LVOT gradient and LVEF. At week 
24, the dose could also be up-titrated, down-titrated, or remained unchanged; however, this dose 
adjustment was based on post-exercise LVOT gradient and LVEF. Stress echocardiography with 
assessment by the site of the post-exercise gradient was conducted at Week 24 to determine if further 
dose adjustment could be considered by the investigator. At any visit after Week 24, if the site-read 
LVOT gradient with Valsalva manoeuvre was > 30 mmHg and LVEF ≥50%, then a dose increase may 
have been considered after discussion with the Medical Monitor. Temporary discontinuation criteria 
were defined per protocol as LVEF <50%, mavacamten concentration ≥1000 ng/mL, and/or increase in 
the Fridericia-corrected QT interval (QTcF) interval 15% above baseline or QTcF ≥520 ms.
Results
As of the interim data cut-off date of 31 August 2021, 231 subjects (97.9%) with symptomatic oHCM 
who completed the pivotal Phase 3 study EXPLORER-HCM had enrolled in the EXPLORER-LTE cohort of 
MAVE-LTE. Among the 231 subjects enrolled, 11 (4.8%) had discontinued the study as of the data cut-
off date due to an adverse event (n=2), death (n=3), stopping criteria (n=3), withdrawal by subject 
(n=2) or other (n=1). The high retention rates on the study have contributed to 317 patient-years of 
exposure. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were subjects who either had a dose interruption or 
missed clinic visits. As such, 28 subjects re-enrolled in the study and started treatment again. As of 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 157/277
the data cut-off date, the majority (88.7%) of subjects in the EXPLORER-LTE cohort had completed 
mavacamten treatment through at least Week 48 and 14.7% of subjects reached Week 96.  
The majority of subjects had hypercontractile left ventricular function as evidenced by elevated LVEF 
(mean LVEF 74%) and demonstrated worsening obstruction with provocation (mean resting LVOT 
gradient 48 mmHg, increasing to 69 mmHg with Valsalva). The majority of subjects (65.8%) were 
NYHA Class II at baseline. The baseline median (Q1, Q3) NT-proBNP concentration was 783 (326, 
1593) ng/L.
Dose titration and modification
Table 44 provides the mavacamten dose by study visit from Day 1 through to Week 120 (number of 
subjects per study dose over time) of all available data in the MAVA-LTE study per data-cut 
31-Aug-2021. At Week 4, 109 subjects were dose reduced from 5 mg to 2.5 mg. In the SmPC 
posology, the applicant proposes to use a lower LVOT of <20 mmHg as criteria for dose reduction. This 
proposal is based on an analysis that indicated that many of these subjects would have avoided a 
down-titration at Week 4 if the LVOT criteria had been <20 mmHg (35% of 80 patients) (see also 
dose-response studies).

While on treatment, 26 (11.3%) subjects underwent a temporary discontinuation due to LVEF <50% 
(n=10), LVEF <50% and mavacamten plasma trough concentration ≥1000 ng/ml (n=2), only 
mavacamten plasma trough concentration ≥1000 ng/ml (n=6), both mavacamten plasma trough 
concentration ≥1000 ng/ml and QTcF (n=1), and only prolonged QTcF (n=7). Out of the 26 subjects, a 
total of 9 subjects permanently discontinued the study. Of these 9 subjects, 3 subjects were later re 
enrolled as allowed per protocol. Additionally, 5 patients underwent a dose decrease based on the 
decision by the principal investigator.
LVOT peak gradient
Improvements from baseline in LVOT obstruction assessed by echocardiography in this LTE was 
consistent with those observed in study EXPLORER-HCM. There were rapid and sustained 
improvements in Valsalva LVOT gradients as early as Week 4 sustained through Week 96 of 
mavacamten treatment and beyond (Figure 35). Early gradient improvement was seen between Day 
1 (study treatment is commenced on Day 1) and Week 4, reduction in gradient are seen through dose 
titrations stages at Week 4,8,12 and then some further adjustment in the gradient is seen at Week 24 
and beyond with dose titrations that are allowed per protocol. Overall, site-read echocardiographic

values were consistent and in agreement with central laboratory readings resulting in the same dosing 
decisions up to Week 96 of mavacamten treatment.

NYHA class
Clinical status based on NYHA functional class improved from baseline (Figure 36) and was generally 
sustained throughout the duration of the observation period. At Week 48, 67.4% of subjects had an 
improvement in ≥1 NYHA class relative to the baseline assessment that was sustained through Week 
108 and Week 120, although numbers are small at these later timepoints.

NT-proBNP
Rapid and sustained improvements in NT-proBNP (core lab) were seen as early as Week 4 with start of 
treatment; some adjustment is seen during the dose titration stages, and further reductions are noted 
at Week 24 and beyond with dose adjustments that are allowed per protocol (Figure 37).

LVEF
Mean baseline LVEF was hypercontractile, at 74%. Consistent with the mechanism of action of 
mavacamten, a small reduction in mean LVEF is seen upon initiation of treatment at study Day 1 
(Figure 38). A further reduction in LVEF is seen between baseline and Week 24 (titration stages), 
which then levels to steady and consistent measurements. The number of subjects reaching Week 84 
and beyond in this data cut decreases to <100. At Week 120, only 2 patient's data are represented 
and thus, the mean LVEF is maintained and similar to prior timepoints.

Other echocardiogram parameters 
At the conclusion of the 24-week dose-titration period and consistent with the known mavacamten 
mechanism of action and as seen in the parent study, mean (SD) LVESVI had increased by 2.7 (4.6) 
mL/m2 and LVEDVI had remained stable throughout the assessment period (0.1 ml/m2) (Table 45). At 
Week 96, the mean (SD) changes from baseline in LVES and LVEDVI were 2.5 (3.9) mL/m2 and 0.19 
(8.2) mL/m2, respectively. Consequently, mean (SD) LVSV as measured by resting echocardiographic 
parameters had decreased from baseline by 5.4 (11.6) mL at Week 24 and by 5.2 (12.3) mL at Week 
96. Little to no change from baseline in echocardiographic measures of interventricular septal or 
posterior wall thicknesses or the LVMI, which is derived in part from these parameters, were reported 
for the ITT Population up to Week 96 of mavacamten treatment (Table 45).

Diastolic function and left atrial size
Doppler parameters of diastolic function and LA size were assessed at baseline and every 24 weeks 
thereafter. For each of these parameters, changes over time were directionally favourable (Table 46). 
There were decreases in E/e’ (both lateral and septal), consistent with a reduction in LV filling 
pressure, during long-term treatment with mavacamten. Consistent with the beneficial trends seen for 
diastolic function parameters, reductions from baseline in LAVI were constantly seen from Week 24 
through Week 96.

Among the subjects who had non-missing data of SAM and MR at both baseline and Week 24, the 
percentage of subjects with presence of SAM decreased from 78.7% to 34.3% and the percentage of 
subjects with presence of MR decreased from 94% to 83.4%. Among the subjects who had non-
missing data of SAM and MR at both baseline and Week 48, the percentage of subjects with presence 
of SAM decreased from 77.7% to 19.8%, and the percentage of subjects with presence of MR 
decreased from 94.5% to 74.1% (Table 47).

MYK-461-008: An Open-label Extension Study of Mavacamten (MYK-461) in Adults with 
Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Previously Enrolled in Study MYK-
461-004 (PIONEER-HCM)
Methods
MYK-461-008 is an ongoing Phase II, multicenter, open-label 5-year long-term extension study 
evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of mavacamten in subjects with symptomatic oHCM 
who completed the 16-week PIONEER-HCM (MYK-461-004) study. Eligible subjects underwent baseline 
assessments and started a once-daily (QD) dosing regimen with 5 mg mavacamten. Individualized 
target doses, which were based on maintaining a study drug plasma concentration between 
approximately 250 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL, were determined for each subject prior to the start of the 
study. The target dose (5, 10 or 15 mg) was based on the subject’s mavacamten plasma 
concentrations and study drug dose in the parent study. If the target dose was greater than the 5 mg 
QD starting dose, the dose was increased at Week 6, unless any of the following conditions were met: 
a) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was <55%, and/or b) LVOT gradient was <30 mmHg after 
exercise, and/or c) trough mavacamten plasma concentration was > 350 ng/mL, and/or d) a dose 
increase was not warranted in the clinical judgment of the Investigator. System-guided notification for 
temporary discontinuation was triggered if a subject had any of the following values: mavacamten 
plasma concentration ≥1000 ng/mL, LVEF <45%, or prolonged Fridericia-corrected QT (QTcF) interval 
[defined as a 15% increase over baseline or an absolute QTcF ≥520 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or ≥550 ms 
(if QRS ≥120 ms)]. Study drug dosing could be resumed at a lower dose per protocol upon appropriate 
clinical assessment within the pre-specified time period.

The mean (SD) duration of treatment interval between parent and extension study was 53.30 (15.704) 
weeks (median (min, max): 52.57 (30.9, 76.3). Thirteen 13 subjects with symptomatic oHCM who 
completed the Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM study had enrolled Study MYK-461-008 (PIONEER-OLE). Twelve 
subjects were on-treatment during the previous data cut-off date of 30-Oct-2020 and have remained 
on-treatment as of the latest data cut-off date of 31 Aug 2021. Of the 13 subjects who entered the 
study, 12 (92%) completed assessments at least through Week 144 and 9 (69%) completed through 
Week 156. No subject met the study stopping criteria, or the protocol defined temporary 
discontinuation criteria. One subject discontinued treatment on Day 175 (Week 25) due to a TEAE and 
subsequently discontinued the study (Day 182). Nine (69.2%) subjects had a planned dose increase 
per protocol from the 5-mg starting dose based on a pre-determined target dose. One subject had an 
interruption in treatment of 18 days at the Week 72 visit due to conditions created by the COVID-19 
pandemic. The subject resumed treatment at the same dose level following this interruption.
LVOT peak gradient
Similar to the MAVA-LTE study (EXPLORER LTE cohort), in the PIONEER-OLE study there were rapid 
and sustained improvements in resting and Valsalva LVOT gradients from baseline to Week 12 and in 
post-exercise LVOT gradient from baseline to Week 48, all sustained through Week 156 (Figure 39).

Improvements from baseline in oHCM symptoms assessed by NYHA class in Study MYK-461-008 was 
consistent with those observed in study MYK 461-005 (Figure 40).

LVEF
Group mean (SD) LVEF was 72% (4.9%) at baseline. Subsequently, at each scheduled clinic visit after 
initiating mavacamten dosing, as expected, modest mean changes from baseline were noted (at Week 
96 mean [SD] change, -6% [8.3%]); LVEF was maintained above 50% in all subjects throughout the 
observation period (Figure 42).

Patient Reported Outcomes (KCCQ)
As the study progressed, group mean scores increased across all categories indicating improvement in 
all domains, which translates to a subjective impression of decreased disease burden and increased 
satisfaction with outcome. Of note, there was improvement in mean scores as early as Week 4, with 
clinically meaningful improvements noted from Week 8 that were sustained throughout the observation 
period. At Week 96, the mean (SD) change in the clinical summary score (CSS) was 17.6 (17.4).
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
This application is based on efficacy data from the phase II dose-finding study PIONEER-HCM (Study 
MYK-461-004) and the pivotal phase III studies EXPLORER-HCM (Study MYK-461-005) and VALOR-
HCM (Study MYK-461-017; ongoing). Supportive data are obtained from the EXPLORER-LTE cohort of 
the ongoing long-term extension study MAVA-LTE (Study MYK-461-007) and the ongoing PIONEER-
OLE study(Study MYK-461-008). 
Dose selection. Available clinical data of the phase I studies and the phase II dose-finding study 
PIONEER-HCM and modelling/simulation (see section regarding clinical pharmacology) have been 
used to select the most appropriate dosing regimen for the pivotal study EXPLORER-HCM. PIONEER-
HCM was an open-label, dose-finding phase II study to evaluate PK/PD at different drug concentrations 
and to define the minimum inhibitory dose over 12 weeks in patients with oHCM. The study consisted 
of two parts with a dose range of 5 to 25 mg in Part A (n=13) and a dose range of 2 to 5 mg in Part B 
(n=12). The primary efficacy endpoint, change in post-exercise peak LVOT gradient from baseline to 
week 12, showed a significant 82% mean reduction from 103 ± 50 mmHg at baseline to 19 ± 13 
mmHg at Week 12 (p = 0.008) in Part A and a significant 27% mean reduction from 86 ± 43 to 63 ± 
26 mmHg (p = 0.020) in Part B. The primary efficacy endpoints were further supported by 
improvements in the secondary efficacy endpoints, dyspnoea scores, exercise capacity (pVO2max) and 
NYHA FC for both Part A and Part B and systolic anterior motion (SAM) for Part A only. The observed 
effect is reversible considering that the LVOT gradient values returned toward baseline at week 16, i.e. 
4 weeks after discontinuing mavacamten. Exposure-response analyses showed a clear relationship 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 169/277
between mavacamten plasma concentration and Valsalva LVOT gradient and LVEF. Reductions in 
Valsalva LVOT gradient to below 30 mmHg as a peak LVOT gradient ≥30 mmHg is the criterion that 
defines obstruction in the HCM patient population. LVEF was measured to ensure subject 
safety/tolerability (normal range: LVEF > 50%). Mavacamten plasma concentrations <1000 ng/mL 
were generally well tolerated, while concentrations > 1000 ng/mL were associated with changes to 
below-normal values in LVEF. To conclude, exposure-response analyses showed on average reductions 
in LVOT gradient to levels <30 mmHg while maintaining normal LVEF (50%-70%) at mavacamten 
plasma concentrations between 350 ng/ml and 1000 ng/ml. Furthermore, PK analysis showed that 
there is no clear dose-exposure relationship on the individual level due to high PK intra- and 
interindividual variability (See section “Pharmacokinetics”). Overall, results from the dose-ranging 
PIONEER-HCM provided the rationale for the individualized dosing algorithm based on PD and 
concentration targets used in the pivotal phase III study EXPLORER (MYK-461-005), i.e., a starting 
dose of mavacamten 5 mg and a provisional target therapeutic range of mavacamten plasma trough 
concentration between 350 and 1000 ng/mL.
Changes to the dosing regimen from those used in the pivotal studies EXPLORER-HCM (and its 
extension study) and VALOR-HCM have been proposed for the product information. The changes 
included the use of a more stringent down titration cut-off value (Valsalva LVOT gradient <20 mmHg 
vs <30 mmHg), a minimum of 12 weeks and LVEF ≥55% prior to dose up-titration, and a follow-up 
visit at 4 weeks after any up-titration. The rationale and justification for the different components for 
the proposed dosing regimen in the SmPC are discussed below.
The starting dose of 5 mg has been selected based on the results of the dose-finding phase II study 
PIONEER-HCM, the pivotal phase 3 study EXPLORER-HCM, and the EXPLORER-LTE cohort, which 
demonstrated that this dose was well tolerated, with a minority of subjects requiring down-titration to 
the 2.5 mg dose at the early-down titration point or later during the study. The starting dose was 
further justified by modelling and simulation. Furthermore, the applicant claims that this starting dose 
of 5 mg can be used for all patients regardless of age, sex, body weight, CYP2C19 metabolizer status, 
mild or moderate hepatic or renal impairment, and concomitant medication. Considering that CYP2C19 
poor metabolizers have a ~3-fold increase in mavacamten plasma exposure, an adjusted posology for 
CYP2C19 poor metabolizers is recommended in the SmPC (see also “Pharmacokinetics”). 
Due to high intra- and interindividual PK variability, echocardiogram-guided dosing based on LVEF and 
LVOT gradient instead of dosing based on mavacamten plasma concentration to ensure patient safety 
and monitoring of response, has been proposed. In the pivotal study EXPLORER-HCM, dose 
adjustments were based on echocardiogram parameters Valsalva LVOT and LVEF combined with 
mavacamten plasma concentrations. Nevertheless, the safety of echocardiogram-guided dosing 
proposed for use in clinical practice is supported by data from the ongoing EXPLORER-LTE and the 
ongoing VALOR-HCM study.
The starting dose is followed by echocardiogram-guided dose-titration based on LVOT gradient to 
attain the target efficacy criteria (Valsalva LVOT gradient <30 mmHg) and LVEF to ensure subject 
safety (LVEF > 50%, which is the lower limit of the normal range). After initiation of treatment, an 
initial follow-up visit at Week 4 and Week 8 is proposed to assess for an early efficacy response and 
tolerability. More specifically, in the pivotal EXPLORER-HCM, subjects were down-titrated to 2.5 mg if 
the mavacamten concentration was 700 to 1000 ng/ml (based on Week 4 PK). Moreover, in the 
EXPLORE-LTE cohort, subjects were down-titrated to 2.5 mg if the Valsalva LVOT gradient was <30 
mmHg, whereas in the SmPC, subjects will down-titrate to 2.5 mg if Valsalva LVOT gradient is <20 
mmHg. The lower LVOT gradient threshold of <20 mmHg was based on simulations which showed that 
with this level, fewer patients would experience a “yo-yo” effect in their dosing as was observed in the 
EXPLORER-LTE. Moreover, the target efficacy criterion of Valsalva LVOT gradient <30 mmHg is 
endorsed since, according to the ESC guideline, obstructive HCM is defined as peak LVOT gradient ≥30 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 170/277
mmHg at rest or during the Valsalva manoeuvre. Also, in this respect, the lower Valsalva LVOT 
gradient threshold of <20 mmHg for down-titration is considered more appropriate than the 30 mmHg 
threshold. Otherwise, in both the clinical studies and the proposed SmPC, if LVEF remains > 50%, the 
dose of 5 mg once daily should be maintained, whereas if the LVEF <50% (at any visit), treatment 
should be temporarily discontinued.
According to the proposed SmPC, a dose increase may be considered 12 weeks after treatment 
initiation or after at least 12 weeks on a stable dose if symptoms of oHCM persist, i.e. Valsalva LVOT 
gradient is > 30 mmHg and LVEF > 55% ( e.g., 2.5 to 5 mg; 5 to 10 mg; 10 to 15mg; 15 mg is the 
maximum daily dose), followed by a 4-week follow-up visit. The higher criterion of LVEF> 55% than 
the LVEF > 50% used in the clinical studies is considered a conservative approach, which is endorsed. 
Once an individualised maintenance dose is achieved, patients should be assessed every 12 weeks. 
Regarding re-dosing, if at any visit the patients LVEF is <50%, the treatment with mavacamten should 
be interrupted for 4 weeks until LVEF returns to ≥50%. Thereafter, the treatment may resume on the 
next lower dose level.
Design of the main clinical studies
EXPLORER-HCM; Study MYK-461-005
EXPLORER-HCM was a phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 
international, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mavacamten 
compared with placebo in subjects with symptomatic oHCM.
The inclusion criteria are reflected in the indication as proposed. Key inclusion criteria included 
diagnosis with oHCM defined by 1) unexplained LV hypertrophy with nondilated ventricular chambers in 
the absence of other cardiac (e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis) or systemic disease and 2) with 
maximal LV wall thickness ≥15 mm (or ≥13 mm with a positive family history of HCM) and LVOT peak 
gradient ≥50 mmHg during screening as assessed by echocardiography at rest, after Valsalva 
manoeuvre, or post-exercise; LVOT gradient with Valsalva manoeuvre at screening ≥30 mmHg; and 
NYHA Class II or III symptoms at screening. The diagnosis of oHCM is in line with the ESC guidelines. 
According to the ESC guideline, LVOT obstruction is defined as LVOT gradient ≥30 mmHg at rest or 
during physiological provocation, such as Valsalva. Additionally, a LVOT gradient of ≥50 mmHg at rest 
or LVOT gradient of ≥50 mmHg during Valsalva or post-exercise in symptomatic patients is usually 
considered to be the threshold at which LVOT obstruction becomes haemodynamically important, and 
treatment of LVOT obstruction is recommended. As such, the inclusion criteria identify patients with 
oHCM for whom (additional) treatment is recommended according to the guideline. Since mavacamten 
causes a reduction in LVEF, the higher criterion of LVEF> 55% than the lower limit of the normal range 
(LVEF > 50%) was used as an inclusion criterion to ensure subject safety, which is considered 
appropriate. According to the ESC guideline, the current medicinal standard of care for patients with 
oHCM includes non-vasodilating beta-blockers (first-line therapy), calcium channel blockers 
(recommended for patients intolerant or have contraindications to beta-blockers), and disopyramide 
(in addition to a beta-blocker (or, if this is not possible, with verapamil). The combination of a beta-
blocker and a calcium channel blocker is not recommended according to the ESC guideline which is 
also reflected in the exclusion criteria. However, since the optimal standard of care for oHCM was not 
included as an inclusion criterion, the applicant was requested to confirm that the proportion of 
patients on beta-blockers (75.3%) or calcium channel blockers (16.7%) as background therapy is in 
line with the current standard of care. The same issue applied to septal reduction therapy (7.6%). The 
applicant argued that the percentage of patients using beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers or 
underwent septal reduction therapy enrolled in the EXPLORER-HCM study is generally in line with what 
is observed in the Cardiomyopathy Registry of the EURObservational Research Program (ERP). Patients 
treated with disopyramide were excluded from the EXPLORER-HCM study due to the possibility of 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 171/277
excessively reducing cardiac contractility with the concomitant use of 2 negative inotropes. Two 
patients were excluded from the study as they were taking disopyramide and 21 subjects had 
previously taken disopyramide (11 vs 10 in the mavacamten and placebo group, respectively), but 
discontinued at least 14 days prior to mavacamten therapy. Considering that the number of subjects 
who previously took disopyramide is well balanced between the groups, any potential rebound effect 
would be similarly balanced between the two groups resulting in no effect on the results of EXPLORER-
HCM. In the ongoing VALOR-HCM study disopyramide was allowed as a concomitant mediation. 
Approximately 20% of the patients were receiving disopyramide along or with beta-blocker and/or a 
calcium channel blocker and, to date, no excess of adverse events in this specific subgroup have been 
observed. 
The design of EXPLORER-HCM generally appeared appropriate. The duration of the screening period, 
up to 35 days, is appropriate. In the randomized, double-blind treatment period of 30 weeks, eligible 
patients started with 5 mg mavacamten or matching placebo (1:1 randomization). At Week 6, the 
mavacamten dose could be down-titrated based on mavacamten plasma concentration and 
echocardiography responses on week 4, i.e. assessment for an early response. At Week 8 and 14 the 
dose could be up-titrated, down-titrated, or remain unchanged based on mavacamten plasma 
concentration and echocardiography responses on Week 6 and 12.
The primary endpoint was a composite functional response at Week 30, defined as achieving: 1. an 
improvement of ≥1.5 mL/kg/min in pVO2max as determined by CPET and a reduction of ≥1 NYHA class 
or 2. an improvement of ≥3.0 mL/kg/min in pVO2max with no worsening in NYHA class. The applicant 
argued that the combined interrogation of these two parameters provides complementary assessments 
of the impact of treatment on myocardial function (pVO2max) and symptomatic burden (NYHA class) 
and that requiring an NYHA class improvement at the lower pVO2max threshold provided an increased 
level of stringency to support clinical relevance. According to the applicant, the combination as a 
composite endpoint is supported by the fact that both measures are independent prognostic variables 
in HCM and allow an integrated assessment of both benefits on the functional and symptomatic 
limitations of oHCM patients. However, the Rapporteur considers that neither exercise capacity nor 
NYHA class are validated surrogates for morbidity/mortality in the context of oHCM treatment. 
According to the EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of 
chronic heart failure (CPMP/EWP/235/95, Rev.2), exercise capacity may be acceptable as a primary 
efficacy endpoint, in case the result is supported by secondary endpoints that meaningfully contribute 
to the understanding of the clinical relevance of the effect (e.g. hospitalization for heart failure, 
syncope, quality of life) and the cardiovascular safety profile of the product can be adequately 
characterised. As such, pVO2max would be considered acceptable as a primary efficacy endpoint, as 
also previously mentioned in the 2017 CHMP scientific advice. However, the composite primary 
endpoint, which is based on pVO2max and NYHA class, is difficult to interpret. The functional capacity 
component of the endpoint refers to thresholds for increase in pVO2max, of which the relevance is not 
fully justified in the submitted dossier. The NYHA component of the endpoints is suitable as a 
secondary endpoint or in support of a functional endpoint but usually not as a component of the 
primary endpoint (see EMA Guideline; CPMP/EWP/235/95, Rev.2). In this respect, the focus in this 
application was on the data of the individual component pVO2max (which was assessed as a secondary 
endpoint) rather than on the responder definition in the composite primary endpoint. In addition to 
pVO2max and NYHA class, other relevant key secondary endpoints are included, such as a change from 
baseline to Week 30 in post-exercise LVOT peak gradient and patient-reported outcomes (Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ-23 CSS) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy symptom 
questionnaire (HCMSQ SoB). Additionally, exploratory endpoints included absolute values and changes 
from baseline in multiple CPET and echocardiography parameters and cardiac biomarkers. Moreover, a 
cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) substudy has been included in order to assess the change from 
baseline to Week 30 in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and exploratory endpoints, including changes 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 172/277
in left atrial (LA) volume and LV wall thickness, volume, and function, in order to adequately evaluate 
the cardiac structure and function, which is considered appropriate. 
The planned sample size of 220 subjects (1:1 ratio or 110 subjects per treatment group) was chosen 
to provide up to 96% power to detect the superiority of mavacamten in improving pVO2max and NYHA 
functional class relative to placebo with a type I error (overall 2-sided alpha) of 0.05. The power 
calculation was derived assuming a 25% difference between mavacamten and placebo in clinical 
response. The clinical response rate for the mavacamten group was assumed to be 50% based on 
PIONEER-HCM and for placebo at 25%. Participants who terminate early or cannot be assessed for the 
clinical response at the end of 30-week dosing period will be considered as non-responders. The 
sample size calculation was based on a 2-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test for stratified 
categorical data. The study did not include sample-size re-estimation based on interim analysis.
The randomisation and blinding procedures are acceptable. 
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test for stratified categorical data was used for the statistical 
analysis of the primary endpoint. That is to test the statistical significance of the association between 
clinical response status (responders vs non-responders) and treatment group (mavacamten vs 
placebo). The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was stratified for all the stratification factors 
which were used in the randomization procedure except for consent for the CMR substudy. This is 
considered acceptable. A composite strategy was used to handle missing pVO2max data, according to 
which participants who dropped-out of the study were considered as non-responders. Missing NYHA 
class measurements were imputed using LOCF. The handling of intercurrent events is considered 
acceptable. Components of the composite primary endpoint were also assessed individually. This is 
endorsed and considered necessary, as explained above. The overall type-I error rate was controlled 
by applying a hierarchical test strategy. This is considered acceptable. The CMH test was also used to 
assess the categorical secondary endpoint (proportion of subjects who had at least 1 class of 
improvement from baseline in NYHA class) between the mavacamten and placebo groups. This is 
considered acceptable. Between-group comparisons of the continuous secondary endpoints were based 
on analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for LVOT gradient and pVO2max and based on a mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) for KCCQ-23 CSS and HCMSQ SoB domain score. These methods are 
considered acceptable. 
 Study MYK-461-017 (VALOR-HCM)
MYK-461-017 is an ongoing Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study 
of mavacamten vs. placebo in adults with symptomatic oHCM who met 2011 ACCF/AHA guideline 
criteria for SRT and have been referred for an SRT procedure within the past 12 months in the USA. As 
of 07 February 2022 (the clinical cut-off data of the primary CRS), all subjects participating in the 
study completed the study through Week 16 and, as such, the primary analysis was conducted.
The inclusion criteria/exclusion criteria are considered appropriate. Key inclusion criteria included 
diagnosis with oHCM defined by 1) unexplained LV hypertrophy with nondilated ventricular chambers in 
the absence of other cardiac (e.g., hypertension, aortic stenosis) or systemic disease and 2) with 
maximal LV wall thickness ≥15 mm (or ≥13 mm with a positive family history of HCM) and the patient 
should meet ACCF/AHA 2011 guideline recommendations for invasive SRT therapies. In the AHA 
guideline, patients eligible for invasive therapies should have a) severe dyspnoea or chest pain (usually 
NYHA Class III/IV) or occasionally other exertional symptoms (such as syncope or near syncope) that 
interfere with every day activity or quality of life despite optimal medical therapy; b) dynamic LVOT 
gradient at rest or with physiologic provocation ≥50 mmHg associated with septal hypertrophy and 
SAM of the mitral valve; c) targeted anterior septal thickness sufficient to perform the procedure safely 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 173/277
and effectively in the judgement of the individual operator. The requirements are generally in line with 
the ESC guideline (2014), which states that invasive treatment to reduce obstructive LVOT should be 
considered in a patient with a resting of maximum LVOT gradient ≥50 mmHg, moderate-to-severe- 
symptoms (NYHA III-IV) and/or recurrent exertional syncope in spite of maximally tolerated drug 
therapy. 
The design of VALOR-HCM generally appeared appropriate. After the screening period of up to two 
days, eligible patients started with 5 mg mavacamten or a matching placebo (1:1 randomization) once 
daily for 16 weeks (placebo-controlled dosing or double-blind period). At Week 4, the mavacamten 
dose could be down-titrated based on the echocardiographic response, e.g. VLVOT <30 mmHg and up-
titrated at Week 8 and 12 to a maximum dose of 15 mg based on LVEF ≥50% and VLVOT ≥30 mmHg. 
After 16 weeks, subjects in the mavacamten group continued blinded mavacamten treatment, whereas 
subjects in the placebo group started with 5 mg mavacamten (blinded dose) once daily from Week 16 
to 32 (active-controlled dosing period). The criteria for down- or up-titration were similar as the 
placebo-controlled dosing period, which is appropriate. In the placebo-controlled period the study drug 
and dose were blinded and in the active-controlled period the dose will be blinded. This approach of 
blinding is endorsed since it prevents observer bias. Furthermore, if at any visit the patients LVEF is 
<50%, the treatment with mavacamten should be interrupted for 2-4 weeks. If LVEF returns to ≥50%, 
dosing resumed at one lower dose strength.
The primary endpoint was the composite of a patient’s decision to proceed with SRT or eligibility for 
SRT according to the ACCF/AHA 2011 guidelines after 16 weeks of treatment, which is considered a 
more robust (“hard”) clinical endpoint compared with pVO2max in the EXPLORER-HCM, since SRT is 
clinically relevant to patients as it is a highly invasive surgery associated with significant consequential 
risk. Secondary endpoints included changes in post-exercise LVOT gradient, NYHA FC, KCCQ-23 CSS 
and cardiac biomarkers, NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin I, to further evaluate the effect of 
mavacamten, which is considered appropriate. Additionally, exploratory endpoints included the need 
for SRT in a long-term follow-up period (Weeks 32, 56, 80, and 128), the need for SRT as determined 
by the investigator, and haemodynamic parameters (LV filling pressures, left atrium size, 
accelerometry etc).
Efficacy data and additional analyses
 Study MYK-461-005 (EXPLORER-HCM)
In the pivotal study, 251 subjects (123 subjects to mavacamten and 128 subjects to placebo) were 
randomized, and all received at least 1 dose of the study drug. The percentage of subjects who 
completed treatment was high (97.2%) and approximately similar in the mavacamten and placebo 
group (96.7% and 97.7%, respectively). A total of 67 subjects (31 subjects (25.2%) in the 
mavacamten and 36 subjects (28.1%) in the placebo group) who had their Week 38/end of study visit 
via telephone communication rather than on site due to the COVID-19 pandemic were characterized as 
having discontinued the study due to “Other”. Consequently, the percentage of subjects who 
completed the study was 71.5% and 70.3% in the mavacamten and placebo group, respectively. 
Discontinuation of study rates other than due to the COVID-19 pandemic were very low (2.4%), with 2 
subjects due to AEs, 1 due to death, 2 subject withdrawals, and 1 subject lost to follow-up. 
Thirteen subjects receiving mavacamten had dose reductions due to mavacamten plasma 
concentrations between 700 and 1000 ng/ml, including 8 subjects with dose reductions from 10 mg to 
5 mg and 5 subjects from 5 to 2.5 mg. One subject with consecutive concentration values ≥700 ng/mL 
had 2 dose reductions: from 5 mg to 2.5 mg and from 2.5 mg to placebo. These data demonstrate that 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 174/277
the starting dose of 5 mg is well tolerated considering that only 5 subjects (4.1%) are down-titrated to 
2.5 mg or placebo. 
Dose-increases were allowed at Week 8 and 14 based on plasma mavacamten and LVEF and LVOT 
assessments at Week 6 and Week 12, respectively. Results demonstrated that the majority of subjects 
(~50%) remained on the mavacamten starting dose of 5 mg throughout the 30 weeks treatment 
period. Forty subjects (32.5%) received 10 mg, and only 13 subjects (10.6%) received 15 mg at the 
end of the treatment period. These data indicate that the overall exposure to the highest dose (15 mg) 
is limited both in terms of the number of patients (n=13) and in terms of duration of exposure (week 
14 till week 30, i.e. 16 weeks). However, the data of the EXPLORER-LTE cohort showed that a 
substantial percentage of patients received and tolerated the highest 15 mg once daily dose (~15%) 
up to at least week 108. 
Important protocol deviations (IPD) were categorized depending on whether or not they were 
considered related to the COVID-19 pandemic and generally well balanced between both groups. 
This study was a multicentre study (n=68). Considering that approximately half of the subjects 
(51.0%) were from Europe, the population is sufficiently representative for Europe.
The recruited patients reflect a population of oHCM regarding demographics, comorbidities and 
guideline-directed medical therapies for oHCM, which are generally well distributed across the two 
treatments, although some exceptions are observed. The majority of subjects were male (59.4%), with 
a lower percentage of males in the mavacamten group compared with the placebo group (53.7% and 
64.8 %, respectively). Considering that subgroup analysis with respect to gender showed a consistent 
effect on the composite primary endpoint, it is anticipated that this disbalance has not affected the 
outcome of the study. The majority of subjects is white (91.2%), whereas, consequently, the non-
white population is underrepresented. However, despite variations in disease presentation, genotypic 
abnormalities and phenotypic expression of LVH are similar in white and non-white populations. 
Further, in all clinical studies, only 17/263 (6.5%) patients dosed with mavacamten were aged 75 
years or older, i.e. also this population is under-represented. Nevertheless, based on literature, 
phenotypic features of oHCM, clinical managements and recommended treatment are suggested 
similar across different age groups, and the effect of mavacamten would be similar across various age 
groups.
The mean baseline NT-proBNP was higher in the mavacamten groups compared with the placebo group 
(1516 ng/L and 1050 ng/L, respectively). Similarly, although less evident, the percentage of patients 
with NYHA class III was slightly higher in the mavacamten group than the placebo group (28.5% and 
25.8%, respectively). Additionally, a disbalance has also been observed with respect to HCM genotype. 
Several additional ad hoc analyses had been conducted to demonstrate that the imbalances in patient 
characteristics at baseline in NT-proBNP and HCM genotype did not affect the treatment benefit with 
mavacamten. Moreover, the baseline pVO2max is slightly higher in the placebo group compared with 
the mavacamten group (mean [SD] 19.9 [4.91]) vs (18.9 [4.86] mL/kg/min, respectively). 
Nevertheless, the analysis for pVO2max did include baseline values as a covariate, as specified in the 
SAP of the pivotal Phase 3 study. Furthermore, it has been shown that the coefficient of change from 
baseline at Week 30 vs baseline pVO2 is 0.12 indicating that for every 1 unit increase in baseline pVO2 
the expected improvement in pVO2 would be 0.12 lower, indicating that the treatment effect on pVO2 
improvement was more prominent that any effect of baseline pVO2. Based on above, it can be 
concluded that the disbalances in patients’ characteristics at baseline did not have a relevant impact on 
the outcome of the study. 
In line with the inclusion criteria, patients with NYHA class IV were not included, which has been 
reflected in the currently proposed indication, i.e. symptomatic oHCM (NYHA class II-III).

The proportion of subjects with each CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype was similar across the treatment 
groups. However, there were few CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PM) are included in the study (n=5 
(2.0%) with 2 subjects (1.6%) in the mavacamten group and 3 subjects (2.3%) in the placebo group). 
Therefore, CYP2C19 PM has been included as missing information in the summary of safety concerns of 
the RMP. The majority of subjects were on background HCM therapy at baseline, with 75.3% of the 
subjects using beta-blockers and 16.7% of the subjects using calcium channel blockers. Some subjects 
(n=20, 8.0%) did receive neither beta-blockers nor calcium channel blockers. 
Baseline values for echocardiography parameters were generally similar between both treatment 
groups. At baseline, enrolled subjects showed the expected characteristics of oHCM; Subjects were 
hypertrophic (mean LV maximum wall thickness 20 mm), hypercontractile (mean LVEF 74%) and 
progressively obstructed LVOT both at rest to provocation (mean resting LVOT gradients approximately 
50 mmHg and increasing to approximately 85 mmHg after exercise). Furthermore, the most common 
symptoms related to HCM within the past 12 months were shortness of breath (90.4%), followed by 
fatigue (70.1%), chest pain and palpitations (45.4% each). Fewer subjects in the mavacamten group 
compared with the placebo group had a history of atrial fibrillation (9.8% vs 18.0%) (see safety for 
further discussion). Nevertheless, the percentage of subjects with a history of non-sustained 
ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), an important complication of HCM, was slightly higher for the 
mavacamten group compared with the placebo group (17.1% vs 12.5%, respectively). The percentage 
of patients with a history of septal reduction therapy (SRT) was 7.6% (8.9% and 6.3% in the 
mavacamten and placebo group, respectively). 
Treatment with mavacamten resulted in a higher percentage of subjects achieving the composite 
primary endpoint, defined as achieving: 1. an improvement of ≥1.5 mL/kg/min in pVO2max as 
determined by CPET and a reduction of ≥1 NYHA class or 2. an improvement of ≥3.0 mL/kg/min in 
pVO2max with no worsening in NYHA class, compared with placebo (36.6% vs 17.2%, respectively; 
treatment difference: 19.4%, 95% CI: 8.67, 30.13; p=0.0005). Additionally, the percentage of 
subjects meeting both primary endpoint components (at least 3·0 mL/kg per min pVO2max increase 
and at least one NYHA class improvement) was higher for the mavacamten group compared with the 
placebo group (20.3% vs 7.8%, respectively; treatment difference: 12.5%, 95% CI: 4.02, 21.01). 
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the majority of the mavacamten group (63.4%) did not achieve 
the composite primary endpoint, i.e. non-responders. As mentioned earlier, exercise capacity in terms 
of pVO2max is acceptable as a primary efficacy endpoint; however, the composite primary endpoint, 
which is based on pVO2max and NYHA class, is difficult to interpret and not adequately justified. As 
such, the focus in order to assess the B/R was mainly on the data of the individual component 
pVO2max, which was the second sequentially tested secondary endpoint in this study (please see 
below, secondary endpoints).
Further, subgroup analyses with respect to age, gender, BMI, LVEF at baseline, NYHA class, type of 
exercise testing, NT-proBNP at baseline, and HCM genotype generally showed consistent results. 
However, a heterogeneity of effect was observed with respect to beta-blocker usage at baseline; 
Subjects who were not using beta-blocker showed a greater magnitude of the treatment effect for the 
primary composite endpoint compared with subjects who were using beta-blockers (between-group 
difference 52.6%; 95% CI: 32.9, 72.2 vs between-group difference 8.7%; 95% CI: -3.6, 21.1, 
respectively). This difference is the result of the blunting effect of beta-blockers on cardiopulmonary 
exercise testing (CPET) performance, which is reflected by the lower baseline mean peak heart rate, 
i.e. 118 beats/min vs 138 beats/min, and lower baseline mean pVO2max (19.0 ml/kg/min vs 
20.5 ml/kg/min) during exercise for subjects using beta-blockers compared with subjects not using 
beta-blockers, respectively. Moreover, the change in VE/VO2 slope, a heart rate independent 
parameter of CPET, showed similar improvements in both treatment groups, regardless of beta-blocker 
use (treatment difference of -2.9 and -2.6 for subjects using beta-blockers compared with subjects not 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 176/277
using beta-blockers, respectively). Additionally, post-hoc subgroup analyses by beta-blocker use for 
the measurement of patient symptoms (NYHA class), health status (KCCQ-23), cardiac structure (LVOT 
gradient, LVEF, LAVI, and LVMI), and cardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP and Hs-cTn1) also showed 
approximately similar improvements in both treatment groups, regardless of beta-blocker use. 
Nevertheless, the main evidence for similar efficacy in patients regardless of their beta-blocker use 
comes from the VALOR-HCM study, which used a more robust (“hard”) clinical endpoint, i.e. the 
composite of a patient decision to proceed with septal reduction therapy (SRT) or eligibility for SRT 
according to the ACCF/AHA 2011 guidelines after 16 weeks of treatment. A beta-blocker subgroup 
analysis of VALOR-HCM data showed similar improvements in SRT eligibility, regardless of beta-blocker 
use (treatment difference: 52.41% beta-blocker no vs 61.71% beta-blocker yes). Therefore, it can be 
concluded, that the totality of evidence demonstrates similar efficacy of mavacamten in oHCM patients 
regardless of their beta-blocker status.
Treatment with mavacamten resulted in significant improvements compared to placebo for all 
secondary endpoints, including post-exercise LVOT peak gradient, pVO2max, KCCQ-23 CSS, and 
HCMSQ SoB domain score. 
Peak VO2max, which was the second sequentially tested secondary endpoint in this study (after LVOT), 
is considered the most important efficacy endpoint. Mavacamten demonstrated a significant increase in 
pVO2max of 1.4 ml/kg/min compared with placebo (1.4 ml/kg/min vs -0.05 ml/kg/min, respectively; 
95% CI: 0.59, 2.12; p=0.0006). This corresponds to an absolute mean change in pVO2max of 
18.9 ml/kg/min at baseline to 20.4 ml/kg/min at week 30. In order to justify that this increase in 
pVO2max of 1.4 ml/kg/min compared to placebo is clinically relevant, the applicant referred to the 
Heart Failure and a Controlled Trial Investigating Outcome of Exercise Training (HF-ACTION) trial. The 
HF-ACTION study was a multicenter clinical trial designed to study the effects of exercise training on 
mortality and morbidity in 23331 patients with NYHA class II-IV chronic systolic HF receiving guideline-
based optimal medical therapy. The results of this trial showed that improvements in pVO2max 
correlates with improved clinical outcomes (Swank AM, 2012): every 6% increase in pVO2max (0.9 
mL/kg/min) adjusted for other significant predictors, was associated with a 5% lower risk of the 
primary endpoint (hazard ratio=0.95; CI=0.93-0.98; P<0.001) – time to all-cause mortality or all-
cause hospitalization; a 4% lower risk of the secondary end point of time to cardiovascular mortality or 
cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio=0.96; CI=0.94-0.99; P<0.001); an 8% lower risk of 
cardiovascular mortality or heart failure hospitalization (hazard ratio=0.92; CI=0.88-0.96; P<0.001); 
and a 7% lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio=0.93; CI=0.90-0.97; P<0.001). The HF-ACTION is 
suggested the largest study to address whether a change in pVO2max is related to mortality and 
morbidity in patients with chronic HF, however, the study had several limitations. First, the exercise 
intervention was not blinded to patients and site investigator due to the nature of the intervention, 
however, all cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) tests were reviewed by blinded experts from a core 
laboratory. Secondly, almost 30% of the randomized subjects were excluded from the analyses 
because they either did not have a baseline or 3-month CPX test or experienced a primary outcome 
before the 3-month test, which may could have biased the outcome. Furthermore, it remains uncertain 
whether the results of the HF-ACTION study can be directly extrapolated to the EXPLORER-HCM study 
since the population is different; The HF-ACTION trial enrolled a broader HF population, however, with 
reduced LVEF (≤ 35%), whereas the EXPLORER study included patients with obstructive HCM with 
normal LVEF (> 55%). Additionally, the subjects enrolled in the HF-ACTION study received exercise as 
intervention vs. mavacamten in EXPLORER-HCM. Exercise positively affects the body in many different 
ways, which may have contributed to the improved clinical outcome observed in the HF-ACTION trial. 
After all, the improvement in pVO2max after exercise training was relatively modest (0.6 ml/kg/min vs 
0.2 ml/kg/min for usual care alone).

Page 177/277
The most important support for the clinical relevance of the effect on pVO2max observed in the 
EXPLORER-HCM study can be derived from the ongoing VALOR-HCM study (see below).
The effect of mavacamten on exercise capacity (pVO2max) was supported by a significant reduction in 
post-exercise LVOT gradient of -35 mmHg in the mavacamten group compared to placebo (-47 mmHg 
vs -10 mmHg; 95% CI: -43.2, -28.1; p<0.0001). This corresponds to an absolute mean change in 
post-exercise LVOT gradient from 86 mmHg at baseline to 38 mmHg at week 30, which is below the 
level of consideration for septal reduction therapy (SRT) of ≥50 mmHg but still above the ≥30 mmHg 
criterion that defines obstruction in HCM patients. With respect to Valsalva LVOT gradient, an effect on 
this parameter was already observed at Week 4, decreased more gradually from Week 4 to Week 18 
and stabilized from Week 18 to Week 30. The absolute change from baseline to Week 30 was -
49 mmHg in the mavacamten group and -12 mmHg in the placebo group. Similar effects for the 
changes from baseline to Week 30 were found for resting LVOT gradient with -39 mmHg and -6 mmHg 
for the mavacamten and the placebo group, respectively. The effects returned to baseline following 8 
weeks of study drug washout, indicating that the effect on resting and Valsalva LVOT peak gradient is 
reversible. 
Relief of symptoms was further demonstrated by a higher percentage of subjects who had a ≥1 class 
improvement from baseline in NYHA class in the mavacamten group compared with the placebo group 
(65.0% mavacamten vs 31.3% placebo; treatment difference 33.8, 95% CI: 22.15, 45.43; 
p <0.0001). Only one subject worsened in NYHA class (from NYHA class II to class III). Moreover, 
mavacamten treatment compared with placebo was also associated with greater improvements in 
health status measured by KCCQ-23 CSS (mean (SD) of 13.6 (14.42) vs 4.2 (13.68), 95% CI: 5.46, 
12.66; p<0.0001) and HCMSQ SoB score (mean (SD) of -2.8 (2.68) vs -0.9 (2.41), 95% CI: -2.40, -
1.20; p<0.0001). Nevertheless, the improvements in KCCQ-23 (between-group treatment difference: 
9.1; p<0.0001) and HCMSQ SoB (between-group treatment difference: -1.8 ; p<0.0001) were both 
just below the clinically meaningful within-patient change threshold of increase of ≥10 and decrease ≥ 
2.5 points, respectively. These results question the clinical relevance of treatment with mavacamten. 
Responders using these clinically meaningful within-patient change thresholds for KCCQ-23 and 
HCMSQ SoB were 53.9% vs 33.8% (treatment difference: 20.1%) (increase ≥10 points mavacamten 
vs. placebo) and 50.0% vs. 21.3% (treatment difference: 28.7%%) (decrease ≥ 2.5 points 
mavacamten vs. placebo), respectively.
With respect to exploratory endpoints, improvement in exercise performance and cardiac output was 
further supported by improvement in peak VE/VCO2, VE/VCO2 slope, peak circulatory power, 
ventilatory power, peak MET, percent predicted VO2 and ventilatory threshold as measured by 
cardiopulmonary testing. Furthermore, consistent with the MoA of mavacamten, which causes reduced 
contractility, treatment with mavacamten resulted in a slight increase in left ventricular end-systolic 
volume index (LVESVI). Further effects of mavacamten were reductions in the percentage of subjects 
with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and mitral regurgitation, E/e’, and LAVI, 
suggesting improvements in LV filling during diastole, i.e. improved diastolic function. No differences 
were observed with respect to LV stroke volume (LVSV), heart rate, and cardiac output, which is 
reassuring since these are important indicators of cardiac function. Moreover, treatment with 
mavacamten resulted in a reduction in NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin, indicating a reduction in LV 
wall stress and myocardial injury. At week 38, following 8 weeks of study drug washout, NT-proBNP 
levels returned to baseline for the mavacamten, indicating that this effect is reversible.
LVEF was measured to ensure subject safety/tolerability. Subjects in the mavacamten group showed a 
small decrease in LVEF (-4% [7.7%]) during 30 weeks of treatment compared with the placebo group 
(-4% vs -0.01%), which is consistent with the mavacamten mechanism of action. 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023

The pivotal study included a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) substudy to assess the change from 
baseline to Week 30 in the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (primary endpoint). Treatment with 
mavacamten resulted in a favourable effect on cardiac remodelling as shown by a reduction in the LV 
mass index (mean difference -15.8 g/m2; 95% CI:-22.6, -9.0; p<0.0001), and a reduction in the 
exploratory endpoints of LV maximal wall thickness (mean difference -2.4 mm; 95% CI: -3.9, -0.9; 
p <0.0079), and in left atrial volume index over the 30-week treatment period. At the same time, 
myocardial contraction fraction and contractile fraction (stroke volume/LV mass ratio), which are load-
independent measures of LV pump reserve, were maintained, which is reassuring. 
 Study MYK-461-017 (VALOR-HCM)
In this study, 112 subjects (56 subjects to each arm) were randomized of which 111 received at least 
1 dose of the study drug. The study is still ongoing, and as of 07 February 2022, all subjects 
participating in the study completed the study through Week 16 (primary analysis timepoint). The 
percentage of subjects who completed 16 weeks of treatment (double-blind period) was high (99.1%) 
and similar between the mavacamten and placebo group (100.0% and 98.2%, respectively). 
Twelve subjects (21.4%) in the mavacamten group had a dose reduction to 2.5mg, indicating that a 
relatively high percentage could not tolerate the 5 mg dose. Nevertheless, considering that no subjects 
in the mavacamten group discontinued treatment in the double-blind period, indicates that the lower 
2.5 mg is well tolerated by these subjects. The most frequent dose received was 10 mg (33.9%) 
followed by 5 mg (23.2%) and 15 mg (21.4%). 
Important protocol deviations (IPD) were generally well balanced between both groups (25.0% and 
26.8% in the mavacamten and placebo group, respectively). Furthermore, there was minimal impact 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This study was a multicentre study (n=19) conducted in the USA. Consequently, all subjects were from 
the USA. A post-hoc analysis has been conducted (see below) which showed that consistent results in 
terms of proportion of SRT eligibility, LVOT gradients decrease, and improvements in NYHA class, 
KCCQ-23 CSS, and NT-proBNP were found between the VALOR-HCM study conducted in the USA and 
EXPLORER-HCM study conducted worldwide of which 50% of the subjects were enrolled in Europe. 
Based on these findings, it might be acceptable to extrapolate the results of the VALOR-HCM study to 
the European population. 
The recruited patients reflect a population of oHCM regarding demographics, comorbidities and 
guideline-directed medical therapies for oHCM, which are generally well distributed across the two 
treatments, although a few exceptions are observed. The mean age was 60.3 years and halve of the 
subjects were male (50.9%). At baseline, the majority of subjects had NYHA Class III (92.0%) and the 
median NT-proBNP level was 743 ng/L and the median cardiac Troponin I was 14.7 ng/L. A slightly 
higher proportion of subjects in the mavacamten group had atrial fibrillation, a known complication of 
HCM, compared with the placebo group (19.6% vs 14.5 %, respectively) (see safety for further 
discussion). Furthermore, a slightly higher proportion of subjects in the mavacamten group received 
beta-blocker agents at baseline compared with the placebo group (78.6% vs 69.1%, respectively). 
However, on the contrary, a slightly lower proportion of subjects in the mavacamten group received 
calcium channel blockers compared with the placebo group (25.0% vs 38.2%, respectively). This 
indicates that both groups received comparable intensive HCM therapy. With respect to CYP2C19 
metabolizer phenotype, the majority of subjects were rapid metabolizers (28.6%), normal 
metabolizers (27.7%) or intermediate metabolizers (22.3%). Similarly as in the EXPLORER-HCM study, 
only few poor metabolizers were included in the VALOR-HCM study (n=2 in the mavacamten group). 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 179/277
Therefore, CYP2C19 PM has been included as missing information in the summary of safety concerns of 
the RMP. 
Treatment with mavacamten resulted in a substantially lower proportion of subjects meeting the 
primary endpoint of decided to proceed with SRT or remained SRT guideline eligible (17.9% (10/56) vs 
76.8% (43/56) for placebo; treatment difference (95% CI): 58.93% (43.99, 73.87), p<0.0001). Since 
only two patients in each treatment group underwent SRT, the primary endpoint was mainly driven by 
the proportion of subjects who met guideline criteria for SRT (14.3% (8/56) vs. 69.6% (39/56). 
Additionally, 2 subjects in the placebo group vs non in the mavacamten group had a SRT status not 
evaluable. 
The question is whether the overall positive, beneficial results of the VALOR-HCM study can be 
extrapolated to the entire target population of the EXPLORER-HCM study, including the less 
compromised NYHA class II subpopulation. In this respect, the applicant has adequately justified the 
extrapolation based on 4 aspects: 1) Overlapping study populations. Despite a different distribution in 
NYHA class (NYHA class III 92% vs. 27% for VALOR-HCM and EXPLORER-HCM, respectively), the study 
population in the VALOR-HCM and EXPLORER-HCM were generally comparable including a similar level 
of obstruction at baseline (mean (SD) resting, Valsalva and post-exercise LVOT gradients of 49 (30.9), 
76 (30.2), and 84 (35.8) mmHg in the VALOR-HCM study vs 51 (31.9), 74 (32.0) and 84 (35.7) in the 
EXPLORER-HCM study, respectively), a similar percentage of subjects using beta-blockers (BB) as 
concomitant medication (75% were on BB monotherapy or combination therapy (BB with CCB and/or 
disopyramide) in the VALOR-HCM study vs 75.3% on BB monotherapy in the EXPLORER-HCM study), a 
similar duration of oHCM (5.4 vs 5.5 years median respectively) and a similar level of NT-proBNP at 
baseline (740 vs 710 ng/L median, respectively); 2) Consistent results for endpoints assessed in both 
studies. The results from secondary and exploratory endpoints were consistent across both studies, 
even though the majority of subjects in the EXPLORER-HCM study were NYHA class II (72.9% versus 
0.9% in the VALOR-HCM study). More specifically, the study populations of the VALOR-HCM and the 
EXPLORER-HCM had a comparable level of LVOT obstruction at baseline and magnitude of treatment 
effect regarding LVOT gradient decrease ( -37 vs -36 mmHg, respectively) and showed approximately 
similar improvements in NYHA class (improved ≥1: 41 vs 34 %,), KCCQ-23 CSS (9.5 vs 9.1), and NT-
proBNP (0.33 vs 0.20 GM ratio to BL). Moreover, within the EXPLORER-HCM study, consistent results 
were seen for key efficacy endpoints regardless of NYHA class, including LVOT gradient (-38.4 vs -33.0 
mmHg for Class II and Class III respectively), pVO2 (1.5 vs 1.33 mL/kg/min, respectively), NYHA class 
(improved ≥1: 34 vs 32 %, respectively), and KCCQ-CSS (10 vs 7, respectively).; 3) Consistent 
results on septal reduction therapy eligibility. A post-hoc analysis has been conducted which showed 
that, consistent with the VALOR-HCM data, in the EXPLORER-HCM of the patients who were NYHA 
Class III (n=68), a lower percentage of patients in the mavacamten group compared with the placebo 
group remained SRT eligible at week 30 (3/35 (8.6%) vs 13/33 (39.4%), respectively). Although the 
magnitude of the treatment difference is smaller than that observed in the VALOR-HCM study, the 
results are directionally consistent. Based on the data described above, it is considered acceptable to 
extrapolate the clinically relevant results of the VALOR-HCM study to oHCM patients who were NYHA 
class III in the EXPLORER-HCM study. Regarding the NYHA Class II subpopulation of the EXPLORER-
HCM study, a total of 183 subjects were NYHA Class II and were not eligible for SRT, although their 
level of LVOT obstruction ≥50 mmHg places them at risk for progression from Class II to Class III. 
Prespecified exploratory analysis in the entire EXPLORER-HCM study, of which the majority was NYHA 
Class II, showed that 74% on mavacamten vs 21% on placebo had post-exercise LVOT gradients <50 
mmHg (below SRT eligibility criteria). Additionally, results of the EXPLORER-LTE cohort of the long-
term extension (MYK-461-007) showed durable reductions in Valsalva LVOT gradient and NYHA class 
below the threshold for SRT in the majority of participants. Therefore, it is agreed with the applicant 
that these findings indicate that also for the NYHA Class II population, reducing the level of LVOT 
obstruction <50 mmHg and maintaining their NYHA class below III with mavacamten treatment is 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 180/277
important in preventing patients from progressing to SRT eligibility, which is considered clinically 
relevant; 4) Comparable safety profile. It is acknowledged that compared to the EXPLORER-HCM safety 
results, no new safety signals with mavacamten treatment were seen in the VALOR-HCM study. Based 
on the above, it is acknowledged that data from EXPLORER-HCM and VALOR-HCM demonstrate that 
mavacamten treatment results in clinically relevant improvements across the entire population of 
symptomatic NYHA Class II-III oHCM patients. 
Further subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint for VALOR-HCH with respect to age, baseline 
resting LVOT gradient, duration since oHCM diagnosis, beta-blocker use at baseline, number of 
background HCM medication and baseline NT-proBNP showed consistent results. However, 
heterogeneity of effect was observed with respect to gender (75.4% for males vs. 41.9% in females), 
BMI, (71.5% for BMI <30 vs 42.7% for BMI ≥30) and calcium channel blockers (69.3% for N vs 
38.3% for Y), but all treatment effects were considered clinically relevant. Moreover, the number of 
subjects receiving calcium channel blocker were relatively low (n=16 vs 23 in the mavacamten and 
placebo, respectively), and should therefore be interpreted with caution. 
Regarding long-term follow-up, as of the 07-February-2022 data cut, 71 subjects were randomized at 
least 32 weeks (38 subjects in the mavacamten group and 33 in the placebo group). After the Week 16 
assessments, subjects in the mavacamten group continued blinded mavacamten administration on the 
dose they were receiving at Week 16, and subjects in the placebo group began dosing with 
mavacamten 5mg. In the previous placebo group, 2 out of 33 (6.1%) subjects with Week 32 data 
proceeded to SRT, and 3 out of 33 (9.1%) subjects remain SRT eligible. These data is similar as those 
observed in the mavacamten group in the double-blind period. In the previous mavacamten group, 2 
out of 38 (5.3%) subjects have proceeded to SRT and 2 out of 38 (5.3%) are SRT guideline eligible, 
which suggest maintenance of treatment effect or even increased magnitude of effect at Week 32.
Furthermore, mavacamten treatment resulted in significant improvements compared to placebo on 
secondary endpoints of post-exercise LVOT gradient (treatment difference (95% CI): -37.2 (-48.08, -
26.24) mmHg; p<0.0001), ≥1 NYHA class improvement (treatment difference (95% CI): 41.07 
(24.48, 57.66); p<0.001), improvement in KCCQ- 23 CSS (treatment difference (95% CI) 9.45 
(4.868, 14.041) points; p<0.0001) and NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin I between groups geometric 
mean ratio, 0.33 (0.266, 0.421) and 0.53 (0.406, 0.700); both p<0.0001). Maintenance of effect after 
32 weeks of treatment has also been demonstrated for these secondary endpoints.
With respect to exploratory endpoints using transthoracic echocardiography, the effect on these 
endpoints seen after 16 weeks in the VALOR-HCM study was consistent with what was observed after 
30 weeks of treatment in less severe oHCM patients in the EXPLORER-HCM study. 
Supportive data are obtained from the ongoing long-term extension studies MAVA-LTE (Study MYK-
461-007; EXPLORER-LTE cohort) and PIONEER-OLE (Study MYK-461-008). 
The MAVA-LTE study (Study MYK-461-007) is an ongoing Phase II/III, dose-blinded, 5-years long-term 
extension (LTE) study to evaluate the safety, and tolerability of mavacamten in subjects with 
symptomatic HCM who completed the pivotal Phase 3 MYK-461-005 (EXPLORER-HCM) study through 
Week 38 (EXPLORER-LTE Cohort). After the washout period (minimal 8 weeks) of the parent study, 
subjects enrolled in this LTE started with 5 mg mavacamten. The LTE study was designed as a dose-
blinded study as it was being run in parallel to the parent study and evaluating the safety and utility of 
a clinically guided dose titration protocol. At week 4, 8, and 12 the dose could be adjusted based on 
Valsalva LVOT gradient and LVEF, and the dose could be adjusted based on post-exercise LVOT 
gradient and LVEF at Week 24. At any visit after Week 24, if the site-read LVOT gradient with Valsalva 
manoeuvre was > 30 mmHg and LVEF ≥50%, then a dose increase to a maximum of 15 mg could be 
considered after discussion with the Medical Monitor. At baseline of the LTE study, the mean LVEF 
(74%), mean resting LVOT gradient (48 mmHg) and mean Valsalva LVOT gradient (69 mmHg) were 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 181/277
approximately similar compared with the baseline of the parent study (74%, 51 mmHg, and 73 mmHg, 
respectively). As of the latest data cut-off of 31 August 2021, there were a total of 231 subjects 
enrolled, of which the majority (88.8%) had completed mavacamten treatment through at least week 
48 and 14.7% of the subjects reached week 96. The LTE study showed that mavacamten was well 
tolerated and remained stable from week 24 up to week 96, with the majority (~55%) of the patients 
on 5 or 10 mg and approximately ~15 % on the highest daily dose of 15 mg. pVO2max, which is 
considered the most relevant efficacy endpoint in support of the indication, has only been assessed in 
the parent study EXPLORER-HCM and not in this LTE study; as such, maintenance of effect on 
pVO2max has not been demonstrated. As of the cut-off date of 31 August 2021, improvements in LVOT 
gradients in the EXPLORER-LTE cohort of the MAVA-LTE study were consistent with those in the parent 
study; Mavacamten demonstrated a reduction in resting and Valsalva LVOT gradient of -35.6 mmHg 
and -45.3 mmHg from LTE baseline to Week 48. Post-exercise LVOT gradient was not assessed at 
baseline of the MAVA-LTE study; however, an exercise test was performed at Week 24. The mean 
post-exercise gradient was 42 mmHg, which is approximately comparable to the post-exercise LVOT 
gradient at Week 30 of 38 mmHg in the mavacamten group in the parent study. Improvements in 
NYHA class were approximately consistent to those observed in the parent study. Furthermore, 
consistent with the parent study, mavacamten resulted in a slight increase in LVESVI, due to reduced 
contractility and decreases in the percentage of subjects with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the 
mitral valve and mitral regurgitation and decreases in E/e’, LAVI, indicating improved diastolic 
function. Moreover, mavacamten resulted in a small favourable effect on cardiac remodelling 
(measured by TTE), as shown by small reductions in LVMI. With respect to safety, LVEF remained 
stable through 96 weeks of continuous mavacamten treatment remaining at approximately 65%, which 
is reassuring. Overall, the results demonstrated that subjects receiving mavacamten in this LTE study 
continue to experience therapeutic benefit generally consistent with that achieved in the parent with 
respect to LVOT gradient, NYHA class, and other TTE parameters. However, maintenance of effect on 
pVO2max has not been demonstrated as this has not been assessed in this LTE.
Study MYK-461-008 is an ongoing Phase II, open-label, 5-years long-term extension (LTE) study to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability of mavacamten in subjects with symptomatic HCM who completed the 
16-week PIONEER-HCM study (MYK0461-004). Individualized target doses, which were based on 
maintaining a study drug plasma concentration between approximately 250 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL 
were determined for each subject prior to the start of the study. Due to these individualized target 
doses based on mavacamten plasma levels, which were slightly lower compared to the levels achieved 
in the pivotal study, the supportive value of this study is considered limited. Overall, consistent with 
the parent study (and other clinical studies such as pivotal EXPLORER-HCM and EXPLORER-LTE cohort 
in MAVE-LTE studies), mavacamten resulted in beneficial effects as shown by reductions in resting, 
Valsalva and post-exercise LVOT gradient from baseline to Week 144, improvements in NYHA class and 
KCCQ scores. Additionally, also consistent with other clinical studies, modest mean changes in LVEF 
were observed and LVEF was maintained above 50% in all subjects throughout the observation period.
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
Mavacamten resulted in clinically relevant improvements in exercise capacity (pVO2max) and 
prevented patients from (progressing to) septal reduction therapy eligibility across the entire 
population of symptomatic NYHA Class II-III oHCM patients. These improvements were further 
supported by improvements in LVOT gradient, NYHA class, patient-reported outcomes, and cardiac 
function and structure.

2.5.8.  Clinical safety
Clinical safety data supporting the application are presented as integrated analyses of pooled safety 
data from five clinical studies with a cut-off date of 31 August 2021 (Figure 43). These studies 
include:
 One pivotal phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study (MYK-461-005) in subjects with 
oHCM.


Two phase 2 proof-of-concept studies in subjects with oHCM and nHCM (MYK-461-004 and 
MYK-461-006, respectively).
Two ongoing extension studies (MYK-461-007 and MYK-461-008) in patients previously 
enrolled in the pivotal phase 3 study and the phase 2 studies.

LTE = long-term extension; nHCM = nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; oHCM = obstructive hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy; MAVA = mavacamten; OLE = open-label extension
For the studies MYK-461-004 and -005 the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of mavacamten, 
including CV effects, was one of the secondary endpoints. For MYK-461-006, this was a primary 
endpoint. For studies MYK-461-007 and -008, evaluation of the long-term safety and tolerability, 
including CV effects, of mavacamten was the primary endpoint.
VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017)
All safety data for the ongoing VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) up to a cut-off date of 7 February 
2022 are presented. These data are presented and assessed separately in addition to the integrated 
analyses of pooled safety data from the five earlier mentioned clinical studies and include the primary 
analysis of the double-blind period (Day 1 to Week 16) in subjects treated with either mavacamten (N 
= 56) or placebo (N = 55), and data from all mavacamten exposure (N = 108) through Week 80. 
Integrated populations
The integrated populations for the analyses are designated as the following:
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 183/277
•
All-Mava (N=314): subjects in the five studies who received at least one dose of mavacamten (All-
Mava oHCM; N=260) and nHCM (All-Mava nHCM; N=54). 
•
RCT-Mava (N= 162): subjects from the two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies 
(Study MYK-461-005 and Study MYK-461-006) who were treated with mavacamten (RCT-Mava 
oHCM; N= 123) and nHCM (RCT-Mava nHCM; N= 39).
•
RCT-Placebo (N= 147): subjects from the two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies 
(Study MYK-461-005 and Study MYK-461-006) who received only placebo (RCT-Placebo oHCM; N= 
128) and nHCM (RCT-Placebo nHCM; N= 19).
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure
Duration of exposure in the integrated analyses
Due to study the design, the maximum possible length of treatment time for subjects participating in 
the pivotal Study MYK-461-005 was 30 weeks (a 30-week treatment period). In the RCT-Mava oHCM 
treatment group (i.e. mavacamten-treated subjects in the pivotal Phase 3 Study MYK-461-005), 
98.4% and 97.6% of subjects completed at least 3 and 6 months of mavacamten treatment, 
respectively, with a median duration of exposure of 7.0 months. Total exposure was 70.87 patient-
years (850.46 patient months; Table 48).

a Duration of exposure is defined as (last dose date – first dose date + 1 day) within a single study, regardless of 
intermittent discontinuations. Adjusted duration of exposure excludes the time off drug due to temporary 
interruptions. b Based on study design, the maximum planned length of treatment time for RCT-Mava oHCM and 
RCT-Placebo oHCM was approximately 7 months, and the maximum planned length of treatment time for RCT-Mava 
nHCM and RCT-Placebo nHCM was approximately 4 months. c duration of exposure includes duration of exposure 
from parent + extension studies for individual subjects and does not include the time between parent and extension 
studies.
VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) - double-blind period
All subjects completed the 16-week placebo control period except for the 2 placebo subjects who 
discontinued the study and the 4 (2 in each arm) subjects who went to SRT prior to Week 16. The 
mean (SD) duration of exposure was 17.0 (2.13) weeks for subjects who received mavacamten and 
16.5 (2.85) weeks for subjects who received placebo.
VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) - long-term follow-up
Assessment report

Overall, the mean (SD) duration of exposure was 32.59 (20.012) weeks for all the subjects (n=108) 
who received mavacamten during the DB period and LTFU. Nearly half of subjects have had 32 weeks 
of mavacamten exposure at time of this data cutoff (Table 49).
Table 49. Counts of Subjects with a Certain Duration of Mavacamten Exposure - Long-Term Follow-up.
Duration of exposure is calculated as the planned duration of exposure from start of mavacamten treatment to end 
of treatment (or data cutoff date).

collected from Day 1 until EOT for mavacamten treatment and from Week 16 until EOT for placebo to mavacamten 
treatment.
The  missing  dose  data  at  a  visit  are  due  to  (1)  early  treatment  termination;  (2)  drug  interruption;  (3)  no  bottle

(5) subjects that have not reached that visit yet.
Time interval between treatment in parent and extension studies
Subjects who completed treatment in the parent studies (mavacamten or placebo) had a 
washout/follow-up period prior to enrolling and being exposed again to study treatment in the 
extension studies (mavacamten). 
The mean time from last dose in the pivotal study MYK-461-005 for subjects in the mavacamten arm 
until the first dose in extension study MYK-461-007 was 15.7 weeks (total 115 subjects), and the 
mean time from last dose in the supporting study MYK-461-004 until the first dose in extension study 
MYK-461-008 was 53.3 weeks (total 13 subjects)(Table 53).

Duration of exposure >1 year in the same study
As only the extension studies had a duration > 1 year, these data for exposure to study drug within a 
single study are derived only from Studies MYK-461-007 and MYK-461-008. 
A total of 245 subjects (207 subjects with oHCM and 38 subjects with nHCM) qualified for a > 1-year 
duration of exposure in a single study as of the data cut-off. Of the 245 mavacamten-exposed 
subjects, 100%, 59%, and 25% of subjects completed at least 12, 18, and 24 months of mavacamten 
treatment, respectively, with a median duration of exposure of 19 months (range 12.0 to 39.8 
months)(Table 54). The median average daily dose was 5.45 mg. Total exposure in this analysis was

Impact of COVID-19 on the collection of safety data
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on safety data collection for the pivotal Phase 3 study MYK-461-
005 resulted in subjects unable to attend onsite visits for their Week 38/end of study visit. These 
subjects were allowed to complete assessment visits via telephone contact. A total of 67 subjects 
completed their Week 38/end of study visit via a telephone conversation with study site personnel to 
monitor AEs and concomitant medications and assess NYHA class, but many of the protocol-specified 
assessments were not performed. Missed assessments were included as important protocol deviation 
categories of study procedures/assessments and/or missing endpoint assessments as described in the 
CSR. This was the case for 27.1% of subjects, including 25.2% (31 of 123 subjects) in the 
mavacamten group and 28.9% (37 of 128 subjects) in the placebo group. 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the extension MYK-461-007 study resulted in dose 
interruptions or missed clinic visits. For subjects already enrolled in the MYK-461-007 study, missed 
visits that occurred during the dose titration period (ie, initial 12 weeks of the study), presented a 
potential safety issue necessitating treatment discontinuation for those who were unable to complete 
the required safety monitoring assessments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These subjects were 
discontinued from the study but were allowed to rescreen and restart the study when access to the 
clinic was possible, resulting in 2 treatment periods for these subjects: a pre-pandemic period and a 
re-enrollment period. In total, 28 subjects re-enrolled in the study and started treatment again. Among 
these, the majority (24 [10.4%] subjects) had a dose interruption due to COVID-19, and 4 subjects 
had to discontinue study treatment for other reasons (2 subjects met stopping criteria and 2 reported 
an adverse event. 
VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period
This study started screening potential subjects in June 2020 and the first subject was randomized on 
29-Jul-2020, which occurred during the global COVID-19 pandemic. There was minimal impact to the 
study conduct due to COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years.
A COVID-19 Risk Assessment Plan was implemented to identify potential risks and mitigation 
strategies. AE’s and protocol deviations pertaining to COVID-19 were assessed and reported per FDA 
issued guidance. There were two subjects that were unable to complete a study visit within window 
due to COVID-19 infection (Week 12 and Week 32). Additionally, one subject was hospitalized with 
COVID-19 and had a delay in week 16 study visit, but the visit was completed within the allowed 
window.
Virtual/remote Site Initiation Visits (SIV) and interim monitoring visits were performed in lieu of in-
person visits as needed due to country and site restrictions, as indicated in the SMP. 
Overall, COVID-19 did not impact the overall quality or outcome of the study.
One subject in the mavacamten group had acute COVID-19 infection. There were no dose interruptions 
or delays due to COVID-19.

Common Adverse Events
A summary of common adverse events is provided in Table 57 below.
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 189/277
Regardless of treatment group or indication, the majority of subjects experienced at least 1 AE (RCT-
Mava oHCM 87.8%, RCT-Placebo oHCM 81.3%; RCT-Mava nHCM 89.7%, RCT-Placebo nHCM 68.4%All-
Mava combined 92.7%).
In the All-Mava combined population AEs most frequently occurred were dizziness (19.7%), fatigue 
(15.6%), nasopharyngitis (15.0%), headache (14.6%), dyspnoea (13.4%), atrial fibrillation (12.1%), 
hypertension (11.1%) and upper respiratory tract infection (10.2%).
When evaluated by individual PT, in the oHCM indication the most frequently reported AEs in the 
pivotal Study MYK-461-005 were dizziness (21.1% in RCT-Mava oHCM vs. 13.3% in RCT-Placebo 
oHCM), dyspnoea (14.6% vs. 10.2%), headache (12.2% vs. 7.8%), and nasopharyngitis (12.2% vs. 
14.8%). 
In the nHCM indication, the most frequently reported AEs were dizziness (17.9% in RCT-Mava nHCM 
vs. 5.3% in RCT-Placebo nHCM), palpitations (15.4% vs. 15.8%), fatigue (12.8% vs. 15.8%), 
nasopharyngitis (10.3% vs. 10.5%), dyspnea (10.3% vs. 15.8%), nausea (10.3% vs. 10.5%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (10.3% vs. 0), and constipation (10.3% vs. 0).
Additionally, across the integrated analyses the Grade ≥3 AEs reported in >1 mavacamten-treated 
subject across the integrated analyses were atrial fibrillation (RCT-Mava oHCM vs. RCT-Placebo oHCM, 
All-Mava combined Grade ≥3: 2.4% vs. 3.1%, 3.2%), cardiac failure (Grade ≥3: 0.8% vs. 0, 1.3%), 
syncope (Grade ≥3: 2.4% vs. 0.8%, 1.0%), systolic dysfunction (Grade ≥3: 1.2% vs. 0, 0.6%), and 
bile duct obstruction (Grade ≥3: 0 vs. 0, 0.6%). These AEs are further discussed below.

Additional details on the characterization of selected AEs
For the adverse drug selection process, data from the 2 Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies 
(EXPLORER-HCM through Week 38 and VALOR-HCM through Week 16 double-blind period) were 
pooled. Selection criteria for ADR consideration were based on the AE occurrence ≥5% (all causality) in 
mavacamten-treated subjects and ≥2% higher than subjects who received placebo (Table 60).

Pooled data from 2 Phase 3 studies (MYK-461-005 through Week 38 and MYK-461-017 through Week 16 double-
blind period)
Frequent  TEAEs  are  those  with  ≥5%  crude  incidence  in  the  Mavacamten  arm.  Adverse  Events  were  coded  using 
MedDRA, Version 24.0.PTs and are presented in order of descending frequency in the Mavacamten arm followed by 
Placebo arm.
Further analyses of upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and arthralgia showed no reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship of the use of mavacamten and the event. They were not included as 
an ADR in the SmPC of mavacamten.
Dizziness
Integrated summary of safety analyses
In the EXPLORER-HCMl study, comparing the RCT-Mava oHCM with the RCT-Placebo oHCM treatment 
groups, dizziness as an individual term was observed in 21.1% vs. 13.3% of subjects.
Overall, in All-Mava combined, there were 62 subjects (19.7%) who experienced a total of 83 AEs of 
dizziness. Most dizziness AEs were non-serious and low grade (Grade 1 or 2), with the exception of a 
non-serious Grade 3 AE of dizziness that resolved on the same day, and a Grade 1 SAE of dizziness 
with hospital admission for neurologic and other workup but for which no aetiology was identified (the 
SAE, with onset on extension SD246 and resolution 17 days later, was considered not related by the 
investigator and no action was taken with study treatment). Of subjects who experienced dizziness, 
the majority of subjects experienced a single event (44 of 62 subjects), approximately a third of 
subjects experienced 2 dizziness events (16 of 62 subjects), and 1 subject each experienced 3 of 
dizziness and 1 subject experienced 4 events of dizziness. The mean time to the first onset of dizziness 
was 185.0 study days. The majority of dizziness events resolved (58 of 83 events, 69.9%), and the 
median duration of resolved events was 3.5 days. No dizziness events led to permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment, although for 1 subject, dizziness led to temporary interruption. 
Dizziness was the most frequent AE reported in both arms of the pivotal Study MYK-461-005. As a 
result of the greater incidence of dizziness in RCT-Mava oHCM vs. RCT-Placebo oHCM subjects, 
dizziness is considered an ADR with use of mavacamten. 
VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period
Dizziness was considered an ADR due to imbalance and consistently higher incidence proportions 
(Table 61).

Overall, confirmed by the pooled Phase 3 studies, dizziness was the most frequently reported AE (16.8 
vs 10.9 % in the pooled analysis of the 2 Phase 3 studies. Based on these data, dizziness is considered 
an adverse reaction for Section 4.8 of the SmPC.
Dyspnoea
Integrated summary of safety analyses
In the EXPLORER-HCM study, comparing the RCT-Mava oHCM with the RCT-Placebo oHCM treatment 
groups, the TEAE, dyspnoea, was observed in 14.6% vs. 10.2% of subjects. However, during the on-
treatment period, dyspnoea events were balanced between mavacamten-treated subjects and subjects 
who received placebo (RCT-Mava combined vs. RCT-Placebo combined: 12 subjects [7.4%] vs. 12 
subjects [8.2%]), while dizziness events were more frequently reported during the follow-up/washout 
period in mavacamten-treated subjects than subjects who received placebo (14 subjects vs. 4 
subjects), suggesting that the observed imbalance was attributable to dyspnoea in mavacamten-
treated subjects during the follow-up/washout period (after planned treatment completion), at a time 
when mavacamten plasma concentrations were decreasing and LVOT gradients were returning 
(increasing) back to baseline.
Overall, in All-Mava combined, there were 42 subjects (13.4%) who experienced AEs of dyspnoea. 
Most dyspnoea AEs were non-serious and low grade (Grade 1 or 2), with the exception of 1 subject in 
the extension MYK-461-007 study with a non-serious Grade 3 event considered not related to study 
treatment that resolved after 39 days without dose interruption. Of subjects who experienced 
dyspnoea, the majority of subjects experienced a single event (33 of 42 subjects, 78.6%), the 
remaining subjects experienced 2 dyspnoea events (6 of 42 subjects, 14.3%), and 3 subject 
experienced 3 events of dyspnoea. The mean time to the first onset of dyspnoea was 234.2 study 
days; approximately half of dyspnea events resolved (29 of 42 events, 53.7%) and the median 
duration of resolved events was 35.0 days. No dyspnoea events led to temporary interruption of study 
treatment. There was 1 subject for whom a Grade 2 AE of dyspnoea led to permanent discontinuation 
of study treatment; this subject received mavacamten 15 mg QD (the highest dose in the study, per 
protocol based on subject weight) in Part A of the proof-of-concept dose-ranging parent Study MYK-
461-004, and the event of dyspnoea occurred in the context of an ongoing Grade 3 SAE of atrial 
fibrillation and a concurrent Grade 2 AE of cardiac failure.
In addition to characterization based on the individual event term, other similar reported events (based 
on ‘dyspnoea’ in the coded PT) were dyspnoea exertional, nocturnal dyspnoea, and dyspnoea 
paroxysmal nocturnal. Of these similar events, all were non-serious and low-grade (Grade 1 or 2) with 
the exception of a Grade 3 AE of nocturnal dyspnoea (the AE, with onset on extension SD643, was 
considered not related by the investigator and no action was taken with study treatment). However, 
for 1 subject a Grade 2 AE of dyspnoea paroxysmal nocturnal led to permanent discontinuation of 
study treatment on extension SD100; approximately 1 week prior, this subject had interrupted 
treatment due to a Grade 2 AE of atrial flutter, and within 1 week after the subject met protocol-
specified criteria for mavacamten plasma concentration ≥1000 ng/mL and LVEF <50% and also had a 
non-serious Grade 1 AE of fall.
In summary, although in some cases dyspnoea or similar events were reported contemporaneous with 
clinical scenarios involving arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter) and cardiac failure or LVEF 
reduction, overall analyses (including review of the pattern of dyspnoea events in the pivotal study) 
support that dyspnoea primarily represents a recurrence of symptoms of underlying disease after 
planned discontinuation of mavacamten.
VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) - double blind period
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 195/277
During DB period, dyspnea was reported in 4 (7.1%) subjects in the mavacamten group and in 3 
(5.5%) subjects in the placebo group.
Overall Pooled EXPLORER-HCM + VALOR-HCM
Overall, confirmed by the pooled Phase 3 studies, dyspnea was the most frequently reported AE (12.3 
vs 8.7 % in the pooled analysis of the 2 Phase 3 studies Table 60. The applicant has accepted the 
CHMP recommendation to add dyspnea as an ADR, although there are confounding factors.
Headache
Integrated summary of safety analyses
In the EXPLORER-HCM study, comparing the RCT-Mava oHCM with the RCT-Placebo oHCM treatment 
groups, headache as an individual term was observed in 12.2% vs. 7.8% of subjects. In the 
randomized placebo-blinded studies, a relative association of headaches with beta-blocker use at 
baseline was observed (RCT-Mava combined vs. RCT-Placebo combined: headache in subjects with 
baseline beta-blocker use, 9.3% vs. 4.1%; headache in subjects without baseline beta-blocker use, 
1.9% vs. 3.4%). Headache was not a result of the ADR selection criteria based on the pooled analysis 
of EXPLORER and VALOR. 
Overall, in All-Mava combined, there were 46 subjects (14.6%) who experienced a total of 68 AEs of 
headache. All headache AEs were non-serious and low grade (Grade 1 or 2). Of subjects who 
experienced headache, the majority experienced a single event (33 of 46 subjects, 71.7%), 
approximately a quarter of subjects total experienced 2 or 3 events (8 or 4 subjects, respectively), and 
1 subject experienced ≥5 events of headache. The mean time to first onset of headache was 186.0 
study days. The majority of headache events resolved (65 of 68 events, 95.6%) and the median 
duration of resolved events was 3.0 days. No headache events led to permanent discontinuation of 
study treatment, but headache AEs led to temporary interruption of study treatment for 2 
mavacamten-treated subjects in the integrated analysis, and for 1 subject in the RCT-Placebo oHCM 
treatment group a Grade 2 AE of headache led to treatment interruption of blinded placebo.
In addition to characterization based on the individual event term, other similar reported events (based 
on ‘headache’ or ‘migraine’ in the coded PT) were cluster headache, tension headache, sinus headache, 
migraine, and migraine with aura. Of these similar AEs, all were non-serious and low-grade. Across the 
integrated analyses, migraine was reported for 3 mavacamten-treated subjects and the remaining 
similar events occurred in ≤2 mavacamten subjects each, and none of these similar events led to 
permanent discontinuation or temporary interruption of study treatment.
Considering all mavacamten-treated subjects across the integrated analyses (All-Mava combined) with 
AEs of headache or similar events, after detailed review there was no apparent pattern identified for 
time to headache onset. In addition, no apparent correlation could be identified between the events 
and proximate mavacamten plasma trough concentrations. In some cases where the most proximate 
mavacamten plasma trough concentrations at AE onset differed from that at AE resolution due to the 
duration of the headache or similar event, mavacamten plasma trough concentrations were notably 
lower at AE onset than at resolution. 
Overall, current data do not support headache as an on-treatment effect of mavacamten. Although a 
numerical imbalance of headache was observed between mavacamten-treated subjects and subjects 
who received placebo in the pivotal Study MYK-461-005, in detailed case review no pattern of onset 
was observed, and there was no apparent correlation with mavacamten plasma concentration.
VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) - double blind period
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 196/277
During the DB period, headache was reported in 2 (3.6%) and 5 (9.1%) subjects in mavacamten and 
placebo groups, respectively.
Overall Pooled EXPLORER-HCM + VALOR-HCM
The applicant was requested to discuss inclusion of ‘headache’ as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Although the imbalance was not seen in subjects without beta-blocker use, these numbers were small 
but a contributory role of mavacamten could not be completely excluded and therefore it was included 
as ADR.
However, based on evaluation of the recently available pooled analysis of Week 38 and Week 16 safety 
data of EXPLORER-HCM and VALOR-HCM. as well as results of the individual VALOR CSR, the applicant 
considers headache not to be an ADR.
In the VALOR-HCM study, headache was reported less in the mavacamten (RCT-Mava) group 
compared with placebo (RCT-placebo): 3.6% vs. 9.1%, respectively. In the pooled data-set of 
EXPLORER-HCM and VALOR-HCM, the imbalance between subjects treated with mavacamten (RCT-
Mava) compared with placebo (RCT-placebo) is narrowed to 9.5% vs. 8.2%, respectively (Adhoc Table 
1). The additional data suggest that mavacamten does not play a contributory role in causing 
headache, and that it is more likely associated with beta-blocker use in combination with mavacamten.
Syncope
Syncope as an ADR was not based on the criteria used to generate Table 60, but is included as an 
ADR based on a numerical imbalance in the EXPLORER-HCM study; however, the applicant considers 
that events of syncope are heavily confounded by other factors.
Integrated summary of safety analyses
In the EXPLORER-HCM study, comparing the RCT-Mava oHCM with the RCT-Placebo oHCM treatment 
groups, syncope as an individual term was observed in 5.7% (7 subjects) vs. 1.6% (2 subjects) for 
any grade and 2.4% (3 subjects) vs. 0.8% (1 subject) for Grade ≥3 AEs. 
Among the 7 subjects in the mavacamten arm (RCT-Mava oHCM) who experienced syncope, 4 had 
medical history of syncope or presyncope and among the 2 subjects who received placebo (RCT-
Placebo oHCM) who experienced syncope, both had medical history of syncope. Syncope, as a 
recurrent complication of oHCM is observed at times when the LVOT gradient is elevated and also 
occurs secondary to volume depletion (e.g. with use of diuretics) and with uncontrolled arrhythmias. 
Overall, in All-Mava combined, there were 9 subjects (2.9%) who experienced any grade and 3 
subjects (1.0%) who experienced Grade ≥3 AEs of syncope. Seven subjects in the RCT-Mava oHCM 
treatment group were discussed in the paragraph above, and the 2 additional subjects (with oHCM) 
experienced syncope AEs during long-term extension. Of the 9 mavacamten-treated subjects with 
syncope across the integrated analyses, 3 subjects experienced Grade 3 SAEs of syncope (all in the 
parent pivotal study), and the remaining 6 subjects experienced non-serious and low grade (Grade 1 
or 2) AEs of syncope. Brief summaries of the 3 mavacamten-treated subjects with SAEs are provided 
below; for all 3 subjects, resting and Valsalva LVOT gradients were trending higher at the time of the 
SAEs based on proximate values before and after the events.
•
1 subject who had 2 reported Grade 3 SAEs of syncope, both attributed to metoprolol and 
underlying oHCM, that led to temporary interruption and permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment; proximate mavacamten plasma concentrations were <200 ng/mL 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 197/277
•
1 subject with a medical history of seizure, syncope, and collapse, who had a Grade 3 SAE of 
syncope attributed to underlying worsening oHCM and hypovolemia in the setting of a recent 
hike; proximate mavacamten plasma trough concentration was 32.4 ng/mL
•
1 subject with a medical history of syncope neurally mediated and with ongoing atrial 
fibrillation, who had a Grade 3 SAE of syncope 25 days after planned treatment completion 
according to study design; proximate mavacamten plasma trough concentrations were <450 
ng/mL
Of the 4 mavacamten-treated subjects with non-serious and low-grade (Grade 1 or 2) AEs of syncope 
in the pivotal study, 2 occurred on-treatment (both subjects had proximate mavacamten plasma 
trough concentrations <200 ng/mL) and 2 occurred during the follow-up/washout period either 23 
days or 40 days after planned treatment completion, a time when not only mavacamten plasma 
concentrations were decreasing, but also LVOT gradients were returning (increasing) back to baseline. 
Both subjects had end-of-treatment mavacamten plasma trough concentrations <400 ng/mL and end-
of-study mavacamten plasma trough concentrations <40 ng/mL). 
The 1 subject with syncope during long-term extension experienced 2 non-serious Grade 2 AEs of 
syncope (2 days apart from each other) that each resolved on the same day as onset with no action 
taken with study treatment. This subject had initiated a new concomitant mediation of bisoprolol 
approximately 3 weeks prior to the first syncope AE, and approximately 1 week after the second 
syncope AE met protocol-specified criteria for mavacamten concentration ≥1000 ng/mL at the same 
time bisoprolol was discontinued (reported vital signs were stable).
VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) - double blind period
During the DB period, 1 subject (1.8%) in the mavacamten group and 0 subjects in placebo group 
experienced syncope.
Atrial fibrillation
Integrated summary of safety analyses
In EXPLORER-HCM (MYK-461-005), subject incidence of any grade events in the atrial fibrillation ECI 
category were generally similar, and of Grade ≥3 events were numerically lower, for the RCT-Mava 
oHCM treatment group than for the RCT-Placebo oHCM treatment group (any grade, 8.1% vs. 7.8%; 
Grade ≥3, 2.4% vs. 3.1%).
In the pooled analysis of the 2 Phase 3 studies AF was observed 8.4% for mavacamten and 5.5% in 
placebo. However, AF is not considered an ADR for the label as it is the most common arrhythmia 
encountered in HCM patients. It is well recognized that the prevalence of AF in HCM patients is 
approximately 20%
VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) - double blind period
In this study, AF is not considered an ADR as it is the most common arrhythmia encountered in HCM 
patients and could arise under various circumstances unrelated to mavacamten treatment. It is well 
recognized that the prevalence of AF in HCM patients is approximately 20%18. Holter analyses at 16 
weeks detected only 1 subject with AF in mavacamten treatment group and 2 subjects with AF in 
placebo group (see Section 2.7.4.7), although these episodes in the placebo group were not specifically 
reported as AEs. Overall, in the DB phase of VALOR study, there were 4 subjects with reported AF (see 
section 2.7.4.5), among which 3 subjects had a medical history of AF, and 2 subjects had medical 
history of coronary artery disease. 2 of the 4 subjects with AF had serious events of AF. One of these 2 
subjects was reported with 2 events of AF and had a history of atrial perforation caused by atrial lead 6

months prior to screening. Additionally, in mavacamten-treated subjects, AF was not associated with a 
pattern of onset and not correlated with a pattern related to proximate mavacamten concentration.
Overall Pooled EXPLORER-HCM + VALOR-HCM
In the pooled analysis of the 2 Phase 3 studies AF was observed 8.4% for mavacamten and 5.5% in 
placebo. However, AF is not considered an ADR as it is the most common arrhythmia encountered in 
HCM patients. It is well recognized that the prevalence of AF in HCM patients is approximately 20%.

2.5.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
Deaths
In the mavacamten integrated analyses, three deaths occurred in any subject while on study (3/314, 
1.0%), which all were considered not related to study drug by the investigator. 
One death occurred in a mavacamten-treated subject in Study MYK-461-007 (the subject had been 
treated with placebo in the parent study MYK-461-005). The death was reported as a fatal (Grade 5) 
SAE of endocarditis bacterial. Two additional subjects had a fatal AE (cardiac arrest, and acute 
myocardial infarction) in Study MYK-461-007. 
One death occurred in a subject in the placebo arm of the randomized pivotal Study MYK-461-005. The 
death was reported as a fatal (Grade 5) SAE of sudden death and was considered causally related to 
study treatment by the treatment-blinded investigator.
In addition to deaths in the integrated analyses discussed above, there was also 1 death of a 
mavacamten-treated subject in the clinical pharmacology hepatic impairment Study MYK-461-015. The 
subject was in the moderate hepatic impairment group and had a medical history of headaches, 
hypertension, hepatic enzymes increased due to alcohol abuse, hepatosplenomegaly, and ascites. A 
fatal SAE of ischemic stroke occurred 40 days after a single dose of mavacamten. For this subject, 
mavacamten plasma concentration 35 days after dosing (5 days prior to the SAE) was 0.332 ng/mL.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period 
No subjects in the mavacamten group or placebo group had died in the double-blind period.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) - long-term follow-up
One subject, who previously received placebo treatment until Week 16 and then received mavacamten 
treatment post Week 16, had a TEAE of sudden cardiac death at week 56.

In the RCT-Mava oHCM treatment group, SAEs were most frequently reported in the SOCs of cardiac 
disorders (4.1% [5 subjects] in RCT-Mava oHCM vs. 3.9% [5 subjects] in RCT-Placebo oHCM), nervous 
system disorders (3.3% [4 subjects] vs. 1.6% [2 subjects]), infections and infestations (2.4% [3 
subjects] vs. 1.6% [2 subjects]), and injury, poisoning and procedural complications (1.6% [2 
subjects] vs. 0). There were no other SOCs for which > 1 subject in the RCT-Mava oHCM group 
experienced an SAE. 
The most frequently reported SAEs by individual PT in the RCT-Mava oHCM treatment group were atrial 
fibrillation (2.4% [3 subjects] in RCT-Mava oHCM vs. 3.9% [5 subjects] in RCT Placebo oHCM), 
syncope (2.4% [3 subjects] vs. 0.8% [1 subject]), and stress cardiomyopathy (1.6% [2 subjects] vs. 
0). No other SAEs in the RCT-Mava oHCM group were experienced by > 1 subject. 
The most frequently reported SAE by individual PT in the RCT-Mava nHCM treatment group was atrial 
fibrillation (5.1% [2 subjects] in RCT-Mava nHCM vs. 5.3% [1 subject] in RCT Placebo nHCM). No other 
SAEs in the RCT-Mava nHCM group were experienced by > 1 subject.
Atrial fibrillation was the most frequently reported SAE across all mavacamten-treated subjects in the 
integrated analyses, although as noted earlier in this section, it occurred more frequently in subjects 
who received placebo than in mavacamten-treated subjects in the pivotal study (RCT-Mava oHCM vs. 
RCT-Placebo oHCM, All-Mava combined SAEs: 2.4% vs. 3.9%, 4.5%). Atrial fibrillation is one of the 
most frequent events in subjects with oHCM; in the HCM population, the lifetime risk of atrial 
fibrillation is estimated to be 20%, with prevalence as high as 40% with age > 70 years. Other SAEs 
reported in > 1 subject in All-Mava combined were cardiac failure (1.6% [5 subjects]), syncope (1.0% 
[3 subjects]), stress cardiomyopathy (0.6% [2 subjects]), pneumonia (0.6% [2 subjects]), and systolic 
dysfunction (0.6% [2 subjects]).
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period
The overall proportions of subjects with on-Treatment SAEs were higher in the mavacamten group 
through week 16 than in placebo group (Table 63). Two subjects on mavacamten versus none of the 
subjects on placebo experienced cardiac disorders attributed to atrial fibrillation. One subject in the 
mavacamten group had acute COVID-19 infection. One subject in the placebo group had acute alcohol 
intoxication. No subjects experienced SAEs of congestive cardiac failure, syncope, or sudden cardiac 
death.
Study drug related serious on-treatment AEs, corresponding to cardiac disorders (atrial fibrillation), 
were observed only in one subject in the mavacamten treatment group.

Adverse events of special interest
LVEF ≤30%
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 202/277
 
The AESI of LVEF ≤ 30% was defined based on site-read echocardiograms. No subjects in the RCT-
Mava or RCT-Placebo populations for any indication (oHCM or nHCM) experienced an AESI of LVEF 
≤30%. 
No subject with oHCM across all mavacamten-treated subjects in the integrated analyses (All-Mava 
combined) experienced an AESI of LVEF ≤30%. There was one subject (0.3%) with nHCM in the 
integrated analyses (All-Mava combined) who experienced an AESI of LVEF ≤30% during the chronic 
treatment phase (extension SD330 of Study MYK-461-007). The LVEF reduction was reversible and the 
subject symptomatically improved after discontinuation of study treatment as described below.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double blind period
No subjects experienced LVEF ≤ 30% based on echo measurements during scheduled site visits.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) - long-term follow-up
Two (1.9%) subjects experienced LVEF ≤30% based on echo measurements during scheduled site 
visits.
Symptomatic Overdose
Symptomatic overdose was defined as any overdose reported on the specific AESI eCRF as associated 
with one or more AEs.
No subjects in the RCT-Mava or RCT-Placebo populations for any indication (oHCM or nHCM) 
experienced an AESI of symptomatic overdose.
There were 3 subjects (1.0%; 1 with oHCM and 2 with nHCM) across all mavacamten-treated subjects 
in the integrated analyses (All-Mava combined) who experienced an AESI of symptomatic overdose; all 
3 occurred during participation in the long-term extension Study MYK-461-007. 
Of the 3 subjects, the 1 subject with oHCM had an elevated mavacamten value that met protocol-
specified criteria for mavacamten plasma trough concentration ≥1000 ng/mL after multiple data entry 
errors at the site that affected dose titration decisions; the reported associated symptom was a SAE of 
cardiac failure for which the subject interrupted and later permanently discontinued treatment (the 
SAE of cardiac failure occurred during a hospitalization for pneumonia complicated by anaphylactic 
shock after the second dose of azithromycin). 
Of the 2 subjects with nHCM, 1 subject had mavacamten plasma trough concentration of 772 ng/mL 
and the reported associated symptom was a non-serious Grade 1 AE of lethargy; of note, this subject 
subsequently (>1 month later) had an elevated mavacamten value that met protocol-specified criteria 
for mavacamten plasma trough concentration ≥1000 ng/mL and interrupted and then permanently 
discontinued treatment due to AEs of atrial flutter and dyspnoea paroxysmal nocturnal (this subject 
also subsequently met protocol-specified criteria for LVEF <50% and had a Grade 1 AE of fall). The 
remaining 1 subject (with nHCM) had proximate mavacamten plasma trough concentration values 
<400 ng/mL and had two reported associated symptoms of anxiety and bradycardia (both non-serious 
Grade 1 AEs).
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double blind period
No subject had any on-treatment AEs of symptomatic overdose.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) - long-term follow-up
No subject had any TEAEs of symptomatic overdose within the LTFU
Embryofoetal toxicity
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 203/277
Identification of embryofoetal toxicity as a mavacamten AESI was based on findings from the definitive 
nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies. 
There are no clinical safety data for embryofoetal toxicity with mavacamten, as no pregnancies have 
been reported for female subjects or female partners of male subjects treated with mavacamten. As of 
this submission, 1 pregnancy has been reported in the mavacamten clinical program, occurring in a 
female partner of a male subject who received placebo.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double blind period
No pregnancies were reported.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) - long-term follow-up
No pregnancies were reported.
Events by Medical Concept
Analyses evaluated data for protocol-specified criteria, events adjudicated by the independent CEAC, 
and AE data in events of clinical interest (ECI) categories. Where relevant, analyses of other data (e.g. 
laboratory data, cardiac diagnostics data, vital signs data) are also presented.
A summary of the overall subject incidence of mavacamten ECIs by categories is provided in Table 65.

VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period
The most common AECIs were:
 Mavacamten treatment group: atrial fibrillation (5 [8.9%] subjects), dizziness (4 [7.1%] 
subjects), nausea (4 [7.1%] subjects), and rash (4 [7.1%] subjects)

Placebo group: ventricular tachycardia (5 [9.1%] subjects), and dizziness (3 [5.5%] subjects
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) - long-term follow-up
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 205/277
The most common AECIs were dizziness (9 [8.3%] subjects), atrial fibrillation (7 [6.5%] subjects), 
ejection fraction decreased (5 [4.6%] subjects), constipation (5 [4.6%] subjects), nausea (5 [4.6%] 
subjects), dermatitis contact (4 [3.7%] subjects), rash (4 [3.7%] subjects), dizziness postural (3 
[2.8%] subjects) and falls (3 [2.8%] subjects).
LVEF reduction.
LVEF reduction in the RCTs
No subjects in either the RCT-Mava oHCM or RCT-Placebo oHCM treatment groups met protocol-
specified permanent discontinuation criteria for site-read LVEF ≤30%, but 7 vs 2 subjects met 
protocol-specified criteria for temporary discontinuation of study treatment due to LVEF while on study 
treatment (median LVEF 48%, range 35-49%). 
•
For 4 of the 7 subjects in RCT-Mava oHCM, the LVEF value <50% was measured at the Week 
30 end of treatment visit 
•
The remaining 3 of the 7 subjects in RCT-Mava oHCM and 2 subjects in RCT-Placebo oHCM 
underwent temporary discontinuation of blinded study treatment and subsequently resumed 
dosing (for 1 of the 3 mavacamten-treated subjects, the LVEF reduction occurred in the setting 
of stress cardiomyopathy). 
•
There was 1 additional subject in the RCT-Mava oHCM group, who also met protocol-specified 
criteria of LVEF <50% on SD146 during an episode of stress cardiomyopathy, but this subject 
had already temporarily discontinued blinded mavacamten dosing on SD137 due to meeting 
protocol-specified criteria for QTcF prolongation.
In the RCT-Mava oHCM treatment group, all LVEF reductions meeting protocol-specified criteria for 
temporary discontinuation were reversible based on subsequent LVEF values (including 1 subject with 
partial recovery to LVEF 50% and no subsequent study-related echocardiography available due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
LVEF reduction in all mavacamten exposed patients
In total, across the integrated analyses (All Mava oHCM and nHCM), there were 36 unique 
mavacamten-treated subjects (19 with oHCM and 17 with nHCM) who met protocol-specified criteria 
for LVEF reduction (Table 66). In addition, there were 2 subjects who received placebo who had LVEF 
reduction below protocol-specified safety thresholds; both were subjects with oHCM from the pivotal 
MYK-461-005 study.
Of the 19 subjects with oHCM and qualifying LVEF reductions, 2 oHCM subjects had qualifying LVEF 
reductions in both parent and extension studies. In addition, for 2 subjects, LVEF reduction occurred 
after study treatment had already been temporarily discontinued, in both cases due to meeting 
protocol-specified criteria for QTcF. Based on quantitative LVEF data for the lowest qualifying LVEF 
values for each unique individual subject, the median qualifying LVEF reduction for all 19 subjects with 
oHCM was LVEF 44.67% (range 34.8% to 49.3%), and the median qualifying LVEF reduction for 16 
subjects with nHCM was LVEF 44.25% (range 20.0% to 49.3%); the qualifiying LVEF value for the 
remaining 1 subject (with nHCM) was based on qualitative assessment (no available quantitative 
value) and was not used for these summary statistics.
Based on review of concurrent AEs or SAEs, 9 of the 19 subjects with and 10 of the 17 subjects with 
nHCM had no symptoms associated with the LVEF reductions.
LVEF reduction and mavacamten plasma concentrations
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 206/277
Elevations in mavacamten plasma concentration did not consistently precede or coincide with changes 
in LVEF. Of the 19 subjects with oHCM and qualifying LVEF reductions, 2 subjects had mavacamten 
plasma trough concentration ≥1000 ng/mL, 7 subjects had mavacamten plasma trough concentrations 
between 700 and 1000 ng/mL, and the remaining 10 subjects had mavacamten plasma trough 
concentrations that were <700 ng/mL at the time of or most proximately prior to the LVEF 
measurement. Similar findings were seen for the nHCM group.
From the opposite perspective, there were a total of 9 subjects (5 with oHCM and 4 with nHCM) across 
the integrated analyses who met protocol-specified criteria for mavacamten plasma concentrations 
≥1000 ng/mL. Of the 5 subjects with oHCM, 3 subjects had associated LVEF reduction <50% 
(including 2 subjects in long-term extension with LVEF values <50% on central-read or in-hospital 
echocardiograms that did not meet cohort definitions for protocol-specified criteria based on site-read 
LVEF values) and 2 subjects did not (both subjects had site-read LVEF 55% [corresponding to central-
read LVEF 60.7% or central-read LVEF 58.3%] concurrent with mavacamten plasma trough 
concentration ≥1000 [1330 ng/mL or 1060 ng/mL, respectively]). For subjects with nHCM, dosing was 
designed to achieve pre-specified mavacamten plasma trough concentration targets, and there was 
stronger evidence of a causal association for LVEF reduction with mavacamten levels beyond the 
recommended therapeutic range. Of the 4 subjects with nHCM, 3 subjects had associated LVEF 
reductions meeting protocol-specified thresholds, and 1 subject did not (1 subject who had LVEF 
59.8% measured concurrent with mavacamten plasma trough concentration 1030 ng/mL on SD120).

VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) – double- blind period
Two (3.6%) subjects the mavacamten treatment group and no subjects in the placebo treatment 
group met the protocol defined temporary discontinuation criterion of LVEF <50%. Both subjects were 
asymptomatic at the time of the reduced LVEF <50% and were able to resume mavacamten within a 
few weeks at one dose lower than the dose they were receiving at the time of their temporary 
discontinuations. Both subjects remain in the LTE period of the study.
VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) - long-term follow-up
Two subjects in the mavacamten treatment group and no subjects in the previous placebo treatment 
group met the temporary discontinuation criterion of LVEF <50%. Both subjects were asymptomatic 
and able to resume mavacamten at the next lower dose. No subjects in the placebo to mavacamten 
treatment group met the criterion.

In the pivotal Phase 3 study MYK-461-005 and the supporting LTE study MYK-461-007, a prespecified 
set of safety endpoints, including MACE, defined as the composite of adjudicated CV death, stroke, 
acute myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure; hereafter referred to as MACE-
adjudicated, were prospectively adjudicated by the CEAC. 
The adjudicated data from mavacamten studies MYK-461-005 and MYK-461-007 are summarized in

During the treatment period of the pivotal study MYK-461-005, a total of 3 subjects (3 of 123, 2.4%) 
in the mavacamten group and 3 subjects (3 of 128, 2.3%) in the placebo group experienced 
adjudicated MACE events. Of the 3 subjects in the mavacamten group, 1 subject experienced a Grade 
3 SAE of syncope (adjudicated as Type II non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]), and for 2

subjects experienced a Grade 2 or Grade 3 SAEs of stress cardiomyopathy (adjudicated as Type II 
NSTEMI and heart failure hospitalization [1 subject] and as Type II NSTEMI [1 subject]). Of the 3 
subjects in the placebo group 1 subject experienced a Grade 5 fatal event of sudden death that was 
adjudicated as CV death, and 2 subjects experienced Grade 3 SAEs of atrial fibrillation (adjudicated as 
Type II NSTEMI [1 subject] and heart failure hospitalization [1 subject]). In addition, 2 mavacamten-
treated subjects (both with pre-existing atrial fibrillation) experienced adjudicated MACE events during 
clinical scenarios with multiple confounding factors in the washout/follow-up period. For 1 subject the 
clinical scenario involved cardiac tamponade and an iatrogenic atrial septal defect after an ablation 
procedure to treat atrial fibrillation with multiple reported SAEs (adjudicated MACE events were heart 
failure hospitalization and stroke), and for 1 subject the clinical scenario involved a diagnosis of SLE 
with pericarditis and pericardial effusion (adjudicated as heart failure hospitalization). 
The incidence rate of total adjudicated MACE for oHCM patients in the pivotal study MYK 461 005 
(including the washout/follow-up period) was 5.75 per 100 patient years for the mavacamten group 
and 3.27 per 100 patient years for the placebo group. When considering the longer exposure time of 
the LTE study MYK-461-007, the incidence rate of adjudicated MACE for the pivotal study together with 
the LTE study was 2.47 per 100 patient years for subjects with oHCM. Thus, the incidence rate of 
adjudicated MACE in oHCM patients did not increase with longer exposure time and is comparable to 
the incidence rate of subjects who received placebo in the Study MYK-461-005. 
In the LTE study MYK-461-007, there were 8 (3.5%) subjects who had adjudicated MACE events (all 
were subjects with oHCM) at the time of the interim data cut-off date (31-Aug-2021): 5 (2.2%) 
subjects with hospitalization for heart failure; for 2 of these 5 subjects, the events occurred in the 
context of data entry errors at the site involving dose-blinded investigator clinicians that resulted in 
inappropriately high mavacamten doses (higher doses than the subjects would have received if dose-
titration had been based on correct values). The remaining 3 subjects with a MACE adjudicated event 
in LTE had fatal outcomes (1 subject reported an SAE of bacterial endocarditis that was adjudicated as 
a CV death, 1 subject experienced the SAE of cardiac arrest, and 1 subject died unexpectedly at home 
due to myocardial infarction). As of the data cut-off, exposure adjusted incidence rates for adjudicated 
MACE in the LTE study MYK-461-007 were lower than for mavacamten-treated subjects in the parent 
pivotal study.
Analyses for MACE by Standardised MedDRA Query (MACE-SMQ) were also conducted with MedDRA-
coded AE data, defined based on the narrow SMQ “myocardial infarction,” the SMQ “haemorrhagic 
central nervous system vascular conditions,” the SMQ “ischemic central nervous system vascular 
conditions,” PT “cardiac death,” PT “sudden cardiac death,” and PT “sudden death.” Analyses of MACE-
SMQ were generally balanced between the treatment groups in the pivotal study (mavacamten vs. 
placebo: all grades, 1.6% vs. 2.3%; Grade 3, 0.8% vs. 0.8%), and review of data across the 
integrated analyses did not reveal additional findings of concern. The absence of additional significant 
events of MACE-SMQ in data from the LTE studies also supports CV safety of mavacamten 
administered over an extended period of time.
As described earlier in this section, a total of 2 subjects in the Study MYK-461-005 (and across the 
integrated analyses) had adjudicated MACE events of stress cardiomyopathy. Literature reviews of 
stress cardiomyopathy in patients with HCM suggest that unique predisposing factors in these patients 
include dynamic obstruction due to outflow tract septal thickening, abnormalities of the mitral valve 
apparatus (papillary muscle abnormalities, mitral leaflet elongation, systolic anterior motion), and 
genetically determined inefficient energy utilization that can predispose to apical ballooning in the 
absence of specific triggers of catecholamine excess (Sherrid et al. 2020). In addition, publications 
describing the presentation of stress cardiomyopathy in subjects with HCM estimate the incidence from 
a retrospective review of data to be approximately 0.9% (Sherrid et al. 2020; Sherrid et al. 2019; 
Medina de Chazal et al. 2018). Considering all mavacamten-treated subjects across the integrated 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 211/277
analyses (All-Mava combined), stress cardiomyopathy was observed in 0.6% of subjects (0.60 cases 
per 100 patient years). Additionally, in published data from an international consortium with data from 
1750 patients with Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy, 89.8% were women, mean age was 66.8years, 
55.8% occurred in patients with neurologic or psychiatric disorders, and mean LVEF during the stress 
cardiomyopathy episode was 40.7mmHg which was markedly lower than the mean LVEF of age- and 
sex-matched patients with an acute coronary syndrome (Templin et al. 2015). Patient profiles for the 2 
subjects with stress cardiomyopathy in the mavacamten integrated analyses were consistent with 
these published data for patients with stress cardiomyopathy; in the mavacamten clinical studies, both 
subjects who experienced stress cardiomyopathy were women, age > 65 years, with anxiety and 
emotional stress reported for 1 subject, and both subjects experienced marked reductions in LVEF 
during the acute episodes that subsequently recovered.
In summary, current data do not suggest an overall safety concern for MACE events (adjudicated or 
SMQ-based) with mavacamten, and these data also provide support for CV safety of mavacamten over 
an extended period of time. 
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double blind period
No subject had any treatment-emergent MACE (MACE; comprised of acute MI, stroke, CV death, and 
heart failure hospitalization).
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) - long-term follow-up
MACEs were reported in 2 (1.9%) subjects during LTFU for total mavacamten treatment. Both MACE 
events occurred in the previous placebo group (Table 68). One (0.9%) subject was reported with 
MACE related to sudden cardiac death after permanently discontinued due to LVEF <30%. Additionally, 
1 (0.9%) subject was reported with MACE related to heart failure hospitalization and LVEF <30% 
around Week 30.
Table 68. Incidence of Major Adverse Cardiac Events - Long Term Follow-up.
Heart failure and systolic dysfunction
Heart failure is a complication of HCM, and in a small percentage of subjects, the refractory nature of 
this complication of the underlying disease can lead to heart transplantation (Marstrand et al. 2020). 
The aetiology of heart failure for individual subjects in the mavacamten clinical program was often 
multifactorial, complex, and confounded by the underlying disease and atrial fibrillation or other 
factors. When heart failure occurred in the setting of normal or hyperdynamic LV systolic function after 
the end of treatment with mavacamten or in subjects who were not exposed to mavacamten, a drug-
causal association with mavacamten was not supported by data (although a contributory role for 
mavacamten could not be ruled out in all cases).
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 212/277
Notably, in the randomized, placebo-blinded Study MYK-461-005, heart failure as adjudicated by the 
independent CEAC was balanced during the treatment period (up to Week 30) between subjects who 
received mavacamten or placebo (1 subject each). In addition, as assessed by summarized AE data in 
the narrow SMQ of cardiac failure, heart failure was balanced between the treatment groups in the 
pivotal study MYK-461-005 (mavacamten vs. placebo: any grade, 2.4% vs. 3.9%; Grade ≥3, 0.8% vs. 
0.8%) (Table 69). The only serious heart failure events observed in mavacamten-treated subjects in 
the pivotal study occurred after the planned end of treatment according to study design; these events 
occurred in 2 mavacamten-treated subjects during the washout/follow-up/ period, at a time when 
mavacamten plasma concentrations were decreasing and LVOT gradients were returning (increasing) 
to baseline values. In addition, of the 4 mavacamten-treated subjects with serious events of heart 
failure (1.3% of All-Mava combined), events for 2 subjects occurred in the context of inappropriately 
high mavacamten doses that resulted from data entry errors at the site involving dose-blinded 
investigator clinicians. The limitations of dose blinding and the need to enter clinical data into a system 
to trigger dosing decisions are unique to the randomized double-blinded clinical trial setting; thus, 
similar data entry errors leading to inappropriately high mavacamten doses are not expected to occur 
with non-blinded physicians in the post-approval clinical setting. Overall, across the integrated studies, 
approximately half of subjects who met protocol-specified criteria for LVEF reduction had no symptoms 
associated with the LVEF reductions.
Exposure-response analysis demonstrates that on a population level, a relationship exists between 
mavacamten concentrations and LVEF; however, on a subject level, there is significant interindividual 
PK variability that does not allow concentrations to accurately predict LVEF. This variability can be 
overcome through direct measure by echocardiogram.

Therefore, considering the mechanism of action for mavacamten heart failure due to systolic 
dysfunction is proposed to be an important potential risk for mavacamten. This important potential risk 
can be mitigated through baseline and periodic monitoring of LVEF through echocardiograms, 
education of prescribers on the clinical context in which these events occurred in the mavacamten 
clinical program, and education of patients on signs and symptoms that may represent these events.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period
In the VALOR-HCM DB period, no subjects experienced HF. Two (3.6%) subjects in the mavacamten 
group experienced an event of asymptomatic LVEF decrease and were able to resume study drug after

30%. (
Table 70. Incidence of Heart Failure and Decreased LVEF – VALOR-HCM study - Double-Blind Period.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – long-term follow-up
In the LTFU period, 6 (5.6%) subjects had at least one on-treatment HF and decreased LVEF events. 
One previous mavacamten subject (0.9%) was reported with cardiac failure after SRT procedure (3 
week after stopping mavacamten treatment), and 1 previous placebo subject (0.9%) had congestive 
cardiac failure. Investigations with decreased EF were reported in 5 (4.6%) subjects (Table 71). Three 
subjects (previous mavacamten) had temporary treatment discontinuation due to LVEF <50% and 
subsequently resumed treatment at a lower dose. Two subjects (previous placebo) had permanent 
treatment discontinuation due to LVEF ≤ 30% while on mavacamten treatment. 1 of whom is the 
subject described above with event of congestive heart failure
One additional previous mavacamten subject had a temporary treatment discontinuation due to 
ejection fraction decreased but was not considered as an AE by the investigator.

Arrhythmias.
In the HCM population, cumulative morbidity is dominated by atrial fibrillation and heart failure, with 
the prevalence of atrial fibrillation being ~1 in 5 patients in a large referral HCM population. In 
addition, ventricular arrhythmias significantly contribute to the morbidity and mortality burden in the 
HCM population, with risks of ventricular arrhythmia 23.5 times and cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac 
death 6.3 times higher in patients with HCM than in the non-HCM population.

Due to the clinical importance of these events for the population under study, mavacamten safety data 
were analysed for the medical concepts of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias as ECI 
categories; analyses of cardiac rhythm monitoring data are also provided, followed by an overall 
discussion and summary.

In the randomized placebo-blinded studies, there was no imbalance of events to suggest an on-
treatment effect of mavacamten for atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, findings 
across the integrated analyses were consistent with the randomized data, including that all ventricular 
arrhythmia events in mavacamten-treated subjects were non-serious and low grade. In other analyses 
across the integrated dataset, no mavacamten-treated subject had significant other arrhythmias, 
including torsades de pointes or sudden death. 
Overall, analyses of AE data and review of relevant cardiac rhythm monitoring data do not support 
arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias) as an on-treatment effect of mavacamten. 
These data support the likelihood that there is no detrimental effect on CV outcomes (including 
arrhythmias) with prolonged exposure to mavacamten.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period
Total number of on-treatment AEs of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter reported were 6 in the 
mavacamten treatment group and none in the placebo group (Table 73). Atrial fibrillation or atrial 
flutter were observed in 4 (7.1%) subjects in the mavacamten group, out of which 3 (5.4%) subjects 
had recurrent Atrial fibrillation with known Atrial fibrillation medical history.

randomized placebo-blinded studies were generally similar between treatment groups. Although 
incidence for Grade ≥3 events were numerically higher for mavacamten-treated subjects than in 
subjects who received placebo, these were due to Grade 3 SAEs of syncope (and not presyncope, for 
which there were no Grade ≥3 events). 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 218/277
When using a broad definition for syncope/presyncope, a numerical imbalance was observed between 
treatment groups in data from the randomized placebo-blinded studies. However, the majority of the 
increased incidence (from narrow to broad definitions) and the imbalance between treatment groups 
could be attributed to non-serious and low grade events of dizziness. Dizziness and syncope are 
considered ADRs for mavacamten. 
QTc prolongation.
In the RCT studies, there were no mavacamten-treated subjects with AEs of electrocardiogram QT 
prolonged. There was 1 subject in the RCT-Placebo oHCM treatment group of the Study MYK-461-005 
with 2 reported AEs of electrocardiogram QT prolonged; both events were considered by the 
investigator as related to study treatment. Both events were non-serious Grade 1 AEs that led to 
temporary interruption of blinded placebo.
Across the integrated analyses, there was 2 mavacamten-treated subjects in the MYK-461-007 study 
each with a Grade 1 AE of electrocardiogram QT prolonged; for one subject the AE led to temporary 
dose interruption and the subject resumed treatment. The second subject was permanently 
discontinued from treatment having met protocol-specific criteria for QT prolongation. 
In the RCT-Mava oHCM compared with the RCT Placebo oHCM treatment group, 3 vs. 3 subjects met 
protocol-specified criteria for QTcF prolongation while on study treatment. All 6 subjects underwent 
temporary discontinuation of study treatment and subsequently resumed dosing, most at a lower dose 
according to protocol-specified guidance. Of the 3 subjects in the RCT-Mava oHCM treatment group, 1 
subject met criteria based on an earlier protocol version and would not have qualified as meeting QTcF 
prolongation criteria under the protocol version that was in effect at the completion of the study, and 1 
subject met criteria due to a baseline QTcF value that was subsequently re-adjudicated. For the 
remaining 1 mavacamten-treated subject, approximately 1 week into the temporary discontinuation 
period (while off treatment) the subject also met protocol-specified criteria for LVEF <50% in the 
clinical context of a Grade 3 SAE of stress cardiomyopathy.
In the RCT-Mava nHCM and RCT-Placebo treatment groups, no subjects met protocol-specified criteria 
due to QTcF prolongation while on study treatment. However, 1 subject in the mavacamten-treated 
group had QTcF of 500 ms that met the protocol-specified safety threshold (<500 ms) for the study 
after treatment had already been discontinued. One week prior to the QTcF value, this subject had 
permanently discontinued study treatment due to heart failure related to systolic dysfunction (also 
reported as a Grade 3 SAE of systolic dysfunction leading to permanent treatment discontinuation); 
the same subject also had an AE of atrial fibrillation reported as leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation, and also (on the same day as the QTcF value) met the protocol-specified criterion of 
LVEF ≤45%.
Considering all mavacamten-exposed subjects across the integrated analyses (All-Mava combined), in 
addition to the randomized placebo-blinded studies discussed above there were 11 subjects (8 with 
oHCM and 3 with nHCM) who met protocol-specified temporary discontinuation thresholds for QTcF 
prolongation criteria during long-term extension. Ten of these subjects (8 with oHCM and 2 with nHCM) 
were on treatment at the time of the qualifying QTcF value(s) and were eligible for actions with study 
treatment (ie, for treatment interruption and dose reduction). 
Of the 8 subjects with oHCM, 2 subjects subsequently permanently discontinued study treatment due 
to stopping criteria met; all mavacamten plasma trough concentrations for these 2 subjects were <55 
ng/mL in the extension study. The 6 remaining subjects with oHCM all had a temporary treatment 
interruption of which 5 resumed mavacamten at a lower dose and 1 subject in long-term extension had 
not resumed treatment as of the data cutoff. Two of the 3 subjects with nHCM met protocol-specified 
criteria while on treatment. One of the subjects had no action taken based on investigator clinical 
Assessment report

Page 219/277
judgment and another subject permanently discontinued treatment due to prolonged QTcF and the 
study as the subject was on the lowest dose of the study drug.
Relatively few mavacamten-treated subjects in the integrated analyses met protocol-specified criteria 
for QTcF prolongation; in total there were 4 subjects identified, all of whom were subjects with oHCM, 
including 3 subjects from the pivotal study (balanced in the pivotal study with 3 subjects who received 
placebo also meeting protocol-specified criteria for QTcF prolongation; MYK-461-005 CSR Section 
10.2.2). None of the 4 mavacamten-treated subjects who met protocol-specified criteria for QTcF 
prolongation had associated mavacamten plasma trough concentrations above 700 ng/mL, and 1 of 
the 4 subjects had associated.

Figure 44. MYK-461-005: Mavacamten Trough Concentration Versus Change from Baseline in QTcF 
(Safety Population).
Dose- and concentration-dependent modest QTc prolongation has been observed after prolonged 
administration of supratherapeutic doses in healthy (non-HCM) hearts (nonclinical healthy animal and 
clinical pharmacology healthy participants). In contrast, data do not support QTc prolongation in 
subjects with the underlying cardiac pathophysiology of HCM.
Clinical investigations of mavacamten in subjects with HCM, with regression analyses performed on 
centrally-read ECG data, revealed a very modest but consistent negative correlation between 
mavacamten plasma concentrations and change from baseline in QTcF (slope of the concentration-
effect in the pivotal Phase 3 study: 0.0180).
Across the integrated analyses, there were no mavacamten-treated subjects with reported AEs coding 
to the MedDRA PT of electrocardiogram QT prolonged. Regarding potential clinical events relevant to 
QTc prolongation (including torsade de pointes, ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, seizures, or sudden 
death), or in analyses of mean and categorical QTcF intervals from ECGs, the data do not suggest a 
safety concern for mavacamten. Additionally, relatively few mavacamten-treated subjects in the 
integrated analyses met protocol-specified criteria for QTc prolongation (with numbers of subjects 
balanced in the pivotal study between the treatment arms); no clear relationship between these 
subjects and mavacamten plasma concentration was identified.
In summary, the QTc observations in healthy hearts exposed to mavacamten were not reproduced in 
analyses of subjects with HCM.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period 
In prior mavacamten studies subjects were required to have baseline QTcF <500 ms for enrollment. 
This was not an exclusion criterion in the VALOR-HCM study. Additionally, in prior mavacamten studies 
prolonged QTcF was used as a temporary discontinuation criterion. This was not a temporary 
discontinuation criterion in the VALOR-HCM study.
At baseline QTcF interval > 450 ms was similar between mavacamten and placebo groups, whereas 
QTcF interval > 500 ms was observed in 2 (3.6%) subjects of the mavacamten treatment group only 
(Table 78). One of the subjects was on disopyramide, which is known to prolong QTcF. During the 
study this subject’s QTcF was <500 ms. The other subject had a baseline QTcF of 524 ms and 
maximum of 530 ms during the RCT period. Neither subject had left bundle branch block. Neither of 
the subjects had an ICD or a pacemaker.
For the overall safety population, a smaller proportion of subjects in the mavacamten group compared 
with the placebo group had a post baseline QTcF interval > 450 ms (51.8% vs 61.8%). Maximum 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 222/277
change from baseline > 60 ms was observed only in mavacamten treatment group in 3.6% of the 
subjects.
Twenty-two subjects were on disopyramide as part of their HCM SOC medication. 14 of the 22 subjects 
were in the mavacamten arm. The range of QTcF at baseline for mavacamten subjects on 
disopyramide was 426 ms – 514 ms. The maximum QTcF during the double-blind period for 
mavacamten subjects on disopyramide ranged from 439 ms to 509 ms. The range of QTcF at baseline 
for placebo subjects on disopyramide was 427 ms- 514 ms. The maximum QTcF during the double-
blind period for placebo subjects on disopyramide ranged from 444 ms – 517ms. There is no safety 
concern of DDI of mavacamten and disopyramide regarding prolongation of QTcF.
Two subjects in the mavacamten arm with maximum post-baseline increase in QTcF >60 ms were the 
same 2 subjects having maximum increase >15% from baseline. One patient was paced and had 
baseline QTcF 423 ms; Week 4 QTcF 487 ms and Week 16 QTcF 477 ms. The other patient had history 
of atrial fibrillation with baseline QTcF 390 ms and Week 16 QTcF 452 ms following cardioversion for 
AF. 
Table 78. Summary of QTcF Intervals – VALOR-HCM study Double Blind Period
Overall, a QTcF regression analysis was performed on all 56 subjects (53 were on SOC HCM 
medications) who were administered mavacamten, and showed a negative slope, thereby showing no 
concentration effect of mavacamten on QTcF (Table 79).

Considering all mavacamten-exposed subjects with any indication (All-Mava combined), 1.9% (6 
subjects) were reported with renal events. In addition to the 1 subject reported in the RCT-Mava oHCM 
study, 3 subjects in the long-term extension study MYK-461-007 reported renal events of acute kidney 
injury; 1 was non-serious Grade 2 that was resolving as of the data cut for the study.  The other 2 
subjects with acute kidney injury and reported these events as Grade 3 and SAEs. One subject with an 
SAE of acute kidney injury was associated with a cytomegalovirus infection and the other subject with 
an SAE of acute kidney injury was associated with elevated creatinine levels (1.7 mg/dl). The 1 subject 
who reported an event of renal failure had a Grade 1 event that was nonserious and resolving as of the 
data-cut for this study.
Based on current review of AE data and relevant laboratory data, nephrotoxicity is not associated with 
mavacamten use. Evidence supports the safe use of mavacamten in patients with a range of renal 
functions ranging from normal to moderate (eGFRs ≥30 ml/min/1.73m2) renal insufficiency.
Hepatic Events.
Overall, hepatic ECIs were primarily non-serious and low-grade in the mavacamten clinical studies. 
Event incidences for mavacamten-treated oHCM subjects were comparable to incidence for subjects 
who received placebo in the randomized placebo-blinded studies with 3.3% vs. 3.1%, respectively (4 
subjects each). In the RCT-Mava nHCM treatment group, there was 1 subject (2.6%) with events in 
the hepatic ECI category and none in the placebo group. The overall incidence rate was similar as in 
the all-Mava combined population, 3.5% (11 subjects) experienced any grade hepatic events. The 
infrequent events of transaminase elevations were either represented baseline disease (e.g. hepatic 
steatosis) or were clearly secondary to other alternative aetiologies, such as AST increased in the 
context of a diagnosis of a Klatskin’s type cholangiocarcinoma or liver injury secondary to cardiogenic 
shock. 
Across the integrated analyses, the subject incidence for abnormal elevations of liver laboratory tests 
was overall low. In the randomized placebo-blinded studies, no subjects had AST or ALT > 3x ULN or 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > 1.5x ULN elevations during the studies, and the proportions of subjects 
who had TBL > 1.5x ULN during the studies were balanced between mavacamten-treated subjects and 
subjects who received placebo (3 subjects each in RCT-Mava combined and RCT- Placebo combined). 
In the RCT-Mava oHCM treatment group, 1 subject with a medical history of hereditary spherocytosis 
and jaundice had a baseline TBL of 9.02 mg/dL on SD1 and post-baseline TBL values ranging up to 
10.76 mg/dL during the study.
Considering all mavacamten-exposed subjects with any indication (All-Mava combined), <2% of 
subjects had TBL > 2x ULN, and <1% of subjects had AST or ALT > 3x ULN or ALP > 1.5x ULN. A 
detailed review of liver laboratory test data for these subjects revealed that most subjects meeting the 
indicated thresholds for abnormal elevations of post-baseline liver laboratory tests also had abnormal 
elevations at baseline (screening or SD1).

EMA/311929/2023 
Page 224/277
Based on the current review of hepatic AE data and relevant laboratory data, hepatotoxicity is not 
associated with mavacamten use.
2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings
Haematology
Summarized data are provided for the following core clinical haematology laboratory evaluations: 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC), haemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC) counts (leukocytes), and 
platelets. They are presented in Table 81 below:
Table 81. Haematology parameters
Hemoglobin (g/dL)
Leukocytes ((10^9)/L)
Neutrophils ((10^9)/L)
Platelets ((10^9)/L)
There were no clinically important mean changes in haematology parameters from baseline to the 
most extreme post-baseline values. The proportions of subjects with shifts of haematology parameters 
in the high or low directions from baseline to post-baseline values were generally similar between RCT-
Mava combined, and RCT-Placebo combined treatment groups (representing mavacamten-treated 
subjects and subjects who received placebo in the randomized placebo-blinded studies).
Analyses of haematology parameters by indication (oHCM or nHCM) were consistent with analyses of 
haematology parameters in the integrated data summaries. Overall, there were no clinically important 
haematology safety findings for mavacamten.

VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period 
In both groups, all hematology laboratory mean values were within reference ranges at baseline, and 
were stable through Week 16. Individually, most subjects had normal hematology laboratory 
parameters at baseline and Week 16. Coagulation laboratory mean values were within normal ranges 
and were stable from baseline through Week 16.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – long-term follow-up 
Overall, for each treatment group, hematology laboratory and coagulation laboratory values were

Clinical Chemistry
Summarized data are provided for the following core clinical chemistry laboratory evaluations: ALT, 
albumin, ALP, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), calcium, creatine kinase (CK), creatinine, creatinine clearance, 
glucose, magnesium, potassium, and sodium.

Overall, there were no clinically important mean changes in general chemistry laboratory tests from 
baseline to the most extreme post-baseline values. While some shift differences were observed, further 
interpretation was limited. For observed shifts in glucose values, pre-procedure fasting for cardiac 
assessments that were scheduled at the same visits may have resulted in application of fasting normal 
ranges to glucose values collected at those visits. For observed shifts in calcium and potassium, 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 227/277
interpretation was limited due to overall small numbers of subjects with abnormal values; in addition, 
differences in use of concomitant diuretics may have been a contributing factor. For observed shifts in 
magnesium as well as some observed shifts in potassium, data from subjects in the randomized 
placebo-blinded studies appeared to favour mavacamten-treated subjects over subjects who received 
placebo, suggesting that the observed shifts were spurious and not clinically meaningful. 
In summary, after a detailed review of general chemistry parameters, no safety concerns for 
mavacamten were identified.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period 
In both groups, all chemistry laboratory mean values except indirect bilirubin (only measured in <5% 
of subjects) were within reference ranges or at a desirable (cholesterol, glucose, GFR) or expected 
(FSH for post-menopausal woman) level at baseline and were stable through Week 16. Individually, 
most subjects had normal chemistry laboratory parameters.
Liver toxicity was assessed by elevations in ALT, AST, ALP, and TBL. Across treatment groups, no 
subjects met any category of ALT > 3 × ULN, AST > 3 × ULN, or ALP > 1.5 × ULN. Review of liver 
enzyme tests indicated that no subjects met the criteria for DILI assessed by concurrent ALT or AST > 
3 × ULN and bilirubin > 2 × ULN, where transaminase elevation coincided with or preceded TBL 
elevation (ie, possible Hy’s Law cases).
Figure 45 is a graphic representation of peak ALT values versus peak TBL values during the treatment-
emergent period (Day 1 to Week 16) by treatment group for the safety population. Subjects with TBL 
> 2 × ULN are identified on the graph.

Across treatment groups, no subjects met any category of ALT > 3 × ULN, AST > 3 × ULN, or ALP > 
1.5 × ULN. Review of liver enzyme tests indicated that no subjects met the criteria for DILI assessed 
by concurrent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and bilirubin > 2× ULN, where transaminase elevation coincided 
with or preceded TBL elevation (ie, possible Hy’s Law cases).
No notable or persistent urinalysis abnormalities were reported.
Cardiac Laboratory Tests
In the mavacamten clinical studies, NT-proBNP was a cardiac biomarker for myocardial wall stress and 
cTnI was a cardiac biomarker for myocardial injury.
In the randomized placebo-blinded studies (pivotal Study MYK-461-005 and supporting Study MYK-
461-006), analyses were performed of changes from baseline in NT-proBNP and cTnI for subjects 
treated with blinded mavacamten compared with subjects who received blinded placebo. The results of 
these analyses supported a dose-dependent relationship between mavacamten treatment and 
reduction in NT-proBNP and decreases of cTnI. The pattern of changes in NT-proBNP observed in the 
extension Study MYK-461-007 with long-term use of mavacamten was consistent with those observed 
in the parent studies. Overall, these findings were consistent with a potential benefit and not a safety 
concern for mavacamten. 
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – double-blind period 
Mean ECG measurements (heart rate, PR, QRS, and QTcF) were within normal ranges from baseline 
through Week 16, with no notable changes observed in either group.
In subjects with cardiac monitoring data at Week 16, AF was reported in 1 (1.8%) and 2 (3.6%) 
subjects in the mavacamten and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Maximum heart rate at Week 
16 was 120.4 (± 21.95) vs 112.8 (± 19.36) beats / min in mavacamten vs placebo treatment groups, 
respectively. At least one NSVT episode at baseline was observed in 10 (17.9%) and 15 (27.3%) 
subjects vs at Week 16, 5 (8.9%) and 11 (20.0%) subjects in mavacamten and placebo treatment 
groups, respectively (Table 14.3.6). Ventricular tachycardia was reported only in 0 subjects in 
mavacamten group and 5 (9.1%) subjects in placebo group.
No notable changes from baseline in vital signs or physical findings were observed in either group.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – long-term follow-up 
ECG parameters (heart rate, PR, QRS, and QTcF) were stable from baseline through Week 68, with no 
notable changes observed.
Holter monitoring was done after 16 weeks of mavacamten exposure in 44 previous mavacamten 
subjects and 28 previous placebo subjects. After 32 weeks of mavacamten exposure Holter monitoring 
was done in 30 subjects in the previous mavacamten arm and zero (0) subjects in the previous 
placebo arm.
In subjects with cardiac monitoring data, at 16 weeks of mavacamten exposure, AF was reported in 4 
(3.7%) subjects, out of which 1 (1.8%) and.3 (5.8%) subjects were previously treated with 
mavacamten and placebo, respectively. No subjects were reported with AF at 32 Weeks of 
mavacamten exposure. Maximum heart rate after 16 weeks of mavacamten exposure was 120.5 (± 
20.46) beats/min (120.1 +/- 21.8 in previous mavacamten arm and 121.2 +/- 18.5 in previous 
placebo arm). After 32 weeks of mavacamten exposure, maximum heart rate was 114.8 (± 16.03). At 
least one NSVT episode was observed in 9 (8.3%) subjects at 16 weeks of mavacamten exposure (5 in 
previous mavacamten arm and 4 in previous placebo arm), and in 8 (7.4%) subjects at 32 weeks of 
mavacamten exposure (all in previous mavacamten).

Integrated safety analyses of the effect of age for subjects treated with mavacamten did not reveal a 
safety concern for mavacamten use in older subjects with age >65 years. Although limited due to 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 230/277
small numbers, safety analyses for subjects >75 years of age also did not reveal safety concerns. A 
bimodal age distribution was noted for atrial fibrillation which may relate to the bimodal distribution of 
HCM where younger patients with the familial genetic-based disease are more likely to exhibit more 
severe disease with more adverse outcomes and marked cardiac hypertrophy, and older patients with 
sporadic disease are increasingly being recognized as incidental diagnoses of HCM.

Effect of Race
Across the All-Mava combined population, 286/314 (91.0%) white subjects, 16/314 (5.1%) subjects of 
non-white (other) races, and 12/314 (3.8%) subjects of unknown race were dosed with mavacamten. 
By race categories, 92.3% of white subjects and 93.8% of non-white subjects experienced any AE.
Overall, no safety concerns were identified in analyses of mavacamten-treated subjects across the 
integrated analyses stratified by race subgroups. Analyses were generally limited by small numbers of 
non-white subjects.
Effect of renal function
A summary of AEs occurring in ≥10% of subjects in any renal function category (defined as normal or 
mildly impaired with CrCl ≥60 mL/min, or reduced with CrCl 30 to <60 mL/min), is provided in Table 
85 below. 
Across the All-Mava combined population, 289/310 (93.2%) subjects with normal or mildly impaired 
renal function and 21/310 (6.7%) subjects with reduced renal function were dosed with mavacamten. 
By renal function category, 92.7% of subjects with normal or mildly impaired and 90.5% of subjects 
with reduced renal function experienced any AE.
In summary, integrated safety analyses of the effect of renal function for subjects treated with 
mavacamten did not reveal a safety concern for mavacamten use in subjects with reduced renal 
functions. The higher incidence of atrial fibrillation in mavacamten-treated subjects with reduced renal 
function than in subjects with normal or mildly impaired renal function is likely consistent with baseline 
demographics of the renal function subgroups, as the vast majority (90.5%) of subjects with reduced 
renal function were older subjects with age ≥65 years.

CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers
Subjects with CYP2C19 PM genotype in the integrated analyses:
In the integrated populations, there were 6 subjects (all with oHCM) with PM genotype for CYP2C19, 
consisting of 5 subjects in the pivotal Study MYK-461-005 (2 subjects randomized to treatment with 
mavacamten, and 3 subjects randomized to treatment with placebo), and 1 subject in the supporting 
Study MYK-461-004. In total, 5 of these 6 subjects were dosed with mavacamten. Given the per-
protocol individual dosing regimens by clinical response, mavacamten plasma trough concentrations 
over the treatment periods were not expected to be different for these subjects than for other subjects 
in the studies.
Of the 3 mavacamten-treated subjects with PM genotype for CYP2C19 who received mavacamten 
during participation in a parent study, all 3 subjects completed treatment in parent studies according 
to study design. There were 2 subjects who enrolled to supporting extension studies; for 1 subject no 
AEs have been reported (parent or extension study) and for 1 subject only non-serious low grade 
(Grade 1 or 2) AEs have been reported (parent or extension study) that have not led to actions taken 
with study treatment. Neither subject had on-study measurements of LVEF <50% or QTcF > 500 ms, 
and none of the 3 subjects had any mavacamten plasma trough concentration values of ≥1000 ng/mL. 
The remaining 1 subject with PM genotype for CYP2C19 did have LVEF <50% concurrent with 
treatment completion in the parent (pivotal) study, and subsequently (during the follow-up period) 
experienced a complex clinical scenario involving iatrogenic atrial septal defect and cardiogenic shock 
as complications of an ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation (all SAEs experienced by this subject 
recovered or resolved, and none were considered to be related to mavacamten); this subject did not 
participate in long-term extension. 
Of the 2 subjects with PM genotype for CYP2C19 who received placebo during participation in a parent 
study but were dosed with mavacamten during participation in long-term extension, neither subject 
has had AEs reported or measurements of LVEF <50%, QTcF >500 msec, or mavacamten plasma 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 232/277
concentration ≥1000 ng/mL after exposure to mavacamten (1 subject had 4 non-serious Grade 1-2 
AEs reported and a measured QTcF value > 500 msec during the parent study).
While limited, the experience in these PM subjects who completed treatment in Study MYK-461-005 
and/or were dosed with mavacamten in Study MYK-461-007 supports that individualized dose titration 
(individualized dosing) and drug monitoring designed to balance the PD effects of LVOT reduction while 
maintaining LVEF, without genotypic testing or plasma concentration measurements, can optimize 
mavacamten use.
VALOR-HCM study
In VALOR-HCM study, 2 of the 56 subjects that received mavacamten treatment and none in the 
placebo treatment group were identified as poor CYP2C19 metabolizer genotype. None of these 
subjects had LVEF <50%. Since there was a small number of poor metabolizers, the interpretability of 
potential differences is limited.

Effect of Geographic Region
A summary of AEs occurring in ≥10% of subjects by region (US, ex-US) is provided in Table 86 
below. Across the All-Mava combined population, 176/314 (56.0%) subjects in the US and 138/314 
(43.9%) subjects in ex-US regions were dosed with mavacamten. By geographic region, 84.7% of US 
subjects and 78.4% of ex-US subjects experienced any AE.

Effect of Baseline Beta-Blocker Use in Subjects with oHCM
A summary of AEs occurring in >5% of subjects by baseline beta-blocker use (yes or no) is provided in 
Table 87 below. Across the All-Mava oHCM population, 192/260 (73.8%) subjects with (yes) baseline 
beta-blocker use and 68/260(26.2%) subjects without (no) baseline beta-blocker use were dosed with 
mavacamten. Overall, similar proportions of subject with (92.7%) and without (91.2%) baseline beta-
blocker use experienced any AE.
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 233/277
By baseline beta-blocker use, there were no AEs of any grade reported by ≤5 percentage points more 
in subjects with baseline beta-blocker use than subjects without baseline beta-blocker use. 
There were no Grade ≥3 AEs reported by ≥2 percentage points more than the other for either baseline 
beta-blocker use subgroup. 
There were no SAEs reported by ≤2 percentage points more for subjects with baseline beta-blocker 
use than subjects without baseline beta-blocker use.
Overall, no safety concerns were identified for mavacamten-treated subjects with baseline beta-blocker 
use. Some analyses were limited due to small numbers of events. There were no meaningful 
differences in severe or serious events (Grade ≥3 AEs or SAEs, respectively) for subjects stratified by 
baseline beta-blocker use, and numerically lower proportions of subjects with (compared against 
subjects without) baseline beta-blocker use experienced AEs leading to actions with study treatment 
(permanent discontinuation or temporary interruption), events in the ECI category of cardiac failure, or 
had any post-baseline central-read LVEF <50%.

Baseline disopyramide use in subjects with HCM (VALOR-HCM)
There were no major differences in the nature of TEAEs reported between subjects with and without 
disopyramide use at baseline. Due to a very small sample size of subjects with disopyramide use in the 
mavacamten treatment group and placebo to mavacamten treatment group, the interpretability of 
potential differences is limited.
Use in pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
Due to teratogenicity observed in 2 animal species (rats, rabbits), women of childbearing potential 
should be advised to use highly effective contraception (i.e. failure rate of <1% per year) during 
treatment with mavacamten and for 4 months (5 half-lives in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers) following 
discontinuation.
In non-clinical definitive reproductive toxicity studies, mavacamten maternal exposure was found to 
cause developmental abnormalities at exposure levels that were less than the maximum recommended 
human exposures. In rats, there were mavacamten-related increases in post-implantation loss, 
decreased mean fetal body weight, and fetal malformations (visceral and skeletal) in the highest (1.5 
mg/kg/day) dose group. Malformations consisted of total situs inversus (thoracic and abdominal) in 1 
fetus and absence of the right atrioventricular valve associated with a ventricular septum defect in a 
second fetus. Skeletal malformations consisted mainly of higher incidences of fused sternebrae. 
Maternal toxicity was not noted in pregnant rats at doses associated with developmental defects. In 
rabbits, maternal toxicity was noted at doses ≥1.2 mg/kg/day, in which developmental defects 
consisting of cleft palate, great vessels malformations (dilatation of pulmonary trunk and/or aortic 
arch), and fused sternebrae were noted. See Section 1.1.4 and refer to Module 2.6.6 Section 7 for 
additional detail.
The risk of embryofetal toxicity due to paternal exposure in the semen was assessed based on 
preclinical data, actual semen concentrations in healthy men volunteers (MYK-461-003 CSR synopsis), 
and the potential for these concentration levels to cause maternal systemic exposures that could be 
teratogenic. Based upon measurements of mavacamten in the semen of 4 male subjects who received 
18.5 mg of mavacamten for 28 days, it was concluded that the risk of teratogenic effects was caused 
by mavacamten transferred by semen or other body fluids is negligible.
There are no clinical safety data for pregnancy with exposure to mavacamten. No pregnancies have 
occurred in female subjects treated with mavacamten. One pregnancy reported in a female partner of 
a male subject randomized to the placebo arm in the pivotal Study MYK-461-005 resulted in delivery 
by c-section of a normal male baby; as the male subject was not treated with mavacamten, safety 
data for this partner pregnancy are non-informative with regard to mavacamten.
Lactation
It is not known whether mavacamten or mavacamten metabolites are excreted in human breast milk. 
Because of the unknown adverse effects of mavacamten in breastfed newborns/infants, a decision 
must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding during treatment and for 4 months after the last 
dose or to discontinue treatment, taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the 
benefit of treatment for the woman.
Fertility
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 235/277
There are no clinical safety data on the effect of mavacamten on human fertility.
In nonclinical definitive reproductive toxicity studies, mavacamten was not shown to affect fertility in 
male or female rats, nor did it affect transgenerational reproductive capabilities of F1 offspring when 
F0 females were dosed while pregnant and lactating. See Section 1.1.4 for a summary of additional 
nonclinical findings and refer to Module 2.6.6 Section 7 for detailed information.
Overdose and medication errors
Overdose based on reported AEs
There was 1 subject (with oHCM) with a non-serious Grade 1 AE of an accidental overdose in the long-
term extension Study MYK-461-007. The subject inadvertently took more than 1 dose of study 
medication within a 12 hour period and was also included in the subject counts of overdose based on 
pill counts; no additional AEs were reported in association with the accidental overdose.
Overdose based on returned pill counts reported on specific eCRFs
Collection of data for pill-count-based overdose events was based on retrospective recollection during 
study visits when a pill count was performed. In the randomized placebo-blinded studies (RCT-Mava 
combined and RCT-Placebo combined), there were 20 (12.3%) mavacamten-treated subjects and 29 
(19.7%) subjects who received placebo with reported overdose based on returned pill counts. No AEs 
were reported in association with any of these returned pill counts that were categorized as overdose 
events.
Considering all mavacamten-exposed subjects with any indication (All-Mava combined), there were 45 
subjects with reported overdose based on data for returned pill counts, of which 3 subjects (1 with 
oHCM and 2 with nHCM) were considered symptomatic based on association with 1 or more AEs. One 
subject with oHCM had an associated SAE of cardiac failure (during hospitalization for pneumonia 
complicated by anaphylactic shock after the second dose of azithromycin) and also met protocol-
specified criteria for mavacamten plasma trough concentration ≥1000 ng/. The SAE led to permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment but resolved after 8 days, and LVEF reduction was reversible after 
mavacamten discontinuation. The 2 subjects with nHCM had associated non-serious Grade 1 AEs of 
lethargy.
Medication Errors
In mavacamten clinical studies across the integrated analyses, there was 1 AE reported that 
represented an event of medication errors. This was the non-serious Grade 1 AE of accidental overdose 
that occurred in Study MYK-461-007.
Drug Abuse
Mavacamten is not anticipated to have the potential for drug abuse or dependence based on the 
pharmacologic mechanism of action. There are no data in the mavacamten clinical program to support 
purposeful drug abuse as a safety concern for mavacamten.
Withdrawal and Rebound
Overall, approximately a third of subjects in mavacamten parent studies experienced AEs in the follow-
up period after planned treatment completion. In the randomized placebo-blinded studies, dyspnea, 
dizziness, contusion, and syncope occurred more frequently after treatment completion of blinded 
mavacamten than completion of blinded placebo. Based on individual case review, 1 contusion AE that 
occurred during the follow-up period after treatment completion (in a subject with nHCM) was related 
to a fall.
Effects on ability to drive or operate machinery or impairment of mental ability
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 236/277
No specific studies on the effects of mavacamten on the ability to drive or operate machinery have 
been performed. Based on its pharmacological properties, mavacamten is expected to have no or 
negligible direct influence on the central nervous system.
In the review of AEs and SAEs, from the narrow MedDRA SMQ for accidents and injuries, 1 
mavacamten-treated subject across the integrated studies had a Grade 1 SAE of contusion associated 
with a car accident; the event occurred during participation in the pivotal Study MYK-461-005. 
Overall, mavacamten may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Dizziness 
may occur following administration of mavacamten. Patients should be advised not to drive or use 
machines, if they experience dizziness during treatment.

Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 237/277
In the RCT-Mava oHCM treatment group, 2 subjects (1.6%) permanently discontinued mavacamten 
due to a Grade 3 AE of atrial fibrillation (1 subject) and a Grade 3 SAE of syncope (1 subject). 
Permanent discontinuation of study treatment due to AE was not reported for any subject in the RCT-
Placebo oHCM treatment group, but death was reported as the primary reason for treatment 
discontinuation for one subject. 
Considering all mavacamten-exposed subjects with any indication (All-Mava combined), 17 subjects 
(5.4%) permanently discontinued study treatment due to AEs. For some subjects, multiple AEs were 
reported as leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment (1 subject for whom SAEs leading 
to permanent discontinuation included atrial fibrillation and systolic dysfunction, and 1 subject for 
whom AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study treatment included cardiac failure, dyspnea, 
and peripheral edema, all of which were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug). 
These 17 subjects were from the following studies: 2 subjects from the pivotal Study MYK-461-005, 1 
subject from parent Study MYK-461-004, 3 subjects from parent Study MYK-461-006, 10 subjects 
from extension Study MYK-461-007, and 1 subject from extension Study MYK-461-008
Overall, in the proposed indication of oHCM, a low proportion of subjects in the pivotal Phase 3 study 
(1.6%, 2 subjects) permanently discontinued mavacamten due to AEs. As compared with the pivotal 
study in oHCM, permanent discontinuation of study treatment due to AEs occurred more frequently in 
the supporting parent study in nHCM, but this may have been due to differences in study design 
(dosing was not based on PD responses but rather to achieve protocol-defined mavacamten plasma 
concentration targets) and the AEs primarily represented decreases in LVEF or systolic dysfunction that 
upon follow-up were reversible. All 4 subjects with nHCM across the integrated analyses (including the 
3 subjects in RCT-Mava nHCM) contemporaneously met protocol-specified criteria for LVEF reduction, 
and 2 of the 4 subjects with nHCM also met protocol-specified criteria for mavacamten plasma 
concentration <1000 ng/mL.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) - double blind period
No subject had any on-treatment AEs resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation. There were no 
permanent treatment discontinuations due to LVEF ≤ 30%.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – long-term follow-up
Two (1.9%) subjects had at least one TEAEs resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation due to 
decreased LVEF ≤ 30%.

Data presented in this table are treatment emergent.
In the RCT-Mava oHCM treatment group, 3 subjects (2.4%) experienced temporary interruptions of 
study treatment due to 4 AEs of dizziness, joint swelling, syncope, or tinnitus (1 subject each); for 1 
subject, both dizziness and joint swelling (with the same AE onset date) were reported as AEs leading 
to temporary interruption of study treatment. In the RCT-Placebo oHCM group, 4.7% (6 subjects) 
experienced temporary interruptions of study treatment due to AEs of electrocardiogram QT prolonged, 
enthesopathy, facial paralysis, gastritis viral, headache, or vomiting. In the case of 1 subject who 
experienced 2 non-serious Grade 1 AEs of electrocardiogram QT, the subject also met protocol-
specified criteria for QTcF prolongation.
In the RCT-Mava nHCM treatment group, 2 subjects (5.1%) experienced temporary interruptions of 
study treatment due to AEs of arthritis, cardiac failure, or renal failure; for 1 subject, both renal failure 
(onset SD1) and arthritis (onset SD55) were reported as AEs leading to temporary interruption of 
study treatment, and for 1 subject the non-serious Grade 3 AE of cardiac failure (onset SD73 with 
same day resolution) was concurrent with AEs of dyspnoea and fatigue and the subject subsequently 
(SD85) met protocol-specified LVEF reduction criteria for permanent discontinuation of study 
treatment. No subject in the RCT-Placebo nHCM group experienced a temporary interruption of study 
treatment due to AE. 
Considering all mavacamten-exposed subjects with any indication (All-Mava combined), 28 subjects 
(8.9%; includes the 5 mavacamten-treated subjects from the randomized placebo-blinded studies 
described earlier in this section) experienced temporary interruptions of study treatment due to AEs. 
The AEs leading to temporary interruption of study treatment in the All-Mava combined group in ≥2 
subjects was ejection fraction decreased, QT prolongation, headache, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
VALOR study (MYK-461-017) - double blind period
Temporary treatment discontinuations / drug interruption due to AEs were reported in 4 (7.1%) 
subjects in the mavacamten treatment group and 1 (1.8%) subject in the placebo group (Table 90).

2 subjects in the mavacamten group met the criteria for temporary discontinuation for LVEF<50%. 1 
subject in the mavacamten group had 2 temporary interruptions of study drug for worsening atrial 
fibrillation (interruption of 1 day and 5 days; each time mavacamten was resumed at the same dose). 
1 subject in the mavacamten group had temporary interruption of study drug for worsening 
palpitations, fatigue, and shortness of breath (subject proceeded to SRT without resuming 
mavacamten). 1 subject in the placebo group had temporary dose interruption for worsening dizziness 
and dyspnea (subject proceeded to SRT without resuming IP).No subjects discontinued study due to 
COVID-19 .

VALOR study (MYK-461-017) – long-term follow-up
During the LTFU, 6 subjects in the previous mavacamten treatment group and no subjects in the 
previous placebo treatment group had interruption of study therapy. There were no dose interruptions 
or delays due to COVID-19.
Five (4.6%) subjects had any on-treatment AEs resulting in temporary treatment discontinuation. The 
reported AEs leading to temporary treatment discontinuation were atrial fibrillation (1 subject), 
palpitations (1 subject), fatigue (1 subject), ejection fraction decreased (3 subjects), and dyspnoea (1 
subject).
2.5.8.10.  Late breaking information
After the data cut-off for the SCS (30-Oct-2020), the Sponsor was notified of an accidental exposure of 
mavacamten to an infant. The exposure involved a 10-month-old child of a male subject receiving

mavacamten in the long-term extension Study MYK-461-007, and the exposure was reported as 45 mg 
mavacamten (3 capsules of 15 mg each) resulting in cardiac arrest and subsequently to death. 
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety
Clinical safety database. The safety evaluation is based on the pivotal phase 3 EXPLORER-HCM 
study (MYK-461-005), and supplemented by safety data from the phase 2 studies (MYK-461-004 and 
MYK-461-006) and data from the two ongoing long-term extension studies (MYK-461-007 and MYK-
461-008) with a cut-off date of 31 August 2021. This pooled analysis approach can be considered 
appropriate for an evaluation of, amongst others, the cardiovascular safety profile, as mentioned in the 
‘Reflection paper on the assessment of the cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products 
(EMA/CHMP/50549/2015).
Three integrated populations, categorized by indication (i.e. oHCM and nHCM), were used for further 
analyses: All patients in the 5 studies who received at least one dose of mavacamten (all-mava), 
patients in the RCTs who received at least one dose of mavacamten (RCT-mava), and patients in the 
RCTs who received placebo (RCT-placebo), which can be considered acceptable.
Further, all safety data for the pivotal VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) up to a cut-off date of 7 
February 2022 are presented, in addition to the integrated analyses of pooled safety data from five 
earlier mentioned clinical studies. 
Exposure. Of the 314 mavacamten-treated subjects in the integrated safety analyses, 123 subjects 
were in the RCT-mava oHCM population. The average daily dose of these subjects was 6.69 mg 
(range: 2.2 - 11.6 mg). This is generally in line with the doses as recommended in the SmPC of 
mavacamten (2.5 – 15 mg). Doses in the nHCM patients and all-mava were in the same range. The 
median exposure duration was 7.0 months (range: 0.3 - 9.3 months), as the study had a duration of 
30 weeks. Total exposure of RCT-mava was 70.87 patient-years. Comparable with the MYK-461-005 
study, the most frequent dose received in the VALOR-HCM double-blind (DB) period was 5 and 10 mg. 
The mean (SD) duration of exposure was 17.0 (2.13) weeks for subjects who received mavacamten. 
Overall, the mean (SD) duration of exposure was 32.59 (20.012) weeks for all the subjects (n=108) 
who received mavacamten during the DB period plus long-term follow-up (LTFU). 
Patients who completed treatment in the parent studies had a washout/follow-up period prior to 
enrolling and prior to being exposed again to study treatment in the extension studies, which was 15.7 
weeks for 115 subjects who had their last dose in study MYK-461-005 and their first dose in study 
MYK-461-007. A similar time interval was seen in the patients from study MYK-461-006 to study MYK-
461-007. For 13 subjects from study MYK-461-004 to study MYK-461-008 the time interval between 
studies was even more with 53.3 weeks. Since these patients had a large non-treatment time interval 
between the parent and extension studies, mavacamten exposure cannot be considered continuous. 
A total of 245 subjects qualified as having >1 year duration of exposure in a single study, and 59% 
and 25% of these 245 subjects completed at least 18, and 24 months of mavacamten treatment, 
respectively. The median duration of exposure was 19 months (range: 12.0 - 39.8 months). Total 
exposure of oHCM patients treated >1 year was 325 patient-years. It should be noted that a 
substantial part of the exposure time was during the titration phase, while patients were still on a 
suboptimal dose. The VALOR-HCM study is still ongoing and since only 14 patients are exposed to 
mavacamten for > 1 year, such data have not been presented. 
According to the guideline ICH-E1 ‘Population Exposure: The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess 
Clinical Safety’ 100 patients exposed for a minimum of one-year is considered to be acceptable to 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 241/277
include as part of the safety database at dosage levels intended for clinical use. Currently, since the 
documented safety exposure consists of a total of 245 subjects (207 subjects with oHCM and 38 
subjects with nHCM) qualified as having >1 year duration of exposure in a single study, the current 
data fulfil the requirements of the guideline ICH-E1.   
Generally, the applicant followed the Scientific Advices of the EMA and MEB. However, concerns were 
raised regarding exclusion of a detrimental effect on cardiovascular safety, and it was questioned 
whether a PASS could provide sufficient reassurance. On the other hand, it was acknowledged that 
after EXPLORER-HCM, there could be doubts on the ethical acceptability of a cardiovascular outcomes 
trial in oHCM. As discussed further below, cardiovascular safety remains of important concern, since 
mavacamten is a first-in-class selective myosine inhibitor, that directly targets the pathophysiology of 
the disease, i.e. oHCM, by specifically targeting the cardiac mechanisms, which might have deleterious 
effects on contractility, resulting in reduced ejection fraction and heart failure in the long term. The 
applicant provided an extensive discussion on how the concerns on the safety profile, including the 
detrimental effect of cardiovascular safety, of mavacamten should be further addressed. Based on the 
reasoning of the applicant, a cardiovascular trial is considered unfeasible and unethical to be performed 
and, according to the guideline, the applicant’s suggestion to conduct a meta-analysis, with continuous 
monitoring of the cardiovascular safety of mavacamten by routine pharmacovigilance, the ongoing LTE 
studies and the two non-interventional observational studies, is agreed and currently included as a 
category 3 study in the RMP. 
Impact of COVID-19. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the collection of data was significant 
since site visits were not possible, and many of the protocol-specified assessments were not performed 
for 67 subjects in the pivotal study MYK-461-005 at Week 38 (26%; 31/123 in the mavacamten and 
37/128 subjects in the placebo group). These subjects completed their Week 38/end of study visit via 
telephone. Further, in total, 24 subjects in the MYK-461-007 study (all with oHCM) were discontinued, 
since the required safety monitoring assessments could not be performed in the clinic. All of these 
subjects subsequently re-enrolled into the same study. Within the pooled safety database, three 
COVID-19 infections were reported during the study periods. No action was taken with study 
treatment, and it can be considered that this had no significant consequences for the available study 
results on safety. The same findings were presented for the VALOR-HCM study, where COVID-19 did 
not impact the overall quality or outcome of the study.
Adverse events (AEs). In study MYK-461-005 (EXPLORER-HCM), TEAEs were frequently reported, 
and the percentage of subjects with ≥1 AEs was higher in the mavacamten (87.8%) than in the 
placebo (81.3%) group in the oHCM patients. Generally findings were similarly seen in the nHCM 
patients (89.7% vs 68.4%, respectively) and appeared to be in line with the all-mava population of the 
pooled safety database (92.7%) and with the study populations of VALOR-HCM (73.2% vs 61.8% for 
mavacamten and placebo respectively).
The most frequently reported AEs (≥5% in mavacamten group and at least 2 % higher than the 
placebo group) in the pivotal Study MYK-461-005 were dizziness (21.1% in RCT-Mava oHCM vs. 13.3% 
in RCT-Placebo oHCM), dyspnoea (14.6% vs. 10.2%), headache (12.2% vs. 7.8%), atrial fibrillation 
(8.1% vs 2.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.1% vs 4.7%), back pain (8.3% vs 6.3%), cough 
(8.1% vs 3.1%), and arthralgia (5.7% vs 1.6%). Data were generally in line with the nHCM group and 
VALOR-HCM study population. In the VALOR-HCM DB period the most frequently reported AEs (≥5% in 
the mavacamten group and at least 2% higher than the placebo group) were fatigue (8.9% vs 3.6% 
for mavacamten and placebo, respectively), atrial fibrillation (7.1% vs 0), nausea (7.1% vs 1.8%), 
dizziness (7.1% vs 5.5%), dyspnea (7.1% vs 5.5%), rash (7.1% vs 0%), urinary tract infection (5.4% 
vs 1.8%), and hypertension (5.4% vs 3.6%).
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 242/277
For the adverse drug selection process, data from the 2 Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies 
(EXPLORER-HCM through Week 38 and VALOR-HCM through Week 16 double-blind period) were 
pooled. Selection criteria for ADR consideration were based on the AE occurrence ≥5% (all causality) 
in mavacamten-treated subjects and ≥2% higher than subjects who received placebo. The AEs, more 
frequently observed in mavacamten-treated subjects than in subjects who received placebo included 
dizziness, dyspnea, atrial fibrillation, arthralgia, cough, upper respiratory tract infection. Further 
assessment of analyses of the events of upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and arthralgia showed 
no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship of the use of mavacamten and the event, based on 
non-related cases and low numbers. They were not included as an ADR in the SmPC of mavacamten. 
However, regarding dizziness, based on the comparative incidence (n= 30, 16.8% vs n=20, 10.9% in 
the RCT-MAVA and RCT-placebo group, respectively), which can be considered relatively high, 
dizziness should be considered an ADR. Inclusion of this ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC of 
mavacamten, as proposed by the applicant, is agreed. Also, there was observed an imbalance in 
dyspnoea events in the oHCM population in the RCT-mava with the RCT-placebo treatment groups 
(n=22, 12.3% vs. n=16, 8.7%). During the on-treatment period of MYK-461-005, dyspnoea events 
were balanced between groups (7.4% vs 8.2%, resp.), while dyspnoea events were more frequently 
reported during the follow-up/washout period in mavacamten-treated subjects than subjects who 
received placebo (14 subjects vs 4 subjects). This may be a consequence of a decreasing effect of 
mavacamten, since plasma levels are decreasing during washout, and LVOT gradients returning 
(increasing) back to baseline. The applicant has accepted the CHMP recommendation to add dyspnea 
as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC, although there are confounding factors. Further, regarding 
headache, the applicant presented an imbalance with the oHCM population (n=15, 12.2% in 
mavacamten vs. n=10, 7.8% in placebo) in the pivotal study MYK-461-005. Although the imbalance 
was not seen in subjects without beta-blocker use (RCT-Mava combined vs. RCT-Placebo combined: 
headache in subjects with beta-blocker use, 9.3% vs. 4.1%; headache in subjects without beta-blocker 
use, 1.9% vs. 3.4%). Furthermore, during the DB period of the VALOR-HCM study, headache was 
reported in a lower frequency in the mavacamten group compared with the placebo group (n= 2 
(3.6%) vs n=5 (9.1%) respectively). Therefore, based on the evaluation of the recently available 
pooled analysis of Week 38 and Week 16 safety data of EXPLORER-HCM and VALOR-HCM, the event 
“headache” is not included as an ADR, which is agreed. Further, there was a disbalance in the 
incidence in atrial fibrillation (AF) (8.4% vs 5.5%) in the pooled analyses. However, AF is not 
considered an ADR as it is the most common arrhythmia encountered in HCM patients, since it is well 
recognized that the prevalence of AF in HCM patients is approximately 20%, which is also indicated by 
the high percentage of recurrent AF events (see below “events by medicinal concept” for further 
discussion). Although syncope was not an ADR based on the used criteria, syncope is included as an 
ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC based on a numerical imbalance in the EXPLORER-HCM study; 
however, the applicant considers that events of syncope are heavily confounded by other factors.
Serious adverse events (SAEs). Three deaths have been reported in the safety database. One 
occurred in the placebo arm, the other two cases in the mavacamten-treated population, for which a 
possible relationship with the use of mavacamten and death is considered unlikely. In the VALOR-HCM 
study (in the long-term follow-up period) one subject died. The patient, who previously received 
placebo treatment until Week 16 and then received mavacamten treatment post Week 16, had a 
sudden cardiac death at week 56. Since the event was confounded to underlying HCM, ventricular 
fibrillation, pulmonary fibrosis and new-onset pneumonia, a clear relationship with the use of 
mavacamten cannot be concluded. 
In the pivotal study, the incidence of SAEs was relatively low with no large differences in percentages 
in subjects in the RCT-mava compared to the RCT-placebo group (n=14, 11.4% vs n=12, 9.4%), 
which is reassuring. Generally similar findings were seen in the nHCM patients and figures appeared to 
be in line with the all-mava population. The most frequent reported SAEs were atrial fibrillation (n=3, 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 243/277
2.4% in RCT-Mava oHCM vs. n=5, 3.9% in RCT Placebo oHCM), syncope (n=3, 2.4% vs. n=1, 0.8%, 
respectively), and stress cardiomyopathy (n=2, 1.6% vs. 0%, respectively). No patterns for a new 
unexpected safety signal could be identified from the current available SAE safety data, but the 
number of events were too low in order to make firm conclusions. Also, in the VALOR-HCM study the 
incidence of SAEs was relatively low, although with a higher proportion (n=3, 5.4%) in the 
mavacamten group through week 16 than in placebo group (n=1, 1.8%). Two subjects on 
mavacamten versus none of the subjects on placebo experienced cardiac disorders attributed to atrial 
fibrillation. One subject in the mavacamten group had acute COVID-19 infection. One subject in the 
placebo group had acute alcohol intoxication. Atrial fibrillation events are further discussed below. No 
subjects experienced SAEs of congestive cardiac failure, syncope, or sudden cardiac death. 
Adverse events of special interest. In the RCT population, no event of LVEF ≤30% was reported. In 
the all-mava population, only one nHCM patient in the extension study MYK-461-007 experienced an 
LVEF reduction to <30%, related to the study drug. Mavacamten is currently not indicated for patients 
with nHCM. In the VALOR-HCM LTFU period, 2 (1.9%) subjects experienced LVEF ≤ 30%, which were 
both considered related to study therapy by the investigator, although there were confounding factors.
None of the patients in the RCTs, including the VALOR-HCM study, suffered from a symptomatic 
overdose (none reported), but there were 3 identified in the extension studies (1 oHCM, 2 nHCM). 
Overall, overdose cases were low, and this concern is currently well reflected in section 4.9 of the 
SmPC based on data from the phase 1 PK studies in HCM patients and healthy subjects. No further 
information is needed, based on the currently available overdose data from the integrated safety 
database and the VALOR-HCM study data.
Regarding embryofoetal toxicity, currently no clinical data exist on the safety of mavacamten during 
pregnancy in humans, while significant foetal toxicity and teratogenicity potential have been 
demonstrated for mavacamten in two animal species and should be regarded as a potential human 
developmental toxicant. This safety concern is included as an important potential risk in the RMP, 
which is appropriate.
Events by medical concept. No concerns have been found with hypotension, severe cutaneous 
adverse reactions (SCAR), gastro-intestinal events, rhabdomyolysis/myopathy, renal and hepatic 
events, fall-related events and hypersensitivity.
In the pivotal oHCM study, the percentages of subjects with a syncope AE were higher in the 
mavacamten group compared with placebo (n=7, 5.7% vs. n=2, 1.6%, respectively). However, the 
percentages of AEs in presyncope showed a converse effect on AEs (n=2, 1.6% on mavacamten vs 
n=5, 3.9% on placebo). Further, the total number of AEs of syncope and pre-syncope events between 
the groups were generally similar (n=8, 6.5% vs n=7, 5.5%, respectively), which is reassuring, but 
might be the effect of the converse findings of the two events. Similar results are found in the nHCM 
population and when the broader definition of syncope events has been used. Overall, although some 
cases have alternate aetiologies that could better explain the occurrence of the event, the imbalance 
points to a possible relationship of the use of mavacamten and the occurrence of syncope in the cases. 
Syncope is therefore added as an ADR to section 4.8 of the SmPC.
Data analysis for the major pre-defined cardiovascular events have been evaluated and adjudicated by 
an independent committee (CEAC). These are discussed below:
In the pivotal Study MYK-461-005, the percentage of subjects who met protocol-specified criteria for 
LVEF reduction <50% was higher in the mavacamten group compared to the placebo group (relative 
risk 3.64 (95%CI 0.77, 17.19); n=7, 5.7% and n=2, 1.6%, respectively). In total, across the 
integrated analyses, there were 36 unique mavacamten-treated subjects (19 with oHCM and 17 with 
nHCM) who met protocol-specified criteria for LVEF reduction. Based on quantitative LVEF data for the 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 244/277
lowest qualifying LVEF values for each unique individual subject, the median qualifying LVEF reduction 
for all 19 subjects with oHCM was LVEF 44.67% (range 34.8% to 49.3%), and the median qualifying 
LVEF reduction for 16 subjects with nHCM was LVEF 44.25% (range 20.0% to 49.3%). Most (28/36) of 
the LVEF reductions <50% were not reported as AEs, since this parameter was part of the dose 
adjustment strategy. Four subjects with oHCM and 2 subjects with nHCM permanently discontinued 
study treatment. The LVEF values were all reversible, which is not unexpected based on the 
mechanism of action of mavacamten. The data in the all-mava population were consistent with the 
data from the pivotal studies, with similar reversibility. Seventeen out of the 36 (47%) mavacamten-
treated patients with LVEF reductions experienced symptomatic AEs. Also, of the 19 subjects with 
oHCM and qualifying LVEF reductions, 2 subjects had mavacamten plasma trough concentration ≥1000 
ng/mL, 7 subjects had mavacamten plasma trough concentrations between 700 and 1000 ng/mL, and 
the remaining 10 subjects had mavacamten plasma trough concentrations that were <700 ng/mL at 
the time of or most proximately prior to the LVEF measurement. Similar findings were seen for the 
nHCM group. Regarding the DB period of the VALOR-HCM study, no subjects experienced heart failure 
(HF). Two (3.6%) subjects in the mavacamten treatment group were reported with decreased LVEF 
event of <50% during the DB, which were asymptomatic and had no associated signs of HF. Also in 
the LTFU period, two subjects in the mavacamten treatment group and no subjects in the previous 
placebo treatment group met the temporary discontinuation criterion of LVEF <50%. Another 6 (5.6%) 
patients were reported with at least one on-treatment HF and decreased LVEF event, were considered 
as AEs. These data show that LVEF reduction <50% can be considered as a conservative approach 
regarding cardiovascular safety. Since there is an imbalance identified in the pivotal study and since an 
association seems reasonable based on the mechanism of action, it is agreed that LVEF reduction 
<50% is included as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Further, the safety concern is also included as 
an important identified risk in the RMP.
MACE was defined as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, CV death and heart failure hospitalization, 
and is in line with the definition for MACE as reflected in the ‘Reflection paper on assessment of 
cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products’ (EMA/CHMP/50549/2015), and can thus be 
considered acceptable. Overall, the risk for MACE was considered higher (relative risk 1.73; 95% CI: 
0.42-7.10) in the mavacamten group (n=5, 4.1%) vs the placebo group (n=3, 2.3%) in the pivotal 
study, with a higher incidence rate of 5.75/100 patient-years (PY) for the mavacamten group and 
3.27/100 PY for the placebo group. Of note, 2 of the patients in the mavacamten group experienced 
MACE events in the washout period. No MACE was reported in the double-blind period of the VALOR-
HCM study, but 2 (1.9%) subjects during LTFU period for total mavacamten treatment. Both MACE 
events occurred in the previous placebo group. One (0.9%) subject was reported with MACE related to 
sudden cardiac death after permanently discontinued due to LVEF <30%. Additionally, 1 (0.9%) 
subject was reported with MACE related to heart failure hospitalization and LVEF <30% around Week 
30. However, the number of oHCM patients who experienced MACE was low, and should therefore be 
interpreted with caution. 
Based on the AEs reported in the pivotal study MYK-461-005, although the event rate was very low, 
heart failure (HF) was balanced between the treatment groups (mavacamten vs. placebo: any grade 
n=3, 2.4% vs. n=5, 3.9%; Grade ≥3 n=1, 0.8% vs. n=1, 0.8%), also when adjudicated by the CEAC. 
The incidence of events (n=22, 7.1%) was more substantial in the all-mava population. The 
occurrence of the events is not unexpected, since HF is importantly confounded by the underlying 
disease and can be considered a consequence of the LVEF reduction due to the use of mavacamten. In 
the DB period of the pivotal VALOR-HCM study, there were no events of HF.
In the RCTs, the percentage of oHCM patients with AEs of atrial fibrillation was similar on both the 
mavacamten vs the placebo group (n=10, 8.1% vs n=10, 7.8%, respectively). Similar figures were 
shown for the nHCM groups and in the all-mava population. There was also no imbalance observed on 
Assessment report 
EMA/311929/2023 
Page 245/277
the events of ventricular arrhythmias with even lower numbers (2.4% vs 2.3%, respectively). It is 
noted that there was an imbalance of atrial fibrillation at baseline (9.8% vs 18.0% in mavacamten and 
placebo, respectively), but cases of both incident AF and recurrent AF were generally similar in number 
and frequency on treatment during the study. Further, the AF event rate per 100-patient-year on 
mavacamten was not observed to increase over time. In the VALOR-HCM study, atrial fibrillation or 
atrial flutter were observed in a higher frequency in the mavacamten group compared with the placebo 
group (7.1% (n=4) vs 0). However, 3 of the 4 subjects had recurrent atrial fibrillation with known 
atrial fibrillation in the medical history, which is reassuring. One additional AF SAE was reported during 
the long-term follow-up period. Post hoc analyses in subjects with AF at different (more than one) dose 
level and by plasma concentration do not show a clear concentration dependence for AF, which is 
reassuring. Moreover, AF is the most common arrhythmia encountered in HCM patients and can arise 
under various circumstances; the prevalence of AF in HCM patients is approximately 20%.
Across the integrated safety analyses, in first instance no imbalances in QT-interval and arrhythmia 
AEs and ECG data have been observed in the placebo and treatment and all-mava groups. Of note, 
while the QT-effect of mavacamten on healthy volunteers and animals resulted in prolongation of 
cardiac ventricular repolarization, a slight QTcF shortening was observed in oHCM subjects in the 
clinical studies, going towards normalization of the QT interval in these patients, since their QT interval 
was prolonged at baseline. There is no signal of torsade de pointes in subjects with oHCM caused by 
mavacamten. The findings in the integrated clinical safety database are in line with the findings in the 
PD analyses. Regarding the VALOR-HCM study, maximum change from baseline > 60 ms was observed 
only in mavacamten treatment group in 3.6% of the subjects in the double-blind period. Overall, a 
QTcF regression analysis was performed on all 56 subjects (53 were on SOC HCM medications) who 
were administered mavacamten, and showed a negative slope, thereby showing no concentration 
effect of mavacamten on QTcF. No new significant safety concerns have been identified by these data. 
Overall, apart from the expected effect on LVEF reduction, no other significant safety concerns 
regarding cardiovascular effects have been observed from the currently available safety data, although 
these data are limited and current numbers were too low to draw firm conclusions. Therefore, in 
addition to continuous monitoring of the cardiovascular safety of mavacamten by routine 
pharmacovigilance, the ongoing LTE studies and the two non-internventional observational studies, a 
meta-analysis to evaluate the cardiovascular safety profile of mavacamten will be conducted, which is 
considered acceptable. This meta-analysis includes data from existing and planned well-controlled, 
double-blind, randomized phase 3 studies of mavacamten versus placebo (from EXPLORER-HCM, 
VALOR-HCM, nHCM Phase 3 and China oHCM Phase 3) and is currently included as a category 3 study 
in the RMP. 
Laboratory findings. No clinically meaningful differences with respect to most of the haematology 
parameters and clinical chemistry lab values were observed. However, a larger increase in glucose 
levels was seen in the oHCM mavacamten group combined vs the placebo group combined (mean 
glucose value change, 17.9 mg/dL vs. 10.3 mg/dL, respectively). However, the clinical importance of 
this difference can be considered small, since maximum post-baseline glucose values were overall 
balanced between the groups (mean, 113.7 mg/dL vs. 113.9 mg/dL; median, 106.0 mg/dL vs. 105.0 
mg/dL; Q3, 121.0 mg/dL vs. 115 mg/dL; maximum, 351.0 mg/dL vs. 316 mg/dL). Findings in the 
VALOR-HCM study were similar.
Further, regarding the cardiac biomarker for myocardial wall stress NT-proBNP and the cardiac 
biomarker for myocardial injury cTnI a reduction was seen in both parameters. The effect was 
consistent in the extension studies. This effect is probably not adverse. It is also not unexpected and is 
in line with the effect of the mechanism of action of mavacamten.

Vital signs. By evaluation of the incidence of ICD therapy and resuscitated cardiac arrest in the 
pivotal study, the study-scheduled ICD downloads did not reveal any shocks, with the exception that 
one subject in the mavacamten group had an SAE of device inappropriate shock delivery. The patient 
had a high BMI and it was noted that the subject had a tendency to go into sinus tachycardia during 
physical exercise and stopped study therapy 25 days before the event occurred. The event was 
dissolved on the same day. A causal association of the high energy inappropriate shocks delivered by 
ICD and the use of mavacamten is not likely. Also in the VALOR-HCM study no notable changes have 
been observed.
Special population and situations. Currently, the comparisons of the safety in special populations in 
the RCT-mava and RCT-placebo populations and in the all-mava population did not identify new 
relevant safety concerns.
No relevant effects from gender, race, beta-blocker use and renal function could have been identified 
due to low numbers. Atrial fibrillation events were observed more in male mavacamten-treated 
subjects compared to females and the converse was seen in the placebo groups. However, numbers 
remained low. No new relevant safety concerns, based on age categories could be identified from the 
safety data. No relevant large imbalances were revealed, although an increase in the incidence of 
events is observed for dizziness, dyspnoea and headache, which is not unexpected with age increase. 
Regarding CYP2C19 metabolizers, only 5 subjects with PM genotype for CYP2C19 received 
mavacamten in the randomised studies and 2 continued in the extension study (one subject had no 
AEs, one subject had some mild AEs), which is considered very limited to further evaluate this 
population based on clinical data. Uncertainties remain in the clinical pharmacology studies on PM of 
CYP2C19 (see clinical pharmacology section). CYP2C19 PM is included in the summary of safety 
concerns of the RMP.
Regarding use in pregnancy and lactation, in the non-clinical studies, mavacamten was detected in 
extra-embryonic tissues, such as the placenta. Placenta transfer could be indicative of transfer in the 
mother milk. Clinical data are however not available, but it is a critical gap in knowledge for the use 
with mavacamten. Therefore, ‘pregnancy’ is included as a contra-indication in section 4.3 of the SmPC 
and ‘use during lactation’ is included in the RMP as missing information.
No relevant safety signals have been observed in the overdose, medication errors or drug abuse cases. 
No specific studies on the effects of mavacamten on the ability to drive or operate machinery have 
been performed. Dizziness is currently included as ADR in the SmPC of mavacamten. Patients are 
advised in section 4.7 of the SmPC not to drive or use machines if they experience dizziness during 
treatment.
AEs leading to discontinuation. The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was higher in the 
mavacamten group, as compared to the placebo group (n=2, 1.6% vs 0%) in RCT oHCM patients. 
Similar findings were observed with the nHCM patients (n=3, 7.7% vs 0%) and in all-mava (n=17, 
5.4%). The most frequent AEs leading to discontinuations were atrial fibrillation and ejection fraction 
decreased and cardiac failure, which is in line with the mechanism of action or underlying disease. 
Furthermore, no other pattern with respect to type of AE leading to discontinuation of study drug has 
been observed. Also no trend with respect to type of AE leading to drug interruptions has been 
identified. Regarding the VALOR-HCM study, none in the double-blind period, but 2 (1.9%) subjects 
had at least one TEAEs resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation in the long-term follow-up 
period. The reported investigations were due to decreased EF ≤ 30% in 2 (1.9%) of the subjects, 
which are discussed earlier in this section.
Late-breaking information. There was reported an accidental exposure of mavacamten to a 10-
month-old infant. The seemingly healthy child took 3 capsules of 15 mg and suffered from cardiac

and reflects its mechanism of action as a (first-in-class) selective myosine inhibitor, since LVEF 
reduction was (more) frequently reported in the test population. Mavacamten appeared to be generally 
well tolerated with dizziness and dyspnoea as most common reported AEs. Although the current safety 
profile of mavacamten does not suggest any safety concerns, a detrimental effect on cardiovascular 
safety could not be excluded. Therefore, a meta-analysis, with continuous monitoring of the 
cardiovascular safety of mavacamten by routine pharmacovigilance, LTE studies and two non-
interventional observational studies, will be conducted to follow-up this uncertainty. The proposed 
posology in the SmPC for mavacamten in patients with an unknown CYP2C19 genotype was questioned 
from a safety perspective (i.e. potential systolic dysfunction). CYP2C19 poor metabolisers have a 3-fold 
higher plasma exposure compared to CYP2C19 non-poor metabolisers. 
The effect of a high plasma concentration can be expected to translate to clinical efficacy and safety 
due to the clear relationship between plasma exposure and LVEF and VLVOT. Limited safety data on 
CYP2C19 poor metabolizers are currently available in the target population. Therefore, an adjusted 
posology for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers is recommended in the SmPC. If treatment initiation occurs 
prior to determination of CYP2C19 phenotype, patients should follow dosing instructions for poor 
metabolisers until CYP2C19 phenotype is determined.

2.8.2.  Additional monitoring
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Camzyos (mavacamten) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
The target indication applied for by the applicant is:
“Camzyos is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic (New York Heart Association, NYHA, class II-
III) obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) in adult patients (see section 5.1).”
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disorder defined by left ventricular (LV) 
hypertrophy that cannot be explained by another cardiac or systemic disease (Marian and Braunwald 
2017). HCM is a chronic, progressive disease of the cardiomyocyte and largely of the cardiac 
sarcomere, with a diverse clinical presentation and course. HCM can be familial and is the most 
common genetic disease affecting the heart muscle. Mutations in cardiac myosin and other sarcomere 
proteins increase calcium sensitivity of myofilaments and can dysregulate sarcomere structure, 
favouring the formation of excess cross-bridges during systole and diastole, altering sarcomere 
kinetics, and increasing sarcomere energy utilization, resulting in ventricular hypercontractility 
accompanied by reduced LV compliance, which is reflected clinically as reduced ventricular chamber 
size, often supranormal ejection fraction, and diastolic dysfunction. Over time, HCM leads to tissue 
remodelling characterized histologically by myocyte hypertrophy and disarray, microvascular 
remodelling, and fibrosis.
Obstructive HCM and nonobstructive HCM (nHCM) are 2 subclassifications of HCM. Both subtypes of 
HCM are characterized by LV hypercontractility, hypertrophy, and reduced compliance. However, oHCM 
also has reduced LV outflow, defined as peak LV outflow gradient ≥30 mmHg at rest or with 
provocation, due to structural changes in the LVOT.
Subjects with oHCM experience progressive diminishing cardiac function and are at greater risk of 
developing heart failure and symptoms from systolic dysfunction and atrial fibrillation, which increases 
the risk of thromboembolic stroke. Additionally, patients with HCM have an increased risk of sudden 
cardiac death (SCD) ranging from 0.5%-2% per year, which is directly related to changes in cardiac 
structure and function, including LVOT gradient, maximal wall thickness, and left atrial volume index 
(LAVI). 
Subjects with oHCM often experience symptoms which include shortness of breath at rest or with 
exertion, fatigue, chest pain, and limited exercise capacity that worsen over time in the absence of 
effective treatment. The presence and degree of symptoms vary across patients. Variability in 
symptom presentation may lead to delays in diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and receiving treatment that 
targets diseases other than HCM.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Currently, there are no approved disease-specific or sarcomere-targeted therapies for oHCM in EU. The 
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline states that in the absence of large randomized clinical 
studies, pharmacological therapy is administered on an empirical basis to improve functional capacity, 
reduce symptoms, and prevent disease progression. The current guideline relies on the use of 
established negative inotropic agents, including beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium 
channel blockers, and disopyramide, resulting in a reduction of SAM/septal contact and LVOT 
obstruction (Elliott et al. 2014) (Ommen et al. 2020). Non-vasodilating beta-blockers (propranolol or 
nadolol) are recommended as first-line therapy in patients with symptomatic LVOT obstruction. 
Calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) are recommended in patients who are intolerant or 
have contra-indications to beta-blockers. Disopyramide is recommended in addition to a beta-blocker 
(or, if this is not possible, with verapamil) if beta-blockers alone are ineffective. A combination of a 
beta-blocker and a calcium channel blocker is not recommended. However, none of the 
recommendations is supported by Level A Evidence, as the available clinical data are not supported by 
adequate, well-controlled, randomized, double-blind trials.
Nonpharmacological, invasive therapies, including septal myectomy and septal alcohol ablation, 
are available for patients with LVOT gradient ≥50 mmHg, NYHA Class III or IV, and/or recurrent 
exertional syncope despite maximal pharmacological therapy (Elliott et al. 2014). These procedures 
can be effective in reducing obstruction and improving LV outflow, but they do not address the 
underlying myocardial disease and are not a permanent treatment, as residual or recurrent obstruction 
may occur and/or underlying diastolic dysfunction with symptoms may remain. An implantable 
cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may be considered in HCM to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD).
The main goals of treatment in HCM are diminishing disease progression, and control of symptoms 
and improvement of exercise limitation, abolition or reduction of dynamic intraventricular gradients, 
treatment of LV dysfunction and heart failure, control of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias, 
and prevention of cardio-embolism (Ammirati et al. 2016), thereby decreasing mortality and morbidity. 
Despite maximally tolerated treatment with current therapeutic options, many patients continue to 
show pathophysiological evidence of disease (e.g., LVOT gradient > 50 mmHg, systolic anterior motion 
(SAM) of the mitral valve, enlarged atria, elevated cardiac biomarkers) and/or impaired function (NYHA 
Class II-III and reduced patient-reported health status). 
Therefore, the limited pharmacological and surgical options to treat the chronic and progressive 
symptomology of oHCM leave a treatment gap for oHCM patients and an unmet medical need for a 
targeted therapy that addresses the underlying disease pathophysiology of oHCM. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The main evidence of efficacy and safety to support this MAA comes from the two pivotal studies 
EXPLORER-HCM (MYK-461-005) and VALOR-HCM (MYK-461-017). 
EXPLORER-HCM is a pivotal phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 
international, parallel-group study evaluating the efficacy and safety of mavacamten, when added to 
HCM-background therapy, in subjects with symptomatic oHCM defined by 1) unexplained LV 
hypertrophy with nondilated ventricular chambers in the absence of other cardiac or systemic disease 
and with maximal LV wall thickness ≥15 mm (or ≥13 mm with positive family history of HCM) and 2) 
LVOT peak gradient ≥50 mmHg during screening as assessed by echocardiography at rest, after 
Valsalva manoeuvre, or post exercise. Further, at screening, subjects were required to have 
documented LVEF > 55% at rest, Valsalva LVOT peak gradient ≥30 mmHg, and NYHA Class II or III. A 
total of 251 subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 2.5, 5, 10, or 15 mg mavacamten (n = 123) or 
placebo (n = 128) once daily for 30 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of posttreatment follow-up. Subjects 
initiated treatment with mavacamten 5 mg. At Week 6, Week 8, and Week 14, the mavacamten dose 
was up-titrated or down-titrated for individual subjects based on pre-specified criteria, including 
mavacamten plasma concentration and echocardiography responses at week 4, 6 and 12, respectively. 
The primary endpoint was a composite functional response at Week 30, defined as achieving 1) An 
improvement of ≥1.5 mL/kg/min in pVO2max as determined by CPET and a reduction of ≥1 NYHA class 
or 2) an improvement of ≥3.0 mL/kg/min in pVO2max with no worsening in NYHA class. Key secondary 
endpoints included the individual components of the primary endpoint, pVO2max and NYHA class, post-
exercise LVOT peak gradient and patient-reported outcomes. 
VALOR-HCM is a confirmatory phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
mavacamten vs placebo in subjects ≥18 years old with symptomatic oHCM who met the 2011 
American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF)/AHA guideline criteria for SRT, were referred for an 
SRT procedure within the past 12 months and were actively considering scheduling the procedure. 
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the mavacamten (n=56) or placebo (n=56) 
treatment groups and stratified by the type of SRT procedure recommended (myectomy or ASA) and 
NYHA functional class. Subjects were treated in 3 dosing periods, including a placebo-controlled or 
double-blind period (Day 1 to Week 16), an active-controlled dosing period (Week 16 to Week 32), and 
an LTE dosing period (Week 32 to Week 128). The starting dose was 5 mg. At Week 4, the 
mavacamten dose could be down-titrated based on echocardiography response, e.g. VLVOT <30 
mmHg and up-titrated at Week 8 and 12 to a maximum dose of 15 mg based on LVEF ≥50% and 
VLVOT ≥30 mmHg dose. Of note, in Study MYK-461-017, dose adjustments were clinically guided 
based on ECHO assessments during scheduled evaluations of LVOT gradients, whereas Study MYK-
461-005 required scheduled PK/PD assessments of serum mavacamten concentrations (PK) and LVOT 
gradient and LVEF (PD) for the dose adjustment algorithm. The primary endpoint was the composite of 
a patient’s decision to proceed with SRT or eligibility for SRT according to the ACCF/AHA 2011 
guidelines after 16 weeks of treatment.
Supportive data are obtained from the ongoing long-term extension studies MAVA-LTE (Study MYK-
461-007) and PIONEER-OLE (Study MYK-461-008) and the phase II dose-ranging study PIONEER-
HCM.
3.2.  Favourable effects
EXPLORER-HCM
Primary endpoint. In the pivotal study EXPLORER-HCM, treatment with mavacamten resulted in a 
higher response rate (definition see above) than placebo, 36.6% vs 17.2%, respectively; treatment 
difference: 19.4%, 95% CI: 8.67, 30.13; p=0.0005).
Subgroups. Subgroup analysis concerning age, gender, BMI, LVEF at baseline, NYHA class, type of 
exercise testing, NT-proBNP at baseline, and HCM genotype generally showed consistent results on the 
primary endpoint. 
pVO2max. The second sequentially tested secondary endpoint in this study was pVO2max, which is 
considered the most important efficacy endpoint in this application. Mavacamten demonstrated a 
significant increase compared with placebo (1.4 ml/kg/min vs -0.05 ml/kg/min, respectively; 
treatment difference: 1.4 ml/kg/min, 95% CI: 0.59, 2.12; p=0.0006). This corresponds to an absolute 
mean change for mavacamten from 18.9 ml/kg/min at baseline to 20.4 ml/kg/min at week 30.
Other secondary endpoints. Mavacamten demonstrated a significant treatment effect on post-
exercise LVOT gradient of -35 mmHg compared to placebo (-47 mmHg vs -10 mmHg; 95% CI: -43.2, 
-28.1; p<0.0001). This corresponds to an absolute mean change in post-exercise LVOT gradient of 86 
mmHg at baseline to 38 mmHg at week 30. This latter value is below the level of consideration for SRT 
(≥50 mmHg) but still above the ≥30 mmHg criterion that defines obstruction in HCM patients. 
Additionally, treatment with mavacamten resulted in a higher percentage of subjects who had an 
≥1 class improvement from baseline in NYHA class (65.0% mavacamten vs 31.3% placebo; treatment 
difference 33.8, 95% CI: 22.15, 45.43; p <0.0001). Only one subject worsened in NYHA class (from 
NYHA class II to class III). Mavacamten treatment compared with placebo was associated with greater 
improvements in health status measured by KCCQ-23 CSS (mean (SD) of 13.6 (14.42) vs 4.2 (13.68), 
95% CI: 5.46, 12.66; p<0.0001) and by HCMSQ SoB score (mean (SD) of -2.8 (2.68) vs -0.9 (2.41), 
95% CI: -2.40, -1.20; p<0.0001).
Exploratory endpoints. Improvement in exercise performance and cardiac output was further 
supported by improvement in peak VE/VCO2, VE/VCO2 slope, peak circulatory power, ventilatory 
power, peak MET, percent predicted VO2 and ventilatory threshold as measured by cardiopulmonary 
testing. Furthermore, consistent with the MoA of mavacamten, which causes reduced contractility, 
treatment with mavacamten resulted in a slight increase in left ventricular end-systolic volume index 
(LVESVI). Further favourable effects of mavacamten were reductions in the percentage of subjects 
with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and mitral regurgitation, E/e’, and LAVI, 
suggesting improvements in LV filling during diastole, i.e. improved diastolic function. No differences 
were observed with respect to LV stroke volume (LVSV), heart rate, and cardiac output, which are 
indicators of cardiac function. Moreover, treatment with mavacamten resulted in a reduction in NT-
proBNP and cardiac troponin, indicating a reduction in LV wall stress and myocardial injury. 
Cardiac magnetic resonance substudy. Treatment with mavacamten resulted in a reduction in the 
LV mass index (mean difference -15.8 g/m2; 95% CI:-22.6, -9.0; p<0.0001), and a reduction in the 
exploratory endpoints of LV maximal wall thickness (mean difference -2.4 mm; 95% CI: -3.9, -0.9; 
p<0.0079), and in left atrial volume index over the 30-week treatment period. At the same time, 
myocardial contraction fraction and contractile fraction (stroke volume/LV mass ratio), which are load-
independent measures of LV pump reserve, were maintained. 
Long-term efficacy data. Results of the EXPLORER-LTE cohort of the long-term extension (MYK-461-
007) demonstrated that subjects receiving mavacamten continue to experience therapeutic benefit 
generally consistent with that achieved in the parent study with respect to LVOT gradient, NYHA class, 
and other transthoracic echocardiographic parameters. However, maintenance of the effect on 
pVO2max has not been demonstrated as this has not been assessed in this LTE. 
VALOR-HCM
Primary endpoint. In the pivotal study VALOR-HCM, treatment with mavacamten resulted in a lower 
proportion of subjects that decided to proceed with SRT or remained guideline eligible at Week 16 
compared with placebo (17.9% vs 76.8%, respectively; treatment difference (95% CI), 58.93 
(43.989,73.868); p <0.0001).
Subgroups. Subgroup analyses with respect to age, baseline resting LVOT gradient, duration since 
oHCM diagnosis, beta-blocker use at baseline, number of background HCM medication, baseline NT-
proBNP showed consistent results on the primary endpoint.
Secondary endpoints. Mavacamten treatment resulted in significant improvements compared to 
placebo on secondary endpoints of post-exercise LVOT gradient (treatment difference (95% CI): -37.2 
(-48.08, -26.24) mmHg; p<0.0001), ≥1 NYHA class improvement (treatment difference (95% CI): 
41.07 (24.48, 57.66); p<0.001), improvement in KCCQ- 23 CSS (treatment difference (95% CI) 9.45 
(4.868, 14.041) points; p<0.0001) and NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin I between groups geometric 
mean ratio, 0.33 (0.266, 0.421) and 0.53 (0.406, 0.700); both p<0.0001). 
Long-term efficacy data. As of the 07-February-2022 data cut, 71 subjects were randomized at least 
32 weeks (38 subjects in the mavacamten group and 33 in the placebo group). In the previous placebo 
group, 2 out of 33 (6.1%) subjects with Week 32 data proceeded to SRT, and 3 out of 33 (9.1%) 
subjects remained SRT eligible. These data is similar as those observed in the mavacamten group in 
the double-blind period. In the previous mavacamten group, 2 out of 38 (5.3%) subjects have 
proceeded to SRT and 2 out of 38 (5.3%) are SRT guideline eligible, which suggest maintenance of 
treatment effect or even increased magnitude of effect at Week 32. Maintenance of effect after 32 
weeks of treatment has also been demonstrated for these secondary endpoints.
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
EXPLORER-HCM
Primary endpoint. Exercise capacity in terms of pVO2max is acceptable as a primary efficacy 
endpoint; however, the primary endpoint, which is a composite of pVO2max and NYHA class is difficult 
to interpret and not adequately justified. As such, the focus in order to assess the B/R in this 
application was mainly be on the data of the individual component pVO2max, which was the second 
sequentially tested secondary endpoint in this study. 
Subgroups. A heterogeneity of effect on pVO2max was observed with respect to beta-blocker usage at 
baseline. Subjects who were not using beta-blocker showed a greater magnitude of the treatment 
effect on pVO2max compared with subjects who were using beta-blockers (between-group difference: 
2.7 ml/kg/min vs 1.0 ml/kg/min, respectively. The observed difference could be explained by the 
blunting effect of beta-blockers on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). 
Maintenance of effect. pVO2max has only been assessed in the pivotal study EXPLORER-HCM and 
not in its LTE study EXPLORER-LTE (MYK-461-007). Therefore, maintenance of effect on pVO2max has 
not been demonstrated.
Both pivotal studies
Health status. The improvements in health status measured by KCCQ-23 (between-group treatment 
difference: 9.1; p<0.0001 in EXPLORER-HCM and 9.45; p<0.0001 in VALOR-HCM) and HCMSQ SoB 
(between-group treatment difference: -1.8 ; p<0.0001 in EXPLORER-HCM) were both just below the 
clinically meaningful within-patient change thresholds (an increase of ≥10 and decrease ≥ 2.5 points 
respectively). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
Exposure. The updated pooled safety database consists of n=207 oHCM subjects exposed for a 
minimum of 1 year, which fulfils the requirements of the guideline ICH-E1 ‘Population Exposure’ (i.e. 
100 patients exposed for a minimum of 1 year at clinically recommended doses).
Adverse events (AEs). The most frequently reported AEs (≥5% in mavacamten group and at least 2 
% higher than in the placebo group) in the pivotal Study MYK-461-005 were dizziness (21.1% in RCT-
Mava oHCM vs. 13.3% in RCT-Placebo oHCM), dyspnoea (14.6% vs. 10.2%), headache (12.2% vs. 
7.8%), atrial fibrillation (8.1% vs 2.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.1% vs 4.7%), back pain 
(8.3% vs 6.3%), cough (8.1% vs 3.1%), and arthralgia (5.7% vs 1.6%). Data were generally in line 
with the nHCM patients and pooled data of mavacamten-treated patients.
Serious adverse events (SAEs). The incidence of SAEs was relatively low with generally no large 
differences in the mavacamten group compared to the placebo group (11.4% vs 9.4%). Generally, 
similar findings were seen in the nHCM patients, and findings appeared to be in line with the pooled 
data of mavacamten-treated patients. No patterns for a new unexpected safety signal could be 
identified from the current available SAE safety data.
Deaths. Three deaths have been reported in the safety database; one in the placebo arm and two in 
the mavacamten arm, for which a possible relationship to the study drug is considered unlikely. 
Cardiovascular safety. Data analyses for the major pre-defined cardiovascular events have been 
evaluated and adjudicated by an independent committee (CEAC). In the pivotal study, reported AEs of 
LVEF reduction were higher in the mavacamten group compared to the placebo group (7 subjects 
and 2 subjects, respectively), but numbers were low. The data in the pooled mavacamten-treated 
population were consistent with the data from the pivotal studies, with similar reversibility. More than 
half (56%) of the patients experience no symptoms from the LVEF reduction of mavacamten. These 
data show that LVEF reduction <50% in the posology can be considered as a conservative approach 
regarding cardiovascular safety. Further, although again the event rate was very low, heart failure 
was generally balanced between the treatment groups (mavacamten vs. placebo: 2.4% vs. 3.9%). The 
incidence of heart failure events (n=22, 7.1%) was more substantial in the pooled mavacamten 
population. The occurrence of the events is not unexpected since heart failure is importantly 
confounded by the underlying disease and can also be considered a consequence of the LVEF reduction 
due to the use of mavacamten. Also, no important imbalances in QT-interval and arrhythmia AEs 
and ECG data have been observed in the pivotal study (0 events in the mavacamten oHCM group and 
2 events in one subject in the placebo oHCM group). The ECG data for QTcF intervals and changes 
from baseline and the categorical data for QTcF intervals demonstrated a generally similar mean 
change in the mavacamten group (13.89 ms) vs the placebo group (15.76 ms), with similar findings in 
the nHCM patients and the pooled mavacamten population. Of note, while the QT effect of 
mavacamten on healthy volunteers and animals resulted in prolongation of cardiac ventricular 
repolarization, a slight QTcF shortening was observed in oHCM subjects in the clinical PD studies, which 
have been ascribed to a degree of normalization of the QT interval in the patients, since their QT 
interval was prolonged at baseline. The findings in the integrated clinical safety database are generally 
in line with the earlier findings of the PD analyses. No new significant safety concerns have been 
identified by these data. Also, although numbers were low, no relevant imbalance on atrial 
fibrillation was found (n=10 8.1% in mavacamten vs n=10 7.8% in placebo, respectively).
Further, there are no new safety signals on hypotension, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), 
gastro-intestinal events, rhabdomyolysis/myopathy, renal and hepatic events in the provided data.
Tolerability. The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuations was higher in the mavacamten group, as 
compared to the placebo group (1.6% (2 subjects) vs 0%). Similar findings were observed with the 
nHCM patients (7.7% (3 subjects) vs 0%) and in the pooled data of mavacamten-treated patients 
(3.2% (10 subjects)). The most frequent AEs leading to discontinuation were atrial fibrillation and 
ejection fraction decreased and cardiac failure, which is in line with the mechanism of action of the 
drug or the underlying disease. Furthermore, no other pattern with respect to the type of AE leading to 
discontinuation or interruptions of the study drug has been observed. 
VALOR-HCM study. The safety findings of the pivotal VALOR-HCM study were comparable to those 
observed in the pivotal EXPLORER-HCM study. In the VALOR-HCM DB period, the most frequently 
reported AEs (≥5% in the mavacamten group and at least 2% higher than the placebo group) were 
fatigue (8.9% vs 3.6% for mavacamten and placebo, respectively), atrial fibrillation (7.1% vs 0), 
nausea (7.1% vs 1.8%), dizziness (7.1% vs 5.5%), dyspnoea (7.1% vs 5.5%), rash (7.1% vs 0%), 
urinary tract infection (5.4% vs 1.8%), and hypertension (5.4% vs 3.6%). The incidence of SAEs was 
relatively low, although with a higher proportion (n=3, 5.4%) in the mavacamten group through week 
16 than in placebo group (n=1, 1.8%). In the DB period, two (3.6%) subjects in the mavacamten 
treatment group were reported with a decreased LVEF event of <50%, however, no subjects 
experienced HF. In the DB period, no subject had any on-treatment AEs resulting in permanent 
treatment discontinuation, whereas in the LTFU period, two (1.9%) subjects had at least one TEAE 
resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation due to decreased LVEF ≤ 30%, which were both 
considered related to study therapy by the investigator, although there were confounding factors.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
Cardiovascular safety. The number of oHCM patients who experienced MACE was low but was 
higher (relative risk 1.73; 95% CI: 0.42-7.10) in the mavacamten group (5 of 123, 4.1%, all SAE) vs 
the placebo group (3 of 128, 2.3%, all SAE) in the pivotal study MYK-461-005. In the pivotal study 
VALOR-HCM, no MACE was reported in the double-blind period. Overall, these figures are considered 
too low to draw firm conclusions.
Cardiovascular safety - meta analysis. Mavacamten is a first-in-class selective inhibitor of cardiac 
myosin ATPase, that directly targets the pathophysiology of the disease, i.e. oHCM, by specifically 
targeting the cardiac mechanisms, which might have deleterious effects on contractility, resulting in 
reduced ejection fraction and heart failure in the long term. Also, in Scientific Advices, important 
concerns were raised regarding the exclusion of a detrimental effect on cardiovascular safety. Since a 
CV outcome study is unfeasible and unethical to be performed, a meta-analysis will be conducted with 
continuous monitoring of the cardiovascular safety of mavacamten by routine pharmacovigilance, LTE 
studies and two non-interventional observational studies.
Subgroups. The impact of CYP2C19 phenotype on the pharmacokinetics of mavacamten is 
substantial. Clinical pharmacology studies have shown that mavacamten exposures increase 
dramatically (up to ~3 fold) in poor CYP 2C19 healthy volunteer metabolizers. The effect of a high 
plasma concentration can be expected to translate to clinical efficacy and safety due to the clear 
relationship between plasma exposure and LVEF and VLVOT. Limited safety data on CYP 2C19 poor 
metabolizers are currently available in the target population. Therefore, an adjusted posology for 
CYP2C19 poor metabolizers is recommended in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Patients with oHCM experience considerable symptoms, functional impairment, and poor quality of life. 
Additionally, patients with HCM have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (0.5% to 2% per year 
in adults with HCM). Currently, there are no disease-specific or sarcomere-targeted pharmacological 
therapies for oHCM available, only symptomatic treatment. Nonpharmacological invasive therapies 
include septal reduction therapies; however, they also do not address the underlying myocardial 
disease and are not a permanent treatment. Therefore, the limited pharmacological and surgical 
options to treat the chronic and progressive symptomology of oHCM leave a significant treatment gap 
for oHCM patients and an unmet medical need for a targeted therapy that addresses the underlying 
disease pathophysiology of oHCM. 
The current application is based on the results of two pivotal studies, EXPLORER-HCM and VALOR-HCM. 
In the EXPLORER-HCM study, the primary endpoint (a composite of pVO2max and NYHA) is difficult to 
interpret and not considered appropriate for this application. Consequently, the individual component 
pVO2max, which was the second sequentially tested secondary endpoint, is considered the most 
relevant efficacy endpoint. In the VALOR-HCM study, the primary endpoint of the composite of a 
patient’s decision to proceed with SRT or eligibility for SRT according to the ACCF/AHA 2011 guidelines 
after 16 weeks of treatment is considered a more robust (“hard”) clinical endpoint compared with 
pVO2max in the EXPLORER-HCM, since SRT is clinically relevant to patients and clinicians as it is a 
highly invasive surgery associated with significant consequential risk.
In EXPLORER-HCM, results show a significant but modest improvement in exercise capacity measured 
by pVO2max in oHCM patients administered mavacamten compared with placebo (1.4 ml/kg/min vs -
0.05 ml/kg/min, respectively; treatment difference (95% CI): 1.4 ml/kg/min (0.59, 2.12); p=0.0006), 
particularly in the subgroup of subjects using a beta-blocker (treatment difference: 1.0 ml/kg/min) 
which was the majority of the study population (75.3%). In support of the clinical relevance of the 
effect on pVO2max, reference was made to the HF-ACTION study (Swank AM, 2012), which showed 
that every 6% increase in pVO2max (0.9 ml/kg/min) was associated with a 5% lower risk of the 
primary endpoint of time to all-cause mortality or all-cause hospitalization (hazard ratio=0.95; 
CI=0.93-0.98; P<0.001). However, the study had several limitations, i.e. exercise intervention was not 
blinded to the patient and investigator due to the nature of the intervention, and a large amount of 
patients (30%) were excluded from the primary analyses because they either did not have a baseline 
or 3-month CPX test or experienced a primary outcome before the 3-month test, which could have 
biased the outcome. Additionally, it remains uncertain whether the results of the HF-ACTION study can 
be directly extrapolated to the EXPLORER-HCM study since the population is different; The HF-ACTION 
trial enrolled a broader HF population, however, with reduced LVEF (≤ 35%), whereas the EXPLORER 
study included patients with obstructive HCM with normal LVEF (> 55%). Further, the subjects enrolled 
in the HF-ACTION study received exercise as an intervention vs. mavacamten in EXPLORER-HCM. 
Exercise positively affects the body in many different ways, which may have contributed to the 
improved clinical outcome observed in the HF-ACTION trial. After all, the improvement in pVO2max 
after exercise training was relatively modest (0.6 ml/kg/min vs 0.2 ml/kg/min for usual care alone). 
The most important support for the clinical relevance of the effect on pVO2max observed in the 
EXPLORER-HCM study can be derived from the ongoing VALOR-HCM study, a phase 3 randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in US patients with oHCM eligible for septal reduction therapy

(SRT) according to the ACCF/AHA 2011 guideline. As of 07 February 2022 (the clinical cut-off data of 
the primary CSR), all subjects participating in the study completed the study through Week 16 and, as 
such, the primary analysis was conducted. These results showed that, after 16 weeks of treatment, a 
lower percentage of subjects in the mavacamten group continued to meet guideline criteria for SRT or 
elected to undergo the procedure compared with the placebo group (10/56 (17.9%) vs 43/56 (76.8%), 
respectively; p<0.001). Moreover, a beta-blocker subgroup analysis of VALOR-HCM data showed 
similar improvements in SRT eligibility, regardless of beta-blocker use (treatment difference: 52.41% 
beta-blocker no vs 61.71% beta-blocker yes), indicating internal consistency. During the procedure, 
the applicant has adequately justified that the overall positive beneficial results of the VALOR-HCM 
study can be extrapolated to the entire target population of the EXPLORER-HCM study, including the 
less compromised NYHA class II subpopulation based on the following 4 aspects: 1) overlapping study 
populations; 2) Consistent results for endpoints assessed in both studies; 3) consistent results on 
septal reduction therapy eligibility; 4) comparable safety profile. 
Furthermore, the beneficial effect on exercise capacity (pVO2max) and preventing patients from 
(progressing to) septal reduction therapy eligibility is supported by significant improvements in other 
relevant secondary/exploratory endpoints, including post-exercise LVOT, NYHA functional class, NT-
proBNP, and health status (KCCQ-23 CSS and HCMSQ SoB). 
The uncertainty regarding the maintenance of effect on PVO2max still remains, since only a benefit 
over a short period of 30 weeks has been demonstrated in the EXPLORER-HCM study, and the effect on 
exercise capacity has not been assessed in the LTE study. However, preliminary data up to at least 32 
weeks of the VALOR-HCM showed maintenance of treatment effect. Additionally, maintenance of effect 
up to at least 96 weeks has been demonstrated in terms of the secondary endpoints Valsalva LVOT, 
NYHA class, and NT-proBNP in the LTE studies. 
Based on the above, it can be concluded that the pivotal studies EXPLORER-HCM and VALOR-HCM 
demonstrate that mavacamten treatment results in clinically relevant improvements across the entire 
population of symptomatic NYHA Class II-III oHCM patients.
The impact of CYP2C19 phenotype on the pharmacokinetics of mavacamten is significant. Therefore, 
an adjusted posology for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers is recommended in the SmPC.
Safety data are primarily based on the pivotal phase 3 study EXPLORER-HCM supplemented with 2 
phase II studies and 2 ongoing LTE studies, providing 207 patients with an exposure of >1 year and on 
the ongoing pivotal phase 3 VALOR-HCM study (MYK-461-017) up to a cut-off date of 7 February 2022. 
Mavacamten appeared to be generally well tolerated with dizziness and dyspnoea as the most common 
reported AEs. Apart from the expected effect on LVEF reduction due to the MoA, no other significant 
safety concerns regarding cardiovascular effects have been identified from the currently available 
safety data, although these data are limited and current numbers were too low to draw firm 
conclusions. Therefore, in addition to continuous monitoring of the cardiovascular safety of 
mavacamten by routine pharmacovigilance, the ongoing LTE studies and the two non-interventional 
observational studies, a meta-analysis to evaluate the cardiovascular safety profile of mavacamten will 
be conducted, which is considered acceptable. This meta-analysis includes data from existing and 
planned well-controlled, double-blind, randomized phase 3 studies of mavacamten versus placebo 
(from EXPLORER-HCM, VALOR-HCM, nHCM Phase 3 and China oHCM Phase 3) and is currently included 
as a category 3 study in the RMP.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
The benefits of mavacamten in terms of significant improvement in exercise capacity (pVO2max) and 
preventing patients from (progressing to) septal reduction therapy eligibility are accompanied by 
limited risks. Nevertheless, the safety database remains too limited in order to exclude a detrimental 
effect on cardiovascular safety, for which a meta-analysis (with continuous monitoring of the 
cardiovascular safety of mavacamten by routine pharmacovigilance, LTE studies and two non-
interventional observational studies) will be conducted.

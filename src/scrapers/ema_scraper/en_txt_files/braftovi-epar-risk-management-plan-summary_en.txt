Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of the risk management plan for BRAFTOVI 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for BRAFTOVI when administered in combination 
with MEKTOVI or cetuximab. The RMP details important risks of BRAFTOVI in combination with MEKTOVI 
or  cetuximab,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about 
BRAFTOVI  in  combination  with  MEKTOVI  or  cetuximab  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing  information). 
Summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  for  BRAFTOVI  and  its  package  leaflets  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how BRAFTOVI should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for BRAFTOVI when administered in combination with MEKTOVI or cetuximab 
should be read in the context of all this information including the assessment reports of the evaluation 
and the plain-language summary, all of which are part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to current concerns will be included in future updates of the RMP for 
BRAFTOVI. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
BRAFTOVI  is  authorised  in  combination  with  MEKTOVI  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (see SmPC for the full indication). The 
active substance of BRAFTOVI is encorafenib and of MEKTOVI is binimetinib and both are given by the 
oral route of administration. 
BRAFTOVI in combination with cetuximab is authorised for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic 
colorectal  cancer  (CRC)  with  a  BRAF  V600E  mutation,  who  have  received  prior  systemic  therapy. 
Cetuximab is given by intravenous infusion. 
BRAFTOVI is not authorised for use as monotherapy. 
Further information about the evaluation of BRAFTOVI in combination with MEKTOVI or cetuximab can 
be found in the BRAFTOVI EPAR, including in the plain-language summaries, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage  
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=/pages/medicines/human/medicines/004580/human_ 
med_002298.jsp. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further
characterise the risks
Important  risks  of  BRAFTOVI  in  combination  with  MEKTOVI  or  cetuximab,  together  with  measures to 
minimise such risks and the proposed studies if any, for learning more about the risks of BRAFTOVI in 
combination with MEKTOVI or cetuximab, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products include: 
•
•
•
•
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so, as to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g. with or without
prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and regularly 
analysed,  including  PSUR/PBRER  assessments,  so  that  immediate  action  and  updates  can  be 
implemented as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of BRAFTOVI is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  BRAFTOVI  in  combination  with  MEKTOVI  or  cetuximab  are  risks  that  need  risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
taken safely.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of  BRAFTOVI as a 
single agent or in combination with MEKTOVI or cetuximab.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of BRAFTOVI as a single agent or in 
combination with MEKTOVI or cetuximab is possible based on available data, but this association has not 
yet been established and needs further evaluation. 
Missing information refers to information on the safety of BRAFTOVI as a single agent or in combination 
with MEKTOVI or cetuximab that is currently missing and needs to be collected.  
The following important risks are those specific to encorafenib regardless of the indication for use:

II.B Summary of important risks and missing information 
Important identified risk for encorafenib: Secondary skin neoplasms: cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma and new primary melanoma 
Evidence linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Secondary skin neoplasms including cuSCC and new primary melanoma 
represent a known class-effect with the use of BRAF inhibitors. 
CuSCC  and  new  primary  melanoma  have  been  identified  as  ADRs  for 
encorafenib single agent, based on the clinical trial data. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Associations  have  been  reported  with  older  age  (≥65  years)  for 
vemurafenib and dabrafenib-treated patients, and with prior skin cancer, 
and chronic sun exposure for vemurafenib-treated patients.

Risk minimisation 
measures 
QT prolongation is a class effect for BRAF inhibitors. For encorafenib, the 
determined  IC50  for  hERG  inhibition  indicates  an  unlikely  effect  of 
encorafenib  on QT prolongation  and  no clinical risk is predicted for QT 
results  suggest  encorafenib 
prolongation.  Safety  pharmacology 
administration  has  the  potential  to  result  in  small  increases  in  QTc 
interval  and  mild  increases  in  HR  at  a  clinically  relevant  dose.  Small 
increases in QTc interval and mild increases in heart rate were apparent 
in the Enco 300 population.  
Due to the theoretical risk of clinical complications (torsades de pointes, 
ventricular  arrhythmia)  due 
to  sustained  QT  prolongation,  QT 
prolongation class-effect is considered as potential. 
Risk factors for torsade de pointes other than QTc interval >500 ms or 
>60 ms increase from baseline value include uncorrected hypokalaemia, 
hypomagnesemia  and  hypocalcaemia,  long  QT  syndrome,  concomitant 
therapy with multiple QTc interval–prolonging drugs.  
Other  risk  factors  for  torsade  de  pointes  include  acute  myocardial 
infarction, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, diuretic therapy, 
age ≥65 years, female sex, family history of sudden cardiac death at <50 
years, cardiac disease and history of arrhythmia or bradycardia.

Evidence linking the risk

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
As  for  other  BRAF  inhibitors  and  based  on  its  mechanism  of  action, 
encorafenib  may  promote  malignancies  associated  with  RAS  mutation 
associated with activation of RAS through mutation or other mechanisms. 
No  cases  of  non-cutaneous  malignancy  with  RAS  mutation  possibly 
related to encorafenib were identified from the pooled safety data of the 
clinical development programme, however due to the seriousness of this 
class-effect  risk,  non-cutaneous  carcinoma  is  considered  an  important 
potential risk.

groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Encorafenib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4. Based on the PK data, 
the use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors was not allowed during clinical trials. 
Concomitant  administration  of  encorafenib  and  strong  or  moderate 
CYP3A4  inhibitors  may  lead  to  increased  encorafenib  exposure  and 
potential increase in toxicity.  
Risk  factors  include  any  medical  condition  requiring  the  use  of  strong 
(ritonavir,  itraconazole,  clarithromycin,  telithromycin,  posaconazole, 
grapefruit  juice,  etc.)  or  moderate  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (amiodarone, 
erythromycin, 
fluconazole,  diltiazem,  delavirdine,  amprenavir  and 
imatinib) with no possibility for an alternate therapy. 
Routine risk minimisation measures:

Important  potential  risk  for  encorafenib:  Over-exposure  in  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe hepatic impairment 
Evidence linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Results  from  a  dedicated  clinical  trial  indicate  a  25 %  higher  total 
encorafenib  exposures  in  patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  (Child-
Pugh  Class  A)  compared  with  subjects  with  normal  liver  function.  This 
translates into a 55 % increase of the unbound encorafenib exposure.  
The pharmacokinetics of encorafenib has not been evaluated clinically in 
patients with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class 
C)  hepatic  impairment.  As  encorafenib  is  primarily  metabolised  and 
eliminated  via  the  liver  and  based  on  PBPK  modelling,  patients  with 
moderate  to  severe  hepatic  impairment  may  have  greater  increases  in 
exposure  than  patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment.  No  dosing 
recommendation can be made in moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 
 
 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Risk  factors  are  those  well  known  for  hepatic  dysfunction  in  routine 
practice including patients with baseline hepatic impairment regardless of 
aetiology,  concurrent  hepatobiliary  disease/disorders  and  concomitant 
use of hepatotoxic agents. Patients with massive liver metastatic disease 
with  consequent  associated  moderate  to  severe  liver  dysfunction  are 
unlikely  to  be  candidates  for  the  combination  treatment  as  first-line 
therapy.

Missing information for encorafenib: Use in patients with severe renal impairment 
Evidence linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  were  excluded  from  the  pivotal 
trials and there are insufficient data to evaluate PK in these patients. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Presence of renal impairment regardless of aetiology, dehydration or poor 
oral  intake,  severe  and  untreated  gastrointestinal  disorders  leading  to 
dehydration  and  concomitant  use  of  nephrotoxic  agents.  In  addition, 
advanced cancer is a known risk factor for renal dysfunction.

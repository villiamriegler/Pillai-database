1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
This Type II variation for Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets seeks to extend the indication for the 
treatment of HIV-1 to include treatment-experienced adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age. 
This procedure in parallel with application EMEA/H/X/105G will cover the HIV paediatric population 
aged 2 to < 18 years.  
This Type II variation provides data related to treatment-experienced adolescents 12 to < 18 years 
old, combined with the limited treatment options and limitations of other drugs in the nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class to support the extension of use of Viread to include HIV-1 
infected treatment-experienced adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age. 
The MAH also provided a clinical overview that refers to the studies that comprise the ongoing clinical 
development programs for TDF both in HIV-1 and HBV infected paediatric subjects. 
Efficacy and safety data in HIV-1 infected adolescents are supported by the comprehensive adult data, 
and by clinical study data in younger HIV-1 infected subjects and in HBV infected adolescents. In 
addition, existing post-marketing data show the profile of AEs with a possible association to TDF in 
paediatric cases to be consistent with that observed in adults. 
The clinical studies referred to in the Clinical overview have been previously submitted for this product.  
-  GS-US-104-0321 (pivotal phase III study in HIV-infected adolescents) 
-  GS-US-104-0352 (pivotal phase III study in HIV-infected subjects aged 2 to <12 years of age)  
-  GS-01-926 (phase I study in HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects)  
-  GS-01-927 (phase I/II study in HIV-infected paediatric subjects)  
-  GS-US-174-0115 (pivotal phase III study in TDF-naive adolescents 12 to < 18 years old with CHB) 
This assessment report summarises the most relevant aspects of study GS-US-104-0321 in support of 
the extension of indication for the treatment of adolescents infected with HIV. Detailed data is included 
in the CHMP assessment report of the procedure EMEA/H/C/419/II/98 where this study has also been 
submitted.  
About the product 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF, TDF) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NtRTI).  
Viread tablets (containing 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil as fumarate, equivalent to 300 mg tenofovir 
DF or 136 mg of tenofovir) was first approved in US (26 October 2001), EU (5 February 2002), and 
other countries worldwide for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in 
combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) medicinal products in infected adults aged 18 years and 
older.  
Viread was subsequently approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in EU (23 April 2008) and 
US.

Following approval for use in adults, clinical development programs are being undertaken in HIV-1 and 
HBV infected paediatric subjects. In the EU, a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) for Viread was agreed 
on 08 February 2010 (EMEA-000533-PIP01-08, Decision Ref. EMA/63121/2010 P/18/2010).  
In the United States (US), Viread tablets were approved for the treatment of HIV-1 infected subjects 
12 to < 18 years of age and with body weight ≥ 35 kg on 25 March 2010. 
In the European Union, the MAH has submitted in June 2010 a type II variation EMEA/H/C/419/II/98 
to extend the therapeutic indication to treatment-experienced adolescents 12 to < 18 years of age and 
with body weight ≥ 35 kg. Following major objections raised by the CHMP, mainly driven by the lack of 
reassurance on the renal and bone toxicity of the drug in this population together with inadequate 
efficacy demonstration, the indication was not extended to include treatment-experienced adolescents 
12 to < 18 years of age and with body weight ≥ 35 kg.

micro-organisms, or to sediment dwelling organisms. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetics 
Available PK data in paediatric patients from initial studies 
Initial clinical studies were undertaken using an oral suspension formulation (GS-02-983 in HIV-1 
infected subjects 2 to 8 years of age) and 75-mg tablets of tenofovir DF (GS-01-926 and GS-01-927 in 
HIV-1 infected subjects 6 to 16 years of age). Each of these studies included pharmacokinetic 
assessments for all subjects. Based on data from these studies, the dose of tenofovir DF selected for 
investigation in subsequent studies was 8 mg/kg of actual body weight to a maximum of 300 mg/day 
(≥ 35 kg). 
Table 2.  Pharmacokinetic Evaluations in HIV-1 Infected Pediatric Subjects 
In adolescents, the efficacy and safety of TDF is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 study (GS-US-
104-0321) of HIV-1 infected, treatment-experienced adolescents (12 to 18 years of age and with a 
body weight ≥ 35 kg) who were failing to achieve virologic suppression on their existing antiretroviral 
regimen. In this pivotal study, TFV pharmacokinetics were examined in 8 HIV-1 infected adolescent 
subjects receiving the TDF 300-mg tablet once daily plus a background antiretroviral regimen for at 
least 4 weeks. Steady-state TFV exposures achieved in these subjects (AUCtau 3390.6 ng·h/mL, Cmax 
377.5 ng/mL, and Tmax 1.98 hours) were similar to those observed in HIV-1 infected adults receiving 
TDF 300 mg/day. 
Pharmacokinetic data are also available from 7 HIV-1 infected subjects 12 to < 18 years of age who 
received multiple doses of TDF 300 mg once daily (4 × 75 mg tablets) in earlier Phase 1/2 Studies GS-
01-926 and GS-01-927 (combined data). Tenofovir was rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax of 2.08 
hours and mean Cmax of 268.3 ng/mL. A mean AUCtau of 3007.8 ng•h/mL and a median T½ of 13.99 
hours were achieved. 
The overall PK data available, including the PK data in adolescent from the study -321, show an almost 
similar exposure in adolescents and adults dosed with the 300mg tablet, supporting the use of a

300mg dose (equivalent to a 8mg/kg dose for patient with 37.5kg weight) in adolescents aged 12 to 
<18 years and weighting ≥ 35kg.

and Efficacy of Tenofovir DF as Part of an Optimized Antiretroviral Regimen in 
HIV-1 Infected Adolescents 
Study Centers 
18 study centers: 17 in Brazil and 1 in Panama (US sites were initiated but did 
not enroll any subjects) 
Study Period: 
13 June 2006 (first subject screened) 
09 March 2009 (last subject observation for this report) 
Anticipated date for completion (last patient, last visit): By March 2013 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was as follows: 
•  To  assess  the  efficacy  of  tenofovir  DF  plus  a  genotype-guided  optimized 
background regimen (OBR) compared to placebo plus OBR in the treatment of 
HIV-1  infected  antiretroviral  treatment-experienced  adolescents  with  plasma 
HIV-1 RNA levels ≥ 1000 copies/mL through 24 weeks of drug exposure. 
The secondary objectives of this study (Weeks 0–48) were as follows: 
• To assess the efficacy of tenofovir DF plus a genotype-guided OBR compared 
to  placebo  plus  OBR  in  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  infected  antiretroviral 
treatment-experienced  adolescents  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  levels  ≥  1000 
copies/mL through 48 weeks of drug exposure. 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tenofovir DF plus OBR compared to 
placebo plus OBR. 
•  To  measure  changes  in  bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  in  the  two  treatment 
groups. 
A secondary objective that will be evaluated beyond Week 48 (Weeks 0–240) 
is as follows: 
• To evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment with 
tenofovir DF through up to 240 weeks of drug exposure. 
HIV-1  infected  male  and  female  subjects,  12  to  <  18  years  of  age,  with 
plasma  HIV-1  RNA  ≥  1000  copies/mL  and  weight  ≥  35  kg.  Subjects  were 
naive  to  tenofovir  DF  and  had  no  K65R  mutation  on  genotypic  testing,  had 
prior  treatment  experience  with  at  least  two  antiretroviral  drug  classes,  and 
were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 weeks at the 
time  of  study  entry.  Subjects  also  had  to  have  adequate  hematologic,  renal 
and hepatic functions, and based upon resistance testing, were able to receive 
an OBR not containing didanosine. Patients with history of significant renal or 
bone disease were excluded.

evaluation 
Among  secondary  endpoints:  DAVG48,  change  from  baseline  in  log10  HIV-1 
RNA at Weeks 24 and 48, change from baseline in CD4 cell count and CD4% 
at Weeks 24 and 48, proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 400 copies/mL 
and < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48, time to virologic failure 
Safety:  Safety  data  were  collected  for  the  following  parameters:  adverse 
events  (AEs);  clinical  laboratory  tests;  spine  and  total  body  BMD  (assessed 
using  DEXA);  bone  biochemical  markers;  height;  weight;  vital  signs;  and 
physical examinations (complete or symptom-directed). 
Dosing regimen 
Adolescent (weighing ≥ 35 kg) received the 300mg dose of TDF (i.e. approved 
adult  dose).  All  subjects  were  instructed  to  take  their  assigned  tenofovir  DF 
dose orally, once daily, without regard to meals. The tenofovir DF tablets were 
film-coated to mask taste. 
Study design 
This  was  a  48-week,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multi-
center study of the safety and efficacy of tenofovir DF as part of an optimized 
antiretroviral  regimen  in  HIV-1  infected  adolescents  (12  years  to  <  18  years 
of  age)  who  were  failing  their  current  antiretroviral  regimen  and  had  HIV-1 
RNA  levels  ≥  1000  copies/mL  at  screening.  Two  consecutive  96-week  study 
extensions  (ongoing)  will  evaluate  the  long-term  efficacy,  safety,  and 
tolerability  of  open-label  tenofovir  DF  as  part  of  an  optimized  antiviral 
regimen, providing data for up to 240 weeks of total drug exposure. 
Pretreatment: 
HIV-1  genotyping  was  performed  as  part  of  the  screening  assessments  to 
assist in the construction of an OBR, defined as at least 3, but no more than 5 
antiretroviral agents, not including tenofovir DF or placebo. 
Baseline–Week 48: 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tenofovir DF + OBR 
or 
placebo + OBR. 
Stopping rules: At Week 24, subjects who were adherent to study drug (in the 
opinion of the investigator), but did not demonstrate a ≥ 0.5 log10 copies/mL 
decrease  from  baseline  in  HIV-1  RNA,  were  considered  to  be  nonresponders 
and  were  unblinded.  Nonresponders  randomized  to  the  placebo  group  were 
given the option to continue on study and receive open-label tenofovir DF with 
an appropriate background regimen determined by the investigator. 
Nonresponders  randomized  to  the  tenofovir  DF  treatment  group  were 
discontinued from the study. 
The majority of efficacy and safety assessments were performed at each clinic 
visit  (Weeks  4,  8,  16,  24,  32,  40,  and  48).  Bone  biochemical  markers  were 
assessed at baseline, and at Weeks 4, 16, 24, 32, and 48. Dual energy x-ray 
absorptiometry  (DEXA)  scans  to  assess  spine  and  total  body  BMD  and  body 
fat (including limb fat) were performed at baseline, Week 24, and Week 48.

Main efficacy results 
Table 3.  The primary efficacy endpoint was time-weighted average change from baseline through 
Week 24 (DAVG24) in plasma HIV-1 RNA (log10 copies/mL). 
Both treatment groups exhibited clinically relevant decreases from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA; the 
median DAVG24 in plasma HIV-1 RNA was −1.580 log10 copies/mL in the tenofovir DF group (n = 44) 
and −1.549 log10 copies/mL in the placebo group (n = 41) (p = 0.55, Van Elteren test). However, 
there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the DAVG24 in plasma 
HIV-1 RNA or for any of the secondary efficacy endpoints at any of the timepoints analysed.

Gilead protocol number: GS-US-104-0321 
EudraCT number: 2007-003418-32  
This was a 48-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of the 
safety and efficacy of tenofovir DF as part of an optimized antiretroviral regimen in HIV-1 
infected adolescents (12 years to < 18 years of age) who were failing their current 
antiretroviral regimen and had HIV-1 RNA levels >= 1000 copies/mL at screening. Data 
from three consecutive 96-week study extensions (ongoing) have been used to evaluate the 
long-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of open-label tenofovir DF as part of an antiviral 
regimen, providing data for up to 336 weeks of total drug exposure. 
Pretreatment: 
HIV-1 genotyping was performed as part of the screening assessments to assist in the 
construction of an OBR, defined as at least 3, but no more than 5 antiretroviral agents, not 
including tenofovir DF or placebo. 
Randomized Phase: 
Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tenofovir DF + OBR or placebo

+ OBR. The majority of efficacy and safety assessments were performed at each clinic visit 
(Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48). At Week 24, participants who were adherent to study 
drug (in the opinion of the investigator), but did not demonstrate a >= 0.5 log10 copies/mL 
decrease from baseline in HIV-1 RNA, were considered to be nonresponders and were 
unblinded. Nonresponders randomized to the placebo group were given the option to 
continue on study and receive open-label tenofovir DF with an appropriate background 
regimen determined by the investigator. Nonresponders randomized to the tenofovir DF 
treatment group were discontinued from the study. 
Extension Phases: 
After completing 48 weeks of double-blind treatment with tenofovir DF or placebo, 
participants who had not reached 18 years of age, and who, in the opinion of the 
investigator, would derive clinical benefit from the use of open-label tenofovir DF, were 
given the option to continue (or initiate) treatment with open-label tenofovir DF in the first 
of three 96 week study extension periods. Nonresponders who received open-label tenofovir 
DF after Week 24 were also considered eligible for the first study extension if they met the 
above criteria at Week 48. 
After completing the first (or second) 96 week study extension, participants who had not 
reached 18 years of age, and who had shown ongoing clinical benefit from tenofovir DF, 
were given the option to continue receiving open-label tenofovir DF for an additional 96 
weeks or until tenofovir DF became commercially available in the country where the 
participants were enrolled, whichever occurred first.

Renal events 
One case of hypophosphatemia grade 1 was reported in tenofovir group occurring only once during the 
therapy. Estimated Creatinine Clearance decreased during the blinding period in both groups but more 
significantly in tenofovir group (-11 mL/min/1.73 vs -5,35 mL/min/1.73). 
Seven cases of grade 1 proteinuria have been reported in the tenofovir group compared to 2 cases in 
the placebo group.

In  the  double-blind  treatment  period,  differences  between  groups  in  the  percentage  change  from 
baseline  in  spine  BMD  were  not  statistically  significant;  as  expected  for  this  adolescent  population, 
increases from baseline in spine BMD were seen for both groups at Weeks 24 and 48.  
In the All TDF group, increases from baseline in spine BMD were seen at all time points. Spine BMD Z-
score was low at baseline (median −0.912) and 48% of subjects [39/81] had abnormal spine BMD at 
baseline  (Z-scores  ≤  −1).  No  clinically  relevant  change  was  seen  at  any  time  point.  There  were  no 
marked shifts from baseline in the clinical status of spine BMD Z-scores. 
Total Body Bone Mineral Density 
In  the  double-blind  treatment  period,  differences  between  groups  in  the  percentage  change  from 
baseline in total body BMD were not statistically significant; increases from baseline in total body BMD 
were seen in both groups at Weeks 24 and 48.  
In  the  All  TDF  group,  increases  from  baseline  in  total  body  BMD  were  seen  at  all  time  points.  Total 
body  BMD  Z-score  was  low  at  baseline  (median −0.758)  and  44%  of  subjects  (36/81)  had  abnormal 
total body BMD at baseline (Z-scores ≤ −1). No clinically relevant changes were seen at any time point 
in  total  body  BMD  Z-score,  and  no  clinically  relevant  shifts  from  baseline  were  seen  in  the  clinical 
status of total body BMD Z-scores. 
There is nevertheless a trend for a lower increase of total BMD in the tenofovir group compared to the 
placebo  group.  Moreover,  osteopenia  was  reported  as  an  AE  for  3  subjects  in  the  tenofovir  DF  group 
and  2  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  in  the  double-blind  treatment  period.  Even  though  no  AE  of 
osteopenia was serious, it is to be noted that osteopenia AEs were considered related to study drug for 
the 3 subjects in the tenofovir DF group and 1 subject in the placebo group. One of them with low BMD 
Z-score  at  baseline  had  further  reduction  of  BMD  during  treatment  and  experienced  fracture  (ankle 
fracture). 
Overall discussion 
1.6.  Pharmacovigilance system 
Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated Risk Management Plan which included a risk minimisation plan. The 
RMP was updated to address the safety concerns identified for tenofovir.. 
Risk minimisation plan 
The MAH proposed a HIV paediatric educational brochure for children and adolescents aged 2 to <18 
years to address renal and bone toxicity and to include dosing recommendations on this population, in 
addition to the educational brochure for adults. The CHMP recognises the need of this educational 
material and formalised the ongoing activities in Annex II of the product information. The key 
messages are reflected in Annex II of the product information. The CHMP requested the review the HIV 
educational brochure for children and adolescents aged 2 to <18 years.

Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Current approved Viread SmPC text is as follows: 
Statements in Section 4.2 of the Viread SmPC: 
Tenofovir is eliminated by renal excretion and the exposure to tenofovir increases in 
patients with renal dysfunction. There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance  50 ml/min) and long term safety data has not been evaluated for 
mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min). Therefore, in patients with 
renal impairment tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should only be used if the potential 
benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Dose interval 
adjustments are recommended for patients with creatinine clearance  50 ml/min. 
Mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50–80 ml/min): Limited data from clinical 
studies support once daily dosing of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with mild 
renal impairment. 
Moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–49 ml/min): Administration of 245 
mg tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) every 48 hours is recommended based on modeling 
of single-dose pharmacokinetic data in HIV negative and non-HBV infected subjects with 
varying degrees of renal impairment, including end-stage renal disease requiring 
haemodialysis, but has not been confirmed in clinical studies. Therefore, clinical 
response to treatment and renal function should be closely monitored in these patients. 
Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance  30 ml/min) and haemodialysis patients: 
Adequate dose adjustments cannot be applied due to lack of alternative tablet strengths, 
therefore use in this group of patients is not recommended. If no alternative treatment is 
available, prolonged dose intervals may be used as follows: 
Severe renal impairment: 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) may be administered 
every 72–96 hours (dosing twice a week). 
Haemodialysis patients: 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) may be administered 
every 7 days following completion of a haemodialysis session*. 
These dose adjustments have not been confirmed in clinical studies. Simulations suggest 
that the prolonged dose interval is not optimal and could result in increased toxicity and 
possibly inadequate response. Therefore clinical response to treatment and renal 
function should be closely monitored. 
* Generally, once weekly dosing assuming three haemodialysis sessions per week, each 
of approximately 4 hours duration or after 12 hours cumulative haemodialysis. 
No dosing recommendations can be given for non-haemodialysis patients with creatinine 
clearance < 10 ml/min. 
Warnings in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Co-administration of other medicinal products: Viread should not be administered 
concomitantly with other medicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. 
Renal function: Renal safety with tenofovir has only been studied to a very limited degree 
in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance  80 ml/min). 
It is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all patients prior to 
initiating therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and renal function (creatinine 
clearance and serum phosphate) is also monitored every four weeks during the first year, 
and then every three months. In patients at risk for renal impairment, including patients 
who have previously experienced renal events while receiving adefovir dipivoxil, 
consideration should be given to more frequent monitoring of renal function. 
Patients with creatinine clearance  50 ml/min, including haemodialysis patients: There 
are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients 
with impaired renal function. Therefore, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should only be 
used if the potential benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh the potential risks. 
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance  30 ml/min) and in 
patients who require haemodialysis use of tenofovir is not recommended. If no 
alternative treatment is available, the dosing interval must be adjusted and renal 
function should be closely monitored. 
If serum phosphate is  1.5 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/l) or creatinine clearance is decreased to 
 50 ml/min in any patient receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, renal function should 
Assessment report  
EMA/797673/2012  
Page 16/32
 
 
 
 
 
be re-evaluated within one week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood 
potassium and urine glucose concentrations. Consideration should also be given to 
interrupting treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in patients with creatinine 
clearance decreased to  50 ml/min or decreases in serum phosphate to  1.0 mg/dl 
(0.32 mmol/l). 
Use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of 
a nephrotoxic medicinal product (e.g. aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, foscarnet, 
ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2). If concomitant use of 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and nephrotoxic agents is unavoidable, renal function 
should be monitored weekly. 
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has not been clinically evaluated in patients receiving 
medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal pathway, including the 
transport proteins human organic anion transporter (hOAT) 1 and 3 or MRP 4 (e.g. 
cidofovir, a known nephrotoxic medicinal product). These renal transporter proteins may 
be responsible for tubular secretion and in part, renal elimination of tenofovir and 
cidofovir. Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of these medicinal products which are 
secreted by the same renal pathway including transport proteins hOAT 1 and 3 or MRP 
4 might be modified if they are co-administered. Unless clearly necessary, concomitant 
use of these medicinal products which are secreted by the same renal pathway is not 
recommended, but if such use is unavoidable, renal function should be monitored weekly. 
Bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with 
proximal renal tubulopathy. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate 
consultation should be obtained. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
a. Summary of the safety profile 
HIV-1 and hepatitis B: In patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, rare events of 
renal impairment, renal failure and proximal renal tubulopathy (including Fanconi 
syndrome) sometimes leading to bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to 
fractures) have been reported. Monitoring of renal function is recommended for patients 
receiving Viread (see section 4.4). 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
HIV-1 and hepatitis B:  
Renal impairment: As Viread may cause renal damage monitoring of renal function is 
recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8a). 
e. Other special population(s) 
Patients with renal impairment: Since tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can cause renal 
toxicity, close monitoring of renal function is recommended in any patient with renal 
impairment treated with Viread (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). 
Adverse reactions in Section 4.8b of the Viread SmPC: 
Renal and urinary disorders: 
Uncommon: increased creatinine 
Rare: acute renal failure, renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal renal 
tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome), nephritis (including acute interstitial 
nephritis), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus  
Metabolism and nutrition disorders: 
Very common: hypophosphataemia* 
Uncommon: hypokalaemia* 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 
Uncommon: rhabdomyolysis*, muscular weakness* 
Rare: osteomalacia (manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to 
fractures)*, myopathy* 
* This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy. It is 
not considered to be causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the 
absence of this condition. 
Update of labeling as appropriate 
Proposed additional Viread SmPC text specific to the treatment of pediatric patients is as 
follows (based on proposed updates to the Viread 245 mg SmPC): 
Statement in Section 4.2 of the Viread SmPC: 
The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended in paediatric patients with 
renal impairment (see section 4.4). 
Statements in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Renal and bone effects in paediatric population 
There are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity. 
Moreover, the reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a 
multidisciplinary approach is recommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis 
the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/797673/2012

(including decision for treatment withdrawal) and consider the need for 
supplementation. 
Renal effects 
Renal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported 
in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-
0352 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Renal monitoring 
Renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to 
treatment and monitored during treatment as in adults (see above). 
Renal management 
If serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient 
receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, renal function should be re-evaluated within one 
week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose 
concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy).  If renal abnormalities are 
suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist should be obtained to 
consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment. 
Co-administration and risk of renal toxicity 
The same recommendations apply as in adults (see above). 
Renal impairment 
The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended in paediatric patients with 
renal impairment (see section 4.2).  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should not be initiated 
in paediatric patients with renal impairment and should be discontinued in paediatric 
patients who develop renal impairment during tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy. 
Statement in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1 
Of 89 patients (2 to < 12 years) who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in study GS-
US-104-0352 (median exposure 104 weeks), 4 patients discontinued from the study due 
to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy. 
Statements in Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC 
Paediatric population:  
HIV-1: 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 4 out of 89 paediatric patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate discontinued due to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal 
tubulopathy (median tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure was 104 weeks). 
Additional Risk Minimization Activities 
Educational initiatives (‘HIV and the Kidney’ educational program, renal educational 
program for HBV, educational brochures distributed to prescribers). 
Update of educational program as appropriate 
Following the approval of the pediatric applications, renal risk minimization activities 
will be updated to include information on HIV-1 infected children and adolescents and 
HBV infected adolescents.  Educational brochures specific to the use of Viread in these 
pediatric populations will be distributed to pediatric prescribers. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Current approved Viread SmPC text is as follows: 
Statements in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Bone effects: In HIV infected patients, in a 144-week controlled clinical study that 
compared tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with stavudine in combination with lamivudine 
and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve patients, small decreases in bone mineral density of 
the hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups. Decreases in bone mineral 
density of spine and changes in bone biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater 
in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment group at 144 weeks. Decreases in bone 
mineral density of hip were significantly greater in this group until 96 weeks. However, 
there was no increased risk of fractures or evidence for clinically relevant bone 
abnormalities over 144 weeks.  
Bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with 
proximal renal tubulopathy. If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate 
consultation should be obtained. 
Paediatric population: Viread may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate-associated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future 
fracture risk are currently unknown (see section 5.1).

1 This adverse reaction may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy. It is 
not considered to be causally associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the 
absence of this condition. 
2 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not 
observed in randomized controlled clinical trials or the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
expanded access program. The frequency category was estimated from a statistical 
calculation based on the total number of patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate in randomized clinical trials and the expanded access program (n = 7,319). 
Statements in Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC 
Paediatric population:  
HIV-1: In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment experienced patients 12 
to < 18 years of age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 45) or placebo 
(n = 42) in combination with an optimised background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks.  
In patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or placebo, mean 
lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score 
was -0.866 and -0.584, respectively, at baseline. Mean changes at week 48 (end of 
double-blind phase) were -0.215 and -0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 
and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and placebo 
groups, respectively. The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate group compared to the placebo group. At week 48, six adolescents in the 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group and one adolescent in the placebo group had 
significant lumbar spine BMD loss (defined as > 4% loss). Among 28 patients receiving 
96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, BMD Z-scores declined 
by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body.

There are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity. 
Moreover, the reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a 
multidisciplinary approach is recommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis 
the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment 
(including decision for treatment withdrawal) and consider the need for 
supplementation. 
Bone effects: 
If bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients, consultation with 
an endocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. 
Statement in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1 
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In HIV-1 infected 
adolescents, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate were lower than those observed in subjects who received placebo.  In HIV-1 
infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who switched to tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate were lower than those observed in subjects who remained on their 
stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Chronic hepatitis B 
Reductions in BMD have been observed in HBV-infected adolescents.  The BMD Z-
scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were lower than 
those observed in subjects who received placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Statements in Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with 
stable, virologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were 
randomised to either replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
(n = 48) or continue on their original regimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks.   
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In patients who received 
treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar 
spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and -0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -
0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of

randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.184 and 
-0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and stavudine or 
zidovudine groups, respectively.  The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 
was similar between the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment group and the stavudine 
or zidovudine treatment group.  Total body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate treatment group compared to the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group.  
One tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treated subject and no stavudine or zidovudine treated 
subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48.  BMD Z-
scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects 
who were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 96 weeks. BMD Z-scores were 
not adjusted for height and weight. 
Chronic hepatitis B: In study GS-US-174-0115, 106 HBeAg negative and HBeAg positive 
patients aged 12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, 
elevated serum ALT (≥ 2 x ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 
months] were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) (n = 52) or placebo 
(n = 54) for 72 weeks.  
No subjects met the primary safety endpoint of a 6% decrease in lumbar spine BMD.  In 
subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or placebo, mean (SD) lumbar spine 
BMD Z-score was -0.43 (0.764) and -0.28 (0.813), and mean total body BMD Z-score 
was -0.20 (1.126) and -0.26 (0.878), respectively, at baseline.  The mean (SD) change in 
lumbar spine BMD Z-score from baseline to week 72 in subjects receiving tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate was -0.05 (0.310) and 0.07 (0.377) in those receiving placebo.  BMD 
Z-scores were not adjusted for height and weight. The mean change in whole body BMD 
Z-score in subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was -0.15 (0.379) and 0.06 
(0.361) in those receiving placebo.  The mean percentage increase in whole body and 
lumbar spine BMD from baseline to week 72 was 2.84% and 4.95%, respectively, in 
subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  These mean percentage increases in 
whole body and lumbar spine BMD were 2.53% and 3.19% less, respectively, when 
compared to subjects receiving placebo.  Three subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate group and 2 subjects in the placebo group had a decrease of > 4% in spine 
BMD. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Statement in Section 4.2 of the Viread SmPC: 
If Viread is discontinued in patients with chronic hepatitis B with or without HIV co-
infection, these patients should be closely monitored for evidence of exacerbation of 
hepatitis (see Section 4.4). 
Warning in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Flares after treatment discontinuation: Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has also been 
reported in patients who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy. Post-treatment 
exacerbations are usually associated with rising HBV DNA, and the majority appears to 
be self-limited. However, severe exacerbations, including fatalities, have been reported. 
Hepatic function should be monitored at repeated intervals with both clinical and 
laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after discontinuation of hepatitis B therapy. If 
appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B therapy may be warranted. In patients with 
advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended since 
post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. 
Liver flares are especially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated 
liver disease. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
a. Summary of the safety profile  
Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients on treatment as well as in 
patients who have discontinued hepatitis B therapy (see section 4.4). 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: In HBV infected patients, 
clinical and laboratory evidence of exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after 
discontinuation of HBV therapy (see section 4.4). 
Update of labeling as appropriate. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Warning in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC (interaction also described in Section 4.5): 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine is not recommended. 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine results in a 40–60% 
increase in systemic exposure to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-
related adverse reactions. Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have 
been reported. Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and didanosine at a 
dose of 400 mg daily has been associated with a significant decrease in CD4 cell count, 
possibly due to an intracellular interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. active)

didanosine. A decreased dosage of 250 mg didanosine co-administered with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate therapy has been associated with reports of high rates of virological 
failure within several tested combinations for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
a. Summary of the safety profile  
Co- administration of Viread and didanosine is not recommended as this may result in an 
increased risk of adverse reactions (see section 4.5). Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic 
acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been reported (see section 4.4). 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Interaction with didanosine: Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 
didanosine is not recommended as it results in a 40-60% increase in systemic exposure 
to didanosine that may increase the risk of didanosine-related adverse reactions (see 
section 4.5). Rarely, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis, sometimes fatal, have been 
reported. 
Update of labeling as appropriate. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Pancreatitis is listed in Section 4.8b of the Viread SmPC: 
Gastrointestinal disorders: 
Uncommon: pancreatitis 
There are also warning statements in Sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the Viread SmPC 
regarding the risk of pancreatitis associated with the interaction with didanosine (see 
above). 
Update of labeling as appropriate. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Warning in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Lactic acidosis: Lactic acidosis, usually associated with hepatic steatosis, has been 
reported with the use of nucleoside analogues. The preclinical and clinical data suggest 
that the risk of occurrence of lactic acidosis, a class effect of nucleoside analogues, is 
low for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. However, as tenofovir is structurally related to 
nucleoside analogues, this risk cannot be excluded. Early symptoms (symptomatic 
hyperlactataemia) include benign digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting and abdominal 
pain), non specific malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, respiratory symptoms (rapid 
and/or deep breathing) or neurological symptoms (including motor weakness). Lactic 
acidosis has a high mortality and may be associated with pancreatitis, liver failure or 
renal failure. Lactic acidosis generally occurred after a few or several months of 
treatment. 
Treatment with nucleoside analogues should be discontinued in the setting of 
symptomatic hyperlactataemia and metabolic/lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, 
or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels. 
Caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogues to any patient 
(particularly obese women) with hepatomegaly, hepatitis or other known risk factors for 
liver disease and hepatic steatosis (including certain medicinal products and alcohol). 
Patients co-infected with hepatitis C and treated with alpha interferon and ribavirin may 
constitute a special risk. 
Patients at increased risk should be followed closely. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
a. Summary of the safety profile  
Lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis and lipodystrophy are associated 
with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see sections 4.4 and 4.8c). 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis: Lactic acidosis, usually 
associated with hepatic steatosis, has been reported with the use of nucleoside 
analogues. Treatment with nucleoside analogues should be discontinued in the setting of 
symptomatic hyperlactataemia and metabolic/lactic acidosis, progressive hepatomegaly, 
or rapidly elevating aminotransferase levels (see section 4.4). 
Lactic acidosis is listed in Section 4.8b of the Viread SmPC: 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders: 
Rare: lactic acidosis 
There are also warning statements in Section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the Viread SmPC 
regarding the risk of lactic acidosis associated with the interaction with didanosine (see 
above). 
Update of labeling as appropriate.

these events are currently unknown. Knowledge about the mechanism is incomplete. A 
connection between visceral lipomatosis and protease inhibitors and lipoatrophy and 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been hypothesised. A higher risk of 
lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with 
drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated 
metabolic disturbances. Clinical examination should include evaluation for physical 
signs of fat redistribution. Consideration should be given to the measurement of fasting 
serum lipids and blood glucose. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically 
appropriate. 
Tenofovir is structurally related to nucleoside analogues hence the risk of lipodystrophy 
cannot be excluded. However, 144-week clinical data from antiretroviral-naïve HIV 
infected patients indicate that the risk of lipodystrophy was lower with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate than with stavudine when administered with lamivudine and 
efavirenz. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
a. Summary of the safety profile  
Lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis and lipodystrophy are associated 
with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (see sections 4.4 and 4.8c). 
c. Description of selected adverse reactions 
Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat 
(lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous 
fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat 
accumulation (buffalo hump). 
In a 144-week controlled clinical study in antiretroviral-naïve patients that compared 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with stavudine in combination with lamivudine and 
efavirenz, patients who received tenofovir disoproxil had a significantly lower incidence 
of lipodystrophy compared with patients who received stavudine. The tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate arm also had significantly smaller mean increases in fasting 
triglycerides and total cholesterol than the comparator arm. 
Update of labeling as appropriate. 
Routine Risk Minimization Activities 
Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC states the following: 
Resistance: No HBV mutations associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate resistance 
have been identified. In cell based assays, HBV strains expressing the rtV173L, rtL180M, 
and rtM204I/V mutations associated with resistance to lamivudine and telbivudine 
showed a susceptibility to tenofovir ranging from 0.7- to 3.4-fold that of wild-type virus. 
HBV strains expressing the rtL180M, rtT184G, rtS202G/I, rtM204V and rtM250V 
mutations associated with resistance to entecavir showed a susceptibility to tenofovir 
ranging from 0.6- to 6.9-fold that of wild-type virus. HBV strains expressing the 
adefovir-associated resistance mutations rtA181V and rtN236T showed a susceptibility 
to tenofovir ranging from 2.9- to 10-fold that of wild-type virus. Viruses containing the 
rtA181T mutation remained susceptible to tenofovir with EC50 values 1.5-fold that of 
wild-type virus. 
Clinical resistance: Four hundred and twenty-six HBeAg negative (GS-US-174-0102, n 
= 250) and HBeAg positive (GS-US-174-0103, n = 176) patients were evaluated for 
genotypic changes in HBV polymerase from baseline. Genotypic evaluations performed 
on all patients initially randomised to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate arm (i.e 
excluding patients who received double-blind adefovir dipivoxil and then switched to 
open-label tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml at week 48 (n 
= 39), week 96 (n = 24) and week 144 (n = 6) and week 192 (n = 5) on tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate monotherapy, showed that no mutations associated with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate resistance have developed. 
In study GS-US-174-0108, 45 patients (including 9 patients with lamivudine and/or 
adefovir dipivoxil resistance mutations at baseline) received tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate for up to 48 weeks. Genotypic data from paired baseline and on treatment HBV 
isolates were available for 6/8 patients with HBV DNA > 400 copies/ml. No amino acid 
substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were identified 
in these isolates.

Statement in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Viread may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate-associated changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk 
are currently unknown. 
Statement in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
d. Paediatric population 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on one randomised trial (study 
GS-US-104-0321) in 87 HIV-1 infected adolescent patients (aged 12 to < 18 years) who 
received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in 
combination with other antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks. 
Statements in Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population:  
HIV-1: In study GS-US-104-0321, 87 HIV-1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 
to < 18 years of age were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 45) or placebo 
(n = 42) in combination with an optimised background regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks.  
In patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or 
placebo, mean lumbar spine BMD Z-score was -1.004 and -0.809, and mean 
total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, respectively, at baseline. Mean 
changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and -0.165 in 
lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score 
for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and placebo groups, respectively. The 
mean rate of BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group 
compared to the placebo group. At week 48, six adolescents in the tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate group and one adolescent in the placebo group had 
significant lumbar spine BMD loss (defined as > 4% loss). Among 28 patients 
receiving 96 weeks of treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, 
BMD Z-scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. 
The efficacy and safety data derived from this study do not support the use of Viread in 
adolescents. 
Proposed additional Viread SmPC text specific to the treatment of pediatric patients is as 
follows (based on proposed updates to the Viread 245 mg SmPC): 
Statements in Section 4.2 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1: The safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in HIV-1 infected 
children under 2 years of age have not been established.  No data are available. 
Chronic hepatitis B: The safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in children 
with chronic hepatitis B aged 2 to < 12 years or weighing < 35 kg have not been 
established.  No data are available. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment: The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended in 
paediatric patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). 
Statements in Section 4.4 of the Viread SmPC: 
Renal and bone effects in paediatric population 
There are uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone and renal toxicity. 
Moreover, the reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  Therefore, a 
multidisciplinary approach is recommended to adequately weigh on a case by case basis 
the benefit/risk balance of treatment, decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment 
(including decision for treatment withdrawal) and consider the need for 
supplementation. 
Renal effects 
Renal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported 
in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients aged 2 to <12 years in clinical study GS-US-104-
0352 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Renal monitoring 
Renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to 
treatment and monitored during treatment as in adults (see above). 
Renal management 
If serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dl (0.96 mmol/l) in any paediatric patient 
receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, renal function should be re-evaluated within one 
week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose 
concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy).  If renal abnormalities are 
suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist should be obtained to 
Assessment report  
EMA/797673/2012

consider interruption of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment. 
Co-administration and risk of renal toxicity 
The same recommendations apply as in adults (see above). 
Renal impairment 
The use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended in paediatric patients with 
renal impairment (see section 4.2).  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate should not be initiated 
in paediatric patients with renal impairment and should be discontinued in paediatric 
patients who develop renal impairment during tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy. 
Bone effects:  
If bone abnormalities are detected or suspected in paediatric patients,, consultation with 
an endocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. 
Statements in Section 4.8 of the Viread SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
HIV-1: 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on two randomised trials (studies GS-US-104-
0321 and GS-US-104-0352) in 184 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 
years) who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (n = 93) or 
placebo/active comparator (n = 91) in combination with other antiretroviral agents for 
48 weeks (see section 5.1).  The adverse reactions observed in paediatric patients who 
received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were consistent with those 
observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in adults (see section 4.8 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions and 5.1). 
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients.  In HIV-1 infected 
adolescents, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate were lower than those observed in subjects who received placebo.  In HIV-1 
infected children, the BMD Z-scores observed in subjects who switched to tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate were lower than those observed in subjects who remained on their 
stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Of 89 patients (2 to < 12 years) who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in study GS-
US-104-0352 (median exposure 104 weeks), 4 patients discontinued from the study due 
to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy. 
Chronic hepatitis B: 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on one randomised study (study GS-US-174-
0115) in 106 adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years of age) with chronic hepatitis B 
receiving treatment with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) (n = 52) or placebo 
(n = 54) for 72 weeks.  The adverse reactions observed in adolescent patients who 
received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were consistent with those 
observed in clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in adults (see section 4.8 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions and 5.1).  
Reductions in BMD have been observed in HBV-infected adolescents.  The BMD Z-
scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were lower than 
those observed in subjects who received placebo (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Statements in Section 5.1 of the Viread SmPC 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 97 treatment experienced patients 2 to < 12 years of age with 
stable, virologic suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were 
randomised to either replace stavudine or zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
(n = 48) or continue on their original regimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks.   
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In patients who received 
treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar 
spine BMD Z-score was -1.034 and -0.498, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -
0.471 and -0.386, respectively, at baseline.  Mean changes at week 48 (end of 
randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, and -0.184 and 
-0.027 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and stavudine or 
zidovudine groups, respectively.  The mean rate of lumbar spine bone gain at week 48 
was similar between the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treatment group and the stavudine 
or zidovudine treatment group.  Total body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate treatment group compared to the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group.  
One tenofovir disoproxil fumarate treated subject and no stavudine or zidovudine treated 
subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 48.  BMD Z-
scores declined by -0.012 for lumbar spine and by -0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects 
who were treated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for 96 weeks. BMD Z-scores were 
not adjusted for height and weight. 
In study GS-US-104-0352, 4 out of 89 paediatric patients exposed to tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate discontinued due to adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal 
tubulopathy (median tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure was 104 weeks).

patients aged 12 to < 18 years with chronic HBV infection [HBV DNA ≥ 105 copies/ml, 
elevated serum ALT (≥ 2 x ULN) or a history of elevated serum ALT levels in the past 24 
months] were treated with tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (as fumarate) (n = 52) or placebo 
(n = 54) for 72 weeks.  
No subjects met the primary safety endpoint of a 6% decrease in lumbar spine BMD.  In 
subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or placebo, mean (SD) lumbar spine 
BMD Z-score was -0.43 (0.764) and -0.28 (0.813), and mean total body BMD Z-score 
was -0.20 (1.126) and -0.26 (0.878), respectively, at baseline.  The mean (SD) change in 
lumbar spine BMD Z-score from baseline to week 72 in subjects receiving tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate was -0.05 (0.310) and 0.07 (0.377) in those receiving placebo.  The 
mean change in whole body BMD Z-score in subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate was -0.15 (0.379) and 0.06 (0.361) in those receiving placebo. BMD Z-scores 
were not adjusted for height and weight. The mean percentage increase in whole body 
and lumbar spine BMD from baseline to week 72 was 2.84% and 4.95%, respectively, in 
subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.  These mean percentage increases in 
whole body and lumbar spine BMD were 2.53% and 3.19% less, respectively, when 
compared to subjects receiving placebo.  Three subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate group and 2 subjects in the placebo group had a decrease of > 4% in spine 
BMD. 
The proposed Viread oral granules SmPC also contains statements indicating that limited 
clinical data are available at the 6.5 mg/kg dose of the oral granules and therefore close 
monitoring of efficacy and safety is needed, and that investigations are planned to further 
substantiate the dose in children from 2 years of age. 
Following the approval of the pediatric applications, renal risk minimization activities 
will be updated to include information on HIV-1 infected children and adolescents and 
HBV infected adolescents.  Educational brochures specific to the use of Viread in these 
pediatric populations will be distributed to pediatric prescribers (see Renal Safety 
Concern).

1.7.  Changes to the Product Information 
The PI was updated accordingly and has been consolidated with parallel procedures X/105/G and II/115. 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication”  
This section was revised and the extension of the therapeutic indication was restricted for the 
treatment of HIV 1 infected adolescents, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first 
line agents, aged 12 to < 18 years. 
Section 4.2 “Posology and method of administration”  
This section was updated to include dose recommendations for use in HIV adolescents. 
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use”  
Warnings on the management of renal and bone effects were revised. 
This section was revised to inform on the uncertainties associated with the long term effects of bone 
and renal toxicity and to mention that the reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained. 
Therefore warnings were introduced to promote a multidisciplinary management of paediatric patients 
to adequately weigh the need for treatment, to adequately settle the monitoring and to foresee the 
need for supplementation. 
Furthermore physicians are alerted that significant laboratory abnormality suggestive of renal toxicity

during treatment should trigger specialised consultation. 
Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” 
This section was updated to reflect the two studies on paediatric population (children and adolescents). 
Section 5.1 “Pharmacological properties” 
This section was updated to state that due to limitations of the study GS-US-104-0321, a benefit of 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate over placebo was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at 
week 24. However, a benefit is expected for the adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult 
data and comparative pharmacokinetic data. 
Annex IIB Conditions of the marketing authorisation 
Annex II was updated to reflect key messages that should be included HIV and HBV renal educational 
brochures  
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Study GS-US-104-0321 have been initially submitted by the MAH in 2010 and assessed in the setting 
of type II variation II/98 to extend the indication of Viread for the treatment of HIV-infected 
adolescents. This variation was withdrawn by the applicant. 
At that time it was observed that this study failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint. No significant 
differences were found in virological response between patients treated with TDF or placebo (+OBR). 
However, when considering that 300mg TDF yielded to similar exposure in adolescents as compared to 
adult patients, there was no apparent reason to think that Viread would have different viral efficacy in 
these populations. The poor efficacy reported in the TDF arm was judged as being more likely to reflect 
pejorative baseline characteristics (in terms of OBR susceptibility and TDF resistance) in adolescents 
included in the TDF arm. In favour of this hypothesis, it was found that in subgroup analysis for 
subjects with OBR GSS ≤ 1 (TDF n=18, placebo n=10) TDF exhibited some activity in this highly 
pretreated patients contrarily to placebo.  
As regards the safety, a trend for a lower increase of total BMD in the tenofovir group compared to the 
placebo group as well as the occurrence of osteopenia after a medium term duration were observed, 
which were regarded as a source of concern in the targeted population. 
Meanwhile, further new data on the paediatric population has been available from both studies in HIV 
infected children (-0352) and HBV infected adolescents (-0115).  The salient aspect of the benefit/risk 
assessment of these studies was the renal and bone toxicity. On an efficacy point of view, Viread was 
perceived as a potential useful additional therapeutic option in children. In both indications, it is a 
widely used backbone regimen in adult patients due to its virological efficacy and high genetic barrier. 
Moreover, TDF is a once daily regimen, which is of interest especially in children. Therefore, the CHMP 
requested a SAG meeting to adequately address the bone and renal safety of tenofovir in the 
paediatric population with medical need. The SAG scope was further enlarged upon CHMP request. The 
SAG members were invited to give their position on the risk of bone and renal toxicity of Viread in the 
context of its use in both HIV and HBV infected paediatric and adult patients. PDCO members as 
experts provided input to the scientific discussion at the SAG. 
The SAG meeting was held the 3 May 2012. The discussion focused on the safety burden of tenofovir in 
the paediatric population and gave important information on the safety monitoring of the use of 
tenofovir in paediatric patients. Overall, SAG members highlighted the lack of correlation between DXA 
Assessment report  
EMA/797673/2012  
Page 27/32
 
 
 
 
  
 
measurements and bone events and the difficulties to provide specific recommendation as regards 
supplementation. 
As regards renal toxicity in adolescents, the SAG members did not foresee any specific reason for the 
renal toxicity in adults being different in children and adolescents. Only the phosphate loss resulting 
from tubulopathy could be of differential impact given that paediatric patients are in active process of 
bone modelling. The current recommendation of renal toxicity monitoring in adults are judged 
conservative enough and could overall be aligned for paediatric patients, especially having in mind that 
this paediatric population is expected to be closely managed in clinical practice. As regards the need 
for treatment interruption in paediatric patients, it was considered that instead of stating a specific 
threshold for withdrawal, as in adults, it would be more appropriate to give a general message that 
significant laboratory abnormality suggestive of renal toxicity during treatment should trigger 
specialised consultation. 
As regards bone toxicity, the SAG members have considered that it is currently questioned whether the 
observed toxicity of the drug could be of any long term consequence. Therefore the discussion on the 
benefit/risk could then amount balancing theoretical risks versus established benefit (virological 
suppression). When considering the need for specific monitoring, the SAG members refute the value of 
any BMD monitoring given the lack of established correlation with clinical event. Furthermore, it 
represents a burden for paediatric patients and raises practical and technical issues. As regards the 
need for phosphate and Vit D supplementation, the SAG members have considered that there was no 
apparent reason to deviate from the general attitude which prevails in clinical practice for a population 
in active modelling process (i.e. supplementation is considered in case of significant depletion).  
Overall, it was concluded that although there is a theoretical risk of long term effect of bone and renal 
toxicity of tenofovir, it cannot be opposed to the established benefit in a population of paediatric 
patients in need of treatment. However, the fact that there are uncertainties per se mandates special 
consideration on the use of tenofovir in a population of active modelling process. In HIV-infected 
children, the CHMP could support the use of tenofovir in the restricted population of patients with NRTI 
resistance or toxicity problems precluding the use of first line agents. 
Thus, further to new data from studies in HIV infected children and HBV infected adolescents and in 
the light of the outcome of the SAG, the CHMP considers that the Viread indication should be extended 
to the HIV-infected adolescents patients.  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
Given that the current backbone regimens are not only limited but also have limiting factors, tenofovir 
represents an additional therapeutic option in adolescents. Tenofovir is a widely used backbone 
regimen in adult patients due to its virological efficacy and high genetic barrier. Moreover, TDF is a 
once daily regimen, which is of interest especially in paediatrics. 
Extrapolation from the adult experience together comparative PK data (TDF 300mg shows similar 
exposure in adolescents and in adults) support the extension of indication in adolescents. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The renal and bone toxicity are a source of particular concern for the long-term use of TDF. This is true 
Assessment report  
EMA/797673/2012  
Page 28/32
 
 
 
 
both for adults and for paediatric patients especially considering that they are in evolving modelling 
process. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The long-term effect of TDF on bone mineral acquisition during childhood and the potential reversibility 
of bone toxicity cannot be determined from the non clinical and clinical data available. However, it is 
acknowledged that given the lack of correlation between BMD and clinical events, it remains theoretical 
risk.  Moreover, the reversibility of the renal toxicity cannot be fully ascertained.  
Given the uncertainties related to the use of tenofovir in a population of active modelling process, the 
CHMP supports the use of tenofovir in the restricted population of treatment NRTI resistance or toxicity 
problems precluding the use of other first line agent’s population. 
Moreover, warnings were added to the SmPC to alert physicians on the uncertainties on the long term 
effect of bone and renal toxicity and the fact that reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully 
ascertained. A statement was introduced to promote a multidisciplinary management of paediatric 
patients to adequately weigh the need for treatment, to adequately settle the monitoring and to 
foresee the need for supplementation. Promoting multidisciplinary approach appears pragmatic based 
on the SAG input that management is to be tailored to the child and mostly refer to good clinical 
practice in paediatric.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Overall, and further to the SAG input, the CHMP considers that Viread can be approved for the use in 
adolescents provided the indication is targeted to patients with NRTI resistance or toxicity problems 
precluding the use of first line agents. 
The MAH should further document the reversibility of the renal toxicity. This included a review by the 
MAH of all protocols of on-going clinical trials to ensure that all cases of tubulopathy are properly 
followed up to assert reversibility. Furthermore the follow up of adverse reports of tubulopathy is 
enhanced by a targeted questionnaire for renal tubulopathy. This questionnaire aims to obtain 
reversibility data from post marketing reports of renal tubulopathy in the paediatric population. 
Further to the SAG input, the CHMP could foresee the use of Viread in adolescents with appropriate 
SmPC restrictions and additional pharmacovigilance activities as described above. 
Overall, the CHMP consider that given the lack of correlation between BMD decrease and clinical event, 
long term effect of bone and renal toxicity remains theoretical whereas there are established benefits 
in a population of paediatric patients in need of treatment. However, there are uncertainties that per 
se mandate special consideration on the use of tenofovir in a population of active modelling process. 
Therefore the CHMP endorses the use of tenofovir in the restricted population of adolescents with NRTI 
resistance or toxicity problems precluding the use of first line agents. 
The SmPC was revised to include warnings to alert physicians on the uncertainties on the long term 
effect of bone and renal toxicity and the fact that reversibility of renal toxicity cannot be fully 
ascertained. A statement was introduced to promote a multidisciplinary management of paediatric 
patients to adequately weigh the need for treatment, to adequately settle the monitoring and to 
foresee the need for supplementation. Promoting multidisciplinary approach appears pragmatic based 
on the SAG input that management is to be tailored to the paediatric patient and mostly refer to good 
clinical practice in paediatric. 
Further studies are included in the RMP that will help to better understand the safety in this population.

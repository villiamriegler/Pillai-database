The Olanzapine Integrated Database aimed at creating a 
sufficiently large database with maximum olanzapine 
exposure numbers in adults as possible, while maintaining 
the characteristics that would make the results of the 
studies consistent enough to be rationally combined for a 
robust analysis of safety. 
Following an analysis of safety data from the Olanzapine 
Integrated Database, the MAH proposed an update the 
Product information to include amnesia, epistaxis, 
abdominal distension, arthralgia, GGT high, uric acid high, 
pyrexia and dysarthria”, as new undesirable effects for 
Zyprexa, Zyprexa Velotab and Zypadhera and “injection 
site abscess and injection site pain” as new undesirable

(primarily extrapyramidal side effects and/or withdrawal 
effects). Whilst there is limited data available for some 
antipsychotics, this is likely to be a class effect. In addition 
to the inclusion of neonatal drug withdrawal syndrome as 
listed adverse reaction, section 4.6 of the SmPC and 
section 2 of the PL were updated in accordance with the 
PhVWP/CHMP class labelling recommended wording, as 
follows: 
SmpC: Neonates exposed to antipsychotics (including 
[olanzapine]) during the third trimester of pregnancy are at 
risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or 
withdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and 
duration following delivery. There have been reports of 
agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, 
respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. 
PL: The following symptoms may occur in newborn babies, 
of mothers that have used [olanzapine] in the last trimester 
(last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle 
stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing 
problems, and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops 
any of these symptoms you may need to contact your 
doctor.

- 
Simultaneous injection of intramuscular olanzapine 
and parenteral benzodiazepine is not recommended due to 
Page 11/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-

the potential for excessive sedation, cardiorespiratory 
depression and in very rare cases, death (see sections 4.5 
and 6.2). If the patient is considered to need parenteral 
benzodiazepine treatment, this should not be given until at 
least one hour after IM olanzapine administration. If the 
patient has received parenteral benzodiazepine, IM 
olanzapine administration should only be considered after 
careful evaluation of clinical status and the patient should 
be closely monitored for excessive sedation and 
cardiorespiratory depression. 
In addition, the CHMP recommended the deletion of the 
information in section 4.9 related to the management of 
oral overdose.

olanzapine provided by the MAH on sudden cardiac death, 
urinary incontinence and elevated plasma prolactin 
concentrations and related clinical manifestations, the 
CHMP considered that: 
- 
In postmarketing reports with olanzapine, the 
events of sudden cardiac death have been reported in 
patients with olanzapine.In a retrospective observational 
cohort study, the risk of presumed sudden cardiac death in 
patients treated with olanzapine was approximately twice 
the risk in patients not using antipsychotics. In the study, 
the risk of olanzapine was comparable to the risk of 
atypical antipsychotics included in a pooled analysis. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Subsequently, this information was reflected as a warning 
Package Leaflet 
in section 4.4. 
- 
Two apparently unconfounded serious case reports, 
and 13 serious case reports of urinary incontinence with a 
positive dechallenge were reported in PSUR 23. According 
to the current SPC, olanzapine exhibits a range of receptor 
affinities (Ki; < 100 nM) including ?1-adrenergic receptors.  
Page 14/31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore; in the clinical trial data (from adult placebo-
controlled database) the frequency of urinary incontinence 
with olanzapine was 0.3% (i.e., uncommon). Subsequently, 
urinary incontinence was added in section 4.8 as 
uncommon ADR. 
- 
In clinical trials of up to 12 weeks, plasma prolactin 
concentrations exceeded the upper limit of normal range in 
approximately 30% of olanzapine treated patients with 
normal baseline prolactin value. In the majority of these 
patients the elevations were generally mild, and remained 
below two times the upper limit of normal range. In 
patients with schizophrenia, mean prolactin level changes 
decreased with continued treatment, whereas mean 
increases were seen in patients with other diagnoses. The 
mean changes were modest. Generally in olanzapine-
treated patients potentially associated breast- and 
menstrual related clinical manifestations (e.g.

The CHMP recommended that the frequency of potentially

proportions of patients in each class (over 7%, over 15% 
and over 25% weight gain) in short term use (under 24 
weeks) and long term use (over 24 weeks), separately. In 
line with the CHMP's recommendations, the MAH updated 
footnotes 1 and 9 as follows: 
Adults 
Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all 
baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Following short 
term treatment (median duration 47 days), weight gain ? 
7% of baseline body weight  was very common (22.2%), ? 
15 % was common (4.2 %) and ? 25 % was uncommon 
(0.8 %). Patients gaining ? 7 %, ? 15 % and ? 25 % of 
their baseline body weight with long-term exposure (at 
least 48 weeks) were very common (64.4 %, 31.7 % and 
12.3 % respectively). 
Adolescents 
Following short term treatment (median duration 22 days), 
weight gain ? 7 % of baseline body weight (kg) was very 
common (40.6 %), ? 15 % of baseline body weight was 
common (7.1 %) and ? 25 % was common (2.5%). With 
long-term exposure (at least 24 weeks), 89.4 % gained ? 7

schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. The CHMP considered 
that there is a lack of data on efficacy and safety in these 
indications for the paediatric population. Nevertheless, the 
CHMP considered acceptable to reflect these available short 
-term results in section 5.1 of the SPC. With respect to 
safety, further concerns were raised in the paediatric 
population concerning weight gain, lipid and prolactin 
alterations, which have been reported with a greater 
magnitude as compared to the adult population. Sedation 
(including hypersomnia; lethargy, somnolence), increased 
appetite, dry mouth, elevated hepatic transaminases, GGT 
and decreased total bilirubin were also of concerns in this 
population. The CHMP considered acceptable to update 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC to reflect this new safety 
information. Furthermore, to emphasize on the safety 
concerns in this population, section 4.2 of the SPC has been 
updated accordingly.

body weight. The CHMP concluded that olanzapine was 
associated with a greater mean change in both fasting and 
non-fasting (random) glucose levels relative to placebo in 
the adult population. Furthermore, the incidence of 
treatment-emergent glycosuria was statistically

data from clinical trials and post-marketing experience 
showed an increased frequency of reported hyperglycemia 
(from very rare to rare). Concerning lipids levels, mean 
increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL 
cholesterol, and triglycerides) were greater in olanzapine 
treated patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at 
baseline. Concerning weight gain, clinically significant

Data was analyzed with an original data lock point of 30 
November 2004, followed by an update with a data lock 
point of 30 November 2005. Global post-marketing patient 
exposure to olanzapine was estimated to be approximately 
18,000,000 million. The MAH had received more than 
35,000 olanzapine post-marketing case reports with 
approximately 2,500 being considered hepatobiliary events 
after medical review. Cases were medically categorized and 
assessed with respect to several factors including medical 
history, concomitant medications, presence of risk factors 
or potential confounders and clinical outcome. Based on the 
review of these data, the CHMP considered the change of 
frequency for hepatitis (including hepatocellular, cholestatic 
or mixed liver injury) from 'very rare' to 'rare' undesirable 
effects to be acceptable. In addition, since hepatocellular 
reactions and increased transaminases have also been 
reported, the CHMP recommended inclusion of these terms 
in the SPC. The CHMP concluded that the update of 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC to include information on

liver injury), increased alkaline phosphatase, increased 
total bilirubin and increased transaminases to be acceptable

treated with placebo (3.5% vs. 1.5% , respectively). The 
higher incidence of death was not associated with 
olanzapine dose (mean daily dose 4.4 mg) or duration of 
treatment. Risk factors that may predispose this patient 
population to increased mortality include age >65 years, 
dysphagia, sedation, malnutrition and dehydration, 
pulmonary conditions (e.g., pneumonia, with or without 
aspiration), or concomitant use of benzodiazepines. 
However, the incidence of death was higher in olanzapine-
treated than in placebo-treated patients independent of 
these risk factors. Further, in the same clinical trials, 
cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAE e.g., stroke, 
transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were 
reported. There was a 3-fold increase in CVAE in patients 
treated with olanzapine compared to patients treated with 
placebo (1.3% vs. 0.4%, respectively). All olanzapine- and 
placebo-treated patients who experienced a 
cerebrovascular event had pre-existing risk factors. Age 
>75 years and vascular/mixed type dementia were 
identified as risk factors for CVAE in association with 
olanzapine treatment. The efficacy of olanzapine was not 
established in these trials. 
In section 4.8 of the SPC, it was inserted that in clinical 
trials in elderly patients with dementia, olanzapine 
treatment was associated with a higher incidence of death 
and cerebrovascular adverse events compared to placebo 
(see also section 4.4

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Claimed therapeutic indication: 
Orserdu is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal woman, and men, with hormone receptor 
(HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer who have progressed following at least one line of endocrine therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of cancer in women and the leading cause of cancer deaths in 
women (Bray et al, CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, 2018). The incidence and prevalence of 
patients with invasive breast cancer, as well as estimates for the prevalence of subjects with 
ER+/HER2- breast cancer, are presented in Table 1. 
Table 1 Epidemiology of ER+/HER2- Breast cancer (x 1,000)
For women diagnosed with early BC (EBC), the 5-year survival probability is 
96% in Europe. 
However, when metastatic BC (MBC) is diagnosed, the 5-year survival rate is in the range of 38% 
∼
(Allemani et al, Lancet, 2018). About 157,100 women were estimated to have died from breast cancer 
in the EU in 2020 (Ferlay et al, International Journal of Cancer, 2021). In terms of absolute numbers, 
MBC was still the leading cause of death from all cancers in women, accounting for 
3.6% of all deaths 
in women and 1.8% of all deaths in Europe in 2015 (Dafni et al, Breast Care, 2019). 
∼
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
BC is a heterogeneous disease comprising different subtypes, which can be identified through 
molecular biomarkers that also act as predictive factors. It is categorised into different histopathologic 
subtypes based on the expression of the oestrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR), and 
HER2 receptor overexpression or gene amplification1. Of the new cancers diagnosed worldwide each 
year, about 70%-80% are hormone receptor (HR)-positive (Joe et al, UpToDate, 2021). 
Assessment report

ER is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of oestrogen-responsive genes by binding to a 
specific DNA sequence found in their regulatory regions. Two major isoforms of the oestrogen receptor 
have been identified, ERα and ERβ: however, the role of ERβ in cancer remains unclear. The two 
isoforms are encoded by two genes located on different chromosomes (ESR1 on chromosome 6 and 
ESR2 on chromosome 14) and regulate different specific genes. Recent ASCO/College of American 
Pathologists guidelines still support the classification of ER+ breast cancer being > 1% by 
immunohistochemistry staining. Similar principles apply to PR testing, which is used primarily for 
prognostic purposes in the setting of an ER-positive cancer. HR+/HER2− breast cancer is characterized 
by hormone receptor positivity (> 1% IHC expression of the oestrogen receptor [ER] and/or 
progesterone receptor) and lack of HER2 expression (IHC score of 0, 1+, or 2+ confirmed as negative 
by  in situ hybridization [ISH]) (Allison et al., 2020, Wolff et al., 2018). Other therapeutically relevant 
biomarkers to be assessed include phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit 
alpha (PIK3CA) in ER/PR-positive, HER2-negative MBC. 
Endocrine therapy (ET) comprises different strategies as suppression of oestrogen production or 
directly targeting the oestrogen receptor (ER). Steroidal/nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AI, 
exemestane/letrozole and anastrozole and exemestane) exert their action by blocking androgen to 
oestrogen conversion, thus lowering the levels of circulating oestradiol (E2) and, therefore, reducing 
the activation of ER. Direct targeting of ERα is achieved by selective oestrogen receptor modulator 
(SERM) (e.g., tamoxifen) and selective oestrogen receptor degrader (SERD) (e.g., fulvestrant). SERMs 
compete with oestrogen for ER binding and show mixed agonist/antagonist capabilities in a tissue-
specific fashion. Meanwhile, SERDs create an unstable protein complex that induces ER protein 
degradation via the proteasome.  
Several mechanisms regarding ER have been considered to drive resistance to anticancer drugs. Within 
these, alterations in ESR1 are some of the most well-established and the main subject of interest to 
this date. ESR1 mutations are characteristically more frequent in advanced disease, after endocrine 
therapy and mostly AI, rather than in primary BC. Mutations in ESR1 are found in the ligand-binding 
domain (LBD), favouring constitutive ER activation independent from oestrogen and resistance to AIs. 
However, ESR1 mutated tumours can still present sensitivity to tamoxifen or fulvestrant. Mutations in 
Y537S and D538G are the most frequently described mutations. All ESR1 LBD mutations cause 
complete AI resistance; however, preclinical studies indicate Y537S has the highest transactivation 
activity and the greatest relative resistance to tamoxifen, fulvestrant, and some of the novel SERDs 
and SERMs. In addition, Y537S-specific ESR1 mutations are reported as drivers of resistance to 
fulvestrant plus palbociclib combination therapy (O’Leary et al, Cancer Discovery, 2018; Dustin et al, 
Cancer, 2019; Hernando et al, International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 2021; Jeselsohn et al, 
Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology, 2015). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The diagnosis of breast cancer is based on clinical examination in combination with imaging and 
confirmed by pathological assessment. Disease stage is assessed according to the Tumour, Node, 
Metastasis (TNM) system.  
A number of previous studies on patients with MBC have demonstrated that compared with wild-type 
ESR1, ESR1 mutation led to worse progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) 
(Chandarlapaty et al, Oncotarget, 2016). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 11/197  
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.5.  Management 
The aim of treatment is to increase PFS and OS. Key clinical factors to consider when determining the 
choice for systemic treatment for women are (1) pre- versus postmenopausal status at the time of 
presentation, (2) de novo metastatic versus recurrence, (3) disease-free interval and type of adjuvant 
therapy, (4) tumour burden including bone-only versus visceral disease, (5) performance status and 
medical comorbidities, and (6) for patients who have progressed on frontline treatment to consider the 
previous treatments they received and the response, duration of response, and tolerability to those 
previous therapies (Andrew et al, JCO Oncology Practice, 2021).  
The current first-line standard of care (SOC) for locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast 
cancer is endocrine therapy, with either aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant, plus a cyclin-dependent 
kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor (palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib).  
The optimal sequence of endocrine-based therapy is uncertain after progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors 
and limited data is available post-CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment.  
Treatment guidelines, when the pivotal (RAD1901-308) trial was initiated in 2018 and still currently, 
recommend the use of sequential endocrine therapy in the absence of visceral crisis until all endocrine 
therapy options have been exhausted (NCCN, 2018; NCCN, 2022; Gennari et al, Annals of Oncology, 
2021). Endocrine therapy includes endocrine monotherapy, such as fulvestrant or aromatase inhibitors, 
depending on the first-line therapy applied (NCCN, 2021; Burnstein et al, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 
2021; Gennari et al, Annals of Oncology, 2021). Available 2nd line combination therapy options are 
everolimus + exemestane (median PFS 7.8 months) (BOLERO-2; Yardley et al., 2013) and everolimus 
+fulvestrant/tamoxifen.  
For subjects with PIK3CA-mutant breast cancer, the combination of fulvestrant and alpelisib is another 
option (median PFS 11.0 month and median OS 39.3 months), (Andre et al., 2020). PARP inhibitor 
monotherapy (olaparib or talazoparib) have been proposed to be considered for patients with germline 
pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations and as an option for those with somatic pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
BRCA1/2 or germline PALB2 mutations (Gennari et al, Annals of Oncology, 2021). Overall, ESMO 
guideline recommends using at least two lines of endocrine-based therapy before moving to 
chemotherapy. In patients with high disease burden and upcoming organ failure, chemotherapy is a 
preferred option. 
To overcome the issues of an intramuscular administration route, several oral SERDs, besides 
elacestrant, are in development investigating both monotherapy and combination with CDK4/6 
inhibitors (Downton et al, Drug Design, Development and Therapy, 2022). At ESMO 2022, mixed 
results were presented for two of these SERDs in advanced BC.  
2.2.  About the product 
Elacestrant, a tetrahydronaphthalene compound, is a potent, selective and orally active oestrogen 
receptor-α (ERα) antagonist and degrader. Elacestrant inhibits the oestradiol-dependent and 
independent growth of ERα-positive breast cancer cells, including models harbouring oestrogen 
receptor 1 (ESR1) gene mutations. Elacestrant displayed potent antitumour activity in patient derived 
xenograft models previously exposed to multiple endocrine therapies, harbouring wild type ESR1 or 
ESR1 gene mutations in the ligand binding domain. (See SmPC section 5.1).  
The claimed indication for Orserdu was: Orserdu monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of 
postmenopausal woman, and men, with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth

factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, advanced or metastatic breast cancer with an ESR1 mutation who 
have progressed following at least one line of endocrine therapy. 
Following recommendation by the CHMP the applicant agreed to a revised indication wording: Orserdu 
monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with oestrogen 
receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with an activating 
ESR1 mutation who have disease progression following at least one line of endocrine therapy including 
a CDK4/6 inhibitor. (See SmPC section 4.1). 
Treatment with ORSERDU should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
therapies. 
Patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer should be selected for treatment with 
ORSERDU based on the presence of an activating ESR1 mutation in plasma specimens, using a CE 
marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) with the corresponding intended purpose. If the CE-marked IVD is not 
available, the presence of an activating ESR1 mutation in plasma specimens should be assessed by an 
alternative validated test.  
The recommended dosage is 345 mg (one 345 mg film-coated tablet) taken orally, once daily, with 
food. The maximum recommended daily dose of ORSERDU is 345 mg. A dose reduction is allowed in 
case of adverse reactions to 258 mg once daily. (See SmPC section 4.2 and see 2.6.9. ). If further 
dose reduction below 258 mg once daily is required, the treatment should be discontinued.  
Treatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
(See SmPC section 4.2). If a dose is missed, it can be taken immediately within 6 hours after the time 
it is usually taken. After more than 6 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. On the next day, 
ORSERDU should be taken at the usual time.  
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
Several PK studies have been performed in healthy men and postmenopausal women and in 
postmenopausal women and men with mBC. Initially, a single-arm phase 2 study with ORR as primary 
endpoint, was proposed at Scientific Advice, as the single pivotal study for future MAA in the proposed 
target population. The CHMP did not agree that this single arm study would define clinical benefit and a 
positive B/R in the absence of an active comparator given established treatment options. Based on the 
SA, the applicant revised their intended clinical strategy. The clinical development programme in 
support of the proposed indication concerns three clinical studies; 2 phase 1 studies in postmenopausal 
women with pretreated ER+/HER2-advanced or mBC (Rad1901-005 and RAD1901-106) in support of 
the recommended dose of 400 mg QD and one phase 3 RCT (RAD1901-308) in the proposed 
indication.  
The study considered to be key to the proposed indication is study RAD1901-308 (hereafter referred to 
as study 308), a phase 3 randomized, open-label study comparing elacestrant versus standard of care 
(SOC, fulvestrant or aromatase inhibitor (AI)) in postmenopausal women and men with advanced or 
metastatic ER+/HER2-breast cancer.  
Of note, at scientific advice, the applicant was encouraged to study PK in patients with impaired renal 
GFR below 60 ml/min) and hepatic function (mild ALT, AST and bilirubin elevation), as this would need 
to be addressed at the time of an MAA.

The product is available in alu-alu blisters as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.4.2.  Active substance: elacestrant dihydrochloride 
General information 
The chemical name of elacestrant dihydrochloride is ((6R)-6-(2-(N-(4-(2-(ethylamino)ethyl)benzyl)-N-
ethylamino)-4-methoxyphenyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol dihydrochloride) corresponding to 
the molecular formula C30H38N2O2 (· 2HCl). It has a relative molecular mass of 531.56 and the 
following structure: 
Figure 1: Elacestrant dihydrochloride structure 
The chemical structure of elacestrant dihydrochloride was elucidated by a combination of infrared 
spectroscopy (IR), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance 
(13C NMR), low-resolution mass spectrometry (MS), UV spectroscopy, elemental analysis and single-
crystal X-ray crystallography. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by X-
ray powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and optical rotation. 
Elacestrant dihydrochloride is a white to off-white to grey solid soluble in acidic aqueous medium, 
forms a suspension in most organic solvents and it is non-hygroscopic.   
Elacestrant dihydrochloride exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centres. The 
proposed active substance has the R-absolute configuration. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely. 
Polymorphism has been observed for elacestrant dihydrochloride.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Elacestrant dihydrochloride is synthesized in seven main steps using well defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications. The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of 
conventional univariate studies and elements of QbD such as risk assessment. The critical quality 
attributes (CQAs) were identified.  
A risk analysis was performed in order to define critical process steps and process parameters that 
may have an influence on the on the active substance CQAs. Proven acceptable ranges (PARs) have 
been defined for the manufacture of the active substance. The available development data, the 
proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the 
proposed PARs. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis.  
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have 
been presented, updated during the procedure and they are now considered acceptable. 
The synthetic route to elacestrant dihydrochloride was developed by one manufacturer and optimised 
by the manufacturer proposed for marketing. A comparability of batch analysis data demonstrates that 
the final active substance is comparable across the processes. Changes introduced have been 
presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the 
various phases of the development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed 
commercial process. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development programme.  
The active substance is packaged in double LDPE bags which complies with Commission Regulation (EU) 
10/2011, as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual examination), identification 
(FTIR, HPLC and XPRD for the polymorphic form), assay (anhydrous and dry basis, by HPLC), organic 
impurities (HPLC), S-Enantiomer (HPLC),  water content (Ph. Eur.), Residue on ignition (Ph. Eur. 
2.4.14), Particle size distribution (Laser light scattering), chloride content (ion chromatography), acetic 
acid content (HPLC), residual solvents (gas chromatography), elemental impurities (ICP-MS) and 
microbiological evaluation (Ph. Eur.). 
Although batch data for ‘assay on anhydrous basis’ would support a tighter limit than the proposed 
one, in view of the limited amount of produced batches up to now, it can be accepted as the additional 
parameter ‘assay on dried basis’ has been added to the specification.  
Based on batch data, the following limits have been lowered: total impurities, S-enantiomer, chloride 
content, water content and boron.

Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
With regard to potentially genotoxic impurities, although elacestrant dihydrochloride is intended for an 
advanced cancer indication and falls under the scope of ICH S9, ICH M7 has been considered and a 
toxicological assessment has been performed in silico for all impurities. Two impurities have been 
identified as potentially genotoxic and are adequately controlled.  
All residual solvents used in the active substance manufacturing process are listed in the active 
substance specification have been tested in eight registration batches. Since several solvents may 
contain Class 1 solvents, their absence has been shown on three consecutive industrial scale batches 
of the active substance or intermediate. Genotoxicity of solvents and reagents has also been 
adequately addressed. 
The inorganic impurities and the elemental impurities are adequately controlled in the final active 
substance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data three full-scale commercial batches of the active substance, manufactured by the 
proposed finished product manufacturer, together with eighth pilot manufactured by the proposed 
finished product manufacturer and 8 pilot batches manufactured by the previous manufacturer and 
used during the clinical trials are provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent from 
batch to batch. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has 
been presented. 
Stability 
Stability data from 8 pilot scale batches (>10% of the commercial batch scale) of active substance 
from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under 
long term (25ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
parameters tested are appearance, polymorphic identity, assay, drug related impurities, chiral purity, 
water content and microbial quality attributes, in line with the methods indicated in the Specification 
section. Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on samples of the active 
substance. Samples of the active substance were also subjected to stress conditions of 50°C for up to 
1 week. All tested parameters were within the specifications. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months without special 
storage conditions in the proposed container.

The solubility of active substance at various pH has been properly investigated and discussed. All 
excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality, or the quality of their individual 
components, for microcrystalline cellulose (NF) and Opadry coating (in-house), is compliant with Ph. 
Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Compatibility 
of drug substance and excipients has been shown. 
It has been shown that storage of the active substance and manufacturing / storage of the finished 
product do not affect the polymorphic form and that there is no relevant change in stereochemistry. 
The impact of active substance particle size on dissolution has been adequately investigated.  
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. The quality target product 
profile is summarised in Table 5 below. 
Table 5: QTPP of the finished product 
The critical quality attributes identified were: appearance, identification, assay, related substances, 
uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, water content, microbial limits. The formulation and 
manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk assessment and design of 
experiments to identify the critical product quality attributes and critical process parameters. A risk

analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to define 
excipients levels, critical process steps and process parameters that may have an influence on the 
finished product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of products 
with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from formulation 
development, process design and scale-up studies.  Appropriate blend uniformity as well as ranges for 
critical excipients and process parameters for granulation and compression has also been shown. The 
critical process parameters for blending, roller compaction and compression unit operations have been 
adequately identified.  
An immediate release (IR) film-coated tablet formulation of elacestrant dihydrochloride was developed 
and used for clinical trials. The manufacturing method consists of manufacture of common blend, 
compression, coating and packaging.  The roller compaction in the final blend process is designed to 
enhance blend flowability while maintaining its compatibility for high-speed tablet compression. 
Subsequently, the formulation was optimised for producing large scale registration and commercial 
batches, however the manufacturing process and unit operations remained the same as for all clinical 
batches.  
Acceptability of the formulation and packaging for the older population is discussed in line with the 
reflection paper. Enteral feeding tubes administration is not foreseen. An open dish study was 
performed to support the stability of the product when stored in caddies. 
Storage of bulk product (film-coated tablets) is proposed for 12 months at 15° - 25°C, which is 
sufficiently supported by data.  
The development of QC dissolution method has been described in detail. Dissolution medium, volume 
and stirrer speed were discussed and justified. The discriminatory power of the chosen QC dissolution 
method has been demonstrated; in fact, the method is over discriminatory when compared to in vivo 
data.  
The primary packaging is alu - alu blisters. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EU regulations 
10/2011. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: manufacture of common blend (pre-compaction 
blending,  roller  compaction,  and  final  blending),  compression  (tableting),  coating  and  packaging.  The 
process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Roller compaction and compression have been identified as critical steps. Both are appropriately 
controlled. Process parameter ranges are in line with the control strategy based on manufacturing 
process development.  
Bulk product (film-coated tablets) may be stored for up to 12 months. Storage conditions and 
description on bulk product packaging are presented. Major steps of the manufacturing process have 
been validated by a number of studies.  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls have been justified and reviewed 
during the procedure; they are now considered as adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
A process validation protocol has been submitted and validation will be performed prior to marketing of 
batches. Taking into account the extensive development data presented and that the finished product 
is manufactured according to a standard process, this approach is considered adequate.

Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (visual examination), identification (UV and HPLC), assay and related substances (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution (Ph. Eur., HPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), microbial 
limits (Ph. Eur.) and specified microorganisms. 
Release and shelf-life specification have been provided and meet Ph. Eur. and guidance requirements. 
The specification limits are based on applicable regulatory guidance and batch data, including clinical 
batch data. The specifications are now considered satisfactory.   
One specified impurity was identified; it is a potential degradation product arising from the oxidation of 
the active substance. 
Since polymorphic form and chiral purity/S-enantiomer content do not change during the manufacture 
and storage of the finished product, and are controlled at the level of the active substance, the 
absence of these tests form the finished product specification is accepted. 
Except for water, no organic solvents are used in the manufacture of elacestrant tablets. The residual 
solvent content of active substance is controlled at release. A risk assessment was conducted on the 
potential residual solvents content in the finished product by evaluating the manufacture process and 
the potential residual solvents present in all excipients. Both strengths of the drug product meet the 
ICH Q3C requirements. Therefore, no residual solvent testing is required. 
The dissolution limit for both strengths has been justified and is considered acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on three batches using a validated ICP-MS method were provided, demonstrating that each relevant 
elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided and considering that the finished product falls in the scope of ICH S9, and hence 
nitrosamines should be controlled in line with ICH Q3B, it is accepted that the risk of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product is negligeable. Therefore, no specific 
control measures are deemed necessary. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three full-scale batches of each strength, confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.

Stability of the product 
Stability data from three full-scale batches of each strength of finished product stored for up to 9 
months under long term (25ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate (30ºC / 75% RH) conditions for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of finished product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in 
the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Supportive stability data from three full-scale batches of each strength of finished product stored for 
up to 12 months under long term (25ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate (30ºC / 75% RH) conditions for 
up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The batches of finished product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in in HDPE bottles, which can be considered worst case compared to alu-alu blisters. 
Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, water content, assay, related substances and 
microbial limits in line with the shelf-life specifications. All results comply with the corresponding limits 
and no relevant trend is observed at any tested condition. The analytical procedures used were 
demonstrated to be stability indicating during validation.  
In addition, one full-scale batch per strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The data confirm that the unpacked finished 
product is stable to light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without specific storage conditions, 
as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4), are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
All pivotal non-clinical studies relevant for the non-clinical safety assessment of elacestrant (safety 
pharmacology studies to assess the cardiovascular system in vitro and in vivo (in cynomolgus 
monkeys), central nervous system and respiratory function in rats, pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies, 
genotoxicity studies, embryo-foetal development in rats, local tolerance, and in vitro phototoxicity) 
were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) principles. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
In vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the binding affinity of elacestrant for ERα, the antagonism 
of the effects induced by oestradiol (E2), and the ability of elacestrant to down-regulate and degrade 
ERα. The in vitro antiproliferative activity of elacestrant against several ER-positive breast cancer cell 
lines and the antitumour activity of elacestrant in breast cancer xenograft mouse models were 
evaluated. These studies included the use of breast cancer cells, insensitive to fulvestrant and CDK4/6 
inhibitors, and of cells harbouring mutations in ESR1. The enantiomer S-1901 was used as a 
comparator in several of the in vitro studies, and fulvestrant was used as a comparator in the 
xenograft models because it is currently the only drug endowed with SERD properties approved for the 
treatment of ER-positive advanced breast cancer. Additionally, elacestrant antitumour activity was 
compared with selective ER modulators, CDK4/6 inhibitors, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, 
and a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor. 
The potential off-target activity of elacestrant was evaluated against a panel of 166 molecular targets 
and further in cell-based assays for activity at cannabinoid receptor type 1 and 2 (CNR1 and CNR2, 
respectively) and adrenergic receptor α2a (ADRA2A). Additional secondary pharmacology studies 
investigated the uterotrophic effects of elacestrant in immature mice and rats, the ability of elacestrant 
to regulate luteinizing hormone (LH) release and prevent bone loss in ovariectomized rat models, and 
the efficacy of elacestrant in a rat model of vasomotor instability. 
In vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies were performed to assess cardiac, respiratory, and 
neurological effects of elacestrant. Other safety pharmacology studies investigated the effects of 
elacestrant on bleeding time, wound healing, and the gastrointestinal system. 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Elacestrant as an oestrogen receptor binder 
The binding modality of elacestrant to ERα was resolved by X-ray crystallography and showed a unique 
pattern of interaction as compared to other compounds of the same pharmacological class. Elacestrant 
maintained hydrophobic interactions in the core and took a vector close to the H11 and the H11-12 
loop. The H12 conformation governs agonist and antagonist activities, and molecules that perturb the 
H11-12 loop or H12 directly have selective oestrogen receptor degrader (SERD) activity. When 
compared to the binding of other SERDs and selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), 
elacestrant displayed a particular pattern of molecular interactions with the WT ERα ligand binding 
domain (LBD) (Chinnasamy et al 2020, Report 19RAD221). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 22/197  
 
 
 
 
Elacestrant as an oestrogen receptor antagonist 
Elacestrant (RAD-1901) bound with high affinity to ERα with an IC50 of 48 nM and S
1901 bound with 
lower affinity for ERα with an IC50 of 108 nM. The E2 control had an IC50 of 0.4 nM. Both Elacestrant 
and S-1901 also bound to ERβ, although with lower affinity (IC50 of 870 and 940 nM, respectively) 
than to ERα. This study showed that elacestrant was a selective ligand for ERα. Elacestrant itself (1pM-
10uM) did not stimulate proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Co-treatment of these cells with both elacestrant 
and E2 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease of E2-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells, with 
IC50 values for elacestrant of 4.2 nM (E2 concentration at 0.01 nM) and 27 nM (E2 concentration at 
0.1 nM), respectively. S-1901 possesses the same qualities albeit at higher IC50. In SKBR3 cells 
transiently transfected with human ERα and ERβ, elacestrant effectively inhibits E2
dependent 
activation of an oestrogen response element (ERE)
luciferase reporter by either isoform, being a more 
potent inhibitor of ERα than of ERβ (100-fold), displaying nanomolar potency. Data from these studies 
‑
showed that elacestrant was a potent ER antagonist (Studies Rad-001, Rad-002 and Wardell et al 
‑
‑
2015a). 
Elacestrant as an oestrogen receptor degrader 
The decrease in ERα protein levels following elacestrant treatment in MCF-7 cell lines was further 
showed in a study by Wardell et al 2015a. Based on this study, treatment of MCF-7 cells with 
elacestrant (10 pM to 10 μM) for 24 hours produced a concentration-dependent decrease of ERα 
protein, with effects observed in the low nanomolar range. Furthermore, the addition of proteasome 
inhibitor MG132 restored the ERα protein to levels comparable to that in vehicle-treated MCF-7 cells, 
suggesting that elacestrant-induced decrease in ERα protein was proteasome ubiquitin-mediated. In a 
Duo Set ERα assay, elacestrant produced a concentration-dependent reduction in ERα protein levels in 
MCF-7 and T47D (luminal A subtype) cell lines with an EC50 (normalized to DMSO treatment) for 
elacestrant of 0.6 nM in MCF-7 cells and 76 nM in T47D cells (test range of 0.5 nM to 10 μM, 48 
hours). In contrast to MCF-7 and T47D, ERα protein level was slightly increased in the BT474 (luminal 
B subtype) cell line (140% at 10 μM) treated with elacestrant, which could be related to the high level 
of ER-c-Src-HER2 complex formation in this cell line, which hinders the binding of the compound to the 
LBD of ERα.  
When MCF-7 cells were incubated with elacestrant (10 pM to 10 μM) for 24 hours, this resulted in a 
concentration-dependent decrease of ERα protein (effects observed already at low nanomolar range), 
which was counteracted by incubation with proteasome inhibitor MG132. These data suggest that 
elacestrant-induced decrease in ERα protein was proteasome ubiquitin-mediated. 
In addition, treatment of MCF-7, T47D, and also HCC1428 cells with elacestrant (1 nM to 1 μM for 48 
hours) led to a reduction in ER protein levels (evaluated through Western blotting) in a concentration-
dependent manner. However, ER levels were lower upon fulvestrant incubation compared to 
elacestrant binding suggesting that fulvestrant is about 10- to 100-fold more effective at ER 
degradation. The IC50 of fulvestrant for growth inhibition in MCF-7 was 0.8 nM. This was lower than 
the IC50 of elacestrant for growth inhibition in MCF-7. The latter was 4.2 nM with and 5.6 nM without 
E2, respectively, suggesting that the potency of elacestrant was 10-fold lower than potency of 
fulvestrant (Nukatsuka et al, 2019) (Reports STC-RAD-02, 16RAD203, 16RAD209, 16RAD210 and 
Wardell et al 2015a). 
Anti-tumour activity 
Anti-tumour Activity in In vitro Models 
Elacestrant was evaluated for anti-tumour activity in several in vitro ER
positive breast cancer models. 
Antiproliferative effects of elacestrant were evaluated in MCF
17RAD2022, RAD-002, 18RAD2023, and 19RAD2034).

MCF-7 cells treated with E2 showed a dose-dependent increase in proliferation, with an EC50 of 0.004 
nM. MCF-7 cells treated with 10, 100, or 1000 nM elacestrant decreased basal rates of cell 
proliferation, with an IC50 of 5.6 nM. Co-treatment of cells with elacestrant and E2 resulted in a dose-
dependent decrease in E2-induced proliferation, with IC50 values for elacestrant of 4.2 and 27 nM, in 
the presence of 0.01 and 0.1 nM E2, respectively. Similarly, treatment of MCF-7 cells with S-1901 
decreased basal rates of cell proliferation, but with an IC50 of 99 nM in the absence of E2 and IC50 of 
120 and 820 nM in the presence of 0.01 or 0.1 nM E2, respectively. Thus, in the presence of E2, 300-
400 higher levels of elacestrant are required to obtain 50% ERα inhibition. Both elacestrant and S-
1901 with or without E2 were not able to stimulate MCF-7 proliferation at any dose (report RAD-002).

To investigate the antiproliferative effects of elacestrant in models that mimic post-aromatase inhibitor 
(AI) and post-AI-CDK4/6 inhibitor settings, an ER-positive cell line was oestrogen
deprived long term 
(HCC1428-LTED) to model progression on AIs. In addition, a palbociclib
resistant derivative of the cells 
(HCC1428-LTED-palboR) was developed by propagating HCC1428
months) in the presence of increasing concentrations of palbociclib (up to 500 nM) to model 
progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors. Elacestrant (incubated for 7 days up to 1000 nM) inhibited the

growth of palbociclib-sensitive (HCC1428-LTED) and palbociclib

The antiproliferative effects of elacestrant were also investigated in models that represent ESR1 wild 
type (HCC1428-long-term oestradiol deprivation [LTED]) and ESR1 mutant (MCF7-Y537S and MCF7-
D538G) CDK4/6iR cells. CDKiR derivatives of the cells were developed by propagating the cells long 
term (7 to 10 months) in the presence of increasing concentrations of CDK4/6 inhibitors (up to 
1,000 nM) to model progression on CDK inhibitors, palbociclib (Palbo), ribociclib (Ribo), and 
abemaciclib (Abema). Cells were incubated with CDK inhibitors and elacestrant for 7 days and assayed 
using the Cell Titer-Glo assay using luminescence as read-out. IC50 values for CDK4/6 inhibitors were 
significantly increased in CDK4/6iR cells compared to their parental CDK4/6iS cells. However, the 
extent of growth inhibition (which was partial) and potency of elacestrant was similar in the CDK4/6iS 
and the CDK4/6iR cells, which was also confirmed by Western blot analysis that measured similar 
reduction in expression of ERα by elacestrant in CDK4/6iS and CDK4/6iR cells (Report 17RAD2022).

In another study (19RAD2034), patient populations with mutant ER which is AI-resistant were 
mimicked by ER
positive cell lines (MCF-7) that were engineered to express mutant ESR1Y537S and 
ESR1D538G to model progression on AIs. Additionally, an ER
positive cell line harbouring wild-type ER 
‑
(HCC1428) was oestrogen deprived long-term (HCC1428-LTED) to model progression on AIs. 
‑
CDK4/6iR derivatives of the cells were also developed by propagating the cells long-term (7 to 10 
months) in the presence of increasing concentrations of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Elacestrant partially 
inhibited the growth of HCC1428-LTED, MCF7
Y537S, and MCF7-D538G cells, which proliferated in the 
absence of oestrogen. Palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib did not inhibit colony formation of their 
‑
respective CDK4/6iR cell lines. However, elacestrant (300 nM) inhibited colony formation of both 
CDK4/6iS and CDK4/6iR breast cancer cells when compared to vehicle control-treated cells. The 
growth inhibitory effect observed was independent of ESR1 status (wild
type or mutant) and the 
CDK4/6 inhibitor used to develop resistance (Report 19RAD2034).

In vivo Models  
Elacestrant was evaluated for anti-tumour activity in several in vivo ER
positive breast cancer models. 
Tumour growth inhibition by elacestrant was assessed in an oestrogen responsive MCF
7 human breast 
carcinoma (Reports 15RAD246, 14RAD028, 14RAD019, and 15RAD219) and multiple nude mouse PDX 
models, using cells insensitive to fulvestrant and CDK4/6 inhibitors and cells harbouring mutations in

ESR1 gene (Reports 16RAD240, 16RAD227, 18RAD217, 17RAD211, 18RAD203, 15RAD205,

MCF-7 xenografted tumour models

In study 15RAD246 female Balb/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously with MCF-7 tumour cells (10 × 
106). Three days prior to cell inoculation, E2 (0.18 mg) pellets were implanted subcutaneously to 
stimulate tumour growth. Once tumours reached a volume of approximately 145 mm3, mice were 
treated with 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg elacestrant, which resulted in significant anti-tumour activity with 
Assessment report

Page 28/197  
 
 
 
 
 
 
tumour growth inhibition (TGIs) of 100.5%, 103.4%, and 103.6% on Day 28, respectively. In the mice 
that survived until 56 days, mean tumour size was 92.3%, 91.4%, and 93.4% smaller, respectively, 
on Day 28, and 95.2%, 95.8%, and 96.0% smaller, respectively, on Day 56. Similar anti-tumour 
activity was shown for the positive controls, i.e., the bazedoxifene and fulvestrant treatment groups.  
In study 15RAD219 female Balb/c nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with MCF-7 tumour cells 
(10 × 106). Three days prior to cell inoculation, E2 (0.18 mg) pellets were implanted subcutaneously to 
stimulate tumour growth. Seven days after tumour cell implantation, the average tumour size was 194 
mm3. Significant dose-dependent anti-tumour activity on Day 27 was observed in mice treated with 
elacestrant at 30 and 60 mg/kg with mean tumour volumes of 226 mm3 (TGI = 96%) and 168 mm3 
(TGI = 103%) and as well in mice treated with fulvestrant, Palbociclib induced TGIs of 66%, 66%, and 
64%, respectively. When compared with 30 mg/kg elacestrant alone, the combination of 30 mg/kg 
elacestrant + 45 mg/kg palbociclib produced better anti-tumour efficacy (TGI = 113% [p < 0.05]), but 
30 mg/kg elacestrant + 2.5 mg/kg everolimus did not. When compared with 60 mg/kg elacestrant 
single-agent treatment, both 60 mg/kg elacestrant + 45 mg/kg palbociclib and 60 mg/kg elacestrant + 
2.5 mg/kg everolimus combinations produced better anti-tumour efficacy (TGI = 116% [p < 0.05] and 
TGI = 115% [p < 0.05], respectively). 
In study 14RAD028, female athymic nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with MCF-7 tumour 
cells and E2 (0.36 mg) pellets were implanted subcutaneously to stimulate tumour growth. In MCF-7 
tumour-bearing mice treated with elacestrant at 30 and 60 mg/kg, significant anti-tumour activity was 
reported with TGIs of 66% and 88% on Day 40, respectively. Similar anti-tumour activity was also 
observed in tamoxifen and fulvestrant treatment groups. 
In study 14RAD019, female athymic nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with MCF-7 tumour 
cells and E2 (0.36 mg) pellets were implanted subcutaneously to stimulate tumour growth. For MCF-7 
tumour-bearing mice treated with elacestrant at 60, 90, and 120 mg/kg, significant anti-tumour 
activity was reported with TGIs of 94%, 97%, and 96% on Day 42, respectively. Significant anti-
tumour activity was also observed in tamoxifen and fulvestrant treatment groups. Partial regressions 
were observed in mice that received elacestrant (60, 90, and 120 mg/kg), tamoxifen, and fulvestrant. 
To study the potential ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, an MCF-7 intracranial tumour xenograft 
model was used (Garner et al 2015). Survival was the primary endpoint to evaluate antitumour 
activity.  Female athymic nude mice were implanted intracranially with MCF-7 tumour cells (1 × 106) 
accompanied by subcutaneously implanted E2 (0.36 mg) pellets (to stimulate tumour growth). Five 
days post tumour cell implantation, animals were treated with 120 mg/kg/day elacestrant orally or 0.5 
mg/day fulvestrant subcutaneously for 54 days. In this orthotropic model, E2-dependent breast cancer 
cells (MCF
7) implanted into the brain led to rapid tumour growth and high mortality in untreated 
animals. Elacestrant resulted in anti-tumour activity and prolonged survival while fulvestrant, an agent 
known to be ineffective at crossing the blood
brain barrier, had a limited effect in reducing mortality.

Patient derived xenograft (PDX) models 
‑
The anti-tumour effect of elacestrant was evaluated in multiple nude mouse PDX models, using cells 
insensitive to fulvestrant and CDK4/6 inhibitors and cells harbouring mutations in ESR1 gene (Reports 
16RAD240, 16RAD227, 18RAD217, 17RAD211, 18RAD203, 15RAD205, 18RAD202, 17RAD208, 
16RAD225-2, and 16RAD225

In study 16RAD240, female athymic nude mice, implanted with tumour fragments from ST941/HI 
‑
harvested from host animals, were treated with elacestrant at 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg for 62 days. 
Significant anti-tumour activity was reported with TGIs of 72%, 84%, and 93% on Day 26 (max.

tumour size was reached in untreated mice), respectively. Fulvestrant treatment did not result in 
significant anti-tumour activity relative to the vehicle control.  
In Study 16RAD227, female athymic nude mice, implanted with tumour fragments from ST941/HI 
harvested from host animals, were treated with at 10 and 30 mg/kg elacestrant for 60 days. 
Significant anti-tumour activity was reported with TGIs of 73% and 101% on Day 39, respectively. 
Ribociclib displayed a limited effect in this model, and alpelisib treatment did not result in significant 
anti-tumour activity relative to the vehicle control. Partial regressions were observed in 3 mice that 
received elacestrant (30 mg/kg) and in 1 mouse treated with alpelisib.  
In study 18RAD217, OVX immune-deficient female mice (Report 18RAD217) inoculated with tumour 
fragments from ST941/HI/FSR/PBR (18RAD217), functioning as a re-derived hormone-independent 
(HI) START PDX model representing human ER+, ESR1 mutant breast cancer, were evaluated for anti-
tumour effect of elacestrant alone (30 mg/kg) and a combination of Palbociclib (30mg/kg) and 
fulvestrant (5 mg/kg). All agents were tolerated at the dose levels used, and elacestrant was active 
towards the ST941/HI/FSR/PBR model in OVX female nude mice and seems more effective as 
compared to combination treatment of Palbociclib and fulvestrant (TGI of 74 % vs 24%).  
In study 18RAD203, female athymic nude mice were implanted with tumour fragments from 
ST2535/HI (START PDX model designated ST2535/HI) representing human ER
positive ESR1 mutant 
(ESR1D538G) breast cancer. Significant anti-tumour activity was reported with TGIs of 88% and 91% 
‑
on Day 60, respectively. Fulvestrant (5 mg/dose) treatment also resulted in TGI of 44%. In study 
17RAD211, using the same model, following 37 days of treatment with elacestrant 30 and 60 mg/kg, a 
TGI of 87 and 100% was shown, respectively and the tumours did not re-grow until 3 weeks after 
dosing was terminated. 
In study 15RAD205, a PDX model using female athymic nude mice were implanted with tumour 
fragments from ST986 or ST2177 harvested from host animals. ST986 expresses wild-type ER and 
progesterone receptor, and ST2177 harbours a Y537S mutation in the ESR1 gene (the most frequently 
reported aberrations found in tumours from patients treated with AIs also resulting in high levels of 
constitutive ER signalling). Upon elacestrant at 30, 60, and 120 mg/kg, significant anti-tumour activity 
was reported in both models up to Day 61. Fulvestrant treatment resulted in significant anti-tumour 
activity in both models at a dose of 5 mg (TGI: 104 %), but was inactive in ST986 tumour-bearing 
mice at a dose of 1 mg. In ST2177 tumour-bearing mice, tamoxifen showed significant anti-tumour 
activity (TGI: 105%). Partial regressions were observed in ST986 tumour-bearing mice that received 
elacestrant (30, 60, and 120 mg/kg) and fulvestrant (5 mg/dose) and in ST2177 and ST986 tumour-
bearing mice that received elacestrant (60 and 120 mg/kg) and tamoxifen. Elacestrant was well 
tolerated at doses up to 120 mg/kg. 
In study 18RAD202, female athymic mice were implanted with tumour cells ST3932 (tumour cells with 
PIK3CA mutations, from a 62-year-old woman pre-treated with tamoxifen, fulvestrant/palbociclib, and 
paclitaxel), representing ER-positive cells with a moderate sensitivity to both ribociclib and 
abemaciclib. In ST3932 tumour-bearing mice treated with elacestrant at 30 and 60 mg/kg, significant 
anti-tumour activity was reported with TGIs of 62% and 52% on Day 35, respectively. Similar anti-
tumour activity was observed for the palbociclib, alpelisib, and fulvestrant treatment groups. 
In study 17RAD208, female athymic nude mice were implanted with WHIM43 tumour cells. These 
tumour cells harbour an ESR1D538G mutation, are resistant to palbociclib in vivo and lack 
retinoblastoma protein expression, which makes them resistant to CDK4/6 inhibitors (Wardell et al 
2015b). In WHIM43 tumour
bearing mice treated with elacestrant at 30 and 60 mg/kg, significant anti-
tumour activity was reported with TGIs of 65% and 78% on Day 55, respectively. Fulvestrant and 
palbociclib treatment did not result in significant anti-tumour activity relative to the vehicle control.

In study 16RAD225-2, athymic nude mice were implanted with Champions Tumour Graft human mBC 
model (CTG-1211, a breast cancer cell line with mutant ESR1D538G from a patient with prior 
tamoxifen, fulvestrant, and AI therapy). CTG-1211 tumour
bearing mice treated with elacestrant at 30 
and 60 mg/kg, significant anti-tumour activity was reported with TGIs of 55% and 65% on Day 35, 
respectively. Fulvestrant treatment did not result in significant anti-tumour activity relative to the 
‑
vehicle control. 
In study 16RAD225-1, athymic nude mice were implanted with a low-passage Champions Tumour 
Graft (CTG) to establish a human mBC model. CTG-1260 is a breast cancer cell line that is ER-
positive/progesterone receptor-positive/HER2-negative and includes PIK3CA mutations at D530G and 
H1047R, and an ESR1 mutation at D538G). In CTG-1260 tumour
bearing mice treated with elacestrant 
at 30 and 60 mg/kg, significant anti-tumour activity was reported with TGIs of 53% and 77% on Day 
79, respectively. Fulvestrant treatment did not result in a statistically significant anti-tumour activity 
‑
relative to the vehicle control but gave a similar response as 30 mg/kg elacestrant. 
Pharmacokinetics in pharmacology studies 
Pharmacokinetics was not directly assessed in these studies. However, in support of pharmacology 
mouse tumour model studies, a non-GLP study was conducted to evaluate the PK of elacestrant after 
once daily oral doses for 1 week and the PK of fulvestrant after once weekly SC doses for 2 weeks in 
mice (Report 16RAD205). Following oral administration of elacestrant for up to 8 days at doses of 30, 
60, and 120 mg/kg QD, exposure, as assessed by Cmax, was 180 to 347, 556 to 750, and 1530 
ng/mL, respectively, and AUC0-24 was 1490 to 2330, 3740 to 4950, and 12,200 ng•hr/mL, 
respectively.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro secondary pharmacodynamics studies were conducted to evaluate the biochemical target 
selectivity of elacestrant and the binding affinity of elacestrant to CNR1, CNR2, and ADRA2A. In vivo 
studies were conducted to evaluate the uterotrophic effects of elacestrant in female mouse and rat 
pups and in OVX rats. Elacestrant was further assessed by evaluating its ability to regulate LH release 
and prevent bone loss. Additionally, the effects of elacestrant on vasomotor instability were also 
assessed in vivo. 
Biochemical Target Assays 
In study 1035439, 1035745 and 10RAD005 binding and activity of elacestrant towards a wide panel of 
166 molecular targets was evaluated and in these studies, elacestrant at 1 μM presented > 50% 
inhibition for CNR1 (cannabinoid receptor, 99% inhibition), ERβ (98% inhibition), growth hormone 
secretagogue (GHS, ghrelin; 51% inhibition), motilin (71% inhibition), and somatostatin sst1 (52% 
inhibition) receptors. The maximum estimated unbound concentration of elacestrant in human plasma 
was approximately 2.09 ng/mL (assuming approximately 99% protein binding), corresponding to 4.6 
nM, on Day 7 for a 500 mg dose QD (Conlan et al 2020).  
Cannabinoid Receptor 
In study 09RAD043, activity of elacestrant against CNR1 and CNR2 was assessed in a whole cell
based 
assay and elacestrant appeared devoid of agonist activity and possessed only a weak antagonist-like 
activity at this receptor (IC50 = 2 μM). Elacestrant (up to 3 μM) did not suppress forskolin-stimulated 
‑
cAMP in either CNR1- or CNR2-expressing cells. In antagonist mode, elacestrant did not mitigate cAMP 
suppression by WIN55212-2, a known CNR1 and CNR2 agonist. The maximum estimated unbound 
Assessment report

concentration of elacestrant in human plasma was approximately 2.09 ng/mL (assuming approximately 
99% protein binding), corresponding to 4.6 nM, on Day 7 for a 500 mg dose QD (Conlan et al 2020).  
Adrenergic Receptor α2a 
In study 10RAD005, functional activity of elacestrant against ADRA2A was assessed in 3 cell-based 
assays: 1) guanosine triphosphate (GTP)γS binding assay, 2) cAMP assay, and 3) Gqo CHO-K1 
reporter assay. Each assay was unique in that it examined ADRA2A signalling at different points in the 
signalling cascade. In assay 1 it was shown that treatment of elacestrant in the GTPγS binding assay 
did not cause an increase or decrease of GTP binding and the EC50 and IC50 were estimated to be > 
10,000 nM. In assay 2, the cAMP assay, elacestrant did not suppress forskolin-induced cAMP at 
concentrations up to 100 nM and therefore the EC50 was determined to be > 100 nM. In assay 3, 
evaluating the antagonist mode, elacestrant did not mitigate the UK14304 suppression of forskolin-
stimulated cAMP. Consistent with results from GTPγS binding and the cAMP assays, the EC50 and IC50 
for elacestrant agonist and antagonist activity was estimated to be > 3000 nM.  
Effects on Uterine Tissue  
In study 14RAD020, female CD-1 mice (juvenile, 18 to 21 days old), the effect of elacestrant on the 
uterus was compared with E2, tamoxifen, and raloxifene. Elacestrant administered at ≥ 0.1 mg/kg/day 
resulted in decreases of endometrial surface epithelium thickness and decreased uterine weights both 
not dose
dependent. The administration of E2 (at 0.01 and 0.3 mg/kg/day) resulted in uterotrophic 
effects as reflected by significant increased uterus weight. Raloxifene administration at 1 and 10 
‑
mg/kg/day resulted in decreased uterine weights.  
In study 14RAD022, in female Sprague Dawley rats (juvenile, 21 to 24 days old), the effect of 
elacestrant on the uterus was compared with E2, tamoxifen, or raloxifene. Results from this study 
indicated that elacestrant treatment led to decreased uterine thickness/weights at ≥ 1 mg/kg/day, 
whereas E2, tamoxifen, and raloxifene increased the thickness of the endometrial epithelium. Only E2 
increased uterus weight. 
In study RAD-003, uterotrophic effect of elacestrant was assessed in immature female Sprague Dawley 
rats by assessing changes in uterine weight, histology, and C3-complement gene expression. 
Elacestrant showed no agonist activity in the uterus of the immature rat at doses up to 100 mg/kg. 
Elacestrant was found to have no significant effect on uterine weight. Elacestrant (0.1 to 10 mg/kg) 
dose-dependently antagonized the uterotrophic effects of E2, while having no agonist
like effect up to 
the highest dose tested (100 mg/kg). Microscopic analysis of elacestrant-treated animals (100 mg/kg) 
‑
confirmed the absence of morphological changes in the endometrial epithelium compared with the 
vehicle. Elacestrant did not result in a change in C3-complement gene expression. In conclusion, 
elacestrant, unlike E2, raloxifene, or tamoxifen, did not stimulate the uterus, but antagonized 
oestrogen action on the uterus. 
Effects on Luteinizing Hormone Release 
In study RAD-008, the activity of elacestrant to regulate LH release was evaluated in OVX female 
Wistar rats that have decreased endogenous oestrogen and elevated serum LH level.

At doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg, elacestrant treatment showed a weak oestrogen-like agonist activity by 
decreasing serum LH (40% inhibition as compared with 85% by EB), reaching statistical significance at 
the 10 mg/kg dose level (p = 0.008) compared with vehicle. The inhibitory effect displayed by 
elacestrant was less than that of oestradiol benzoate (EB). 
Effects on Ovariectomized Rat Osteoporosis Model 
In study RAD-004, OVX or SHAM surgery (SHAM) were treated with elacestrant and E2 for 4 wks. 
Elacestrant was well tolerated at doses up to 3 mg/kg. OVX rats treated with elacestrant ≥ 0.1 mg/kg 
showed a dose-dependent reduction in OVX-induced body weight gain. E2 had a similar effect on 
decreasing OVX-induced weight gain. Elacestrant and E2 treatment prevented OVX-induced bone loss 
and also preserved bone microarchitecture. Compared to OVX, uterine wet weights in rats 
administered elacestrant were slightly higher and approximately 25% of the weight of the SHAM 
animals, whereas E2 increased uterine weight as compared to OVX alone to a level similar to the SHAM 
group (68% of the weight of the SHAM animals).  
In study RAD-006, female Fischer rats that had undergone either OVX or SHAM were treated with 
elacestrant or E2 for 8 wks. Elacestrant prevented OVX-induced bone loss at dose levels as low as 0.1 
mg/kg, while preserving bone microarchitecture. This protection against bone loss was achieved in part 
by a reduction in bone resorption, as demonstrated by a reduction in urinary deoxypyridinoline at 4 
weeks. Additionally, elacestrant treatment decreased plasma cholesterol levels, and there was no 
uterine stimulation. 
Vasomotor Symptoms 
In study RAD-005, the effect of elacestrant on vasomotor responses were evaluated in a morphine-
dependent rat model by measuring naloxone-induced change in tail-skin temperature (TST).

Both EE (17-α-ethinyl oestradiol) and elacestrant (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) significantly abated the naloxone-
induced flush, with no significant difference in TST change observed between EE and elacestrant (1 
mg/kg).  
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
In vivo and in vitro safety pharmacology studies were performed to assess the cardiac safety, 
respiratory effects, and neurological effects of elacestrant. Other safety pharmacology studies 
investigated the effects of elacestrant on bleeding time, wound healing, and the gastrointestinal 
system. 
•  Cardiovascular System In Vitro and In Vivo 
In Vitro 
Study 7801-126 
An in vitro GLP study was conducted to evaluate the effects of elacestrant on hERG (stably transfected 
in human embryonic kidney [HEK]-293 cell line) channel current, a surrogate for IKr, the rapidly 
activating delayed rectifier cardiac potassium current (Report 7801-126). The inhibition of hERG 
channel current is commonly used to identify the potential of compounds to induce QT (total 
depolarisation and repolarisation time) prolongation and, ultimately, the malignant arrhythmia Torsade 
de Pointes. Four concentrations of elacestrant (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1 µM) were used to determine the 
hERG effects(s). In vitro effects of elacestrant in a stably transfected HEK-293 cell line were evaluated 
at elacestrant concentrations from 0.1 to 1 µM. The nominal IC50 for the inhibitory effect of elacestrant 
on hERG potassium current was 0.41 µM (407 nM) (Hill coefficient = 2.3). 
Study 7801-131 
The effect of elacestrant on cardiac action potentials was evaluated in an in vitro GLP study using 
isolated rabbit Purkinje fibres (Report 7801-131). Purkinje fibres were isolated from 8 female New 
Zealand White rabbits. Studies were conducted at physiologic temperature (37ºC). After stabilisation, 4 
fibres were exposed to the vehicle first, then to increasing concentrations of elacestrant, for 20 
minutes each, before stimulation at basic cycle lengths of 1.0 and 0.5 seconds. These basic cycle 
lengths correspond to in vivo heart rates of 60 and 120 beats/minute, respectively. The 3 
concentrations of elacestrant used were 0.1, 1, and 10 μM (clinically equivalent to 46, 459, and 4586 
ng/mL), and a parallel vehicle control was evaluated. At the end of the vehicle exposure period, a 
positive control, dl-sotalol (50 µM), was applied. Electrophysiology parameters collected included 
resting membrane potential (RMP; mV), action potential amplitude (APA; mV), maximum rate of rise 
(Vmax; V/s), action potential duration at 60% repolarisation (APD60; ms), and APD90 (ms). 
No significant physiological effects were noted at elacestrant concentrations of 0.1 and 1 μM  at 
stimulation frequencies mimicking heart rates of 60 and 120 beats/minute. At the 10 μM 
concentration, electrical stimulation failed to elicit action potentials in 2 of the 4 fibres. Thus, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 34/197  
 
 
 
 
assessment of the electrophysiologic effects of elacestrant in these 2 fibres was not possible. In the 2 
fibres that responded to the electrical field stimulation, 10 μM elacestrant decreased APA at a 
stimulation frequency equivalent to 60 beats/minute. At a stimulation frequency equivalent to 
120 beats/minute, these 2 fibres demonstrated a decrease in all electrophysiology parameters except 
for RMP, which was increased. For comparison, dl-sotalol increased APD60 and APD90 by 32% and 35%, 
respectively, at basic cycle lengths of 0.5 seconds and by 52% and 54%, respectively, at basic cycle 
lengths of 1.0 second. 
Elacestrant showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of hERG channel current at concentrations 
from 0.1 to 1 µM, with an IC50 of 0.41 µM (407 nM). However, at the 1 μM concentration, which 
produced an 86.8% IKr blockade in the hERG assay, there were no significant action potential changes 
in APD60, APD90, RMP, or Vmax at both stimulation frequencies. At 10 µM, a decrease of APA was 
detected at stimulation frequencies mimicking heart rates of 60 beats/minute, whereas a decrease of 
APA, APD60, APD90, and Vmax and an increase of RMP was recorded at stimulation frequencies 
mimicking heart rates of 120 beats/minute. 
In Vivo 
The cardiovascular safety of elacestrant was evaluated in an in vivo GLP 4-dose crossover study in 
cynomolgus monkeys (7801-118). Eight naïve female cynomolgus monkeys were assigned to 
treatment groups using a 4 × 4 Latin square crossover design. Each animal received 1 of 4 doses on 
Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of the dosing phase. Assessment of cardiovascular function was based on 
hemodynamic measurements (heart rate and blood pressure) measurements, cardiac inotropy 
(dP/dtmax), and ECG parameters (ECG measurements including QRS, RR, QT, and rate corrected QT 
intervals) evaluated predose and approximately 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose on each dosing 
day. Mortality, clinical signs (including qualitative food consumption), body weights, intra-abdominal 
body temperature (via telemetry), and clinical pathology evaluations were assessed. 
All animals survived through the in-life period. Elacestrant-related clinical signs included emesis in 4/8 
animals and liquid faeces in 3/8 animals following the administration of 100 mg/kg elacestrant. 
Elacestrant administration produced no adverse hemodynamic or ECG effects in 8 female cynomolgus 
monkeys at oral doses up to 50 mg/kg and only modest changes at the 100 mg/kg dose. All ECGs 
were within normal limits at doses up to 100 mg/kg. The PR interval of the ECG was decreased (6% to 
11% relative to time-matched controls) at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg, while QRS duration was increased (by 
approximately 10% relative to time-matched vehicle controls) in the 100 mg/kg group. Significant (p ≤ 
0.05) elacestrant-related changes in cardiovascular telemetry data included increases in covariate-
adjusted mean diastolic (11%), systolic (6%), and mean arterial pressures (8%) at one hour post-dose 
in animals given 100 mg/kg. Covariate-adjusted mean heart rate was significantly higher than time-
matched vehicle control in animals given 100 mg/kg at 1 (10% increase), 2 (14% increase), and 4 
(22% increase) hours post-dose. Heart rate changes were reversible.  
ECG measurements including QT(c) in repeated dose toxicity studies, during which monkeys were 
exposed to elacestrant for 4 weeks up to 50 mg/kg or for 39 weeks up to 30 mg/kg, did not show 
cardiac effects.  
A comparison of in vitro hERG inhibition (IC50 187 ng/mL) and estimated unbound elacestrant 
concentration of 2.7 ng/mL in monkey plasma at 50 mg/kg (a dose that was shown to be devoid of any 
QT interval effects) showed an approximately 69-fold safety margin. These data showed that 
elacestrant has a low risk for adverse cardiovascular effects at the human therapeutic dose level, as 
the maximum estimated unbound concentration of elacestrant in human plasma was approximately 
2.09 ng/mL (assuming approximately 99% protein binding) on Day 7 for a 500 mg dose QD (Conlan et 
al 2020).

•  Respiratory system 
The respiratory safety of elacestrant was evaluated in vivo in a GLP oral dose study (7801-119) in 
Sprague
Dawley rats. Twenty-four female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to treatment groups. 
Assessment of respiratory function was based on analysis of respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute 
volume at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 24 hours post-dose. Baseline data were collected for at least 1 hour on 
‑
a day prior to dosing. No significant effect, and no biologically relevant differences were detected in 
respiratory rate, tidal volume, or minute volume at any measured time point relative to concurrent 
vehicle group and predose values in female rats given a single dose of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg 
elacestrant via oral gavage. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed during the study. All animals 
survived until scheduled sacrifice. Elacestrant does not affect the respiratory system.  
•  Central nervous system 
The neurological safety of elacestrant was evaluated in vivo in a GLP oral dose study (7801-120) in 
Sprague-Dawley rats. Twenty female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to treatment groups. After 
dosing, animals were observed postdose for 5 days to assess the reversibility, persistence, or delayed 
occurrence of any effects. Assessment of neurotoxicity was based on mortality, clinical signs, body 
weight, and a modified Irwin battery of neurological assessments, including cage side, hand held, open 
field, and elicited response observations. 
All animals that received elacestrant survived until scheduled sacrifice. No abnormal observations for 
the elicited responses in the modified Irwin screen. Body temperature, nociceptive reflex, forelimb grip 
strength, and hind limb grip strength were similar and not significantly altered by administration of 25, 
50, or 100 mg/kg elacestrant, relative to the response observed with animals given vehicle or during 
pre-dose baseline screens. 
•  Other organ systems 
Bleeding time assessment 
In study 14RAD009 (GLP) the potential effect of elacestrant on bleeding time was evaluated. Forty 
male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (5 animals/sex/group) were assigned to treatment groups. 
Cutaneous bleeding time was assessed at least 1 hour post-dose on Day 7. The bleeding time was 
measured at intervals of 2 minutes until bleeding ceased. Additional parameters and endpoints 
evaluated throughout the study included clinical signs, body weights, body weight changes, and food 
consumption. Warfarin was administered as a positive control drug. 
Once daily oral administration of elacestrant 20 and 50 mg/kg/day was well tolerated in rats. No 
elacestrant-related mortalities occurred; however, 1 female animal died following treatment with 
warfarin. Additionally, there was no elacestrant-related clinical sign or effect on body weights or food 
consumption during the study.

Wound healing 
In study 14RAD30 (GLP) a potential effect of elacestrant on wound healing was addressed. Eighty male 
and female Sprague-Dawley rats (3 to 4 animals/sex/group) were assigned to treatment groups. Prior 
to dosing, 2 full thickness linear skin wounds of 2 cm were created using a scalpel and then closed 
using wound clips. Before dosing and on dosing days (Days 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28), the areas 
surrounding the wounds were observed and scored according to Draize. Other parameters and 
endpoints evaluated in this study included clinical signs, body weights, body weight changes, food 
consumption, ophthalmology, clinical pathology parameters (haematology, coagulation, clinical 
chemistry, and urinalysis), gross necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathologic examinations. 
Elacestrant was well tolerated at all dose levels. There were no mortalities and no elacestrant-related 
clinical signs or effects on body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, haematology, clinical 
chemistry, or urinalysis. 
There was an increase in fibrinogen on Day 7 (1.2×) at the ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day dose in females and the 
50 mg/kg/day dose in males. This increase was also present on Day 15 (1.1× to 1.2×) at the 
≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day dose in both males and females. No fibrinogen level changes were evident on Days 
22 and 29. 
QD oral administration of elacestrant was well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg/kg. No significant 
differences between elacestrant treatment and vehicle control animals in wound healing were 
observed. 
Gastrointestinal effects 
The effect of elacestrant on gastrointestinal organs was evaluated in ferrets in 3 studies by analysing 
the emetic potential of elacestrant after administration (15RAD250, 16RAD223, and 16RAD231). In 
study 15RAD250, 24 male ferrets were assigned to treatment and morbidity/mortality checks were 
performed twice daily. There were no mortalities reported during the course of the study. The most 
common clinical observations noted across all groups were low food consumption, unformed faeces, 
and decreased amount of faeces. The majority of the animals experienced a general increase in body 
weight throughout the study, whereas animals in the 100 mg/kg group lost between 18% and 22% of 
Assessment report

their body weight. It was shown that animals that received elacestrant at 30 and 100 mg/kg had signs 
of emesis, which occurred at a higher frequency in the 100 mg/kg group. In animals that received 30 
mg/kg, the number of emesis observations decreased over the course of the study.  
In study 16RAD223, male ferrets were assigned to treatment groups and morbidity/mortality checks 
were performed twice daily. All animals appeared healthy throughout the study with occasional low 
food consumption in all groups; there were no elacestrant-related effects on body weight. On Day 7, 1 
animal that received oral elacestrant was found dead with red nasal and oral discharge. A necropsy 
was performed but revealed no insight to explain the discharges. 
Animals that received oral elacestrant had signs of emesis (retching and vomiting). These animals 
retched up to 37 minutes and were observed to have retched up to 159 times during in-life. Animals 
that received the elacestrant free base formulation had a higher frequency of emetic events than 
animals that received the elacestrant salt formulations (with and without pH adjustment). The number 
of emesis observations decreased over the duration of the study. No emesis was observed following 
subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg elacestrant. It was shown that animals that received oral 
elacestrant were observed to have signs of emesis. This occurred at a higher frequency in animals that 
received the elacestrant free base formulation than in animals that received the elacestrant salt 
formulations.  
In study 16RAD231, 28 male ferrets were assigned to treatment group. Morbidity/mortality checks 
were performed twice daily.  It was shown that animals that received oral elacestrant were observed to 
have non-dose-related signs of emesis, which occurred more frequently in animals that received the 
tablet with polymer film in comparison to those that received the table with enteric coating. For most 
of the animals, emesis peaked on Day 3.  
The most common clinical observations noted across all groups were low food consumption, vomitus, 
unformed faeces, and decreased amount of faeces. Animals that received elacestrant at higher doses 
experienced a higher frequency of emetic events (retching and vomiting). 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Except for the studies in combination with palbociclib and everolimus, no pharmacodynamic drug 
interaction studies with elacestrant have been submitted. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The effect of elacestrant on permeability and transporters (Caco-2 cells), plasma-protein binding (rat, 
monkey, human), metabolism and metabolite identification (rat, monkey and human hepatocytes) 
were studied in vitro. Furthermore, several PK interactions, such as cytochrome P450 
induction/inhibition were also studied in vitro. The pharmaco- and toxicokinetic effects of elacestrant 
were studied in vivo. Several single-dose pharmacokinetic studies were performed in rats (Sprague-
Dawley and Long Evans) and cynomolgus monkeys after intravenous, oral and subcutaneous dosing. 
Repeat-dose toxicokinetics after oral administration were studied in mice (athymic nude-Foxn1nu), 
rats (Sprague-Dawley and Long Evans) and cynomolgus monkeys for durations up to 39 weeks. 
Distribution in pregnant animals was not studied, but toxicokinetic data was collected for pregnant 
rats. Distribution, metabolism and excretion were not studied in the monkey. 
Single- and repeat-dose kinetics 
The PK of elacestrant was studied in single-dose studies in rats and monkeys. In the single-dose 
studies oral, IV and SC doses were investigated. Bioavailability was assessed after single-dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 38/197  
 
 
 
 
administration and was dose dependent. Based on the urinary and biliary excretions in bile-duct 
cannulated rats, approximately 50% of a radiolabelled dose (30 mg/kg) was absorbed. However, in 
other studies, comparing IV versus oral administration at doses of 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, the 
bioavailability was lower at about 14-23% in rats and 7.6-18.1% in monkeys (administered the same 
doses as the rats). The bioavailability increased with increase in dose resulting in a more than dose 
proportional increase in Cmax and AUC. However, at much higher doses (100-900 mg/kg), the 
increase was less than dose proportional, indicating a limit to the increase in bioavailability or 
potentially even a decrease.  
It should also be noted that with increasing dose, the Tmax increases from about 2-4 hours in low 
doses to 8-24 hours after high doses in rats. For monkeys there is a similar effect with Tmax of 1-4 
hours at low doses and 7-12 hours at higher doses. The T1/2 ranged from approximately 6 hours in 
rats to 11-13 hours in monkeys. Exceptions were the IV dose in monkeys (half-life approx. 4 hours) 
and the SC dose in rats (half-life approx. 17 hours). Volume of distribution and clearance were 
comparable between monkeys and rats, with Vd values of 24 and 19 L/kg and Cl values of 1.5 and 2.1 
L/h/kg, respectively.  
Repeat-dose studies were performed in mice, rats and monkeys. In mice doses from 30-120 mg/kg 
were tested. Exposure to elacestrant increased with the increase in dose level from 3 to 60 
mg/kg/dose (once daily) and from 15 to 30 mg/kg/dose (BID). Generally, the increases in elacestrant 
Cmax, AUC0-12, and AUC0-24 values were approximately dose proportional from 3 to 15 mg/kg/dose 
and greater than dose proportional from 15 to 60 mg/kg/dose. A 4-fold increase in dose (from 15 to 60 
mg/kg once daily) resulted in a 9.3-fold increase in Cmax and a 7.8-fold increase in AUC0-24. Half-life 
was stable at about 5 hours and Tmax ranged from 2-6 hours, without substantial differences between 
day 1 and day 7.  
After repeat-dosing in rats, plasma exposure of elacestrant generally increased with increasing dose 
from 100 to 900 mg/kg on Day 1 and from 100 to 300 mg/kg on Day 7, and these increases were less 
than dose proportional. After oral administration, Tmax values ranged from 8.00 to 24.0 hours (Day 1) 
and from 2.00 to 8.00 hours (Day 7). The increases in exposure on Days 1 and 7 were consistently 
less than dose proportional, with dose increases of 3- and 9-fold (Day 1 only) producing ≤2.2-fold 
increases in Cmax and AUC0-24. Values for Cmax and AUC0-24 were consistently higher after 7 days 
of repeat dosing, but increases were not marked (i.e., remained < 2.0-fold), indicating slight/minimal 
accumulation. Exposure to elacestrant, as assessed by Cmax and AUC0-24, increased with the increase 
in dose level from 10 to 50 mg/kg/day in the 178 day study. The increases in sex-combined Cmax and 
AUC0-24 were approximately dose proportional on Day 1, Day 88, and Day 178. However, female rats 
generally exhibited higher exposure than males, with approximately 2.1-fold differences observed in 
Cmax and AUC0-24 on Day 88 and Day 178 in rats administered 50 mg/kg/day. The Cmax and AUC0-
24 values were generally higher on Day 88 and Day 178 than on Day 1. Accumulation ratios for Cmax 
and AUC0-24 ranged from 0.722 to 3.47 and were higher in females than in males. In the 90-day 
study females had higher Cmax and AUC0-24 values than males, although no marked (> 2-fold) sex 
differences were observed. 
In monkeys (administered 10-100 mg/kg per day) this effect was less pronounced. No accumulation of 
elacestrant was observed after multiple dosing in monkeys (mean accumulation ratios at Day 89 and 
Day 270 ranged from 0.861 to 1.69 for Cmax and from 1.05 to 1.62 for AUC0-24). The increases in 
mean Cmax and AUC0-24 were approximately dose proportional, except for mean AUC0-24 values for 
males. Mean AUC0-24 for males increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner from 20 to 30 
mg/kg/day; a 3-fold increase in dose from 10 to 30 mg/kg/day resulted in 4.7- and 5.3-fold increase 
in AUC0-24. No marked (> 2-fold) sex differences were observed in elacestrant mean Cmax and AUC0-
24 values.

Pharmacokinetic data obtained from pregnant rats (GD6 and GD17) at doses of 3-30 mg/kg per day 
revealed no substantial differences compared to data from non-pregnant rats at similar doses. AUC 
and Cmax were only marginally lower in pregnant compared to non-pregnant rats and the Tmax (4-8 
hours) was a little higher compared to the non-pregnant animals (2-6 hours) at comparable dose 
levels. Exposure, as assessed by elacestrant Cmax and AUC0-24, increased with the increase in dose 
level from 3 to 30 mg/kg/day in a greater than dose-proportional manner. The 10-fold increase in dose 
level resulted in 22.7- to 27.2-fold increases in AUC0-24 and 18.7- and 22.7-fold increases in Cmax. 
Some accumulation of elacestrant was observed after multiple doses in pregnant rats, with 
accumulation ratios on GD 17 of 1.36 to 1.90 for Cmax and 1.55 to 2.04 for AUC0-24. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding was assessed by equilibrium dialysis and, due to the high protein binding, by 
the ultracentrifugation method in the range of 0.2-20 uM. This correlates to 106-10600 ng/mL (MW 
elacestrant 2HCl: 531.56 g/mol). The observed Cmax values in PK and TK studies in rat and monkey are 
within this range. For humans the Cmax after 400 mg PO was approx. 30-60 ng/mL depending on a fed 
or fasted state. Results showed that elacestrant was highly bound to the proteins in rat, monkey, and 
human plasma (approximately 99% binding). The percent unbound values were similar across the 
species, being 1.61%, 0.918% and 1.00% in rat, monkey and human plasma respectively, and did not 
show the concentration dependence over the tested concentration range. Although the percentage 
unbound elacestrant was low in all species, it should be noted that the percentage was > 1.5 fold 
higher in rats than in monkeys and humans.  
A tissue distribution study was carried out in nonpigmented Sprague Dawley and partially pigmented 
Long Evans rats using 14C-elacestrant. After a single oral dose of 30 mg/kg radiolabelled elacestrant, 
tissue distribution was widespread. Tissues with the highest exposures of radioactivity were the 
exorbital lacrimal gland, adrenal gland, liver, spleen, and intra-orbital lacrimal gland. Radioactivity was 
not measurable in the brain, eye lens, spinal cord, and testes. Tissue:plasma concentration ratios were 
generally >1 both in SD and LE rats, suggesting that 14C-elacestrant–derived radioactivity distributed 
to tissues more than in plasma. 14C-elacestrant-derived radioactivity in partially pigmented rats was 
associated with ocular melanin in the uveal tract of the eye, but was not preferentially associated with 
pigmented skin. Radioactivity levels in the uveal tract decreased over time, suggesting the association 
with ocular melanin was temporary.  
In SD rats, the mean blood:plasma radioactivity concentration ratios ranged from 0.933 to 1.29 in 
males and 0.899 to 1.55 in females. In LE rats individual blood:plasma radioactivity concentration 
ratios at 0.5 through 72 hours ranged from 0.790 to 1.47. Blood:plasma ratios were not assessed for 
monkeys. However, no haemotoxicity was observed in single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies.  
Placental transfer and excretion in milk were not assessed for elacestrant.  
Metabolism 
Elacestrant was extensively metabolized in vitro in rat (<25% parent remaining) and monkey (<33% 
parent remaining) hepatocytes with less extensive metabolism in human hepatocytes (approximately 
40%-50% parent remaining) after 120 minutes of incubation. N-dealkylation and glucuronidation were 
common metabolic pathways in all species tested, producing metabolites M1, M8, M10, M13, and M15 
in all 3 species. O-demethylation was specific to rat, and Phase II conjugation was more extensive in 
rat than monkey or human hepatocytes. Phase II metabolites M3, M4, M6, and M11 were exclusive to 
rat hepatocyte incubations, and sulfonation of elacestrant or metabolites was limited in monkey 
hepatocytes and notably absent in human hepatocytes. No unique human metabolites were observed, 
nor metabolites only formed in monkeys and humans. In vivo biotransformation was only assessed in 
rats. 14C-elacestrant–derived components were quantified and identified/characterized in plasma,

urine, bile, and faeces from intact or bile duct–cannulated male and female Sprague Dawley rats after 
a single 30 mg/kg-oral dose of 14C-elacestrant 2HCl. Elacestrant was extensively metabolized in rats 
after oral administration to yield 53 metabolites, of which 26 were identified/characterized. Primary 
metabolism was mediated by oxidative O-demethylation, oxidative N-dealkylation, glucuronidation, 
and, to a lesser extent, dehydrogenation and oxidation. Secondary oxidative N-dealkylation and 
glucuronidation were substantial, while secondary sulfonation, methylation, oxidation, and 
dehydrogenation were observed to a relatively low level. 
Elacestrant and 5 metabolites were quantified and identified/characterized in rat plasma across sexes. 
The identified/characterized metabolites included EAEBA (M1), EAEBA glucuronide conjugates M16 and 
M20, methoxy elacestrant (M49), and desmethyl elacestrant glucuronide (M27). One additional 
metabolite, M57, was quantified in plasma from both sexes, but no structural information could be 
elucidated for this metabolite. Eight metabolites were quantified and identified/characterized in male 
rat bile. Identified/characterized metabolites included primary elacestrant glucuronide and elacestrant 
carbamoyl-glucuronide conjugates M8 and M53, respectively, desmethyl elacestrant glucuronide (M4), 
desethyl elacestrant glucuronide (M13), desmethyl desethyl elacestrant glucuronide conjugates M41 
and M48, desmethyl methoxy elacestrant glucuronide (M37), and desmethyl elacestrant sulphate 
conjugate M45. Three metabolites were quantified and identified/characterized in rat urine across 
sexes and groups. Identified/characterized metabolites included EAEBA (M1), EAEBA glucuronide 
(M21), and EAEBA glucuronyl glutathione conjugate (M23). In addition, 5 trace metabolites (< 1% of 
dose), including M17, M19, M22, M25, and M36, were quantified in urine but were below the limit for 
structural elucidation. Elacestrant and 12 metabolites were quantified and identified/characterized in 
rat faeces across sexes and groups. Identified/characterized metabolites included EAEBA (M1), 
dehydro-elacestrant (M12), desmethyl elacestrant (M38), desmethyl elacestrant sulphate (M42), 
desmethyl oxy elacestrant (M30 and M33), desmethyl oxydehydro-elacestrant (M31), desethyl 
elacestrant (M15), desethyl oxydehydro-elacestrant (M56), desethyl methyl elacestrant (M51), and 
desmethyl desethyl elacestrant (M34 and M52). In addition, 7 trace to minor metabolites (M40, M54, 
M58, M59, M60, M61, and M62) were quantified, but no structural information was elucidated. 
Metabolite M1 was a major metabolite in vivo in male rats (28.1%), but not in female rats (8.85%). 
The metabolite M1 was also seen in vitro in monkey hepatocytes and both in vitro and in vivo in 
humans (but M1 was not a major metabolite). No unique human metabolites were observed in vitro. In 
clinical human studies, the main metabolite in plasma was M16 (41.3%, a glucoronidation of M1) and 
the parent elacestrant was only 5.2%. In rat plasma, M16 accounted for 7.3% in males and 5.4% in 
females.  
Excretion 
As is the case with distribution and metabolism, the excretion was only assessed in rats. In both intact 
and bile-duct cannulated rats 14C-elacestrant–related radioactivity was eliminated mainly via biliary 
and faecal excretion. Urinary excretion was a minor route of elimination. Urinary and faecal 
radioactivity accounted for 10.8% and 83.1%, respectively, of the radioactive dose in males and 
2.94% and 92.5%, respectively, of the radioactive dose in females, with overall male and female 
means of 6.87% and 87.8% of dose, respectively. Total mean recoveries of radioactivity in males and 
females were 95.0% and 96.0%. Urinary, biliary, and faecal radioactivity accounted for 4.38%, 45.3%, 
and 47.7%, respectively, of the radioactive dose in bile duct cannulated males. The total mean 
recovery of radioactivity was 98.1%. 
Elacestrant parent form was quantified in faeces, but not in urine, and accounted for 42.9% of dose 
from males and 38.7% of dose from females. EAEBA glucuronyl glutathione conjugate (M23) was the 
most abundant metabolite in urine from both sexes and accounted for 6.93% of dose in males and for 
1.62% of dose in females, with an overall male and female mean of 4.28% of dose. In faeces, EAEBA

(M1), desmethyl elacestrant (M38), and co-eluting metabolites desethyl oxydehydro-
elacestrant/desethyl elacestrant (M56/M15) were the most abundant metabolites in both sexes.  
In bile duct-cannulated male rats elacestrant parent form was quantified in faeces, accounting for 
48.5% of dose, but was not detected in urine and bile. Metabolites were excreted primarily in bile 
(36.6% of dose) and to a lesser extent in urine (3.99% of dose) and faeces (3.60% of dose). EAEBA 
glucuronyl glutathione conjugate M23 was the most abundant, albeit minor, metabolite in urine and 
accounted for 2.79% of dose. In faeces, EAEBA (M1), desmethyl elacestrant (M38), and dehydro 
elacestrant (M12) were trace metabolites that accounted for less than 1% of dose. 
In healthy male volunteers excretion was assessed after a single-dose of 400 mg radiolabelled 
elacestrant (RAD1901-111). The overall mean recovery of radioactivity in urine and faeces samples 
was 89% over the 480-hour study, with observed mean recovery in urine and faeces of 7.53% and 
81.5%, respectively, indicating that faecal excretion was the predominant route of elimination for 
elacestrant. The geometric mean percent of RAD1901 recovered in urine was 0.042% suggesting low 
renal clearance. Geometric mean values for AUC0-tlast and AUC0-∞ for elacestrant in plasma were 
approximately 3% and 2%, respectively, of those for total radioactivity in plasma suggesting the 
presence of circulating metabolites.   
Compared to the recovery of radiolabelled elacestrant in rats, the excretion in humans appears to be 
similar, with the faeces as the predominant route of elimination, low recovery in urine, presence of 
circulating metabolites and only a very low clearance of parent elacestrant in urine.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Studies in human liver microsomes and with recombinant enzymes revealed that elacestrant was a 
substrate of CYP3A4 with a minor contribution of CYP2A6 and CYP2C9. No reaction phenotyping studies 
for UGTs were submitted. 
In vitro studies assessing possible relevance of metabolic enzymes for drug interactions of elacestrant 
are summarised in Table 9.

Data from an evaluation of enzyme induction (CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) in cryopreserved human 
hepatocytes in a collagen-sandwich configuration on the mRNA level were also presented. Cytotoxicity 
was shown by LDH release at concentrations above 10 µM. Therefore, only concentrations up to 3 µM 
were analysed for mRNA induction. Respecting the nominal free concentration after correction for 
protein binding in incubation medium, the three analysed doses (0.3, 1 and 3 µM) were in the 
recommended range for analysis as 3 µM were above a 50-fold Cmax.u at the maximum recommended 
daily dose of 345 mg elacestrant. Enzyme induction was in general low for all 3 enzymes and below 
100% induction (2-fold) except for CYP1A2 in one donor. EC50 and Emax were not determined due to 
the high variability. Irrespective if the increase in CYP1A2 mRNA induction was concentration 
dependent for the analysed range of 0.3 up to 3 µM, the observed increase represented only 3% of the 
prototype inducer omeprazole and was therefore below the cut off (20% of model inducer) for an 
inducer according to CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**. CYP2C enzymes were not further analysed 
due to negative results for CYP3A4 mRNA induction and the fact that both enzymes share the same 
signalling pathway (PXR) for induction.

2.5.4.  Toxicology 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Several single-dose oral toxicity studies with elacestrant have been conducted in female Sprague 
Dawley (SD) rats at doses up to 1200 mg/kg and in female Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 500 
mg/kg.

In a non-GLP dose range finding study in female rats, treatment-related decreases in body weight and 
food intake were observed at ≥ 600 mg/kg elacestrant 3 days post-dosing. Additionally, higher liver 
enzyme levels (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST)) and increased white blood cell counts (neutrophils, monocytes) were 
observed. One high dose female rat treated with 1200 mg/kg elacestrant was sacrificed in moribund 
condition on day 2, and macroscopic observations included distended stomach and small intestine and 
discoloration of glandular stomach.  
In a definitive GLP-compliant single-dose toxicity study in female rats, animals treated with ≥ 600 
mg/kg elacestrant showed increased ALT levels, and increased neutrophil and monocyte counts 3 days 
post-dosing. Fifteen days post-dosing, these findings were resolved, although ALP levels increased 
between day 3 and 15 post-dosing. At 900 mg/kg, decreases in body weight gain and food intake were 
observed, but this was resolved at day 15 post-dosing. Therefore, the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) 
was considered 900 mg/kg in female rats.

An additional GLP-compliant study with IV bolus administration of 0.85 mg/kg elacestrant in female 
monkeys did not show any clear treatment-related findings. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Several repeat-dose oral toxicity studies with elacestrant have been conducted in SD rats at doses up 
to 900 mg/kg for up to 26 weeks, and in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 1000 mg/kg for up to 39 
weeks. Initial studies were only performed in female animals, but later studies were conducted in both 
sexes.

2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Elacestrant was not mutagenic in bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assays (Study 7801-100 and 
Study 15RAD251) and did not induce chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes (Study 7801-
101 and Study 15RAD252). Elacestrant was not aneugenic or clastogenic in an in vivo rat bone marrow 
micronucleus assay.

2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not submitted. However, granulosa ovary cell benign tumours were 
present in female rats following 26-week treatment with elacestrant at doses ≥25 mg/kg/day; a 
similar finding was described in the 2-year carcinogenicity study using fulvestrant (NDA 21-344 
Pharmacology Review 2002; Faslodex EPAR 2020). Such tumours have been associated with long-term 
perturbation of endocrine function induced by selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such 
as raloxifene, or such tumours may develop spontaneously in mice lacking ERα (Capen 2004). 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Fertility studies were not submitted (see 2.5.6. discussion on non-clinical aspects). Adverse effects of 
elacestrant on both male and female fertility can be anticipated based on its mechanism of action. 
Fertility was reversibly impaired in female rats following treatment with fulvestrant (NDA 21-344 
Pharmacology Review 2002; Faslodex EPAR 2020), bazedoxifene (NDA 022247 2013), or raloxifene

(NDA 020815 1997), whereas in male rats repeated administration of fulvestrant induced loss of 
spermatozoa and epididymides degeneration (NDA 21-344 Pharmacology Review 2002; Faslodex EPAR 
2020). Decreased cellularity of Leydig cells was noted in male rats at the highest dose of elacestrant 
(50 mg/kg/day) in the 26-week repeat-dose study, and this result was in line with the impaired male 
(and female) fertility described in ERα knockout mice (Korach 1994).  
No early embryonic development toxicity study was submitted (see 2.5.6. discussion on non-clinical 
aspects). 
In an embryo/foetal development study (Study 19RAD230) of pregnant rats administered oral 
elacestrant during the period of organogenesis (Gestation Days 6 to 17), there were elacestrant-
related dose-responsive effects on foetal development at 3-, 10-, and 30-mg/kg/day dose levels, which 
were considered adverse at 10 and 30 mg/kg only. Adverse effects included increased resorptions, 
increased post-implantation loss, and reduced number of live foetuses. Foetal abnormalities included 
external variations and malformations and skeletal malformations of the skull. The maternal NOAEL 
was set at the nominal dose level of 0.3 mg/kg/dose (the lowest dose tested) and was determined 
based on red vulvar discharge, increases in resorptions and post-implantation loss, and fewer live 
foetuses at higher doses. The foetal NOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day.

No studies to assess the effects on pre- and postnatal development, including maternal function, were

Non-clinical studies in offspring / juvenile animals were not submitted (see 2.5.6. discussion on 
nonclinical aspects). 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
A substantial amount of toxicokinetic data has been collected in the pivotal animal species rat and 
monkey. Numerous single- and repeat dose toxicokinetic studies, with different dosages ranging from 
10-900 mg/kg, were performed in rats. Because of the high protein binding, small differences in 
unbound fractions can be of influence for the therapeutic and toxicological effect of elacestrant. 
Therefore, the exposure margins were re-calculated with the AUCs corrected for the unbound 
elacestrant fractions. Exposure multiples from 0.49-16.73 were achieved in rats. In pregnant rats 
(dosed 3-30 mg/kg) exposure margins were 0.09-3.87. In monkeys both single- and repeat-dose 
studies were performed. The dose ranged from 10-1000 mg/kg and exposure multiples were re-
calculated at 0.23-3.51.

2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance 
An GLP-compliant local tolerance study was conducted in male New Zealand white rabbits (Study 
7801-135), with IV and perivenous administration of elacestrant at a dose concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. 
No treatment-related findings occurred, and elacestrant was locally well tolerated.  
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Studies on impurities: There are no mutagenic impurities in the current drug substance based on the in 
silico predictions with Derek Nexus and Leadscope software methods (Study 20RAD232, 185100B, 
8379173). Two intermediates, N-(2-bromo-5-methoxyphenyl)acetamide and 2-bromo-4-
methoxyaniline, were considered to be potentially mutagenic (Class 3 compound) based on structural 
alerts. These 2 intermediates were eliminated through the combination of in-process control and 
purging and are not present in the current batches of drug substance. Additionally, impurities present 
in clinical lots of elacestrant exceeding qualification threshold levels, per ICH Q3A (for non-oncology 
indications), were either considered qualified in repeat-dose toxicology studies or associated with no 
additional risks beyond the active pharmaceutical ingredient.  
Phototoxicity: A GLP-compliant neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay in BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts 
was conducted with elacestrant (potential phototoxicity measured by a reduction in viability of cells 
pre-incubated with elacestrant at concentrations up to 31.6 μg/mL and exposed to ultraviolet radiation 
for approximately 30 minutes (Study 16RAD249)). The photo irritation factor was ≤ 1.118 and the 
mean photo effect was ≤ 0.001, indicating no phototoxic potential of elacestrant. 
Other toxicity studies: No dedicated studies on antigenicity, immunotoxicity or dependence were 
submitted. No studies with elacestrant metabolites were submitted (see discussion on non clinical 
aspects).

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In vitro studies showing degradation of ER by increasing doses of elacestrant and fulvestrant suggest 
that ER degradation was more effective with fulvestrant as compared to elacestrant. This suggestion 
seems to be supported by the fact that the IC50 of fulvestrant for growth inhibition in MCF-7 was 0.8 
nM (Nukatsuka et al, 2019 doi: 10.21873/invivo.11622). This was lower than the IC50 of elacestrant 
for growth inhibition in MCF-7, which was 4.2 nM with and 5.6 nM without E2, respectively. In vitro 
studies did not include any comparison to fulvestrant. In vitro tests suggest that elacestrant has the 
potential to inhibit the (E2 induced) proliferation of MCF-7 cells, of HCC1428-long-term oestradiol 
deprivation [LTED] cells, of ESR1 mutant-bearing MCF7-Y537S and MCF7-D538G cells and of tumour 
cells in a post-CDK4/6 inhibitor setting. The growth inhibitory effect observed appeared to be 
independent of ESR1 status (wild type or mutant) and the CDK4/6 inhibitor used to develop resistance. 
The comparison of elacestrant pharmacological effect on the wild-type (wt) and mutant (mt) ESR1 was 
especially interesting in the light of clinical efficacy data that showed a clear improvement in 
progression-free survival in subjects with mt-ESR1 and no clear difference compared to the standard of 
care in patients having wt-ESR1 (see clinical aspects). Given similar growth inhibitory effect of 
elacestrant in MCF-7 cells with wt- and mt-ESR1, the pharmacology behind the clinical observations is 
unclear. The Applicant discussed the mechanistic background of differences in clinical efficacy of 
elacestrant in patients featuring the wild-type and mutant ESR1, which is reflected below. 
Elacestrant was evaluated for anti-tumour activity in several in vivo ER
positive breast cancer models. 
Tumour growth inhibition by elacestrant was assessed in an oestrogen responsive MCF
7 human breast 
carcinoma and multiple nude mouse PDX models, using cells insensitive to fulvestrant and CDK4/6 
inhibitors and cells harbouring mutations in ESR1 gene. However, cells that were selected from 
‑
‑
patients because of their insensitiveness to fulvestrant or CDK4/6 inhibitors, were cultured afterwards 
or proliferated otherwise, which may have affected the regulation of ER and therefore also other 
characteristics of the model. Thus, the predictive value of the in vivo models for the efficacy of 
elacestrant in (specific) patient (populations) is limited. 
In in vivo anti-tumour studies using a mouse xenograft model, treatment with elacestrant significantly 
inhibited the oestrogen-dependent growth of MCF-7 breast cancer tumours at doses of 30 mg/kg (TGI 
= 66% to 100.5%), 60 mg/kg (TGI = 88% to 103.4%), 90 mg/kg (TGI = 94%), and 120 mg/kg (TGI 
= 94% to 103.6%). However, treatment with fulvestrant and tamoxifen resulted in similar and 
significant anti-tumour effects. Unfortunately, the enantiomeric purity of the elacestrant test product 
has not been specified. Given different pharmacological activity of the R- and S-isomers, the presence 
of the less active S-isomer in the product could have impacted the outcome of non-clinical studies. 
Additionally, elacestrant was associated with prolonged survival in mice implanted with MCF-7 tumour 
cells intracranially, whereas fulvestrant was not. It is suggested that elacestrant passes the blood brain 
barrier, however, it was not shown to distribute to the brains in the distribution study.  
The anti-tumour effect of elacestrant was also evaluated in multiple nude mouse PDX models, using 
cells insensitive to fulvestrant and CDK4/6 inhibitors and cells harbouring mutations in ESR1 gene as 
well as PIK3CA. Overall, elacestrant exhibited anti-tumour activity at doses of 10 mg/kg (TGI = 72% 
to 73%), 30 mg/kg (TGI = 55% to 111%), 60 mg/kg (TGI = 52% to 111%), and 120 mg/kg (TGI = 
104% to 111%) in these PDX models. Study 17RAD211 included a follow-up period, which revealed 
that tumours did not regrow until 3 weeks after last dosing. Nevertheless, this finding suggests that 
resistance to elacestrant manifests rather quickly. This issue was discussed by the Applicant by 
referring to the publication of Pancholi et al., 2022 describing the loss of sensitivity to elacestrant in 
the long-term oestrogen-deprived (LTED) T47D cell line, which results from the loss of ERα. The same 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023

paper reports that culturing MCF7-LTEDY537C cells with 1000 nM elacestrant for a long time leads to 
elacestrant resistance associated with the upregulation of EGFR and IGF-1R. 
The pharmacology of elacestrant is known to be biphasic (tumour growth was observed at 1 and 3 
mg/kg by Wardell et al.), with agonist activity at lower doses and antagonist activity at higher doses. 
The Applicant was asked to clarify whether the expected antagonistic pharmacological effect will be 
elicited at the concentrations observed in patients. From the applicant’s discussion of non-clinical and 
clinical data it is deemed reassuring that with the proposed dosing recommendations and resultant 
expectable exposure ranges in the target population an agonistic effect of elacestrant even after 
crossing the blood-brain barrier can be excluded. 
The in vivo studies differed with respect to cell type (cell line / patient derived), duration of treatment, 
route of administration and used dosage of elacestrant, but also fulvestrant, palbociclib and other type 
of anti-tumour treatments. Therefore, it is difficult to draw conclusions on the efficacy of elacestrant in 
different type of tumours and also in comparison to fulvestrant, or other type of treatments for these 
types of breast cancer.  
Upon request, the Applicant provided a comparison on the in vitro IC50 values of elacestrant and 
fulvestrant. It appeared that fulvestrant induced a complete degradation at ≥ 10 nM in all cell lines 
(and this hindered the estimation of IC50 values), whereas at this concentration of elacestrant, a 
residual band was still present, indicating that fulvestrant was more potent than elacestrant in inducing 
ER degradation. Indeed, the IC50 of fulvestrant for inducing ERα degradation in MCF-7 cells was 
estimated to be 0.06 nM (Weir et al., 2016) and fulvestrant was found to be about 10- to 100-fold 
more effective at ER degradation than elacestrant. The concentration of elacestrant that induces 50% 
degradation of ER overlaps the range of the antiproliferative effect (50 - 100 nM), and the mean 
clinical concentration at 354 mg/day, which is 119 ng/ml (equivalent to 261 nM, considering the 
molecular weight of elacestrant as free base). It can be agreed that elacestrant has potential to inhibit 
ER, however on the molecular level it is not superior to fulvestrant (~10-fold less potent). 
Furthermore, the Applicant was requested to discuss the mechanistic background of different clinical 
efficacy of elacestrant in patients featuring the wild-type and mutant ESR1 considering similar growth 
inhibitory effect of in MCF-7 cells with wt- and mt-ESR1 and binding affinity constants. The Applicant 
referred to a publication of Bihani et al., were IC50 value was measured for different mutant forms of 
ERα. The publication reported that “the affinity of elacestrant on wild type ERα (IC50 of 42 ± 5.3 nM) 
was similar to the affinity displayed on a panel of mutant receptors such as ESR1-D538G (56 ± 4.9 
nM), ESR1-Y537C (30 ± 5.2 nM), ESR1-Y537N (41 ± 5.7 nM), ESR1-Y537S (61 ± 1.7 nM), and ESR1-
S463P (53 ± 2.0 nM), which was confirmed when measuring the transcriptional activity.” However, 
“cotreatment of cells with both elacestrant and E2 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in E2-
induced proliferation, with IC50 values for elacestrant of 27 nM, in the presence of 0.1 nM E2.” The 
Applicant also noted that “the IC50 values of elacestrant for the inhibition of the growth of MCF-7 
ESR1-Y537S, or MCF-7 ESR1-D538G cells sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors (or those resistant to 
palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) were numerically higher than the value for the growth inhibition 
of MCF-7 ESR1--WT (15.9, 4.2, and 0.17 nM, respectively, see Patel et al., 2019)”. It is thus suggested 
that although the affinity of elacestrant for ER-wt and ER-mutants is similar, the potency of elacestrant 
in cells expressing wild type ESR1 depends on the levels of E2, whereas the effect on cells expressing 
ER-mutants could be relatively independent on E2 levels. However, it is not clear whether ER levels are 
equal in these different cell lines, whereas this can play a role in the determination of the IC50. 
Therefore, clinical data is needed to define the activity of elacestrant in different indicated populations 
(all or not pretreated with CDK4/6 inhibitors or aromatase inhibitors and ER-status) (see clinical 
aspects).

The Applicant was also asked to discuss the impact of the differences in tumour type model (also 
comment on the HER-2 status), doses, duration and Route of Administration (RoA) and their effect on 
the final result with regard to the in vivo studies. For plasma exposure values after fulvestrant dosing, 
the applicant referred to a paper from Bihani et al., that communicated on exposure to subcutaneously 
(SC) administered fulvestrant to non-tumour bearing mice. The applicant claimed exposure to SC 
fulvestrant was comparable to fulvestrant exposure after IM administration of Faslodex (as indicated) 
in the clinic, although the applicant did not comment on whether T ½ values were similar or not. 
Furthermore, elacestrant exposure data from one of the in vivo studies suggest that a dose of 30 
mg/kg/day per os (PO) will result in exposure values that can also be reached in the clinic. To 
conclude, for both SERDs tested, exposure values comparable to clinical exposure values can be 
reached in the animals.  
Elacestrant has been tested for its inhibitory effect on ER related tumour growth in vitro and in vivo 
using a lot of different tumour cell lines or patient derived tumour cells that were either or not 
pretreated with endocrine therapy, aromatase inhibitors, CD4/6 inhibitors or another SERD, 
fulvestrant. In the in vivo experiments, the ER positive tumour cells were subcutaneously injected in 
different strains of immunocompromised mice. Animals were treated with various doses of elacestrant, 
all or not in combination with other types of treatment, in studies with different duration. In most of 
the studies elacestrant alone or combined with other treatments was able to provide inhibition of 
tumour growth. The in vivo data also provided an indication that elacestrant (>30 mg/kg) was able to 
inhibit the growth of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive (e.g., ST986) and of 
HER2 negative (e.g., HBCx-21) tumour cells. 
Thus, these data provide support for the concept of elacestrant as an ER-positive-tumour growth 
inhibitor in vitro or in xenograft animal models. However, the circumstances in a ‘petri-dish’ or in an 
immunocompromised mice with tumour cells injected subcutaneously (lacking blood vessel innervation, 
the tumour microenvironment, the immune cells and all other patient specific factors) are so different 
from tumours and their activity in the patient that the provided in vivo data are only valuable in 
providing proof of concept. Positive results with elacestrant in in vitro tumour type models supported 
by positive results in in vivo animals studies with that certain type of tumour cells may provide 
rationale for use in a clinical study with the certain type of tumour. However, it cannot provide support 
for inclusion of certain tumour types in the indication without clear clinical evidence. 
In secondary pharmacology studies, it was determined in an in vitro assay that elacestrant at 1 μM 
resulted in inhibition of CNR1 (99% inhibition), ERβ (98% inhibition), growth hormone secretagogue 
(GHS, ghrelin; 51% inhibition), motilin (71% inhibition), and somatostatin sst1 (52% inhibition) 
receptors. Although elacestrant binds CNR1 and ADRA2A, in cell
based assays elacestrant did not 
exhibit CNR1 or CNR2 functional activity either as agonist or as antagonist, nor did elacestrant exhibit 
agonist or antagonist properties for ADRA2A. At the anticipated peak blood concentration (free fraction 
‑
of Cmax of 2.09 ng/mL at 500 mg/day, corresponding to 4.6 nM), elacestrant would not be expected 
to mediate pharmacological responses via ADRA2A. In vivo, elacestrant antagonized the uterotrophic 
effects of E2 in a dose-dependent manner (0.1 to 10 mg/kg). Elacestrant treatment showed a weak 
oestrogen-like agonist activity by decreasing serum LH in ovariectomized rats and elacestrant 
mediated protection against bone loss was achieved at least in part by a reduction in bone resorption, 
as shown by a reduction in urinary deoxypyridinoline at 4 weeks. Furthermore, elacestrant may be 
effective in modulating vasomotor instability associated with declining ovarian function. 
A study in mice with MCF-7 tumours implanted intracranially suggested elacestrant ability to cross the 
blood-brain barrier. In patients, elacestrant was observed to penetrate the blood-brain barrier in a 
dose-dependent manner. However, when following the proposed dosing recommendations and 
resultant expectable exposure ranges in the target population an agonistic effect of elacestrant even 
after crossing the blood-brain barrier is not expected.

A comparison of in vitro hERG inhibition (IC50 187 ng/mL) and estimated unbound elacestrant 
concentration of 2.7 ng/mL in monkey plasma at 50 mg/kg (a dose that was shown to be devoid of any 
QT interval effects) showed an approximately 69-fold safety margin for QT related effects via hERG 
inhibition. It should be noted however, that the PR interval decreased (6% to 11% relative to time-
matched controls) on Day 7 for a 500 mg dose QD in patients. At that time, the maximum estimated 
unbound concentration of elacestrant in human plasma was approximately 2.09 ng/mL (assuming 
approximately 99% protein binding). This was observed at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg, which may indicate for 
a low risk for adverse cardiovascular effects at the human therapeutic dose level). At the same time, it 
should be noted that ECG measurements in repeated dose toxicity studies (4 weeks up to 50 mg/kg or 
for 39 weeks up to 30 mg/kg) did not show cardiac effects, which is reassuring for the absence of 
cardiac safety effects of the product. No CNS or respiratory effects were noted in rats treated with a 
single dose of elacestrant up to 100 mg/kg and no substantial bleeding risk or change in wound 
healing was observed following elacestrant treatment up to 50 mg/kg for 7 days in rat. Elacestrant 
treatment (30 and 100 mg/kg/day by oral gavage for 7 days) resulted in emetic events (retching and 
vomiting) in ferrets, which occurred more frequently at higher doses. However, the number of emesis 
observations decreased over the duration of the study, suggesting that elacestrant was becoming more 
tolerable in the animals following repeated dosing. 
The absence of dedicated pharmacodynamics interaction studies can be agreed. Combination of 
elacestrant with palbociclib and everolimus in primary pharmacology studies showed additive potential 
with regard to anti-tumour effect. 
Pharmacokinetics  
Overall, the pharmacokinetics of elacestrant have been well studied in the rat, but only partially in 
monkeys even though this is a pivotal animal species.  
General pharmacokinetic parameters seemed to be comparable between non-clinical species and 
humans. Sex differences were observed for rats, but not in monkeys and humans. Bioavailability and 
excretion were comparable between pre-clinical species and humans, however, differences were noted 
between the in vivo metabolism between rats and humans.  
In vivo studies for distribution, metabolism and excretion were only performed in rats. Although all 
pharmacokinetic aspects are covered by the rat studies, an explanation for the lack of studies in 
monkeys regarding blood:plasma distribution and metabolism was asked from the applicant. The 
Applicant acknowledged the lack of a blood:plasma partitioning study in monkeys, but argued that no 
haematotoxicity was observed in the single- and repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys and there 
were no effects on coagulation. Therefore, investigation of potential accumulation in blood cells in 
monkeys was not deemed necessary.   
Regarding the missing in vivo metabolism study in monkeys, the Applicant notes that coverage of 
human major metabolites was not deemed necessary according to ICH guideline S9. Furthermore, a 
good clinical safety profile was established for elacestrant. Therefore, it is not expected that human 
major metabolites have a significant impact on human safety at the selected dose, regardless of their 
exposure in monkeys.   
It appears that the bioavailability increased with increase in dose resulting in a more than dose 
proportional increase in Cmax and AUC. However, at much higher doses (100-900 mg/kg) the increase 
was less than dose proportional, indicating a limit to the increase in bioavailability or potentially even a 
decrease. In humans, the bioavailability was assessed at one dose (below therapeutic dose) and was 
10%, however, at higher doses the bioavailability in humans may be higher and should be considered 
in the assessment of clinical findings.   
Assessment report

Furthermore, elacestrant was highly bound to the proteins in rat, monkey, and human plasma 
(approximately 99% binding). The percent unbound values were similar across the species, being 
1.61%, 0.918% and 1.00% in rat, monkey and human plasma respectively, and did not show the 
concentration dependence over the tested concentration range. However, when interpreting 
toxicological and clinical safety data the exposure based on free fraction should be used and not the 
total exposure. Exposure margins were re-calculated based on free fraction AUCs, since the applicant 
calculated them using the total AUCs. The exposure margins were small but sufficient.   
Lastly, metabolite M1 was a major metabolite in vivo in male rats (28.1%) but not in female rats 
(8.85%). In clinical human studies, the major metabolite in plasma was M16 (41.3%, a 
glucoronidation of M1) and parent elacestrant was only 5.2%. In rat plasma, M16 (a glucuronide of 
M1) accounted for 7.3% in males and 5.4% in females. Due to missing data the metabolic profile in 
monkeys is not known. As the metabolite M16 was adequately qualified in the rat toxicological studies, 
no issues for clinical safety are foreseen. The excretion in humans appeared to be similar to the 
excretion in rats, with the faeces as the predominant route of elimination, low recovery in urine, 
presence of circulating metabolites and only very low clearance of parent elacestrant in urine.  
Studies in human liver microsomes and with recombinant enzymes revealed that elacestrant was a 
substrate of CYP3A4 with a minor contribution of CYP2A6 and CYP2C9. Of note, no reaction 
phenotyping studies for UGTs were submitted, which is acceptable given that glucuronidation reactions 
represent only secondary metabolism.  
A risk of clinically relevant intestinal CYP3A4 inhibition above the threshold exists for elacestrant at the 
dose of 400 mg (345 mg free base) if a basic model is used for the estimation. Data from an 
evaluation of enzyme induction (CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4) in cryopreserved human hepatocytes in 
a collagen-sandwich configuration on the mRNA level were presented. Cytotoxicity was shown by LDH 
release at concentrations above 10 µM. Therefore, only concentrations up to 3 µM were analysed for 
mRNA induction. Respecting the nominal free concentration after correction for protein binding in 
incubation medium, the three analysed doses (0.3, 1 and 3 µM) were in the recommended range for 
analysis as 3 µM were above a 50-fold Cmax,u at the maximum recommended daily dose of 345 mg 
elacestrant. Enzyme induction was in general low for all 3 enzymes and below 100% induction (2-fold) 
except for CYP1A2 in one donor. EC50 and Emax was not determined due to the high variability. 
Irrespective if the increase in CYP1A2 mRNA induction was concentration dependent for the analysed 
range of 0.3 up to 3 µM, the observed increase represented only 3% of the prototype inducer 
omeprazole and was therefore below the cut off (20% of model inducer) for an inducer according to 
CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**. CYP2C enzymes were not further analysed due to negative 
results for CYP3A4 mRNA induction and the fact that both enzymes share the same signalling pathway 
(PXR) for induction. The Applicant argues that Ki can be estimated based on half-maximal inhibitory 
concentration (IC50) as per draft ICH Guidance M12 on drug interaction studies 
(EMA/CHMP/ICH/652460/2022). The Applicant’s estimation of Ki as IC50/2 according to Haupt et al., 
2015 is agreed. The Applicant’s position that the systemic DDI risk for CYP3A4 inhibition by elacestrant 
is low is also agreed. In addition, elacestrant is not expected to inhibit intestinal CYP3A4 activity at 
clinically relevant concentrations up to the exposure obtained at the therapeutic dose of 400 mg QD of 
elacestrant dihydrochloride (345 mg elacestrant). Hence, no in vivo study of the CYP3A4 inhibitory 
potential of elacestrant is required, regardless of the results of the basic model estimations or the 
static mechanistic model (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2**). 
The involvement of BCRP in the transport of elacestrant was evaluated in a BCRP overexpressing 
MDCKII-BCRP monolayer assay for bidirectional permeability. Elacestrant was evaluated at 0.3, 3, 30 
and 300 µM in a vesicular transport substrate assay using inside-out membrane vesicles from cells 
overexpressing human ABCG2 (BCRP) transporter. No significant transport or accumulation was 
determined for elacestrant after initiation of the reaction by either ATP or AMP. In addition, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 60/197  
 
 
 
 
combination with a BCRP inhibitor did not change the ATP/AMP-dependent accumulation. Non-specific 
binding of elacestrant to the surfaces of plastic ware was evaluated in the presence of control vesicles. 
Elacestrant showed non-specific binding at concentrations above 3 µM, which resulted in a lower 
accuracy than the nominal concentration (~70%), which was further reduced by 30-50% by the end of 
the incubation time. This effect limits the value of the data. In conclusion, although the data of both 
assays confirmed that elacestrant is not transported by BCRP, the value of these data is limited due to 
cytotoxicity at relevant higher concentrations in the monolayer assay and high non-specific binding in 
the vesicular transport substrate assay. Nevertheless, taking into account that elacestrant had been 
shown to be a low permeability substance in Caco-2 cells (see below) no overall clinical impact on DDI 
due to BCRP transport is expected. 
The Applicant investigated bidirectional permeability of elacestrant in Caco-2 cells. Overall, elacestrant 
was found to be a low permeability compound. Based on these findings, the Applicant concluded that 
elacestrant is not a substrate of MDR1 (P-gp). This conclusion should, however, be supported by 
studies with MDR1-transfected cells and competition studies with P-gp substrates. The Applicant will 
conduct a study in MDR1-overexpressing cells with and without P-gp inhibitors to clarify whether 
elacestrant is a P-gp substrate (REC). The results will be available by the end of December 2023 
(Results submission: January 2024). As the bidirectional permeability study in Caco-2 cell earlier 
showed low permeability of elacestrant in both directions, the probability of clinically relevant P-gp-
mediated interference with the PK of elacestrant is considered relatively low. Therefore, conducting the 
above-mentioned study in MDR1-overexpressing cells post-approval is acceptable. 
Toxicology 
The Applicant provided a justification for the use of non-human primates as non-rodent species, 
indicating that morphological and hormonal changes in the reproductive system and menstrual cycle 
phases of monkeys closely resemble those of humans.  
Several single-dose oral toxicity studies with elacestrant have been conducted in female Sprague 
Dawley (SD) rats at doses up to 1200 mg/kg and in female Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 500 
mg/kg. Repeat-dose oral toxicity studies with elacestrant have been conducted in SD rats at doses up 
to 900 mg/kg for up to 26 weeks, and in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 1000 mg/kg for up to 39 
weeks. Initial studies were only performed in female animals, but later studies were conducted in both 
sexes.  
In general, treatment with elacestrant displayed a similar toxicity profile in vivo as compared to 
fulvestrant. Female rats and monkeys displayed decreased weight and atrophy of the uterus, vagina, 
cervix, and mammary gland, increased weight of the ovaries correlating with the presence of follicular 
cysts, and atrophy of the pituitary gland (only in rats). Male rats displayed decreased body weight 
(gain) and reduced food intake. These findings are likely caused by the antagonistic effect of 
elacestrant on the tropic effects of 17β-oestradiol (E2) and hormone feedback mechanisms.  
In contrast, male monkeys had increased weights of the pituitary gland. The Applicant provided a 
discussion on the mechanism behind the increase in basophilic pituicytes in the pituitary gland and 
subsequent increased weight of the pituitary gland in male monkeys. However, the mechanism behind 
the increase in basophilic pituicytes in the pituitary gland and subsequent increased weight of the 
pituitary gland in male monkeys remains unclear. Since this isolated finding was reversible upon drug 
discontinuation, and taking into account the indication, it does not represent a major safety concern.  
In a definitive GLP-compliant single-dose toxicity study in female rats, although there was no clear 
dose response, increased ALT levels, and increased neutrophil and monocyte counts can be indicative 
of a transient inflammatory response and possible persistent hepatic injury. Evidence of potential 
hepatotoxicity was noted in both species. However, the increased liver enzymes, sometimes 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 61/197  
 
 
 
 
accompanied by histopathological findings (vacuolated hepatic biliary epithelial cells) in the liver, did 
not show a consistent correlation in either monkeys or rats, and showed inconsistent changes between 
sexes. In addition, vasculitis and/or perivasculitis was only observed at a nearly lethal dose in 
monkeys, and therefore the clinical relevance is likely low. 
Hypoalbuminemia was observed in rats. However, no hypoalbuminemia was observed in monkeys and 
no drug-related hypoalbuminemia was observed in clinical trials with elacestrant. Therefore, this 
finding is not considered relevant for humans. It can be concluded that the findings in non-clinical 
studies did not identify hepatoxicity as an important risk. 
Finally, general toxicity studies additionally revealed treatment-related findings in the stomach and 
small intestine in both rats and monkeys which are considered relevant for humans.   
In conclusion, elacestrant displayed low acute toxicity. In repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and 
monkeys, the antiestrogenic activity of elacestrant was responsible for the effects seen, particularly in 
the female reproductive system, but also in other organs sensitive to hormones such as mammary 
gland, pituitary and testes. Sporadic emesis and diarrhoea were recorded in monkeys. In addition, in 
long-term studies (26 weeks in rats and 39 weeks in cynomolgus monkeys), increased vacuolation of 
the mucosal epithelium of the non-glandular stomach were observed in rats and vacuolated 
macrophage infiltrates in the small intestine were recorded in both rats and monkeys. In monkeys this 
effect occurred at a level of systemic exposure of about 70% of the human exposure. (See SmPC 
section 5.3). 
Elacestrant showed no genotoxic potential in the Ames test, chromosomal aberrations in human 
lymphocytes and in the micronucleus assay in rats (See SmPC section 5.3).  
No carcinogenicity studies with elacestrant were submitted which is in line with ICH S9 Guidance for 
Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals (2009) and deemed acceptable. 
No fertility or early embryonic development studies with elacestrant were submitted, which is deemed 
acceptable. In repeated-dose toxicity studies effects related to fertility were observed in rat and 
monkey female reproductive tract these effects occurred below human exposures at MRHD (maximum 
recommended dose). Decreased cellularity of Leydig cells in rat testes was also observed at exposure 
levels 2.7-fold higher than in humans (see SmPC section 5.3). 
Based on the well-known mechanism of action of SERDs, adverse effects on male and female fertility 
can be anticipated (See SmPC section 4.6). In embryo-foetal development studies in rats, oral 
administration of elacestrant resulted in maternal toxicity (body weight loss, low food consumption, red 
vulvar discharge) and increased resorptions, increased post-implantation loss, and reduced number of 
live foetuses and foetal variations and malformations below human exposures at MHRD. In line with 
the mechanism of action of elacestrant, the observed findings in dams and foetuses were expected. 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment 
with Orserdu and for one week after the last dose (See SmPC section 4.6). There are no data from the 
use of elacestrant in pregnant women. The pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential 
should be verified prior to starting treatment with Orserdu. If pregnancy occurs while taking Orserdu, 
the patient must be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus and potential risk of miscarriage 
(see SmPC section 4.6). It is unknown whether elacestrant/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breast-fed infant, it is recommended that 
lactating women should not breast-feed during treatment with Orserdu and one week after the last 
dose of (see SmPc section 4.6). Based on findings from animal studies (see section 2.5.4.5. ) and its 
mechanism of action, elacestrant may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential 
(see SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3).

No pre- and postnatal development study or study in juvenile animals was submitted. In line with the 
proposed indication, as per ICH guideline S9 on nonclinical evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals 
this is considered acceptable.  
A GLP-compliant local tolerance study was conducted in male New Zealand white rabbits, with IV and 
perivenous administration of elacestrant. No treatment-related findings occurred, and elacestrant was 
locally  well  tolerated.  Since  elacestrant  is  intended  for  oral  administration,  this  study  is  of  limited 
relevance.  
No dedicated studies on antigenicity, immunotoxicity or dependence were performed. No studies with 
elacestrant metabolites were performed. This is acceptable. The impurities present in the drug substance 
or  intermediates  to  the  drug  product  were  adequately  evaluated  based  on  in  silico  predictions. 
Additionally,  impurities  exceeding  the  qualification  limits  were  adequately  qualified  in  repeat-dose 
toxicity studies. 
A GLP-compliant neural red uptake phototoxicity assay in BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts was conducted 
with elacestrant. The photo irritation factor was ≤ 1.118 and the mean photo effect was ≤ 0.001, 
indicating no phototoxic potential of elacestrant.   
Elacestrant dihydrochloride is potentially PBT/vPvB, the PBT assessment cannot be finalised in absence 
of the required studies. For Tier A only a ready biodegradability test is provided that is considered 
unreliable. The substance was toxic to the inoculum, and the test should be repeated as per OECD TG 
301 (section 25). The applicant should consider performing the activated sludge, respiration inhibition 
test (OECD TG 209) prior to repeating the OECD TG 301 test as this test could provide information on 
the toxicity and the appropriate test concentration.  
As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the 
potential risk of elacestrant to the environment. The applicant commits to perform the following 
studies and provide the expert reports and study reports by end of 2026:  
•  Bioaccumulation in fish (OECD TG 305); 
•  Adsorption-desorption using a batch equilibrium method (OECD 106) using 3 soil types and 2 types 
of sewage sludge; 
•  Ready biodegradability test (OECD 301); 
•  Aerobic and anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediment systems (OECD 308); 
•  Algal growth inhibition test (OECD 201); 
•  Daphnia sp. reproduction test (OECD 211, use version 2012); 
• 
•  Activated sludge, respiration inhibition test (OECD 209, use version 2010) 
Fish, Full Life Cycle Test (OECD 240); 
For all studies the original study report must be submitted. From all requested chronic toxicity studies 
and the OECD 209 test, a NOEC and/or EC10 is needed for the risk assessment. In case a limit test is 
performed, the OECD guidelines should be followed: if the limit test results in a statistically significant 
effect, a new test to determine a dose-response relationship should be performed, from which a NOEC 
and/or EC10 should be reported. 
If the outcome of the adsorption study (OECD 106) is that Koc >10,000 L/kg, a risk assessment for 
the terrestrial compartment is triggered, unless the compound is found readily biodegradable (OECD 
301). In case a terrestrial risk assessment is triggered, the following tests are required: 
•  Aerobic and anaerobic transformation in soil (OECD 307), 
•  Soil Micro organisms: Nitrogen Transformation Test (OECD 216), 
• 
Terrestrial plants, growth test (OECD 208, use version 2006), 
• 
Earthworm, acute toxicity tests (OECD 207), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023

•  Collembola, reproduction test (OECD 232). 
If significant shifting to the sediment is observed (more than 10% at any time-point at or after 14 days 
is present in the sediment) in the OECD 308 water:sediment simulation study (unless the compound is 
found readily biodegradable), effects on a sediment dwelling organism should be investigated and 
compared to the PECsediment. Applicable tests are those with: 
•  Hyalella sp; Lumbriculus sp. (OECD 225) or  
•  Chironomus sp. (OECD 218 or 219). 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data package evaluating the pharmacology and toxicity of elacestrant is considered 
acceptable to support the marketing authorisation taking into account the applicant’s commitment to 
conduct a study in MDR1-overexpressing cells with and without P-gp inhibitors to clarify whether 
elacestrant is a P-gp substrate (REC) and ERA commitments (REC). 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
In vitro, elacestrant showed low permeability across Caco-2 cells and was not a substrate of P-gp. 
Under fasted conditions, oral absorption of elacestrant was rapid (tmax ~ 4 hours) and the absolute 
bioavailability was approximately 10%. 
Following oral administration, elacestrant was rapidly absorbed, reaching Cmax within 1-4 hours. The 
geometric mean Cmax was 52.86 ng/mL (35.2% CV) and AUCinf was 1566 ng*h/mL (38.4% CV) after 
single dose administration of 345 mg of elacestrant in fed conditions. At steady state, the median 
[min, max] plasma concentration at 4h post-dose (C4h) and AUC are predicted to be 108 ng/mL [27.5 
– 351] and 2190 ng*h/mL [461 -8470], respectively (See SmPC section 5.2). 
Concentration-curves in single and multiple dose showed a second peak around 4-6 hours and also 
further peaks/shoulders at very late (>50 hours) time points. Enterohepatic recycling was ruled out 
because double peaks should be observed regardless of the route of administration. Specifically, for 
elacestrant, the secondary peaks were observed only after oral administration and not after 
intravenous administration. Later peaks most likely could result from an acidified microenvironment in 
the lower GIT that enhances late drug release and absorption. 
Elacestrant 100 and 400-mg commercial tablets and elacestrant 100 and 400-mg clinical tablets were 
shown to be bioequivalent.  
Administration of elacestrant 345 mg tablet with a high-fat high-calorie meal increased Cmax and AUC 
by 40% and 20%, respectively, as compared to fasted administration. When the tablet was co-
administered with a light meal, Cmax and AUC increased in a similar fashion, i.e., by 30 and 20%, 
respectively. Ingestion with food may reduce gastrointestinal side effects (See SmPC section 5.2). 
Distribution 
Elacestrant was highly bound to the proteins in human plasma (approximately 99%) and did not show 
the concentration dependence over the tested concentration range. 
Volume of distribution 
Elacestrant had a very large apparent volume of distribution of 11000-55000 L that appeared to be 
dose-dependent both at single and repeat dose, with a trend of decreasing Vz/F with increasing dose. 
After IV administration Vz was 1730 L. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, elacestrant is 
extensively distributed in the tissues with an apparent peripheral volume of distribution of 5411 L. The 
apparent central volume of distribution of elacestrant at steady state is 422 L (See SmPC section 5.2). 
B:P ratio 
Total blood and plasma drug-related radioactivity concentration ratios ranged from 0.607 to 0.794, 
indicating little to no association of radioactivity with blood cellular components. 
Penetration of blood brain barrier 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 75/197  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elacestrant was shown to penetrate the blood-brain barrier in a dose-dependent manner. After oral 
administration of elacestrant 200 mg QD or 500 mg QD for 7 consecutive days, median elacestrant 
total (bound and unbound) concentration in cerebrospinal fluid was 0.0966 ng/mL for the 200-mg dose 
group and 0.155 ng/mL for the 500-mg dose group. 
Variability 
Variability was moderate. There seems to be lower variability in women. High-fat seems to reduce 
variability more than low-fat meal, and mainly for Cmax. 
Elimination 
Faecal excretion was the predominant route of elimination for elacestrant (81.5%), with intact 
elacestrant representing 34%. Elimination with urine was minimal (7.53%). Based on the revised PBPK 
report, the fraction of drug absorbed from the gut (Fa) was estimated with 42.9%, the fraction of drug 
escaping first-pass metabolism in the gut (Fg) was 33 % and the fraction of drug escaping first-pass 
metabolism in the liver (Fh) was 37%. 
The arithmetic mean elacestrant t1/2 was approximately 30 hours after single oral administration and 
increased under multiple dosing up to ~47 hours, independently of dose. The t1/2 of elacestrant after 
single IV administration was 33.4 hours. In the mass-balance study plasma total radioactivity was 
~32-fold higher than plasma elacestrant AUC, for Cmax ~15-fold. The much longer t1/2 of the plasma 
radioactivity of 165 vs. 35 hours for plasma elacestrant concentration corroborated the large amount 
of circulating metabolites with slower elimination rate. 
Elacestrant renal clearance is very low (≤ 2.3 mL/min) and it was eliminated by oxidative metabolism 
and faecal excretion. 
In the final PopPK analysis, CL/F was 186 L/hour. Apparent clearance increased with increasing dose 
and was higher after multiple dose. It decreased in fed state compared to fasted. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
After single dose and at steady-state, Cmax and AUC increased in more than proportional manner. An 
approximate 2-fold accumulation was observed (for both Cmax and AUC) after 7 days of QD oral 
administration (Study RAD1901-001) in the dose range of 10 and 200 mg qd. After repeated oral 
administration, elacestrant CL/F and VZ/F appeared to be higher than after a single dose. The t1/2 also 
tended to be longer after repeated dosing (31 to 47 hours compared to approximately 30 hours). The 
tmax was similar after a single dose and at steady-state conditions (< 4 hours).

Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Table 20: Summary of the exposure metrics from Study RAD1901-308 for the E-R Analyses 
From only few PK samples in study 106 in mBC patients that were correlated with positive PD response 
at D14 from the 200 mg dose a minimal target plasma concentration of 20 ng/ml was derived. This 
value served as reference in the ER modelling. Simulation of exposure data for mutant vs. wt-ESR1 
patients in study 308 receiving 400 mg elacestrant showed comparable Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss and AUCss. 
Special populations 
No dedicated studies assessing relationship between race and PK of elacestrant exposure were 
submitted. Race was not formally assessed as a covariate in the population pharmacokinetics due to 
limited number of subjects other than Caucasian included in the clinical development. However, based 
on an exploratory analysis, which included PK data from Phase 1 and Phase 3 studies used for the 
popPK model development, i.e. 79% were Caucasian (N = 353), 5% were Black (N = 22), 4% were 
Asian (N = 17), 11% missing (N = 47), and 1% other (N = 8), no significant differences in exposure 
was observed among the different races. 
Boxplots of estimated exposure for different age/weight groups were within the observed range of 
exposures in Study 308 confirming that the extreme group of the eldest subjects (age > 89 years old, 
i.e., maximum age in popPK dataset) and with very low body weight (< 41.3 kg, i.e., minimum body 
weight in popPK dataset) did not have increased exposures to a clinically significant level.  
A dedicated study in subjects with hepatic impairment was submitted. After administration of 200 mg 
elacestrant, AUC increased with increasing severity of hepatic impairment. Elacestrant Cmax, AUC0–t, 
and AUC0–∞ geometric least squares mean ratios for the mild hepatic impairment group were higher. 
i.e. 11% (90% CI:0.95-1.28), 26% (90% CI:0.84-1.88), and 28% (90% CI:0.85-1.94), respectively, 
than those for the normal hepatic function group. 
Elacestrant Cmax, AUC0–t, and AUC0–∞ geometric least squares mean ratios for the moderate hepatic 
impairment group were higher, i.e. 14% (90% CI:0.89-1.45), 76% (90% CI:1.30-2.40), and 83% 
(90% CI:1.32-2.52), respectively, than those for the normal hepatic function group. 
The geometric mean t1/2 tended to increase with increasing severity of hepatic impairment, from 39.5 
hours in the normal hepatic function group to 46.4 and 54.3 hours in the mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment groups, respectively.  
To evaluate an impact of different degrees of hepatic impairment on PK of elacestrant, the applicant 
developed a PBPK model. The model predicted a 3.02-fold increase in AUC0-inf and a 1.88-fold 
Assessment report

increase in Cmax in subjects with severe hepatic impairment compared to the control group, after a 
single 400 mg dose. Based on the predictions of exposures following administration of 200, 300, and 
400 mg QD in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment at steady-state, the 
results and trends observed at 200, 300, and 400 mg QD were similar to those observed after a single 
dose of 200 mg. In PBPK modelling simulation of elacestrant at 345 mg, the steady state AUC and 
Cmax were predicted to increase by 2.14- and 1.92-fold, respectively, in subjects with moderate 
hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. Based on the PBPK model, no 
dose adjustment is required for subjects with mild hepatic impairment, whereas elacestrant dose 
should be reduced to 300 and 200 mg QD in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. 
No studies in patients with renal impairment were submitted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Elacestrant as a victim 
Elacestrant is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4.  
Study RAD1901-110 (with a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor) 
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole (200 mg once daily for 7 days) with 
Orserdu (172 mg once daily for 7 days) increased elacestrant plasma exposure (AUCinf) and the peak 
concentration (Cmax) in healthy subjects 5.3 and 4.4-fold, respectively. Physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations in cancer patients suggested that the concomitant administration 
of multiple daily doses of elacestrant 345 mg and itraconazole 200 mg may increase elacestrant 
steady-state AUC and Cmax 5.5- and 3.9-fold, respectively, which may increase the risk of adverse 
reactions. PBPK simulations in cancer patients suggested that concomitant administration of multiple 
daily doses of elacestrant 345 mg with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase elacestrant steady-
state AUC and Cmax by 2.3- and 1.9-folds, respectively, with fluconazole (200 mg once daily), and by 
3.9- and 3.0-folds, respectively, with erythromycin (500 mg four times a day), which may increase the 
risk of adverse reaction (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Study RAD1901-113 (with a CYP 3A4 inducer) 
Co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg once daily for 7 days) with a single 
dose of ORSERDU 345 mg decreased elacestrant plasma exposure (AUCinf) and the peak concentration 
(Cmax) in healthy subjects by 86% and 73%, respectively, which may decrease elacestrant activity. 
PBPK simulations in cancer patients suggested that the concomitant administration of multiple daily 
doses of elacestrant 345 mg and rifampicin 600 mg may decrease elacestrant steady-state AUC and 
Cmax by 84% and 77%, respectively, which may decrease elacestrant activity. 
PBPK simulations in cancer patients suggested that the concomitant administration of multiple daily 
doses of elacestrant 345 mg and the moderate CYP3A4 inducer efavirenz (600 mg) may decrease 
elacestrant steady-state AUC and Cmax by 57% and 52%, respectively, which may decrease elacestrant 
activity. 
Study RAD1901-115 (with a PPI) 
There was no significant effect on elacestrant exposure when elacestrant was co-administered with 
omeprazole. Elacestrant Cmax, AUC0–t, and AUC0–∞ geometric least squares mean ratios for 
elacestrant alone and elacestrant with omeprazole were all close to 1 and the 90% CIs were entirely 
contained within 0.80 and 1.25.

Elacestrant as a perpetrator 
Study RAD1901-114 (with another highly protein bound drug). 
Elacestrant Cmax, AUC0–t, and AUC0–∞ geometric least squares mean ratios for elacestrant alone and 
elacestrant with warfarin were all close to 1 and the 90% CIs were entirely contained within 0.80 and 
1.25, and there was no significant effect on R-warfarin exposure when warfarin was co-administered 
with elacestrant. R-and S-warfarin Cmax, AUC0–t, and AUC0–∞ geometric least squares mean ratios 
for warfarin alone and warfarin with elacestrant were all close to 1 and the 90% CIs were entirely 
contained within 0.80 and 1.25. 
Study RAD1901-118 (with a p-gp substrate and BCRP substrate) 
Digoxin Cmax, AUC0–t, and AUC0–∞ geometric least squares means were higher (27%, 13%, and 
10%, respectively) when digoxin was administered with elacestrant compared to when administered 
alone. The applicant concluded that the digoxin AUC0-∞ 90% CIs of the geometric least squares mean 
ratio were entirely contained within 0.80 and 1.25, and that for AUC0–t, the upper bound of the 90% 
CI was > 1.25. Further, the digoxin Cmax 90% CIs of the geometric least squares mean ratio did not 
contain 1 and the upper bound was > 1.25. 
Rosuvastatin Cmax, AUC0–t, and AUC0–∞ geometric least squares means were higher (45%, 23%, 
and 20%, respectively) when rosuvastatin was administered with elacestrant compared to when 
rosuvastatin was administered alone. For all 3 rosuvastatin exposure parameters, the upper limit of 
90% CI was > 1.25. 
PBPK simulations 
The applicant simulated mean plasma elacestrant concentrations following single oral doses of 200 or 
400 mg elacestrant in the absence of any perpetrator and on the 15th day of 28 days of dosing of 
itraconazole (200 mg QD, a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor) / fluconazole (200 mg QD, a moderate CYP 3A4 
inhibitor) / erythromycin (500 mg QID, a mechanism-based inhibitor) / cimetidine (400 mg BID, a mild 
CYP 3A4 inhibitor) to healthy subjects. Based on these simulations, the applicant concluded that co-
administration with itraconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin, or cimetidine leads to strong (>5-fold), 
moderate (>2-fold), moderate (>3-fold), and weak (1.1-fold) inhibition of elacestrant metabolism, 
respectively.   
The model was also used to predict the likely outcome of DDI with efavirenz (moderate CYP3A4 
inducer, 600 mg QD) following a single dose of elacestrant 400 or 800 mg. Efavirenz Indmax for 
CYP3A4 was scaled based on rifampicin Indmax of 8 to be 5.14. Prospective use of the model to 
predict the likely outcomes of interaction indicated decreases in elacestrant exposure with GMRs for 
AUC0-336h and Cmax of 0.452 and 0.561 at 400 mg. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Elacestrant, a tetrahydronaphthalene compound, is a potent, selective and orally active oestrogen 
receptor-α (ERα) antagonist and degrader (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
RAD1901-106: A phase 1b study to evaluate the effect of RAD1901 on the availability of 
oestrogen receptor biding sites in metastatic breast cancer lesions using 16α-18F-fluoro-17β-
oestradiol positron emission tomography imaging. 
Assessment report

This was a Phase 1b, open-label, non-randomized, multicentre, international, 2 dose cohort study in 
postmenopausal women with histologically-confirmed, ER+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
negative (HER2-) mBC. The study included postmenopausal women 18 years of age or older with 
histologically-proven ER+, HER2- inoperable and/or mBC, tumour progression after ≥6 months of at 
least 1 line of hormonal systemic treatment in the metastatic setting, with ECOG performance status 
0-2. Subjects had to have had ≤3 lines of endocrine therapy for metastatic disease. 
Results 
A total of 8 subjects were initially enrolled and treated with 400 mg elacestrant; a second cohort of 8 
subjects was subsequently enrolled and treated with 200 mg elacestrant for 14 days, after which the 
dose was escalated to 400 mg once daily (QD). Elacestrant was dosed QD continuously with 28-day 
treatment cycles. Fluoroestradiol-positron emission tomography (FES-PET) imaging was conducted at 
baseline and on Day 14. Response and progression were evaluated using RECIST v1.1 criteria. 
The primary endpoint was the percentage difference in Fluoroestradiol (FES) uptake in tumour lesions 
(up to a maximum of 20 lesions) after 14 days of treatment with elacestrant compared to baseline. 
Elacestrant reduced FES uptake from baseline to Day 14. Median reduction in FES uptake was 88.0% 
(range: 59% to 97%), showing target engagement. This reduction in FES uptake was similar in 
subjects with or without ESR1 mutations (data not shown). All but 1 subject in the 400 mg dose cohort 
(7/8; 87.5%) and 57% of subjects (4/7) in the 200/400 mg cohort obtained a greater than 75% 
reduction in FES uptake.  
ORR was 11.1% (1/9; partial response), CBR at 24 weeks was 30.8%, duration of response (DoR) was 
22 weeks, time to response was 7.9 weeks, and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.3 
months in the overall population. The single response was observed in the initial 400 mg dose group. 
No significant correlation was found between FES uptake and best overall response using Spearman’s 
rank correlation coefficient (0.2608 overall; p-value >0.5).  
Study 3882-0013: Elacestrant concentration-QTc modelling. QT Evaluation Report. 
Available time-matched PK and QT observations were obtained from multiple PK studies in healthy 
postmenopausal women and men, and from studies in postmenopausal women and men with 
advanced/metastatic breast cancer (RAD1901-105, RAD1901-106 and RAD1901-308) and used for the 
elacestrant plasma concentration-QTc analysis. Two PK studies (RAD1901-001 and RAD1901-004) 
included placebo treatment, all other studies only had screening and pre-dose QTcF observations 
without elacestrant administration. In addition, all studies had limited ECG sampling apart from studies 
RAD1901-001 and RAD1901-004 which had intensive ECG sampling. Overall, there was a total of 7016 
QT observations from 633 subjects available following placebo and elacestrant treatment for the 
concentration-QTc analysis. A total of 1863 (27%) were from placebo/pre-dose and 5153 (73%) were 
from post-initiation of elacestrant treatment. 
There was a similar percentage of placebo/pre first elacestrant dose and post first elacestrant dose 
QTcF observations >450 msec with 2.0% of placebo/pre first elacestrant dose (37 observations) and 
2.2% of post first dose QTcF observations (114 observations), respectively. Of the 114 QTcF 
observations >450 msec post first elacestrant dose, 62 (54%) were from Study RAD1901-005 and 
QTcF was similar prior to elacestrant and following elacestrant treatment indicating the higher QTcF 
values in this study were not a result of elacestrant treatment. There were five QTcF 
observations >480 msec following elacestrant treatment and 1 QTcF observation >500 msec.  
There was a similar percentage of placebo and elacestrant dQTcF observations >30 msec (2.4% and 
2.2%), respectively and there were only two dQTcF observations >60 msec.

Exploratory plots of dQTcF versus time-matched concentrations of elacestrant did also not indicate 
QTcF prolongation with increasing concentrations of elacestrant. This was further confirmed by the 
population concentration-QTcF modelling which showing only a slight positive relationship (p=0.00694) 
with increasing concentrations of elacestrant. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of elacestrant is considered overall adequately investigated. Based on low 
solubility and low permeability elacestrant is considered a BCS class IV drug substance. The low BA of 
10% questions the development of an oral immediate-release formulation for elacestrant drug 
substance which is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 and prone to be glucuronised and sulfatised at the 
OH-group.  
Initially the applicant proposed that elacestrant could be taken without regard to food based on popPK 
modelling and disregarding the slightly higher exposure observed with high-fat compared to low-fat 
meals. However, in the Phase 3 Study RAD1901-308, elacestrant was administered with a light meal 
and the applicant claimed that improved gastrointestinal tolerability has been observed when tablets 
were taken with food (study RAD1901-116). Also, variability of all PK parameters was decreased after 
intake in fed state vs. fasted state which is deemed supportive of a recommendation in fed state to 
stabilise exposure. Therefore, the product should be recommended to be taken accordingly, i.e. with 
food.  
PK data from 4 studies with capsule formulation (used in early development) had been used in a 
preliminary popPK. No formulation effect between capsule and tablet formulations was found 
significant so that similar bioavailability between capsule and final FCT formulation can be concluded. 
 No dose adjustment seems to be necessary for different age, body weight groups and gender. No 
studies in patients with renal impairment were submitted (See discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Studies in subjects with renal impairment are waived since renal excretion of elacestrant is minimal 
and creatinine clearance was found to have no effect on elacestrant clearance in the popPK model. The 
PBPK model is considered adequate to predict elacestrant dose and time-dependent PK and therefore 
to evaluate the impact of hepatic impairment on pharmacokinetics of elacestrant.  
Overall, the Cmax and AUC values were similar between subjects in the mild hepatic impairment group 
(Child-Pugh A) and the normal hepatic function group upon single dose administration of elacestrant 
176 mg. There were significant increases in AUC0–t (76%) and AUC0–∞ (83%) in the moderate 
hepatic impairment group (Child-Pugh B) compared to the normal hepatic function group. The Cmax 
values were similar between the normal and moderate impairment groups. The geometric mean 
elimination half-life (t1/2) tended to increase with increasing severity of hepatic impairment. 
Elacestrant has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (See SmPC 
section 5.2). 
Based on the PBPK model, no dose adjustment is required for subjects with mild hepatic impairment, 
whereas elacestrant dose should be reduced to 300 mg for subjects with a moderate hepatic 
impairment, which is acceptable. 
Regarding severe hepatic impairment, since no clinical data is available in this subpopulation, the 
applicant is recommended to perform a post-approval clinical study to assess the effect of severe 
hepatic impairment on elacestrant PK in order to provide dose recommendations for this population 
(REC). The final study report submission is planned in June 2026.  
In vitro, elacestrant is a substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter OATP2B1 and thus drug-drug 
interactions with OATP2B1 inhibitors cannot be excluded. The possible clinical relevance of interactions 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 81/197  
 
 
 
 
between OATP2B1 inhibitors and elacestrant (as a victim) has been included in the product information 
(See SmPC section 4.5). 
The concomitant use of elacestrant with CYP3A4 inhibitors was investigated and the relevance of the 
design / chosen doses was discussed: for elacestrant, as a drug with dose-dependent PK, a therapeutic 
dose of 400 mg should have been used instead of 200 mg; for itraconazole, the highest generally 
recommended dose under therapeutic conditions, i.e. 200 mg bid, should have been used instead of 
200 qd. However, the choice of the reduced dose of 200 mg for elacestrant was based on the safety 
considerations in order to avoid exposing healthy volunteers to unnecessary and unacceptable 
toxicities. In addition, the dose of 200 mg QD of itraconazole provided sufficient inhibition of CYP3A4 
while avoiding an increased potential for adverse events with the drug. Furthermore, the PBPK model 
was used to simulate mean plasma elacestrant concentrations at steady-state following 200 or 400 mg 
QD doses in the absence or presence of 200 mg of itraconazole to mimic the clinical situation. Hence, 
the chosen dose for elacestrant is considered acceptable. Furthermore, considering that trough 
concentrations had not quite reached its PK steady state by the end of the 7-day coadministration 
phase for both substances, exposures of the perpetrator itraconazole were sufficiently high for studying 
the DDI with elacestrant and published literature supported different doses and study designs to 
adequately study drug interactions with itraconazole.  
The proposed dose adjustments regarding concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors 
were adequately justified, taking into account that the PBPK model was considered acceptable and 
suitable for conclusions on the integrated DDI/PBPK model strategy performed by the applicant. That 
no dose adjustments are required for coadministration with mild CYP3A4 inhibitors was also adequately 
justified by the popPK exposure data from the pivotal study (See SmPC section 4.2). 
The concomitant use of elacestrant with CYP3A4 inducers was also investigated. It is unclear from this 
single-dose study how the effect size of a strong or moderate inducers would affect steady-state 
treatment exposure. Nevertheless, the PBPK model and the integrated approach proposed to 
investigate DDI of elacestrant from studies and PBPK is generally accepted. Although no dose 
adjustments for coadministration with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers are proposed, increasing 
the dose of elacestrant for coadministration with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers despite an 
adequate plasma exposure of elacestrant in terms of efficacy is not recommended because of the 
increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events. In addition, if short term or intermittent use of strong 
or moderate CYP3A4 inducers is necessary, the expected lowering of elacestrant exposure will, in 
essence, be similar to the exposure associated with elacestrant short term dose reduction because of 
adverse events. Based on the provided simulations, the duration of concomitant treatment should be 
reduced to ≤ 3 days for strong CYP3A4 inducers in order to prevent concentrations dropping below the 
previously described efficacious threshold of 20 ng/mL. Although for moderate CYP3A4 inducers a 
longer duration might be possible, the duration for the use of moderate inducers should be also ≤ 3 
days to avoid confusion for the practitioners (See SmPC section 4.2). 
No dose adjustment for concomitant intake with weak CYP 3A4 inducers is considered required. This is 
based on an exploratory analysis performed using elacestrant final population PK model to derive 
individual elacestrant steady state PK parameters Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss and AUCtau,ss based on the observed 
plasma concentrations for each patient in the Phase III Study RAD1901-308. The comparison of the 
Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss and AUCtau,ss distributions for these patients taking weak CYP3A4 inducers compared with 
patients not taking CYP3A4 inducers did not reveal significant differences. In vitro, elacestrant showed 
a potential for inhibition of the intestinal P-gp and BCRP. Elacestrant is also a highly protein bound 
drug. The systemic DDI risk for CYP3A4 inhibition by elacestrant is low. Elacestrant is not expected to 
inhibit CYP3A4 activity at clinically relevant concentrations up to the exposure obtained at the 
therapeutic dose of 400 mg QD of elacestrant dihydrochloride (345 mg elacestrant). Concomitant use 
of elacestrant with other P-gp substrates or with other BCRP substrates may increase their

Page 82/197  
 
 
 
 
concentrations, which may increase the adverse reactions associated with the P-gp substrates or BCRP 
substrates. The dose of coadministered P-gp substrates or BCRP should be reduced according to their 
SmPC.  
Primary pharmacology: Study RAD1901-106 (106) was a phase 1b study to evaluate the effect of 
RAD1901 on the availability of oestrogen receptor binding sites in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) 
lesions using 16α-18F-fluoro-17β-oestradiol positron emission tomography imaging. PET-FES can be 
used for whole-body evaluation of tumour ER expression and previous studies showed a reduction in 
ER availability measured by FES uptake for fulvestrant. (Van Kruchten et al, Cancer Discovery, 2015). 
Study 106 showed that both doses of 400 mg and 200 mg reduced FES uptake in tumour lesions at 
day 14, indicative of reduced levels of ER expression upon elacestrant treatment and supporting the 
mechanism of action. However, a lower proportion of patients in the 200/400 mg dose obtained a 
≥75% reduction in FES uptake (200 mg minimal recommended dose upon dose reduction due to 
adverse events).  Based on the combined PK and PD results from this study the concentration at which 
a greater than 75% reduction in FES uptake was observed was geometric mean Cmin at Day 14 (i.e. 
20 ng/mL) and this was utilised as the target mean Cmin for target engagement. 
With regards to target engagement, while some in vitro tests suggested selectivity to mutant ESR1 
over wt-ESR1 other pre-clinical tests did not (see non-clinical aspects).  
The proposed indication has been narrowed to breast cancer patients with ESR1 mutations. In section 
5.1 of the SmPC targeted mutations have been defined as those in the ligand binding domain. 
In patients, elacestrant was observed to penetrate the blood-brain barrier in a dose-dependent 
manner, with median elacestrant total (bound and unbound) concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid of 
0.0966 ng/mL for the 200 mg dose group and 0.155 ng/mL for the 500-mg dose group. A weak 
agonistic activity of elacestrant, i.e. reduction in LH levels, was observed in ovariectomised rats. 
However, no similar effects were observed in humans. Moreover, elacestrant could exert the effect on 
LH levels at peripheral (pituitary) rather than at CNS level (hypothalamus). In addition, elacestrant 
concentrations in patients (considering interindividual variability) will be sufficiently high to elicit the 
expected antagonistic effect.  
Secondary pharmacology: No dedicated QTc study was submitted which is acceptable based on the 
non-clinical data and that there is no indication of a class-effect based on what is known for 
fulvestrant. Slight trends toward longer QTcF and toward decreased QTcF change from baseline were 
observed with increasing elacestrant plasma concentrations. Data suggested that oral elacestrant 
doses of up to 1000 mg daily (2.5× the anticipated therapeutic dose of 400 mg) did not adversely 
affect cardiac repolarisation, although there were few data points at higher exposure. Nevertheless, it 
is considered there is no signal for QTc prolongation based on the totality of data.  
Exposure-Response relationship: There was no clear relationship between PFS and elacestrant 
exposure, as represented by the average daily AUC (AUCav). Logistic regression analysis did not 
indicate a higher probability of clinical benefit with increasing exposure (AUCav) of elacestrant. The 
clinical relevance of CBR is however limited as PFS was the primary endpoint of the phase 3 study. 
Exposure-Safety relationship: Logistic regression analysis did not indicate a higher probability of 
first occurrence of nausea with increasing exposure (Conc4h) of elacestrant. The odds ratio and 
associated 95% CI for Conc4h included the null value of 1 and the p-value was not statistically 
significant (p<0.001). However, the exposure response analysis is limited as majority of patients 
received 400 mg. 
In the initial exposure-safety response analysis (MENA-PMX-RAD1901-3863), the number of subjects 
was very limited, i.e. 32 with only 5 subjects displaying any drug-related AE. Mean AUC, Cave, Cmin, 
Assessment report

and Cmax of RAD1901 in patients with “All AEs” were 52-65% higher than those without AEs. 
Considering a very low number of subjects included, the results should be interpreted with caution.  
In the final exposure response analysis, the nominal steady state AUC(0-24) for the patients in Study 
RAD1901-308 were overlaid on the logistic curves of (i) the probability of clinical benefit rate and 
overall response vs AUC and (ii) the probability SAE, Grade 3 AEs and AEs leading to study 
discontinuation vs AUC obtained in a preliminary analysis based on efficacy and safety data from Phase 
1 studies RAD1901-005 and RAD1901-106. The probability of experiencing any type of severe AEs 
increased for doses higher than 400 mg QD, while in the range of exposures observed in Phase 3 
RAD1901-308 study this probability did not increase markedly, remaining below 50%. The probability 
of clinical benefit (CB) and OR seems to be decreasing with a higher AUC, which is not explained (see 
2.6.6. clinical efficacy discussion, for a more detailed discussion). 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Elacestrant is a SERD that can be orally administered. Doses of 400 mg and, to a lesser extent, 
200 mg reduced FES uptake in tumour lesions after 14 days of treatment, indicative of reduced levels 
of ER expression upon elacestrant treatment and supporting the mechanism of action. The proposed 
indication was narrowed to patients with ESR1 mutations, which is endorsed.  
There was no clear relationship between PFS and elacestrant exposure. Logistic regression analysis did 
not indicate a higher probability of first occurrence of nausea with increasing exposure (Conc4h) of 
elacestrant; however, modelling for other AEs suggest a positive exposure-correlation. 
The CHMP recommended to perform a clinical PK study in non-cancer patients to evaluate the effect of 
severe hepatic impairment on elacestrant pharmacokinetics to provide dose recommendations in this 
patient group (REC). Final report expected: June 2026. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Elacestrant has been evaluated for efficacy in 2 Phase 1 studies and a randomized Phase 3 pivotal 
study (Table 19). The results from these studies informed the selection of the recommended 
elacestrant dose and the design of the subsequent Phase 3 Study RAD1901-308 (see Table 19). 
The recommended dose is 345 mg (one 345 mg film-coated tablet), once daily, with food. The 
quantitative declaration of active moiety corresponding to 400 mg of the elacestrant dihydrochloride 
salt is 345.13 mg of elacestrant free base. Therefore, the posology of 400 mg will be referred to in the 
rest of the report.

Study RAD1901-005: A phase 1, multicentre, open-label, multipart, dose-escalation study of 
RAD1901 in postmenopausal women with advanced oestrogen receptor positive and HER2-
negative breast cancer.  
Study design 
This was a Phase 1, multicentre, open-label, multi-part, dose-escalation study to determine the 
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of elacestrant in subjects

with ER+/HER2- mBC. Secondary objectives included evaluating the PK of elacestrant and an 
exploratory assessment of pharmacodynamics. 
The study consisted of 4 parts: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Part A: to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, and preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of 
elacestrant in a 3 + 3 dose-escalation phase using capsules 
Part B: a safety expansion phase at the RP2D using capsules 
Part C: to evaluate the tablet formulation administered at the RP2D 
Part D: to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, and preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of 
elacestrant tablet formulation at the RP2D of 400 mg QD in a population of subjects with more 
homogeneous anticancer therapies. 
Parts A, B, and C included postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- mBC who had received 2 or fewer 
chemotherapy regimens with progression after at least 6 months of endocrine therapy. Part D included 
postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2- mBC with at least 2 lines of prior endocrine therapy, 
including prior fulvestrant and prior treatment with a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor. 
Subjects in Part A were treated with elacestrant 200 mg QD, 400 mg QD, or 600 mg QD. All subjects 
in Parts B, C, and D were treated with 400 mg QD. Upon confirmation of the RP2D (400 mg QD), 
subjects enrolled at lower doses in Part A were permitted to have their dose escalated to RP2D. The 
study was terminated prior to completion of enrolment of the Part D cohort due to a change in 
corporate strategy. Treatment cycles were of 28 days per cycle. 
Results 
The RP2D was determined to be 400 mg QD. Of 57 postmenopausal women enrolled, 50 received the 
RP2D (400 mg QD: 26 capsules, 24 tablets). Median age was 63 years, median 3 prior anticancer 
therapies including CDK4/6 inhibitors (52.0%), SERD (52.0%), and ESR1 mutation (circulating tumour 
DNA; 50.0%). No dose-limiting toxicities occurred; the most common adverse events at RP2D (400 mg 
tablet; n = 24) were nausea (33.3%) and increased blood triglycerides and decreased blood 
phosphorus (25.0% each). Most adverse events were Grade 1 to 2 in severity. Although no dose-
limiting toxicities were reported per-protocol, the 600 mg dose was deemed not tolerable due primarily 
to gastrointestinal events. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and constipation was higher in subjects 
who received the 600 mg dose (67% to 100%) compared with those who received the 400 mg dose 
(17% to 65%). The 400 mg dose, which was associated with fewer gastrointestinal events, was 
selected as the RP2D for the subsequent clinical studies. An overall summary of adverse events (Table 
21) and the incidence of gastro-intestinal events (Table 22) are shown below.

The objective response rate (ORR) was 19.4% (n = 31 evaluable subjects receiving the RP2D), 15.0% 
in subjects with prior SERD (n = 3 out of 20), 16.7% in subjects with prior CDK4/6 inhibitor (n = 3 out 
of 18), and 33.3% in subjects with ESR1 mutation (n = 5 out of 15).

2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
RAD1901-308: Elacestrant monotherapy vs. standard of care for the treatment of 
patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer following CDK4/6 inhibitor 
therapy: a phase 3 randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre trial 
(EMERALD) 
Methods 
Study 308 (Figure 8) was an international, multisite, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, 
event-driven, Phase 3 clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of elacestrant versus standard of 
care (SOC) therapy (fulvestrant or AI) in postmenopausal women and men with ER+/HER2- mBC 
whose disease has relapsed or progressed on at least 1 and no more than 2 prior lines of endocrine 
therapy for mBC, which must have included CDK4/6i therapy in combination with fulvestrant or an AI. 
Subjects must have received no more than 1 line of cytotoxic chemotherapy for mBC. Endocrine 
monotherapy with 1 of the SOC drug options (fulvestrant, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) must 
have been an appropriate treatment option for subjects enrolled in this study.

Subjects who met any contraindication, according to the respective PI or Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC), for any SOC drug that the investigator would choose for that subject 
should the subject be randomized to the SOC group 
ESR1 mutation status assessment 
Blood samples for circulating tumour deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) analysis were analysed using the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Guardant360 (Guardant Health) assay to determine 
ESR1 mutational status. The Guardant360 assay uses digital sequencing technology to detect all 
missense nucleotide variants within the ligand-binding domain of the ESR1 gene. Detection of any 
ESR1 mutation(s), as defined by Guardant Health for the assay, was reported as ESR1 mutation 
present (i.e., ESR1-mut) (see section 2.6.5.4. . The designation of ‘No ESR1 mutation detected’ 
(ESR1-mut-nd) was assigned if there was no mutation present in the ESR1 gene (i.e., wild-type) or if 
the mutation status is unknown (ESR1 mutations outside biomarker definition). ESR1 test results were 
used for stratification at randomisation; however, the site was not provided with a subject’s mutational 
status during the subject’s active treatment phase, unless otherwise required by regulation. Results 
were provided to sites semi-blinded (i.e., coded as Group A or Group B) for randomisation.  
•  Treatments 
For subjects randomized to the control group, the investigator was to select 1 of the available SOC 
options based on the individual subject’s prior treatment history and the investigator’s judgment. Sites 
were required to select the investigator's choice of the control arm during the Screening Phase. This 
was entered into the Integrated Response Technology (IRT) system by the Investigator at the 
screening visit prior to randomisation.  
The following SOC options were available for subjects randomized to this treatment group: 
• 
Fulvestrant: 500 mg administered IM into the buttocks as two 5 mL injections on Cycle 1 Day 1 
(C1D1), C1D15, C2D1, and Day 1 of every subsequent 28-day cycle 
•  Anastrozole: 1 mg QD orally on a continuous dosing schedule 
• 
Letrozole: 2.5 mg QD orally on a continuous dosing schedule 
•  Exemestane: 25 mg QD orally on a continuous dosing schedule 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 92/197  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The investigator was to select 1 of the available SOC options according to what was appropriate based 
on the individual subject’s prior treatment history and the investigator’s judgment, considering the 
following general guidance: 
•  Subjects who had not previously received fulvestrant should be treated with fulvestrant (unless 
there was a known contraindication). 
•  Subjects who progressed on prior fulvestrant should be treated with an AI. 
•  The selection of an AI should be based on prior AI therapy and any known contraindications, as 
follows: 
− 
If the subject had previously progressed on a nonsteroidal AI (anastrozole or letrozole) but not 
received exemestane, the preferred option would be exemestane. 
− 
If the subject had previously progressed on exemestane but not received a nonsteroidal AI, the 
preferred option would be a nonsteroidal AI. 
For subjects randomized to the elacestrant group, 400-mg tablets were administered orally QD by the 
subjects on an outpatient basis and at study visits. 
Dose reductions of elacestrant due to adverse events were allowed in this study. Dose levels could be 
reduced to 300 mg QD (3 × 100 mg tablets) and, subsequently, to 200 mg QD (2 × 100 mg tablets) 
representing 25% and 50% dose reductions from the 400 mg QD starting dose, respectively. Dose 
reductions below 200 mg QD were not allowed and, if required in the opinion of the Investigator, the 
subject was to discontinue treatment. Once a dose has been reduced, it could not be re-escalated. No 
dose escalations above the starting dose of 400 mg QD were permitted. 
Dose reductions for subjects receiving AIs were not allowed, as per the prescribing information of 
these drugs. Dose reductions for subjects receiving fulvestrant were permitted for subjects who 
developed moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) if deemed unrelated to study drug or 
disease progression, for whom the dose of fulvestrant should be reduced to 250 mg. 
Dose interruptions of elacestrant and SOC treatment of ≤14 consecutive days were permitted. A dose 
interruption of >14 consecutive days required discussion with the Sponsor prior to resuming study 
treatment. For all subjects, 1 treatment cycle was 28 days. 
Crossover from any treatment group or therapy to another was not allowed while participating in the 
study. 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate that elacestrant, compared with SOC 
(fulvestrant or AI), is superior in prolonging PFS based on blinded IRC assessment in postmenopausal 
women and men with ER+/HER2- mBC, either in ESR1-mut subjects or in all subjects (ESR1-mut + 
ESR1-mut-nd). The key secondary objective was to compare OS between treatment groups in ESR1-
mut subjects and in all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd). 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Definition of endpoints 
Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of randomisation until the date 
of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression). 
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death due to any 
cause. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 93/197  
 
 
 
 
 
IRC-assessed ORR was defined as the percentage of subjects whose best overall response (BOR) was 
either CR or PR, where BOR was derived using blinded IRC assessment following the RECIST v1.1 
criteria. For each subject, BOR could be 1 and only 1 of the following: CR, PR, SD, PD, and not 
evaluable (NE), with derivation using the order of CR > PR > SD > PD > NE. Additionally, the response 
of CR or PR required confirmation at least 4 weeks after the initial documentation of the response. 
Duration of response (DoR) was defined as the duration from the first response until disease 
progression or death from any cause. 
Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as the proportion of subjects who had confirmed complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) any time during the study or stable disease (SD) that lasted at 
least 24 weeks (including disease assessments performed up to a week earlier than the scheduled 
date).  
Primary endpoints 
The primary endpoints of the study were: 
• 
• 
IRC-assessed PFS in ESR1-mut subjects 
IRC-assessed PFS in all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd) 
In order to control the family-wise Type I error rate, the truncated Hochberg procedure was used. The 
selection of this procedure allowed for alpha to pass along from the analyses of the primary endpoint 
of PFS to the analyses of the key secondary endpoint of OS (Dmitrienko et al 2011, Hochberg 1988).  
Key secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoints of the study were: 
•  OS in ESR1-mut subjects 
•  OS in all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd) 
Other secondary endpoints 
The following endpoints were analysed for ESR1-mut-nd subjects: 
• 
IRC-assessed PFS 
•  OS 
The following endpoints were analysed for ESR1-mut subjects, ESR1-mut-nd subjects, and all subjects 
(ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd): 
•  Local investigator-assessed PFS 
• 
• 
• 
IRC-assessed ORR

•  Local investigator-assessed ORR 
•  Local investigator-assessed DoR 
•  Local investigator-assessed CBR 
The following endpoints were assessed for ESR1-mut subjects and all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-
mut-nd): 
•  Safety and tolerability: AEs, SAEs, dose modifications, clinical laboratory parameters (i.e., 
haematology, chemistry, and coagulation), ECGs, ECOG performance status, and vital signs 
•  Pharmacokinetics: Evaluation of elacestrant concentrations at predose (pretreatment) and 4 hours 
postdose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), predose (trough concentration [Ctrough]) and 4 hours 
postdose on C1D15, and predose (Ctrough) on C2D1 
•  Patient-reported outcome endpoints: Assessed using the HRQOL scales EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-
C30, and PRO-CTCAE 
Exploratory endpoints 
The following exploratory objectives were planned to be assessed in all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-
mut-nd), ESR1-mut subjects, and ESR1-mut-nd subjects: 
•  To determine the difference between treatment groups in time to chemotherapy, defined as the 
number of days from randomisation to initiation of chemotherapy 
•  To evaluate alterations in ctDNA relevant to ER+ breast cancer and the CDK4/6 pathway and to 
explore the relationship between these findings and clinical response 
•  To characterize alterations in tumour-specific genes, proteins, and RNAs related to oncogenic 
pathways and proliferation and cell cycle markers in tumour tissue and the relationship between 
these findings and clinical response. 
Efficacy assessments 
Tumour assessments were performed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) from the date of randomisation during 
the active treatment phase of the study and assessed per RECIST v1.1. PROs were also assessed in 
conjunction with tumour assessments. 
Subjects with bone lesions identified by radionuclide bone scan or whole-body magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) at baseline underwent repeat bone scans or whole-body MRI performed every 24 weeks 
(± 7 days) from the date of randomisation and at the time of confirmation of a complete response 
(CR). All assessments were to be performed as scheduled at the required intervals according to the 
Schedule of Assessments, regardless of any dosing delay, to prevent the introduction of bias into the 
assessment of efficacy. 
Tumour assessments, including standardized photography of superficial lesions, were to be performed 
until radiographically and/or clinically documented (i.e., for photographed or palpable lesions) disease 
progression per RECIST v1.1, initiation of new anticancer therapy, or discontinuation from overall 
study participation, whichever occurred first. 
Subjects who discontinued study treatment for reasons other than radiographically and/or clinically 
documented disease progression, per RECIST v1.1, were to continue to have tumour assessments 
performed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) in the follow-up period, and bone scans or whole-body MRI (as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023

applicable) as clinically indicated and/or every 24 weeks (± 7 days) until RECIST-defined disease 
progression, initiation of the first new anticancer therapy, or discontinuation from overall study 
participation (e.g., death, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up), whichever occurred first. 
Subjects no longer undergoing tumour assessments were to continue to be monitored every 8 weeks 
for survival and for the initiation of the first new anticancer therapy. The follow-up period was to 
conclude at the time of the final OS analysis when approximately 50% of subjects in the study have 
died. 
•  Sample size 
It was estimated that approximately 466 subjects (220 ESR1-mut; 246 ESR1-mut-nd) would be 
enrolled in the study in a 1:1 randomisation. 
Among the ESR1-mut subjects, the study required approximately 160 PFS events to have a power of 
80% to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.610 at the 2-sided alpha level of 2.5%. The sample size 
estimate assumed a median PFS of 5.3 months for the SOC treatment group and 8.7 months for the 
elacestrant treatment group, an increase of approximately 3.4 months among the ESR1-mut subjects. 
The assumption of median PFS of 5.3 months for the SOC treatment group was based on available 
data at that time related to the efficacy of fulvestrant as a second/third line treatment in the following 
pivotal clinical trials: 
•  EFECT (Chia et al, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2008): Fulvestrant was administered at a dose of 
500 mg on Day 0, 250 mg on Days 14 and 28, and 250 mg monthly thereafter. Median PFS on 
fulvestrant monotherapy: 3.7 months. 
•  BELLE-2 (Baselga et al, Lancet Oncology, 2017): Fulvestrant was administered at a dose of 500 mg 
on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles. Median PFS on fulvestrant 
monotherapy: 5.0 months. 
•  PALOMA-03 (Cristofanilli et al, Lancet Oncology, 2016): Fulvestrant was administered at a dose of 
500 mg on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles. Median PFS on 
fulvestrant monotherapy: 4.6 months. 
Among all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd), a total of approximately 340 PFS events had 92% 
power to detect a HR of 0.667 at the 2-sided alpha level of 2.5%. The 2-sided alpha level of 2.5% for 
sample size calculation was selected to ensure that at least 1 of the 2 primary efficacy endpoints would 
pass the Hochberg procedure to control the overall alpha level at 5.0%. 
Among all subjects (ESR1-mut and ESR1-mut-nd), the study was to have 60% power to detect a 
hazard ratio of 0.75 for OS at a 1-sided alpha level of 2.5%. Assuming a median OS of 25 months for 
the SOC treatment group, this hazard ratio represents a median OS of 33 months for the elacestrant 
treatment group. This calculation also accounts for 1 interim analysis at an information fraction of 0.4 
with an alpha spending equal to 0.0001 at the interim analysis. 
Approximately 114 OS events were expected among the ESR1-mut subjects at the time of the second 
analysis of OS. With 114 OS events, the study was to have 39% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.73 
at a 1-sided alpha level of 2.5%. Assuming a median OS of 28 months for the SOC treatment group, 
this treatment effect represents a median OS of 38 months for the elacestrant treatment group, an 
increase of approximately 10 months among the ESR1-mut subjects. This calculation also accounts for 
1 interim analysis at an information fraction of 0.4 with an alpha spending equal to 0.0001 at the 
interim analysis. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 96/197  
 
 
 
 
 
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either elacestrant or SOC with randomisation 
stratified by the following: 
•  ESR1 mutation status (detected [ESR1-mut] vs not detected [ESR1-mut-nd]) 
• 
• 
Prior treatment with fulvestrant (yes vs no) 
Presence of visceral metastases (yes vs no); visceral includes lung, liver, brain, pleural, and 
peritoneal involvement 
Given the role of ESR1 mutations in endocrine resistance (Chandarlapaty et al, JAMA Oncology, 2016; 
Dustin et al, Cancer, 2019; Nardone et al, The Breast, 2015; O’Leary et al, Cancer Discovery, 2018), 
ESR1 mutation status was selected as one of the stratification factors, and the trial was powered to 
detect significant improvements in PFS in this group of patients. The decision to include prior therapy 
with fulvestrant (yes vs no) was taken as elacestrant shares a similar mechanism of action to 
fulvestrant (i.e., ER degradation). Presence of visceral metastases is recognized to be associated with 
poor prognosis and poor clinical outcome. 
This was an open-label study as one of the study treatment options was administered via IM 
injections; thus, study subjects and investigators were not blinded to treatment assignment. To 
minimize bias in study conduct, personnel performing statistical analyses, including biostatisticians and 
programmers, were blinded to treatment assignments and aggregated data by treatment assignment 
until after database lock. Contract research organisation study team members and select Sponsor 
team members were not blinded to an individual subject’s treatment assignment during the conduct of 
the study but were blinded to aggregated data by treatment assignment until after database lock. 
At the time of study conduct, Radius was the sponsor. Parexel was the CRO in charge of study conduct 
and data management activities and Cytel was the CRO responsible for the statistical analysis. The 
process of managing access to treatment information was documented in a blind Management Plan 
(final version dated 01 February 2021). An independent central Imaging Review Committee (IRC), 
blinded to subjects’ treatment assignments, reviewed radiographic images and clinical information 
collected on-study to determine the endpoints of disease response and progression. 
Unblinded safety and efficacy data based on local investigator and IRC assessment and OS were 
reviewed at prespecified intervals by the IDMC. An unblinded statistician at the contract research 
organisation performed all analyses in preparation for the IDMC evaluations. 
Potential risks of the open-label study design were recognized during the design of the study, and 
processes were implemented to reduce the potential for bias in study conduct and analysis. Regarding 
the data transfer from Parexel to Cytel, Parexel defined two distinct procedures: one for the blinded 
and another for the unblinded database transfer. As defined by specific Data Transfer Agreements, 
detailing who would receive data and what content was provided. Files were transferred to approved 
recipients via Parexel Secure File Transfer Protocol (sFTP) system. The dedicated team in Cytel 
reviewed data transfers from Parexel to confirm unblinded data. The first unblinded database was 
received by Cytel on 11 October 2021 after the 08 October 2021 interim database lock. Table 23 
reports the list of attachments that demonstrates the above-described process.

•  Statistical methods 
The study was of superiority design. Analyses of the primary endpoints were performed based on 
assessments by the blinded IRC. Analyses based on investigator assessment were also performed as 
supportive analyses. Efficacy data were reviewed at prespecified intervals by an Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (IDMC), as per the IDMC charter. An interim analysis for futility was performed 
by the IDMC at the time when approximately 70% enrolment had been achieved. The IDMC’s 
recommendation was to continue the study unmodified. 
The final PFS analysis was planned to be performed when approximately 160 PFS events (objective 
disease progression assessed by the blinded IRC or death) among the ESR1-mut subjects and 340 PFS 
events among all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd) had occurred. OS analyses were planned to be 
conducted at the same time as the final PFS analysis, and again when approximately 50% of subjects 
have died at which time the study will be considered complete. 
Analysis populations for efficacy 
Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Population: The ITT population included all randomized subjects. This was 
the primary population for PFS and OS analyses. Subjects were analysed according to their randomized 
treatment assignment. 
Per-Protocol (PP) Population: The PP population included all randomized subjects who did not have 
any major protocol deviations that may confound the interpretation of the primary analyses conducted 
on the ITT population. The PP population was used to perform sensitivity analyses for the primary 
efficacy endpoint of PFS if the primary endpoint was statistically significant. Subjects were analysed 
according to their randomized treatment assignment. 
Response-Evaluable (RE) Population: The RE population included all ITT subjects who had 
measurable disease (i.e., at least 1 target lesion) at baseline and at least 1 postbaseline RECIST 
assessment on any (target or nontarget) lesions and/or had a new lesion. 
Clinical-Benefit-Evaluable (CBE) Population: The CBE population included all ITT subjects who had 
measurable and/or evaluable disease (i.e., target and/or nontarget lesions) at baseline and at least 1 
postbaseline RECIST assessment on any (target or nontarget) lesions and/or had a new lesion. 
Analysis methods 
The SAP was finalized before database lock and unblinding. 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics included the number of subjects, mean, standard 
deviation, median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum, and maximum. For categorical 
variables, descriptive statistics included the number of subjects, frequency counts, and percentages. 
The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method was used to estimate the survival distribution function of PFS. The 
following summaries by treatment group were provided: median PFS and 95% confidence interval (CI), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 98/197  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q1 and Q3 and 95% CI, PFS rates and 95% CI at Months 3, 6, and 12 (and every 6 months thereafter 
until the end of follow-up or no more subjects are at risk). 
Primary endpoints 
PFS was defined as the duration (in months) from the date of randomisation to the earliest date of 
documented disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause. 
For subjects without objective disease progression or death, PFS was censored on the date of the last 
adequate tumour assessment or, if no tumour assessment was performed after the baseline visit, at 
the date of randomisation. Detailed censoring rules are described in Table 24. 
Table 24: Rules for censoring date of progression or censor for Imaging Review Committee-
assessed progression-free survival 
The difference in the primary endpoints between the treatment groups was to be analysed using a 
logrank test stratified by the factors used to stratify the randomisation. The HR and its 95% CI were to 
be estimated using the stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model with the Efron method of 
handling ties, stratified by the factors used to stratify the randomisation. The CIs for the HRs were to 
be constructed using the profile likelihood method. KM methods were to be used to display the time-
to-event graphs and estimate the median event times and their 95% CIs, Q1 and Q3 and their 95% 
CIs, and the rates at Months 3, 6, 12, and 18 and their 95% CIs. The CIs for the medians, quartiles, 
and rates were to be constructed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley (Brookmeyer and 
Crowley 1982) via linear transformation. The primary analyses included the randomisation strata as 
the stratification factors.  
The following sensitivity analyses were to be performed: 
Sensitivity Analysis 1 (Actual event PFS analysis): In this analysis, PFS events recorded after 
missing 2 or more consecutive tumour assessments will be included as events, with the PFS event date 
defined as the actual event date after the 2 missed tumour assessments. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 99/197  
 
 
 
 
 
Sensitivity Analysis 2 (Backdating PFS analysis): In this analysis, PFS events recorded after missing 
2 or more consecutive tumour assessments will be included as events, with the PFS event date defined 
as the date of the next scheduled tumour assessment after the last adequate tumour assessment. 
Sensitivity Analysis 3 (Unstratified analysis): As a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of 
stratification (obtained from eCRF), the 2 treatment groups will be compared using the unstratified log-
rank test. The HR together with the associated 95% confidence interval obtained using the unstratified 
Cox regression model will also be presented. 
Sensitivity Analysis 4 (COVID-19 analysis): To assess potential COVID-19 impact, if subjects died 
due to COVID-19 infection without PD, PFS date will be censored at the death date. Analysis of PFS will 
be performed in the same manner as the primary efficacy analyses if at least 5% of deaths are due to 
COVID-19 infection. 
Sensitivity Analysis 5 (Per-Protocol Population analysis): This analysis will be performed based on PP 
population in the same manner as the primary efficacy analyses if the primary endpoints are 
statistically significant. 
In addition, Restricted Mean Survival Time Analysis (RMST) was to be performed. The RMST 
methodology is independent of the proportional hazards assumption and can be used as a 
supplemental analysis to explore the robustness of the primary analysis results. The restricted mean 
survival time is a measure of average survival from time 0 to a specified time point (τ) and is 
estimated as the area under the survival curve up to that point. Tau was 29.17 both for ITT and 
ESR1-mut patients and 25.89 for ESR1-mut-nd patients. 
Key secondary endpoints 
Analyses of OS in all subjects and in ESR1-mut subjects were to be performed using the ITT 
population. 
The KM method was to be used to estimate median survival times, which were to be displayed with the 
survival curve. The Cox regression model that includes treatment and the stratification factors was 
used to estimate the HR and its 95% CI. The difference between treatment groups was to be analysed 
using the stratified log-rank test. 
A sensitivity analysis for OS was to examine the censoring patterns to rule out attrition bias with 
regard to the treatment comparisons, achieved by a Kaplan-Meier plot of time to censoring where the 
censoring indicator of OS is reversed. 
RMST analysis was also to be provided for the key secondary endpoints in a similar manner as IRC-
assessed PFS. 
Other secondary endpoints 
Analyses of IRC-assessed PFS and OS in ESR1-mut-nd subjects were to be performed using the ITT 
population for the ESR1-mut-nd subjects, in the same manner as the analyses of the primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Local investigator-assessed PFS was to be analysed in the same manner as IRC-assessed PFS. 
IRC-assessed ORR was to be summarized using the RE population (defined based on IRC assessment) 
for ESR1-mut subjects, ESR1-mut-nd subjects, and all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd). The ORR 
was to be summarized as a binomial response rate with 95% CIs based on the ClopperPearson 
method. Comparison between treatment groups was to be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test adjusting for randomisation stratification factors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 100/197  
 
 
 
 
IRC-assessed DoR was to be summarized using the RE population (based on IRC assessment) who 
achieved confirmed CR or PR based on the blinded IRC review for ESR1-mut subjects, ESR1-mut-nd 
subjects, and all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd).  
IRC-assessed CBR was to be summarized using the CBE population (based on IRC assessment) for 
ESR1-mut subjects, ESR1-mut-nd subjects, and all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd). The IRC-
assessed CBR was to be analysed in the same manner as the analysis of ORR. 
In addition, local investigator-assessed ORR CBR, and DoR were to be analysed in the same matter as 
the IRC-assessed endpoints. 
Patient-reported outcomes 
Analyses of the PROs were to be performed using the ITT population for ESR1-mut subjects and all 
subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd). For each set of study subjects, the PRO endpoint values and 
changes from baseline by visit were to be summarized by treatment group. 
Exploratory endpoints 
Time to chemotherapy was to be summarized by treatment group descriptively for the subjects who 
received chemotherapy as first systemic therapy after treatment discontinuation. 
The other exploratory objectives, including changes in ctDNA and exploration of the relationship 
between these findings and clinical response, were to be analysed. 
Handling of dropouts or missing data 
The handling of missing dates was only described in the SAP for AE events and start of post-treatment 
systemic anti-cancer therapy. Missing data in PFS and OS were to be handled by censoring. In ORR 
these were to fall in the NE= not evaluable category and for the PROs the handling of missing data was 
to be defined in the questionnaires themselves. 
Multiple comparisons/Multiplicity 
To ensure the family-wide error rate does not exceed 5%, multiplicity adjustments were to account for 
the analyses of 2 primary endpoints, 2 key secondary OS endpoints, and the analyses of the key 
secondary OS endpoints at 2 time points. The multiplicity correction between the two timepoints for OS 
were to be done using the Haybittle-Peto method. 
During the study, the OS analysis plan was changed with the addition of the formal test at the time of 
the primary PFS analysis.  
A parallel gatekeeping strategy based on the truncated Hochberg procedure (Dmitrienko et al, Journal 
of Biopharmaceutical Statistics, 2011) was to be used to control the family-wise type I error rate at 5% 
(2-sided) and to allow alpha to pass along from the analyses of the primary endpoint of PFS to the 
analyses of the key secondary endpoint of OS. The chosen truncation fraction is 0.9, resulting in 
=0.0475 and 
= 0.025.

(both populations). A full alpha of 0.05 will be passed along to OS. To control for the analyses of 
OS at the 2 time points, the alpha level of 0.05 will be distributed across the 2 time points. A 2-

alpha level of 0.0499 will be allocated at the time of the final OS analysis. This alpha splitting is 
according to a Haybittle-Peto rule. At each time point, OS will be evaluated using the conventional 
Hochberg procedure and the allocated alpha to control for the multiple testing associated with the 
2 populations.

be passed along to OS only in the population in which PFS is significant. To control for the 2 
different times the OS analysis will be conducted, the alpha level of 0.0025 will be distributed 
across the 2 time points. An alpha level of 0.0001 will be allocated at the time of the primary PFS 
analysis and an alpha level of 0.0024 will be allocated at the time of the final OS analysis. 
If the larger p-value is ≥0.0475 and the smaller p-value is ≥0.025, no statistical significance will 
be claimed for PFS. In this case, no alpha will be passed along to OS. No claim regarding OS will be 
made. 
No statistical significance can be claimed for any endpoints other than the primary and key secondary 
endpoints. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses of IRC-assessed PFS, OS, ORR, DoR, and CBR were to be performed in the same 
manner as the analyses using the ITT population for all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd) and for 
ESR1-mut subjects only for the following stratification factors: 
• 
• 
Prior treatment with fulvestrant (yes vs no) 
Presence of visceral metastasis (yes vs no) 
Subgroup analyses of IRC-assessed PFS, OS, ORR, DoR, and CBR were to be performed in the same 
manner as the analyses using the ITT population for all subjects (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd) and for 
ESR1-mut subjects only by the following categories: 
•  Age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years) 
•  Age (< 75 years vs ≥ 75 years) 
•  Race (Caucasian vs Asian vs Other) 
•  Region (Europe, North America, Asia, Other) 
•  Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (0 vs 1) 
•  Measurable disease at baseline (yes vs no) 
•  Number of prior lines of endocrine therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting (1 vs 2) 
•  Number of lines of chemotherapy in the advanced/metastatic setting (0 vs 1) 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
Overall, this study screened 695 subjects who granted informed consent for participation and 
randomized 478 subjects to treatment with either elacestrant or SOC. Of the 217 (31.2%) subjects 
who did not pass screening, 204 (29.4%) were excluded for failure to meet eligibility criteria, 10 
(1.4%) due to withdrawal of consent, 2 (0.3%) due to the investigator’s decision, and 1 (0.1%) due to 
significant noncompliance. Among the 204 patients who did not pass the screening for “failure to meet 
eligibility criteria”, the most common reasons (>10% incidence) were inclusion criterion number 8 
(prior treatment with 1-2 lines of endocrine therapy) in 30 (13.8%) patients and inclusion criterion 
number 13 (adequate organ function) in 39 (18.0%) patients. For 58 (26.7%) patients, a reason was 
not specified. The disposition of all subjects is shown in Figure 9. 
Among all subjects, randomisation was equal to each group (239 elacestrant, 239 SOC). As of the DCO 
date (06 September 2021), 18 subjects (7.5%) in the elacestrant group and 6 subjects (2.5%) in the 
SOC group were still on treatment. Most subjects discontinued treatment (91.6% elacestrant, 93.7%

SOC). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was investigator-assessed progression 
per RECIST criteria (77.4% elacestrant, 74.5% SOC). 
Among ESR1-mut subjects, randomisation was equal to each group (115 elacestrant, 113 SOC). As of 
the DCO date (06 September 2021), 12 subjects (10.4%) in the elacestrant group and 3 subjects 
(2.7%) in the SOC group were still on treatment. Most subjects discontinued treatment (89.6% 
elacestrant, 91.2% SOC). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was investigator-
assessed progression per RECIST criteria (70.4% elacestrant, 77.9% SOC).

progression. Contrary to the protocol guidance, the investigator opted to assign the patient to fulvestrant in 
the control arm. The patient received the treatment at Cycle 1 Day 1 and at Cycle 1 Day 15 and then 
discontinued trial therapy because of disease progression also on Cycle 1 Day 15.

•  Recruitment 
Subjects were enrolled in 17 countries at 150 of the 224 study sites initiated. The first patient was 
enrolled on 10 May 2019. The last patient last visit was not reached, as the study was ongoing as of 
the clinical data cut at 06 September 2021. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Study amendments 
All references in this report to the study protocol refer to version 6.0 unless otherwise stated. 
Version 1.0 of the study protocol was dated 06 August 2018. Versions 2.0 through 4.0 of the protocol 
were issued in quick succession (see  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 104/197  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 26). Version 4.0 (dated 22 August 2018) was the first protocol version under which subjects 
were recruited. The first patient was enrolled on 10 May 2019. After version 4.0, a further 2 global and 
several corresponding local protocol versions were issued. Versions 1.0 through 3.0 are not considered

Global changes from version 4.0 to version 5.0 
The ESR1-WT population planned for some secondary analyses was changed to the ESR1-mut-nd 
population, the latter including subjects with no mutation detected as well as subjects with an 
unknown mutation status. Changes were made to study objectives and to the inclusion criteria 
reflecting this. 
Prior fulvestrant treatment was only permitted > 42 days prior to the first dose of study drug, rather 
than > 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug as under version 4.0. Women with hormonally-
induced menopause were excluded from the study. Subjects who discontinued a prior endocrine 
therapy due to toxicity without progression were excluded from the study. Subjects were required to 
have progressed during or within 28 days after completion of a line of prior combination therapy, 
including a CDK4/6i. 
The inclusion criterion for cytotoxic chemotherapy was updated (see inclusion criterion 10). 
Willingness to provide a tissue sample was removed as an inclusion criterion; this instead became an 
optional assessment, and an associated inclusion criterion was removed. 
Renal function criteria were updated to include assessment by eGFR as an option alongside creatinine 
clearance. The requirement for male subjects to be on hormonal suppression was removed. Subjects 
with a Child-Pugh score of > 6 were excluded. 
Response Evaluable and CBR Evaluable populations were added. An interim futility analysis at 70% 
enrolment was added.

Global changes from version 5.0 to version 6.0 
This amendment provided clarification for inclusion and exclusion criteria, tumour and bone lesion 
assessments, prohibited medications (bisphosphonates and RANKL inhibitors except if on a stable 
dose), the Schedule of Events, provided details on the planned futility analysis, and expanded the list 
of inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 by adding moderate inhibitors and inducers. 
Protocol deviations 
Major protocol deviations were defined as a deviation from the basic requirements of the study 
protocol, including main inclusion and exclusion criteria; concomitant medication restrictions; dosing 
(i.e., outside of ± 20% prescribed dose of study drug); or any protocol requirements that resulted in a 
significant added risk to the study subject, had an impact on the quality of the data collected, or had 
an impact on the outcome of the study. This definition was included in the latest SAP version 1.1. The 
final classification of the deviations into major or minor was performed after database lock. Major 
protocol deviations are shown in Table 27 and were not included in the modified PP analysis. Most 
subjects had a minor deviation related to procedures/tests.

In addition to the 17 patients with major protocol deviations, minor protocol deviations were reported 
in 472 (98.7%) patients. Of the 478 patients on study, 138 unique patients (71 elacestrant, 67 SOC) 
reported to have minor deviations involving either I/E criteria only (total 90 patients, elacestrant 
treated=48 patients and SOC treated=42 patients), ICFs only (total 37 patients, elacestrant=18 
patients, SOC=19 patients) or both I/E criteria and ICF deviations (total 11, elacestrant=5 patients, 
SOC=6 patients). 
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on study conduct and evaluation 
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the conduct of this study. Challenges led to issues such as 
quarantines, site closures and restrictions, travel limitations, and interruptions to the supply chain of 
investigational products. These challenges may have led to difficulties in sites adhering to protocol-
specified visits and/or procedures, including administration of investigational products. Overall, 89 
subjects had an average of 2.1 visits impacted. Almost all impacted visits (79 of 89 impacted visits) 
were either partially executed at site or by an alternative method. No subjects discontinued from the 
study due to the impact of COVID-19.

•  Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
The median age of patients (elacestrant vs standard of care) at baseline was 63.0 years (range of 24-
89) vs 63.5 (range of 32-83) and 45.0% were over 65 (43.5 vs 46.6). Among all subjects, there were 
6 males (2.5%) in the elacestrant group and 1 male (0.4%) in the SOC group. All of the male subjects 
had ESR1-mut-nd status. All female subjects (N=471) were postmenopausal. All but 1 subject had an 
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. The last subject had an ECOG = 1 at the time of screening and 
was considered eligible for randomisation. At the Cycle 1 Day 1 visit, the ECOG = 2.

Table 30: Baseline demographic and disease characteristics – ESR1-mut patients (ITT 
population) 
Baseline disease characteristics are shown in Table 29 and Table 31. The median time since initial 
diagnosis in all groups was between 4.92 and 6.28 years. Most subjects (65.3%) had ductal tumour 
histology. Metastatic sites were most commonly in the bone (78.9% [bone only: 14.0%]), liver 
(49.6%), lymph nodes (28.5%), and lung (26.23). Brain metastases were uncommon and was 
reported in 7 patients in total (1.5%).

In the ESR1-mut group, 1 subject did not have an ESR1-mut as per local assessment but was mis-
stratified. The central laboratory later identified 2 additional subjects as having no ESR1-mut. All other 
subjects had at least 1 ESR1-mut. 
There were two patients reported without ER-positive disease (1 in each treatment arm), see Table 31. 
One patient had missing ER status, however, per a query in the eCRF, the site later confirmed that this 
patient was considered ER+ based on Allred score that resulted in 8/8 and met inclusion criteria. For 
the other patient no pathology report was available for ER, PR, or HER2 per the eCRF. Per data queries 
the investigator reported the patient was ER+ due to prior tamoxifen use. Of note, all randomized 
patients at baseline, had at least 1 lesion (target or non-target) outside the breast, that is, metastatic, 
which indicates that the M status for all randomized patients at baseline was M1.

Prior systemic anticancer therapies 
Prior systemic anticancer therapy is shown in Table 32. Consistent with the inclusion criteria, all 
subjects had at most 1 line of chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic disease and either 1 or 2 lines of 
endocrine therapy in the advanced or metastatic setting. 
For all subjects, in any setting, prior AI therapy was reported for 235 subjects in the elacestrant group 
and 231 subjects in the SOC group. The median duration of AI therapy was 25.0 months (range 2 to 
164 months) in the elacestrant group and 24.3 months (2 to 154 months) in the SOC group. Similar 
proportions and durations of therapy were observed for ESR1-mut subjects. All subjects had prior 
CDK4/6i therapy in any setting.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
In Study 308, both primary endpoints of PFS in all subjects and in ESR1-mut subjects were met. 
Although the protocol specified that the final PFS analysis would be conducted when 160 events of 
objective disease progression (based on IRC assessment) or death had occurred among the ESR1-mut 
subjects and 340 events had occurred among all subjects, the final PFS analysis was actually 
conducted when there were 140 and 300 events, respectively (Table 34). The decision to modify the 
plan was based on a blinded PFS event projection analysis prior to database lock and unblinding. 
To help plan the dates for database lock and the final PFS analysis, projections of the total numbers of 
IRC-assessed PFS events and their timing were estimated based on the total number of events that 
had accrued at the time of the projection analysis. These projections were calculated approximately 
monthly when data were transferred from Parexel the (Contract research organisation (CRO) in charge 
of running the study and also for Data Management activities to Cytel (contractor vendor for 
biostatistics activities). These projections were based on analyses using events pooled across the 2 
treatment arms without regard to treatment. 
The latest projection of IRC-assessed PFS events used the IRC PFS data transfer date of 19 July 2021. 
The analysis showed the median PFS of 3.70 in the all-patient population and 4.08 in the ESR1-mut 
population were each less than the median PFS of 5.3 used in the sample size calculations. The higher-
than-expected rate of censoring and the number of patients still on treatment on 19 July 2021 
indicated the protocol planned number of IRC-assessed PFS events (340) was unlikely to be achieved 
even in a year’s time and a decision was therefore made to lock the database on 08 October 2021 
based on a cut-off date of 06 September 2021. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 115/197  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The decision was made with the knowledge that PFS analyses, with approximately 300, instead of 340 
events, would achieve 90% power to detect the pre-planned HR of 0.67 among all patients, and 
approximately 75% to 80% power to detect the pre-planned HR of 0.61 in the ESR1-mut patient 
population if the last patient was enrolled in late August 2021 and 07 October 2021 was the database 
lock date. 
This study was ongoing as of the clinical data cutoff date of 06 September 2021. The results present 
the final analysis for the primary endpoints of PFS in all subjects and in only ESR1-mut subjects. Since 
OS data were not mature at the time of the interim analysis (data cutoff [DCO] date: 
06 September 2021), additional post hoc analyses were conducted to explore the estimated probability 
of success at the time of the final OS analysis. 
The final analysis of OS was made once 50% of subjects enrolled in the study have died (DCO: 02 
September 2022). 
Primary endpoint: Progression-free survival (blinded IRC assessment) 
The analysis of the blinded IRC assessment of PFS is shown in Table 34 and landmark analysis in Table 
35. 
In all subjects, PFS was statistically significantly improved in subjects randomized to elacestrant 
compared to SOC (p = 0.0018, stratified log-rank test). The HR was 0.697 (95% CI: 0.5520-0.880), 
that is, a 30% reduction in the hazard of progression or death relative to the control arm. The median 
PFS was 2.79 months in the elacestrant group versus 1.91 months in the SOC group. 
In ESR1-mut subjects, PFS was statistically significantly improved in subjects randomized to 
elacestrant compared to SOC (p = 0.0005, stratified log-rank test). The HR was 0.546 (95% CI: 
0.387-0.768), that is, a 45% reduction in the hazard of progression or death relative to the control 
arm. The median PFS was 3.78 months in the elacestrant group versus 1.87 months in the SOC group. 
The higher p-value was < 0.0475; thus, both primary objectives were met with statistical significance 
under the multiplicity correction methods used for this study. 
A KM plot of PFS is shown in Figure 10 (for all subjects) and in Figure 11 (for ESR1-mut subjects).

Key secondary endpoint: Overall survival 
At the time of the DCO date (06 September 2021), an interim analysis for OS was performed. An 
updated final analysis was provided during the procedure with data cut-off date 02 September 2022. 
At the 06 September 2021 DCO, a total of 57 subjects were censored for overall survival due to 
withdrawal of consent, physician decision, or lost to follow-up. All sites were contacted. The vast 
majority of the sites refused to give updated survival information or were non-responsive. 
The interim analysis used an alpha level of 0.0001 to control the overall Type I error rate of 5%. 
Results from this interim analysis of OS are shown in Table 36 and landmark analysis in Table 37. 
• 
• 
In all subjects, the HR for death was 0.742 (95% CI: 0.536-1.025). At an alpha level of 0.0001, the 
difference in OS between the elacestrant and SOC groups was not statistically significant 
(p = 0.0697, stratified log-rank test). A KM plot of OS for all subjects is shown in Figure 12. 
In ESR1-mut subjects, the HR for death was 0.592 (95% CI: 0.361-0.958). At an alpha level of 
0.0001, the difference in OS between the elacestrant and SOC groups was not statistically 
significant (p = 0.0325, stratified log-rank test). A KM plot of OS for ESR1-mut subjects is shown in 
Figure 13. 
Among all subjects, 30 (12.6%) in the SOC group compared to 18 (7.5%) in the elacestrant group 
were censored due to withdrawal of consent. A majority of subjects in all groups were censored as still 
alive at DCO.

Progression-free survival (investigator assessment) 
Discordance was observed in progression between the IRC and investigator assessments in both 
cohorts (Table 41). Kaplan-Meier plots for investigator assessment of PFS are shown below for all 
subjects (Figure 17) and ESR1-mut subjects (Figure 18). 
Among all subjects, 62 subjects (32.6%) in the elacestrant group and 42 subjects (22.7%) in the SOC 
group were assessed as having PD by the investigators (and will have therefore discontinued 
treatment) but were not yet considered to have PD by the IRC at the time of assessment of PD by the 
investigator. In the PFS analysis, these subjects will either be counted as “censored without 
progression” or, if they subsequently died, to have had a PFS event at the time of death. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023

Among all subjects, 14 subjects (9.9%) in the elacestrant group and 11 subjects (7.1%) in the SOC 
group were assessed as having PD by the IRC but will have continued treatment in the absence of an 
assessment of PD by the investigators. 
The analysis of PFS investigator assessment is shown in Table 42 and landmark analysis in Table 43. 
In all subjects, the HR for PFS assessed by the investigators was 0.769 (95% CI: 0.625-0.945), 
stratified log-rank test p = 0.0097. 
In ESR1-mut subjects, the HR for PFS assessed by the investigators was 0.647 (95% CI: 
0.477-0.876), stratified log-rank test p = 0.0049.

Objective response rate 
The ORR as assessed by the blinded IRC in the RE population is shown in Table 44. No subjects had a 
CR. For ESR1-mut-nd subjects, the ORR was 2.1% in the elacestrant group and 4.2% in the SOC 
group. There was no statistically significant difference in ORR between elacestrant and SOC for any 
cohort (all subjects, ESR1-mut subjects, or ESR1-mut-nd subjects). 
The RE population was smaller than the ITT population, partly due to the exclusion of subjects with 
bone-only disease who cannot be classified per RECIST into the response categories shown here. 
Overall, fewer than 5% of subjects in the RE population were not evaluable. Reasons for non-
evaluability included not having a postbaseline assessment, and diagnosis of clinical progression by the 
investigator prior to the first postbaseline radiological assessment.

Clinical benefit rate 
The CBR as assessed by the blinded IRC in the CBE population is shown in Table 45. There were no 
subjects with confirmed CR, so the CBR consists of subjects with any BOR of PR or BOR of SD 
sustained for at least 24 weeks. Among ESR1-mut-nd subjects, the CBR was 13.3% in the elacestrant 
group versus 15.3% in the SOC group.

The median DoR as assessed by the blinded IRC could not be calculated in the elacestrant group for 
either cohort of subjects, as all such subjects were censored without progression or death.

EORTC QLQ-C30 
The completion rate for the EORTC QLQ-C30 remained above 70% until Cycle 2 Day 1, but is below 
50% after visit Cycle 4 Day 1. There were no noteworthy differences between the treatment groups 
and no noteworthy changes over time in either group, either for all subjects or ESR1-mut subjects 
based on the mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of quality of life through Cycle 6 
according to the Applicant. 
PRO-CTCAE 
There were no noteworthy differences between the treatment groups and no noteworthy changes over 
time in either group for change from baseline in frequency, severity, or interference for any treatment-
emergent adverse event, either for all subjects or ESR1-mut subjects. 
Time to chemotherapy 
Among all subjects, chemotherapy as first systemic therapy after treatment discontinuation was 
recorded for approximately half of the subjects. In the elacestrant group, 114 subjects received 
chemotherapy after treatment discontinuation (47.7%). In the SOC group, 120 subjects received 
chemotherapy after treatment discontinuation in the SOC group (50.0%). In the ESR1-mutated 
population the proportion receiving chemotherapy after treatment discontinuation was 43.5% and 
52.2%, in the elacestrant and SOC arm, respectively. 
The mean (SD) time to chemotherapy was similar in the elacestrant and SOC groups, at 111.0 (70.14) 
days and 97.8 (67.28) days, respectively. Subjects with ESR1-mut had a time to chemotherapy of 
105.8 (63.04) days in the elacestrant group and 102.8 (71.31) days in the SOC group. Subjects with 
ESR1-mut-nd had a time to chemotherapy of 115.0 (75.46) days in the elacestrant group and 92.9 
(63.36) days in the SOC group. Some subjects may have received therapy other than chemotherapy 
as their first post-study therapy. Time from randomisation to first new anti-cancer therapy in the

•  Ancillary analyses 
Restricted mean survival time (RMST) 
In all patients, restricted mean survival time (RMST) was 7.54 (SE 0.85) in the elacestrant arm and 
5.18 (SE 0.50) in the SOC arm. RMST difference was 2.36 (95% CI: 0.59-4.13), p-value 0.0088. 
For ESR1-mutated patients, restricted mean survival time (RMST) was 9.25 (SE 1.15) in the 
elacestrant arm and 5.17 (SE 0.87) in the SOC arm. RMST difference was 4.08 (95% CI: 1.57-6.59), 
p-value 0.0015. 
Subgroup analyses 
Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted and displayed by forest plot for all subjects (Figure 21) 
and ESR1-mut subjects (Figure 22).

Post hoc supportive analysis of the primary endpoint 
Additional post hoc supportive analyses were conducted for PFS comparing elacestrant to fulvestrant 
and AIs. 
Elacestrant versus fulvestrant: 
Among all subjects, 166 out of 239 subjects (69%) received fulvestrant as the SOC treatment in this 
study, and the HR for this analysis was 0.684 (95% CI: 0.521-0.897). The IRC-assessed PFS estimates 
at the various time points are presented below. 
At 3 months: 49.75% in the elacestrant group versus 40.86% in the SOC group 
At 6 months: 34.32% in the elacestrant group versus 22.86% in the SOC group

and the HR for this analysis was 0.779 (95% CI: 0.520-1.172). Median PFS was 2.79 months (95% CI: 
1.94-3.78) in the elacestrant group and 1.87 months (95% CI: 1.87-2.20) in the AI group. The 
IRC-assessed PFS estimates at the various time points are presented below. 
At 3 months: 49.75% in the elacestrant group versus 35.04% in the AI group 
At 6 months: 34.32% in the elacestrant group versus 13.35% in the AI group 
At 12 months: 22.32% in the elacestrant group versus 6.67% in the AI group 
At 18 months: 16.82% in the elacestrant group versus “data not available” in the AI group 
Among ESR1-mut subjects, 30 out of 113 subjects (27%) received an AI, and the HR was 0.659 
(95% CI: 0.320-1.329). Median PFS was 3.78 months (95% CI: 2.17-7.26) in the elacestrant group 
and 2.14 months (95% CI: 1.87-3.75) in the AI group. The IRC-assessed PFS estimates at the various 
time points are presented below. 
At 3 months: 55.93% in the elacestrant group versus 46.17% in the AI group 
At 6 months: 40.76% in the elacestrant group versus 12.31% in the AI group 
At 12 months: 26.76% in the elacestrant group versus “data not available” in the AI group 
At 18 months: 24.33% in the elacestrant group versus “data not available” in the AI group

Updated efficacy analyses with data cut-off date 02 September 2022:  PFS 
An update of the PFS analyses with a data cut-off date of 02 September 2022, providing approximately 
one additional year of data, was conducted. At that time only 7 additional PFS events were observed, 
leading to a total of 307 events, relative to the original cut-off date of 06 September 2021. The 
following tables show the results of the updated PFS analysis for all patients and ESR1-mut patients, 
based on a cut-off date of 02 September 2022. At this cut-off, median follow-up in the study was 20.4 
months for all patients and for ESR1 mut patients. For PFS median follow-up was 24.0 months.

In order to investigate the impact of the discordance between the IRC and investigator assessments of 
PFS, the applicant performed sensitivity analyses in which both investigator-assessed and blinded ICR-
assessed progressions are counted as events for all patients (Table 57) and ESR1-mut patients (Table 
58).

The results for the three additional post hoc analyses were: 
• 
Interval censored analysis: In all subjects, the median PFS was 3.15 months for elacestrant and 
1.31 months for SOC and the HR was 0.695 (95% CI: 0.551-0.876). In ESR1-mut subjects, the 
median PFS was 3.75 months and 0.49 months for the elacestrant and SOC groups, respectively 
and the HR was 0.519 (95% CI: 0.368-0.731). 
•  Analysis without censoring for new systemic anticancer therapies: In all subjects, the 
median PFS was 2.79 months for elacestrant and 1.94 months for SOC and the HR was 0.710 
(95% CI: 0.565-0.891). In ESR1-mut subjects, the median PFS was 3.78 months and 1.87 months 
for the elacestrant and SOC groups, respectively and the HR was 0.545 (95% CI: 0.389-0761). 
•  Analysis with PFS events dated at the next planned visit in case of unscheduled 
assessment: In all subjects, the median PFS was 3.55 months for elacestrant and 1.91 months 
for SOC and the HR was 0.697 (95% CI: 0.552-0.879). In ESR1-mut subjects, the median PFS was 
3.78 months and 1.87 months for the elacestrant and SOC groups, respectively and the HR was 
0.538 (95% CI: 0.380-0.756). 
Upon CHMP request, the applicant provided additional analyses to determine the robustness of the PFS 
results concerning the PFS HR stability over time, start of new anticancer treatment, and early 
censoring. 
PFS HR stability 
Confirmation of HR stability could be done retrospectively by calculating HR at different cut-off dates. 
During the conduct of the study, pooled blind data were periodically downloaded and reviewed in order

to monitor the event accrual rates and to project the time necessary to collect the required number of 
events (Table 60). Analyses in unblinded fashion were performed only recently in order to respond to 
to provide the PFS at different cut-off dates.

Progression is determined according to assessment by blinded IRC. PFS is defined as the time from the date of 
randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of 
progression).For subjects without objective disease progression or death, PFS will be censored according to 
SAP Section 4.7.1.1. 
[1] Date of last tumor assessment before missed assessments or date of randomization, whichever is later. 
[2] Calculated using Kaplan-Meier technique. CI for 25th, 50th (median) and 75th percentiles of PFS are derived 
based on the Brookmeyer-Crowley method using a linear transformation. 
[3] The analysis was performed using a stratified Cox Proportional Hazards model with ties= Efron and the 
stratification factors:ESR1-mutational status (ESR1-mut vs ESR1-mut-nd), prior treatment with fulvestrant 
(yes vs no) and presence of visceralmetastases (yes vs no); the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach. 
[4] The p-value was generated by using a two-sided stratified log-rank test. 
Note:. For patients that started a new anticancer therapy prior to death or a disease progression, the start of new t
herapy is considered as an event.

Progression is determined according to assessment by blinded IRC. PFS is defined as the time from the date of 
randomization until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression). 
For subjects without objective disease progression or death, PFS will be censored according to SAP Section 4.7.1.1. 
[1] Date of last tumor assessment before missed assessments or date of randomization, whichever is later. 
[2] Calculated using Kaplan-Meier technique. CI for 25th, 50th (median) and 75th percentiles of PFS are derived 
based on the Brookmeyer-Crowley method using a linear transformation. 
[3] The analysis was performed using a stratified Cox Proportional Hazards model with ties = Efron and the 
stratification factors: prior treatment with fulvestrant (yes vs no) and presence of visceral metastases (yes vs no); 
the CI calculated using a profile likelihood approach. 
[4] The p-value was generated by using a two-sided stratified log-rank test. 
Note: For patients that started a new anticancer therapy prior to death or a disease progression, the start of new th
erapy is considered as an event.

Early censoring 
During the first 2 months after randomization, the KM curves show 92 (31.9%) censored subjects. The 
numbers are relatively balanced among the two treatment arms with 40 (30.1%) subjects in the 
elacestrant arm and 52 (33.5%) subjects in the SOC arm. Later censoring is higher in the elacestrant 
arm (55 (52%) subjects) vs the SOC arm (31 (37%) subjects) reflecting the fact that patients in the 
elacestrant arm stay longer in treatment with no progression. Reasons for IRC-censoring during the 
first 2 months after randomization are reported in the following tables.

The applicant performed a tipping point analysis following two different approaches: 
•  Approach 1: 
All patients censored within the first 2 months were considered as events. Then +1 day was added 
incrementally to the date of the event for those patients in both groups at each analysis run. A hazard 
ratio of 1 was never reached, even after adding 10000 days (HR = 0.79 for ALL patients, and HR = 
0.577 for ESR1-mut). It was concluded that even such an unlikely deviation would still keep the results 
statistically significant in favor or elacestrant. 
•  Approach 2: 
To perform the tipping point analysis, censored patients were turned into events for the elacestrant 
arm only (representing the worst-case scenario), sorting the patients by time to censoring (ascending 
order). 
When all the first 40 censored patients were transformed into the event, the HR still favours the ELA 
(HR of 0.923 in all subjects and 0.808 in ESR1-mut patients). The process then continued by 
transforming into events one by one all the remaining patients censored with a PFS time greater than 
2 months. 
The tipping point was found to be between 55 and 60 for the all-patient population, while in the 
ESR1-mut population HR never reaches 1.0 even when all the censored patients in the elacestrant arm 
are turned into events (maximum HR equal to 0.929).

The planned sensitivity analysis examining censoring patterns for OS showed results that were not 
significantly different for the elacestrant arm when compared to the SOC arm in both all patients and 
patient with ESR1 mutation. In terms of Kaplan-Meier curves the differences were not indicative for 
any systematic difference in timing of censoring that would be considered of clinical relevance for the 
ESR1-mut population which is the focus of the indication. 
Post hoc analysis: Overall survival modelling 
To understand the probability of success for the OS endpoint when the final analysis is conducted at 
approximately 239 deaths in all subjects, 2 post hoc approaches were used to estimate the expected 
power for this final OS analysis. The first approach was a conditional power estimation to calculate the 
expected power based on the number of deaths observed at the DCO date (06 September 2021) 
(Gao et al, Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics, 2008). This approach estimated the power to be 
65.6% for all subjects and 90.4% for ESR1-mut subjects. The second approach to estimating power 
was based on modelling and conditional simulations. The hazard rate for each treatment was estimated 
based on the OS data observed at the time of the OS interim analysis (DCO: 06 September 2021). An 
exponential distribution was assumed, and data were simulated for the future course of the study 
(taking into account the time that existing subjects had already been in the study) until 239 deaths 
were accumulated. The simulations were repeated 10,000 times and the probability of success was 
reported as the proportion of null hypotheses rejected at the final OS analysis among the 10,000 
simulated runs. These simulations estimated a probability of success of 68.81% for all subjects and 
90.78% for ESR1-mut subjects.

Notes 
0.499 
  ESR1-mut 
A post hoc exploratory subgroup PFS analysis by IRC was performed based 
on the stratification factor prior fulvestrant. HRs for patients with and 
without prior fulvestrant treatment were 0.673 (95% CI: 0.438-1.029) and 
0.668 (95% CI: 0.508-0.877), respectively in the overall population. In 
the ESR1-mut population, HRs for patients with and without prior 
fulvestrant treatment were 0.621 (95% CI: 0.297-1.257) and 0.513 (95% 
CI: 0.348- to 0.752), respectively. 
Post hoc analyses were performed to compare elacestrant to fulvestrant 
and elacestrant to AI for PFS by IRC: 
•  Elacestrant vs fulvestrant: Overall, 165 out of 239 patients (69%) 
received fulvestrant as the SOC treatment. HR in the overall population 
was 0.684 (95% CI: 0.521-0.897). HR for ESR1-mut patients was 
0.504 (95% CI: 0.341-0.741). 
•  Elacestrant vs AI: Overall, 73 out of 239 patients (31%) received 
fulvestrant as the SOC treatment. HR in the overall population was 
0.779 (95% CI: 0.520-1.172). HR for ESR1-mut patients was HR was 
0.659 (95% CI: 0.320-1.329).

2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
Scientific rationale for ESR1 mutation testing 
Mechanism of action: elacestrant binds to the ligand binding domain of ERα (the protein coded by the 
ESR1 gene) with high affinity. The binding affinity data for the mutant variants such as Y537S and 
D538G are not available. Elacestrant also binds estrogen receptor-beta (ERβ) but with lower (high 
nanomolar) affinity. Elacestrant inhibited proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells featuring wt ESR1 
or mut ESR1 (Y537S and D538G) with IC50 values in the lower nanomolar range. Oral administration of 
elacestrant produced dose-dependent tumour growth inhibition (TGI) of established tumours in an 
estrogen-responsive MCF-7 human breast carcinoma CDX mouse model and in PDX mouse models, 
using breast cancer cells insensitive to fulvestrant and CDK4/6 inhibitors or cells harbouring mutations 
in ESR1.

Biomarker definition: “Any ESR1 mutation between codons 310 and 547” was utilised to define a 
patient to be ‘ESR1 mutation positive’ (‘ESR1-mut’). This means the definition covers any mutations in 
the ESR1 ligand domain and therefore follows the rationale that any ESR1 mutation in the ligand 
domain leads to resistance to endocrine therapy (Toy et al., Nat. Genetics 2013, Brett et al. Breast 
Cancer Res. 2021).  
While certain specific mutations (e.g., D538G, Y537S, Y537N) are most common, ESR1 mutations can 
be highly diverse. This is supported by data from study RAD1901-308 (EMERALD), being the pivotal 
study in this procedure (n=478 patients). All together in this study 44 different distinct mutations were 
detected. 64% (28/44) of these mutations were detected with the frequency of one (n=1), and 
another 11% (5/44) were not encountered in the literature before.  
In summary, the following ESR1 mutations were detected in study RAD1901-308 (regardless of 
number of ESR1-mutations detected in one patient):  
-  Detected ≥10 times (in the order of frequency detected): D538G, Y537S, Y537N, E380Q, L536H, 
Y537C 
-  Detected ≤10 times (in the order of frequency detected): L536P, L536R, S463P, H524L, Y537D,

As to a subgroup analysis from Study RAD1901-308, observed median PFS is similar in patients with 
rare mutations (frequency n=1) compared to patients positive for any eligible ESR1 mutation. In 
addition, median PFS from subgroup analyses for the four most frequently detected mutations are 
supportive (see Table 67 below).

Confirmation test 
Guardant360 (Guardant Health, Redwood City, CA) was the only assay used to determine the ESR1 
mutation status in the single pivotal study RAD1901-308 (EMERALD).  
Analytical method including assay platform, specimen, pre-analytical processing requirements and 
read-out method 
Guardant360 is a qualitative next generation sequencing-based in vitro diagnostic device that uses 
targeted high throughput hybridization-based capture technology for detection of biomarkers utilizing 
circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) (i.e. it as so-called liquid biopsy) and is used to detect ESR1 mutations 
between codons 310 and 547.  
Literature shows that ctDNA is a commonly used method to determine ESR1 mutation status. The 
review of Downton et al., Drug Design, Development and Therapy, 2022, describes that ESR1 
mutations may be detected from tumour tissue or circulating tumour DNA with good concordance 
between the two specimen types. 
Guardant360 CDx is a laboratory test composed of the following major processes: Whole Blood 
Collection and Shipping, Plasma Isolation and circulation cell-free DNA (cfDNA) Extraction, Library 
Preparation and Enrichment DNA Sequencing, Data Analysis and Reporting. Whole blood is collected in 
the provided blood collection tubes, Streck Cell-Free DNA BCTs, which stabilise cfDNA and nucleated 
blood cells for shipping. The blood sample is sent to a laboratory for testing. A minimum of 5 mL 
whole blood is required for testing. Plasma is isolated via centrifugation and cfDNA is extracted from 
plasma within 7 days. Extracted cfDNA, 5 to 30 ng, is then used to prepare sequencing libraries which 
are enriched by hybridization capture. The enriched libraries are then sequenced using next 
generation sequencing on the Illumina NextSeq 550 platform. Quality control measures are taken 
throughout sample processing and sequencing. cfDNA quantity and fragment size distribution are 
measured at several points during sample processing to ensure sample integrity. Additionally, a 
sequence variant control, containing both expected positive and negative variants (the Variant 
Control) are used with each batch. All the somatic quality control measures must pass for each sample 
result to be considered valid. Sequencing data are analyzed using a custom-developed bioinformatics 
pipeline. Upon completion of testing, a Guardant360 CDx results report will be generated for use by a 
qualified individual with appropriate clinical training.  
Clinical validation strategy 
To support clinical validity of Guardant360 CDx as a predictive biomarker, the treatment effect of 
elacestrant vs SOC for PFS in ESR1-muation positive patients was descriptively compared with the 
treatment effect of elacestrant in ESR1-mutation not detected patients from pivotal study RAD1901-
308 (EMERALD) (see discussion on clinical efficacy).

No clinical thresholding was performed. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the threshold applied in 
study RAD1901-308 (EMERALD) was optimal or whether a lower or higher threshold defining patients 
as ‘ESR1-mutant’ would lead to a better benefit-risk ratio.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In this MAA, the applicant submits the clinical study results in support of the following indication 
(wording amended during the evaluation): 
“Orserdu monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with 
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with an 
activating ESR1 mutation who have disease progression following at least one line of endocrine therapy 
including a CDK4/6 inhibitor.” 
Orserdu (elacestrant) is a tetrahydronaphthalene compound that is a selective and orally active 
oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) degrader and antagonist (SERD). The recommended dose is 400 mg (one 
film-coated tablet), once daily, with or without food. 
The clinical development programme in support of the proposed indication concerns three clinical 
studies; two phase 1 studies (Study 005 and 106) and one phase 3 randomised control trial (RCT) 
(Study 308, RAD1901-308, EMERALD), the latter is considered key for the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice (SA) was sought for Study 005. Based on the SA, the applicant revised the intended 
clinical strategy with Study 308 as main pivotal study to support the MAA. 
Dose finding and dose recommendation 
The recommended dose of 400 mg once daily (QD) in Study 308 was based on Study 005 and Study 
106. 
Within the dose escalation Study 005, only 7 out of the 57 enrolled patients received another dose 
than 400 mg QD. Although no dose-limiting toxicities were reported, the 600 mg dose (capsules only) 
was deemed not tolerable due primarily to gastrointestinal (GI) events (especially nausea, vomiting, 
and constipation) occurring at higher frequencies compared to the 400 mg dose (67%-100% vs 17%-
65%). The low number of patients treated with 200 mg (n=4) and 600 mg (n=3) hampers the 
comparison between the different doses. It is also noted that the 400 mg tablets seem to be more 
tolerable than the 400 mg capsules and higher doses of the tablets might have been tolerable as well. 
The objective response rate (ORR) of 19.4% in 31 evaluable patients receiving the recommended 
phase 2 dose in Study 005 supports single-agent activity. ORR was 16.7% in 18 patients who received 
prior CDK4/6i and 23.1% in 13 patients who were naïve to CDK4/6i.

Results from the pharmacodynamic Study 106 showed that both doses of 400 mg and 200 mg 
reduced FES uptake in tumour lesions at day 14, although less reduction was observed with the 200 
mg dose (see 2.6.2.2. ). The applicant provided further support for the intended dose with PopPK 
model simulations of 200 and 400 mg QD for a patient population with the same covariate distribution 
of the phase 3 study 308 population. The PopPK model showed that with 200 mg QD, only half of the 
patients would have resulted above the target engagement threshold, while the totality of the patients 
administered with 400 mg QD would have reached through concentrations above the threshold. This 
seems to be contradicting the observation that there was no clear relationship between PFS and 
elacestrant exposure, as represented by the average daily AUC (AUCav) (see 2.6.2. ).  
In the final exposure response analysis, the nominal steady state AUC(0-24) for the patients in Study 
308 were overlaid on the logistic curves of (i) the probability of clinical benefit rate and overall 
response vs AUC and (ii) the probability SAE, Grade 3 AEs and AEs leading to study discontinuation vs 
AUC obtained in a preliminary analysis based on efficacy and safety data from the phase 1 Studies 005 
and 106. The probability of experiencing any type of severe AEs increased for doses higher than 
400 mg QD, while in the range of exposures observed in Study 308 study this probability did not 
increase markedly, remaining below 50%. The probability of clinical benefit and overall response 
seemed to be decreasing with a higher AUC, which is not explained. 
All in all, any conclusions on the most optimal dose are still difficult to draw and it is not understood 
how the dose recommendation was determined to be 400 mg QD. However, it is acknowledged that 
the B/R assessment should be made based on the posology of 400 mg QD used in the pivotal study. 
However, given the limited data on the 200 mg dose (n=4), the apparent lower target engagement 
and no patients in the pivotal study in need of a second dose reduction (see 2.6.2. and 2.6.8. ), the 
possibility that patients receiving 200 mg dose would be undertreated cannot be ruled out. Therefore, 
the recommendation for the second dose reduction was not supported (See SmPC section 4.2). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In- and exclusion criteria- Study 308 is a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, active-
controlled study comparing of elacestrant versus standard of care (SOC) therapy (fulvestrant or 
aromatase inhibitor (AI)) in postmenopausal women and men with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast 
cancer (mBC) whose disease has relapsed or progressed on at least 1 and no more than 2 prior lines of 
endocrine therapy (ET) for mBC. Prior ET must have included a combination with CDK4/6 inhibitor 
(CDK4/6i) therapy and patients must have received no more than 1 line of cytotoxic chemotherapy for 
mBC and must have been appropriate candidates for endocrine monotherapy. Only patients with 
evaluable lesions per RECIST version 1.1, i.e. measurable disease or bone only disease with evaluable 
lesions were included. The in- and exclusion criteria largely reflect the target population, although 
more fit than the to be treated population in clinical practice and presented with not rapidly 
progressing disease. For instance, patients with ECOG >1, presence of symptomatic metastatic visceral 
disease, cardiac comorbidity, and hepatic impairment were excluded.  
The applicant originally proposed an indication irrespective of prior CDK4/6i status, but patients had to 
be previously treated with endocrine therapy in combination with CDK4/6i to be enrolled in the pivotal 
study. Although it is known that efficacy of fulvestrant is different in patients who progressed on a 
CDK4/6i compared to patients CDK4/6i naïve (Lindeman et al., Clinical Cancer Research, 2022), the 
impact of prior CDK4/6i therapy on the activity of elacestrant is not known based on the provided data. 
Although the results of Study 005 provide clinical evidence of activity of elacestrant in CDK4/6i naïve 
patients, it cannot be concluded that elacestrant activity among CDK4/6i-naïve patients compares 
favourably to its activity in patients who received prior CDK4/6i in the metastatic setting. Additional 
limitations to interpret the clinical data from Study 005, are the limited number of patients, the single 
arm study design and the response rates being higher than observed in the pivotal study, which make 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 161/197  
 
 
 
 
it difficult to put the results into perspective. The applicant also provided PFS results for subgroups 
with different duration of prior CDK4/6i therapy which showed a positive correlation between the 
duration of prior CDK4/6i and PFS on elacestrant in Study 308, which was not observed in the control 
arm. All in all, the efficacy of elacestrant in patients who are CDK4/6i naïve remains uncertain with 
clinical data limited to only 13 patients in Study 005. Therefore, the indication was restricted to 
patients with prior CDK4/6i treatment, in line with the inclusion criteria of the pivotal Study 308. 
ESR1 mutation testing: ESR1 mutations are a known resistance mechanism to endocrine therapy. 
Further, the specific mutation in the ESR1 gene appears of importance as there is mutation-specific 
variability in resistance patterns (Lloyd et al., Therapeutic Advances in Medical Oncology, 2022). 
Acquired drug resistance to endocrine therapy may also occur by activation of alternative growth factor 
and signalling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Downton et al., Drug Design, 
Development and Therapy, 2022). The applicant initially planned to conduct exploratory biomarker 
analyses which were deleted in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) of 05 March 2021.  
While the role of ESR1 mutations in the resistance to aromatase inhibitor treatment is evident, the role 
of ESR1 mutations is less clear in respect to treatment with SERDs in general or to what extent 
differential treatment effects can be expected for fulvestrant and elacestrant. Non-clinical studies in 
animal models bearing ESR1wt or ESR1mut xenografts did show a generally better efficacy of 
elacestrant as compared to fulvestrant in the mutant variants, but a mechanistic background remains 
largely unclear. In vitro, fulvestrant was shown to inhibit both wild-type and mutant ER more 
effectively than elacestrant but receptor occupancy in vivo may be incomplete at the concentrations 
achieved in patients. From the clinical point of view, the advantage claimed for elacestrant based on 
the non-clinical evidence cannot directly be found in the clinical evidence for ESR1-mut and ESR1-WT 
tumours. While certain specific ESR1 mutations (e.g., D538G, Y537S, Y537N) are most common, ESR1 
mutations can be highly diverse. The scientific rationale to define patients with ‘any ESR1 mutation in 
the ligand binding domain (i.e. any mutation between codons 310 and 547)’ as ESR1 mutation positive 
(‘ESR1-mut’) – being supported by preclinical data – can be followed. The non-clinical studies provided 
no evidence of the improved efficacy of elacestrant in the investigated models with mut ESR1 in 
comparison to wt ESR1 models. Post-hoc defined subgroup analyses from pivotal study RAD1901-308 
are supportive for this definition. However, a sound validation of this definition of ESR1 mutation 
positivity (i.e. biomarker positivity) is not possible due to the diversity and rarity of single ESR1 
mutations within the ligand binding domain. In view of the narrowed proposed indication to ESR1 
mutated patients the unclear pre-clinical and clinical selectivity to mutant ESR1 over wt-ESR1 will not 
be further pursued. However, pharmacodynamics of elacestrant with regard to ESR1 mutation still lack 
clarification.  
The in vitro biomarker Guardant360 (Guardant Health, Redwood City, CA) was the assay used to 
determine the ESR1 mutation status in the single pivotal study RAD1901-308 (EMERALD), which was 
used to stratify the population. Analytical validation of Guardant360 CDx with regard to accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, precision and robustness was demonstrated. Eligibility of patients for elacestrant 
was based on analytical detection of the mutations by Guardant360 CDx. Mutation results are provided 
as ‘biomarker positive’ or ‘biomarker negative’, i.e. Guardant360 CDx is a purely qualitative binary 
test. No clinical thresholding was performed. 
Clinical validation: When using the Guardant360 CDx as basis for deciding on ESR1-mutation status, 
The PFS benefit of elacestrant vs SOC in the ESR1-mutation positive patient population was 
numerically larger than in ESR1-mutation not detected patient population supporting predictivity. This 
does not mean that any ESR1-mutation detected by the test is predictive, or that ESR1-mutation 
status is predictive independently from the chosen cut-off. The explorative analysis by mutation (see 
Table 67) and the analysis of pooled rare mutations do not contradict the assumption of a 
homogeneous effect across mutations. However, the limitations of these analyses, such as not all 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 162/197  
 
 
 
 
mutations being represented in the study, small sample sizes and median alone not describing 
treatment effects comprehensively, mean that no definite conclusion on consistency of effects across 
mutations is possible based on the clinical data.  
Cut-point selection: Eligibility of patients for elacestrant was based on analytical detection of the 
mutations by Guardant360 CDx. Mutation results were provided as ‘biomarker positive’ or ‘biomarker 
negative’, i.e. Guardant360 CDx is a purely qualitative binary test. No clinical thresholding was 
performed. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the threshold applied in study RAD1901-308 
(EMERALD) was optimal or whether a lower or higher threshold defining patients as ‘ESR1-mutant’ 
would lead to a better benefit-risk ratio. 
As the relevant ESR1 mutations leading to oestradiol independent receptor activation are those in the 
ligand binding domain, it is specified in the indication that the ESR1 mutations have to be activating. 
Comparator: Fulvestrant and AI (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) monotherapy are valid 
options according to the ESMO guideline (Gennari et al., Annals of Oncology, 2021) for candidates for 
endocrine monotherapy (per the inclusion criteria). Other therapeutic options are mainly for specific 
subgroups with a mutation (alpelisib, PAPR inhibitors). Tamoxifen monotherapy would have been 
another SOC option though. The investigator was to select 1 of the available SOC options based on the 
individual patient’s prior treatment history and the investigator’s judgment prior to randomisation. The 
general protocol guidance on choice of SOC, i.e. aromatase inhibitor vs fulvestrant according to prior 
treatments is acknowledged. It appears appropriate to change the class of substance after progression 
to avoid likely inefficient treatment. 
Duration of treatment: Study treatment was administered until progressive disease (PD), death, 
unacceptable toxicity, inability to receive study treatment for >14 days or withdrawal of patient 
consent, which can be supported given the mechanism of action of endocrine therapies. 
Efficacy endpoints: Patients were randomised 1:1 to elacestrant or SOC, stratified by ESR1 
mutational status, prior fulvestrant, and visceral metastases. The principle of randomisation and the 
stratification factors used are supported.  
The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) by imaging review committee (IRC) using 
RECIST v1.1 with OS as the key secondary endpoint. Tumour assessments were performed every 8 
weeks ±7 days from randomisation date. PFS is an acceptable endpoint in the proposed setting, 
provided mature OS data excluding a negative effect are available and the effect is homogenous across 
important subpopulations. Both PFS and OS were analysed in the ESR1-mut patients and in all patients 
and the primary endpoint was defined as met if the PFS was statistically significant in either one of the 
two populations (intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis). PFS and OS ESR1-mut-not detected (nd), containing 
both patients who have proven WT disease and patients in whom the test could not be performed, are 
analysed as unpowered secondary endpoints. The choice of secondary endpoints was supported. 
Sample size: The sample size calculation appeared incomplete as it was performed for the ESR1-mut 
population and the assumption was based on treatment with fulvestrant only, even though the SOC 
also included AI and the study could also become positive if the PFS in the overall population would be 
significant.  
Statistical methods: The difference in the primary endpoints IRC-assessed PFS between the 
treatment groups was analysed using a log-rank test stratified by the stratification factors, which is an 
acceptable method. In the primary PFS analysis, documented progression or death after missing ≥2 
consecutive postbaseline tumour assessments and progression after start new anticancer therapy were 
not considered as PFS events. These do not follow the CHMP guideline on PFS 
(EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1), as >1 missed visits are censored as is start new anti-cancer therapy. 
Post hoc analysis were provided to address this. Since no tumour assessments were required by 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 163/197  
 
 
 
 
protocol after start of new anticancer therapy, these analyses are automatically hampered for 
assessing progression after start of new anticancer therapy. The other sensitivity analyses and 
concordance analysis between IRC- and investigator-assessed PFS, which were performed as planned, 
are agreed. 
The analysis methods for the other secondary endpoints are in general agreed. It should be noted, 
however, that PRO results are mainly summarising outcomes with no formal statistical testing planned. 
Additionally, hypothesis and handling of missingness are not provided for PRO data and claims on PRO 
benefit will be difficult to make. 
The planned subgroup analyses are supported, although the subgroups based on SOC choice, i.e. AI or 
fulvestrant, were not prespecified. 
Study conduct: Most of the study protocol amendments that occurred after the enrolment of the first 
study patient are not likely to have a major influence on the efficacy outcomes. However, late changes 
were made in the analysis of the main efficacy endpoints PFS and OS in an open-label trial, which 
questioned the internal validity. 
Firstly, the final PFS analysis was performed with less events than prespecified in the SAP for the final 
analysis. The applicant explained that the assumed efficacy based on median PFS was lower than 
expected and the number of censoring was higher than expected. This led to a lower number of events 
and it was projected that the planned number of events would not be reached within a year. The 
process of managing access to treatment information was documented in a blind management plan 
(final version dated 01-February 2021) before the data cut-off of 06 September 2021 and subsequent 
changes in the blind management did not included changes in who had access to what information. 
Although the decision for changing the analysis time point seems to have been made by persons not 
blinded to treatment assignment, these had no access to aggregated data. In addition, additional 
analyses with an updated PFS analysis and stable HR ratios over time support that the final PFS 
analysis provided can be regarded as a reliable alternative to the originally planned final analysis (see 
under Efficacy data and additional analyses).  
Moreover, the timing of the interim and final OS analysis were specified in the protocol - version 5.0 
dated March 2019, which was still at the very early stage of the trial and very few patients were 
enrolled at that time. OS was defined as a key secondary efficacy endpoint for the ESR1-mut and 
overall population. The interim analysis was planned at the time of the primary (final) PFS analysis and 
the final OS analysis was to be performed when 50% of the subjects had died but no specification for 
controlling Type 1 error at 2-sided alpha at 0.05 in the primary and secondary endpoints was initially 
specified. During the study, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the SAP (Version 1.0, 
dated 05 March 2021) and advised the applicant to clarify the testing plan of OS.  
Secondly, there were changes to the OS testing procedure in the SAP during this open-label trial. The 
change was made in May 2021, 3-4 months prior to the clinical data cut-off on 06 September 2021. 
The applicant justified the changes by comments made by the FDA (no data from the ongoing study 
was used to inform the changes made).  
As neither the interim nor the final OS analysis showed a statistically significant effect on OS (see 
under Efficacy data and additional analyses), there is no impact of the late definition of the multiplicity 
procedure on the interpretation of the OS analysis. Based on this, it is considered that the internal 
validity of the study was maintained irrespective of the changes in the testing procedures and that the 
presented efficacy results do allow for an adequate B/R assessment. 
In addition, one patient was accidentally excluded from the analysis. The subject consented to the 
study and was successfully randomised to fulvestrant. The subject subsequently relocated and

transferred care and study participation to another centre. A thorough quality review of the clinical 
database was conducted and no additional data issues were identified. Additional analyses based on 
the updated datasets (N=478, including missing subject) were provided and the PFS estimates 
(medians, hazard ratios etc.) remained unchanged. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patient disposition- A total of 695 patients were screened and 478 were randomised, 239 to the 
elacestrant arm and 239 to the SOC arm at the data cut-off (DCO) of 06 September 2021. The 
majority of patients in the SOC group received fulvestrant (69%). Among ESR1-mut patients, 115 
were randomised to elacestrant and 113 to SOC.  
Protocol deviations- The number of major protocol deviations was small in both groups (n=6 in the 
elacestrant group and n=11 in the SOC group, mainly due to being randomised and not treated) and 
the impact of these on efficacy was assessed with the modified per protocol analysis.  
Baseline characteristics- Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were, in general, 
balanced across the treatment arms for the overall and ESR1-mut population. The median age of 
patients in the overall population was 63-64 years. Most patients were women (99%) and most 
patients were white (87.8%). While the proportion of men in the study programme is very low, it is 
still considered possible to extrapolate results to men, based on the common biological and 
pharmacological rationale. All female patients were postmenopausal. All but 1 patient had an ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1. Most patients had ductal tumour histology (65.3%). Metastatic sites 
were most commonly in the bone (78.9% [bone only: 14.0%]), liver (49.6%), lymph nodes (28.5%), 
and lung (26.2%). The information regarding the M1 stage at baseline was conflicting with >60% of 
missing data, possibly due to misunderstandings by investigators. Brain metastases were uncommon 
(1.5%). Baseline demographic and disease characteristics for those with ESR1-mut tumours were 
generally representative of the broader study population. When comparing baseline disease 
characteristics of overall population and ESR1-mut population, patients with ESR1-mutation had a 
shorter disease duration at study entry, which was most obvious in the elacestrant-treatment group.  
Regarding prior systemic anticancer therapy, about 20-25% of patients received 1 line of 
chemotherapy and 40%-46% received 2 lines of endocrine therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting. 
All patients were previously treated with a CDK4/6i. Around 80% received prior AI and 30% prior 
fulvestrant. Most of the patients received prior AI only and the chosen SOC in the control arm was 
acceptable for most patients. For patients treated with prior fulvestrant, one patient received 
fulvestrant again, not in line with the protocol guidance. For all 35 patients who received prior AI and 
fulvestrant, the SOC also may not have been optimal, as prior treatment was repeated as ‘SOC’ 
treatment in the study. However, this concerns a relatively small number of patients in the SOC 
treatment arm (36/239 patients; 15.1%) for whom treatment may not have been optimal. It is also 
reassuring, that the number of discontinuations due to AEs did not differ much in the elacestrant 
versus SOC arms (see 2.6.8. ), meaning that the choice for the SOC was acceptable safety wise.  
Primary endpoint: IRC-assessed PFS overall and ESR1-mut population 
As of the DCO of 06 September 2021, 18 patients in the elacestrant group and 6 patients in the SOC 
group were still on treatment. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was 
investigator-assessed progression per RECIST in about 75% of patients.  
In the overall population, PFS was statistically significantly improved for elacestrant compared to SOC 
(p=0.0018, stratified log-rank test) with HR of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55-0.88). Median PFS was 2.79 
months in the elacestrant group versus 1.91 months in the SOC group. For ESR1-mut patients, PFS 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 165/197  
 
 
 
 
 
was also statistically significantly improved in patients randomised to elacestrant compared to SOC 
(p=0.0005, stratified log-rank test) with HR of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.39-0.77). Median PFS was 3.78 
months in the elacestrant group versus 1.87 months in the SOC group. The higher p-value was 
<0.0475; thus, both primary objectives were met with statistical significance under the multiplicity 
correction methods used for this study. Although significant, the improvement in median IRC-assessed 
PFS was small. The increase in elacestrant compared to SOC was 0.9 month in the overall population 
and 1.9 month in the ESR1-mutated population (as measured in the median). Results showed that the 
activity of further endocrine monotherapy is very limited in this patient population with prior endocrine 
treatment lines including a combination with CDK4/6i. Also, the PFS results showed considerably 
smaller effects than the assumptions (i.e. median PFS of 5.3 months for SOC and 8.7 months for 
elacestrant).  
The presented results were based on the final PFS analysis with less events than prespecified in the 
SAP for the final analysis (see section above on study conduct). In order to determine whether the 
results of the earlier than planned analysis could be assessed, the applicant performed additional PFS 
analyses. The HR in the overall population was between 0.614 and 0.669 between February and July 
2021, which was consistent with the HR of 0.697 at the final PFS analysis (06 September 2021). No 
analysis was performed with adjustment of the p-value for earlier testing than planned, but a 
calculation showed that an O’Brien-Flemming two-sided boundary at 300 as an interim analysis to a 
final analysis with 340 events for the planned final analysis would be 0.03216 (instead of 0.0475). This 
would leave the current actual final analysis still statistically significant. Also, an update of the PFS 
analyses with a data cut-off date of 02 September 2022 (the same cut-off date for the OS analysis, 
providing approximately one additional year of follow-up) was provided. At that time 7 additional PFS 
events were observed, leading to a total of 307 events, relative to the original cut-off date of 06 
September 2021. Median PFS at the updated analysis was 2.79 months in the elacestrant arm and 
1.91 months in the SOC with a HR of 0.696 for this updated PFS analysis, compared with 0.697 in the 
final PFS analysis. Within the ESR1-mut population, the number of PFS events in the elacestrant arm 
increased from 62 to 67 and in the SOC arm from 78 to 80. The HR changed from 0.546 to 0.543 in 
the updated analysis with a median PFS of 3.78 months in patients treated with elacestrant and 
1.87 months in the patient group treated with SOC. With the provision of HR ratios over time and the 
updated PFS analysis, the final PFS analysis (06 September 2021) is regarded a reliable alternative to 
the originally planned final analysis.  
The PFS KM curves in both arms in the overall and ESR1-mut population showed a stark drop at the 
time of the first tumour assessment (week 8). On the 70 patients in the overall population with PFS <7 
weeks, 24 patients in the elacestrant and 46 patients in the SOC arm had a progression event or 
censoring <7 weeks as assessed by blinded IRC. In both arms, around 65-70% were censored and 
around 30-35% had an event. In retrospect, the timing of the first tumour assessment was not 
optimal. The first scan might have been taken too early given the mechanism of action of endocrine 
therapy or too late to see efficacy before the first assessment as the duration of PFS was much shorter 
than anticipated. This drop in PFS is reported in patients who progressed on a CDK4/6i and were 
treated with fulvestrant (Lindeman et al., Clinical Cancer Research, 2022) and the control arm in Study 
308 was less active than expected. It also means that one dimensional measure such as the HR and 
the restricted mean survival time (RMST) do not capture the fact that for a substantial part of the 
patients (~50%) efficacy cannot be observed (those progressing before 8 weeks fall in a plateau at 
~100% or have similar survival). Separation of PFS curves can only be ascertained at and after 8 
weeks. Limited follow-up is available and PFS curves are uncertain after 8 months due to extensive 
censoring. 
Landmark analysis of PFS rates are difficult to interpret due to the overall low number of patients at 
risk after 8 weeks, especially after 6 months when less than 20% of the population is still event-free. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 166/197  
 
 
 
 
At 3 months there was a difference of about 10% in the overall population and 16% in the ESR1-mut 
population in favour of elacestrant. 
Exploratory PFS analyses by type of detected ESR1-mutation for the most important /frequent 
deleterious or suspected deleterious ESR1 mutations were submitted. The most often occurring 
mutations, regardless of the number of mutations detected per patient, were D538G, Y537S, Y537N, 
E380Q, L536H, and Y537C. For these mutations, median PFS was (numerically) longer for elacestrant 
compared to SOC. The other mutations occurred in a low number of patients, hampering efficacy 
analyses per these mutations.  
The applicant performed prespecified sensitivity analyses, of which results were supportive of the 
primary analysis. Additional post hoc sensitivity analyses (interval censored analysis and an analysis 
with PFS events dated at the next planned visit in case of unscheduled assessment) supported that a 
difference in PFS exists despite the strong interval-censored character (step shape) of PFS. Sensitivity 
analyses for the start of new anticancer therapy and tipping point analyses for early censoring were 
provided. Results from the sensitivity analyses were in line with the final PFS analysis. In total, 7 
patients received new anticancer therapy. Sensitivity analyses where the start of new anticancer 
thrapy was reported as an event, showed a HRs in line with the final PFS analysis. Regarding earlier 
censoring, 30.1% of the elacestrant and 33.5% of the SOC treated patients were censored in the first 
2 months. For the tipping point analysis, two approaches were performed. With the first approach, HR 
never reached 1 for the overall and ESR1-mut population. The second approach demonstrated that 
with all the first censored patients transformed into an event, HR was 0.923 in all patients and 0.808 in 
ESR1-mut patients. When continuing adding transformed events one by one after 2 months, the 
tipping point was between 55-60 patients in the overall patient population and HR never reached ‘1’ in 
the ESR1-mut population. The tipping point analysis suggested the results in the ESR1-mut population 
are more robust than in the overall population. 
Key secondary endpoint: OS overall and ESR1-mut population 
At the presented interim analysis, OS was not statistically different between the elacestrant and SOC 
arms in both the overall and ESR1-mut population (alpha 0.0001). Median OS was not reached in the 
overall population in the elacestrant and SOC arm (HR: 0.742 (95%CI: 0.536-1.025)). For the ESR1-
mut population median was not reached with elacestrant (95%CI: 18.60-NE) and 16.95 months 
(95%CI: 14.00-NE) with the SOC, respectively (HR: 0.592 (95%CI:0.361-0.958)). The KM curves did 
not suggest a detriment for elacestrant, although the curves are difficult to interpret after 8 months 
due to censoring. Final OS analysis at 51% of events with a cut-off date of 02 September 2022 
reported a median OS of 24.61 in the elacestrant and 22.57 months in the SOC arm for all patients 
with overlapping 95% and HR 0.912. In ESR1-mut patients, median OS was 24.18 and 23.49 months, 
respectively, with HR 0.903. The Kaplan-Meier plots showed that the curves in the ITT and the ESR1-
mut were visually in favour of the elacestrant arm up to the point of 24 months at which time heavy 
censoring started. The difference between the elacestrant and SOC arms was larger in the ESR1-mut 
population compared to the ITT. Furthermore, it is not negligible that in the ESR1-mut population for 
13.9% and 12.4% (elacestrant and SOC) the information on OS is lacking. For a pivotal trial in which 
OS is the most important secondary endpoint, it is expected that all measures are taken to ensure 
completeness of survival follow-up. The applicant committed to complete the overall survival 
information on all patients still in follow-up in Study 308 and analyse the completed overall survival 
data (REC). The sensitivity analysis for OS to examine the censoring patterns did not reveal signs of 
attrition bias.  
Secondary endpoint: IRC-assessed PFS and OS in ESR1-mut-nd population 
Median PFS was similar in the elacestrant and SOC arm in the ESR1-mut-nd population and KM curves 
largely overlapped. KM-curves beyond 2 months are difficult to interpret due to the limited number of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 167/197  
 
 
 
 
patients (still at risk). A possible issue is that the ESR1-mut-nd population contains both patients who 
have proven WT disease and patients in whom the test could not be performed, but the number of 
patients in whom ESR1 mut testing could not be performed was very low. In only three patients in the 
elacestrant arm and a single patient in the SOC arm, the mutation status could not be assessed. IRC-
assessed PFS analysis in only ESR1-wild type patients, showed a similar median PFS between 
elacestrant (1.94 months) and SOC arm (1.97 months) with the upper bound for the 95% CI of the HR 
crossing 1. 
No difference in OS was found between elacestrant and SOC in the ESR1-mut-nd population with 
overlapping KM curves. Curves can only be interpreted up to 8 months due to the extensive censoring. 
The clinical significance in the overall population appears limited and mainly a reflection of effects in 
the ESR1-mut population whereas it is unclear if patients in ESR1-mut-nd population really benefit. In 
view that results for the SOC treatment are at a low level of efficacy, the indication was revised to be 
restricted to the ESR1-mut population. 
Secondary endpoint: investigator-assessed PFS 
Differences between median investigator-assessed PFS for elacestrant and SOC were lower than per 
independent review for the overall population, ESR1-mut population, and ESR1-mut-nd population. KM 
curves only showed a separation in the ESR1-mut population. The investigator-assessed PFS does, 
therefore, not support the benefit in PFS per IRC in the overall population which further supports the 
restriction to the ESR1-mut population. 
Discordance was observed between the independent and investigator review of PFS. In the overall 
population 32.6% in the elacestrant group and 22.7% in the SOC group were assessed as having PD 
by the investigators (and will have discontinued treatment) but were not yet considered to have PD by 
the IRC at the time of assessment of PD by the investigator. In the IRC PFS analysis, these patients 
are counted as “censored without progression” or, if they subsequently died, to have had a PFS event 
at the time of death. Because possibly informative censoring (when investigators assessed progression 
without IRC progression) occurred more often in the elacestrant arm than in the control arm, the IRC 
PFS may be biased in favour of the elacestrant arm. Sensitivity analyses in which both investigator- 
and IRC-assessed progression were counted as events were performed. In the overall population this 
led to a median PFS of 1.94 months in the elacestrant arm and 1.87 months in the control arm (HR 
0.774). For the ESR1-mut population, median PFS was 2.00 months in the elacestrant and 1.87 
months in the SOC arm (HR 0.643). Even though these differences might be statistically significant, 
the absolute differences in median PFS are very small and of doubtful clinical relevance. The issue of 
informative censoring when investigators assessed progression without IRC progression, therefore, 
remains an uncertainty. However, it is acknowledged that for the ESR1-mut population a gain in 
median PFS of 1.58 months was reported for investigator-assessed PFS in favour of elacestrant, which 
was absent in the overall population (difference in median PFS of only 0.17 months).  
Other secondary efficacy endpoints: ORR and clinical benefit rate (CBR) did not show differences 
between treatment arms in any population. Duration of response (DoR) was not reached when 
assessed per independent review, but overall the number of patients with a response was low, making 
interpretation of DoR difficult. 
Patient-reported outcomes: There were no noteworthy differences between the treatment groups 
and no noteworthy changes over time in either group. Considering that no formal statistical testing 
was planned and hypothesis and handling of missingness were not provided, PRO data may be subject 
to bias and are thus not included in the SmPC, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 168/197  
 
 
 
 
Exploratory endpoints: Comparable number of patients received chemotherapy as first systemic 
therapy after treatment discontinuation, though numbers were somewhat lower in the ESR1-mut 
population. Elacestrant did not delay time to chemotherapy compared to SOC. 
No results were provided for the exploratory endpoints on biomarker analyses. Only very limited on- 
and post-treatment biopsies were collected and no tissue analyses were performed and no ctDNA 
analyses are currently planned. Considering the rather modest efficacy of elacestrant, the results of 
biomarker analyses to better select patients who will benefit the most are considered of great value.  
The applicant will perform a biomarker analysis in the ongoing studies (ELEVATE [NCT05563220], 
ELECTRA [NCT04791384], and ELCIN [NCT05596409]), in particular, ctDNA analysis on plasma 
samples, using a panel of relevant genes, at the baseline and longitudinally during the patient 
treatment (REC). 
Subgroup analyses: Prespecified subgroup IRC-assessed PFS analyses for baseline characteristics in 
the overall and ESR1-mut population showed HRs<1, except for race Asian and Other in the overall 
population, although the subgroups were small. 
Regarding the stratification factors, the results previously discussed showed that efficacy is driven by 
the ESR1-mut population. The subgroups of patients with and without prior fulvestrant are considered 
relevant as fulvestrant and elacestrant share a common mechanism of action and previous therapy 
could be an effect modifier. Subgroup analysis in patients with or without prior fulvestrant showed 
comparable HRs of 0.67, but medians for PFS were overlapping for patients with prior fulvestrant and 
not in patients without prior fulvestrant. Acknowledging that this concerns an exploratory analysis, this 
suggests that efficacy is lower in patients with prior fulvestrant. 
In addition, post hoc analyses comparing IRC-assessed PFS of all patients receiving elacestrant to 
patients receiving fulvestrant or AIs in the SOC arm were provided. The majority of patients in the SOC 
group received fulvestrant (69%). Both the HR for PFS and the differences in median PFS were similar 
in magnitude to those observed in the primary analysis for the SOC patients who received fulvestrant. 
As was observed in the primary analysis, there was a higher effect of elacestrant in the ESR1-mut 
population and no effect in ESR1-mut-nd patients. When comparing elacestrant to AI, the 95% CI for 
HR was containing 1 in all populations, i.e. the overall, ESR1-mut, and ESR1-mut-nd populations. 
Interpretation of results is hampered by the low numbers and non-randomised comparisons in some 
populations. 
In ESR1-mut patients with no prior fulvestrant (n=82) a direct comparison of fulvestrant and 
elacestrant is possible. For fulvestrant a 6-month PFS rate of 21.0 % per IRC (19.4% by INV) was 
reported. For elacestrant a 6-month PFS rate of 42.4 % per IRC (33.4% by INV) was reported. Thus, 
the treatment effect of elacestrant was a difference in 6-month PFS rate of 21.4 % by IRC or 14.0% by 
INV. For 12-month PFS rates similar differences were reported. This suggests that elacestrant 
treatment is not a disadvantage to fulvestrant in the subgroup with no prior fulvestrant and the 
observed differences in ESR1-mut patients are not purely driven by the AI group.  
The interpretation of OS subgroup analyses for the ITT and ESR1-mut population is limited by the 
sample size. Some of the subgroups showed a point estimate of the HR above 1, e.g. in the ESR1-mut 
population for the subgroups with no visceral metastases, age <65 years, age <75 years, race Asian, 
race Other, region North America, baseline ECOG PS 0, measurable disease at baseline and 1 prior line 
of endocrine therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting. Reassuringly, in all cases the 95% confidence 
interval was wide and the lower bound was well below 1.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The primary endpoint IRC-assessed PFS shows significant, but small differences in favour of 
elacestrant compared to SOC in the overall population and the population with an ESR1 mutation. The 
results seem to be mainly driven by patients with an ESR1 mutation who have a longer PFS in the 
elacestrant group compared to the overall population, but the SOC performs similar in the ESR1-mut 
and overall group. Therefore, the indication was restricted to patients with an activating ESR1-mutated 
tumour. The differences in PFS were only observed at and after the first scan at 8 weeks, but tipping 
point analyses correcting for early censoring, showed that in the ESR1-mut population the results are 
robust. 
The key secondary endpoint OS was not statistically different between the elacestrant and SOC arms in 
both the overall and ESR1-mut population, though reassuringly the KM curves did not show signals of 
a detriment. 
During the study, two major changes were conducted regarding the efficacy testing procedures. The 
first change was an earlier than planned PFS analysis. Although the decision for changing the analysis 
time point seems to have been made by persons not blinded to treatment assignment, these had no 
access to aggregated data. In addition, additional analyses with an updated PFS analysis and stable HR 
ratios over time support that the final PFS analysis provided can be regarded as a reliable alternative 
to the originally planned final analysis. Regarding the second amendment, the OS testing procedure 
was changed late in an open-label study. This change was motivated by external advice from the FDA 
and no data from the ongoing study was used to inform the changes made. As neither the interim nor 
the final OS analysis showed a statistically significant effect on OS, there is also no impact of the late 
definition of the multiplicity procedure on the interpretation of the OS analysis. Based on this, it is 
considered that the internal validity of the study was maintained irrespective of the changes in the 
testing procedures and that the presented efficacy results do allow for an adequate B/R assessment. 
An additional issue identified is the discordance between independent and investigator review of PFS 
with the risk of informative censoring biasing IRC-assessed PFS in the elacestrant arm. A sensitivity 
analysis counting both investigator- and IRC-assessed progression as event showed a very small 
difference between the elacestrant and SOC arm, even in the ESR1-mutated population. However, with 
the restriction of the indication to ESR1-mut patients and the gain of median PFS of 1.58 months 
reported for investigator-assessed PFS in favour of elacestrant in this subpopulation, this issue will not 
be further pursued. A sensitivity analysis where the start of new anticancer therapy was reported as 
event was in line with the final PFS analysis. 
The applicant is recommended (REC) to: 
- perform biomarker studies in ongoing and future elacestrant studies to better select patients who will 
benefit the most, i.e in the ongoing studies (ELEVATE [NCT05563220], ELECTRA [NCT04791384], and 
ELCIN [NCT05596409]); 
- complete the overall survival information on all patients who are not lost to follow-up in Study 308 
and to analyse the completed overall survival data. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Overall, as of 27 December 2021, a total of 815 subjects were exposed to elacestrant across all 
completed studies, which included besides mBC, several studies in healthy subjects and 2 phase 2 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023

studies in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. The dose range studied was 200 mg – 
1000 mg, most subjects received 400 mg. As of 06 September 2021, a total of 312 subjects with mBC 
were exposed to elacestrant; 239 subjects from the Phase 3 Study 308, 57 subjects from the 
completed Phase 1 Study 005, and 16 subjects from the completed Phase 1 Study 106. Most subjects 
received 400 mg, 4 subjects in study 005 received 200 mg and 3 subjects received 600 mg. In Study 
006, 2 subjects received 200 mg only.  
Safety data were presented for the proposed registration dose for elacestrant of 400 mg QD for both 
the pooled phase 1 (RAD1901-105 and RAD1901-106) studies (n=64) and the phase 3 RAD1901-308 
study (n=237) separately, as subjects enrolled in the Phase 1 studies were more heavily pre-treated 
and with more advanced disease and 40 subjects received the initial capsule formulation.  
Median exposure for elacestrant was 117.0 days (range: 5-1288) and 84.0 days (range: 13-756) for 
the phase 1 Pool and Study 308, respectively. The median duration of treatment was 85 days (range 5 
to 1288). Median exposure for the SOC was fulvestrant was 84.0 days (range: 2-464) and for AIs 64.5 
days (1-554). Relative dose intensity was above 90% for 97%-100% of subjects across studies and 
treatment arms.

Common AEs 
A summary of TEAES occurring in ≥5% of subjects overall by PT is presented in Table 70. Overall, 
most subjects (>30%) treated with elacestrant reported a TEAE in the SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders 
(65.4%), followed by Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (44.7%), General disorders and 
administration site conditions (37.6%), and Investigations (34.2%).  
The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥10%) for elacestrant per PT were nausea (35.0% vs 16.1% 
with fulvestrant vs 25.0% with AI), vomiting (19.0% vs 7.5% with fulvestrant vs. 10.3% with AI), and 
fatigue (19.0% vs. 21.7% with fulvestrant vs. 11.8% with AI). Other commonly (≥10%) observed 
adverse events with elacestrant were decreased appetite, back pain, arthralgia, diarrhoea, aspartate 
aminotransferase increased (AST), constipation, headache, hot flush, and dyspepsia. GI TEAEs, except 
diarrhoea, were more frequently reported than for the SOC. Frequencies of other TEAEs were in 
general in the same order of magnitude as for the SOC. AEs reported more frequently (≥5% 
difference) with fulvestrant compared to elacestrant were injection site pain (8.7%) related to the i.m. 
route of administration and blood pressure increased for AI (8.8% vs. 3.8%). Common TEAEs for the 
SOC are in line with that known and reported in the SmPCs.

a  Preferred terms are summarized using AE synonym terms. 
Note: MedDRA Version 23.0 was used. Subjects with 1 or more AEs within a system organ class of MedDRA were 
counted only once. System organ classes are sorted by descending order of frequency of preferred terms in the 
elacestrant group in Study 308. Preferred terms are sorted by descending order of frequency in the elacestrant 
group in Study 308 within each system organ class. 
Source: ISS, Table 14.3.1.2 and Study 308, Table 14.3.1.2.1.2. 
Most TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2; 27.0% in the elacestrant arm and 20.5% in the SOC were Grade 3 or 
4. Most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs with elacestrant were nausea, back pain, bone pain 
(2.5% each), alanine aminotransferase increased, and blood pressure increased (2.1% each). Most 
commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs with fulvestrant were blood pressure increased (2.5%) and 
anaemia (1.2%). For AI, most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were nausea, abdominal pain, 
blood pressure increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, neutropenia, and tumour pain (2.9% 
each). 
Treatment-related AEs 
Gastrointestinal events were also the most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs for 
elacestrant, mainly nausea (25.3%), and vomiting (11.0%) and at higher rates than for the SOC 
(Table 71). Fatigue was another frequently reported treatment-related TEAE (11.0%). The most 
common treatment-related TEAEs for fulvestrant were nausea (8.7%), fatigue (8.1%), and injection 
site pain (8.1%). The most common treatment-related TEAEs for AI were nausea (8.8%), decreased 
appetite (8.8%), and fatigue (7.4%). TEAEs in the SOC Musculoskeletal disorders and connective 
tissue were more often reported as treatment-related for the comparator arm (17.9% vs. 7.6%).

a  Preferred terms are summarized using AE synonym terms. 
Note: MedDRA Version 23.0 was used. Subjects with 1 or more AEs within a system organ class of MedDRA were 
counted only once. A TEAE is considered treatment related if its causality was “possibly related,” “definitely 
related,” or “related” on the AE eCRF pages from each study. System organ classes are sorted by descending

Sources: ISS, Table 14.3.1.3 and Study 308, Table 14.3.1.2.2.2. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were seldom of high grade (7.2% for elacestrant and 3.1% for SOC). Grade 3 
or 4 nausea with elacestrant was reported in 4 subjects (1.7%), other events (mainly SOC 
investigations) were reported in ≤2 subjects.

2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
A summary of TEAEs with an outcome of death is shown in Table 72. Overall, frequencies were low; 
1.7% (n=4) of subjects had a TEAE with an outcome of death in the elacestrant arm, compared to 
2.6% (n=6) in the SOC. For each TEAE, only single cases were reported. None of the death cases were 
assessed as study drug related by the investigator. 
Table 72 Treatment-emergent adverse events with an outcome of death (Safety population)
SAEs 
Frequencies of SAEs were comparable between elacestrant and the SOC (12.2% vs. 10.9%). Serious 
TEAEs by PT occurring in more than 1 subject were nausea with elacestrant (1.3%), pneumonia with 
fulvestrant (1.2%), and abdominal pain and urinary tract infection (each 2.9%) with AI ( 
Table 73). Treatment-related serious TEAEs occurred only in the elacestrant arm in study 308 (1.3%). 
The only treatment-related serious TEAE reported in more than one subject was nausea (n=2, 0.8%). 
Treatment-related SAEs in the pooled phase 1 studies included one subject with acute hepatic failure 
(elacestrant 400 mg tablet), and one subject with pulmonary embolism and dyspnoea (elacestrant 400 
mg capsules).

Table 73 Serious TEAEs in ≥1% of subjects in any study 308 group (Safety population)
Taking into account the phase 1 studies, there was 1 case of grade 4 acute hepatic failure in study 
RAD1901-005, possibly related to elacestrant. In addition, there were two cases of treatment-related 
serious TEAEs pulmonary embolism (one in phase 1 study pool and one in study 308). 
Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥ 1% of patients with elacestrant in the pooled safety set 
included nausea, dyspnoea, and thromboembolism (venous). 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Shifts from NCI CTCAE Grade 0, 1, or 2 at baseline to any incidence of Grade 3 or 4 on treatment were 
infrequent, occurring in 7 subjects or less in any group for haematology variables, 5 subjects or less in 
any group for chemistry variables, and 2 subjects or less in any group for coagulation variables in 
Study 308.

High cholesterol (75.5% vs 58.5%), triglycerides (60.8% vs. 44.1%), creatinine (25.7% vs. 16.2%), 
and low bicarbonate (23.2% vs. 17.5%) were more common in the elacestrant group, whereas high 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT, 23.6% vs 16.5%), AST (33.2% vs. 28.3%), alkaline phosphatase (ALP, 
24.9% vs 16.5%), and bilirubin (9.2% vs. 3.0%) were more common in the SOC group. Grade 3 or 4 
abnormalities were rare in both groups. The only Grade 3 laboratory abnormality reported in ≥5% of 
subjects in any group was low lymphocytes (6.3% for elacestrant subjects and 3.9% for SOC 
subjects). No Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities were reported in ≥5% of subjects in any group. 
No significant or clinically meaningful changes in clinical laboratory evaluations were observed in 
subjects treated with elacestrant. 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
No trends over time or differences between groups were observed in vital signs or blood pressure and 
no meaningful difference in abnormal vital signs was observed between elacestrant and the SOC in 
Study 308. 
No significant or clinically meaningful changes in ECG parameters were observed in subjects treated 
with elacestrant in Study 308. Notably, there were no significant shifts in QT interval corrected with 
Fridericia’s method (QTcF) during treatment with elacestrant. In Study 308, no subject had a change 
from baseline in QTcF that was > 60 msec. No TEAEs of bradycardia/sinus bradycardia or QTc 
prolongation were observed in the elacestrant group. 
2.6.8.5.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for safety 
Not applicable. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
Age: Most subjects (n=174) in the pooled phase 1 and phase 3 studies treated with elacestrant were 
<65 yrs of age; 127 subjects were ≥65 yrs and n=45 were ≥75 yrs. In general, no trends were 
observed for elacestrant (data not shown). In the RAD1901-308 study, 104 patients who received 
elacestrant were ≥ 65 years and 40 patients were ≥ 75 years. Gastrointestinal disorders were reported 
more frequently in patients aged ≥ 75 years. 
Race: There were no differences in the overall safety profile between race (data not shown). 
Hepatic impairment: Elacestrant is metabolised by the liver, and impaired hepatic function can increase 
risk for adverse reactions. AUCs of the moderate hepatic impairment group (n=10) were considerably 
higher (76% to 83%) than those of the normal hepatic function group, whereas exposure in subjects in 
the mild hepatic impairment group (n=10) was similar to that of the normal hepatic function group 
(Study RAD1901-117). Elacestrant has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, 
therefore no dose recommendation can be made for patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
Patient with renal impairment: The renal excretion of elacestrant is reported to be minimal, therefore 
no renal impairment studies have been conducted. No dose adjustments are required in subjects with 
renal impairment. 
Region: There were no notable differences in safety profile of elacestrant by region (data not shown).

The overall safety profile for elacestrant was comparable for ESR1-mut and ESR1-mut-nd subject 
groups. Further, no notable differences in common adverse events by PT were observed (data not 
shown). 
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Not applicable. 
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions and other interactions are described in section 3.3.1.1 of the Overview. Briefly, 
elacestrant is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and is primarily eliminated in the 
liver via hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) and biliary secretion. Therefore, elacestrant should not be co-
administered with strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4, which may increase the risk of adverse 
reactions, or strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A4, which may decrease elacestrant activity. 
Elacestrant’s relevance as a potential inhibitor of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein and breast 
cancer resistance protein was evaluated in a clinical drug-drug interaction study (Study RAD1901-
118). Elacestrant slightly increases digoxin exposure by 27% for Cmax and 13% for AUC. Elacestrant 
increases rosuvastatin exposure by 45% for Cmax and 23% for AUC. 
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, frequencies of TEAEs leading to discontinuation were low (6.3% elacestrant vs 4.4% SOC). For 
elacestrant, the most frequently reported TEAE by PT was nausea (1.3%) ( 
Table 74).

of subjects in any Study 308 group (Safety population)
Dose interruptions and reductions 
A total of 15.2% in the elacestrant arm had dose interruptions due to TEAEs. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs leading to dose interruptions were in the SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders (5.1%) and 
the most frequently reported GI TEAEs by PT were nausea (3.4%), abdominal pain upper and vomiting 
(each 1.3%). Dose interruptions were observed less frequently in the comparator arm 
(fulvestrant:3.1%, AI: 10.3%).  
TEAEs leading to dose reduction occurred in 3.0% in the elacestrant arm and none in the comparator 
arm. The most frequently reported TEAEs leading to dose reductions were in the SOC of 
Gastrointestinal disorders (2.1%) and the most frequently reported GI TEAEs by PT was nausea 
(1.7%).  
Update safety database DCO 8-Jul-2022 
The applicant submitted an update of the safety database with longer follow-up of study 308 
(additional 10 months) based on the new DCO of 8-Jul-2022 (initial DCO: 06 September 2021). 
Further, one additional patient was identified that was treated with fulvestrant (adding up to n=230) 
and included in the updated safety set. A total of 8/237 and 3/230 patients were continuing treatment 
with elacestrant and SOC, respectively. A the initial DCO, most patients already discontinued treatment 
(18/237 and 6/229 patients continued treatment with elacestrant and SOC, respectively). 
With the safety update, median exposure time for study 308 remained the same but the maximum 
time on treatment increased, for elacestrant maximum exposure increased from 756 to 978 days.

Within study 308, 51 patients on elacestrant had a treatment duration of 6 months or longer, and 25 
patients had a treatment duration of 12 months or longer.  
An updated summary of TEAEs for the safety population and for ESR1-mut patients is shown below. 
Frequencies of TEAEs were comparable to that of the initial DCO. There were no clinically relevant 
changes or new safety signals based on the updated safety database.

Regarding the timing and management of nausea, the median time to the subjects first TEAE of PT 
nausea was 14 days (range: 1 to 490 days) vs. 27 days (range: 1 to 225 days) in the elacestrant and 
SOC arm, respectively. From Cycle 2 onward in both arms, the incidence of TEAEs of PT nausea the 
frequency was generally lower in subsequent Cycles. A total of 12 (5%) subjects in the elacestrant arm 
and 13 (5.4%) subjects in the SOC arm received prophylactic treatment for nausea, whereas 28 
(11.8%) subjects and 16 (7%) subjects received an antiemetic for nausea.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The total safety database for elacestrant in the proposed target population and at the proposed dose 
consists of 301 subjects, of which 237 were treated in the pivotal phase 3 study 308. At data cut-off 
(DCO) of 06 September 2021, the median duration on treatment was 84 days for study 308 and 
somewhat longer for the pooled phase 1 studies (median of 117 days). A safety update was provided 
with the DCO 8-Jul-2022. Median exposure time for study 308 remained the same as most patients 
already had discontinued treatment at the time of initial DCO, however the maximum time on 
elacestrant treatment increased from 756 to 978 days. Long-term safety data is limited (n=51 
≥6 months and n=25 ≥12 months in study 308). Despite these limitations, the safety database can be 
considered acceptable given the known mechanism of action, the well-established safety profile of and 
long-term experience with fulvestrant, and available non-clinical data that did not reveal major issues. 
Routinely review of long-term safety as part of future PSURs is considered sufficient.  
The relative dose intensity being >90% indicates that most subjects tolerated the proposed starting 
dose of 400 mg. The frequency of subjects with TEAEs leading to discontinuation was low and in the 
same order of magnitude as the SOC (6.3% vs. 4.4% SOC). Although dose reductions and dose 
interruptions were more common with elacestrant (3.0% vs 0% SOC and 15.2% vs. 5.2% SOC, 
respectively), overall frequencies are acceptable and support the recommended dose. Some 
uncertainty remains on the impact of the reduced dose on efficacy, given the limited dose-finding data 
(see discussion on clinical efficacy). However, it is reassuring that few patients needed dose reductions 
(n=6 in the ESR1-mut group). Available limited data on efficacy do not suggest inferior clinical 
outcome for patients with one dose reduction. However, there are no data for patients with a second 
dose reduction due to adverse events. Data suggest a lower target engagement and undertreatment 
cannot be ruled out. Therefore, this second dose reduction step is not supported by data and was not 
approved. A quarter of subjects on elacestrant experienced Grade ≥3 TEAEs, which was slightly higher 
than for the SOC (27.0% vs. 20.0%). The most common Grade ≥3 (≥2%) adverse reactions of 
elacestrant were nausea (2.7%), AST increased (2.7%), ALT increased (2.3%), anaemia (2%), back 
pain (2%), and bone pain (2%). Treatment-related AEs were observed more frequently compared to 
the SOC (63.3% vs. 43.7%), however, most were mild or moderate.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs (≥10%) for elacestrant per PT were nausea, vomiting, and 
fatigue. Other commonly (≥10%) observed adverse events with elacestrant were triglycerides 
increased, cholesterol increased, calcium decreased, creatine increased, sodium decreased, potassium 
decreased, decreased appetite, back pain, arthralgia, diarrhoea, alanine aminotransferase increased 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase increased (AST), constipation, headache, hot flush, abdominal pain, 
anaemia and dyspepsia. 
Gastrointestinal events were the most frequently reported TEAEs with elacestrant (65.4% vs. 34.1% 
SOC), and the most common individual TEAEs were nausea (35.0% vs. 18.8% SOC), vomiting (19.0% 
vs. 8.3% SOC) and diarrhoea (13.9% vs. 10.0% SOC). Higher frequencies as compared to fulvestrant 
may in part be due to the different route of administration. Gastro-intestinal (GI) events were also the 
most frequently reported treatment-related TEAEs with elacestrant, especially nausea (25.3%) and 
vomiting (11.0%). However, these were seldom of high grade (Grade 3 or 4 nausea: 1.7%). GI events 
and especially nausea were also the most frequently reported TEAEs leading to dose modifications. 
However, few subjects (1.3%) discontinued elacestrant treatment due to nausea (1.3%). Most events 
occurred during the first treatment cycle. Approximately 5% of patients received prophylactic

treatment for nausea in both treatment arms and a somewhat higher % of patients on elacestrant 
received anti-emetics compared to the SOC (11.8% vs. 7%). The higher frequency of treatment-
related AEs compared to the SOC was mainly due to a difference in GI events. Elacestrant should be 
administered with food as in the clinical study and administration with food may improve 
gastrointestinal tolerability (see 2.6.2. ). Gastrointestinal events like nausea, vomiting and dyspepsia 
were reported more frequently with the capsules compared to the tablet formulation, the reason for 
this is not clear as PK was comparable. Of note, if the patient vomits after taking the Orserdu dose, the 
patient should not take an additional dose on that day and should resume the usual dosing schedule 
the next day at the usual time. Other frequently reported TEAEs with elacestrant were fatigue (19.0%) 
and arthralgia (14.3%), which are known for endocrine therapies (ET) and observed at comparable 
frequencies as for the SOC (<5% difference). This also holds true for known events like elevated 
hepatic enzymes and hot flushes. Most of these events were also mild or moderate. Most commonly 
reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs with elacestrant were nausea, back pain, bone pain (2.5% each), alanine 
aminotransferase increased, and blood pressure increased (2.1% each). Most commonly reported 
Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs with fulvestrant were blood pressure increased (2.5%) and anaemia (1.2%). For 
AI, most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were nausea, abdominal pain, blood pressure 
increased, gamma-glutamyltransferase increased, neutropenia, and tumour pain (2.9% each). TEAEs 
for the SOC were in line with those known and reported in the SmPC and no new signals were 
identified. Injection site pain was reported in 8.7% of subjects treated with fulvestrant. TEAEs in the 
SOC Musculoskeletal disorders and connective tissue were more often reported as treatment-related 
for the comparator arm (17.9% vs. 7.6%).  
The frequency of subjects experiencing a SAE was comparable between elacestrant and the SOC 
(12.2% vs. 10.9% SOC) and TEAEs by PT occurred in general in single cases. The only reported SAEs 
by PT occurring in more than one subject for elacestrant was nausea (n=3). Treatment-related SAEs 
were few (1.3%) and only reported in the elacestrant arm. Based on OS data, 29.3% and 33.2% of 
subjects died in the elacestrant and SOC arm, respectively. There were only few TEAEs (1.7% vs. 
2.6% SOC) with an outcome of death, occurring in single cases and none of these were considered 
related to elacestrant. Based on the safety update, 2.5% and 3.4% of patients died due to an AE 
within 30 days and 100 days since the last dose of elacestrant, respectively. None was assessed as 
treatment-related by the investigator and no clinically meaningful differences were observed compared 
to the SOC. The narratives for the patients who died from other causes than PD in the pivotal study as 
assessed are agreed.  
Shifts from low grade to high grade in laboratory levels were low and did not identify new safety 
issues. Although high cholesterol (75.5% vs. 58.5% SOC) and high triglyceride levels (60.8% vs. 
44.1%) were observed more frequently with elacestrant, grade 3 or 4 levels were low (maximum 
about 2%) and few patients had shifts from low to high grade which is reassuring. In addition, there 
were no signals of increased cardiovascular toxicity with elacestrant based on preclinical or clinical 
data, though follow-up time in the clinical study was limited. No TEAEs of bradycardia/sinus 
bradycardia or QTc prolongation were observed in the elacestrant group, supported by the lack of a 
signal for QTc prolongation with elacestrant up to a 2.5 times higher dose. However, data at the higher 
end were limited. Fulvestrant has not been associated with significant cardiotoxicity based on long-
term experience. 
In general, no clinically meaningful vital sign results were observed in patients in either treatment arm. 
Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in ≥ 1% of patients included nausea and decreased 
appetite. Adverse reactions leading to dose interruption in ≥ 1% of patients were nausea, abdominal 
pain, alanine aminotransferase increased, vomiting, rash, bone pain, decreased appetite, aspartate 
aminotransferase increased, and diarrhoea.

There were no notable differences in safety profile for age, however the number of subjects ≥75 years 
was low (n=45). There were no clear trends for an increase in specific AEs except for gastrointestinal 
events. This was also seen for the SOC. The SmPC appropriately states that data in elderly (≥75 
years) are limited (SmPC section 4.2 and 4.8). No differences were observed in safety in relation to 
race or region, however, almost all patients were caucasians. On the other hand, no differences are 
expected based on the mechanism of action or are known for fulvestrant. Race was not formally 
assessed as a covariate in the population pharmacokinetics due to the limited number of non-
caucasian subjects included in the clinical development. Despite these limitations, an exploratory 
analysis based on PK data from Phase 1 and Phase 3 studies used for the popPK model development, 
did not suggest significant differences in exposure among different races. 
As elacestrant is metabolised by the liver, impaired hepatic impairment can increase risk of adverse 
reactions. PK data showed that, in contrast to subjects with mild hepatic impairment, subjects with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment had increased elacestrant exposure. Based on these PK data 
elacestrant dose should be reduced to 300 and 200 mg QD in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment. Elacestrant has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment, therefore no 
dose recommendation can be made for patients with severe hepatic impairment (see SmPC section 
4.2). A warning is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC stating that elacestrant is metabolised by the 
liver, and impaired hepatic function can increase the risk for adverse reactions. Therefore, Orserdu 
should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic impairment and patients should be regularly and 
closely monitored for adverse reactions. Administration of elacestrant should be undertaken with 
caution at a dose of 258 mg once daily in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (see SmPC 
section 4.2). In the absence of clinical data, elacestrant is not recommended in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) (see SmPC section 4.2). Further data will be obtained post 
marketing (see 2.6.2. ). As elacestrant is primarily metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4, co-
administration with moderate to strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors affects elacestrant exposure and 
concomitant use with strong and moderate inhibitors/inducers should be avoided (see SmPc sections 
4.2 and 4.4). 
As thromboembolic events are commonly observed in patients with advanced breast cancer and have 
been observed in clinical studies with elacestrant, this should be taken into consideration when 
prescribing elacestrant to patients at risk (See SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Based on the mechanism of action of elacestrant and findings from reproductive toxicity studies in 
animals (see 2.5.4.5. ), elacestrant can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women (see 
section 2.5.4.5.  and SmPC section 4.6). Given the extended knowledge on the safety of fulvestrant, 
the current provided information and warnings in the SmPC, and in line with the RMP of fulvestrant, 
the risk of embryo-foetal toxicity in the off-label setting (premenopausal women) has not been 
included as safety concern in Orserdu RMP (see 2.7. ). The topic will be followed as part of routine 
pharmacovigilance activity of PSURs. Orserdu has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and 
use machines. Since fatigue, asthenia, and insomnia have been reported in some patients taking 
elacestrant (see 2.6.8.2. ), caution should be observed by patients who experience those adverse 
reactions when driving or operating machinery. 
In general, the overall safety profile for elacestrant was comparable for ESR1-mut and ESR1-mut-nd 
(nd=not detected) subject groups. No notable differences in common adverse events by PT were 
observed, nor are to be expected based on the mechanism of action. The selection of the 
non-restricted population as the basis for the safety information in the SmPC is acceptable as it allows 
a more precise estimation of frequencies of ADRs. From the safety database all the adverse reactions 
reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. A dose 
reduction is recommended for patients with adverse reactions to 258mg once daily (3 tables of 86mg) 
based on severity grade of adverse reactions. When occurrence of Grade 2 adverse reactions, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023

interruption of Orserdu should be considered until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. Then treatment 
with Orserdu can be resumed at the same dose level. For Grade 3, treatment with Orserdu should be 
interrupted until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. The dose should be reduced to 258 mg when 
resuming therapy. If the Grade 3 toxicity recurs, Orserdu treatment should be interrupted until 
recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. The reduced dose of 258 mg may be resumed if at the discretion of 
the treating physician if the patient is benefiting from treatment. If a Grade 3 or intolerable adverse 
reaction recurs, Orserdu should be permanently discontinued. For Grade 4, treatment with Orserdu 
should be interrupted until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline. The dose should be reduced to 258 mg 
when resuming therapy. If a Grade 4 or intolerable adverse reaction recurs, Orserdu should be 
permanently discontinued. 
The maximum recommended daily dose of ORSERDU is 345 mg. The highest dose of ORSERDU 
administered in clinical studies was 1000 mg per day. The adverse drug reactions reported in 
association with doses higher than the recommended dose were consistent with the established safety 
profile (see SmPC sections 4.8 and 4.9). The frequency and severity of gastrointestinal disorders 
(abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting) appeared to be dose-related. There is no known 
antidote for an overdose of elacestrant. Patients should be closely monitored and treatment of 
overdose should consist of supportive treatment.  
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of the oral SERD elacestrant in the proposed target population resembles that known 
for endocrine therapies, however frequencies of gastrointestinal events like nausea and vomiting were 
markedly increased. No new safety issues were identified. Treatment-related TEAEs were more 
frequently observed compared to the SOC, mainly due to an increase in gastrointestinal events such as 
nausea and vomiting. Most events were mild or moderate and dose reductions or discontinuations were 
observed in a low portion of subjects, indicating acceptable tolerability of the recommended dose with 
supportive measures. Long-term safety information on elacestrant is limited, however this is not of 
major concern due to the long-standing experience with fulvestrant which is a similar drug-in-class. 
Elacestrant offers the convenience of the oral route of administration compared to the IM 
administration of fulvestrant at the cost of milder to moderate GI events. 
The safety profile is overall acceptable and clinically manageable.

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Orserdu (elacestrant) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In this MAA, the applicant claimed the following therapeutic indication: 
Orserdu is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal woman, and men, with hormone receptor 
(HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer who have progressed following at least one line of endocrine therapy. 
The recommended indication reflecting the data evaluated is: 
“Orserdu monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with 
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with an 
activating ESR1 mutation who have disease progression following at least one line of endocrine therapy 
including a CDK4/6 inhibitor.” 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The standard-of-care first-line therapy for patients with oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+), HER2-
negative metastatic breast cancer (mBC) is CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) in combination with endocrine 
therapy. After progression on CDK4/6i, the optimal sequence of endocrine-based therapy is uncertain, 
underlining an unmet medical need. The choice of next-line treatment is dependent on which agents 
were used previously, duration of response to previous endocrine therapy, disease burden, patient 
preference and treatment availability. According to ESMO Guidelines, evidence-based available options 
for second-line therapy are fulvestrant-alpelisib (for PIK3CA mutated tumours), exemestane-
everolimus, tamoxifen-everolimus, fulvestrant-everolimus, aromatase inhibitor (AI), tamoxifen, 
fulvestrant, chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors for tumours harbouring genomic BRCA mutations. At 
least two lines of endocrine-based therapy are preferred before moving to chemotherapy (Gennari et 
al, Annals of Oncology, 2021). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is based on the pivotal Study 308, a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-label, 
active-controlled study of elacestrant versus standard of care (SOC) therapy (fulvestrant or AI) in 
postmenopausal women and men with oestrogen receptor (ER)+/HER2- mBC whose disease has 
relapsed or progressed on at least 1 and no more than 2 prior lines of endocrine therapy for mBC. In 
total 478 patients were randomised 1:1 to elacestrant or SOC. Randomisation was stratified by 
ESR1 mutational status, prior fulvestrant, and visceral metastases. The studied dose of elacestrant was 
400 mg2 once daily.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The presented data are from the final analysis for superiority of the primary efficacy endpoints of 
blinded imaging review committee (IRC)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in ESR1-mut 
patients or in all patients (ESR1-mut + ESR1-mut-nd (not detected)) at data cut-off date 
06 September 2021. As the higher p-value was <0.0475, the study met both primary endpoints. 
Results for OS are from the final OS analysis with data cut-off 2nd September 2022. 
•  Primary endpoint: IRC-Assessed PFS 
−  Overall population (n=478)- Median PFS was 2.79 months (95%CI: 1.94-3.78) in the 
elacestrant arm versus 1.91 months (95%CI: 1.87-2.10) in the SOC arm, hazard ratio 0.70 
(95%CI: 0.55-0.88), p=0.0018 
−  ESR1-mut population (n=228)- Median PFS was 3.78 months (95%CI: 2.17-7.26) in the 
elacestrant arm versus 1.87 months (95%CI: 1.87-2.14) in the SOC arm, hazard ratio 0.55 
(95%CI: 0.39-0.77), p=0.0005i 
•  Key secondary endpoint: Overall survival (OS)- The key secondary endpoint OS was not 
statistically different between the elacestrant and SOC arms in both the overall and ESR1-mut 
population and the KM curves did not show signals of a detriment. In the ESR1-mut population, 
median OS was 24.18 months (95%CI: 20.53-28.71) in the elacestrant arm and 23.49 months 
(95%CI:15.64-29.90) in the SOC arm. 
•  Secondary endpoint: IRC-assessed PFS in ESR1-mut-nd population- Median PFS was 1.94 
months (95%CI: 1.87-3.55) in the elacestrant arm versus 1.97 months (95%CI: 1.87-2.20) in the 
SOC arm, hazard ratio 0.86 (95%CI: 0.63-1.19), p=0.3082 
•  Secondary endpoint: Investigator-assessed PFS- Median PFS per investigator was 2.17 
months (95%CI: 1.94-3.58) in the elacestrant arm versus 2.00 months (95%CI: 1.87-2.14) in the 
SOC arm, hazard ratio 0.77 (95%CI: 0.63-0.95), p=0.0097 in the overall population. In the ESR1-
mut population, median PFS per investigator was 3.65 months (95%CI: 2.10-5.36) in the 
elacestrant arm versus 2.07 months (95%CI: 1.87-3.48) in the SOC arm, hazard ratio 0.65 
(95%CI: 0.48-0.88), p=0.0049. 
Updated PFS (with 7 additional PFS events) and OS analyses from a data cut-off of 02 September 2022 
showed similar results. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Major changes occurred in the efficacy testing procedures for PFS and OS analyses. Separation of PFS 
KM curves can only be ascertained at and after 8 weeks due to a stark drop in the curves at the first 
tumour assessment and the curves are uncertain after 8 months. The differences in PFS were only 
observed at and after the first scan at 8 weeks, but tipping point analyses correcting for early 
censoring, showed that in the ESR1-mut population the results are robust.  
Discordance in PFS events was observed between the independent and investigator review leading to 
possible informative censoring and potential bias in the IRC-assessed PFS in favour of the elacestrant 
arm. 
Final OS results were presented with a high number of censored observations. The key secondary 
endpoint OS was not statistically different between the elacestrant and SOC arms in both the overall 
and ESR1-mut population, though reassuringly the KM curves did not show signals of a detriment.

The recommended dose of 400 mg once daily (QD) in Study 308 was based on Study 005 and Study 
106. The rationale for the posology of 400 mg QD was not sufficiently supported and the optimal dose 
of elacestrant was considered uncertain (See 2.6.6. ). Results from the pharmacodynamic Study 106 
showed that both doses of 400 mg and 200 mg reduced FES uptake in tumour lesions at day 14, 
although less reduction was observed with the 200 mg dose (see 2.6.2.2. ). It is acknowledged that 
the B/R assessment should be made based on the posology of 400 mg QD used in the pivotal study. 
Test for ESR1 mutational status (i.e. Guardant360):  
•  While certain specific ESR1 mutations (e.g., D538G, Y537S, Y537N) are most common, ESR1 
mutations can be highly diverse. The scientific rationale to define patients with ‘any ESR1 mutation 
in the ligand binding domain (i.e. any mutation between codons 310 and 547)’ as ESR1 mutation 
positive (‘ESR1-mut’) – being supported by preclinical data – can be followed. However, a sound 
validation of this definition of ESR1 mutation positivity (i.e. biomarker positivity) is not possible due 
to the diversity and rarity of single ESR1 mutations within the ligand binding domain.  
•  Clinical validation: The explorative analysis by mutation and the analysis of pooled rare mutations 
do not contradict the assumption of a homogeneous effect across mutations. However, the 
limitations of these analyses, such as not all mutations being represented in the study, small 
sample sizes and median alone not describing treatment effects comprehensively, mean that no 
definite conclusion on consistency of effects across mutations is possible based on the clinical data.  
Cut-point selection: It remains unclear whether the threshold applied in study RAD1901-308 
(EMERALD) was optimal or whether a lower or higher threshold defining patients as ‘ESR1-mutant’ 
would lead to a better benefit-risk ratio. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost all of the patients experienced at least one adverse event (AE) in the pivotal study 308 and 
most of these were treatment-related. Most AEs were also grade 1 or 2. Treatment-related AEs (ADRs) 
with elacestrant were also nausea (25.3%), vomiting (11.0%), and fatigue (11.0%). Additional back 
pain (13.9%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (13.1%), and hot flushes (11.4%), were 
commonly observed events and are known AEs for ET. Gastrointestinal toxicity was markedly increased 
with elacestrant vs SOC, especially nausea (35.0% vs 18.8%), vomiting (19.0% vs. 8.3%), 
constipation (12.2% vs. 6.6%), and dyspepsia (10.1% vs. 2.6%). Other AEs known for ET like 
fatigue/asthenia, elevated hepatic enzymes, hot flushes and musculoskeletal and joint pain were 
observed at the same order of magnitude as for the SOC. 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs were observed more frequently with elacestrant compared to the SOC (27.0% vs. 
20.5%). Most frequently observed grade 3 or 4 AEs in study 308 were nausea, back pain, and bone 
pain (2.5% each). Nausea was the only treatment-related grade ≥3 events observed in more than 1% 
of the subjects treated with elacestrant. 
Overall, 29.3% of the patients had died in the elacestrant arm, most commonly due to disease 
progression and rarely due to an adverse event (1.7%). The causality assessment in the narratives for 
the patients who died from other causes than PD in the pivotal study are agreed.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed in 12.2% of subjects, comparable to the SOC. Nausea 
was the only SAE occurring in more than one subject (1.3%). 
The overall discontinuation rate due to AEs in study 308 was 6.3%, and the most common AE leading 
to discontinuation was nausea (1.3%). Dose modifications (interruptions or reductions) were more 
commonly observed compared to the SOC, mostly dose interruptions due to GI events whereas dose 
reductions occurred less frequently (3.0%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 192/197  
 
 
 
 
The safety profile was comparable independent of ESR1-mutation. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The rationale for the posology of 400 mg QD is not sufficiently supported and the optimal dose of 
elacestrant is uncertain. However, the B/R assessment was made based on the posology of 400 mg QD 
used in the pivotal study and based on efficacy and safety results drawn from the pivotal clinical trial. 
Elacestrant is metabolised by the liver. No clinical data is available in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. Further data will be obtained post-marketing from a PK study in order to provide dose 
recommendations for this population.  
Safety data in elderly (≥75 yrs) is limited (n=45). Appropriate statements are included in the SmPC 
(section 4.2 and 4.8). 
The total safety database is limited with a total of 301 subjects with metastatic breast cancer and 
especially limited long-term safety information in the target population. 
However, given the long-term experience with fulvestrant, routinely review of long-term safety of 
elacestrant as part of future PSURs is considered sufficient.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The primary IRC-assessed PFS showed significant, but small differences in favour of elacestrant 
compared to SOC in the overall population and the population with an ESR1 mutation. The results 
seem to be mainly driven by patients with an ESR1 mutation who have a longer PFS in the elacestrant 
group compared to the overall population, whereas the SOC performs similar in the ESR1-mut and 
overall group. Therefore, the indication was restricted to patients with an activating ESR1-mutated 
tumour. The differences in PFS were only observed at and after the first scan at 8 weeks, but tipping 
point analyses correcting for early censoring, showed that in the ESR1-mut population the results are 
robust.  
The key secondary endpoint OS was not statistically different between the elacestrant and SOC arms in 
both the overall and ESR1-mut population, though reassuringly the KM curves did not show signals of 
a detriment.  
During the study, two major changes were conducted regarding the efficacy testing procedures. The 
first change was an earlier than planned PFS analysis. Although the decision for changing the analysis 
time point seems to have been made by persons not blinded to treatment assignment, these had no 
access to aggregated data. In addition, additional analyses with an updated PFS analysis and stable HR 
ratios over time support that the final PFS analysis provided can be regarded as a reliable alternative 
to the originally planned final analysis. Regarding the second amendment, the OS testing procedure 
was changed late in the conduct of an open-label study. This change was motivated by external advice 
from the FDA and no data from the ongoing study was used to inform the changes made. As neither 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/358130/2023 
Page 194/197  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the interim nor the final OS analysis showed a statistically significant effect on OS, there is also no 
impact of the late definition of the multiplicity procedure on the interpretation of the OS analysis. 
Based on this, it is considered that the internal validity of the study was maintained irrespective of the 
changes in the testing procedures and that the presented efficacy results do allow for an adequate B/R 
assessment. An additional issue identified is the discordance between independent and investigator 
review of PFS with the risk of informative censoring biasing IRC-assessed PFS in the elacestrant arm. 
However, a gain of median PFS of 1.58 months was reported for investigator-assessed PFS in favour of 
elacestrant in ESR1-mut patients (which was absent in the overall population). 
With regards to the remaining uncertainty on the choice for the recommended posology as the B/R 
assessment was made on the posology used in the pivotal study, the recommended posology is 
considered to be based on efficacy and safety results from the pivotal study. 
Overall, the safety profile of the oral SERD elacestrant in the proposed target population resembles 
that known for endocrine therapies and especially fulvestrant. The main difference is a marked 
increase in GI toxicity, especially nausea and vomiting, which may be partly related to the difference in 
route of administration when compared to fulvestrant. Most events are mild to moderate and 
discontinuations or dose reductions occurred at low rates. Other AEs known for ET like 
fatigue/asthenia, elevated hepatic enzymes, hot flushes and musculoskeletal and joint pain were 
observed at the same order of magnitude as for the SOC. Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in about a quarter 
of patients with a higher incidence compared to the SOC, whereas SAEs were reported in a similar 
proportion. The safety profile of the SOC is in line with that known and reflected in the SmPC, no new 
safety signals were identified. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the population with an activating ESR1 mutation the primary endpoint IRC-assessed PFS showed a 
significant median increase of 1.9 months in favour of elacestrant compared to SOC. Although this is a 
small increase it is considered of clinical relevance and outweighs the identified risks with a clinically 
manageable safety profile.  
The results for the overall population seem to be mainly driven by patients with an ESR1 mutation who 
have a longer PFS in the elacestrant group compared to the overall population, but the SOC performs 
similar in the ESR1-mut and overall group. No benefit over SOC is obvious in ESR1-mut-nd population, 
i.e. patients with wild type ESR1 and unknown mutation status. Consequently, the therapeutic 
indication has been restricted to patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with 
an activating ESR1 mutation. Patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer should 
be selected for treatment with elacestrant based on the presence of an activating ESR1 mutation in 
plasma specimens, using a CE marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) with the corresponding intended 
purpose.  
Although it is known that efficacy of fulvestrant is different in patients who progressed on a CDK4/6i 
compared to patients CDK4/6i naïve (Lindeman et al., Clinical Cancer Research, 2022), the impact of 
prior CDK4/6i therapy on the activity of elacestrant is not known based on the provided data. The 
therapeutic indication is restricted to patients who have had received prior treatment with CDK4/6 
inhibitors. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
While the proportion of men in the study programme is very low, it is still considered possible to 
extrapolate results to men, based on the common biological and pharmacological rationale.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Orserdu (elacestrant) is positive, subject to the conditions stated in 
section ‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Orserdu is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Orserdu monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men, with 
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with an 
activating ESR1 mutation who have disease progression following at least one line of endocrine therapy 
including a CDK4/6 inhibitor. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that elacestrant is to be qualified 
as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

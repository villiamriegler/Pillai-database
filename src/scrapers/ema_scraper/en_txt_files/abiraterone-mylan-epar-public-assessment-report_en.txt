a marketing authorisation to Abiraterone Mylan on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
Abiraterone acetate is an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, converted in vivo to abiraterone. Specifically, 
abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17). This enzyme is 
expressed in and is required for androgen biosynthesis in testicular, adrenal and prostatic tumour 
tissues. CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone 
precursors, DHEA and androstenedione, respectively, by 17α-hydroxylation and cleavage of the C17,20 
bond. CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals. 
Androgen-sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels. 
Androgen deprivation therapies, such as treatment with LHRH analogues or orchiectomy, decrease 
androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the 
tumour. Treatment with abiraterone decreases serum testosterone to undetectable levels (using 
commercial  assays) when given with LHRH analogues (or orchiectomy). 
The pharmacotherapeutic group of abiraterone is endocrine therapy, other hormone antagonists and 
related agents, ATC code: L02BX03 
This centralised application concerns a generic application according to article 10(1) of Directive 
2001/83/EC for Abiraterone Mylan 500 mg film-coated tablets, and a hybrid application according to

2.1.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of abiraterone acetate is [(3S,10R,13S)-10,13-dimethyl-17-pyridin-3-yl-
2,3,4,7,8,9,11,12,14,15-decahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthren-3-yl] acetate corresponding to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/444189/2021  
Page 9/35 
 
 
 
 
 
molecular formula C26H33NO2.  It has a relative molecular mass of 391.55 g/mol and the following 
structure in Figure 1: 
Figure 1: abiraterone acetate structure 
The chemical structure of abiraterone acetate was inferred from the route of synthesis and elucidated 
by a combination of infra-red spectroscopy (IR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV), nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) (1H-NMR and 13C-NMR), mass spectrometry and elemental 
analysis. 
The active substance is a white to off-white powder practically insoluble in water and has no pH-
dependent solubility in aqueous media.  
Abiraterone acetate exhibits polymorphism.  The polymorphic  form of abiraterone acetate can be 
distinguished by XPRD, differential scanning calorimetry  (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and 
the manufacturing process followed. This is confirmed by PXRD in the active substance specification.  
Abiraterone acetate has 6 chiral centres. The overall and relative stereochemistry was confirmed by 
single crystal x-ray diffraction. All stereocentres originate in the starting material and are confirmed in 
the active substance by a test for specific optical rotation. The geometry of the 2 olefins is enforced by 
the fused ring system. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
The manufacturing process consists of several synthetic steps plus 1 acetylation, 1 purification and 1 
isolation steps. The product may be micronised according to the customer requirement, and the 
micronisation process is validated.  
Two sites are involved in the manufacture of the active substance. The starting materials introduced 
have been defined. The starting materials are acceptable and controlled by suitable specifications. 
Isolated intermediates are adequately controlled. In addition, acceptable specifications for reagents, 
solvents and other materials used in the synthesis have been provided. Critical steps of the process 
were identified and are controlled by justified and appropriate  in-process controls.  
Manufacturing process of abiraterone acetate active substance has been validated successfully.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. The information presented regarding potential 
impurities/degradation products controlled in the active substance is sufficient. Overall the defined 
control strategy is satisfactory.   
Assessment report  
EMA/444189/2021  
Page 10/35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant conducted a risk assessment on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
active substance in line with the recommendations from the article 5(3) referral assessment report 
(EMA/369136/2020). The control strategy is considered suitable. 
Abiraterone acetate is packed in bags, then sealed in a foil bag and placed in a well-closed drum. The 
primary  packing material  complies with the EC directives 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, HPLC), water 
content (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.),  related substances 
(HPLC), residual solvents (GC), assay (HPLC), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.), polymorphic form 
(PXRD) and microbiological  examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The specifications adopted by the finished product manufacturer for the active substance, are the ones 
set by the active substance manufacturer with the addition of the following specification: 
microbiological examination.  
The specification provided for particle size suggested that the product was either fine milled or 
micronised. However,  a milling/micronisation process was neither described nor validated in the 
manufacturing process described in the ASMF. Since particle size is a critical material  attribute, a 
question was raised as a MO at D120. In response, the process description for the micronisation 
process was added. A specification for PSD was not included as the requirement is considered 
customer specific. The specification included by the finished product manufacturer’s specification is 
deemed sufficient to ensure adequate control of the active substance PSD. 
The specification limits for impurities/degradation products and residual solvents, are in accordance 
with the requirements of ICH guidelines Q3A and Q3C. All solvents used throughout the entire 
synthetic process, including those employed prior  to the starting material,  are routinely controlled in 
the specification and specified at levels below the ICH Q3C thresholds.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately  validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The finished product manufacturer has 
adopted the ASMF holder’s analytical methods. Analytical methods are Ph. Eur. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used has been presented. 
Batch analysis data analysed by both active substance and finished product manufacturers is provided, 
demonstrating compliance with the proposed specifications. The batch data provided is considered to 
be sufficient. Consistency and uniformity of the active substance quality have been demonstrated.  
Stability 
Stability data from production scale batches under long term conditions (30±2ºC / 65±5% RH and 
30±2°C/ 75±5%) for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40±2ºC / 75±5% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Forced degradation studies were conducted and mass balance under different stressed conditions. The 
stress study has shown that that the analytical method for related substance in Abiraterone  Acetate is 
stability indicating and is suitable for the impurities testing. The study has demonstrated that the 
analytical procedure is stability indicating and is suitable for the tested parameters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/444189/2021  
Page 11/35 
 
 
 
 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months stored in the 
proposed container, with no special storage conditions. 
2.1.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a film-coated tablet for oral administration containing either 500 mg or 
1000 mg of abiraterone acetate. The film-coated tablets are presented as follows: 
500 mg: brown, oval-shaped film-coated tablets, debossed with “500” on one side, with dimensions 
18.9 mm  x 9.5 mm ± 5%. 
1000 mg: white to off-white, oval-shaped film-coated tablets, with a score line on one side and plain 
on the other side, with dimensions 23.1 mm x 11.1 mm ± 5%.  
The score-line in the 1000 mg film-coated tablets is only to facilitate breaking for ease of swallowing 
and not to divide into equal doses. The applicant has discussed the rationale for the presence of a 
score-line on the 1000 mg strength film-coated tablets and it was considered acceptable. A compendial 
test for sub-division of tablets is included in the 1000 mg tablet specification The applicant further 
supported this by demonstrating the stability of three validation batches, sub-divided and stored at 
30°C / 75% RH in Aluminium/Aluminium foil for 9 months and HDPE bottle without canister for a 
minimum of 10 months. 
Abiraterone Mylan 500 and 1000 mg film-coated tablets were developed with the objective of obtaining 
a generic product, physically and chemically stable for the assigned shelf-life period, equivalent to the 
reference product Zytiga, achieving an immediate release formulation matching the reference product 
in vivo.  
Based on the clinical and pharmacokinetic characteristics as well as the in vitro dissolution and 
physicochemical characteristics of the reference medicinal product, a quality target product profile 
(QTPP) was defined for Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg film-coated tablets.  
Based on the QTPP, the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the product were identified. These are still 
target elements of the QTPP and are ensured through an appropriate  pharmaceutical quality system 
and the control strategy. 
Abiraterone acetate is practically insoluble in water. Solubility testing of abiraterone acetate was 
carried out in different buffer aqueous media in a pH range of 1.2 to 9.8 showing non-pH dependent 
solubility. Abiraterone acetate is a BCS class IV compound with low solubility and low permeability 
across physiological pH range. 
All excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The selected ingredients 
for film coating have well known chemical, physical and microbial  characteristics and comply with 
relevant Ph. Eur. Monographs and EU 231/2012 Regulation and EU1333/2008 (specifications for food 
additives).

A compatibility study was performed to examine the interactions between the active substance and the 
proposed excipients. The powder blend samples were analysed for related substances, using the 
analytical methods described in section 3.2.P.5.2, and the results indicated that the impurity  profile of 
all samples was within the release specifications as described in section 3.2.P.5.1. Furthermore, the 
compatibility  of abiraterone acetate with all the excipients was verified through the stability studies 
under accelerated and long-term conditions (section 3.2.P.8.3).  
Solubility testing of abiraterone acetate was carried out in different buffer media in a pH range of 1.0 
to 6.8 and in water, at 37°C. 
The discriminatory power  was assessed by the comparison of the dissolution profiles of “side batches” 
manufactured by changing aspects of the formulation and process parameters  with the biobatch 
manufactured according to the proposed commercial  formulation and process. The discriminatory 
power of the dissolution method has thus been demonstrated satisfactorily. 
Essential similarity between the reference product and abiraterone acetate generic film-coated tablets 
has been shown through pharmaceutical equivalence testing and a pivotal bioequivalence study.  
A clinical bioequivalence study was conducted in order to compare  the bioavailability  of Abiraterone 
acetate 500 mg film-coated tablets and Zytiga® 500 mg film-coated tablets in healthy, adult, male 
subjects under fasting conditions. Based on the results, bioequivalence is considered demonstrated 
between test and reference formulation.    
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
The primary  packaging is aluminium-OPA/Alu/PVC or aluminium-PVC/PE/PVDC blisters for the 500 mg 
film-coated tablets and HDPE bottles with or without oxygen absorbing canister and closed with a PP 
child resistant closure for the 1000 mg film-coated tablets. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure systems has been validated by stability data and 
they are adequate for the intended use of the product.  
At D120 the applicant was requested to include information regarding the size of the oxygen canister 
and to consider whether to include a warning on it that it is not to be consumed. The applicant 
complied with the request, nevertheless, it is also suggested a clearer marking. The current version of 
the oxygen canister is accepted for granting a MA. However,  it is recommended to consider the 
addition of the suggested markings to ensure a safer finished product. A recommendation with this 
regard has been included in section 2.1.6. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: dispensing; sieving; granulation; blending; 
compression and film coating. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The IPCs are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and 
pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate  tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description, identification of abiraterone acetate (HPLC, UV), identification of titanium dioxide, 
identification of iron oxides, assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of 
Assessment report

mass (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dimension, microbiological  examination (Ph. 
Eur.).  
The proposed specifications are considered acceptable. The analytical methods used have been 
adequately described and appropriately  validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented. 
The potential presence of class 1 and Class 2A elemental impurities in the finished product has been 
assessed using a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. 
Batch analysis data on batches, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected 
above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data, it can 
be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on 
the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The risk assessment for the active substance was previously discussed in section 1.1.2. The overall risk 
assessment also considered possible sources of nitrosamines in the finished product, such as 
excipients, the manufacturing process, packaging materials, utilities etc. and concluded that there was 
no additional risk. Therefore, no changes to the control strategy for Abiraterone Mylan are necessary to 
mitigate potential contamination by nitrosamines.  
Batch analysis results were provided for industrial scale batches and pilot scale batch confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
The finished product is released onto the market based on the above release specification, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from production scale batches of 500 mg film-coated tablets stored in Aluminium-
OPA/Alu/PVC blisters and Aluminium-PVC/PE/PVDC blisters, and production scale batches of 1000 mg 
film-coated tablets stored in HDPE bottles and HDPE bottles with oxygen absorbing canister stored 
under long term conditions (25ºC ± 2ºC / 60% ± 5% RH), under intermediate conditions (30°C ± 2°C, 
65% ± 5% RH), and under accelerated conditions (40°C ± 2°C, 75% ± 5% RH) were presented 
according to the ICH guidelines. The batches of Abiraterone  Mylan 500 and 1000 mg film-coated 
tablets are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary  packaging 
proposed. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The stability results have 
demonstrated that Abiraterone 500 and 1000 mg film-coated tablets are chemically and 
microbiologically stable No significant changes in assay of active substance, impurity content and all 
other tested parameters  were observed.  
Stability testing of bulk product and intermediates packed in the intended storage containers as 
declared in the dossier, was conducted.  
In addition, one batch of each strength of finished product in each proposed commercial packaging 
format was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products. The results of the study indicate that upon direct exposure, the product is 
not sensitive to light, so for Abiraterone Mylan 500 mg and 1000 mg film-coated tablets in bottles and 
blisters, no special storage conditions with respect to light are required. 
Assessment report  
EMA/444189/2021  
Page 14/35 
 
 
 
A forced degradation study was also carried out with tablets in HDPE bottles with oxygen absorbing 
canister, HDPE bottles, blisters and the bulk storage container. This study demonstrates the stability-
indicating nature of the analytical methods. 
According to the obtained stability results under accelerated and long-term conditions packed in HDPE 
bottles with oxygen absorbing canister and HDPE bottles, there is no indication that Abiraterone film-
coated tablets are susceptible to deterioration and therefore no in-use stability studies have been 
performed in accordance with EMA’s Q&A on Quality Part 2. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months without special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.1.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical  aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. A MO was raised in relation to re-definition of a starting 
material (SM) in the initial synthetic route; it has been resolved by providing an alternative new 
synthetic route that was concluded acceptable. Another MO was raised concerning the 
milling/micronisation process that was neither described nor validated in the manufacturing process 
description in the ASMF; it has been resolved by the provision of the micronisation process. A 
specification for particle size distribution (PSD) was not included in the ASMF as the requirement is 
considered customer specific and the specification already included in the finished product 
manufacturer’s specification was deemed sufficient to ensure adequate control of the active substance 
PSD. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. Abiraterone Mylan film-coated tablets have been shown to be 
bioequivalent to the reference product.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there is one minor partially unresolved quality issue in relation to the 
marking of the canister in order to distinguish it from the film-coated tablets, having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. Based on that, a recommendation is issued.  
2.1.5.  Conclusions  on the chemical, pharmaceutical  and biological  aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be  acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Lactose monohydrate is 
the only material  of animal  origin used in the manufacture of Abiraterone  Acetate film-coated tablets. 
Data has been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety.

2.1.6.  Recommendation  for future quality development    
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
1. Additional marking  as requested during the procedure is  recommended for Abiraterone  Mylan 1000 
mg film-coated tablets to ensure a safer finished product. 
2.  The  applicant  confirms  that  comparative  dissolution testing  will  be  undertaken on  the  first  three 
production batches and the applicant will  not market  a batch until comparative  dissolution testing has 
been completed.  
3. The applicant has declared that they will base any future requests for scale-ups above the maximum 
batch size. 
2.2.  Non-clinical  aspects   
2.2.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental  risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Abiraterone Mylan manufactured by Mylan Ireland Limited is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all abiraterone acetate containing 
products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to 
be similar. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion  on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Abiraterone Mylan was provided and 
was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non-clinical 
studies were not considered necessary. 
2.3.  Clinical  aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction

Study design  
This was an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-sequence, four-period, single-dose, 
crossover fully replicate oral bioavailability  study to establish bioequivalence of Abiraterone Mylan 500 
mg tablets and Zytiga (abiraterone acetate) 500 mg film-coated tablets (MAH: Janssen-Cilag 
International NV, Belgium and sourced from Germany) in 28 healthy, adult, male subjects under 
fasting conditions. The objective of the study was to compare  the rate and extent of absorption of both 
products and to monitor the adverse events to ensure the safety of the subjects.  
Randomisation was done in blocks such that the design was balanced. The order of receiving the Test 
(T) and Reference (R) product for each subject during each period of the study was determined 
according to the randomisation schedule. The dosing (treatment) of Test (T) and Reference (R) product 
was divided into two sequences (TRTR/RTRT).  Subjects who were assigned sequence TRTR received 
Test product T in period 1 and 3 and reference product R in period 02 and 04. Subjects who were 
assigned sequence RTRT  received Reference product R in Period 01 and 03 and Test product T in 
period 2 and 4. 
Subjects took their assigned formulation, designated by the randomisation scheme, after at least a 10-
hour fast. Tablets were administered orally at scheduled dosing time in sitting posture with 240±2mL 
of water at ambient temperature.  Tablets were swallowed as a whole and were not chewed, crushed or 
divided. A washout period of 7 days was kept between drug administrations. 
The pre-dose blood sample of 2.0mL (0.00 hr) was collected within one hour prior to scheduled time 
for dosing. The post-dose blood samples of 2.0mL each was drawn at 0.33, 0.67, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 
1.75, 2.00, 2.25, 2.50, 2.75, 3.00, 3.33, 3.67, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00, 
36.00 and 48.00 hours after dosing in study.  
Test and reference products  
Abiraterone Mylan 500 mg tablets was compared to Zytiga (abiraterone acetate) 500 mg film-coated 
tablets of Janssen-Cilag International NV. 
Population(s)  studied   
28 healthy adult male human subjects were enrolled in two groups as per the protocol to ensure 
dosing of 24 subjects. The study was conducted in two Groups as per following: 
In group 01: 27 (Subject no. 01 to 27) healthy, adult, human male subjects were enrolled. 
In group 02: 01 (Subject no. 28) healthy, adult, human male subject was enrolled. 
A total of 25 subjects completed all the periods of the study as per the protocol. The dropouts are 
discussed below. Samples  collected from 28 subjects were analysed for abiraterone plasma 
concentrations. 
Twenty-eight (28) subjects were enrolled in the study and 25 subjects completed all the periods of the 
study. However Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed over 27 subjects who completed at least 
two periods of study as per approved protocol. One subject completed only one period of the study, 
hence excluded from Pharmacokinetic and Statistical analyses.

Analytical methods   
A validated LC-ESI-MS/MS bioanalytical method developed for the quantification of abiraterone in 
plasma was employed for subjects’ sample analysis. The quality control samples showed % Bias (mean 
accuracy) of -4.73 to -2.33 and % Precision (Coefficient of Variation - CV) of 1.75 to 2.80. 
Incurred Sample Reanalysis 
180 samples were identified for incurred sample reanalysis. 100.00% is the percentage of samples 
where the difference between the two values was less than 20% of the mean for chromatographic 
assays or less than 30% for the ligand binding assays.  
Pharmacokinetic  variables  
Primary parameters:  AUC0-t and Cmax  
Secondary parameters: AUC0-inf, AUC_%Extra_obs, Tmax, t1/2, λZ 
Statistical methods    
Descriptive statistics: Number of observations (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum,  median, 
maximum,  percentage co-efficient of variation (%CY) and geometric mean was calculated for 
concentration profile at each time points and pharmacokinetic parameters  for each formulation. 
Statistical analysis: Statistical analyses was performed on In-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters 
Cmax and AVCo_t of Abiraterone using the SAS® package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, VSA,  Version 
9.4 or higher). 
Analysis of  Variance: In-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters  Cmax  and AUCo_t was  analysed by 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) using PROC GLM in SAS® Software, Version 9.4 or higher.  
The Sequence effect was tested using the Subject (Sequence) effect as the error term.  The sequence 
effect was tested at the 0.10 level of significance and other main effects related to treatment and 
period was tested at the 0.05 level of significance. Each analysis of variance included calculation of 
least-square means, the difference between the adjusted formulation means and the standard error 
associated with the difference.Power: The power  of the ANOVA test to detect a 20% mean difference 
between test and reference formulations was reported. 
Two One-Sided test for bioequivalence: Two  one-sided 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of means 
between drug formulations were calculated for ln-transformed data of Cmax and AUC0-t. 
If the intra-subject co-efficient of variation of the reference formulation for Cmax was less than or 
equal to 30%, the conventional acceptance range of 80.00% - 125.00% for bioequivalence would 
apply to Cmax. The 90% confidence interval of the relative mean Cmax and AUC0-t of the test to 
reference formulation for ln-transformed data was to be within 80.00% to 125.00% for Abiraterone. 
For Cmax, the intra-subject co-efficient of variation for the reference formulation was evaluated.  
If the intra-subject co-efficient of variation of Cmax for the reference formulation was greater than 
30%, the acceptance range for 90% confidence interval is widened to a maximum of 69.84 – 
143.19%, which was applied with an intra-subject variability of ≥50% for the reference formulation. 
This is in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01/Corr **) applicable for highly variable drugs.

Population(s) studied   
Thirty (30) healthy adult male human subjects were enrolled as per the protocol  to ensure dosing of 24 
subjects. A total of 25 subjects completed all the periods of the study. Pharmacokinetic and Statistical 
analyses were performed on 28 subjects who completed at least two periods, in which the subject 
received the reference product in both periods, or where a test to reference comparison was possible. 
Analytical methods   
A validated LC-ESI-MS/MS bioanalytical method developed for the quantification of Abiraterone in 
Plasma was employed for subjects‟ sample analysis. The quality control samples showed % Bias 
(mean accuracy) of -2.28 to 0.58 and % Precision (Coefficient of Variation - CV) of 1.79 to 2.80. At the 
bioanalytical research facility after completion of analysis. 
Incurred Sample Reanalysis 
182 samples were identified for incurred sample reanalysis. 99.45% is the percentage of samples 
where the difference between the two values was less than 20% of the mean for chromatographic 
assays or less than 30% for the ligand binding assays.  
Pharmacokinetic variables  
Primary parameters:  AUC0-t and Cmax  
Secondary parameters: AUC0-inf, AUC_%Extra_obs, Tmax, t1/2, λZ 
Statistical  methods   
Descriptive statistics: Number of observations (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum,  median, 
maximum,  percentage co-efficient of variation (%CY) and geometric mean was calculated for 
concentration profile at each time points and pharmacokinetic parameters  for each formulation. 
Statistical analysis: Statistical analyses was performed on In-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters 
Cmax and AVCo_t of Abiraterone using the SAS® package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, VSA,  Version 
9.4 or higher). 
Analysis of Variance: In-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUCo_t was analysed by 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) using PROC GLM in SAS® Software, Version 9.4 or higher. The model 
statement of PROC GLM in SAS® Software included the fixed effects of Sequence, Treatment, Period 
and subject (Sequence).  
The Sequence effect was tested using the Subject (Sequence) effect as the error term.  The sequence 
effect was tested at the 0.10 level of significance and other main effects related to treatment and 
period was tested at the 0.05 level of significance. Each analysis of variance included calculation of 
least-square means, the difference between the adjusted formulation means and the standard error 
associated with the difference. Two One-Sided test for bioequivalence: Two one-sided 90% confidence 
intervals for the ratio of means between drug formulations were calculated for ln-transformed data of 
Cmax and AUC0-t. 
Power: The power of the ANOVA test to detect a 20% mean difference between test and reference 
formulations was reported. 
If the intra-subject co-efficient of variation of the reference formulation for Cmax was less than or 
equal to 30%, the conventional acceptance range of 80.00% - 125.00% for bioequivalence would

apply to Cmax. The 90% confidence interval of the relative mean Cmax and AUC0-t of the test to 
reference formulation for ln-transformed data was to be within 80.00% to 125.00% for Abiraterone. 
For Cmax, the intra-subject co-efficient of variation for the reference formulation was evaluated.  
If the intra-subject co-efficient of variation of Cmax for the reference formulation was greater than 
30%, the acceptance range for 90% confidence interval is widened to a maximum of 69.84 – 
143.19%, which was applied with an intra-subject variability of ≥50% for the reference formulation. 
This is in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01/Corr **) applicable for highly variable drugs.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
BE Study: 18-VIN-0695  
This study was submitted to establish bioequivalence of Abiraterone Mylan 500 mg tablets and Zytiga 
(abiraterone acetate) 500 mg film-coated tablets (MAH: Janssen-Cilag International NV, Belgium and 
sourced from Germany). The study was designed as an open label, balanced, randomised, two-
treatment, two-sequence, four-period, single-dose, crossover fully replicate study under fasting 
conditions. According to the SmPC of the originator, when abiraterone is administered with food, there 
is an increase in the systemic exposure of abiraterone. Hence, abiraterone tablets should not be taken 
with food. The design of a fasting bioequivalence study is considered appropriate.  The sampling periods 
are acceptable upon review of the graphs with ample time points around Tmax (approximately 2 
hours) and with an adequate wash-out period at greater than five times the half-life (approximately 15 
hours). The sampling frequency enabled an adequate estimation of Cmax. Both the clinical study and 
the bioanalytical site have been inspected by an EU competent authority. 
Certificates of analysis for both the test and reference products have been provided. The batch control 
results appear satisfactory and the batch size (10% of the proposed commercial  batch) and 
manufacturing date of the test product have been declared and are acceptable. The assay ranges are 
well within the 5% limit of each other in accordance with the Guideline on the investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01 Corr**). 
The population studied is also considered appropriate  and the main inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01). The subjects as per inclusion criteria were all male since in the 
absence of data, abiraterone is contraindicated in women due to safety concerns. The number of 
subjects not completing the study does not have an effect on the results, as 24 patients are enough to 
power the study. Protocol deviations listed in the report are considered minor and do not have a 
negative effect of the study results. The concomitant medication taken by subject 19 is accounted for 
in the bioanalytical method. 
The analytical methods used are acceptable and appropriate.  The chromatograms presented are 
acceptable and the 19 re-analysed samples have been adequately justified. The calibration curve is 
appropriate  (9 points) and the stability testing supports the conditions the samples were exposed to 
during collection and testing. The applicant has also provided all the validation reports and relevant 
supportive data together with certificates of analysis for the analyte standard and internal standards

used in the analytical method validation. The relevant SOPs have been provided and deemed valid. The 
Incurred sample  reanalysis was provided as well as information on the partial revalidation of the 
method. These are deemed acceptable. Co-administered drug effect was carried out including the 
concomitant medication administered during the clinical phase. The bioanalytical method was audited 
and a signed quality assurance statement dated 05 April 2019 was provided. 
The pharmacokinetic variables chosen for the study are adequate. The appropriate  variables were 
measured and the statistical methodology is accepted. The sampling schedule provides adequate 
estimation of Cmax. Statistical data and a graphical representation to cover the plasma concentration 
time curve, long enough to provide an estimate of the extent of absorption, have been provided.   
The intra-subject variability  of Reference formulation for Cmax of Abiraterone was 34.01%. Intra-
subject variability of Reference formulation for Cmax is greater than 30%, hence the bioequivalence 
acceptance range of Cmax was widened to 77.77% - 128.59% based on the intra-subject variability of 
reference formulation for Abiraterone.  Even though there was a widening in the acceptance 
bioequivalence range for Cmax pre-specified in the protocol,  the 90% confidence intervals for 
geometric least square mean ratio of (T/R) for ln-transformed Cmax was found to be 85.19% - 
115.31%, which falls within the acceptance bioequivalence range of 80.00 – 125.00%. The 90% 
confidence intervals for the ratios of test and reference product (least-squares means) derived from 
the analysis of log transformed pharmacokinetic parameter   AUC0-t  was within 80-125% acceptance 
range for Abiraterone.  These are in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01/Corr **). No statistically significant treatment or 
sequence differences were observed for any of the pharmacokinetic parameters involved in the 
assessment of bioequivalence. Bioequivalence with the reference product has been shown. 
The two treatments were also well tolerated by the subjects enrolled in the study. The adverse events 
seen during the study were all included in the SmPC and there are no new concerns arising from the 
study. The two products had similar  safety profiles. 
BE Study: 19-VIN-0187  
This study was submitted to establish bioequivalence of Abiraterone Mylan 1000 mg tablets  and Zytiga 
(abiraterone acetate) 500 mg film-coated tablets at a dose of 1000mg (2 tablets of 500mg) (MAH: 
Janssen-Cilag International NV, Belgium and sourced from Germany). The study was designed as an 
open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-sequence, four-period, fully replicate under 
fasting conditions. According to the SmPC of the originator when abiraterone is administered with food, 
there is an increase in the systemic exposure of abiraterone. Hence, abiraterone tablets should not be 
taken with food. The design of a fasting bioequivalence study is considered appropriate.  The sampling 
periods are acceptable upon review of the graphs with ample time points around Tmax (approximately 
2 hours) and with an adequate wash-out period at greater than five times the half-life (approximately 
15 hours). The sampling frequency enabled an adequate estimation of Cmax. Both the clinical study 
site and the bioanalytical site have been inspected by an EU competent authority. 
Certificates of analysis for both the test and reference products have been provided. The batch control 
results appear satisfactory and the batch size (10% of the proposed commercial  batch) and 
manufacturing date of the test product have been declared and are acceptable. The assay ranges are 
well within the 5% limit of each other in accordance with the Guideline on the investigation of

subjects not completing the study will not have an effect on the results as 24 patients are enough to 
power the study.  Protocol deviations are considered minor and will not have a negative effect on the 
study results. The concomitant medications taken by subjects 01, 04, 12 and 15 are accounted for, in 
the bioanalytical method. 
The analytical methods used are acceptable and appropriate.  The chromatograms presented are 
acceptable and the 3 re-analysed samples have been adequately justified. The calibration curve is 
appropriate  (10 points) and the stability testing supports the conditions the samples were exposed to 
during collection and testing. The applicant has also provided all the validation reports and relevant 
supportive data together with certificates of analysis for the analyte standard and internal standards 
used in the analytical method validation. The relevant SOPs have been provided and deemed valid. The 
Incurred sample  reanalysis was provided as well as information on the partial revalidations of the 
method. These are deemed acceptable. Co-administered drug effect was carried out including the 
concomitant medications administered during the clinical phase. The method was audited and the 
report is dated 25 October 2019. 
The pharmacokinetic variables chosen for the study are adequate. The appropriate  variables were 
measured and statistical methodology is accepted. The sampling schedule provides adequate 
estimation of Cmax. Statistical data and a graphical representation to cover the plasma concentration 
time curve long enough to provide an estimate of the extent of absorption, have been provided.   
As per protocol,  subjects who have completed at least 2 periods where both are the reference products 
or where a test to reference comparison is possible, were included in the pharmacokinetic and 
statistical analysis. A total of 24 subjects completed all four periods of the study, 2 subjects completed 
three periods of the study, 2 subjects completed two periods of the study, and 2 subjects were 
withdrawn/dropped out from the study. Hence, a total of 28 subjects were included in the 
pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis in line with the protocol.   
The intra-subject variability  of Reference formulation for Cmax of Abiraterone evaluated on 28 subjects 
was 33.80%. Intra-subject variability  of Reference formulation for Cmax is greater than 30%, hence 
the bioequivalence acceptance range of Cmax was widened to 77.88% - 128.40% based on the intra-
subject variability of reference formulation for Abiraterone. The 90% confidence interval for geometric 
least square mean ratio of (T/R) was 95.65% - 126.50% for pharmacokinetic parameter Cmax, which 
was within the acceptance range of 77.88% - 128.40%. 
The widening of the pharmacokinetic criteria is in line with the requirements of the Guideline on the 
Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 01/Corr**) section 4.1.10 Highly 
variable drugs. The study is of a replicate design and the within-subject variability for Cmax of the 
reference compound has been demonstrated to be more  than 30%. The request for widened interval 
was prospectively specified in the protocol.   
In line with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 
01/Corr **) section 4.1.10 Highly variable drugs, the applicant was requested to discuss with 
supporting documentation that a wider difference in Cmax is not considered clinically relevant. The 
applicant conducted additional statistical analysis of the results of the BE study to assess whether the 
calculated intra-subject variability is a reliable estimate and not the result of outliers (data not shown). 
Analysis did not identify any outlying value; therefore, the calculated intra-subject variability of Cmax 
is a reliable  estimate and it is not the result of outliers. Given that the intra-subject variability of the 
Reference product for Cmax is > 30%, the acceptance criteria for Cmax can be widened. 
The geometric least square mean ratio (T/R) was found 110.00% for pharmacokinetic parameter 
Cmax, which was within the conventional acceptance range of 80.00% to 125.00%. The 90% 
Assessment report

confidence intervals calculated for AUC0-t for abiraterone 1000 mg fall within the 80.00%-125.00% 
acceptance range after single dose administration under fasting conditions.  
The two treatments were also well tolerated by the subjects enrolled in the study. The adverse events 
seen during the study were all included in the SmPC and there are no new concerns arising from the 
study. The two products had similar  safety profiles.

Periodic  Safety Update Reports submission  requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Product information 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Duloxetine Mylan 30 mg hard gastro-resistant capsules 
and to Zytiga 250 mg tablets. The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found 
acceptable. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of abiraterone acetate film-coated tablets. The reference 
product Zytiga is indicated for metastatic prostate cancer. No nonclinical studies have been provided 
for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active 
substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does 
not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and 
safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on 
information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
Two bioequivalence studies were submitted. The study designs were considered adequate to evaluate 
bioequivalence and were in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling 
points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out periods were adequate. The analytical methods were 
validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
Both studies met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the reference 
product. Bioequivalence was demonstrated. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Abiraterone Mylan is favourable in the following indication: 
Abiraterone Mylan is indicated with prednisone or prednisolone for: 
• 
• 
• 
the treatment of newly diagnosed high risk metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer 
(mHSPC) in adult men in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). 
the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in adult men who are 
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic after failure of androgen deprivation therapy in whom 
chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. 
the treatment of mCRPC in adult men whose disease has progressed on or after a docetaxel-
based chemotherapy regimen.

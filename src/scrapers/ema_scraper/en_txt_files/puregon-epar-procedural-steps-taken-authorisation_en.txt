Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The  Rapporteur’s  initial  Assessment  Report  was  circulated  to  all  Members  of  the  previous 
CPMP on 31 October 1994. 
The  Co-Rapporteur  initial  Assessment  Report  was  circulated  to  all  Members  of  the  previous 
CPMP on 25 October 1994. 
The consolidated list of comments as agreed by the previous CPMP was sent to the company on 
5 December 1994. 
The company submitted the responses to the consolidated list of questions on 8 June 1995. 
The  “Responses  Assessment  Report”  on  preclinical,  clinical  and  pharmaceutical  responses 
provided  by  the  company  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  by  the  Rapporteur  on 
11 September 1995. 
The  “Responses  Assessment  Report”  on  preclinical  and  clinical  responses  provided  by  the 
company was circulated to all CPMP Members by the Co-Rapporteur on 12 September 1995. 
The  “Responses  Assessment  Report”  on  pharmaceutical  responses  provided  by  the  company 
was circulated to all CPMP Members by the Co-Rapporteur on 21 September 1995. 
A second list of outstanding quality issues, as agreed by the CPMP was sent to the company on 
31 October 1995. 
The company submitted the responses to these points on 1 November 1995. 
The  Assessment  Report  of  the  Rapporteur  on  these  outstanding  points  was  circulated  on  7 
November  1995.  The  unresolved  pharmaceutical  points  were  discussed  at  the  CPMP 
Biotechnology  Working  Party  on  13  and  14  November  1995.  The  company  on 
8  November  1995  requested  an  oral  hearing  before  Biotechnology  Working  Party  on 
14 November 1995. The presentation answered most of the outstanding quality issues. However 
major concerns still remained because of the lack of information on batch analysis for process 
validation for the finished product generated in the Irish manufacturing site. The Biotechnology 
Working Party therefore requested the submission of analytical data.

The  Rapporteur  and  Co-Rapporteur  prepared  an  annex  to  the  Rapporteur  initial  Assessment 
Report  jointly  on  responses  to  the  6  remaining  quality  points  discussed  during  the  CPMP 
Biotechnology Working Party on 14 November 1995. 
The CPMP in its meeting on 21-22 November 1995 considered and adopted the report from the 
Biotechnology  Working  Party.  With  reference  to  the  manufacturing  process  validation  for  the 
finished  product  produced  at  the  Irish  manufacturing  site,  the  further  data  submitted  on  15 
December  1995  by  the  company  were  considered  adequate  to  support  batch-to-batch 
consistency. 
The CPMP issued on 20 December 1995 four opinions for granting a marketing authorisation to 
the different strengths/presentations of Puregon.

a delayed and decreased exposure to ticagrelor has been 
observed in healthy volunteers and patients with acute 
coronary syndromes (ACS) treated with morphine (35% 
reduction in ticagrelor exposure). This interaction may be 
related to reduced gastrointestinal motility and applies to 
other opioids. The clinical relevance is unknown, but data 
indicate the potential for reduced ticagrelor efficacy in 
patients co-administered ticagrelor and morphine. In 
patients with ACS, in whom morphine cannot be withheld 
and fast P2Y12 inhibition is deemed crucial, the use of a 
parenteral P2Y12 inhibitor may be considered. The package 
leaflet has been updated accordingly.

SmPC and PL 
The MAH provided additional information on the proposed 
about an additional mechanism of action (adenosine 
pathway) supported by pharmacodynamic data from 
nonclinical and clinical publications. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to update the contact 
details for the Bulgarian local representative in the 
Package Leaflet.

mechanism of action; the non-clinical data provided 
support that ticagrelor increases the level of adenosine. In 
addition, several clinical studies on the adenosine effects 
have been provided. Three main clinical studies are 
noteworthy; one in healthy volunteers and 2 in ACS. The 
studies of Wittfeldt et al 2013 and Bonello et al 2013 
provided clearest evidence of these effects. In the third 
study of Alexopoulos et al 2013, as previously noted, a link 
between the observed increases in adenosine and clinical 
outcomes has not been clearly elucidated, limiting the 
usefulness of the data. However, overall available data 
show that ticagrelor increases the levels of adenosine. 
Based on these data the CHMP consider it acceptable to 
include additional information in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
II/0021 
Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC, based 
24/07/2014

SmPC and PL 
To support the changes of SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2 the 
on data from the clinical study D5130C00070, in 
order to add information about the bioequivalence of 
crushed tablets mixed with water and administered 
orally or via nasogastric tube compared to whole 
tablets. In addition, sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the 
SmPC have been updated in order to delete 
dexamethasone from the list of strong CYP3A 
inducers with the potential to decrease the exposure 
and efficacy of ticagrelor. The Package Leaflet has 
MAH conducted a comparative bioavailability study 
(D5130C00076) to evaluate alternative methods of 
administration in which the administration of crushed 
Ticagrelor tablets, 90 mg, was compared to whole 
Ticagrelor tablets, 90 mg. Based on the results of the study 
it can be concluded that there is no difference in the 
bioavailability of 90 mg ticagrelor crushed tablet 
administered orally and 90 mg ticagrelor when 
administered as a whole tablet and also no difference 
Page 10/18
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
been updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took 
the opportunity to update the contact details for the 
Bulgarian local representative in the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

between the dispersed ticagrelor 90 mg tablet suspended in 
water and administered through a nasogastric tube and 90 
mg ticagrelor when administered as a whole tablet. The t 
max of ticagrelor shifted and was found at 1 hour for the 
crushed tablet administered orally and through a 
nasogastric tube versus 2 hours for the whole tablet, 
however this shift is not considered clinically relevant. 
Dexamethasone is currently described as a strong CYP3A 
inducer with a potential decrease in exposure and efficacy. 
Recent guidance and literature indicate that 
dexamethasone can be removed from the list of examples 
of strong CYP3A4 inducers that may result in reduced 
efficacy of ticagrelor. The MAH provided appropriate 
justifications to support the changes in section 4.4 and 4.5 
of the SmPC. Based on the provided references on the 
potential for interaction with dexamethasone it is agreed 
that dexamethasone should not be classified as a strong 
inducer of CYP3A4 as the inducing effect of dexamethasone 
seems to be less pronounced than the effect of rifampicin. 
This conclusion is mainly based on the study by Hellmann 
et all. Although it is still not clear whether dexamethasone 
should be classified as a weak or a moderate 3A4 inducer, 
the deletion of dexamethasone from the list of strong 
inhibitors is sufficiently justified.

dizziness in acute coronary syndrome patients taking 
ticagrelor (section 4.7). In addition, update to 
section 4.8 of the SmPC to add information regarding 
fatal intracranial bleedings in the postmarketing 
experience. These modifications were proposed 
following the recommendations from the Assessment 
Report for PSUR 4. 
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.

new additional data submitted by the MAH 
recommended to modify sections 4.5, 4.7 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC to include respectively: 
- Information about results of the Holmberg food 
interaction study with grapefruit juice with the proposed 
wording: ‘A 2-fold increase of ticagrelor exposure was 
observed after consumption of large quantities of grapefruit 
juice (3x 200ml)’, 
- A warning that patients who are affected by dizziness 
should be advised not to drive or use machinery given that 
cumulatively 68 cases of dizziness have been reported 
post-marketing,  
- A statement that cases of intracranial bleedings, including 
fatal cases, have been reported during post-marketing. It 
was not possible to reliably estimate frequency of events 
during post-marketing use, thus the estimated frequency 
refers to the PLATO study. Fatal intracranial haemorrhage 
(ICH) in PLATO was 0.12% which meets the criteria for a 
frequency of uncommon.

SmPC, Annex 
Several events which could possibly be associated with 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.3 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order 
to add safety information regarding hypersensitivity 
including angioedema. The Package Leaflet was 
proposed to be updated in accordance. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to propose 
minor corrections in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 
SmPC and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD 
template version 8.0. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
II and PL 
hypersensitivity reactions coming from postmarketing and 
clinical trials experience were reported by the MAH. From 
the 75 cases reported 12 were considered serious and 3 
were identified as possibly related to treatment with 
ticagrelor. These events included angioedema as adverse 
hypersensitivity event and were all retrieved from post-
marketing experience. Based on these results the CHMP 
supported the inclusion of “hypersensitivity including 
angioedema” under frequency “uncommon” in section 4.8 
of the SmPC.

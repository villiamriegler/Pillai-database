2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ibandronic acid is a 3rd generation bisphosphonate which inhibits bone resorption. It is an analogue of 
pyrophosphate, the naturally occurring inhibitor of mineralization in bone. It is taken up by osteoclasts 
and inhibits their bone resorbing activity in a dose-dependent manner. It is given orally or 
intravenously, and is used in the prevention of skeletal events in breast cancer patients with bone 
metastases, in the treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, and in the treatment of post-
menopausal osteoporosis.  
The safety and efficacy profile of ibandronic acid has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, 
details of which can be found in the EPAR for Bonviva and Bondronat. In addition, there is a long-term 
post-marketing experience contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this 
application is a generic application referring to the reference medicinal products Bondronat and 
Bonviva, summary of the clinical data of Ibandronic acid is available and no new clinical studies, except 
a bioequivalence study, have been conducted with Ibandronic Acid Teva.   
The indication proposed for Ibandronic Acid Teva 50 mg is the same as the authorised indication for 
the reference medicinal product Bondronat: 
Ibandronic Acid Teva is indicated for the prevention of skeletal events (pathological fractures, bone 
complications requiring radiotherapy or surgery) in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is one 50 mg film-coated tablet daily. 
The indication proposed for Ibandronic Acid Teva 150 mg is the same as the authorised indication for 
the reference medicinal product Bonviva: 
Ibandronic Acid Teva is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at 
increased risk of fracture. A reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy 
on femoral neck fractures has not been established.  
Posology 
The recommended dose is one 150 mg film-coated tablet once a month. The tablet should preferably 
be taken on the same date each month.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Ibandronic Acid Teva is presented as film-coated tablets containing 50 mg and 150mg of ibandronic 
acid as active substance. The excipients used in the preparation of the film-coated tablets are well 
known excipients such as Cellulose microcrystalline, Povidone K-30, Crospovidone (type A),Silica 
colloidal anhydrous and Stearic acid. Other ingredients are defined in the SPC, section 6.1. 
Ibandronic Acid Teva film-coated tablets are packaged in PVC/Aclar/PVC – Aluminium blisters in 
cardboard boxes. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The active substance in this product is ibandronate sodium monohydrate or  3-(N-methyl-N-pentyl) 
amino-1-hydropropane-1, 1- diphosphonic acid, monosodium salt, monohydrate, and has the following 
structure: 
Ibandronate  sodium  monohydrate  is  an  off  white  to  white  coloured  powder.  It  is  sparingly  soluble  in 
water  across  the  pH  range  or  3  to  8  and  has  a  pKa  of  6.0.  Ibandronate  sodium  monohydrate  is  also 
slightly hygroscopic in nature.  
Ibandronate  sodium  monohydrate  has  no  chiral  centres  and  is  therefore  not  optically  active.  It  has 
different  polymorphic  forms  and  the  B  polymorphic  form  is  reported  to  be  the  form  routinely 
manufactured by the ASMF holder, as determined by X-ray diffraction studies. 
2.2.2.1.  Manufacture 
Information about manufacturing process has been provided using Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. A three step synthesis has been well described.  Controls of critical steps and intermediates 
are sufficient to ensure quality of the final compound. 
The  final  structure  of  ibandronate  sodium  monohydrate  is  stated  to  be  assured  by  the  full 
characterisation  of  the  starting  material  as  well  as  the  controls  exercised  during  the  synthetic  route. 
The chemical structure of ibandronate sodium monohydrate has been confirmed by spectroscopy (IR, 
UV,  1H-NMR  and  13C-NMR),  elemental  analysis  and  mass  spectrometry.  The  physical  characteristics 
have also been determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and DSC studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/598319/2010  
Page 6/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ibandronate sodium monohydrate is a not a chiral molecule and therefore has no optical isomers. XRD 
and  DSC  data  have  demonstrated  that  polymorphic  form  B  is  indeed  manufactured  routinely  by  the 
defined  synthetic  route.    For  confirmation,  an  XRD  polymophic  form  test  is  included  in  the  drug 
substance specification and is also monitored during stability. 
2.2.2.2.  Specification 
The  drug  substance  specification  includes  tests  for  physical  appearance,  solubility,  identification  (IR 
and  HPLC),  loss  of  drying,  heavy  metals,  related  substances  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  residual  solvents 
(GC),sodium content and physical form by XRD. 
A  detailed  description  for  all  analytical  methods  was  provided.  Full  method  validation  data  was 
provided  for  the  in-house  analytical  methods  (HPLC  and  GC).In  general  analytical  methods  proposed 
are suitable to control the quality of the drug substance. 
Impurities have been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety.  
Data on three production scale batches of ibandronate sodium monohydrate have been provided by the 
ASMF Holder and the requirements in the drug substance specification were met. 
2.2.2.3. 
 Stability 
Stability data has been provided from four batches of material stored at ICH long term conditions  
Four  commercial  batches  have  been  stored  under  ICH  long  term  conditions  (up  to  24  months  at 
25˚C/65%RH  and  6  months  at  40°C/  75%  RH).   The  data  demonstrates  that  the  active  substance  is 
stable.  No adverse stability trends are observed.  
The parameters investigated during stability included parameters such as description, identification, 
loss on drying, XRD, assay and related substances. This is acceptable as the other parameters are not 
considered to be stability-indicating. The primary packaging for the stability batches is stated to be the 
commercial packaging 
The stability studies confirmed the proposed re-test period with no specific storage conditions. 
2.2.3.   Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1. 
 Pharmaceutical Development 
The proposed product was developed to be an immediate release film-coated tablet for oral 
administration, identical to the innovator product in terms of quantitative amount of ibandronic acid.  
The  excipients  selected  for  the  formulation  are  commonly  used  in  pharmaceutical  formulations.  The 
major  excipient,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  was  selected  as  filler  with  stearic  acid  as  a  lubricant. 
Colloidal  anhydrous  silica  was  selected  to  act  as  glidant,  povidone  as  a  binder  and  crospovidone  as 
disintegrant.  
A comparison was made of the compositions of the Teva product and the innovator 50mg and 150mg 
products sourced from the UK; the main difference in compositions is the lack of lactose monohydrate 
in  the  Ibandronic  Acid  Teva  formulations.  This  difference  in  formulation  has  no  clinical  significance  – 
the two products have been shown to be bioequivalent.

Comparative  dissolution  profiles  between  the  proposed  50mg  and  150mg  product  and  the  respective 
Bonviva and Bondronat innovator products showed that the dissolution of the proposed and innovator 
products for both strengths including the clinical batches is considered to be similar. 
The primary container closure system  being utilized for ibandronic acid 50mg and 150mg  film-coated 
tablets is stated to be PVC/Aclar/PVC-Aluminium blisters.  
2.2.3.2. 
 Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is divided into eight main steps: Preheating, Granulation, Intermediate 
blending I, Intermediate blending II, Final blending, Compression, Coating and Packaging. 
The critical steps in the manufacturing process to be monitored were identified as final blending, 
compression and coating. 
A  process  validation  protocol  has  been  provided  for  the  validation  of  the  manufacturing  process  for 
three  consecutive  production  batches  of  50mg  and  150mg  ibandronic  acid  tablets.  The  protocol 
includes  information  on  additional  testing  to  be  carried  out  during  process  validation.  Reference  has 
been  made  to  validated  procedures  for  the  finished  product  for  the  assay  and  blend  uniformity  tests 
during process validation. The validation protocol is considered to be acceptable. 
2.2.3.3. 
 Product specification 
The product specification is standard for tablets and contains tests with suitable limits for appearance, 
identification  (HPLC  and  IR),  dissolution,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (by  mass  variation),  assay, 
impurities and degradation products (HPLC) and microbial limits (PhEur).  
Analytical  procedures  have  been  described  for  routine  testing  of  the  ibandronic  acid  tablets  to  the 
proposed  specifications.  Validation  data  has  been  provided  for  HPLC  procedures  for  the  assay, 
impurities and for dissolution of the ibandronic acid finished product. In addition, the specificity of the 
IR  identification  procedure  has  been  validated  to  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  interference  on  the  IR 
spectrum with the formulation excipients. 
Batch analysis data have been provided for two pilot scale batches of each strength of ibandronic acid 
tablets.  The  provided  batch  analyses  data  demonstrated  that  the  batches  manufactured  comply  with 
the  currently  proposed  specification.  Impurities  and  degradation  products  have  been  evaluated  and 
found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. 
2.2.3.4. 
 Stability of the product 
Stability studies were carried out in two batches of each strength under ICH conditions of 25ºC/60%RH 
(long  term,  12 months)  and  40ºC/75%RH  (accelerated,  6 months)  packed  in  the  proposed  primary 
blister packaging. The data shows no adverse stability trends and all specifications are met.   
Assessment report  
EMA/598319/2010  
Page 8/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, two stability studies have been completed on Ibandronic Acid Teva (one in 50mg and one 
in  150mg)  in  the  proposed  bulk  packaging  at  15-25ºC/max  70%RH  for  6  months.  No  significant 
change  in  assay,  impurities  or  dissolution  was  observed  after  bulk  storage  for  6  months.  A  holding 
period of 6 months for bulk tablets was therefore accepted. 
Photostability  studies  have  been  conducted  for  one  batch  of  50mg  in  accordance  with  ICH 
requirements. The drug product was found not be light sensitive. 
Based  on  the  stability  data  the  proposed  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  defined  in  the  SPC  are 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the drug substance and drug product have 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Ibandronic acid is a well known active substance. Its pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and 
toxicological properties are well characterised. No further non-clinical studies are therefore required.  
Ibandronic Acid Teva is a generic product that will be prescribed interchangeably with other similar 
products already marketed in Europe. The introduction of this product into the market is unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales of ibandronic acid containing products and thus 
an increased exposure to the environment is unlikely. For this reason, an environmental risk 
assessment is not considered necessary. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
The CHMP assessment addressed pharmacokinetic data in respect of a single bioequivalence study 
which investigates the 150 mg strength only.  
Assessment report

Exemption 
The applicant has provided a justification for a biowaiver for Ibandronic Acid Teva 50 mg film-coated 
tablets on the basis that the following criteria are satisfied (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98): 
• 
The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturer and process. 
Ibandronate 50 mg film-coated tablet and Ibandronate 150 mg film-coated tablet are both 
manufactured by Teva Pharmaceutical Works Private Limited Company by the same manufacturing 
process.  
• 
The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same. 
Ibandronate 50 mg film-coated tablet and Ibandronate 150 mg film-coated tablet have the same 
qualitative composition. 
• 
The ratio between amounts of active substance and excipients is the same, or, in the case of 
preparations containing a low concentration of the active substance (less than 5%), the ratio 
between the amounts of excipients is similar. 
The ratio between amounts of active substance and excipients is the same for both strengths of the 
product. 
• 
The dissolution profile should be similar under identical conditions for the additional strengths 
and the strength of the batch used in the bioequivalence study. 
Ibandronate 50 mg film-coated tablet and Ibandronate 150 mg film-coated tablet show similar 
dissolution profiles. 
• 
The drug input has been shown to be linear over the therapeutic dose range (if this is not the 
case the strengths where the sensitivity is largest to identify differences in the two products 
should be used) 
As stated in section 5.2 of the proposed SPC for the 150 mg strength: 
“The absorption of ibandronic acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract is rapid after oral administration 
and plasma concentrations increase in a dose-proportional manner up to 50 mg oral intake, with 
greater than dose-proportional increases seen above this dose.” (This wording is identical to that found 
in the Bonviva SPC). 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1 - 
Jan 2010), in case of non-linear pharmacokinetics there may be a difference between different 
strengths in the sensitivity to detect potential differences between formulations. If bioequivalence has 
been demonstrated at the strength(s) that are most sensitive to detect a potential difference between 
products, in vivo bioequivalence studies for the other strength(s) can be waived. 
Since, according to Bonviva SmPC: "... plasma concentrations increase in a dose-proportional manner 
up to 50 mg oral intake, with greater than dose-proportional increases seen above this dose", the 
results of the provided bioequivalence study, which was conducted with the higher (and thus most 
sensitive) dose, using the higher strength (150mg), can also be extrapolated to the 50mg strength.

2.4.1.  GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement confirming that clinical trials conducted outside the European 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC and in 
compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
2.4.2.  Clinical Studies 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The absorption of ibandronic acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract is rapid after oral administration. 
Maximum  observed  plasma  concentrations  are  reached  within  0.5  to  2  hours  (median  1  hour)  in  the 
fasted  state  and  absolute  bioavailability  is  about  0.6%.  The  extent  of  absorption  is  impaired  when 
taken  together  with  food  or  beverages  (other  than  plain  water).  After  initial  systemic  exposure, 
ibandronic  acid  rapidly  binds  to  bone  or  is  excreted  into  urine.  There  is  no  evidence  that  ibandronic 
acid  is  metabolized  in  animals  or  humans.  The  absorbed  fraction  of  ibandronic  acid  is  removed  from 
the  circulation  via  bone  absorption  (estimated  to  be  40-50%)  and  the  remainder  is  eliminated 
unchanged  by  the  kidney.  The  unabsorbed  fraction  of  ibandronic  acid  is  eliminated  unchanged  in  the 
faeces.  The  range  of  observed  apparent  half-lives  is  broad  and  dependent  on  dose  and  assay 
sensitivity, but the apparent terminal half-life is generally in the range of 10-60 hours.  
A  bioequivalence  study  was  conducted  to  compare  the  bioavailability  of  Ibandronic  acid  150  mg  film-
coated  tablets  (batch  no.  0180908)  and  Bonviva  150  mg  film-coated  tablets  (batch  no.B1053)  in 
healthy male and female volunteers under fasting conditions. 
Methods  
This was a single centre, single dose, randomised, laboratory-blinded, 4-period, 2-sequence, replicate 
design in healthy male and female subjects under fasting conditions.  
A  total  of  70  healthy  adult  male  and  female  subjects  were  randomised.  68  were  included  in  the 
statistical analysis. After a supervised overnight fast of 10 hours, subjects received a single oral dose 
of  the  assigned  formulation  with  240  mL  water.  The  washout  period  was  at  least  21  days, 
corresponding to more than 10 times the expected half-life of ibandronic acid.  
Blood samples were collected at baseline, and at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 minutes, 1 hour, 1 hour 15mins, 
1hour  30mins,  1hour  45minutes,  2  hours,  2  hours  30  mins,  and  then  3,  4,  6,  8,  10,  12,  16  and  24 
hours  after  drug  administration.  Plasma  was  analysed  for  ibandronate  by  means  of  a  validated  HPLC 
method using MS/MS detection.  
The study design is considered acceptable by the CHMP. A fasting study is appropriate, as Ibandronic 
Acid Teva is to be taken in the fasting state, according to the SmPC. The washout period was 
sufficiently long.

The applicant stated that the study was performed in compliance with GCP. The final protocol 
(amendment 02) and the final informed consent forms were approved by an institutional review board 
(ETHIPRO) on 19 November 2008. Informed consent was obtained from all study subjects.  
Test and reference products   
Ibandronic  Acid  150  mg  tablet  by  Teva  Pharm.  Works  Private  Ltd.  Co.  (batch  No.0180908,  exp.  date 
03/2009) was compared to Bonviva 150 mg film-coated tablet by Roche Pharma AG, Germany (Batch 
No: B1053., from the UK, exp. date 03/2010). 
Population(s) studied   
Standard  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  applied.  Inclusion  criteria  included  male  and  female, 
non-  and  ex-smokers,  aged  18-55  inclusive,  BMI  19-29  kg/m2  inclusive,  and  in  good  health  (as 
assessed  by  medical  history  and  examination,  ECG,  standard  haematological  and  biochemical 
parameters, urinalysis, pregnancy test).  
The study population of 70 included 31 women. Ethnicity for the majority of participants was reported 
as white. Two subjects were black and three were Asian. The age range was 18-55 and the BMI range 
was 19.4 to 29.6 kg/m2.  
Of the 70 randomised patients, 68 were included in the statistical analysis. One patient was excluded 
at the end of period 1, due to a positive amphetamines test; another patient withdrew from the study 
at the end of period 1 due to adverse events (insomnia, injury). All other patients had measurements 
for at least 2 periods and were included in the analysis, and 59 of the 68 patients provided data for all 
4 periods. 
Due  to  errors  in  the  collection  of  blood  samples  around  the  time  of  Cmax  in  period  3,  the  applicant 
considered  that  8  patients  did  not  have  their  concentration-time  curve  adequately  characterised  for 
this period. These patients had their period 3 data excluded from the main analysis, although all other 
periods  were  included.  A  sensitivity  analysis  including  this  data  was  provided  by  the  applicant.  This 
approach was considered by the CHMP. 
There  were  140  blood  sampling  time  deviations.  Time  deviations  greater  than  or  equal  to  2  minutes 
were adjusted to reflect actual sampling times. Other protocol deviations reported were minor and not 
considered likely to affect the pharmacokinetic conclusion.  
Analytical methods   
Ibandronate in human plasma was analysed by means of a validated HPLC method using MS/MS 
detection.  
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Statistical and pharmacokinetic analyses were generated using a software developed by the CRO, and 
SAS® version 9.1.  
The  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  interest  for  this  study  were  Cmax  and  AUC0-t.  The 
secondary  pharmacokinetic  parameters  Tmax,  AUC∞,  AUCt/∞,  Kel  and  T½el  were  also  calculated. 
Parameters  were  estimated  using  a  non-compartmental  approach  with  a  log-linear  terminal  phase 
assumption.

Statistical methods   
The data were analysed using a random Analysis of Variance model with repeated measures. The fixed 
factors  included  in  this  model  were  treatment,  period,  and  sequence.  A  random  factor  was  added  for 
the subject effect where the heterogeneity of the variances was assumed. A repeated factor was also 
added  to  model  the  replicates  made  on  each  treatment  and  heterogeneity  of  the  variances  across 
treatment groups was assumed. 
Acceptance criteria 
In  order  to  demonstrate  bioequivalence,  the  90%  confidence  interval  ratio  of  geometric  means  for 
Cmax was to be within the acceptance range 75 - 133%. The applicant justified this widening because 
data  from  a  previous  study  indicated  that  the  intra-subject  coefficient  of  variation  for  plasma 
ibandronate Cmax was about 42% - ibandronate exhibited a high intra-individual variability with a CV 
greater  than  30%.  The  applicant  also  stated  that  pharmacokinetic  parameters  did  not  significantly 
affect the clinical response. AUCt was to be analysed using the standard 80 – 125% acceptance range.

When  the  8  subjects  who  did  not  contribute  period  3,  data  were  included  in  the  analysis,  the  90% 
confidence intervals for AUCt, AUC∞ and Cmax were 90.57 – 105.83%, 90.35 – 105.44% and 87.40 – 
104.83% respectively. These are all within the range 80 – 125%.  
All  subjects  had  an  AUCt  value  that  was  at  least  80%  of  the  AUC∞  value.  All  subjects  have  a  value 
below the limit of quantification at the start of each period. Tmax was not observed in any subject for 
the first sample time of any period.  
Cmax  was  above  the  validated  range  in  9  concentration-time  curves.  However  the  dilution  step  was 
validated up to 500ng/ml, which was greater than the maximum Cmax value.  
Although  the  reference  compound  did  in  fact  exhibit  high  variability,  the  decision  to  widen  the 
confidence  intervals  is  not  relevant,  as  Cmax  was  in  fact  within  80  –  125%.  There  are  no  concerns 
regarding the extrapolation of the data, or any potential carryover effects.  
The  model  is  robust  to  both  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  of  data  where  the  concentration-time  curve 
may not have been properly characterised. It can be concluded that bioequivalence has been reliably 
demonstrated for the 150 mg strength tablet. 
Safety results 
Adverse event monitoring was carried out during all 4 admissions (day 0, 1 and 2 of each period), and 
up to 17 days following the collection of the last blood sample if spontaneously reported. Haematology 
screening was carried out before and after period 4, and biochemistry screening at the end of period 4.  
There  were  reports  of  131  adverse  events  by  46  out  of  70  subjects.    Eighty-seven  reports  followed 
administration  of  the  test  product  and  sixty  reports  followed  administration  of  the  reference  product. 
All adverse events resolved spontaneously. Two subjects were withdrawn due to adverse events (one 
for anaemia, one for injury and insomnia). There were no deaths or serious adverse events during the 
study.  
The  adverse  events  reported  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  the  active  substance 
ibandronic acid. No new safety concerns were raised.

Pharmacokinetic Conclusion 
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  Ibandronic  Acid  Teva  150  mg  film-coated  tablet  is 
considered bioequivalent with Bonviva 150 mg Film-coated tablet.  
The  results  of  study  with  150  mg  formulation  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  other  strength  50  mg, 
according to conditions in Note for Guidance on the Investigation of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98, section 5.4.

2.4.2.3. 
 Post marketing experience 
No  post-marketing  data  are  available  for  this  generic  medicinal  product;  it  has  not  been  marketed  in 
any country.   
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.5.1.  PSUR 
The proposed generic product Ibandronic Acid Teva 150 mg film-coated tablets should follow an annual 
PSUR submission scheme, in line with that of Bonviva.  
The proposed generic product Ibandronic Acid Teva 50 mg film-coated tablet should follow a 3-yearly 
PSUR submission scheme, in line with that of Bondronat.  
2.5.2.  Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative  requirements  and  provides  adequate  evidence  that  the  applicant  has  the  services  of  a 
qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of 
any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country. 
2.5.3.  Risk management plan 
The  applicant  has  submitted  a  justification  for  the  absence  of  a  risk  management  plan,  on  the  basis 
that  the  active  ingredient  has  been  in  use  for  many  years  and  has  a  well  established  safety  profile.  
This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

User consultation 
The user testing of the PIL for Ibandronic Acid Teva 150 mg film-coated tablet was conducted between 
October 26th, 2009 and November 6th, 2009. 
The  methodology  was  considered  acceptable.  Overall  90%  of  participants  were  able  to  find  the 
required information, of which 90% could understand and use the information. 
The PIL for Ibandronic Acid Teva 150 mg film-coated tablet (Parent PIL for Content) is considered to be 
the parent PIL for Ibandronic Acid Teva 50 mg film-coated tablet (Daughter PIL).  
TEVA has reviewed both the Parent and daughter PILs and decided that a bridging study would suffice 
as the content of both PILs is identical. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
2.5.4.  Benefit-risk balance  
The  application  contains  adequate  quality,  non  clinical  and  clinical  data  and  the  bioequivalence  has 
been shown. A benefit/Risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.  
2.5.5.  Recommendation 
2.5.5.1. 
 Normal opinion 
Based on the CHMP review of available data, the CHMP considered by consensus that the benefit/risk 
ratio  of  Ibandronic  Acid  Teva  in  the  indication  as  mentioned  below  was  favourable  and  therefore 
recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.  
Ibandronic Acid Teva 50mg is indicated for the prevention of skeletal events (pathological fractures, 
bone complications requiring radiotherapy or surgery) in patients with breast cancer and bone 
metastases. 
Ibandronic Acid Teva 150mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women 
at increased risk of fracture. A reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, 
efficacy on femoral neck fractures has not been established.

Summary of risk management plan for CEPROTIN (Human Protein C)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for CEPROTIN. The RMP details important risks 
of  CEPROTIN,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about
CEPROTIN’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
CEPROTIN’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how CEPROTIN should be used.
This summary of the RMP for CEPROTIN should be read in the context of all this information including 
the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of CEPROTIN’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
CEPROTIN is currently indicated in purpura fulminans (PF) and coumarin-induced skin necrosis (CISN) 
in patients with Severe Congenital Protein C Deficiency (SCPCD). Furthermore, CEPROTIN is indicated 
for short-term prophylaxis in patients with SCPCD if one or more of the following conditions are met (1) 
surgery  or  invasive  therapy  is  imminent,  (2)  while  initiating  coumarin  therapy,  (3)  when  coumarin 
therapy alone is not sufficient; and (4) when coumarin therapy is not feasible (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains human protein C as the active substance, and it is given by intravenous route. 
An  initial  dose  of  60  to  80  International  Unit/Kilogram  for  determination  of  recovery  and  half-life  is 
advised. The dose should be adjusted on the basis of laboratory assessment for each individual case.
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  CEPROTIN’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  CEPROTIN’s  EPAR, 
including in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  European  Medicine  Agency  (EMA)  website, 
under the medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ceprotin.
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks
Important risks of CEPROTIN, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about CEPROTIN’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected  continuously  and 
regularly analysed,  including  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (PSUR)  assessment  - include  PSUR 
statement only if product has PSUR requirements so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of CEPROTIN is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below.
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of CEPROTIN are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of CEPROTIN. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that 
is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse protein or 
heparin
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
SmPC, PSUR, medical literature.
Risk factors and risk groups
Patients with previous history of hypersensitivity to CEPROTIN or any 
other constituents of the product.
Risk minimisation
measures
CEPROTIN may contain trace amounts of heparin. Heparin induced 
allergic reactions, which can be associated with a rapid decrease of 
the number of thrombocytes, may be observed (Heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia).
Routine risk minimisation measures
As the risk of an allergic type hypersensitivity reaction cannot be 
excluded, patients should be informed of the early signs of 
hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, and 
tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis. If 
these symptoms occur, they should inform the physician. Immediate 
discontinuation of product use is advised.

Risk factors and risk groups
Patients taking anti-coagulation medication in addition to CEPROTIN 
may be at an increased risk for bleeding episodes.
Risk minimisation measures
Routine risk minimisation measures
In the context of clinical experience, several bleeding episodes have 
been observed. Concurrent anticoagulant medication (such as 
heparin) may have been responsible for these bleeding episodes. 
However, it cannot be completely ruled out that the administration 
of CEPROTIN further contributed to these bleeding events.

Transmission of infectious agents
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
SmPC, medical literature.
Risk factors and risk groups
Patients with increased exposure to human blood or plasma- derived 
products have an increased risk of viral transmission.
Risk minimisation measures
Routine risk minimisation measures
Standard measures to prevent infections resulting from the use of 
medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma include 
selection of donors, screening of individual donations and plasma 
pools for specific markers of infection, and the inclusion of effective 
manufacturing steps for the inactivation/removal of viruses. Despite 
this, when medicinal products prepared from human blood or 
plasma are administered, the possibility of transmitting infectious 
agents cannot be totally excluded. This also applies to unknown or 
emerging viruses and other pathogens.
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses 
such as Human immunodeficiency virus, Hepatitis B virus and 
Hepatitis C virus and for the non-enveloped virus Hepatitis A virus. 
The measures taken may be of limited value against nonenveloped 
viruses such as Parovirus B19. Parvovirus B19 infection may be 
serious for pregnant women (foetal infection) and for individuals 
with immunodeficiency or increased erythropoiesis (e.g. haemolytic 
anaemia).
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to mouse protein or 
heparin
Appropriate vaccination (hepatitis A and B) should be considered for 
patients in regular / repeated receipt of human plasma-derived 
Protein C products.
It is strongly recommended that every time that CEPROTIN is 
administered to a patient, the name and batch number of the 
product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient 
and the batch of the product.

Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
SmPC, medical literature.
Risk factors and risk groups
Patients administered heparin concurrently with CEPROTIN.
Risk minimisation measures
Routine risk minimisation measures
CEPROTIN may contain trace amounts of heparin. Heparin induced 
allergic reactions, which can be associated with a rapid decrease of 
the number of thrombocytes, may be observed (heparin induced 
thrombocytopenia [HIT]). In patients with HIT, symptoms such as
arterial and venous thrombosis, Disseminated intravascular
coagulation, purpura, petechial and gastrointestinal bleeding 
(Melena) may occur. If HIT is suspected, the number of 
thrombocytes should be determined immediately and if necessary, 
therapy with CEPROTIN should be stopped. Identifying HIT is 
Inhibitor development
complicated by the fact that these symptoms may already be 
present in acute phase patients with SCPCD. Patients with HIT 
should avoid the use of heparin containing drugs in the future.

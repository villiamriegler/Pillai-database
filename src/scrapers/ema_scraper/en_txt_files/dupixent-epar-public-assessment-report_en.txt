1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant sanofi-aventis groupe submitted on 4 November 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Dupixent, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. Dupixent can be used with or without topical therapy. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0219/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and the granting of a (product-
specific) waiver: 
A waiver was granted for the paediatric population from birth to less than 6 months on the grounds 
that the specific medicinal product is likely to be unsafe. 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0219/2016 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. A deferral for one or more measures was granted for the paediatric 
population from 6 months to 18 years of age for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on partial compliance for the PIP P/0219/2016. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance dupilumab contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic or chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
An estimated 2% to 10% of adults are affected by AD. Atopic dermatitis is commonly associated with 
asthma and other atopic/allergic conditions, with which it shares common pathophysiological 
pathways. 
2.1.3.   Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The pathophysiology of AD is influenced by genetics and environmental factors and involves a complex 
interplay between antigens, skin barrier defects, and immune dysregulations, in which a polarized 
inflammatory response induced by the marked activation of the T-helper type 2 (Th2) cell axis plays a 
central role. Two cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, are critical in the initiation and maintenance of the Th2 
inflammatory pathway. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
AD is characterized by pruritus, xerosis, and eczematous lesions. Especially pruritus and skin infections 
which are a major complication in AD compromise health and lower the quality of life and can result in 
sleep disturbance, pain and psychiatric comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, and suicidal 
ideation.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Limited treatment options are available. Local therapies often relieve typical symptoms for the duration 
of their application. Atopic dermatitis is treated primarily with topical corticosteroids (TCS). However, 
continuous long-term application of TCS, particularly those with higher potency, is not recommended, 
because of side effects such as skin atrophy, HPA axis suppression and others. The majority of patients 
with mild AD respond well to topical therapy. However, patients with moderate-to-severe AD often do 
not achieve adequate control with acceptable doses of topical medications and frequently require 
systemic therapy. Systemic therapy is indicated in patients who do not respond adequately to topical 
therapies or for whom topical therapy is inadvisable. Currently available systemic therapies include 
nonselective immunosuppressants such as systemic corticosteroids or Ciclosporin A, which are 
associated with severe toxicity and side effects.

About the product 
Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody with binding specificity to human 
interleukin-4 receptor IL-4Rα. 
IL-4Rα forms an integral part of two distinct receptors, Type I and Type II receptors, through which IL-
4 and IL-13 mediate their effects on type 2 immune responses which involves the cooperation of the 
innate and adaptive immune systems. Evidence suggests a role for type 2 inflammation in patients 
with atopic dermatitis, including increased circulating IgE, increased eosinophils, basophils, Innate 
Lymphoid Cells 2 (ILC2s) and mast cells, and marked increases in several type 2 cytokines and 
chemokines, such as TSLP, TARC, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Dupixent finished product is presented as a two (2) milliliter solution for injection containing 150 
mg/mL of dupilumab (INN) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: sucrose, L-arginine hydrochloride, L-histidine, polysorbate 80, sodium acetate 
and water for injections. 
The product is available in a 2 mL single-use pre-filled syringe (PFS) without or with safety system 
(PFS-S) with a fixed 27 gauge ½ inch, thin wall stainless steel staked needle as described in section 
6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Dupilumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the IL-4R alpha 
sub-unit of the IL-4 and IL-13 receptor complex and, is a new active substance. Dupilumab has a 
predicted protein molecular weight of 146,897.0 Da and contains a single, conserved N-glycosylation 
site (Asn302) in the Fc region of each heavy chain subunit. Dupilumab heavy chains contain a serine to 
proline mutation at amino acid 233, which is located in the hinge region of the Fc domain  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Dupilumab active substance (AS) manufacturing is performed at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
Columbia Turnpike, Rensselaer, USA.   
Regeneron currently maintains suites for the manufacture of AS.These suites utilise equivalent or 
identical equipment. Commercial supply is planned to be manufactured in these suites. Other sites for 
specified testing are described in the application. 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 10/100 
 
  
 
 
   
The manufacture of dupilumab AS represents a standard manufacturing process for the manufacture of 
monoclonal antibodies. It is achieved in three main parts, the upstream process, which produces the 
antibody, the downstream process, which purifies the antibody and the formulation of the active 
substance (formulated active substance- FAS).  
Dupilumab is produced by a cell culture process with recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 
that have been engineered to constitutively express dupilumab heavy and light chains. Dupilumab 
protein is expressed by the cells and is secreted into the culture medium.  
The recombinant protein product is harvested and purified leveraging standard chromatographic and 
membrane based techniques and includes several steps ensuring adventitious agent safety.   
At the conclusion of purification, the AS is sterile-filtered and dispensed for long-term storage until 
needed for formulation.  
Dupilumab FAS is produced at a final concentration of 150 mg/mL. The AS batches are thawed, pooled 
and mixed. This is followed by mixing with dilution buffer and excipient buffer, filtration and further 
mixing. The dupilumab FAS is then dispensed  into bottles with  caps and transferred to storage until 
shipment to the finished product (FP) filling site.   
The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine in-process controls along with acceptance 
criteria, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, where relevant, are described for each 
step for AS and FAS. A cumulative assessment of risk and importance was performed.   
The applicant has provided a description of the composition and preparation of all buffers and solutions 
listed in this section as well as chromatography/filter conditions. The AS and FAS manufacturing 
processes are considered acceptable.  
Control of materials 
The antibody is produced in CHO cells. The anti-IL4Rα antibody, dupilumab, was generated by 
immunization of Regeneron's VelocImmune® mice followed by screening for antibodies specific to 
human IL4Rα. One antibody was chosen and DNA encoding the antibody variable domains was cloned 
to yield the fully human antibody dupilumab. The cDNA encoding the dupilumab heavy chain and light 
chain genes was then cloned into expression plasmids and  transfected into a CHO host cell line. After 
transfection and stable integration of the dupilumab expression plasmids  into the host cell genome, 
enabling the constitutive expression of dupilumab, the dupilumab expression cell line was isolated 
using Regeneron’s proprietary cell expression technologies. 
The dupilumab MCB will be used to generate new WCBs for routine production of dupilumab AS. An 
appropriate number of vials were manufactured, cryopreserved and stored at three separate facilities. 
Three dupilumab WCBs have been prepared from the MCB. The WCB first used in manufacturing AS 
and used for the manufacturing of dupilumab AS for Phase 3 clinical trials will continue to be used for 
routine commercial manufacturing, as available. New WCBs were prepared and a protocol for 
generation & qualification of new WCBs has been provided. Adventitious agent testing of the MCB and 
WCB was conducted, as per ICH Q5A requirements. The genetic stability of dupilumab production cell 
line was investigated through the MCB and WCB cell banking process. No evidence of viral or microbial 
contamination was observed.  
Incoming raw materials (chemical materials, chromatography resins and filters) are adequately 
controlled (acceptable specifications have been provided for all raw materials). Compendial raw 
materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, while specifications for non-
compendial raw materials are presented. A leachable/extractable risk assessment was performed for 
all materials used in dupilumab AS and FAS manufacturing processes. The dupilumab manufacturing 
Assessment report

process does not use raw materials of direct animal origin, other than CHO cells. TSE/BSE certificates 
were provided, as applicable. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
All AS and FAS manufacturing processes steps include controls within the IPC program for assurance of 
operational and performance consistency, as well as adherence to product safety requirements for 
each step.  
When evaluating parameters and attributes for inclusion in the IPC program, a process failure modes 
and effects analysis (PFMEA) approach was applied. Potential failure modes were rated on a 1 to 10 
scale for severity, likelihood and detectability, with higher scores representing higher relative risk. The 
product of the severity, likelihood, and detectability scores was calculated, generating a risk priority 
number (RPN). Failure modes were sorted from highest (greatest risk) to lowest (lowest risk) RPN.  
Once a parameter or attribute was chosen for inclusion in the IPC program, it was formally classified as 
either a critical quality attribute (CQA), a critical process parameter (CPP) a general quality attribute 
(GQA) or a general process parameter (GPP).  
All quality attributes monitored at AS and FAS release are considered CQAs. GPPs and GQAs were 
assigned action limits and CPPs and CQAs were assigned acceptance criteria. Actions taken if limits are 
exceeded are specified. 
Process validation 
All key components of the commercial Dupilumab AS and FAS manufacturing processes were 
prospectively evaluated and validated through laboratory and full scale studies. 
Two Dupilumab AS manufacturing processes have been validated, the commercial processes and an 
earlier process for some of the clinical studies. The two processes differ only in certain downstream 
purification steps  
In general, acceptance criteria for all critical parameters and attributes were met for cell culture, 
unprocessed bulk material, harvest and purification process steps and released batches.  
The applicant has also performed validation of the FAS manufacturing process. A variety of values for 
operational parameters have been used in order to establish their acceptable range. Release data for 
PPQ FAS lots have been provided. All batches met acceptance criteria in place at the time of testing. 
The dupilumab process-related impurity clearance studies provide evidence of the robust, reproducible 
process-related impurity clearance capability of the downstream purification process. All AS lots 
produced during investigation of PPQs met the release specifications at the time for all product-related 
impurities. In conclusion, the AS and FAS manufacturing process has been validated adequately.  
Characterisation 
Dupilumab AS lots were characterised, including determination of primary, secondary, and tertiary 
structure, charge variants, purity, and potency.  
For product-related impurities, the applicant has provided adequate description of their 
characterisation, their effect on the potency of the product and their control strategy, during 
manufacture, at release and over the intended shelf life of the product.   
Process-related impurities were adequately described and clearance capabilities of the manufacturing 
process shown. Sound rationale has been provided for not testing some process-related impurities. 
These are based on in-process testing data, assessment of worst case scenario and recommended 
acceptable daily exposure levels. The process-related impurities that are not routinely tested for are 
Assessment report

common to both the commercial and clinical processes and therefore have been present in clinical trial 
material.  
Specification 
The specifications for Dupilumab AS and FAS are provided and cover control of identity, purity and 
impurities, potency and other general tests. 
The process used for setting and justification of specifications and specification ranges and limits has 
been adequately described. In brief, clinically-qualified values were used where possible. The applicant 
also leveraged historical data from AS and FAS  lots by establishing  tolerance interval limits. Stability 
data was used to support end-of-shelf specifications.  
Parameters and acceptance criteria of FAS specifications are acceptable.   
Analytical methods 
The analytical procedures have been provided for testing the AS and formulated AS at release and 
during stability and are sufficiently described in the dossier and validated.  
The potency assay is performed as an AS, FAS and bulk PFS release test. 
Batch analysis 
Dupilumab FAS includes several formulations examined in clinical trials, as well as the commercial FAS 
composition.   
Results of batch release testing demonstrated that the commercial manufacturing process is capable of 
producing AS and FAS of consistent and comparable quality at the time of batch release. The applicant 
has additionally demonstrated the comparability of dupilumab AS manufactured by earlier iterations of 
the manufacturing process supplying clinical trials.  
Reference materials 
Dupilumab primary and working reference standards are qualified using AS and FAS release testing as 
well as additional characterisation. A current in-house primary reference standard has been 
appropriately characterised and is prepared from a lot representative of production and clinical 
materials. In-house working reference standards used in the testing of production lots are calibrated 
against this primary reference material. Future RS material will be qualified and characterised as above 
according to a defined process. Also, distinct reference materials for process-related impurities have 
been established and described sufficiently. 
Stability 
The  stability results indicate that the AS and FAS are sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf 
lives in the proposed containers. 
Dupilumab AS and FAS stability studies have been carried out according to ICH recommended long 
term and accelerated storage conditions. Test articles are packaged in small scale packaging that 
acceptably simulates that used for long term storage of dupilumab AS. The representative real-time 
stability is based on AS batches and  FAS batches produced with the commercial process. Supportive 
long-term stability studies were also provided.  
The applicant committed to complete the stability studies of the primary and supporting dupilumab AS 
and FAS batches at the long-term storage condition according to the stability protocols provided. In

accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
The forced degradation study confirmed that the current control strategy used for release and stability 
testing of dupilumab is appropriate and that the methods are capable of detecting the most prominent 
degradation pathways. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
Four production processes have been used to produce dupilumab for clinical studies.   
The applicant has adequately outlined the development of the commercial process from earlier 
processes and has demonstrated comparability with material from these earlier batches used in clinical 
trials.   
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The FP is supplied as a single-use prefilled syringe (PFS) or prefilled syringe assembled with a safety 
system (PFS-S), containing 2.0 mL of 150 mg/mL dupilumab for subcutaneous injection.    
The content of 2 mL of the PFS or PFS-S is intended to be injected, providing a 300 mg dose of 
dupilumab. The PFS presentation is comprised of a primary container, referred to as a “bulk prefilled 
syringe”, a transparent plunger rod and a white finger flange to facilitate handling. The bulk PFS is a 
siliconized, 2.25 mL, clear glass syringe barrel, equipped with a stainless steel 27 gauge needle, an 
elastomeric plunger stopper and a needle shield. The PFS-S presentation includes a safety system for 
sharps injury prevention, consisting of a needle guard with a  spring for activation. All excipients used 
in the manufacture of dupilumab FAS/FP are known pharmaceutical ingredients and are compendial 
grade (Ph.Eur.).  
The product has undergone a development process to optimise the formulation and the studies which 
underpin the choice of formulation are well described in the dossier. Several FP dosage forms were 
used to supply dupilumab clinical studies.  
In addition to the change in presentation, the formulation was adapted over time. Formulation 
development is adequately described.  
Extractable and leachable studies have been carried out on material with comes into contact with the 
finished product during manufacture and storage. Data has been presented to show that the FP is 
compatible with the chosen container closure system. The container closure system has been shown to 
comply with the essential requirements of Annex 1 of the Medical Devices Directive and conforms with 
the relevant ISO requirements.  
As part of the microbial attributes, sterility and endotoxin testing is monitored during batch release 
testing. The results of the container closure integrity tests demonstrate that the container closure 
system maintains the sterility of the product and that manufacturing operations and shipping do not 
impact the container closure integrity.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Dupilumab FAS is supplied frozen and stored until manufacturing of the dupilumab FP.  
The manufacturing process is relatively straightforward and involves thawing of formulated AS, pooling 
and mixing. The FP is then filtered, filled into syringes and fitted with a stopper. At this stage the FP is 
referred to as bulk pre-filled syringe (PFS). The final PFS is assembled by inserting a plunger rod and 
finger flange. The PFS-S presentation also has a safety device attached to the finger flange. The 
manufacturing process is well described.   
The manufacturing processes and process controls described can be considered suitable for 
manufacturing of bulk PFS, PFS and PFS-S. 
Validation of the FP manufacturing processes was performed. Overall, the processes can generally be 
considered adequate to reproducibly produce FP within the defined process parameters. The in-process 
controls are adequate. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The FP specifications contain a complete list of release tests and acceptance criteria covering product 
solution properties, identity, strength, purity, potency and syringe with safety system performance 
properties. The chosen release tests are sufficient to ensure the quality of the FP and are generally in 
line with ICH Q6B and the Ph. Eur. monograph on monoclonal antibodies for human use. After revision 
of some acceptance criteria the proposed acceptance criteria are considered sufficiently justified.   
The end-of-shelf-life specification for the dupilumab FP in PFS/PFS-S contains a complete list of 
stability tests and acceptance criteria covering product, strength, purity, potency and syringe 
performance properties. Testing at end of shelf life is performed on the finished PFS and PFS-S, 
respectively.  
Specifications for bulk PFS were set and provided.  
Appropriate specifications are in place for the FP to control product-related impurities. Stated 
impurities have been present in clinical trial material.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods are fully validated. Non-compendial methods have been validated in line with 
ICH guidance. 
Batch analysis 
Representative-scale batch data has been provided for batches of bulk PFS and PFS from each 
manufacturing site. Furthermore, batches of PFS-S and clinical batches were provided. 
All PFS and PFS-S batches complied with the release specifications. 
Moreover, acceptance ranges of FP specifications are considered adequately set with regard to the 
batch analyses results from historic and commercial batches and the justifications on specifications.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard is the same as that used for AS.

Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life is 15 months at 2 – 8° C. Based on available stability data, this shelf-life and 
storage conditions as stated in the SmPC, are acceptable. 
Based on the data provided, the proposed shelf life of 15 months at 2 – 8° C for the FP is acceptable.  
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA and the applicant has committed to 
reporting any confirmed out of trends or failures to conform to stability acceptance criteria at the long-
term storage condition of 5 °C within the proposed shelf life, and to evaluate the implications of these 
data to ensure continued purity, potency, and quality. An out-of-trend stability result is defined as a 
result or sequence of results that are within the acceptance criterion but are unexpected or atypical, 
given the known analytical variance and the measured attribute’s normal change over time. 
Data have been presented to show that if necessary, pre-filled syringes may be kept at room 
temperature up to 25°C for a maximum of 14 days. After removal from the refrigerator, Dupixent must 
be used within 14 days or discarded. 
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product 
Comparability has been demonstrated between both finished commercial product manufacturing sites 
which were also used to supply the Phase 3 studies. Comparability data included a statistical 
comparison of release and stability data which identified no meaningful differences in batches 
manufactured at both sites. Therefore batches produced at both sites can be considered comparable. 
No formal comparability was presented for earlier lyophilized batches, however as these were used 
only in Phase I studies, comparability data is not considered necessary.  
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance has been demonstrated and there is sufficient information provided on the animal 
derived material used.  Relevant certificates of analysis have been provided for animal derived 
material.  
In general, the viral safety of Dupixent is well addressed. Several steps are taken in order to ensure 
adventitious agents safety. The cell banking system has been extensively screened for adventitious 
viruses using a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. The tests failed to demonstrate the presence of 
any virus contaminants in the cell banks with the exception of intracellular A type and extracellular C 
type retrovirus-like particles which are well known to be present in rodent cells; moreover, the 
dupilumab manufacturing process demonstrates excess capacity to inactivate/remove such virus like 
particles.  
Dedicated virus safety steps were shown to be effective in removing/inactivating potential viral 
contaminants. In conclusion, viral and TSE safety has been satisfactorily addressed.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Dupilumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody with binding specificity to Human IL-4Rα 
thereby inhibiting both IL-4 and IL-13 signalling. The commercial manufacturing process used to 
produce dupilumab has been adequately described and validated 
The development of dupilumab expressing MCB and WCBs has been described in adequate detail.  
The dupilumab AS commercial manufacturing  process has been validated.  
The applicant has described how quality attributes and process parameters are designated as critical or 
general IPCs and what the minimum response is with respect to excursions outside of action limit / 
acceptance criteria/critical action limit. 
The chosen release tests are sufficient to ensure the quality of the AS and FAS and are generally in line 
with ICH Q6B and the Ph. Eur. Monograph on monoclonal antibodies for human use. After revision, the 
proposed acceptance criteria are considered sufficiently justified.  
The applicant proposes an acceptable shelf life for AS and FAS respectively based on stability data from 
batches manufactured using the commercial process.   
The finished product manufacturing process is described. An EU GMP certificate has been provided for 
the finished product manufacturing site.  
It can be concluded that FP specifications comply with Ph. Eur. 2031 Monoclonal antibodies for human 
use and Ph.Eur. 0520 Parenteral preparations. Characterisation of impurities was adequately described 
in the dossier and does not give rise to specific concerns.  
Batch data from a significant number of lots has been provided which provides assurance that the 
manufacturing process at both sites is capable of manufacturing a consistent product.  
Based on the data provided, the proposed shelf life of 15 months at 2 – 8° C for the FP is acceptable.  
The TSE/virus safety of dupilumab is sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAA for dupilumab was supported by a comprehensive battery of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics 
and toxicology tests.  
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 17/100 
 
  
 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacology in vitro 
The initial experiments demonstrated that dupilumab had a high affinity for human IL-4Rα, with a KD 
of 12 pM to the dimeric form of the receptor. However, subsequent surface plasma resonance 
experiments using the Biacore system suggested a much diminished ability to bind IL-4Rα of mouse or 
monkey origin. Therefore, surrogate antibodies were generated, REGN1103 and REGN646, which bind 
to IL-4Rα of mouse and monkey origin respectively. These surrogate antibodies were shown to have 
affinities in a similar range as that of dupilumab in humans. 
Further in vitro characterisation of dupilumab and the surrogate antibodies was performed. Dupilumab 
was shown to bind to CD20 positive lymphocytes which was blocked by pre-incubation with excess IL-
4. Increased cell surface expression of CD23 was also inhibited by dupilumab in human PBMCs and in 
the Ramos lymphoma cell line. Inhibition of secretion of TARC, a type 2 chemokine whose secretion is 
mediated by IL-4 or IL-13, was also inhibited by dupilumab in PBMCs isolated from donors. 
Given that dupilumab is a human IgG4 molecule, Fc-effector function is not expected. In accordance, 
using cell lines expressing IL-4Rα, no ADCC or CDC activity of dupilumab against target cells could be 
detected.  
Functional characterisation studies with the surrogate antibodies were also performed. REGN1103, the 
mouse surrogate antibody, inhibited IL-4- and IL-13-dependent proliferation of cell lines at IC50’s of 
1.9 nM and 11 pM respectively. Similar experiments to those performed with dupilumab were also 
performed for REGN646, the monkey surrogate antibody. REGN646 inhibited IL-4 and IL-13-mediated 
signalling as measured by STAT6 mediated luciferase expression or TARC secretion. Flow cytometry 
analysis showed a comparable staining pattern of human and monkey lymphocytes by dupilumab and 
REGN646, respectively.  
Primary pharmacology in vivo 
Due to the lack of an in vivo model of atopic dermatitis the proof of principle experiments have been 
performed using classical models of type 2 immune response which have been shown to be mediated 
at least in part through signalling via IL-4 and IL-13. To this end, a genetically engineered transgenic 
mouse was established which expresses human IL-4 and IL-4Rα and was validated as a system in 
human to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in vivo. Using this transgenic mouse, efficacy of 
dupilumab was demonstrated in a model of IL-25 induced Type-2-driven inflammation. Maximum 
pharmacodynamic response was evident at 25 mg/kg of dupilumab as shown by examining goblet cell 
metaplasia, total serum IgE levels as well as lung histopathology score. In a model of house dust mite 
(HDM) allergen lung inflammation efficacy was seen with sub-cutaneous administration of 25 mg/kg of 
dupilumab twice weekly for a period of 4 weeks. Dupilumab treatment reduced the total levels of IgE in 
HDM treated mice to that of control untreated animals, as well as inhibiting the activation of 
eosinophils and goblet cell metaplasia.  
Additional in vivo studies in wild-type mice were conducted with REGN1103, a surrogate monoclonal 
antibody specific for murine IL-4Rα. Efficacy of REGN1103 in mice was studied in HDM-induced lung 
inflammation. When given in parallel to allergen exposition over four weeks, REGN1103 achieved the 
expected pharmacologic effect.  Treatment was associated with reduced pulmonary eosinophil

infiltration, reduced in goblet cell metaplasia and less total IgE and HDM-specific IgG1 in serum. The 
study provides a proof-of-concept for the inhibition of IL-4Rα in hyperactive type 2 immune responses. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed because no test article-related adverse 
primary pharmacodynamics or changes to safety pharmacology parameters were observed in 
nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies, indicating absence of off-target effect. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In line with ICH S6(R1) safety pharmacology endpoints were evaluated as part of the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys. No dupilumab-related effects were observed on 
cardiovascular, respiratory or CNS function.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab were evaluated in single-dose PK studies in rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys after IV and SC administration to provide PK information in the absence of target-mediated 
clearance. PK/TK of REGN646 were evaluated after single and repeated IV or SC administration in 
cynomolgus monkeys; TK of REGN1103 was evaluated after SC administration in mice. The SC route is 
the proposed clinical route of administration.  
PK characteristics of dupilumab after single IV and SC administration in rats and cynomolgus were 
typical for a monoclonal antibody and consistent with a lack of target binding. In both species, the 
concentration-time profile of dupilumab was characterized by an initial distribution or absorption phase 
following IV or SC administration, respectively, followed by a single elimination phase. The mean half-
life of dupilumab ranged from 4.8 – 7 days in rats and 11.7 to 20.5 days in cynomolgus and was 
comparable following IV or SC administration. The bioavailability following SC dosing was high (84.2 % 
in rats, > 92% in cynomolgus).  
PK of REGN646 in cynomolgus was characterized by non-linear kinetics, which is consistent with 
target-mediated disposition. After single IV administration (ranging from 1 – 15 mg/kg), Cmax 
increased approximately dose-proportionally while AUCinf increased in a greater than dose-
proportional manner. Elimination of REGN646 was biphasic, with a long β elimination phase and a 
more rapid terminal target elimination phase. Consistently, the mean beta elimination half-life of 
REGN646 at serum concentrations above the target-saturation ranged from 7.2 to 9.1 days while the 
mean terminal elimination half-life was 1.5 – 2.1 at concentrations where target-mediated elimination 
is the primary clearance process. The absolute bioavailability of REGN646 following SC administration 
was approx. 70.0%. After repeated once weekly doses of 25 and 100 mg/kg/week, accumulation of 
REGN646 was observed, ranging from 2.2 to 4.6-fold.  
REGN1103 showed non-linear kinetics in mice; increases in exposure were greater than dose-
proportional at lower doses and approximately dose-proportional at doses ≥ 25 mg/kg/week.  
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), studies on distribution, metabolism and excretion were not 
conducted.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Dupilumab is specific for human IL-4Rα and does not adequately interact with IL-4Rα from non-clinical 
species. Therefore the toxicity of IL-4Rα blockade was evaluated using surrogate antibodies specific for 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 19/100 
 
  
 
cynomolgus or mouse IL-4Rα. The pharmacologic activity of these surrogate antibodies was adequately 
characterized and is considered comparable to that of dupilumab.  
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose studies of up to 26 weeks duration were conducted with REGN646 in cynomolgus 
monkeys. In these studies, once weekly IV or SC treatment with REGN646 at doses up to 100 mg/kg 
was well tolerated. No REGN646-related adverse effects were noted. Lymphocytic infiltrates were 
observed at the SC injection sites. These are considered a reaction to injection of high concentration of 
human protein. 
Of note, no immunological effects of REGN646 were observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. There 
were no test-article-related changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations. In addition, there 
were no treatment-related changes in serum IgM, IgG and IgE, with the exception of the 13-week 
study. In this study, lower IgE serum levels were observed in individual monkeys who had received 
saturating doses of REGN646. However, this finding is considered a pharmacologic effect of IL-4Rα 
blockade. Furthermore, REGN646 treatment did not affect the development of an antibody response to 
immunization with KLH. The primary and secondary IgM and IgG response against KLH in REGN646-
treated cynomolgus was comparable to that of control animals.  
In summary, no adverse effects were observed in the repeat-dose studies. In all studies, the NOAEL 
was the highest dose administered and was associated with a Ctrough of 4150 µg/ml and an AUC0-
168h of 791,000 µg*h/ml at 100 mg/kg SC in the chronic toxicity study.  
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted, in accordance with ICH S6(R1).  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted. However, an assessment of the carcinogenic potential of 
dupilumab was made based on literature data on the role of the IL-4/IL-13 pathway in tumour 
development and on non-clinical data for both REGN646 and REGN1103. 
The majority of literature data indicate that IL-4 and IL-13 mediate pro-tumorigenic effects either by 
directly promoting tumour cell proliferation or indirectly via the activation of immunomodulatory cells. 
Such effects would be inhibited by anti-IL-4Rα treatment. In addition, results from the repeated-dose 
toxicity studies in mice and cynomolgus do not indicate a carcinogenic risk. The applied weight of 
evidence approach is in accordance with ICH S6(R1). It can be agreed that chronic treatment with 
dupilumab is not associated with an increased risk of cancer. In contrast, blockade of IL-4Rα signalling 
may contribute to inhibition of tumour growth.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The effect of IL-4Rα inhibition on fertility and early embryonic development was evaluated in mice 
treated with the surrogate mAb. Subcutaneous administration of REGN1103 to adult male and female 
mice at 25, 75, or 200 mg/kg/week did not result in any compound-related mortality. There were no 
REGN1103-related clinical signs, effects on body weight or food consumption, macroscopic 
observations or microscopic findings. In addition, there were no compound-related effects on mating, 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 20/100 
 
  
 
 
fertility, estrous cycling, embryo survival or any of the male reproductive assessments (organ 
weights). Therefore, dupilumab is not expected to have an effect on fertility. 
In the cynomolgus enhanced pre-/post-natal development study, there were no REGN646-related 
maternal effects. The incidence of embryo-fetal loss was higher in REGN646-treated groups (32.4% 
combined 25 and 100 mg/kg groups) than in the control group (25%) but was within the range of 
historical control data reported at the test facility (6.7 – 38.9%). In the surviving offspring, there were 
no REGN646-related findings.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Dupilumab is a water soluble monoclonal antibody which undergoes extensive in vivo metabolism. The 
human excretion products of dupilumab are predicted to be rapidly and readily degraded in sewage 
collection and treatment systems and in the environment. Therefore, dupilumab is unlikely to result in 
a significant risk to the environment 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The provided pharmacology studies have demonstrated that dupilumab has a high affinity for the 
human IL-4Rα receptor and a much lower affinity for IL-4Rα of mouse and monkey origin necessitating 
the generation of surrogate antibodies. The surrogate antibodies, REGN1103 and REGN646 
demonstrated affinities to mouse and monkey IL-4Rα respectively in a comparable, albeit lower, range 
to that of dupilumab to hIL-4Rα. The staining pattern of human and monkey lymphocytes by 
dupilumab and REGN646, respectively was comparable. In vitro functionality of these antibodies was 
demonstrated in cells of the respective species with inhibition of IL-4 or IL-13 dependent signalling. 
Although no preclinical models of atopic dermatitis were available a transgenic mouse expressing hIL-4 
and hIL-4Rα was generated and used for proof of efficacy studies with dupilumab in models of type 2 
immune responses. Similar in vivo experiments were performed demonstrating efficacy with the mouse 
surrogate REGN1103 antibody. Taken together the studies provide a comprehensive basis for the 
potential mechanism of action of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis as well as establishing the 
appropriateness of the surrogate antibodies for the toxicity studies.  
In rats and monkeys dupilumab exhibited linear kinetics as expected in species that do not bind 
dupilumab with high affinity. No target-mediated clearance was observed and total dupilumab 
exposure was approximately dose proportional. In monkeys REGN646, the monkey surrogate anti-IL-
4Rα antibody, displayed non-linear kinetics. The concentration-time profiles of REGN646 are 
characterized by an initial distribution phase following IV administration, or an absorption phase 
following SC administration, followed by a target-saturating beta elimination phase and a terminal 
target-mediated elimination phase. The target-mediated elimination is most notable at the lower 
concentrations. Low volumes of distribution are seen along with long elimination half-life, which are 
typical pharmacokinetic characteristics of monoclonal Abs. The presence of ADA in animals in the 
REGN646 monkey study clearly impacted the rate of drug clearance observed in the study especially at 
lower concentrations, and there was no evidence of toxicity associated with the occurrence of ADA. 
Since dupilumab and the surrogate antibodies, REGN1103 and REGN646, are large proteins that are 
above the glomerular filtration cut-off threshold, they are primarily eliminated by proteolytic 
catabolism that results in smaller peptides and amino acids that can be reused for new protein 
synthesis. The clearance of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies typically does not involve cytochrome 
P450 (CYP450)-mediated metabolism or interaction with cell membrane transporters, therefore 
pharmacokinetic interactions with small molecule drugs are limited. However, published literature 
suggests IL-4 plays a role in the regulation of CYP. The clinical significance of this is unclear.  In a 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 21/100 
 
  
 
clinical drug-drug interaction study (R668-Ad-1433) in AD patients, the effects of dupilumab on the PK 
of CYP substrates were evaluated. The data generated from this study did not indicate clinically 
relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity. 
To support the safety of dupilumab, a toxicology programme was conducted in accordance with current 
guidance and considered adequate. Given the lack of cross-reactivity of dupilumab with IL-4Rα from 
non-clinical species, surrogate mAbs were used, which is acceptable. The repeated-dose toxicity 
studies IL-4Rα blockade did not reveal any adverse effects. Given that the toxicity studies were 
conducted with a surrogate antibody a direct comparison of exposure multiples in the toxicity studies 
with exposure of dupilumab in humans is not considered meaningful. However, the Ctrough at the end 
of treatment in the chronic toxicity study corresponds to 52x of IC90 determined for REGN646-
mediated inhibition of IL-4-stimulated TARC section in vitro. This indicates that a sufficiently high 
exposure to REGN646 was maintained throughout the study.  
The effect of IL-4Rα blockade on reproductive and developmental toxicity was evaluated in a fertility 
study in mice which and in an ePPND study in cynomolgus monkeys. No adverse effects were noted. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies are sufficient to support the marketing authorisation of dupilumab.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of dupilumab in healthy subjects has been evaluated in three Phase I studies (R668-AS-0907, 
R668-HV-1108 and TDU12265) and three formulation comparison studies (Study PKM12350, 
PKM14161, PKM14271). Population PK analysis has also been conducted.  
Absorption  
Dupilumab is generally well absorbed following SC administration with an absolute bioavailability of 
64% based on population PK analysis. After a single SC administration of 75 mg to 600 mg dupilumab, 
the median tmax was 3 to 7 days in healthy subjects. 
Steady-state is generally achieved by week 16 for both the 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW dosing. 
Comparison of the mean concentration-time profiles for both R668-AD-1224 where dosing with 300 mg 
Q2W and 300 mg QW was maintained for 52 weeks, and R668-AD-1225 where mean data from the 
300 mg QW regimen up to 68 weeks are available, suggests that the steady-state trough 
concentrations achieved by week 16 are in the range of those measured in other studies and are 
maintained for up to 1 year. A very slight increase in mean Ctrough values (R668-AD-1225) could be 
detected. 
After 51 weeks of dosing in study R668-AD-1224, mean Ctrough was 78.6 mg/L and 188 mg/L for the 
300 Q2W and 300 mg QW regimens, respectively. Generally, Ctrough values showed a high variability 
with a standard deviation from the mean of about 40 (Q2W) and over 70 (QW). The 600 mg loading 
dose enabled a more rapid increase in exposure allowing approximately 75% of the steady-state 
concentration to be reached by week 4.  
Mean trough concentration of functional dupilumab in serum were consistent across studies conducted 
using similar dosing regimens in patients with moderate-severe AD.

In conclusion, the PK of dupilumab is characterized as nonlinear with target-mediated clearance. 
Following different dosing regimens of both IV and SC administration, the concentration-time profile of 
functional dupilumab was characterized by an initial distribution phase (IV) or absorption phase (SC, F 
= 0.642) followed by a bi-phasic elimination. Bioavailability F was estimated based on population PK 
analysis.  
Distribution 
In study TDU12265, following a single SC dose of 75 mg to 600 mg of dupilumab, the estimated 
apparent steady-state volume of distribution ranged from 6.6 L to 10.7 L. Based on POP PK analysis, 
the central volume of distribution (V2) was 2.74 L and peripheral volume of distribution (V3) was 1.86 
L, resulting in a total volume of distribution of 4.6 L. This small volume of distribution is in line with 
what is expected from a monoclonal antibody. 
Elimination 
As a monoclonal antibody, the metabolism of dupilumab is expected to be limited to proteolytic 
catabolism to small peptides and individual amino acids; eliminated by kidneys is not expected. Hence 
no metabolism or excretion studies were conducted. Clearance via the linear, concentration-
independent elimination pathway was estimated by population PK modelling (central volume *ke). For 
the typical patients this resulted in a linear clearance estimate of 2.74 L * 0.0477 1/d = 0.131 L/d.  
Total clearance estimates increase as concentration decreases. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Following single administration of dupilumab, a greater-than dose proportional increase in systemic 
exposure was observed. In healthy volunteers, for a 12-fold increase in IV dose from 1 mg/kg to 12 
mg/kg, a 38-fold increase in AUClast was observed. For an 8-fold increase in SC single dose from 75 
mg to 600 mg, a 30-fold increase in AUClast was observed in healthy male Japanese subjects. These 
observations are consistent with nonlinear PK due to target-mediated clearance. Following IV and SC 
administration Cmax increased in a slightly greater than dose proportional manner. Intravenous doses 
of 1, 3, 8, and 12 mg/kg resulted in Cmax/Dose values of 25.8, 31.3, 33.7, and 35.2 1/L, respectively. 
Special populations 
Population PK Analysis 
Samples collected from all Phase 1-3 studies except R688-AD-1225 have been included in the 
establishment of a two compartment model. Placebo subjects were excluded from all datasets. In total, 
a comprehensive data base of 18243 samples has been collected from 2041 subjects for model 
selection and validation (sensitivity analyses) and covariate analyses.  The base model for population-
based analyses was a 2-compartment model with 3 serial transit compartments characterizing the 
absorption process, bioavailability (F1) from the depot following SC administration to the central 
compartment that was described by a central volume of distribution (V2). The inter-compartmental 
rates (k23 and k32) were used to characterize the inter-compartmental distribution. The linear 
elimination pathway was described using a Michaelis-Menten (M-M) model to represent target-
mediated drug disposition, parameterized by the maximal rate of clearance (Vm) and the Michaelis 
constant (Km). A first order rate constant was used to describe the SC absorption of dupilumab.  A 
transit compartmental model was used to describe the lag time in absorption of dupilumab.

As only sparse samples have been collected from AD patients, the model selection was conducted in a 
step-wise process aiming at optimal parameter estimation and selection of the best model structure.  
Except V2 and Ke, the parameters were fixed to the values estimated from the phase 1 and phase 2 
data. Model evaluation showed no major artefacts or time effects. VPC plots indicate that the high 
variability among Ctrough values is moderately but acceptably well covered. Shrinkage estimates 
(Model 1) for V2, ke, Vm, Ka, and MTT were 10.4%, 25.2%, 22.9%, 23.2%, and 54.9% respectively. 
As the value for MMT is very high, this underlines the request to reconsider the introduction of lag-time 
(transit compartments) in the model structure. For Model 4, Shrinkage of ke and the central volume V2 
was estimated to 41% and 35%. Given that these values are estimated based on mainly sparse trough 
concentration values, and no major artefacts in the parameter distribution could be detected, this is 
acceptable. Sensitivity analyses where all data sets and BLQ values have been integrated resulted in 
even higher shrinkage values and generally confirmed the model robustness in terms of parameter 
estimation and covariate finding.  
Covariates and Special Populations 
The influence of selected demographic factors (body weight, body mass index [BMI], age, sex, race), 
population (healthy subjects, AD patients), baseline laboratory test results (creatinine clearance, 
aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], 
albumin), baseline Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, and anti-drug antibody (ADA) status 
were investigated in the covariate model. Weight was included as a covariate in all models. Covariates 
were tested using a typical stepwise forward addition (p<0.01) and backward deletion (p<0.001) 
method using the derived Model 4. Data base for covariate testing was mainly data collected from 
Phase 3 studies. Sensitivity analyses supported the identified covariates on PK parameter Ke and 
central volume (V2).   
Weight and albumin (on V2) and BMI, ADA, race and EASI score were statistically significant covariates 
on ke. Body weight had the most notable effect on variability in V2 (-27.3% and +35.6% change in 
V2) and BMI the greatest effect on ke (-9.29 and +14.4% change in ke). In the overall population PK 
analysis data set, weight ranged from 39.8 to 175 kg with mean weight of 76.6 kg. Mean BMI was 
calculated to 26.2, resulting from values ranging from 16.2 to 62.7. Individual post-hoc estimates of 
exposure at steady state (Studies R668- AD-1334, R668-1416 and R668-AD-1224) underline the body 
weight effect on exposure. Mean C trough value in body weight group < 70 kg is more than halved 
compared to the group weighing 100 kg and more (101 mg/L vs 41.8 mg/L; 300 mg Q2W). The same 
holds for AUC exposure (1670 mg*day/L vs 729 mg*day/L). The effect of BMI groups on dupilumab 
exposure in steady state is equally pronounced (Ctrough: 97.5 mg/L vs 48 mg/L; AUC: 1600 
mg*day/L vs 830 mg*day/L ).   While dupilumab trough concentrations were lower in subjects with 
higher body weight, there was no meaningful impact on efficacy . 
Based on the population PK analysis, mild to moderate renal impairment (predicted creatinine 
clearance of >30 ≤ 80 mL/min) did not affect the PK of dupilumab. No formal study was conducted in 
special populations, such as patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Thus the impact of severely 
impaired renal and hepatic function on PK is unknown.  
Gender was equally distributed among the study population (F: 41%, M: 59%); no differences in PK 
have been detected. Race has been identified as significant covariate based on model 4. Comparison of 
Asian vs. remaining population, African American/Black vs. remaining population and White vs. 
remaining population showed no major differences in individual ke and Vc. The PK of dupilumab was 
evaluated in healthy Japanese male subjects in study TDU12265. There were no obvious differences in 
the PK of dupilumab between healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects (R668-AS-0907). However, a 
300 mg single dose resulted in maximum mean dupilumab levels of ~38 mg/L in Japanese male 
healthy subjects (TDU12265) compared to 30 mg/L in all other healthy subjects at day 7. Results from 
Assessment report

the phase 3 study (R668-AD-1334) showed that exposure to functional dupilumab is similar for the 
subset of Asian AD patients and the non-Asian AD patient population.  
The patients’ age ranged from 18 years to 88 years. Only 61 patients were over 65 years of age 
(Studies R668-AD-1334, R668-1416 and R668-AD-1224). Population PK analysis did not indicate age 
to affect the PK of dupilumab (Ke, Vc).  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
As a monoclonal antibody, dupilumab is not anticipated to directly interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
enzymes thus no typical drug-drug interactions of dupilumab with other drugs via are expected. It is 
agreed that no influence of concomitant TCS can be detected based on comparison of PK data from 
patients involved in monotherapy studies SOLO1 and SOLO2 vs study R668-AD-1224.   
Limited in vitro data suggested that IL-4 and IL-13 may modulate the expression (and potentially the 
activities) of some CYP isoforms resulting in dysregulated drug metabolism that could influence the 
exposure of concomitant medications. A clinical study (R668-AD-1433) designed to examine the effects 
of dupilumab on the PK of selected CYP substrates in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD has 
been completed. This study did not indicate clinically relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 activity. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The  pathophysiology  of  atopic  dermatitis  is  influenced  by  genetics  and  environmental  factors  and 
involves  a  complex  interplay  between  antigens,  skin  barrier  defects,  and  immune  dysregulation,  in 
which a polarized inflammatory response induced by the marked activation of the Type 2/T-helper type 
2 (Th2) cell axis plays a central role. The primary skin defect may be an immunologic disturbance that 
causes  IgE-mediated  sensitization,  with  epithelial-barrier  dysfunction  that  is  the  consequence  of  both 
genetic mutations and local inflammation. 
Two cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4 (IL-4) and IL-13, are critical in the initiation and maintenance of the 
type2/Th2  inflammatory  pathway.  Downstream  effects  of  IL-4  and  IL-13  are  dependent  on  IL-4 
receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) signaling, which is inhibited by dupilumab. Dupilumab is a recombinant human 
IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the alpha sub-unit of the Type I and II interleukin-
4 receptors (IL-4Rα). Dupilumab inhibits IL-4 signaling via the Type I receptor (IL- 4Rα/γc), and both 
IL-4 and IL-13 signaling through the Type II receptor (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The Type2/Th2 cytokines produced by skin-infiltrating leukocytes, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, act 
on  keratinocytes  and  other  cell  types  to  induce  production  of  chemokines,  including  chemokine  (C-C 
motif)  ligand  17  (CCL17,  also  known  as  thymus  and  activation  regulated  chemokine  [TARC])  and 
CCL26  (eotaxin-3),  which  are  chemo  attractants  for  Th2  cells  and  eosinophils.  In  vitro,  dupilumab 
blocks TARC and eotaxins 3 induction by IL-4 and IL-13 in human blood. In addition, both IL-4 and IL-
13  are  present  at  elevated  levels  in  individuals  with  allergic  disease  including  AD.  Lactate 
dehydrogenase  (LDH)  was  also  used  as  a  PD  biomarker  and  was  determined  in  all  studies  as  part  of 
the standard laboratory testing. The PD of dupilumab was assessed in phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 
studies. Immunogenicity was assessed in all studies.

IL-4 and IL-13 levels increase in a transient manner following dupilumab treatment. This supports the 
dupilumab-mediated modulation of IL-4 and IL-13 signalling by blocking IL-4Rα. 
A  dose-  and  concentration-dependent  normalization  of  Serum  TARC,  Total  IgE,  and  LDH  following 
dupilumab  treatment  could  be  detected.  A  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  the  dupilumab  treatment 
groups compared to the placebo group achieved normal total serum IgE (ULN defined as 119 kU/L) at 
week 16 in the R668-AD-1224 study; however, the proportion of patients was low (8.2% for the 300 
mg  QW  group,  6.7%  for the  300  mg  Q2W  group  compared to  1.4%  for the  placebo  group).  After 52 
weeks  of  treatment,  total  IgE  was  normalized  in  11.7%  and  15.9%  of  patients  receiving  dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW, respectively, compared to 4.4% of patients receiving placebo. 
Almost  all  patients  treated  with  dupilumab  achieved  normal  LDH  at  both  week  16  and  week  52 
compared to approximately 50% of patients in the placebo group. 
The  percent  change  from  baseline  in  LDH,  TARC,  and  total  IgE  at  week  16  for  the  300  mg  Q2W  and 
300  mg  QW dose  regimens  for  patients  in the  following  weight  categories:  <70  kg,  ≥70  to  <100  kg, 
and  ≥100  kg  has  been  assessed.  Data  indicate  that  there  are  only  small  differences  in  mean  PD 
response between patients in the different body weight groups.  
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity  assessments  and  monitoring  were  performed  for  all  clinical  studies.  Overall,  ADA 
incidence  throughout  the  studies  is  rather  low  and  comparable  among  the  treatment  groups.    In  the 
16-week studies, approximately 7% of subjects treated with DUPIXENT and 2% of subjects on placebo 
developed antibodies to dupilumab, while in the 52-week study, approximately 7% of subjects treated 
with  DUPIXENT  +  TCS  and  8%  of  subjects  on  placebo  +  TCS  developed  antibodies  to  dupilumab. 
Majority  of  the  ADA  positive  patients  exhibited  low  titers  (<1000).  Less  than  2%  of  patients  treated 
with  dupilumab  +  TCS  and  3%  of  patients  treated  with  placebo  +  TCS  exhibited  ADA  positive 
responses  lasting  more  than  12  weeks.  Except  in  a  few  cases  with  high  ADA  titers,  development  of 
anti-drug antibodies was generally not associated with loss of efficacy. Of the subjects that developed 
antibodies  in  the  16-week  studies,  approximately  2%  of  all  subjects  treated  with  DUPIXENT  and 
approximately  0.5%  of  all  subjects  on  placebo  had  antibodies  that  were  classified  as  neutralizing.  Of 
the subjects that developed antibodies in the 52-week study, approximately 1% of all subjects treated 
with DUPIXENT and approximately 0.7% of all subjects on placebo had antibodies that were classified 
as neutralizing. 
Exposure-Response 
In  order  to  investigate  the  relationship  of  measures  of  drug  exposure  with  response,  the  exposure-
response  relationships  for  the  efficacy  endpoints  (EASI,  pruritus  Numerical  Rating  Scale  [NRS], 
Investigator’s  Global  Assessment  [IGA])  were  also  assessed  for  both  dupilumab  trough  concentration 
and AUC. The relationship between dupilumab exposure and its effects on the following adverse event 
(AE) terms was also assessed: Conjunctivitis (narrow), Herpes Simplex, and Herpes through empirical 
exposure-response  analyses  that  utilized  dupilumab  concentration  from  week  0  to  week  16  vs 
incidence of these AEs from baseline to week 16. 
Exposure-response analyses were conducted using pooled data from the phase 3 monotherapy studies 
in order to evaluate the influence of drug concentration on the efficacy and safety of dupilumab; study 
R668-AD-1224  (long-term  treatment  [LTT])  was  analyzed  separately  as  patients  were  treated  with 
concomitant topical corticosteroids (TCS).  
Exposure – Efficacy Relationship 
No notable difference is observed when comparing mean percent change from baseline EASI score, the 
proportion of patients achieving IGA 0-1 and  the mean percent change from baseline for peak pruritus 
Assessment report

NRS  for  the  300  mg  Q2W  and  300  mg  QW  treatment  regimens.  This  analysis  found  the  majority  of 
patients responded well to dupilumab treatment in all 3 studies (R668-AD-1334, R668-AD-1416, R668-
AD-1224),  whether  using  a  300  mg  Q2W  or  300  mg  QW  regimen.  At  week  16  when  the  primary 
endpoint was assessed, there was no notable difference in mean PD efficacy response between the 300 
mg Q2W and the 300 mg QW treatment regimens, thus, no dose-response relationship with regard to 
efficacy is detectable including the long-term treatment study.  
Despite  this  apparent  lack  of  a  dose-response  relationship  based  on  mean  PD  data,  the  quartile 
analysis  of  dupilumab-treated  patients  from  the  two  phase  3  mono-therapy  studies  showed  a  clear 
exposure-response  relationship.  With  quartiles  based  on  Ctrough  at  week  16,  the  lowest  quartile  of 
exposure resulted in a smaller reduction from baseline in EASI  score (70%) than the  highest quartile 
(81%).  Addressing  the  300  QW  and  300  Q2W  regimens  separately,  a  consistent  trend  of  increasing 
reduction in  EASI  with  increasing  quartile  of exposure  between  Q1  and  Q4  could  be  detected.  Trends 
remain when assessing exposure-efficacy by AUC0-112. Similarly, the proportion of patients achieving 
IGA  0-1  increased  from  37.1%  to  56.6%  for  the  lowest  and  highest  quartile  of  dupilumab 
concentrations  at  day  112,  with  a  consistent  difference  when  assessed  by  Ctrough  or  AUC0-112  and 
dosing  regimens  separately.  The  E/R  relationship  based  on  NRS  is  similar  but  notably  shallower  than 
that observed based on e.g. EASI score, which showed an 11% difference between Q4 and Q1. 
Subgroup  analysis  with  focus  on  body  weight  showed  that  for  both  EASI  and  IGA,  a  greater 
improvement  was  observed  in  the  lowest  quartile  of  body  weight  than  in  the  highest  quartile.  For 
patients in the lowest quartile of body weight (<64 kg), the mean percent improvement in EASI score 
at  week  16  was  76.2%,  in  contrast  to  a  mean  improvement  of  70.7%  for  patients  in  the  highest 
quartile of body weight (>88.5 kg). In the lowest quartile of body weight, 51.9% of patients achieved 
IGA 0-1 compared to 39.8% in the highest quartile of body weight. When assessed across the quartiles 
Q3  to  Q1, the  impact of  body  weight  on  response is  far  less.  Thus,  the  overall  body  weight  effect on 
exposure  accounts  for  a  great  portion  of  the  overall  E/R  relationship,  while  the  majority  of  patients 
treated with 300 mg Q2W receive significant and possible their own maximal treatment benefit. Some 
patients  (in  the  highest  body  weight  quartile)  may  receive  some  additional  benefit  from  the  higher 
exposure associated with the more intense 300 mg QW treatment regimen. 
Population  exposure-efficacy  analysis  selected  BMI  (or  body  weight)  on  baseline  response  (E0)  as 
major  covariate  based  on  a  Emax  model  that  has  been  established  only  for  the  EASI  score  efficacy 
parameter.  EC50  values  for  Ctrough  and  AUC  were  estimated  to  30  mg/L  and  5570  mg*day/L, 
respectively.  EC50  Ctrough  level  is  achieved  among  all  bodyweight  groups,  while  the  selected  AUC-
level is far beyond the AUC values reached in any body weight group. No conclusions should be drawn 
based on the EC50 levels as they have been estimated with large confidence intervals.   
Exposure – Safety Relationship 
The  descriptive  exposure-response  analysis  for  safety  illustrated  that  the  adverse  events  identified  in 
the  phase  3  studies  (conjunctivitis,  herpes  simplex,  and  oral  herpes)  were  balanced  across  the 
quartiles of  exposure  and no  exposure-response  relationship  could  be identified,  given  the  limitations 
of the safety data. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No  major  differences in  bioavailability  due to  different  cell  lines,  manufacturing  processes  or  duration 
of injection (slow rate of 10 minutes vs fast rate of 30 seconds) could be detected in healthy volunteer 
studies.

No direct comparison between PK in healthy subjects and AD patients were possible as there are only 
single dose PK data collected from healthy subjects and only multiple dose PK data from AD patients. 
Among  healthy  subjects  and  AD  patients,  PK  is  generally  deemed  comparable  on  the  basis  of  mean 
Ctrough  values.  This  is  supported  by  population  PK  analysis  indicating  that  the  PK  of  functional 
dupilumab in AD patients and healthy subjects is neither significantly nor meaningfully different. 
The  terminal  elimination  phase  is  described  by  target-mediated  clearance  leading  to  pronounced 
nonlinear  kinetics.  Thus  terminal  half-life  varied  across  the  concentration  ranges.  For  the  envisaged 
dosing  regimen,  the  applicant  was  asked  to  calculate  t1/2  considering  non-linear  kinetics  and  target-
mediated effects to be stated in the SmPC for the exposure range (Cmin_ss, Cmax_ss) in the steady 
state. 
The  600  mg  loading  dose  enabled  a  more  rapid  increase  in  exposure  allowing  approximately  75%  of 
the steady-state concentration to be reached by week 4.  
Using  data  from  5000  subjects,  the  applicant  has  used  the  PK  population  model  to  estimate  the 
predicted  mean  Cmax,SS  for  both  the  300  mg  Q2W  and  300  mg  QW  doses  of  dupilumab.  Samples 
collected from the clinical trials constituted a comprehensive dataset allowing a proper characterization 
of the PK of dupilumab in the relevant patient population. Low fluctuations between trough and Cmax 
levels were predicted for both dosing regimens and were adequately justified based on low clearance 
at target-saturating concentrations.  
A clinical study (R668-AD-1433) designed to examine the effects of dupilumab on the PK of selected 
CYP substrates in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD has been completed  The results did not 
indicate clinically relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 
activity.   
The  chosen  PD  biomarkers  and  response  parameters  are  deemed  plausible  and  indicate  a  proof  of 
concepts. Dupilumab showed no dose-response relationship but a clear exposure response relationship 
with regard to efficacy. Some patients (in the highest body weight quartile characterized by the lowest 
exposure)  may  receive  some  additional  benefit  from  the  higher  exposure  associated  with  the  more 
intense 300 mg QW treatment regimen.  
Rates of ADA and NAb development appear to be low with dupilumab, with a higher incidence seen in 
subjects who were administered lower doses of dupilumab or those who received Q2W doses rather 
than QW doses. Less than 2% of patients treated with dupilumab and 3% of patients treated with 
placebo exhibited positive responses in the ADA assay that last more than 12 weeks. Of these positive 
samples, the majority exhibited low titers (<1000) and the distribution of dupilumab concentrations 
was within the range observed for patients who exhibited negative responses in the ADA assay at all 
times.  
Two patients treated with 300 mg QW, positive in the ADA assay at week 16 with high titers and also 
positive in the NAb assay had reductions in serum dupilumab concentrations temporally associated 
with the development of ADA and lost efficacy over time. Neutralizing antibodies were not generally 
associated with loss of efficacy, except in patients who exhibited high titer ADA responses. Positive 
responses in the ADA assay were generally not associated with an impact on exposure, safety or 
efficacy. In the overall exposure pool, less than 0.1% of patients exhibited high titer ADA responses 
associated with reduced exposure and efficacy. In general, there does not appear to be a marked 
impact on efficacy scores in subjects who develop ADAs or NAbs. Longer term data are required to 
characterise the risk of ADA/NAb persistence.  
It  is  noted  that  rates  of  anti-drug  antibody  development  in  the  3  formulation  comparison  studies  in 
healthy  volunteers  (and in  particular  studies  PKM14161  and  PKM14271)  were  higher  than  those  seen 
in the Phase II and III clinical trials.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic profile of dupilumab has been adequately characterised. Based on the PK-PD data 
presented in the dossier, the proposed posology of 300 mg Q2W, following a 600 mg loading dose has 
been agreed.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The development program of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis consisted of eleven studies (10 double-
blind placebo-controlled studies plus 1 OLE study) with a treatment period of ≥4 weeks. A total of over 
2500 patients with AD contributed data for efficacy analysis, including patients randomized in the 2 
phase 3, placebo-controlled, 16-week monotherapy studies SOLO 1 R668-AD-1334 (671 patients) and 
SOLO 2 R668-AD-1416 (708 patients), and in the phase 3, placebo-controlled study CHRONOS R668-
AD-1224 of 52-week concomitant treatment with TCS (740 patients). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
R668-AD-1021 was a phase 2b, 32-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
dose-ranging study to assess the dose-response profile of SC doses of dupilumab. 
The study consisted of a 16-week treatment period, during which patients were treated with dupilumab 
(100 mg Q4W, 300 mg Q4W, 200 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q2W, or 300 mg QW) or placebo, and a 16-week 
follow-up period. All patients received a loading dose on day 1 (600 mg for all 300 mg dose regimens 
and 400 mg for the 100 mg and 200 mg dose regimens). The target population was adults with 
moderate-to-severe AD that could not be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom 
topical treatment was otherwise inadvisable (e.g., side effects or safety risks). Efficacy assessments 
included EASI, IGA of AD severity, pruritus scores (NRS, 4-point categorical scale, and 5-D pruritus 
scale), SCORAD, POEM, and GISS. 
Medications (other than the study drug) and procedures that were used for the treatment of AD were 
considered rescue treatment. Patients who received rescue treatment were permanently discontinued 
from study drug. 
A total of 380 patients were enrolled into the study and randomized. Baseline demographic as well as 
baseline disease characteristics, with respect to duration, extent, and severity of AD characteristics 
were similar among the treatment groups 
The efficacy results showed that all dosing regimens improved AD severity scores compared to 
placebo. The results of the primary efficacy analysis show a dose-dependent, statistically significant 
reduction in EASI scores from baseline to week 16. The highest reductions in EASI were observed in 
the 300 mg Q2W (50.1%) and in the 300 mg QW (55.7%). The results from the secondary endpoints 
are in-line with the effects seen from the primary endpoint.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study R668-AD-1224: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to demonstrate the 
efficacy and long-term safety of dupilumab in adult patients with moderate- to- severe atopic 
dermatitis (Chronos) 
Methods 
This was a 64-week (52-week treatment period plus 12-week follow-up), double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to confirm the efficacy and safety of dupilumab administered 
concomitantly with TCS in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. 
Study Participants  
The target population consisted of patients with moderate-to-severe AD that was not adequately 
controlled with medium to high potency TCS (±TCI, as appropriate). 
Key inclusion criteria: 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 31/100 
 
  
 
 
 
 
1.  Chronic AD (according to the American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria, 
[Eichenfield 2014]), that was present for at least 3 years before the screening visit 
2.  Documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of inadequate response 
to a sufficient course of outpatient treatment with topical AD medication(s) 
a.  
Inadequate response represented failure to achieve and maintain remission or a low  
disease activity state (comparable to IGA 0 = clear to 2 = mild) despite treatment with 
a daily regimen of TCS of medium to high potency (± TCI as appropriate), applied for  
at least 28 days or for the maximum duration recommended by the product prescribing 
information (e.g., 14 days for super-potent TCS), whichever was shorter. 
b.  
Patients with documented systemic treatment for AD in the past 6 months were also  
considered as inadequate responders to topical treatments and were potentially eligible 
for treatment with dupilumab after appropriate washout. 
c.  
Acceptable documentation included contemporaneous chart notes that recorded TCS  
with or without TCI prescription and treatment  outcome, or investigator documentation 
based on communication with the patient’s treating physician. If documentation was  
inadequate, potential patients were re-screened after such documentation was  
obtained (e.g., patients were shown to fail a 28-day course of mid-to-higher potency  
TCS [± TCI]). 
3.  IGA score ≥ 3 (on the 0 to 4 IGA scale, in which 3 was moderate and 4 was severe) at the 
screening and baseline visits 
4.  ≥ 10% lesional BSA of AD involvement in areas that could be treated with medium or higher 
potency TCS at the screening and baseline visits 
5.  EASI score ≥ 16 at the screening and baseline visits 
6.  Baseline Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) average score for maximum itch intensity ≥ 3 
7.  Had applied a stable dose of a topical emollient (moisturizer) twice daily for at least the 7 
consecutive days immediately before the baseline visit. 
The exclusion criteria were designed to ensure patients safety. Excluded were patients with active 
chronic or acute infections including HIV and hepatitis B and C, history of immunosuppression, 
presence of skin comorbidities, regular use of tanning beds, history of malignancies, active 
endoparasitic infections and other severe illnesses that could have affected the patient´s participation 
in the study. Patients being unable to safely use TCS i.e. having important side effects of topical 
medication or ≥ 30% of the total lesional surface were located on areas of thin skin that cannot be 
safely treated with medium or higher potency TCS at the baseline visit, were excluded.  
Treatments 
Investigational treatment: 
•  Dupilumab 150 mg/mL vial: Each 5 mL vial contained 2.5 mL (150 mg/mL) with a 
withdrawable volume of 2.0 mL or 300 mg of study drug.  
•  Dupilumab 150 mg/mL prefilled syringe: Each 2.25 mL single-use, prefilled glass syringe with 
snap-off cap delivered 2.0 mL of a 150 mg/mL solution (300 mg) of study drug.  
Treatment administered:

o  QW subcutaneous (SC) injections of 300 mg dupilumab following a loading dose of 600 
mg on day 1 or 
o 
 Q2W SC injections of 300 mg dupilumab following a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1 
(with placebo on alternating weeks) or 
o  Placebo matching dupilumab was prepared in the same formulation: Matching QW SC 
injections of placebo (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the 
loading dose) 
Background Treatment 
All patients were required to apply emollients at least twice daily for at least the 7 consecutive days 
immediately before randomization and to continue throughout the study for 64 weeks. All types of 
emollients were permitted, but patients could not initiate treatment with prescription moisturizers or 
moisturizers containing additives during the screening period or during the study. Patients could have 
continued using stable doses of prescription emollients if initiated before the screening visit. 
Starting on day 1 all patients were required to initiate treatment with TCS. A medium potency TCS was 
applied once daily to areas with active lesions. A low potency TCS was used once daily on areas of thin 
skin (face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atrophy, etc.) or for areas where 
continued treatment with medium potency TCS was considered unsafe.  
After lesions were under control (clear or almost clear), treatment was switched from medium potency 
to low potency TCS once daily for 7 days, then stopped. If lesions returned, treatment with medium 
potency TCS was reinstituted, with the step-down approach described above upon lesion resolution. 
For lesions persisting or worsening under once daily treatment with medium potency TCS, patients 
were treated (rescued) with high or super-high potency TCS, unless higher potency TCS were 
considered unsafe. Rescue treatment with systemic therapy (systemic corticosteroids, systemic non-
steroidal immunosuppressants) was also permitted after Week 2. If a patient received rescue 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids or nonsteroidal systemic immunosuppressive/ 
immunomodulating drugs, study treatment was temporarily discontinued. After the treatment with 
these medications was completed, study treatment could be resumed, but not sooner than 5 half-lives 
after the last dose of systemic rescue medication. 
The patients were monitored for signs of local or systemic TCS toxicity and treatment was stepped 
down or stopped, as necessary. 
Type and amount of the TCS and TCI used was determined by weighing the tube at each visit, which 
was recorded.  
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
• 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab administered 
concomitantly with TCS through week 16 in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD 
compared to placebo administered concomitantly with TCS. 
Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of the study were to: 
• 
Evaluate the long-term efficacy of dupilumab when administered concomitantly with TCS for up 
to 52 weeks 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 33/100 
 
  
 
• 
Evaluate the long-term safety of dupilumab when administered concomitantly with TCS for up 
to 52 weeks 
Research Objectives 
The research objective was to assess the relationship between long-term exposure to dupilumab and 
potential biomarkers of AD and response to treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints were proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 and with both IGA 0 or 
1 and a reduction of ≥ 2 points at week 16. Key secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients 
with improvement (≥ 4 points) of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to week 2, 
4 and 16, reduction ≥ 3 points of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to week 16, 
the percent change from baseline to week 16 in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS and EASI-
75 and IGA 0 or 1 at week 52. 
Sample size 
The sample size was chosen to allow for an adequate characterization of the long-term safety profile of 
dupilumab. With 300, 100, and 300 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW, dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, 
and placebo groups, respectively, there was about 99% power in both primary efficacy comparisons 
(dupilumab 300 mg QW vs placebo and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W vs. placebo, each comparison 
performed at alpha = 0.025, 2-sided) to detect a difference of 29% between dupilumab and placebo 
regarding IGA response at week 16, assuming response rates of 38% (dupilumab) and 9% (placebo). 
This sample size also provides 99% power with regard to EASI-75 response in both comparisons 
assuming response rates at week 16 of 58% (dupilumab) and 15% (placebo). The assumptions were 
based on results from a phase 2 study, R668-AD-1117.  To account for drop outs approximately 700 
patients were planned to be enrolled. 
Randomisation 
The subjects were randomized in a 3:1:3 ratio (dupilumab 300 mg QW: 300 mg Q2W : placebo). In all 
studies randomization was stratified by disease severity (IGA 3 vs IGA 4) and region (Asia Pacific, 
Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and North and South America).  
 In each study randomization was performed according to a central randomization scheme provided by 
an interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS). 
Blinding (masking) 
The pivotal studies were double blind. With the exception of the IVRS/IWRS statistician (providing the 
randomization), the IDMC statistician and the IDMC members, and except for the provisions for 
emergency unblinding, all studies remained blinded until the pre-specified unblinding to conduct the 
primary analyses in each study. 
Statistical methods 
In all studies data were described by means of statistical characteristics (continuous data: number of 
patients, mean, median, standard deviation, Q1, Q3, minimum, and maximum; categorical or ordinal 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 34/100 
 
  
 
data: absolute and relative frequencies per category) stratified for treatment group and visit (if 
applicable). 
For the 3 pivotal studies the primary efficacy analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS) of 
all patients randomized, as well as on the per protocol set (PPS) excluding patients with major protocol 
violations as a supporting analysis. The primary (null-) hypotheses of no difference between each of 
the dupilumab groups and placebo was tested by means of a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted 
by randomization strata (region, disease severity). For each comparison both co-primary endpoints 
(IGA response at week 16 and EASI-75 response at week 16) had to be statistically significant (at the 
2.5%-level, 2-sided) in order to declare the corresponding dupilumab group superior to placebo. To 
account for missing values / intake of rescue medication, patients were counted as non-responder for 
the time points after withdrawal / first use of rescue medication. 
Binary secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed using the same approach as that used for the 
analysis of the primary endpoints. If a patient had a missing value at a given week, they were counted 
as a non-responder for that week. 
The continuous endpoints were analysed using multiple imputation (MI) with an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model. Patients’ efficacy data after rescue treatment usage were set to missing first, and 
were then imputed by the MI method. 
In addition to the method described above, various sensitivity analyses for the continuous endpoints 
for EASI and/or Pruritus NRS were conducted: 
1. 
An analysis based on all observed data no matter if rescue treatment is used or data is 
collected after withdrawal using the MI method. 
2. 
A mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis (initially planned as main analysis 
for continuous data for EU and Japan) including factors (fixed effects) for treatment, baseline strata, 
visit, baseline value, treatment-by-visit interaction, and baseline-by-visit interaction as covariates. An 
unstructured covariance matrix was used to model the within-patient errors. Efficacy data were set to 
missing after rescue treatment. The MMRM model was to be implemented for two sets of analyses 
separately: 
a. 
b. 
3. 
Endpoints at week 16 by including data up to week 16 
Endpoints at week 52 by including all data up to week 52 
An ANCOVA model, including the treatment group, the baseline value and the randomization 
strata where efficacy data were set to missing after use of rescue medication. The post-baseline LOCF 
method was then to be used to impute missing values. 
4. 
An ANCOVA model, including the treatment group, the baseline value and the randomization 
strata where efficacy data were set to missing after use of rescue medication. The post-baseline worst-
observed-case-forward (WOCF) method was then be used to impute missing values. 
5. 
An ANCOVA model, including study, the treatment group, the baseline value and the 
randomization strata based on all observed value regardless rescue medication used. No imputation 
method was to be applied for the sensitivity analysis. 
To control for multiplicity regarding the testing of secondary endpoints only if both co-primary 
endpoints were significant, the secondary endpoints were to be tested following the hierarchical testing 
procedure with a pre-specified order, i.e. inferential conclusions about secondary endpoints required 
statistical significance at the 0.025 significance level (2-sided) of the prior ones.

Safety data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Safety analyses were based on study specific 
safety analysis set (SAF). 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 957 patients were screened, of whom 740 were enrolled into the study and randomized (315 
patients in the placebo + TCS group, 106 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group, and 
319 patients in the 300 mg QW + TCS group. A total of 217 patients were considered screen failures, 
mostly due violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Recruitment 
34.3% of all patients were enrolled in the Americas, 13.8% in the Western European region, 26.4% in 
the Eastern European region, and 25.5% in the Asia Pacific region. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 4 global amendments and 7 country-specific amendments to the study protocol. The 
amendments and types of protocol deviations are considered not to have impacted the results of the 
study.

14.0% (44/315) of patients in the placebo + TCS group, 13.2% (14/106) of patients in the dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W + TCS group, and 12.5% (40/319) of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS group 
had at least 1 major protocol deviation. 28 of the 30 major protocol violations involved the use of 
rescue treatment in the form of high potency TCS during the first 2 weeks of the trial, when rescue 
treatment was prohibited per protocol. 2 protocol violations involved the use of expired laboratory 
sampling kits. Other types of protocol deviations were in the categories `Procedure not performed’, 
‘Inadequate informed consent administration ‘and `dosing noncompliance´. The primary efficacy 
endpoints were evaluated as a supportive analysis in the PPS, which excluded patients with major 
protocol violations deemed to potentially impact the assessment of efficacy. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar among the treatment groups. Most patients 
were White (66.2%) or Asian (27.2%), with a mean age of 37.1±13.46 years. 60.3% of patients were 
men, and 39.7% were women. The mean (SD) duration of AD, the mean EASI score and the mean IGA 
score were similar between the treatment groups. 28.0% of patients had a history of prior cyclosporine 
treatment. 52.8% of patients had received systemic therapy for their AD, which included systemic 
corticosteroids (34.2%) and systemic nonsteroidal immunosuppressants (33.6%). Prior medication use 
was generally similar among all treatment groups. 
Baseline Disease Characteristics 
The proportion of patients diagnosed with AD within specified age ranges was generally balanced 
between the placebo and dupilumab groups, with the majority (≥50%) of patients in the placebo and 
dupilumab groups diagnosed before the age of 5 years old. 
The mean duration of AD was similar between the placebo (27.5 years), dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (30.1 
years), and dupilumab 300 mg QW (27.9 years) groups. 
The mean EASI score was 32.6±12.9 for patients in the placebo group, 33.6±13.3 for patients in the 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 32.1±12.8 for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. The 
mean IGA score was 3.5±0.5 for all treatment groups, and scores of 3 and 4 were evenly split. The 
mean peak weekly averaged pruritus NRS was 7.3±1.8 for patients in the placebo group, 7.4±1.7 for 
patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 7.1±1.9 for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
group.  The mean duration of AD was similar between groups, with 27.5±14.3 years in the placebo + 
TCS arm, 30.1±15.5 years in the 300 mg Q2W + TCS arm, and 27.9±14.5 years in the 300 mg QW + 
TCS arm. Overall, 25.7% of patients had a history of prior systemic cyclosporine treatment. 
Numbers analysed 
All 740 patients randomized were included in the SAF and the FAS. 
The FAS included all randomized patients and was analysed based on the treatment allocated by the 
IVRS/IWRS. A total of 30 randomized patients were excluded from the PPS because of major violations 
of efficacy-related entry criteria (4 patients), they received <80% or >120% of scheduled doses (21 
patients), or site closure (5 patients).

Outcomes and estimation 
Co-primary endpoints 
The Co-Primary Endpoints of study R668-AD-1224 show a significant higher effect of dupilumab 300 
mg QW and Q2W each in combination with TCS on the severity of AD compared to placebo + TCS.  
• 
The proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥ 2 points at week 
16 was higher in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W +TCS (38.7%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW 
(39.2%) groups than in the placebo + TCS group (12.4%).

•  Also for the other co-primary endpoint a higher efficacy was demonstrated in both dupilumab 
groups. 68.9% achieved an EASI-75 at week 16 in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, followed by 
63.9% in the dupilumab 300 mg QW and 23.2% in the placebo group. The comparisons were 
statistically significant (p<0.0001 for each).

Week 52 
The study report submitted as part of the MAA submission was considered the primary analysis for 
study R668-AD-1224 and included primary and secondary efficacy analyses at Week 16 for all 
randomized patients (n=740). The Week 52 efficacy analyses for patients who were randomized by 27 
April 2015 and who would have completed the 52-week visit (n=623) and safety data from all treated 
patients whose data were available at the data cut-off date (27 April 2016) were also provided in this 
analysis. At the time of the data cut-off date, 101 patients – mostly from Japan/Korea – were still 
ongoing in the study. The final study presents the results (described above) based on the final 
database lock (16 December 2016) as an integrated analysis of all randomized patients. Both efficacy 
and safety analyses in this final report are entirely consistent with those in the primary analysis.  
However, as the integrated full analysis at week 52 (described below) was not controlled for 
multiplicity, data from the primary analysis is presented in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Clinical Response in Patients for whom Ciclosporin Treatment was Inadvisable 
In the CHRONO study, a subset of patients named subset 3 was defined to reflect the R668-AD-1424 
population. This subset includes all patients who showed an inadequate efficacy response to oral 
ciclosporin, patients who showed an inadequate efficacy response or were intolerant to oral ciclosporin, 
plus patients who did not receive prior oral ciclosporin treatment because ciclosporin was 
contraindicated or because treatment with oral ciclosporin was otherwise medically inadvisable. 
The data show that patients in subset 3 experienced clinically meaningful improvements in signs and 
symptoms of AD at week 16. Analyses of the data demonstrated that the proportion of patients who 
met the categorical endpoints in both dupilumab + TCS groups was greater than in the placebo + TCS 
group (nominal p-values <0.05 vs patients in subset 3 treated with placebo + TCS, Table below). 
Further, the percent reduction from baseline in peak pruritus NRS score was greater in both dupilumab

+ TCS groups than in the placebo + TCS group (nominal p-values <0.01 vs patients in subset 3 
treated with placebo + TCS, Table below). The improvements in signs and symptoms of AD in patients 
from subset 3 were sustained at week 52.

Ancillary analyses 
Anti-Drug Antibody Analysis 
The proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent positive response in the ADA assay was similar 
across treatment groups. Persistent ADA responses were observed in a higher proportion of patients in 
the placebo + TCS group. All treatment-emergent responses had titers that ranged in the low-to-
moderate titer category. There were no high-titer (>10,000) ADA assay responses observed in any 
treatment group. 
All samples positive in the ADA assay were further characterized for the presence of neutralizing 
antibodies. Two (0.7%) patients in the placebo + TCS group and 1 (1.0%) patient in the dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W + TCS group were positive in the NAb assay. 
Study R668-AD-1334 (SOLO 1) and R668-AD-1416 (SOLO 2) 
The studies Solo1 and Solo2 were confirmatory, monotherapy phase 3 studies, conducted in patients 
with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease was not adequately controlled with topical medications. 
These studies were identical and are therefore described together.   
R668-AD-1334 (SOLO 1) 
A Phase 3 confirmatory study investigating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab 
monotherapy administered to adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.  
R668-AD-1416 (SOLO 2) 
A Phase 3 confirmatory study investigating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab 
monotherapy administered to adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.  
Methods 
R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) and R668-AD-1416 (Solo2) were conducted as phase 3, multicenter, double-
blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies to confirm the efficacy and safety of SC dupilumab in 
adults with moderate-to-severe AD. 
Both studies consisted of a screening period of 35 day, a 16-week treatment period, during which 
patients were treated with dupilumab (300 mg QW or 300 mg Q2W) or placebo, and a 12-week follow-
up period (for patients not participating in the maintenance or OLE studies). Efficacy assessments 
included EASI, IGA of AD severity, pruritus NRS, BSA involvement with AD, SCORAD, GISS, DLQI, 
POEM, and HADS. 
Study Participants  
The included patients were male or female, 18 years or older with a chronic AD, (according to 
American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria [Eichenfield 2014]), that had been present for 
at least 3 years before the screening visit. To define the severity of the AD the EASI score had to be 
≥ 16 at the screening and baseline visits, the IGA score ≥ 3 (on the 0 to 4 IGA scale, in which 3 is 
moderate and 4 is severe) at the screening and baseline visits and ≥ 10% body surface area (BSA) 
must have been with AD involvement at the screening and baseline visits. Baseline Pruritus Numerical 
Rating Scale (NRS) needed to have an average score for maximum itch intensity ≥ 3. Excluded were 
patients with active chronic or acute infections including HIV and hepatitis B and C, history of 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 43/100 
 
  
 
 
immunosuppression, presence of skin comorbidities, regular use of tanning booths, history of 
malignancies, active endoparasitic infections and other severe illnesses that could have affected the 
patient´s participation in the study. 
Treatments 
Screening visits were scheduled within 35 days prior to randomization. During this period, treatments 
for AD were washed out, according to eligibility requirements. In addition, patients were required to 
apply moisturizers at least twice daily for at least 7 consecutive days immediately before 
randomization and continuing throughout the study. However, to allow for adequate assessment of 
skin dryness, moisturizers were not to be applied on the areas of non-lesional skin designated for such 
assessments for at least 8 hours before each clinic visit. 
Patients who continued to meet all eligibility criteria at baseline underwent day 1/baseline assessments 
and were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive the following: 
•  QW subcutaneous (SC) injections of 300 mg dupilumab following a loading dose of 600 mg on 
day 1 
•  Q2W SC injections of 300 mg dupilumab following a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1 
• 
or matching QW SC injections of placebo (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to 
match the loading dose) 
In order to maintain blinding, all patients received an injection each week from day 1 through week 15. 
Patients in the dupilumab 300 mg SC Q2W group received placebo on the weeks when dupilumab was 
not administered. Randomization was stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [IGA 3] vs. 
severe [IGA 4]) and by region (Asia Pacific, East Europe, West Europe, and North and South America). 
Following the initial dose, study treatment was administered weekly for the subsequent 15 weeks. 
Following the first 3 weekly injections patients had the option to self-administer study drug or have a 
caregiver administer study drug, after appropriate training, outside of the study site during the weeks 
in which no clinic visits were scheduled. 
During the 16-week treatment period, patients had weekly study visits (some visits could be conducted 
by telephone). Safety laboratory tests, collection of samples for dupilumab concentrations and ADA, 
and clinical assessments were performed at specified clinic visits as noted in the Schedule of Events. 
The end of treatment visit occurred at week 16, one week after the last dose of study drug. The 
primary endpoint was determined at week 16. Patients with IGA scores of 0 or 1 or Eczema Area and 
Severity Index (EASI)-75 at week 16 who had not received rescue treatment for AD were eligible to 
participate in a maintenance study. Patients who met eligibility criteria for the maintenance study but 
chose not to participate were potentially eligible to participate in an open label extension (OLE) study 
36 weeks after completing the week 16 visit. Patients who did not meet eligibility criteria for the 
maintenance study were to undergo a variable follow-up period (between 4 and 12 weeks) and were 
eligible to participate in the OLE study when their IGA score was ≥ 3 or they reached week 28, 
whichever came first. 
Patients could have received rescue treatment with an otherwise prohibited medication for treatment 
of intolerable AD symptoms during the study. Patients who received rescue treatment continued study 
treatment if rescue consisted of topical medications. Topical calcineurin inhibitors could be used for 
rescue, but were reserved for problem areas only (e.g., face, neck, intertriginous and genital areas). 
Investigators attempted to limit rescue treatment to topical medications, and to escalate to systemic 
medications only if patients did not respond adequately after at least 7 days of topical treatment. If 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 44/100 
 
  
 
disease severity or other medical considerations did not permit this gradual rescue approach, patients 
could be rescued directly with higher potency topical medications or with systemic treatments. If a 
patient received rescue treatment with systemic corticosteroids or nonsteroidal systemic 
immunosuppressive/ immunomodulating drugs, study treatment was temporarily discontinued. After 
the treatment with these medications was completed, study treatment could be resumed, but not 
sooner than 5 half-lives after the last dose of systemic rescue medication. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab monotherapy 
compared to placebo treatment in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. 
Secondary Objective 
The secondary objective of the study was to assess the safety of dupilumab monotherapy compared to 
placebo treatment in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints were proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 and with both IGA 0 
or1 and a reduction of ≥2 points at week 16. Key secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients 
with improvement (reduction ≥ 4 points) of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to 
week 2, 4 and 16, reduction ≥ 3 points of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to 
week 16, the percent change from baseline to week 16 in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS. 
Sample size 
To detect a difference of 29% between dupilumab and placebo  regarding IGA response (i.e. IGA score 
of 0 to 1) at week 16, assuming response rates of 38% (dupilumab) and 9% (placebo), 55 subjects 
per group were required in order to achieve 90% power (alpha = 0.025, 2-sided). To ensure that 
sufficient safety information was collected, and to ensure that a sufficient number of responders would 
be available for inclusion in the maintenance study, the sample size was increased to 200 subjects per 
group, i.e. 600 subjects in total. With 200 subjects per group, the study would provide 99% power in 
both comparisons (dupilumab 300 mg QW vs. placebo treatment, and dupilumab 300 mg Q2W vs. 
placebo, each comparison performed at alpha = 0.025, 2-sided). These numbers of patients would also 
provide 99% power to detect a difference of 43% in the proportions of patients achieving EASI-75 
response at week 16, assuming that the proportions were 58% (dupilumab) and 15% (placebo). 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (dupilumab 300 mg QW: 300 mg Q2W : placebo). In all 
studies randomization was stratified by disease severity (IGA 3 vs IGA 4) and region (Asia Pacific, 
Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and North and South America).  
 In each study randomization was performed according to a central randomization scheme provided by 
an interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS).

Blinding (masking) 
The pivotal studies were double blind. With the exception of the IVRS/IWRS statistician (providing the 
randomization), the IDMC statistician and the IDMC members, and except for the provisions for 
emergency unblinding, all studies remained blinded until the prespecified unblinding to conduct the 
primary analyses in each study. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical methods were as described for study R668-AD-1224.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Study R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) 
A total of 917 patients were screened, of whom 671 were enrolled into the study and randomized (224 
patients in the placebo group, 224 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 223 patients in 
the 300 mg QW group). 
The proportion of patients who withdrew from study treatment was higher in the placebo group 
(17.9%) than in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (7.1%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW group 
(11.7%). The 3 most frequently cited reasons for withdrawal from study treatment, which were 
reported for a greater proportion of placebo patients than dupilumab patients, were AEs (3.3% 
[22/671]), lack of efficacy (2.7%), and “other” (5.8%). The only other reason for withdrawal from 
study treatment (protocol violation) was reported for <1% of all patients. 
A total of 553 of the 671 patients transitioned into either the maintenance study (246/671) or the OLE 
study (307/671). A total of 118 patients did not transition into another study: 43 (6.4%) patients 
completed the study (through week 28), and 75 (11.2%) patients withdrew from the study. A higher 
proportion of patients in the placebo group (15.6%) withdrew from the study than in the combined 
dupilumab groups (8.9%). The 2 most frequently reported reasons that patients withdrew from the 
study were “withdrawal by subject” (5.5%), which was reported for a higher proportion of patients in 
the placebo group than in the dupilumab groups, and AEs (1.6%), which were reported with similar 
frequency in the placebo and dupilumab groups. All other reasons were reported in ≤ 7 patients each in 
the study.

Study R668-AD-1416 (Solo2) 
A total of 962 patients were screened, of whom 708 were enrolled into the study and randomized (236 
patients in the placebo group, 233 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 239 patients in 
the 300 mg QW group).

The proportion of patients who withdrew from study treatment was higher in the placebo group 
(19.5% [46/236]) than in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (5.6% [13/233]) and dupilumab 300 mg 
QW group (7.5% [18/239]). The 3 most frequently cited reasons for withdrawal from study treatment, 
which were reported for a greater proportion of placebo patients than dupilumab patients, were lack of 
efficacy (3.0% [21/708]), AEs (2.8% [20/708]), and “other” (3.5% [25/708]). The only other reason 
for withdrawal from study treatment (protocol violation) was reported for <2% of all patients. 
A total of 630 of the 708 patients transitioned into either the maintenance study (229/708) or the OLE 
study (401/708). A total of 78 patients did not transition into another study: 16 (2.3%) patients 
completed the study (through week 28), and 62 (8.8%) patients withdrew from the study. A similar 
proportion of patients withdrew from the study in the placebo (9.7%) and combined dupilumab groups 
(8.3%). The 2 most frequently reported reasons that patients withdrew from the study were 
“withdrawal by subject” (3.2%) and lost to follow-up (2.0%), which were reported with similar 
frequency in the placebo and dupilumab groups. All other reasons were reported in ≤ 7 patients each in 
the study.

Conduct of the study 
There were 2 amendments to the study protocol of study R668-AD1334 and R668-AD-1416. 7.6% 
(17/224) of patients in the placebo group, 3.1% (7/224) of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group, and 7.2% (16/223) of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group had at least 1 major 
protocol deviation. The most common type of major protocol deviation was inadequate informed 
consent administration (4.0% of patients in the placebo group, 1.3% of patients in the dupilumab 300 
mg Q2W group, and 3.6% of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group). The incidence of each of 
the other major protocol deviation categories was low (<3% in any treatment group). 
The amendments as well the number and types of protocol deviations were considered acceptable and 
unlikely to have impacted the results of the study. 
Baseline data 
R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) 
58.1% of patients were men, and 41.9% were women. The mean weight, height, and BMI of all 
patients were 76.6±17.99 kg, 169.8±10.16 cm, and 26.5±5.59 kg/m2, and no differences were 
observed between treatment groups.  
Overall, 42.6% of all patients were enrolled in the Americas, 29.2% in the Western European region, 
17.9% in the Asia Pacific region, and 10.3% in the Eastern European region. 
The highest proportion of patients was enrolled in the United States (35.5%). No patients were 
enrolled in South America. 
Of the 671 patients randomized, 655 (97.6%) had an inadequate response to topical corticosteroid 
treatment, and 15 (2.2%) did not tolerate them: 5 patients had a history of significant skin atrophy, 4 
patients had hypersensitivity reactions, 5 patients had systemic effects, and 3 patients could not 
tolerate topical corticosteroid treatment for “other” reasons. 
R668-AD-1416 (Solo2) 
57.6% of the enrolled patients were men, and 42.4% were women. The mean weight, height, and BMI 
of all patients were 77.1±18.95 kg, 170.4±9.75 cm, and 26.5±5.85 kg/m2, respectively, and no 
differences were observed between treatment groups. 
48.9% of all patients were enrolled in the Americas, 23.0% in the Western European region, 16.1% in 
the Eastern European region, and 12.0% in the Asia Pacific region. The highest proportion of patients 
was enrolled in the United States (33.6%).  
Of the 708 patients randomized, 696 (98.3%) had an inadequate response to topical corticosteroid 
treatment, and 12 (1.7%) did not tolerate them: 7 patients had significant skin atrophy, 4 patients had 
hypersensitivity reactions, 2 patients had systemic effects, and 3 patients could not tolerate topical 
corticosteroid treatment for “other” reasons.

Baseline Disease Characteristics 
R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) 
The proportion of patients diagnosed with AD within specified age ranges was generally balanced 
between the placebo and dupilumab groups, with the majority (≥ 50%) of patients in the placebo and 
dupilumab groups diagnosed before the age of 5 years old. 
The mean duration of AD was similar between the placebo (29.5 years), dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (28.5 
years), and dupilumab 300 mg QW (27.9 years) groups. 
The mean EASI score was 34.5±14.47 for patients in the placebo group, 33.0±13.57 for patients in 
the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 33.2±13.98 for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
The mean IGA score was 3.5±0.5 for all treatment groups, and scores of 3 and 4 were evenly split. 
The mean peak weekly averaged pruritus NRS was 7.4±1.77 for patients in the placebo group, 
7.2±1.89 for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 7.2±2.06 for patients in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group, and most patients (>60%) had a baseline peak NRS ≥ 7. The majority 
of patients in each treatment group reported a Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status of poor (1) 
(>37%) or fair (2) (>33%). The proportion of patients who ranked their status as very good (4) or 
excellent (5) was <5% and <2%, respectively, in each group. Overall, 28.8% of patients had a history 
of prior systemic cyclosporine treatment. More than half of these patients had used cyclosporine for 
longer than 12 weeks (64.8%). The most common reason for discontinuing cyclosporine for all 
treatment groups was inadequate efficacy (46.6%). 
Overall, 63.4% of patients did not have a history of prior cyclosporine treatment. The most common 
stated reason for not using cyclosporine, apart from “other”, was that the risk of important side effects 
was generally too high (12.0%). 
R668-AD-1416 (Solo2) 
The majority (≥ 52%) of patients in the placebo and dupilumab groups diagnosed before the age of 5 
years old. More patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (10.3%) were diagnosed with AD 
between the age of 20 and 29 years old than the dupilumab 300 mg QW group (5.4%) or the placebo 
group (5.1%). 
The mean duration of AD was similar between the placebo (28.2 years), dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (27.2 
years), and dupilumab 300 mg QW (27.4 years) groups. 
The mean EASI score was 33.6±14.31 for patients in the placebo group, 31.8±13.08 for patients in 
the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 31.9±12.70 for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
The mean IGA score was 3.5±0.5 for all treatment groups, and scores of 3 and 4 were evenly split. 
The mean peak weekly averaged pruritus NRS was 7.5±1.85 for patients in the placebo group, 
7.6±1.60 for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 7.5±1.81 for patients in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group, and most patients (>69%) had a baseline peak NRS ≥ 7. The majority 
of patients in each treatment group reported a Patient Global Assessment of disease status of poor (1) 
(>40%) or fair (2) (>28%). The proportion of patients who ranked their status as very good (4) or 
excellent (5) was <5% and <2%, respectively, in each group. 
33.1% of patients had a history of prior cyclosporine treatment. Approximately half of these patients 
had used cyclosporine for longer than 12 weeks (51.7%). The most common reason for discontinuing 
cyclosporine for all treatment groups was inadequate efficacy (43.2%). Overall, 58.1% of patients did 
not have a history of prior cyclosporine treatment. The most common stated reason for not using 
cyclosporine was that the risk of important side effects was generally too high (12.4%). 
Medical history

R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) 
All patients had at least 1 medical history finding using the general questionnaire. ≥ 10% of patients in 
any treatment group were Dermatitis Atopic, Asthma, Rhinitis Allergic, Seasonal Allergy, Food Allergy, 
Allergy to Animal, House Dust Allergy, Conjunctivitis Allergic, Depression, and Hypertension were 
reported. Based on the specific atopic disease questionnaire, the proportion of patients with a family 
history of atopic/allergic conditions was similar between treatment groups.  
The proportion of patients with a family history of atopic/allergic conditions was similar between 
treatment groups. The most common atopic/allergic condition in patient family history was AD (40.5% 
in the placebo group, 46.7% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 38.5% in the dupilumab 300 
mg QW group). 
All patients had a current history of AD (100%). The next most common (≥ 50% of all patients) 
atopic/allergic condition was other allergies (59.5%). The proportion of patients with a current history 
of atopic/allergic conditions was similar between treatment groups for each condition.  
Less than 10% of patients in any treatment group had a currently resolved atopic/allergic condition. 
The most common currently resolved atopic/allergic condition was asthma, which was reported for 8.6 
% of patients in the placebo group, 9.6% of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 6.9% 
of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. 
25.5% of all patients indicated a current history of allergic conjunctivitis. 
R668-AD-1416 (Solo2) 
All but 1 patient in the placebo group had at least 1 medical history finding using the general 
questionnaire with ≥ 10% of patients in any treatment group reporting Dermatitis Atopic, Asthma, 
Rhinitis Allergic, Food Allergy, Seasonal Allergy, Conjunctivitis Allergic, Depression, and Hypertension. 
The proportion of patients with a family history of atopic/allergic conditions was similar between 
treatment groups. The most common atopic/allergic condition in patient family history was AD (38.0% 
in the placebo group, 41.5% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 41.4% in the dupilumab 300 
mg QW group).  
99.6% had a current history of AD, all patients randomized meeting the eligibility criteria for AD 
duration and severity. The proportion of patients with a current history of atopic/allergic conditions was 
similar between treatment groups for each condition.  
27.3% of all patients indicated a current history of allergic conjunctivitis. The most common currently 
resolved atopic/allergic condition was asthma, which was reported for a lower proportion of patients in 
the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (3.8%) than the dupilumab 300 mg QW (7.6%) and placebo 
(7.7%) groups. 
Numbers analysed 
In Solo1, 671 patients randomized, 669 were included in the SAF, and 671 patients were included in 
the FAS. Patients in the SAF were analysed as treated. A total of 25 randomized patients were 
excluded from the PPS because of major violations of efficacy-related entry criteria or a closed site or 
because they received <80% or >120% of scheduled doses or were randomized but not treated. 
In Solo2, 708 patients were randomized. 707 were included in the SAF, and 708 patients were included 
in the FAS. Patients in the SAF were analysed as treated. A total of 28 randomized patients were 
excluded from the PPS because they received <80% or >120% of scheduled doses or were

randomized but not treated or because of major violations of efficacy-related entry criteria or 
potentially unreliable data because of site closure due to GCP violations. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Study R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) 
The co-primary endpoints show significant higher response rates of dupilumab 300 mg QW and Q2W 
compared to placebo. The proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 
points at week 16 was significantly higher in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (37.9%) and dupilumab 300 
mg QW (37.2%) groups than the placebo group (10.3%). 
•  Proportion of Patients with IGA 0 or 1 and a Reduction from Baseline of ≥ 2 Points at 
Week 16; R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) 
51.3% of patients achieved an EASI-75 at week 16 in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, followed by 52.5% 
in the dupilumab 300 mg QW and 14.7% in the placebo group. 
The key secondary endpoints also show a higher efficacy in both dupilumab groups compared to 
placebo.

• 
The proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥ 4 points from baseline in weekly average 
of peak daily pruritus NRS score at week 16 was significantly higher in the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W (40.8%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW (40.3%) groups than the placebo group (12.3%).  
• 
The proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥ 3 points from baseline in weekly average 
of peak daily pruritus NRS score at week 16 was significantly higher in the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W (46.8%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW (51.7%) groups than the placebo group (17.2%).  
•  A significant decrease in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score from baseline to 
week 16 was observed in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (least squares [LS] mean [SE] vs 
baseline, -51.0% [2.50%]) and dupilumab 300 mg QW group (LS mean [SE] vs baseline, -
48.9% [2.60%]) compared with the placebo group (LS mean [SE] vs baseline, -26.1% 
[3.02%]).  
The proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥ 4 points from baseline in weekly average 
• 
of peak daily pruritus NRS score at week 4 was significantly higher in the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W (16.0%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW (23.4%) groups than the placebo group (6.1%). 
R668-AD-1416 (Solo2) 
The proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥ 2 points at week 16 was 
significantly higher in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (36.1%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW (36.4%) 
groups than the placebo group (8.5%).  
Proportion of Patients Achieving IGA 0 to 1 and a Reduction of ≥ 2 Points from Baseline at Week 16, 
Patient Considered Non-Responder after Rescue Treatment Use – FAS 
44.2% of patients achieved an EASI-75 at week 16 in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, followed by 48.1% 
in the dupilumab 300 mg QW and 11.9% in the placebo group.

The key secondary endpoints also show a higher efficacy in both dupilumab groups compared to 
placebo. 
•  36.0% of patients achieved a reduction of ≥ 4 points from baseline in weekly average of peak 
• 
• 
daily pruritus NRS score at week 16 in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, followed by 39.0% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW and 9.5% in the placebo group.  
The proportion of patients achieving a reduction of ≥ 3 points from baseline in weekly average 
of peak daily pruritus NRS score at week 16 was also higher in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
(50.6%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW (49.1%) groups than the placebo group (12.8%).  
The observed decrease in weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS score from baseline to 
week 16 was higher in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (LS mean [SE] vs baseline, -44.3% 
[2.28%]) and dupilumab 300 mg QW group (least squares [LS] mean [SE] vs baseline, -48.3% 
[2.35%]) compared with the placebo group (LS mean [SE] vs baseline, -15.4% [2.98%]).  
•  22.7% of patients achieved a reduction of ≥ 4 points from baseline in weekly average of peak 
daily pruritus NRS score at week 4 in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, 27.6% dupilumab 300 mg 
QW (27.6%) and 6.3% in the placebo group. 
Ancillary analyses 
Anti-Drug Antibody Analysis 
R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) 
 A higher proportion of patients with treatment-emergent responses in the ADA assay was observed in 
the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (6.8% [15/222]) and dupilumab 300 mg QW (2.9% [6/206]) group than 
the placebo group (1.0% [2/209]). 
Persistent ADA assay responses were observed for 1 patient each in the dupilumab treatment groups. 
The remaining patients had an indeterminate response in the assay (with a positive result in the ADA 
assay at only the last time point analysed): 12 (5.4%) patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 
5 (2.4%) patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, and 2 (1.0%) patients in the placebo group. 
R668-AD-1416 (Solo2) 
A slightly higher proportion of patients with treatment-emergent ADA assay responses was observed in 
the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (8.0% [18/225]) compared to the placebo (1.8% [4/218]) and 
dupilumab 300 mg QW (2.7% [6/223]) groups.

The data from the identical 2 pivotal phase 3 studies R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) and R668-AD-1416 
(Solo2) were pooled. The results show superiority of both dupilumab doses compared to placebo. The 
difference between both dosing regimens is very small.

Of special interest are the three subsets of patients with various history of ciclosporin therapy defined 
at baseline. Subset 1 included patients who showed an inadequate efficacy response to oral ciclosporin. 
Subset 2 included patients who showed an inadequate efficacy response or were intolerant to oral 
ciclosporin. Subset 3 included all patients in subset 2 plus patients who did not receive prior oral 
ciclosporin treatment because ciclosporin was contraindicated or otherwise medically inadvisable. The 
analyses of 3 the subsets indicated that these patients had slight more severe AD (e.g., mean baseline 
EASI score of approximately 36 in patients in subset 3 vs approximately 32 in patients not in subset 3 
of Efficacy Pool 1). Nevertheless, both dupilumab dose regimens consistently resulted in clinically 
meaningful improvements in signs and symptoms of AD across all 3 patient subsets.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Use of dupilumab in elderly was quite limited as AD mainly affects younger patients.

Supportive studies 
R668-AD-0914 and R668-AD-1026 were phase 1b, 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose studies conducted to assess the safety and 
PK profile of SC treatment with dupilumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Exploratory 
objectives in both studies included an assessment of the clinical effect of dupilumab. In both studies, 
the percent decrease in EASI score over the treatment period was greater in the dupilumab groups 
than in the placebo group, with the greatest decrease seen in the 300 mg group. 
R668-AD-1121 was a phase 2a, 11-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
study to assess the safety and efficacy (exploratory) of SC dupilumab administered concomitantly with 
TCS in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Exploratory efficacy assessments included EASI, 
IGA of AD severity, pruritus NRS, and SCORAD. Higher decreases from baseline in IGA, EASI, pruritus 
NRS, and SCORAD scores were observed in the dupilumab + TCS group than the placebo + TCS group. 
R668-AD-1117 was a phase 2a, 28-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
proof-of-concept study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of SC 
dupilumab treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. The primary efficacy endpoint was the 
mean percent reduction in EASI score from baseline to week 12 and was statistically significantly larger 
in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group. Results from the secondary efficacy analyses also 
demonstrated a greater reduction in AD severity in the dupilumab group than the placebo group. 
R668-AD-1307 was a phase 2, 32-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
study to assess the efficacy, safety, concentration of functional dupilumab in serum over time, and 
immunogenicity of SC dupilumab treatment in adults with moderate-to-severe AD that could not be 
adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment was medically 
inadvisable. 
R668-AD-1314 was a phase 2, 32-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
study conducted in the USA to assess T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent immunization 
responses, respectively, to tetanus toxoid adsorbed Adacel® (Tdap) and Menomune (meningococcal 
polysaccrahide) vaccinations in adults with moderate-to-severe AD, who were treated with SC 
dupilumab. Improvements were seen for absolute and percent changes in peak pruritus NRS, BSA 
involvement with AD, GISS and POEM scores from baseline to week 16, in the proportions of patients 
achieving IGA scores of 0 or 1, IGA score reductions ≥ 2 and patients achieving 50% and 75% 
reductions in EASI scores at week 16. 
R668-AD-1225 is a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, extension study to assess the long-term safety 
and efficacy of repeat doses of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD.  
This study is currently ongoing. At the time of data cut-off, no patients had completed treatment or 
had completed the study. At week 16 37.8% and at week 52 56.0% had an IGA score of 0 or 1, 
respectively (at baseline 4.6%). At week 16 and week 52, 75.0% and 87.1% of patients achieved 
EASI-75 relative to baseline of the parent study. 
R668-AD-1424 (Café Study) 
This was a 32-week phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to 
confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dupilumab administered in adults with severe Atopic 
Dermatitis for whom CSA had either not demonstrated adequate efficacy, had unacceptable side

effects or for whom initiating CSA was not medically advisable. The results of this study were 
requested due to the patient population of this study and introduction of final manufacturing process.  
The primary endpoint EASI 75 at week 16 was statistically significantly higher in the treated patients 
versus placebo. The many secondary endpoints which included IGA 0-1 response, PRURITIS, SCORAD, 
POEM and DLQI were statistically significantly better with dupilumab therapy. Onset of action was 
rapid, with divergence between dupilumab + TCS and placebo + TCS apparent as early as week 2 for 
many endpoints. Multiple sensitivity analyses using all observed data confirmed the results of the 
primary analysis, demonstrating that these outcomes were not driven by the analytic method of 
categorizing patients who used rescue treatment as non-responders, even though rescue was more 
common in the placebo + TCS group.

R668-AD-1415 (SOLO-CONTINUE Study) 
R668-AD-1415 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling only the 
subset of patients who achieved high-level clinical response [IGA(0,1) or EASI-75) after 16-week 
treatment in one of the initial-treatment (parent) studies (SOLO 1 R668-AD-1334 and SOLO 2 R668-
AD-1416). SOLO-CONTINUE compared the ability of increased dosing intervals to maintain the high 
level of response achieved after 166 weeks of dupilumab mono-therapy in the SOLO studies.   
SOLOC-CONTINUE consisted of a 36-week treatment period, during which patients received dupilumab 
300 mg QW, Q2W, Q4W, Q8W, or placebo from day 1 (ie, week 16 in the parent studies), and a 12-
week follow-up period. The co-primary endpoints were i,  the mean change between baseline and week 
36 in percent change in EASI Score from parent study baseline, and ii, percent of patients with EASI-
75 at week 36 for patients with EASI-75 at baseline.  Patients who continued on the same dose 
regimen received in the SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies (300 mg Q2W or 300 mg QW) showed the optimal 
effect in maintaining clinical response while efficacy for other dose regimens diminished in a dose-
dependent manner. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A total of over 2500 patients with AD contributed data for efficacy analysis, including patients 
randomized in the pivotal phase 3 studies. The phase 3 development program of dupilumab in patients 
with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis consists of 3 pivotal studies with 2 replicate 16 weeks 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 65/100 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
monotherapy studies (SOLO 1 R668-AD-1334 and SOLO 2 R688-AD-1416) and a 52-week long-term 
treatment study of dupilumab with concomitant use of topical medications (CHRONOS R668-AD-1224). 
Two different subcutaneous (SC) dupilumab dosing regimens were evaluated in the phase 3 studies, 
300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW, each with a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1. These doses were 
selected based on the results of the phase 2b dose ranging study (R668-AD-1021) with the 300 mg 
QW and 300 mg Q2W regimens demonstrating the highest efficacy. 
Study R668-AD-1224 (Chronos) consisted of a 35 days long screening phase, including wash out of 
treatments for AD, a 52-week treatment phase and a 12 week follow up period. At baseline 740 
patients were randomized in a 3:1:3 ratio to receive dupilumab 300 mg SC QW or Q2W, following the 
loading dose on day 1, or matching placebo. All patients also received TCS using a standardized 
predefined regimen. Randomization was stratified by baseline disease severity and by region. The end 
of treatment period visit occurred at week 52, 1 week after the last dose of study drug. Follow-up 
visits occurred week 64 (EOS). 
Dupilumab as monotherapy was studied in the pivotal 16-week studies R668-AD-1334 (SOLO 1) and 
R668-AD-1416 (SOLO 2). The design of both studies was identical. The studies consisted of a 35 day 
screening phase, a 16 week treatment phase and a 12 week safety follow up. In R668-AD-1334 671 
patients and in R668-AD-1416 708 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive SC 300 mg 
dupilumab QW, 300 mg dupilumab Q2W (each with the loading dose of 600 mg) or matching placebo. 
The design of the studies is considered adequate to assess short term efficacy. 
The eligibility criteria were adequate for the inclusion of patients with moderate to severe atopic 
dermatitis and comparable across the clinical studies with little modifications for study R669-AD-1224 
(Chronos) pertaining to patients being able to safely use TCS, due to the design of the study. The 
demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar among the treatment groups across the 
studies and the mean baseline values for all AD assessments were consistent with moderate-to-severe 
AD. No meaningful imbalances were identified.  
Patients were required either to have a documented recent history (within 6 months before the 
screening visit) of an inadequate response to treatment with topical medications, or deemed not to be 
appropriate candidates for such topical therapies (e.g., because of important potential side effects from 
TCS).  
In the monotherapy studies, patients could have received rescue treatment with an otherwise 
prohibited medication for treatment of intolerable AD symptoms during the study. In both studies, the 
proportion of patients who required rescue treatment in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group was similar 
to the 300 mg QW group (15-23% for dupilumab versus 51-52% placebo). The most commonly used 
rescue medications in both monotherapy studies were topical corticosteroids.  A smaller proportion of 
patients were rescued with systemic medications than topical medications. 
The co-primary endpoints were proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 and IGA 0 or1 and a 
reduction of ≥ 2 points at week 16. This is considered adequate to evaluate improvement in atopic 
dermatitis. Key secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with improvement (reduction ≥ 4 
points or ≥ 3 points) of weekly average of peak daily pruritus NRS from baseline to week 2, 4, 16, and 
the percent change from baseline to week 16.  The endpoints were similar for all three pivotal studies.  
Study R668-AD-1424 was a supplementary 32-week phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled, parallel group study to confirm the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dupilumab  in a 
specific sub set of adults with severe Atopic Dermatitis for whom CSA had either not demonstrated 
adequate efficacy, or had unacceptable side effects, or for whom initiating CSA was not medically 
advisable.

The report is based on the results of the primary analysis of efficacy, which included data up to the 
cut-off date of 5 January 2017. A total of 325 patients were enrolled and randomized 1:1:1 to receive 
placebo, dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS, or dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS for 16 weeks (108 patients 
in the placebo + TCS group, 107 patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group, and 110 
patients in the 300 mg QW + TCS group). Patients selected in this study were males and females of 18 
years of age or older with severe AD (according to American Academy of Dermatology Consensus 
Criteria [Eichenfield 2014] with EASI score ≥ 20, IGA score ≥ 3 and BSA ≥10%), whose disease could 
not be adequately controlled with TCS, who were not adequately controlled with or were intolerant to 
oral CSA, or for whom CSA treatment was deemed not medically advisable by a physician. 
Study R668-AD-1415 was a study conducted in a subset of patients who achieved high-level clinical 
response (IGA(0,1) or EASI-75) after 16-week treatment in one of the initial-treatment (parent) 
studies (SOLO 1 R668-AD-1334 and SOLO 2 R668-AD-1416). Its purpose was  to assess efficacy and 
safety of continuation of the dupilumab dose regimens (300 mg Q2W or QW) administered in the initial 
treatment studies compared with dose frequency reductions (to Q4W or Q8W) and dose withdrawal 
(discontinue dupilumab to receive placebo). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A serial gatekeeping procedure with alpha split between the 2 dose regimens was used to test the 
primary and key secondary endpoints while controlling for multiplicity in each of the phase 3 studies. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were met in all phase 3 studies and show a statistically significant 
higher efficacy (p<0.0001) for both dupilumab doses compared to placebo in combination with TCS or 
as monotherapy. Hierarchical testing was applied to the key and other secondary endpoints at a 2-
sided significance level of 0.025 for the comparison between each dupilumab dose regimen and 
placebo. 
The Co-Primary Endpoints of study R668-AD-1224 show a significant higher effect of dupilumab 300 
mg QW and Q2W each in combination with TCS on the severity of AD compared to placebo + TCS. The 
Secondary efficacy Endpoints support the effects seen in the Co-Primary Endpoints.  The difference in 
clinical efficacy was small between both dupilumab doses.  
In the 2 replicate 16-week studies R668-AD-1334 (Solo1) and -1416 (Solo2) both dupilumab dosing 
regimens show superiority to placebo in the key efficacy measurements. The secondary efficacy 
endpoints support the effects seen in the Co-Primary Endpoints and show a significant reduction in the 
Weekly Average of Peak Daily Pruritus NRS at several timepoints. Additionally the high amount of other 
efficacy endpoints that were assessed support the favourable efficacy of dupilumab compared to 
placebo. 
The data from the identical 2 pivotal phase 3 studies were pooled in Efficacy Pool1. The analyses show 
the superiority of both dupilumab doses to placebo with respect to the co-primary and key secondary 
endpoints. 
Additionally pooled subgroup analyses were performed on the integrated efficacy dataset of Efficacy 
Pool 1.  Of special interest is the Ciclosporin subgroup analysis. 3 subsets of patients for whom 
treatment with oral Ciclosporin was medically inadvisable show that both dupilumab dose regimens 
resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in signs and symptoms of AD across all 3 patient 
subsets in Efficacy Pool 1, with similar findings observed in R668-AD-1224. 
The trials were not powered to detect differences between the active arms however no difference in 
efficacy can be seen between dupilumab given Q2W or QW which is similar to the monotherapy trials. 
It can also be seen in the week 16 data that the IGA response is slightly higher with the combination of 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 67/100 
 
  
 
dupilumab+ TCS VS dupilumab alone, however the placebo response is higher in study AD 1224 as 
patients were on TCS, but the differences from placebo are similar, therefore the effects are additive 
only. 
For both dose regimens in the three studies, the difference in the proportion of patients who met the 
endpoint EASI 75 at week 16 compared to placebo was clinically meaningful and statistically significant 
(P<0.0001). The differences in the proportion of patients who met the endpoint compared to placebo 
and the associated 95% CIs suggested there was no meaningful difference in the response rate of the 
300 mg QW regimen over the 300 mg Q2W regimen in either study. 
Supportive analysis using data from the PPS yielded comparable results to the FAS for both studies 
and supported the same conclusions as those generated from the FAS. Sensitivity analyses showed 
that the results of the primary efficacy endpoint were not driven by the method of handling missing 
data. In both studies, the results of all pre-specified sensitivity analyses were consistent with the 
primary analysis. 
Inclusion of other secondary efficacy endpoints allowed an assessment of different perspectives of the 
treatment response. Analysis of these endpoints at week 16 showed that dupilumab monotherapy and 
with TCS resulted in statistically significantly larger reductions from baseline in EASI, SCORAD, BSA 
involvement with AD, and GISS cumulative score compared to placebo. These findings provide further 
evidence for improvements in both objective and subjective assessments of AD in dupilumab-treated 
patients. 
Further, dupilumab monotherapy or in combination with TCS resulted in statistically significantly 
greater reductions from baseline compared to placebo for POEM, DLQI and HADS, indicating 
improvements in patient-reported symptoms, HRQL, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. 
Dupilumab demonstrated a consistent effect for the co primary endpoints on the proportion of patients 
who achieved both IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥ 2 points at week 16 across all 
subgroups assessed and for EASI 75 response including age, weight, race, baseline disease severity, 
and previous use of systemic medications for AD, as shown by treatment-by-subgroup interaction 
testing. 
Longer term efficacy was examined in study R688-AD-1224. Statistically significant results are seen in 
IGA response 0 or 1 with continued treatment at 52 weeks in patients who achieved an IGA 0 or 1 at 
16 weeks in both regimens. The proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 52 was significantly 
higher in both dupilumab groups. 
In Study R668-AD-1424 (Café Study) including patients with a documented history of intolerance or 
inadequate response to previous treatment with CSA, or for whom treatment with CSA is medically 
inadvisable, both dose regimens of dupilumab + TCS significantly improved the extent and severity of 
AD. The overall baseline disease and previous therapy used were similar between the groups. Most 
patients were White (96.3%), male (61.2%) and the mean weight, height, and BMI of all patients were 
75.8 (±16.96) kg, 172.5 (±10.01) cm, and 25.3 (±4.63) kg/m2. 
The primary endpoint EASI 75 at week 16 was statistically significantly higher in the treated patients 
versus placebo. The many secondary endpoints which included IGA 0-1 response, PRURITIS, SCORAD, 
POEM and DLQI were statistically significantly better with dupilumab therapy. Onset of action was 
rapid, with divergence between dupilumab + TCS and placebo + TCS apparent as early as week 2 for 
many endpoints. The study was adequately powered for the primary analysis. 
Multiple sensitivity analyses using all observed data confirmed the results of the primary analysis, 
demonstrating that these outcomes were not driven by the analytic method of categorizing patients 
who used rescue treatment as non-responders, even though rescue was more common in the placebo

+ TCS group. The applicant stated that the PPS analysis was not conducted as it was not different form 
the FAS. 
Exposure in terms of the number of doses of study treatment and treatment duration was similar in 
the Café study compared to Study Drug Exposure for Subset 3 Patients in the Pooled R668-AD-1334 
and R668-AD-1416 analysis (ref table 77 of summary of Clinical safety) 
Of note, the commercial formulation was introduced in June 2016.This study was ongoing between 28 
Jan 2016 and 28 Dec 2016. Of the 325 patients enrolled in the study, 48 patients received the 
previous clinical formulation only and 27 patients received the commercial formulation only.  
The duration of the study was rather short as the endpoints measured efficacy at 16 weeks however 
the trial adds additional support for use in patients with AD who cannot tolerate or do not respond to 
CsA therapy and confirms results from the CAFÉ -like population subset in the CHRONOS study (R668-
AD-1224) that demonstrated efficacy in this patient population at both Weeks 16 and 52. 
In study R668-AD-1415 (SOLO-CONTINUE), a study conducted in a subset of patients who achieved 
high-level clinical response (IGA(0,1) or EASI-75) after 16-week treatment in one of the initial-
treatment (parent) studies (SOLO 1 R668-AD-1334 and SOLO 2 R668-AD-1416), patients who 
continued on the same dose regimen received in the SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies (300 mg Q2W or 300 
mg QW) showed the optimal effect in maintaining clinical response while efficacy for other dose 
regimens diminished in a dose-dependent manner. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The superiority to placebo was demonstrated for both dupilumab doses as monotherapy or in 
combination with TCS in AD patients who are insufficiently controlled with topical therapies alone. No 
significant additional benefit was observed with weekly dosing versus Q2W dosing (300 mg s.c) in the 
overall population. Therefore, the CHMP endorsed the proposed dose of 300 mg every other week 
(Q2W) with a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data from 17 studies (data cut-off date of 31 May 2016) was evaluated in this submission. 2526 
AD patients were exposed to dupilumab in 11 studies (10 placebo-controlled studies and 1 OLE study, 
excluding healthy volunteers) with a treatment period of ≥4 weeks. The duration of exposure for adult 
patients with AD who have been treated with dupilumab is as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
at least 1 year (364 days) for 739 patients (total duration any dupilumab dose): 
645  patients with 300 mg weekly (QW) and 58 patients with 300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
at least 1.5 years (546 days) for 309 patients (total duration any dupilumab dose): 91 patients 
with 300 mg QW 
at least 2 years (728 days) for 160 patients (total duration any dupilumab dose) 
The safety data from these studies have been integrated into 3 pools, the Primary Safety Pool, the 
Supportive Safety Pool, and the Exposure Pool. The first 2 pools provide a comprehensive evaluation of 
dupilumab as monotherapy. The Exposure Pool provides a comprehensive evaluation of the overall 
extent of exposure to dupilumab in patients with AD.

Adverse events 
Primary Safety Pool - R668-AD-1334, R668-AD-1416, and R668-AD-1021 (16-Week 
Monotherapy) 
Approximately 69% of patients experienced a TEAE. The proportion of patients who experienced a 
TEAE during the 16-week treatment period was similar between the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 300 
mg QW groups and the placebo group. The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent SAEs was 
lower in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW groups than in the placebo group (2.5% and 
2.1% versus 5.0%).  
The proportion of patients with severe TEAEs was lower in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg 
QW groups than in the placebo group (3.8% and 4.1% versus 8.3%).

R668-AD-1224 (Dupilumab plus Concomitant TCS): 16-Week Data 
For the purpose of comparison with 16-week monotherapy data, 16-week treatment data from the 
long-term study R668-AD-1224 (dupilumab+ TCS) were evaluated. Overall, the TEAE results during 
the first 16 weeks of treatment in the R668-AD-1224 study were consistent with those observed for 
the 16-week treatment period in the Primary Safety Pool. The proportion of patients who had 
treatment-emergent SAEs was similar among the Q2W+TCS (0.9%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW+TCS 
(2.5%) groups. A higher proportion of patients in the placebo + TCS group had TEAEs leading to 
permanent discontinuation of study drug (4.8%) than the dupilumab 300 mg. 
The trend in TEAEs were generally the same as observed for the monotherapy Primary Safety Pool, 
with the notable exception of a higher incidence of Conjunctivitis Allergic across all treatment groups, 
including placebo, compared to the incidence in the monotherapy population. There was also a lower 
incidence of Dermatitis Atopic across all treatment groups compared to the incidence in the 
monotherapy Primary Safety Pool. 
R668-AD-1224 (Dupilumab plus Concomitant TCS): 52-Week Data 
The TEAE results for the 52-week treatment period were generally similar to the results observed for 
the 16-week treatment period except for a higher crude (unadjusted) incidence of AEs. The overall 
pattern of TEAEs during the 52-week treatment period in the R668-AD-1224 study was consistent with 
that observed for the first 16-weeks of treatment. A higher proportion of patients in the placebo + TCS 
group had treatment-emergent SAEs (5.1%) compared to the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS (3.6%)

and dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS (2.9%) groups, and TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of 
study drug (7.6%) compared to the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS (1.8%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW 
+ TCS (2.9%) groups. 
There was no clear evidence of an overall dose dependent increase in TEAEs across the Dupilumab 
300mg Q2W and QW doses except for injection site reaction (ISR). This was apparent across all 
analyses. At week 52 there was a trend toward a higher incidence of TEAE in the Q2W treated group 
for TEAEs herpes simplex, blepharitis and dry eye. In the QW dose group oral herpes conjunctivitis 
bacterial, conjunctivitis allergic, blepharitis and injection site reaction occurred more commonly 
compared with the QW2 regime.

Treatment-Emergent Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TEAE) 
Primary Safety Pool - R668-AD-1334, R668-AD-1416 and R668-AD-1021 (16-Week 
Monotherapy) 
The proportion of patients with treatment-related TEAEs (relatedness assessed by the investigator) 
during the 16-week treatment period was higher for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (27.6% 
[146/529]) and dupilumab 300 mg QW (30.5% [158/518]) groups than for patients in the placebo 
group (20.1% [104/517]). 
The General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions SOC had the highest proportion of patients 
with treatment-related TEAEs. A higher proportion of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (12.5% 
[66/529]) and dupilumab 300 mg QW (15.1% [78/518]) groups reported TEAEs from this SOC 
compared to patients in the placebo group (6.8% [35/517]). A single PT, ISR, was responsible for this 
increased incidence in all treatment groups, as expected for an injectable biologic medicinal product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 73/100 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Infections and Infestations SOC had the second highest proportion of patients with treatment-
related TEAEs. A similar proportion of patients in the dupilumab groups and the placebo group reported 
these TEAEs. 
The most common treatment-related TEAEs (≥1% in any treatment group) that occurred with a higher 
frequency in either dupilumab treatment groups (≥1% higher in either dupilumab treatment groups) 
than the placebo group were as follows: 
• 
Injection Site Reaction: The incidence was higher in both dupilumab groups compared to 
placebo, with a higher incidence in the 300 mg QW group. These treatment-related TEAEs 
accounted for the majority of all reported ISR. 
•  Headache: 2.5% (13/529) in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 2.5% (13/518) in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group, and 1.4% (7/517) in the placebo group. 
•  Conjunctivitis (Infections and Infestations SOC): 1.3% (7/529) in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W 
group and 1.5% (8/518) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, and 0% in the placebo group. 
Eosinophilia: 1.3% (7/529) in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 0.2% (1/518) in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW group, and 0.2% (1/517) in the placebo group.  
• 
The treatment-related TEAE (≥1% in any treatment group) that occurred with a higher frequency in 
the placebo group was dermatitis atopic (typically reported as worsening or exacerbation): 3.2% 
(17/529) in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 1.9% (10/5118) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group, 
and 4.3% (22/517) in the placebo group. 
In patients treated with dupilumab as monotherapy over 16 weeks, > 10% of participants reported  at 
least 1 event in Infections and infestations, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, General disorders 
and administration site conditions, Nervous system disorders SOCs. 
In the dupilumab groups the following TEAEs were the most commonly reported: injection site reaction 
(ISR), Nasopharyngitis, Headache, Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, Conjunctivitis, Oral Herpes, 
Herpes Simplex, Diarrhoea, Conjunctivitis Allergic, Conjunctivitis Bacterial, Blepharitis, Dry Eye, 
Fatigue, Nausea, Arthralgia, Myalgia, Alopecia, Rash, Injection Site Erythema, Cough, Oropharyngeal 
Pain, Blood CPK Increased, Eosinophilia, Hypertension and Pain in Extremity. The majority of cases 
were mild to moderate in severity. 
In the Infections and infestation SOC the percentage of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE was 
similar across all treatment groups (dupilumab 300mg Q2W 33% dupilumab QW 34%: placebo 31%). 
Within the SOC there was some difference in reporting rates noted. There were higher rates of 
sinusitis, oral herpes, conjunctivitis bacterial, herpes simplex, URTI and nasopharyngitis in the 
dupilumab group compared with placebo. There was higher incidence of conjunctivitis and herpes 
simplex, oral herpes cases in the dupilumab treated groups in both the primary safety pool and the 
supportive safety pool. Folliculitis, impetigo and skin infections occurred more frequently in the placebo 
group. The majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity, resolved during the treatment 
period and did not lead to study medication discontinuation.   
In the eye disorders SOC there was an increased incidence of allergic conjunctivitis, blepharitis and dry 
eye in both the primary safety pool and the supportive safety pool. This was against a high background 
history of eye disorders (23% patients had a history of allergic conjunctivitis). The majority were mild 
to moderate in severity and resolved with treatment. However, 20% of cases had not resolved during 
the study period. There were no serious cases.

Number of Patients with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events ≥1% in any Treatment Group 
by Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term – 16-Week Treatment Period – Primary 
R668-AD-1224 (Dupilumab plus Concomitant TCS): 52-Week Data 
The results for the treatment-related TEAEs during the 52-week treatment period were generally 
similar to the results observed for the first 16-weeks of treatment described above. The trends in the 
SOCs and PTs with TEAEs were generally the same. 
Immunogenicity 
As with all monoclonal antibodies, dupilumab has the potential to elicit an ADA response. Accordingly, 
serum samples were collected in all dupilumab clinical studies for immunogenicity assessments using 
validated ADA assays. 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 75/100 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Immunogenicity assay results were reported as ADA positive or negative. Positive immunoreactivity 
results in the ADA assay were summarized according to the current ADA definitions as pre-existing, 
treatment-boosted, or treatment-emergent. Treatment-emergent responses were further characterized 
as persistent, indeterminate, or transient. In the phase 3 studies, samples that were positive in the 
ADA assay were further characterized for neutralizing activity. 
In all the studies of dupilumab in AD patients, which included studies conducted in patients treated 
with dupilumab for over 52 weeks, the proportion of patients with treatment-emergent positive 
response in the ADA assay was approximately 7%. 
Immunogenicity of dupilumab generally varied inversely with dupilumab dose regimen, with the 
incidence of treatment-emergent ADA-positive response observed to decrease with greater dupilumab 
doses in all studies. Most patients who had a positive response in the ADA assay had titers that were 
low (<1000). Some patients exhibited moderate titers (≥1,000 to ≤10,000), and only a few patients 
had high titer (>10,000). Of those patients with treatment-emergent positive response in the ADA 
assay, only a small proportion of patients were found to have a persistent ADA-positive response 
(<1% of all dupilumab-treated patients sampled in the Primary Safety Pool). Even among patients 
treated with dupilumab over a 52-week period, persistent treatment-emergent ADA-positive response 
was observed in <2% of patients. 
As the overall number of patients who experienced a treatment-emergent or treatment-boosted assay 
response was small, no clear conclusions can be drawn regarding the clinical relevance of any 
differences in the incidence of TEAEs between ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients. 
There were 2 patients with high ADA titer, one of whom had a Serum Sickness-Like Reaction and the 
other had Serum Sickness.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
There were 6 deaths that occurred in the dupilumab AD studies as of 31 May 2017 , none of which was 
assessed as related to study drug. There were 4 additional deaths that occurred in patients with known 
exposure to dupilumab in the asthma program, two of which were assessed as related to dupilumab. 
One of these occurred in a smoker who died from metastatic lung cancer and the other in a patient 
with history of chronic gastritis who died from adenocarcinoma of stomach.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Primary Safety Pool 
In the primary safety pool, 5% in the placebo group, 2.5% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 2.1% in 
the dupilumab 300 mg QW  groups had an SAE during the 16-week monotherapy treatment period. In 
the long term combination study (Dupilumab + TCS): 16-Week Data, 1.9% in the  placebo + TCS  
group , 2.7% in  the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group  and 1.3% for patients in the dupilumab 
300 mg QW + TCS reported SAEs. During the 52-week treatment period 5.1% in the placebo QW + 
TCS group ,3.6% for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS, and 2.9% in the dupilumab 300 
mg QW + TCS  group reported SAEs. 
The PTs for treatment-emergent SAEs reported for ≥2 patients in any treatment group in the 
monotherapy studies either occurred only in the placebo group (Sepsis, Suicide Ideation, and Acute 
Kidney Injury), or occurred at a higher frequency in the placebo group than in the dupilumab groups 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 76/100 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
(Dermatitis Atopic). All other SAEs occurred in 1 patient. In the Infections and Infestations SOC, the 
proportion of patients with a treatment-emergent SAE was 0.2% in the dupilumab Q2W treated group, 
0.8% in the dupilumab QW group  and was 1% in the  placebo group. There were no discernible trends 
at the SOC and PT levels for the remaining SAEs in the dupilumab treated populations. Three cases of 
myocardial infarction (two reported as acute) were reported in the dupilumab treatment groups in the 
monotherapy studies. The proportion of patients discontinuing from their study due to SAEs was 
slightly lower in the dupilumab group compared to placebo (dupilumab 300mg Q2W 0.8% dupilumab 
QW 0.4%: placebo 1.4%. 
In the long term combination study, the results for the SAEs for the first 16-weeks and 52 of treatment 
were generally similar to the results observed for the Primary Safety Pool. At week 52 in the Infections 
and Infestations SOC, the proportion of patients with an SAE was 0.9% in the  dupilumab 300mg Q2W 
+TCS treated group, 0 % in the dupilumab 300mg QW +TCS group  and 0.6% in the  placebo group. 
In the dupilumab +TCS group (combined) four cases of squamous cell carcinoma were reported. 
Laboratory findings 
The dupilumab groups, both as monotherapy and with concomitant TCS, showed a trend toward 
modestly greater mean decrease from baseline in platelets and neutrophils than did the placebo group 
from baseline to week 16 with a similar trend extending through week 52. The changes in these 2 
hematology parameters appeared to be due to patients with high values at baseline decreasing to 
normal, observed with dupilumab but not with placebo treatment. Of note, a proportion of patients had 
high baseline values in platelet and neutrophil counts and many of these patients shifted to normal 
values by the end of the treatment period. The incidences of Thrombocytopenia and Platelet Count 
Decreased TEAEs were low overall and there did not appear to be any clinical consequence of this 
modest decrease in platelet count. The modest decrease in neutrophil count was not associated with 
an increased incidence of Infections and Infestations. 
The dupilumab monotherapy groups had a transient increase from baseline in eosinophils, and the 
mean increase from baseline was modestly greater in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo group 
at all post-baseline assessments to week 16 with a similar trend extending through week 52. A high 
proportion of patients had high eosinophil levels at baseline, with more patients in the placebo group 
shifting to normal values by the end of treatment, compared with patients in the dupilumab groups. 
Lactate dehydrogenase levels clearly showed a progressive and greater decrease from baseline in the 
dupilumab treatment groups than in the placebo treatment group from baseline to week 16, with a 
similar trend extending through week 52. Consistent with this result, greater proportions of the 
dupilumab groups showed a shift in LDH levels from high to normal. Given the direct correlation 
between LDH levels with AD disease activity and severity reported from other studies, the greater 
decrease in LDH in the dupilumab group, compared with the placebo group, may be related to the 
greater efficacy of dupilumab in decreasing AD severity. The eDISH analyses found no evidence of 
drug-induced liver toxicity in any patient. 
Vital Signs 
There were no trends in mean or median changes and no differences in mean or median changes from 
baseline between the dupilumab and placebo groups in diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, or 
heart rate in any of the conducted studies. There were no clinically meaningful trends in mean and 
median change from baseline, shifts from baseline, and incidence of PCSVs in heart rate, QTcB, QTcF 
in the Primary and Supportive Safety Pools, as well as the R668-AD- 1224 and R668-AD-1225 studies.

Safety in special populations 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse events by Gender 
Primary Safety Pool - R668-AD-1334, R668-AD1416, and R668-AD-1021 (16-Week 
Monotherapy) 
During the treatment period, in the placebo group, male patients had a higher incidence of Dermatitis 
Atopic (exacerbation) than did females (34.6% [100/289] versus 25.4% [58/228]). This may be due 
to a higher proportion of males than females in the combined dupilumab group (~60% males versus 
~40% females). Females in both the placebo and dupilumab groups appeared to be more prone than 
males to having ISR, with the difference more pronounced in the dupilumab group patients (18.1% 
[75/415] females versus 7.6% [48/632] males, combined dupilumab). In both the placebo and 
dupilumab groups, female patients had a higher incidence of headache, with a greater difference seen 
in the dupilumab group patients (11.1% [46/415] versus 6.3% [40/632], combined dupilumab). 
R668-AD-1224 (Dupilumab plus Concomitant TCS): 52-Week Data 
The incidence of ISRs for the 52˗week period was higher in females than in males for the combined 
dupilumab + TCS group and the placebo + TCS. Similarly to results for the 16-week treatment period, 
the incidence of Headache was higher only in males in the dupilumab 300mg QW + TCS dose group 
(7.1% [18/253]) than in the placebo + TCS group (2.6% [5/193]). Conversely, in females, the 
incidence of Headache was lower in the combined dupilumab + TCS group (6.4% [11/172]) than in the 
placebo + TCS group (11.5% [14/122]). 
Consistent with results for the first 16 weeks, a higher incidence of Nasopharyngitis in the dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W + TCS group (23.8% [15/63]) than in the placebo + TCS group (18.7% [36/193]) was 
noted only in males. The incidence of Eye Pruritus was higher in females than in males in both the 
combined dupilumab + TCS group (7.0% [12/172] females versus 2.4% [6/253]) males and the 
placebo + TCS group (3.3% [4/122] females versus 0% [0/193] males). 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse events by Age 
Elderly Patients 
Of the 1777 patients treated with dupilumab ≥300 mg total monthly dose in the 6 placebo-controlled 
studies with a study treatment period of ≥12 weeks in Pool 3 and patients treated with dupilumab in 
CHRONOS R668-AD-1224, 71 patients were ≥65 years of age at study entry. 
Of the 1472 patients treated with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W or QW in the 4 placebo-controlled studies 
with a study treatment period of ≥16 weeks, a total of 67 were ≥65 years at study entry. Subgroup 
analysis by age (≥18 to <40; ≥40 to<65; ≥65) on the co-primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints showed no treatment-age group interaction for the dupilumab monotherapy as well as for 
dupilumab + TCS concomitant. Results of the subgroup analysis by age on TEAEs did not reveal any 
clinically meaningful differences for the age subgroups.  
Comparison was not made for patients in the >65 year age subgroup, as there were too few patients 
in to make meaningful comparisons with other age subgroups. 
Pediatric Patients 
Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.

Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Bodyweight 
Primary Safety Pool - R668-AD-1334, R668-AD-1416, and R668-AD-1021 (16-Week 
Monotherapy) 
Patients in the placebo group with <70 kg body weight at baseline had a higher incidence of Dermatitis 
Atopic (35.7% [74/207]) than patients with ≥70 kg to <100 kg (27.2% [69/254]) or with ≥100 kg 
(26.8% [15/56]) body weight; the incidence of Dermatitis Atopic decreased in the dupilumab groups, 
though it remained slightly higher in the 70 kg subgroup, compared with those of the other 2 baseline 
body weight. 
R668-AD-1224 (Dupilumab plus Concomitant TCS): 52-Week Data 
Results of comparison of frequency of TEAEs between patients with body weight of <70 kg and 
patients with body weight of ≥70 to <100 kg for the 52-week treatment period were consistent with 
results of the 16-week treatment period. 
Patients with Other Atopic Diseases 
The development of dupilumab for the treatment of asthma, nasal polyposis, and eosinophil 
esophagitis is ongoing, with 2 studies completed and 4 studies ongoing in the asthma program, 1 
study in nasal polyposis completed, and 1 study in eosinophil esophagitis ongoing. Safety data from 
the 2 completed studies in asthma, 1 ongoing open-label extension study in asthma as of the data 
cutoff of 31 January 2016, and the completed study in nasal polyposis revealed no new safety signal 
that is different from the AD program. It is noted that the higher incidence of conjunctivitis and Oral 
Herpes with dupilumab treatment in the AD program was not observed in data from the asthma and 
nasal polyposis programs. The SUSARs from the ongoing studies up through 31 May 2016 did not 
reveal any new safety pattern or signal. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women who planned to become pregnant or breastfeed during 
the study period were excluded from the studies. A review of cases reported in the pharmacovigilance 
database (covering all investigational indications) as of the data cutoff date of 27 April 2016 revealed a 
total of 23 pregnancies in patients treated with dupilumab and 17 pregnancies in partners of male 
patients exposed to dupilumab. The 23 pregnancies in study patients treated with dupilumab have led 
to 7 live births giving 8 healthy babies (1 birth with twins), 2 induced (elective) abortions, and 6 
spontaneous abortions, with 5 pregnancies ongoing and 3 pregnancies lost to follow-up. Of the 6 study 
patients with spontaneous abortion, 2 patients had 1 or more factors known to increase the risk of 
spontaneous abortion (elevated parathyroid hormone, clotting disorders, and a history of infertility). 
The 17 partner pregnancies of male study patients have led to 5 live births giving 5 healthy babies, 1 
induced (elective) abortion, and 2 spontaneous abortions, with 8 pregnancies ongoing and 1 lost to 
follow-up. 
Ciclosporin Subgroups 
Analysis of the safety of dupilumab in AD patients who are not adequately controlled with or were 
intolerant to oral ciclosporin, or for whom oral ciclosporin was not medically advisable (for conciseness 
referred to as the ciclosporin intolerant group) was compared with that of patients who did not meet 
these criteria.   
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 79/100 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of TEAEs was slightly higher in the ciclosporin intolerant subset than in the remainder of 
the patients for overall TEAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study 
drug, and treatment-emergent SAEs, but not for TEAEs assessed by the investigator as related to 
study treatment. Within the ciclosporin  intolerant subset, the TEAE incidences were lower in the 
combined dupilumab group than in the placebo group with for overall TEAEs, severe TEAEs, and 
treatment-emergent SAEs .In the ciclosporin intolerant subgroup 17.4% of dupilumab-treated patients 
compared with 44.8%  placebo-treated patients reported worsening of Atopic Dermatitis . Injection 
Site Reaction and Headache were higher for dupilumab (12.4% vs 5.7% vs and 8.0% vs 4.6%, 
respectively) than for placebo. 
In the R668-AD-1224 study, at week 16 dupilumab+TCS treated patients who were intolerant of 
ciclosporin had a higher incidence of TEAEs in the Eye Disorders SOC, which consisted largely of 
Conjunctivitis Allergic and Blepharitis.  The incidence was also higher in the combined dupilumab + 
TCS group than in the placebo + TCS group for both the Conjunctivitis Allergic and Blepharitis PTs over 
the 52-week duration of the study.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
AESIs were prospectively identified in the dupilumab clinical program except for the AESI of 
Conjunctivitis, which was identified following the analysis of the SOLO studies. The prospectively 
identified AESIs were considered based on the pharmacologic properties of dupilumab and its 
mechanism of action, conditions associated with or diagnosed in patients with AD, or the fact that 
dupilumab is a protein biologic that is administered SC. 
The following is a list of all the events included and analyzed as AESIs: 
•  Anaphylactic reactions 
•  Acute allergic reactions requiring treatment 
•  Mycosis fungoides or cutaneous T-cell dyscrasias 
•  Any severe infection 
•  Any infection requiring treatment with parenteral antibiotics 
•  Any infection requiring treatment with oral antibiotics/anti-viral/anti-fungal for longer than 2 
weeks 
•  Any clinical endoparasitosis 
•  Any opportunistic infection 
•  Severe ISRs lasting longer than 24 hours 
•  Suicidal behavior (suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, depression suicidal, suicide attempt and 
completed suicide)  
•  Conjunctivitis (post-hoc analysis) 
Primary Safety Pool - R668-AD-1334, R668-AD-1416, and R668-AD-1021 (16-Week 
Monotherapy) 
The proportion of patients who had at least 1 AESI during the 16-week treatment period was low 
across treatment groups (approximately 4.0%), and was lower for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W and 300 mg QW groups (approximately 2% and 1%) than the placebo group (approximately 
4%). The proportion of patients who had at least 1 serious AESI during the 16-week treatment period 
was low overall (approximately 1%), and was lower in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (0.2% [1/529]) 
and dupilumab 300 mg QW (0.4% [2/518]) groups than the placebo group (1.2% [6/517]).  
The proportion of patients with at least 1 AESI or serious AESI, and the profile of AESIs and serious 
AESIs during the entire study period was similar to that observed for the 16-week treatment period 
and for the follow-up period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 80/100 
 
  
 
 
 
The exposure-adjusted patient and event incidence of AESIs showed similar trends as the crude 
patient incidence of AESIs. The mean time to first occurrence of any AESI during the 16-week 
treatment period was similar between all treatment groups (range: 104.6 [±25.57] days in placebo 
group to 108.5 [±19.34] days in the 300 mg Q2W group. The HRs with 95% CI were 0.577 (0.282 - 
1.180) in dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and 0.246 (0.092 - 0.655) in the 300 mg QW groups. 
The cumulative incidence of any AESI during the 16-week treatment period was lower over time in the 
dupilumab treatment groups compared to the placebo group. 
Of the patients who reported any event of this conjunctivitis category, only 1 patient in the dupilumab 
300 mg QW group discontinued study treatment due to the event. Of the 103 conjunctivitis TEAEs 
reported during the treatment period in dupilumab-treated patients in the Primary Safety Pool, 78.6% 
of the events resolved or were resolving during the treatment period.

R668-AD-1224 (Dupilumab plus Concomitant TCS): 52-Week Data 
The overall AESI results for the 52-week treatment period were generally similar to the results 
observed for the 16-week treatment period described above, except for a higher overall rate of 
reporting of AESIs, consistent with the longer treatment period. The proportion of patients who had at 
least 1 AESI during the 52-week treatment period was lower for patients in the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W + TCS group (3.6%) and 300 mg QW + TCS group (2.5%) than the placebo + TCS group 
(7.0%). 
The trends in the individual AESIs were generally the same as observed for the first 16-week of 
treatment. There were no new safety signals for AESIs detected with LTT during the 52-week 
treatment period.

Acute allergic reactions and anaphylaxis 
In the primary safety pool acute allergic reactions requiring treatment occurred in 0.6% of the 
dupilumab 300mg Q2W group, 0.2% of the dupilumab QW group and 0.6% of the placebo group. A 
similar picture was seen in the supportive safety pool and the long-term safety data from the 
combination dupilumab +TCS study. A higher proportion of patients in the dupilumab Q2W group than 
the dupilumab QW group reported these reactions. Average time to onset was between 107-110 days 
across the treatment groups. Most events of Acute Allergic Reactions requiring treatment had clear 
precipitating agents responsible for the reactions. In the long term combination study at week 52 acute 
allergic reaction requiring treatment were reported in 0.3% (1/315) for placebo + TCS, and 0% for 
both dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS and 300 mg Q2W + TCS. 
A review of events of urticaria from the Safety Pools, as well as the R668-AD-1224 LTT and R668-AD-
1225 OLE studies indicated that incidence of these events was not increased with dupilumab 
treatment. No cases of anaphylactic reactions were identified in the primary safety pool or the LTT 
safety study (dupilumab +TCS). There was one case in the supportive safety pool and 3 cases in the 
OLE all attributable to food allergies. In the OLE study there was one case of systemic allergic reaction 
following four doses of study treatment that resulted in study drug discontinuation. 
There was no indication that dupilumab treatment increased the overall occurrence of acute allergic 
reactions requiring treatment or anaphylactic reactions. 
Mycosis Fungoides or Cutaneous T-Cell Dyscrasias 
No cases of mycosis fungoides were reported in the primary safety pool. In the long-term combination 
study at 52 week Mycosis fungoides or other forms of cutaneous T cell lymphoma was reported for 1 
patient (0.3%) on placebo + TCS, and 0 patients (0%) on either dupilumab group: 300 mg Q2W + 
TCS or  300 mg QW + TCS. 
However overall a total of four cases of mycosis fungoides were identified across the supportive safety 
pool and the long term combination dupilumab +TCS study R668-AD-1224 and the OLE study. Two 
cases occurred during treatment with dupilumab 300mg. One case occurred in the placebo group. One 
case was misdiagnosed. None of the cases were considered by the investigator to be related to study 
drug. 
Infection 
In the primary safety pool any severe infections were reported in 1.7% for placebo, 0.9% for 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, and 0.2% for dupilumab 300 mg QW. Any opportunistic infection were 
reported in 1% for placebo, 0.8% for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, and 0.4% for dupilumab 300 mg QW 
treated patients.  Infection requiring treatment with parenteral antibiotic was reported for 0.7% for 
placebo, 1% for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, and 1.9% for dupilumab 300 mg QW groups. No infection

requiring treatment with oral antibiotic/anti-viral/anti-fungal for longer than 2 weeks or cases of 
clinical endoparasitosis was reported for this safety population.  
In the long term combination therapy study at 52 weeks, infection requiring treatment with parenteral 
antibiotic were reported for 1.0% for placebo + TCS, 0.9% for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS, and 
1.3% for dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS groups . Infection requiring treatment with oral antibiotic/anti-
viral/anti-fungal for longer than 2 weeks was reported for  1.9% for placebo + TCS, 0.9% for 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W+ TCS, and 0.6% for dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS groups. Opportunistic 
infection was reported in 3.5% for placebo + TCS, 1.8% (2/110) for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS, 
and 0.3% for dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS groups.  Severe infection was reported for 1.6% for 
placebo + TCS, 0% for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS, and 0.3% for dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS 
treated patients.   Clinical endoparasitosis was reported in 0% for placebo + TCS, 0% for dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W + TCS, and 0.3% for dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS 
In all categories of infection AESI   the incidence of infection was very low and was generally higher in 
placebo group compared to the dupilumab treated population. The only opportunistic infections 
identified in the Primary Safety Pool  were  Herpes Viral Infections (Eczema Herpeticum and Herpes 
Zoster). The incidence of these opportunistic infections during the treatment period was either higher 
in the placebo group (Herpes Zoster) or similar between the dupilumab groups and the placebo group 
(Eczema Herpeticum). All opportunistic Herpes Viral Infections resolved by the end of the study In the 
long term combination study all the events were consistent with Herpes Viral Infections as described 
for the Primary and Supportive Safety Pools except for 1 event of Cytomegalovirus Infection reported 
in the placebo + TCS group. The incidence of Eczema Herpeticum was highest in the placebo group 
(1.9%).  
One case of Clinical Endoparasitosis (based on serology) was reported for 1 patient in the  dupilumab 
300 mg QW + TCS study: 16-Week Data analysis. Overall there was no evidence of increased serious 
infections in the dupilumab treated populations. 
In the R668-AD-1225 OLE study, the incidence of opportunistic infections was 1.7% , 0.4% for 
patients requiring i.v antibiotics, 0.9% for severe infection and 1% for infection requiring oral 
treatment >2 weeks 
Injection Site Reactions 
No TEAEs met the criteria for this AESI category (Severe ISR lasting longer than 24 hours in the 
Primary Safety Pool or the Supportive Safety Pool or the R668-AD-1224 LTT study). In the R668-AD-
1225 OLE study, 1 patient developed a severe ISR. The events were assessed as a non-serious AESI 
and TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation. The events were considered to be related to the study 
drug and improved or stopped after stopping the study drug. 
Suicidal Behaviour 
In the Primary Safety Pool, AESIs for Suicidal Behaviour were reported during the treatment period for 
no patients in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, 0.2% of patients in the dupilumab 300 mg QW 
group, and 0.6% of patients in the placebo group. One case of Completed Suicide in the dupilumab 
300 mg QW group is 1 of the deaths reported for the Primary Safety Pool. The death was not 
considered to be treatment-related. An additional event for Suicidal Behaviour was identified in the 
Supportive Safety Pool (study R668-AD-1021). The patient experienced suicidal ideation on study day 
178 during the follow-up period. The event resolved and was not considered related to study 
medication.  There were no additional events of suicidal behaviour in the Supportive Safety Pool, the 
R668-AD-1224 LTT safety study, or the R668-AD-1225 OLE study 
Conjunctivitis and selected eye-related TEAEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 83/100 
 
  
 
An ad-hoc analyses were performed on a grouped MedDRA PTs consistent with conjunctivitis, including 
PTs of conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis allergic, conjunctivitis bacterial, conjunctivitis viral, and atopic 
Keratoconjunctivitis. Eye disorders were reported for 2.1% of the  placebo group, 9.3% of dupilumab 
300 mg Q2W group, and 7.9% of the dupilumab 300mg QW. In the long term dupilumab +TCS 
combination study at 52 week 7.9% for placebo + TCS, 13.6% for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS, and 
19.4%) for dupilumab 300 mg QW reported eye disorders. 
Conjunctivitis and eye disorders (dry eye, eye pruritus, and blepharitis) were observed more 
commonly in the dupilumab groups than the placebo group in all safety pools and long term 
combination and open label studies. Most cases were mild to moderate in severity and resolved with 
local treatment. (approx. 80% in the monotherapy studies and 90% in the combination therapy 
studies). However 10-20% did not resolve. Two patients discontinued study treatment due to 
conjunctivitis across all studies. Although a number of these events were classified as infectious in 
origin, microbiological confirmation was not conducted. A significant proportion of patients who 
developed these events had a background history of conjunctivitis, longer history of AD and higher 
baseline disease activity. Increased report of eye disorders was not seen in the phase 2b study for 
dupilumab in asthma.  
Malignancy 
The overall malignancy related incidence of TEAEs was 1.2% in the placebo group, 1.3% in the 
dupilumab 300mg Q2W group and 1.4% in the dupilumab QW group in the primary safety pool. In 
study  R668-AD-1224 (Dupilumab plus Concomitant TCS): at  the 16-week data analysis, 1.3%, 0.9%, 
and 1.3% in the placebo, dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS, and 300 mg QW + TCS groups, respectively 
reported TEAEs in the Neoplasm SOC. The corresponding rates for the 52-week treatment period were 
3.2%, 4.5%, and 2.2%. The most commonly reported TEAES were benign lesions. Two serious reports 
in patients treated with dupilumab QW and Q2W respectively (Hodgkin Lymphoma and Lipoma) were 
both considered not to be related to study drug. Three additional SAEs were identified in the 
supportive safety pool analysis, Mycosis Fungoides and Squamous Cell Carcinoma in the dupilumab 
group, and Malignant Melanoma in-situ in the placebo group. None of these were considered related to 
study drug. Four serious  cases of squamous cell carcinoma (2 skin, 1 tongue and 1 not otherwise 
specified) were reported during the 52 wk. treatment period ,3 in the Dupilumab +TCS 300mg QW 
group and 1 in the Dupilumab +TCS 300mg Q2W group. 
In the open label extension study R668-AD-1225 the overall incidence of TEAEs was 2.4% in the 
Neoplasm SOC. (1.5% dupilumab naïve, 4.2% retreated group, 2% interrupted treatment, 5% 
continuous treatment. Skin papilloma was the commonest TEAE (0.9%).There were four cases of basal 
cell carcinoma (0.3%) and squamous cell carcinoma (0.3%). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Because dupilumab is a monoclonal antibody, it is not anticipated to directly interact with cytochrome 
P450 enzymes, other drug metabolizing enzymes, or drug transporters; thus, no typical drug-drug 
interactions via these mechanisms is expected. However, limited in vitro data suggest that IL-4 and IL-
13 affect the expression (and potentially the activities) of some cytochrome P450 isoforms. Therefore, 
it is possible that dupilumab, by inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, may indirectly influence the 
expression of these cytochrome P450 isoforms. Consequently, an open-label, drug-drug interaction 
study (R668-AD-1433) was designed to examine the effects of dupilumab on the PK of selected 
cytochrome P450 substrates in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. This study was completed 
and did not indicate clinically relevant effects of dupilumab on CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or 
CYP2C9 activity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017

During the dupilumab development program, investigators were advised to monitor patients who used 
concomitant drugs with narrow therapeutic indexes and that were metabolized by cytochrome 
enzymes. No AEs related to a drug-drug interaction were reported. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Primary Safety Pool, the proportion of patients who had at least 1 TEAE leading to permanent 
study drug discontinuation was low overall and comparable across the treatment groups, 1.9% 
(10/517) in the placebo group, 1.9% (10/529) in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group, and 1.5% 
(8/518) in the dupilumab 300 mg QW group. Dermatitis Atopic was the only PT with an incidence ≥1% 
in any group: 1.0% (5/517) for placebo, 1.3% (7/529) for dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, and 0.4% (2/518) 
for dupilumab 300 mg QW. Largely similar findings were seen in the Supportive Safety Pool. 
In the 52-week treatment period of the R668-AD-1224 study, the proportion of patients who had at 
least 1 TEAE leading to permanent study drug discontinuation was lower in the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W + TCS group (1.8% [2/110]) and the dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS group (2.9% [9/315]) than 
in the placebo + TCS group (7.6% [24/315]). The most common SOC accounting for permanent 
treatment discontinuation was in the Skin Disorders SOC, with a higher incidence in the placebo group 
(5.1% [16/315]) than in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (1.8% [2/110]), and the dupilumab 300 
mg QW group (0.3% [1/315]), with most of the events being Dermatitis Atopic. The SOCs or PT that 
had ≥2 patients in the dupilumab group experiencing TEAEs leading to permanent study drug 
discontinuation were Eye Disorder SOC (with 1 event each of Allergic Keratitis, Cystoid Macular Edema, 
and Eye Pruritus, all reported in the 300 mg QW group) and Injection Site Reactions (2 patients in the 
300 mg QW group). Infections and Infestations events leading to discontinuation occurred in 3 placebo 
patients and none in the dupilumab groups. 
Safety Data from R668-AD1415 and R668-AD1424 
The safety data of these studies have not been included as of the cut-off of the 31st May 2017. 
R668-AD-1415 
Dupilumab was well tolerated in this study. The majority of patients reported TEAEs that were mild to 
moderate in intensity. The incidence of severe TEAEs was less than 6% in any treatment group and 
was similar across the treatment groups. One death occurred in the dupilumab 300 mg Q4W group as 
a result of Gun Shot Wound (a homicide event). Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported by <5% of 
patients across all treatment groups. No dose-response trend was observed. There was no anaphylaxis 
or other systemic hypersensitivity reactions to dupilumab. There appeared to be a reverse dose-
response trend in the incidence of TEAEs leading to temporary discontinuation of the study treatment, 
with the highest incidence in the placebo group (12.2%) and the lowest in the dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W/QW group (3.6%). An inverse dose-response trend was observed in the incidence of overall 
TEAEs, which was largely driven by exacerbation of AD and skin infections. There was no apparent 
safety advantage for the lower dupilumab dose regimens (300 mg Q4W and Q8W). The incidences of 
conjunctivitis and herpes viral infections were similar between placebo and dupilumab regimen groups. 
The incidence of skin infections in placebo was higher than dupilumab regimen groups. 
R668-AD-1424 
Both dose regimens of dupilumab were well tolerated in this study with an acceptable safety profile, 
generally comparable with that observed in placebo-treated patients.  No new safety signals related to

dupilumab treatment were identified, and no dose-dependent trends were observed.   
There were no deaths.  A similar proportion of patients in the placebo + TCS group (1.9%) and in the 
dupilumab + TCS groups had SAEs (1.9% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group and 1.8% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS group).  No SAEs were considered related to dupilumab treatment.  The 
proportion of patients with TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug was generally 
low and comparable across treatment groups.  A lower proportion of patients in the in the combined 
dupilumab + TCS treatment group (3.7%) had severe TEAEs compared to patients in the placebo + 
TCS group (9.3%).   
The incidence of infections was 45.8% in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group, 42.7% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS group, and 40.7% in the placebo + TCS group.  The most common PTs 
in the SOC of Infections and Infestations were Nasopharyngitis, Conjunctivitis (of unspecified etiology) 
and Oral Herpes, all of which occurred with higher frequency in dupilumab-treated patients.  While 
there was a higher incidence of localized, Muco-cutaneous Herpes Infections in dupilumab-treated 
patients, more serious forms of herpes infections such as Eczema Herpeticum, Ophthalmic Herpes 
Simplex and Ophthalmic Herpes Zoster occurred only in the placebo + TCS group.  Of the localized 
herpes infections, none was severe and all but 1 had recovered/resolved by the end of treatment visit.   
Conjunctivitis events were more common in dupilumab treated patients than placebo treated patients. 
The majority of events had recovered/resolved by the end of treatment visit.  No patients discontinued 
the trial due an AE of Conjunctivitis, and all but 2 patients continued into the OLE trial.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
A total of 2825 clinical trial subjects have received at least one dose of dupilumab across a range of 
diseases including atopic dermatitis, asthma and nasal polyposis with chronic sinusitis during 26 clinical 
studies (6 HV, 16 AD, 3 Asthma, 1 Nasal Polyposis). Overall, 1929 subjects with moderate to severe 
AD have received at least one dose of dupilumab and 1908 of these received dupilumab 300 mg SC, 
either as part of a randomized placebo-controlled or the open-label extension study. The absolute 
numbers and percentages of the AEs have been reported. For longer treatment periods, exposure 
adjusted incidence rates were calculated as well. This is important, because the exposure to dupilumab 
varied with time, in particular studies where patients were treated in a previous study prior to 
enrollment and the overall exposure to dupilumab was greater than with placebo. 
The size of the safety database and degree of patient exposure for dupilumab to support this 
application is largely considered sufficient. The numbers of patients with long term exposure to 
dupilumab 300mg Q2W dose, the intended dose for inclusion in the SmPC, are quite low. However, the 
ICH E1 safety exposure requirements of >1500 patients exposed, 300 to 600 for 6 months, > 100 for 
1 year are well exceeded. There is one ongoing open-label extension study (1225) that will provide 
further data on long-term safety. The final report of this study should be submitted when available. 
In general, a similar frequency of patients of monotherapy placebo and verum groups showed 
treatment-emergent AEs with most AEs occurred in SOCs Infections and Infestations, Skin and 
Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders and General Disorders/Administration Site Conditions. Concerning the 
treatment-related TEAEs, the treatment groups had a higher frequency than the placebo group. The 
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions SOC had the highest AE proportion, followed by 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 86/100 
 
  
 
 
Infections and Infestations SOC. Besides, ISR, Headache, Conjunctivitis, Eosinophilia were identified as 
important treatment-related TEAEs. No differences in AE pattern were seen between monotherapy and 
dupilumab+topical treatment (TCI/TCS). Baseline demographic characteristics were balanced apart 
from gender.  
Of the 3 cases of TESAE observed in the SSP, only the Serum Sickness-like Reaction was considered by 
the investigator to be caused by study drug and lead to treatment discontinuation. It was moderate in 
severity and fully resolved. 
A case of severe Serum Sickness happened during the R668-AD-1225 OLE study which was attributed 
to the study drug and lead to treatment discontinuation. The symptoms occurred after a latency of 12 
days from the most recent and second drug administration. With the responses to the Day 120 LoQ the 
applicant proposed to rephrase the already existing important identified risk of “Systemic 
hypersensitivity” to “Systemic hypersensitivity (including events associated with immunogenicity)” 
which is endorsed 
The major difference between the safety profile for the monotherapy treatment and the combination 
therapy safety profiles at both 16 and 52 weeks is an increase in the eye disorder reports. A higher 
incidence of eye-disorders (conjunctivitis, blepharitis and dry eye), was seen in dupilumab treated 
patients compared to placebo in both the monotherapy and combination therapy studies. Patients who 
developed eye disorders were older, had longer duration of AD, had higher disease activity at baseline, 
had a baseline history of eye disorders and were more likely to have been treated previously with 
immunosuppressants. Although the majority of cases were mild to moderate in severity and responded 
to treatment with topical preparations a significant proportion (10-20%) hadn’t resolved. The long-
term effect of this chronic conjunctivitis is unknown.  The aetiology of these cases has not been 
adequately determined. Higher frequency of treatment emergent conjunctivitis in dupilumab-treated 
patients than placebo-treated patients was observed in AD studies, but not in asthma or NP studies, 
suggesting that moderate-severe AD may be a risk factor for this event. As outlined by the applicant, 
there are clear gaps in the knowledge related to conjunctivitis related events. Inclusion of 
Conjunctivitis related events as missing information is supported. Until further information is available, 
patients treated with dupilumab who develop conjunctivitis should undergo ophthalmological 
examination and appropriate warning has been included in SmPC section 4.4.  
Basically, no relevant changes were detected between the placebo and dupilumab groups in 
hematology, chemistry, and urinary analysis parameters apart from eosinophil and LDH levels.  
Circulating eosinophils were transiently increased in the dupilumab treatment groups without any 
difference as to the dosing scheme. The increase was moderate and returned to baseline after week 
16. Based on the data provided, the Applicant identified this TEAE as an ADR and this is fully endorsed.  
Currently there is only a limited amount of safety data for elderly patients and the Applicant has stated 
that the number of elderly patients enrolled in the AD studies was too small to make meaningful 
comparisons with the general adult population data. This might be caused by the fact that incidence 
and prevalence of AD declines in the course of lifetime. Therefore, ‘Safety in patients aged 65 years 
and above’ has been included in the RMP as ‘Missing information’.  
The spontaneous abortion rate registered during the dupilumab studies does not seem to exceed the 
general rate (26% vs. ~30%). However, dedicated studies analysing the effect of dupilumab on 
pregnancies and their outcomes are hitherto missing. So far, no adverse effects on pregnancy or on 
the baby could be determined. The same applies to breastfeeding.  
Opportunistic infections were rare in general and patients of the dupilumab treatment groups showed 
lower incidences than the placebo groups apart from local HSV infections which seem as in general 
linked to AD and not to be caused by the dupilumab treatment. Results of the CHRONOS and OLE 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 87/100 
 
  
 
study were consistent. After due analysis, it appears that allergic reactions are infrequent, mostly mild 
to moderate and manageable by supportive care apart from Injection site reactions which were listed 
as ADR. 
The number of subjects experiencing AEs leading to withdrawal in both the placebo-controlled and OLE 
studies was low. Especially in the LTT study CHRONOS the treatment discontinuation was lower than in 
the placebo groups. 
No clinically significant differences in the AE- or SAE-profiles or -rates were observed in dupilumab 
patients for whom ciclosporin treatment is inadvisable. This analysis included patients form the pivotal 
and long term studies who didn’t respond to ciclosporin, who could not tolerate ciclosporin or for whom  
post ciclosporin was medically inadvisable.  
The incidence and pattern of TEAEs was broadly comparable between patients for whom ciclosporin 
was medically inadvisable and patient who were not included in this subset. Of note there were higher 
rates of exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, including cases that were severe and requiring 
discontinuation of study drug and higher rates of allergic conjunctivitis and blepharitis that increased 
over the duration of the 52 week study in the population for whom ciclosporin was medically 
inadvisable. The safety profile treatment with a dupilumab dose regimen of 300 mg Q2W or 300 mg 
QW is broadly similar. For AD patients with a history of inadequate response to topical therapies for 
whom CSA treatment is medically inadvisable, there is a high unmet medical need. In this patient 
population, the safety profile following treatment with a dupilumab dose regimen of 300 mg Q2W or 
300 mg QW, was broadly similar to the subset 3 analysis (subgroup of AD patients not adequately 
controlled with, intolerant of oral ciclosporin, or for whom oral ciclosporin was not medically advisable 
in the pooled pivotal studies and the dupilumab +TCS long term study). Considering these patients are 
the most severe treatment resistant subgroup these data suggest that dupilumab is well tolerated.  
Overall rates of ADA in the monotherapy studies and combination therapy studies were low and appear 
to be transient. In general titre levels were low. Of note, two cases (1 each of serum sickness type 
reaction/serum sickness)  were reported for 2 dupilumab treated patients with high antibody titres.  
The onset of reaction in both cases was approximately around 2 weeks of starting study treatment. 
Currently Dupilumab is contraindicated in patients who have a known hypersensitivity to it, or to any 
of its excipients. Section 4.4 with cross reference to 4.8 warns that dupilumab should be discontinued 
immediately if a patient develops a systemic hypersensitivity reaction. The warnings regarding serum 
sickness were additionally revised to state that these reactions occurred within the first few weeks of 
treatment with dupilumab. Further data on the incidence of ADAs and their relation to safety from 
follow-up studies lasting over 1 year should be provided for review when available. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the presented and available data, dupilumab has been found to have an acceptable safety 
profile. With regard to TEAE profile, no meaningful qualitative and quantitative differences were seen 
as to short-term and long-term treatment as well as to the dose regimen.  
As questions still remain on the long term safety, ongoing open-label extension studies are being 
undertaken that will provide further data.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that dupilumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers dupilumab to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Dupixent (dupilumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains new active substance.   
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic or chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease. It is 
characterized by eczematous lesions (including erythema, excoriations, lichenification, infiltration, 
oozing), xerosis and pruritus. These clinical manifestations lead to significant sleep disturbances, 
severe psychological and sociological sequelae and impaired quality of life especially in patients with 
moderate to severe AD. The main goals of the treatment are the reduction of inflammation and 
symptoms, especially of pruritus.  
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 92/100 
 
  
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Among the main goals in treating AD are the reduction of skin inflammation and the alleviation of 
symptoms, particularly pruritus.   
Atopic dermatitis is treated primarily with topical corticosteroids (TCS). However, continuous long-term 
application of TCS, particularly TCS products with higher potency, is not recommended, because of the 
risk of skin atrophy, dyspigmentation, acneiform eruptions and risks associated with systemic 
absorption and subsequent HPA axis suppression. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) such as 
tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are generally safe and effective as continuous short-term treatments or 
intermittent long-term treatment. Concerns over the potential increased risk of skin malignancies and 
lymphomas associated with TCI use has prompted regulatory authorities to require, in their prescribing 
information, a warning regarding long-term safety. Treatment guidelines currently recommend TCI as 
second-line therapy and typically restrict TCI to “problem areas” that cannot be treated with TCS (eg, 
face, genital, intertriginous areas, or areas of skin atrophy). 
The majority of patients with mild AD respond well to topical therapy. However, patients with 
moderate-to-severe AD often do not achieve adequate control with acceptable doses of topical 
medications and frequently require systemic therapy. 
Systemic therapy is indicated in patients who do not respond adequately to topical therapies or for 
whom topical therapy is inadvisable. Currently available systemic therapies include nonselective 
immunosuppressants such as systemic corticosteroids, which are associated with severe toxicity and 
side effects (eg, glaucoma, edema, weight gain, increased blood pressure, and mood swings with short 
term use; cataracts, increased blood sugar, osteoporosis, thinning of the skin, increased risk of 
infections, and effects on growth in children with long term use). Because of these safety drawbacks, 
most guidelines recommend systemic corticosteroids only for short term treatment of AD. Patients' AD 
often rebounds once treatment is stopped, particularly after discontinuing systemic glucocorticoids. 
Other nonselective immunosuppressive drugs are being used in AD, off-label, with variable results. 
These drugs have well established toxicity profiles (eg, myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity for 
methotrexate, leucopenia for azathioprine, etc.) that make it difficult for use in managing a chronic, 
life-long disease such as AD. In addition, the broad immunosuppressive effects of these drugs are 
associated with an increased risk of developing serious bacterial, fungal, viral, and mycobacterial 
infections. 
Ciclosporin A, a potent, oral, non-selective immunosuppressant originally developed for prevention of 
organ transplant rejection, is currently approved in many countries of the EU to treat severe AD, 
particularly AD that is refractory to topical treatment. The use of Ciclosporin A in AD is limited by 
commonly recognized toxicities, including hypertension, impaired renal and hepatic function, and the 
potential for greater susceptibility to infections and cancer, particularly to skin cancer. The use of 
ciclosporin A requires intensive safety monitoring, especially of renal and liver function. Because of the 
high toxicity of ciclosporin A, its approved use in AD is limited to treatment of only severe cases, with a 
maximum duration of  1 year. Other limitations of   ciclosporin A treatment include its interactions with 
other commonly used medicines, which can potentially affect their metabolism and efficacy. 
Thus, there exists a significant unmet medical need for an alternative treatment for moderate-to-
severe AD. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application was supported by data from 13 studies in adult patients with AD, ranging from phase 
1b to phase 3, with the clinical efficacy almost entirely based on the results of the pivotal phase 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 93/100 
 
  
 
studies. The majority of the studies evaluated dupilumab as a monotherapy in adult patients who were 
candidates for systemic therapy.  
In the pivotal phase 3 studies standard efficacy variables for AD were used as key endpoints to assess 
efficacy of dupilumab. Efficacy assessments included direct measurements of the extent and severity of 
AD signs and symptoms, the impact of AD disease symptoms on quality of life, and anxiety and 
depression scores. Physician and patients reported efficacy evaluations were used (e.g. EASI-75, IGA 0 
or1, Pruritus NRS, DLQI, HADS) at different timepoints during the studies. 
The phase 3 studies and the treatment groups in the phase 2b study that were studied in phase 3 
(placebo, 300 mg weekly [QW], and 300 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W]) have been pooled to provide a 
more comprehensive and precise assessment of the safety of dupilumab as monotherapy. Two phase 3 
studies provide information on dupilumab when administered concomitantly with topical medications 
(TCS with or without TCI, as applicable; referred to as + TCS in the summary), since TCS represent 
the mainstay of pharmacological treatment for AD and many patients may ultimately use dupilumab 
with concomitant topical treatments. These are the long-term treatment study R668-AD-1224 (LTT), 
which provides placebo-controlled safety information on dupilumab when administered as concomitant 
treatment with TCS, and the open-label extension study R668-AD-1225 (OLE) where patients had the 
option of using dupilumab concomitantly with topical treatments. These 2 studies also provide 
information on long-term safety. Study R668-AD-1224 provides 52-week randomized control data on 
the use of dupilumab + TCS versus placebo + TCS. The OLE study includes patients from phase 2 and 
phase 3 studies and allows evaluation of the safety of continued LTT as well as re-treatment with 
dupilumab after treatment discontinuation.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Over 2000 patients were enrolled in the pivotal phase 3 studies. The analyses of the key efficacy 
results of all studies show a significant higher reduction in severity and symptoms of atopic dermatitis 
compared to placebo. Standard efficacy variables for AD were used to assess efficacy of dupilumab i.e. 
IGA 0 or1 with ≥2 points reduction and EASI-75 as co-primary and Pruritus NRS at different time 
points as key secondary endpoints.  
In study R668-AD-1224 the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS group 68.9% of the patients achieved 
EASI-75 at week 16, followed by the dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS group with 63.9% and 23.2% of 
the patients on placebo + TCS. The results of the other co-primary endpoint show that 38.7% in the 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS, 39.2% dupilumab 300 mg QW + TCS and 12.4% placebo + TCS group 
achieved an IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥ 2 points at week. Both comparisons were 
statistically significant (p<0.0001 for each). At week 52 the proportion of patients with EASI-75 at 
week 52 was still significantly higher in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W + TCS (62.3%) and dupilumab 
300 mg QW + TCS (63.9%) groups than the placebo + TCS group (21.69%). 
In the identical studies R669-AD-1334 and -1416 the proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 
was higher in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (51.3% and 44.2%) followed by dupilumab 300 mg QW 
(52.5% and 48.1%) groups and the placebo groups (14.7% and 11.9%). The proportion of patients 
with IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥ 2 points at week 16 was significantly higher in the 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W (37.9% and 36.1%) and dupilumab 300 mg QW (37.2% and 36.4%) groups 
compared to the placebo groups (10.3% and 8.5%). The comparisons were statistically significant 
(p<0.0001 for each). 
The applicant submitted the results from the supplementary studies R668-AD-1424 and R668-AD-1415 
in specific subsets, demonstrating clinically relevant efficacy and safety information of both dupilumab 
doses. R668-AD-1424 was conducted in patients with severe atopic dermatitis for whom CSA had 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 94/100 
 
  
 
either not demonstrated adequate efficacy, had unacceptable side effects or for whom initiating CSA 
was not medically advisable. They represent a population that is difficult to treat and for which there is 
an unmet medical need as there are limited treatment options. Efficacy has been demonstrated on the 
EASI-75 response at 16 weeks and for all of the key secondary objective and symptomatic endpoints. 
Study R668-AD-1415 enrolled patients who had completed 16 weeks of mono-therapy. In this study, 
patients who continued on the same dose regimen received in the parent AD-1334 and AD-1416 
studies (300 mg Q2W or 300 mg QW), showed the optimal effect in maintaining clinical response while 
efficacy for other dose regimens diminished in a dose-dependent manner. A trend for increased 
treatment-emergent ADA positivity with increased dosing intervals was observed. 
Onset of action was rapid in all studies, with divergence between dupilumab + TCS and placebo + TCS 
apparent as early as week 2 for many endpoints. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In none of the pivotal studies an active comparator was used. In the earlier Scientific Advice the CHMP 
recommended the use of an approved systemic treatment (Ciclosporin) for AD. However, this was not 
done as a study with Ciclosporin as active comparator was problematic with regards to adequate 
sample size, adequate design and blinding.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A higher incidence of Conjunctivitis was observed in the dupilumab groups compared to the placebo 
group in both the Primary and Supportive Safety Pools. Patients who developed eye disorders were 
older, had longer duration of AD, had higher disease activity at baseline, had a baseline history of eye 
disorders and were more likely to have been treated previously with immunosuppressants. 
Conjunctivitis has therefore been listed as ADRs as well as Conjunctivitis Allergic, Blepharitis, and Dry 
Eye, based on the association with dupilumab treatment. The majority of cases were mild to moderate 
in severity and were self-limiting.  However, approximately 10-20% had not resolved by the end of the 
study. The long term effect of chronic conjunctivitis in these patients is unknown. The aetiology of 
these cases has not been adequately determined. Conjunctivitis related events have there been 
included as missing information in the RMP which is endorsed.  
The incidence of Oral Herpes during the treatment periods in the Primary and Supportive Safety Pools 
was higher in the dupilumab groups compared to the placebo group. However, the long term data 
show an only slightly higher rate of oral herpes in the dupilumab Q2W group compared to placebo. 
The frequency of Eosinophilia during the 16-week treatment period in the Primary Safety Pool was 
higher in the dupilumab 300 mg Q2W group (1.7%), and similar between the 300 mg QW group 
(0.2%) and placebo group (0.4%). However, Eosinophilia was reported at a similar incidence in the 
dupilumab group (1.0%) and in the placebo group (0.7%) in the Supportive Safety Pool. Evaluation of 
laboratory data indicates that a Transient Eosinophilia was seen with dupilumab treatment in a 
minority of patients. Although the precise mechanism is unknown, Eosinophilia is considered as an 
ADR. 
Dupilumab use was associated with ISRs at a higher incidence than placebo in both the Primary and 
Supportive Safety Pools. There were no events of severe ISRs in both Pools. Based on the association 
with dupilumab use, ISRs are considered an ADR. 
The incidence of Acute Allergic Reactions was similar across all treatment groups in the Primary 
Assessment report  
EMA/512262/2017 
Page 95/100 
 
  
 
 
Safety Pool and different dose groups, respectively. Most of these reactions were skin-related. There 
was a serious event of Serum sickness-Like Illness described in a patient treated with dupilumab in the 
Supportive Safety Pool and one serious event of serum sickness in study R668-AD-1225. Both these 
events were associated with high titers ADA There was one non-serious serum sickness case observed 
in study R668-AD-1424. There were 3 events of Anaphylaxis in the R668-AD-1225 OLE study and none 
were assessed as related to dupilumab treatment. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term safety experience is limited. Based on the currently available data, on review of adverse 
events of special interest, there was no apparent increased risk of malignancy, infections,  or serious 
cardiac, vascular, thromboembolic and ischaemic events. The overall risk of systemic allergic and non-
allergic reactions with dupilumab and the immunogenic potential of dupilumab appear low. However, 
this will be further explored and confirmed in the ongoing open-label extension trial to further 
characterise the long-term safety of treatment. 
Currently there is only a limited amount of safety data for special populations as pregnant and 
lactating women, children and patients with organ impairment. Further data will be collected in the 
post-marketing setting. 
Animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity. However, data from use of dupilumab is too 
limited to draw any conclusions on potential embryofetal harms.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Atopic dermatitis is a chronic or chronically relapsing inflammatory skin disease characterized by 
pruritus, xerosis, and eczematous lesions. Especially pruritus and skin infections which are a major 
complication in AD compromise health and lower the quality of life and, in the worst case, can result in 
psychic comorbidities as anxiety and depression.  To date, limited treatment options are available. 
Local therapies often relieve typical symptoms for the duration of their application. Atopic dermatitis is 
treated primarily with topical corticosteroids. However, continuous long-term application of TCS, 
particularly TCS products with higher potency, is not recommended, because of side effects as skin

atrophy and others. The majority of patients with mild AD respond well to topical therapy. However, 
patients with moderate-to-severe AD often do not achieve adequate control with acceptable doses of 
topical medications and frequently require systemic therapy. Systemic therapy is indicated in patients 
who do not respond adequately to topical therapies or for whom topical therapy is inadvisable. 
Currently available systemic therapies include nonselective immunosuppressants such as systemic 
corticosteroids, which are associated with severe toxicity and side effects.  
The overall safety profile of dupilumab is mainly characterised by minor adverse reactions (upper 
respiratory tract infections, conjunctivitis and local injection site reactions which were in general mild, 
self-limiting and manageable). Its immunogenicity and allergic potential is low. In addition, the burden 
of biweekly subcutaneous injections is likely to be considered low by the patient against the 
background that no systemic and efficacious therapy is in place to date. The safety profile of the both 
dose regimens did not significantly differ. Further long-term data will be collected to substantiate the 
safety profile which hitherto seems to be acceptable.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy of dupilumab in the treatment of AD has been demonstrated and the safety profile has been 
found to be favourable. 
The risks of dupilumab have been found to be low and manageable and a reduction in illness severity 
and exacerbations is considered to exceed them. The B/R in adult patients with moderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis is positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Dupixent (dupilumab) is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Dupixent (dupilumab) is favourable in the following indication: 
Dupixent is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that dupilumab is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

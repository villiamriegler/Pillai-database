CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Breast cancer 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Trazimera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast 
cancer (MBC): 
- 
- 
- 
as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two 
chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at 
least an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. 
Hormone receptor positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are 
unsuitable for these treatments. 
in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. 
in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with 
hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. 
Early breast cancer 
Trazimera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer 
(EBC): 
- 
- 
- 
- 
following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) 
(see section 5.1). 
following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination 
with paclitaxel or docetaxel. 
in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. 
in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Trazimera therapy, for 
locally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Trazimera should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have 
either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated 
assay (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
Trazimera in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or 
gastro-oesophageal junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic 
disease. 
Trazimera should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have 
HER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an 
IHC3+ result. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
HER2 testing is mandatory prior to initiation of therapy (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Trazimera 
treatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy (see section 4.4), and should be administered by a healthcare professional only. 
Trazimera intravenous formulation is not intended for subcutaneous administration and should be 
administered via an intravenous infusion only. 
In order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the 
medicinal product being prepared and administered is Trazimera (trastuzumab) and not another 
trastuzumab-containing product (e.g. trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab deruxtecan). 
Posology 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Three-weekly schedule 
The recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance dose 
at three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Weekly schedule 
The recommended initial loading dose is 4 mg/kg body weight. The recommended weekly 
maintenance dose is 2 mg/kg body weight, beginning one week after the loading dose. 
Administration in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel 
In the pivotal trials (H0648g, M77001), paclitaxel or docetaxel was administered the day following 
the first dose of trastuzumab (for dose, see the Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] for 
paclitaxel or docetaxel) and immediately after the subsequent doses of trastuzumab if the preceding 
dose of trastuzumab was well tolerated. 
Administration in combination with an aromatase inhibitor 
In the pivotal trial (BO16216) trastuzumab and anastrozole were administered from day 1. There 
were no restrictions on the relative timing of trastuzumab and anastrozole at administration (for dose, 
see the SmPC for anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors). 
Early breast cancer 
Three-weekly and weekly schedule 
As a three-weekly regimen the recommended initial loading dose of Trazimera is 8 mg/kg body 
weight. The recommended maintenance dose of Trazimera at three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body 
weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. 
As a weekly regimen (initial loading dose of 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg every week) 
concomitantly with paclitaxel following chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. 
See section 5.1 for chemotherapy combination dosing. 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
Three-weekly schedule 
The recommended initial loading dose is 8 mg/kg body weight. The recommended maintenance dose 
at three-weekly intervals is 6 mg/kg body weight, beginning three weeks after the loading dose. 
Breast cancer and gastric cancer 
Duration of treatment 
Patients with MBC or MGC should be treated with Trazimera until progression of disease. Patients 
with EBC should be treated with Trazimera for 1 year or until disease recurrence, whichever occurs 
first; extending treatment in EBC beyond one year is not recommended (see section 5.1). 
Dose reduction 
No reductions in the dose of trastuzumab were made during clinical trials. Patients may continue 
therapy during periods of reversible, chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression but they should be 
monitored carefully for complications of neutropenia during this time. Refer to the SmPC for 
paclitaxel, docetaxel or aromatase inhibitor for information on dose reduction or delays. 
If left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) percentage drops ≥10 points from baseline AND to below 
50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within approximately 
3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or has declined further, or if symptomatic congestive heart 
failure (CHF) has developed, discontinuation of Trazimera should be strongly considered, unless the 
benefits for the individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be 
referred for assessment by a cardiologist and followed up. 
Missed doses 
If the patient has missed a dose of Trazimera by one week or less, then the usual maintenance dose 
(weekly regimen: 2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen: 6 mg/kg) should be administered as soon as 
possible. The patient should not wait until the next planned cycle. Subsequent maintenance doses 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be administered 7 days or 21 days later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules, 
respectively. 
If the patient has missed a dose of Trazimera by more than one week, a re-loading dose of Trazimera 
should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (weekly regimen: 4 mg/kg; three-weekly 
regimen: 8 mg/kg) as soon as possible. Subsequent Trazimera maintenance doses (weekly 
regimen:2 mg/kg; three-weekly regimen 6 mg/kg respectively) should be administered 7 days or 
21 days later according to the weekly or three-weekly schedules respectively. 
Special populations 
Dedicated pharmacokinetic studies in the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment have 
not been carried out. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age and renal impairment were not 
shown to affect trastuzumab disposition. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Trazimera in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
Trazimera is for intravenous use. The loading dose should be administered as a 90-minute 
intravenous infusion. It should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. Trazimera 
intravenous infusion should be administered by a healthcare provider prepared to manage 
anaphylaxis and an emergency kit should be available. Patients should be observed for at least six 
hours after the start of the first infusion and for two hours after the start of the subsequent infusions 
for symptoms like fever and chills or other infusion-related symptoms (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Interruption or slowing the rate of the infusion may help control such symptoms. The infusion may 
be resumed when symptoms abate. 
If the initial loading dose was well tolerated, the subsequent doses can be administered as a 
30-minute infusion. 
For instructions on reconstitution of Trazimera intravenous formulation before administration, see 
section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
Hypersensitivity to trastuzumab, murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed in section 
6.1 
Severe dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy or requiring 
supplementary oxygen therapy. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the trade name and the batch 
number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
HER2 testing must be performed in a specialised laboratory which can ensure adequate validation of 
the testing procedures (see section 5.1). 
Currently no data from clinical trials are available on re-treatment of patients with previous exposure 
to trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting.

Cardiac dysfunction 
General considerations 
Patients treated with Trazimera are at increased risk for developing CHF (New York Heart 
Association [NYHA] Class II-IV) or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction. These events have been 
observed in patients receiving trastuzumab therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel or 
docetaxel, particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) containing chemotherapy. 
These may be moderate to severe and have been associated with death (see section 4.8). In addition, 
caution should be exercised in treating patients with increased cardiac risk, e.g. hypertension, 
documented coronary artery disease, CHF, LVEF of <55%, older age. 
All candidates for treatment with Trazimera, but especially those with prior anthracycline and 
cyclophosphamide (AC) exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and 
physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and/or multigated acquisition 
(MUGA) scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Monitoring may help to identify patients who 
develop cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated 
every 3 months during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 
24 months from the last administration of Trazimera. A careful risk-benefit assessment should be 
made before deciding to treat with Trazimera. 
Trastuzumab may persist in the circulation for up to 7 months after stopping treatment based on 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of all available data (see section 5.2). Patients who receive 
anthracyclines after stopping trastuzumab may possibly be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. If 
possible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping 
trastuzumab. If anthracyclines are used, the patient’s cardiac function should be monitored carefully. 
Formal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular 
concerns following baseline screening. In all patients cardiac function should be monitored during 
treatment (e.g. every 12 weeks). Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop cardiac 
dysfunction. Patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more 
frequent monitoring (e.g. every 6 - 8 weeks). If patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular 
function, but remain asymptomatic, the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no 
clinical benefit of trastuzumab therapy has been seen. 
The safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab in patients who experience cardiac 
dysfunction has not been prospectively studied. If LVEF percentage drops ≥10 points from baseline 
AND to below 50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within 
approximately 3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or declined further, or symptomatic CHF has 
developed, discontinuation of trastuzumab should be strongly considered, unless the benefits for the 
individual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for 
assessment by a cardiologist and followed up. 
If symptomatic cardiac failure develops during Trazimera therapy, it should be treated with standard 
medicinal products for CHF. Most patients who developed CHF or asymptomatic cardiac 
dysfunction in pivotal trials improved with standard CHF treatment consisting of an 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a 
beta-blocker. The majority of patients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of 
trastuzumab treatment continued on therapy without additional clinical cardiac events. 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Trazimera and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the MBC setting. 
Patients with MBC who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiac 
dysfunction with Trazimera treatment, although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of 
Trazimera and anthracyclines. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Early breast cancer 
For patients with EBC, cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 
3 months during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 
months from the last administration of Trazimera. In patients who receive anthracycline-containing 
chemotherapy further monitoring is recommended, and should occur yearly up to 5 years from the 
last administration of Trazimera, or longer if a continuous decrease of LVEF is observed. 
Patients with history of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, 
history of or existing CHF (NYHA Class II-IV), LVEF of < 55%, other cardiomyopathy, cardiac 
arrhythmia requiring medical treatment, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease, poorly 
controlled hypertension (hypertension controlled by standard medical treatment eligible), and 
hemodynamic effective pericardial effusion were excluded from adjuvant and neoadjuvant EBC 
pivotal trials with trastuzumab and therefore treatment cannot be recommended in such patients. 
Adjuvant treatment 
Trazimera and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the adjuvant 
treatment setting. 
In patients with EBC an increase in the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events 
was observed when trastuzumab was administered after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy 
compared to administration with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel and carboplatin and was 
more marked when trastuzumab was administered concurrently with taxanes than when administered 
sequentially to taxanes. Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred 
within the first 18 months. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted in which a median follow-up of 
5.5 years was available (BCIRG006) a continuous increase in the cumulative rate of symptomatic 
cardiac or LVEF events was observed in patients who were administered trastuzumab concurrently 
with a taxane following anthracycline therapy up to 2.37% compared to approximately 1% in the two 
comparator arms (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide followed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin 
and trastuzumab). 
Risk factors for a cardiac event identified in four large adjuvant studies included advanced age 
(>50 years), low LVEF (<55%) at baseline, prior to or following the initiation of paclitaxel 
treatment, decline in LVEF by 10-15 points, and prior or concurrent use of anti-hypertensive 
medicinal products. In patients receiving trastuzumab after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, 
the risk of cardiac dysfunction was associated with a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline given 
prior to initiation of trastuzumab and a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2. 
Neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment 
In patients with EBC eligible for neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment, Trazimera should be used 
concurrently with anthracyclines only in chemotherapy-naive patients and only with low-dose 
anthracycline regimens i.e. maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin 180 mg/m2 or epirubicin 
360 mg/m2. 
If patients have been treated concurrently with a full course of low-dose anthracyclines and 
Trazimera in the neoadjuvant setting, no additional cytotoxic chemotherapy should be given after 
surgery. In other situations, the decision on the need for additional cytotoxic chemotherapy is 
determined based on individual factors. 
Experience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with low dose anthracycline regimens is 
currently limited to two trials (MO16432 and BO22227).  
In the pivotal trial MO16432, trastuzumab was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy containing three cycles of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 180 mg/m2). 
The incidence of symptomatic cardiac dysfunction was 1.7% in the trastuzumab arm. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the pivotal trial BO22227, trastuzumab was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy that contained four cycles of epirubicin (cumulative dose 300 mg/m2); at a median 
follow-up exceeding 70 months, the incidence of cardiac failure/congestive cardiac failure was 0.3% 
in the trastuzumab intravenous arm. 
Clinical experience is limited in patients above 65 years of age. 
Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) and hypersensitivity 
Serious IRRs to trastuzumab infusion including dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, hypertension, 
bronchospasm, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, 
respiratory distress, urticaria and angioedema have been reported (see section 4.8). Pre-medication 
may be used to reduce risk of occurrence of these events. The majority of these events occur during 
or within 2.5 hours of the start of the first infusion. Should an infusion reaction occur the infusion 
should be discontinued or the rate of infusion slowed and the patient should be monitored until 
resolution of all observed symptoms (see section 4.2). These symptoms can be treated with an 
analgesic/antipyretic such as meperidine or paracetamol, or an antihistamine such as 
diphenhydramine. The majority of patients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently 
received further infusions of trastuzumab. Serious reactions have been treated successfully with 
supportive therapy such as oxygen, beta-agonists, and corticosteroids. In rare cases, these reactions 
are associated with a clinical course culminating in a fatal outcome. Patients experiencing dyspnoea 
at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a 
fatal infusion reaction. Therefore, these patients should not be treated with trastuzumab (see section 
4.3). 
Initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration and delayed reactions with rapid clinical 
deterioration have also been reported. Fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week 
following infusion. On very rare occasions, patients have experienced the onset of infusion 
symptoms and pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the trastuzumab infusion. 
Patients should be warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact 
their physician if these symptoms occur. 
Pulmonary events 
Severe pulmonary events have been reported with the use of trastuzumab in the post-marketing 
setting (see section 4.8). These events have occasionally been fatal. In addition, cases of interstitial 
lung disease including lung infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, 
pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have 
been reported. Risk factors associated with interstitial lung disease include prior or concomitant 
therapy with other anti-neoplastic therapies known to be associated with it such as taxanes, 
gemcitabine, vinorelbine and radiation therapy. These events may occur as part of an infusion-related 
reaction or with a delayed onset. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of 
advanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events. Therefore, 
these patients should not be treated with trastuzumab (see section 4.3). Caution should be exercised 
for pneumonitis, especially in patients being treated concomitantly with taxanes. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Clinically significant interactions between 
trastuzumab and the concomitant medicinal products used in clinical trials have not been observed. 
Effect of trastuzumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents 
Pharmacokinetic data from studies BO15935 and M77004 in women with HER2-positive MBC 
suggested that exposure to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (and their major metabolites 6-α 
hydroxyl-paclitaxel, POH, and doxorubicinol, DOL) was not altered in the presence of trastuzumab 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(8 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg intravenous loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg q3w or 2 mg/kg q1w 
intravenous dose, respectively). However, trastuzumab may elevate the overall exposure of one 
doxorubicin metabolite, (7-deoxy-13 dihydro-doxorubicinone, D7D). The bioactivity of D7D and the 
clinical impact of the elevation of this metabolite was unclear. 
Data from study JP16003, a single-arm study of trastuzumab (4 mg/kg intravenous loading dose and 
2 mg/kg intravenous dose weekly) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2 intravenous dose) in Japanese women 
with HER2-positive MBC, suggested that concomitant administration of trastuzumab had no effect 
on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Study JP19959 was a substudy of BO18255 
(ToGA) performed in male and female Japanese patients with advanced gastric cancer to study the 
pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and cisplatin when used with or without trastuzumab. The results 
of this substudy suggested that the exposure to the bioactive metabolites (e.g. 5-FU) of capecitabine 
was not affected by concurrent use of cisplatin or by concurrent use of cisplatin plus trastuzumab. 
However, capecitabine itself showed higher concentrations and a longer half-life when combined 
with trastuzumab. The data also suggested that the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin were not affected 
by concurrent use of capecitabine or by concurrent use of capecitabine plus trastuzumab. 
Pharmacokinetic data from study H4613g/GO01305 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced 
inoperable HER2-positive cancer suggested that trastuzumab had no impact on the PK of 
carboplatin. 
Effect of antineoplastic agents on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics 
By comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after trastuzumab monotherapy 
(4 mg/kg loading/2 mg/kg q1w intravenous) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese women 
with HER2-positive MBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent administration 
of docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. 
Comparison of PK results from two Phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one Phase III 
study (H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with trastuzumab and paclitaxel and 
two Phase II studies in which trastuzumab was administered as monotherapy (W016229 and 
MO16982), in women with HER2-positive MBC indicates that individual and mean trastuzumab 
trough serum concentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the 
concomitant administration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. Comparison of 
trastuzumab PK data from study M77004 in which women with HER2-positive MBC were treated 
concomitantly with trastuzumab, paclitaxel and doxorubicin to trastuzumab PK data in studies where 
trastuzumab was administered as monotherapy (H0649g) or in combination with anthracycline plus 
cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel (study H0648g), suggested no effect of doxorubicin and paclitaxel 
on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. 
Pharmacokinetic data from study H4613g/GO01305 suggested that carboplatin had no impact on the 
PK of trastuzumab. 
The administration of concomitant anastrozole did not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of 
trastuzumab. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment 
with Trazimera and for 7 months after treatment has concluded (see section 5.2). 
Pregnancy 
Reproduction studies have been conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of 
the weekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation and have 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus. Placental transfer of trastuzumab 
during the early (days 20–50 of gestation) and late (days 120–150 of gestation) foetal development 
period was observed. It is not known whether trastuzumab can affect reproductive capacity. As 
animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, trastuzumab should be 
avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to 
the foetus. 
In the post-marketing setting, cases of foetal renal growth and/or function impairment in association 
with oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the foetus, have been 
reported in pregnant women receiving trastuzumab. Women who become pregnant should be 
advised of the possibility of harm to the foetus. If a pregnant woman is treated with trastuzumab, or 
if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving trastuzumab or within 7 months following the last dose 
of trastuzumab, close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team is desirable. 
Breast-feeding 
A study conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses 25 times that of the weekly human 
maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation from days 120 to 150 of 
pregnancy demonstrated that trastuzumab is secreted in the milk postpartum. The exposure to 
trastuzumab in utero and the presence of trastuzumab in the serum of infant monkeys was not 
associated with any adverse effects on their growth or development from birth to 1 month of age. It 
is not known whether trastuzumab is secreted in human milk. As human IgG1 is secreted into human 
milk, and the potential for harm to the infant is unknown, women should not breast-feed during 
Trazimera therapy and for 7 months after the last dose. 
Fertility 
There is no fertility data available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Trazimera has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). Dizziness 
and somnolence may occur during treatment with Trazimera (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing 
infusion-related symptoms (see section 4.4) should be advised not to drive and use machines until 
symptoms abate. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Amongst the most serious and/or common adverse reactions reported in trastuzumab usage 
(intravenous and subcutaneous formulations) to date are cardiac dysfunction, infusion-related 
reactions, haematotoxicity (in particular neutropenia), infections and pulmonary adverse reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In this section, the following categories of frequency have been used: very common (≥1/10), 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000), very rare 
(<1/10 000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
Presented in Table 1 are adverse reactions that have been reported in association with the use of 
intravenous trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy in pivotal clinical trials and in 
the post-marketing setting. 
All the terms included are based on the highest percentage seen in pivotal clinical trials. In addition, 
terms reported in the post-marketing setting are included in Table 1.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Cardiac dysfunction 
Congestive heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) is a common adverse reaction associated with the use 
of trastuzumab and has been associated with a fatal outcome (see section 4.4). Signs and symptoms 
of cardiac dysfunction such as dyspnoea, orthopnoea, increased cough, pulmonary oedema, S3 
gallop, or reduced ventricular ejection fraction, have been observed in patients treated with 
trastuzumab (see section 4.4). 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
In 3 pivotal clinical trials of adjuvant trastuzumab given in combination with chemotherapy, the 
incidence of grade 3/4 cardiac dysfunction (specifically symptomatic Congestive Heart Failure) was 
similar in patients who were administered chemotherapy alone (i.e. did not receive trastuzumab) and 
in patients who were administered trastuzumab sequentially after a taxane (0.3-0.4%). The rate was 
highest in patients who were administered trastuzumab concurrently with a taxane (2.0%). In the 
neoadjuvant setting, the experience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab and low dose 
anthracycline regimen is limited (see section 4.4). 
When trastuzumab was administered after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy NYHA Class III-IV 
heart failure was observed in 0.6% of patients in the one-year arm after a median follow-up of 
12 months. In study BO16348, after a median follow-up of 8 years the incidence of severe CHF 
(NYHA Class III & IV) in the trastuzumab 1 year treatment arm was 0.8%, and the rate of mild 
symptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was 4.6%. 
Reversibility of severe CHF (defined as a sequence of at least two consecutive LVEF values ≥50% 
after the event) was evident for 71.4% of trastuzumab-treated patients. Reversibility of mild 
symptomatic and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction was demonstrated for 79.5% of patients. 
Approximately 17% of cardiac dysfunction related events occurred after completion of trastuzumab. 
In the pivotal metastatic trials of intravenous trastuzumab, the incidence of cardiac dysfunction 
varied between 9% and 12% when it was combined with paclitaxel compared with 1% – 4% for 
paclitaxel alone. For monotherapy, the rate was 6% – 9%. The highest rate of cardiac dysfunction 
was seen in patients receiving trastuzumab concurrently with anthracycline/cyclophosphamide 
(27%), and was significantly higher than for anthracycline/cyclophosphamide alone (7% – 10%). In 
a subsequent trial with prospective monitoring of cardiac function, the incidence of symptomatic 
CHF was 2.2% in patients receiving trastuzumab and docetaxel, compared with 0% in patients 
receiving docetaxel alone. Most of the patients (79%) who developed cardiac dysfunction in these 
trials experienced an improvement after receiving standard treatment for CHF. 
Infusion reactions, allergic-like reactions and hypersensitivity 
It is estimated that approximately 40% of patients who are treated with trastuzumab will experience 
some form of infusion-related reaction. However, the majority of infusion-related reactions are mild 
to moderate in intensity (NCI-CTC grading system) and tend to occur earlier in treatment, i.e. during 
infusions one, two and three and lessen in frequency in subsequent infusions. Reactions include 
chills, fever, dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen 
saturation, respiratory distress, rash, nausea, vomiting and headache (see section 4.4). The rate of 
infusion-related reactions of all grades varied between studies depending on the indication, the data 
collection methodology, and whether trastuzumab was given concurrently with chemotherapy or as 
monotherapy. 
Severe anaphylactic reactions requiring immediate additional intervention can occur usually during 
either the first or second infusion of trastuzumab (see section 4.4) and have been associated with a 
fatal outcome. 
Anaphylactoid reactions have been observed in isolated cases. 
Haematotoxicity 
Febrile neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred very 
commonly. The frequency of occurrence of hypoprothrombinaemia is not known. The risk of 
neutropenia may be slightly increased when trastuzumab is administered with docetaxel following 
anthracycline therapy. 
Pulmonary events 
Severe pulmonary adverse reactions occur in association with the use of trastuzumab and have been 
associated with a fatal outcome. These include, but are not limited to, pulmonary infiltrates, acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute 
pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency (see section 4.4). 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Details of risk minimisation measures that are consistent with the EU Risk Management Plan are 
presented in (section 4.4) Warnings and Precautions. 
Immunogenicity 
In the neoadjuvant-adjuvant EBC study (BO22227), at a median follow-up exceeding 70 months, 
10.1% (30/296) of patients treated with trastuzumab intravenous developed antibodies against 
trastuzumab. Neutralizing anti-trastuzumab antibodies were detected in post-baseline samples in 2 of 
30 patients in the trastuzumab intravenous arm. 
The clinical relevance of these antibodies is not known. The presence of anti-trastuzumab antibodies 
had no impact on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy (determined by pathological Complete Response 
[pCR] and event free survival [EFS]) and safety determined by occurrence of administration related 
reactions (ARRs) of trastuzumab intravenous. 
There are no immunogenicity data available for trastuzumab in gastric cancer. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no experience with overdose in human clinical trials. Single doses of trastuzumab alone 
greater than 10 mg/kg have not been administered in the clinical trials; a maintenance dose of 
10 mg/kg q3w following a loading dose of 8 mg/kg has been studied in a clinical trial with metastatic 
gastric cancer patients. Doses up to this level were well tolerated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01FD01 
Trazimera is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the 
European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Overexpression of HER2 is observed in 20%-30% of primary 
breast cancers. Studies of HER2-positivity rates in gastric cancer (GC) using immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) 
have shown that there is a broad variation of HER2-positivity ranging from 6.8% to 34.0% for IHC 
and 7.1% to 42.6% for FISH. Studies indicate that breast cancer patients whose tumours overexpress 
HER2 have a shortened disease-free survival compared to patients whose tumours do not 
overexpress HER2. The extracellular domain of the receptor (ECD, p105) can be shed into the blood 
stream and measured in serum samples. 
Mechanism of action 
Trastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta-membrane region of 
HER2’s extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 
signalling and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism 
of HER2. As a result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress HER2. Additionally, trastuzumab is a 
potent mediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, 
trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing 
cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 
Detection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification 
Detection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in breast cancer 
Trastuzumab should only be used in patients whose tumours have HER2 overexpression or HER2 
gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated assay. HER2 overexpression should 
be detected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment of fixed tumour blocks (see 
section 4.4). HER2 gene amplification should be detected using fluorescence in situ hybridisation 
(FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH) of fixed tumour blocks. Patients are eligible for 
Trazimera treatment if they show strong HER2 overexpression as described by a 3+ score by IHC or 
a positive FISH or CISH result. 
To ensure accurate and reproducible results, the testing must be performed in a specialised 
laboratory, which can ensure validation of the testing procedures. 
The recommended scoring system to evaluate the IHC staining patterns is as stated in Table 2:

In general, FISH is considered positive if the ratio of the HER2 gene copy number per tumour cell to

the HER2 gene per tumour cell if no chromosome 17 control is used. 
In general, CISH is considered positive if there are more than 5 copies of the HER2 gene per nucleus 
in greater than 50% of tumour cells. 
For full instructions on assay performance and interpretation please refer to the package inserts of 
validated FISH and CISH assays. Official recommendations on HER2 testing may also apply. 
For any other method that may be used for the assessment of HER2 protein or gene expression, the 
analyses should only be performed by laboratories that provide adequate state-of-the-art performance 
of validated methods. Such methods must clearly be precise and accurate enough to demonstrate 
overexpression of HER2 and must be able to distinguish between moderate (congruent with 2+) and 
strong (congruent with 3+) overexpression of HER2. 
Detection of HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer 
Only an accurate and validated assay should be used to detect HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene 
amplification. IHC is recommended as the first testing modality and in cases where HER2 gene 
amplification status is also required, either a silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) or a FISH 
technique must be applied. SISH technology is however, recommended to allow for the parallel 
evaluation of tumour histology and morphology. To ensure validation of testing procedures and the 
generation of accurate and reproducible results, HER2 testing must be performed in a laboratory 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
staffed by trained personnel. Full instructions on assay performance and results interpretation should 
be taken from the product information leaflet provided with the HER2 testing assays used. 
In the ToGA (BO18255) study, patients whose tumours were either IHC3+ or FISH positive were 
defined as HER2-positive and thus included in the study. Based on the clinical study results, the 
beneficial effects were limited to patients with the highest level of HER2 protein overexpression, 
defined by a 3+ score by IHC, or a 2+ score by IHC and a positive FISH result. 
In a method comparison study (study D008548) a high degree of concordance (>95%) was observed 
for SISH and FISH techniques for the detection of HER2 gene amplification in gastric cancer 
patients. 
HER2 overexpression should be detected using an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based assessment 
of fixed tumour blocks; HER2 gene amplification should be detected using in situ hybridisation 
using either SISH or FISH on fixed tumour blocks.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Trastuzumab has been used in clinical studies as monotherapy for patients with MBC who have 
tumours that overexpress HER2 and who have failed one or more chemotherapy regimens for their 
metastatic disease (trastuzumab alone). 
Trastuzumab has also been used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of 
patients who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Patients who had 
previously received anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy were treated with paclitaxel 
(175 mg/m2 infused over 3 hours) with or without trastuzumab. In the pivotal study of docetaxel 
(100 mg/m2 infused over 1 hour) with or without trastuzumab, 60% of the patients had received prior 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were treated with trastuzumab until 
progression of disease. 
The efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients who did not receive prior 
adjuvant anthracyclines has not been studied. However, trastuzumab plus docetaxel was efficacious 
in patients whether or not they had received prior adjuvant anthracyclines. 
The test method for HER2 overexpression used to determine eligibility of patients in the pivotal 
trastuzumab monotherapy and trastuzumab plus paclitaxel clinical studies employed 
immunohistochemical staining for HER2 of fixed material from breast tumours using the murine 
monoclonal antibodies CB11 and 4D5. These tissues were fixed in formalin or Bouin’s fixative. This 
investigative clinical study assay performed in a central laboratory utilised a 0 to 3+ scale. Patients 
classified as staining 2+ or 3+ were included, while those staining 0 or 1+ were excluded. Greater 
than 70% of patients enrolled exhibited 3+ overexpression. The data suggest that beneficial effects 
were greater among those patients with higher levels of overexpression of HER2 (3+). 
The main test method used to determine HER2 positivity in the pivotal study of docetaxel, with or 
without trastuzumab, was immunohistochemistry. A minority of patients was tested using 
fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH). In thisstudy, 87% of patients entered had disease that was 
IHC3+, and 95% of patients entered had disease that was IHC3+ and/or FISH-positive.

Combination treatment with trastuzumab and anastrozole 
Trastuzumab has been studied in combination with anastrozole for first line treatment of MBC in 
HER2 overexpressing, hormone-receptor (i.e. oestrogen-receptor (ER) and/or progesterone-receptor 
(PR)) positive postmenopausal patients. Progression free survival was doubled in the trastuzumab 
plus anastrozole arm compared to anastrozole (4.8 months versus 2.4 months). For the other 
parameters the improvements seen for the combination were for overall response (16.5% versus 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.7%); clinical benefit rate (42.7% versus 27.9%); time to progression (4.8 months versus 2.4 
months). For time to response and duration of response no difference could be recorded between the 
arms. The median overall survival was extended by 4.6 months for patients in the combination arm. 
The difference was not statistically significant, however more than half of the patients in the 
anastrozole alone arm crossed over to a trastuzumab containing regimen after progression of disease.

Sites of progression 
The frequency of progression in the liver was significantly reduced in patients treated with the 
combination of trastuzumab and paclitaxel, compared to paclitaxel alone (21.8% versus 45.7%; 
p=0.004). More patients treated with trastuzumab and paclitaxel progressed in the central nervous 
system than those treated with paclitaxel alone (12.6% versus 6.5%; p=0.377). 
Early breast cancer (adjuvant setting) 
Early breast cancer is defined as non-metastatic primary invasive carcinoma of the breast. In the 
adjuvant treatment setting, trastuzumab was investigated in 4 large multicentre, randomised, studies. 
- 
- 
Study BO16348 was designed to compare one and two years of three-weekly trastuzumab 
treatment versus observation in patients with HER2-positive EBC following surgery, 
established chemotherapy and radiotherapy (if applicable). In addition, comparison of two 
years of trastuzumab treatment versus one year of trastuzumab treatment was performed. 
Patients assigned to receive trastuzumab were given an initial loading dose of 8 mg/kg, 
followed by 6 mg/kg every three weeks for either one or two years. 
The NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies that comprise the joint analysis were designed 
to investigate the clinical utility of combining trastuzumab treatment with paclitaxel following 
AC chemotherapy, additionally the NCCTG N9831 study also investigated adding 
trastuzumab sequentially to AC→P chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive EBC 
following surgery. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
- 
The BCIRG 006 study was designed to investigate combining trastuzumab treatment with 
docetaxel either following AC chemotherapy or in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin 
in patients with HER2-positive EBC following surgery. 
Early breast cancer in the HERA study was limited to operable, primary, invasive adenocarcinoma of 
the breast, with axillary nodes positive or axillary nodes negative if tumours at least 1 cm in 
diameter. 
In the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies, EBC was limited to women 
with operable breast cancer at high risk, defined as HER2-positive and axillary lymph node positive 
or HER2-positive and lymph node negative with high risk features (tumour size > 1 cm and ER 
negative or tumour size >2 cm, regardless of hormonal status). 
In the BCIRG 006 study HER2-positive EBC was defined as either lymph node positive or high risk 
node negative patients with no (pN0) lymph node involvement, and at least 1 of the following 
factors: tumour size greater than 2 cm, oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative, 
histological and/or nuclear grade 2-3, or age <35 years.

***There is a discrepancy in the overall sample size due to a small number of patients who were randomized 
after the cut-off date for the 12-month median follow-up analysis 
The efficacy results from the interim efficacy analysis crossed the protocol pre-specified statistical 
boundary for the comparison of 1-year of trastuzumab versus observation. After a median follow-up 
of 12 months, the hazard ratio (HR) for disease free survival (DFS) was 0.54 (95% CI 0.44, 0.67) 
which translates into an absolute benefit, in terms of a 2-year disease-free survival rate, of 7.6 
percentage points (85.8% versus 78.2%) in favour of the trastuzumab arm. 
A final analysis was performed after a median follow-up of 8 years, which showed that 1 year 
trastuzumab treatment is associated with a 24% risk reduction compared to observation only 
(HR=0.76, 95% CI 0.67, 0.86). This translates into an absolute benefit in terms of an 8 year disease 
free survival rate of 6.4 percentage points in favour of 1 year trastuzumab treatment. 
In this final analysis, extending trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show 
additional benefit over treatment for 1 year [DFS HR in the intent to treat (ITT) population of 2 years 
versus 1 year=0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.13), p-value=0.90 and OS HR=0.98 (0.83, 1.15); p-value=0.78]. 
The rate of asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction was increased in the 2-year treatment arm (8.1% 
versus 4.6% in the 1-year treatment arm). More patients experienced at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse 
event in the 2-year treatment arm (20.4%) compared with the 1-year treatment arm (16.3%). 
In the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 studies trastuzumab was administered in combination with 
paclitaxel, following AC chemotherapy. 
Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide were administered concurrently as follows: 
- 
- 
intravenous push doxorubicin, at 60 mg/m2, given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. 
intravenous cyclophosphamide, at 600 mg/m2 over 30 minutes, given every 3 weeks for 
4 cycles. 
Paclitaxel, in combination with trastuzumab, was administered as follows: 
- 
or 
- 
intravenous paclitaxel - 80 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion, given every week for 
12 weeks. 
intravenous paclitaxel - 175 mg/m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion, given every 3 weeks 
for 4 cycles (day 1 of each cycle). 
The efficacy results from the joint analysis of the NSABP B-31 and NCCTG 9831 studies at the time 
of the definitive analysis of DFS* are summarized in Table 7. The median duration of follow up was 
1.8 years for the patients in the AC→P arm and 2.0 years for patients in the AC→PH arm.

For the primary endpoint, DFS, the addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel chemotherapy resulted in a 
52% decrease in the risk of disease recurrence. The hazard ratio translates into an absolute benefit, in 
terms of 3-year disease-free survival rate estimates of 11.8 percentage points (87.2% versus 75.4%) 
in favour of the AC→PH (trastuzumab) arm. 
At the time of a safety update after a median of 3.5-3.8 years follow up, an analysis of DFS 
reconfirms the magnitude of the benefit shown in the definitive analysis of DFS. Despite the 
cross-over to trastuzumab in the control arm, the addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel chemotherapy 
resulted in a 52% decrease in the risk of disease recurrence. The addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel 
chemotherapy also resulted in a 37% decrease in the risk of death. 
The pre-planned final analysis of OS from the joint analysis of studies NSABP B-31 and NCCTG 
N9831 was performed when 707 deaths had occurred (median follow-up 8.3 years in the AC→PH 
group). Treatment with AC→PH resulted in a statistically significant improvement in OS compared 
with AC→P (stratified HR=0.64; 95% CI [0.55, 0.74]; log-rank p-value < 0.0001). At 8 years, the 
survival rate was estimated to be 86.9% in the AC→PH arm and 79.4% in the AC→P arm, an 
absolute benefit of 7.4% (95% CI 4.9%, 10.0%). 
The final OS results from the joint analysis of studies NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 are

DFS analysis was also performed at the final analysis of OS from the joint analysis of studies 
NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831. The updated DFS analysis results (stratified HR=0.61; 95% CI 
[0.54, 0.69]) showed a similar DFS benefit compared to the definitive primary DFS analysis, despite 
24.8% patients in the AC→P arm who crossed over to receive trastuzumab. At 8 years, the 
disease-free survival rate was estimated to be 77.2% (95% CI: 75.4, 79.1) in the AC→PH arm, an 
absolute benefit of 11.8% compared with the AC→P arm. 
In the BCIRG 006 study trastuzumab was administered either in combination with docetaxel, 
following AC chemotherapy (AC→DH) or in combination with docetaxel and carboplatin 
(DCarbH). 
Docetaxel was administered as follows: 
- 
intravenous docetaxel - 100 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour, given every 
3 weeks for 4 cycles (day 2 of first docetaxel cycle, then day 1 of each subsequent cycle) 
or 
- 
intravenous docetaxel - 75 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour, given every 3 weeks 
for 6 cycles (day 2 of cycle 1, then day 1 of each subsequent cycle)  
which was followed by: 
- 
carboplatin - at target AUC=6 mg/mL/min administered by intravenous infusion over 
30-60 minutes repeated every 3 weeks for a total of six cycles 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Trastuzumab was administered weekly with chemotherapy and 3 weekly thereafter for a total of 
52 weeks. 
The efficacy results from the BCIRG 006 are summarized in Tables 9 and 10. The median duration 
of follow up was 2.9 years in the AC→D arm and 3.0 years in each of the AC→DH and DCarbH 
arms.

In the BCIRG 006 study for the primary endpoint, DFS, the hazard ratio translates into an absolute 
benefit, in terms of 3-year disease-free survival rate estimates of 5.8 percentage points (86.7% versus 
80.9%) in favour of the AC→DH (trastuzumab) arm and 4.6 percentage points (85.5% versus 
80.9%) in favour of the DCarbH (trastuzumab) arm compared to AC→D. 
In study BCIRG 006, 213/1075 patients in the DCarbH (TCH) arm, 221/1074 patients in the 
AC→DH (AC→TH) arm, and 217/1073 in the AC→D (AC→T) arm had a Karnofsky performance 
status ≤90 (either 80 or 90). No disease-free survival (DFS) benefit was noticed in this subgroup of 
patients (hazard ratio=1.16, 95% CI [0.73, 1.83] for DCarbH (TCH) versus AC→D (AC→T); hazard 
ratio 0.97, 95% CI [0.60, 1.55] for AC→DH (AC→TH) versus AC→D). 
In addition a post-hoc exploratory analysis was performed on the data sets from the joint analysis

Early breast cancer (neoadjuvant-adjuvant setting) 
So far, no results are available which compare the efficacy of trastuzumab administered with 
chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting with that obtained in the neo-adjuvant/adjuvant setting. 
In the neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment setting, study MO16432, a multicentre randomised trial, was 
designed to investigate the clinical efficacy of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy including both an anthracycline and a taxane, followed by adjuvant 
trastuzumab, up to a total treatment duration of 1 year. The study recruited patients with newly 
diagnosed locally advanced (Stage III) or inflammatory EBC. Patients with HER2+ tumours were 
randomised to receive either neoadjuvant chemotherapy concurrently with neoadjuvant-adjuvant 
trastuzumab, or neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. 
In study MO16432, trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance every 
3 weeks) was administered concurrently with 10 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy as follows: 
• 
Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and paclitaxel 150 mg/m2, administered 3-weekly for 3 cycles, 
which was followed by 
• 
Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 administered 3-weekly for 4 cycles, 
which was followed by 
• 
CMF on day 1 and 8 every 4 weeks for 3 cycles 
which was followed after surgery by 
• 
additional cycles of adjuvant trastuzumab (to complete 1 year of treatment)

Metastatic gastric cancer 
Trastuzumab has been investigated in one randomised, open-label phase III study ToGA (BO18255) 
in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. 
Chemotherapy was administered as follows: 
- 
or 
- 
capecitabine - 1 000 mg/m2 orally twice daily for 14 days every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (evening 
of day 1 to morning of day 15 of each cycle) 
intravenous 5-fluorouracil - 800 mg/m2/day as a continuous intravenous infusion over 5 days, 
given every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (days 1 to 5 of each cycle) 
Either of which was administered with: 
- 
cisplatin - 80 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles on day 1 of each cycle.

Patients were recruited to the study who were previously untreated for HER2-positive inoperable 
locally advanced or recurrent and/or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or 
gastro-oesophageal junction not amenable to curative therapy. The primary endpoint was overall 
survival which was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any 
cause. At the time of the analysis a total of 349 randomized patients had died: 182 patients (62.8%) 
in the control arm and 167 patients (56.8%) in the treatment arm. The majority of the deaths were 
due to events related to the underlying cancer. 
Post-hoc subgroup analyses indicate that positive treatment effects are limited to targeting tumours 
with higher levels of HER2 protein (IHC2+/FISH+ or IHC3+). The median overall survival for the 
high HER2 expressing group was 11.8 months versus 16 months, HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.51-0.83) and 
the median progression free survival was 5.5 months versus 7.6 months, HR 0.64 
(95% CI 0.51-0.79) for FP versus FP + H, respectively. For overall survival, the HR was 0.75 (95% 
CI 0.51-1.11) in the IHC2+/FISH+ group and the HR was 0.58 (95% CI 0.41-0.81) in the 
IHC3+/FISH+ group. 
In an exploratory subgroup analysis performed in the TOGA (BO18255) study there was no apparent 
benefit on overall survival with the addition of trastuzumab in patients with ECOG PS 2 at baseline 
[HR 0.96 (95% CI 0.51-1.79)], non measurable [HR 1.78 (95% CI 0.87-3.66)] and locally advanced 
disease [HR 1.20 (95% CI 0.29-4.97)]. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
trastuzumab in all subsets of the paediatric population for breast and gastric cancer (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic model 
analysis using pooled data from 1,582 subjects, including patients with HER2-positive MBC, EBC, 
AGC or other tumour types, and healthy volunteers, in 18 Phase I, II and III trials receiving 
intravenous trastuzumab. A two-compartment model with parallel linear and non-linear elimination 
from the central compartment described the trastuzumab concentration-time profile. Due to 
non-linear elimination, total clearance increased with decreasing concentration. Therefore, no 
constant value for half-life of trastuzumab can be deduced. The t1/2 decreases with decreasing 
concentrations within a dosing interval (see Table 16). MBC and EBC patients had similar PK 
parameters (e.g. clearance (CL), the central compartment volume (Vc)) and population-predicted 
steady-state exposures (Cmin, Cmax and AUC). Linear clearance was 0.136 L/day for MBC, 
0.112 L/day for EBC and 0.176 L/day for AGC. The non-linear elimination parameter values were 
8.81 mg/day for the maximum elimination rate (Vmax) and 8.92 µg/mL for the Michaelis-Menten 
constant (Km) for the MBC, EBC, and AGC patients. The central compartment volume was 2.62 L 
for patients with MBC and EBC and 3.63 L for patients with AGC. 
In the final population PK model, in addition to primary tumour type, body-weight, serum aspartate 
aminotransferase and albumin were identified as a statistically significant covariates affecting the 
exposure of trastuzumab. However, the magnitude of effect of these covariates on trastuzumab 
exposure suggests that these covariates are unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on 
trastuzumab concentrations. 
The population predicted PK exposure values (median with 5th - 95th Percentiles) and PK parameter 
values at clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax and Cmin) for MBC, EBC and AGC patients treated 
with the approved q1w and q3w dosing regimens are shown in Table 14 (Cycle 1), Table 15 
(steady-state), and Table 16 (PK parameters).

Trastuzumab washout period was assessed following q1w or q3w intravenous administration using 
the population PK model. The results of these simulations indicate that at least 95% of patients will 
reach concentrations that are <1 μg/mL (approximately 3% of the population predicted Cmin,ss, or 
about 97% washout) by 7 months.

Circulating shed HER2 ECD 
The exploratory analyses of covariates with information in only a subset of patients suggested that 
patients with greater shed HER2-ECD level had faster nonlinear clearance (lower Km) (P < 0.001). 
There was a correlation between shed antigen and SGOT/AST levels; part of the impact of shed 
antigen on clearance may have been explained by SGOT/AST levels. 
Baseline levels of the shed HER2-ECD observed in MGC patients were comparable to those in MBC 
and EBC patients and no apparent impact on trastuzumab clearance was observed. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
There was no evidence of acute or multiple dose-related toxicity in studies of up to 6 months, or 
reproductive toxicity in teratology, female fertility or late gestational toxicity/placental transfer 
studies. Trastuzumab is not genotoxic.  
No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic potential of 
trastuzumab, or to determine its effects on fertility in males.

polysorbate 20 (E 432) 
6.2 
Incompatibilities 
This medicinal product must not be mixed or diluted with other medicinal products except those 
mentioned under section 6.6. 
It must not be diluted with glucose solutions. 
6.3  Shelf life 
Unopened vial 
4 years. 
Aseptic reconstitution and dilution 
After aseptic reconstitution with sterile water for injections the reconstituted solution is physically 
and chemically stable for 48 hours at 2°C – 8°C. Any remaining reconstituted solution should be 
discarded. 
After aseptic dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection, solutions of 
Trazimera for intravenous infusion are physically and chemically stable in polyvinylchloride, 
polyethylene, polypropylene or ethylene vinyl acetate bags, or glass intravenous bottles for up to 
30 days at 2°C – 8°C, and 24 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30°C. 
From a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Trazimera infusion solution 
should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the 
responsibility of the user and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C, unless 
reconstitution and dilution have taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.

6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). 
Store in the original package in order to protect from light. 
Unopened vials of Trazimera may be stored up to 30°C for a single period of up to 3 months. Upon 
removal from refrigerated storage, Trazimera must not be returned to refrigerated storage. Discard at 
the end of this 3-month period or by the expiry date on the vial, whichever occurs first. Record the 
“discard by” date in the date field provided on the carton. 
For storage conditions of the reconstituted medicinal product, see sections 6.3 and 6.6. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
Trazimera 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
15 mL clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film containing 
150 mg of trastuzumab. 
Each carton contains one vial. 
Trazimera 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
30 mL clear glass type I vial with butyl rubber stopper laminated with a fluoro-resin film containing 
420 mg of trastuzumab. 
Each carton contains one vial. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Trazimera is provided in sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic, single use vials.  
Appropriate aseptic technique should be used for reconstitution and dilution procedures. Care must 
be taken to ensure the sterility of prepared solutions. Since the medicinal product does not contain 
any anti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agents, aseptic technique must be observed.  
Aseptic preparation, handling and storage 
Aseptic handling must be ensured when preparing the infusion. Preparation should be:  
• 
performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice 
rules especially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products.  
followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure 
maintenance of the aseptic conditions. 
• 
If the prepared solution is intended to be stored for more than 24 hours prior to use, then the 
reconstitution and dilution procedure should be performed in a laminar flow hood or biological 
safety cabinet using standard precautions for the safe handling of intravenous agents. 
Trazimera should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during 
reconstitution or shaking the reconstituted solution may result in problems with the amount of 
Trazimera that can be withdrawn from the vial. 
The reconstituted solution should not be frozen.

Trazimera 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
Appropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 150 mg vial of Trazimera is reconstituted with 
7.2 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be 
avoided. 
This yields a 7.4 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL trastuzumab, 
at a pH of approximately 6.0. An overfill of 4% ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be 
withdrawn from each vial. 
Trazimera 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
Appropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 420 mg vial of Trazimera is reconstituted with 
20 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be 
avoided. 
This yields a 20.6 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL 
trastuzumab, at a pH of approximately 6.0. An overfill of 5% ensures that the labelled dose of 
420 mg can be withdrawn from each vial.

Instructions for aseptic reconstitution 
1) 
2) 
Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the appropriate volume (as noted above) of sterile water 
for injections in the vial containing the lyophilised Trazimera, directing the stream into the 
lyophilised cake. 
Swirl the vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! 
Slight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed 
for approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Trazimera results in a colourless to pale 
brownish-yellow transparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. 
Determine the volume of the solution required: 
• 
based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly 
dose of 2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: 
Volume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance)  
21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) 
• 
based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly 
dose of 6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: 
Volume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance)  
21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) 
The appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial using a sterile needle and 
syringe and added to an infusion bag or bottle containing 250 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection. Do not use with glucose-containing solutions (see section 6.2). The bag 
or bottle should be gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming.  
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration 
prior to administration. 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No incompatibilities between Trazimera and polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, polypropylene or 
ethylene vinyl acetate bags or with glass intravenous bottles have been observed. 
Trazimera is for single-use only, as the product contains no preservatives. Any unused medicinal 
product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Trazimera is and what it is used for 
Trazimera contains the active substance trastuzumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal 
antibodies attach to specific proteins or antigens. Trastuzumab is designed to bind selectively to an 
antigen called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 is found in large amounts 
on the surface of some cancer cells where it stimulates their growth. When Trazimera binds to HER2 
it stops the growth of such cells and causes them to die. 
Your doctor may prescribe Trazimera for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer when: 
• 
You have early breast cancer, with high levels of a protein called HER2.  
• 
You have metastatic breast cancer (breast cancer that has spread beyond the original tumour) 
with high levels of HER2. Trazimera may be prescribed in combination with the 
chemotherapy medicine paclitaxel or docetaxel as first treatment for metastatic breast cancer 
or it may be prescribed alone if other treatments have proved unsuccessful. It is also used in 
combination with medicines called aromatase inhibitors with patients with high levels of 
HER2 and hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (cancer that is sensitive to the 
presence of female sex hormones).  
• 
You have metastatic gastric cancer with high levels of HER2, when it is in combination with 
the other cancer medicines capecitabine or 5-flououracil and cisplatin. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Trazimera 
Do not use Trazimera if 
• 
you are allergic to trastuzumab, to murine (mouse) proteins, or to any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6).  
• 
you have severe breathing problems at rest due to your cancer or if you need oxygen 
treatment.

Warnings and precautions 
Your doctor will closely supervise your therapy. 
Heart checks 
Treatment with Trazimera alone or with a taxane may affect the heart, especially if you have ever 
used an anthracycline (taxanes and anthracyclines are two other kinds of medicine used to treat 
cancer). The effects may be moderate to severe and could cause death. Therefore, your heart function 
will be checked before, during (every three months) and after (up to two to five years) treatment with 
Trazimera. If you develop any signs of heart failure (inadequate pumping of blood by the heart), 
your heart function may be checked more frequently (every six to eight weeks), you may receive 
treatment for heart failure or you may have to stop Trazimera treatment. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given Trazimera if: 
• 
• 
• 
you have had heart failure, coronary artery disease, heart valve disease (heart murmurs), high 
blood pressure, taken any high blood pressure medicine or are currently taking any high blood 
pressure medicine. 
you have ever had or are currently using a medicine called doxorubicin or epirubicin 
(medicines used to treat cancer). These medicines (or any other anthracyclines) can damage 
heart muscle and increase the risk of heart problems with Trazimera. 
you suffer from breathlessness, especially if you are currently using a taxane. Trazimera can 
cause breathing difficulties, especially when it is first given. This could be more serious if you 
are already breathless. Very rarely, patients with severe breathing difficulties before treatment 
have died when they were given Trazimera. 
• 
you have ever had any other treatment for cancer. 
If you receive Trazimera with any other medicine to treat cancer, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, an 
aromatase inhibitor, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, or cisplatin you should also read the patient 
information leaflets for these products. 
Children and adolescents 
Trazimera is not recommended for anyone under the age of 18 years. 
Other medicines and Trazimera 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or may take any other 
medicines. 
It may take up to 7 months for Trazimera to be removed from the body. Therefore you should tell 
your doctor, pharmacist or nurse that you have had Trazimera if you start any new medicine in the 
7 months after stopping treatment. 
Pregnancy 
• 
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking this medicine.  
• 
• 
You should use effective contraception during treatment with Trazimera and for at least 
7 months after treatment has ended.  
Your doctor will advise you of the risks and benefits of taking Trazimera during pregnancy. In 
rare cases, a reduction in the amount of (amniotic) fluid that surrounds the developing baby 
within the womb has been observed in pregnant women receiving Trazimera. This condition 
may be harmful to your baby in the womb and has been associated with the lungs not 
developing fully resulting in foetal death.

Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed your baby during Trazimera therapy and for 7 months after the last dose of 
Trazimera, as Trazimera may pass to your baby through your breast milk. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Trazimera may affect your ability to drive a car or operate machines. If during treatment you 
experience symptoms, such as dizziness, sleepiness, chills or fever, you should not drive or use 
machines until these symptoms disappear. 
3.  How Trazimera is given 
Before starting the treatment your doctor will determine the amount of HER2 in your tumour. Only 
patients with a large amount of HER2 will be treated with Trazimera. Trazimera should only be 
given by a doctor or nurse. Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for 
you. The dose of Trazimera depends on your body weight. 
Trazimera intravenous formulation is not for subcutaneous use and should be given as an intravenous 
infusion only. 
Trazimera intravenous formulation is given as an intravenous infusion (“drip”) directly into your 
veins. The first dose of your treatment is given over 90 minutes and you will be observed by a health 
professional while it is being given in case you have any side effects. If the first dose is well 
tolerated the next doses may be given over 30 minutes (see section 2 under “Warnings and 
precautions”). The number of infusions you receive will depend on how you respond to the 
treatment. Your doctor will discuss this with you. 
In order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the 
medicine being prepared and given is Trazimera (trastuzumab) and not another 
trastuzumab-containing product (e.g. trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab deruxtecan). 
For early breast cancer, metastatic breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer, Trazimera is given 
every 3 weeks. Trazimera may also be given once a week for metastatic breast cancer. 
If you stop using Trazimera 
Do not stop using this medicine without talking to your doctor first. All doses should be taken at the 
right time every week or every three weeks (depending on your dosing schedule). This helps your 
medicine work as well as it can. 
It may take up to 7 months for Trazimera to be removed from your body. Therefore your doctor may 
decide to continue to check your heart functions, even after you finish treatment. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, Trazimera can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some of 
these side effects may be serious and may lead to hospitalisation. 
During a Trazimera infusion, chills, fever and other flu like symptoms may occur. These are very 
common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people). Other infusion-related symptoms are: feeling sick 
(nausea), vomiting, pain, increased muscle tension and shaking, headache, dizziness, breathing 
difficulties, high or low blood pressure, heart rhythm disturbances (palpitations, heart fluttering or 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
irregular heart beat), swelling of the face and lips, rash and feeling tired. Some of these symptoms 
can be serious and some patients have died (see section 2 under “Warnings and precautions”). 
These effects mainly occur with the first intravenous infusion (“drip” into your vein) and during the 
first few hours after the start of the infusion. They are usually temporary. You will be observed by a 
healthcare professional during the infusion and for at least six hours after the start of the first 
infusion and for two hours after the start of other infusions. If you develop a reaction, they will slow 
down or stop the infusion and may give you treatment to counteract the side effects. The infusion 
may be continued after the symptoms improve. 
Occasionally, symptoms start later than six hours after the infusion begins. If this happens to you, 
contact your doctor immediately. Sometimes, symptoms may improve and then get worse later. 
Serious side effects 
Other side effects can occur at any time during treatment with Trazimera, not just related to an 
infusion. Tell a doctor or nurse straight away, if you notice any of the following side effects: 
• 
Heart problems can sometimes occur during treatment and occasionally after treatment has 
stopped and can be serious. They include weakening of the heart muscle possibly leading to 
heart failure, inflammation of the lining around the heart and heart rhythm disturbances. This 
can lead to symptoms such as breathlessness (including breathlessness at night), cough, fluid 
retention (swelling) in the legs or arms, and palpitations (heart fluttering or irregular heart 
beat) (see section 2 under “Heart checks”). 
Your doctor will monitor your heart regularly during and after treatment but you should tell your 
doctor immediately if you notice any of the above symptoms. 
• 
Tumour lysis syndrome (a group of metabolic complications occurring after cancer treatment 
characterised by high blood levels of potassium and phosphate, and low blood levels of 
calcium). Symptoms may include kidney problems (weakness, shortness of breath, fatigue and 
confusion), heart problems (fluttering of the heart or a faster or slower heartbeat), seizures, 
vomiting or diarrhoea, and tingling in the mouth, hands or feet. 
If you experience any of the above symptoms when your treatment with Trazimera has finished, you 
should see your doctor and tell them that you have previously been treated with Trazimera.

The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only 
Trazimera intravenous is provided in sterile, preservative-free, non-pyrogenic, single use vials. 
In order to prevent medication errors it is important to check the vial labels to ensure that the 
medicine being prepared and given is Trazimera (trastuzumab) and not another 
trastuzumab-containing product (e.g. trastuzumab emtansine or trastuzumab deruxtecan). 
Always keep this medicine in the closed original pack at a temperature of 2ºC – 8ºC in a refrigerator. 
Unopened vials of Trazimera may be stored up to 30°C for a single period of up to 3 months. Upon 
removal from refrigerated storage, Trazimera must not be returned to refrigerated storage. Discard at 
the end of this 3-month period or by the expiry date on the vial, whichever occurs first. Record the 
“discard by” date in the date field provided on the carton. 
After aseptic dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) solution for injection, solutions of 
Trazimera for intravenous infusion are physically and chemically stable for up to 30 days at 
2°C – 8°C, and 24 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30°C. 
From a microbiological point of view, the reconstituted solution and Trazimera infusion solution 
should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to 
use are the responsibility of the user and would not normally be longer than 24 hours at 2°C – 8°C, 
unless reconstitution and dilution have taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions. 
Appropriate aseptic technique should be used for reconstitution and dilution procedures. Care must 
be taken to ensure the sterility of prepared solutions. Since the medicinal product does not contain 
any anti-microbial preservative or bacteriostatic agents, aseptic technique must be observed. 
Aseptic preparation, handling and storage 
Aseptic handling must be ensured when preparing the infusion. Preparation should be:  
• 
performed under aseptic conditions by trained personnel in accordance with good practice 
rules especially with respect to the aseptic preparation of parenteral products.  
followed by adequate storage of the prepared solution for intravenous infusion to ensure 
maintenance of the aseptic conditions. 
• 
If the prepared solution is intended to be stored for more than 24 hours prior to use, then the 
reconstitution and dilution procedure should be performed in a laminar flow hood or biological 
safety cabinet using standard precautions for the safe handling of intravenous agents. 
A vial of Trazimera aseptically reconstituted with water for injections (not supplied) is chemically 
and physically stable for 48 hours at 2ºC – 8ºC after reconstitution and must not be frozen. 
Trazimera 150 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
Appropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 150 mg vial of Trazimera is reconstituted with 
7.2 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be 
avoided. This yields a 7.4 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL 
trastuzumab. An overfill of 4% ensures that the labelled dose of 150 mg can be withdrawn from each 
vial. 
Trazimera 420 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
Appropriate aseptic technique should be used. Each 420 mg vial of Trazimera is reconstituted with 
20 mL of sterile water for injections (not supplied). Use of other reconstitution solvents should be 
avoided. This yields a 20.6 mL solution for single-dose use, containing approximately 21 mg/mL 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
trastuzumab. An overfill of 5% ensures that the labelled dose of 420 mg can be withdrawn from each 
vial.

Trazimera should be carefully handled during reconstitution. Causing excessive foaming during 
reconstitution or shaking the reconstituted Trazimera may result in problems with the amount of 
Trazimera that can be withdrawn from the vial. 
Instructions for aseptic reconstitution 
1) 
2) 
Using a sterile syringe, slowly inject the appropriate volume (as noted above) of sterile water 
for injections in the vial containing the lyophilised Trazimera. 
Swirl vial gently to aid reconstitution. DO NOT SHAKE! 
Slight foaming of the product upon reconstitution is not unusual. Allow the vial to stand undisturbed 
for approximately 5 minutes. The reconstituted Trazimera results in a colourless to pale 
brownish-yellow transparent solution and should be essentially free of visible particulates. 
Determine the volume of the solution required: 
•  based on a loading dose of 4 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent weekly 
dose of 2 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: 
Volume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (4 mg/kg for loading or 2 mg/kg for maintenance)  
21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) 
•  based on a loading dose of 8 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight, or a subsequent 3-weekly 
dose of 6 mg trastuzumab/kg body weight: 
Volume (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (8 mg/kg for loading or 6 mg/kg for maintenance) 
21 (mg/mL, concentration of reconstituted solution) 
The appropriate amount of solution should be withdrawn from the vial using a sterile needle and 
syringe and added to a polyvinylchloride, polyethylene, polypropylene or ethylene vinyl acetate 
infusion bag, or a glass infusion bottle containing 250 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection. Do not use with glucose-containing solutions. The bag or bottle should be 
gently inverted to mix the solution in order to avoid foaming. Parenteral solutions should be 
inspected visually for particulates and discoloration prior to administration.

‘EMEA/H/C/002127/II/0129’ 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Guideline on core SmPC for human normal 
immunoglobulin for intravenous administration 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94038/ 2007 Rev 5; CHMP, 
2018). As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. Version 4.6 of the RMP has been 
accepted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list 
of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics, Package Leaflet and to the 
Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in 
order to include the number of PID patients, to 
include prescriber information and tolerability 
information for manual push infusion, to update 
prescriber information on device-assisted infusion 
and to include safety information, based on final 
results from study IgPro20_4004, an open-label 
study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of higher 
infusion parameters of Hizentra infused manually or 
with pump assistance in PID patients.  
Update of sections 4.2 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order 
to update the number of PID patients and to include 
safety information based on final results from study 
IgPro_4005, a phase 4, open-label, single-sequence, 
parameter was met for the 3 cohorts (manual push 
technique: n=16, pump-assisted flow rate administration: 
n=18, and pump-assisted infusion volumes administration 
n=15). The majority of the 49 PID patients (>60%) 
increased their volumes of up to 50 mL and flow rates up to 
100 mL/h per injection site via pump as well as flow rates 
of up to 120 mL/h via manual push. These increases were 
well tolerated and IgG levels were maintained at the same 
level at the end of study compared to baseline. No new 
safety concerns were identified from this study. 
A total of 25 PID patients, including 15 paediatric patients, 
participated in Study IgPro20_4005. No new safety 
concerns were identified from this study.

evaluation period. The mean efficacy evaluation period was 
125.8 days (range: 1-330) in the 0.2 g/kg, and 196.1 days 
(range: 1-330) in the 0.4 g/kg bw group. Patients who 
completed the pivotal PATH study without relapse on 0.4 
g/kg bw dose and initially received this dose in the 
extension study had a relapse rate of 5.6 % (1/18 
patients). For all patients who received 0.4 g/kg bw in the 
PATH extension study, 9.7 % (7/72 patients) had a relapse. 
Patients who completed the PATH study without relapse on 
0.2 g/kg bw dose and initially received this dose in the 
extension study had a relapse rate of 50 % (3/6 patients). 
For all patients who received 0.2 g/kg bw in the extension 
study, 47.9 % (35/73 patients) had a relapse. Down-
titrating patients in the extension study who completed the 
PATH study on either dose from 0.4 g/kg to 0.2 g/kg bw 
dose was possible in 67.9 % of subjects (19/28 patients) 
without occurrence of relapse; all of the 9 relapsers 
recovered within 4 weeks after treatment with 0.4 g/kg bw 
dose. Grip strength, MRC sum score, and R-ODS centile 
score remained stable as compared to baseline for patients 
who never had a relapse in the extension study. 
Safety results showed the typical adverse events (AE) 
profile of SCIGs (mainly local reactions, mainly mild). No 
new signals were observed. There was no indication of 
increased AEs/ infusion in the higher dose (0.4 g/kg) 
group. 
The safety and effectiveness of Hizentra have been 
established in paediatric subjects 2 to 18 years of age. 
Hizentra was evaluated in 54 paediatric subjects with PID 2 
to <12 years of age and in 45 paediatric subjects 12 to 
<18 years of age. There were no differences in the 
pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy profiles as compared

efficacy were observed between CIDP subjects >65 years 
and CIDP subjects 18 to 65 years of age. In the clinical

was of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considers that the benefit/risk profile of Hizentra continues 
to be favourable. The CHMP considered that the Marketing 
Authorisation could be granted with unlimited validity. The

models suggest that comparable IgG exposure levels 
(AUC0-14days, Cmin 14days) may be obtained if Hizentra 
is administered subcutaneously every two weeks using 
double the weekly dose during maintenance therapy. 
These simulations further suggest that comparable serum 
IgG trough levels can be achieved when the weekly 
maintenance dose of Hizentra is administered in 
proportional amounts more frequently than once a week 
(e.g. 2 times per week, 3 times per week, 5 times per week 
or daily). 
Simulation of 2-3 missed daily doses resulted in a median

of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-

of a possible administration of Hizentra every two weeks 
using double the weekly dose during maintenance therapy 
elaborating data deriving from previous clinical studies. 
Assessment of the model and the results obtained during 
the simulations indicate that the modelling and simulation 
(M&S) has some limitations which may partially affect the 
full credibility of the model applied. Nevertheless despite 
the shortcomings in the modelling and simulation exercise, 
the practical aspect of individual tailoring of dosage and 
dose intervals, is central and has to be kept in mind. It is 
indeed understood that the clinical context provides 
reassurance that dosing every two weeks is likely to result 
in similar trough levels to dosing weekly. This make the 
focus on M&S used as the only basis for the SmPC 
statement the only objection in the discussion, because it 
does not acknowledge the underlying uncertainties of the 
method. For this reason, the CHMP suggested to make a 
Page 25/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
direct reference to the limitations/uncertainties of this 
modelling approach in the SmPC. The final agreed wording 
is indeed encompassing this issue and the procedure is 
considered acceptable.

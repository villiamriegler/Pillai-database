issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD 
is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Annex II 
The final study report for Vedrop covered patient data from 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
September 2007 to February 2017 and included data from 
508 registry patients and 3.059 patient visits. The studied 
population represented a significant proportion of patients 
(18 % of all patients exposed to Vedrop worldwide) in which 
the efficacy and safety were monitored. These data confirm 
the benefit-risk balance of Vedrop in the approved indication. 
Consequently, the remaining specific obligation is considered 
fulfilled and the positive benefit/risk ratio for Vedrop in the 
approved indication remains unchanged. 
Due to the rarity of the disease, and despite the additional 
data gathered through the fulfilment of the specific 
obligations, the data are still not as comprehensive as a full 
marketing authorisation would require. The MAH shall 
therefore continue to provide yearly updates on any new 
information concerning efficacy and safety of the product in 
patients with congenital chronic cholestasis or hereditary 
cholestasis as a condition (specific obligation) to the 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances.

SmPC, 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
Labelling and 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, the 
PL 
CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of 
Vedrop continues to be adequately and sufficiently 
demonstrated and therefore considered that the benefit risk 
profile of Vedrop continues to be favourable. Following data 
from the ongoing registry and spontaneous reports in which 
no patient reported a renal insufficiency that could be related 
to Vedrop and data from the registry showing no impact on 
Vedrop  
EMA/463790/2019 
Page 8/10 
 
 
  
  
estimated glomerular filtration rate the precautionary 
statement “Renal function and serum osmolarity should be 
evaluated and monitored under treatment with Vedrop” was 
deleted from 4.4 of the SmPC. Furthermore following three 
cases of abdominal pain including one positive de-challenge 
reported abdominal pain was added with the frequency 
unknown in 4.8 of the SmPC.

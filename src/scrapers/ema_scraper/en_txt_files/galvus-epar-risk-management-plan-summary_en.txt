Summary of the risk management plan for Galvus/Eureas 
(Vildagliptin/Vildagliptin-Metformin) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Galvus/Eucreas. 
The RMP details important risks of Galvus/Eucreas, how these risks can be 
minimized. 
The  Galvus/Eucreas  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its 
package  leaflet  give  essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and 
patients on how Galvus/Eucreas should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Galvus/Eucreas should be read in the context 
of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and 
its  plain-language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in 
updates of Galvus/Eucreas’s RMP. The three yearly periodic update of RMP 
as stated in Annex II (D) of SmPC is removed. The RMP would be updated 
as and when applicable. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Vildagliptin  is  also  authorized  for use  in  combination  with  insulin  (with  or 
without metformin) when diet and exercise plus a stable dose of insulin do 
not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
They contain vildagliptin and vildagliptin+metformin hydrochloride as active 
substances,  respectively  and  they  are  given  as  oral  tablets.  The 
recommended daily dose of Galvus is 100 mg, administered as one dose of 
50  mg  in  the  morning  and  one  dose  of  50 mg  in  the  evening.  The 
recommended daily dose of Eucreas is 100 mg vildagliptin, initiated at either 
the  50 mg/850 mg  or  50 mg/1000 mg  tablet  strength  twice  daily,  one 
tablet in the morning and the other in the evening. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  vildagliptin’s  benefits  can  be 
found  in  vildagliptin’s  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary, 
available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/galvus 
Further information about the evaluation of vildagliptin+metformin benefits 
can be found in vildagliptin+metformin EPAR, including in its plain-language 
summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage:

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or 
further characterize the risks 
Important  risks  of  Galvus/Eucreas,  together  with  measures  to  minimize 
such  risks  and 
learning  more  about 
Galvus/Eucreas’s risks, are outlined below. 
the  proposed  studies 
for 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on 
correct use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and 
healthcare professionals; 
  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen 
so to ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the 
patient (e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its 
risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is 
collected continuously and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment 
so  that  immediate  action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Galvus/Eucreas is 
not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A: List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Galvus/Eucreas  are  risks  that  need  special  risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that 
the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks can be regarded 
as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Galvus/Eucreas. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet 
and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to 
be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Incidence 
In a population-based cohort study in the UK among 44,406 
T2DM patients with oral antidiabetic treatment, 605 patients 
developed a first-time computer-recorded diagnosis of liver 
disease that occurred within 90 days after receiving a 
prescription for an oral antidiabetic drug. The IR of liver disease 
was 53.2 (95% CI 49.2-57.6) per 10,000 PY (Jick et al 1999). 
In a population-based matched retrospective cohort study using 
information from administrative health databases from the 
province of Ontario, Canada, Porepa et al (2010) found an 
incidence rate of 8.19 per 10,000 PYs for any serious liver 
disease (defined as liver cirrhosis, liver failure and its sequelae, 
or liver transplantation) in 438,069 adults (30-75 years of age) 
with newly diagnosed diabetes after excluding those with pre-
existing liver or alcohol-related diseases. The corresponding 
incidence rate of liver failure (and sequelae) was 5.84 per 
10,000 PYs. The risk of advanced hepatopathy was found to be 
higher in the group of patients with newly diagnosed diabetes as 
compared to an age-, sex- and region-matched comparison 
group without diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.77; 95% CI 
1.68-1.86). 
Prevalence 
Salmela et al (1984) assessed the prevalence of abnormal liver 
function tests (LFTs) of nine different test parameters in a total 
of 175 diabetic out- and 72 diabetic in-patients with type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes in Oulo, Finland. The prevalence of abnormal 
AST (i.e. > 40 IU/L), ALT (i.e. > 40 IU/L) and bilirubin (i.e. > 
17 IU/L) in 118 T2DM outpatients was 5.1%, 22.9%, and 
10.2%, respectively. 
West et al (2006) assessed the prevalence of elevated ALT in 
type 1 and 2 diabetic patients from Nottingham (UK). Elevated 
ALT was found in 12.1% (95% CI 9.9-14.5%) of those with 
T2DM. The risk of elevated ALT in T2DM patients increased with 
increasing BMI (p trend = 0.04), and was lower in those taking 
insulin (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.22–0.65). The authors concluded 
that the prevalence of elevated ALT is 3- to 4-times higher in 
patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes than in the 
general population assuming a prevalence of elevated ALT of 
approximately 3% in the general population. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Risk minimization 
measures 
In a population based cohort study in the UK, the incidence rate 
of liver disease was 53.2 per 10,000 patient years. In the UK, a 
prevalence of elevated ALT of approximately 12% was 
estimated for patients with either type 1 or type 2 DM 
corresponding to a 3- to 4-times higher prevalence than in the 
general population. The prevalence of AST>40 IU/L, ALT>40 
IU/L, and bilirubin>17 IU/L among 118 outpatients with type 2 
DM in Finland was 5.1%, 22.9%, and 10.2%, respectively.

Incidence 
Gonzalez-Perez et al (2010) performed a population based 
nested case-control analysis nested in a cohort of 85,525 type 2 
diabetics (average age at study start 61.2 years; 43.7% 
females) and a random sample of 200,000 diabetes-free 
individuals from the general population aged 20-79 years using 
data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), an 
electronic primary care medical record database from the UK. 
Patients with a history of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin 
cancer) or pancreatic disease were excluded. Age- and sex-
stratified AP incidence rates were calculated in the type 2 
diabetic cohort based on 176 cases and a total of 325,990 PYs of 
follow-up:

In the cohort analysis of the same study, the age-, sex-, and 
calendar year-adjusted incidence rate ratio of AP in diabetic 
patients versus that in the general population was 1.77 (95% CI 
1.46-2.15). The magnitude of this association decreased with 
adjustment for various additional factors in the nested case-
control analysis (adjusted OR 1.37; 95% CI 0.99-1.89) 
(Gonzalez-Perez et al 2010). 
A slightly higher overall incidence rate was identified by Girman 
et al (2010) in a cohort study based on data from the General 
Practice Research Database (GPRD). The AP incidence rate 
identified in T2DM patients (including those with a previous 
history of pancreatitis) was 65.9 per 100,000 PYs. The risk of 
developing AP was approximately 50% higher in patients with 
T2DM as compared to patients without diabetes (adjusted 
hazard ratio 1.49; 95% CI: 1.31-1.70). 
In addition, various cohort studies from the United States (US) 
with secondary use of data from administrative health claims 
databases have been published reporting AP incidence rates 
ranging approximately from 130-560/100,000 person-years 
(e.g. Noel et al 2009, Garg et al 2010, Romley et al 2012, 
Wenten et al 2012); however, these health claims data may 
overestimate the AP incidence rates, e.g. due to claims 
miscoding for pancreatitis, or population differences (Noel et al 
2009). Furthermore, studies have been published from Taiwan 
(Lai et al 2011, Shen et al 2012a) and Japan (Urushihara et al 
2012) based on claims or hospital administrative data reporting 
AP incidence rates similar to the ones from the US in the range 
of 280-480/100,000 person-years. 
Prevalence 
In a cohort of 218,874 T2DM patients with at least one 
prescription for an oral antidiabetic drug (other than sitagliptin) 
identified from a US health claims database, the prevalence of a 
pancreatitis in the previous 12 months was 0.5% (Cai et al 
2010). 
In chronic pancreatitis about 60% of the patients are reported 
to have diabetes, 30% to be insulin-dependent (Hardt et al 
2002). 
Mortality 
Data on mortality of AP in T2DM patients are scarce. A 
retrospective cohort study using the Taiwanese National Health 
Insurance Research Database found that the hospital mortality 
in diabetic first-attack AP patients was 3.5% vs 4.1% in non-
diabetic patients (adjusted OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.65-0.91) (Shen 
et al 2012b). 
Data from the general population suggest that the case fatality 
rate of AP decreased from 20% in the early 1960s to 6% in the 
year 2000 (Yadav and Lowenfels 2006). The case fatality was 
less than 5% for the age group < 40 years but increased to 
28% in those older than 60 years and was 30-40% in those 
older than 80 years old. However, the reported case fatality rate 
of first attack of AP in studies published since 2000 ranges from 
3% to 10.7% (Spanier et al 2008). 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Diabetics have a higher incidence of pancreatitis and biliary 
disease than individuals without diabetes. A recent meta-
analysis of non-interventional studies showed that T2DM is 
associated with an increased AP risk (relative risk =1.84; 95% 
CI 1.45-2.33) (Yang et al 2013). 
Typical risk factors for AP probably also apply for T2DM patients 
and include e.g. advanced age, race (higher among black than 
white population), alcohol, smoking, obesity, gallstones, 
hypertriglyceridemia (Yadav and Lowenfels 2013).

Important identified risk Lactic acidosis (Eucreas only) 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Incidence 
The incidence rate of lactic acidosis in T2DM patients in the US 
(before metformin was introduced) was reported to be 9.7 
(95% CI: 0.2 to 19.1) cases per 100,000 PYs (Brown et al 
1998). Salpeter et al (2006) performed a systemic literature 
review to assess the incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic 
acidosis with metformin use compared to placebo and other 
glucose-lowering treatments in patients with T2DM. Pooled data 
from 206 comparative trials and cohort studies revealed no 
cases of fatal or nonfatal lactic acidosis in 47,846 PYs of 
metformin use or in 38,221 PYs in the non-metformin group. 
The upper limit of the 95% CI of the estimated incidence rate of 
metformin-associated lactic acidosis was 6.3 cases per 100,000 
PYs, the corresponding figure in the non-metformin group was 
7.8 cases per 100,000 PYs. Bodmer and colleagues performed a 
nested case-control analysis using the U.K.-based General 
Practice Research Database to identify T2DM patients who used 
oral antidiabetic drugs. Within the study population, all incident 
cases of lactic acidosis were identified. Among the study 
population of 50,048 T2DM subjects, six cases of lactic acidosis 
during current use of oral antidiabetic drugs were identified, 
yielding a crude incidence rate of 3.3 cases per 100,000 PYs 
among metformin users and 4.8 cases per 100,000 PYs among 
users of sulfonylureas (Bodmer et al 2008). 
Prevalence 
No information on period or point prevalence of lactic acidosis in 
T2DM patients unexposed to metformin could be identified. 
Mortality 
No information on the mortality rate of lactic acidosis in T2DM 
patients unexposed to metformin could be identified. 
In critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a 
US tertiary hospital, the case fatality was 56% for patients with 
lactic acidosis (n=239) (Gunnerson et al 2006). In a French 
case-series of 49 metformin-treated patients with lactic 
acidosis, the case fatality rate was 45% (Lalau and Race 1999). 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Age may be a risk factor due to declining renal function. 
High overdose of metformin.  
Any type of acute metabolic acidosis (such as lactic acidosis, 
diabetic ketoacidosis).  
Severe renal impairment (GFR <30 mL/min) 
Acute conditions with the potential to alter renal function, such 
as:

Important potential risk Muscle events/ 
myopathy/rhabdomyolysis, in particular with current 
statin use (events of myalgia excluded) 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Incidence 
 
A comprehensive literature search revealed two cohort studies 
with information on the incidence of muscle events in T2DM 
patients. Both studies were based on information derived from 
large United States databases; one using electronic medical 
record information from a large Health Maintenance 
Organization (Kaiser Permanente Northwest [KPNW]), the other 
one using health claims information from a large managed care 
database (Integrated Healthcare Information Services [IHCIS]). 
The KPNW analysis assessed myopathic events (myalgia, 
myositis, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis) occurring during follow-up 
independent of any history of prior muscular events, while the 
IHCIS excluded those patients with a prior history and only 
included ‘incident’ cases. The incidence rates of myopathic 
events reported in the two studies were very similar, namely 
24.2 and 18.9 per 1,000 person-years of follow-up for T2DM 
patients with and those without statin exposure, respectively in 
the KPNW analysis (Nichols and Koro 2007), and 16.5 per 1,000 
person-years in the IHCIS analysis (in T2DM patients with or 
without statin exposure) (Koro et al 2008). It is unclear 
however to which extent less severe forms of myopathy, for 
instance mild myalgia or myositis, may have been under-
represented in these databases thereby giving too low estimates 
of the incidence rates. 
Rhabdomyolysis is a very rare disease in the general population. 
In a retrospective population-based analysis using the UK-based 
General Practice Research Database, 25 patients out of 2.5 
million in a base population of patients aged 20-75 years were 
found to have rhabdomyolysis between 1990 and 1999 (Black 
and Jick 2002). Most information on the incidence of 
rhabdomyolysis has come from observational studies in users of 
statins, a drug class often co-prescribed in T2DM patients. 
In a recent systematic review of cohort studies, the incidence of 
rhabdomyolysis in users of statins was reported to be 0.34 
(95% CI 1.6-6.5) per 10,000 person-years among all statin 
users (except cerivastatin) (Law and Rudnicka 2006). 
Similar results were found by Graham et al (2004) who 
estimated the risk of rhabdomyolysis in patients treated with 
lipid-lowering drugs (including statins) in the ambulatory 
setting. The incidence rate for rhabdomyolysis with statin 
monotherapy was about 0.44 per 10,000 person-years of 
therapy. This rate increased to about 6 per 10,000 person-years 
for combination therapy with a fibrate. 
In the cohort study mentioned above by Nichols and Koro 
(2007) based on Kaiser Permanente Northwest data, the 
proportion of diabetic patients identified with rhabdomyolysis 
during follow-up was 0.12% (95% CI 0.05-0.18%) in those 
without and 0.13% (0.06-0.20%) in those with statin exposure. 
The corresponding adjusted incidence rates were 2 (95% CI 1-
5) and 1 (95% CI 1-3) per 10,000 person-years, respectively in 
those without and with statin exposure. 
The incidence of the most common statin-associated muscle-
related complaint, i.e. non-specific muscle pain or joint pain in 
the absence of elevated CK, is approximately 5% (Christopher-
Stine 2006). 
Prevalence 
The etiology of muscle-related events (e.g. myopathy, muscle 
infarction or pyomyositis) in the diabetic population includes 
conditions such as neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, 
infections and certain concomitant medications, particularly 
statins. Neuropathy is a highly prevalent complication of 
diabetes which may be associated for instance with lower 
extremity proximal myopathy. 
Hong et al (1998) assessed the significance of symptoms -
suggestive of neuropathy in T2DM patients and non-diabetic 
controls matched for age and gender. More T2DM patients than 
controls experienced symptoms suggestive of lower extremity 
proximal myopathy (i.e. weakness climbing stairs: 42 vs. 19%, 
getting up from squatting position: 31 vs. 11%). Additionally, 
more T2DM patients than controls had weaker hip muscles (24 
vs. 6%). 
Diabetic muscle infarction is a rare, painful and potentially 
serious complication in patients with poorly controlled DM. It is 
frequently misdiagnosed clinically as abscess, neoplasm, or 
myositis. It can be triggered by an ischemic event and causes 
extensive muscle necrosis through hypoxia-reperfusion injury 
and compartment syndrome. CK levels may be normal or 
slightly increased. 
Only a few cases with diabetic muscle infarction have been 
published. Due to difficulties in making the correct diagnosis 
and excluding other etiologies, it can be speculated that diabetic 
muscle infarction is under-diagnosed (Sahin et al 2005). 
Another rare muscle-related event that may occur in diabetics is 
pyomyositis. It is a pyogenic infection of the skeletal muscle 
that can lead to abscess formation. It commonly occurs in the 
tropics, but is also recognized in temperate climates, with 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and diabetes 
being the main predisposing factors (Crum 2004, Seah et al 
2004). Since 1981 more than 330 cases have been published. 
The most common underlying medical condition in HIV-negative 
patients was diabetes which was observed in 19% of cases 
(Crum 2004). 
Molsted et al (2012) estimated the prevalence of 
musculoskeletal pain in Danish 951 patients with T2DM aged 
18+ years using a self-administered validated questionnaire to 
assess the history of pain in three parts in the musculoskeletal 
system during the past 14 days, i.e. pain in the shoulder and 
neck, low-back pain, and pain in the arm, hand, knee and/or 
hip. Patients with T2DM had a significantly higher prevalence of 
musculoskeletal pain in all three areas in the body (52% for 
shoulder and neck pain, 60% for low-back pain, 71% for pain in 
arm, hand, knee and/or hip) compared to an age- and gender-
matched sample of the general population from the same 
geographical region The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain was 
1.7- to 2.1-times (p< 0.001) higher in T2DM patients than the 
control patients. 
Mortality 
No information on mortality due to rhabdomyolysis or other 
muscle-related events in T2DM patients could be identified. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Risk minimization 
measures 
Patients treated concomitantly with statins are at increased risk 
of myopathy. 
Statins can cause different degrees of myopathy, ultimately 
leading to rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.

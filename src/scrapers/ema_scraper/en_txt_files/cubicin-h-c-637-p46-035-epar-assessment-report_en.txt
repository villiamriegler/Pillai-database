1.  Introduction 
On 01 December 2020, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Cubicin, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data were also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure P46/035: a short Expert 
Overview to provide information from a recently completed (13 July 2020) Phase II Open-Label, 
Single-arm Clinical Trial to Study the Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of MK-3009 (Daptomycin) 
in Japanese Pediatric Participants Aged 1 to 17 Years with Complicated Skin and Soft Tissue Infections 
or Bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci. 
About the product 
Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide natural product that is active against Gram-positive bacteria only. 
The mechanism of action involves binding to bacterial membranes of both growing and stationary 
phase cells causing depolarisation and leading to a rapid inhibition of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis. 
This results in bacterial cell death with negligible cell lysis. 
Daptomycin pharmacokinetics are generally linear and time-independent at doses of 4 to 12 mg/kg 
administered as a single daily dose by 30-minute intravenous infusion for up to 14 days in healthy 
adult volunteers. Steady state concentrations are achieved by the third daily dose. Daptomycin is 
eliminated primarily by the kidney. 
Cubicin was authorised via the Centralised procedure in 2006. 
- Approved indication(s) and posology 
Indication 
Cubicin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
•  Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with complicated skin and soft-tissue 
infections (cSSTI). 
•  Adult patients with right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE) due to Staphylococcus aureus. It is 
recommended that the decision to use daptomycin should take into account the antibacterial 
susceptibility of the organism and should be based on expert advice. See sections 4.4 and 5.1. 
•  Adult and paediatric (1 to 17 years of age) patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia 
(SAB). In adults, use in bacteraemia should be associated with RIE or with cSSTI, while in 
paediatric patients, use in bacteraemia should be associated with cSSTI. 
Daptomycin is active against Gram positive bacteria only (see section 5.1). In mixed infections where 
Gram negative and/or certain types of anaerobic bacteria are suspected, Cubicin should be co-
administered with appropriate antibacterial agent(s). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
Posology (of note; only the approved posology relevant for the paediatric population is 
shown below): 
Paediatric population (1 to 17 years of age) 
The recommended dosage regimens for paediatric patients based on age and indication are shown 
below.

In paediatric patients aged 7 to 17 years, Cubicin is given by intravenous infusion over a 30-minute 
period (see section 6.6). In paediatric patients aged 1 to 6 years, Cubicin is given by intravenous 
infusion over a 60-minute period (see section 6.6).

Study P029MK3009: Phase II Open-Label, Single-arm Clinical Trial to study the safety, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetics of MK-3009 (daptomycin) in Japanese paediatric participants 
aged 1 to 17 years with complicated skin and soft tissue infections or bacteremia caused by 
Gram-positive cocci 
Description 
Methods 
Objectives 
The following objectives and main endpoints were evaluated in Japanese paediatric participants with 
cSSTI and bacteremia: 
Study design 
P029 was an open-label, single-arm Phase II study of daptomycin (MK-3009). Japanese paediatric 
participants aged 1 to 17 years old with cSSTI or bacteremia caused by gram-positive cocci as an 
infection type were enrolled into this study. First patient, first visit was 06 December 2018, last 
patient, last visit was 07 April 2020. The Study completion date was 13 July 2020 and data cut-
off/database lock date was 16 July 2020. 
After a maximum duration of 72-hour screening period, eligible participants received a minimum of 5 
days to up to a maximum of 14 days (cSSTI) or 42 days (bacteremia) of IV study therapy. While on 
study therapy, study visits were performed on Day 1 (initiation of IV study drug), Day 3 (on therapy 
visit), and at end of therapy (EOT). Following the completion of IV study therapy, all participants were 
evaluated for 7 days following completion of therapy (at test of cure, TOC visit). In addition, a Follow 
up (FU) visit was performed in all participants at 14 days after completion of IV study therapy. All 
participants remained in the study for a total of up to 31 days (cSSTI) or 59 days (bacteremia).

Study population /Sample size 
Twenty (20) Japanese male and female participants aged 1 to 17 years old requiring intravenous 
antibiotic treatment for cSSTI or bacteremia known or suspected to be caused by gram-positive cocci 
were to be enrolled into the study. Complicated infections were defined as infections either involving 
deep soft tissue or requiring significant surgical intervention (e.g. cellulitis, erysipelas, infected ulcers, 
burns, and major abscesses), or skin and soft tissue infections accompanied by systemic signs and/or 
symptoms where intravenous antibiotic therapy was warranted.  
Due to the difficulty of enrolling paediatric participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, the study 
concluded enrolment with 18 participants, as explained to the Japanese PMDA.  
The patients were to demonstrate at least 3 of the following protocol-defined signs and symptoms 
associated with an ongoing acute infectious process: pain, tenderness to palpitation, temperature 
>37.0°C axillary or >37.5°C oral or >38.0°C rectal, forehead or aural, White blood count (WBC) 
>12,000/mm3 or ≥10% bands, swelling and/or induration, erythema (>1cm beyond edge of wound or 
abscess), pus formation and CRP > Upper Limited of Normal. 
If a participant met both criteria for cSSTI and bacteremia, the participant had to be allocated to the 
group of bacteremia. 
Treatments 
Daptomycin 500 mg formulated as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution was administered once daily 
as IV infusion. The dosing regimen for daptomycin in this study was in accordance with the previously 
approved dosing regiments for the respective indications, which is based on pharmacokinetic (PK) data 
in paediatric subjects, population PK modelling and simulation, and nonclinical effects in juvenile dogs. 
The dose was assigned according to weight and infection type in each age group as indicated in the 
following table: 
According to MAH, it has previously been established that no differences in PK, efficacy or safety occurs 
between Japanese and non-Japanese adults. The approved dose in non-Japanese and Japanese adults 
is identical.

Statistical Methods 
Safety: The APaT population was used for the analysis of safety data. It consisted of all enrolled 
participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. The proportions of participants were 
calculated for broad clinical and laboratory AE categories [e.g., any AE, a drug-related AE, a serious AE 
(SAE), a drug-related SAE, discontinuation of study treatment due to an AE], as well as specific AEs 
(system organ classes and preferred terms).  
Efficacy: The primary population for efficacy analysis was the modified intent-to-treat (MITT)-MRSA 
population consisting of those participants with positive culture of MRSA at baseline. MRSA was the 
target pathogen of the Japanese adult indication. MRSA was defined with MIC test in the central 
laboratory (oxacillin 4 μg/mL or more).  
At the TOC (and EOT) visit, the investigator determined the participant’s clinical response based on 
consideration of the participant's signs and symptoms compared with those present at baseline.  
At the TOC (and EOT) visit, the participant’s microbiological response was derived from the pathogen-
level microbiological response for all of the participant’s baseline infecting pathogens and from the 
presence or absence of a superinfecting pathogen or new infecting pathogen (gram-positive cocci).  
The proportions of participants achieving clinical success and microbiological success, respectively, 
were calculated by visit, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals by the method of Clopper 
and Pearson.   
Clinical pharmacology: The population for PK analysis included all enrolled participants who received at 
least 3 consecutive IV infusions of daptomycin, had at least one PK sample following treatment 
administration on the PK sampling day and did not have any important protocol violations affecting the 
PK profile.  
After initiation of IV treatment, PK sampling was scheduled for day 3: pre-dose, after 15 minutes, 1 hr, 
4 hrs and 12 hrs after the end of infusion for all subjects. No clinical PD measurements were collected. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax (μg/mL), Tmax (hr), C12hr (μg/mL), AUC0-24hr (μg*hr/mL), t1/2 
(hr), CLss (mL/hr), CLss/wt (mL/hr/kg), Vss (mL), and Vss/wt (mL/kg)) were calculated using non-
compartmental PK analysis. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 18 participants (14 with cSSTI and 4 with bacteremia) were enrolled across 12 study sites in 
Japan. No participants were enrolled in violation of the entry criteria. All participants received at least 1 
dose of daptomycin and completed the study. One participant with bacteremia (1 to <2 years old) 
discontinued study medication on Day 5 due to lack of efficacy. This patient also suffered from acute 
myeloid leukaemia and received concomitant systemic antibacterials which were prohibited by the 
protocol (such as e.g., vancomycin and meropenem). Streptococcus oralis was detected from the blood 
culture, and on Day 15 (TOC), the clinical response was “Failure”, and the microbiological response 
was "Eradication". No superinfection or new infection was reported in this subject. 
Of note, 2 participants in the bacteremia cohort had protocol deviations for prohibited medication 
(vancomycin, meropenem and sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim). However, the investigators and the 
sponsor still agreed to allow the use of these treatments. No participant’s data were excluded from 
analyses due to an important protocol deviation.

Baseline data 
The majority of participants (cSSTI: 9/14, 64.3%, bacteremia: 3/4, 75.0%) were male. The median 
age was 7 years and 6 years in the cSSTI and bacteremia groups, respectively. In participants with 
cSSTI, 3 participants were included in each of the age groups 1-<2 years, 2-6 years and 12-17 years, 
while 5 participants were included in the age group 7-11 year. In participants with bacteremia, 2 
participants were included in the age group 1-<2 years and 1 participant in each of the age groups 7-
11 year and 12-17 years (no participant was between 2-6 years). The age range was 1-13 years for 
cSSTI and 1-15 years for bacteremia, thus no participant was above 15 years. Please also see table 
above under “Treatments”. 
The most frequently occurring diagnosis in participants with cSSTI was cellulitis and infected skin ulcer 
(4/14, 28.6% each). The other diagnoses were abscess (2/14, 14.3%), skin infection (2/14, 14.3%), 
wound infection (1/14, 7.1%) and burn infection (1/14, 7.1%). Most participants (cSSTI: 13/14, 
92.9%, bacteremia: 4/4, 100%) had gram-positive monomicrobial infection.  
The most common baseline pathogens were MRSA (6/14 in the cSSTI group, 42.9%) and MSSA (4/14 
in the cSSTI-group, 28.6%). For other pathogens there were only one baseline pathogen identified per 
patient. In the bacteremia group there was no more than one baseline pathogen identified per patient.   
Extent of exposure: In the APaT population, all participants received daptomycin for the protocol-
specified range of 5 through 14 days (cSSTI) or 5 through 21 days (bacteremia). Mean exposure time 
for the cSSTI-group was 6.9 days (SD 2.6) and median 6.0 days (range 5-14 days). In the 
bacteraemia-group, the mean exposure time was 14.3 days (SD 6.7) and median 15.5 days (range of 
5-21 days). 
Efficacy results 
In this study, efficacy outcomes were evaluated as secondary and exploratory endpoints (the latter not 
shown).  
A key secondary efficacy endpoint was the clinical response at TOC in participants with MRSA 
infections. The MITT-MRSA population included a total of 8 participants (7 with cSSTI and 1 with 
bacteremia). In this population, 6 of 7 (85.7%) participants with cSSTI and the sole participant with 
bacteraemia achieved favourable clinical response at TOC, see table below. For 5/7 in the cSSTI group 
and 1/1 in the bacteremia group, the clinical response was “cure”. In the cSSTI group, there was also 
one “Improvement” and one “Failure”. 
Proportion of participants with clinical success by visit (MITT-MRSA population) 
Another key secondary efficacy endpoint was the per-participant microbiological response at TOC in 
participants with MRSA infections. In the MITT-MRSA population, 5 of 7 (71.4%) participants with 
cSSTI and the sole participant with bacteraemia achieved favourable microbiological response at TOC, 
see table below.

Proportion of participants with Microbiological Success by Visit (MITT-MRSA 
population)
When including presumed eradication in addition to confirmed eradication to define favourable 
microbiological response, 6 of 7 (85.7%) participants with cSSTI achieved favourable microbiological 
response at TOC in the MITT-MRSA population. 
Safety results 
In the APaT population (N= 18 paediatric patients), AEs are reported in 55.6% (10/18) of all 
participants; 42.9% (6/14) of participants with cSSTI and 100% (4/4) of participants with bacteremia 
experienced at least 1 AE. All AEs were mild except moderate rash which occurred in 1 participant with 
cSSTI. 2 participants (11.1%) had drug-related AEs.  
The most frequently reported AEs (reported in two or more participants) were pyrexia and rash (n=2 
each). Two participants each experienced one drug-related AE. Platelet count increased occurred in one 
participant (bacteremia, 1–< 2 years) on Day 5 and resolved (duration: 1 week). Infusion site swelling 
occurred in one participant (cSSTI, 12–17 years) on Day 5 and resolved (duration: 3 hours). Both AEs 
were mild, and no action was taken in regard to study medication administration.  
There were no SAEs, deaths and discontinuations of study medication due to an AE reported. 
In this study, Events of clinical interest was defined for hepatic transaminase. In this study, hepatic 
transaminase ECI was defined as AST or ALT ≥3 X ULN and total bilirubin ≥2 X ULN and alkaline 
phosphatase <2 X ULN. One participant with bacteremia, (7–11 years) met the criterion of 
aminotransferase (ALT or AST) elevation. This participant had high aminotransferase values at 
screening period (e.g. ALT ≥10 x ULN and AST 5 to 10 x ULN) and Day 7 (e.g. ALT ≥10 x ULN) and the 
values decreased during treatment period [e.g. ALT (Day 12) and AST (Day 7) < 3 x ULN]. No AEs 
related to liver dysfunction were reported in this participant.  
Chemistry Findings That Met Predetermined Criteria for Change: Regarding creatine phosphokinase 
(CPK), the abovementioned patient also had increased CPK values of 1,026 IU/L (>2.5 to 5 x ULN) on 
Day 1 (screening period) and 1,265 IU/L on Day 3 (treatment period), however, no AEs associated 
with musculoskeletal disorders or abnormal investigations reported. Note that this participant had 
complicated concomitant diseases which included B-cell lymphoma, bone marrow failure and tumor 
lysis syndrome. The MAH states that no clinically meaningful change of CPK over study days was 
observed in any infection types and age categories except the one participant described above.  
The relationship between CPK elevations and daptomycin exposures (AUC0-24hr, Cmax and C12hr) in 
Japanese paediatric participants was evaluated. The MAH claims that the analysis showed no apparent 
relationship between CPK elevations and daptomycin exposure in Japanese paediatric participants. See 
the Pharmacology heading/section for details. 
Otherwise, regarding laboratory values over time, the MAH states that there were no clinically 
meaningful changes from baseline in chemistry and hematology laboratory values. The assessments

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

and observations were comparable across age categories and infection types. No clinically meaningful 
findings were reported from assessments of vital signs, physical and neurological examinations, or 
motor development skills. 
In addition to this study, the MAH states there have been no new safety concerns identified from 
review of the post-marketing experience in paediatric patients; and the safety profile in paediatric 
patients appears similar to the safety profile in adults. 
In conclusion, there were 2 drug-related AEs in 2 participants reported (platelet count increased and 
infusion site swelling), and CPK elevation was observed in one participant (1,265 U/I, 2.5 to 5x upper 
limit of normal range), but IV administration of daptomycin was apparently well tolerated in general 
with no SAEs, deaths, ECIs or AE leading to study medication discontinuation. Based on the results of 
the present study, there do not appear to be any new safety concerns in the paediatric population. 
However, having in mind there is a very limited number of included patients – only 18 of which only 4 
participants with bacteremia - in this study, the results should be interpreted with caution.  
Clinical Pharmacology 
cSSTI population 
In the cSSTI population (N=14), all participants provided 5 PK plasma samples each. The mean AUC0-
24hr and Cmax observed with the age-specific, weight-based doses ranged from 316 to 574 μg*hr/ml and 
49.1 to 91.7 µg/ml, respectively. See table below for presentation by age group.  
A target exposure window for treatment of cSSTI in the paediatric population have previously been 
described (347-641 μg*h/mL). This have been derived from the exposure levels observed in healthy 
volunteers administered the same daily dose as the one approved in the treatment of complicated skin 
and skin structure infections (cSSSI) in adult patients (4 mg/kg). 
Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Daptomycin Following the Administration of 
Multiple 5 to 10 mg/kg Doses in Japanese Paediatric Participants with cSSTI Between the 
Ages of 1 to 17 Years in P029 
The MAH has presented graphically the distribution of individual AUC0-24hr and Cmax for daptomycin in 
cSSTI patients by age group (figure below). The comparison of the different age groups indicates that

in Japanese cSSTI paediatric patients, the AUC0-24hr and Cmax tend to increase slightly with younger 
age.

over 30 or 60 minutes in Japanese Paediatric Participants with cSSTI Aged 1 to 17 Years, 
with Stratification by Age Group. Source: Clinical study report Figure 11-2.  
Bacteremia population 
In the bacteremia population (N=4), three participants provided 5 PK samples, while one provided two 
PK samples. The Rapporteur could not find any explanation in the study report for the patient only 
providing two PK samples. Due to the limited number of patients included in the bacteremia 
population, individual values are presented, see table below.  
The dosing regimen for treatment of bacteremia in paediatric patients has previously been selected to 
ensure AUC exposures within the range of safe and efficacious exposures reported in adults treated 
with 6 mg/kg for bacteremia (270-1151 μg*h/mL).

Exposure-safety relationships 
One safety concern with daptomycin is elevation of CPK, hence the relationship between CPK 
elevations and daptomycin exposures (AUC0-24hr, Cmax and C12hr) was evaluated graphically. The MAH 
states that no apparent relationship was shown between CPK elevations and daptomycin exposure in 
Japanese paediatric patients (see figure below). The MAH concludes that the potential increase in CPK 
is not expected to be clinically relevant.

As mentioned in the section above, Safety Results, one patient with bacteremia had elevated CPK-
values, 1,026 IU/L (>2.5 to 5 x ULN) on Day 1 (screening period) and 1,265 IU/L on Day 3 (treatment 
period). The AUC in this patient (599 µg*hr/mL on Day 3) was generally comparable to those from 
other participants with bacteremia, and according to the MAH, it should be noted that this patient also 
had concomitant diseases including B-cell lymphoma, bone marrow failure and tumour lysis syndrome. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In the EU, Cubicin is already approved for paediatric patients (1 to 17 years of age) with complicated 
skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTI; in 2015, EMEA/H/C/0637/II/053/G) and for bacteraemia 
associated with cSSTI (in 2017, EMEA/H/C/0637/II/061).  
The MAH has now submitted a paediatric study performed in Japanese children in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006. 
The doses selected in the study were identical to the paediatric doses for Cubicin as already approved 
in the EU. Of note, 2 of 4 participants in the bacteraemia cohort had protocol deviations for prohibited 
medication, making it difficult to conclude on the efficacy of daptomycin in these patients. However, 
considering the very low total number of bacteremic patients, no firm overall conclusions can in any 
case be drawn. Besides, efficacy was not the primary objective in this study. 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of daptomycin in 
paediatric Japanese patients. No SAEs, deaths, ECIs or AE leading to study drug discontinuation were 
reported, and no new safety signals were identified in this study, recognizing the limited number of 
patients included which precludes detecting possible uncommon and rare events. 
Evaluation of steady state pharmacokinetics of daptomycin was a secondary objective of this study. 
Exposure in paediatric Japanese patients tend to increase slightly with younger age. The Rapporteur 
has not identified similar trends of age-dependent daptomycin exposure in previous paediatric studies 
but as the MAH points out, the PK data in the current study are limited and trends should be 
interpreted with caution. The exposure of daptomycin across the age range studied are still within the 
previously determined target exposure windows and comparable with AUC0-24hr and Cmax determined in 
previous studies in the paediatric population. Additionally, t1/2 and CLss/Wt of daptomycin observed in 
this study is consistent with previous observations in the paediatric population. According to the 2009 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/158534/2021  
Page 13/14 
 
 
 
 
 
Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), pharmacokinetic characteristics in special 
populations should be described in section 5.2 of the SmPC. Since there seems to be no apparent 
difference in exposure between the currently studied Japanese paediatric population and previously 
studied Caucasian subjects, the findings are considered to be clinically relevant and should be included 
in the Cubicin SmPC (see section 3. for proposed wording).  
Based on the limited number of subjects included, there seems to be no apparent correlation between 
CPK elevations and investigated PK measures (AUC0-24hr, C12, and Cmax), which is in line with previous 
findings (C12 and Cmax). 
The results based on the limited number of 18 paediatric Japanese patients from study P029MK3009 
appear to be consistent for efficacy and safety with those from patients obtained in previous clinical 
trials with Cubicin. 
On the basis of this study, there is no change in the benefit-risk profile of Cubicin for the existing 
indications. However, an amendment in section 5.2 of the SmPC is proposed, to include relevant 
information to the clinicians that the PK are similar across the races studied, in order to generate 
increased confidence in the extrapolation of the current dosing regimen established in one population 
to other populations. According to the SmPC guideline section 5.2. c), characteristics in specific groups 
of patients should be described. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
Although limited, the data provided in this submission are not considered to raise any safety or efficacy 
concerns for daptomycin in the paediatric population. Hence, the benefit/risk balance remains 
unchanged and positive in the approved indications at present.  
Based on these results the MAH proposed no amendments to the basic prescribing information or in 
the RMP. This is not completely endorsed and an amendment in section 5.2 of the SmPC is 
recommended, with the wording provided below. 
  Fulfilled: 
In view of the new data regarding pharmacokinetics in the Japanese population, the SmPC (section 
5.2.) should be updated to include the following recommended wording: 
Race 
No dosage adjustment is necessary in Japanese subjects. After administration of the recommended 
dose in 18 Japanese paediatric subjects (1-15 years), exposure was similar across the age range as 
previously observed in Caucasian paediatric subjects. 
The MAH should either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 or provide a justification for not doing so. This should be provided without any delay and no 
later than 60 days after the receipt of these conclusions.

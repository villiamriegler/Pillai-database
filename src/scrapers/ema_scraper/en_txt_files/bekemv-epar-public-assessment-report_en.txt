1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Amgen Technology (Ireland) Unlimited Company submitted on 3 March 2022 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Bekemv, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“BEKEMV is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH). 
Evidence of clinical benefit is demonstrated in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of 
high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1).” 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(4) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to applications for biosimilar medicinal products. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, chronic, life-threatening blood disorder associated 
with anaemia due to haemolysis. Haemolysis can result in a range of debilitating consequences such as 
severe fatigue, chest pain, and transfusion dependence, all of which contribute to the heavy disease burden 
and reduced quality of life (QoL) these patients experience. Even with C5 inhibitor treatment, 72% of 
patients with PNH remain anaemic and 36% require 1 or more transfusions per year (McKinley et al. 2017). 
If left untreated, PNH can cause severe and potentially fatal complications for patients. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
PNH has an annual incidence of 1-10 new cases per 1 million individuals. The median age of diagnosis is in 
the early thirties; it affects men and women in equal proportions and has no clear ethnic or geographic 
preferences (Stern and Connell 2019). 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 9/113 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
PNH is associated with a high burden of disease. The most prevalent symptoms are fatigue (80%), dyspnea 
(64%), and haemoglobinuria (62%). PNH commonly results in clinically significant hematologic consequences 
from chronic haemolysis including a marked increase in risk of thromboembolism, which may ultimately lead 
to target organ damage and death (Schrezenmeier et al. 2014). 
2.1.4.  Management 
To most effectively manage PNH, both IVH and EVH need to be controlled. This is reflected in improvements 
across the following key markers of disease activity: haemoglobin level, LDH level, ARC, bilirubin level, 
transfusion requirements, and FACIT-Fatigue score. The C5 inhibitors eculizumab and ravulizumab have 
increased survival and improved outcomes in PNH by controlling IVH, reflected in LDH improvements; 
however, C5 inhibitors do not control EVH. In many patients treated with C5 inhibitors, although LDH is 
largely controlled, ARC and bilirubin levels remain elevated, indicative of ongoing haemolysis. Pegcetacoplan 
(Aspaveli) has been recently approved and binds to complement protein C3 and its activation fragment C3b 
with high affinity, thereby regulating the cleavage of C3 and the generation of downstream effectors of 
complement activation. 
2.2.  About the product 
ABP 959 (eculizumab, the proposed name Bekemv) is developed by Amgen Inc. as a biosimilar product to both 
Soliris-EU and Soliris-US.  
Eculizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high 
affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal 
complement complex C5b-9. Eculizumab preserves the early components of complement activation that are 
essential for opsonisation of microorganisms and clearance of immune complexes. 
In PNH patients, uncontrolled terminal complement activation and the resulting complement-mediated 
intravascular haemolysis are blocked with eculizumab treatment. 
In most PNH patients, eculizumab serum concentrations of approximately 35 micrograms/mL are sufficient for 
essentially complete inhibition of terminal complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis. 
In PNH, chronic administration of eculizumab resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in complement-
mediated haemolytic activity. 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA25 
The claimed therapeutic indication is similar to the indication of Soliris for the treatment of PNH as the market 
exclusivity period for Soliris’s PNH indication ended in June 2019: 
Bekemv is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH). 
Evidence of clinical benefit is demonstrated in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) 
indicative of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 10/113 
 
 
 
Soliris is also indicated in the treatment of atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS), refractory 
generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-
positive, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), but these indications are still protected by 
orphan exclusivity. This application addresses the PNH indication, including paediatric patients and patients 
not yet stable on eculizumab (i.e., naïve PNH patients). 
In this AR, the name ABP 959 is used for the biosimilar candidate. For the reference product, the name Soliris 
is used. For EU-authorised Soliris, the name Soliris-EU, and for FDA-licenced Soliris, the name Soliris-US is 
used. 
Excipients 
Unlike Soliris, Bekemv contains sorbitol (a type of carbohydrate) as one of its inactive ingredients, while 
Soliris does not. The function of excipient sorbitol is to provide suitable tonicity and maintain the stability of 
the product. However when given intravenously Sorbitol may cause serious harm in patients with HFI who 
lack the enzyme needed to break it down. 
For this reason, doctors should exclude HFI before starting treatment. As HFI may not yet be diagnosed in 
children under 2 years of age ) (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/information-
package-leaflet-regarding-fructose-sorbitol-used-excipients-medicinal-products-human-use_en.pdf), Bekemv 
is also contraindicated in this population. Therefore, Bekemv is contraindicated in patients with hereditary 
fructose intolerance (HFI), a very rare genetic condition, and in children under 2 years of age as follows   
“BEKEMV is contraindicated in subjects with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). Prior to initiating treatment 
HFI should be excluded on age-appropriate clinical grounds (see section 4.4). 
BEKEMV is contraindicated in babies and children below 2 years of age since they may not yet be diagnosed 
with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) (see section 4.4).” 
Additional risk minimisation measures have also been introduced to mitigate this risk, consisting of the 
following educational materials: physician’s guide, patient’s/parent’s information brochure, and patient safety 
card. The target audience and planned distribution path for the controlled distribution and vaccination 
reminder also include pharmacists dispensing the drug in addition to prescribing physicians. The risk titled 
“Sorbitol exposure in patients less than 2 years of age” from RMP has been modified to appear as “Serious 
metabolic harms due to sorbitol exposure in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance” in version 0.5 of 
the EU RMP.

2.3.2.  Active Substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
The active substance (AS) eculizumab (also referend in this report as ABP 959) is a recombinant humanised 
monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin isotype class G 2/4 (IgG2/4) subclass, that binds to human 
complement component 5 (referred to C5) with high affinity and inhibits its cleavage, thereby blocking pro-
inflammatory and cytolytic effects of terminal complement activation. Activation of the complement protein 
C5 by C5 convertase initiates the spontaneous assembly of the late complement components, C5b-C9, into a 
structure known as the membrane attack complex (MAC), or terminal complement complex (TCC), which is 
the final step in the complement cascade.  
ABP 959 is expressed in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. ABP 959 contains 36 total cysteine 
residues, which are involved in both intra-chain and inter-chain disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain contains 
448 amino acids with 4 intra-chain disulfides. Each light chain contains 214 amino acids with 2 intra-chain 
disulfides. Each heavy chain contains an N-linked glycan at a consensus glycosylation site on asparagine 298.  
A schematic depiction of the ABP 959 molecule displaying the most prominent disulfide mediated structural 
isoform (IgG2-B) is shown in Figure 1, including the antigen-binding fragment (Fab), hinge, and fragment 
crystallizable (Fc) regions, the expected IgG2 disulfide bonding pattern, and the glycosylation sites observed 
for ABP 959. 
Figure 1 A schematic depiction of the ABP 959 molecule 
The theoretical mass is 144 981 Da. The predominant glycan moiety is A2G0F, thus, the theoretical mass of 
glycosylated ABP 959 containing 2 predominant glycans (1 A2G0F per heavy chain) is 147 869 Da. 
ABP 959 has been developed as a biosimilar to the reference product Soliris, originally approved in the EU in 
June 2007 (EMEA/H/C/000791).

2.3.2.1.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
ABP 959 is produced at Amgen Singapore Manufacturing (ASM). The respective GMP certificates are included 
in dossier. 
The process steps follow a standard monoclonal antibody platform technology. Upstream process consists of 
several cell expansion steps and a harvest step In the downstream process the harvested cell culture fluid is 
purified using a series of chromatography purification steps.. All manufacturing steps are adequately 
described and flow-charts with process controls are provided, including critical input process parameters and 
critical in-process tests.  
Control of materials 
Information on the source of the cell substrate and analysis of the expression construct used to develop the 
Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) is adequately described. Chinese hamster ovary cells 
were used to generate the transfected cell line. The ABP 959 amino acid sequence was derived from publicly 
available information on the amino acid sequence of Soliris (eculizumab). The synthesised DNA was then 
inserted into an expression vector pDC323 to generate the eculizumab expression plasmids, separately for 
heavy and light chain. Origin and function of expression vector components are adequately described, and 
sequences of heavy and light chains are provided. Production of the active substance during development 
and creation of MCB and WCB utilises selection process of single cell clone, which is described adequately.  
A common two-tiered cell banking system consisting of a Master Cell Bank and Working Cell Bank, is used. 
The genetic stability of the production cell line is demonstrated. The presented protocol for the qualification of 
future working cell banks is acceptable. Overall, the cell banking system, including characterisation and 
testing is adequately described and in line with ICH Q5D.  
Constituents of the culture medium are described in satisfactory detail. No raw materials of animal origin are 
used in the manufacturing process. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
Critical parameters controlled by in-process controls (IPCs) include quality related testing for glycosylation 
and fragmentation, pH, osmolality, host cell protein (HCP), polysorbate and protein concentration. 
Safety/microbiological related critical controls include parameters such as Mycoplasma, adventitious virus, 
pH, filter integrity, bioburden and endotoxin. The applicant has explained the criteria for the choice of the 
criticality of a process parameter and control. In the process design studies, the applicant has explained the 
establishment of the acceptable process parameter ranges. Relevant process parameters are set to control 
the manufacturing process. Process validation studies support the established process parameters.  
Process validation and/or verification 
Process validation data from commercial scale batches is provided. The established process parameters and 
process indicators met the predetermined criteria. The process validation results support the control strategy 
and demonstrate that the manufacturing process is able to produce AS with desired quality. 
Small-scale characterisation studies were conducted to evaluate the chemical stability of in-process product 
pools utilising commercial analytical methods. According to these studies, hold times were set and are 
considered acceptable.  
Reprocessing at the AS filtration step has been validated. Reprocessing is conducted in the same manner as 
the original AS filtration using a new filter. Description of conditions for which reprocessing could be applied

and data to demonstrate demonstration that the reprocessing step does not impact on the quality of the 
active substance is provided and thus, reprocessing considered acceptable.  
Filter validation studies were conducted both by the filter provider and by the applicant; it can be concluded 
based on the provided information that the filter can be regarded suitable for its intended use and the filter 
do not decrease the quality of the finished product (FP). 
Validation was performed and is ongoing to demonstrate the effectiveness and chromatography performance 
over the lifetime of the resins. The lifetime of the membranes is validated and the approaches are acceptable. 
Concerning the transportation of AS, the company has qualified insulated shipping containers comprised of 
various sizes and durations. A short summary of the qualification programme is provided in the dossier. 
Based on provided results, the transportation of the AS can be performed without impact to product quality 
during validated period at controlled conditions. 
Manufacturing process development 
ABP 959 was initially manufactured at the Amgen process development facility (. The AS manufacturing 
process was subsequently transferred to the clinical manufacturing facility (to generate lots to support the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) similarity Study 20150164. 
To enable long-term frozen storage and to facilitate future development, the AS formulation was changed to 
a different protein concentration and the manufacturing process was subsequently transferred to ATO CMF to 
generate lots to support the clinical similarity Study 20150168. 
The AS manufacturing process was transferred to Amgen Singapore Manufacturing (ASM) for commercial 
manufacturing. Comparability assessments included lots manufactured at the proposed commercial scale i.e. 
2000 L scale. Phase- and risk-based comparability evaluations were performed as appropriate to support 
manufacturing changes. The development of the manufacturing process and the comparability studies 
conducted are adequately described. The applicant has performed comparability studies concerning 
manufacturing site and formulation changes. Overall, comparability between manufacturing sites and 
composition change is adequately performed and acceptable.  
Characterisation 
Characterisation studies were performed using commercial scale and process active substance material or FP 
material. Both the AS and FP lots were in the final commercial formulation. The clinical representativeness 
(material used in characterisation vs. clinical material) was shown. Characterisation results includes 
determination of structure (primary, secondary, and higher-order), glycosylation (N- and O-linked glycans), 
disulfide structure, charge variants, size variants and hydrophobic variants. Biological characterisation of ABP 
959 was conducted to assess the structure-function properties of the molecule. These included demonstration 
of the mechanism of action, assessment of Fc functionality, and assessment of the in vitro biological activity 
of stressed ABP 959 and product variants. Overall, the performed characterisation studies are considered 
relevant and cover a wide variety of physicochemical and biological characterisation studies. Justification of 
the identification and classification of the product-related impurities can be agreed. 
Impurities 
Product-related impurities/substances as well as process-related impurities have been identified. Impurities 
are characterised at sufficient level. Biological activities of the product-related impurities/substances and 
safety aspects were discussed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 14/113 
 
 
 
 Process-related impurities (host cell proteins (HCP), DNA, residual protein A and process reagents) were 
observed in low levels and the presented data demonstrate that the manufacturing process for commercial 
production is able to clear process-related impurities to acceptable levels.  
Control of mycoplasma and adventitious viruses were assessed in section A.2. Adventitious agents safety 
evaluation. 
Elemental impurities and potential risk of nitrosamines were assessed in the finished product part of the 
dossier. 
Container closure system 
The AS container closure system (CCS) is a bag with associated lines and has been adequately described.. 
Sterility is according to ISO 11137. The specification and a representative certificate of analysis are available. 
Integrity of the CCS was confirmed by microbial aerosol challenge test.  
The applicant has performed various pharmacopoeial tests for the container closure system including 
biological reactivity, physicochemical tests, bacterial endotoxins, particulates and sterility. Test results 
comply with the limits. Additionally, the applicant has performed extractables and leachables studies. the 
levels are below the permitted daily exposure (PDE) for both extractables and leachables; all leachables were 
below the concentration of toxicological concern.  
In summary, the CCS is considered suitable and the presented information adequate. 
2.3.2.2.  Specification 
The AS release and shelf life specifications presented in Table 1, include tests for physical characteristics 
(physical appearance, colour), identity (immunoassay), purity and impurities (SE-UHPLC, HCP), adventitious 
agents (bacterial endotoxins, bioburden) and potency (bioassay). 
The end-of-shelf-life specification is identical to the release specification, except for certain parameters which 
have been justified sufficiently as not necessary for end of shelf life. The acceptance criteria have been 
established based on product-specific knowledge and release/stability data that have been used in 
development, clinical, process validation, stability and comparability studies. Batch analysis results from AS 
lots used in clinical studies (meet the current commercial specification results and thus are considered 
representative for setting specifications and clinically justified. The applicant applied a statistical analysis to 
estimate ranges (tolerance intervals) that was considered acceptable.  
Overall, the set of quality attributes tested at release and at shelf-life complies with ICH Q6B and are 
acceptable.  
Analytical procedures 
For the in-house methods, system suitability and sample acceptance criteria (SE-HPLC, HCP-ELISA, potency, 
bioburden) are provided, relevant reagents and equipment listed and representative chromatograms (SE-
HPLC/HMW, UHPLC/Glycan map) provided. Overall, the used analytical methods are adequately described. 
Validation of the analytical procedures are adequately performed. For the potency testing an enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format is used.. 
Reference standards  
The reference standards used during the product development to routine batch release use have been 
adequately described. A two-tiered reference standard system is used for commercial manufacturing 
including primary reference standard (PRS) and working reference standards (WRS). The WRS is used for 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 15/113 
 
 
 
routine lot release and stability testing. A protocol for qualification of future reference standard is presented. 
The protocol is found acceptable. 
Batch analyses 
Batch analyses data were presented for batches manufactured with the PBS formulation (development, 
clinical and stability studies), and for batches manufactured with the sorbitol formulation (development, 
clinical and stability studies). All results comply with the specifications valid at time of testing and also 
comply with the current valid specifications 
2.3.2.3.  Stability 
The applicant proposed a shelf life of 48 months for ABP 959 stored at the recommended storage condition of 
-30°C. 
Real time stability data for 48 months at -30°C is provided for three batches with the current proposed 
sorbitol formulation. For the same batches, also stability data for 6 months at 5°C and for 3 months at 25°C 
is provided. Additionally, stability data up to 24 months is provided for one batch for the same conditions as 
for the 3 batches. For the commercial production site ASM (Amgen Singapore) 18 months data is provided for 
all three storage conditions. Stability study results are ready and available for all sites at storage conditions 
5°C and at 25°C.  
The container closure system used for the primary stability batches are smaller but otherwise identical to the 
container closure system used during commercial manufacturing. Comparability between different AS 
manufacturing sites has been shown. The test methods and acceptance criteria used during clinical 
development for the supporting, primary, and production lot stability studies are same as presented and 
validated (sections S.4.2 and S.4.3). Specifications used for the initial evaluation of the proposed shelf life 
differ slightly from the proposed commercial specifications, but were later confirmed with the current 
proposed commercial specifications.  
All samples stored at the recommended storage condition (-30°C) met the stability acceptance criteria. At 
accelerated conditions, moderate changes in parameters were detected. Based on the presented stability 
study results, the proposed shelf-life with storage conditions can be approved. Overall, the stability results 
indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The stability 
results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months years when stored at -30 ºC. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Bekemv is a sterile, single-use, preservative-free concentrate for solution for infusion that is clear to 
opalescent and colourless to slightly yellow, intended for dilution prior to intravenous infusion, containing 300 
mg eculizumab. The FP is supplied in a glass vial with elastomeric stopper, and aluminium seal with flip-off 
cap. Each vial contains a 30 mL deliverable volume of 10 mg/mL eculizumab (ABP 959) formulated in 10 mM 
acetate, 0.05 mM disodium edetate (EDTA), 5% (w/v) sorbitol, and 0.01% (w/v) polysorbate 80 at pH 5.2.  
References to quality standards (Ph.Eur , USP or NF) have been provided for excipients. ABP 959 (in contrast 
to the reference product) contains sorbitol. The use of the specific excipient is acceptable from a quality point 
of view. However due to safety considerations in relation to patients with hereditary fructose intolerance 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 16/113 
 
 
 
(HFI) the CHMP recommended that the applicant should explore the possibility of developing a new sorbitol-
free formulation (REC). The safety issue related to sorbitol-content and especially the paediatric population is 
discussed in the Clinical safety section. 
Three formulations were used during product development, these include a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 
formulation, a sorbitol formulation and the commercial sorbitol+EDTA formulation. The FP is produced by 
dilution of the 90 mg/ml AS to 10 mg/ml with a formulation buffer consisting of acetate, EDTA , sorbitol, and 
polysorbate 80 at pH 5.2. 
PBS and sorbitol formulations have been used in Phase 1 clinical study, the non-clinical and phase 3 clinical 
study was conducted using the sorbitol formulation.  
The commercial Sorbitol+EDTA formulation used in development, process validation and stability studies, but 
not in clinical studies. Adequate comparability studies have been performed between sorbitol and 
sorbitol+EDTA formulations. The studies have included batch analytical data, additional characterisation and 
forced degradation studies of four pre- and two post-change lots manufactured at ATO. Based on the 
presented results the FP formulated with sorbitol+EDTA has a similar or improved stability profile compared 
to the sorbitol only formulation. 
Comprehensive process characterisation studies have been conducted to evaluate the robustness of the 
manufacturing process. The studies demonstrate that the manufacturing process is under control and can 
deliver the required product quality and process consistency when operated within acceptable ranges. 
The presented studies of batch analytical results, additional characterisation and forced degradation study 
data are considered sufficient to support comparability of the FP sorbitol and sorbitol+EDTA formulations. 
A process design approach has been used to develop the FP manufacturing process. This was based on prior 
knowledge, data of reference product including other mAb manufacturing processes experience, ABP 959 
process development studies and the results of process risk assessments. The FP manufacturing process is 
controlled by process parameters, in-process controls (IPCs), release specifications, and periodic testing 
controls of the AS and FP (e.g. validation, comparability and stability). The control strategy is based on 
knowledge of product quality attributes (PQAs), quality risk management used to identify potential risks to 
patients and a subset of PQAs identified as critical quality attributes (CQA).  
The development manufacturing process of FP, selected formulation and container closure system has been 
justified and sufficiently described.  
The compatibility of the ABP 959 FP with commonly used PVC and polyolefin IV bags, infusion systems and 
solutions (0.9% sodium chloride, 5% dextrose and Ringer’s solution) has been studied at different 
temperatures (room temperature +5oC and +30oC). ABP 959 FP remained stable, however, more particles 
(>10 µm) were detected in PVC IV bag of ABP 959 FP stored in 0.9% sodium chloride and in Ringer’s solution 
in comparison to polyolefin IV bag at room temperature and +30oC. ABP 959 in 5% dextrose showed similar 
particulation in both PVC and polyolefin IV bags. ABP 959 in 5% dextrose showed similar low particulation in 
both PVC and polyolefin IV bags. The detected particle increase, related to infusion solutions used for 
dilution, infusion bags and catheters remain at acceptable levels in accordance with USP and Ph. Eur. limits. 
The FP is supplied in a 30 cc Type I glass vial, elastomeric stopper, and aluminium seal with flip-off cap. A full 
description of the container closure components including representative drawings are presented in the 
dossier. The vial and stoppers are in compliant with the Ph. Eur. Inorganic and organic extractables have 
been analysed against acceptable exposure level, the presented results for the leachables and extractables

meet the specifications. Container closure integrity has been demonstrated by vacuum decay method. From 
the quality point of view the container closure is considered suitable. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The FP is manufactured by Amgen Ireland (ADL). The same site performs, packaging, labelling and batch 
release testing, with the exception of Belgium and Luxembourg markets where the release testing is 
performed by Amgen Belgium (NV). During the procedure a major objection was raised concerning the GMP 
status of ASM which was resolved by provision of a valid GMP certificate; valid GMP certificates have been 
presented for all other FP manufacturing and testing facilities. 
The FP manufacturing process includes preparation of formulation buffer, AS thaw, FP formulation, bioburden 
reduction filtration, filtered formulated FP hold, sterile filtration, filling and stoppering, capping, inspection, 
and storage. The process steps have been described with sufficient detail and the batch formula has been 
clearly presented.  
The process steps are controlled by process parameters and in-process testing. Process parameters with 
limits are presented for each step. In-process control testing with action limits is used for monitoring of the 
manufacturing process to ensure that FP will conform to its specifications. IPCs which should be controlled 
within a defined range to ensure finished product quality are designated as critical. Critical in-process controls 
with action limits have been set for formulation, bioburden reduction filtration and sterile filtration with action 
limits. In addition to IPCs, some in-process tests have been designated as real time release testing (RTRT) 
i.e. testing performed in-process that is listed on the specification and has an acceptance criterion. Real time 
release testing and limits are presented for protein concentration, osmolality, pH, polysorbate 80 
concentration, volume and appearance. Protein concentration in the FP is analysed by RTRT during 
formulation step. Down-stream process includes several filtration steps that could indirectly react with active 
substance and reduce the concentration of FP. The provided studies show that there was no meaningful 
difference in the protein concentration between the formulation step and the release testing of filled vials. 
Process parameters and acceptance criteria set are overall adequately justified by validation studies.  
The RTRT parameters, methods and limits were presented. The process parameters and acceptance criteria 
set are overall adequately justified by validation studies. 
The FP manufacturing process has been successfully validated at the commercial site. Validation has included 
steps for formulation, filtration, filling, stoppering, capping, inspection, and storage for the vial presentation. 
All validation batches met the release results of the proposed commercial specification acceptance criteria. 
The proposed batch size range has been successfully validated, demonstrating consistency and reliability of 
the manufacturing process. Sufficient information is provided on filter validation and media fills. Validation 
has included membrane compatibility, microbial retention, and extractable substance determination. 
The microbial control strategy and chemical stability data have been discussed to support the proposed AS 
post-thaw hold time.  
Shipping validation is supported by three studies, shipping container qualification, post-transport verification 
of maintaining of product quality and monitoring of the transport route, duration and thermal performance. 
The shipping validation results confirm that the product quality is maintained.

2.3.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications, includes tests for physical characteristics (physical 
appearance, colour, clarity), identity (immunoassay), purity and impurities (SE-UHPLC, HCP, (AEX-HPLC, 
rCE-SDS and HIC-HPLC), adventitious agents (bacterial endotoxins, closure integrity, sterility) and potency 
(bioassay), protein concentration (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), osmolality(Ph. Eur.), subvisible particles (Ph. 
Eur.), Polysorbate 80 (UV), EDTA (chromatography) and volume (Ph. Eur.).   
A sufficient panel of quality attributes is proposed for release and shelf-life specifications. The specifications 
of FP include the same parameters, analytical tests and acceptance criteria as AS specifications with 
additional tests of FP for clarity, purity and impurities, sterility, closure integrity, protein concentration, pH, 
osmolality, subvisible particles, Polysorbate 80 and volume.  
Separate limits are proposed at release and shelf-life for all the purity tests included in the FP specifications 
document. The proposed limits for the purity tests are found clinically qualified and supported by batch data 
for ABP 959 and/or by means of Soliris.  
As requested, the EDTA concentration has been added to the FP specifications as a real-time release test. The 
FP specifications have for most parts remained similar for FP batches manufactured at ATO and ADL.  
Real time release testing is performed for protein concentration, osmolality, pH, Polysorbate 80 
concentration, volume and appearance. EDTA concentration, bioburden and filter integrity and volume are 
critical in-process controls. 
The non-compendial analytical methods for identity (ABP 959 ID ELISA), purity & impurities (AEX-HPLC, SE-
UHPLC), rCE-SDS, HIC-HPLC, container closure integrity), potency (inhibition of TCC formation assay), 
general methods (Polysorbate 80) and EDTA were presented and have been validated in accordance with the 
ICH Q2 Guideline. Summary of validation of non-compendial analytical methods are presented in the dossier. 
The compendial methods have been verified according to the appropriate Ph. Eur. chapters and determined 
to be suitable for use. The presented batch analysis data show that the FP process does not result in any 
additional impurities. In addition, AS and FP lots are monitored during shelf life for product-related 
impurities. 
The risk of elemental impurities in the finished product is low and meets the threshold outlined in the ICH 
Q3D guideline. No further actions or additional controls are required. The conclusions of the applicant are 
based on the totality of the following evidence and are endorsed.  
Risk assessment has been performed to rule out elemental and nitrosamine impurities of FP covering 
manufacturing process and equipment, excipients (USP, NF, and/or PhEur), container closure system and risk 
of oxidation. The absence of the masking effect over time for the FP was demonstrated. The principles outlined 
in the “Assessment report Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004” 
(EMA/369136/2020)” were applied in the risk assessment. In conclusion, no significant risk of nitrosamine 
impurities has been identified for ABP 959 finished product and therefore, no additional control measures are 
deemed necessary. 
Batch analytical data has been provided for lots manufactured. All lots met the acceptance criteria in place at 
the time of release. The provided results indicate that the manufacturing process is under control and the 
changes made in the manufacturing processes have not affected on the quality of the FP.

2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 36 months has been proposed for Bekemv stored at the recommended storage condition of 
5°C. 
Stability data were presented for FP stored at long-term (5±3°C), accelerated (25±2°C, 30±2°C and 
30±2°C/ 60% to 70%) and at stressed conditions (40±2°C) for maximum of 48, 6 and 3 months 
respectively.  
Real-time data of 30 and 24 months at the long-term condition are currently available for Sorbitol+EDTA FP 
batches. Stability data of 3 months are presented for commercial Sorbitol+EDTA batches. Long-term stability 
studies show that the FP is stable at the proposed storage conditions. Supporting data of 48 months is 
presented for Sorbitol formulation. The applicant commits to continue the ongoing stability studies described 
in 3.2.P.8.1 until completion. 
FP stability studies were conducted in accordance with ICH Q5C and Q1A. Adequate stability indicating test 
methods, acceptance criteria and studies are presented in the dossier. The parameters and test methods of 
stability studies are a sub-set of the FP specifications.  
In addition, forced degradation, photostability (as per ICH Q1B) and transportation studies have been 
performed. The photostability studies demonstrated that the secondary packaging effectively protects the FP 
from degradation. No meaningful differences were observed for any of the tested parameters under either 
ICH or clinical lighting conditions.  
Studies were performed to evaluate compatibility during dilution for infusion and storage in polyvinyl chloride 
and polyolefin IV bags, and a second study was conducted to evaluate compatibility during infusion over the 
intended duration using common IV administration components and equipment (infusion sets, heparin locks, 
catheters, and infusion pump). The conclusions of these studies are reflected in section 6.3 of the SmPC. 
Formulation robustness and transport studies have been performed to show the effectiveness of polysorbate 
80 to prevent the formation of particles during stress and long term stability studies. Visible and subvisible 
particle results remained within the specification acceptance criteria through the proposed shelf life of 36 
months at the recommended (5 oC). In addition, no trend has been observed in the subvisible particles 
results at the recommended (5 oC), accelerated (25 oC or 30 oC), or stressed (40 oC) storage conditions. 
Based on these studies “BEKEMV vials in the original package may be removed from refrigerated storage for 
only one single period of up to 7 days. At the end of this period the product can be put back in the 
refrigerator” (SmPC 6.4). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years with the storage conditions “Store in a 
refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. Store in the original package in order to protect from light.” as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
2.3.3.5.  Biosimilarity 
A comprehensive similarity exercise following the general principles outlined in the guideline on similar 
biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance; Quality issues 
(EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012) has been performed. The strength, dosage form, dosing regimens, and 
route of administration of ABP 959 are the same as for the reference medicinal product. The analytical 
similarity assessment consists of 3 pairwise comparisons including Bekemv to Soliris-EU, Bekemv to Soliris-
US, and Soliris-EU to Soliris-US. The FP material used in the analytical biosimilarity studies is considered

representative of the material used in clinical trials. . The statistical approach chosen by the applicant to 
analyse similarity assessment is endorsed. Tabular and graphical presentation allows for a clear comparison 
of Bekemv to Soliris-EU and Soliris-US. In addition, sufficient raw data has been provided to allow 
assessment of biosimilarity independently of statistical approach chosen.  
The comparative testing included analysis of biological activity, primary structure, higher order structure, 
particles and aggregates, product-related substances and impurities, and general properties including protein 
concentration and volume. In addition, stressed and accelerated stability studies as well as photodegradation 
studies were performed between Bekemv and Soliris-EU.  
Similarity between Bekemv, Soliris-EU and Soliris-US has been demonstrated for the following 
physicochemical and biological properties:

Overall, similarity in terms of primary 
structure was demonstrated. 
Secondary and tertiary structure appear 
comparable.  
ABP 959 and EU-approved Soliris are similar 
in their protein concentration. 
Minor differences between ABP 959 and EU

based on the characterisation results 
presented, it can be concluded that the slight 
differences observed in charge variants are 
clinically insignificant. All variants are 
biologically active. The applicant has 
appropriately discussed and justified the 
differences detected in ABP 959 and EU-
approved Soliris to support the similarity. 
ABP 959 was shown to have minor 
differences in afucosylation, galactosylation 
and sialylation levels compared to EU-
approved Soliris, but it has been sufficiently 
justified that these differences are highly 
unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
Minor differences in the levels of post-translational modifications, relative proportion of the charge variants, 
individual glycan species, levels of glycation, and levels of monomer, HMW, LMW, HC+LC and were 
sufficiently justified to have no clinical impact. 
Overall, appropriate analytical methods have been utilised to ensure an understanding of the Soliris-EU and 
Soliris-US product profiles and the developed Bekemv product. In conclusion, the presented biological and 
physiochemical data support the claim of biosimilarity for Bekemv.  
The applicant informed that six of the 42 subjects in the clinical efficacy/safety trial were enrolled at clinical 
sites in Great Britain using locally-sourced finished product. Batches were purchased for the study 20150168 
UK clinical sites during/after the end of the Brexit period. All but one of these batches were manufactured 
prior to the end of the transition period. According to the applicant, the origin of the shipment, i.e. the 
country originating the shipment to the clinical site, is Ireland while the clinical site receiving and dosing the 
batch is UK. Furthermore, all batches used in the UK clinical sites after 31 December 2020 were labelled with 
the EMA authorisation number. 
The applicant has provided analytical and functional bridging data between EU-Soliris and the batches used at 
the UK clinical site after the end of the Brexit transition period. Based on the results it can be concluded that 
analytical and functional bridging between EU-Soliris and the Soliris batches used at the UK clinical site has 
been demonstrated.   
Overall the FP material used in the analytical biosimilarity studies is considered representative of the material 
used in clinical trials. The approach chosen to analyse similarity assessment is endorsed. ABP 959 is 
considered to be highly similar to EU-approved and US-approved eculizumab with respect to the presented 
physicochemical and biological characterisations. In addition, in the context of a global development, 
acceptable bridging between US-approved eculizumab and the EU reference medicinal product has been 
presented, supporting the use of both US-approved eculizumab and EU approved eculizumab in the clinical 
trials. In conclusion, it is considered that biosimilarity of Bekemv to the reference product Soliris has been 
sufficiently demonstrated.

2.3.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
None of the materials used in the manufacturing process contain any material human or animal origin. There 
is no risk form Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) or viral contamination. 
Viral clearance studies have been conducted in accordance with the guidance given in ICH Q5A, as well as in 
other relevant guidelines. Four model viruses have been chosen for the studies: XMuLV (enveloped RNA 
retrovirus), MMV (non-enveloped RNA parvovirus), Reo-3 (non-enveloped RNA reovirus) and PrV (enveloped 
DNA herpesvirus). The selected viruses cover adequate range of properties, including size, genome, and 
resistance to low pH inactivation. The choice of model viruses is considered appropriate. Four process steps 
have been assessed using qualified small-scale models operating under worst-case conditions,. The small-
scale models have been described in the dossier and are qualified. The feed material used in the small-scale 
viral clearance studies was obtained from lots that are representative of the AS process at the commercial 
site (ASM). Lifetime of chromatography resins for viral clearance capacity has been evaluated for new and 
used resins. 
The risk of microbial and mycoplasma contamination is adequately addressed. MCB, WCB, and (limit of in 
vitro cell age) LIVCA are sterile and free of mycoplasma, and tested unprocessed bulk batches showed very 
low bioburden of zero CFU/mL. Finally, the assessment of TSE risk has been performed on all raw materials 
used to produce ABP 959, from transfection of the cell line through fill and finish of the FP. The 
manufacturing process uses no excipients, cell culture media, or purification material of animal origin 
Acceptable assessment of TSE risk has been performed on cell line and raw materials used to produce AS and 
FP. No excipients, cell culture media components, or purification resins containing animal material are used 
during manufacture. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In general, the active substance part of the dossier is of good quality. An MO raised concerning the GMP 
status of a testing site has been resolved by provision of a valid GMP certificate. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product have been presented in an 
appropriate manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics. Overall, the available quality data support biosimilarity versus EU-
approved Soliris. The safety issue related to sorbitol-content is discussed in the Clinical safety section.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to the sorbitol-content. This point is put forward and agreed 
as recommendations for future quality development. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Satisfactory information has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- the applicant should explore the possibility of developing a new formulation without sorbitol. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The active substance of ABP 959 and Soliris is eculizumab, a humanised recombinant immunoglobulin isotype 
class G subclass 2/4 kappa monoclonal antibody (IgG2/4K mAb). Eculizumab binds to human complement 
component 5 (C5) and prevents its cleavage into C5a and C5b, thereby blocking the generation of the 
terminal complement complex and cell lysis.  
ABP 959 is expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) and Soliris in a murine myeloma cells. 
The demonstration of biosimilarity of ABP 959 to Soliris-EU is based on the totality of evidence data of 
analytical, nonclinical, and clinical comparative studies to demonstrate structural and functional similarity. A 
single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) similarity study in healthy adult male subjects 
(Study 20150164) have been conducted as well as a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, 2-period 
crossover comparative clinical study in adult subjects with PNH (Study 20150168).  
The nonclinical data package consisted of in vitro biofunctional assays,– Biological Activity, and ex vivo 
pharmacology characterisation studies in human serum to support a demonstration of similar inhibition of the 
complement pathway (relevant to the mechanism of action) by ABP 959 and the Soliris-US and Soliris-EU.  
No comparative in vivo pharmacology, PK/toxicokinetic, or toxicology studies were conducted. There were no 
residual uncertainties identified that needed to be resolved by additional nonclinical pharmacology, PK/TK, or 
toxicology studies. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The biological activities of ABP 959 and Soliris-EU were evaluated with in vitro and ex vivo assays relevant to 
MoA of eculizumab. The similarity assessment consisted of 3 pairwise comparisons ABP 959, Soliris-EU and 
Soliris-US. 
In vitro studies 
Fab-mediated biological activity analyses included inhibition of terminal complement complex (TCC) 
formation, inhibition of haemolysis, binding affinity and kinetics to component 5 (C5). Binding specificity i.e., 
lack of binding to other complement factors, was demonstrated to component 3 (C3) and to first 
subcomponent of the C1-complex of the classical pathway of complement activation (C1q). 
Eculizumab is an IgG2/4, therefore lacks or has low level of binding to FcγRs and thus a lack of effector 
functions is expected. Binding (or lack of) to FcγR type Ia, IIa, IIb, IIIa and IIIb, and to FcRn was similar with 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 24/113 
 
 
 
APB 959 and Soliris-EU. No ADCC, CDC or ADCP assays were conducted, and are not required. Fc-mediated 
functions in general are not considered to mediate the pharmacological action of eculizumab.  
In general, the functional data indicate that the ABP 959 and Soliris-EU (and US-sourced) are similar. 
Biological activities relevant to the primary mechanism of action including inhibition of TCC formation, 
inhibition of haemolysis, C5 binding -, binding kinetics and affinity to human C5, and binding specificity are 
similar. To conclude, Fab-mediated biological activity analyses indicated similar inhibition of TCC formation 
and haemolysis, and relative binding activity to C5 for ABP 959 and Soliris-EU. Binding specificity, i.e., lack of 
binding to C3 was demonstrated, and to first subcomponent of the C1-complex of the classical pathway of 
complement activation (C1q). Binding to FcRn was similar for ABP 959 and Soliris-EU. 
Ex vivo haemolytic studies 
Comparative pharmacology ex vivo haemolytic studies included evaluation of the classical pathway (CH) and 
alternative pathway (AH) using ABP 959 or Soliris-EU or Soliris-US. Studies were conducted to evaluate the 
ability of ABP 959 and Soliris (EU and US) to inhibit complement pathways in models of various physiological 
and pathophysiological conditions in clinically relevant assays.  
Comparative ex vivo haemolytic studies evaluating the inhibition of classical and alternative pathways in 
human serum indicated similar inhibition potency of ABP 959, Soliris-US and Soliris-EU.  
2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed.  
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies were conducted given no residual uncertainties in the comparative analytical 
similarity assessment inclusive of comprehensive in vitro functional evaluation, and supplementary 
comparative ex vivo pharmacology studies.  
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic interaction studies were not conducted given Soliris (eculizumab) has been administered 
to patients treated concomitantly with a broad range of commonly used medications and no safety issues 
have arisen. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Comparative in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK)/toxicokinetic studies with ABP 959 and Soliris were not conducted 
and are not required. The lack of these types of studies is justified, and is in line with relevant guidelines for 
biosimilars, on basis that studies in animals for demonstrating biosimilarity are generally more insensitive 
than in vitro studies, and no differences indicating potential effects on PK was noted in in vitro binding 
analyses to FcRn. Moreover, eculizumab is specific to human C5 and does not inhibit C5 in species commonly 
used in nonclinical studies.

2.4.4.  Toxicology 
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies were not conducted given the lack of a pharmacologically relevant species and is 
also in alignment with regulatory guidance for biosimilar development. 
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies were not conducted (same ground applies as stated under 2.4.4.1). 
2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies were not conducted in alignment with regulatory guidance for biosimilar and 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceutical development. 
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted in alignment with regulatory guidance for biosimilar and 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceutical development.  
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were not conducted in alignment with regulatory guidance 
for biosimilar development Eculizumab has same mode of action in children and in adults, and no studies are 
required for this biosimilar MAA in addition to already existing data on approved Soliris-EU. 
2.4.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Not applicable.  
2.4.4.7.  Local tolerance  
Local tolerance studies were not conducted in alignment with regulatory guidance for biosimilar development. 
2.4.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Toxicology Assessment of Excipients in the ABP 959 Commercial Drug Formulation 
ABP 959 has the same dosage form, route of administration and product strength as the reference product, 
Soliris-EU; it is formulated with different compendial excipients that include acetate, sorbitol and disodium 
edetate. Both the ABP 959 commercial formulation and Soliris-EU contain polysorbate 80, but at different 
concentrations. The differences in excipients between ABP 959 and Soliris do not represent a safety concern 
or raise uncertainties regarding similarity. None of the ABP 959 formulation excipients are novel. ABP 959 is 
formulated with well-known, compendial excipients that have been administered by the same route of 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 26/113 
 
 
 
administration (IV) at higher dose levels in other drugs approved for use in adult and paediatric populations 
in the EU (and US). 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance (ABP 959, eculizumab) is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the 
concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, ABP 959 is not expected to pose 
a risk to the environment.  
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical data package was focused on comprehensive in vitro and ex vivo functional activity analyses 
relevant for eculizumab MoA. No in vivo pharmacology, PK/TK, or toxicology studies were conducted and are 
not generally required for a biosimilar for the approval of the marketing authorisation within EU. This 
approach was also agreed by CHMP Scientific Advice (given during 2015, Procedure No. EMEA/H/SA/3164/ 
1/2015/III). 
The in vitro data is only shortly summarised under nonclinical aspects. ABP 959 differs from Soliris-EU 
regarding the formulation and cell-line, in which the DS is produced (CHO in ABP 959, NS0 in Soliris-EU). The 
functional comparative data demonstrated that inhibition of TCC formation and haemolysis, binding kinetics 
and affinity to human C5, binding specificity (i.e., lack of binding to other complement factors C3, C1q) and 
binding to FcRn are similar for ABP 959 and Soliris. Furthermore, binding (or lack of) to Fc-R type Ia, IIa, IIb, 
IIIa and IIIb was similar. Similar inhibition potency for alternative pathway and classical pathway was 
demonstrated for ABP 959 and Soliris-EU ex vivo.  
ABP 959 three formulations PBS, sorbitol, and sorbitol with EDTA (which is intended formulation for 
registration) have all been included in the in vitro functional comparative programme. Ex vivo studies were 
done in sorbitol formulation. The formulation changes are not expected to impact the clinical performance of 
ABP 959. ABP 959 contains following changes in the formulation in excipients in comparison to Soliris-EU; 
sorbitol, PS80, EDTA and acetate. None of these excipients are novel and have been used in other registered 
products in EU, administered same route (IV) and are not exceeding the amounts in medicinal products 
approved for IV-treatment of adult and paediatric patients. The safety of EDTA and sorbitol was adequately 
clarified. Due to the high sorbitol content of the product, a contraindication was added for subjects with 
hereditary fructose intolerance. 
The active substance (ABP 959, eculizumab) is a natural substance (protein), the use of which will not alter 
the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, ABP 959 is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment.  
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical in vitro and ex vivo functional activity data support the biosimilarity of ABP 959 versus the 
Soliris-EU (and Soliris-US).

219 subjects, 2 subjects discontinued the study before infusion, thus, 217 subjects were treated with investigational product and completed 
the infusion. 
b Does not include screening period. 
c Due to restricted distribution of eculizumab, some clinical sites used locally sourced eculizumab and some clinical sites used eculizumab 
centrally sourced by Amgen. In either case, only US-licensed or European Economic Area-authorised reference medicinal product was used 
in the study. The utilisation of eculizumab (US) or eculizumab (EU) was supported by data from analytical and functional similarity studies in 
addition to PK/PD data from Study 20150164, which establish the requisite scientific bridge between eculizumab (US) and eculizumab (EU) 
to justify the relevance of data generated with each product and support the requirements for a marketing application.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
ABP 959 is developed by Amgen Inc. as a biosimilar product to both Soliris-EU and Soliris-US.  
The pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of ABP 959 has been investigated in two clinical studies (i.e. phase I 
study 20150164 in healthy male subjects and phase III study 20150168 in subjects with paroxysmal 
nocturnal haemoglobinuria [PNH]).  
Analytical methods 
Pharmacokinetics 
Two electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay methods were developed and used to determine total (eluted) 
and unbound (free) serum concentrations of ABP 959 and eculizumab (US and EU) in serum samples from 
PK/PD similarity study 20150164 and from comparative clinical study 20150168. Both methods were 
validated according to ICH guidance including accuracy, precision, robustness, ruggedness, selectivity, 
specificity, parallelism, Hook effect and stability. Validation reports and bioanalytical reports including ISR 
were provided. In the pivotal PK study 20150164 the original method validation was performed. Those results 
are using a validated method. The result of study 20150168 is considered supportive but not confirmatory of 
similar efficacy, therefore it is not required to perform cross validation with drug substance batches used in 
all the clinical studies. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Commercially available Wako Autokit CH50 was used in PK study 20150164 and CH50 haemolytic assay was 
used in the comparative clinical study 20150168. Plasma lactate dehydrogenase assay was also used to 
assess lysis as a primary endpoint. 
Wako Autokit CH50 is an automated homogenous liposome-based assay for total complement activity in 
human serum. The method was validated according to ICH guidance and manufacturer’s instructions as 
appropriate.  
The haemolytic assay CH50 is measured based on lysis of antibody-coated sheep red blood cells (EA) due to 
the activation of complement on the cell’s surface. Patients with PNH are known to have higher than normal 
levels of haemolysis and higher than normal circulating haemoglobin levels. Therefore, a control for 
endogenous haemoglobin levels was run in parallel with the haemolytic assay and subtracted from the CH50 
assay to obtain the final CH50 result. The method was validated for precision, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity 
and stability. The results below the LLOQ were included in the similarity assessment of the two treatment 
groups and taking into account the low CH50 values; this is considered appropriate. 
Immunogenicity 
For Study 20150164 and Study 20150168, samples were evaluated for binding ADAs using a 2-tiered 
immunoassay that consisted of a screening assay and a confirmatory assay. A validated ECL bridging 
immunoassay was used to detect anti-drug antibodies. All samples positive for binding ADAs were assessed 
for neutralizing antibodies using a target binding assay.

Clinical PK/PD study 20150164 in healthy male subjects 
The study was conducted at two centres in Australia between 10 May 2016 and 26 Mar 2017.  
Free and total serum concentrations of eculizumab were determined using a single validated 
electrochemiluminescent assay. Eluted eculizumab samples were analysed between 26 July 2016 and 04 Apr 
2017 and free eculizumab samples were analysed between 21 Sept 2016 and 05 Apr 2017.  
The study was a phase I, randomised, double-blind, single-dose, 3-arm, parallel group study in healthy male 
subjects. Demographic and baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the 3 treatment groups. The 
study aimed to recruit a minimum of 16% (i.e. n = 12/treatment group) first- or second-generation Japanese 
subjects in order to meet Japan PMDA requirements.  
Each subject received either a single 300 mg (one vial of 30 ml contained 300 mg of eculizumab [10 mg/ml]) 
IV infusion (35 ± 5 minute) of ABP959, Soliris-EU, or Soliris-US (in a ratio of 1:1:1 stratified by clinical 
pharmacology unit [CPU] and ethnicity [Japanese vs non-Japanese]) in the morning on Day 1 after a light 
low-fat breakfast. 
PK blood samples were collected at pre-dose, at scheduled time points during the study, and at the end of 
the study.

 
The primary PK endpoint: AUCinf. 
The secondary PK endpoints: AUClast, Cmax, t1/2, tmax 
PK results 
All 217 subjects, who received study drug, were included in all PK analysis populations (PK parameter 
population was as the primary analysis population); 71 (100%) subjects in the ABP 959 treatment group, 
72 (100%) subjects in the Soliris-US treatment group, and 74 (100%) subjects in the Soliris-EU treatment 
group. 
The mean serum total concentration-time profiles following a single 300-mg IV infusion were similar and 
overlapped for all 3 treatments over the entire course of sampling (see Figure 2).

90% CIs of the LS GMR of both the primary PK parameter AUCinf and the secondary parameters of Cmax and 
AUClast, for the comparisons of ABP 959 to Soliris-US and ABP 959 to Soliris-EU were fully contained within 
the pre-specified equivalence criteria of 0.80 to 1.25. Additionally, PK similarity was demonstrated between 
Soliris-US and Soliris-EU, thus establishing the PK component of the scientific bridge between Soliris-US and 
Soliris-EU.

Source: Modified from Table 14-9.5.1.1 in CSR 20150164 
Clinical comparative efficacy and safety study 20150168 in adult subjects with PNH 
To assess PK was the secondary objective. 
PK endpoints: eculizumab (total and free) AUC from week 13 to week 15, and trough concentrations. 
PK sampling timepoints: at baseline on day 1/visit 1/ week 1, pre-dose (trough) at scheduled time points 
during the study, and at the end of the study.  
Bioanalytical site was the same as in the study 20150164. Total and free eculizumab concentrations were 
measured by the electrochemiluminescent methods. 
PK results 
PK concentration analysis set included 42 subjects and PK parameter analysis set contained 37 subjects (ABP 
959/Soliris n = 18 and Soliris/ABP 959 n = 19). The reason for the exclusion of 5 subjects from the PK 
parameter analysis set was that none of these subjects had evaluable serum concentration profile from 
weeks 13 to 15.  
AUC from week 13 to week 15 
The GMR (90% CI) for the total PK AUC from week 13 to week 15 was 0.9122 (0.7586, 1.0968), which 
demonstrates comparable PK between the treatment groups in subjects with PNH (see Table 5).

Modelling and Simulation to Confirm the Appropriateness of a 300 mg IV Dose of Eculizumab 
Originator and Biosimilar ABP 959 to Detect Differences in PD Response as Measured by CH50  
The primary objectives of ABP 959 population pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy subjects were: 
1. To estimate the PK/PD properties of ecu-US and ecu-EU (“originator”) and ABP 959 (“biosimilar”), with a 
focus on the concentration-response relationship with CH50 (total complement activity) of each compound.  
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 38/113 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. To simulate PK/PD profiles for hypothetical trials of originator and biosimilar at different dose levels, with a 
focus on CH50 profiles and variability.  
3. To evaluate if dose levels other than 300 mg have equivalent or worse ability to detect difference in CH50 
response. 
Source data collected in Study 20150164 included demographics, dosing information, PK sampling 
information, clinical laboratory values, and other covariate information. Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling 
software (NONMEM) was used for population PK and PK-PD modelling. 
A one-compartment model with the quasi-equilibrium approximation to the full target-mediated drug 
disposition model was selected for the Base PK model. Covariates for the population PK and PK/PD model 
included baseline body weight, baseline CH50, baseline C5, age and race. The following covariates were 
found to satisfy the inclusion criteria with forward addition and backward elimination significance levels of 
0.01 and 0.001, respectively: Baseline C5 predicted baseline free target concentrations and the half-life of 
free target; bodyweight predicted eculizumab volume of distribution and the half-life of free target; and race 
(white or non-white) predicted eculizumab volume of distribution.  
For the CH50 PD model, no hysteresis was noted between free or total drug concentration, free and total 
ligand and drug:ligand complex, and CH50. As such, a direct-effect model was implemented for CH50. Free 
and total drug, free and total ligand, and drug:ligand complex were assessed as drivers for changes in CH50. 
Free eculizumab was implemented as a predictor of CH50 response. Subject baseline weight, baseline age, 
baseline C5 concentration, race and treatment (ecu-US, ecu-EU or ABP 959) were tested as covariates by 
forward addition (p=0.01) and backward subtraction (p=0.001). The only parameter-covariate relationship 
included was baseline C5 on IC50. 
Simulations of 100, 200, 300 and 600 mg doses of Soliris-US, Soliris-EU and ABP 959 were performed using 
the PK/PD model and estimates gained from these analyses. Final parameter estimates from the full PK and 
full PD model were used to simulate individual-level model parameters that included between-subject and 
within-subject variability. Bioequivalence testing per protocol was performed on these simulated CH50 
activity data and the percent of simulated trials where bioequivalence was correctly declared was calculated 
for each dose level.  
The point estimate and 90% CI of each of the three-hundred (300) replicate trials for each of the four (4) 
simulated dose levels are pooled for each of the three (3) treatment arms. Generally, the variation in mean 
and 90% CI values increased with decreasing dose, and the majority of 90% CI’s lied outside the [80, 125] 
boundary for the 100 mg cases. 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mode of action of eculizumab has been established. Eculizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that 
binds to the human C5 complement protein (C5). C5 is a soluble protein and is central to all pathways of 
complement activation. C5 is cleaved by C5 convertase, producing C5a, which is a ligand for the 
inflammatory receptor C5aR, and C5b, which is a necessary component in the formation of the membrane 
attack complex, which mediates cell lysis. Eculizumab binds to human C5 in the region of the protein that 
becomes C5b, and blocks cleavage, thereby inhibiting the complement cascade and ultimately blocking 
terminal complement mediated intravascular haemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) 
patients.

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Clinical PK/PD study 20150164 in healthy male subjects 
The co-primary endpoint of the PK/PD study 20150164 was to demonstrate PD similarity as assessed by area 
between the effect curve (ABEC) of 50% total haemolytic complement activity (CH50) of ABP 959 compared 
with FDA-licensed eculizumab (Soliris-US) and EU-authorised eculizumab (Soliris-EU). The residual functional 
activity of C5 can be screened using a CH50 assay. The CH50 parameter relates to the amount of test serum 
required to cause 50% haemolysis; therefore, a decrease in CH50 is a sensitive measure of reduced C5 
functional activity. 
CH50 in serum collected from healthy subjects was evaluated by a liposome immunoassay using the 
commercially available Wako Autokit CH50. The method was validated according to ICH guidance and 
manufacturer’s instructions as appropriate. The assay range was 10-60 U/ml and the sensitivity was 
sufficient for healthy subject population.  
The sampling times, derivation of ABEC of CH50 and its statistical analysis methods are considered adequate. 
A total of 217 subjects were included in the PD analysis population (all subjects who received any amount of 
investigational product and who had at least 1 reported CH50 value); 71 (100%) subjects in the ABP 959 
treatment group, 72 (100%) subjects in the Soliris-US treatment group, and 74 (100%) subjects in the 
Soliris-EU treatment group. Four subjects terminated the study too soon for their CH50 data to have returned 
to baseline (although the maximal reduction in CH50 levels was captured for these subjects). Therefore, the 
CH50 profiles for these subjects could not be fully characterised and these 4 subjects were excluded from the 
PD Parameter (n=213), Per Protocol PD Parameter (n=213), and PK/PD (n=213) Populations. 
The results of the study demonstrated PD similarity between ABP 959 and Soliris-US and Soliris-EU (Table 7). 
The 90% and 95% CIs of the least squares geometric mean ratio (LS GMR) of the ABEC of CH50 for the 
comparisons of ABP 959 to Soliris-US and ABP 959 to Soliris-EU were contained within the prespecified 
margin of 0.80 to 1.25, indicating similar inhibition of C5 activity.

Similar results were observed for the Japanese and the non-Japanese subgroups (data not shown). 
The applicant has not performed studies on dose-response or dose finding, or effects of age or genetic 
polymorphism on PK/PD relationships. Since this is a biosimilar development, this is acceptable and studies in 
these aspects are not required.  
Clinical comparative efficacy and safety study 20150168 in adult subjects with PNH 
CH50 was a secondary endpoint in the phase 3 study 20150168. Given that most PNH patients, during stable 
maintenance treatment, would be expected to have CH50 levels below the detection limits of the assay used 
to evaluate CH50 in serum from healthy subjects in the PK/PD similarity study 20140164, a CH50 haemolytic 
assay was developed for use in Study 20150168 in order to address previous EMA feedback concerning CH50 
detection limits in PNH subjects enrolled in the study. 
Total Complement (%) is calculated as the percent of the lower limit of human reference range (LLN) for all 
CH50 values, including those under the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) The mean values were below the 
LLOQ at baseline in both groups, but thereafter the mean value increased above LLOQ in the 
ABP959/eculizumab group. Nevertheless, values below LLOQ were frequent in both treatment groups. 
At baseline, 4 subjects in the ABP 959/Soliris treatment group had higher total complement (CH50) values 
prior to ABP 959 dosing that remained high throughout the treatment period, which resulted in slightly higher 
mean values for the ABP 959/Soliris treatment group vs. Soliris/ABP 959 group through the crossover in 
treatment at week 53. Of note, CH50 values for these subjects remained high following the switch to Soliris 
at week 53. Hence, the noted difference might not reflect a difference between medications but could be due 
to a difference between individual subjects. Time course of CH50 is given in Figure 6.

CH50 = 50% total haemolytic complement activity. Total Complement (%) is calculated as the percent of the lower limit of 
human reference range of 58 U/mL for all CH50 values, including those under the lower limit of quantification of 10.72 
U/mL. The limit of detection for the assay is 0 U/mL.

Additional boxplots were generated in order to further characterise the PK trough concentration-CH50 
response relationship using data from Study 20150168. The figures support a correlation between CH50 and 
trough PK levels, with higher trough PK levels (both unbound and total) correlating with lower CH50 values 
for both treatment groups. As shown in the boxplots, the majority of subjects maintained low CH50 values 
throughout the study. However, there were several subjects with higher CH50 values (figure not shown). 
Lower trough unbound concentrations were observed in the subjects with higher CH50 values (figure not 
shown). 
Upon request, the applicant further generated line plots for the four individual subjects with high CH50 value 
through end of study (EOS) in the ABP 959/Soliris treatment group. The line plots demonstrate inverse 
correlation of CH50 levels with unbound (data not shown) and total trough eculizumab concentrations. In 
three subjects, there was no clear pattern of different concentrations of eculizumab during treatment with 
ABP 959 vs. Soliris. However, in one subject, there was a change during the study. Most of the duration of 
Period 1, i.e., during treatment with ABP 959, concentrations of eculizumab are high and CH50 is suppressed. 
However, during Period 2 of the study (starting prior to the switch and during treatment with Soliris), the 
eculizumab concentrations are lower and CH50 higher. This subject also suffered from serious adverse events 
during the study: chronic heart failure with acute exacerbations requiring hospitalisation and cholecystitis 
that could not be surgically treated due to patient’s general condition and persisted causing recurrent need 
for hospital treatment.  
The applicant also generated scatter plots showing inverse relation of CH50 with unbound and total 
eculizumab concentration (figures not shown).  
Further, the applicant was requested to analyse CH50 results using the same methodology as was used for 
the primary lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) endpoint for controlling confounders, although the analysis is for 
the parallel Period 1 of one year instead of Weeks 13 to 27. Baseline (week 1) total complement (CH50) was 
included as a covariate and proved to be a significant predictor of CH50 results over Period 1 (although the 
model assumption of baseline CH50 being equally predictive of all post-baseline CH50 values through Week 
53 may not be appropriate). Based on the treatment main effect, the baseline adjusted CH50 values at the 
beginning of Period 1 were, on average, approximately 20% higher in patients using ABP 959 as compared 
with those using Soliris, but this difference was somewhat reduced over time.

The applicant provided a listing of trough serum concentration of eculizumab, CH50 and LDH (data not 
shown). However, the association of eculizumab trough concentration with LDH levels did not seem to be as 
clear as the relation of eculizumab trough concentration with CH50 values. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of ABP 959 was investigated in two clinical studies (i.e. a pivotal phase I PK/PD study 
in adult, healthy male subjects [study 20150164] and a comparative clinical study in adult subjects with PNH 
[study 20150168]). In study 20150164, eculizumab was administered as a single IV infusion of 300 mg 
subtherapeutic dose (the choice of dose has been supported by CHMP in scientific advice). In study 
20150168, the dose of 900 mg (the dose used for the treatment of PNH) was administered as IV infusion 
every 14 days. Period 1 was 52 weeks (parallel treatment) and period 2 was 26 weeks starting at week 53 
(crossover treatment). In the pivotal PK/PD study (i.e. study 20150164) and in the comparative clinical 
efficacy and safety study (20150168), different formulations of the test ABP 959 product have been used. 
Consequently, the applicant was asked to discuss the impact of formulation differences on the administration 
of ABP 959 and on the PK of eculizumab. In the response, the applicant provided data on different analytical 
comparability assessments and the functional similarity studies between 3 different ABP 959 formulations 
(PBS, sorbitol, and sorbitol + EDTA) and it can be concluded that the formulation changes have had no 
impact on the PK of eculizumab. 
Analytical methods 
Pharmacokinetics 
Two ECL assay methods were developed and used to determine serum concentrations of ABP 959 and 
eculizumab (US and EU) in serum samples from PK/PD similarity study 20150164 and from comparative 
clinical study 20150168. Both methods were validated according to ICH guidance including accuracy, 
precision, robustness, ruggedness, selectivity, specificity, parallelism, Hook effect and stability. Validation 
reports and bioanalytical reports including ISR were provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 43/113 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamics 
Commercially available Wako Autokit CH50 was used in PK study 20150164 and CH50 haemolytic assay was 
used in the comparative clinical study 20150168. Plasma lactate dehydrogenase assay was also used to 
assess lysis as a primary endpoint. LDH was determined with a photometric method by Medpace Refence 
Laboratories. 
Wako Autokit CH50 is an automated homogenous liposome-based assay for total complement activity in 
human serum. The method was validated according to ICH guidance and manufacturer’s instructions as 
appropriate.  
In the haemolytic assay CH50 is measured based on lysis of antibody-coated sheep red blood cells (EA) due 
to the activation of complement on the cell’s surface. Patients with PNH are known to have higher than 
normal levels of haemolysis and higher than normal circulating haemoglobin levels. Therefore, a control for 
endogenous haemoglobin levels was run in parallel with the haemolytic assay and subtracted from the CH50 
assay to obtain the final CH50 result. The method was validated for precision, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity 
and stability. However, most patient samples were below the quantitation limit, and these values were 
included in the similarity analysis between the treatment groups. Although the applicant has used an 
unconventional approach in the analysis, it can be concluded that the similarity of the treatment groups has 
been demonstrated.  
Immunogenicity 
For Study 20150164 and Study 20150168, samples were evaluated for binding ADAs using a 2-tiered 
immunoassay that consisted of a screening assay and a confirmatory assay. A validated ECL bridging 
immunoassay was used to detect anti-drug antibodies. All samples positive for binding ADAs were assessed 
for neutralizing antibodies using a target binding assay. 
Upon request the applicant generated additional validation data to support the drug tolerance. Based on 
these new validation data, ADA could be detected in majority (38/42) of the subjects in study 20150168. 
Thus, the previously drawn conclusion on ADA is considered supported in these subjects. 4 subjects had 
trough total drug concentrations above the drug tolerance threshold at all time points, resulting in 
inconclusive data. However, these 4 subjects were distributed equally across the treatment groups. The 
immunological similarity between the RMP and Bekemv has been demonstrated. This is supported with 
similar quality attributes potentially related to immunogenicity (like protein aggregates, impurities), and lack 
of eculizumab induced immunogenicity that would affect efficacy and safety.  
Pivotal clinical PK/PD study in healthy, adult male subjects (20150164) 
The primary PK endpoint AUCinf was based on PK samples collected up to day 57. The 57-days covered more 
than 5 times the reported mean t1/2 of eculizumab (~ 11 days) and was long enough to characterise the 
whole PK profile of eculizumab. All subjects’ AUClast covered over 80% of AUCinf. 
No subjects had pre-dose eculizumab concentrations. 
On the basis of the provided PK data for total eculizumab in PK parameter population, the primary 
(i.e. AUCinf) and secondary PK endpoints (i.e. AUClast and Cmax) seemed to be quite similar between ABP 959, 
Soliris-EU and Soliris-US. The 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios were within the criteria of 0.80 to 1.25 
in all comparisons of Soliris-EU versus ABP 959 based on total eculizumab concentrations. Some differences 
could be seen in Cmax in where the geometric LS mean of Soliris-US was slightly higher than that of ABP 959 
and Soliris-EU with the 90% CI of the respective comparisons excluding unity. As per the CHMP Clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 44/113 
 
 
 
pharmacology and pharmacokinetics: Q&A document “7.1 What are the key pharmacokinetic considerations 
in the assessment of biosimilarity (updated May 2020)”, instances where the 90% CI excludes unity would 
require further discussion. In this case, however, the instance is not considered to raise concerns: The 
exclusion of unity by the 90% CI can plausibly be associated with lower variability than anticipated (e.g. CV 
of the AUCinf 16-19% vs. assumed 40%) and, consequently, an indication of nominally statistically significant 
PK difference between the products that is unlikely clinically relevant. The 90% CIs were well within the pre-
specified acceptable criteria of 80-125%. 
The proposed approach to evaluate the possible type I error inflation by simulation is endorsed. The 
simulations should be performed such that the maximal possible type I error inflation can be identified in a 
reliable way. In the analysis of equivalence, the confidence intervals should be adjusted accordingly. 
However, adjustment of the confidence intervals is not requested, as 90% confidence intervals are well within 
the acceptance criteria. 
Assessment of free eculizumab concentrations was strongly encouraged by the CHMP 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/674462/2015/III) and the applicant has followed the advice. 
The 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios were also within the BE criteria of 0.80 to 1.25 in all comparisons 
of Soliris-EU versus ABP 959 based on free eculizumab concentrations. The 90% CI of free eculizumab AUCinf, 
Cmax and AUClast of Soliris-US versus other products excluded unity, similar to the finding of total eculizumab 
Soliris-US Cmax being higher than the Cmax of Soliris-EU and ABP 959.  
In addition to the Cmax and AUClast, t1/2 and tmax were the secondary PK parameters. The t1/2 was on average 8 
days and 96% of the subjects had the tmax at the end-of-infusion (i.e. at 35 minutes) or at 4 hours after the 
end-of-infusion.  
The applicant performed several sensitivity/subgroup secondary statistical analyses in PK parameter 
population. The PK results of these sensitivity/subgroup analyses were quite similar as the primary PK 
results. 
The co-primary endpoint of the PK/PD study 20150164 was to demonstrate PD similarity as assessed by area 
between the effect curve (ABEC) of 50% total haemolytic complement activity (CH50) of ABP 959 compared 
with FDA-licensed eculizumab (Soliris-US) and EU-authorised eculizumab (Soliris-EU).  
PD similarity between ABP 959 and Soliris-US and Soliris-EU was demonstrated. The 90% and 95% CIs of the 
least squares geometric mean ratio (LS GMR) of the ABEC of CH50 for the comparisons of ABP 959 to Soliris-
US and ABP 959 to Soliris-EU were contained within the prespecified margin of 0.80 to 1.25, indicating 
similar inhibition of C5 activity.  
Clinical comparative efficacy and safety study 20150168 in adult subjects with PNH 
The GMR (90% CI) for the total PK AUC from week 13 to week 15 was 0.9122 (0.7586, 1.0968) and for the 
free PK AUC it was 0.9508 (0.7454, 1.2130). Consequently, the AUC from week 13 to week 15 was slightly 
greater to Soliris than to ABP 959 both for total and free eculizumab. The number of subjects was small (n = 
20 in ABP 959/Soliris group and n = 22 in Soliris/ABP 959 group) in the treatment groups and 90% CIs 
include 1.00, so the differences in the AUCs are not of concern.  
Both total and free eculizumab trough concentrations at different timepoints seemed to be quite same level 
and although the lower and upper 90% CI limits of the GMRs were not exactly within the bioequivalence 
range (i.e. 0.80-1.25), all 90% CIs included 1.00. The trough concentrations varied so that at some

timepoints they were higher in the ABP group and at some other timepoints they were higher in the Soliris 
group. 
At baseline, 4 subjects in the ABP 959/Soliris treatment group had higher CH50 values prior to ABP 959 
dosing that remained high throughout the treatment period, which resulted in slightly higher mean values for 
the ABP 959/Soliris treatment group vs. Soliris/ABP 959 group through the crossover in treatment at week 
53. Upon CHMP request, the applicant provided further analyses on the outliers. Consistent with the MoA of 
eculizumab, unbound and total serum concentrations of eculizumab showed a clear inverse correlation with 
CH50 values. Line plots of the four outliers did not show any clear pattern of different response during 
treatment with ABP 959 or Soliris. The applicant did not discuss potential reasons for low trough 
concentrations of eculizumab and high CH50 results in these subjects, e.g., if the subjects have high 
synthesis of C5 that would lead to high C5 concentrations that bind eculizumab and therefore cause low free 
eculizumab concentrations; or if the subjects have higher clearance of eculizumab causing low eculizumab 
concentrations and consequent lesser effect on CH50. One subject had higher concentration of eculizumab 
and better CH50 suppression during most of Period 1, but lower eculizumab concentration and higher CH50 
values from week 48 onwards (starting before switch to Soliris) through end of study. Since the subject had 
serious illnesses potentially affecting eculizumab kinetics and complement activation (unstable heart failure, 
subchronic cholecystitis), no firm conclusions can be drawn from these results. Overall, the provided analyses 
did not indicate any study drug related different response during treatment with ABP 959 or Soliris.  
Upon CHMP request, the applicant analysed CH50 results using the same methodology as was used for the 
primary LDH endpoint for controlling confounders, but for the entire parallel Period 1 instead of the period 
from week 13 to 27. The baseline adjusted CH50 values at the beginning of Period 1 were, on average, 
approximately 20% higher in patients using ABP 959 as compared with those using Soliris, but this difference 
was somewhat reduced over time. Neither the initial level of CH50 nor the trajectory over time differed 
between the treatments to the extent that could indicate statistical or clinical significance. 
Total complement (%) was calculated as the percent of the lower limit of human reference range (LLN) for all 
CH50 values, including those under the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). Values below LLOQ were 
frequent in both treatment groups. These values were included in the similarity analysis between the 
treatment groups. Although the applicant used an unconventional approach in the analysis, it is concluded 
that the similarity of the treatment groups has been demonstrated.  
PKPD modelling and simulation 
The applicant has developed a PK model of total and free eculizumab, and a PD model of eculizumab direct 
(non-delayed) effect on CH50 response. The PK model is considered acceptable, but the PD model uses free 
eculizumab concentrations to predict CH50 response. This approach is problematic because it assumes the 
same free eculizumab concentration to always result in the same CH50 response. However, CH50 response 
measures the functioning of the complement system in body; therefore, mechanistic reasoning suggests that 
it should be free C5, and not free eculizumab, that is used to predict CH50 response. Moreover, eculizumab 
dosing leads to a build-up of C5 because the eculizumab-C5 complex is eliminated more slowly than free C5. 
Because of the build-up of C5, the same free eculizumab concentration will not necessarily lead to the same 
CH50 response at each given timepoint. As such, it is uncertain whether the PK-PD model generalises to 
other dose levels; thus, the specific numbers from the applicant’s simulation of biosimilarity pass rates as a 
function of dose are not considered reliable. However, this does not invalidate the general conclusion that 
lower doses would have a reduced power to detect biosimilarity because of poorer ratio of signal to noise. As 
such, it is not considered necessary to request further PK/PD analyses with a modified PD model structure.

No clinical studies in special populations and no in vitro or in-vivo drug-drug interaction studies were 
conducted with the ABP 959 and this is acceptable. 
ABP 959 is indicated in adults and children only for the treatment of PNH. Consequently, the proposed SmPC 
for the ABP 959 the Section “5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties” is otherwise similar as in the Soliris SmPC; 
however, including only the data for PNH indication and this is acceptable.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pivotal PK/PD study (20150164) for the ABP 959 group with the Soliris-EU and Soliris-US treatment 
groups demonstrated bioequivalence of ABP 959 with Soliris-EU and Soliris-US. Further data on different 
analytical comparability assessments and the functional similarity studies between 3 different ABP 959 
formulations (PBS, sorbitol, and sorbitol + EDTA) confirmed that the formulation changes had no impact on 
the PK of eculizumab. 
Consistent with the mode of action of eculizumab, CH50 correlated inversely with eculizumab concentrations. 
In the phase 3 clinical study 20150168, a great majority of subjects reached good suppression of CH50. 
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The clinical evidence supporting the similarity of ABP 959 to Soliris (eculizumab) includes one completed 
randomised, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel-group, single-dose PK/PD similarity study in healthy adult male 
subjects (Study 20150164) and one completed randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, 2-period 
crossover comparative clinical study in adult subjects with PNH (Study 20150168). 
2.5.5.1.  Dose response study 
No clinical dose-response studies were conducted, and none are required for a biosimilar development. The 
applicant performed modelling and simulation to confirm the appropriateness of a 300mg IV dose of 
eculizumab to detect differences in PD response as measured by CH50 in the PK/PD study 20150164. 
2.5.5.2.  Main study 
Study 20150168: A Randomized, Double-blind, Active-controlled, Phase 3 Study 
Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of ABP 959 Compared with Eculizumab in 
Adult Subjects with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) 
Methods 
The study design is provided in Figure 7 Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive each 
investigational product (ABP 959 or Soliris) in 1 of 2 treatment sequences, either treatment T (test) followed 
by treatment R (reference) (Sequence TR) or treatment R followed by treatment T (Sequence RT). 
Treatments were administered over 2 periods. Period 1 was 52 weeks in duration; Period 2 started at week 
53 with a crossover in treatment and was 26 weeks in duration.  
The end-of-study (EOS) visit occurred 2 weeks (± 2 days) after the last dose of investigational product in 
Period 2.

Figure 7 Study design, study 20150168 
The study was conducted at specialised hospital clinics in Czechia, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the US.  
Central facilities were utilised for 1) clinical laboratory tests performed during all visits after screening, 2) 
total complement (CH50) sample analysis, 3) PK sample analysis, and 4) antidrug antibody (ADA) sample 
analysis. 
•  Study Participants  
Eligible subjects were men and women 18 years of age and older with a historical diagnosis of PNH by 
documented flow cytometry (e.g., type III erythrocyte cells of ≥ 10%) who were stable on eculizumab 
treatment, i.e., administration of eculizumab for ≥6 months and currently receiving 900 mg of eculizumab 
every 14 ± 2 days. Subjects were to have all the following: haemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL for at least 6 weeks 
before randomisation and LDH <1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening, platelet count ≥ 50 x 
109/L, and absolute neutrophil count ≥ 0.5 x 109/L (500 µL). Subjects were to have been vaccinated against 
Neisseria meningitidis. Subjects were excluded from participation if they had a history of known or suspected 
hereditary complement deficiency, had clinically significant cardiovascular disease, had evidence of acute 
thrombosis, or had experienced ≥2 breakthrough events (i.e., signs and symptoms of intravascular 
haemolysis that required dose and/or schedule adjustments of eculizumab) in the previous 12 months before 
screening.  
•  Treatments 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 48/113 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects received either: 
•  Sequence TR: ABP 959 900 mg administered intravenously (IV) every 14 ± 2 days for 52 weeks in 
Period 1 followed by Soliris 900 mg administered IV every 14 ± 2 days for 26 weeks in Period 2, or 
•  Sequence RT: Soliris 900 mg administered IV every 14 ± 2 days for 52 weeks in Period 1 followed by 
ABP 959 900 mg administered IV every 14 ± 2 days for 26 weeks in Period 2  
Soliris sourced from both the US and the EU were utilised in this study. Due to restricted distribution of 
eculizumab, some clinical sites used locally sourced eculizumab and some clinical sites used eculizumab 
centrally sourced by Amgen. For each site, only Soliris-US or Soliris-EU were used in the study.  
No rescue treatment is defined in the protocol. 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of ABP 959 compared with that of Soliris 
based on control of intravascular haemolysis. 
The secondary objective is to assess the safety, PK, and immunogenicity of ABP 959 compared with that of 
Soliris. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoints 
In order to satisfy global regulatory requirements, the primary efficacy analyses for this study are based on a 
parallel comparison and on a crossover comparison between treatment groups, each with their own primary 
endpoint.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the parallel comparison is haemolysis, as measured by lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) at week 27. Week 27 was chosen for the analysis of LDH in the parallel comparison by 
the applicant, because at the week 27 time point, patients will have reached steady-state of LDH following 
the change of treatment from Soliris to ABP 959 eliminating the possibility of carryover effects of drug 
exposure from prior Soliris treatment in subjects with stable PNH given the 11-day half-life of Soliris and also 
allows sufficient time for LDH response to ABP 959 for those subjects randomised to ABP 959 in Period 1.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the crossover comparison is haemolysis, as measured by the time-
adjusted area under the effect curve (AUEC) of LDH from week 13 to week 27, from week 39 to week 53, 
and from week 65 to week 79.  
Results from the primary analysis for the parallel comparison are summarised within the currently submitted 
interim analysis clinical study report (CSR). 
To address concerns regarding the non-specificity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (i.e., high values caused 
by other conditions than haemolysis, which interfere with results of the study), an LDH Review Committee 
external to sponsor was established for this study. The LDH Review Committee consisted of 3 qualified 
members (2 independent reviewers and 1 adjudicator reviewer) who were experts in the field of PNH. The 
objective of the LDH Review Committee was to review blinded LDH data and to identify those values 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 49/113 
 
 
 
 
 
impacted by confounding events (acute infection, trauma, surgery) unrelated to efficacy of investigational 
product for exclusion in the primary analysis of LDH and AUEC of LDH. If the 2 independent reviewers agreed 
that a value should be excluded, the rationale from both reviewers was followed. If the 2 independent 
reviewers did not agree and a final review by the adjudicator (per LDH committee charter) was needed, the 
rationale from the adjudicator was followed. In general, LDH results flagged to be excluded were excluded 
from all derivations and analysis models.  
Secondary endpoints

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) 
Treatment-emergent serious adverse events 
Treatment-emergent events of interest (EOIs) 
Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) external to sponsor was formed with members consisting of 
individuals chosen for their expertise in PNH. The primary role of the DMC was to monitor safety data. 
Independent safety reviews of unblinded safety data were performed by the DMC approximately every 6 
months throughout the study. 
•  Sample size 
The sample size of 40 subjects was chosen to provide approximately 87% power to demonstrate non-
inferiority (NI) at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025 on the primary endpoint of week 27 LDH for the 
parallel comparison, assuming an inter-subject coefficient of variation (CV) of 130% for ABP 959 and 
eculizumab, a true geometric mean ratio (GMR) of 1 between ABP 959 and eculizumab, a NI margin of 2.873, 
and a 10% dropout rate.  
The sample size of 40 was anticipated also to provide greater than 95% power to demonstrate similarity at a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05 on the primary endpoint of time-adjusted AUEC of LDH from week 13 to 
week 27, from week 39 to week 53, and from week 65 to week 79 for the crossover comparison, assuming 
an intra-subject CV of 34%, a true GMR of 1 between ABP 959 and eculizumab, a similarity margin of (0.77, 
1.30), and a 10% dropout rate.

•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Randomisation was to occur within 8 days before the first dose of investigational product administration 
(defined as day 1) and was stratified by red blood cell (RBC) transfusion received within the last 12 months 
before randomisation (yes vs no). An interactive voice/web response system (IXRS) was used to randomise 
the subject centrally to receive either ABP 959/Soliris or Soliris/ABP 959. 
Since the investigational product (IP) containers are different for ABP 959 and eculizumab, IP (ABP 959 or 
eculizumab) is prepared by an unblinded pharmacist, or designee, into a common IV preparation for 
administration to the subject. Subjects, sponsor, designated PRA, and other clinical site staff are blinded to 
the IP allocation for each subject. Select PRA staff (e.g. clinical research associate), not involved in the 
monitoring or the daily operations of the study, are unblinded to subject IP allocation in order to perform IP 
accountability. 
•  Statistical methods 
The clinical similarity of the week 27 LDH between treatments was assessed by comparing the 1-sided 97.5% 
upper CI limit for the GMR of LDH at week 27 between ABP 959 treatment and Soliris treatment with a NI 
margin of 2.873. The point estimate of the mean difference in the log transformed LDH and the 
corresponding 1-sided 97.5% upper CI limit was estimated from a linear mixed effects model with treatment, 
stratification factor, week 1 LDH value, time (as a continuous variable), and treatment by time interaction 
term as fixed effects, compound symmetry covariance structure was applied to address repeat LDH 
measurements. The point estimate and the upper CI limit for the GMR were then calculated by transforming 
back to the original scale. Lactate dehydrogenase values from all assessed time points from week 13 to week 
27 (ie, study day 78 to study day 189) were included in the mixed model. Lactate dehydrogenase values 
impacted by confounding events unrelated to efficacy of investigational product, as determined by the LDH 
Review Committee (see Section 8.2.6), were excluded from the analysis. Only observed values were used in 
the model, missing LDH values were not imputed. 
Two interim blinded assessments were planned and completed. No change was made to the analysis plan. 
The primary endpoint for the crossover comparison was haemolysis, as measured by the time-adjusted AUEC 
of LDH from week 13 to week 27, from week 39 to week 53, and from week 65 to week 79. The primary 
analysis for the crossover comparison (ie, the final analysis) was conducted after all subjects completed the 
EOS visit. The primary analysis for the crossover comparison was conducted using the modified FAS (mFAS), 
which consisted of all randomised subjects with an LDH-time profile evaluable for the time-adjusted AUEC for 
at least one of the three assessment periods. Time-adjusted AUECs were calculated using trapezoidal rule on 
linear scale and standardised to a 7-day interval. The point estimates and confidence limits for the log-
transformed time-adjusted AUEC were estimated from a linear mixed effects model with treatment, 
stratification factor, period, and sequence as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect. A within subject 
variance-covariance structure of unstructured was used. Degree of freedom method was Kenward-Roger. 
Point estimates and corresponding confidence limits for the geometric LS means and the ratio of geometric 
LS means were calculated by transforming back to the original scale.

Results 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 47 subjects were screened and 42 subjects (20 in the ABP 959/Soliris treatment group and 22 in 
the Soliris/ABP 959 treatment group) were randomised. 
Figure 8 gives the participant flow for Periods 1 and 2 of the study. Of the 42 subjects who were initially 
randomised, 39 (92.9%) completed the study and 3 (7.1%) subjects discontinued the study. Reasons for 
discontinuing the study were consent withdrawn (1 [5.0%] subject in the ABP 959/eculizumab treatment 
group), adverse event (1 [4.5%] subject in the eculizumab/ABP 959 treatment group), and other (identified 
as patient’s personal needs) (1 [4.5%] subject in the eculizumab/ABP 959 treatment group). No subjects 
discontinued the study due to COVID-19-related reasons. 
In general, subject incidence of study completion and discontinuation was comparable between the 
2 treatment groups.

•  Recruitment 
The study initiation date was 22 Jan 2019. Data cut-off date for primary analysis of parallel comparison was 
10 Jan 2022. Study completion date was 12 July 2022. Dates defining the period of recruitment are not given 
in the CSR. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Amendments to the study plan were based on advice from CHMP SA or from national agencies or related to 
practical or linguistic aspects.  
After the data cut-off for the primary analysis was performed, unblinded data and results from the primary 
analysis were made available to pre-identified personnel from the applicant and the contract research 
organisation, who were involved in development of the interim CSR or regulatory submissions and who were 
not involved in any remaining blinded study conduct or data cleaning processes. All subjects and 
investigators remained blinded throughout the study and until the final study database lock.  
•  Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline physical characteristics are given in table 9 and baseline disease characteristics in 
table 10.

The subjects were required to be stable on eculizumab treatment. The mean (196.6 U/L) and median (188.5 
U/L) LDH values were normal at baseline. No violation of the inclusion criterion of LDH <1.5 x the upper limit 
of normal (ULN) at screening is reported in the listing of protocol violations; however, some elevated LDH

values up to 430 U/L were seen already at baseline. The mean (113.4 g/L) and median (111 g/L) 
haemoglobin (Hb) levels at baseline were slightly below normal. Only 5 subjects had received RBC units 
during the prior year. Even though the inclusion criteria required Hb ≥9.0 g/dL (in SI units, 90 g/L) for at 
least 6 weeks before randomisation, the range of Hb at baseline started from 83 g/L.  
•  Numbers analysed 
A total of 47 subjects were screened and 42 subjects (20 in the ABP 959/eculizumab treatment group and 22 
in the eculizumab/ABP 959 treatment group) were randomised. All 42 randomised subjects were included in 
the full analysis set (FAS), the per-protocol population set (PPP), the safety analysis set, and the PK 
concentration analysis set. Five subjects (2 in the ABP 959/Soliris group and 3 in the Soliris/ABP 95 group) 
were excluded from the PK parameter analysis set due to one or more PK samples not valid or missing from 
weeks 13 to 15. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the parallel comparison  
Results for analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for the parallel comparison of haemolysis are provided in 
Table 11. The 1-sided 97.5% upper CI was contained within the NI margin of 2.873, thus establishing 
similarity in clinical efficacy between ABP 959 and Soliris in the parallel comparison. Furthermore, the small 
difference in the point estimates is not clinically relevant.

LDH values impacted by confounding events determined by the blinded independent LDH Review Committee were 
excluded. 
a The point estimate and corresponding confidence limits for the log-transformed LDH values were estimated from a linear 
mixed effects model with treatment, stratification factor, week 1 LDH value, time (as a continuous variable), and treatment 
by time interaction term as fixed effects, and with subject as a random effect. A within subject variance-covariance 
structure of compound symmetry was used. Degree of freedom method was Kenward-Roger. The geometric LS means and 
point estimate and corresponding confidence limits for the ratio of geometric LS means were calculated by transforming 
back to the original scale. Lactate dehydrogenase values from all assessed time points from week 13 to week 27 were 
included in the mixed model. 
Additional analyses were conducted upon CHMP request on the primary efficacy endpoint for the parallel 
comparison (LDH at week 27) using a weighted population based on prior red blood cell (RBC) transfusion

stratification factor as observed in the current study data (i.e., using number of subjects as observed in the 
study for prior transfusion and no prior transfusion strata). Since the FAS and PPP populations were identical, 
only the table for the FAS is included in this AR (Table 16). The applicant clarified that Table 15 provides the 
geometric LS means over a balanced population (i.e., assuming equal number of subjects in the prior 
transfusion and no-prior transfusion strata) and Table 16 below uses the observed weight.

Results for analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for the crossover comparison of haemolysis, as 
measured by the time-adjusted AUEC of LDH from week 13 to week 27, from week 39 to week 53, and from 
week 65 to week 79, are provided in Table 15. The 90% CI was contained within a similarity margin of (0.77, 
1.30), thus establishing similarity in clinical efficacy between ABP 959 and eculizumab.

Results for subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint for the crossover comparison of haemolysis, 
as measured by the time-adjusted AUEC of LDH from week 13 to week 27, from week 39 to week 53, and 
from week 65 to week 79, are provided in the CSR for the following subgroups: RBC transfusion received 
within 12 months of randomisation [yes/no], age group [<=54 years/>54 years], and gender. In general, 
results for all subgroups were consistent with results from the primary efficacy analyses for the crossover 
comparison (data not shown).

Primary Analysis 
Analysis population and 
time point description 
The primary analysis for the parallel comparison was performed when all 
subjects completed or had the chance to complete the week 53 visit or had 
completed the EOS visit prior to week 53. Clinical similarity of the primary 
efficacy endpoint for the parallel comparison was evaluated using the full 
analysis set (FAS), which consisted of all randomised subjects.  
The clinical similarity of the primary endpoint of week 27 LDH between 
ABP 959 and Soliris was assessed by comparing the 1-sided 97.5% upper 
CI limit for the geometric mean ratios (GMR) of the LDH at week 27 
between ABP 959 treatment and Soliris treatment with a non-inferiority 
(NI) margin of 2.873.  
To assess the robustness of the primary parallel comparison, the parallel 
comparison was also conducted using the per-protocol analysis set for the 
primary endpoint of LDH at week 27 for the parallel comparison (PPP 
analysis set), which was a subset of the FAS consisting of subjects who 
did not experience an important protocol deviation between week 13 and 
week 27 affecting their primary efficacy evaluation for the parallel 
comparison. All subjects from the FAS were included in the PPP analysis

from the primary efficacy analysis for the parallel comparison.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for the crossover comparison of 
haemolysis, as measured by the time-adjusted AUEC of LDH from week

was evaluated using the full analysis set (FAS), which consisted of all 
randomised subjects. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the PPC 
analysis set identical to the FAS. 
The secondary endpoints of total complement (CH50), total haemoglobin,

2.5.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A supplemental analysis for the primary endpoint of LDH at week 27 was pre-planned in order to use prior 
information from historical eculizumab clinical studies. The method and results are summarised in this 
section. 
Estimates of mean and SD for week 27 LDH were extracted from five relevant historical eculizumab studies 
and combined via Bayesian normal-normal hierarchical model to provide a meta-analytic-predictive (MAP) 
prior distribution for the true mean LDH in the Soliris arm in the current 20150168 study. The prior 
information contained by the MAP prior was equivalent to the data from 23.13 subjects. This prior 
information was further discounted adaptively according to the congruence between the historical eculizumab 
data and the Study 20150168 Soliris arm data to establish the elastic MAP (EMAP) prior. The particular 
discounting function was chosen to induce strong information borrowing when Study 20150168 Soliris arm 
data are congruent to historical eculizumab data (i.e. use MAP worth of 23.13 subjects as the prior) or 
discard the historical data altogether when a discrepancy exists between the two, leading an adoption of a 
non-informative prior for mean LDH in Soliris. 
Based on prespecified criteria and LDH data at week 27, the EMAP prior for mean natural log(LDH) at week 
27 for the Soliris arm was derived as being is normally distributed with mean value 5.53 and infinite 
variance, equivalent to a non-informative prior with no borrowing from historical data. Consequently, 
posterior week 27 GMR of ABP 959 vs. Soliris is 1.022 with respective 97.5% upper credible interval 1.205. 
The posterior probability of GMR < NI margin 2.873 is approximately 1, which is greater than the prespecified 
cutoff of 0.972, the critical value found via simulation to control the frequentist type I error at 0.025 under 
the null hypothesis that ABP959 is inferior to eculizumab with 
 − 
 =1.06 (the NI margin on natural 
logarithm scale). Therefore, similarity was concluded by the applicant.

Not applicable. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study design 
The included patients were stable on Soliris treatment. This was discussed in scientific advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/674462/2015 and EMA/114622/2023) and not considered to be an ideal population, as 
subjects already stable on eculizumab therapy are a relatively insensitive population for detecting differences 
between treatments. But it was recognised to be the most feasible population. CHMP concluded that provided 
stringent similarity could be shown in healthy volunteers, ideally supported by data well within the standard 
acceptance ranges, the phase 3 population might be acceptable.. As a conclusion, the lack of a naïve group of 
PNH subjects is considered a weakness. The study design was, however, discussed and accepted by the 
CHMP during scientific advice, taking in account the rarity of PNH and consequent constraints in recruitment. 
The primary objective of the single pivotal study 20150168 has not been specified within the estimand 
framework as per ICH E9(R1). This is not considered a problem per se, but it is noted that the use of LDH 
Review Committee - to review and identify LDH values impacted by confounding events (e.g., acute infection, 
or trauma including surgery) and potentially exclude these data from the analysis - effectively considers 
these confounding effects as intercurrent events. The analysis with some of the data excluded represents a 
hypothetical scenario where these confounding effects did not happen. The acceptability of this approach 
rests heavily on the assumption that the confounding effects leading to exclusion of data are indeed 
unrelated to the randomised treatment (not only to its efficacy). The applicant clarified in their response that 
the reviewers and adjudicator received both LDH values, laboratory data (inclusive of comments documenting 
tube haemolysis observed in the specimen) in the laboratory and clinical information of every subject. In a 
trial aiming to demonstrate equivalence, no data should be excluded from the analysis based on the outcome 
alone per CHMP GUIDELINE ON THE INVESTIGATION OF BIOEQUIVALENCE.  
In the current study, exclusion of LDH measurements was impacted by the measured values themselves, 
which is not acceptable in principle. The reviewers also considered the laboratory notes indicating tube 
haemolysis; however, no information was provided as to whether tube haemolysis in the specimen was 
detected by the lab prior to bioanalysis or otherwise independently of the result. Furthermore, there are 
instances where a reviewer flagged an LDH measurement for exclusion due to tube haemolysis while the 
other reviewer did not. This suggests that the comments from the laboratory did not clearly indicate that the 
specimen was found invalid due to tube haemolysis. For these reasons the LDH review procedure leading to 
exclusion of LDH values from the analysis aiming to demonstrate equivalence is unacceptable in principle. 
Missing LDH values were not imputed in the analysis. The applicant was requested to present number of 
observations missing per treatment group for each time point included in the primary analysis model, i.e., 
week 13 to week 27. The numbers of missing values were negligible (1−3 values/sampling time point/study 
group) and are deemed to be missing at random. 
The sample size calculation was based on power to demonstrate 1) non-inferiority (NI) of ABP 959 vs. Soliris 
at a 1-sided significance level of 0.025 in the primary endpoint of week 27 LDH for the parallel comparison 
(for EMA), and 2) similarity of ABP 959 vs. Soliris at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 on the primary 
endpoint of time-adjusted AUEC of LDH for the crossover comparison from week 13 to week 27, from week 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 72/113 
 
 
 
39 to week 53, and from week 65 to week 79 (for FDA). Usually, equivalent efficacy is required to be 
demonstrated for biosimilars. In this case, however, the NI approach for the primary parallel comparison 
endpoint can be agreed. In a study population already stabilised on eculizumab treatment, it would be 
unlikely that superiority would be found in maintenance of efficacy. 
The proposed NI margin corresponding to 2.873-fold increase in average LDH level at week 27 in ABP 959 as 
compared with Soliris is found not acceptable clinically since this would consider “acceptable” LDH values of 
up to four times of what is usually referred to as upper limit of normal range. From a methodological point of 
view, the derivation of the NI appears to make some questionable assumptions, e.g., equating clinical 
relevance of 1.5xULN increase of LDH individual PNH patient with 1.5-fold increase in average LDH levels 
attained with the comparative treatments. However, the actual observed point estimate for LDH is close to 1 
(1.0628) and the 95% CI for the primary analysis of LDH at Week 27 was narrow [0.9758, 1.1576]. The 
observed difference in LDH is deemed to be not clinically relevant.  
Two interim analyses were performed on blinded variability. The second interim analysis allowed for a switch 
of primary analysis from parallel comparison to crossover comparison, had the inter-subject CV of LDH been 
large. This adaptive design has not been shown to preserve the type I error rate in all situations. However, it 
is agreed with the “Type I error report” presented by the applicant that the impact is probably reasonably 
small in the present situation and hence accepted. 
A one-year parallel comparison is considered sufficient for assessment of efficacy and safety of ABP 959 vs. 
originator. Analysis of the primary endpoint at week 27 instead of Week 52 can be followed with the following 
justification: usually the recommendation would be to test at a time point with the highest 'effect dynamic' 
based on the comparison of the originator vs. placebo. This does not similarly apply in the present case 
where efficacy in eculizumab-pre-treated and stable patients is compared, investigating the ability to 
maintain treatment effect from baseline onwards. It is difficult to concur on the most sensitive assessment 
time point without making assumptions about the nature of such potential differences that need to be ruled 
out (e.g., rapidity of response onset vs. maximum achievable effect).  
There are uncertainties if biosimilarity compared to the reference product can be supported by study 
20150168. Considering that the included patients were stable on the reference product and not treatment-
naïve, the study may not have been sensitive enough to detect potential differences between the substances 
in a population with high disease activity. Additional quality data as well as data from the study in healthy 
volunteers (PK, PD, ADA) were requested to be considered and discussed by the applicant in line with the 
scientific advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/425900/2017. The efficacy data from the cross-over phase in study 
20150168 positively support the application. It is however to be noted that final data from period 2 of the 
trial also represent a population already treated with eculizumab, similar to period 1, and as such is not a 
sensitive population for demonstration of difference between efficacy of ABP 959 and Soliris. In light of the 
results on other parts of the biosimilarity exercise, rarity of PNH, and the overall approach, a study in 
treatment-naïve subjects is not deemed to be required. 
The primary and secondary endpoints of the study are deemed to yield an overall sufficient assessment of 
the degree of haemolysis in the study subjects and the therapeutic effect of eculizumab. Regarding PD, the 
method for determination of CH50 was changed between studies 20150164 and 20150168 since most PNH 
patients, during stable maintenance treatment, are expected to have CH50 levels below the detection limits 
of the commercially available Wako Autokit CH50 used in PK study 20150164. In study 20150168, the 
haemolytic assay CH50 was measured based on lysis of antibody-coated sheep red blood cells (EA) due to 
the activation of complement on the cell’s surface. Patients with PNH are known to have higher than normal 
levels of haemolysis and higher than normal circulating haemoglobin levels. Therefore, a control for 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 73/113 
 
 
 
endogenous haemoglobin levels was run in parallel with the haemolytic assay and subtracted from the CH50 
assay to obtain the final CH50 result. Nevertheless, the observed CH50 values in study 20150168 were 
mostly below detection limit even with this method. The results below the LLOQ were included in the 
similarity analysis of the treatment groups and the applicant considers that these values were meaningful 
although the variability at such low levels is significant. Although the applicant has used an unconventional 
approach in the analysis, it can be concluded that the similarity of the treatment groups has been 
demonstrated. 
The sample size estimation was based on the cross-sectional variability approximated from the TRIUMPH 
study results (Hillmen P et.al. The Complement Inhibitor Eculizumab in Paroxysmal Nocturnal 
Haemoglobinuria. The New England Journal of Medicine. 2006;355:1233-1243) where mean (SE) LHD at 
week 27 was 327.3 (67.6). The CV of 130% has been deduced from these figures and used, in part, as the 
justification of the proposed NI margin. As stated previously , the NI margin is considered wide and, formally, 
sufficient power for demonstrating the postulated NI was achieved with the total sample size of 40. The 
planned statistical analysis is actually able to considerably reduce random variability by adjusting for baseline 
LDH and using multiple time points’ data for estimating average LDH at week 27. In conclusion, the study is 
able to provide results more precise than anticipated based on the initial, overly simplistic statistical analysis 
plans. Subjects were randomised to continue Soliris or switch to ABP 959 in 1:1 ratio within strata 
determined by whether or not RBC transfusion was received within the last 12 months. The randomisation 
scheme is considered appropriate. The study was double-blind which is considered ideal considering the study 
objectives.  
The primary model-based estimates of mean (“LS mean”) LDH values at week 27 are produced by a 
statistical model in which mean LDH value of a treatment group is linear trajectory from week 13 to week 27. 
The individual LDH values are modelled to also depend on subjects’ baseline (week 1) LDH and stratification 
factor (RBC transfusion within 12 months before baseline). Given that subjects were stable on Soliris prior to 
randomisation and have been on randomised treatment for at least 13 weeks, the statistical model is 
considered appropriate in the sense that the LDH values from week 13 through 27 can be anticipated to 
estimate the same quantity.  
Time-adjusted AUECs of LDH for the primary efficacy endpoint for the crossover comparison (from week 13 
to week 27, from week 39 to week 53, and from week 65 to week 79) were calculated using trapezoidal rule 
and standardised to describe LDH during a 7-day interval. Despite the linear interpolation, AUECs were 
statistically modelled as log-linear. Interpretation of results is further challenged by the fact that the AUEC 
are based on "trough" LDH measured approximately 14 days from previous dose, not on a real intervals of 7 
days. While complicating the interpretation of estimates at patient and group level, these considerations do 
not prevent evaluation of similarity. 
Conduct of the study 
The amendments to the study are not considered to have compromised integrity of the study, even though 
the three latest protocol versions were implemented when the trial was already ongoing. All amendments 
occurred prior to data cut-off date (10 Jan 2022). Reported protocol deviations are deemed to not have 
affected assessment of the primary endpoints.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline 
Of 47 screened,42 subjects (20 in the ABP 959/eculizumab treatment group and 22 in the eculizumab/ABP 
959 treatment group) were randomised. All 42 randomised subjects are included in the clinical efficacy 
analyses.  
The subjects represent a wide age range (21 to 78 years, median 36,5 years) of adult patients with PNH, 
with an equal gender distribution (22 female, 20 male). Regardless of the small size of the study, the 
baseline and disease characteristics are overall comparable. Most subjects are white, which is not considered 
a problem in the EU. At baseline, the mean duration from diagnosis was 5.7 years with a range from 1.4 
years to 40 years. Overall, the subjects are representative of a wide range of adult PNH patients; except that 
subjects not tolerating eculizumab or not achieving stabilisation of PNH with eculizumab are not included, 
since subjects were required to be stable on eculizumab for enrolment. 
Mean LDH values were normal; however, LDH values up to 430 U/L were seen at baseline, which exceeds the 
inclusion criterion of <1.5 x ULN at screening. Similarly, Hb values as low as 83 g/l at baseline, below the 
required 90 g/L, are reported. No violations of these inclusion criteria are reported in the CSR. Since the 
mean and median values and ranges of LDH and Hb are comparable between study arms, the presence of 
some subjects with Hb and LDH values outside of the inclusion criteria is not deemed to have compromised 
efficacy results. These/this subject(s) may have experienced haemolysis between screening and baseline 
samples. No further information was therefore requested on this matter.  
Clinical efficacy 
The week 27 mean LDH was estimated assuming a linear trajectory from week 13 through 27 that, at subject 
level, also depends on subject’s baseline LDH and whether RBC transfusion was needed within 12 months 
before baseline. Any systematic trends in LDH level from week 13 to week 27 were negligible and, therefore, 
the LS means reflect the average LDH values during this time frame. The between-subject variability was 
negligible - probably due to the adjustment for baseline LDH. Overall, the primary statistical model is 
considered to use the data adequately and efficiently to address the primary objective.  
The estimates of geometric LS means ratio of 1.0628 and the upper bound of the 95% CI (1.1576) are well 
below 2.873. Hence, a noninferior therapeutic effect was successfully demonstrated using the NI margin pre-
specified by the applicant. Furthermore, the noted small difference in LDH at Week 27 is not considered 
clinically relevant. Additional analyses conducted upon CHMP request on the primary efficacy endpoint for the 
parallel comparison (LDH at week 27) using a weighted population based on prior red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusion stratification factor as observed in the current study data (i.e., using number of subjects as 
observed in the study for prior transfusion and no prior transfusion strata) demonstrated similar results in 
both study groups. 
Results for analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for the crossover comparison of haemolysis, as 
measured by the time-adjusted AUEC of LDH from week 13 to week 27, from week 39 to week 53, and from 
week 65 to week 79, were suggestive of similar clinical efficacy between ABP 959 and eculizumab, since the 
90% CI was contained within a similarity margin of (0.77, 1.30). 
The applicant had pre-planned a supplementary analysis where available historical data from eculizumab 
clinical trials are used to give more precise estimate of mean LDH at week 27 in Soliris treatment. The five 
studies used by the applicant appeared comparable with study 20150168. Ultimately the applicant’s pre-
specified algorithm resulted in no use of historical data sources. While the data and methodology used for 
Assessment report

this supplementary analysis leave some questions open, these are not considered critical because study 
20150168 is considered, in principle, to provide supportive data only. Regarding efficient use of available 
data, an appropriate statistical model was used for the primary comparison of mean LDH levels between ABP 
959 and Soliris and likely resulted considerable efficiency gains as compared with the potential gains by the 
use of historical data sources.  
The secondary endpoints are given descriptively, without statistical comparison. In general, the values of 
total haemoglobin (Hb), serum-free haemoglobin, haptoglobin, bilirubin, degree of haemoglobinuria, and type 
III erythrocytes were stable over time and results were comparable between the groups administered ABP 
959 and Soliris during the entire trial. Due to the small size of the study, some differences are seen in the 
mean levels of the measures of haemolysis at different sampling points; however, the direction of these 
differences varies, and there is no indication of increased haemolysis or disease activity in either study arm.  
Over the entire study through the EOS, the mean (SD) number of packed red blood cell (RBC) units 
transfused per month was 0.200 (0.1980) for 2 subjects in the ABP 959/Soliris treatment group and 0.238 
(0.2078) for 6 subjects in the Soliris/ABP 959 treatment group. For the time period of week 13 to the end of 
Period 1, the mean (SD) number of packed RBC units transfused per month was 0.160 (0.0707) for 2 
subjects in the ABP 959 treatment group and 0.278 (0.1446) for 5 subjects in the Soliris treatment group. In 
Period 2 (through the primary analysis data cut-off), the mean (SD) number of packed RBC units transfused 
per month was 1.155 (0.1061) for 2 subjects in the ABP 959 treatment group. For the time period of week 65 
to EOS, the mean (SD) number of packed RBC units transfused per month was 0.950 for 1 subject in the ABP 
959 treatment group. No subjects in the Soliris treatment group were transfused in Period 2. Overall, there 
was no relevant difference between occurrence of RBC transfusions during the compared treatments over the 
study. The planned subgroups by RBC transfusion history, age, and gender were very small, therefore, no 
firm conclusions can be drawn from subgroup analyses. However, the results in the subgroups are overall 
consistent with the primary analysis.  
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The maintenance design of Period 1 of the single pivotal phase 3 study is considered insensitive for 
demonstration of potential differences in efficacy and safety; even with the additional data obtained after 
cross-over for the 6-month Period 2 of the study. Furthermore, the study is small, with only 42 participants. 
Therefore, the currently available data are considered supportive but not confirmatory of similar efficacy.

Period 1 
In period 1 the number of doses administered to subjects, the mean total dose of investigational product 
received, and the total investigational product exposure duration were similar between the ABP 959 and 
Soliris treatment groups. 
41 (97.6%) subjects completed Period 1 dosing and 1 (4.5%) subject discontinued during Period 1. The 
reason for discontinuing investigational product for the subject in the Soliris/ABP 959 treatment group in 
Period 1 was adverse event (asthenia and fatigue).

(92.9%) subjects (19 [95.0%] and 20 [90.9%] subjects, respectively) completed Period 2 IP dosing. One 
subject in both study groups discontinued IP during Period 2. Reasons for discontinuing IP in Period 2 were 
consent withdrawal for treatment (1 [5.0%] subject in the ABP 959/ Soliris treatment group) and other (i,e., 
identified as patient’s personal needs) (1 [4.5%] subject in the Soliris/ABP 959 treatment group).

2.5.8.2.  Adverse events 
PK/PD Similarity Study – Study 20150164 
Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (US) Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. 
In Study 20150164, 69.6% of subjects overall reported at least 1 adverse event. Most adverse events were 
assessed as grade 1 or grade 2 in severity; 133 (61.3%) and 56 (25.8%) subjects, respectively. The number 
of subjects who experienced grade 3 events in any treatment group was 1 (1.4%) each in the ABP 959, 
Soliris (US), and Soliris (EU) treatment groups. There were no grade 4 or grade 5 events (no deaths) and no 
adverse events leading to study or study drug discontinuation. 
Table 25 Overall summary of treatment-emergent adverse events (Study 20150164 safety 
population) 
a Subjects with multiple events in the same category were counted only once in that category. Subjects with 
events in more than 1 category were counted once in each of those categories. 
Note: A TEAE was defined as an AE that was not present prior to treatment with study drug, but appeared following 
treatment or was present at treatment initiation but worsened during treatment. 
Grade 1 - Mild; Grade 2 - Moderate; Grade 3 - Severe; Grade 4 - Life-threatening; Grade 5 - Death. 
The Grade 3 events (severe) were viral infection, epistaxis, facial bones fractures and headache. The events 
of viral infection, epistaxis, facial bones fractures were considered not related to study drug. The event of 
headache was considered probably related to the Soliris-EU treatment.

PK/PD Similarity Study – Study 20150164 
There were 6 subjects with clinically significant laboratory findings, 3 in the Soliris-EU group and 3 in the ABP 
959 group. The clinically significant findings included transiently elevated liver function tests and elevated 
neutrophil and leukocyte values in conjunction with upper respiratory or urinary infections. 
No safety signals were identified during the analysis of mean haematology laboratory values over time. No 
haematologic, haemolytic, or haematopoietic adverse events were reported although sporadic abnormal 
haematology laboratory values and changes from baseline occurred. 
There were no clinically relevant changes in vital signs over the course of the study.  
Comparative Clinical Study – Study 20150168 
Haematology Laboratory Results 
There were no notable differences between the ABP 959 and Soliris treatment groups in median changes 
from baseline for white blood cell (WBC) parameters (leukocytes and neutrophils), red blood cell (RBC) 
parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, and haematocrit), platelets or haemolysis-related parameters (type 
III cells [erythrocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes] and serum-free haemoglobin) in Period 1 or Period 2.

decreased (5 [25.0%] subjects in the ABP 959 treatment group and 4 [18.2%] subjects in the Soliris 
treatment group) and WBC count (leukocytes) decreased (3 [15.0%] and 2 [9.1%] subjects, respectively). 
Postbaseline grade ≥ 3 WBC parameters in Period 2 included neutrophils decreased (5 [23.8%] subjects in 
the ABP 959 treatment group and 6 [30.0%] subjects in the eculizumab treatment group) and WBC count 
(leukocytes) decreased (4 [19.0%] and 5 [25.0%] subjects, respectively. Postbaseline grade ≥ 3 RBC 
parameters in Period 1 included haemoglobin decreased (1 [5.0%] subject in the ABP 959 treatment group 
and 2 [9.1%] subjects in the Soliris treatment group). Postbaseline grade ≥ 3 RBC parameters in Period 2 
included haemoglobin decreased (1 [4.8%] subject in the ABP 959 treatment group and 1 [5.0%] subject in 
the eculizumab treatment group). 
Chemistry Laboratory Results 
There were no notable differences between the ABP 959 and Soliris treatment groups in median changes 
from baseline for hepatobiliary parameters (ALT, AST, bilirubin, ALP, LDH, and haptoglobin) or renal function 
tests (potassium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], and uric acid) in Period 1 or Period 2. 
According to the applicant, one subject in the ABP 959 treatment group had a postbaseline grade ≥ 3 
bilirubin with an increase from baseline > 1 x the upper limit of normal to maximum postbaseline grade 3. No 
subjects experienced postbaseline grade ≥ 3 renal function tests in Period 1 or Period 2. There were no 
clinically relevant changes in vital signs over the course of the study.

PK/PD Similarity Study – Study 20150164 
Blood samples for ADA analysis were collected at pre-dose, at scheduled time points during the study, and at 
the end of the study. 
No subjects were excluded from the ADA Population. 
At baseline (day 1, predose), 7 (3.2%) subjects were positive for binding ADAs: 4 (5.6%) subjects, 2 (2.8%) 
subjects, and 1 (1.4%) subject in the ABP 959, Soliris-US, and Soliris-EU treatment groups, respectively. The 
signal-to-noise ratios for these 7 subjects were low in magnitude; all samples tested negative for neutralizing 
ADAs. The applicant comments that these results are expected and demonstrate a suitable assay cut point 
that can result in a screening assay false positive rate between 2% and 11% (Devanarayan et al. 
Recommendations for Systematic Statistical Computation of Immunogenicity Cut Points. The AAPS Journal, 
Vol. 19, No. 5, September 2017). 
Table 37 presents the results on binding ADA by treatment group for the total ADA population. In the 
Japanese subgroup (n=12, 4 in each treatment group) no subject had positive ADA results.

criteria of 0.80 to 1.25 (ABP 959 versus Soliris-US, ABP 959 versus Soliris-EU, and Soliris-US versus Soliris-
EU.  
No positive neutralising ADA results were reported in study 20150164. 
Comparative Clinical Study – Study 20150168 
Blood samples for ADA analysis were collected at baseline on day 1/visit 1/week 1, pre-dose, at scheduled 
time points during the study, and at the end of the study. 
In Period 1, all 42 subjects had at least one on-study ADA result. No subjects in either treatment group 
tested positive for pre-existing binding ADAs or neutralizing ADAs at baseline. No subjects in either treatment 
group tested positive for binding ADAs, neutralising ADAs, or treatment boosted ADAs in Period 1. 
In period 2, two subjects (9.1%) in the eculizumab/ABP 959 treatment group tested positive for binding 
ADAs (for both subjects, the positive binding ADA was observed following the crossover in treatment to ABP 
959). Results were transient (i.e., negative results at the subject’s last time point tested) for both subjects. 
Neither subject experienced serious adverse events that were related to the transient ADAs. Of subjects with 
a postbaseline result through EOS, no subjects in either treatment group tested positive for neutralizing ADAs 
or treatment boosted ADAs.

2.5.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no events leading to study or study drug discontinuation in Study 20150164. 
In Study 20150168 discontinuation of investigational product or study due to 1 or more adverse events 
occurred in 0 (0.0%) in the ABP 959 and 1 (4.5%) subject, and Soliris treatment groups in Period 1. The 
subject in the Soliris treatment group discontinued both investigational product and the study due to adverse 
events of grade 2 non-serious asthenia and grade 2 non-serious fatigue. 
In Period 2 (through the primary analysis data cut-off), no subjects in either treatment group 
discontinued investigational product or study due to 1 or more adverse events. 
2.5.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Not applicable.  
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical evidence supporting the similarity of ABP 959 to Soliris (eculizumab) includes one single-dose 
PK/PD-study in healthy adult male subjects (Study 20150164) and one completed comparative clinical 
efficacy and safety study in adult subjects with paroxysmal nocturnal haematuria (PNH) (Study 20150168). 
Safety findings were presented for a total of 259 subjects. In the PK/PD study 217 healthy males were 
exposed to one single dose of 300mg either Soliris-EU (74 subjects), Soliris-US (72 subjects) or ABP 959 (71 
subjects). In the clinical comparative study 42 adult subjects with PNH were treated with 900 mg Soliris or 
ABP 959 administered as IV infusion every 14 days. Period 1 of the clinical comparative study lasted 52 
weeks. Period 2 started at week 53 with a crossover in treatment and was 26 weeks in duration. Thirty-nine 
subjects (19 [95.0%] and 20 [90.9%] subjects, respectively) completed Period 2.  
Due to the small sample size of the Phase 3 study and due to the inevitable carry over effects between study 
periods as patients entered on a stable Soliris regimen, the clinical studies can only provide limited 
information on comparability of safety and immunogenicity. In Study 20150168, the risk of experiencing 
adverse events was inherently low as only patients already on stable Soliris treatment (i.e., subjects with 
established good tolerance for treatment) were included. Despite these limitations, the development 
programme is considered acceptable from a safety perspective and was agreed upon via Scientific Advice 
(SA; EMA/CHMP/SAWP/674462/2015, Procedure No. EMEA/H/SA/3164/1/2015/III). 
Exposure to investigational product was similar across the ABP 959 and Soliris treatment groups in both 
studies. In general, incidence of study completion and discontinuation was comparable between the 
treatment groups. 
PK/PD Similarity Study – Study 20150164 
In the PK/PD Similarity Study 69.6% of subjects overall reported at least 1 adverse event. Most adverse 
events were assessed as grade 1 or grade 2 in severity. The most common TEAEs by PT (reported in more 
than 5% of subjects) were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain and rhinitis.  
There were no life-threatening TEAEs, no deaths, and no TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study or 
study drug. There were no serious TEAEs in the ABP 959 treatment arm which were related to the study

drug. No meaningful difference between the groups could be seen in terms of nature, grade or frequency of 
TEAEs. The safety of all three investigational products was consistent with the known safety profile of Soliris. 
Comparative Clinical Study – Study 20150168 
In Period 1 of the comparative clinical Study, 15 (75.0%) subjects in the ABP 959 treatment group and 21 
(95.5%) subjects in the Soliris treatment group reported at least 1 adverse event. Most adverse events in 
Period 1 were grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
The most common TEAEs by PT (≥ 20%) in the ABP 959 treatment group were pyrexia, nasopharyngitis and 
anaemia. The most frequently reported adverse events in the Soliris treatment group were headache, 
vaccination complication, and hypertension. The seemingly large percentual difference between groups 
regarding some of the preferred terms does not cause concern as the number of subjects is small and the 
frequency of reported AEs in the ABP 959 group are in line with those reported for Soliris in the SmPC. 
Throughout the study (Periods 1 + 2), 7 (17.1%) subjects receiving ABP 959 experienced a total of 
14 serious adverse events, and 2 (4.8%) subjects receiving eculizumab experienced a total of 5 serious 
adverse events. The number of SAEs was higher in the ABP 959 group compared to the Soliris group. 
However, most SAEs were not considered related to the study drug, all SAEs were single events and review 
of the individual events did not identify any new safety concerns or new pattern of serious adverse events.  
Overall, no meaningful differences between the treatment groups were seen in the nature, seriousness or 
incidence of adverse events in patients with PNH. The safety of ABP 959 was consistent with the known 
safety profile of Soliris. 
Events of special interest 
Based on the mechanism of action, known potential and identified risks, and clinical data available in the 
product labelling for Soliris the identified EOIs included infections, infusion reactions, meningococcal infection, 
sepsis and hematologic abnormalities for the PK/PD Similarity Study. For the Comparative Clinical study, only 
infusion reactions and serious infections were considered EOIs.  
In the PK/PD Similarity Study infections were mostly Grade 1 and 2 including upper respiratory tract 
infection, rhinitis, pharyngitis and oral herpes. No meningococcal infection, sepsis, hematologic, haemolytic, 
or haematopoietic TEAEs were reported. Infusion reactions on the day of or the day after study drug infusion 
occurred in 3 subjects in the ABP 959 group and 1 subject in the Soliris-EU group. These infusion reactions 
were mild events of cough, pyrexia and skin reaction.  
In the Comparative Clinical study, the overall subject incidences for infusion reactions were 15 (36.6%) and 
15 (35.7%), and for serious infections were 3 (7.3%) and 0 (0.0%) for subjects receiving ABP 959 and Soliris 
respectively. The small number of serious infections precludes any conclusions on a potential imbalance. No 
meningococcal infection or sepsis were reported.  
Overall, no notable differences between the treatment groups were seen in the incidence of EOIs in healthy 
subjects or in patients with PNH. The nature, seriousness and incidence of infections and infusion reactions 
were consistent with the known safety profile of Soliris. 
Excipients 
ABP959 (in contrast to the reference product) is a sorbitol-containing product. Medicines containing 
sorbitol/fructose given intravenously may be life-threatening in patients with HFI and should be 
contraindicated in this population unless there is an overwhelming clinical need and no alternatives are 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023

available (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/information-package-leaflet-
regarding-fructose-sorbitol-used-excipients-medicinal-products-human-use_en.pdf). As Bekemv is a 
biosimilar product, there is no overwhelming clinical need per definition.  
Children below 2 years of age may not yet be diagnosed with HFI. Thus, the obvious difficulties in diagnosing 
hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) in children <2 years of age raised concerns on whether ABP959, which 
(in contrast to the reference product), is a sorbitol-containing product, could be safely used in subjects below 
this age. Therefore, a contraindication in children below 2 years of age was added for ABP959. The potential 
risk of serious metabolic harms due to sorbitol exposure in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance was 
added in the list of safety concerns for Bekemv in the EU RMP v0.5., and in the educational materials as an 
additional risk minimisation measure. A contraindication was also added for use of Bekemv in subjects with 
HFI, and further changes were required to other parts of the PI for controlling the risk caused by sorbitol 
content.  
Immunogenicity 
In the PK/PD Similarity Study, 7/217 subjects were ADA positive already at baseline. Treatment-emergent 
ADA (positive post-baseline with a negative of no result at baseline) were seen in 3/71, 3/70 and 6/73 
subjects in the ABP 959, Soliris-US and Soliris-EU groups, respectively. No neutralising ADA were detected in 
the study. No clinically relevant immunogenicity nor differences in immunogenicity between treatment groups 
were observed in the study. 
In the Comparative Clinical study, no subjects were ADA positive at baseline and no subjects developed ADA 
during the 52 weeks in Period 1. Two subjects became transiently ADA positive after switching from Soliris to 
ABP 959.  
Based on ADA frequencies found in PNH patients in the marketing authorisation studies for Soliris, 1-2 ADA-
positive subjects could have been expected among the 42 subjects in study 20150168. The drug tolerance 
was not optimal and some ADA may have gone undetected. However, the results are not implausible and do 
not preclude similarity.  
Neither of the two studies are optimal for evaluation of immunogenicity. Since the PK/PD study was a single-
dose study with a subtherapeutic dose, it does not evaluate potential immunogenicity during long-term 
treatment. Studies conducted with low doses are however sometimes more sensitive to compare immune 
responses (please refer to Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products Containing Monoclonal 
Antibodies –Non-clinical and Clinical Issues EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). The phase 3 study on the other 
hand is very small and involves a study population already using eculizumab. Hence, any subjects with 
immune-related allergic reactions or loss of efficacy would have stopped the treatment earlier and would not 
be eligible for the study. 
Nevertheless, eculizumab has a clear, well-known and well-understood mode of action (MoA). The MoA can 
be thoroughly investigated by binding and functional in vitro tests. Efficacy of eculizumab can be seen directly 
related to the biological events triggered by the binding of eculizumab to its known target; the structure–
function relationship is well known; hence, a good correlation between clinical efficacy and pharmacological 
effect can be derived from comparable binding properties and functional characteristics. Relevant, validated 
PD markers (LDH, biochemical marker of intravascular haemolysis; and CH50, sensitive biomarker for 
reduced C5 functional activity), which reflect the MoA of eculizumab are available. They are suitable and 
sensitive to detect potential differences between the proposed biosimilar and the RMP. Immunogenicity data 
from prior eculizumab studies and clinical use of eculizumab for 15 years have shown low immunological 
potential and no clinical consequences by ADA on efficacy and safety.

The degree of analytical and functional similarity between ABP 959 and reference medicinal product is very 
high. All of the quality attributes potentially related to immunogenicity (like protein aggregates, impurities) 
are highly similar between the RMP and ABP 959. The comparative PK study demonstrated bioequivalence 
between ABP 959 and RMP. In the same PK/PD-study similar inhibition of C5 activity was demonstrated. The 
single-dose PK/PD-study 3/71 and 6/73 healthy volunteers developed treatment-emergent ADAs in the 
Bekemv and Soliris-EU groups, and no ADAs were developed during the 52 weeks in the ABP 959 group in 
study 20150168. Mean LDH levels were very similar for ABP 959 and RMP in the phase 3 study 20150168, 
implicating no loss of efficacy.  
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The nature, seriousness and incidence of adverse reactions in healthy subjects were similar between all three 
treatment groups and consistent with previous findings with Soliris.  
No meaningful differences between the treatment groups were seen in the nature, seriousness or incidence of 
adverse events in patients with PNH. The safety of ABP 959 was consistent with the known safety profile of 
Soliris. 
No clinically relevant immunogenicity nor differences in immunogenicity between treatment groups were 
observed in either healthy subjects or patients with PNH. 
Similar immunogenicity is further supported by the similar PK/PD profile, efficacy and safety, and especially 
by the structural and functional similarity of ABP 959 and the RMP. 
The excipient sorbitol was selected to provide suitable tonicity and maintain product stability. However, when 
given intravenously, it may cause serious harm in patients with HFI who lack the enzyme needed to break it 
down. Therefore, a contraindication has been added in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) as 
well as a contraindication in babies and children below 2 years of age since they may not yet be diagnosed 
with HFI. Serious metabolic harms due to sorbitol exposure in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance 
has been added as an important potential risk in the RMP. Additional risk minimisation measures have also 
been introduced to mitigate this risk, consisting of the following educational materials: physician’s guide, 
patient’s/parent’s information brochure, and patient safety card. The target audience and planned distribution 
path for the controlled distribution and vaccination reminder also include pharmacists dispensing the drug in 
addition to prescribing physicians. The risk of serious metabolic harms due to sorbitol exposure in patients 
with hereditary fructose intolerance was added as important potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP.

2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reason: The proposed 
package leaflet of ABP 959 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion has the same content to that of the 
reference product Soliris 300 mg concentrate for solution for infusion with the exceptions noted on Page 6 of 
the attached QRD form for submission and assessment of user testing bridging proposals. The applicant 
considers these differences would not affect the readability and otherwise key information is identical. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The claimed therapeutic indication for the treatment of PNH is the same as for the reference product Soliris: 
Bekemv is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria 
(PNH). 
Evidence of clinical benefit is demonstrated in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) 
indicative of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1). 
Soliris is also indicated in the treatment of atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), refractory 
generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-
positive, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), but these indications are still protected by 
orphan exclusivity and not applied for in this MAA.  
Summary of quality comparability data 
A comprehensive similarity exercise following the general principles outlined in the guideline on similar 
biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance; Quality issues 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 99/113 
 
 
 
(EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012) has been performed. The number of batches used in the similarity 
assessment is very comprehensive.  
The statistical approach chosen by the applicant to analyse similarity assessment is endorsed. Tabular and 
graphical presentation allows for a clear comparison of ABP 959 to Soliris-EU and Soliris-US. In addition, 
generally sufficient raw data has been provided to allow assessment of biosimilarity independently of 
statistical approach chosen. In conclusion, the overall approaches used for establishment of the biosimilarity 
assessment criteria are considered acceptable.  
The comparative testing included analysis of biological activity, primary structure, higher order structure, 
particles and aggregates, product-related substances and impurities, and general properties including protein 
concentration and volume. In addition, stressed and accelerated stability studies as well as photodegradation 
studies were performed between ABP 959 and Soliris-EU.  
Summary of nonclinical comparability data 
The nonclinical data package included comprehensive in vitro and ex vivo biological studies relevant for the 
eculizumab mode of action comparing the functional activity of ABP-959 and Soliris EU (and Soliris-US). In 
addition, a toxicology assessment of excipients in the ABP-959 commercial drug formulation was included. 
The clinical development plan consists of two studies:  
1.  A pivotal phase I PK/PD study in adult, healthy male subjects [study 20150164]. Study 20150164 
was a randomised, double-blind, single-dose, 3-arm, parallel group trial comparing the PK similarity 
of ABP 959 relative to Soliris-US and to Soliris-EU; PK similarity of Soliris-US relative to Soliris-EU; 
PD similarity of ABP 959 relative to Soliris-US and to Soliris-EU. Eculizumab was administered as a 
single IV infusion of 300 mg subtherapeutic dose.  
2.  Study 20150168, a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled, 2-period crossover, 
multiple-dose efficacy and safety study. Adult men and women with PNH and stable on eculizumab 
were randomised to continue the reference product Soliris or to switch to Bekemv, both using the 
approved dose of 900 mg IV infusion every 14 days. The interim one-year analysis of the parallel 
one-year period 1 of the study is the basis for assessment of clinical similarity of efficacy and safety 
in this MAA for the EU. The final CSR, also containing the cross-sectional data up to end of study, i.e., 
the 6-month Period 2 of the study after switch, was received with the response to the LoQ and is 
additionally assessed as evidence of clinical similarity. The setting was generally agreed upon in 
scientific advice by the CHMP; though CHMP advice regarding NI margin was not followed. The CHMP 
would have preferred inclusion of also treatment-naïve PNH subjects but understood the issues with 
recruitment of study subjects in this orphan disease.

Minor differences in the levels of post-translational modifications, relative proportion of the charge variants, 
individual glycan species, levels of glycation, and levels of monomer, HMW, LMW, HC+LC and were 
sufficiently justified to have no clinical impact. 
Nonclinical  
Similarity between ABP 959 and Soliris-EU and Soliris-US has been demonstrated for biological properties 
described above under Quality, and ex vivo for inhibition potency for the alternative and classical pathways. 
Clinical data 
Pharmacokinetics 
In the comparison of PK data (pivotal PK/PD study 20150164) for the ABP 959 group with the Soliris-EU and 
Soliris-US treatment groups, the 90% CIs of the geometric LS for the three primary PK parameters (i.e. Cmax, 
AUClast and AUCinf) were all within the BE criteria of 80% to 125% based on total and free eculizumab 
concentrations. 
The PK results of the sensitivity/subgroup analyses performed in the study 20150164 were quite similar to 
the primary PK results. 
In the comparative efficacy and safety study (Study 20150168) in PNH subjects no acceptance ranges for PK 
parameters had been predefined, and PK was a secondary endpoint. The GMR (90% CI) for the total PK AUC 
from week 13 to week 15 was 0.9122 (0.7586, 1.0968) and for the free PK AUC it was 0.9508 (0.7454, 
1.2130), reasonably supporting comparable PK between the treatment groups as demonstrated in the pivotal 
PK study.  
Both total and free eculizumab trough concentrations at different timepoints seemed similar, and although 
the lower and upper 90% CI limits of the GMRs were not within the traditional bioequivalence range (i.e., 
0.80-1.25), all 90% CIs included unity. The trough concentrations varied so that at some timepoints they 
were higher in the ABP 959 group and at some other timepoints they were higher in the Soliris group. The 
updated trough free and total concentrations of eculizumab from week 53 to the end of study (i.e., week 79) 
were also comparable.  
Pharmacodynamics 
In the phase 1 study 20150164, PD similarity was demonstrated as assessed by area between the effect 
curve [ABEC] of 50% total haemolytic complement activity [CH50], of ABP 959 vs. Soliris-US, ABP 959 vs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 101/113 
 
 
 
Soliris-EU and with Soliris (US) vs. Soliris (EU). The ratio of LS geometric means of ABEC of CH50 (95% CI) 
was 1.0710 (0.9439. 1.2152) for ABP 959 vs. Soliris (US), 1.0824 (0.9552, 1.2266) for ABP 959 vs. Soliris 
(EU) and 1.0106 (0.8919, 1.1452) for Soliris US) vs. Soliris (EU). 
Moreover, it is acknowledged that the currently conducted phase 1 trial did explore both the maximal CH50 
response measurable with the bioanalytical method, and the CH50 response at very low eculizumab 
concentrations. As such, not much additional information would be expected from clinical studies with 
additional dose levels.  
Clinical efficacy 
The study population (n=42) of the phase 3 study 20150168 consisted of adult patients with PNH 
documented by flow cytometry and stable on eculizumab treatment. The primary endpoint was the level of 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a commonly used measure of intravascular haemolysis. The point estimates of 
geometric LS means estimated from a linear mixed effects model with treatment, stratification factor, week 1 
LDH value, time, and treatment by time interaction term as fixed effects, and with subject as a random 
effect, was 205.6 in the ABP 959 group and 193.5 in the Soliris group. The ratio of the geometric LS mean of 
LDH at week 27 (ABP 959/Soliris) was 1.0628, with a 1-sided 97.5% upper CI of 1.1576 and a 95% CI of 
(0.9758, 1.1576). The point estimate of geometric LS means ratio of 1.0628 and the upper bound of the 
95% CI (1.1576) are well below the pre-defined NI margin of 2.873. Furthermore, the noted difference in 
LDH at Week 27 is not considered clinically relevant. Additional analyses conducted on the primary efficacy 
endpoint for the parallel comparison (LDH at week 27) using a weighted population based on prior red blood 
cell (RBC) transfusion stratification factor as observed in the current study data (i.e., using number of 
subjects as observed in the study for prior transfusion and no prior transfusion strata) demonstrated similar 
results in both study groups. 
Results of the secondary endpoint of LDH time profile and other secondary endpoint measures of disease 
activity overall support similar clinical efficacy by ABP 959 and Soliris. These included laboratory measures of 
haemolysis (total haemoglobin, serum-free haemoglobin, haptoglobin, bilirubin, degree of haemoglobinuria), 
proportion of type III erythrocytes (with absent levels of CD55 and CD59) and red blood cell infusions. Some 
differences were observed in the levels of the laboratory values, but to both directions, with no consistent 
trend for better efficacy in either treatment group. Random differences are expectable when the study only 
includes 42 subjects. Over the entire study through the EOS, the mean (SD) number of packed RBC units 
transfused per month was 0.200 (0.1980) for 2 subjects in the ABP 959/Soliris treatment group and 0.238 
(0.2078) for 6 subjects in the Soliris/ABP 959 treatment group.  
Results for analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for the crossover comparison of haemolysis support 
similarity in clinical efficacy between ABP 959 and Soliris. The point estimate of the GMR of time-adjusted 
AUEC (ABP 959 vs Soliris) was 0.9812, with a 2-sided 90% CI of (0.9403, 1.0239). The 90% CI was 
contained within a similarity margin of (0.77, 1.30). 
The subgroups by RBC transfusion history, age and gender are small. Results of the subgroup analyses are 
overall consistent with the primary analysis. 
Safety 
Safety in healthy males 
In the PK/PD Similarity Study 54 (76.1%) subjects experienced 128 adverse events in the ABP 959 group. In 
the Soliris-US group, 46 (63.9%) subjects experienced 108 events. In the Soliris-EU group, 51 (68.9%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 102/113 
 
 
 
subjects experienced 143 events. The most common TEAEs by PT (reported in more than 5% of subjects) 
were headache, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain and rhinitis. 
Infections were mostly mild and occurred in 20 (28.2%), 19 (26.4%) and 29 (39.2%) in the ABP 959, Soliris-
US and Soliris-EU groups, respectively. There were no life-threatening TEAEs, no deaths, and no TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation from the study or study drug. There were no serious TEAEs in the ABP 959 
treatment arm which were related to the study drug. 
No meaningful difference between the groups could be seen in terms of nature, grade or frequency of TEAEs. 
The safety of all three investigational products was consistent with the known safety profile of Soliris. 
In the PK/PD Similarity Study, treatment-emergent ADA (positive post-baseline with a negative of no result 
at baseline) were seen in 3/71, 3/70 and 6/73 subjects in the ABP 959, Soliris-US and Soliris-EU groups, 
respectively. No neutralising ADA were detected in the study. No clinically relevant immunogenicity nor 
differences in immunogenicity between treatment groups were observed in the study. 
Safety in PNH patients 
In Period 1 of the comparative efficacy and safety study, 15 (75%) subjects in the ABP 959 treatment group 
and 21 (96%) subjects in the Soliris treatment group reported at least 1 adverse event. In period 2, after 
switching, AEs were reported by 18 (85.7%) subjects in the ABP 959 treatment group and 18 (90.0%) 
subjects in the Soliris treatment group.  
The overall subject incidences for infusion reactions were 15 (36.6%) and 15 (35.7%), and for serious 
infections were 3 (7.3%) and 0 (0.0%) for subjects receiving ABP 959 and Soliris respectively. The small 
number of serious infections precludes any conclusions on a potential imbalance. No meningococcal infection 
or sepsis were reported. No subjects were ADA positive at baseline an no subjects developed ADA during the 
52 weeks in Period 1. Two subjects became transiently ADA positive in Period 2 after switching from Soliris to 
ABP 959. Both subjects were ADA negative at End of study.  
Overall, no meaningful differences between the treatment groups were seen in the nature, seriousness or 
incidence of adverse events or immunogenicity in patients with PNH. The safety of ABP 959 was consistent 
with the known safety profile of Soliris.

Clinical data 
Pharmacokinetics 
In the comparative efficacy and safety study 20150168, the AUC from week 13 to week 15 was slightly 
greater with Soliris than with ABP 959 both for total and free eculizumab. The number of subjects was small 
(n = 20 in ABP 959/Soliris group and n = 22 in Soliris/ABP 959 group) in the treatment groups. PK was only 
Assessment report

Page 103/113 
 
 
 
an exploratory parameter with no equivalence margin pre-specified and 90% CIs include 1.00, so the 
differences in the AUCs can be considered to be not any concern.  
Pharmacodynamics 
During Period 1 of study 20150158, the PD results of the phase 3 study 20150168 appeared dissimilar 
between ABP 959 and Soliris groups, since the mean CH50 levels were somewhat higher in the ABP 
959/Soliris group than in the Soliris/ABP 959 group. However, the difference was driven by 4 subjects, who 
had high CH50 levels already at baseline and also after switching to Soliris at one year. Data from the cross-
over phase confirmed that the differences were likely due to differences in the studied individuals and not the 
administered treatments.  
The applicant fitted a PKPD model to the observed phase 1 PK/PD data and used the model to simulate time-
concentration profiles of eculizumab and CH50 response, and to calculate the proportion of simulated clinical 
trials which would establish biosimilarity between Soliris and ABP959 in terms of PK and PD endpoints. The 
PKPD model describes adequately the observed PD data, but the PKPD model may not generalise to other 
dose levels because the PKPD model assumes that the same free eculizumab concentration will always cause 
the same response. This assumption is incorrect because eculizumab dosing leads to build-up of the 
pharmacological target (C5) as a function of dose, and the same free eculizumab concentration will not 
necessarily lead to the same response if the target concentration is different. Therefore, the specific numbers 
from the modelling and simulation exercise are not agreed with; however, the applicant’s overall conclusion 
that lower dose levels would have a decreased power to establish biosimilarity (if the products are biosimilar) 
is agreed with. 
Efficacy 
Inclusion of only subjects who are stable on eculizumab treatment already at baseline is considered 
insensitive and as such suboptimal in terms of comparison of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of ABP 959 
and Soliris. There are inevitable carryover effects at the time of randomisation and also between study 
periods. Furthermore, inclusion of only patients stable on eculizumab treatment excludes any subjects who 
discontinued previous eculizumab treatment due to not responding to eculizumab or tolerating it.  
The primary efficacy endpoint LDH is not specific to haemolysis but is also an inflammatory biomarker, which 
increases due to acute infections and other illnesses, trauma and surgery. LDH values deemed by the 
independent LDH Review Committee to have been impacted by confounding events unrelated to efficacy of 
investigational product were excluded from the analysis. Further clarifications by the applicant confirmed that 
the decision by the reviewers and adjudicator were based on totality of data on clinical events and LDH 
levels. Hence, the exclusion of LDH measurements was impacted by the measured values themselves, which 
is not acceptable in principle. Unbiased assessment of results from randomised studies requires that all 
subjects are observed and treated according to the same rules. These rules should be independent from 
treatment or outcome. In consequence, the decision to exclude a subject from the statistical analysis must be 
made before bioanalysis (CHMP Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence). The reviewers also 
considered the laboratory notes indicating tube haemolysis; however, no information was provided as to 
whether tube haemolysis in the specimen was detected by the lab prior to bioanalysis or otherwise 
independently of the result. Furthermore, there are instances where a reviewer flagged an LDH measurement 
for exclusion due to tube haemolysis while the other reviewer did not. This suggests that the comments from 
the laboratory did not clearly indicate that the specimen was found invalid due to tube haemolysis. For these 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 104/113 
 
 
 
reasons the LDH review procedure leading to exclusion of LDH values from the analysis aiming to 
demonstrate equivalence is unacceptable in principle. 
Safety 
In the comparative efficacy and safety study, there were some differences in frequencies of certain TEAEs, 
although the total amount of AEs was comparable. Adverse events where the difference in frequency in the 
ABP 959 treatment group was ≥ 10% when compared with the Soliris treatment group included 
nasopharyngitis (9 [22.0%] subjects receiving ABP 959 and 3 [7.1%] subjects receiving eculizumab) and 
pyrexia (9 [22.0%] and 2 [4.8%], respectively). The frequency of these events was expected per the Soliris 
labelling.  
Although the immunogenic potential of the reference product seems low, comparative evaluation of 
immunogenicity is an important part of the overall biosimilar comparability exercise. In the current 
programme, immunogenicity data derive from two different studies and populations: the PK/PD Similarity 
Study in healthy volunteers and the supportive Comparative Clinical Study in PNH. It remains uncertain 
whether the PK/PD study, in which 300 mg was given as single dose with last ADA assessment at day 57, 
was sensitive enough to detect potential differences in ADA. In particular, the evaluation may not be optimal 
for a comparative ADA-assessment of a biosimilar intended for long-term use. In the comparative clinical 
study in PNH-patients the risk of developing clinically meaningful immunogenicity was inherently low as only 
patients already on stable Soliris treatment were included. Moreover, as the expected incidence of ADA 
formation would have been around 1−2 subjects in a sample of 42 subjects even without this selection bias, it 
can be concluded that this study was not adequate to demonstrate similarity in terms of immunogenicity. 
Therefore, no final conclusion on similarity regarding immunogenicity can be made based on the clinical data, 
however no difference in ADA formation was seen. 
Since Bekemv contains sorbitol, unlike the originator Soliris, use of Bekemv would pose a risk for subjects 
with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). As children below the age of 2 years may not yet have been 
diagnosed with HFI, a contraindication for use in this age group was added and the applicant has proposed 
risk minimisation measures for controlling this risk. Upon request, the applicant included in the Product 
Information also a contraindication for patients with hereditary fructose intolerance. Additionally, the outer 
packaging was changed to include a warning that patients with HFI and babies and children below 2 years of 
age must not be given this medicine due to the risk of sorbitol exposure. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Quality 
The applicant has provided a very comprehensive analytical comparability exercise using appropriate state-
of-the-art analytical methods to ensure a full understanding of the Soliris-EU and Soliris-US product profiles 
and the ABP 959 product developed. The presented biological and physiochemical data are extensive and 
convincingly support the claim of biosimilarity for ABP 959.  
Nonclinical 
The in vitro and ex vivo functional activity data support the biosimilarity of ABP-959 versus the Soliris-EU 
(and Soliris-US).  
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 105/113 
 
 
 
Clinical 
Pharmacokinetics 
The PK biosimilarity in the pivotal PK/PD study 20150164 using healthy male subjects has been formally 
demonstrated between ABP 959 and Soliris-EU and Soliris-US as for the primary PK parameters Cmax, AUClast 
and AUCinf, the 90% CI for the ratio of test-to-reference/comparator fell within the acceptance range of 
80.00-125.00%.  
Pharmacodynamics 
PD similarity was formally shown in healthy male subjects in the pivotal PK/PD study 20150164. In the phase 
3 study 20150168, a small difference is seen in PD as measured by CH50 in favour of the reference product 
Soliris. The difference is seemingly driven by lower exposure of eculizumab in four individuals, resulting in 
less effective suppression of the complement pathway. Further analyses conducted on these four subjects 
showed no clear pattern of differences in eculizumab trough concentrations and CH50 during treatment with 
ABP 959 vs. Soliris, even though the values varied at different sampling points. Therefore, the lower 
eculizumab trough concentration and higher CH50 in these subjects is deemed to be related to patient and 
not to the treatment. 
In scientific advice given to the applicant, the CHMP recommended that the applicant should study more than 
one dose level because evidence of comparability in terms of dose-response would strengthen the overall 
robustness of the comparability exercise. The applicant has not followed this advice, and the phase 1 study 
only includes one dose level (300 mg). The applicant has used modelling and simulation to justify that lower 
doses would have a decreased statistical power to demonstrate biosimilarity in terms of PK and PD, if the 
reference and test product are assumed biosimilar. Even though the CHMP does not agree with all the details 
pertaining to this modelling and simulation exercise, the CHMP agrees with the primary conclusion that lower 
doses would have a decreased statistical power to demonstrate biosimilarity due to decreasing signal-to-
noise ratio. Moreover, it is acknowledged that the currently conducted phase 1 trial did explore both the 
maximal CH50 response measurable with the bioanalytical method, and the CH50 response at very low 
eculizumab concentrations. As such, not much additional information would be expected from clinical studies 
with additional dose levels.  
Efficacy 
The target population in the single phase 3 study are adult PNH subjects stable on eculizumab, who were 
randomised to switch to ABP 959 or to continue with Soliris, with a parallel comparative period of one year 
(period 1 of the study), after which the patients crossed over to the alternative treatment. This assessment is 
based on the parallel comparison (Period 1 of the study). This maintenance setting is considered relatively 
insensitive for demonstration of potential differences in efficacy and safety. Furthermore, the study is small, 
with only 42 participants. However, the degree of analytical and functional similarity between ABP 959 and 
the reference medicinal product seems to be very high. Furthermore, the efficacy results obtained reasonably 
support a conclusion of biosimilarity of ABP 959 and Soliris. Hence, the currently available clinical data can be 
considered supportive of similar efficacy. 
Safety 
The clinical data is limited and can only provide supportive information on comparability of safety and 
immunogenicity. Safety findings were presented for a total of 259 subjects. Of these 71 healthy subjects and 
41 PNH patients received ABP 959. In the comparative efficacy and safety (phase 3) study, the risk of 
experiencing adverse events was inherently low as only patients already on stable Soliris treatment (i.e., 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 106/113 
 
 
 
subjects with established good tolerance for treatment) were included. Nevertheless, relevant safety issues 
would have been detectable.  
In the phase 3 study, there were some differences in frequencies of certain TEAEs, although the total amount 
of AEs was comparable. The seemingly large percentual difference between groups regarding some of the 
preferred terms does not preclude biosimilarity as the number of subjects is too small for meaningful analysis 
and the frequency of reported AEs in both treatment arms are in line with those reported for Soliris in the 
SmPC. All SAEs were single events and review of the individual events did not identify any new safety 
concerns or new pattern of serious adverse events.  
The larger single-dose study in healthy subjects showed similar frequencies of AEs and SAEs between 
treatment arms. 
In conclusion, no meaningful difference between ABP 959 and Soliris could be seen in terms of nature, grade 
or frequency of adverse events. The safety of both investigational products was consistent with the known 
safety profile of Soliris. 
Overall discussion on biosimilarity 
Eculizumab has a well-known and well-understood mode of action, which can be thoroughly investigated in 
binding and functional in vitro tests. In PNH-patients there is uncontrolled terminal complement activation 
resulting in complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody which 
binds to human C5 complement protein and inhibits the activation of terminal complement, thereby inhibiting 
haemolysis. Therefore, efficacy of eculizumab can be seen directly related to the biological events triggered 
by the binding of eculizumab to its known target; the structure–function relationship is well known. Hence, a 
good correlation between clinical efficacy and pharmacological effect could be derived from comparable 
binding properties and functional characteristics. Further, there are relevant, validated PD markers (lactate 
dehydrogenase, a sensitive albeit not specific biochemical marker of intravascular haemolysis; and CH50, 
sensitive biomarker for reduced C5 functional activity), which reflect the mechanism of action of eculizumab 
and are suitable and sensitive to detect potential differences between the proposed biosimilar and the RMP. 
Additionally, other PD parameters are available to assess the comparability of the PD properties of the RMP 
and proposed biosimilar (like haemoglobin, haptoglobin, bilirubin, etc). 
ABP 959 has been very comprehensively characterised with suitable, sensitive and orthogonal assays for 
structural, analytical and functional characterisation. The degree of analytical and functional similarity 
between ABP 959 and reference medicinal product is high. In addition, a comparative PK study demonstrated 
bioequivalence between Bekemv and RMP; in the same PK-study similar inhibition of C5 activity was 
demonstrated (via the PD-marker CH50), providing adequate clinical evidence to support biosimilarity. These 
data (quality and PK/PD) are considered pivotal for the biosimilarity assessment and are in this specific case 
considered sufficient for a conclusion of biosimilarity.  
The clinical comparative efficacy and safety study 20150168 (with only 20 and 22 patients in the ABP 959 
and RMP groups) is considered to be only a supportive study here in the context of biosimilarity, as sufficient 
evidence of biosimilarity can be inferred from other parts of the comparability exercise. Thus, even if there 
are uncertainties related to assessment of efficacy and safety in this comparative study, these are not 
considered to be of such importance, that they would question biosimilarity.  
Also, considering the highly similar physicochemical characteristics and PK/PD profiles of ABP 959 and RMP, 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 107/113 
 
 
 
 
 
and the overall safety data from the two clinical studies, there is sufficient reassurance that clinically relevant 
differences also in safety side can be excluded. 
Related to immunogenicity, there is clinical experience with the RMP, which has been marketed since 2007, 
originally for the treatment of PNH. Research data and clinical experience have demonstrated that the 
immunogenic potential of eculizumab is low, and the ADAs have been of no clinical concern with eculizumab. 
This allows for a risk-based assessment of immunogenicity also for ABP 959. 
Immunogenicity is expected for ABP 959 as for all products manufactured from a CHO cell line. Further 
selection of the desired cell line is achieved by growing the cells in the presence of methotrexate.  
In order to mitigate the potential immunogenicity risk; all the quality attributes potentially related to 
immunogenicity (like protein aggregates, impurities, host cell proteins) have been established and have been 
shown to be highly similar between the RMP and ABP 959.  
Therefore, the immunogenicity risk has been minimised in the manufacture of ABP 959 and the 
immunogenicity profile is expected to be similar between Bekemv and Soliris on the quality level. 
This is supported by the clinical studies which showed that in the single-dose PK/PD-study only a few 
subjects (3/71 and 6/73 with ABP 959 and Soliris-EU, respectively) developed treatment-emergent ADAs. In 
the 20150168-study, only transient ADA positivity was detected in two subjects, both in the ABP 959 group.  
Therefore, it can be assumed with sufficient certainty that immunogenicity of ABP 959 is comparable to that 
of the RMP.  
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
Extrapolation to treatment-naïve and paediatric subjects has been justified by the applicant. PK/PD similarity 
between ABP 959 and Soliris-US and Soliris-EU was demonstrated in healthy males in study 20150164.  
Since only adult PNH patients already stable on eculizumab were included in study 20150168, the expected 
effect size is small and sensitivity of the study for detecting differences in efficacy and safety is low. However, 
the obtained results on the primary efficacy endpoint LDH and secondary efficacy endpoints, including time 
course of LDH, other laboratory measures of haemolysis, and other indicators of disease activity (type III 
erythrocytes, RBC infusions) are not contradictory of similar clinical efficacy of ABP 959 with Soliris.  
The PD measure CH50 was in most subjects under LLOQ in this study, questioning the sensitivity of the 
method for detecting difference. Furthermore, the study with only 42 subjects is small for confirmation of 
clinical similarity. Consequently, assessment of clinical biosimilarity of ABP 959 and Soliris is based mostly on 
the PK/PD study 20150164, and clinical efficacy and safety results from study 20150168 can be considered in 
principle supportive data. Hence, the extrapolation exercise also relies primarily on study 20150164. 
The applicant refers to published literature on the reference product Soliris. The mode of action of eculizumab 
is similar across approved indications of Soliris and across different patient groups with PNH. Dedicated 
studies to evaluate the PK of Soliris or ABP 959 have not been conducted in special patient populations 
identified by gender, race, age (geriatric), or the presence of renal or hepatic impairment. However, the PK of 
Soliris was evaluated in a phase I/II study in PNH paediatric patients (ranging in age from 11 to 17 years), 
and population PK analyses on data collected across studies demonstrated that age, gender, race, and renal 
function do not influence the PK of eculizumab. Consistent PK parameters were seen across PNH patient 
populations, including those naïve to Soliris treatment, those stable on Soliris treatment, and across both 
adult and paediatric PNH patients. The applicant also provides a brief summary of publicly available results 
from studies in PNH regarding impact of intrinsic (such as age, gender, race, body weight, or renal 
Assessment report  
EMA/114622/2023 
Page 108/113 
 
 
 
  
 
impairment) and extrinsic factors (concomitant medications) on the PK, safety, or effectiveness of 
eculizumab. Population PK analyses on data collected across studies showed that age (geriatric), gender, or 
race do not influence the PK of eculizumab. Body weight was a significant factor resulting in a lower 
eculizumab clearance in paediatric/adolescent patients, consequently, body weight based eculizumab dosing 
is required for paediatric PNH patients. Renal impairment did not affect the PK of eculizumab in PNH patients. 
Soliris product information and published studies support the conclusion that there is a consistent and 
comparable safety profile across the approved patient populations. Anti-drug-antibody responses have been 
detected infrequently across indications and patient populations approved for Soliris, and there has been no 
observed correlation of antibody development to efficacy and safety. 
As a conclusion, the justifications given by the applicant regarding all PNH-related indications and the 
available data for ABP 959 are deemed sufficient for extrapolation to the sought indication for use: “BEKEMV 
is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH)”. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
ABP959 (in contrast to the reference product) is a sorbitol-containing product. Medicines containing 
sorbitol/fructose given intravenously may be life-threatening in patients with HFI and should be 
contraindicated in this population unless there is an overwhelming clinical need and no alternatives are 
available (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/information-package-leaflet-
regarding-fructose-sorbitol-used-excipients-medicinal-products-human-use_en.pdf). Children below 2 years 
of age may not yet be diagnosed with HFI. Therefore, Bekemv was decided to be contraindicated in children 
below 2 years of age and in subjects with HFI.  
Wording of the indication 
It is considered that the exact wording of the indication of Bekemv should remain the same as with the 
reference medicinal product Soliris, i.e. without any age limits, even though there is a new contraindication 
for Bekemv (compared to the RMP) in all children less than 2 years of age and subjects with hereditary 
fructose intolerance (regardless of age) due to large amounts of sorbitol in the formulation. This is in line 
with “the Wording of therapeutic indication, A Guide for Assessors of Centralised Applications 
EMA/CHMP/483022/2019”, where it is clearly stated that if the benefit/risk is negative in a subgroup based 
on safety issue, this should be reflected in a contraindication (not in the indication). Furthermore, the risk 
minimisation measures (educational material etc.) are considered adequate for mitigating this risk, in 
addition to the contraindication, and therefore no restriction of the indication is considered necessary for 
children below 2 years of age.  
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Bekemv is considered biosimilar to Soliris. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded with one exception. Due to the 
metabolic risk caused by the relatively high sorbitol content of Bekemv, use of Bekemv is contraindicated for 
patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) and for children <2 years of age, whereas Soliris contains 
no sorbitol and can be used also in these subgroups.

4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Bekemv is not similar to Aspaveli within the meaning of Article 
3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See Appendix on Similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Bekemv is favourable in the following indication: 
Bekemv is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). 
Evidence of clinical benefit is demonstrated in patients with haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of 
high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
TAGRISSO as monotherapy is indicated for:


the adjuvant treatment after complete tumour resection in adult patients with stage IB-IIIA non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations (see section 5.1).
the first-line treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating
EGFR mutations.
2

the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive 
NSCLC.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with TAGRISSO should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
therapies. 
When considering the use of TAGRISSO, EGFR mutation status (in tumour specimens for adjuvant 
treatment and tumour or plasma specimens for locally advanced or metastatic setting) should be 
determined using a validated test method (see section 4.4).
Posology
The recommended dose is 80 mg osimertinib once a day.
Patients in the adjuvant setting should receive treatment until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. 
Treatment duration for more than 3 years was not studied. 
Patients with locally advanced or metastatic lung cancer should receive treatment until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity. 
If a dose of TAGRISSO is missed, the dose should be made up unless the next dose is due within 12 
hours.
TAGRISSO can be taken with or without food at the same time each day.
Dose adjustments
Dosing interruption and/or dose reduction may be required based on individual safety and tolerability. If 
dose reduction is necessary, then the dose should be reduced to 40 mg taken once daily.
Dose reduction guidelines for adverse reactions toxicities are provided in Table 1.

Special populations
No dose adjustment is required due to patient age, body weight, gender, ethnicity and smoking status (see 
section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
Based on clinical studies, no dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment
(Child Pugh A) or moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B). Similarly, based on population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(total bilirubin ≤upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >ULN or total 
bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5x ULN and any AST) or moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin between 1.5 to 
3 times ULN and any AST). The safety and efficacy of this medicinal product has not been established in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment. Until additional data become available, use in patients with 
severe hepatic impairment is not recommended (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
Based on clinical studies and population PK analysis, no dose adjustments are necessary in patients with 
mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment. The safety and efficacy of this medicinal product has not been 
established in patients with end-stage renal disease [creatinine clearance (CLcr) less than 15 mL/min, 
calculated by the Cockcroft and Gault equation], or on dialysis. Caution should be exercised when treating 
patients with severe and end-stage renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of TAGRISSO in children or adolescents aged less than 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available.
Method of administration
This medicinal product is for oral use. The tablet should be swallowed whole with water and it should not 
be crushed, split or chewed.
If the patient is unable to swallow the tablet, the tablet may first be dispersed in 50 mL of non-carbonated 
water. It should be dropped in the water, without crushing, stirred until dispersed and immediately 
swallowed. An additional half a glass of water should be added to ensure that no residue remains and then 
immediately swallowed. No other liquids should be added.
If administration via nasogastric tube is required, the same process as above should be followed but using 
volumes of 15 mL for the initial dispersion and 15 mL for the residue rinses. The resulting 30 mL of liquid 
4
should be administered as per the naso-gastric tube manufacturer’s instructions with appropriate water 
flushes. The dispersion and residues should be administered within 30 minutes of the addition of the 
tablets to water.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
St. John’s Wort should not be used together with TAGRISSO (see section 4.5).
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Assessment of EGFR mutation status
When considering the use of TAGRISSO as adjuvant treatment after complete tumour resection in patients 
with NSCLC, it is important that the EGFR mutation positive status (exon 19 deletions (Ex19del) or exon 
21 L858R substitution mutations (L858R)) indicates treatment eligibility. A validated test should be 
performed in a clinical laboratory using tumour tissue DNA from biopsy or surgical specimen.
When considering the use of TAGRISSO as a treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, it is 
important that the EGFR mutation positive status is determined. A validated test should be performed 
using either tumour DNA derived from a tissue sample or circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) obtained 
from a plasma sample.
Positive determination of EGFR mutation status (activating EGFR mutations for first-line treatment or 
T790M mutations following progression on or after EGFR TKI therapy) using either a tissue-based or 
plasma-based test indicates eligibility for treatment with TAGRISSO. However, if a plasma-based ctDNA 
test is used and the result is negative, it is advisable to follow-up with a tissue test wherever possible due 
to the potential for false negative results using a plasma-based test.
Only robust, reliable and sensitive tests with demonstrated utility for the determination of EGFR mutation 
status should be used.
Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
Severe, life-threatening or fatal ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions (e.g. pneumonitis) have been observed 
in patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical studies. Most cases improved or resolved with interruption 
of treatment. Patients with a past medical history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis that 
required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD were excluded from clinical studies 
(see section 4.8).
ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions were reported in 3.8% of the 1479 patients who received TAGRISSO in 
the ADAURA, FLAURA and AURA studies. Five fatal cases were reported in the locally advanced or 
metastatic setting. No fatal cases were reported in the adjuvant setting. The incidence of ILD was 11.3% in 
patients of Japanese ethnicity, 1.6% in patients of Asian ethnicity and 2.5% in non-Asian patients (see 
section 4.8).
Careful assessment of all patients with an acute onset and/or unexplained worsening of pulmonary 
symptoms (dyspnoea, cough, fever) should be performed to exclude ILD. Treatment with this medicinal 
product should be interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms. If ILD is diagnosed, TAGRISSO 
should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated as necessary. Reintroduction of TAGRISSO 
should be considered only after careful consideration of the individual patient’s benefits and risk.
5
Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCARs)
Case reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been
reported with frequency categories of rare and not known, respectively, in association with TAGRISSO 
treatment. Before initiating treatment, patients should be advised of signs and symptoms of SJS and TEN.
If signs and symptoms suggestive of SJS or TEN appear, TAGRISSO should be interrupted. TAGRISSO 
should be discontinued immediately if SJS or TEN are diagnosed.
QTc interval prolongation
QTc interval prolongation occurs in patients treated with TAGRISSO. QTc interval prolongation may lead 
to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. torsade de pointes) or sudden death. No 
arrhythmic events were reported in ADAURA, FLAURA or AURA studies (see section 4.8). Patients with 
clinically important abnormalities in rhythm and conduction as measured by resting electrocardiogram 
(ECG) (e.g. QTc interval greater than 470 msec) were excluded from these studies (see section 4.8).
When possible, the use of osimertinib in patients with congenital long QT syndrome should be avoided. 
Periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electrolytes should be considered in patients 
with congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medicinal products that 
are known to prolong the QTc interval. Treatment should be withheld in patients who develop a QTc 
interval greater than 500 msec on at least 2 separate ECGs until the QTc interval is less than 481 msec or 
recovery to baseline if the QTc interval is greater than or equal to 481 msec, then resume TAGRISSO at a 
reduced dose as described in Table 1. Osimertinib should be permanently discontinued in patients who 
develop QTc interval prolongation in combination with any of the following: Torsade de pointes, 
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia.
Changes in cardiac contractility
Across clinical studies, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreases greater than or equal to 
10 percentage points and a drop to less than 50% occurred in 3.2% (40/1233) of patients treated with 
TAGRISSO who had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment. In patients with cardiac risk 
factors and those with conditions that can affect LVEF, cardiac monitoring, including an assessment of 
LVEF at baseline and during treatment, should be considered. In patients who develop relevant cardiac 
signs/symptoms during treatment, cardiac monitoring including LVEF assessment should be considered.
In an adjuvant placebo-controlled study (ADAURA), 1.6% (5/312) of patients treated with TAGRISSO 
and 1.5% (5/331) of patients treated with placebo experienced LVEF decreases greater than or equal to 
10 percentage points and a drop to less than 50%.
Keratitis
Keratitis was reported in 0.7% (n=10) of the 1479 patients treated with TAGRISSO in the ADAURA, 
FLAURA and AURA studies. Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis such as 
acute or worsening: eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red 
eye should be referred promptly to an ophthalmology specialist (see section 4.2 Table 1).
Aplastic Anaemia
Rare cases of aplastic anaemia, including fatal events, have been reported in association with osimertinib
treatment. Before initiating treatment, patients should be advised of signs and symptoms of aplastic 
anaemia including but not limited to persistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor, infection and fatigue. If 
signs and symptoms suggestive of aplastic anaemia develop, close patient monitoring and drug 
interruption or discontinuation of osimertinib should be considered. Osimertinib should be discontinued in 
patients with confirmed aplastic anaemia (see section 4.2).
6
Age and body weight
Elderly patients (>65 years) or patients with low body weight (<50 kg) may be at increased risk of 
developing adverse events of Grade 3 or higher. Close monitoring is recommended in these patients (see 
section 4.8).
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Strong CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the exposure of osimertinib. Osimertinib may increase the 
exposure of breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates.
Active substances that may increase osimertinib plasma concentrations
In vitro studies have demonstrated that the Phase I metabolism of osimertinib is predominantly via 
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. In a clinical pharmacokinetic study in patients, co-administration with 200 mg 
itraconazole twice daily (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) had no clinically significant effect on the exposure 
of osimertinib (area under the curve (AUC) increased by 24% and Cmax decreased by 20%). Therefore, 
CYP3A4 inhibitors are not likely to affect the exposure of osimertinib. Further catalyzing enzymes have 
not been identified.
Active substances that may decrease osimertinib plasma concentrations
In a clinical pharmacokinetic study in patients, the steady-state AUC of osimertinib was reduced by 78% 
when co-administered with rifampicin (600 mg daily for 21 days). Similarly, the exposure to metabolite 
AZ5104 decreased by 82% for the AUC and 78% for Cmax. It is recommended that concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. Phenytoin, rifampicin and carbamazepine) with TAGRISSO should be 
avoided. Moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil) may also decrease 
osimertinib exposure and should be used with caution, or avoided when possible. There are no clinical 
data available to recommend a dose adjustment of TAGRISSO. Concomitant use of St. John’s Wort is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3).
Effect of gastric acid reducing active substances on osimertinib
In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, co-administration of omeprazole did not result in clinically relevant 
changes in osimertinib exposures. Gastric pH modifying agents can be concomitantly used with 
TAGRISSO without any restrictions.
Active substances whose plasma concentrations may be altered by TAGRISSO
Based on in vitro studies, osimertinib is a competitive inhibitor of BCRP transporters.
In a clinical PK study, co-administration of TAGRISSO with rosuvastatin (sensitive BCRP substrate) 
increased the AUC and Cmax of rosuvastatin by 35% and 72%, respectively. Patients taking concomitant 
medicinal products with disposition dependent upon BCRP and with narrow therapeutic index should be 
closely monitored for signs of changed tolerability of the concomitant medication as a result of increased 
exposure whilst receiving TAGRISSO (see section 5.2).
7
In a clinical PK study, co-administration of TAGRISSO with simvastatin (sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) 
decreased the AUC and Cmax of simvastatin by 9% and 23% respectively. These changes are small and not 
likely to be of clinical significance. Clinical PK interactions with CYP3A4 substrates are unlikely. A risk
for decreased exposure of hormonal contraceptives cannot be excluded.
In a clinical Pregnane X Receptor (PXR) interaction study, co-administration of TAGRISSO with 
fexofenadine (P-gp substrate) increased the AUC and Cmax of fexofenadine by 56% (90% CI 35, 79) and 
76% (90% CI 49, 108) after a single dose and 27% (90% CI 11, 46) and 25% (90% CI 6, 48) at steady-
state, respectively. Patients taking concomitant medications with disposition dependent upon P-gp and 
with narrow therapeutic index (e.g. digoxin, dabigatran, aliskiren) should be closely monitored for signs of 
changed tolerability as a result of increased exposure of the concomitant medication whilst receiving 
TAGRISSO (see section 5.2). 
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving 
TAGRISSO. Patients should be advised to use effective contraception for the following periods after 
completion of treatment with this medicinal product: at least 2 months for females and 4 months for males. 
A risk for decreased exposure of hormonal contraceptives cannot be excluded.
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of osimertinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity (embryolethality, reduced foetal growth, and neonatal death, see section 
5.3). Based on its mechanism of action and preclinical data, osimertinib may cause foetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. TAGRISSO should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical 
condition of the woman requires treatment with osimertinib.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether osimertinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. There is insufficient
information on the excretion of osimertinib/metabolites in animal milk. However, osimertinib and its 
metabolites were detected in the suckling pups and there was poor pup growth and a reduction in pup 
survival (see section 5.3). A risk to the suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be 
discontinued during treatment with TAGRISSO.
Fertility
There are no data on the effect of TAGRISSO on human fertility. Results from animal studies have shown 
that osimertinib has effects on male and female reproductive organs and could impair fertility (see section 
5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
TAGRISSO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Studies in EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC patients
The data described below reflect exposure to TAGRISSO in 1479 patients with EGFR mutation-positive 
non-small cell lung cancer. These patients received TAGRISSO at a dose of 80 mg daily in three
randomised Phase 3 studies (ADAURA, adjuvant; FLAURA, first line and AURA3, second line only), 
two single-arm studies (AURAex and AURA2, second line or later) and one Phase 1 study (AURA1, 
first-line or later) (see section 5.1). Most adverse reactions were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most 
commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were diarrhoea (47%), rash (45%), paronychia (33%), 
dry skin (32%), and stomatitis (24%). Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse reactions across the studies were 10% 
and 0.1%, respectively. In patients treated with TAGRISSO 80 mg once daily, dose reductions due to 
adverse reactions occurred in 3.4% of the patients. Discontinuation due to adverse reactions was 4.8%.
Patients with a medical history of ILD, drug-induced ILD, radiation pneumonitis that required steroid 
treatment, or any evidence of clinically active ILD were excluded from clinical studies. Patients with 
clinically important abnormalities in rhythm and conduction as measured by resting electrocardiogram 
(ECG) (e.g. QTc interval greater than 470 msec) were excluded from these studies. Patients were 
evaluated for LVEF at screening and every 12 weeks thereafter.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions have been assigned to the frequency categories in Table 2 where possible based on the 
incidence of comparable adverse event reports in a pooled dataset from the 1479 EGFR mutation-positive 
NSCLC patients who received TAGRISSO at a dose of 80 mg daily in the ADAURA, FLAURA, 
AURA3, AURAex, AURA 2 and AURA1 studies. 
Adverse reactions are listed according to system organ class (SOC) in MedDRA. Within each system 
organ class, the adverse drug reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the CIOMS III 
convention and is defined as: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 
<1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from 
available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
In the ADAURA, FLAURA and AURA studies, the incidence of ILD was 11% in patients of Japanese 
ethnicity, 1.6% in patients of non-Japanese Asian ethnicity and 2.5% in non-Asian patients. The median 
time to onset of ILD or ILD-like adverse reactions was 84 days (see section 4.4).
QTc interval prolongation
Of the 1479 patients in ADAURA, FLAURA and AURA studies treated with TAGRISSO 80 mg, 0.8% of 
patients (n=12) were found to have a QTc greater than 500 msec, and 3.1% of patients (n=46) had an 
increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 msec. A pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic analysis with 
TAGRISSO predicted a concentration-dependent increase in QTc interval prolongation. No QTc-related 
arrhythmias were reported in the ADAURA, FLAURA or AURA studies (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Gastrointestinal effects 
In the ADAURA, FLAURA and AURA studies, diarrhoea was reported in 47% of patients of which 38% 
were Grade 1 events, 7.9% Grade 2 and 1.4% were Grade 3; no Grade 4 or 5 events were reported. Dose 
reduction was required in 0.3% of patients and dose interruption in 2%. Four events (0.3%) led to 
discontinuation. In ADAURA, FLAURA and AURA3 the median time to onset was 22 days, 19 days and 
22 days, respectively, and the median duration of the Grade 2 events was 11 days, 19 days and 6 days, 
respectively.
Haematological events
Early reductions in the median laboratory counts of leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and platelets 
have been observed in patients treated with TAGRISSO, which stabilised over time and then remained 
above the lower limit of normal. Adverse events of leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia have been reported, most of which were mild or moderate in severity and did not lead 
to dose interruptions. Rare cases of aplastic anaemia, including fatal events, have been reported in 
11
association with osimertinib treatment. Osimertinib should be discontinued in patients with confirmed 
aplastic anaemia (see section 4.2 and 4.4).
Elderly
In ADAURA, FLAURA and AURA3 (N=1479), 43% of patients were 65 years of age and older, and 12% 
were 75 years of age and older. Compared with younger subjects (<65), more subjects ≥65 years old had 
reported adverse reactions that led to study dose modifications (interruptions or reductions) (16% versus 
9%). The types of adverse events reported were similar regardless of age. Older patients reported more 
Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions compared to younger patients (13% versus 8%). No overall 
differences in efficacy were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. A consistent pattern in 
safety and efficacy results was observed in the analysis of AURA Phase 2 studies.
Low body weight
Patients receiving TAGRISSO 80 mg with low body weight (<50 kg) reported higher frequencies of 
Grade ≥3 adverse events (46% versus 31%) and QTc prolongation (12% versus 5%) than patients with 
higher body weight (≥50 kg).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
In TAGRISSO clinical studies a limited number of patients were treated with daily doses of up to 240 mg 
without dose limiting toxicities. In these studies, patients who were treated with TAGRISSO daily doses 
of 160 mg and 240 mg experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of a number of typical EGFR 
TKI-induced AEs (primarily diarrhoea and skin rash) compared to the 80 mg dose. There is limited 
experience with accidental overdoses in humans. All cases were isolated incidents of patients taking an 
additional daily dose of TAGRISSO in error, without any resulting clinical consequences.
There is no specific treatment in the event of TAGRISSO overdose. In case of suspected overdose, 
TAGRISSO should be withheld and symptomatic treatment initiated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors; ATC code: L01EB04.
Mechanism of action
Osimertinib is a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI). It is an irreversible inhibitor of EGFRs harboring 
sensitising-mutations (EGFRm) and TKI-resistance mutation T790M.
12
Pharmacodynamic effects
In vitro studies have demonstrated that osimertinib has high potency and inhibitory activity against EGFR 
across a range of all clinically relevant EGFR sensitising-mutant and T790M mutant NSCLC cell lines 
(apparent IC50s from 6 nM to 54 nM against phospho-EGFR). This leads to inhibition of cell growth, 
while showing significantly less activity against EGFR in wild-type cell lines (apparent IC50s from 480 
nM to 1.8 μM against phospho-EGFR). In vivo oral administration of osimertinib lead to tumour shrinkage 
in both EGFRm and T790M NSCLC xenograft and transgenic mouse lung tumour models.
Cardiac electrophysiology
The QTc interval prolongation potential of TAGRISSO was assessed in 210 patients who received 
osimertinib 80 mg daily in AURA2. Serial ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady-
state to evaluate the effect of osimertinib on QTc intervals. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis 
predicted a drug-related QTc interval prolongation at 80 mg of 14 msec with an upper bound of 16 msec 
(90% CI).
Clinical efficacy and safety
Adjuvant treatment of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, with or without prior adjuvant chemotherapy –
ADAURA
The efficacy and safety of TAGRISSO for the adjuvant treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive 
(Ex19del or L858R) NSCLC who have had complete tumour resection with or without prior adjuvant 
chemotherapy was demonstrated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ADAURA).
Eligible patients with resectable tumors stage IB – IIIA (according to American Joint Commission on 
Cancer [AJCC] 7th edition) were required to have EGFR mutations (Ex19del or L858R), identified by the 
cobas EGFR Mutation Test performed prospectively using biopsy or surgical specimen in a central 
laboratory. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive TAGRISSO (n=339, 80 mg orally once daily) or placebo (n=343) 
following recovery from surgery and standard adjuvant chemotherapy where given. Patients not receiving 
adjuvant chemotherapy were randomised within 10 weeks and patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy 
within 26 weeks following surgery. Randomisation was stratified by EGFR mutation type (Ex19del or 
L858R), ethnicity (Asian or non-Asian) and staging based on percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy 
(pTNM) (IB or II or IIIA) according to AJCC 7th edition. Treatment was given until disease recurrence, 
unacceptable toxicity, or for 3 years. 
The major efficacy outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS) by investigator assessment in the 
stage II-IIIA population. DFS by investigator assessment in the stage IB-IIIA population (overall 
population) was an additional efficacy outcome measure. Other additional efficacy outcome measures 
included DFS rate, overall survival (OS), OS rate, and time to deterioration in health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) SF-36.
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the overall population were: median age 63 years 
(range 30-86 years), ≥75 years old (11%), female (70%), Asian (64%), never smokers (72%), World 
Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 (64%) or 1 (36%), stage IB (31%), stage II (34%), 
and IIIA (35%). With regards to EGFR mutation status 55% were exon 19 deletions and 45% were exon 
21 L858R substitution mutations; 9 patients (1%) also had a concurrent de novo T790M mutation. The 
majority (60%) of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy prior to randomization (26% IB; 71% IIA; 
73% IIB; 80% IIIA). At the time of the DFS analysis, 205 (61%) patients were still on active treatment; of 
the 73 (11%) patients who had the opportunity to complete the 3-year treatment period, 40 (12%) were in 
the osimertinib arm and 33 (10%) in the placebo arm. 
13
There were 37 patients who had disease recurrence on TAGRISSO. The most commonly reported sites of 
recurrence were: lung (19 patients); lymph nodes (10 patients) and central nervous system (CNS)
(5 patients). There were 157 patients who had disease recurrence on placebo. The most commonly 
reported sites were: lung (61 patients); lymph nodes (48 patients) and CNS (34 patients). 
ADAURA demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death for 
patients treated with TAGRISSO compared to patients treated with placebo in the stage II-IIIA population. 
Similar results were observed in the stage IB-IIIA population.
Efficacy results from ADAURA by investigator assessment are summarised in Table 3.

The final analysis of OS (data cut-off: 27 January 2023) demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in OS for patients treated with TAGRISSO compared to placebo for both the stage II-IIIA 
population (100 OS events [21% maturity]; HR=0.49; 95.03% CI: 0.33, 0.73; p-value=0.0004) and the 
overall population (IB-IIIA; 124 OS events [18% maturity]; HR=0.49; 95.03% CI: 0.34, 0.70; p-value 
< 0.0001). For both populations, the median OS was not reached in either treatment arm and the 95% CIs 
were not calculable. The median follow-up time for OS in all patients was 59.9 months (stage II-IIIA 
14
population) and 60.4 months (stage IB-IIIA population) in the TAGRISSO arm and 56.2 months (stage II-
IIIA population) and 59.4 months (stage IB-IIIA population) in the placebo arm.

An exploratory analysis of CNS DFS (time to CNS recurrence or death) for patients on TAGRISSO
compared to patients on placebo showed a HR of 0.18 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.33; p <0.0001) for the overall 
population (stage IB-IIIA).
Patient reported outcomes
Health-related quality of life (HRQL) in ADAURA was assessed using the Short Form (36) Health Survey 
version 2 (SF-36v2) questionnaire. SF-36v2 was administered at 12 weeks, 24 weeks and then every 24 
weeks relative to randomisation until treatment completion or discontinuation. Overall, HRQL was 
maintained in both arms up to 30 months, with at least 70% of patients in the stage II-IIIA population not 
experiencing a clinically meaningful deterioration in the physical component of the SF-36 or death (70% 
vs 76% for TAGRISSO vs placebo), or in the mental component of the SF-36 or death (70% vs 71% for
TAGRISSO vs placebo). 
Previously untreated EGFR mutation-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC – FLAURA
The efficacy and safety of TAGRISSO for the treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive locally 
advanced, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy, or metastatic NSCLC, who had not received 
previous systemic treatment for advanced disease, was demonstrated in a randomised, double-blind, 
active-controlled study (FLAURA). Patient tumour tissue samples were required to have one of the two 
common EGFR mutations known to be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity (Ex19del or L858R), as 
identified by local or central testing. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either TAGRISSO (n=279, 80 mg orally once daily) or EGFR 
TKI comparator (n=277; gefitinib 250 mg orally once daily or erlotinib 150 mg orally once daily). 
Randomisation was stratified by EGFR mutation type (Ex19del or L858R) and ethnicity (Asian or 
non-Asian). Patients received study therapy until intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined 
that the patient was no longer experiencing clinical benefit. For patients receiving EGFR TKI comparator, 
post-progression crossover to open-label TAGRISSO was permitted provided tumour samples tested 
positive for the T790M mutation. The primary efficacy endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) as 
assessed by investigator.
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the overall study population were: median age 64 
years (range 26-93 years), ≥75 years old (14%), female (63%), White (36%), Asian (62%), never smokers 
(64%), World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1 (100%), metastatic bone disease 
(36%), extra-thoracic visceral metastases (35%), CNS metastases (21%, identified by CNS lesion site at 
baseline, medical history, and/or prior surgery, and/or prior radiotherapy to CNS metastases).
TAGRISSO demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS 
compared to EGFR TKI comparator (median 18.9 months and 10.2 months, respectively, HR=0.46, 95% 
CI: 0.37, 0.57; P<0.0001). Efficacy results from FLAURA by investigator assessment are summarised in 
Table 4, and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 5. The final analysis of overall survival 
(OS, 58% maturity) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement with an HR of 0.799 (95.05% CI: 
0.641, 0.997) and a clinically meaningful longer median survival time in patients randomised to 
TAGRISSO compared to EGFR TKI comparator (Table 4 and Figure 6). A greater proportion of patients 
treated with TAGRISSO were alive at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months (89%, 81%, 74% and 54% respectively) 
compared to patients treated with EGFR TKI comparator (83%, 71%, 59% and 44% respectively).
Analysis of post-progression end–points demonstrated that the PFS benefit was preserved through 
subsequent lines of therapy.

CNS metastases efficacy data in FLAURA study
Patients with CNS metastases not requiring steroids and with stable neurologic status for at least two 
weeks after completion of the definitive therapy and steroids were eligible to be randomised in the 
FLAURA study. Of 556 patients, 200 patients had available baseline brain scans. A BICR assessment of 
these scans resulted in a subgroup of 128/556 (23%) patients with CNS metastases and these data are
summarised in Table 5. CNS efficacy by RECIST v1.1 in FLAURA demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in CNS PFS (HR=0.48, 95% CI 0.26, 0.86; P=0.014).

A pre-specified PFS subgroup based on CNS metastases status (identified by CNS lesion site at baseline, 
medical history, and/or prior surgery, and/or prior radiotherapy to CNS metastases) at study entry was 
performed in FLAURA and is shown in Figure 7. Irrespective of CNS lesion status at study entry, patients 
in the TAGRISSO arm demonstrated an efficacy benefit over those in the EGFR TKI comparator arm and
there were fewer patients with new CNS lesions in the TAGRISSO arm compared to the EGFR TKI 
comparator arm (TAGRISSO, 11/279 [3.9%] compared to EGFR TKI comparator, 34/277 [12.3%]). In the 
subset of patients without CNS lesions at baseline, there were a lower number of new CNS lesions in the 
TAGRISSO arm compared to the EGFR TKI comparator arm (7/226 [3.1%] vs. 15/214 [7.0%],
respectively).

Patient reported outcomes
Patient-reported symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQL) were electronically collected using 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 and its lung cancer module (EORTC QLQ-LC13). The LC13 was initially 
administered once a week for the first 6 weeks, then every 3 weeks before and after progression. The C30 
was assessed every 6 weeks before and after progression. At baseline, no differences in patient reported 
symptoms, function or HRQL were observed between TAGRISSO and EGFR TKI comparator (gefitinib 
or erlotinib) arms. Compliance over the first 9 months was generally high (≥70%) and similar in both
arms.
Key lung cancer symptoms analysis
Data collected from baseline up to month 9 showed similar improvements in TAGRISSO and EGFR TKI 
comparator groups for the five pre-specified primary PRO symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, chest pain, 
fatigue, and appetite loss) with improvement in cough reaching the established clinically relevant cut-off. 
Up to month 9 there were no clinically meaningful differences in patient-reported symptoms between 
TAGRISSO and EGFR TKI comparator groups (as assessed by a difference of ≥10 points).
23
 
 
 
HRQL and physical functioning improvement analysis 
Both groups reported similar improvements in most functioning domains and global health status/HRQL, 
indicating that patients’ overall health status improved. Up to month 9, there were no clinically 
meaningful differences between the TAGRISSO and EGFR TKI comparator groups in functioning or 
HRQL. 
Pre-treated T790M-positive NSCLC patients-AURA3
The efficacy and safety of TAGRISSO for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
T790M NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy, was demonstrated in a 
randomised, open-label, active-controlled Phase 3 study (AURA3). All patients were required to have 
EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC identified by the cobas EGFR mutation test performed in a 
central laboratory prior to randomisation. The T790M mutation status was also assessed using ctDNA 
extracted from a plasma sample taken during screening. The primary efficacy outcome was progression-
free survival (PFS) as assessed by investigator. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR, 
DoR and overall survival (OS) as assessed by investigator.
Patients were randomised in a 2:1 (TAGRISSO: platinum-based doublet chemotherapy) ratio to receive 
TAGRISSO (n=279) or platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (n=140). Randomisation was stratified by 
ethnicity (Asian and non-Asian). Patients in the TAGRISSO arm received TAGRISSO 80 mg orally once 
daily until intolerance to therapy, or the investigator determined that the patient was no longer 
experiencing clinical benefit. Chemotherapy consisted of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with carboplatin AUC5 
or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. 
Patients whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy may receive 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle). Subjects on 
the chemotherapy arm who had objective radiological progression (by the investigator and confirmed by 
independent central imaging review) were given the opportunity to begin treatment with TAGRISSO.
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the overall study population were: median age 62, 
≥75 years old (15%), female (64%), white (32%), Asian (65%), never smoker (68%), WHO performance 
status 0 or 1 (100%). Fifty-four percent (54%) of patients had extra-thoracic visceral metastases, including 
34% with CNS metastases (identified by CNS lesion site at baseline, medical history, and/or prior surgery, 
and/or prior radiotherapy to CNS metastases) and 23% with liver metastases. Forty-two percent (42%) of 
patients had metastatic bone disease.
AURA3 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the patients treated with 
TAGRISSO compared to chemotherapy. Efficacy results from AURA3 by investigator assessment are 
summarised in Table 6, and the Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS is shown in Figure 8. No statistically 
significant difference was observed between the treatment arms at the final OS analysis.

2 ORR and DoR results by investigator assessment were consistent with those reported via Blinded Independent Central Review 
(BICR); ORR by BICR assessment was 64.9% [95% CI: 59.0, 70.5] on osimertinib and 34.3 % [95% CI: 25.6, 42.8] on 
chemotherapy; DoR by BICR assessment was 11.2 months (95% CI: 8.3, NC) on osimertinib and 3.1 months (95% CI: 2.9, 4.3) 
on chemotherapy.

Figure 8. Kaplan-Meier curves of progression-free survival as assessed by investigator in AURA3
A sensitivity analysis of PFS was conducted by a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and 
showed a median PFS of 11.0 months with TAGRISSO compared with 4.2 months with chemotherapy. 
This analysis demonstrated a consistent treatment effect (HR 0.28; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.38) with that observed 
by investigator assessment.
Clinically meaningful improvements in PFS with HRs less than 0.50 in favour of patients receiving 
TAGRISSO compared to those receiving chemotherapy were consistently observed in all predefined 
subgroups analysed, including ethnicity, age, gender, smoking history and EGFR mutation (Exon 19 
deletion and L858R).
CNS metastases efficacy data in AURA3 study
Patients with asymptomatic, stable brain metastases not requiring steroids for at least 4 weeks prior to the 
start of study treatment were eligible to be randomised in the study. A BICR assessment of CNS efficacy 
by RECIST v1.1 in the subgroup of 116/419 (28%) patients identified to have CNS metastases on a 
baseline brain scan are summarised in Table 7.

Patient reported outcomes
Patient-reported symptoms and HRQL were electronically collected using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and its
lung cancer module (EORTC QLQ-LC13). The LC13 was initially administered once a week for the first 
6 weeks, then every 3 weeks before and after progression. The C30 was assessed every 6 weeks before 
and after progression.
Key lung cancer symptoms analysis
TAGRISSO improved patient-reported lung cancer symptoms compared to chemotherapy by 
demonstrating a statistically significant difference in mean change from baseline versus chemotherapy 
during the overall time period from randomisation until 6 months for 5 pre-specified primary PRO 
symptoms (appetite loss, cough, chest pain, dyspnoea, and fatigue) as shown in Table 8.

HRQL and physical functioning improvement analysis
Patients on TAGRISSO had significantly greater chances of achieving a clinically meaningful 
improvement of greater than or equal to 10 points on the global health status and physical functioning of 
the EORTC-C30 questionnaire compared with chemotherapy during the study period Odds Ratio (OR) 
global health status: 2.11, (95% CI 1.24, 3.67, p=0.007); OR physical functioning 2.79 (95% CI 1.50, 
5.46, p=0.002).
Pre-treated T790M-positive NSCLC patients - AURAex and AURA2
Two single-arm, open-label clinical studies, AURAex (Phase 2 Extension cohort, (n=201)) and AURA2 
(n=210) were conducted in patients with EGFR T790M mutation-positive lung cancer who have 
progressed on one or more prior systemic therapies, including an EGFR TKI. All patients were required to 
have EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC identified by the cobas EGFR mutation test performed in a 
central laboratory prior to treatment. The T790M mutation status was also assessed retrospectively using 
ctDNA extracted from a plasma sample taken during screening. All patients received TAGRISSO at a 
dose of 80 mg once daily. The primary efficacy outcome measure of these two studies was ORR according 
to RECIST v1.1 as evaluated by a Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). Secondary efficacy 
outcome measures included Duration of Response (DoR) and Progression-Free Survival (PFS).
Baseline characteristics of the overall study population (AURAex and AURA2) were as follows: median 
age 63 years, 13% of patients were ≥75 years old, female (68%), White (36%), Asian (60%). All patients 
received at least one prior line of therapy. Thirty-one percent (31%) (N=129) had received 1 prior line of 
therapy (EGFR-TKI treatment only), 69% (N=282) had received 2 or more prior lines. Seventy-two 
percent (72%) of patients were never smokers, 100% of patients had a World Health Organization (WHO) 
performance status of 0 or 1. Fifty-nine percent (59%) of patients had extra-thoracic visceral metastasis 
including 39% with CNS metastases (identified by CNS lesion site at baseline, medical history, and/or 
prior surgery and/or prior radiotherapy to CNS metastases) and 29% with liver metastases. Forty-seven 
percent (47%) of patients had metastatic bone disease. The median duration of follow up for PFS was 
12.6 months.
In the 411 pre-treated EGFR T790M mutation-positive patients, the total ORR by Blinded Independent 
Central Review (BICR) was 66% (95% CI: 61, 71). In patients with a confirmed response by BICR, the 
median DoR was 12.5 months (95% CI: 11.1, NE). The ORR by BICR in AURAex was 62% (95% CI: 55, 
68) and 70% (95% CI: 63, 77) in AURA2. The median PFS was 11.0 months 95% CI (9.6, 12.4).
Objective response rates by BICR above 50% were observed in all predefined subgroups analysed, 
including line of therapy, ethnicity, age and region.
In the evaluable for response population, 85% (223/262) had documentation of response at the time of the 
first scan (6 weeks); 94% (247/262) had documentation of response at the time of the second scan 
(12 weeks).
CNS metastases efficacy data in Phase 2 studies (AURAex and AURA2)
A BICR assessment of CNS efficacy by RECIST v 1.1 was performed in a subgroup of 50 (out of 411) 
patients identified to have measurable CNS metastases on a baseline brain scan. A CNS ORR of 54% 
(27/50 patients; 95% CI: 39.3, 68.2) was observed with 12% of these responses being complete responses.
Clinical studies have not been conducted in patients with de novo EGFR T790M mutation-positive 
NSCLC.

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
TAGRISSO in all subsets of the paediatric population in NSCLC (see section 4.2 for information on 
paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Osimertinib pharmacokinetic parameters have been characterised in healthy subjects and NSCLC patients. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, osimertinib apparent plasma clearance is 14.3 L/h, 
apparent volume of distribution is 918 L and terminal half-life of approximately 44 hours. The AUC and 
Cmax increased dose proportionally over 20 to 240 mg dose range. Administration of osimertinib once 
daily results in approximately 3-fold accumulation with steady-state exposures achieved by 15 days of 
dosing. At steady-state, circulating plasma concentrations are typically maintained within a 1.6 fold range 
over the 24-hour dosing interval.
Absorption
Following oral administration of TAGRISSO, peak plasma concentrations of osimertinib were achieved 
with a median (min-max) tmax of 6 (3-24) hours, with several peaks observed over the first 24 hours in 
some patients. The absolute bioavailability of TAGRISSO is 70% (90% CI 67, 73). Based on a clinical 
pharmacokinetic study in patients at 80 mg, food does not alter osimertinib bioavailability to a clinically 
meaningful extent. (AUC increase by 6% (90% CI -5, 19) and Cmax decrease by 7% (90% CI -19, 6)). In 
healthy volunteers administered an 80 mg tablet where gastric pH was elevated by dosing of omeprazole 
for 5 days, osimertinib exposure was not affected (AUC and Cmax increase by 7% and 2%, respectively) 
with the 90% CI for exposure ratio contained within the 80-125% limit.
Distribution
Population estimated mean volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss/F) of osimertinib is 918 L indicating 
extensive distribution into tissue. In vitro plasma protein binding of osimertinib is 94.7% (5.3% free). 
Osimertinib has also been demonstrated to bind covalently to rat and human plasma proteins, human 
serum albumin and rat and human hepatocytes.
Biotransformation
In vitro studies indicate that osimertinib is metabolised predominantly by CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. 
However, with current available data, alternative metabolic pathways cannot be fully ruled out. Based on 
in vitro studies, 2 pharmacologically active metabolites (AZ7550 and AZ5104) have subsequently been 
identified in the plasma of preclinical species and in humans after oral dosing with osimertinib; AZ7550 
showed a similar pharmacological profile to TAGRISSO while AZ5104 showed greater potency across 
both mutant and wild-type EGFR. Both metabolites appeared slowly in plasma after administration of 
TAGRISSO to patients, with a median (min-max) tmax of 24 (4-72) and 24 (6-72) hours, respectively. In 
human plasma, parent osimertinib accounted for 0.8%, with the 2 metabolites contributing 0.08% and 
0.07% of the total radioactivity with the majority of the radioactivity being covalently bound to plasma 
proteins. The geometric mean exposure of both AZ5104 and AZ7550, based on AUC, was approximately 
10% each of the exposure of osimertinib at steady-state. 
The main metabolic pathway of osimertinib was oxidation and dealkylation. At least 12 components were 
observed in the pooled urine and faecal samples in humans with 5 components accounting for >1% of the 
dose of which unchanged osimertinib, AZ5104 and AZ7550, accounted for approximately 1.9, 6.6 and 
2.7% of the dose while a cysteinyl adduct (M21) and an unknown metabolite (M25) accounted for 1.5% 
and 1.9% of the dose, respectively.
30
Based on in vitro studies, osimertinib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP 3A4/5 but not CYP1A2, 2A6, 
2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 at clinically relevant concentrations. Based on in vitro studies, 
osimertinib is not an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and UGT2B7 at clinically relevant concentrations hepatically. 
Intestinal inhibition of UGT1A1 is possible but the clinical impact is unknown.
Elimination
Following a single oral dose of 20 mg, 67.8% of the dose was recovered in faeces (1.2% as parent) while 
14.2% of the administered dose (0.8% as parent) was found in urine by 84 days of sample collection. 
Unchanged osimertinib accounted for approximately 2% of the elimination with 0.8% in urine and 1.2% 
in faeces.
Interactions with transport proteins
In vitro studies have shown that osimertinib is not a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. In vitro, 
osimertinib does not inhibit OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MATE1, OCT2 and MATE2K at 
clinically relevant concentrations. 
Based on in vitro studies osimertinib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP but at clinical doses, clinically 
relevant interactions are unlikely. Based on in vitro data, osimertinib is an inhibitor of BCRP and P-gp
(see section 4.5).
Special populations
In a population based pharmacokinetic analyses (n=1367), no clinically significant relationships were 
identified between predicted steady-state exposure (AUCss) and patient’s age (range: 25 to 91 years), 
gender (65% female), ethnicity (including White, Asian, Japanese, Chinese and non-Asian-non-White 
patients), line of therapy and smoking status (n=34 current smokers, n=419 former smokers). Population 
PK analysis indicated that body weight was a significant covariate with a less than 20% change in 
osimertinib AUCss expected across a body weight range of 88 kg to 43 kg respectively (95% to 5% 
quantiles) when compared to the AUCss for the median body weight of 61 kg. Taking the extremes of 
body weight into consideration, from <43 kg to >88 kg, AZ5104 metabolite ratios ranged from 11.8% to 
9.6% while for AZ7550 it ranged from 12.8% to 8.1%, respectively. Based on population PK analysis, 
serum albumin was identified as a significant covariate with a <30% change in osimertinib AUCss
expected across the albumin range of 29 to 46 g/L respectively (95% to 5% quantiles) when compared to 
the AUCss for the median baseline albumin of 39 g/L. These exposure changes due to body weight or 
baseline albumin differences are not considered clinically relevant. 
Hepatic impairment
Osimertinib is eliminated mainly via the liver. In a clinical study, patients with different types of advanced 
solid tumours and with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A, mean score =5.3, n=7) or moderate 
hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B, mean score =8.2, n=5) had no increase in exposure compared to 
patients with normal hepatic function (n=10) after a single 80 mg dose of TAGRISSO. The geometric 
mean ratio (90% CI) of osimertinib AUC and Cmax was 63.3% (47.3, 84.5) and 51.4% (36.6, 72.3) in
patients with mild hepatic impairment and 68.4% (49.6, 94.2) and 60.7% (41.6, 88.6) in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment; for the metabolite AZ5104 the AUC and Cmax were 66.5% (43.4, 101.9) and 
66.3% (45.3, 96.9) in patients with mild hepatic impairment and 50.9% (31.7, 81.6) and 44.0% (28.9, 
67.1) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, compared to the exposure in patients with normal 
hepatic function. Based on population PK analysis, there was no relationship between markers of hepatic 
function (ALT, AST, bilirubin) and osimertinib exposure. The hepatic impairment marker serum albumin 
showed an effect on the PK of osimertinib. Clinical studies that were conducted excluded patients with 
AST or ALT >2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN), or if due to underlying malignancy, >5.0x ULN or with 
total bilirubin >1.5x ULN. Based on a pharmacokinetic analysis of 134 patients with mild hepatic 
impairment, 8 patients with moderate hepatic impairment and 1216 patients with normal hepatic function 
31
osimertinib exposures were similar. There are no data available on patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.2).
Renal impairment
In a clinical study, patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to less than 30 mL/min; n=7) compared 
to patients with normal renal function (CLcr greater than or equal to 90 mL/min; n=8) after a single 80 mg 
oral dose of TAGRISSO showed a 1.85-fold increase in AUC (90% CI; 0.94, 3.64) and a 1.19-fold 
increase in Cmax (90% CI: 0.69, 2.07). Furthermore, based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
593 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to less than 90 mL/min), 254 patients with moderate 
renal impairment (CLcr 30 to less than 60 mL/min), 5 patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 
less than 30 mL/min) and 502 patients with normal renal function (greater than or equal to 90 mL/min), 
osimertinib exposures were similar. Patients with CLcr less than or equal to 10 mL/min were not included 
in the clinical studies.
Patients with brain metastases
PET images following administration of microdoses of [11C]osimertinib in EGFR mutation-positive 
NSCLC patients with brain metastases (n=4) and healthy volunteers (n=7) demonstrated that the brain to 
plasma ratio (Kp) was similar and that [11C]osimertinib crossed the blood brain barrier rapidly and was 
homogeneously distributed across all regions of the brain in both patients and healthy volunteers.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
The main findings observed in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs comprised atrophic, 
inflammatory and/or degenerative changes affecting the epithelia of the cornea (accompanied by corneal 
translucencies and opacities in dogs at ophthalmology examination), GI tract (including tongue), skin, and 
male and female reproductive tracts with secondary changes in spleen. These findings occurred at plasma 
concentrations that were below those seen in patients at the 80 mg therapeutic dose. The findings present 
following 1 month of dosing were largely reversible within 1 month of cessation of dosing with the 
exception of partial recovery for some of the corneal changes.
Lens fibre degeneration was found in the 104-week carcinogenicity rat study at exposures 0.2-times the 
human AUC, at the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg once a day. Lens opacities were first noted from 
week 52 of this study and showed a gradual increase in incidence and severity with increased duration of 
dosing. The clinical relevance of this finding cannot be ruled out.
Osimertinib penetrated the intact blood-brain barrier of the cynomolgus monkey (intravenous dosing), rat 
and mouse (oral administration). 
Non-clinical data indicate that osimertinib and its metabolite (AZ5104) inhibit the h-ERG channel, and 
QTc prolonging effect cannot be excluded.
Osimertinib did not cause genetic damage in in vitro and in vivo assays. Osimertinib showed no 
carcinogenic potential when administered orally to Tg rasH2 transgenic mice for 26 weeks. 
An increased incidence of proliferative vascular lesions (angiomatous hyperplasia and haemangioma) in 
the mesenteric lymph node was observed in the rat 104-week carcinogenicity study at exposures 0.2 times 
the AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 80 mg once daily, and is unlikely to be relevant for humans.
Reproductive toxicity
Degenerative changes were present in the testes in rats and dogs exposed to osimertinib for ≥1 month and 
there was a reduction in male fertility in rats following exposure to osimertinib for 3 months. These 
findings were seen at clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Pathology findings in the testes seen 
32
following 1 month dosing were reversible in rats; however, a definitive statement on reversibility of these 
lesions in dogs cannot be made.
Based on studies in animals, female fertility may be impaired by treatment with osimertinib. In repeat dose 
toxicity studies, an increased incidence of anoestrus, corpora lutea degeneration in the ovaries and 
epithelial thinning in the uterus and vagina were seen in rats exposed to osimertinib for ≥1 month at 
clinically relevant plasma concentrations. Findings in the ovaries seen following 1 month dosing were 
reversible. In a female fertility study in rats, administration of osimertinib at 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 
equal to the recommended daily clinical dose of 80 mg) had no effects on oestrus cycling or the number of 
females becoming pregnant, but caused early embryonic deaths. These findings showed evidence of 
reversibility following a 1 month off-dose.
In a modified embryofoetal development study in the rat, osimertinib caused embryolethality when 
administered to pregnant rats prior to embryonic implantation. These effects were seen at a maternally 
tolerated dose of 20 mg/kg where exposure was equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended 
dose of 80 mg daily (based on total AUC). Exposure at doses of 20 mg/kg and above during 
organogenesis caused reduced foetal weights but no adverse effects on external or visceral foetal 
morphology. When osimertinib was administered to pregnant female rats throughout gestation and then 
through early lactation, there was demonstrable exposure to osimertinib and its metabolites in suckling 
pups plus a reduction in pup survival and poor pup growth (at doses of 20 mg/kg and above).

6. Contents of the pack and other information
1. What TAGRISSO is and what it is used for
TAGRISSO contains the active substance osimertinib, which belongs to a group of medicines called
protein kinase inhibitors which are used to treat cancer. TAGRISSO is used to treat adults with a type of
lung cancer called ‘non-small cell lung cancer.’ If a test has shown that your cancer has certain changes 
(mutations) in a gene called ‘EGFR’ (epidermal growth factor receptor) your cancer is likely to respond to 
treatment with TAGRISSO. TAGRISSO can be prescribed for you:



after complete removal of your cancer as a post-surgical (adjuvant) treatment 
or 
as the first medicine you receive for your cancer which has spread to other parts of the body
or
in certain circumstances if you have been treated for your cancer before with other protein kinase 
inhibitor medicines.
How TAGRISSO works
TAGRISSO works by blocking EGFR and may help to slow or stop your lung cancer from growing. It 
may also help to reduce the size of the tumour and prevent the tumour from coming back after removal by 
surgery.



If you are receiving TAGRISSO after complete removal of your cancer, it means that your cancer 
contained defects in the EGFR gene, ‘exon 19 deletion’ or ‘exon 21 substitution mutation’.
If TAGRISSO is the first protein kinase inhibitor medicine you are receiving, it means that your 
cancer contains defects in the EGFR gene, for example ‘exon 19 deletion’ or ‘exon 21 substitution 
mutation’.  
If your cancer has progressed while you were being treated with other protein kinase inhibitor 
medicines, it means that your cancer contains a gene defect called ‘T790M’. Because of this defect, 
other protein kinase medicines may no longer work.
46
If you have any questions about how this medicine works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, ask your doctor.

3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Solution for injection 
Clear to opalescent, colourless to brownish-yellow solution, with a pH of 5.5 and an osmolality of 
270-370 mOsm/kg. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Vabysmo is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with: 
• 
• 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
This medicinal product must be administered by a qualified physician experienced in intravitreal 
injections. Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. 
Posology 
Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD)  
The recommended dose is 6 mg (0.05 mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 
weeks (monthly) for the first 4 doses. 
Thereafter, an assessment of disease activity based on anatomic and/or visual outcomes is 
recommended 20 and/or 24 weeks after treatment initiation so that treatment can be individualised. In 
patients without disease activity, administration of faricimab every 16 weeks (4 months) should be 
considered. In patients with disease activity, treatment every 8 weeks (2 months) or 12 weeks (3 
months) should be considered. If anatomic and/or visual outcomes change, the treatment interval 
should be adjusted accordingly, and interval reduction should be implemented if anatomic and/or 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visual outcomes deteriorate (see section 5.1). There is limited safety data on treatment intervals of 8 
weeks or less between injections (see section 4.4). Monitoring between the dosing visits should be 
scheduled based on the patient's status and at the physician's discretion, but there is no requirement for 
monthly monitoring between injections. 
Visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) 
The recommended dose is 6 mg (0.05 mL solution) administered by intravitreal injection every 4 
weeks (monthly) for the first 4 doses.  
Thereafter, treatment is individualised using a treat-and-extend approach. Based on the physician's 
judgement of the patient’s anatomic and/or visual outcomes, the dosing interval may be extended up to 
every 16 weeks (4 months), in increments of up to 4 weeks. If anatomic and/or visual outcomes 
change, the treatment interval should be adjusted accordingly, and interval reduction should be 
implemented if anatomic and/or visual outcomes deteriorate (see section 5.1). Treatment intervals 
shorter than 4 weeks between injections have not been studied. Monitoring between the dosing visits 
should be scheduled based on the patient's status and at the physician's discretion, but there is no 
requirement for monthly monitoring between injections. 
Duration of treatment 
This medicinal product is intended for long-term treatment. If visual and/or anatomic outcomes 
indicate that the patient is not benefitting from continued treatment, treatment should be discontinued. 
Delayed or missed dose 
If a dose is delayed or missed, the patient should return to be assessed by physician at the next 
available visit and continue dosing depending on physician’s discretion. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years or above (see section 5.2). Safety data in 
nAMD patients ≥ 85 years is limited (see section 4.4). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of this medicinal product in the paediatric population for the indications of 
nAMD and DME. 
Method of administration  
For intravitreal use only. 
Vabysmo should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, 
and if present, the vial should not be used. 
The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the 
use of surgical hand disinfection, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or equivalent). The 
patient’s medical history for hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to 
performing the intravitreal procedure (see section 4.8). Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface should be administered 
prior to the injection. 
The injection needle should be inserted 3.5 to 4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, 
avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of 
0.05 mL is then delivered slowly; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections. 
After injection, any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance 
with local requirements.  
Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in 
intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve 
head or tonometry. If required, sterile equipment for paracentesis should be available. 
Following intravitreal injection patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of 
endophthalmitis (e.g. vision loss, eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without 
delay. 
For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Active or suspected ocular or periocular infections.  
Active intraocular inflammation. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. 
Intravitreal injection-related reactions 
Intravitreal injections, including those with faricimab, have been associated with endophthalmitis, 
intraocular inflammation, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, retinal tear and iatrogenic traumatic 
cataract (see section 4.8). Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering 
Vabysmo. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms, such as pain, loss of vision, 
photophobia, blurred vision, floaters, or redness, suggestive of endophthalmitis or any of the above-
mentioned adverse reactions without delay, to permit prompt and appropriate management. Patients 
with increased frequency of injections may be at increased risk of procedural complications. 
Intraocular pressure increases 
Transient increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal 
injection, including those with faricimab (see section 4.8). Special precaution is needed in patients 
with poorly controlled glaucoma (do not inject Vabysmo while the IOP is ≥ 30 mmHg). In all cases, 
both the IOP and perfusion of the optic nerve head must be monitored and managed appropriately. 
Systemic effects 
Systemic adverse events including arterial thromboembolic events have been reported following 
intravitreal injection of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors and there is a theoretical 
risk that these may be related to VEGF inhibition. A low incidence rate of arterial thromboembolic 
4 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
events was observed in the faricimab clinical trials in patients with nAMD and DME. There are 
limited data on the safety of faricimab treatment in DME patients with high blood pressure 
(≥  140/90  mmHg) and vascular disease, and in nAMD patients ≥ 85 years of age. 
Immunogenicity 
As this is a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity with faricimab (see section 
4.8). Patients should be instructed to inform their physician of any signs or symptoms of intraocular 
inflammation such as vision loss, eye pain, increased sensitivity to light, floaters or worsening eye 
redness, which might be a clinical sign attributable to hypersensitivity against faricimab (see section 
4.8). 
Bilateral treatment 
The safety and efficacy of faricimab administered in both eyes concurrently have not been studied. 
Bilateral treatment could cause bilateral ocular adverse reactions and/or potentially lead to an increase 
in systemic exposure, which could increase the risk of systemic adverse reactions. Until data for 
bilateral use become available, this is a theoretical risk for faricimab. 
Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF 
There are no data available on the concomitant use of faricimab with anti-VEGF medicinal products in 
the same eye. Faricimab should not be administered concurrently with other anti-VEGF medicinal 
products (systemic or ocular). 
Withholding treatment 
Treatment should be withheld in patients with: 
• 
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, stage 3 or 4 macular holes, retinal break; treatment should 
not be resumed until an adequate repair has been performed. 
Treatment related decrease in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of ≥ 30 letters compared 
with the last assessment of visual acuity; treatment should not be resumed earlier than the next 
scheduled treatment. 
An intraocular pressure of ≥ 30 mmHg. 
A subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea, or, if the size of the haemorrhage is 
≥ 50%, of the total lesion area. 
Performed or planned intraocular surgery within the previous or next 28 days; treatment should 
not be resumed earlier than the next scheduled treatment. 
•

• 
Retinal pigment epithelial tear 
Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear is a complication of pigment epithelial detachment (PED) in 
patients with nAMD. Risk factors associated with the development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear 
after anti-VEGF therapy for nAMD, include a large and/or high pigment epithelial detachment. When 
initiating faricimab therapy, caution should be used in patients with these risk factors for retinal 
pigment epithelial tears. RPE tears are common in nAMD patients with PED, treated with IVT anti-
VEGF agents including faricimab. There was a higher rate of RPE tear in the faricimab group (2.9%) 
compared to aflibercept group (1.5%). The majority of events occurred during the loading phase, and 
were mild to moderate, without impact on vision. 
Populations with limited data 
There is only limited experience in the treatment of nAMD patients ≥ 85 years, and DME patients with 
type I diabetes, patients with HbA1c over 10%, patients with high-risk proliferative diabetic 
retinopathy (DR), high blood pressure (≥ 140/90 mmHg) and vascular disease, sustained dosing 
intervals shorter than every 8 weeks (Q8W), or nAMD and DME patients with active systemic 
infections. There is limited safety information on sustained dosing intervals of 8 weeks or less and 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these may be associated with a higher risk of ocular and systemic adverse reactions, including serious 
adverse reactions. There is also no experience of treatment with faricimab in diabetic patients with 
uncontrolled hypertension. This lack of information should be considered by the physician when 
treating such patients. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. Based on the biotransformation and elimination of 
faricimab (see section 5.2), no interactions are expected. However, faricimab should not be 
administered concurrently with other systemic or ocular anti-VEGF medicinal products (see section 
4.4).  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 3 
months following the last intravitreal injection of faricimab.  
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of faricimab in pregnant women. The systemic 
exposure to faricimab is low after ocular administration, but due to its mechanism of action (i.e. VEGF 
inhibition), faricimab must be regarded as potentially teratogenic and embryo-/foetotoxic (see section 
5.3). 
Faricimab should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential 
risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether faricimab is excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed newborn/infant 
cannot be excluded. Vabysmo should not be used during breast-feeding. A decision must be made 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from faricimab therapy taking into 
account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No effects on reproductive organs or fertility were observed in a 6-month cynomolgus monkey study 
with faricimab (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Vabysmo has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Temporary visual 
disturbances may occur following the intravitreal injection and the associated eye examination. 
Patients should not drive or use machines until visual function has recovered sufficiently.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Product-class-related adverse reactions 
There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and myocardial 
infarction, following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. A low incidence rate of arterial 
thromboembolic events was observed in the faricimab clinical trials in patients with nAMD and DME 
(see section 4.4). Across indications, no notable difference between the groups treated with faricimab 
and the comparator were observed. 
Immunogenicity 
There is a potential for an immune response in patients treated with faricimab (see section 4.4). After 
dosing with faricimab for up to 112 (nAMD) and 100 (DME) weeks, treatment-emergent anti-
faricimab antibodies were detected in approximately 13.8% and 9.6% of patients with nAMD and 
DME respectively. The clinical significance of anti-faricimab antibodies on safety is unclear at this 
time. The incidence of intraocular inflammation in anti-faricimab antibody positive patients was 12/98  
(12.2%; nAMD) and 15/128 (11.7%; DME), and in anti-faricimab antibody negative patients was 
8/562 (1.4%; nAMD) and 5/1124 (0.4%; DME). The incidence of serious ocular adverse reactions in 
anti-faricimab antibody positive patients was 6/98 (6.1%; nAMD ) and 14/128 (10.9%; DME) and in 
anti-faricimab antibody negative patients was 23/562 (4.1%; nAMD)  and 45/1124 (4.0%; DME). 
Anti-faricimab antibodies were not associated with an impact on clinical efficacy or systemic 
pharmacokinetics. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdosing with greater than recommended injection volume may increase intraocular pressure. In the 
event of overdose, IOP should be monitored and, if deemed necessary by the treating physician, 
appropriate treatment should be initiated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antineovascularisation agents, ATC code: S01LA09 
Mechanism of action 
Faricimab is a humanised bispecific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody that acts through inhibition 
of two distinct pathways by neutralisation of both angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial 
growth factor A (VEGF-A). 
Ang-2 causes vascular instability by promoting endothelial destabilisation, pericyte loss, and 
pathological angiogenesis, thus potentiating vascular leakage and inflammation. It also sensitises 
blood vessels to the activity of VEGF-A resulting in further vascular destabilisation. Ang-2 and 
VEGF-A synergistically increase vascular permeability and stimulate neovascularisation.  
By dual inhibition of Ang-2 and VEGF-A, faricimab reduces vascular permeability and inflammation, 
inhibits pathological angiogenesis and restores vascular stability.

Pharmacodynamic effects 
A suppression from baseline of median ocular free Ang-2 and free VEGF-A concentrations was 
observed from day 7 onwards in the four Phase III studies described hereafter.  
nAMD 
In TENAYA and LUCERNE, objective, pre-specified visual and anatomic criteria, as well as treating 
physician clinical assessment, were used to guide treatment decisions at the disease activity 
assessment time points (week 20 and week 24). 
The mean central subfield thickness (CST) reduction from baseline at the primary endpoint visits 
(averaged at weeks 40-48) was comparable to those observed with aflibercept, with -137 µm and 
- 137  µm in patients treated with  faricimab dosed up to every 16 weeks (Q16W) as compared to 
- 129  µm and -131 µm with aflibercept, in TENAYA and LUCERNE, respectively. These mean CST 
reductions were maintained through year 2. 
At week 48, in both studies there was a comparable effect of faricimab and aflibercept on the 
reduction of intraretinal fluid (IRF), subretinal fluid (SRF), and pigment epithelial detachment (PED). 
These effects in IRF, SRF, and PED were maintained at year 2. There were also comparable changes 
in total CNV lesion area and reductions in CNV leakage area from baseline for patients in the 
faricimab and aflibercept treatment arms. 
DME 
In YOSEMITE and RHINE, anatomic parameters related to macular oedema were part of the disease 
activity assessments guiding treatment decisions. 
The mean CST reduction from baseline at the primary endpoint visits (averaged at weeks 48-56) was 
numerically greater than those observed with aflibercept, with -207 µm and -197 µm in patients 
treated with faricimab Q8W and faricimab up to Q16W adjustable dosing as compared to -170 µm in 
aflibercept Q8W patients in YOSEMITE; results were 196 µm, 188 µm and 170 µm, respectively in 
RHINE. Consistent reductions in CST were observed through Year 2. Greater proportions of patients 
in both faricimab arms achieved absence of IRF and absence of DME (defined as reaching CST below 
325 µm) over time through year 2 as compared to aflibercept in both studies. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
nAMD 
The safety and efficacy of faricimab were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, 
active comparator-controlled, 2-year non-inferiority studies in patients with nAMD, TENAYA and 
LUCERNE. A total of 1,329 patients were enrolled, with 1,135 (85%) patients completing the studies 
through week 112. A total of 1,326 patients received at least one dose (664 with faricimab). Patient 
ages ranged from 50 to 99 years with a mean [standard deviation; SD] of 75.9 [8.6] years. 
In both studies, patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: 
• 
• 
Faricimab 6 mg up to Q16W after four initial monthly doses 
Aflibercept 2 mg Q8W after three initial monthly doses 
After the first four monthly doses (weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12) patients randomised to the faricimab arm 
received Q16W, every 12 weeks (Q12W) or Q8W dosing based on an assessment of disease activity at 
weeks 20 and 24. Disease activity was assessed using objective pre-specified visual (BCVA) and 
anatomic (CST) criteria, as well as treating physician clinical assessment of the presence of macular 
haemorrhage or nAMD disease activity requiring treatment (week 24 only). Patients remained on these 
fixed dosing intervals until week 60 without supplemental therapy. From week 60 onwards, patients in 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the faricimab arm moved to an adjustable dosing regimen, where their treatment interval could be 
modified by up to 4 week interval extensions (up to Q16W) or reduced by up to 8 week intervals (up 
to Q8W) based on an automated objective assessment of pre-specified visual (BCVA) and anatomic 
(CST and macular haemorrhage) disease activity criteria. Patients in the aflibercept arm remained on 
Q8W dosing throughout the study period. Both studies were 112 weeks in duration. 
Results 
Both studies showed efficacy in the primary endpoint, defined as the mean change from baseline in 
BCVA when averaged over the week 40, 44, and 48 visits and measured by the Early Treatment 
Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter score (Table 2 and Table 3.). In both studies, faricimab up 
to Q16W treated patients had a non-inferior mean change from baseline in BCVA, as the patients 
treated with aflibercept Q8W at year 1, and these vision gains were maintained through week 112. 
Improvements from baseline BCVA at week 112 are shown in Figure 1.  
The proportion of patients on each of the different treatment intervals at week 112 in TENAYA and 
LUCERNE, respectively was: 
• 
• 
• 
Q16W: 59% and 67% 
Q12W: 15% and 14% 
Q8W: 26% and 19%

Figure 1: Mean change in visual acuity from baseline to year 2 (week 112); combined data from  
TENAYA and LUCERNE studies  
In both TENAYA and LUCERNE, improvements from baseline in BCVA and CST at week 60 were 
comparable across the two treatment arms and consistent with those seen at week 48. 
At week 60, 46% of patients in both TENAYA and LUCERNE were on a Q16W interval. Of these, 
69% of patients in both studies maintained Q16W through week 112 without interval reduction. 
At week 60, 80% and 78% of patients in TENAYA and LUCERNE, respectively, were on a ≥ Q12W 
interval (Q16W or Q12W). Of these, 67% and 75% of patients, respectively, maintained a ≥ Q12W 
interval through week 112 without an interval reduction below Q12W.  
At week 60, 33% of patients in both TENAYA and LUCERNE were on a Q12W interval. Of these, 
3.2% and 0% of patients in TENAYA and LUCERNE, respectively, maintained Q12W through week 
112. 
At week 60, 20% and 22% of patients in TENAYA and LUCERNE, respectively, were on a Q8W 
interval. Of these, 34% and 30% of patients in TENAYA and LUCERNE, respectively, maintained 
Q8W therapy through week 112. 
Efficacy results in all evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, race, baseline visual acuity, lesion type, 
lesion size) in each study, and in the pooled analysis, were consistent with the results in the overall 
populations. 
Across studies, faricimab up to Q16W showed improvement in pre-specified efficacy endpoint of 
mean change from baseline to week 48 in the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 
(NEI VFQ-25) composite score that was comparable to aflibercept Q8W, and exceeded the threshold 
of 4 points. The magnitude of these changes corresponds to a 15-letter gain in BCVA.  
The incidence of ocular adverse events in the study eye was 53.9% and 52.1% and non-ocular adverse 
events was 73.3% and 74.3%, through week 112 in the faricimab and aflibercept arms, respectively 
(see section 4.4 and 4.8).

DME 
The safety and efficacy of faricimab were assessed in two randomised, multi-centre, double-masked, 
active comparator-controlled 2-year non-inferiority studies (YOSEMITE and RHINE) in patients with 
DME. A total of 1,891 patients were enrolled in the two studies with 1,622 (86%) patients completing 
the studies through week 100. A total of 1,887 patients were treated with at least one dose through 
week 56 (1,262 with faricimab). Patient ages ranged from 24 to 91 with a mean [SD] of 62.2 [9.9] 
years. The overall population included both anti-VEGF naive patients (78%) and patients who had 
been previously treated with a VEGF inhibitor prior to study participation (22%). In both studies, 
patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment regimens:  
• 
• 
• 
Faricimab 6 mg Q8W after the first 6 monthly doses. 
Faricimab 6 mg up to Q16W adjustable dosing administered in 4, 8, 12 or 16-week intervals 
after the first 4 monthly doses. 
Aflibercept 2 mg Q8W after the first 5 monthly doses. 
In the Q16W adjustable dosing arm, the dosing followed a standardised treat-and-extend approach. 
The interval could be increased in 4-week increments or decreased in 4- or 8-week increments based 
on anatomic and/or visual outcomes, using data obtained only at study drug dosing visits.  
Results 
Both studies showed efficacy in the primary endpoint, defined as the mean change from baseline in 
BCVA at year 1 (average of the week 48, 52, and 56 visits), measured by the ETDRS Letter Score. In 
both studies, faricimab up to Q16W treated patients had a non-inferior mean change from baseline in 
BCVA, as the patients treated with aflibercept Q8W at year 1, and these vision gains were maintained 
through year 2.  
After 4 initial monthly doses, the patients in the faricimab up to Q16W adjustable dosing arm could 
have received between the minimum of 6 and the maximum of 21 total injections through week 96. At 
week 52, 74% and 71% of patients in the faricimab up to Q16W adjustable dosing arm achieved a 
Q16W or Q12W dosing interval in YOSEMITE and RHINE, respectively (53% and 51% on Q16W, 
21% and 20% on Q12W). Of these patients, 75% and 84% maintained ≥ Q12W dosing without an 
interval reduction below Q12W through week 96; of the patients on Q16W at week 52, 70% and 82% 
of patients maintained Q16W dosing without an interval reduction through week 96 in YOSEMITE 
and RHINE, respectively. At week 96, 78% of patients in the faricimab up to Q16W adjustable dosing 
arm achieved a Q16W or Q12W dosing interval in both studies (60% and 64% on Q16W, 18% and 
14% on Q12W). 4% and 6% of patients were extended to Q8W and stayed on ≤ Q8W dosing intervals 
through week 96; 3% and 5% received only Q4W dosing in YOSEMITE and RHINE through week 
96, respectively. 
Detailed results from the analyses of YOSEMITE and RHINE studies are listed in Table 4, Table 5, 
and Figure 2 below.

Figure 2: Mean change in visual acuity from baseline to year 2 (week 100); combined data from 
YOSEMITE and RHINE studies 
Efficacy results in patients who were anti-VEGF treatment naive prior to study participation and in all 
the other evaluable subgroups (e.g. by age, gender, race, baseline HbA1c, baseline visual acuity) in 
each study were consistent with the results in the overall populations. 
Across studies, faricimab Q8W and up to Q16W adjustable dosing showed improvements in the pre-
specified efficacy endpoint of mean change from baseline to week 52 in the NEI VFQ-25 composite 
score that was comparable to aflibercept Q8W and exceeded the threshold of 4 points. Faricimab Q8W 
and up to Q16W adjustable dosing also demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in the pre-
specified efficacy endpoint of change from baseline to week 52 in the NEI VFQ-25 near activities, 
distance activities, and driving scores, that were comparable to aflibercept Q8W. The magnitude of 
these changes corresponds to a 15-letter gain in BCVA. Comparable proportions of patients treated 
with faricimab Q8W, faricimab up to Q16W adjustable dosing, and aflibercept Q8W experienced a 
clinically meaningful improvement of  ≥ 4-points from baseline to week 52 in the NEI VFQ-25 
composite score, a pre-specified efficacy endpoint. These results were maintained at week 100. 
An additional key efficacy outcome in DME studies was the change in the Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale (ETDRS-DRSS) from baseline to week 52. Of 
the 1,891 patients enrolled in Studies YOSEMITE and RHINE, 708 and 720 patients were evaluable 
for DR endpoints, respectively. 
The ETDRS-DRSS scores ranged from 10 to 71 at baseline. 
The majority of patients, approximately 60%, had moderate to severe non-proliferative DR (DRSS 
43/47/53) at baseline. 
The proportion of patients who achieved ≥ 2-step and ≥ 3-step improvement from baseline in ETDRS-
DRSS at week 52 and at week 96 are shown in Table 6 and Table 7 below.

Treatment effects in evaluable subgroups (e.g. by previous anti-VEGF treatment, age, gender, race, 
baseline HbA1c, and baseline visual acuity) in each study were generally consistent with the results in 
the overall population. 
Treatment effects in subgroups by DR severity at baseline were different and showed the greatest ≥ 2-
step DRSS improvements among patients with moderately severe and severe non-proliferative DR 
with approximately 90% of patients achieving improvements consistently across all treatment arms in 
both studies.  
The incidence of ocular adverse events in the study eye was 49.7%, 49.2% and 45.4% and non-ocular 
adverse events was 73.0%, 74.2%, and 75.7% through week 100, in the faricimab Q8W, faricimab up 
to Q16W, and aflibercept Q8W arms, respectively (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
faricimab in all subsets of the paediatric population in nAMD and DME (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Faricimab is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye. 
Absorption and distribution 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis (including nAMD and DME N = 2,246), maximum 
free (unbound to VEGF-A and Ang-2) faricimab plasma concentrations (Cmax) are estimated to occur 
approximately 2 days post-dose. Mean (±SD [standard deviation]) plasma Cmax are estimated 0.23 
(0.07) µg/mL and 0.22 (0.07) µg/mL respectively in nAMD and in DME patients. After repeated 
administrations, mean plasma free faricimab trough concentrations are predicted to be 0.002-
0.003 µg/mL for Q8W dosing. 
Faricimab exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics (based on Cmax and AUC) over the dose 
range 0.5 mg-6 mg. No accumulation of faricimab was apparent in the vitreous or in plasma following 
monthly dosing. 
Maximum plasma free faricimab concentrations are predicted to be approximately 600 and 6000-fold 
lower than in aqueous and vitreous humour respectively. Therefore, systemic pharmacodynamic 
effects are unlikely, further supported by the absence of significant changes in free VEGF and Ang-2 
concentration in plasma upon faricimab treatment in clinical studies. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis has shown an effect of age and body weight on ocular or 
systemic pharmacokinetics of faricimab respectively. Both effects were considered not clinically 
meaningful; no dose adjustment is needed. 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Faricimab is a protein-based therapeutic hence its metabolism and elimination have not been fully 
characterised. Faricimab is expected to be catabolised in lysosomes to small peptides and amino acids, 
which may be excreted renally, in a similar manner to the elimination of endogenous IgG. 
The faricimab plasma concentration-time profile declined in parallel with the vitreous and aqueous 
concentration-time profiles. The estimated mean ocular half-life and apparent systemic half-life of 
faricimab is 7.5 days. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
In the four Phase III clinical studies, approximately 60% (1,149/1,929) of patients randomised to 
treatment with faricimab were ≥ 65 years of age. Population pharmacokinetic analysis has shown an 
effect of age on ocular pharmacokinetics of faricimab. The effect was considered not clinically 
meaningful. No dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years and above (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
No specific studies in patients with renal impairment have been conducted with faricimab. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of patients in all clinical studies of which 64% had renal impairment (mild 
38%, moderate 24%, and severe 2%), revealed no differences with respect to systemic 
pharmacokinetics of faricimab after intravitreal administration of faricimab. No dose adjustment is 
required in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No specific studies in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted with faricimab. However, 
no special considerations are needed in this population because metabolism occurs via proteolysis and 
does not depend on hepatic function. No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic 
impairment (see section 4.2). 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other special populations 
The systemic pharmacokinetics of faricimab are not influenced by race. Gender was not shown to have 
a clinically relevant influence on systemic pharmacokinetics of faricimab. No dose adjustment is 
needed. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No studies have been conducted on the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of faricimab. 
In pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, intravenous injections of faricimab resulting in serum exposure 
(Cmax) more than 500-times the maximum human exposure did not elicit developmental toxicity or 
teratogenicity, and had no effect on weight or structure of the placenta, although, based on its 
pharmacological effect faricimab should be regarded as potentially teratogenic and embryo-
/foetotoxic.

Vabysmo 120 mg/mL solution for injection 
faricimab 
This medicine is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. You can help by reporting any side effects you may get. See the end of section 4 
for how to report side effects. 
Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start using this medicine because it contains 
important information for you. 
• 
• 
• 
Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor.  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed 
in this leaflet. See section 4. 
What is in this leaflet 
1.  What Vabysmo is and what it is used for  
2.  What you need to know before you receive Vabysmo  
3.  How to use Vabysmo 
4.  Possible side effects  
5.  How to store Vabysmo  
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Vabysmo is and what it is used for 
What Vabysmo is and what it is used for  
Vabysmo contains the active substance faricimab, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents.  
Vabysmo is injected into the eye by your doctor to treat eye disorders in adults called:  
• 
• 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME). 
These disorders affect the macula, the central part of the retina (the light-sensitive layer at the back of 
the eye) that is responsible for fine, central vision. nAMD is caused by the growth of abnormal blood 
vessels which leak blood and fluid into the macula, and DME is caused by leaky blood vessels that 
cause swelling of the macula. 
How Vabysmo works 
Vabysmo specifically recognises and blocks the activity of proteins known as angiopoietin-2 and 
vascular endothelial growth factor A. When these proteins are present at higher levels than normal, 
they can cause growth of abnormal blood vessels and/or damage to normal vessels, with leakage into 
the macula, causing swelling or damage that can negatively affect a person’s vision. By attaching to 
these proteins, Vabysmo can block their actions and prevent abnormal vessel growth, leakage and 
swelling. Vabysmo may improve the disease and/or slow down worsening of the disease and thereby 
maintain, or even improve, your vision. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you receiveVabysmo 
You should not receive Vabysmo: 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to faricimab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have an active or suspected infection in or around the eye. 
if you have pain or redness in your eye (eye inflammation). 
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor. You should not be given Vabysmo. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before receiving Vabysmo: 
• 
• 
if you have glaucoma (an eye condition usually caused by high pressure in the eye). 
if you have a history of seeing flashes of light or floaters (dark floating spots) and if you have a 
sudden increase in the size and number of floaters. 
if you have had eye surgery in the last four weeks or if eye surgery is planned in the next four 
weeks. 
if you have ever had any eye diseases or eye treatments. 
• 
• 
Tell your doctor immediately if you: 
• 
• 
develop sudden vision loss. 
develop signs of a possible eye infection or inflammation, such as increased redness of the eye, 
eye pain, increased eye discomfort, blurred or decreased vision, an increased number of small 
particles in your vision, increased sensitivity to light. 
Furthermore it is important for you to know that: 
• 
• 
• 
the safety and efficacy of Vabysmo when administered to both eyes at the same time has not 
been studied and use in this way may lead to an increased risk of side effects. 
injections with Vabysmo may cause a temporary increase in eye pressure (intraocular pressure) 
in some patients within 60 minutes of the injection. Your doctor will monitor this after each 
injection. 
your doctor will check whether you have other risk factors that may increase the chance of a 
tear or detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear, and 
retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), in which case Vabysmo must be given with 
caution. 
When some medicines that work in a similar way to Vabysmo are given, there is known to be a risk of 
blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events), which may lead to heart attack or 
stroke. As small amounts of the medicine enter the blood, there is a theoretical risk of such events 
following injection of Vabysmo into the eye. 
There is only limited experience in the treatment of:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
patients with active infections. 
patients with nAMD 85 years or older. 
patients with DME due to type I diabetes. 
diabetics with high average blood sugar values (Hb1Ac over 10%). 
diabetics with an eye disease caused by diabetes called proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
diabetics with high blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg and disease of the blood vessels. 
patients with DME receiving injections less than every 8 weeks over a long period of time. 
There is only limited experience in the treatment of patients receiving injections less than every 8 
weeks over a long period of time, and these patients may be at greater risk of side effects. 
There is no experience in the treatment of: 
• 
diabetics with uncontrolled high blood pressure. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If any of the above applies to you, your doctor will consider this lack of information when treating you 
with Vabysmo. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Vabysmo in children and adolescents has not been studied because nAMD and DME occur 
mainly in adults.  
Other medicines and Vabysmo 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Vabysmo has not been studied in pregnant women. Vabysmo should not be used during pregnancy 
unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risk to the unborn child.  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before this medicine is given to you. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Vabysmo because it is not known whether 
Vabysmo passes into human milk. 
Women who could become pregnant must use an effective method of birth control during treatment 
and for at least three months after stopping treatment with Vabysmo. If you become pregnant or think 
you are pregnant during treatment, tell your doctor right away.  
Driving and using machines 
After your injection with Vabysmo, you may have temporary vision problems (for example blurred 
vision). Do not drive or use machines as long as these last. 
Vabysmo contains sodium  
The medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. 
3.  How to use Vabysmo 
How Vabysmo is given 
The recommended dose is 6 mg of faricimab. 
Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (nAMD)  
• 
• 
You will be treated with one injection every month for the first 4 months.  
After that, you may receive injections up to every 4 months. Your doctor will decide on the 
frequency of the injections based on the condition of your eye. 
Visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME)  
• 
• 
You will be treated with one injection every month for the first 4 months.  
After that, you may receive injections up to every 4 months. Your doctor will decide on the 
frequency of the injections based on the condition of your eye. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Method of administration 
Vabysmo is injected into your eye (intravitreal injection) by a doctor experienced in giving eye 
injections.  
Before the injection your doctor will use a disinfectant eyewash to clean your eye carefully to prevent 
infection. Your doctor will give you an eye drop (local anaesthetic) to numb the eye to reduce or 
prevent pain from the injection.  
How long does Vabysmo treatment last for 
This is a long-term treatment, possibly continuing for months or years. Your doctor will regularly 
monitor your condition to check that the treatment is working. Depending on how you respond to the 
treatment with Vabysmo, your doctor may ask you to change to a more or less frequent dose. 
If you miss a dose of Vabysmo 
If you miss a dose, schedule a new appointment with your doctor as soon as possible. 
If you stop using Vabysmo  
Speak with your doctor before stopping treatment. Stopping treatment may increase your risk of vision 
loss and your vision may worsen. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
4.  Possible side effects

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Before you start: 
• 
• 
Read all the instructions carefully before using Vabysmo. 
The Vabysmo kit includes a glass vial and transfer filter needle. The glass vial is for a single 
dose only. The filter needle is for single use only. 
•  Vabysmo should be stored refrigerated at temperatures between 2ºC to 8ºC. 
Do not freeze. 
Do not shake. 
•  Allow Vabysmo to reach room temperature, 20°C to 25°C before proceeding with the 
administration. Keep the vial in the original carton to protect from light. 
• 
• 
The Vabysmo vial may be kept at room temperature for up to 24 hours. 
The Vabysmo vial should be inspected visually prior to administration. Vabysmo is a clear to 
opalescent and colorless to brownish-yellow liquid solution. 
Do not use if particulates, cloudiness, or discoloration are visible.  
Do not use if the packaging, vial and/or transfer filter needle are expired, damaged, or have 
been tampered with (see Figure A). 
•  Use aseptic technique to carry out the preparation of the intravitreal injection. 
Figure A 
Instructions for use of vial: 
1.   Gather the following supplies: 
•  One Vabysmo vial (included) 
•  One sterile 5-micron blunt transfer filter needle 18-gauge x 1½ inch, 1.2 mm x 
40 mm (included) 
•  One sterile 1 mL Luer lock syringe with a 0.05 mL dose mark (not included) 
•  One sterile injection needle 30-gauge x ½ inch (not included) 
Note that a 30-gauge injection needle is recommended to avoid increased injection 
forces that could be experienced with smaller diameter needles. 
•  Alcohol swab (not included).

2.   To ensure all liquid settles at the bottom of the vial, place the vial upright on a flat 
surface (for about 1 minute) after removal from packaging (see Figure B). Gently tap the 
vial with your finger (see Figure C), as liquid may stick to the top of the vial.  
  Figure B                                                 
Figure C 
3.   Remove the flip-off cap from the vial (see Figure D) and wipe the vial septum with an 
alcohol swab (see Figure E).

Figure E 
4.   Aseptically and firmly attach the included 18-gauge x 1½ inch transfer filter needle onto 
a 1 mL Luer lock syringe (see Figure F). 
5.   Using aseptic technique, push the transfer filter needle into the center of the vial septum 
(see Figure G), push it all the way in, then tilt the vial slightly so that the needle touches 
the bottom edge of the vial (see Figure H).

6.   Hold the vial slightly inclined and slowly withdraw all the liquid from the vial (see 
Figure I). Keep the bevel of the transfer filter needle submerged in the liquid, to avoid 
introduction of air. 
Figure I 
7.   Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial, in order to 
completely empty the transfer filter needle (see Figure I). 
8.   Disconnect the transfer filter needle from the syringe and dispose of it in accordance with 
local regulations.  
Do not use the transfer filter needle for the intravitreal injection. 
9.   Aseptically and firmly attach a 30-gauge x ½ inch injection needle onto the Luer lock 
syringe (see Figure J). 
Figure J 
10.  Carefully remove the plastic needle shield from the needle by pulling it straight off. 
11.  To check for air bubbles, hold the syringe with the needle pointing up. If there are any air 
bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top (see 
Figure K).

12.  Carefully expel the air from the syringe and needle, and slowly depress the plunger to 
align the rubber stopper tip to the 0.05 mL dose mark. The syringe is ready for the 
injection (see Figure L). Ensure that the injection is given immediately after preparation 
of the dose. 
Figure L 
13.   Inject slowly until the rubber stopper reaches the end of the syringe to deliver the volume 
of 0.05 mL. Confirm delivery of the full dose by checking that the rubber stopper has 
reached the end of the syringe barrel.  
Excess volume should be expelled prior to injection. The injection dose must be set 
to the 0.05 ml dose mark to avoid overdose. 
Any waste material or unused medicinal product should be disposed of in accordance 
with local regulations.

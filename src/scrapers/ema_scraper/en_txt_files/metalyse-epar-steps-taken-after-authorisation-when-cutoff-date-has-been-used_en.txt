PROCEDURAL STEPS TAKEN AFTER GRANTING THE MARKETING 
AUTHORISATION 
For procedures finalised after 1 February 2004 please refer to module 8B. 
• 
The MAH submitted an Urgent Safety Restriction on 14 November 2001 to introduce changes 
in the instructions for use and handling in the SPC and in the instructions for use detailed in the 
pictogram on the inner lid of the folding box, following a number of reports suggesting that the 
instructions for use  of the product  may not  have  been  followed  appropriately. In addition,  the 
MAH informed treating physicians by means of a Dear Heath Care Professional letter and the 
EMEA  published  a  Public  Statement.  The  EPAR  was  updated  shortly  afterwards  as  a 
consequence of the changes to the MA. These changes are reflected in the SPC and labelling.  
Subsequent post Marketing Authorisation applications agreed upon are summarised in the table below:

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) 
AYVAKYT is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or 
metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) harbouring the platelet-derived growth factor 
receptor alpha (PDGFRA) D842V mutation. 
Advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM) 
AYVAKYT is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with aggressive systemic 
mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN) 
or mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one systemic therapy. 
Indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) 
AYVAKYT is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) 
with moderate to severe symptoms inadequately controlled on symptomatic treatment (see 
section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a healthcare professional experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of 
conditions for which avapritinib is indicated (see section 4.1). 
Posology 
Unresectable or metastatic GIST 
For GIST, the recommended starting dose of avapritinib is 300 mg orally once daily, on an empty 
stomach (see Method of administration). Treatment should be continued until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Patient selection for treatment of unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V 
mutation should be based on a validated test method. 
Concomitant use of avapritinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If 
concomitant use with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, the starting dose of avapritinib 
must be reduced from 300 mg to 100 mg orally once daily (see section 4.5).  
Advanced systemic mastocytosis 
For AdvSM, the recommended starting dose of avapritinib is 200 mg orally once daily, on an empty 
stomach (see Method of administration). This once daily 200 mg dose is also the maximum 
recommended dose that must not be exceeded by patients with AdvSM. Treatment should be 
continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

Treatment with avapritinib is not recommended in patients with platelet count < 50 x 109/L (see 
Table 2 and section 4.4). 
Concomitant use of avapritinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided. If 
concomitant use with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, the starting dose of avapritinib 
must be reduced from 200 mg to 50 mg orally once daily (see section 4.5). 
Indolent systemic mastocytosis 
For ISM, the recommended dose of avapritinib is 25 mg orally once daily, on an empty stomach (see 
Method of administration). This once daily 25 mg dose is also the maximum recommended dose that 
must not be exceeded in patients with ISM. Treatment of ISM should be continued until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Concomitant use of avapritinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors must be avoided (see 
section 4.5). 
Dose modifications for adverse reactions 
Irrespective of indication, interruption of treatment with or without dose reduction may be considered 
to manage adverse reactions based on severity and clinical presentation.  
The dose should be adjusted as recommended, based on safety and tolerability.  
Dose reductions and modifications for adverse reactions are recommended in patients with GIST, 
AdvSM or ISM and are provided in Tables 1 and 2.

Missed doses 
If a dose of avapritinib is missed, the patient should make up for the missed dose unless the next 
scheduled dose is within 8 hours (see Method of administration). If the dose has not been taken at least 
8 hours prior to the next dose, then that dose must be omitted and the patient should resume treatment 
with the next scheduled dose. 
If vomiting occurs after taking a dose of avapritinib, the patient must not take an additional dose but 
continue with the next scheduled dose.  
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients aged 65 years and above (see section 5.2). Clinical 
data in ISM patients aged 75 years and above is limited (see section 5.1). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin within 
upper limit of normal [ULN] and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > ULN or total bilirubin greater 
than 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) and moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to 
3.0 times ULN and any AST). A modified starting dose of avapritinib is recommended for patients 
with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). The starting dose of avapritinib should be 
reduced from 300 mg to 200 mg orally once daily for patients with GIST, from 200 mg to 100 mg 
orally once daily for patients with AdvSM, and from 25 mg orally once daily to 25 mg orally every 
other day for patients with ISM (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment  
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance [CLcr] 30-89 mL/min estimated by Cockcroft-Gault). Avapritinib has not been studied in 
patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (CLcr 
<15 mL/min), therefore its use in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease 
cannot be recommended (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of AYVAKYT in children aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration  
AYVAKYT is for oral use. 
The tablets must be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after a meal 
(see section 5.2). 
Patients must swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Haemorrhages 
Avapritinib has been associated with an increased incidence of haemorrhagic adverse reactions, 
including serious and severe adverse reactions, like gastrointestinal haemorrhage and intracranial 
haemorrhage, in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST and AdvSM. Gastrointestinal 
haemorrhagic adverse reactions were the most commonly reported haemorrhagic adverse reactions 
during avapritinib treatment of unresectable or metastatic GIST patients, while hepatic and tumour 
haemorrhage also occurred in GIST patients (see section 4.8).  
Routine surveillance of haemorrhagic adverse reactions in patients with GIST or AdvSM must include 
physical examination. Complete blood counts, including platelets, and coagulation parameters must be 
monitored in patients with GIST or AdvSM, particularly in patients with conditions predisposing to 
bleeding, and in those treated with anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin and phenprocoumon) or other 
concomitant medicinal products that increase the risk of bleeding.  
Intracranial haemorrhages 
Adverse reactions of intracranial haemorrhage occurred in GIST and AdvSM patients who received 
avapritinib.  
Before initiating avapritinib at any dose the risk for intracranial haemorrhage should be carefully 
considered in patients with potential increased risk including those with a history of vascular 
aneurysm, intracranial haemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident within the prior year, concomitant use 
of anticoagulants or thrombocytopenia.  
Patients who experience clinically relevant neurological signs and symptoms (e.g. severe headache, 
vision problems, somnolence, and/or focal weakness) during treatment with avapritinib must interrupt 
dosing of avapritinib and inform their healthcare professional immediately. Brain imaging by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) may be performed at the discretion 
of the physician based on severity and the clinical presentation.  
For patients with observed intracranial haemorrhage during treatment with avapritinib in any 
indication, regardless of severity grade, avapritinib must be permanently discontinued (see 
section 4.2). 
Unresectable or metastatic GIST 
Serious adverse reactions of intracranial haemorrhage were reported in patients with unresectable or 
metastatic GIST receiving avapritinib (see section 4.8). The exact mechanism is unknown.  
There is no clinical study experience using avapritinib in patients with brain metastases. 
Advanced systemic mastocytosis 
Serious adverse reactions of intracranial haemorrhage were reported in patients with AdvSM receiving 
avapritinib (see section 4.8). The exact mechanism is unknown. The incidence of intracranial 
haemorrhage was higher in patients with platelet counts <50 x 109/L and in patients with a starting 
dose of ≥300 mg. 
Considering the above, a platelet count must be performed prior to initiating therapy. Avapritinib is 
not recommended in patients with platelet counts <50 x 109/L. Following treatment initiation, platelet 
counts must be performed every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks regardless of baseline platelet count. 
After 8 weeks of treatment, monitor platelet counts every 2 weeks (or more frequently as clinically 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indicated) if values are less than 75 x 109/L, every 4 weeks if values are between 75 and 100 x 109/L, 
and as clinically indicated if values are greater than 100 x 109/L. 
Manage platelet counts of <50 x 109/L by temporarily interrupting avapritinib. Platelet support may be 
necessary, and the recommended dose modification in Table 2 must be followed (see section 4.2). 
Thrombocytopenia was generally reversible by reducing or interrupting avapritinib in clinical studies. 
The maximum dose for patients with AdvSM must not exceed 200 mg once daily. 
Cognitive effects 
Cognitive effects, such as memory impairment, cognitive disorder, confusional state, and 
encephalopathy, can occur in patients receiving avapritinib (see section 4.8). The mechanism of the 
cognitive effects is not known. 
It is recommended that patients with GIST or AdvSM are clinically monitored for signs and symptoms 
of cognitive events such as new or increased forgetfulness, confusion, and/or difficulty with cognitive 
functioning. Patients with GIST or AdvSM must notify their healthcare professional immediately if 
they experience new or worsening cognitive symptoms.  
For GIST or AdvSM patients with observed cognitive effects related to treatment with avapritinib, the 
recommended dose modification in Table 2 must be followed (see section 4.2). In clinical studies 
conducted in patients with GIST and AdvSM, dose reductions or interruptions improved Grade ≥2 
cognitive effects compared to no action. 
In patients with ISM, cognitive effects can be one of the disease symptoms. Patients with ISM must 
notify their healthcare professional if they experience new or worsening cognitive symptoms. 
Fluid retention 
Occurrences of fluid retention, including severe cases of localised oedema (facial, periorbital, 
peripheral oedema and/or pleural effusion) or generalised oedemas, have been reported with a 
frequency category of at least common in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST taking 
avapritinib. Other localised oedemas (laryngeal oedema and/or pericardial effusion) have been 
reported uncommonly (see section 4.8).  
In patients with AdvSM, localised (facial, periorbital, peripheral, pulmonary oedema, pericardial 
and/or pleural effusion) or generalised oedema, and ascites have been observed with a frequency 
category of at least common (see section 4.8). Other localised oedemas (laryngeal oedema) have been 
reported uncommonly. 
Therefore, it is recommended that patients with GIST or AdvSM be evaluated for these adverse 
reactions including regular assessment of weight and respiratory symptoms. An unexpected rapid 
weight gain or respiratory symptoms indicating fluid retention must be carefully investigated and 
appropriate supportive care and therapeutic measures, such as diuretics, should be undertaken. For 
GIST or AdvSM patients presenting with ascites, it is recommended to evaluate the aetiology of 
ascites. 
In patients with ISM, localised (peripheral, facial) oedemas have been reported with a frequency 
category of at least common (see section 4.8). 
QT interval prolongation 
Prolongation of QT interval has been observed in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST and 
AdvSM treated with avapritinib in clinical studies (see section 4.8 and 5.1). QT interval prolongation 
may induce an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsade de pointes. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Avapritinib should be used with caution in GIST or AdvSM patients with known QT interval 
prolongation or at risk of QT interval prolongation (e.g. due to concomitant medicinal products, pre-
existing cardiac disease and/or electrolyte disturbances). Concomitant administration with strong or 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided due to the increased risk of adverse reactions, 
including QT prolongation and related arrhythmias (see section 4.5). If concomitant use of moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors cannot be avoided, see section 4.2 for dose modification instructions. 
In patients with GIST or AdvSM, interval assessments of QT by electrocardiogram (ECG) should be 
considered if avapritinib is taken concurrently with medicinal products that can prolong QT interval. 
In patients with ISM, QT interval assessments by ECG should be considered, in particular in patients 
with concurrent factors that could prolong QT (e.g. age, pre-existing heart rhythm disorders, etc.). 
Gastrointestinal disorders  
Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were the most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST and AdvSM (see section 4.8). GIST or AdvSM 
patients who present with diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting should be evaluated to exclude disease-
related aetiologies. Supportive care for gastrointestinal adverse reactions requiring treatment may 
include medicinal products with antiemetic, antidiarrheal, or antacid properties.  
The hydration status of GIST or AdvSM patients experiencing gastrointestinal adverse reactions must 
be closely monitored and treated as per standard clinical practice. 
Laboratory tests 
Treatment with avapritinib in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST and AdvSM is associated 
with anaemia, neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Complete blood counts must be performed on a 
regular basis during the treatment with avapritinib in patients with GIST or AdvSM. See also 
intracranial haemorrhages above in this section and in section 4.8. 
Treatment with avapritinib is associated in patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST and AdvSM 
with elevations in bilirubin and liver transaminases (see section 4.8). Liver function (transaminases 
and bilirubin) should be monitored regularly in patients with GIST or AdvSM receiving avapritinib. 
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers 
Co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided because it may 
increase the plasma concentration of avapritinib (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).  
Co-administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers should be avoided because it may 
decrease the plasma concentrations of avapritinib (see section 4.5). 
Photosensitivity reaction 
Exposure to direct sunlight must be avoided or minimised due to the risk of phototoxicity associated 
with avapritinib. Patients must be instructed to use measures such as protective clothing and sunscreen 
with high sun protection factor (SPF). 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Active substances that may have an effect on avapritinib 
Strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
Co-administration of avapritinib with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased avapritinib plasma 
concentrations and may result in increased adverse reactions. Co-administration of itraconazole 
(200 mg twice daily on Day 1 followed by 200 mg once daily for 13 days) with a single 200 mg dose 
of avapritinib on Day 4 in healthy subjects increased avapritinib Cmax by 1.4-fold and AUC0-inf by 
4.2-fold, relative to a 200 mg dose of avapritinib administered alone.  
Concomitant use of avapritinib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (such as antifungals 
including ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole; certain macrolides such as 
erythromycin, clarithromycin and telithromycin; active substances to treat human immunodeficiency 
virus infections/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) such as cobicistat, indinavir, 
lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir and saquinavir; as well as conivaptan for hyponatremia and boceprevir 
to treat hepatitis) including grapefruit or grapefruit juice should be avoided. If concomitant use with a 
moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, the starting dose of avapritinib should be reduced from 
300 mg to 100 mg orally once daily for patients with GIST, and from 200 mg to 50 mg orally once 
daily for patients with AdvSM. For patients with ISM, concomitant use of avapritinib with strong or 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors must be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Strong and moderate CYP3A inducers 
Co-administration of avapritinib with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased avapritinib plasma 
concentrations and may result in decreased efficacy of avapritinib. Co-administration of rifampicin 
(600 mg once daily for 18 days) with a single 400 mg dose of avapritinib on Day 9 in healthy subjects 
decreased avapritinib Cmax by 74% and AUC0-inf by 92%, relative to a 400 mg dose of avapritinib 
administered alone.  
Co-administration of avapritinib with strong and moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. dexamethasone, 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, fosphenytoin, primidone, bosentan, efavirenz, 
etravirine, modafinil, dabrafenib, nafcillin or Hypericum perforatum, also known as St. John’s wort) 
should be avoided. 
Effect of avapritinib on other active substances  
In vitro studies demonstrated that avapritinib is a direct inhibitor of CYP3A and a time-dependent 
inhibitor of CYP3A. Therefore, avapritinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations 
of co-administered medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A. 
In vitro studies indicated that avapritinib is an inducer of CYP3A. Therefore, avapritinib may have the 
potential to decrease plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are substrates 
of CYP3A. 
Caution must be exercised with co-administration of avapritinib with narrow therapeutic index 
CYP3A substrates as their plasma concentrations may be altered.  
Avapritinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MATE2-K, and BSEP in vitro. Therefore, 
avapritinib has the potential to alter concentrations of co-administered substrates of these transporters. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential must be informed that avapritinib may cause foetal harm (see 
section 5.3).  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pregnancy status of women of reproductive potential must be verified prior to initiating 
AYVAKYT treatment. 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 weeks 
after the last dose of AYVAKYT. Males with female partners of childbearing potential must use 
effective contraception during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of AYVAKYT. 
Patients must be advised to contact their healthcare professional immediately if they become pregnant, 
or if pregnancy is suspected, while taking AYVAKYT. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of avapritinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
AYVAKYT is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.  
If AYVAKYT is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking AYVAKYT, 
the patient must be advised of the potential risk to the foetus.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether avapritinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding must be discontinued during treatment with AYVAKYT and for 2 weeks following the 
final dose.  
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of AYVAKYT on human fertility. However, based on nonclinical 
findings in animals, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with avapritinib (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
AYVAKYT may cause adverse reactions such as cognitive effects that may influence the ability to 
drive and use machines. 
Patients should be made aware of the potential for adverse reactions that affect their ability to 
concentrate and react. Patients who experience these adverse effects must take special care when 
driving a car or operating machinery. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety database includes a total of 585 patients with GIST (all doses), of which 550 patients 
received avapritinib at a starting dose of 300 mg or 400 mg; 193 patients enrolled in studies for 
AdvSM (all doses), of which 126 patients received avapritinib at a starting dose of 200 mg, and 
246 patients with ISM (doses 25 mg – 100 mg), of which 141 patients received avapritinib at the 
recommended dose of 25 mg in Part 2, pivotal part of the PIONEER study (see section 5.1).

Unresectable or metastatic GIST 
The most common adverse reactions of any grade during treatment with avapritinib at a starting dose 
of 300 mg or 400 mg were nausea (45%), fatigue (40%), anaemia (39%), periorbital oedema (33%), 
face oedema (27%), hyperbilirubinaemia (28%), diarrhoea (26%), vomiting (24%), oedema peripheral 
(23%), lacrimation increased (22%), decreased appetite (21%) and memory impairment (20%).  
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 23% of patients receiving avapritinib. The most common serious 
adverse reactions during treatment with avapritinib were anaemia (6%), and pleural effusion (1%).  
The most common adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were fatigue, 
encephalopathy and intracranial haemorrhage (< 1% each). Adverse reactions leading to a dose 
reduction included anaemia, fatigue, neutrophil count decreased, blood bilirubin increased, memory 
impairment, cognitive disorder, periorbital oedema, nausea and face oedema.  
Advanced systemic mastocytosis 
The most common adverse reactions of any grade during treatment with avapritinib at a starting dose 
of 200 mg were periorbital oedema (38%), thrombocytopenia (37%), oedema peripheral (33%), and 
anaemia (22%).   
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 12% of patients receiving avapritinib. The most common serious 
adverse reactions during treatment with avapritinib were subdural haematoma (2%), anaemia (2%), 
and haemorrhage (2%).  
In AdvSM patients treated at 200 mg, 7.1% had adverse reactions leading to permanent treatment 
discontinuation. In two patients (1.6%), subdural haematoma occurred. Cognitive disorder, depressed 
mood, diarrhoea, disturbance in attention, haemoglobin decreased, hair colour changes, libido 
decreased, nausea, neutropenia, premature menopause and thrombocytopenia occurred in one patient 
(0.8% each). Adverse reactions leading to a dose reduction included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, 
periorbital oedema, cognitive disorder, oedema peripheral, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count 
decreased, anaemia, asthenia, fatigue, arthralgia, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood bilirubin 
increased, and white blood cell count decreased. 
Indolent systemic mastocytosis 
In Part 2 of PIONEER, the most common adverse reaction during treatment with avapritinib at the 
recommended dose of 25 mg was peripheral oedema (12%). Overall, the majority of oedema adverse 
reactions reported were Grade 1 (94% for peripheral oedema, 90% for face oedema); none were 
Grade ≥3 or led to treatment discontinuation.  
No serious adverse reactions or fatal adverse reactions occurred in 141 patients receiving avapritinib at 
the recommended dose of 25 mg in Part 2 of PIONEER. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse 
reactions occurred in <1% of patients receiving avapritinib. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions that were reported in clinical studies in ≥1% of patients with GIST are listed below 
(Table 3) except for adverse reactions mentioned in the section 4.4 which are included regardless of 
frequency, according to the MedDRA System Organ Class and frequency. For patients with AdvSM, 
adverse reactions that were reported in clinical studies in ≥3% of patients are listed below (Table 4). 
For patients with ISM, adverse reactions reported in Part 2 of the PIONEER study in ≥5% of patients 
are listed in Table 5. 
Frequencies are defined using the following convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to 
<1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Intracranial haemorrhage 
Unresectable or metastatic GIST 
Intracranial haemorrhage occurred in 10 (1.7%) of the 585 patients with GIST (all doses) and in 
9 (1.6%) of the 550 patients with GIST who received avapritinib at a starting dose of 300 mg or 
400 mg once daily (see section 4.4).  
Events of intracranial haemorrhage (all grades) occurred in a range from 8 weeks to 84 weeks after 
initiating avapritinib, with a median time to onset of 22 weeks. The median time to improvement and 
resolution was 25 weeks for intracranial haemorrhage of Grade ≥2. 
Advanced systemic mastocytosis 
Intracranial haemorrhage occurred in a total (regardless of causality) of 4 (3.2%) of the 126 patients 
with AdvSM who received avapritinib at a starting dose of 200 mg once daily regardless of platelet 
count prior to initiation of therapy. In 3 of these 4 patients, the event was assessed as related to 
avapritinib (2.4%). The risk of intracranial haemorrhagic events is higher in patients with platelet 
counts <50 x 109/L. Intracranial haemorrhage occurred in a total (regardless of causality) of 3 (2.5%) 
of the 121 patients with AdvSM who received a starting dose of 200 mg once daily and had a platelet 
count ≥50 x 109/L prior to initiation of therapy (see section 4.4). In 2 of the 3 patients, the event was 
assessed as related to avapritinib (1.7 %). Of 126 patients treated with the recommended starting dose 
of 200 mg once daily, 5 had platelet counts <50 x 109/L prior to initiation of therapy, of which one 
patient experienced an intracranial haemorrhage. 
Events of intracranial haemorrhage (all grades) occurred in a range from 12.0 weeks to 15.0 weeks 
after initiating avapritinib, with a median time to onset of 12.1 weeks. 
In clinical studies with avapritinib, the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage was higher in patients 
who received a starting dose of ≥300 mg once daily, as compared to patients who received the 
recommended starting dose of 200 mg once daily. Of the 50 patients who received a starting dose of 
≥300 mg once daily, 8 (16.0%) experienced an event (regardless of causality) of intracranial bleeding 
regardless of platelet count prior to initiation of therapy. In 6 of the 8 patients, the event was assessed 
as related to avapritinib (12.0 %). Of these 50 patients, 7 had platelet counts <50 x 109/L prior to 
initiation of therapy, of which 4 patients experienced an intracranial haemorrhage, that were assessed 
as related to avapritinib in 3 of 4 cases. Four of 43 patients with platelet counts ≥50 x 109/L prior to 
initiation of therapy experienced an intracranial haemorrhage, which were assessed as related to 
avapritinib in 3 of 4 cases. 
Fatal events of intracranial haemorrhage have occurred in less than 1% of patients with AdvSM (all 
doses).  
The maximum dose for patients with AdvSM must not exceed 200 mg once daily. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Indolent systemic mastocytosis 
No intracranial haemorrhages were reported in 141 patients with ISM receiving 25 mg of avapritinib 
during the 24-week duration of Part 2 of the PIONEER study. 
Cognitive effects 
A broad spectrum of cognitive effects that are generally reversible (with intervention) can occur in 
patients receiving avapritinib. Cognitive effects were managed with dose interruption and/or reduction, 
and 2.7% led to permanent discontinuation of avapritinib treatment in patients with GIST and AdvSM. 
Unresectable or metastatic GIST 
Cognitive effects occurred in 194 (33%) of the 585 patients with GIST (all doses) and in 182 (33%) of 
the 550 patients with GIST who received avapritinib at starting doses of either 300 or 400 mg once 
daily (see section 4.4). In the patients who had an event (any grade), the median time to onset was 
8 weeks.  
Most cognitive effects were Grade 1, with Grade ≥2 occurring in 11% of 550 patients. Among patients 
who experienced a cognitive effect of Grade ≥2 (impacting activities of daily living) the median time 
to improvement was 15 weeks.  
Memory impairment occurred in 20% of patients, <1% of these events were Grade 3. Cognitive 
disorder occurred in 12% of patients; <1% of these events were Grade 3. Confusional state occurred in 
5% of patients; <1% of these events were Grade 3. Encephalopathy occurred in <1% of patients; <1% 
of these events were Grade 3. Serious adverse reactions of cognitive effects were reported for 9 of 585 
(1.5%) of the GIST patients (all doses), of which 7 of the 550 (1.3%) patients were observed in the 
GIST group receiving a starting dose of either 300 or 400 mg once daily.  
Overall, 1.3% of patients required permanent discontinuation of avapritinib for a cognitive effect. 
Cognitive effects occurred in 37% of the patients aged ≥65 years receiving a starting dose of either 
300 or 400 mg once daily.  
Advanced systemic mastocytosis  
Cognitive effects occurred in 51 (26%) of the 193 patients with AdvSM (all doses) and in 23 (18%) of 
the 126 patients with AdvSM who received avapritinib at a starting dose of 200 mg (see section 4.4). 
In the patients with AdvSM treated at a starting dose of 200 mg who had an event (any grade), the 
median time to onset was 12 weeks (range: 0.1 weeks to 108.1 weeks). 
Most cognitive effects were Grade 1, with Grade ≥2 occurring in 7% of 126 patients treated at a 
starting dose of 200 mg. Among patients who experienced a cognitive effect of Grade ≥2 (impacting 
activities of daily living) the median time to improvement was 6 weeks. 
For patients with AdvSM treated at a starting dose of 200 mg, cognitive disorder occurred in 12% of 
patients, memory impairment occurred in 6% of patients and confusional state occurred in 2% of 
patients. None of these events were Grade 4. 
Serious adverse reactions of cognitive effects were reported for 1 of 193 (<1%) AdvSM patients (all 
doses), none were observed in the AdvSM group receiving a starting dose of 200 mg once daily. 
Overall, 1.6% of AdvSM patients (all doses) required permanent discontinuation of avapritinib for a 
cognitive adverse reaction, 8% required a dose interruption, and 9% required dose reduction.  
Cognitive effects occurred in 20% of the patients aged ≥65 years receiving a starting dose of 200 mg 
once daily.

Indolent systemic mastocytosis 
In Part 2 of the PIONEER study, cognitive effects occurred in 2.8% of patients with ISM who 
received 25 mg of avapritinib (see section 4.4); all cognitive effects were Grade 1 or 2. Overall, none 
of the patients who received avapritinib in Part 2 of PIONEER required permanent treatment 
discontinuation for cognitive effects. 
Anaphylactic adverse reactions 
Indolent systemic mastocytosis 
Anaphylaxis is a common clinical manifestation of ISM. In Part 2 of the PIONEER study, patients 
who received 25 mg of avapritinib had fewer episodes of anaphylaxis over time (5% during the ~8-
week screening period versus 1% during Part 2). 
Elderly 
Unresectable or metastatic GIST 
In NAVIGATOR and VOYAGER (N=550) (see section 5.1), 39% of patients were 65 years of age 
and older, and 9% were 75 years of age and older. Compared with younger patients (<65), more 
patients ≥65 years old had reported adverse reactions that led to dose reductions (55% versus 45%) 
and dose discontinuation (18% versus 4%). The types of adverse reactions reported were similar 
regardless of age. Older patients reported more Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions compared to 
younger patients (63% versus 50%). 
Advanced systemic mastocytosis  
In patients treated at 200 mg in EXPLORER and PATHFINDER (N=126) (see section 5.1), 63% of 
patients were 65 years of age or older, and 21% were 75 years of age and older. Compared with 
younger patients (<65), more patients ≥65 years old reported adverse reactions that led to dose 
reductions (62% versus 73%). A similar fraction of patients reported adverse reactions that led to dose 
discontinuation (9% versus 6%). The types of adverse reactions reported were similar regardless of 
age. Older patients reported more Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions (63.3%) compared to younger 
patients (53.2%). 
Indolent systemic mastocytosis 
In Part 2 of PIONEER (N=141) (see section 5.1), 9 (6%) patients were 65 years of age or older, and 1 
(<1%) patient was 75 years of age or older. No patients over the age of 84 were included. Overall, no 
meaningful differences in safety were observed between patients ≥65 years and those <65 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
There is limited experience with cases of overdose reported in clinical studies with avapritinib. The 
maximum dose of avapritinib studied clinically is 600 mg orally once daily. Adverse reactions 
observed at this dose were consistent with the safety profile at 300 mg or 400 mg once daily (see 
section 4.8). 
Management 
There is no known antidote for avapritinib overdose. In the event of suspected overdose, avapritinib 
should be interrupted and supportive care instituted. Based on the large volume of distribution of 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
avapritinib and extensive protein binding, dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of 
avapritinib.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01EX18. 
Mechanism of action 
Avapritinib is a Type 1 kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated biochemical in vitro activity on the 
PDGFRA D842V and KIT D816V mutants associated with resistance to imatinib, sunitinib and 
regorafenib with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 0.24 nM and 0.27 nM, respectively, 
and greater potency against clinically relevant KIT exon 11, KIT exon 11/17 and KIT exon 17 mutants 
than against the KIT wild-type enzyme.  
In cellular assays, avapritinib inhibited the autophosphorylation of KIT D816V and PDGFRA D842V 
with IC50 of 4 nM and 30 nM, respectively. In cellular assays, avapritinib inhibited the proliferation in 
KIT mutant cell lines, including a murine mastocytoma cell line and a human mast cell leukaemia cell 
line. Avapritinib also showed growth inhibitory activity in a xenograft model of murine mastocytoma 
with KIT exon 17 mutation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Potential to prolong the QT interval  
The ability of avapritinib to prolong the QT interval was assessed in 27 patients administered 
avapritinib at doses of 300/400 mg (1.33 times the 300 mg dose recommended for GIST patients, 12 to 
16 times the 25 mg dose recommended for ISM patients) once daily in an open-label, single-arm study 
in patients with GIST. The estimated mean change from baseline in QTcF was 6.55 ms (90% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.80 to 11.29) at the observed steady state geometric mean Cmax of 
899 ng/mL (12.8-fold higher than the steady state geometric mean Cmax of avapritinib at 25 mg dose 
once daily in patients with ISM). No effect on heart rate or cardiac conduction (PR, QRS, and RR 
intervals) was observed. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Clinical studies in unresectable or metastatic GIST 
The efficacy and safety of avapritinib was assessed in a multi-centre, single-arm, open-label clinical 
study (BLU-285-1101; NAVIGATOR). Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of GIST and an Eastern 
Clinical Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 (58% and 3% of patients had 
ECOG status 1 and 2, respectively) were included in the study. A total of 217 patients received a 
starting dose of either 300 mg or 400 mg once daily. 
Efficacy was assessed on the basis of overall response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation 
Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 modified for patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST 
(mRECIST v1.1) and duration of response (DOR), as evaluated by a Blinded Independent Central 
Review (BICR).  
In addition, a total of 239 patients have received treatment with avapritinib at the relevant starting dose 
in an ongoing open-label, randomised phase 3 study (BLU-285-1303; VOYAGER) in which PFS is 
the primary endpoint. Ninety six additional patients received avapritinib in this study after disease 
progression on the regorafenib control treatment (crossover). As of the last data cut-off date, 9th 
March 2020, the median treatment duration was 8.9 months in patients with GIST harbouring the 
PDGFRA D842V mutation included in this study, which provides some preliminary comparative 
safety data. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PDGFRA D842V mutation 
A total of 38 patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring the PDGFRA D842V mutation 
were enrolled and treated with avapritinib at a starting dose of either 300 mg or 400 mg once daily. In 
the NAVIGATOR study 71% of patients with unresectable or metastatic GIST harbouring the 
PDGFRA D842V mutation had dose reductions to 200 mg or 100 mg once daily during the course of 
therapy. Median time to dose reduction was 12 weeks. The GIST patients were required to have 
unresectable or metastatic disease and have a documented PDGFRA D842V mutation determined by a 
locally available diagnostic test. At 12 months, 27 patients were still on avapritinib with 22% 
receiving 300 mg once daily, 37% receiving 200 mg once daily and 41% receiving 100 mg once daily.  
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were median age of 64 years (range: 29 to 
90 years), 66% male, 66% white, ECOG PS of 0-2 (61% and 5% of patients had ECOG status 1 and 2, 
respectively), 97% had metastatic disease, largest target lesion was >5 cm for 58%, 90% had prior 
surgical resection, and median number of prior lines of tyrosine kinase inhibitors of 1 (range: 0 to 5).  
Efficacy results from study BLU-285-1101 (NAVIGATOR) for GIST patients harbouring the 
PDGFRA D842V mutation are summarised in Table 6. The data represent a median duration of 
follow-up of 26 months across all patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations who were alive, the 
median OS had not been reached with 74% of patients alive. The median progression free survival was 
24 months. Radiographic tumour reductions were observed in 98% of patients.

In patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant GIST treated at starting doses of 300 or 400 mg once daily 
the ORR based on central radiology review by mRECIST v1.1 criteria was 95%.  
Based on preliminary results from the ongoing phase 3 study BLU-285-1303 (VOYAGER) in a subset 
of 13 patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations, partial response was reported in 3 out of 7 patients in 
the avapritinib group (43% ORR) and none of the 6 patients in the regorafenib group (0% ORR). The 
median PFS there was not estimable in patients with PDGFRA D842V mutations randomized to 
avapritinib (95% CI: 9.7, NE) compared to 4.5 months in patients receiving regorafenib (95% CI: 1.7,

Clinical studies in advanced systemic mastocytosis 
The efficacy and safety of avapritinib was assessed in a multi-center, single-arm, open-label Phase 2 
study BLU-285-2202 (PATHFINDER). Eligible patients were required to have an ECOG PS of 0 to 3. 
Patients with high and very high risk AHNs such as AML or high risk MDS, and Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive malignancies were excluded. Palliative and supportive care medications were 
allowed. The response-evaluable population according to modified IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria as 
adjudicated by a central committee includes patients with a diagnosis of AdvSM, who had received at 
least 1 dose of avapritinib, had at least 2 post-baseline bone marrow assessments and had been on 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study for at least 24 weeks, or had an end of study visit. The primary efficacy outcome measure was 
ORR per modified IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria as adjudicated by the central committee.  
Of 107 patients enrolled in the study, 67 patients had at least one prior systemic therapy and were 
treated at a starting dose of 200 mg orally once daily.   
The assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint was based on a total of 47 AdvSM patients, evaluable 
according to the modified IWG-MRT-ECNM response criteria, enrolled in the study, who received at 
least one prior systemic therapy and a starting dose of 200 mg avapritinib once daily with 78.7% of 
patients having received prior midostaurin, 17.0% prior cladribine, 14.9 % prior interferon alpha, 
10.6% prior hydroxycarbamide and 6.4% prior azacytidine. Thirty seven (79%) out of the 47 patients 
with AdvSM who received at least one prior systemic therapy and a starting dose of 200 mg 
avapritinib had one or more dose reductions during the course of therapy with a median time to dose 
reduction of 6 weeks. The study population characteristics were: median age of 69 years (range: 31 to 
86 years), 70% male, 92% white, ECOG PS of 0-3 (66% and 34% of patients had an ECOG PS of 0-1 
and 2-3, respectively), and 89% had a detectable KIT D816V mutation. Before initiation of avapritinib 
treatment, the median bone marrow mast cell infiltrate was 70%, the median serum tryptase level was 
325 ng/mL, and the median KIT D816V mutant allele fraction (MAF) was 26.2%.  
Efficacy results in patients with AdvSM enrolled in the study, who received at least one prior systemic 
therapy and a starting dose of 200 mg avapritinib once daily, with a median duration of follow-up of 
12 months are summarized in Table 7.

2 Estimated from Kaplan-Meier analysis 
Among patients treated with avapritinib at a starting dose of 200 mg once daily following at least one 
prior systemic therapy, 83.1% of patients had ≥50% decrease of bone marrow mast cells with 58.5% 
patients having complete elimination of bone marrow mast cell aggregates; 88.1% of patients had 
≥50% reduction in serum tryptase with 49.3% reducing serum tryptase <20 ng/mL; 68.7% of patients 
had a ≥50% decrease in KIT D816V MAF in blood and 60.0% of patients had ≥35% spleen volume 
reduction from baseline. 
In a supportive multi-center, single-arm, open-label Phase 1 study BLU-285-2101 (EXPLORER), the 
ORR according to the mIWG-MRT-ECNM criteria was 73% (95% confidence interval: 39.0, 94.0) for 
11 AdvSM patients who received at least one prior systemic therapy and a starting dose of 200 mg 
avapritinib once daily. 
Clinical studies in indolent systemic mastocytosis 
The efficacy and safety of avapritinib was assessed in study BLU-285-2203 (PIONEER), a 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-part study conducted in adult patients with ISM with 
moderate-to-severe symptoms not adequately controlled by best supportive care. In Part 2 (pivotal 
part), patients were randomised to receive avapritinib at the recommended dose of 25 mg orally once 
daily with best supportive care (141 patients) versus placebo with best supportive care (71 patients). 
The randomized portion of the study consisted of a 24-week period. Part 3 of study BLU-285-2203 is 
ongoing. 
The primary endpoint in Part 2 was mean change from baseline to Week 24 in total symptom score 
(TSS) as measured by the ISM Symptom Assessment Form (ISM-SAF). The ISM-SAF is a patient-
reported outcome tool made up of a 12-item questionnaire developed specifically to assess symptoms 
in patients with ISM. Patient-reported severity scores for 11 ISM symptoms (bone pain, abdominal 
pain, nausea, spots, itching, flushing, fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, headache, diarrhoea; 0=none; 
10=worst imaginable) are summed to calculate the TSS (range 0-110), with higher scores representing 
greater symptom burden. The 12th item of the questionnaire assesses the number of diarrhoea episodes.  
For the purpose of the study, enrolled patients needed a total symptom score (TSS) of 28 or greater at 
screening. Patients were required to have failed to achieve adequate symptom control for 1 or more 
baseline symptoms with at least 2 symptomatic therapies, including but not limited to: H1 
antihistamines, H2 antihistamines, proton pump inhibitors, leukotriene inhibitors, cromolyn sodium, 
corticosteroids, or omalizumab. 
Additional patient-reported key secondary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of avapritinib-
treated patients achieving ≥50% and ≥30% reduction from baseline through Week 24 in TSS 
compared to placebo. Objective measures of mast cell burden were also reported as key secondary 
efficacy endpoints and included the proportion of patients with a ≥50% reduction from baseline 
through Week 24 in serum tryptase, peripheral blood KIT D816V allele fraction and in bone marrow 
mast cells. 
The study population characteristics were: median age of 51 years (range: 18 to 79 years), 73% were 
female, 80% were white, and 94% had a KIT D816V mutation. At baseline, the mean TSS was 50.93 
(range: 12.1 to 104.4), the median serum tryptase level was 39.20 ng/mL (range: 3.6 to 501.6 ng/mL), 
the median KIT D816V mutant allele fraction was 0.32% by digital-droplet polymerase chain reaction 
(ddPCR) and the median bone marrow mast cell infiltrate was 7%.  
The majority of patients (99.5%) received concomitant best supportive care at baseline (median of 3 
therapies). The most common therapies were H1 antihistamines (98.1%), H2 antihistamines (66%), 
leukotriene inhibitors (34.9%) and cromolyn sodium (32.1%).

The long-term efficacy of avapritinib is assessed in an open-label extension of PIONEER in patients 
receiving 25 mg of avapritinib (Part 3). Overall, 201 patients rolled over from Part 2 into Part 3 of 
PIONEER. Avapritinib-treated patients from Part 2 continued to report improvements in TSS over 
time out to approximately 48 weeks (Part 3 C7D1) of treatment with a mean change from baseline in 
TSS of -18.05 points (95% CI -21.55, -14.56). Placebo-treated patients from Part 2 who received 
avapritinib in Part 3 reported substantial additional reductions in their TSS scores within the first 
24 weeks of treatment (Part 3 C7D1) with a total mean change from baseline in TSS of -19.71 points 
23 
 
 
 
(95% CI -24.32, -15.11), which included a further 10.78 point reduction from Part 3 baseline just prior 
to rolling over to avapritinib. 
Elderly population 
Unresectable or metastatic GIST 
Forty-two percent of the patients who received AYVAKYT at a starting dose of 300 mg and 400 mg 
once daily in NAVIGATOR were 65 years or older. No overall differences in efficacy were observed 
in comparison with younger patients. Only limited data are available from the use of avapritinib in 
patients aged 75 years or older (8% (3 out of 38)). 
Advanced systemic mastocytosis 
Of the 47 patients who received AYVAKYT at a starting dose of 200 mg and who received at least 
one prior systemic therapy in PATHFINDER, 64% were 65 years or older, while 21% were 75 years 
and older. No overall differences in efficacy were observed between patients ≥65 years and those 
<65 years. 
Indolent systemic mastocytosis 
Of the 141 patients with ISM who received AYVAKYT in Part 2 (pivotal part) of PIONEER, 9 (6%) 
patients were 65 years or older, while 1 (<1%) patient was 75 years and older. No patients over the age 
of 84 were included. Overall, no meaningful differences in efficacy were observed between patients 
≥65 years and those <65 years. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
AYVAKYT in one or more subsets of the paediatric population with a relapsed/refractory solid 
tumour harbouring mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric 
use). 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
AYVAKYT in all subsets of the paediatric population with mastocytosis (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. 
This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following administration of avapritinib once daily, steady state was reached by 15 days.  
Unresectable or metastatic GIST (300 mg once daily dose) 
After a single dose and repeat dosing of avapritinib, systemic exposure of avapritinib was dose-
proportional over the dose range of 30 to 400 mg once daily in patients with unresectable or metastatic 
GIST. The steady state geometric mean (CV%) maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC0-tau) of avapritinib at 300 mg once daily was 813 ng/mL (52%) and 
15400 h•ng/mL (48%), respectively. The geometric mean accumulation ratio after repeat dosing was 
3.1 to 4.6. 
Advanced systemic mastocytosis (200 mg once daily dose) 
Steady-state Cmax and AUC of avapritinib increased proportionally over the dose range of 30 mg to 
400 mg once daily in patients with AdvSM. The steady state geometric mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC0-24 
of avapritinib at 200 mg once daily was 377 ng/mL (62%) and 6600 h•ng/mL (54%), respectively. The 
geometric mean accumulation ratio after repeat dosing (30-400 mg) was 2.6 to 5.8. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Indolent systemic mastocytosis (25 mg once daily dose) 
The Cmax and AUC of avapritinib increased proportionally over the dose range of 25 mg to 100 mg 
once daily in patients with ISM. The steady state geometric mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC0-24 of 
avapritinib at 25 mg once daily was 70.2 ng/mL (47.8%) and 1330 h•ng/mL (49.5%), respectively. 
The geometric mean accumulation ratio after repeat dosing was 3.59. 
Absorption 
Following administration of single oral doses of avapritinib of 25 to 400 mg, the median time to peak 
concentration (Tmax) ranged from 2 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability has not been 
determined. The population estimated mean oral bioavailability of avapritinib in patients with GIST 
and AdvSM is 16% and 47% lower, respectively, compared to that in patients with ISM. 
Effect of food  
Avapritinib Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 59% and 29%, respectively, in healthy subjects 
administered avapritinib after a high fat meal (approximately 909 calories, 58 grams carbohydrate, 
56 grams fat and 43 grams protein) compared to the Cmax and AUCinf after overnight fasting.  
Distribution 
Avapritinib is 98.8% bound to human plasma proteins in vitro and the binding is not concentration-
dependent. The blood-to-plasma ratio is 0.95. Population estimated apparent central volume of 
distribution of avapritinib  (Vc/F) is 971 L at median lean body weight of 54 kg. The inter-individual 
variability of Vc/F is 50.1%. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro studies demonstrated that oxidative metabolism of avapritinib is predominantly mediated by 
CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and to a minor extent by CYP2C9. The relative contributions of CYP2C9 and 
CYP3A to the in vitro metabolism of avapritinib were 15.1% and 84.9%, respectively. The formation 
of the glucuronide M690 is catalysed mainly by UGT1A3. 
Following a single dose of approximately 310 mg (~100 µCi) [14C]avapritinib to healthy subjects, 
oxidation, glucuronidation, oxidative deamination and N-dealkylation were the primary metabolic 
pathways. Unchanged avapritinib (49%) and metabolites, M690 (hydroxy glucuronide; 35%) and 
M499 (oxidative deamination; 14%) were the major circulating radioactive components. Following 
oral administration of avapritinib 300 mg once daily in patients, the steady state AUC of the 
constitutive enantiomers of M499, BLU111207 and BLU111208 are approximately 35% and 42% of 
the AUC of avapritinib. At a dose of 25 mg once daily, the metabolite to parent ratio for BLU111207 
and BLU111208 was 10.3% and 17.5 % respectively. Compared to avapritinib (IC50 = 4 nM), the 
enantiomers BLU111207 (IC50 = 41.8 nM) and BLU111208 (IC50 = 12.4 nM) are 10.5- and 3.1-fold 
less potent, respectively, against KIT D816V in vitro.  
In vitro studies demonstrated that avapritinib is a direct inhibitor of CYP3A4 and a time-dependent 
inhibitor of CYP3A4, at clinically relevant concentrations (see section 4.5). In vitro, avapritinib did 
not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. 
In vitro, at clinically relevant concentrations, avapritinib induced CYP3A (see section 4.5). In vitro, 
avapritinib did not induce CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 at clinically relevant concentrations.  
Elimination 
Following single doses of AYVAKYT in patients with GIST, AdvSM and ISM, the mean plasma 
elimination half-life of avapritinib was 32 to 57 hours, 20 to 39 hours and 38 to 45 hours, respectively. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Population estimated mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of avapritinib is 16.9 L/h. In AdvSM patients, 
time-dependent CL/F on Day 9 was reduced to 39.4% compared to GIST and ISM patients. The inter-
individual variability in CL/F is 44.4%. 
Following a single oral dose of approximately 310 mg (~100 µCi) [14C]avapritinib to healthy subjects, 
70% of the radioactive dose was recovered in faeces and 18% excreted in urine. Unchanged 
avapritinib accounted for 11% and 0.23% of the administered radioactive dose excreted in faeces and 
urine, respectively.  
Effects of avapritinib on transport proteins 
In vitro, avapritinib is not a substrate of P-gp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, MATE1, MATE2-K and BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Avapritinib is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, MATE1, MATE2-K, and BSEP in vitro (see section 4.5). 
In vitro, avapritinib did not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, or OCT2 at clinically 
relevant concentrations. 
Gastric acid reducing active substances 
No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted. Based on both population and 
noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analyses, the effect of gastric acid reducing agents on the 
bioavailability of avapritinib is not clinically relevant. 
Special populations 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that age (18-90 years), body weight (40-156 kg), sex 
and albumin concentration have no effect on the exposure of avapritinib. Concomitant use of proton 
pump inhibitors (PPI) on bioavailability (F) and lean body weight on the apparent central volume of 
distribution (Vc/F) were identified as statistically significant covariates with impact on avapritinib 
exposure. Lean body weight (30 kg to 80 kg) showed modest impact on Cmax at steady state (+/- 5%), 
while concomitant use of PPIs led to ~19% reduction in AUC and Cmax. These minor effects on 
exposure are not clinically significant given the PK variability (>40% CV) and are not expected to 
impact efficacy or safety. No significant effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of avapritinib was 
found, although the low number of Black (N=27) and Asian (N=26) subjects limits the conclusions 
that can be derived based on race.  
Hepatic impairment  
As hepatic elimination is a major route of excretion for avapritinib, hepatic impairment may result in 
increased plasma avapritinib concentrations. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, 
avapritinib exposures were similar between 72 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin 
within upper limit of normal [ULN] and AST > ULN or total bilirubin >1 to 1.5 times ULN and any 
AST), 13 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 to 3.0 times ULN and any 
AST), and 402 subjects with normal hepatic function (total bilirubin and AST within ULN). In a 
clinical study investigating the effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of 
avapritinib following administration of a single oral dose of 100 mg avapritinib, the mean unbound 
AUC was 61% higher in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) as compared 
to matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. A lower starting dose is recommended in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment  
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, avapritinib exposures were similar among 
136 subjects with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60-89 mL/min), 52 subjects with moderate renal 
impairment (CLcr 30-59 mL/min) and 298 subjects with normal renal function (CLcr ≥90 mL/min), 
suggesting that no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics of avapritinib in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr 15-29 mL/min) or 
end-stage renal disease (CLcr <15 mL/min) has not been studied.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Repeat dose toxicology studies 
Haemorrhage in the brain and spinal cord occurred in dogs at doses greater than or equal to 
15 mg/kg/day (approximately 9.0, 1.8 and 0.8 times the human exposure based on AUC at 25 mg, 
200 mg and 300 mg dose once daily, respectively) and choroid plexus oedema in the brain occurred in 
dogs at doses greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 4.7, 1.0 and 0.4 times the human 
exposure based on AUC at the clinical dose of 25 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg once daily, respectively). 
Rats manifested convulsions, which was potentially secondary to inhibition of Nav 1.2 at systemic 
exposures ≥96, 12 and ≥8-fold higher than the exposure in patients at the clinical dose of 25 mg, 
200 mg and 300 mg once daily.  
In a 6 month repeat dose toxicology study in rats, rats manifested haemorrhagic and cystic 
degeneration of the ovarian corpus lutea and vaginal mucification at dose levels greater or equal to 
3 mg/kg/day with exposure margins of 15, 3 and 1.3 times the human exposure based on AUC at 
25 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg, respectively. In a 9 month repeat dose toxicology study in dogs, 
hypospermatogenesis (3/4 males) was observed at the highest dose tested, 5 mg/kg/day (5.7, 1.2 and 
<1 times the human exposure (AUC) at 25 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg dose, respectively). 
Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity  
Avapritinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test). It was 
positive in the in vitro chromosome aberration test in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes 
but negative in the rats for both the bone marrow micronucleus test and for the chromosomal damage 
liver comet assays, and thus, overall non-genotoxic. The carcinogenic potential of avapritinib was 
evaluated in a 6 month transgenic mouse study where higher incidences of lower thymic cortical 
cellularity were noted at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day doses. A long-term carcinogenicity study with 
avapritinib is ongoing. 
Toxicity to reproduction and development  
A dedicated combined male and female fertility and early embryonic development study was 
conducted in rats at oral avapritinib doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day for males, and 3, 10, and 
20 mg/kg/day for females. No direct effects on male or female fertility were noted at the highest dose 
levels tested in this study (100.8 and 62.6 times the human exposure (AUC) at 25 mg, 20.3 and 
9.5 times the human exposure (AUC) at 200 mg and 8.7 and 4.1 times the human exposure (AUC) at 
300 mg). 
Avapritinib partitioned into seminal fluids up to 0.1 times the concentration found in human plasma at 
25 mg. There was an increase in pre-implantation loss and in early resorptions with exposure margins 
of 15, 3 and 1.3 times the human exposure (AUC) at the clinical doses of 25 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg, 
respectively. Reduction in sperm production and relative testicular weight were observed in male rats 
administered avapritinib at exposures of 7 and 30 times, 1 and 5 times, and 0.6 and 3 times the 25 mg, 
200 mg, and 300 mg human doses, respectively. 
In an embryo-foetal development toxicity study in rats, avapritinib showed embryotoxic and 
teratogenic effects (decreases in foetal weights and viability, and increases in visceral and skeletal 
malformations). Oral administration of avapritinib during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic 
and embryotoxic in rats at exposures approximately 31.4, 6.3 and 2.7 times the human exposure 
(AUC) at the 25 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg dose, respectively. 
Phototoxicity studies 
An in vitro phototoxicity study in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts as well as a phototoxicity study in pigmented 
rats demonstrated that avapritinib has a slight potential for phototoxicity.

1. 
What AYVAKYT is and what it is used for 
What AYVAKYT is 
AYVAKYT is a medicine containing the active substance avapritinib.  
What AYVAKYT is used for 
AYVAKYT is used in adults to treat aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis 
with associated haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one 
systemic therapy. These are disorders in which the body produces too many mast cells, a type of white 
blood cell. Symptoms are caused when too many mast cells enter various organs of your body, such as 
the liver, bone marrow or spleen. These mast cells also release substances such as histamine which 
cause various general symptoms that you may be experiencing as well as damage to involved organs. 
ASM, SM-AHN and MCL are collectively referred to as advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM). 
AYVAKYT is also used for the treatment of adults with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) with 
moderate to severe symptoms inadequately controlled on symptomatic treatment. This is a disorder in 
which your body has many abnormal mast cells. Mast cells are the white blood cells responsible for 
allergic reactions. These cells may be in any tissue in your body but are often found in your skin, your 
intestines and your bone marrow. These abnormal mast cells can cause symptoms such as severe 
allergic reactions, diarrhoea, rash and difficulty thinking. 
How AYVAKYT works 
AYVAKYT stops the activity of a group of proteins in the body called kinases. Mast cells in patients 
with AdvSM and ISM usually have changes (mutations) in the genes involved in making specific 
kinases associated with the growth and spread of these cells.  
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have any questions about how AYVAKYT works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, please ask your doctor. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take AYVAKYT 
Do not take AYVAKYT: 
- 
if you are allergic to avapritinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking AYVAKYT: 
- 
if you have suffered a vascular aneurysm (bulging and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or 
bleeding in your brain in the last year. 
if you have low platelet counts. 
If you are taking a medicine that thins the blood to prevent blood clots such as warfarin or 
phenprocoumon. 
- 
- 
Take special care with this medicine: 
-  You may develop symptoms such as severe headache, vision problems, severe sleepiness, or 
severe weakness on one side of your body (signs of bleeding in your brain). If these occur, 
contact your doctor immediately and temporarily stop treatment. For patients with AdvSM, your 
doctor will evaluate your platelet counts before you start treatment and monitor them as needed 
during your treatment with avapritinib. 
-  Treatment with this medicine may lead to a higher risk of bleeding in patients with AdvSM. 
Avapritinib can cause bleeding in the digestive system such as stomach, rectum, or intestine. Tell 
your doctor if you had or have any bleeding problems. Before you start taking avapritinib your 
doctor may decide to do blood tests. Get medical help immediately, if you get the following 
symptoms: passing blood in the stools or passing black stools, stomach pain, coughing/vomiting 
up blood. 
-  You may also develop memory loss, changes in memory, or be confused (signs of a cognitive 
effect). Avapritinib can sometimes change how you think and how you remember information. 
Contact your doctor in case you experience these symptoms or in case a family member, caregiver 
or someone who knows you notices that you are getting forgetful or confused. 
-  During treatment with this medicine, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very 
quickly, develop swelling of your face or limbs, have difficulty breathing or become short of 
breath. This medicine may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention can occur in 
patients with AdvSM).  
-  Avapritinib may cause abnormality of your heart rhythm. Your doctor may conduct tests to 
evaluate these problems during your treatment with avapritinib. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, 
faint, or have abnormal heartbeats while taking this medicine.  
-  You may get severe stomach and bowel problems (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) if you 
have AdvSM. Get medical help immediately if you experience these symptoms. 
-  You may become more sensitive to the sun while taking this medicine. It is important to cover 
sun-exposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). 
While you are taking avapritinib, your doctor will ask you to have regular blood tests and weigh you 
regularly if you have AdvSM. 
For more information see section 4.

1. 
What AYVAKYT is and what it is used for 
What AYVAKYT is 
AYVAKYT is a medicine containing the active substance avapritinib.  
What AYVAKYT is used for 
AYVAKYT is used in adults to treat: 
• 
• 
a type of digestive tract cancer called gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), when it cannot 
be treated with surgery (unresectable) or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) and 
that has a specific mutation (D842V) in the gene for platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
alpha (PDGFRA) protein kinase. 
aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated 
haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one 
systemic therapy. These are disorders in which the body produces too many mast cells, a type 
of white blood cell. Symptoms are caused when too many mast cells enter various organs of 
your body, such as the liver, bone marrow or spleen. These mast cells also release substances 
such as histamine which cause various general symptoms that you may be experiencing as 
well as damage to involved organs. 
ASM, SM-AHN and MCL are collectively referred to as advanced systemic mastocytosis 
(AdvSM). 
How AYVAKYT works 
AYVAKYT stops the activity of a group of proteins in the body called kinases. Mast cells in patients 
with AdvSM or cells that make up the cancer usually have changes (mutations) in the genes involved 
in making specific kinases associated with the growth and spread of these cells. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have any questions about how AYVAKYT works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, please ask your doctor. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take AYVAKYT 
Do not take AYVAKYT: 
- 
if you are allergic to avapritinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking AYVAKYT: 
- 
if you have suffered a vascular aneurysm (bulging and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or 
bleeding in your brain in the last year. 
if you have low platelet counts. 
If you are taking a medicine that thins the blood to prevent blood clots such as warfarin or 
phenprocoumon. 
- 
- 
Take special care with this medicine: 
-  You may develop symptoms such as severe headache, vision problems, severe sleepiness, or 
severe weakness on one side of your body (signs of bleeding in your brain). If these occur, 
contact your doctor immediately and temporarily stop treatment. For patients with AdvSM, your 
doctor will evaluate your platelet counts before you start treatment and monitor them as needed 
during your treatment with avapritinib. 
-  Treatment with this medicine may lead to a higher risk of bleeding. Avapritinib can cause 
bleeding in the digestive system such as stomach, rectum, or intestine. In patients with GIST, 
avapritinib can also cause bleeding in the liver, as well as bleeding of the tumour. Tell your doctor 
if you had or have any bleeding problems. Before you start taking avapritinib your doctor may 
decide to do blood tests. Get medical help immediately, if you get the following symptoms: 
passing blood in the stools or passing black stools, stomach pain, coughing/vomiting up blood. 
-  You may also develop memory loss, changes in memory, or be confused (signs of a cognitive 
effect). Avapritinib can sometimes change how you think and how you remember information. 
Contact your doctor in case you experience these symptoms or in case a family member, caregiver 
or someone who knows you notices that you are getting forgetful or confused. 
-  During treatment with this medicine, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very 
quickly, develop swelling of your face or limbs, have difficulty breathing or become short of 
breath. This medicine may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention).  
-  Avapritinib may cause abnormality of your heart rhythm. Your doctor may conduct tests to 
evaluate these problems during your treatment with avapritinib. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, 
faint, or have abnormal heartbeats while taking this medicine.  
-  You may get severe stomach and bowel problems (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting). Get 
medical help immediately if you experience these symptoms. 
-  You may become more sensitive to the sun while taking this medicine. It is important to cover 
sun-exposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). 
While you are taking avapritinib, your doctor will ask you to have regular blood tests. You will also be 
weighed regularly.

1. 
What AYVAKYT is and what it is used for 
What AYVAKYT is 
AYVAKYT is a medicine containing the active substance avapritinib.  
What AYVAKYT is used for 
AYVAKYT is used in adults to treat: 
• 
• 
a type of digestive tract cancer called gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), when it cannot 
be treated with surgery (unresectable) or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) and 
that has a specific mutation (D842V) in the gene for platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
alpha (PDGFRA) protein kinase. 
aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with associated 
haematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), or mast cell leukaemia (MCL), after at least one 
systemic therapy. These are disorders in which the body produces too many mast cells, a type 
of white blood cell. Symptoms are caused when too many mast cells enter various organs of 
your body, such as the liver, bone marrow or spleen. These mast cells also release substances 
such as histamine which cause various general symptoms that you may be experiencing as 
well as damage to involved organs. 
ASM, SM-AHN and MCL are collectively referred to as advanced systemic mastocytosis 
(AdvSM). 
How AYVAKYT works 
AYVAKYT stops the activity of a group of proteins in the body called kinases. Mast cells in patients 
with AdvSM or cells that make up the cancer usually have changes (mutations) in the genes involved 
in making specific kinases associated with the growth and spread of these cells.

If you have any questions about how AYVAKYT works or why this medicine has been prescribed for 
you, please ask your doctor. 
2. 
What you need to know before you take AYVAKYT 
Do not take AYVAKYT: 
- 
if you are allergic to avapritinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6).  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking AYVAKYT: 
- 
if you have suffered a vascular aneurysm (bulging and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or 
bleeding in your brain in the last year. 
if you have low platelet counts. 
If you are taking a medicine that thins the blood to prevent blood clots such as warfarin or 
phenprocoumon. 
- 
- 
Take special care with this medicine: 
-  You may develop symptoms such as severe headache, vision problems, severe sleepiness, or 
severe weakness on one side of your body (signs of bleeding in your brain). If these occur, 
contact your doctor immediately and temporarily stop treatment. For patients with AdvSM, your 
doctor will evaluate your platelet counts before you start treatment and monitor them as needed 
during your treatment with avapritinib. 
-  Treatment with this medicine may lead to a higher risk of bleeding. Avapritinib can cause 
bleeding in the digestive system such as stomach, rectum, or intestine. In patients with GIST, 
avapritinib can also cause bleeding in the liver, as well as bleeding of the tumour. Tell your doctor 
if you had or have any bleeding problems. Before you start taking avapritinib your doctor may 
decide to do blood tests. Get medical help immediately, if you get the following symptoms: 
passing blood in the stools or passing black stools, stomach pain, coughing/vomiting up blood. 
-  You may also develop memory loss, changes in memory, or be confused (signs of a cognitive 
effect). Avapritinib can sometimes change how you think and how you remember information. 
Contact your doctor in case you experience these symptoms or in case a family member, caregiver 
or someone who knows you notices that you are getting forgetful or confused. 
-  During treatment with this medicine, tell your doctor straight away if you put on weight very 
quickly, develop swelling of your face or limbs, have difficulty breathing or become short of 
breath. This medicine may cause your body to retain water (severe fluid retention).  
-  Avapritinib may cause abnormality of your heart rhythm. Your doctor may conduct tests to 
evaluate these problems during your treatment with avapritinib. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, 
faint, or have abnormal heartbeats while taking this medicine.  
-  You may get severe stomach and bowel problems (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting). Get 
medical help immediately if you experience these symptoms. 
-  You may become more sensitive to the sun while taking this medicine. It is important to cover 
sun-exposed areas of skin and use sunscreen with high sun protection factor (SPF). 
While you are taking avapritinib, your doctor will ask you to have regular blood tests. You will also be 
weighed regularly.

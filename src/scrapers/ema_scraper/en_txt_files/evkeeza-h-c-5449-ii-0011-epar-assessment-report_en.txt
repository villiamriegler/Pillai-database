Extension of indication to include the treatment of paediatric patients with homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) aged 5 years and older for EVKEEZA, based on interim results from 
study R1500-CL-17100, as well as supportive information from an updated interim analysis of study 
R1500-CL-1719, and an extrapolation analysis (including population PK, population PK/PD, and 
simulation analyses). R1500-CL-17100 is an ongoing multicentre, three-part, single-arm, open-label 
study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of evinacumab in paediatric patients aged ≥ 5 to 
11 years with HoFH. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 1.1 of the RMP has also been submitted. In 
addition, the marketing authorisation holder took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes 
to the PI. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.3.
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).
Information on paediatric requirements
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) 
P/0087/2023 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0087/2023 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

Evkeeza received a marketing authorisation (MA) under exceptional circumstances.
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

2.1.1.  Problem statement
Disease or condition
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic disorder of lipid metabolism, a life-
threatening condition resulting in severely elevated LDL-C (> 13mmol/L) leading to premature 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and, in untreated patients, premature death. The goal of therapy in 
patients with HoFH is to reduce LDL-C, thereby reducing atherogenesis and subsequently reducing CVD 
events and mortality. Currently, patients with HoFH tend to be treated with multiple lipid-lowering 
therapies (LLT) but are not able to achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C targets. 
HoFH is most often caused by the presence of loss-of-function variants in the low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) receptor, which leads to low or absent hepatic clearance of LDL cholesterol from the circulation. 
Genetic alterations that cause a virtually complete absence of LDL-receptor expression (null 
homozygotes) result in higher LDL cholesterol levels than genetic alterations that partially reduce LDL-
receptor activity with either two non-null alleles or one null and one non-null allele (non-null 
homozygotes). 
Mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) are classified into the following subtypes: 
1.
“Null/null” where little to no LDL binding and uptake activity exists (<15% LDLR activity) 
2. Genotypically “negative/negative” where mutations in stop codons, frame shifts, splice site 
changes, small and large insertions/deletions, and copy number variations (CNVs) result in the loss 
of function of both LDLR alleles 
3. Genotypically "defective" where missense mutations (hypomorphs) result in diminished LDLR 
activity (>15% LDLR activity). 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication
In the current variation, a modified indication is proposed by the Applicant to include the treatment of 
paediatric patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) aged 5 -≤11 years  for 
EVKEEZA, based on interim results from study R1500-CL-17100, as well as supportive information 
from an updated interim analysis of study R1500-CL-1719, and an extrapolation analysis (including 
population PK, population PK/PD, and simulation analyses).
The claimed indication reads as follows (in bold the proposed extension of the indication):
Therapeutic indications
Evkeeza is indicated as an adjunct to diet and other low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) 
lowering therapies for the treatment of adult and adolescentpaediatric patients aged 512 years and 
older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH).
Epidemiology
HoFH is a rare (~1 in 300,000 in the EU) and life-threatening genetic condition resulting in severely 
elevated LDL-C (> 13mmol/L) from birth and premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). If left 
untreated, HoFH patients rarely live past the first or second decade of life. Moreover, even with the 
currently available lipid-lowering therapies, many patients still do not reach their target LDL-C goal and 
consequently are still at high risk for a CVD event. In a recent retrospective study in Italian patients 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 8/103
with HoFH, 22% of the patients had a CVD event before age 20, and 16.7% died before age 21, 
despite starting lipid-lowering treatments early (Stefanutti 2019).
Biologic features
Regardless of the underlying mutations, this disorder is characterised by a markedly elevated plasma 
LDL-C level from birth, which results in an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease. In children as young as 7 years of age, coronary atherosclerosis can be evident even without 
any clinically apparent coronary artery disease (CAD). For example, one study showed increased 
carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and cIMT progression at a rate approximately double that of 
unaffected siblings (Kusters, 2014). This accelerated atherosclerosis results in premature 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. 
Moreover, patients with mutations considered null/null or negative/negative have higher LDL-C levels 
and worse clinical outcomes. These patients develop xanthomas sooner, and untreated patients rarely 
live past the second decade (Moorjani, 1993) (Kolansky, 2008). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis
Because of the rarity of the condition (approximately 1 in 300,000), there is a paucity of data on CV 
risk in patients with HoFH; however, one study found significant CV morbidity early in life with 
evidence of ASCVD well before the age of 20 (Sjouke 2015). If left untreated, HoFH patients rarely live 
past the first or second decade of life, with one study indicating the mean age of the first event at 12.8 
years and an average age of ASCVD death of 17.7 years (Raal 2011). Further, a recent retrospective 
study in Italian and Chinese patients with HoFH showed that despite starting lipid-lowering treatments 
early (mean age of 5.6 year, Italian cohort, and 10.7 year, Chinese cohort), 22% (Italian cohort) and 
45% (Chinese cohort) of the patients had a CVD event before age 20 and 16.7% (Italian cohort) and 
31.8% (Chinese cohort) had died before age 21 (Stefanutti 2019). Additionally, another retrospective 
analysis showed that on-treatment total cholesterol is a major determinant of survival in patients with 
HoFH, with higher total cholesterol levels associated with a significantly increased risk of all-cause 
mortality (11.5 times greater in quartile 4 [>15.1 mmol/L] compared to quartile 1 [<8.1 mmol/L]) 
(Thompson 2018). 
Management
Attempts to lower cholesterol levels often require multiple lipid-lowering drugs and LDL apheresis. 
Despite these therapies, a majority of patients with this disorder do not reach guideline-recommended 
LDL cholesterol levels. Patients with HoFH are often treated with multiple lipid-lowering treatments 
(LLTs) including statins, evolocumab, ezetimibe, and lipid apheresis; however, these treatments are 
largely ineffective for patients either due to LDLR mutations, problems with tolerability, and/or they 
are not available for the paediatric population.
Statin therapy is the cornerstone treatment for LDL-C lowering in the paediatric population aged 6 
years and older and causes a 50% reduction in patients with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), however only a 15-30% reduction in LDL-C in patients with HoFH. The 
safety and efficacy of ezetimibe in children with HoFH aged less than 18 years have not been 
established. Further, lomitapide is not approved for use in paediatric patients. 
Evolocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor,  is indicated for paediatric HoFH patients aged 10 years and older. 
Anti-PCSK9 therapy on top of maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy resulted in a mean reduction 
in LDL-C of approximately 30% compared to placebo. Of note, only evolocumab is currently approved 
for patients with HoFH; use of alirocumab in patients with HoFH is considered off label. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 9/103
Despite intensive drug therapy, most of the patients with HoFH cannot achieve their treatment LDL-C 
goal (minimum of 50% reduction in LDL-C according to American heart Association/American College 
of Cardiology), also since statins and PCSK9 inhibitors are dependent on increasing LDLR activity, but 
many patients with HoFH are refractory to these treatments due to their mutations. Therefore, 
apheresis is an important adjunctive treatment for HoFH; a single treatment reduces LDL-C by 55%-
70% relative to pre-treatment levels. However, apheresis may be burdensome, and its availability is 
limited. Also, only a temporal reduction in LDL-C is achieved. 
Liver transplantation can be used to treat HoFH, although it is rarely used and considered as a last 
resort treatment option due to the many disadvantages, including a high risk of post-transplantation 
surgical complications and mortality, the paucity of donors, and the need for life-long treatment with 
immunosuppressive therapy. 
Due to the limitations of currently available treatments, there exists a high unmet medical need for 
new therapeutic options that reduce LDL-C and the inevitable risk for premature ASCVD in paediatric 
patients with HoFH. The unmet medical need is particularly severe for paediatric HoFH patients with 
null/null or negative/negative mutations where currently available LLTs provide little benefit in 
lowering LDL-C and for paediatric HoFH patients who lack treatment options.
2.1.2.  About the product
Evinacumab is a human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to and inhibits angiopoietin-like 3 
(ANGPTL3), which leads to reductions in LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and 
triglycerides (TGs). This gives a similar lipid phenotype that is found in humans with ANGPTL3 loss of 
function (LOF). This phenotype is associated with hypolipidemia and protection against atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease. 
Evinacumab reduces LDL-C independent of the presence of LDL receptor (LDLR) by promoting very 
low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) processing and clearance upstream of LDL formation; however, the 
exact mechanism of increased VLDL processing and clearance is not exactly known. Evinacumab 
blockade of ANGPTL3 lowers TGs and HDL-C by rescuing lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase 
activities, respectively. 
Evinacumab is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
Evkeeza is a 150 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion. The recommended dose is 15 mg/kg 
administered by intravenous infusion (IV) over 60 minutes once monthly (Q4W).
Evinacumab (Evkeeza) obtained full approval under exceptional circumstances as an adjunct to diet 
and other low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies for the treatment of adult and 
adolescent patients aged 12 years and older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH).
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice
Paediatric investigation plan
The application is based on the results of the paediatric development program in line with the 
approved PIP P/0087/2023 (Table 1) as also indicated by the partial compliance check by the EMA 
(EMA/145021/2023). EMA decision dated 16 May 2023: Studies R1500-CL-17100 and R1500-CL- 1719 
are confirmed to be compliant as set out in the EMA's Decision (P/0087/2023) of 10 March 2023.
The initial marketing authorization of evinacumab for the treatment of HoFH in adult and adolescent 
patients aged 12 years and older was based on data from R1500-CL-1629, a Phase 3, pivotal double-
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 10/103
blind, placebo-controlled study in adult and adolescent patients (12 to <18 years) with HoFH, with a 
24-week double-blind treatment period (DBTP) in a background of other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g. 
statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies, lomitapide, and lipoprotein apheresis, and a 24-week 
Open-label Treatment Period (OLTP) and was further supported by several other studies, including 
early data from an ongoing long-term, open-label safety and efficacy extension study in patients with 
HoFH (R1500-CL-1719). Adolescent patients were included in the pivotal phase 3 study (R1500-CL-
1629) as well as in the open-label extension study (R1500-CL-1719) due to the high unmet medical 
need in this patient group.
The current extension of indication application is based on data from Study R1500-CL-17100, an 
ongoing Phase 1b/3 single-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of evinacumab in paediatric (≥5 to <12 years) patients with HoFH, and a recent interim 
analysis of the ongoing open-label extension study, R1500-CL-1719, which provides updated long-term 
safety and efficacy data from adolescent (and adult) patients treated with evinacumab.
Additionally, a robust extrapolation analysis, including population pharmacokinetics (PK), population 
PK/pharmacodynamics (PD; population PK/PD), and simulations, based on data from multiple clinical 
studies is provided in support of the proposed indication.

2.2.  Quality aspects
Evinacumab concentrate for solution for infusion is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale 
yellow liquid that is essentially free from visible particles.
Evinacumab drug product (DP) is an aqueous buffered solution nominally containing 150 mg/mL of 
evinacumab. Other ingredients are: arginine hydrochloride, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, 
proline, histidine, polysorbate 80 and water for injections (WFI).
There are two DP presentations: One vial of 2.3 mL of concentrate containing 345 mg of evinacumab. 
One vial of 8 mL of concentrate containing 1,200 mg of evinacumab.  
The MAH wishes to extend the indication for EVKEEZA to include the treatment of paediatric patients 
with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) aged 5 years and older.
Excipients: No direct safety issues are foreseen with regards to the excipients. 
Dosing: No dose adjustment is required for paediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years. The recommended 
dose is 15 mg/kg administered by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes once monthly (every 4 
weeks).
According to the Denekamp schaal for bodyweight in children, the body weight for a 5-year-old girl is 
19 kg and for a 5 year old boy 19,5 kg. This gives a starting dose of 285 mg every 4 weeks, which is 
adequately covered by the smaller presentation (345 mg vial). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics
In the current procedure, the marketing authorisation holder, Ultragenyx Germany GmbH, is 
submitting a type II variation to extend the therapeutic indication for evinacumab to include paediatric 
patients aged 5 years to <12 years with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and is 
seeking approval under exceptional circumstances. The proposed posology is 15 mg/kg evinacumab 
administered via a Q4W infusion, which is similar to the posology in HoFH patients >12 years.
A summary of individual studies in the adult clinical pharmacology program, including pharmacokinetic 
(PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling and simulation analyses for evinacumab was previously 
provided in the original marketing authorization application (MAA) for evinacumab (Figure 1). 
The newly provided clinical pharmacology data primarily focus on interim results from paediatric Study 
R1500-CL-17100 and supportive updated interim data for adolescents and adults from Study 
R1500-CL-1719 (Table 2, Figure 1). Evinacumab PK data in children ≥5 to <12 years of age with 
HoFH was assessed using two population pharmacokinetic(/pharmacodynamic) analyses. The 
submitted studies and corresponding data were in line with the approved PIP, EMEA-002298-PIP01-17-
M05 (PIP decision number P/0087/2023). 
The first population pharmacokinetic analyses (R1500-PK-22070-SR-01V1) focussed on 
characterising the pharmacokinetics of patients ≥5 years to <12 years enrolled in Study R1500-CL-
17100 (Part A and Part B). Additionally, data was included from 6 studies in healthy adult subjects 
and adult and adolescent patients with HoFH (Study R1500-HV-1214, R1500-CL-1321, R1500-CL-
1642, R1500-CL-1331, R1500-CL-1629, R1500-CL-1719). In the second population 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, additional pharmacokinetic data from the ongoing 
R1500-CL-1719 study in adolescents and adults with HoFH were combined with the data included in 
first population pharmacokinetic analyses (R1500-PM-23041-SR-01V1). In addition, the relationship 
between total evinacumab concentration and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) response was also 
evaluated. 
Specific objectives of the paediatric clinical pharmacology program were to select an appropriate 
dosing regimen for patients with HoFH aged ≥5 to <12 years and to characterise the total evinacumab 
serum PK, the total ANGPTL3 serum concentrations, as a measure of target engagement, and the 
immunogenicity potential of evinacumab in these patients.

Methodology
Bioanalysis
Total evinacumab concentration in serum
There were no changes to the analytical methods for determining total evinacumab concentrations in 
human serum since the initial marketing authorization application. Briefly, a validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the concentrations of total evinacumab in human 
serum (both free evinacumab, and evinacumab bound to 1 or 2 molecules of ANGPTL3), validation 
report REGN1500-AV-13001. The LLOQ of the assay is 78 ng/mL in neat human serum. Total 
evinacumab concentration is stable in human serum for at least 24 months at -20°C and at least 24 
months at -80°C.
In study R1500-CL-1719, a total of 55 of the 57 plates met the run acceptance criteria. The two 
failed runs indicated that the percent of analyte recovery did not meet the assay specification for the 
QC samples. No incurred sample reanalysis of samples was performed in this study.  
In study R1500-CL-17100, a total of 10 of the 12 plates met the run acceptance criteria. The two 
failed runs indicated that the percent of analyte recovery did not meet the assay specification for the 
QC samples. Incurred sample reanalysis of samples (n = 32) was performed in this study with a total 
passing rate of 100%.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 15/103
Total ANGPTL3 concentration in serum 
There were no changes to the analytical methods for determining total AngPTL3 concentrations in 
human serum since the initial marketing authorization application. In short, total AngPTL3 
concentrations in human serum were measured using a qualified ELISA (qualification study 
REGN1500-MX-15060; long-term stability study REGN1500-MX-15070).  The LLOQ of the assay is 
19.5 ng/mL in neat human serum. Total AngPTL3 is stable in human serum for at least 12 months at -
20°C and at least 24 months at -80 °C.
In study R1500-CL-1719, a total of 51 of the 79 plates met the run acceptance criteria. All but one of 
the failed runs indicated that the percent of analyte recovery did not meet the assay specification for 
the QC samples. In addition, one run failed due to the percent of analyte recovery for non-zero 
standard did not meet the assay specification. No incurred sample reanalysis of samples was 
performed.  
In study R1500-CL-17100, a total of 8 of the 9 plates met the run acceptance criteria. One of the 
failed runs indicated that the percent of analyte recovery did not meet the assay specification for the 
QC samples and the analyte recovery for non-zero standards did not meet the assay specification. No 
incurred sample reanalysis of samples was performed.  
Immunogenicity
There were no changes to the analytical methods for determining total evinacumab concentrations in 
human serum since the initial marketing authorization application. In short, a validated, titer-based, 
bridging immunoassay (validation report: R1500-AV-18078) was used to detect anti-drug antibodies 
(ADA) in human serum samples. The bridging assay procedure uses biotinylated evinacumab (Bio-
REGN1500) and ruthenium-labeled evinacumab (Ru-REGN1500) as the bridge components. The ADA 
method uses a floating cut point to determine positive responses in serum samples and involves a 3-
tiered approach: an initial screen to identify samples that are potentially positive for ADA, a 
confirmation step to determine whether positive responses in the screening assay can be inhibited by 
the presence of excess drug, and a titer procedure to assess the level of ADA in confirmed positive 
samples. The sensitivity of the assay in neat serum is 1.8 ng/mL of the monoclonal antibody positive 
control (REGN2092). The drug tolerance limit (DTL) in neat serum is 1366 μg/mL of evinacumab with 
250 ng/mL of REGN2092. 
In study R1500-CL-1719, all 33 plates run in the ADA assay met the run acceptance criteria. The cut 
points in the ADA assay were determined using baseline (treatment-naïve) samples from patients with 
elevated levels of triglycerides (150-500 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (≥100 mg/dL). 
Based on the screening cut point factor (CF) from this population, the observed screening positivity 
rate for baseline serum samples from participants in this study was 10%. In this study, a total of 2 
patients (1 Adolescent patient each in the New Evinacumab and Continue Evinacumab groups) had a 
transient, treatment emergent ADA response with titer of 50. A total of 4 patients (1 Adolescent and 1 
Adult patient in the New Evinacumab group, and 1 Adolescent and 1 Adult patient in the Continue 
Evinacumab group) tested positive for Neutralising antibodies (NAbs). In 3 of the 4 patients, Nabs 
were detected post-baseline; in the remaining patient, baseline data was not available. 
In study R1500-CL-17100, a total of 4 of the 4 plates met the run acceptance criteria. The cut points 
in the ADA assay were determined using baseline (treatment-naïve) samples from patients with 
elevated levels of triglycerides (150-500 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (≥100 mg/dL). 
Based on the screening cut point factor (CF) from this population, the observed screening positivity 
rate for baseline (treatment-naïve) serum samples from this study was 20.0%. In this study, 1 patient 
in Part B developed treatment emergent ADAs of low titer. Two other patients tested positive for pre-
existing ADAs. In the patient with treatment emergent ADAs, results of Nab testing were negative.

Population pharmacokinetic (and pharmacodynamic) model (R1500-PK-22070-SR-01V1)
Objectives
Evinacumab pharmacokinetic data in paediatrics from 5 to 11 years of age with HoFH from Study 
R1500-CL-17100 (n=20) was analysed using the previously developed population pharmacokinetic 
model (R1500-PK-19139-SR-01V1), which was already assessed and described in the initial 
marketing application for evinacumab. The primary objectives of the current population 
pharmacokinetic analysis were to:

Assess the adequacy of the existing evinacumab adult population pharmacokinetic
model in describing evinacumab pharmacokinetics in paediatric patients (age 5 to 11
years) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) from Part A and Part B
of Study R1500-CL-17100.
 Generate individual steady-state exposure metrics based on empirical Bayesian estimates
for paediatric HoFH patients and compare exposure predictions between paediatric and
adult HoFH patients.
Data
The dataset for Study R1500-CL-17100 in paediatric patients (age 5 to 11 years) with homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) described pharmacokinetic sample concentrations, dates and 
times, dose amounts with associated dates and times, and patient demographics and covariates. This 
study evaluated single dose 15 mg/kg IV (Part A) and 15 mg/kg Q4W (Part B). The data from R1500-
CL-17100 was appended to the original Master Dataset, which included 6 evinacumab studies in 
healthy adults and adults and adolescents with HoFH (Studies R1500-HV-1214, R1500-CL-1321, 
R1500-CL-1331, R1500-CL-1629, R1500-CL-1642, and R1500-CL-1719). However, subsequent 
to the original population PK model development for evinacumab (Report R1500-PK-19139-SR-
01V1), it was noted that 488 quantifiable pharmacokinetic samples (i.e., concentrations > 0.078 
mg/L) from Study R1500-CL-1642 had been mislabelled as below the lower limit of quantification 
(BLQ) in the original dataset. These concentrations were corrected by removing the BLQ flag in the 
original dataset, which will be termed the corrected dataset. 
Methods
The population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using NONMEM version 7.4.1 (ICON 
Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Maryland) using the Monte-Carlo importance sampling assisted by 
mode a posteriori (IMPMAP) method. As the previous population pharmacokinetic model, submitted 
during initial marketing application, was only fitted without the mis-labelled data, this previous model 
was re-fitted to a dataset including the mis-labelled data (without paediatric data from Study R1500-
CL-17100). 
Final model
As the model submitted during the initial marketing analysis formed the basis of the modelling 
analyses in the current procedure, the model will be briefly described below. In short, a two-
compartment model disposition model with IV infusion into the central compartment or first-order SC 
absorption with dual linear and saturable (Michaelis-Menten) elimination was developed with 
evinacumab concentration data from healthy adults and adolescents and adults with HoFH. Baseline 
weight, AngPTL3, and disease state were covariates on Volume of distribution and clearance (weight), 
and Vmax (AngPTL3, disease state). Inter-individual variability was included on the absorption 
parameters (lagtime and absorption rate constant) and on clearance and volume of distribution of the 
central compartment.

Model comparison
A comparison of parameter estimates from the existing model (Run 165) and re-estimation of model 
parameters with the additional 488 quantifiable samples is provided in Table 3. The re-estimation of 
Run 165 with the updated dataset was largely consistent with the original population pharmacokinetic 
model (Report R1500-PK-19139-SR-01V1); only Km, intercompartmental rate constants (K23, K32) 
and extent to which the disease state affects nonlinear elimination had > 20% percent change, and 
linear clearance and central volume changed by < 5% from the original model.

Objectives
The objectives of this analysis were to:

Assess the adequacy of the existing population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of evinacumab in 
describing evinacumab PK in paediatric patients with HoFH ≥5 years of age enrolled in Studies 
R1500-CL-17100 and R1500-CL-1719
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 18/103

Refine the existing population PK model using the pooled data from Study R1500-CL-17100 
in paediatric (5 to <12 years old) patients and the adolescent and adult Studies R1500-HV-
1214, R1500-CL-1321, R1500-CL-1642, R1500-CL-1331, R1500-CL-1629, and R1500-
CL-1719.

Refine the existing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model of evinacumab effect on 
low- density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using the pooled data from Study R1500-CL-
17100 in paediatric (5 to <12 years old) patients and the adolescent and adult Studies 
R1500-CL-1331, R1500-CL-1629, and R1500-CL-1719

Predict the evinacumab PK and associated LDL-C reduction in a large virtual population of 
paediatric (5 to <12 years old), adolescent (12 to <18 years old) and adult (≥18 years old) 
patients with HoFH using model-based simulations and compare these predicted metrics 
across age and body weight categories
Data
The creation of the master dataset and the derived analysis dataset, data exploration, model 
diagnostics, and presentations in graphical and tabular outputs was performed using R version 4.2.1 (R 
Core Team, 2022).
For the purpose of the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the master dataset including all data from 
all 7 studies (studies R1500-HV-1214, R1500-CL-1321, R1500-CL-1331, R1500-CL-1629, 
R1500-CL-1642, R1500-CL-1719, and R1500-CL-17100) was subset by excluding LDL-C 
concentration records, total alirocumab concentration records, total PCSK9 concentration records, total 
ANGPTL3 concentration records (baseline ANGPTL3 concentrations were kept as a covariate), apheresis 
records (for most models), data collected from Part C of the ongoing Study R1500-CL-17100, and 
evinacumab concentration records collected prior to the 1st active dose. Evinacumab concentration 
records collected after dose records for which the amount was imputed were excluded from the PK 
analysis.
For the purpose of the PK/PD analysis, the master dataset was subset by excluding total evinacumab 
concentration records, total alirocumab concentration records, total PCSK9 concentration records, total 
ANGPTL3 concentration records (baseline ANGPTL3 concentrations were kept as a covariate), apheresis 
records (in some models only), data collected from Part C of the ongoing Study R1500-CL-17100, 
LDL-C concentration records collected after dose records for which the amount was imputed, and LDL-
C records associated with an absolute value of the conditional weighted residual (CWRES)>5. 
For PK and LDL-C observations with unknown or missing sampling information, the information on 
sample label or in pre-defined protocol was used. If a dose amount was missing, the administered dose 
was calculated. A likelihood-based approach (M3) was used to handle data below the lower limit of 
quantification, consistent with the previous population pharmacokinetic model. The dataset for final 
population pharmacokinetic modelling included a total of 322 unique participants with at least one 
quantifiable sample and 5698 post-dose records, including 5085 quantifiable samples and 613 samples 
that were BLQ. A total of 10.8% of the post-dose samples were BLQ. The dataset for the final PK/PD 
modelling included a total of 3316 LDL-C measurements and 139 unique participants with at least one 
LDL-C measurement. None of the LDL-C measurements were BLQ.
Methods
Population modelling was performed by nonlinear mixed-effects analyses using NONMEM version 7.5.0, 
accessed through the front-end application (Perl-speaks-NONMEM version 4.6.0). Model-based 
simulations were conducted using the mrgsolve R package version 1.0.6.
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 19/103
Evinacumab PK in healthy adults and paediatric (≥ 5 years of age) and adult patients with HoFH
was previously described by a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption after SC dosing
and with dual linear and saturable (Michaelis-Menten) elimination (R1500-PK-22070-SR-01V1). 
Baseline body weight, ANGPTL3 concentration, and disease status were identified as significant 
predictors of variability in evinacumab PK: clearance and volume of distribution of the central 
compartment were both predicted to increase with increasing body weight according to power 
relationships. Vmax was predicted to be 25.1% lower in patients with HoFH compared to healthy 
participants and increased with increasing baseline ANGPTL3 concentrations according to relatively 
shallow power relationship (R1500-PK-22070-SR-01V1) (R1500-PK-19141-SR-01V1). This 
existing population model was evaluated on its ability to adequately capture the evinacumab 
concentration data newly introduced in the current PK dataset using visual predictive checks (VPCs). 
The existing PK model was then re-estimated and refined using the current PK analysis dataset. 
The effect of evinacumab on LDL-C reduction in adolescent (≥ 12 years of age) and adult
patients with HoFH was previously described by an indirect response model in which
evinacumab concentrations inhibit the production of LDL-C according to a saturable (Michaelis-Menten) 
relationship (R1500-PK-19141-SR-01V1). LDL-C concentrations were calculated using the 
Friedewald formula (Friedewald et al., 1972) or, if triglyceride values exceeded 400 mg/dL or if 
calculated LDL-C values were below 25 mg/dL, LDL-C was measured via the beta quantification 
method. A sequential approach was applied for the development of the population PK/PD model of 
evinacumab effect on LDL-C reduction, by which the PD parameters of the model were estimated while 
the structure and individual parameter of the PK model were fixed to the Bayesian estimates obtained 
from the final PK model. To allow the evaluation of the existing PK/PD model in paediatric patients, the 
covariate effects (race as additive on logit scale and linear effect of bodyweight on logit scale) on Imax 
were first re-parameterized on the logit scale to ensure that Imax remains between 0 and 1. If the re-
estimated model was deemed adequate, the effects of age on Imax and IC50 were to be assessed in a 
limited covariate analysis. 
Model development
The evaluation of the existing population pharmacokinetic model by VPC was not provided. However, 
successful convergence could not be achieved when re-estimating the model parameters using FOCEI. 
Similarly, re-estimation of the model using IMPMAP resulted in highly correlated estimates of the first-
order rates of distribution from the central to peripheral compartments (K23) and from the peripheral 
to central compartments (K32). This issue was resolved by changing the model parameterisation and 
estimating a distribution clearance (Q) and volume of peripheral compartment (VP). Additional 
refinements included the use of time-varying body weight to drive allometric scaling of disposition 
parameters and the allometric scaling of Q and VP, in anticipation of model extrapolation to younger 
populations in subsequent analysis. The effects of age on CL, VC, and Vmax were evaluated 
separately. In all cases, the 90% CI associated with the estimates included 0, suggesting that age had 
no effect on the tested parameters within the age range available in the data. Covariate effects 
included in the existing population PK model were retained. 
Convergence of the re-parameterized PK/PD model could not be achieved. Therefore, the PK/PD model 
was refined. Baseline LDL-C concentrations were estimated rather than fixed to observed values. Given 
that lipid apheresis is a key intervention to reduce LDL-C concentrations in patients with HoFH, its 
effect was also estimated as an additional time-varying elimination process. The statistical significance 
of the covariate effects retained from the existing PK/PD model was re-assessed in a limited backward 
elimination process. Both effects of observed baseline LDL-C concentration and racial classification on 
Imax did not reach the pre-defined level of statistical significance (𝛼 = 0.001, or a change of 10.83-
point difference in objective function for 1 degree of freedom) and were removed from the model. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 20/103
Furthermore, the effects of age on baseline LDL, Imax, IC50 and Kin were evaluated. Age was found to 
be a significant covariate on baseline LDL. 
Final models
The final population PK model for evinacumab SC and IV administration in healthy participants and 
patients with HoFH was a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption after SC dosing and with 
dual linear and saturable (Michaelis-Menten) elimination. The disposition parameters CL, VC, Q, and VP 
were allometrically scaled on time-varying body weight, while Vmax was dependent on baseline 
ANGPTL3 concentrations and differed in patients with HoFH compared to healthy participants. The 
parameter estimates for the final population PK model, along with the bootstrap median and 95% CI, 
are provided in Table 4. Parameters were well estimated with RSE ≤ 23% for all structural parameters, 
except the allometric exponent on Q (%RSE = 34.2%), and %RSE ≤ 28.1% for IIV parameters. The 
magnitude of IIV was modest for CL (27.4% CV) and VC (37.5% CV) and large for the first-order rate 
of absorption (ka, 86% CV) and absorption lag time (ALAG1, 175% CV) after SC dosing. Shrinkage in 
IIV was small for CL (16.4%), VC (10.6%), ka (3.07%), ALAG1 (13.5%). VPC plots for the final 
population pharmacokinetic model for studies R1500-CL-17100 and R1500-CL-1719 are shown in 
Figure 2. p(v)cVPC plot for the final population pharmacokinetic model in paediatrics aged 5 to 12

The final population PK/PD model for evinacumab effects on LDL-C concentrations in patients with 
HoFH was an indirect response model in which evinacumab concentrations inhibits the production of 
LDL-C according to a saturable (Michaelis-Menten) relationship, and which included a second
elimination pathway driven by apheresis treatment. The overall PK/PD model structure is displayed in 
Figure 44. 
Figure 4 Final PK/PD model structure.

Page 24/103
The PK/PD model included two covariates (i.e. increasing age was associated with a decrease in 
baseline LDL-C concentration and increasing body weight was associated with decrease in the 
maximum inhibitory effect of evinacumab). The parameter estimates for the final population PK/PD 
model are provided in 
Table 5 and VPC plots for the final popPK/PD model for studies R1500-CL-17100 and R1500-CL-
1719 are shown in Figure 55. 
Parameters were well estimated with %RSE ≤ 36.1% for all structural parameters and %RSE ≤ 37.3% 
for IIV parameters. The magnitude of IIV was moderate for LDLC0 (53.7% CV) and Imax (30% CV for 
a 72-kg individual) and kin (54.5% CV). Shrinkage in IIV was for baseline LDL 4.4%, for Imax 16.7%, 
and for kin 44.2%.

Model application
Model parameter estimates from the final PK and PK/PD models were used to predict evinacumab 
concentrations and the percentage of reduction in LDL-C from baseline (%ΔLDL-C) in patients with 
HoFH receiving 10 consecutive 15 mg/kg evinacumab infusions every 4 weeks (Q4W). 
Deterministic simulations using the population parameter estimates were conducted in prototypical 
individuals, to explore the magnitude of statistically significant covariate effects on evinacumab 
exposures at steady-state and on %ΔLDL-C at Week 24 relative to a typical patient, and to explore the 
effect of age on exposures and %ΔLDL-C following evinacumab and/or apheresis treatment. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 26/103
Evinacumab exposures after 10 consecutive evinacumab infusions and %ΔLDL-C at Week 24 were also 
predicted and summarized by age and body weight groups, using the individual post-hoc EBEs 
obtained in the patients included in the analysis dataset (15 mg/kg Q4W), or using model-based 
estimates (15 and 20 mg/kg Q4W) in a population of 1000 virtual paediatric, 1000 virtual adolescent 
and 1000 virtual adult patients with HoFH generated by random sampling. Simulations were performed 
under the assumption that apheresis treatments were received at frequencies and in proportions of the 
simulation population that were representative of those observed in the analysis population. 
Pharmacokinetics in adult population
After updating the population PK model by correcting the mis-labelled data from study R1500-CL-
1642 and adding additional data (i.e. studies R1500-CL-17100 and R1500-CL-1719), model 
parameters were re-estimated. This resulted in some changes in the SmPC section 5.2 (absorption, 
distribution and elimination sections), which also concern the description of the pharmacokinetics in 
adults. These differences are summarised below and briefly discussed. 
Absorption
The mean predicted Cmin, Cmax, AUCtau at steady state (after 10 doses of 15 mg/kg Q4W) in adult 
patients with HoFH are 230 (±81.3) mg/L, 681 (± 185.0) mg/L and 10100 (± 2720) mg.day/L, 
respectively. 
The accumulation ratio based on the predicted mean Cmin at week 40 in adult patients with HoFH was 
estimated in the population pharmacokinetic analysis at approximately 2.6 (± 0.4). 
Distribution
Based on the updated population pharmacokinetic model, the volume of distribution was found to be 
4.9 L in a typical individual weighing 72 kg (the central volume of distribution was 2.8 L and peripheral 
volume of distribution was 2.1 L).
Elimination
PopPK analysis for patients with HoFH showed that after repeated doses of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W, the 
median time for evinacumab to decrease below the lower limit of quantitation was approximately 20 
weeks overall across the age groups. 
Pharmacokinetics in paediatric population 
Evinacumab exposure and its corresponding effect on LDL-C were characterised in paediatric patients 
with HoFH (age 5 to 11 years) in the phase 1b/3 study R1500-CL-17100 following a single 15 mg/kg 
IV infusion (Part A) and during multiple 15 mg/kg Q4W IV infusions (Part B), and were subsequently 
compared to adolescent and adult data using population PK and PK/PD modelling. The study is still 
ongoing (Part C), which consists of a 48-week treatment period and 24-week follow-up period of

In total, 20 paediatric patients aged 5 to 11 years, mean age of 9 (± 1.8), bodyweight of 38 (± 13.1) 
kg and AngPTL3 of 0.075 (± 0.031) mg/L. A comparison with adolescent and adult patients, based on 
the data included in the second population pharmacokinetic model (R1500-PM-23041-SR-01V1), is

The influence of covariates weight and age on the pharmacokinetics of evinacumab was evaluated 
using population pharmacokinetic model (R1500-PM-23041-SR-01V1). Post-hoc estimates of Cmin, 
Cmax, and AUC0-tau at first dose and at steady-state were presented for patients with HoFH in Table 7. 
Evinacumab exposures after 15 mg/kg IV infusions were predicted to be lower in younger patients and 
patients with a lower body weight. The mean predicted values of AUC at steady state (after 10 doses) 
were 7020, 8650, and 10100 mg.day/L in patients between 5 and <12 years of age, between 12 to 
<18 years of age, and above 18 years of age, respectively.

Immunogenicity
In the ongoing phase 3 study R1500-CL-17100, 1 patient in Part B developed treatment emergent 
ADAs of low titer. Two other patients tested positive for pre-existing ADAs. In the patient with 
treatment emergent ADAs, results of NAb testing were negative. There was no apparent effect of ADA 
on the pharmacokinetics of evinacumab or the LDL-C response profile in this patient.
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics
Mechanism of action
Evinacumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds to and inhibits 
angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL3). ANGPTL3 is an angiopoietin-like protein that is expressed 
primarily in the liver and plays an important role in the regulation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting 
lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 30/103
In genetic studies in humans, individuals with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in ANGPTL3 had lower 
levels of LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) and reduced risk 
of coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to individuals without these mutations. 
Evinacumab reduces LDL-C independent of the presence of LDL receptor (LDLR) by promoting very 
low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) processing and clearance upstream of LDL formation. Evinacumab 
blockade of ANGPTL3 lowers TG and HDL-C by rescuing LPL and EL activities, respectively.
Primary and secondary pharmacology
Total ANGPTL3
When evinacumab is administered and is in excess of free ANGPTL3, the newly formed free target is 
rapidly complexed and ANGPTL3 primarily circulates in the complex form. With the slower elimination 
of the ANGPTL3-evinacumab complex relative to the formation of ANGPTL3 evinacumab complex, the 
concentrations of total ANGPTL3 increase from baseline.
In the phase1b/3 study R1500-CL-17100, following single dose administration of evinacumab 15 
mg/kg IV in the 6 patients in Part A (5 who received apheresis), concentration-time profiles of total 
ANGPTL3 demonstrated the formation of a slowly eliminated complex between evinacumab and its 
target, ANGPTL3 (Figure 7). The concentration of ANGPTL3 increased in the 2 weeks following 
evinacumab administration and declined slowly back to baseline thereafter.

with HoFH Administered a Single Dose of Evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV in Part A (Study R1500-CL-17100)
Following multiple-dose administration of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV in the 14 patients in Part B (7 who 
received apheresis), the concentration-time profiles of ANGPTL3 showed that mean ANGPTL3 
concentrations tended to increase over time with notable increases between pre- and post-dose time 
points on each evinacumab administration until approximately week 12, commensurate with the 
accumulation and the time to achieve steady-state of evinacumab (Figure 8). 
The ANGPTL3 concentrations during evinacumab treatment tended to be lower among the 7 patients in 
Part B who underwent apheresis compared with patients who did not undergo apheresis (Figure 9).

LDL-C
In study R1500-CL-17100, LDL-C concentrations decreased after a single 15 mg/kg IV administration 
of evinacumab in Part A, and 15 mg/kg Q4W evinacumab administration in Part B showed treatment-
related decrease in LDL-C concentrations. For Part A, LDL-C decreased following the single dose IV 
administration and returned to baseline levels by Week 12 as the evinacumab concentrations 
approached below the limit of quantification (BLQ). For Part B, LDL-C decreases were near-maximal by 
week 4 and means did not change markedly throughout the rest of the treatment period even though 
mean evinacumab concentrations continued to increase until achievement of steady-state (ie, up to 
weeks 8 to 12) (Figure 10).

Immunogenicity
One patient demonstrated a treatment-emergent ADA response which was low-titer and observed 
during Q4W dosing in Part B. The LDL-C response profiles of the ADA-positive patients lay within the 
distribution of the LDL-C response profiles of ADA-negative patients, suggesting that the positive ADA 
results did not affect the LDL-C responses for this patient. Similar trends were apparent in 
corresponding plots for change from baseline in ApoB, non-HDL-C, and Lp(a).
2.4.4.  PK/PD modelling
The relationship between evinacumab pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (LDL-C lowering) was 
evaluated in the population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis. 
Observed baseline LDL-C concentration was higher in paediatric patients compared to adolescent, and 
adult patients (Table 6). In the final PK/PD model, age was identified as a statistically significant 
descriptor on baseline LDL (LDL0 parameter) resulting in a higher baseline LDL-C concentration in 
patients with a lower age.
Despite these lower exposures, the predicted magnitude of LDL-C reduction was maintained and 
appeared even larger in paediatrics and adolescents compared to adults. Simulation based upon post-
hoc Bayesian estimates predicted median values of the percent change (reduction) from baseline in 
LDL-C at Week 24 of 67.9%, 59.6%, and 56% in patients ≥5 to <12 years of age, ≥12 to <18 years 
of age, and ≥18 years of age, respectively (Figure 11 and Table PK8).

2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of evinacumab in paediatric patients have been appropriately evaluated using 
population pharmacokinetic models. The first population pharmacokinetic analysis was not deemed fit 
for purpose as it was discovered during the analysis that 488 quantifiable pharmacokinetic samples 
(i.e., concentrations > 0.078 mg/L) from Study R1500-CL-1642 had been mislabelled as below the 
lower limit of quantification (BLQ) in the original dataset that formed the basis of the population 
pharmacokinetic model submitted at initial marketing application. This update and comparison of 
pharmacokinetics between paediatrics, adolescents and adults was therefore based on the second 
population pharmacokinetic analysis (R1500-PM-23041-SR-01V1). Additional p(v)cVPCs of the 
studies stratified by age group (i.e. aged 5 to 12 years, 12 to 18 years, and >18 years) were provided 
by the Applicant. These diagnostic plots indicate that the model is appropriate to characterise the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 36/103
typical evinacumab pharmacokinetic profile over the paediatric age range (5 years and over) and adult 
patients. Overall, the final model is considered to describe the paediatric data sufficiently well. 
The absorption, distribution and elimination sub-sections of section 5.2 of the SmPC were updated 
based on the submitted second population pharmacokinetic model (R1500-PM-23041-SR-01V1), 
which is appropriate. 
Pharmacodynamics
Evinacumab has a proposed new mechanism of action. It is a human monoclonal antibody against 
angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), which play a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism by 
inhibiting lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL). This would lead to a reduction in LDL-C; 
independent of the presence of an LDL receptor, by promoting very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) 
processing and clearance, thereby reducing the VLDL pool available to generate LDL. Although the 
mechanism is not completely understood, based on more recent studies, it is hypothesized that 
especially endothelial lipase (EL) rather than LPL plays a more crucial role in the reduction of LDL-C via 
VLDL processing. Further, it is not known how evinacumab influences HDL-C function as a consequence 
of lowering of HDL-C and alteration of the homeostasis of other lipid parameters, especially in the 
setting of extremely elevated LDL-C levels as presented by the HoFH phenotype. Any potential for liver 
fat accumulation seems unlikely, as studies suggest no role of evinacumab in the VLDL processing in 
the liver.
Total ANGPTL3 was used as target engagement marker, whereas LDL-C is the main lipid parameters 
used to assess the pharmacodynamics of evinacumab.
Effects on ANGPTL3 and LDL-C have been characterized following a single 15 mg/kg IV infusion (Part 
A) and during multiple 15 mg/kg Q4W IV infusions (Part B) in paediatric patients with HoFH aged 5-≤ 
11 years in the phase 1b/3 study R1500-CL-17100. A single dose administration of evinacumab 15 
mg/kg IV in the 6 patients with HoFH aged 5-≤ 11 years in Part A (5 who received apheresis) resulted 
in increases in total ANGPTL3 up to week 2 after which total ANGPTL3 declined slowly back to baseline. 
Multiple-dose administrations of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV in the 14 paediatric patients with HoFH aged 
5-≤ 11 years in Part B (7 who received apheresis) resulted in an increase in total ANGPTL3 over time 
with notable increase between pre- and post-dose time points until ~ week 12, i.e. the time to achieve 
steady state. Further, ANGPTL3 concentrations during evinacumab treatment were lower in patients 
who underwent apheresis compared with patients who did not undergo apheresis. 
Regarding the PD parameter LDL-C, multiple doses of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV in the 14 paediatric 
patients with HoFH aged 5-≤ 11 years in Part B in study R1500-CL-17100, resulted in near-maximal 
LDL-C decreases by Week 4 of ~40% even though mean evinacumab concentrations continued to 
increase until achievement of steady-state (i.e. up to weeks 12) (see also efficacy section). 
Further, a low incidence of anti-drug antibody has been observed (n=1 in study R1500-CL-17100), 
which was low-titer and did not affect the LDL-C response. 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (LDL-C reduction) relationship of evinacumab in paediatric 
patients has been sufficiently evaluated. VPCs of the studies R1500 CL 1719 and R1500 CL 17100 
are considered acceptable, even though the final model slightly overestimates the mean observed LDL-
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 37/103
C concentrations and its variability in paediatrics (study R1500 CL 17100 part B). Overall, the final 
model is considered to describe the paediatric data sufficiently well.
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
To support the extension of the therapeutic indication for evinacumab to include paediatric patients 
aged 5 years to <12 years with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), interim results 
from paediatric Study R1500-CL-17100 and supportive updated interim data for adolescents and 
adults from Study R1500-CL-1719 were provided and assessed in an extrapolation analysis (including 
population pharmacokinetic, population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, and simulations 
analyses). The analysis was a partial extrapolation of efficacy, as both pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic (LDL-C) samples were obtained in the population aged 5 years and older.
Pharmacokinetics
The results of the population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrate that the overall plasma exposure 
in paediatric patients of 5-12 years is approximately 30% lower compared to adult patients, which is 
most likely explained by the lower bodyweight in the paediatric population. Immunogenicity results in 
the paediatric population are limited, but indicate no clinical impact. 
Pharmacodynamics
Similar to the adult population, the proof of concept of evinacumab in inhibition of ANGPTL3, as 
measured by an increase in total ANGPTL3, and the subsequent decrease in LDL-C has sufficiently 
been demonstrated in the paediatric population. 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
The results of the population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling 
demonstrate that the plasma exposure in paediatric patients is slightly lower compared to adolescent 
and adult patients. However, it can be concluded that the LDL-C reduction is higher in paediatric 
patients. The difference can most likely not be explained by differences in target saturation between 
populations throughout the treatment period, but is more likely explained by differences in disease 
severity between paediatric, adolescent and adult patients. Therefore, it can be concluded that the 15 
mg/kg dose is also suitable for paediatric patients. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy
The initial marketing authorization of evinacumab for the treatment of HoFH in adult and adolescent 
patients aged 12 years and older was based on data from R1500-CL-1629, a pivotal Phase 3, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study in adult and adolescent patients (12 to <18 years) with HoFH, with a 
24-week double-blind treatment period (DBTP), in a background of other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g. 
statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies, lomitapide, and lipoprotein apheresis), and a 24-week 
Open-label Treatment Period (OLTP). The study was further supported by several other studies, 
including early data from an ongoing long-term, open-label safety and efficacy extension study in 
patients with HoFH (R1500-CL-1719). Adolescent patients were included in the pivotal phase 3 study 
(R1500-CL-1629) as well as in the open-label extension study (R1500-CL-1719) due to the high unmet 
medical need in this patient group.
The current extension of indication application is based on interim data from Study R1500-CL-17100, 
an ongoing Phase 1b/3 single-arm, open-label study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of evinacumab in paediatric (≥5 to <12 years) patients with HoFH, as well as supportive 
information from a recent updated interim analysis of the ongoing open-label extension study, R1500-

2.5.1.  Extrapolation concept
To support use of evinacumab in patients ≥5 to <12 years of age with HoFH, an extrapolation analysis 
(including population pharmacokinetics [PK], population PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) [population 
PK/PD], and simulations analyses) has been conducted. 
There are several considerations that justify the overall approach to extrapolate data from adults as 
outlined in outlined in the CHMP “Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of 
medicines for paediatrics” (EMA/189724/2018) and the draft “ICH guideline E11A on paediatric 
extrapolation” (EMA/CHMP/ICH/205218/2022).
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 39/103
Development of a paediatric extrapolation concept requires an understanding of the factors that 
influence the similarity of disease, the pharmacology of the drug and the response to therapy as well 
as the safety of use in all the relevant populations.
Disease similarity
HoFH is an ultra-rare and serious genetic condition, which requires early diagnosis and treatment 
beginning in infancy for the best outcomes. The aetiology of the hypercholesterolemia observed in 
patients with HoFH is the same for both adult and paediatric patients. Hypercholesterolemia is a 
consequence of the abnormal lipoprotein metabolism due to mutations in the key genes, mutations in 
the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene and less frequently by mutations in the proprotein 
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and LDL receptor adaptor 
protein 1 (LDLRAP1) genes, and the markedly diminished hepatic LDL-C clearance from plasma. 
Additional phenotypic characteristics include premature CVD, aortic valve disease, and tendon 
xanthomas in the hands and Achilles’ tendons.
As the aetiology of HoFH is the same for both adult and paediatric patients, the overarching goal of 
therapy is also the same, to lower LDL-C, and subsequently the risk of ASCVD:

The EAS/European Society of Cardiology (ESC 2014) consensus panel on FH recommends initiation 
of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with HoFH as soon as possible after diagnosis, with the goal of 
reducing LDL-C levels to <2.5 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) in adults or <3.5 mmol/L (<135mg/dL) in 
children or <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in adults with clinical ACVD (Cuchel et al., 2014; Wiegman et 
al., 2015). 

The ESC/EAS Consensus panel recommends that in patients with FH and at very high risk, an LDL-
C reduction of at least 50% from baseline and an LDL-C goal of  <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL) is 
recommended (Mach et al., 2020). 
In the same guideline, in children, testing for HF is recommended from the age of 5 or earlier if 
HoFH is suspected. Children with FH should be educated to adopt a proper diet and treated with a 
statin from 8-10 years of age. Goals for treatment should be LDL-C < 3.5 mmol/L (<135 mg/dL) at 
> 10 years of age.

2.5.2.  Dose response study(ies)
The collective results from the aforementioned phase 1 studies in healthy participants (R1500-HV-
1214, R1500-CL-1321, and R1500-CL-1642) as well as phase 2 (R1500-CL-1331) and phase 3 
(R1500-CL-1629 and R1500-CL-1719) studies in adult and adolescent patients with HoFH were used to 
inform the paediatric clinical pharmacology program for evinacumab. The objectives of the paediatric 
clinical pharmacology program were to select the appropriate dose regimen for paediatric patients with 
HoFH (aged ≥5 to <12 years) and to characterize the total evinacumab serum PK, the total ANGPTL3 
serum concentrations, as a measure of target engagement, and the immunogenicity potential of 
evinacumab in these patients. In Part A of Study R1500-CL-17100, paediatric patients with HoFH were 
administered a single dose of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV. The PK data from Part A were analyzed and 
evaluated in concert with the data from adults and adolescents using population PK methods which 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 40/103
confirmed that the 15 mg/kg dose in paediatric patients was comparable to the EMA approved dose in 
the adult and adolescent populations studied. In Part A, the mean percent LDL C reductions at Week 4 
after single-dose evinacumab was approximately -26.0%. Based on these analyses, a dose of 15 
mg/kg IV Q4W was selected for Part B of study R1500-CL-17100 wherein patients received multiple 
doses of evinacumab over 24 weeks. In Part B, the mean percent LDL C reductions at Week 4 after 
single-dose evinacumab administration was approximately -38.3%, which was consistent with the 
percent LDL-C reductions at Week 4 previously reported for adults from Study R1500-CL-1331 
(approximately -30.1%) and adults and adolescents from the double-blind treatment period (DBTP) of 
Study R1500-CL-1629 (approximately -39.6%). Multiple dose administration of evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
IV Q4W over 24 weeks in the paediatric population resulted in lower steady-state evinacumab 
concentrations relative to those observed in the adult population. Despite these lower exposures, at 24 
weeks, the 48.3% LDL-C reduction in the paediatric population was comparable to the 47.1% LDL C 
reduction observed in the adult and adolescent population in the DBTP of Study R1500 CL-1629, 
suggesting that the steady-state evinacumab concentrations in paediatric patients were sufficient to 
achieve maximal target engagement.
Based on the clinically and statistically meaningful reduction in LDL-C comparable to that observed in 
the adult and adolescent populations with HoFH, together with PK and ANGPTL3 data, the dose 
regimen of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W was confirmed for this paediatric population. 
Multiple model-based simulations were performed to predict and compare evinacumab exposures and 
LDL-C lowering effects in paediatric, adolescent, and adult patients with HoFH at the clinically relevant 
dosing regimen of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W. Results based upon typical estimates in prototypical individuals, 
post-hoc Bayesian estimates in the patients with HoFH included in the PK/PD analysis dataset, or the 
model predicted variability in a large population of virtual paediatric and adult patients consistently 
indicated that, although evinacumab exposures were lower in paediatric patients than in adult patients, 
similar or greater magnitudes of LDL-C reduction from baseline could be achieved in younger patients 
at the same mg/kg dose. Simulations based upon post-hoc Bayesian estimates predicted median 
values of percent change (reduction) from baseline in LDL-C at Week 24 of 67.9%, 59.6%, and 56% in 
patients ≥5 to <12 years of age, ≥12 to <18 years of age, and ≥18 years of age, respectively.
Similarity of treatment response across age groups was also demonstrated using model-based 
simulations to estimate the percentage of patients predicted to achieve LDL-C concentrations <2.8 
mmol/L (or <110 mg/dL) and <3.4 mmol/L (or <130 mg/dL) by Week 24 following 15 mg/kg Q4W 
infusions. The threshold of <3.4 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL) was achieved by more than half of all virtual 
patients in all age and weight groups, despite baseline LDL-C concentrations being higher in the 5 to 
<12 age group (422 mg/dL on average) than in adults (255 mg/dL on average), with the percentage 
of target attainment ranging from 56.4% in patients ≥5 to <12 years of age to 67.4% in adult 
patients. 
2.5.3.  Main study(ies)
Study R1500-CL-17100- A three-part, single-arm, open-label study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of evinacumab in 
paediatric patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia
R1500-CL-17100 is an ongoing 3-part, phase 1b/3 open-label study evaluating evinacumab in a total 
of 20 paediatric patients with HoFH aged ≥5 to <12 years. The study includes Part A (PK/PD), Part B 
(24-week primary efficacy and safety) and Part C (48-week treatment period and 24-week follow-up 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 41/103
period). For Part C, patients who entered a compassionate use program (CUP) or early access program 
(EAP) may forgo the 24-week follow-up period.
Methods
The study is composed of 3 parts:
•
Part A (completed; data cut-off 11 Feb 2011): phase 1b, single arm, single dose (evinacumab 
15 mg/kg IV) PK/PD study in patients (completed) aged 5 to 11 years with HoFH (Figure 12).
Part A consisted of up to 4 periods: run-in (≤ 8 weeks); screening (1-2 weeks); single-dose 
open-label treatment and 16-week observation post drug administration; and a follow-up 
period (for patients who do not enter Part C). Upon completion of Part A, patients had the 
opportunity to continue into Part C.
•
Part B (completed; data cut-off 31 Ja 2022): phase 3, single-arm, 24-week, open-label efficacy 
and safety study of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W in patients age 5 to 11 years with HoFH 
(Figure 13). Patients enrolled into Part B did not include patients from Part A. 
Part B consisted of up to 4 periods: run-in (≤ 8 weeks); screening (1-2 weeks); 24-week 
open-label treatment; follow-up. (Since all patients entered Part C, the follow-up period of Part 
B was not applicable). Upon completion of Part B, all patients continued into Part C.
•
Part C (ongoing; data cut-off 02 June 2022): ongoing phase 3, 48-week treatment period and 
24-week follow-up period of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W in patients who previously 
completed Parts A and B (patients who enter a compassionate use or early access program 
may forgo the 24 week follow-up period)(Figure 14). The first visit (visit 1) in Part C could 
occur on the same day as the EOT visit in Part A (visit 11)/Part B (visit 11).
Following completion of Part A, the PK, LDL-C, and safety data were evaluated in order to determine 
the dose to be used in Parts B and Part C. The dose determined from Part A for use in subsequent 
parts was 15 mg/kg IV Q4W, the same dose approved for patients aged ≥12 years.

Statistical methods
In Study R1500-CL-17000, the endpoints were chosen and analyzed to match those for the adult 
studies. 
The derivations and models were performed with conventional units when statistics are not affected 
from using international and conventional units do not impact the results (e.g. means and least square 
(LS) means for percent changes from baseline, rates of patients below a threshold). For other statistics 
(e.g. descriptive statistics at baseline and over time, absolute changes from baseline), derivations 
were presented in both international and conventional units. 
Results
Treatment with evinacumab in the overall Adolescent Population resulted in an absolute mean (SD) 
and median (Q1:Q3) change from baseline in calculated LDL-C at Week 24 of -4.676 (2.5113) mmol/L 
(-180.5 [96.88] mg/dL) and -4.615 mmol/L (-6.840:-3.470) (−178.0 mg/dL [-264.0:-134.0]). The 
respective mean (SD) and median (Q1:Q3) percent change from baseline at Week 24 in the overall 
Adolescent Population were -55.36% (25.288) and −61.44% (-71.13:-49.96) (n=12) (Table 21). The 
decreases in mean (SD) and median (Q1:Q3) percent change from baseline in LDL-C were greater in 
the New Evinacumab group (-60.32% [11.912] and -61.44% [-69.11:-52.91]) (n=10) compared with 
the Continue Evinacumab group (-30.55% [65.423] and -30.55% [-76.81:15.71]) (n=2) at Week 24, 
with reductions in LDL-C with evinacumab observed as early as the first post-baseline lipid 
measurement at Week 8 in the New Evinacumab group.
The reductions from baseline in LDL-C were maintained through at least Week 88 (mean [SD] and 
median [Q1:Q3] percent change from baseline at Week 88 of −44.95% [39.078] and −57.72% 
[−62.72:−36.14] for the Total Evinacumab group; n=9), after which time the results were more 
variable due to the smaller number of patients contributing to data (1 each from the New and Continue 
Evinacumab groups) (Figure 15).
Changes from baseline in LDL-C were in line with results for the Total Population. Treatment with 
evinacumab in the Total Population resulted in an absolute mean (SD) and median (Q1:Q3) change 
from baseline in calculated LDL-C at Week 24 of -3.419 (3.2217) mmol/L (-132.0 [124.37] mg/dL) and 
-2.365 mmol/L (-5.080:-1.300) (-91.5 mg/dL [-196.0:-50.0]). The respective mean (SD) and median 
(Q1:Q3) percent change from baseline at Week 24 were -43.64% (37.606) and -53.14% (-65.16:-
34.99) (n=86). The reductions from baseline in LDL-C were maintained through at least Week 120 
(mean [SD] and median [Q1:Q3] percent change from baseline at Week 120 of -30.78% [69.693] and 
-49.71% [-64.03:-32.96] for the Total Evinacumab group; n=34), after which time the results were 
more variable.
Within the R1500-CL-1719 Adolescent Population, results of subgroup analysis by sex and race were 
similar to the Total Population. Regarding mutation status, the mean (SD) percent change in LDL-C 
from baseline to Week 88 for the 4 patients (Total Evinacumab group) with a null/null mutation was  
63.25% (9.789). The mean (SD) percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 88 for the 4 patients 
(Total Evinacumab group) with a negative/negative mutation was  22.21% (52.302).

LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; SE, standard error.
Note: Baseline in the Continue Evinacumab group refers to baseline from the parent study R1500-CL-1629. 
Changes from baseline in additional lipid parameters
Treatment with evinacumab resulted in reduction of multiple lipid parameters associated with CV risk 
when co-administered with other lipid-lowering therapies as early as the first post-baseline lipid 
measurement (week 8), with reductions from baseline found for up to at least Week 120 for the Total 
Population, and Week 88 for the Adolescent Population, after which time results were more variable 
(Table 13). 
For both the Total and Adolescent Populations, the results at later time points were more variable, in 
part, due to the smaller number of contributing patients. For the Total Population, the variability of 
results at later time points were also attributed, in part, to patients enrolled from the R1500-CL-1331 
study. The baseline lipid parameter results for some patients enrolling from R1500-CL-1331 were 
confounded by a residual effect of evinacumab treatment from the R1500-CL-1331 study.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
It has to be noted that during the R1500-CL-1629 pivotal study, two adolescent patients underwent 
CCTA to assess atherosclerotic soft plaque progression after treatment with evinacumab. The results 
have been published since the initial authorization of evinacumab (Reeskamp et al., 2021). After 24 
weeks of evinacumab treatment (with concomitant statins, ezetimibe, and apheresis), one of the 
patients showed a 76% reduction in total plaque volume (TPV), from 12.6 ± 8.1 mm3 at baseline to 
3.0 ± 1.5 mm3. Similarly, the other patient showed an 85% reduction in TPV, from 233.5 ± 36.0 mm3 
at baseline to 34.8 ± 19.3 mm3 (Reeskamp et al., 2021)(Figure 16).

2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Based on the initial MAA in 2021, evinacumab (Evkeeza) was indicated as an adjunct to diet and other 
LDL-C lowering therapies for the treatment of adults and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older 
with HoFH. A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances was granted on the basis that 
the indication is encountered so rarely that the MAH cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence. This extension of indication extends the therapeutic indication for Evkeeza to 
include paediatric patients aged 5 years or above, and is based on interim results from an ongoing 
Phase 1b/3 single-arm, open-label study R1500-CL-17100 in paediatric (≥5 to <12 years) patients 
with HoFH, as well as supportive information from an updated interim analysis of an ongoing open-
label study R1500-CL-1719 in adolescent (and adult) patients with HoFH, and an extrapolation analysis 
(including population PK, population PK/PD, and simulation analyses). The paediatric development 
program is in line with the approved PIP (PIP decision number P/0087/2023) as also indicated by the 
partial compliance check by the EMA (EMA/145021/2023). EMA decision dated 16 May 2023: Studies 
R1500-CL-17100 and R1500-CL- 1719 are confirmed to be compliant as set out in the EMA's Decision 
(P/0087/2023) of 10 March 2023.

EMA/576403/2023

Extrapolation plan
To support use of evinacumab in patients ≥5 to <12 years of age with HoFH, an extrapolation analysis 
(including population pharmacokinetics [PK], population PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) [population 
PK/PD], and simulations analyses) has been conducted. 
There are several considerations that justify the overall approach to extrapolate efficacy from adults as 
outlined in outlined in the CHMP “Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of 
medicines for paediatrics” (EMA/189724/2018) and the draft “ICH guideline E11A on paediatric 
extrapolation” (EMA/CHMP/ICH/205218/2022). Development of a paediatric extrapolation concept 
requires an understanding of the factors that influence the similarity of disease, the pharmacology of 
the drug and the response to therapy as well as the safety of use in all the relevant populations. 
Disease similarity
HoFH is an ultra-rare and serious genetic condition, which requires early diagnosis and treatment 
beginning in infancy for the best outcomes. The aetiology of the hypercholesterolemia observed in 
patients with HoFH is the same for both adult and paediatric patients. Hypercholesterolemia is a 
consequence of the abnormal lipoprotein metabolism due to mutations in the key genes, mutations in 
the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene and less frequently by mutations in the proprotein 
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and LDL receptor adaptor protein 
1 (LDLRAP1) genes, and the markedly diminished hepatic LDL-C clearance from plasma. Additional 
phenotypic characteristics include premature CVD, aortic valve disease, and tendon xanthomas in the 
hands and Achilles’ tendons.
As the aetiology of HoFH is the same for both adult and paediatric patients, the overarching goal of 
therapy is also the same, to lower LDL-C, and subsequently the risk of ASCVD:
•
The EAS/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) consensus panel on FH recommends initiation of 
lipid-lowering therapy in patients with HoFH as soon as possible after diagnosis, with the goal of 
reducing  LDL-C levels to <2.5 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) in adults or <3.5 mmol/L (<135mg/dL) in 
children (Cuchel et al., 2014; Wiegman et al., 2015). 
•
The ESC/EAS Consensus panel recommends that in patients with FH and at very high risk, an LDL-
C reduction of at least 50% and an LDL-C goal of  <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL) should be considered 
(Mach et al., 2020). 
Similar drug pharmacology
The extrapolation study showed that patients achieve steady-state evinacumab concentrations that are 
sufficient for maximal ANGPTL3 engagement, resulting in comparable LDL-C reductions across 
paediatric, adolescent, and adult HoFH patients.
In the paediatric population receiving a dosing regimen of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W, PK and PD data 
consistently described a profile consisting of both linear, non-saturable, and non-linear, target 
mediated elimination, consistent with that previously reported for adolescents and adults.
At lower concentrations insufficient to saturate the target-mediated pathway, exposure increased in a 
greater than dose proportional manner. At higher systemic concentrations of evinacumab, sufficient to 
saturate the target-mediated pathway, the PK of evinacumab trended towards a linear and dose-
proportional profile driven by the non-saturable protein catabolism process. Coincident with the 
observation of systemic concentrations sufficient to achieve linear PK, was evidence of maximal target 
engagement, as assessed by total ANGPTL3 concentrations, and a maximal PD effect on lipid 
parameters.
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 53/103
The main source of intrinsic PK variability identified by population PK analysis was body weight. Lower 
body weights (including in paediatric patients) showed a decrease in exposure. Model-based 
simulations based upon post-hoc Bayesian estimates predicted that median steady-state exposures 
were 25% (for Cmin) to 37% (for Cmax) lower in paediatric patients ≥5 to <12 years compared to 
adult patients ≥18 years after 15 mg/kg IV administrations Q4W. Despite lower exposures in 
paediatric patients, comparable LDL C reductions were observed and predicted by the population 
PK/PD model in paediatric, adolescent, and adult populations at week 24, supporting the 15 mg/kg IV 
dosing regimen across these populations.
Baseline ANGPTL3 and disease status (patients with HoFH versus healthy participants) were 
descriptors of the variability in the Vmax of the saturable elimination pathway but had marginal 
influence on evinacumab exposures at clinically relevant doses, due to the pathway saturation. None of 
the other demographic characteristics (age, race, or gender) had a relevant effect on the PK of 
evinacumab.
Similar exposure response
In the paediatric Study R1500-CL-17100 including patients aged ≥5 to <12 years with HoFH, the mean 
percent LDL C reductions at Week 4 after single-dose evinacumab administration in Part A 
(approximately −26.0%) and Part B (approximately −38.3%) were consistent with the percent LDL-C 
reductions at Week 4 previously reported for adults from Study R1500-CL-1331 (approximately 
−30.1%) and adults and adolescents from the DBTP of Study R1500-CL-1629 (approximately 
−39.6%). Multiple dose administration of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W over 24 weeks in the 
paediatric population resulted in lower steady-state evinacumab concentrations relative to those 
observed in the adult population. Despite these lower exposures, at 24 weeks, the 48.3% LDL-C 
reduction in the paediatric population was comparable to the 47.1% LDL C reduction observed in the 
adult and adolescent population in the Study R1500 CL-1629 DBTP, suggesting that the steady-state 
evinacumab concentrations in paediatric patients were sufficient to achieve maximal target 
engagement. 
Similarity of treatment response across age groups was also demonstrated using model-based 
simulations to estimate the percentage of patients predicted to achieve LDL-C concentrations <2.8 
mmol/L (or <110 mg/dL) and <3.4 mmol/L (or <130 mg/dL) by Week 24 following 15 mg/kg Q4W 
infusions. The threshold of <3.4 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL) was achieved by more than half of all virtual 
patients in all age and weight groups, despite baseline LDL-C concentrations being higher in the 5 to 
<12 age group (422 mg/dL on average) than in adults (255 mg/dL on average), with the percentage 
of target attainment ranging from 56.4% in patients ≥5 to <12 years of age to 67.4% in adult 
patients. Regarding safety, evinacumab displays an acceptable safety profile in paediatric HoFH 
patients aged 5-≤ 11 consistent to those observed in adult and adolescent HoFH patients.
Discussion
Similarity of disease, the pharmacology of the drug and the response to therapy as well as the safety 
of use in all the relevant populations has been adequately justified based on the totality of the data. 
Therefore, extrapolation of data from adults is acceptable. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies
Dose selection
The approved dosing regimen in adults and adolescent patients aged 12 years and older is 15 mg/kg 
IV Q4W. The objectives of the paediatric clinical pharmacology program were to select the appropriate 
dose regimen for paediatric patients with HoFH (aged ≥5 to <12 years) and to characterize the total 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 54/103
evinacumab serum PK, the total ANGPTL3 serum concentrations, as a measure of target engagement, 
and the immunogenicity potential of evinacumab in these patients. Based on the PK results of a single 
dose of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV in Part A of Study R1500-CL-17100, which were evaluated together 
with the data from adult and adolescents HoFH patient, a dose of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W was selected for 
Part B of study R1500-CL-17100. Multiple-dose administrations of evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV over 24 
weeks in the 14 paediatric patients with HoFH aged 5-≤ 11 years in Part B resulted in a LDL-C 
reduction of – 48.3%, which was consistent with the adults and adolescent population in Study R1500-
CL-1629 (-47.1%), despite the lower steady-state evinacumab concentrations relative in the paediatric 
population in study R1500-CL-17100 compared to those observed in the adult population. These 
findings indicate that the steady-state evinacumab concentrations in paediatric patients were sufficient 
to achieve maximal target engagement.
Overall, it can be concluded that dose adjustment is not required in paediatric patients aged 5-≤ 12 
years and that the 15 mg/kg IV Q4W dose regimen is appropriate for all HoFH patients regardless of 
age.
Pivotal paediatric study R1500-CL-17100
R1500-CL-17100 is an ongoing 3-part, phase 1b/3 single-arm open-label study evaluating the efficacy, 
safety and pharmacokinetics of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W evinacumab in a total of 20 paediatric patients with 
HoFH aged ≥5 to <12 years. General inclusion/exclusion criteria seem appropriate to reflect the 
patients for which an indication is being sought. It should be noted that the criteria are consistent with 
those of the pivotal Phase 3 Study R1500-CL-1629 in adolescents and adults submitted and assessed 
during the initial MAA. The HoFH diagnosis had to be genetically or clinically confirmed by specific 
criteria, which seems appropriate. Further, the population had to receive stable maximally tolerated 
therapy including apheresis. Exclusion criteria designed to prevent confounding of efficacy results 
included background lipid lowering therapy, including apheresis, not stable for a sufficient period prior 
to screening, as well as the presence of any clinically significant uncontrolled endocrine disease known 
to influence serum lipids or lipoproteins. The design of the study is appropriate to achieve the primary 
objectives of the study. The study composed of 3 parts: Part A (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics 
[PK/PD]), Part B (24-week primary efficacy and safety) and Part C (48-week treatment period and 24-
week follow-up period). The run-in period of ≤ 8 weeks in Part A and Part B can be considered 
sufficient to establish a stable background condition. The 24-week treatment period in Part B is 
considered appropriate to provide reasonable results on the LDL-C (and other cholesterol parameters). 
After completion of Part A and Part B, patients enrolled in Part C where they were treated for 48-weeks 
followed by a 24-weeks follow-up period, which is considered sufficient to establish maintenance of 
effect. The primary endpoint of percent change LDL-C from baseline to week 24 is acceptable and 
sufficiently long to provide reliable stable data on evaluation of LDL-C reduction for 6 times 
administration of evinacumab. Within the evinacumab clinical program, LDL-C is used as a surrogate 
biomarker for cardiovascular risk reduction, which is acceptable, based on the existing unmet need for 
these patients and knowing that robust evaluation of any potential cardiovascular benefit with 
evinacumab seems difficult to achieve due to the rarity of the disease. Key secondary endpoints 
evaluation of other lipid parameters (i.e. Apo-B, non-HDL-C, TC, and Lp(a)) and proportion of patients 
with ≥50% reduction in LDL-C at week 24 are considered appropriate to provide further insight on and 
confirmation of the primary objective.
Evkeeza was initially granted a MAA under exceptional circumstances. A non-interventional post-
authorisation safety study (PASS) was requested at the time in order to generate  further confirmatory  
data on the cardiovascular implications of treating patients with evinacumab. This was considered 
important in view of the not completely understood new mechanism of action of evinacumab also in 
relation to the limited understanding of the implications of the observed potential off target effect of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 55/103
HDL-C reduction. One objective of the study was to evaluate the atherosclerosis process over time in 
patients with HoFH who are treated with evinacumab and undergo cardiac imaging. In this context, the 
exploratory endpoint of “Vascular changes via carotid intima-media thickness at baseline and at 6-
month intervals, as clinically indicated (for intra-patient comparison)” is highly endorsed. With respect 
to statistical analysis, the definition of the analysis population is considered standard and acceptable.
Efficacy data and additional analyses
Pivotal Study R1500-CL-17100
The statistical analysis and handling of missing data were performed adequately. 
In the pivotal study R1500-CL-17100, a total of 6 paediatric patients in Part A and a total of 14 
paediatric patients in Part B were enrolled, treated, and completed their part of the study. A total of 20 
patients (6 patients from Part A, and 14 patients from Part B) were treated in Part C. As of the interim 
cut-off date of 02 Jun 2022, 6 (30.0%) patients have completed the study and a total of 14 (70.0%) 
patients were ongoing in the study.
All patients (n=20; 100%) enrolled in this study had important protocol deviations. The most common 
type of important protocol deviations were “procedural irregularities” which included  “PK/drug 
concentration sample not obtained” (17 (85.0%) patients), “patient not fasting prior to collecting Part 
B specialty lipid panel” at certain visits (8 (40%) patients), “Part C lipid panel not collected” at certain 
visits (6 (30.0%) patients), and “patients not fasting prior to collecting Part C lipid panel” at certain 
visit (6 (30%) patients). The second most common type of protocol deviations was "other", which 
included 12 patients (60%) whom lipid apheresis was not according to their schedule. Nevertheless, 
the Applicant has adequately shown that the high number of important protocol deviations are 
expected not to have a clinically impact on the outcome of the study. The overall compliance to 
evinacumab therapy was high; Two (33.3%) patients in Part A, 2 (14.3%) patients in Part B and 2 
(10%) in Part C had their infusions interrupted but all infusions were resumed within minutes of the 
interruption, which is reassuring. This study was a multicentre study in 5 countries worldwide (Austria, 
Australia, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United States), and almost half of the subjects were from 
Europe (n=9; 45%), which is sufficiently representative for Europe. No amendments were made that 
would compromise the endpoints or outcomes of the study. The amendments are considered valuable 
and are, therefore, acceptable.
Regarding baseline data, in Part A, the 6 paediatric patients were aged 7 to 11 years. There were 2 
(33.3%) male and 4 (66.7%) female patients, all (100%) were White. The mean (SD) baseline  LDL-C 
was 10.1 (5.75) mmol/L. All patients were diagnosed by genotyping and there were no patients with 
homozygous (LDLRAP1) or double heterozygous (LDL-R and ApoB) mutation. All patients received 
statin therapy (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin)  of which 4 (66.7%) patients receiving high-intensity 
statins. Additionally, all 6 patients received ezetimibe therapy. Five (83.3%) patients had at least 1 
apheresis treatment (4 (66.7%) patients had weekly treatments and 1 (16.7%) patient had bi-weekly 
treatments). In Part B, the 14 paediatric patients were aged ≥5 to <12 years of which 7 patients aged 
5 to 9 years and 7 patients aged 10 or 11 years. There were 6 (42.9%) males and 8 (57.1%) females; 
8 patients were White. The mean (SD) baseline LDL-C was at 6.8 (2.35) mmol/L. Thirteen (92.9%) 
patients were diagnosed by genotyping and 1 (7.1%) patient by clinical diagnosis and there were no 
patients with homozygous (LDLRAP1) or double heterozygous (LDL-R and ApoB) mutation. At baseline, 
12 out of 14 (85.7%) patients used statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) of which 6 (42.9%) were 
taking high-intensity statins. All 14 patients were taking a non-statin lipid-lowering therapy; 13 
(92.9%) patients were taking ezetimibe and 2 (14.3%) patients were taking lomitapide. During Part B, 
7 (50.0%) patients had at least 1 apheresis treatment (3 (21.4%]) patients had weekly treatments 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 56/103
and 4 (28.6%) patients had bi-weekly treatments). As Part C enrolled all patients from Part A and Part 
B, demographic and baseline characteristics for these patients are already described separately above 
in Part A and Part B. Overall, sufficient HoFH patients aged 5-9 (n=11) vs 10-11 (n=9) have been 
included and all patients had diagnosis of HoFH and were on maximally stable lipid lowering therapy, 
including statins, ezetimibe, lomitapide, and lipoprotein apheresis, which is considered appropriate.
In the primary efficacy analysis, treatment with treatment with evinacumab resulted in a substantial 
reduction in the primary endpoint of mean % change from baseline in LDL-C at week 24 of -48.3% 
(95% CI  68.8 to  27.8) in paediatric patients ≥5 to <12 years of age in Part B, which corresponds to 
an absolute mean change in LDL-C of approximately -3.416 mmol/L, which can be regarded as 
clinically relevant. The reduction in LDL-C with evinacumab were observed as early as Week 1 and 
sustained over 24 weeks in Part B. The degree of reduction was comparable to that observed in adult 
and adolescent patients evaluated in the initial MAA. Regarding long-term effect, the mean (SD) % 
change from baseline in LDL-C at week 48 in Part C was ‑39.71% (19.9), which was lower than 
observed in Part B. The Applicant clarified that this smaller long-term effect size was high likely 
attributed to the small number of patients who contributed to this data (Part C is still ongoing), 
changes in frequency of apheresis in 6 patients, and an increase in LDL-C of up to 90% in 1 patient 
who was not compliant with lipid-lowering therapy. 
The LDL-C lowering effect appears generally consistent among subgroups, including age, patients 
receiving apheresis yes or no (-47.9% and -48.8 %, respectively) and the most difficult to treat 
patients with null/null (-57.2%) and negative/negative (-67.7%) mutations. A smaller effect size was 
observed in the subgroups of male patients (-31.4%) and age category ≥10-<12 (-30.9%). The 
Applicant adequately clarified that the difference in these means were driven by 2 male patients aged 
≥10 to <12 years who were not able to comply with fasting lipid samples and one who confirmed 
noncompliance with their lipid-lowering therapy. Moreover, the mean reduction in LDL-C observed in 
paediatric patients with HoFH aged 5-≤ 11 years treated with evinacumab was consistent to the mean 
reduction in LDL-C in patients in the R1500-CL-1629 double-blind placebo-controlled study (−47.1% 
for evinacumab treatment group), as reported in the initial MAA.
The primary endpoint results were further supported by the beneficial effects in secondary cholesterol 
measurements (e.g. Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, and Lp(a)). At Week 24, 78.6% of the patients had a  
≥50% reduction in LDL-C at Week 24.
Regarding the exploratory endpoint of change in carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), no beneficial 
effect was found, which can be attributed to the limited number of patients and the short follow-up of 
24 weeks; In 4 (28.6%) patients with matching baseline and 24-week follow-up cIMT measurements, 
the change from baseline was 0.025 (0.0311) mm.
Supportive Study R1500-CL-1719
Study R1500-CL-1719 is an ongoing OL study designed to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy 
of evinacumab in patients with HoFH. The open-label design in considered acceptable, considering the 
long term (4 year) follow up. 
A total of 116 patients (Total Evinacumab) were enrolled and treated (New Evinacumab N=46; 
Continue Evinacumab N=70) of which 14 adolescent patients with HoFH. At the time of this submission 
(data cut-off date 25 April 2022 and database lock date of 25 May 2022), 8 adolescent patients 
(57.1%) completed the study, 5 patients (35.7%) were ongoing in the study, and 1 patient (7.1%) 
discontinued the study. The reason for study discontinuation was decision by the investigator/Sponsor, 
due to the availability of evinacumab treatment in an alternative setting. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 57/103
In the Adolescent Population, treatment with evinacumab resulted in a mean (SD) % change from 
baseline in LDL-C at week 24 -55.4% (25.29) corresponding to an absolute mean (SD) change from 
baseline in LDL-C at week 24 of  4.68 (2.5) mmol/L. The mean (SD) % change from baseline in LDL C 
were greater in the New Evinacumab group (60.32% (11.912)) (n=10) compared with the Continue 
Evinacumab group (30.55% (65.423)) (n=2) at Week 24 due to one patient which had only a decrease 
in LDL-C at Week 24 of 15.71% probably due to an increase in the interval of the apheresis sessions.  
Nevertheless, the LDL-C reductions in the New Evinacumab and the Continue Evinacumab groups are 
both considered clinically relevant. 
The reductions in LDL-C with evinacumab were seen from the first post-baseline lipid measurement at 
week 8 and were maintained through at least Week 88 (mean (SD) % change from baseline at Week 
88 of −44.95% (39.078) for the Total Evinacumab group; n=9), after which time the results were 
more variable which may have been due to the small patient numbers (1 each from the New and 
Continue Evinacumab groups). Efficacy data of the Total population (adolescent and adults) from Study 
R1500-Cl-1719 showed maintenance of LDL-C reduction, although somewhat smaller compared with 
week 24, of -30.8% for up to approximately 120 weeks (over 2.5 years). However, this reduction in 
LDL-C is still considered as clinically relevant. Also in this OL study, the primary endpoint results were 
further supported by the beneficial effects in secondary cholesterol measurements (e.g. Apo-B, non-
HDL-C, Total-C, and fasting TGs).
Atherosclerotic soft plaque progression assessment using coronary computed tomography angiography 
(CCTA) were available from two adolescent patients. Both adolescents showed a reduction in total 
plaque volume from 12.6 ± 8.1 mm3 at baseline to 3.0 ± 1.5 mm3 (76%) and from 233.5 ± 36.0 
mm3 at baseline to 34.8 ± 19.3 mm3 (85%), however, firm conclusions cannot be made due to the 
limited number of patients (n=2).
LDL-C lowering results at week 24 in the Adolescent population of the OL study R1500-CL-1719 (-
55.4%) were generally consistent with the results observed in paediatric patients with HoFH aged 5-≤ 
11 years of age in study R1500-CL-17100 (-48.3%), the Total population of the OL study R1500-CL-
1719 (-43.6%) and the adult population in the R1500-CL-1629 double-blind placebo-controlled study 
(−47.1% for evinacumab treatment group), as reported in the initial MAA. Overall, it can be concluded 
that treatment with evinacumab resulted in significant and clinically meaningful reductions in LDL-C 
which were consisted across all Phase 3 studies regardless of age.
2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
In conclusion, evinacumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in LDL-C and other lipid parameters in 
HoFH patients aged 5-≤11 years on top of standard of care, including statins, ezetimibe, lomitapide, 
and lipoprotein apheresis. The 48-week treatment period in Part C provides data of the maintenance of 
an effect in the long term; although the effect size appeared somewhat lower than what was observed 
in the 24-week treatment period in Part B, however, it is still considered clinically relevant. These 
results in HoFH patients aged 5-≤11 years were consistent to the updated interim analysis of an 
ongoing open-label study R1500-CL-1719 in adolescent (and adult) patients with HoFH.

2.6.  Clinical safety
Introduction
Main safety information on the use of evinacumab in patients with HoFH aged 5 - ≤11 years is based 
on the pivotal Study R1500-CL-17100, an ongoing Phase 1b/3 single-arm, open-label study designed 
to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of evinacumab in paediatric (≥5 to <12 years) patients 
with HoFH. In this study, adverse events are reported for Part A separately (single-dose PK/PD) and 
then as Pooled Parts B+C. Pooled Parts B+C results are reported cumulatively and include data from 
Part A patients during their participation in Part C and data from Part B patients during their 
participation in Parts B and C. Part B alone and Part C alone results are not summarized in this report.
Additionally, three updated integrated (pooled) analyses of safety data have been provided (Table 
14). Pool 2 was the primary pool for the integrated analysis of safety to support the initial MAA and 
will not be presented here as no updates are available. Therefore, in this assessment report, the focus 
is only on updated integrated analysis for Pool 3 (and global exposure of Pool 1). 
Pool 3 is an integration of open-label evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W data in adolescent and adult 
patients with HoFH (R1500-CL-1629 and R1500-CL-1719) and adults with persistent 
hypercholesterolemia (R1500-CL-1643) (Table 14). The open-label treatment period (OLTP) of 
R1500-CL-1629 and R1500 CL-1643, and the OL study R1500-CL-1719, have similar study design 
elements (eg, assessments, schedule of assessments, and common CRFs), which were pre-planned for 
the purpose of open-label data integration.
For Pool 3, separate tables, figures and listings were generated for the following analysis populations:
•
•
•
Adolescent Population: all participants ≥12 but <18 years of age at screening
Adult Population: all participants ≥18 years of age at screening
Total Population: all participants enrolled, ie, the Adult Population and the Adolescent 
Population).
For the analysis of the updated integrated OL safety data from Pool 3, the primary focus is to present 
an updated summary for the (paediatric) Adolescent Population; then generally summarized for the 
Total Population for additional context and updated longer-term safety data.
The paediatric study R1500-CL-17100 is not included in Pool 3.

Total population
The AE profile observed in the updated Pool 3 Total Population (uncontrolled studies) was similar to 
that observed in Pool 2 (placebo-controlled studies) previously reported at the time of initial marketing 
authorization. The TEAEs of nasopharyngitis, back pain, myalgia, and headache occurred in 
comparable proportions of patients in the Total Evinacumab group to that observed in the All 
Evinacumab IV Doses group previously described for Pool 2.
Treatment-emergent AEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients in any treatment group in Pool 3 that did 
not occur in ≥ 5% of patients in any treatment group in Pool 2 (previously reported) were abdominal 
Pain, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, chest pain, corona virus infection, cough, 
gastroenteritis, oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia, toothache, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary 
tract infection. Of these TEAEs, the majority were mild or moderate in severity and were considered 
not related to study drug by the Investigator.

Treatment-emergent treatment-related adverse events
Study R1500-CL-17100
In Part A, 1/6 (16.7%) patients experienced a TEAE of infusion site extravasation that was considered 
related to study treatment.
In the pooled population (Parts B+C), 3 (15.0%) patients experienced TEAEs that were considered by 
the Investigator to be related to study treatment. One (5.0%) patient experienced Fatigue, 1 (5.0%) 
patient experienced abdominal pain and nausea, and 1 (5.0%) patient experienced dermatitis contact 
and rash.
Pool 3
In the Adolescent Population, no patient experienced a TEAE that was considered by the Investigator 
to be related to study treatment. 
In Pool 3, 16 (7.8%) patients in the Total Evinacumab group experienced at least 1 TEAE classified by 
the Investigator as related to study treatment. All of these occurred in no more than 1 patient with the 
exception of the events of asthenia (n=2 (1.0%)), muscle spasms (n=2 (1.0%)), and headache (n=2 
(1.0%). None of these treatment-related TEAEs resulted in treatment discontinuation.
Adverse drug reactions
Paediatric Population (≥5 to <12 years)
To identify ADRs in patients aged ≥5 to <12 years, safety data from study R1500 CL 17100 were 
screened. This ADR analysis focused on pooled data from Parts B+C for the following reasons. First, 
Part A safety data included only single dose exposure in 6 patients; thus, no meaningful interpretation 
can be made on nonserious events. Second, Parts B+C included multiple doses of evinacumab. 
Importantly, in Part A, no serious or severe events were observed.
Pooled data from Parts B+C of study R1500-CL-17100 were screened to identify potential new ADRs in 
the following manner:
1. AESIs were evaluated as these events were of interest with evinacumab as a monoclonal 
antibody or based on theoretical safety concerns with lipid lowering therapy.
2. SAEs were reviewed to identify any potential serious ADRs.
3. All TEAEs at the PT level occurring in 2 (10%) or more patients were reviewed.
4. Because these safety data are OL, pooled placebo-controlled data in patients >12 years of age 
were also reviewed for context.
Ad. 1. The general allergic TEAEs, do not suggest any new safety concerns for allergic events and 
evinacumab. Further, no safety concerns were identified for hepatic disorders (see below for details on 
adverse events of special interest).
Ad. 2. Only 1 (5.0%) patient experienced an SAE. This was a case of Tonsillitis in one patient, which 
was considered to be not related to evinacumab by the investigator. No safety concerns were identified 
from SAEs.
Ad. 3. The following TEAEs at the PT level were reported in ≥ 2 (at least 10.0% of) patients:
•

•
COVID-19: 15 (75.0%) patients
Pyrexia: 5 (25.0%) patients

Abdominal pain: 2 (10.0%) patients
Body temperature increased: 2 (10.0%) patients
Rash: 2 (10.0%) patients
Nausea: 2 (10.0%) patients
Of these TEAEs, abdominal pain (and abdominal pain upper), nasopharyngitis, and nausea were 
previously identified as ADRs in patients aged 12 years or older and do not warrant further analysis.
A review of the other TEAEs occurring in 2 (10.0%) or more patients revealed:
•
COVID-19: Evinacumab has not been associated with infections in general, and there is no biologic 
plausibility that it predisposes to COVID-19 infections. Study R1500 CL-17100 was conducted over 
a multiple month time period during the COVID-19 pandemic when there was considerable ongoing 
transmission of SARS CoV-2.
•
Pyrexia and Body temperature increased: Given the similarity of these events, they are evaluated 
together. In total, 6 patients experienced 1 of these events (7 events total) and all events were 
considered not related to evinacumab by the investigator. None of these events were an infusion 
reaction. Overall, these events often occurred along with other events suggestive of an infection, 
without recurrence throughout evinacumab treatment, and are consistent with events typically 
observed in paediatric patients. These do not appear to be ADRs to evinacumab.
• Headache: 4 (20.0%) patients experienced 6 events of Headache. None of the events were 
considered by the investigator to be related to evinacumab. Two events occurred in patients who 
experienced Pyrexia. Two patients experienced Headache in the absence of concurrent events (1 
patient on study day 6 and another patient on study day 1 and study day 54). No events of 
headache were reported as infusion reactions. In the pool of placebo-controlled studies (Pool 2) 
previously described, Headache was reported in 9.4% of patients treated with evinacumab and 
20.4% of placebo-treated patients. Thus, headache is not considered an ADR with evinacumab.
• Oropharyngeal pain: 4 (20.0%) patients experienced 7 events of Oropharyngeal pain. None of the 
events were considered by the investigator to be related to evinacumab. Two events occurred in a 
patient who experienced Pyrexia on the same day (described above). One of the other 3 patients 
experienced repeated episodes of Oropharyngeal pain with repeated events of Cough and Rhinitis. 
Two patients experienced Oropharyngeal pain in the absence of other concurrent events. In the 
pool of placebo-controlled studies (Pool 2) previously described in the initial marketing 
authorization, Oropharyngeal pain was reported in 0.9% of patients treated with evinacumab 
compared to 0 patients treated with placebo. Overall, these events appear typical of those 
experienced by paediatric patients and do not suggest an ADR with evinacumab.
• Diarrhoea: 3 (15.0%) patients experienced 3 events of Diarrhoea. None of the events were an 
infusion reaction or considered by the investigator to be related to evinacumab. All 3 events of 
Diarrhoea were reported (on study days 28, 130, and 222) in the absence of other concurrent 
events. In the pool of placebo-controlled studies (Pool 2), Diarrhoea was reported in 2.6% of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 66/103
patients treated with evinacumab compared to 5.6% of patients treated with placebo as previously 
described in the initial marketing authorization. Thus, diarrhoea is not considered an ADR with 
evinacumab.
•
Vomiting: 3 (15.0%) patients experienced 4 events of Vomiting. In 1 patient, Vomiting was 
reported on study day 60 along with Abdominal pain upper on the same day. In 2 patients, 
Vomiting was reported (on study days 1, 350, and 377) in the absence of other concurrent events. 
None of the events were an infusion reaction or considered by the investigator to be related to 
evinacumab. In the pool of placebo-controlled studies (Pool 2) previously reported in the initial 
marketing authorization, Vomiting was not reported in any patients treated with either evinacumab 
or placebo. There is no apparent association with Vomiting and evinacumab, thus it is not 
considered an ADR.
•
Fatigue: 3 (15.0%) patients experienced 4 events of Fatigue. In all 3 patients, Fatigue was 
reported in the absence of other concurrent events. None of the events were reported as an 
infusion reaction; however, 2 events in 1 patient (on study days 141 and 176) were considered by 
the investigator to be related to evinacumab and one event was reported the same day after the 
infusion in another patient (on study day 1). In the pool of placebo-controlled studies (Pool 2), 
Fatigue was reported in 4.3% of patients treated with evinacumab compared to 3.7% of patients 
treated with placebo as previously reported in the initial marketing authorization. Based on this 
information, a potential causal association between Fatigue and evinacumab exists and, thus, it will 
be considered an ADR.
•
Rhinitis: 3 (15.0%) patients experienced 3 events of Rhinitis. In all 3 patients, Rhinitis was 
reported with concurrent events suggestive of a possible infection: one patient experienced Rhinitis 
with Cough on study day 361, one patient experienced Rhinitis with Body temperature increased 
and Oropharyngeal pain on study day 126, and one patient experienced Rhinitis with 
Oropharyngeal pain on study day 218. None of these events were considered by the investigator to 
be related to evinacumab. Overall, although rhinorrhoea is already considered an ADR, these 
events seem to be related to typical infections in paediatric patients and do not suggest a new ADR 
with evinacumab.
•
Cough: 3 (15.0%) patients experienced 6 events of Cough. The majority of these events were 
reported along with other concurrent events occurring on the same day:
o One patient experienced Cough with Rhinitis on study day 361.
o One patient experienced Cough with Oropharyngeal pain and Pyrexia on study day 297.
o One patient experienced Cough alone on study 96, with Oropharyngeal pain on study day 136, 
with Aortic stenosis on study day 162, and with Oropharyngeal pain on study day 277.
None of these events were considered by the investigator to be related to evinacumab. In the 
pool of placebo-controlled studies (Pool 2) previously reported in the initial marketing 
authorization, Cough was reported in 2.6% of patients treated with evinacumab compared to 
3.7% of patients treated with placebo. Overall, these events seem to be related to common 
infections in paediatric patients and do not suggest a new ADR with evinacumab.
•
Rash: 2 (10.0%) patients experienced 3 events of Rash. One patient experienced 2 events of Rash 
considered by the investigator to be related to evinacumab with a potential alternative aetiology. 
The second patient experienced Rash on study day 290, which was considered by the investigator 
to not be related to evinacumab. No clear relationship with evinacumab and Rash has been 
identified, thus it is not an ADR.
In conclusion, the review of TEAEs in the R1500-CL-17100 paediatric study identified only 1 new ADR 
with evinacumab: Fatigue (15.0%) applicable only to patients aged ≥5 to <12 years of age.

Adult and Adolescent Patients (Pool 3)
For this application, safety data from updated Pool 3 were also screened for ADRs in the following 
manner:
1. AESIs were evaluated.
2. Given the larger sample size of Pool 3, all TEAEs at the PT level occurring in 5.0% or more of 
patients in the total evinacumab group were evaluated to identify any potential ADRs from the 
more commonly reported TEAEs. 
Ad.1. Analysis of AESIs in the updated Pool 3 did not identify any new safety concerns (see below). 
There are no changes to the ADR profile for evinacumab based on review of updated Pool 3 
data.
Ad. 2. The following TEAEs at the PT level occurred in 5.0% or more of patients in the Total 
Evinacumab group:
• Nasopharyngitis (33 [16.0%] patients)
• Headache (25 [12.1%] patients)
•
•
•
•
•
•
Influenza like illness (22 [10.7%] patients)
Urinary tract infection (20 [9.7%] patients)
Arthralgia (16 [7.8%] patients)
Back pain (16 [7.8%] patients)
Corona virus infection (16 [7.8%] patients)
Upper respiratory tract infection (16 [7.8%] patients)
• Gastroenteritis (13 [6.3%] patients)
• Nausea (13 [6.3%] patients)
•
Cough (12 [5.8%] patients)
• Diarrhoea (12 [5.8%] patients)
•
Toothache (11 [5.3%) patients)
Of these TEAEs, Nasopharyngitis, Influenza like illness, Back pain, and Nausea were previously 
identified in patients 12 years and older as ADRs in the placebo-controlled pool (Pool 2), as reported at 
the time of the initial marketing authorization.
As previously reported, with the exception of Corona virus infection and Upper respiratory tract 
infection, the remaining TEAEs (Headache, Urinary tract infection, Arthralgia, Gastroenteritis, Cough, 
Diarrhoea, and Toothache) were all more frequent in the placebo treatment group compared with the 
evinacumab treatment group in Pool 2 and thus were not considered ADRs.
As previously reported in Pool 2, Upper respiratory tract infection was reported in 3 (2.6%) patients in 
all evinacumab group compared with 0 patients in the placebo group and occurred in 7.8% patients in 
the Total Evinacumab group in Pool 3. Upper respiratory tract infection is commonly observed in 
clinical studies independent of underlying disease conditions and will not be considered an ADR. 
Moreover, Nasopharyngitis and Rhinorrhoea are already considered ADRs for evinacumab and 
encompass the general medical concept of upper respiratory tract symptoms.
With regards to Corona virus infection, evinacumab has not been associated with infections in general, 
and there is no biologic plausibility that it predisposes to COVID-19 infections. Pool 3 included data 
collected over a multiple month time period during the COVID-19 pandemic when there was 
considerable ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this is not considered an ADR.
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023

Overall, there are no changes to the ADR profile for evinacumab based on review of updated Pool 3 
data.
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
Serious adverse events
Study R1500-CL-17100
In the paediatric R1500-CL-17100 study, there were no SAEs in Part A of the study. In the pooled 
population (Parts B+C), 1 (5.0%) patient experienced an SAE of tonsillitis that was considered by the 
investigator to be not related to study treatment.
Pool 3
In the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, 1 patient in the New Evinacumab group experienced 3 serious 
TEAEs (concurrent arteriovenous fistula site complication and vascular pseudoaneurysm, and 
gastroenteritis) that were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug.
In the Pool 3 Total Population, 34 patients (16.5%) experienced at least one serious TEAE. Other than 
the single event of anaphylactic reaction (previously reported in an adult patient from study R1500-CL-
1643), which was considered related to study drug, there were no additional serious TEAEs that 
appeared related from the updated Pool 3 analysis. Importantly, grouping of similar events was 
observed only for cardiac events, which reflect the underlying medical conditions of this patient 
population with HoFH.

Deaths
Study R1500-CL-17100
There were no deaths in the paediatric R1500-CL-17100 study.
Pool 3
As previously described in the initial marketing authorization, cardiac deaths occurred in 2 adults from 
the Pool 3 Total Population. Both deaths were assessed as unrelated to study treatment.
Adverse events of special interest
Protocol-defined AESIs in the paediatric R1500 CL-17100 study were the same as defined for the 
pivotal R1500-CL-1629, and the R1500-CL-1643 and R1500-CL-1719 studies.
The AESI categories were selected based on the physical-chemical nature of evinacumab 
(a monoclonal antibody), typical concerns for new drugs (eg, overdose or effects on pregnancy), or 
based on theoretical concerns with other lipid-lowering therapy (Table 22). The individual CSRs for 
the studies provide details on these AESIs as reported by Investigators.

neurologic events, neurocognitive events, cataracts, pancreatitis, or immune complex TEAEs.
In the updated Pool 3 (Adolescent and/or Total Populations), there were no cases of anaphylactic 
reactions, symptomatic overdose with investigational medicinal products, neurologic events, 
pancreatitis, or immune complex TEAEs. 
Select AESI categories are presented in the following subsections.
General allergic events
R1500-CL-17100
In Part A, a total of 2/6 (33.3%) patients experienced general allergic events TEAE. Both patients 
experienced mild allergic rhinitis.
In the pooled population (Parts B+C), 3 (15.0%) patients experienced general allergic TEAEs, including 
rash (2 [10.0%] patients), conjunctivitis allergic (1 [5.0%] patient), dermatitis contact (1 [5.0%] 
patient), and rhinitis allergic (1 [5.0%] patient). The events of dermatitis contact and rash were 
considered related to study treatment; however, alternate aetiologies were suspected. None of the 
general allergic TEAEs were serious, nor resulted in discontinuation of study treatment.
Pool 3
One patient in the Pool 3 Adolescent Population (7.1%) experienced general allergic TEAEs of 
dermatitis contact and seasonal allergy. All TEAEs were moderate in severity. None were considered by 
the investigator to be related to study treatment.
Consistent with data available at the time of the initial marketing authorization, general allergic TEAEs 
were reported in 28 (13.6%) patients in the updated Pool 3 Total Population. None of these events 
were fatal or serious or led to discontinuation of evinacumab treatment.
Of the reported general allergic TEAEs, the only PTs reported in more than 2 patients were pruritus, 
dermatitis contact, and rash. The majority of general allergic TEAEs were mild in severity. General 
allergic TEAEs considered moderate in severity included asthma, dermatitis contact, drug 
hypersensitivity, eczema, lip oedema, mouth ulceration, pruritus, pruritus generalized, rash, seasonal 
allergy, and urticaria chronic. The only severe general allergic TEAE reported was urticaria.
Five (2.4%) patients experienced a general allergic TEAE considered by the Investigator to be related 
to study treatment (data on file). These TEAEs included drug hypersensitivity, infusion related reaction, 
pruritus, pruritus generalised, and swelling face.
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 73/103
Infusion reactions
R1500-CL-17100
No paediatric patients experienced infusion reaction AESIs during the R1500-CL-17100 study.
Pool 3
One (7.1%) patient in the Adolescent Population experienced an infusion reaction (2 TEAEs of Cough 
and Dyspnoea). These events occurred 20 minutes into the 13th infusion resulting in discontinuation of 
the infusion. Both events were assessed as nonserious, mild in intensity, and unrelated to study drug. 
The events did not require treatment and recovered/resolved in 20 minutes time. The patient resumed 
study drug infusions the following month without incident and continued on treatment.
Infusion reactions TEAEs were reported in 13 (6.3%) patients in the updated Pool 3 Total Population. 
None of these events were fatal. One event of Acute MI was serious, and one event of headache led to 
discontinuation of evinacumab treatment.
Of the reported infusion reaction TEAEs, only the PTs asthenia and headache were reported in more 
than a single patient.
Hepatic disorders/liver enzyme elevations
R1500-CL-17100
No paediatric patient in R1500-CL-17100 experienced a hepatic disorder AESI during Part A or in the 
pooled population (Parts B+C). Although not included in the SMQ, 1 patient in Part A and 1 patient in 
the pooled population had a relevant TEAE of Alanine aminotransferase increased.
Pool 3
In the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, the following PTs were reported and are of note: Aspartate 
aminotransferase increased in 1 (7.1%) patient and Alanine aminotransferase increased in 1 (7.1%) 
patient.
In the updated Pool 3 Total Population, no patient experienced a hepatic disorder TEAE by SMQ.
Although not included in the SMQ, the following PTs were reported and are of note: Aspartate 
aminotransferase increased in 5 (2.4%) patients, Alanine aminotransferase increased in 5 (2.4%) 
patients, and Liver function test increased in 1 (0.5%) patient. None of these TEAEs were serious or 
led to any action taken with study treatment. Furthermore, no patient met the biochemical criteria for 
potential Hy’s law in study R1500-CL-17100 or Pool 3.
Pregnancy
Five pregnancies reported in 4 adult patients: 3 female patients and 1 female partner of a male 
patient.
• One female received study drug while on Study R1500 CL 1629 during first trimester gestation, 
and later enrolled in Study R1500 CL 1719, and became pregnant a second time while exposed to 
evinacumab during first trimester of gestation.
•
Two other female patients became pregnant while receiving evinacumab in Study R1500 CL 1719.
• One female partner of a male patient who received evinacumab in Study R1500 CL 1719 became 
pregnant.
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 74/103
Exposure to evinacumab was in the first trimester of gestation in all 5 pregnancies. All pregnancies 
were carried to term and resulted in delivery of a healthy baby with no reported embryofoetal toxicity 
or foetal anomaly.
Neurocognitive events
R1500-CL-17100
There were no neurocognitive events in Study R1500-CL-17100.
Pool 3
One adult patient in Pool 3 Total Population experienced a serious TEAE of mental status changes that 
was considered not related to study treatment by the Investigator.
New onset of diabetes
R1500-CL-17100
New onset diabetes (NOD) was evaluated in patients without diabetes at baseline through evaluation 
of TEAEs, laboratory parameters, and concomitant medications for hyperglycaemia. In Study R1500-
CL-17100, all patients were without diabetes mellitus at baseline, and no patients developed NOD 
during the study.
Pool 3
In the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, 14 (100%) patients were without diabetes mellitus at baseline. 
None of these patients met the criteria for NOD. In the updated Pool 3 Total Population, 188 (91.3%) 
patients were without diabetes mellitus at baseline. Of these patients, 8 (4.3%) met the criteria for 
NOD during treatment with evinacumab. Five adult patients met the NOD criteria based on fasting 
glucose, 2 patients met the NOD criteria based on HbA1c, and 1 patient met the NOD criteria based on 
any HLT of diabetes mellitus (including subtypes).
Diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications (in patients with diabetes at baseline)
R1500-CL-17100
In Study R1500-CL-17100, no paediatric patient had diabetes mellitus at baseline.
Pool 3
In the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, no patient had diabetes mellitus at baseline. In the updated Pool 3 
Total Population, 18 (8.7%) adult patients had diabetes mellitus at baseline as per medical history. Of 
these patients, 4 patients experienced a diabetic complication TEAE. Additionally, no clinically 
meaningful changes in mean HbA1c or fasting glucose were noted in paediatric patients from R1500-
CL-17100 or in Pool 3. Potentially clinically significant values for hyperglycaemia were primarily 
isolated, transient, and returned to within normal limits at the next visit in most patients in Pool 3.
Cataracts
R1500-CL-17100
There were no cataract events in the paediatric study R1500-CL-17100.
Pool 3
No patient in the Adolescent Population experienced a cataract TEAE. One adult patient in the Continue 
Evinacumab group experienced a cataract TEAE of moderate severity that was considered not related 
to study treatment by the Investigator.

Muscle events/creatine kinase elevation
R1500-CL-17100
In Part A, no patients experienced TEAEs in the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC.
In the pooled population (Parts B+C) 1 patient (5.0%) experienced a TEAE of Pain in extremity.
No patients in R1500-CL-17100 experienced a TEAE of Rhabdomyolysis or Myopathy SMQ.
No PCSV values for CK were reported in Study R1500-CL-17100.
Pool 3
Three patients in the Adolescent population experienced TEAEs in the Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders SOC. The TEAEs of arthralgia, arthritis, musculoskeletal pain, and myalgia were 
reported in 1 patient each. The events of arthralgia and arthritis were reported as moderate. All events 
were considered unrelated to study treatment by the Investigator.
TEAEs in the Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC were reported in 53 (25.7%) 
patients in the Pool 3 Total Population. No patient experienced a TEAE leading to discontinuation of 
study treatment in this SOC. One patient experienced a serious TEAE of joint effusion, which was 
considered not related to study treatment. The only severe TEAEs in this SOC were joint effusion and 
haemarthrosis (1 patient each). Moderate TEAEs in this SOC were reported in 28 (13.6%) patients. 
The PTs assessed as moderate in > 1 patient were back pain (10 patients), arthralgia (7 patients), and 
bursitis, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, pain in extremity, and tenosynovitis (2 
patients each). The TEAEs in this SOC reported in ≥5% of patients in the Total Evinacumab group were 
Arthralgia (7.8%) and Back pain (7.8%). In the updated Pool 3 Total Populations, no patient 
experienced a TEAE in the Rhabdomyolysis/myopathy SMQ.
Additionally, in the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, 2 patients experienced a CK elevation >3 upper limit 
of normal (ULN) and ≤5 ULN. Two patients experienced a CK elevation > 5 x ULN and < 10 x ULN. In 
the updated Pool 3 Total Population, 10 patients experienced a CK elevation > 5 x ULN and ≤ 10 x 
ULN, and 6 patients experienced a CK elevation > 10 x ULN. In Pool 3, most CK elevations > 10 x ULN 
were attributed to strenuous exercise.
Laboratory findings
Immunogenicity
R1500-CL-17100
One patient in Part A and 1 patient in Part B had detectable pre-existing ADAs against evinacumab at 
the start of treatment, and one patient in Part B developed a low titer of treatment-emergent ADAs 
(Table 23). None of the patients with ADAs had positive NAb results.
The LDL-C response profiles of the 1 ADA-positive patient lay within the distribution of the LDL-C 
response profiles of ADA-negative patients, suggesting that the positive ADA results did not affect the 
LDL-C responses for these patients.
There was no apparent effect of treatment-emergent ADA or NAb on the safety, efficacy, or PK of 
evinacumab.

in Paediatric Patients with HoFH (Study R1500-CL-17100)
Haematology
R1500-CL-17100
No notable trends in haematology parameters were evident during the paediatric study R1500-CL-
17100.
In R1500-CL-17100 Part A, one patient had a decrease in haematocrit (as well as haemoglobin) and 
was diagnosed with the AE of Iron Deficiency 7 days later. At the next visit, the haematocrit increased. 
Four patients had decreases in neutrophils that were transient and normalized 1-2 visits later.
In the R1500-CL-17100 pooled population (Parts B+C), a total of 6/20 (30.0%) had decreases in 
haematocrit. Three (15.0%) patients had decreases from baseline in haemoglobin of ≥2.0 g/dL (≥20 
g/L). The majority of these were minor variations. However, one patient had marked variations in 
haematocrit and corresponding haemoglobin values. The investigator attributed these variations to 
lipid apheresis treatments and changes in blood volume, and no associated TEAEs were reported.
Potentially clinically significant values were observed in leukocytes (2 patients), basophils (2 patients), 
neutrophils (6 patients), lymphocytes (1 patient), monocytes (2 patients), and eosinophils (1 patient). 
Most of these were transient. Decreases in neutrophils were noted in 1 patient for 3 of 4 visits over a 
4-month period. These findings were associated with TEAEs of Dermatitis contact, Rash, Hypertension, 
Ear pain, Fever, Throat pain, and COVID-19. All TEAEs were noted to be recovered/resolved and the 
neutrophil count returned to normal.
Pool 3
There were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in any haematology parameters (red blood 
cells, platelets, or white blood cells) in adolescents or adults from updated Pool 3.
In the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, 2/14 (14.3%) of patients in the Total Evinacumab group had a 
decrease in haemoglobin ≥1.5 g/dL from baseline, and 1 patient in the Continue Evinacumab group 
had a decrease in haemoglobin ≥2 g/dL from baseline. One adolescent patient had a potentially 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 77/103
clinically significant values (PCSV) for leukocytes; there were no other PCSV values for WBCs in this 
population.
In the updated Pool 3 Total Population, there was a notable number of patients with PCSVs for 
haemoglobin. Specifically, 14.3% of patients in the Total Evinacumab group had a decrease in 
haemoglobin ≥1.5 g/dL from baseline. The majority of the decreases in haemoglobin were transient 
and resolved at subsequent assessments and there were no TEAEs reported in the SOC of 
Investigations regarding abnormal haemoglobin values. 
In Pool 3, there were a notable number of patients with PCSVs for monocytes. Although 17.6% of 
patients in the Total Evinacumab group had PCSVs related to an increase in monocytes, values in these 
patients were transient and generally below 1.0 x 109/L. Importantly, there were no TEAEs reported in 
the SOC of Investigations for abnormal monocyte values
Clinical chemistry
HDL-C
R1500-CL-17100
In the R1500-CL-17100 paediatric study (Part B), mean (SD) baseline HDL-C was 0.86 mmol/L (33.3 
[12.71] mg/dL). At Week 24, mean (SD) value for  HDL-C was 0.50 mmol/L (19.5 [5.73] mg/dL), 
representing a mean (SD) change from baseline of −0.36 mmol/L (−13.8 [11.31] mg/dL).
Pool 3
In the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, the mean (SD) baseline HDL-C was 1.041 (0.3141) mmol/L. At 
Week 24, mean (SD) value for HDL-C was 0.593 (0.1365) mmol/L, representing a mean (SD) change 
from baseline of −0.481(0.2755) mmol/L. Decreases in mean HDL-C levels were generally consistent 
throughout the OL treatment period. 
In the updated Pool 3 Total Population, the mean (SD) baseline HDL-C was 1.262 (0.4520) mmol/L. At 
Week 24, mean (SD) value for HDL-C was 0.911 (0.3948) mmol/L, representing a mean (SD) change 
from baseline of −0.370 (0.3225) mmol/L. Decreases in mean HDL-C levels were generally consistent 
throughout the OL treatment period.
Routine serum chemistry
R1500-CL-17100
In the paediatric study R1500-CL-17100, there were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in 
metabolic or renal function parameters in R1500-CL-17100 Part A. No patients met the PCSV criteria 
for sodium, potassium, or chloride. In the R1500-CL-17100 pooled population (Parts B+C), one patient 
met the PCSV criteria for sodium ≤129 mq/L (≤129 mmol/L), but this finding was not associated with 
a TEAE.
Pool 3
In the updated Pool 3, there were no clinically meaningful changes from baseline in metabolic function, 
electrolytes, renal function, or liver function parameters.
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety
Vital signs and body weight
Study R1500-CL-17100
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 78/103
In R1500-CL-17100, no notable trends in vital signs were observed in the study.
In R1500-CL-17100 Part A, PCSVs for vital signs and weight were transient, and most were not 
associated with TEAEs. In the R1500-CL-17100 pooled population (Parts B+C), the most notable PCSV 
occurred in weight. A total of 19/20 (95.0%) patients had an increase of ≥5% in weight from baseline, 
which is consistent with growth and development expectations in a paediatric population.
There were also PCSVs in systolic blood pressure (6/20 [30.0%] patients), diastolic blood pressure 
(4/20 [20.0%] patients), and pulse rate (3/15 [15.0%] patients). The majority of these were isolated, 
transient decreases and not associated with symptoms of hypotension or tachycardia.
Pool 3
In the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, there were no clinically meaningful trends over time in vital signs. 
Potentially clinically significant values regarding a decrease in diastolic blood pressure were observed 
in 50.0% of patients in the Total Evinacumab group. All PCSVs regarding changes in blood pressure 
and pulse rate were transient and none were reported as TEAEs.
Potentially clinically significant values regarding changes in body weight were observed for both 
increases and decreases in weight. The majority (78.6%) of patients experienced PCSVs of ≥5% 
increase from baseline in body weight, which is consistent with growth and development expectations 
in an adolescent population.
For the updated Pool 3 Total Population, there were no clinically meaningful trends over time in vital 
signs or body weight. Potentially clinically significant values regarding a decrease or increase in systolic 
blood pressure were observed in 16.5% and 16.0% of patients in the Total Evinacumab group, 
respectively. All PCSVs regarding changes in blood pressure and pulse rate were transient and none 
were reported as TEAEs.
PCSVs regarding changes in body weight were observed for both increases and decreases in weight. 
There were 2 patients with PCSVs regarding a decrease in body weight that were also reported as 
TEAEs.
Tanner stages and hormones
Study R1500-CL-17100
At baseline in the pooled (Parts B+C) population, 12/20 (60.0%) patients were rated as Tanner Stage 
1, 6/20 (30.0%) patients were rated as Tanner Stage 2, and 2/20 (10.0%) patients were rated as 
Tanner Stage 3. Over the course of Parts B and C, 9/20 (45.0%) patients progressed ≥ 1 Tanner 
Stage. These changes were considered consistent with appropriate pubertal development in children 5-
11 years old.
Gonadal steroid hormones and gonadotropins were also evaluated for females and males. Baseline 
hormone levels and fluctuations were within the range expected for female and male children aged ≥5 
to <12 years. There were no PCSVs in hormones.
Study R1500-CL-1719
In Study R1500-CL-1719, Tanner stage results in the Adolescent Population were consistent with 
appropriate continuation of maturation and development. At study enrollment, the mean (SD) age in 
patients comprising the Adolescent Population was 14.4 (1.82) years; at study enrollment, the 5 
female patients ranged in age from 12 to 16 years and the 9 male patients ranged in age from 12 to 
17 years. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 79/103
Over the course of treatment, Tanner stage results in the Adolescent Population were consistent with 
continuation of maturation and development in these younger patients. Of the 7 male patients that 
were evaluable over the course of the study, 5 reached overall Tanner stage 5 by Week 72 compared 
with 1 patient at baseline; the remaining 2 male patients at Week 72 were at overall Tanner stages 3 
and 4 (1 patient each). By Week 72, all 4 evaluable female patients had reached overall Tanner stage 
4 compared with 1 patient at baseline.
Baseline hormone levels and fluctuations were within the range expected for children aged 12 to <18 
years at study enrollment.
Discontinuation due to adverse events
Study R1500-CL-17100
No patient in the R1500-CL-17100 paediatric study experienced TEAEs that led to permanent 
treatment discontinuation during the study.
Pool 3
No patient in the Pool 3 Adolescent Population experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study 
treatment.
Three patients in the updated Pool 3 Total Population experienced events leading to discontinuation of 
study treatment. One patient experienced the TEAE of headache, and 2 patients discontinued study 
treatment due to pregnancy, which was considered as an AESI per protocol.
Post marketing experience
As detailed in Evkeeza periodic benefit-risk evaluation report #4 (PBRER #4: reporting period of 12 
Aug 2022 - 11 Feb 2023), submitted to EMA on 20 April 2023, no new information became available 
during the reporting interval that would impact the known benefit-risk profile of evinacumab in the 
approved indication.
In terms of signal and risk evaluation, no signals were identified, or validated as safety concerns 
during this reporting interval.
With regards to the important potential risk of embryofetal toxicity, no case reports indicative of 
embryofetal toxicity or congenital anomaly events were identified from the totality of the pregnancy 
outcome reports [i.e., from spontaneous post-marketing sources and solicited data sources (post-
marketing patient support program [MYRARE], clinical trials, EAP and CUPs with evinacumab)] that 
were reviewed in the reporting interval. No relevant information for this safety concern was identified 
from other available sources.
With regards to missing information on safety of long-term use (e.g., >2 years), as of the DLP of 
PBRER #4, additional data on longer treatment exposure with evinacumab was available from the 
clinical study R1500-CL-1719. Overall, 61.2% (71/116) of patients had been treated with evinacumab 
for more than 104 weeks. Safety of long-term use (e.g. >2 years) remains a missing information topic 
for evinacumab and will be monitored through clinical trials (R1500-CL-1719, open-label extension 
study), routine pharmacovigilance activities, a planned category 2 long-term registry PASS [1500-CL-
2161/UX858-CL401], and published literature review. Any relevant information will be described in 
future PBRERs.
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 80/103
With regards to missing information on use in pregnant or breastfeeding women, the global safety 
database was searched using the SMQ Pregnancy and neonatal events for case reports of pregnancy 
received from any sources including spontaneous post-marketing sources and solicited data sources 
(post-marketing patient support program [MYRARE], clinical trials, and CUPs with evinacumab). During 
the reporting interval, one initial case report of pregnancy was received. Follow-up information has 
been requested and will be reported in the next PBRER. No pregnancy outcome report was consistent 
with human embryofoetal toxicity and evinacumab exposure. No relevant information regarding foetal 
toxicity with evinacumab use was identified from other available sources. No reports of evinacumab 
use during breastfeeding were received from any sources. Use in pregnant or breastfeeding women 
remains a missing information topic for evinacumab and will be monitored through clinical trial data, 
routine pharmacovigilance, additional activities (a planned category 2 long-term PASS [R1500-CL-
2161/UX858-CL401] and an ongoing FDA PMR Study [R1500-CL-2162]), and published literature. Any 
relevant information will be discussed in future PBRERs.
Finally, with regards to new information on the risk of systemic hypersensitivity reactions (including 
anaphylaxis and infusion reactions), which were not categorized as important, 4 initial cases (1 
spontaneous and 3 solicited) reporting 11 events were retrieved from the global safety database using 
the above SMQ search strategy, during the reporting interval. No follow-up information was received 
during the reporting interval. All 4 cases were non-serious. The risk of systemic hypersensitivity 
reaction (including anaphylaxis and infusion reactions) is properly described in the ‘Warning & 
Precautions’ and ‘Contraindications’ sections of the prescribing information for evinacumab with no 
changes necessary.
Based on all available safety and efficacy data for evinacumab, the overall benefit-risk balance remains 
positive in the approved indication. The safety profile of evinacumab remains stable and consistent 
with safety data observed in clinical trials. It will continue to be monitored through pharmacovigilance 
activities in place.
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety
Main safety information on the use of evinacumab in patients with HoFH aged 5 -≤11 years is based 
on the pivotal Study R1500-CL-17100, an ongoing Phase 1b/3 single-arm, open-label study designed 
to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of evinacumab in paediatric (≥5 to <12 years) patients 
with HoFH. Additionally, three updated integrated pooled safety analyses have been provided. Pool 2 
(R15-CL-1629 DBTP and R1500-CL-1643) was the primary pool for the integrated analysis of safety to 
support the initial MAA and will not be discussed here as no updates are available. Therefore, in this 
assessment report, the focus is only on updated integrated analysis for Pool 3 (and global exposure of 
Pool 1). Pool 3 is an integration of open-label evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W data in adolescent and 
adult patients with HoFH (R1500-CL-1629 and R1500-CL-1719) and adults with persistent 
hypercholesterolemia (R1500-CL-1643), which had similar study design elements. For Pool 3, the 
safety results were presented using the following analysis populations, i.e. Adolescent Population (all 
participants ≥12 but <18 years of age at screening), Adult Population (all participants ≥18 years of 
age at screening) and the Total Population (all participants enrolled, i.e. the Adult Population and the 
Adolescent Population). The Pool 3 Adolescent Population is actually the Adolescent Population of 
R1500-CL-1719, since no adolescents were enrolled in Study R1500-CL-1643 in persistent 
hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, all patients in the Pool 3 Adolescent Population were HoFH patients.
Patient exposure 
In the initial MAA dossier, a total of 76 HoHF patients had been exposed to evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV 
Q4W for at least 24 weeks and 51 HoFH patients for at least 48 weeks, with placebo-controlled safety 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 81/103
data for at least 24 weeks available for only 38 HoFH from study R1500-CL-1629, including 1 
adolescent. Safety data on persistent hypercholesterolemic patients (study R1500-CL-1643) increased 
the available exposure data with 29 patients exposed to evinacumab 15 mg/kg IV Q4W and 28 
patients to evinacumab 5 mg/kg IV Q4W for at least 24 weeks. Overall, the safety data in HoFH 
patients during the initial MAA was very limited, but expected considering the rarity of the disease. 
Therefore, Evkeeza has been granted a MAA under exceptional circumstances. Consequently, a non-
interventional post-authorisation safety study (PASS) was requested in order to generate confirmatory 
data on, among others, long-term safety and the cardiovascular implications of treating patients with 
evinacumab. In this respect, it was expected that the ongoing 4 years open label study R1500-CL-
1719 and a PASS agreed as specific obligation in the context of the MA under exceptional 
circumstances should provide some additional data to further evaluate long-term safety.
Since the start of the clinical development program for evinacumab till the latest data cut-off, a total of 
243 patients have been treated with any IV dose of evinacumab in either placebo‑controlled or 
open‑label trials (Pool 1). Of these, 139 patients had HoFH, of whom 138 patients were treated with 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg Q4W for at least 24 weeks, 120 patients for at least 52 weeks, and 78 patients 
were treated for at least 104 weeks, respectively. 
In the pooled population of study R1500-CL-17100, a total of 20 paediatric patients were exposed to 
evinacumab with a mean (SD) duration of 51.63 (5.28) weeks of whom 5 patients were exposed to 
evinacumab for at least 56 weeks. Pooled Parts B+C results are reported cumulatively and include data 
from Part A patients during their participation in Part C and data from Part B patients during their 
participation in Parts B and C.
In the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, a total of 14 patients who participated in R1500-CL-1629 and/or 
R1500-CL-1719 were exposed to evinacumab with a mean (SD) duration of 97.22 (25.36) weeks of 
whom 14 adolescent HoFH patients were exposed for at least 52 weeks and 3 adolescent HoFH for at 
least 104 weeks. Regarding the Total Population in Pool 3 (adolescent and adult), a total of 206 HoFH 
patients were exposed to evinacumab with a mean (SD) duration of 80.97 (41.19) weeks of which 103 
HoFH patients were exposed for at least 52 weeks and 67 HoFH patients for at least 104 weeks. 
Overall, the exposure data has substantially increased compared with the exposure data during the 
initial MAA. Nevertheless, the exposure data in paediatric HoFH patients aged 5-≤ 11 years of age of a 
total of 20 patients exposed to evinacumab with a mean (SD) duration of 51.63 (5.28) weeks of which 
5 patients were exposed to evinacumab for at least 56 weeks, is very limited, but  expected 
considering the rarity of the disease.
Adverse events
During Part A and in the pooled (Parts B + C) population of R1500-CL-17100, a high proportion of 
patients experienced at least one TEAE (83.3% and 95.0%, respectively), which appeared somewhat 
higher as observed during the initial MAA (65.9%). However, the majority of the TEAEs were classified 
as mild or moderate in severity, which is reassuring. Additionally, there were no patients with TEAEs 
resulting in treatment discontinuation or death in Part A and the pooled population. There was only one 
SEA reported in the pooled population that was considered by the investigator to be unrelated to 
study. The most frequent TEAEs were vitamin D deficiency, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and rhinitis 
allergic (2 patients each (33.3%) in Part A and COVID 19 (15/20 (75.0%) patients), and pyrexia (5/20 
(25.0%) patients) in the pooled (Parts B + C) population. The AEs considered treatment-related by the 
investigator were reported in 1 (8.2%) patient in Part A (infusion site reaction) and in 3 (15.0%) 
patients in the pooled (Parts B + C) population (fatigue, abdominal pain and nausea, and dermatitis 
contact and rash). Infusion site reactions, abdominal pain, and nausea are already known ADRs from 
the initial MAA dossier. 
In the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, TEAEs were also frequently reported (85.7%), however, no 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 82/103
patient had a TEAE leading to discontinuation of study treatment, TEAE considered related to study 
treatment, or death. One patient experienced 3 serious TEAEs (concurrent arteriovenous fistula site 
complication and vascular pseudoaneurysm, and gastroenteritis) that were considered by the 
investigator to be unrelated to study drug. 
In the Pool 3 Total Population, 80.6% of the HoFH patients experienced any TEAEs. Overall, the safety 
profile of the Pool 3 Total Population was consistent to that of Pool 2 (previously assessed during initial 
MAA). Treatment-emergent AEs that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients in the Pool 3 Total Population that 
did not occur in ≥ 5% of patients in any treatment group in Pool 2 were abdominal pain, blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased, chest pain, corona virus infection, cough, gastroenteritis, 
oropharyngeal pain, pyrexia, toothache, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection. 
However, the majority of these were mild or moderate in severity and were considered not related to 
study drug by the investigator.
To identify (new) ADRs, the Applicant focussed on AEs of special interest (AESIs), SAEs and TEAEs at 
the PT level occurring in 2 (10%) or more patients in the pooled (Parts B + C) population of the pivotal 
study R1500-CL-17100 and on AESIs and TEAEs at the PT level occurring in 5.0% or more patients in 
Pool 3, which is considered acceptable. Based on these evaluations, only fatigue was identified as a 
new ADR, which is endorsed. However, the Applicant was requested to justify why the ADR fatigue is 
applicable only to patients aged 5-≤ 11 years since in the placebo-controlled studies in adults a 
slightly higher frequency of fatigue events was reported in the evinacumab group compared with the 
placebo group (4.3% vs. 3.7%). Moreover, considering the MoA and the disease similarity between 
adult, adolescents and paediatric HoFH patients, a difference in causal association is not expected. In 
the response, the Applicant highlighted that there was a close association of administration of the drug 
and the onset of events and that there were two fatigue events in one patient which was considered by 
the investigator treatment related. As there is no controlled data in paediatric patients aged 5 to <12 
years, the causal relationship of fatigue in the paediatric population could not be ruled out according to 
the Applicant. 
Regarding the adult and adolescent population, although the clinical pattern of AEs of fatigue was 
similar between adults (and adolescents) and patients aged 5 to < 12 years, data of the placebo-
controlled studies in the adults and adolescents (DBTP of R1500-CL-1629 and R1500-CL-1643) showed 
a risk difference for fatigue of 0.5% with a 95% CI [-5.7% ; 6.6%] (n=5 (4.3%) and n=2 (3.7%) for 
the evinacumab and placebo group, respectively), which corresponds to an absence of risk difference. 
Based on the above, the Applicant argued that fatigue should only be considered an ADR for paediatric 
patients aged 5 to < 12 years.  However, the incidence in fatigue between the adult (+adolescent) 
population and the paediatric population did not differ much according to CHMP. Additionally, asthenia 
is currently already stated as the ADR table in section 4.8 of the SmPC based on the data of the 
placebo-controlled studies in adults and adolescents. The Applicant clarified that the events of asthenia 
and fatigue were recorded as different verbatim terms as reported by clinical investigators. It is 
however unclear if the differences between the two types of recordings were clinically relevant. In 
other words, whether the investigators intentionally rejected one term and used the other term 
instead. Additionally, fatigue has a broader definition and also includes asthenia (according to Pelicier, 
1994). Based on the above, the Applicant was requested to include fatigue in the ADR table in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. Subsequently, the extra information in “Description of selected adverse reactions” 
under the table should describe that fatigue, which is then mentioned in the table, is only observed in 
a certain age group according to the available data. In the response, the Applicant has updated section 
4.8 of the SmPC as requested by CHMP. The Applicant also highlighted that the ADR fatigue may occur 
within an undefined timeframe, which was acknowledged by CHMP. Therefore,  the specification “after 
infusion” may be misleading and may lead to confusion, since fatigue is expected to be experienced 
shortly after the infusion, which is not necessarily the case. As such, it was agreed that the ADR 
fatigue should be stated without any additional information regarding the timing with the infusion.
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 83/103
In this respect, every ADR should be included in the ADR table in section 4.8 and that no new ADRs 
(ADRs not mentioned in the table) should only be described in “Description of selected adverse 
reactions” under the table. 
Further, no new ADRs were identified based on screening of updated Pool 3 data from adolescents and 
adults.  
AEs of special interest
Special attention has been given to certain AESIs, including anaphylactic reactions, general allergic 
events, infusion reactions, hepatic disorders, neurocognitive events, neurologic events, new onset of 
diabetes (NOD), diabetes mellitus or diabetic complications, pancreatitis, cataracts, immune complex 
diseases, and muscle events/creatine kinase elevation. 
In the pivotal study R1500-CL-17100, there were no events of anaphylactic reactions, infusion 
reactions, NOD, muscle events, neurologic events, neurocognitive events, cataracts, pancreatitis, or 
immune complex TEAEs. In the Pool 3 Total Population, there were no cases of anaphylactic reactions, 
neurologic events, pancreatitis, or immune complex TEAEs. 
General allergic events. The incidence in general allergic events in Study R1500-CL-17100 (33% and 
15.0% in Part A and Part B, respectively) appeared higher compared with the Pool 3 Total Population 
(13.6%) and the placebo-controlled Pool 2 (~11), however, the events were not serious, did not result 
in discontinuation of study treatment and were considered not related to study drug. More specifically, 
two (33.3%) patients in Part A (both allergic rhinitis) and 3 (15.0%) patients in the pooled (Parts B + 
C) population (rash (2 (10.0%) patients), conjunctivitis allergic (1 (5.0%) patient), dermatitis contact 
(1 (5.0%) patient), and rhinitis allergic (1 [5.0%] patient) experienced general allergic events TEAE of 
which none were serious or resulted in discontinuation of the study drug. Only 1 patient experienced a 
general allergic TEAE considered by the investigator to be related study drug where this patient 
experienced 2 separate episodes of mild rash and 1 episode of dermatitis contact with possible 
alternative aetiologies including starch for the Rash and poison ivy contact for the dermatitis contact. 
In the updated Pool 3, none of the general allergic TEAEs were serious or led to discontinuation of 
study drug. Five patients in the Pool 3 Total population experienced general allergic TEAEs considered 
related to study drug, including hypersensitivity, infusion related reaction, pruritus, pruritus 
generalised, and swelling face. However, as evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody, there may be the 
potential for hypersensitivity reactions. Overall, the paediatric HoFH patients aged 5-≤ 11 years 
appears not to be at increased risk for allergic reactions. 
Infusion reactions. No paediatric patients experienced infusion reaction AESIs during the R1500-CL-
17100 study. In the Pool 3 Total Population, the percentage of patients with an infusion reaction was 
6.3% which is consistent with the frequency of 7.4% in the placebo-controlled studies in the initial 
MAA (Pool 2).  Infusion site reaction, infusion related reaction and anaphylaxis are currently already 
stated as ADRs in the labelling.
Hepatic disorders/ liver enzyme elevations. No patient experienced a hepatic disorder TEAE by or met 
patient met the criteria for Hy’s Law in both study R1500-CL-17100 or Pool 3. Some increases in liver 
enzymes were observed, however, the frequency was low, and none of these TEAEs were serious or 
resulted in discontinuation of study drug.
Neurocognitive events. With respect to neurocognitive events, one (0.49%) adult patient in Pool 3 
Total Population experienced a serious TEAE of mental status changes that was considered not related 
to study treatment by the investigator.
New onset of diabetes/diabetic complications. No patients in the pivotal Study R1500-CL-17100 or in 
the Pool 3 Adolescent Population had diabetes mellitus at baseline and no patients developed new 
onset of diabetes (NOD) during the studies. In the Pool 3 Total Population, 8 out of 188 (4.3%) 
patients without diabetes mellitus at baseline developed NOD during evinacumab treatment, however, 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 84/103
the frequency was similar as that observed in the placebo-controlled studies in the initial MAA (Pool 2) 
(7.4%). With respect to diabetic complications, 4 out of 18 adult patients who had diabetes mellitus at 
baseline experienced a diabetic complication TEA, however no clinically meaningful changes in mean 
HbA1c were reported in these patients.
Cataracts. One (0.49%) adult patient in the Pool 3 Total Population experienced a cataract TEAE of 
moderate severity that was considered by the investigator not related to study.
Muscle events/creatine kinase elevation. In paediatric patients from R1500-CL-17100 or in adolescent 
or adult patients in Pool 3, no serious muscle TEAEs, including rhabdomyolysis/myopathy were 
reported. In Study R1500-CL-17100, one (5.0%) patient experienced an event of pain in extremity. In 
the Pool 3 Adolescent Population, 53 (25.7%) patients experienced muscle events, which is consistent 
with that observed in the placebo-controlled studies in the initial MAA (21.0%). The most common (≥
5% of patients) TEAEs were arthralgia (7.8%) and back pain (7.8%). Pain in extremity and back pain 
are already known ADRs from the initial MAA dossier.
Overall, the safety data provided suggested that evinacumab was not associated with any new safety 
concerns related to hepatic TEAE or liver enzymes, neurologic or neurocognitive events, glycaemic 
control or diabetes in patients with or without diabetes at baseline, cataracts, pancreatitis, immune 
complex TEAEs, and muscle events/creatine kinase elevation. However, the open-label designs of the 
studies and the frequencies in the different AESIs are limited, making firm conclusions difficult.
These observations are supported by a genetic study of 650 carriers of ANGPTL3 LOF variants, which 
shows no association with any apparent increase in adverse clinical outcomes, including liver disease, 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, neurological diseases, risk of cancer or overall mortality. Nevertheless, the 
safety results of carriers of ANGPTL3 LOF variants are difficult to extrapolate to HoFH patients treated 
with evinacumab, among other things since the lipid profile between both populations are very 
different with severely elevated LDL-C levels in HoFH, while ANGPTL3 is suggested to play an 
important role in lipid metabolism. Additionally, in the genetic study, almost all patients were 
heterozygous ANGPTL3 LOF variants whereas, with evinacumab treatment, all ANGPTL3 in the serum is 
neutralised mimicking complete loss of ANGPTL3 function. Consequently, higher reductions in different 
lipid parameters were observed in HoFH patients treated with evinacumab compared with LOF variants 
compared with (LDL-C:-48.3% vs -10%, and HDL-C -41.9% vs -7%, respectively).
Serious AEs 
The percentage of patients experiencing SAEs in paediatric patients with HoFH aged 5 - ≤ 11 years 
was relatively low (n=1 (5.0%)), not considered related to study drug and lower to that observed in 
adults and adolescents the initial MAA dossier (9.9%), which is reassuring. Also the Pool 3 Adolescent 
and Total Population did not show any patterns indicative of a new safety signal; all SAEs were 
considered not related to study treatment, with the exception of a single event of an anaphylactic 
reaction which is already a known ADR from the initial MAA dossier.  
Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the pivotal study R1500-CL-17100 in in paediatric patients with HoFH aged 
5 - ≤ 11 years. Two deaths were reported in Pool 3 Total Population (both adults), but not considered 
related to study treatment, which has already been discussed during the initial MAA.
Laboratory findings 
A low level of immunogenicity of anti-drug antibody has been observed (n=1)  in study R1500-CL-
17100), which was low-titer, Nab negative and did not affect the LDL-C response. However, in Study 
R1500-CL-17100, 1 patient in Part A and 1 patient in Part B had detectable pre-existing anti-drug 
antibodies (ADAs) against evinacumab at the start of treatment. The Applicant adequately clarified that 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 85/103
the presence of pre-existing ADA responses can be attributed to a variety of factors, including 
sensitivity of the assay and cross-reactivity with other proteins. Further, it is stated that the ADA assay 
used in the evinacumab program is highly sensitive which allows for the detection of very low levels of 
antibodies, however, also increases the potential of detecting false positive responses. Nevertheless, 
these pre-existing ADA responses did not result in any safety or efficacy concerns in relation to 
evinacumab. 
Furthermore, no trends indicative of clinically important treatment-related laboratory abnormalities, 
including haematology parameters, renal and hepatic function parameters, blood glucose (see also 
AESIs) were observed with evinacumab.
However, in the pivotal study (consistent with other submitted studies), treatment with evinacumab 
resulted in a -41.9% reduction in HDL-C at week 24, with HDL-C reaching below normal levels of 0.50 
mmol/L. As also discussed during the initial MAA, this unfavourable effect could likely be to the effect 
of evinacumab on the endothelial lipase (EL) responsible for the hydrolysis of HDL-C particles. 
However, the impact of this for reverse cholesterol transport, especially in the setting of this diseased 
population with extremely high elevated cholesterol, is somewhat uncertain. Further, the potential 
impact on cardiovascular risk remains unclear, especially since recent findings challenged a clear 
correlation between HDL-C targeted treatment (increase in HDL-C) and improvement in cardiovascular 
risk. The cardioprotective association with LOF variants in ANGPTL3 may suggest that this may overall 
provide a cardiovascular protective effect with evinacumab. However, extrapolation to current findings 
may be complicated as the current diseased HoFH population substantially deviated from the LOF 
population based on the extremely elevated LDL cholesterol levels, and the loss of function in the LDL 
receptor. Overall, the lowering of HDL-C by evinacumab may likely not importantly offset the potential 
CV benefits from substantial lowering of LDL-C in these HoFH patients at very high cardiovascular, 
although special efforts are still requested to better understand the CV impact of evinacumab 
treatment post-approval by the conduction of the requested PASS study in light of the MAA under 
exceptional circumstances, in which the atherosclerosis process over time in patients with HoFH who 
are treated with evinacumab and undergo cardiac imaging.
It has to be noted that with the submission of this type II variation to extend the therapeutic indication 
of Evkeeza, the Applicant is proposing to adjust the age range of the PASS study to align with the 
therapeutic indication, thereby including patients aged 5 years and above, which is supported.
Vital signs
There were no trends indicative of important vital signs abnormalities, including systolic/diastolic blood 
pressure and heart rate, observed. Evaluations of growth and pubertal development (Tanner stage) 
and gonadal steroid hormones in paediatric patients from R1500-CL-17100 and the Pool 3 Adolescent 
Population showed that the changes were consistent with growth and development expectations in 
these populations, although the number of patients is limited (n=34) making firm conclusions difficult.
Discontinuation due to AEs 
The percentage of patients who discontinued due to AEs was low; Only 3 (1.46%) patients in the Pool 
3 Total Population and none in Study R1500-CL-17100 discontinued study drug, indicating that the 
drug is well tolerated.
Post marketing experience 
Post-marketing data did not reveal any additional safety concerns.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety
Generally, evinacumab displays an acceptable safety profile in paediatric HoFH patients aged 5-≤ 11 
consistent to those observed in adult and adolescent HoFH patients, with very few patients 
discontinuing treatment. However, the safety data of evinacumab in HoFH paediatric patients aged 5-≤ 
11  is very limited, which is expected, considering the rarity of the disease. No new safety signal has 
been identified with the exception of a new ADR fatigue, which has been added as ADR in the table in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
However, similar as in the initial dosser, there is some uncertainty on the effect of a lowering of HDL-C 
by evinacumab treatment. This does likely not offset the potential CV benefits from substantial 
lowering of LDL-C in HoFH patients who are at very high cardiovascular risk, although efforts are still 
requested to better understand the CV impact of evinacumab treatment by the conduction of the 
requested PASS study in light of the MAA under exceptional circumstances, in which the 
atherosclerosis process over time is studied in patients with HoFH who are treated with evinacumab 
and undergo cardiac imaging.

Safety Concern
Routine Risk Minimisation Activities
It is unknown whether evinacumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgGs 
are known to be excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, 
which decrease to low concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to 
the breast-fed infant cannot be excluded during this short period. Afterwards, 
evinacumab could be used during breast-feeding if clinically needed is 
included in SmPC Section 4.6 and PL Section 2 as recommendation on use of 
evinacumab for breast-feeding women.

Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indication(s).
2.8.  Update of the Product information
As  a  consequence  of  this  new  indication,  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC  have  been 
updated. The Annex II and the Package Leaflet have been updated accordingly.
Changes are also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template version 10.3.
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all changes to the Product Information.
2.8.1.  User consultation
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons:
The number of changes made in the package leaflet is small, and the changes do not fundamentally 
alter the layout or presentation of the information in the package leaflet.
Furthermore, the safety profile of Evkeeza in patients aged ≥5 to <12 years old is generally consistent 
with that observed in adult and adolescent patients, with the inclusion of fatigue as a possible side 
effect with increased frequency in children aged ≥5 to <12 years old. The MAH does not consider that 
this additional text would alter the ability of patients and care givers to locate and understand the 
information presented.
In addition, evinacumab will be administered by healthcare professionals only, and it is considered 
likely that for patients aged ≥5 to <12 years old, parents or carers of children will be responsible for 
reviewing and understanding the information, rather than the patients themselves.
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 91/103
In the original User Test, 7 of the 20 participants included were parents or carers of children, and 
therefore, it is considered that the functionality of the package leaflet for parents or carers has already 
been adequately tested.
The MAH considers that the patient leaflet is presented in accordance with the QRD Product 
information Template guidelines (28 September 2022/ version 10.3) and that no further changes to 
the patient leaflet are required in support of this type II variation. Furthermore, the MAH considers 
that the changes made do not alter the Patient Leaflet sufficiently to require a new User Test.
The CHMP is in agreement with the conclusions of the MAH. The justification for not performing a full 
user consultation on the package leaflet is considered acceptable.
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Evkeeza (evinacumab) is still (since July 
2021) included in the additional monitoring list as: 




It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU;
It is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 
January 2011;
It has a PASS imposed either at the time of authorisation or afterwards; [REG Art 9(4)(cb), 
Art 10a(1)(a), DIR Art 21a(b), Art 22a(1)(a)];
It is approved under exceptional circumstances [REG Art 14(8), DIR Art (22)] 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic life-threatening condition resulting 
in severely elevated LDL-C (> 13mmol/L) leading to premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and, in 
untreated patients, premature death. The prevalence of HoFH is estimated 1/160,000 to 1/320,000 
patients worldwide.
If left untreated, HoFH patients rarely live past the first or second decade of life, with one study 
indicating the mean age of the first ASCVD event at 12.8 years and an average age of ASCVD death of 
17.7 years (Raal 2011). Further, a recent retrospective study in Italian and Chinese patients with HoFH 
showed that despite starting lipid-lowering treatments early (mean age of 5.6 year, Italian cohort, and 
10.7 year, Chinese cohort), 22% (Italian cohort) and 45% (Chinese cohort) of the patients had a CVD 
event before age 20 and 16.7% (Italian cohort) and 31.8% (Chinese cohort) had died before age 21 
(Stefanutti 2019).
The goal of therapy in patients with HoFH is to reduce LDL-C, thereby reducing atherogenesis and 
subsequently reducing CVD events and mortality. Currently, patients with HoFH tend to be treated with 
multiple lipid-lowering therapies (LLT) but are not able to achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C 
targets. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 92/103
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Attempts to lower cholesterol levels often require multiple lipid-lowering drugs and LDL apheresis. 
Despite these therapies, a majority of patients with this disorder does not reach guideline-
recommended LDL cholesterol levels. Patients with HoFH are often treated with multiple lipid-lowering 
treatments (LLTs) including statins, evolocumab, ezetimibe, and lipid apheresis; however, these 
treatments are largely ineffective for patients either due to LDLR mutations, problems with tolerability, 
and/or they are not available for the paediatric population.
Statin therapy is the cornerstone treatment for LDL-C lowering in the paediatric population aged 6 
years and older and causes a 50% reduction in patients with HeFH, however only a 15-30% 
reduction in LDL-C is reached in patients with HoFH. The safety and efficacy of ezetimibe in children 
with HoFH aged less than 18 years have not been established. Further, lomitapide is not approved for 
use in paediatric patients. 
Evolocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor, is indicated for paediatric HoFH patients aged 10 years and older. 
Anti-PCSK9 therapy on top of maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy resulted in a mean reduction 
in LDL-C of approximately 30% compared to placebo. Of note, only evolocumab is currently approved 
for patients with HoFH; use of alirocumab in patients with HoFH is considered off label. 
Apheresis is an important adjunctive treatment for HoFH; a single treatment reduces LDL-C by 55%-
70% relative to pre-treatment levels. However, apheresis may be burdensome, and its availability is 
limited. Also, only a temporal reduction in LDL-C is achieved. 
Liver transplantation can be used to treat HoFH, although it is rarely used and considered as a last 
resort treatment option due to the many disadvantages, including a high risk of post-transplantation 
surgical complications and mortality, the paucity of donors, and the need for life-long treatment with 
immunosuppressive therapy. 
Due to the limitations of currently available treatments, there exists a high unmet medical need for 
new therapeutic options that reduce LDL-C and the inevitable risk for premature ASCVD in paediatric 
patients with HoFH. The unmet medical need is particularly severe for paediatric HoFH patients with 
null/null or negative/negative mutations where currently available LLTs provide little benefit in 
lowering LDL-C and for paediatric HoFH patients who lack treatment options.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The paediatric development program in line with the approved EF PIP, EMEA-002298-PIP01-17-M05 
(PIP decision number P/0087/2023) as also indicated by the partial compliance check by the EMA 
(EMA/145021/2023). EMA decision dated 16 May 2023: Studies R1500-CL-17100 and R1500-CL- 1719 
are confirmed to be compliant as set out in the EMA's Decision (P/0087/2023) of 10 March 2023.
Study R1500-CL-17100 is an ongoing 3-part, phase 1b/3 single-arm open-label study evaluating the 
efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W evinacumab in a total of 20 paediatric 
patients with HoFH aged ≥5 to <12 years, on top of maximal stable lipid lowering therapy. The study 
composed of 3 parts: Part A (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics [PK/PD]), Part B (24-week primary 
efficacy and safety) and Part C (48-week treatment period and 24-week follow-up period).
The results of the pivotal phase 1b/3 study R1500-CL-17100 was supplemented with efficacy and 
safety results from updated interim analysis of the ongoing open-label study R1500-CL-1719 in HoFH 
adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, and an extrapolation analysis (including population 
PK, population PK/PD, and simulation analyses).
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 93/103
3.2.  Extrapolation
To support use of evinacumab in patients ≥5 to <12 years of age with HoFH, an extrapolation analysis 
(including population PK, population PK/PD), and simulations analyses) has been conducted. 
There are several considerations that justify the overall approach to extrapolate efficacy from adults as 
outlined in outlined in the CHMP “Reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of 
medicines for paediatrics” (EMA/189724/2018) and the draft “ICH guideline E11A on paediatric 
extrapolation” (EMA/CHMP/ICH/205218/2022). Development of a paediatric extrapolation concept 
requires an understanding of the factors that influence the similarity of disease, the pharmacology of 
the drug and the response to therapy as well as the safety of use in all the relevant populations. 
Disease similarity
HoFH is an ultra-rare and serious genetic condition, which requires early diagnosis and treatment 
beginning in infancy for the best outcomes. The of the hypercholesterolemia observed in patients with 
HoFH is the same for both adult and paediatric patients. Hypercholesterolemia is a consequence of the 
abnormal lipoprotein metabolism due to mutations in the key genes, mutations in the low-density 
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene and less frequently by mutations in the proprotein convertase 
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and LDL receptor adaptor protein 1 
(LDLRAP1) genes, and the markedly diminished hepatic LDL-C clearance from plasma. Additional 
phenotypic characteristics include premature CVD, aortic valve disease, and tendon xanthomas in the 
hands and Achilles’ tendons.
As the aetiology of HoFH is the same for both adult and paediatric patients, the overarching goal of 
therapy is also the same, to lower LDL-C, and subsequently the risk of ASCVD:
•
The EAS/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) consensus panel on FH recommends initiation of 
lipid-lowering therapy in patients with HoFH as soon as possible after diagnosis, with the goal of 
reducing  LDL-C levels to <2.5 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) in adults or <3.5 mmol/L (<135mg/dL) in 
children (Cuchel et al., 2014; Wiegman et al., 2015). 
•
The ESC/EAS Consensus panel recommends that in patients with FH and at very high risk, an LDL-
C reduction of at least 50% and an LDL-C goal of  <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL) should be considered 
(Mach et al., 2020). 
Similar drug pharmacology
The extrapolation study showed that patients achieve steady-state evinacumab concentrations that are 
sufficient for maximal ANGPTL3 engagement, resulting in comparable LDL-C reductions across 
paediatric, adolescent, and adult HoFH patients.
In the paediatric population receiving a dosing regimen of 15 mg/kg IV Q4W, PK and PD data 
consistently described a profile consisting of both linear, non-saturable, and non-linear, target 
mediated elimination, consistent with that previously reported for adolescents and adults.
At lower concentrations insufficient to saturate the target-mediated pathway, exposure increased in a 
greater than dose proportional manner. At higher systemic concentrations of evinacumab, sufficient to 
saturate the target-mediated pathway, the PK of evinacumab trended towards a linear and dose-
proportional profile driven by the non-saturable protein catabolism process. Coincident with the 
observation of systemic concentrations sufficient to achieve linear PK, was evidence of maximal target 
engagement, as assessed by total ANGPTL3 concentrations, and a maximal PD effect on lipid 
parameters.

EMA/576403/2023
Page 94/103
The main source of intrinsic PK variability identified by population PK analysis was body weight. Lower 
body weights (including in paediatric patients) showed a decrease in exposure. Model-based 
simulations based upon post-hoc Bayesian estimates predicted that mean steady-state exposures were 
30% (for Cmin) to 38% (for Cmax) lower in paediatric patients ≥5 to <12 years compared to adult 
patients ≥18 years after 15 mg/kg IV administrations Q4W. Despite lower exposures in paediatric 
patients, comparable LDL C reductions were observed and predicted by the population PK/PD model in 
paediatric, adolescent, and adult populations at week 24, supporting the 15 mg/kg IV dosing regimen 
across these populations.
Baseline ANGPTL3 and disease status (patients with HoFH versus healthy participants) were 
descriptors of the variability in the Vmax of the saturable elimination pathway but had marginal 
influence on evinacumab exposures at clinically relevant doses, due to the pathway saturation. None of 
the other demographic characteristics (age, race, or gender) had a relevant effect on the PK of 
evinacumab.
Similar exposure response
In the paediatric Study R1500-CL-17100, the mean percent LDL-C reductions at Week 4 after single-
dose evinacumab administration in Part A (approximately −26.0%) and Part B (approximately 
−38.3%) were consistent with the percent LDL-C reductions at Week 4 previously reported for adults 
from Study R1500-CL-1331 (approximately −30.1%) and adults and adolescents from the DBTP of 
Study R1500-CL-1629 (approximately −39.6%). Multiple dose administration of evinacumab 15 mg/kg 
IV Q4W over 24 weeks in the paediatric population resulted in lower steady-state evinacumab 
concentrations relative to those observed in the adult population. Despite these lower exposures, at 24 
weeks, the 48.3% LDL-C reduction in the paediatric population was comparable to the 47.1% LDL C 
reduction observed in the adult and adolescent population in the Study R1500 CL-1629 DBTP, 
suggesting that the steady-state evinacumab concentrations in paediatric patients were sufficient to 
achieve maximal target engagement. 
Similarity of treatment response across age groups was also demonstrated using model-based 
simulations to estimate the percentage of patients predicted to achieve LDL-C concentrations <2.8 
mmol/L (or <110 mg/dL) and <3.4 mmol/L (or <130 mg/dL) by Week 24 following 15 mg/kg Q4W 
infusions. The threshold of <3.4 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL) was achieved by more than half of all virtual 
patients in all age and weight groups, despite baseline LDL-C concentrations being higher in the 5 to 
<12 age group (422 mg/dL on average) than in adults (255 mg/dL on average), with the percentage 
of target attainment ranging from 56.4% in patients ≥5 to <12 years of age to 67.4% in adult 
patients. Regarding safety, evinacumab displays an acceptable safety profile in paediatric HoFH 
patients aged 5-≤ 11 consistent to those observed in adult and adolescent HoFH patients.
Discussion
Similarity of disease, the pharmacology of the drug and the response to therapy as well as the safety 
of use in all the relevant populations has been adequately justified based on the totality of the data. 
Therefore, extrapolation of data from adults is acceptable. 
3.3.  Favourable effects
Primary endpoint. Evinacumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in LDL-C from baseline to Week 
24 -48.3% (95% CI  68.8 to  27.8) in paediatric patients ≥5 to <12 years of age, which corresponds 
to an absolute mean change in LDL-C of approximately -3.416 mmol/L. The reduction in LDL-C with 
evinacumab were observed as early as Week 1 and sustained over 24 weeks. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 95/103
Other endpoints. The LDL-C lowering effect was further supported by the beneficial effects in 
secondary cholesterol measurements (e.g. Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, and Lp(a)). At Week 24, 78.6% 
of the patients had a  ≥50% reduction in LDL-C at Week 24.
Subgroups. The LDL-C lowering effect appears generally consistent among subgroups, including age,  
patients receiving apheresis yes or no (-47.9% and -48.8 %, respectively) and the most difficult to 
treat patients with null/null (-57.2%) and negative/negative (-67.7%) mutations.
Supportive study R1500-CL-1719. The LDL-C lowering effect at 24 weeks observed in paediatric 
patients with HoFH aged 5-≤ 11 years of age in study R1500-CL-17100 (-48.3%) was generally 
consistent with that observed in adolescents of the OL study R1500-CL-1719 (-55.4%) and with that 
observed in the total population (adolescents and adults) in OL study R1500-CL-1719 (-43.6%). Also 
in the OL study R1500-CL-1719, the primary endpoint results were further supported by the beneficial 
effects in secondary cholesterol measurements (e.g. Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, and fasting TGs).
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
Mechanism of action. Although the proof of concept studies demonstrates that evinacumab as a 
human monoclonal antibody inhibits ANGPTL3, which leads to a reduction in LDL-C, the exact 
mechanism of action in HoFH patients remains not completely understood. Based on more recent 
studies, it is hypothesized that especially endothelial lipase (EL) rather than LPL, plays a more crucial 
role in the reduction of LDL-C via VLDL processing. Any potential for liver fat accumulation seems 
unlikely, as evinacumab seems not to interfere in blocking pathways in the assembly of VLDL particles 
in the liver with fat accumulation as a possible result.
Exploratory endpoint. No beneficial effect on cIMT was found, which can be attributed to the limited 
number of patients and the short follow-up of 24 weeks; In 4 (28.6%) patients with matching baseline 
and 24-week follow-up cIMT measurements, the change from baseline was 0.025 (0.0311) mm.
Long-term effect. The mean % change from baseline in LDL-C at week 48 in Part C of -39.71% was 
lower compared with that observed at Week 24 in Part B (-48.3%), which was highly likely due to the 
low number of patients and non-compliance to other lipid lowering therapies. Also, in the supportive 
study R1500-CL-1719, the total population (adolescents and adults), showed maintenance of LDL-C 
reduction of -30.8% for up to approximately 120 weeks (over 2.5 years), although the effect size was 
smaller compared with the LDL-C reduction at week 24 of (-43.6%).
3.5.  Unfavourable effects
Adverse events. During Part A of the study and in the pooled (Parts B + C) population of study 
R1500-CL-17100, a high proportion of patients experienced at least one TEAE (83.3% and 95.0%, 
respectively), which appeared somewhat higher as observed during the initial MAA (65.9%). However, 
the majority of the TEAEs were classified as mild or moderate in severity. The most frequent TEAEs 
were vitamin D deficiency, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and rhinitis allergic (2 patients each (33.3%) in 
Part A and COVID 19 (15/20 (75.0%) patients), and pyrexia (5/20 (25.0%) patients) in the pooled 
(Parts B + C) population. The AEs considered treatment-related by the investigator were reported in 1 
(8.2%) patient in Part A (infusion site reaction) and in 3 (15.0%) patients in the pooled (Parts B + C) 
population (fatigue, abdominal pain and nausea, and dermatitis contact and rash).
In the Pool 3 Adolescent Population and the Total Population, TEAEs were also frequently reported 
(85.7% and 80.6%, respectively), however, consistent to the frequently of the placebo-controlled 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 96/103
studies in the initial MAA (Pool 2)(81.2%). The majority of these were mild or moderate in severity and 
were considered not related to study drug by the investigator.
ADRs. Fatigue was identified as a new ADR and was included in the ADR table in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC.
Adverse events of special interest.
The incidence of general allergic events in Study R1500-CL-17100 (33% and 15.0% in Part A and Part 
B, respectively) appeared higher compared with the Pool 3 Total Population (13.6%) and the placebo-
controlled Pool 2 (~11), however, the events were not serious, did not result in discontinuation of 
study treatment and were considered not related to study drug. So, the paediatric HoFH patients aged 
5-≤ 11 years appears not to be at increased risk for allergic reactions. No paediatric patients 
experienced infusion reaction during the R1500-CL-17100 study. In the Pool 3 Total Population, the 
percentage of patients with an infusion reaction was 6.3% which is consistent with the frequency of 
7.4% in the placebo-controlled studies in the initial MAA (Pool 2).  Infusion site reaction, infusion 
related reaction and anaphylaxis are currently already stated as ADRs in the labelling. Further, the 
safety data, although limited, was not indicative of any new safety concerns related to hepatic TEAE or 
liver enzymes, neurologic or neurocognitive events, glycaemic control or diabetes in patients with or 
without diabetes at baseline, cataracts, pancreatitis, immune complex TEAEs or muscle events/creatine 
kinase elevation.
Serious AEs. The percentage of patients experiencing SAEs in paediatric patients with HoFH aged 5 - 
≤ 11 years was relatively low (n=1 (5.0%)), not considered related to study drug and  lower to that 
observed in adults and adolescents the initial MAA dossier (9.9%), which is reassuring. Also the Pool 3 
Adolescent and Total Population did not show any patterns indicative of a new safety signal; all SAEs 
were considered not related to study treatment, with the exception of a single event of an anaphylactic 
reaction which is already a known ADR from the initial MAA dossier.
Deaths. No deaths were reported in study R1500-CL-17100 in the Pool 3 Total Population in paediatric 
patients with HoFH aged 5 - ≤ 11 years. Two deaths were reported in Pool 3 Total Population (both 
adults), but not considered related to study treatment, and already discussed during the assessment of 
the initial MAA.
Immunogenicity. A low level of immunogenicity of anti-drug antibody has been observed (n=1)  in 
study R1500-CL-17100), which was low-titer, Nab negative and did not affect the LDL-C response.
Laboratory findings. No trends indicative of clinically important treatment-related laboratory 
abnormalities, including haematology, renal and hepatic function parameters, blood glucose, were 
observed. 
Vital signs. There were no trends indicative of important vital signs abnormalities, including 
systolic/diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, growth and pubertal development (Tanner stage) 
observed. 
Tolerability. Evinacumab seems to be well tolerated; none in Study R1500-CL-17100 and only 3 
(1.46%) patients in the Pool 3 Total Population and discontinued study drug.
Post marketing experience. Post-marketing data did not reveal any additional safety concerns; 
however, any details or discussion have not been provided.

3.6.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
Exposure. Exposure data has substantially increased compared with the initial MAA dossier. Since the 
start of the clinical development program for evinacumab till the latest data cut-off, a total of 243 
patients have been treated with any IV dose of evinacumab in either placebo‑controlled or open‑label 
trials (global exposure). Of these, 139 patients had HoFH, of whom 138 patients were treated with 
evinacumab 15 mg/kg Q4W for at least 24 weeks, 120 patients were treated for at least 52 weeks, and 
78 patients were treated for at least 104 weeks. Nevertheless, the exposure data in paediatric HoFH 
patients aged 5-≤ 11 years of age of a total of 20 patients exposed to evinacumab with a mean (SD) 
duration of 51.63 (5.28) weeks of whom 5 patients were exposed to evinacumab for at least 56 weeks, 
remains very limited, which is however expected considering the rarity of the disease.
HDL-C. In the pivotal study (consistent with other submitted studies), treatment with evinacumab 
resulted in a -41.9% reduction in HDL-C at week 24, with HDL-C reaching below normal levels of 0.50 
mmol/L. This is likely due to potentiating of the endothelial lipase with increased HDL-C hydrolysis. 
However, the consequences of the lower than normal HDL-C levels for e.g. cholesterol reverse 
transport are not exactly clear. Further, the clinical implications in terms of cardiovascular risk increase 
is unknown, especially since recent findings challenged a clear correlation between HDL-C targeted 
treatment (increase in HDL-C) and improvement in cardiovascular risk.

3.8.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.8.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a rare genetic life-threatening condition resulting 
in severely elevated LDL-C (> 13mmol/L) leading to premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and, in 
untreated patients, to premature death. Therefore, it is recommended to initiate lipid-lowering therapy 
in patients with HoFH as soon as possible after diagnosis. In children, testing for HF is recommended 
from the age of 5 or earlier if HoFH is suspected (Mach et al. 2020).
If left untreated, HoFH patients rarely live past the first or second decade of life, with one study 
indicating the mean age of the first event at 12.8 years and an average age of ASCVD death of 17.7 
years (Raal 2011). Further, a recent retrospective study in Italian and Chinese patients with HoFH 
showed that despite starting lipid-lowering treatments early (mean age of 5.6 year, Italian cohort, and 
10.7 year, Chinese cohort), 22% (Italian cohort) and 45% (Chinese cohort) of the patients had a CVD 
event before age 20 and 16.7% (Italian cohort) and 31.8% (Chinese cohort) had died before age 21 
(Stefanutti 2019). Despite lipid lowering therapies, a majority of patients with this disorder do not 
reach guideline-recommended LDL cholesterol levels. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for 
additional LDL-C lowering therapies. According to the ESC guideline (2019), the goals for treatment of 
children with FH > 10 years of age should be LDL-C < 3.5 mmol/L and at younger ages ≥ 50% 
reduction of LDL-C. 
In 2021, Evkeeza has been approved for the indication: “EVKEEZA is indicated as an adjunct to diet 
and other LDL-C lowering therapies for the treatment of adults and adolescent patients aged 12 years 
and older with HoFH as a MA under exceptional circumstances. A non-interventional post-authorisation 
safety study (PASS) was requested at the time in order to generate confirmatory data on the 
cardiovascular implications of treating these patients with evinacumab.
This extension of the indication is based on interim results from an ongoing Phase 1b/3 single-arm, 
open-label study R1500-CL-17100 in paediatric (≥5 to <12 years) patients with HoFH, supplemented 
with supportive information from an updated interim analysis of an ongoing open-label study R1500-
CL-1719 in adolescent (and adult) patients with HoFH, and an extrapolation analysis (including 
population PK, population PK/PD, and simulation analyses) to include treatment paediatric HoFH 
patients aged 5 to ≤ 11 years. The paediatric development program is in line with the approved EF 
PIP, EMEA-002298-PIP01-17-M05 (PIP decision number P/0087/2023) as also indicated by the partial 
compliance check by the EMA (EMA/145021/2023). EMA decision dated 16 May 2023: Studies R1500-
CL-17100 and R1500-CL- 1719 are confirmed to be compliant as set out in the EMA's Decision 
(P/0087/2023) of 10 March 2023. Evinacumab demonstrated a substantial reduction in LDL-C from 
baseline to Week 24 of -48.3% (95% CI:  68.8 to 27.8) in paediatric patients ≥5 to <12 years of age 
on top of maximally stable lipid lowering therapies including statins, ezetimibe, lomitapide, and 
lipoprotein apheresis, which corresponds to an absolute mean change in LDL-C of approximately -
3.416 mmol/L. The reductions in LDL-C with evinacumab were observed as early as Week 1 and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 99/103
sustained over 24 weeks. The changes in LDL-C are considered to be clinically relevant as LDL-C is an 
important surrogate endpoint with potential benefits in terms of cardiovascular outcome. The degree of 
reduction was comparable to that observed in adult and adolescent patients evaluated in the initial 
MAA. The longer-term period demonstrated maintenance of effect, although the effect size at week 48 
in Part C of -39.71% was lower compared with that observed at week 24 in part B most likely due to 
the small number of patients who contributed to this data (Part C is still ongoing) and reduced 
compliance to concomitant lipid lowering therapies. However, the LDL-C lowering effect is still 
considered clinically relevant. The LDL-C lowering effect appears generally consistent among 
subgroups, including age, patients receiving apheresis yes or no (-47.9% and -48.8 %, respectively) 
and the most difficult to treat patients with null/null (-57.2%) and negative/negative (-67.7%) 
mutations. Further, the LDL-C lowering effect was further supported by the beneficial effects in 
secondary cholesterol measurements (e.g. Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-C, and Lp(a)).
However, consistent with submitted studies in the initial MAA, treatment with evinacumab also 
demonstrated a substantial decrease in HDL-C (- 41.9%) to less than normal levels of HDL-C, for 
which the clinical consequences are currently not clear, especially in the setting of the HoFH 
population. The consequences for e.g. reverse cholesterol transport, and any potential causative 
relation to CV risk remains uncertain. Although recent understanding challenges the reverse 
relationship between HDL-C increase and CV risk reduction, some evidence (but not all e.g. gene 
associated low HDL-C levels) suggest that low levels of HDL-C have been associated with CV risk. 
Some reassurance has been provided based on effects as seen in ANGPTL3 loss-of-function patients; 
however, extrapolation to the HoFH population seems complex due to phenotype differences. Overall, 
the lowering of HDL-C by evinacumab may likely not importantly offset the potential CV benefits from 
substantial lowering of LDL-C in these patients at very high cardiovascular risk, although special efforts 
still have to be made to better understand the CV impact of evinacumab treatment by the conduction 
of the requested PASS study in light of the MAA under exceptional circumstances, in which the 
atherosclerosis process over time in patients with HoFH who are treated with evinacumab and undergo 
cardiac imaging will be evaluated. Moreover, the Applicant is proposing to adjust the age range of this 
PASS to align with the indication, thereby including patients aged 5 years and above, which is 
considered appropriate. The Applicant committed to providing a revised protocol of the PASS UX858-
CL401 be within 3 months of positive CHMP opinion of the present extension of indication application.
The safety data of evinacumab in paediatric HoFH patients aged 5 -≤ 11 years is generally limited both 
in terms of number (n=20) as well as duration of treatment (only 5 patients were exposed for at least 
56 weeks. The limited number of patients is expected considering the rarity of the disease. 
Nevertheless, the ongoing Part C of the pivotal study will provide some additional data to further 
address this as well as the already mentioned PASS study which has evaluation of long-term safety 
outcomes as one of the objectives and the age range will be adjusted to HoFH patients aged 5 years 
and above. Overall, evinacumab displays an acceptable safety profile in paediatric HoFH patients aged 
5-≤ 11 consistent to those observed in adult and adolescent HoFH patients, with very patients 
discontinuing treatment. No new safety signal has been identified with the exception of a new ADR 
fatigue which was included in the ADR table of section 4.8 of the SmPC.
3.8.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
Evinacumab has demonstrated a substantial and clinically meaningful reduction in LDL-C in paediatric 
HoFH patients aged 5-≤11 years on top of existing lipid lowering therapy options including statins, 
ezetimibe, lomitapide, and lipoprotein apheresis, which could likely address the high unmet medical 
need for these patients. Although a substantial decrease in HDL-C (- 41.9%) to less than normal levels 
of HDL-C were observed as also noted and discussed in the initial MAA, for which the clinical 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/576403/2023
Page 100/103
consequences are currently not clear. It was considered that the lowering of HDL-C by evinacumab 
may likely not importantly offset the potential CV benefits from substantial lowering of LDL-C in these 
patients at very high cardiovascular risk. Evinacumab 15 mg/kg administered every 4 weeks by 
infusion has an acceptable safety profile and is well-tolerated, which is considered important for an 
intended lifelong treatment. The Benefit Risk balance is positive  in the extended indication with 
treatment of patients from 5 years and older, although uncertainties remain, and further data will be 
provided post-approval to address these. 
3.8.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance
None.
3.9.  Conclusions
The overall Benefit Risk balance of evinacumab for paediatric HoFH patients aged 5-≤11 years is 
positive.

Extension of indication to include the treatment of paediatric patients with homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) aged 5 years and older for EVKEEZA, based on interim results from 
study R1500-CL-17100, as well as supportive information from an updated interim analysis of study 
R1500-CL-1719, and an extrapolation analysis (including population PK, population PK/PD, and 
simulation analyses). R1500-CL-17100 is an ongoing multicentre, three-part, single-arm, open-label 
study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of evinacumab in paediatric patients aged ≥ 5 to 
11 years with HoFH. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Annex II and the Package Leaflet are updated in accordance. Version 1.2 of the RMP was agreed 
during the procedure. In addition, the marketing authorisation holder took the opportunity to introduce 
minor editorial changes to the PI. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template 
version 10.3.
Amendments to the marketing authorisation
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the

commercially confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification 
by 24 November 2023. The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the 
EMA website at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/heads-medicines-
agencies/european-medicines-agency-guidance-document-identification-commercially-
confidential-information_en.pdf
In addition, should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains personal data, please 
provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of these data in “track changes” 
and with detailed justification by 24 November 2023. We would like to remind you that, according 
to Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, “GDPR”) 
‘personal data’ means any information, relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (the 
‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, 
in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, 
an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, 
mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
It is important to clarify that pseudonymised data are also considered personal data. According to 
Article 4(5) of GDPR pseudonymisation means that personal data is processed in a manner that 
the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of 
additional information (e.g. key-coded data). 
Accordingly, the name and the patient identification number are two examples of personal data 
which may relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. The definitions also encompass 
for instance: office e-mail address or phone number of a company, data concerning health, e.g. 
information in medical records, clinical reports or case narratives which relates to an identifiable 
individual.”

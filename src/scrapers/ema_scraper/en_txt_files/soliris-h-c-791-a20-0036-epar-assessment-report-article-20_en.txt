1.  Background information on the procedure 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) was made aware on 10 November 2011 of the cessation of 
manufacture at Ben Venue Laboratories as a result of findings by the Supervisory Authorities of United 
Kingdom (MHRA) and France (AFSSAPS) and by US FDA inspectors during a Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) inspection of Ben Venue Laboratories, Inc. (BVL) manufacturing site conducted jointly 
from 6 to 11 November 2011. This cessation included manufacturing operations in the three 
operational parts of the facility, North Complex, South Complex and Phase IV. 
This inspection was a follow-up to a previous inspection conducted in March 2011 that had been 
triggered by the European Medicines Agency as part of the increased surveillance of this site. During 
the November 2011 inspection, a critical finding was identified with regard to deficiencies in the quality 
oversight of manufacturing and quality operations. In particular the inspectors pointed out as critical 
that since the last inspection there was an elevated risk of lack of sterility in the batches manufactured 
at BVL. The key issues identified in the North facility concerned recent water leaks in the aseptic core 
and preparation area, HEPA filter failures, media growth, environmental monitoring and facility 
maintenance. The inspectors also identified the presence of particulate contamination potentially 
affecting both the North and South facilities. The investigation performed by BVL did not provide 
reassurance concerning the root cause and the nature of the particles. Taken together, all the 
deficiencies observed in the oversight of manufacturing and quality operations raise questions on the 
overall quality assurance system at BVL, and this is considered to have a potential detrimental impact 
on the quality and safety of products manufactured and released by the site. 
On 10 November 2011, Ben Venue Laboratories announced the cessation of production pending further 
investigation and resolution of issues related to equipment re-qualification and maintenance identified 
by the inspection team. This cessation included manufacturing operations in the three operational parts 
of the facility, North Complex, South Complex and Phase IV, that are listed as manufacturing sites for 
14 centrally approved products: Angiox, Busilvex, Caelyx, Cayston, Ceplene, Ecalta, Luminity, Mepact, 
Soliris, Torisel, Velcade, Vibativ, Vidaza, and Vistide. 
In view of the above the European Commission initiated a procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004. The European Commission requested the CHMP on 17 November 2011 to assess the 
above concerns and to give its opinion on measures necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of 
those products, and on whether the marketing authorisations for these products should be maintained, 
varied, suspended or withdrawn. Furthermore the Commission asked the CHMP to consider if there was 
a need to take provisional measures, notably a withdrawal of medicinal products (or certain batches 
thereof) from the market. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
Soliris was granted a marketing authorization in the EU on 20 June 2007. It is indicated for the 
treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and atypical haemolytic uremic 
syndrome. Soliris is the only approved product for these orphan indications. 
Soliris has 2 manufacturing sites authorised, one of which is the BVL South Complex. However since 
2009 supply to the EU is ensured by the alternative site only, following a decision from the MAH to stop 
using BVL due to GMP compliance concerns. No product manufactured at the BVL site is currently on 
the market in the EU.

Deficiencies observed in the oversight of manufacturing and quality operations at BVL raise questions 
on the overall quality assurance system, which can potentially have a detrimental impact on the quality 
and safety of products manufactured and released by the site.  
On 13 January 2012, the supervisory authority issued a revised GMP compliance certificate for BVL (UK 
GMP 6105 Insp GMP/IMP 6105/16949-0018) affecting the North, South and Phase IV facilities. 
According to this certificate, the BVL site is not meeting the GMP requirements to allow the 
manufacture of Soliris. 
On the basis of the above and taking into account that Soliris has an alternative manufacturing site 
authorised and able to supply the EU market:  
- The CHMP recommends the maintenance of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
(i) The submission by the MAH of a variation application to delete the BVL site from the list of 
authorized manufacturers within the marketing authorization dossier; 
(ii) No Soliris batches manufactured at the BVL site can be released to the EU market by the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder. 
3.  Conclusion and grounds for the recommendation 
Having  considered  the  overall  submitted  data  provided  by  the  MAH  in  writing,  as  well  as  the 
documentation provided by the inspectors,  
Whereas 
• 
The Ben Venue Laboratories site is not in compliance with EU GMP for the manufacture of Soliris, 
•  No batches of Soliris manufactured at the BVL site are currently in the EU market, 
• 
There is an authorised alternative manufacturing site within the Soliris marketing authorisation 
dossier.  
the CHMP recommends the maintenance of the marketing authorisation for Soliris subject to the 
conditions laid down in Annex II of the opinion.

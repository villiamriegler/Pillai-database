Introduction 
A  Community  Marketing  Authorisation  for  Rapamune  1mg/ml  oral  solution  was  granted  by  the 
European Commission on 13 March 2001 for prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients at low to 
moderate immunological risk receiving a renal transplant.  
On 12 April 2002, the Marketing Authorisation for Rapamune 1 mg coated tablets was granted. In the 
pivotal studies supporting the approved indication, the average daily dose (to be taken as a single dose 
in the morning) was about 8 mg. The applicant committed to develop higher tablet strengths in order 
to reduce the pill burden. The 2 mg tablet strength was approved subsequently on 10 January 2003.  
Pursuant  to  Article   2(a)  of  Commission   Regulation   (EC)  No   1085/2003  and  Annex   II,  point  2, 
indent (iii), Wyeth Europa applied with the present application to add a new strength i.e. 5 mg coated 
tablets in order to further improve dosing convenience and patient compliance.  
The  application  does  not  include  a  change  neither  in  indication  nor  in  dosage  recommendations.  
Specific  efficacy  and  safety  studies  for  the  5  mg  tablet  were  not  considered  necessary,  since  the 
sirolimus dose is individualised over a wide range of doses based on target concentrations.  
To confirm the relative bioavailability of the approved 1 mg, 2 mg tablets and of the proposed 5 mg 
tablet,  one  bioequivalence  study  (187-UK)  was  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers.  In  addition,  one 
supportive bioavailability study (179-UK) was included in the application together with 2 previously 
submitted studies (165-US and 186-UK).  
The drug substance and excipients used in the manufacture of this new tablet strength are similar to 
those used in the manufacture of the currently approved strengths.

Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Rapamune 5 mg coated tablets are tan and biconvex. 
The  inert  tablet  core  is  composed  of  lactose  monohydrate,  macrogol  8000,  magnesium  stearate,  and 
talc.  The  tablet  coating  is  composed  of  several  layers  of  coatings  consisting  of  a  nanodispersion 
(containing 
the  active  substance  and  a  stabiliser),  macrogol  20000,  glycerol  monooleate, 
pharmaceutical  glaze,  calcium  sulphate  anhydrous,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  sucrose,  titanium 
dioxide, brown iron oxide (E172), yellow iron oxide (E172), α-alpha tocopherol, povidone, carnauba 
wax and red printing ink.   
This  tablet  strength  differs  qualitatively  from  the  ones  currently  authorised  in  that  it  contains  dl-α-
alpha tocopherol as an antioxidant in the nanodispersion. The tablet colour is tan rather than white or 
yellow/beige tablet for the 1 and the 2 mg strengths respectively. In addition, the sugar seal layer used 
in the 2 mg tablet is not included. 
Rapamune is supplied in PVC/aclar/aluminium blister.  
Drug Substance  
Sirolimus  is  a  macrocyclic  lactone  produced  by  fermentation  of  Streptomyces  Hygroscopicus,  for 
which  a  new  strain  (LL4510)  enhancing  to  have  higher  yield  and  a  more  robust  process  (so  called 
process II) has been recently approved (see type II variation EMEA/H/C/273/II/17). Sirolimus batches 
made by process II have been shown to be comparable to those made by process I. 
A  full  description  of  the  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  has  been  provided.  The 
synthesis,  impurity  control  and  characteristics  controlled  in  the  specifications  are  identical  to  the 
active substance already authorised for the oral solution and for the 1 and 2 mg coated tablets. Batch 
analysis data provided comply with the specifications.

A retest period of 2  years is currently authorized for sirolimus bulk substance. The active substance 
exists in a form of a nanocrystal colloid dispersion (see drug product) and a storage time of 14 weeks 
at refrigerated conditions has already been accepted for it.

Pharmaceutical Development 
This new strength has been developed to improve dosing convenience and patient compliance. 
As for the currently authorised strengths and in order to improve the stability and bioavailability of the 
drug  substance,  sirolimus  is  incorporated  in  a  NanoCrystal  Colloidal  Dispersion  (nanodispersion)  in 
which the drug particle size is reduced to nanometre dimensions in the presence of a stabiliser.  The 
nanodispersion  is  added  to  a  sugar  coating  suspension  (active  coat),  used  to  coat  inert  tablet  cores 
previously overcoated with shellac and inert filler coats. The last coat is the colour coat. 
Sirolimus  is  susceptible  to  oxidative  degradation  in  the  presence of  atmospheric oxygen and  of  iron 
oxide  based  colorants  acting  as  Lewis-acids.  For  the  2  mg  strength,  this  issue  was  resolved  by 
applying a sucrose seal coat between the active coat and the colour coat containing the iron oxides. In 
the present formulation, α-alpha tocopherol has been selected as a true antioxidant to be added to the 
active coat based on satisfactory stability profile and global acceptance.  
As for the 1 and 2 mg strengths, a 2 % overage of active substance is used in the formulation. It has 
been adequately justified due to losses during manufacture.  
All  the  excipients  are  common  pharmaceutical  ingredients,  the  majority  of  which  are  compendial 
grade except 5 excipients, which are tested according to satisfactory in-house specifications. 
Regarding  the  TSE  risk,  compliance  with  the  current  requirements  has  been  satisfactorily 
demonstrated. 
The PVC/aluminium blister is adequately controlled. 
• 
Manufacture of the Product 
The manufacturing process of the 5 mg strength is almost identical to the already described process for 
Rapamune 1 and 2 mg coated tablets apart from the addition of dl-α-alpha tocopherol to the active coat 
and the removal of the thin sugar seal introduced between the colour and the active coat for the 2 mg 
strength only. Satisfactory validation data have been provided. 
• 
Product Specification 
The specifications for Rapamune 5 mg tablets are the same as those currently approved for Rapamune 
1 mg and 2 mg tablets, with the exception of appearance (tablet colour and printing) and dissolution 
(NLT 80% dissolved in 60 minutes). 
The  current  dissolution  method  has  been  improved,  resulting  in  a  more  rugged  test  and  faster 
dissolution. As a result, a single point measurement is proposed. 
Batch  analysis  data  have  been  provided  for  3  batches.  All  data  comply  with  the  specifications  and 
indicate consistent and reproducible manufacture. 
• 
Stability of the Product 
3-month  data  have  been  provided  for  3-production  scale  batches  manufactured  at  the  intended 
production  site  under  long  term  (25ºC/60%RH  -  package  intended  for  marketing),  intermediate 
(30ºC/70%RH - package intended for marketing) and accelerated conditions (40ºC/75%RH - package 
intended for marketing). In addition, 1-year supportive data have been provided under long term and 
intermediate conditions. Photostability studies have shown that the drug product is non-light sensitive.  
The data provided support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SPC.

Bioequivalence 
Process II (see drug substance) was used for the manufacture of the 1, 2 and 5 mg tablets administered 
to healthy subjects in the main bioequivalence study 0468H1-187-UK, while sirolimus used in study 
179-UK was produced via process I. 
The 3 tablets showed bioequivalence under fasting conditions and single dose conditions with respect 
to extent of absorption (AUC) and peak concentration (Cmax) (see clinical aspects). 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance manufacture and control is the same as that reviewed for the already authorised 
strengths. The development of the formulation and manufacturing process for the finished product is 
essentially the same as well. The information presented indicates that the product is manufactured and 
controlled in a reproducible way, and should perform consistently in clinical practice, from batch to 
batch. Stability tests under ICH conditions indicate that the products are stable for the proposed shelf 
life. 
Non-clinical aspects 
This application does not concern any change in dosage or indication for Rapamune. The 5 mg tablet 
differs qualitatively from the previously approved 1 and 2 mg tablets by addition of dl-α-tocopherol 
(Vitamin E USP) 0.051 mg per tablet as antioxidant to improve stability, and a change in pigmentation 
from  brown  iron  oxide  70  to  brown  iron  oxide  75.  These  changes  are  not  likely  to  alter  the 
toxicological profile. Therefore additional non-clinical studies are not considered necessary to support 
the new strength.  
3. 
Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Relative  bioavailability  of  the  approved  1  mg  and  2  mg  tablets  and  the  proposed  5  mg  tablet  was 
explored  in  one  bioequivalence  study  (187-UK),  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers.  In  addition,  one 
supportive  bioavailability  study  (179-UK;  performed  with  sirolimus  produced  via  a  previous 
manufacturing  process)  was  included  in  the  application.  Two  previously  submitted  bioavailability 
studies  (165-US  and  186-UK,  submitted  with  the  applications  for  the  1  mg  and  2  mg  tablets, 
respectively)  were  also  discussed.    Specific  efficacy  and  safety  studies  for  the  5  mg  tablet  were  not 
deemed necessary. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Study  187-UK  was  a  single-dose,  open-label,  randomised,  three-period  crossover  study  in  healthy 
subjects. The subjects received a 10 mg dose of sirolimus during each period as ten 1-mg tablets, five 
2-mg tablets, or two 5-mg triangular tablets. The doses were administered after an overnight fast of at 
least 10 hours and the intake of any food or beverage was prohibited during the first 4 hours after dose 
administration. Study periods were separated by a washout interval of at least 3 weeks between doses 
of sirolimus. Blood samples for sirolimus were collected before and at 0.33, 0.67, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 
48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hours after dose administration.  
Study 179-UK was a single dose two-period, crossover study in healthy subjects. In each period, the 
subjects  received  5  mg  sirolimus  as  five  1  mg  tablets  or  as  one  5  mg  tablet.  Blood  sampling  was 
performed during 144 hr postdose. There was a three-week washout period between periods.

Population studied 
Twenty-four healthy subjects were enrolled in study 187-UK and 22 completed all treatment periods 
and were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Of the 22, 20 were male and 21 were Caucasians. 
Ages ranged from 20 to 45 years (mean 31.5 years) and weights from 62.5 to 99.7 kg (mean 79.6 kg). 
In study 179-UK, 24 healthy, male subjects were enrolled and completed the study.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis and statistical analysis 
The  concentration  versus  time  data  for  sirolimus  for  each  subject  was  analysed  using  non-
compartmental methods.  
Descriptive  statistics  were  obtained  for  drug  concentrations  and  pharmacokinetic  parameters. 
Statistical comparisons between treatments were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pre-
specified criteria for concluding bioequivalence were 90% confidence intervals (CI) within the 80% to 
125% range, or 80% to 120% for the logarithmically untransformed parameter Tmax. 
Trial formulations 
The  originally  marketed  formulations  for  sirolimus  oral  solution  and  the  1  and  2 mg  tablets  were 
manufactured using sirolimus batches made by Process I API.  A new process was developed using a 
new  strain  of  Streptomyces  hygroscopicus  for  the  fermentation  process,  together  with  a  slightly 
modified purification step. Sirolimus batches made by Process II have been shown to be comparable to 
those  made  by  Process  I  during  process  validation.    Process  II  was  used  for  the  manufacture  of  the 
tablets  that  were  administered  in  the  main  bioequivalence  study,  187-UK,  while  sirolimus  used  in 
study 179-UK was produced via Process I. 
Test formulations in the bioequivalence study 187-UK were: 
sirolimus 1 mg triangular tablet, batch 2002B0078 
sirolimus 2 mg triangular tablet, batch 2002B0080 
sirolimus 5 mg triangular tablet, batch 2002B0130 
These  are  the  same  formulations  as  the  currently  marketed  1  and  2  mg  tablets  and  the  5  mg  tablet 
intended  for  market,  respectively.  The  three  strengths  have  the  same  size  and  shape,  but  differ  in 
colour. The active substance is encapsulated in the coating of the tablet.  
Results of Bioequivalence Studies 0468H1-187-UK and 0468H1-179-UK 
Concentration-time  profiles  for  sirolimus  in  the  main  bioequivalence  study,  187-UK,  are  shown  in 
Figure 1. Pharmacokinetic parameters and the statistical analysis are summaries in Table 1.  
It  was  concluded  that  the  1,  2  and  5  mg  tablets  were  bioequivalent  with  respect  to  Cmax,  AUCt  and 
AUC, since the 90% log-transformed confidence intervals for these parameters fell within the 80% to 
125%  acceptance  range.  Bioequivalence  could  not  be  demonstrated  for  Tmax  based  on  all  pairwise 
comparisons.  Overall,  the  results  indicate  slower  absorption  the  larger  the  tablet,  leading  to  a  lower 
Cmax  (although  within  limits  for  bioequivalence)  and  longer  Tmax.  The  parameter  C24h  showed  bio-
inequivalence based on the pairwise comparison of 5 mg and 1 mg. An estimation of the impact of this 
difference at steady state was made, and indicated that sirolimus steady-state trough values would be 
expected to be 24% higher after switching from a multiple-dose regimen of 1-mg tablets (10-mg/day) 
to a multiple-dose regimen of 5-mg tablets (10-mg/day). The mean extrapolated area of AUC0-inf for 
all treatments was 17.0%. However, for 3, 3 and 5 subjects after treatment with the 1 mg, 2 mg and 5 
mg tablet, respectively, the extrapolated area exceeded the generally accepted 20%. In these 8 cases, 
the extrapolated area ranged between 20.4 – 29.3% (mean 23.5%).

In this study, bioequivalence was demonstrated for extent of absorption but not for rate of absorption, 
with the 5 mg tablet showing a slower absorption rate (longer Tmax and lower Cmax).  
The mean extrapolated area of AUC0-inf for all treatments in this study was 18.8%. In 19 (of 48) cases, 
the  extrapolated  area  exceeded  the  generally  accepted  20%.  In  these  cases,  the  extrapolated  area 
ranged between 20.1 to 27.2% (mean 22.3%). 
The MAH discussed a previous interstudy analysis of potential factors contributing to differences in 
rate of absorption for different formulations (including oral solution). It has been suggested that Tmax 
be related to three factors: the type of formulation, the unit dose strength and the number of dose units. 
It was also suggested that a difference in rate of absorption is not important for the efficacy and safety 
of sirolimus.  
Discussion 
1. 
The  slower  absorption  from  the  higher  tablet  strengths  did  not  lead  to  bio-inequivalence  for 
total exposure (AUC) or Cmax, in study 187-UK. Also in study 179-UK, AUC was similar for the 1 and 
5 mg tablets while bioequivalence could not be concluded for Cmax. In both studies, the tendency was 
that  Cmax  was  lower  with  the  higher  strengths,  in  accordance  with  the  slower  absorption  rate.  A 
difference  in  Tmax  is  not  considered  clinically  relevant  at  steady  state  for  a  continuous  treatment.  A 
difference  in  Cmax  has  previously  been  deemed  as  not  clinically  important  based  on  comparisons  of 
bioavailability  as  well  as  clinical  efficacy/safety  of  the  1 mg  tablet  and  the  oral  solution.  (TDM  is 
recommended  after  a  switch  between  tablet  and  solution  since  they  differ  slightly  also  in  extent  of 
absorption). 
The  observed  difference  in  C24 hours  between  the  1  and  5  mg  tablets  might  indicate  a  different 
relationship  between  trough  levels  and  exposure  for  the  two  tablet  strengths.  The  target  sirolimus 
trough  levels  are  within  4  to  12  ng/ml  for  patients  also  receiving  cyclosporine  and  12  to  20  ng/ml 
when cyclosporine has been discontinued. The inter- and intra-subject variability in sirolimus trough 
levels has previously been reported to be approximately 45% and 38%, respectively. A 24% difference 
in  trough  levels  when  switching  between  formulations  can  be  considered  to  lie  within  the  normal 
Rapamune-H-273-X-21 
7/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
variability  and  therefore  the  same  target  trough  ranges  might  be  used  for  the  different  strengths, 
despite the potential difference in C24 hours.  
The extrapolated areas of AUC0-inf in both studies indicate that the sampling period was slightly too 
short for adequate determination of AUC0-inf in some cases. However, the mean deviation from 20% 
was  only  minor,  and  the  extrapolated  area  was  acceptable  for  most  of  the  AUC  determinations. 
Therefore,  the  observed  deviations  are  not  considered  likely  to  affect  the  overall  assessment  of 
bioequivalence.  Moreover,  all  patients  had  detectable  levels  at  the  last  timepoint  (144  hr)  in  all 
treatment periods and bioequivalence was also shown for AUC0-144hr (AUCt). 
2. 
Bioequivalence  studies  were  not  conducted  at  steady  state.    Pursuant  to  a  request  of  CHMP 
(LoQ)  to  discuss  the  significance  of  absence  of  steady  state  kinetics,  the  MAH  responded  that 
multiple-dose  administration  of  2-mg  daily  doses  of  the  tablet  and  solution  formulations  in  renal 
transplant patients were found to be therapeutically equivalent.  
The MAH commented that sirolimus is a drug with a relatively long half-life (62 hours in stable renal 
transplant  patients) which is dosed daily and which accumulates to a very significant extent.  Given 
this, single dose studies are generally conducted because at steady state, differences in PK behaviour 
would  be  more  difficult  to  detect  given  that  most  sirolimus  detected  will  be  accumulated  drug 
substance.    For  example,  if  conducting  PK  comparability  studies  at  steady  state,  it  would  be  more 
difficult  to  detect  moderate  differences  in  the  rate  of  absorption  of  sirolimus.    Therefore,  it  can  be 
predicted  that  differences  that  are  detectable  in  single-dose  studies  may  be  undetectable  and  not 
clinically relevant at steady state.   
Also, the statistically-significantly increased C24hr concentrations suggests that the target trough range 
should be adjusted upward in patients switching from 1-mg tablets to 5-mg tablets.  However, such a 
recommendation would be mitigated by several factors:  
• 
The  increase  applies  most  strictly  to  10  mg  doses  of  the  1-mg  and  5-mg  tablets.    In  practice, 
patients may potentially switch from a combination 1- and 2-mg tablets to various combinations 
of 1-, 2-, and 5-mg tablets;  
A mean increase of 24% in sirolimus troughs is well within the intrasubject variability of whole 
blood sirolimus trough measurements and;  
• 
There is a broad overlap in the current sirolimus target trough concentrations (4 to 12 ng/mL) and a 
potentially adjusted target range (approximately 5 to 15 ng/mL) due to the 24% increase in C24hr.   
3. 
No  food  interaction  study  was  submitted.  Since  the  absorption  of  sirolimus  is  affected  by 
concomitant food intake (slower absorption and increased AUC) a difference in food effect might lead 
to altered exposure in a patient consistently taking Rapamune with food and switching from the lower 
strengths  to  the  5 mg  tablet  to  achieve  the  same  dose.  It  is  however  recognised  that  the  food  effect 
might  be  considered  relatively  small,  and  that  switching  between  tablet  strengths  will  not  be  made 
regularly.  Hence,  it  was  noted  that  in  case  a  clinically  relevant  difference  in  food  effect  cannot  be 
excluded,  a  food  interaction  study  and/or  appropriate  recommendations  in  the  SPC  might  be 
necessary. 
This issue was further addressed by the MAH, which asserted that from data already available on the 1 
mg tablet and the oral solution, it is projected that the effect of food on the extent of absorption (AUC) 
of sirolimus delivered by the 5 mg tablet will be moderate.  For the oral solution, AUC was increased 
35% by food, and for the 1 mg tablet, AUC was increased by 23%.  The effect of food on the rate of 
absorption of sirolimus (Tmax) from the 5 mg tablet may be moderately different from the 1 and 2 mg 
tablets given that the rate of absorption differs somewhat from the 1 and 2 mg tablets.  However, based 
on  a  previous  efficacy  study,  which  compared  the  efficacy  of  the  oral  solution  and  the  1  mg  tablet 
(dosage forms with very different rates of absorption), it appears that even potentially large differences 
in the rate of absorption do not affect clinical activity.

Further,  the  switching  of  tablet  strengths  would  most  likely  occur  during  initial  therapy  when  the 
Rapamune  dose  is  individualized  to  obtain  whole  blood  trough  levels  of  4  to  12  ng/ml  and  when 
cyclosporine is discontinued and the Rapamune dose adjusted to obtain whole blood trough levels of 
12  to  20  ng/ml.    Given  this,  any  effect  of  switching  between  tablet  strengths  would  be  entirely 
mitigated by the use of therapeutic drug level monitoring.  
Additionally, the MAH  proposed to include a recommendation in section 4.2 of the SPC to monitor 
plasma Cmin levels after a switch between tablet strengths. This is deemed acceptable, and resolves any 
concerns  regarding  potential  lack  of  bioequivalence  between  strengths  under  other  conditions  than 
those tested in the bioequivalence study. However, the CHMP requested that the information should 
also  be  given  in  section  5.2  of  the  SPC,  in  line  with  the  recommendation  for  a  switch  between  oral 
solution and tablet.  The new recommendation should  be  included also in the 1 mg and 2 mg tablet 
SPCs in a future variation. 
4. 
In  light  of  a  previously  observed  difference  in  effect  of  concomitant  administration  of  CsA 
between an experimental 10 mg tablet and the oral solution (and the oral solution showing more rapid 
absorption  than  the  tablet),  the  MAH  was  also  requested  to  discuss  whether  the  difference  in 
absorption rate between the three tablet strengths might lead to different impact of CsA on sirolimus 
AUC when switching between strengths.   
It  was  clarified  that  the  CsA  drug  interaction  study  (0468H1-168-US)  using  tablets  was  conducted 
with  10x1-mg  tablets  and  not  a  1x10-mg  tablet.  Also,  since  any  potential  effect  of  switching  tablet 
strengths  on  the  CsA-sirolimus  interaction  would  be  limited  generally  to  the  initial  3  months  after 
transplantation, the effect would be mitigated by therapeutic drug level monitoring. 
A  direct  comparison  of  the  1-mg  and  5-mg  tablet  formulations  in  a  sirolimus-CsA  drug  interaction 
study has not been made.  However, it is anticipated that the increased tmax for the 5-mg tablet would 
not be a factor in the CsA-sirolimus interaction. Since the tmax for CsA (approximately 1.5 hours) is 
less than the tmax for sirolimus tablets (2.5 to 4.1 hours), it appears that a typically large dose of CsA 
(300  mg)  could  saturate  the  intestinal  CYP3A/P-gp  sites  prior  to  sirolimus  absorption  regardless  of 
tablet strength and obviate significant effects of Rapamune tablet strengths on the interaction.  
From the 0468H1-187-UK report, it may be shown that the median (min, max) tmax values for the 1-, 
2-, and 5-mg tablets were 2 (1, 8) hours, 2 (1, 12) hours, and 3 (1, 12) hours, respectively.  Based on 
the median, the  tmax distributions among  the  3 tablet  strengths  were very  similar, while the observed 
mean  tmax  value  for  the  5-mg  tablet  may  have  been  skewed  by  several  high  values.    In  contrast,  the 
effect of CsA on the sirolimus AUC during 10x 1-mg Rapamune tablet administration (148% increase 
for  simultaneous  administration,  and  33%  increase  for  staggered  administration;  study  0468H1-168-
US;) far outweighs the effect of the 5-mg tablet on sirolimus AUC (13% increase). Thus, the increased 
tmax for the 5-mg tablet would not be a factor in the CsA-sirolimus interaction.   
The CHMP is in agreement with the argumentation provided by the MAH. Moreover, any remaining 
concerns would be resolved with the new recommendation to monitor plasma levels of sirolimus at a 
switch between tablet strengths.

Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
N/A 
Clinical pharmacology 
The 5 mg tablet strength has been shown to be bioequivalent to the previously approved 1 mg and 2 
mg  tablets  under  fasting,  single-dose  conditions  as  concerns  extent  of  absorption  (AUC)  and,  in  the 
main bioequivalence study, also peak concentrations. The rate of absorption was lower for the higher 
strengths, and there was a tendency towards lower Cmax. A difference in rate of absorption at a switch 
between tablet strengths is not deemed to be clinically important, based on e.g. previously submitted 
data for the 1 mg tablet vs. the oral solution. Bioequivalence between the 5 mg and 1 mg tablet could 
not be concluded for C24 hours in the single-dose study 187-UK, and the difference was estimated to lead 
to on average 24% higher C24 hours for the 5 mg tablet at steady state. A difference in Ctrough levels at the 
same AUC could potentially indicate a different relationship between trough levels and exposure for 
the  two  tablet  strengths.  However,  the  observed  difference  is  within  the  variability  of  sirolimus 
concentrations and should not necessitate specification of a different target trough level range for the 5 
mg tablet. 
It is recognised that the food effect might be considered relatively small, and that switching between 
tablet strengths will not be made regularly. However, since, in the absence of a food interaction study, 
a  clinically  relevant  difference  in  food  effect  cannot  be  excluded,  the  MAH  has  agreed  to  include  a 
recommendation to check sirolimus plasma trough levels after a switch between tablet strengths.  The 
new recommendation should be included also in the 1 mg and 2 mg tablet SPCs in a future variation. 
A previous between-study comparison suggested that the effect of concomitant CsA was different for 
the oral solution (about 80% increase in sirolimus AUC at the recommended staggered dosing) and the 
tablet (about 30% increase in sirolimus AUC at staggered dosing). The difference might be due to the 
slower  absorption  of  the  tablet  compared  with  the  solution.  It  has  not  been  studied  whether  the 
difference  in  absorption  rate  between  tablet  strengths  might  lead  to  different  effects  of  CsA  on 
sirolimus  AUC.  This  issue  is,  however,  resolved  with  the  recommendation  to  monitor  sirolimus 
plasma levels after switch between tablet strengths.  
Benefit/risk assessment 
The quality of the new strength is sufficient. Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between the 1 mg, 
2 mg and 5 mg tablets as concerns extent of absorption of sirolimus administered in the fasted state, 
while the rate of absorption was lower for the higher strengths. The difference in rate of absorption is 
not considered clinically important. However, concomitant food intake has been shown to decrease the 
absorption rate and increase AUC of sirolimus administered as oral solution or 1 mg tablet. From the 
presently  submitted  data,  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  e.g.  a  food-induced,  reduced  rate  of  absorption 
from  the  already  “slower”  5  mg  tablet  will  have  a  larger  effect  on  AUC  than  with  the  1  mg  tablet, 
leading to an altered exposure in a patient consistently taking Rapamune with food and switching from 
Rapamune-H-273-X-21

lower to higher strengths to achieve the same dose. Moreover, the extent of the effect of Cyclosporin 
A on the bioavailability of sirolimus might be dependent on absorption rate. Thus, although the tablet 
strengths  can  be  considered  exchangeable  when  administered  in  the  fasting  state  and  without 
cyclosporin  A  or  other  CYP3A4  inhibitors,  a  recommendation  has  been  introduced  in  the  SPC  to 
monitor sirolimus trough concentrations two weeks after a switch between tablet strengths. The same 
text should be included in the 1 and 2 mg tablet SPCs via a variation procedure. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
benefit/risk ratio of Rapamune 5 mg coated tablets in the following indication “Rapamune is indicated 
for  the  prophylaxis  of  organ  rejection  in  adult  patients  at  low  to  moderate  immunological  risk 
receiving a renal transplant.  It is recommended that Rapamune be used initially in combination with 
cyclosporin  microemulsion  and  corticosteroids  for  2  to  3  months.    Rapamune  may  be  continued  as 
maintenance  therapy  with  corticosteroids  only  if  cyclosporin  microemulsion  can  be  progressively 
discontinued (see Sections 4.2 and 5.1).” was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of 
the marketing authorisation for this new strength.

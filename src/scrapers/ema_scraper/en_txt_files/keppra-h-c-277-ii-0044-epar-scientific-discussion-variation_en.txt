Introduction  
This application relates to new data submitted by the MAH to extend Keppra’s indication to children 
from 4 years of age as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures.  
Levetiracetam  (UCB  L059),  the  S-enantiomer  of  α-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine  acetamide  is  currently 
indicated  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without  secondary 
generalisation  in  adults  and  adolescents  from  16  years  of  age.  The  recommended  dose-range  is  
1000-3000  mg/day  in  a  BID  regimen.  This  type  II  variation  proposes  to  extend  the  indication  to 
children from 4 years of age. Since epilepsy in children differs from that in adults, and adverse events 
of  anti-epileptic  drugs  (AEDs)  may  significantly  impact  the  maturing  CNS,  separate  clinical  studies 
are needed in children (see Note for Guidance on AEDs). 
The proposed dosing regimen for children is a twice-daily target dose of between 20 and 60 mg/day. 
This will be titrated from a twice-daily starting dose of 20 mg/day with the maintenance dose being 
selected  on  an  individual  patient  clinical  response  basis.  Dosage  in  children  40  kg  or  greater  is 
proposed  to  be  the  same  as  in  adults.  Maximum  dosage  in  children  is  60  mg/kg/day.  The  already 
approved  formulations  (tablets  of  250  mg  and  oral  solution  of  100  mg/ml)  will  be  used  for  this 
extension  to  the  adult  adjunctive  therapy  indication.  The  other  formulations  approved  in  the  EU  are 
tablets of 500, 750 and 1000 mg. 
Levetiracetam derived from a research effort originally orientated toward the discovery of GABAergic 
compounds with potential application in various cerebral disorders and only commenced development 
as  an  AED  in  the  early  1990s.  Data  from  a  large  number  of  pharmacodynamic  investigations, 
pharmacokinetic,  safety  pharmacology  and  toxicology  have  previously  been  evaluated  (original  MA 
Application 1999; EMEA/H/C/277). For this extension application, further efficacy and safety studies 
have been undertaken, with particular focus on the safety in neonatal and/or juvenile rats and dogs to 
assess the effects on maturation processes and subsequent reproductive potential of the drug.

Toxico-pharmacological 
The  excipients  used  in  the  final  formulation  are  all  pharmacopoeial  materials  (except  Opadry  and 
Grape  Flavour)  and  pose  no  safety  concerns.  The  limits  set  for  impurities  in  the  drug  substance 
comply with ICH guidelines inasmuch the 2 major impurities, 2-pyrrolidone-N-butyric acid (known as 
UCB L057, itself the main human metabolite of levetiracetam) and the R-enantiomer of levetiracetam 
(known as UCB L060), representing <0.3% and <1%, respectively, have been qualified (as detailed in 
the Quality Overall Summary) and present no safety concerns. The threshold for all other impurities is 
≤0.05%. The limits for residual organic solvents are compliant with the corresponding ICH guideline. 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  ucb  L059  is  uncomplicated  and  similar  in  all  species  investigated 
including  man.  The  metabolism  is  minor  and  approximately  60%  of  the  substance  is  excreted 
unchanged in urine, which is the main route of excretion in both humans and animals. The extent of 
the  major  metabolite  in  man,  L057,  is  somewhat  lower  in  animals  compared  to  man.  No  major 
differences in metabolism between children in the target age and adults have been identified. 
To support the paediatric indication, the MAH submitted four studies: a preliminary 2-week repeated 
dose toxicity study in juvenile beagles (dosage-range finding), a 4-week repeated dose toxicity study 
in  juvenile  beagles  followed  by  a  4-week  recovery  period,  a  7-week  oral  gavage  toxicity  study  in 
neonatal/juvenile Sprague Dawley rats and a study in Rhesus monkeys focused on gross behavioural 
observations of acute CNS effects and intravenous self-administration. 
In  the  original  MAA  for  Keppra,  in  non-clinical  toxicity  studies  carried  out  with  adult  animals  the 
main target organs were kidney, liver and the CNS. With respect to the kidney, it was demonstrated 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44 
2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that levetiracetam  induced  accumulation  of  hyaline droplets through  α2-microglobulin  accumulation 
specifically in male rats. This effect was also seen to be reversible upon cessation of treatment and was 
considered as non-relevant to humans. 
Concerning the liver effects in the adult rat, treatment-related changes consisted of increased weights, 
centrilobular hypertrophy, fatty infiltration, and increased serum enzymes. After long-term exposure in 
the  rat,  the  effects  were  observed  at  clinical  exposure  levels.  The  changes  were  attributed  to  an 
adaptive  change  generally  associated  with  microsomal  enzyme  induction,  a  finding  demonstrated  in 
the rodent with several compounds, and not regarded as an adverse effect of treatment. There were no 
neoplastic  changes  in  the  carcinogenicity  studies.  The  relevance  for  humans  is  considered  unknown 
and section 5.3 of the SPC reflects the liver effects. 
The MAH conducted single dose toxicity studies in neonatal rats and in juvenile dogs and repeat dose 
toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  in  neonatal  rats  (up  to  7  weeks)  and  in  juvenile  dogs  up  to  
4-weeks in order to support the paediatric indication. 
Single dose toxicity studies in neonatal rats and juvenile dogs show a very low order of acute toxicity, 
which is similar to that seen in adult animals of the same species. The liver was the same target organ 
in neonatal rats as it was in the adult rat with mild hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes, attributed 
to proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. 
The  kidney  of  neonatal  male  rats  showed  mild  hyaline  droplet  nephropathy  linked  to  the  short-term 
nature  of  drug  administration.  As  with  adult  rats  there  was  no  effect  of  treatment  on  the  kidneys  of 
female  neonatal  rats.  The  pathogenesis  of  hyaline  droplet  nephropathy  has  been  documented 
extensively  as  a  lesion  that  is  unique  to  the  male  rat  with  no  predictive  value  with  regard  to  the 
extrapolation of risk to man.  
In the dog, transient CNS signs were generally associated with high oral dose levels. No target organ 
was identified at histopathology in juvenile dogs. 
Reproduction toxicity parameters in neonatal rats and juvenile dogs did not identified any  effects of 
levetiracetam that could be associated with adverse effects upon maturation processes or subsequent 
reproductive performance.  
In neonatal rats and juvenile dogs, levetiracetam appeared to be well absorbed as the plasma levels and 
exposure  were  similar  to  those  observed  in  adult  animals  at  equivalent  doses.  Trough  levels  of 
levetiracetam  declined  with  age  in  neonatal  rats.  As  levetiracetam  is  cleared  mainly  by  excretion  of 
unchanged compound into the urine, this finding is consistent with lower glomerular filtration rates in 
neonatal  rats, which are low in  10-day  old rats  but approach adult values  by  7 weeks  of  age. In the 
juvenile dog, no trends were observed with age for trough concentrations of levetiracetam. At doses 
used  in  toxicology  studies,  levetiracetam  generally  displayed  linear  pharmacokinetics  after  single  or 
repeated administration in the neonatal rat. In the juvenile dog while pharmacokinetics were generally 
linear following a single-dose, there was a hypo-proportional increase in exposure with dose following 
repeated administration suggesting auto-induction. 
The  NOAEL  was  considered  to  be  450 mg/kg/day  for  males  (with  a  C1.5h  value  of  244-450 µg/mL) 
and  1800 mg/kg/day  for  females  (with  a  C1.5h  value  of  664-1569 µg/mL).  For  children  receiving  the 
maximum dosage, 60  mg/kg/day, the Cmax and AUC(0-24h) is 73 µg/mL and 427 µg/mL, respectively. 
Using the NOAEL levels, the margin to human exposure in the 4-week dog study was approximately 8 
when  comparing  Cmax  and  11  when  comparing  AUC-levels.  In  the  7-week  rat  study,  the  margin  to 
human  exposure  based  on  AUC-levels  was  approximately  2  and  9  for  male  and  female  rats, 
respectively. 
In conclusion, the newly performed neonatal studies demonstrate that levetiracetam presents a low risk 
of causing adverse effects upon developmental and maturation processes in children at the  proposed 
therapeutic  doses,  and  support  the  following  statement  added  to  section  5.3  of  the  SPC  for  this 
extension of indication of Keppra: 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44 
3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neonatal and juvenile animal studies in rats and dogs demonstrated that there were no adverse effects 
seen  in  any  of  the  standard  developmental  or  maturation  endpoints  at  doses  up  to  1800  mg/kg/day 
corresponding to 30 times the maximum recommended human dose. 
The MAH agreed with the CHMP conclusions and provided Annexes amended accordingly.

Clinical aspects 
4.1  Clinical pharmacology 
The MAH proposed that as a result of new data on pharmacokinetics included in this application, the 
SPC be revised to insert wording relating to paediatric patients in three main areas, as follows:  
- 
- 
- 
treatment in children from the age of four years;  
a statement on interactions in section 4.5 and information about pharmacokinetic characteristics 
in paediatric patients older than 1 month in section 5.2; 
In  addition,  information  on  the  relationship  between  saliva  and  plasma  concentrations  is 
proposed for inclusion in section 5.2. 
Pharmacokinetic characteristics 
Levetiracetam  has  a  fast  and  almost  complete  absorption,  no  food-interaction,  low  protein  binding, 
moderate volume of distribution, and a terminal half-life of 6-8 hours. The drug is eliminated through 
renal  excretion,  including  active  secretion  (66%  of  CL)  and  through  metabolism  catalysed  by 
amidases/esterases to the inactive carboxylic acid metabolite ucb L057. Clearance in adults has been 
estimated to approximately 80 ml/min (4.8 L/min). 
Pharmacokinetic documentation in support of the suggested SPC changes  
Three  standard  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  submitted  where  the  pharmacokinetics  is 
investigated in children between 2.3 months and 12 years of age (Studies N01052, N151 and N01010). 
In  addition,  sparse  sampling  was  performed  in  two  clinical  studies,  (N157,  N159)  and  all  available 
data  (from  the  five  studies)  were  included  in  a  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  (N01139).  Also 
results from a study of the correlation between plasma and saliva concentrations in adults have been 
submitted.  A  significant  correlation  between  saliva  and  plasma  concentrations  has  been  shown  in 
adults and children. The  MAH states that the ratio of saliva/plasma concentrations ranged from  1 to 
1.6 for oral tablet formulation and (after 4 hours post-dose) for oral solution formulation. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Levetiracetam  concentrations vs. time  profiles  were available for 228  patients between  1  month  and  
18 years  of  age.  For  the  basic  model  a  one-compartment  model  with  first  order  absorption  and  first 
order  elimination  was  found  to  best  characterise  the  plasma  concentration-time  profile  for 
levetiracetam, with interindividual variability on each primary parameter and inter-occasion variability 
on  Ka,  and  proportional  residual  error.  The  modelling  was  performed  on  log-transformed 
concentrations.  The  report  was  clear  and  both  the  analysis  procedure  and  results  were  adequately 
presented and discussed. The covariate found for CL/F were (in ranking order): body weight, followed 
by  age  and  BMI,  CLCR  and  dose.  The  resulting  model  is  defined  by  the  equation:  CL/F=K  * 
2.17(Bw/30)0.640  *  (Dose/500)0.0443  *  (CLCR/100)0.111  where  K=1  for  children  not  receiving  inducing 
AED  and  K=1.22  if  children  receive  at  least  one  dose  of  a  concomitant  inducer.  There  was  also  an 
association between Ka and age: Ka=1.46*(age/10)0.27  and a  statistically significant relation between 
V/F and bodyweight (BW); V/F=21.5*(Bw/30)0.901. 
Concomitant  intake  of  other  antiepileptic  drugs  increased  CL/F  by  a  mean  of  22%  and  this  was 
believed to be an underestimation.  
To evaluate the relative influence of the covariates, contribution factors were calculated based on the 
characteristics of the patients in the dataset, divided in six groups. The effect of bodyweight was much 
larger than the influence of dose and CLCR. Therefore, these factors were removed creating a reduced 
model. The influence on clearance by age was lower than the influence of bodyweight. Age was not 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44

included in the reduced model. However, it is not clear whether the performance of a model including 
both age and bodyweight was tested. The covariates for Vd/F were age and body surface area (BSA). 
As BSA has a strong correlation with BW and the effect of BSA was very similar to BW, the latter 
was chosen. The final reduced model was defined by: CL/F=K * 2.18(Bw/30)0.753.

There was no simulation including the variability of the estimates. It is possible that the variability is 
higher in children of certain weight ranges than in other children and adults. In the presentation of the 
simulations, a typical paediatric value is compared with the exposure range observed in adults.  
The effect of levetiracetam on the pharmacokinetics of other AEDs was studied by repeated measures 
covariance analysis. No effect on the steady state trough concentrations of carbamazepine or valproic 
acid  was  observed.  Too  few  data  was  available  for  the  other  antiepileptic  drugs  to  obtain  reliable 
statistics. 
After their first assessment of the documentation submitted by the MAH, a number of concerns were 
identified by CHMP in the area of pharmacokinetics. The MAH were therefore requested to provide 
clarifications on aspects of the PK data submitted. Due to their significance, these PK-related concerns 
(text in italics) and the MAH’s answers to them are discussed individually below:  
-  
As the submitted pharmacokinetic documentation appeared to support that the mean exposure 
of levetiracetam is similar in adults and in children from the age of 4 years (with the exception 
of children with body weights between 40 and 50kg which are predicted to have a higher mean 
exposure), the MAH was requested to discuss the results of the simulations taking into account 
the expected  variability in children.  Based  on  the  simulations  of  typical patient curves,  as the 
dose is titrated and due to clinical indications that the exposure may be unnecessarily high, it 
was  proposed  by  CHMP  that  a  bodyweight  cut-off  of  50  kg  instead  of  40  kg  be  used. 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  comment  on  the  fact  that  the  initial  adult  dose 
(1000mg)  corresponds  to  a  weight  of  50  kg  at  20  mg/kg/day,  and  not  40  kg,  and  adapt  the 
recommended dosage and weight accordingly.

The  MAH  argued  that  the  final  model  of  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  was  used  to  simulate 
plasma  concentrations  that  would  be  achieved  using  the  recommended  dosing  scheme  based  on 
available tablet strengths and the oral solution (Module 5, Vol. 9, Section 5.3.3.5 - N01139, page 36). 
The  aim  of  the  simulation  is  to  get  similar  plasma  concentrations  as  in  adults  after  500  mg  bid  (the 
recommended starting  dose).  Four scenarios were simulated. Two of these  were finally selected  and 
are presented in Figure 2 below.

Weight (kg)
Because  of  the  flexibility  of  dosing  with  a  solution,  a  recommendation  of  10  mg/kg  bid  
(20 mg/kg/day) for children weighing less than 50 kg, and 500 mg tablet bid, similar to adults, above 
50 kg, appears to be an adequate dose adaptation rule since predicted steady-state Cmin and Cmax values 
are within the range observed in adults receiving 500 mg bid. This scenario (#2) has the disadvantage 
of requiring administration of a solution to children weighing up to 50 kg (i.e. age of 14 years). 
Scenario 1 making use of the tablet strengths available predicts most steady-state Cmin and Cmax values 
within  the  ranges  observed  in  adults.  However,  if  the  cut-off  to  switch  from  250mg  tablet  bid  to  
500 mg tablet bid is set at 50 kg, the 250 mg tablet bid is predicted to result in lower Cmin and Cmax 
values  for  children  weighing  more  than  40  kg  than  those  obtained  in  adults  receiving  500  mg  bid.  
The actual dose administered for 40 kg would be 12.5 mg/kg/day, decreasing to 10 mg/kg/day as the 
weight increases to 50 kg, i.e. half the targeted dose of 20 mg/kg/day. Consequently, the cut-off for the 
500 mg tablet bid was extended to children weighing 40 kg (which is equivalent to 25 mg/kg/day for 
40 kg, decreasing to 20 mg/kg/day as weight increase). With this scenario, steady-state Cmin and Cmax 
values were within the ranges observed in adults in most children. But, as expected, children weighing 
between 40  and  50  kg were predicted to  have steady-state Cmin  and  Cmax  values at  most 20%  higher 
than those simulated in adults receiving 500 mg bid. However, the safety of levetiracetam is very good 
and much higher concentrations have been well tolerated in studies N159 and N157. Furthermore, the 
inter-subject variability for the different parameters of the model, leads to a range of concentrations of 
at least 2 fold whatever the dose. Therefore, the slight increase observed for the children above 40 kg 
is not significant.

Hence,  the  initial  recommendation  of  the  40  kg  cut-off  was  based  on  the  fact  that  the  switch  from  
250 mg tablet bid to 500 mg tablet bid with a 50 kg cut off leads to typical predicted concentrations 
that are slightly below the observed concentrations at 1000 mg per day in adults. However, further to 
the CHMP comment, it is understood that the body weight cut-off for the recommended dose should 
be based on the switch from a prescription by mg/kg/day to mg/day, as in adult, and therefore should 
be 50 kg. 
The  dose  adjustment  will  be  made  on  individual  titration  to  the  optimal  dose  and  the  clinician  will 
decide on the most appropriate dosage formulation for the patient. 
As suggested by the CHMP, the above population PK simulations show that a posology of 10 mg/kg 
bid for BW < 50 kg and 500 mg bid for BW ≥ 50 kg yields the best results as compared to adult PK 
data. In the light of the fact that the MAH agreed to the CHMP’s proposal and that the Posology has 
been  adapted  in  the  SPC/PL,  this  issue  is  resolved.  Updated  Product  Information  has  been  provided 
accordingly.

In  adults,  elimination  half-life  is  known  to  be  7  ±  1  hours  after  single  or  repeated 
administration. Elimination half-life was 6 hours after single administration of 20 mg/kg BW in 
children aged 6 to 12 years and only approximately 5 hours after repeated administration of 20 
to  60  mg/kg  BW  in  children  aged  4  to  12  years.  Thus,  the  MAH  was  asked  to  discuss  if 
(especially  younger)  children  could  benefit 
twice-daily 
administration. TID could give less adverse events and better efficacy than BID.  
from  a  more 
frequent 
than 
The  MAH  responded  that,  as  the  elimination  half  life  (t½)  of  a  drug  usually  determines  the 
administration frequency, and since the t½ for levetiracetam in children is around 5−6 hours, it would 
be expected that a three times  daily (TID) regimen  would  be warranted for levetiracetam. However, 
throughout the clinical trials evaluation program of levetiracetam, a highly efficacious and sustainable 
effect was observed with twice daily (BID) administration. These findings are further supported by the 
following data. 
• 
Levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain extracellular fluid of 
rats, and CSF of human. It appears that the efflux of levetiracetam from both the extracellular 
fluid (ECF) and CSF compartments is restricted, with t½ values that are approximately 50% and 
100%  longer,  for  ECF  and  CSF  respectively,  than  that  observed  in  serum.  A  study  in  four 
patients  showed  that  peak  levels  of  levetiracetam  are  achieved  rapidly  in  both  the  serum  and 
CSF  after  a  single  oral  loading  dose.  Levetiracetam  CSF  t½  is  twice  as  long  as  that  of 
levetiracetam  in  serum.  This  may  in  part  explain  the  substantial  clinical  efficacy  of 
levetiracetam during BID dosing. 
• 
• 
A  study  in  12  patients  with  photosensitive  epilepsy who  were  administered  a  single  oral  dose 
(250-1000  mg)  of  levetiracetam.  In  the  nine  patients  who  experienced  a  suppression  of 
photosensitivity, the effect occurred within 1 hour after drug ingestion and was associated with 
blood concentrations of 40–170 µmol/L. Of particular note, however, is that suppression lasted 
> 6 hours (24 – 30 hours in two patients), by which time plasma levetiracetam concentrations 
were very low (< 18 µmol/L). 
A  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  study  of  levetiracetam  in  a  series  of  six  healthy  subjects 
aged 25-38 years. Transcranial magnetic stimulation provides a non-invasive test to assess the 
effect of AEDs on corticospinal excitability. After a single oral dose of levetiracetam 3000 mg a 
time-dependent  suppression  of  motor-evoked  potentials  amplitude  was  observed  in  all  six 
subjects. The effect became distinct at 1 hour and was still present at 24 hours post dose.  
Thus,  the  MAH  consider  that  there  are  compelling  data  to  support  that  levetiracetam  has  a  long 
duration of action that outlasts its blood concentration. These are the basis of BID dosing strategy of 
levetiracetam in clinical development. The efficacy data in clinical studies confirmed that BID is the 
most  appropriate  frequency  of  dosing.  Furthermore,  the  MAH  considered  that  changing  the  dosing 
regimen from BID to TID might decrease the compliance, and also lead to fluctuations due to the fact 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44 
7
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that,  from  a  practical  point  of  view,  it  would  be  difficult  to  give  3  doses  separated  by  8  hours  in 
children.  Finally,  the  MAH  believe  that  this  may  potentially  lead  to  confusion  when  the  children 
would be switched from TID to BID. 
In  summary, UCB  considers  BID  dosing  the  most  appropriate  dosing  recommendation  based  on  the 
following: 
• 
Efficacy seems to be appropriate with BID due to an apparent disconnection between plasma t½ 
and duration of efficacy in the brain (possibly due to a longer t½ in the brain). 
Safety does not seem to be an issue with BID. 
Strict TID (i.e. every 8 hours) is unlikely to be achieved, and, added to the potential decrease in 
compliance, would also lead to fluctuation. 
Change from TID to BID might lead to confusion and errors in prescription. 
• 
• 
• 
The  CHMP  endorsed  the  MAH’s  summary  and  justification  of  the  BID  posology,  although  the 
scientific  data  provided  to  support  a  long  duration  of  action  of  levetiracetam  outlasting  its  blood 
concentration are all related to adults. Significant differences may exist between adults and children in 
this regard, so this information has limited value. Nevertheless, the efficacy data outweigh the PK data 
and a BID regimen is probably preferable for practical reasons. CHMP therefore considered this issue 
resolved.

The MAH was asked to submit the pharmacokinetic report of study N151 and verify which dose 
the reported pharmacokinetic parameters were related to. The MAH was also asked to present 
plots on AUC vs. age and Cmax vs. age for giving a clearer view of the results and the effect of 
age on the pharmacokinetics of levetiracetam and its metabolite.  
The pharmacokinetic report of study N151 was submitted. Graphs on AUC vs. age and Cmax vs. age 
were attached for levetiracetam and its metabolite. The pharmacokinetic results were related to a dose 
of about 20 mg/kg (range 12.8-29.1 mg/kg). The report also displayed graphs on clearance and t½ vs. 
age.  No  correlations  between  age  and  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  observed.  This  is 
expected,  as  a  clear  correlation  between  age  and  body  weight  was  demonstrated  (coefficient  of 
correlation = 0.895) and the doses were adjusted according to the body weight. 
CHMP considered that no trends between age and AUC, Cmax, t½ and clearance were observed for 
levetiracetam.  For  the  metabolite,  no  correlation  between  age  and  AUC  or  age  and  Cmax  was 
demonstrated. CHMP therefore considered this issue resolved.

The MAH was requested to disclose the co-medications used in the pivotal PK study N01052.  
The  MAH  advised  that  summary  statistics  of  concomitant  medications  used  in  study  N01052 
were provided in the submission (Module 5, Vol. 5, Section 5.3.3.3 – Study N01052, pp 87-93: 
took  benzodiazepines,  
Table  14.1.3.1,  and  Table  14.1.3.2).  Out  of  13  patients,  7 
4  phenobarbital,  4  valproic  acid  or  vigabatrin,  and  8  other  AEDs  (hydantoins,  oxcarbazepine, 
gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate). CHMP therefore considered this issue resolved. 
The information regarding children between 1 month and 4 years should be further discussed. 
The MAH is requested to submit the results of study N01052 as plots of Cmax, AUC and t½ vs. 
age as continuous variable.  
Scatter plots of Cmax, AUC and t½ vs. age as continuous variable for levetiracetam using data from 
study N01052 were provided. In this study no effect of age was demonstrated based on either Cmax or 
AUC after administration of levetiracetam at the dose of 20 mg/kg. 
CHMP  considered  that  no  trends  between  age  and  any  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were 
observed. This issue was therefore considered resolved. 
- 
In study N01052, 4 treatment-emergent ADRs were reported for 3 subjects. Nausea, vomiting, 
lethargy  and  eczema  were  reported  for  1  patient  each.  The  ADRs  were  of  mild  or  moderate 
intensity  and  were  considered  by  the  investigators  not  to  be  related  to  study  drug 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44

administration. However, as nausea, diarrhoea and lethargy could be related to some degree of 
fructose  intolerance,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  investigate  the  risk  of  undiagnosed  fructose 
intolerance and to clearly indicate this risk in the warnings section of the SPC for the solution.  
The MAH pointed out that, as part of the recent 5-Year Renewal procedure, according to the Guideline 
“Excipients  in  the  label  and  package  leaflet  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (July  2003)”,  the 
following  statements,  added  in  Keppra’s  Product  Information,  were  approved  by  CHMP  (Positive 
Opinion in April 2005): 
• 
In Section 4.4, “Special Warnings and Special Precautions for Use” of the SPC: 
“(...)  It  also  includes  maltitol;  patients  with  rare  hereditary  problems  of  fructose  intolerance 
should not take this medicine.” 
In  Section  “Important  information  about  some  of  the  ingredients  of  Keppra”  of  the  Package 
leaflet  
“If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your 
doctor before taking this medicinal product.” 
• 
It  was  therefore  the  opinion  of  the  MAH  that  no  additional  statement  is  to  be  added  in  the  Product 
Information. The CHMP noted the MAH comments and considered this issue resolved. 
- 
The “rigid” titration of 20 mg/kg/day every 2 weeks has been used in regulatory studies, but it 
is meaningless in clinical practice where lower increment and longer periods between changes 
are recommended for both safety and practical reasons. The MAH should comment.  
The  MAH  explained  that  the  current  dosing  recommendations  for  titration  in  the  initially  proposed 
SPC were written based on the titration schedules used in the pivotal safety and efficacy study N159. 
The  MAH  agreed  that  this  “rigid”  titration  schedule  may  have  to  be  adapted  in  clinical  practice. 
Therefore they modified the dosage recommendations as follows:  
Children aged 4 to 11 years and adolescents (12 to 17 years) of less than 50 kg 
The initial therapeutic dose is 10 mg/kg twice daily.  
Depending upon the clinical response and tolerability, the dose can be increased up to 30 mg/kg twice 
daily. Dose changes should not exceed increments of 20 mg/kg/day every two weeks. 
Dosage in children and adolescents 50 kg or more is the same as in adults. 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate pharmaceutical form and strength according to 
weight and dose.

This  amended  posology  section  of  the  SPC  is  considered  satisfactory  by  the  CHMP.  However, 
considering  that  no  formal  dose-response  was  established,  the  following  sentence  should  be  added: 
“The  lowest  effective  dose  should  be  used.”  The  MAH  agreed  with  the  CHMP  conclusions  and 
provided Annexes amended accordingly. The CHMP considered this issue resolved. (see page 23) 
- 
An  interaction  with  topiramate  (TPM)  could  not  be  excluded.  Moreover,  the  data  concerning 
lamotrigine were not sufficient to exclude interactions. 
As  requested  by  CHMP,  the  potential  interaction  with  topiramate  and  lamotrigine  was  evaluated  by 
the MAH. 
Topiramate 
To  assess  the  potential  pharmacodynamic  interaction  between  levetiracetam  and  topiramate, 
percentage change from baseline in partial onset seizure frequency per week over the treatment period 
was  calculated  for  patient  taking  topiramate  or  not  and  the  results  are  summarised  below  (Table  2). 
Similar  percentages  of  patients  were  taking  topiramate  in  levetiracetam  group  and  placebo  group 
(29/101,  28.7%  versus  31/97,  31.6%).  In  the  levetiracetam  group,  the  baseline  media  seizure 
frequency  was  higher  in  patients  not  taking  topiramate  (5.1  versus  3.7);  while  the  opposite  was 
observed  in  the  placebo  (4.4  versus  6.8).  For  the  levetiracetam  group,  whether  patients  were  taking 
topiramate  or  not,  the  partial  seizure  percentage  reduction  from  baseline  was  similar,  with  median 
around 40%. However, it is very interesting that patients taking topiramate had much lower  placebo 
response than patients not taking the drug (median 0.3% increase versus 20.7% reduction). Therefore, 
it seems that levetiracetam in combination with topiramate could provide better efficacy benefit when 
compared  to  topiramate  patients  taking  placebo,  suggesting  a  potential  synergetic  effect  between 
levetiracetam  and  topiramate.  However,  there  may  be  other  factors  contributing  to  this  observation 
since  the  study  was  not  stratified  for  topiramate  intake.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  very  few 
patients were on topiramate monotherapy at baseline.

In conclusion, the MAH  believe  that  patients whose  seizures  were not controlled  by topiramate will 
still respond to levetiracetam. There was a higher percentage of seizure reduction in patients receiving 
concomitant levetiracetam and topiramate treatments.  
Lamotrigine 
Results  are  shown  below  in  Table  3.  Similar  percentage  of  patients  was  taking  lamotrigine  in 
levetiracetam group and placebo group (23/101, 22.8% versus 20/97, 20.6%). For both levetiracetam 
and placebo groups, the baseline median seizure frequency was similar in patients taking or not taking 
lamotrigine. Efficacy of levetiracetam was demonstrated in all patients, whether it was combined with 
lamotrigine or not. The placebo response was similar in both subgroups of patients taking or not taking 
lamotrigine.  In  levetiracetam  group,  patients  taking  lamotrigine  had  a  slightly  higher  median 
percentage of seizure reduction (51.6% versus 40.7%).

In conclusion, the MAH believes that patients whose seizures were not controlled by lamotrigine will 
still respond to levetiracetam. There was a slightly higher percentage of seizure reduction in patients 
receiving concomitant levetiracetam and lamotrigine treatments.  
In  the  light  of  the  MAH’s  responses,  the  CHMP  considered  that  no  negative  pharmacodynamic 
interaction between levetiracetam and lamotrigine or topiramate was observed. On the contrary, in this 
small group of patients, a tendency for a synergistic effect of levetiracetam and topiramate was noted. 
The CHMP considered this issue resolved.

The  above  question  was

to  concerns  over 
all  four  patients  receiving  TPM  had  to  reduce  TPM  doses  for  adverse  events  related  to  TPM.  This

Conclusion on pharmacokinetics 
The  preclinical  package  included  newly  performed  neonatal  and  juvenile  animal  studies  suggesting 
that levetiracetam presents a low risk of causing adverse effects upon developmental and maturation 
processes in children at the proposed therapeutic doses. The MAH provided satisfactory answers to all 
of the PK-related questions posed to them as part of the requests for supplementary information. PK 
data are sufficient to support the dose selection.

Main studies 
The  primary  basis  for  the  demonstration  of  efficacy  in  children  is  study  N159.  The  extension  study 
N157 is ongoing, so data have been submitted until a cut-off date of 30 April 2004. Limited supportive 
data are also available from two open-label pharmacokinetic studies, N151 and N01010. An overview 
of the designs of the four studies contributing efficacy data is provided in Table 4 below.  
Table 4. Overview of studies contributing efficacy data for levetiracetam in children  
4.2.1  Pivotal study, Study N159 
[Evaluation  of  the  Efficacy  and  Tolerability  of  Levetiracetam  Add-on  Treatment  in  Refractory 
Pediatric Patients with Partial Onset Seizures: A 28-Week Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Multi-
centre Trial] 
Design: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 28-week efficacy and safety study of flexible 
escalating doses of levetiracetam 20, 40, 60 mg/kg/day. The study was performed at 49 study centres 
in the US and 10 study centres in Canada. Data from one site that enrolled 16 patients were excluded 
from analyses due to significant protocol and GCP violations.  
Patients: The ITT population consisted of 198 patients (100 male), 97 randomized to placebo and 101 
randomised to levetiracetam. The age range was from 3 to 17 years of age, mean age 10 years. About 
70% were Caucasian. No important differences were noted between treatment groups for demographic 
or socio-demographic characteristics. 
Inclusion criteria: Age 4-14 years and diagnosis of epilepsy with uncontrolled partial onset seizures, 
whether  or  nor  secondarily  generalised.  At  least  4  partial  onset  seizures  in  the  4  weeks  prior  to 
screening  were  required,  as  well  as  at  least  4  partial  onset  seizures  in  each  of  the  4-week  periods 
during the 8-week baseline. 
Exclusion criteria: Patients who required concomitant administration of more than two AEDs (except 
for  intermittent  and  infrequent  use  of  benzodiazepines)  or  had  seizures  that  were  too  close  to  count 
accurately. 
Treatment: The initial dose level of levetiracetam was 20 mg/kg/day for the first two weeks, followed 
by a dose level of 40 mg/kg/day for two weeks. If these doses were well tolerated, the levetiracetam 
dose was increased to 60 mg/kg/day for the remaining 10 weeks.  
Evaluation  criteria:  The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  partial  onset  seizure  frequency  per  week 
during  the  Treatment  period  (4-week  Titration  and  10-week  Evaluation  Periods)  versus  baseline. 
Secondary  efficacy  variables  included  response  rate  (50  %  reduction  in  seizure  frequency  from 
baseline),  number  of  patients  in  6  categories  (from  ≤  25%  to  100%  seizure  reduction),  total  seizure 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44

frequency,  number  of  seizure-free  days,  and  comparison  of  titration  and  evaluation  periods. 
Exploratory variables analysed different aspects of QoL and severity scale of seizures. 
Results  
Primary  efficacy  variable:  The  median  percent  reduction  of  partial  (Type  I)  seizure  frequency  from 
baseline  was  43.3%  in  the  levetiracetam  group  and  16.3%  on  the  placebo  group  over  the  entire  14-
week  titration  and  evaluation  periods.  The  difference  between  groups  corresponds  to  a  26.8% 
reduction  of  partial seizure  frequency per week in the levetiracetam group  over placebo (p=0.0002). 
The median reduction from baseline in partial seizure frequency per week in the levetiracetam group 
was -1.6 in the levetiracetam group and -0.7 in the placebo group. 
The  percent  reduction  in  weekly  seizure  frequency  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  3.  The  Treatment  Period 
represents the entire time on study drug, i.e., up-titration (Titration) + stable dose period (Evaluation).  
Figure 3. Median percent reduction from baseline in partial onset seizure frequency per week by 
study period (ITT population) 
These results appear straightforward; however, questions have been raised concerning the robustness 
of  the  results  for  the  primary  endpoint,  mostly  because  of  the  relatively  high,  though  somewhat 
delayed, placebo response. In fact, as shown in Fig. 4, the placebo group had a similar improvement 
compared to the active treatment arm after week 14. Only 2/97 patients in the placebo group withdrew 
due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  as  compared  with  0/101  in  the  active  treatment  group.  The  unexpected 
behaviour  of  the  placebo  group  raises  the  question  whether  the  right  patients  were  included,  and 
whether the results can be extrapolated to the whole population of subjects with partial onset seizures 
between 4 and 16 years of age.

The  Response  rate,  defined  as  the  percent  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  a  50%  reduction  from 
baseline in the partial onset seizure frequency per week during the Treatment Period, was significantly 
larger  for  levetiracetam  (45  patients,  44.6  %)  than  for  placebo  (19  patients,  19.6  %)  [p  =  0.0002]. 
Seven patients (7 %) randomised to levetiracetam were seizure-free during the entire treatment period 
compared  with  1  patient  (1  %)  randomised  to  placebo.  On-treatment,  the  mean  seizure-free  interval 
was 18.4 days for patients randomised to levetiracetam (as compared to 4.2 days during the baseline 
period) and 10.6 days for patients randomised to placebo (as compared to 5.5 days during the baseline 
period).  Twenty  patients  randomised  to  levetiracetam  (20%)  had  a  75%  or  greater  reduction  in 
seizures as compared to 5 placebo patients (5%). 
After their first assessment of the data from study N159, CHMP identified the robustness of the results 
for the study’s primary endpoint as an area of concern that required clarification, mostly because the 
response to placebo improved significantly with time during the whole treatment period.  
To address the above concern, the MAH further evaluated the following three aspects of study N159: 
• 
• 
• 
Baseline characteristics of patients in N159 
placebo responses in N159; and 
maintenance of efficacy of levetiracetam. 
Baseline characteristics of Patients in N159

patients was observed.

In  summary,  the  demographic  characteristics,  epilepsy  history,  baseline  seizures  and  concomitant 
AEDs  of  patients  enrolled  in  study  N159  were  similar  between  levetiracetam  and  placebo  treatment 
groups and were the targeted population as specified by the study protocol.  
To ensure that the right patients were included in the study N159, the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 
the study design  of study N159  were  compared to those in the  published clinical  studies  in children 
with other four second generation AEDs, Topiramate (TPM), Lamotrigine (LTG), Gabapentin (GBP) 
and Oxcarbazepine (OXC). These AEDs are approved in epilepsy children with partial onset seizure. 
As  shown  in  table  6  the  age  range,  numbers  of  concomitant  AEDs  and  main  inclusion/exclusion 
criteria in levetiracetam study (N159) were very similar to the efficacy and safety studies of other new 
AEDs in children. This suggests that the patients enrolled in study N159 were typical patients seen in 
this  population,  the  refractory  epilepsy  patients  with  partial  onset  seizure  aged  4  -  16  years  old,  the 
targeted population for the proposed claim.

Placebo Responses in Study N159 
-  
To evaluate whether or not the placebo response was higher in N159 than expected, placebo response 
for the primary efficacy end point, median percent seizure reduction from baseline, and responder rate 
in  N159  were  compared  to  those  in  the  above-mentioned  studies  with  other  four  new  AEDs,  with 
similar  population  and  design.  As  shown  in  table  7,  the  placebo  response  observed  in  N159  was 
similar to that in studies with other new AEDs.

As the CHMP pointed out, the mean weekly seizure frequency in the placebo group seems to decrease 
through  the  study.  However,  as  discussed  further  below,  mean  is  not  the  most  suitable  method  to 
present  seizure  data  due  to  the  non-normal  distribution  of  seizure  frequency.  Non-parametric

parameters,  e.g.  median,  are  more  stable  and  recommended  by  the  International  League  against 
Epilepsy (ILAE). In addition, non-responders tend to drop out of studies earlier and further complicate 
the issue. Reviewing the data indicated that 10 of 14 prematurely discontinued patients in the placebo 
group were dropped out of study N159 between Visit 4 and Visit 6, and all these 10 patients had an 
increase or no change in their seizure frequency from baseline. Therefore, it is likely that drop-out of 
non-responding patients with higher seizure frequencies led to improved summary statistics on seizure 
frequency on the remaining patients in later visits.  
The Last Observation Carry Forward (LOCF) approach takes into account drop-outs in later visits to 
correct  for  this  phenomenon.  As  shown  in  table  8,  summary  statistics  with  LOCF  approach  showed 
similar median weekly seizure frequency across all visits, including baseline visit, for placebo group 
(4.3-5.9),  while  seizure  frequency  was  consistently  reduced  from  baseline  to  Visit  7  in  the 
levetiracetam group (from 4.7 to 2.7). This confirmed the hypothesis that improved placebo response 
was  an  artefact  of  non-responders  discontinuing  from  study  N159,  in  addition  to  non-normal 
distribution of seizure data leading to skewed means.

Maintenance of Efficacy of Levetiracetam 
-  
The  efficacy  of  levetiracetam  was  maintained  throughout  study  N159  and  the  long-term  follow-up 
study N157. The increase in mean seizure frequency at Visit 7 (to 15.6 or 16.1 [depending on the non-
LOCF/LOCF  method],  highlighted  in  the  Table)  was  due  to  outliers,  as  confirmed  by  the  median, 
which tended to decrease.  Almost all of the increase  in  mean seizure frequency in the levetiracetam 
group  (3.8  of  4.4)  was  contributed  by  two  patients  with  extremely  high  seizure  frequencies.  One 
subject had weekly seizure frequency 121 at Visit 6, and 209 at Visit 7; a second subject had weekly 
seizure frequency 374 at Visit 6 and 644 at Visit 7. As shown in Figure 5, based on the non-parametric 
summary statistics, median and Q1-Q3, efficacy of levetiracetam is maintained over the stable dosing 
period (between Visit 5 and Visit 7), with median weekly seizure frequency even further reduced from 
2.9 to 2.4 between Visit 6 and Visit 7, while mean seizure frequency increased from Visit 6 to Visit 7 
due  to  these  two  outliers.  If  these  two  outliers  are  removed,  the  mean  seizure  frequency  at  Visit  7 
would be very similar to that in Visit 6 (11.8 vs. 11.2).

The  long-term  follow-up  study  N157  showed  that  the  effect  of  levetiracetam  was  maintained  for  at 
least 63 weeks. 
Summary 
-  
In summary, the study design and inclusion/exclusion criteria of N159 were similar to those in other 
AED studies in children. The placebo responder rate in N159 was also similar to that in other AED 
studies in children. The seizure frequencies in the placebo group artificially improved over time due to 
non-responding early discontinuation patients not being taken into account in the summary statistics of 
the  later  visits  and  the  misleading  nature  of  mean  seizure  frequency  due  to  the  non-normal  seizure 
frequency  distribution.  Efficacy  in  the  levetiracetam  group  is  stable  over  the  treatment  period  and 
shows a highly significant treatment benefit over placebo over time. There was no progressive loss of 
efficacy of levetiracetam when observed over more than 1 year.  
CHMP agreed with the considerations in the summary of the MAH’s response. In particular, it agreed 
that  baseline  characteristics were similar in the active group  and  placebo  group. Yet, it is  surprising 
that  “genetic  origin  (familial  epilepsy)”  was  cited  as  one  of  the  most  common  aetiologies.  
True familial epilepsy accounts for less than 1% of all epilepsies (familial frontal lobe epilepsy with 
nocturnal seizures for example). In most cases, some family members have fever seizures or epilepsy. 
Children would then fall into the “idiopathic epilepsies” category, which is not the target population 
for  this  study.  Finally,  some  familial  diseases  such  as  Bourneville  disease  have  a  high  incidence  of 
epilepsy. In that case, the disease is genetic, not the epilepsy.  
The  MAH  was  therefore  requested  to  clarify  why  “genetic  origin”  was  cited  as  one  of  the  most 
common aetiologies of epilepsy in study N159, and whether this meant that an inappropriate targeted 
population had been selected. 
The  MAH  therefore,  to  further  elucidate  the  meaning  of  “genetic  origin  (familial  epilepsy)”  in  the 
N159  study  population,  reviewed  the  medical  history  of  all  patients  reported  as  having  either 
suspected or confirmed aetiology of epilepsy as “genetic origin (familial epilepsy)”. 
The  outcome  was  that  there  is  no  suggestion  of  case  of  true  familial  epilepsy.  Actually,  several  of 
them had a clear focal lesion. The higher percentage of “genetic origin” aetiology of epilepsy may be 
related  to  the  way  the  data  was  collected  and  the  poor  definition  of  the  recorded  aetiologies.  
In particular:

The patients with “genetic origin (familial epilepsy)” included patients with both suspected and 
confirmed aetiologies. Some of these patients had clear focal lesions; 
Review of the medical history did not suggest any case of true familial epilepsy. Therefore, it is 
likely that this finding is the result of a poor  definition  of the aetiology. There is no evidence 
that  this  has  resulted  in  inappropriate  inclusion  of  “idiopathic  epilepsy”  as  suggested  by  the 
CHMP. The study population in N159 was the appropriate target population, i.e. patients with 
partial onset seizures; 
There was no difference in the type of seizures between levetiracetam and placebo groups. On a 
clinical  point  of  view,  it  is  nearly  impossible  to  make  the  difference  between  simple  and 
complex partial seizures under the age of 5-7 years or in mentally handicapped patients. For that 
reason,  it  is  more  accurate  to  analyse  partial  and  secondarily  generalised  seizures  only. 
However, grouping the patients as such would not create any difference between groups. 
Therefore,  in  the  opinion  of  the  MAH,  the  study  population  in  N159  is  appropriate  for  the  target 
population 
The MAH explanations were acceptable to the CHMP, and the issue was considered resolved. 
Concerning  the  types  of  seizures,  the  MAH  states  there  were  10.9%  and  11.3%  of  patients  with 
clusters  of  seizures  in  the  levetiracetam  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  but  in  Table  6,  cluster  is 
mentioned as an exclusion criterion. The MAH was therefore requested to clarify why about 10% of 
patients in study N159 exhibit clusters of seizures if this was considered as an exclusion criterion. 
The MAH pointed out that the precise wording of exclusion criteria in study N159 was “Patient has 
seizures too close together to accurately count (i.e. the patient’s seizures must be countable)” – i.e. the 
clinical  definition  of  “cluster  seizures”.  However,  the  definition  of  cluster  seizure  during  data 
collection in study N159 is slightly different. According to seizure coding guideline for N159, “Any 
seizure that is 30 minutes or longer in duration should automatically be coded as a Type IV (cluster) 
seizure”.  Therefore,  patients  who  reported  Type  IV  (cluster)  seizures  during  the  8-week  prospective 
baseline could still meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria if the serial seizures were countable.  
The percentage of patients with a history of cluster seizures history was similar in levetiracetam and 
placebo  group  (10.9%  in  the  levetiracetam  group  and  11.3%  in  the  placebo  group).  Therefore,  any 
impact should be balanced between the two treatment groups. To assess whether or not cluster seizure 
affected  the  efficacy  assessment,  patients  with  more  than  20%  of  their  partial  seizures  classified  as 
Type  IV  (cluster)  seizures  were  excluded  from  per  protocol  (PP)  population  analysis,  together  with 
other  patients  who  had  major  protocol  violations.  There  were  6  levetiracetam-treated  patients  and  9 
placebo-treated  patients  excluded  from  the  PP  analysis  for  having  cluster  seizures.    The  efficacy 
results with PP population were included in the N159 study report (Tables 14.2.1:3, 14.2.1:5, 14.2.1:8, 
14.2.1:11, 14.2.1:19, 14.2.1:23, and 14.2.1:25). The primary efficacy endpoint and the responder rate 
were analyzed using both the ITT and PP populations and the efficacy results were very similar. 
In conclusion: 
-  
Although about 10% of N159 patients reported a history of cluster seizures, the percentages of 
patients were similar in the levetiracetam and placebo group. The percentage of patients actually 
presenting  cluster  seizures  during  the  4-week  retrospective  baseline  was  much  smaller  (about 
3%).  The  percentage  of  patients  with  cluster  seizures  during  the  8-week  prospective  baseline 
period was 6.9% and 9.3% for the levetiracetam and placebo group, respectively; 
Due to the definition of Type IV (cluster) seizure used in study N159, patients reporting cluster 
seizures  during  the  prospective  baseline  could  still  meet  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  since 
these seizures were countable; 
The sensitivity analysis using the PP population (which excluded patients with more than 20% 
of  partial  seizures  classified  as  Type  IV  seizures  or  other  major  protocol  violations)  showed 
similar efficacy as in the ITT population.

The MAH explanations were acceptable to the CHMP, and the issue was considered resolved. 
With  regard  to  the  placebo  response  in  N159,  it  is  agreed  that  non-responders  tend  to  drop  out  of 
studies  earlier,  and  that  a  reanalysis  of  the  data  using  the  LOCF  approach  showed  similar  median 
weekly seizure frequency across all visits for placebo group (4.3-5.9), while median seizure frequency 
was consistently reduced in the levetiracetam group (from 4.7 to 2.7). The seemingly increased mean 
seizure frequency at Visit 7 in that group was due to two outliers.  
Thus, the apparently improved placebo response over time was at least in large part an artefact due to 
non-normal distribution of seizure data and early discontinuation of non-responders, while the effect 
of  levetiracetam  was  maintained  throughout  the  study,  except  for  two  outliers  at  the  end  of  the 
observation  period.  These  two  outliers  represent  treatment  failures,  but  their  relative  importance 
should not be over-emphasized. This issue is therefore considered resolved by the CHMP.

CHMP considered that, in terms of responders, only limited effect was observed in the 4- 8 years age 
group  (n=57).  Moreover,  the  effect  size  seems  to  increase  with  increasing  age  category,  suggesting 
potential effect modification. Most importantly, results with respect to responders are not reflected in 
seizure  frequency.  All  these  analyses  indicate  substantial  heterogeneity  between  age  categories, 
suggesting that the age category subjects are not comparable.  
This  issue  was  identified  by  CHMP  as  a  major  concern  after  their  first  assessment  of  the  data 
submitted by the MAH, who were therefore requested, as part of the RfSI, to provide explanations and

to  perform  a  subgroups  analysis  per  age  category,  discussing  also  the  implications  for  the  Product 
Information.  
To address this  CHMP’s  concern, the  MAH  performed a sensitive  analysis to  assess  whether  or  not 
age is a prognostic factor for Keppra efficacy. In addition, scatter plots of percentage of partial seizure 
frequency  reduction  from  baseline  as  a  continuous  variable  vs  age  as  a  continuous  variable  in  both 
levetiracetam  and  placebo  groups  were  generated.  These  approaches  were  chosen  since  the 
International  League  against  Epilepsy  (ILAE)  Commission  Report  on  outcome  measurement  in 
epilepsy indicated that seizure frequency as a continuous variable is by far the most sensitive measure 
of efficacy and should be used whenever possible. Responder rate, defined as ≥ 50% reduction from 
baseline  represents  the  extreme  of  data  reduction,  and  being  binary  is  a  blunt  measure  of  outcome. 
Because  dichotomy  at  50%  reduction  is  arbitrary  important  differences  between  treatments  may  be 
missed.  
The  same rationale is valid for the categorisation of age into (<8y; 8–<12y; ≥12y). The grouping of 
patients  in  3  age  categories  based  on  the  arbitrary  selection  of  cut-off  points  at  8  and  12 years  may 
lead  to  loss  of  important  information.  In  addition,  sample  sizes  are  small  in  each  age  group.  Study 
N159 was powered on the entire cohort not the subgroup analysis. 
To assess whether  or  not  age is a  prognostic factor  for Keppra  efficacy, a sensitivity analysis  to the 
primary efficacy analysis was performed adding age as a continuous variable to the model. The results 
indicate  that  age  is  not  an  explanatory  variable  (p  =  0.6380).  Scatter  plots  of  percentage  of  partial 
seizure  reduction  from  baseline  as  a  continuous  variable  vs.  age  as  a  continuous  variable  were 
generated for both Keppra and Placebo groups. Patients above the horizontal “0” line show a reduction 
in seizure frequency compared to baseline. As shown in Figure 7, percent seizure reduction for Keppra 
for  most  patients  was  above  the  “0”  line  and  evenly  distributed  throughout  the  whole  age  range.  
The distribution of scatter plot for placebo (Figure 8) was also evenly distributed through the whole 
age range, and also evenly distributed above and below the “0” line.  
In  conclusion,  the  MAH  believes  that  these  data  demonstrate  a  clear  response  to  Keppra,  which  is 
stable across the whole age range of 4-16 years old, as already demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis.

Figure 8 Scatter Plot of % Partial Seizure Reduction from Baseline vs. Age - Placebo Group 
CHMP  considered  that  the  MAH’s  presentation  of  seizure  reduction  rates  vs  age  as  continuous 
variables  shows  that  there  is  no  real  concern  about  the  effect  of  levetiracetam  across  the  whole  age 
range from 4 to 17 years. It appears from these plots, and from data already submitted, that the placebo 
response is clearly higher for children <8 years of age than for the other two age categories. Although 
no real explanation for this behaviour can be provided, some kind of parental effect may be evoked. 
This observation would mean that it is not possible, based on the small numbers of children in each 
category,  to  determine  if  the  effect  of  levetiracetam  is  significantly  different  from  placebo  in  the 
youngest children, but the study was not powered in such a way.  
Therefore,  as  both  age  categorisation  itself  as  well  as  the  better  placebo  response  in  the  youngest 
children  may  have  created  a  disproportionate  impression  of  heterogeneity  in  response  between  age 
groups, this issue was considered resolved by the CHMP. 
Dose-response 
For  the  101  evaluable  patients  randomised  to  levetiracetam  in  N159,  the  mean  dose  during  the  10-
week evaluation period was 51.6 mg/kg/day [range 16.5 to 79.2 mg/kg/day]. In comparison, mean and 
median doses for adults in the studies that supported the original approval were 34 and 35 mg/kg/day, 
respectively.  This  is  consistent  with  the  differences  in  clearance  between  children  and  adults.  Since 
patients were forced to escalate the dose every 2 weeks from 20 to 40 to 60 mg/kg/day, regardless of 
response,  the  lowest  effective  dose  and  dose  response  could  not  be  determined  reliably.  Efficacy 
analyses were performed based on data from the first double-blind visit when all patients had received 
a  dose  of  20  mg/kg/day  for  2  weeks.  Patients  randomised  to  levetiracetam  had  statistically 
significantly  greater  reduction  in  the  number  of  seizures  than  those  randomised  to  placebo  and 
significantly more patients met criteria for response, indicating that this is already an effective dose in 
many patients. Response based on percentage responders for each two-week interval during the first  
6 weeks of the treatment period was relatively constant irrespective of dose (Fig. 9). However, there 
was a trend towards progressive improvement in the placebo group between visit 3 and 5, as discussed 
above.

Figure 9. 
Levetiracetam  seems  already  effective  during  titration  at  20mg/kg/day,  and  therefore  CHMP 
considered that the dose-response relationship in children had been insufficiently characterised, and it 
was not clear if a further dose increase from the initial dose 20mg/kg/day increases efficacy. There is 
some data suggesting a better efficacy at 40mg/kg/day than at 60mg/kg/day. On the other hand, lower 
doses have not been explored except in study N151, an open exploratory study with a final responder 
rate  of  52.2%  (see  below).  Overall,  a  more  cautious  dose  titration  (for  both  up-titration  and  down-
titration)  than  initially  proposed  in  the  SPC  is  suggested,  except  in  emergency  situations.  This  issue 
was also identified by CHMP as a major concern after their first assessment of the data submitted by 
the MAH, and led to formulation of a specific question from the CHMP. 
In their answers to the RfSI, the MAH agreed that no dose-response relationship of levetiracetam as 
adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  generalised  partial  onset  seizures  has  been  established  in 
children.  The  dosage  initially  proposed  therefore  reflected:  a)  similar  plasma  concentrations  in 
children  receiving  20  to  60  mg/kg/day  as  compared  to  adults  receiving  1000  to  3000  mg/day;  b) 
efficacy in the proposed indication as demonstrated in the pivotal study N159. 
CHMP, however, considered that adult “therapeutic” plasma level ranges are only a guide and not an 
“aim”, and should not necessarily be extrapolated to children due to several factors such as maturity of 
the mechanisms of action and permeability of the blood-brain-barrier. 
Based on the limited clinical evidence obtained by the MAH in children treated with levetiracetam, the 
optimal dose is difficult to establish. However, it should be taken into account that for children, more 
than  for  adults,  the  lowest  effective  dose  is  the  best.  Therefore,  treatment  should  be  started  with  
20  mg/kg/day  and  increased  only  in  case  of  insufficient  efficacy.  It  is  also  difficult  to  interpret  the 
relatively high mean doses (54 mg/kg/day) used in the open-label long-term studies. 
The SPC, however, reflects the need for dose adjustment. Moreover, more cautious regimens for up- 
and  down-titration  have  been  introduced  by  the  MAH  as  a  consequence  of  CHMP  comments,  to 
reflect the concepts expressed above. As already discussed the CHMP considered that addition of the 
sentence “the lowest effective dose should be used” was necessary.  
The MAH agreed with the CHMP and provided amended Product Information, as requested. 
The CHMP also sought clarification on a last point with regards to study N159, requesting the MAH 
to provide efficacy data for study N159 separately for all seizure types included in partial epilepsy, i.e. 
simple partial, complex partial and secondary generalized seizures.

In the MAH’s response to this point, primary efficacy and responder rate were analysed for all seizure 
types  included  in  partial  epilepsy  in  N159  separately.  As  shown  below  in  Table  10,  all  patients  in 
N159 had a history of partial onset seizures. The distribution of seizure types was similar in the two 
treatment groups.

The  primary  efficacy  parameter,  reduction  of  the  weekly  seizure  frequency  per  week  over  placebo 
during  the  treatment  period  was  analysed.  For  Type  IB  seizures,  there  was  a  statistically  significant 
weekly  seizure  frequency  reduction  over  placebo  (31.2  %,  95  %  CI  =  16.8,  43.0  %,  p=0.0001).  
For Type IA and IC seizures, there was a numerical reduction over placebo but the difference did not 
reach statistical significance (For IA 15.6 %, 95 % CI = -19.4 %, 40.4 %, p=0.3286;  for IC 16.4 %, 95 
%  CI  -8.8  %,  35.7  %,  p=0.1787).  This  may  be  related  to  the  smaller  sample  size  and  the  higher 
variability  of  the  response  for  these  subtypes.  The  study  was  not  powered  to  compare  the  treatment 
effect on the seizure subtypes. 
The  responder  rate  by  partial  seizure  subtype  during  treatment  period  was  analysed.  Similar  to  the 
primary  efficacy,  the  levetiracetam  group  had  a  statistically  significant  higher  responder  rate  than 
placebo for Type IB seizure (50 % versus 19.2 %, p<0.0001). The difference between levetiracetam 
and placebo for Type IC seizures was also statistically significant (39.5 % versus 16.1 %, p=0.0386). 
For  Type  IA  seizures,  there  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  responder  rate  between  the 
levetiracetam and placebo groups (61.9 % versus 48.0 %, p=0.3474). This may be due to the smaller 
sample  size  for  Type  IA  seizures  and  to  the  fact  that  this  seizure  subtype  is  more  sensitive  to  any 
treatment effect, including placebo effect, than the other two subtypes.  
In  conclusion,  Type  IB  was  the  subtype  that  occurred  in  the  largest  percentage  of  the  patients.  
For Type IB, both the treatment effect presented as levetiracetam reduction of seizure frequency per 
week  over  placebo  and  the  responder  rate  were  statistically  higher  in  the  levetiracetam  group  than 
under placebo. In the opinion of the MAH, the result of the same efficacy analysis for the two other 
subtypes,  with  smaller  number  of  subjects,  showed  that  levetiracetam  was  more  efficacious  than 
placebo. The difference in responder rate between levetiracetam and placebo for Type IC seizures was 
also statistically significant.

The  CHMP  agreed  that  complex  partial  seizures  (type  IB)  was  the  most  common  subtype  of  partial 
seizures in the study. For this type of seizures, a statistically significant reduction of seizure frequency 
over placebo was demonstrated during the treatment period, and the proportion of 50% responders was 
also significantly higher than for placebo. For Type IA and IC seizures, there was a numerical trend 
for  seizure  reduction,  but  no  statistically  significant  differences  vs  placebo.  However,  this  is 
considered  acceptable,  as  the  study  was  not  powered  to  show  treatment  effects  on  seizure  subtypes. 
The issue was considered resolved by the CHMP. 
4.2.2  Extension study - N157 
[A  multi-centre,  open-label  long-term  follow-up  study  of  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  levetiracetam  in 
children with epilepsy] 
Children who had  participated  in the  previous levetiracetam studies N151,  N159, N1010  or N01052 
could  enter  N157,  an  open-label  extension  study.  Long-term  seizure  frequency  was  analysed  in  180 
patients.  Most  of  these  patients,  103,  remained  on  treatment  for  more  than  1  year.  The  mean  dose 
during the patient’s entire treatment was 52.0 mg/kg/day; most patients were escalated to target doses 
of 60 mg/kg/day and appeared to remain at that dose for the duration of their study participation.  
Patients:  A  total  of  238  patients  were  enrolled,  of  which  223  were  included  in  the  ITT  population.  
As  of  the  clinical  cut-off  30  Apr  2004,  of  the  223  enrolled  ITT  patients,  101  (45.3  5  %)  were 
continuing  study  participation,  and  122  (54.7  %)  had  discontinued.  The  reasons  for  discontinuation 
were lack of efficacy (25) protocol violation (17), withdrew consent (15), adverse events (119, lost to 
follow-up (3), UCB decision (1) and other (50). Other discontinuation included 23 patients with loss 
of efficacy and 8 patients who discontinued because the site was ending participation in the study. 
Treatment. N157 consisted of a Screening phase, an up to 6 week Titration phase for patients entering 
from  the  double-blind  study,  and  a  Maintenance  phase  during  which  patients  could  take  open-label 
levetiracetam. 
Efficacy  variables:  The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  defined  as  the  percentage  change  from 
baseline in weekly seizure frequency over time including the Treatment period.  
Secondary efficacy variables included: 
• 
the absolute change from baseline in weekly seizure frequency over time during the Treatment 
Period; 
responder  rate  defined  as  the  number  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  a  50%  reduction  from 
baseline in the weekly seizure frequency during the Treatment Period; 
the maximum seizure-free interval (periods of greater than 1 week with no seizure activity); 
• 
• 
Efficacy result: At study entry, approximately 42% of the ITT population had been randomised to the 
placebo  group  of  the  double-blind  multi-centre  study  (N159)  or  had  received  a  single  oral  dose  of 
levetiracetam during a PK study (N01052). The other 58% of the ITT population had received up to 98 
days of open label levetiracetam treatment prior to entry into N157. As a result, approximately two-
thirds  of  the  patients  entering  N157  were  seizure  free  at  the  Screening  visit.  During  treatment  with 
levetiracetam, the median seizure frequency per week decreased from baseline for both partial onset 
seizures and total seizures. Approximately one-third (32.7%) of the patients experienced a reduction 
from baseline in seizure frequency per week of at least 50% for partial onset and total seizures. For the 
ITT  population,  the  mean  (SD)  percent  change  from  baseline  was  an  increase  of  51.3%  (453.6)  for 
partial onset seizures and 68.3% (466.0) for total seizures. These results are, however, likely to result 
from a skewed distribution due to extreme outliers. The median values, unaffected by extreme outliers, 
were decreases of -20.5% and -20.7%, respectively. 
For the ITT population, the mean (SD) and median absolute changes from baseline were -2.3 (23.7) 
and  -0.5,  respectively,  for  partial  onset  seizure  frequency  per  week  and  -3.1  (28.2)  and  -0.6, 
respectively, for total seizure frequency per week. The response rate for the ITT population was 31.8% 
for partial onset seizures and 32.7% for total seizures. The highest and lowest response rates for partial 
onset  seizures  were  observed  in  patients  treated  with  placebo  during  N159  (40.5%)  and  patients 
entering N157 from N01052 (7.1%), respectively.  
In  summary,  extension  study  N157  is  still  ongoing  and  the  results  are  preliminary.  The  preliminary 
data do not seem to indicate development of tolerance with long-term treatment, but the final results 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44 
24 
 
 
 
 
should be awaited before a definite conclusion can be drawn. Notably, 48 patients ended the study for 
loss (23) or lack (25) of efficacy, representing in total approximately 40% of patients ending the study.  
CHMP therefore expressed their concern over the difficulty in interpreting the results of study N157 in 
which  two-thirds  of  the  patients  were  seizure-free  at  inclusion  and  according  to  the  definitions  they 
could not have any reduction in seizure frequency (probably explaining part of the results showing an 
increase in  mean seizure frequency  and a  decrease in  median  seizure frequency). In  addition,  it was 
unclear how seizure reduction was calculated for patients that were seizure-free at inclusion but  had 
seizures  during  follow-up.  Therefore,  CHMP  requested  that  for  patients  included  in  N159,  seizure 
reduction  (ITT)  would  be  calculated  in  study  N157  using  the  original  baseline  from  study  N159 
(Weeks 1 to 8). 
In  their  response,  the  MAH  argued  that  for  patients  included  in  N159,  seizure  reduction  had  been 
calculated  in  study  N157  using  the  original  baseline  from  study  N159  and  had  been  included  in  the 
initial submission. However, the relevant information was summarised again, as follows: The analysis 
of  long-term  efficacy  data  is  based  on  only  those  patients  in  study  N157  who  entered  from  study 
N159.  All  study  N159  data  from  Site  55  (N157  Site  419),  however,  were  excluded  based  on  UCB 
Quality Assurance recommendations. 
Data  for  180  patients  who  received  levetiracetam  in  the  extension  study  were  pooled.  Of  the  180 
patients  entering  the  extension  study,  101  patients  had  received  levetiracetam  during  their  initial 
double-blind study and 79 had received placebo.  
Measurements  of  the  percentage  change  from  baseline  show  that  seizure  control  was  maintained 
during  the  extended  treatment  period.  The  median  percentage  reduction  from  baseline  of  Type  I 
(partial onset seizure) seizure frequency in ISE analysis population patients with at least 63 weeks of 
levetiracetam exposure is in Figure 10. The majority of patients remained on levetiracetam for more 
than 1 year. 
The  proportion  of patients  responding  to levetiracetam remained high over time and  patient attrition 
was relatively low. As could be expected, patients who responded tended to remain in the long-term 
extension  study  as  evidenced  by  the  increased  proportion  of  responding  patients  over  time.  
That levetiracetam contributed to the maintenance of efficacy is further supported by the decrease in 
the proportions of patients who respond when they are down-titrated off drug (see Table 12).

Further  to  this  new  presentation  of  data  from  the  long-term  extension,  CHMP  considered  that  there 
was  a  tendency  to  support  the  conclusion  that  the  efficacy  of  levetiracetam  was  maintained  in  a 
sufficient way. 
4.2.3  Study N151  
[A multi-centre, open label, exploratory study of levetiracetam in children 6-12 years old with partial 
onset seizures] 
Design,  treatment:  An  open-label  primarily  pharmacokinetic  study  of  24  male  and  female  patients 
aged 6 to 12 years with partial onset seizures whose past or current AED treatment was unsatisfactory. 
A maximum of one concomitant AED was allowed. After at least four weeks of monotherapy on their 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44

concomitant AED (Baseline phase), patients received increasing doses of levetiracetam with stepwise 
dose  titration  at  10-20  to  40  mg/kg/day  (6  weeks)  in  addition  to  their  concomitant  AED.  
The  Evaluation  phase  lasted  for  8  weeks  at  a  dose  of  approximately  40  mg/kg/day.  Efficacy  was 
assessed  by  the  number  of  responders,  the  The  Hague  Seizure  Severity  Scale  and  the  Global 
Evaluation  Scale.  Safety  was  assessed  by  adverse  event  monitoring,  clinical  laboratory  assessments 
and clinical assessments. 
Results for efficacy: The responder analysis showed that 52.2 % of the patients were responders in the 
intent-to-treat analysis (N=23). The majority of seizures experienced by patients during the study were 
complex  partial  seizures.  The  total  partial  seizure  frequency  per  week  was  reduced  by  a  median  of  
53%.  Only  one  patient  experienced  clusters  during  the  study;  the  clusters  were  characterized  by 
predominately  simple  partial  seizures.  The  majority  of  the  patients  successfully  titrated  up  to  the 
valuable dose level of levetiracetam. The Per Protocol Population analysis (N=l9; those patients who 
were on a dose of 40 mg/kg/day during the entire eight week Evaluation phase as well as those who 
stayed  on  20  mg/kg/day  due  to  a  good  response  to  levetiracetam)  showed  that  63.2  %  of  patients 
responded.  Patients  showed  an  overall  improvement  in  the  Hague  Seizure  Severity  Scale  at  Day  98 
from Baseline (mean change from Baseline, -2.7). For the Global Evaluation Scale, the median rating 
on Day 98 from both the investigator and the parent was a 3, showing that half the patients showed no 
change from Day 70.  
4.2.4  Study N01010 
[An  open-label,  multi-centre,  repeated  dose  pharmacokinetic  study  of  20,  40  and  60  mg/kg/day  of 
levetiracetam in children (4 - 12 years of age inclusive) with partial onset seizures.] 
Design,  treatment:  N01010  was  an  open-label,  multicentre  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  study  in  children 
with  partial  onset  seizures.  Efficacy  was  also  evaluated.  N01010  consisted  of  a  2-week  Selection 
Period  to  determine  subject  eligibility, a  6-week  titration  period,  a  4-week  withdrawal  period,  and  a 
final  visit  two  weeks  after  the  last  intake  of  levetiracetam,  for  a  total  of  up  to  14  weeks  of  study 
participation.  
The  primary  objectives  of  this  study  were:  to  document  the  pharmacokinetics  of  20,  40  and  60 
mg/kg/day of both levetiracetam and its metabolite ucb L057 in children (ages 4 - 12 years inclusive) 
with partial onset seizures; to evaluate the potential interaction of carbamazepine (CBZ) and valproate 
(VPA)  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  levetiracetam;  and  to  evaluate  the  potential  interaction  of 
levetiracetam on the plasma levels of CBZ and VPA. The exploratory objective was to document the 
relationship between levetiracetam levels in plasma and saliva. 
Efficacy parameters: The primary efficacy parameter was the responder rate, defined as the percent of 
subjects  experiencing  at  least  a  50%  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  standardized  seizure  frequency 
during  the  Titration  Period.  Secondary  efficacy  variables  included  the  absolute  change  and  percent 
change from baseline in the standardized partial seizure frequency and total seizure frequency during 
the Titration Period and global assessments by the parent/guardian and the investigator using a Global 
Evaluation Scales (GES) ranging from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). The subject 
provided a global assessment using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (marked worsening) to 10 
(marked improvement). 
Results for efficacy: Only partial seizures were observed during the study. For the ITT population, the 
partial seizure frequency per week decreased from baseline by at least 50% for 9 subjects, a responder 
rate  of  42.9%.  The  responder  rate  was  30.8%  for  subjects  treated  with  CBZ  and  62.5%  for  subjects 
treated  with  VPA.  The  reduction  from  baseline  was  larger  at  40  mg.    In  CBZ  subjects,  the  median 
change from baseline was 0, -0.7, and -0.5 and in VPA subjects, the median change from baseline was 
0.9, -1.2, and -0.3 at Visits 3, 4, and 5, respectively. 
The global evaluations of the subjects’ epilepsy showed marked or moderate improvement for 16/20 
(80%)  subjects  when  rated  by  the  investigator  and  for  15/20  (75%)  subjects  when  rated  by  the 
subject’s parent/guardian. The subject’s global evaluation was ≥ 8 for 7/8 (87.5%) CBZ subjects and 
8/8 (100%) VPA subjects who completed the evaluation. 
Why was maximal efficacy in Study N01010 reached at 40 mg/kg/day? 
-  
Study N01010 was a pharmacokinetic study and inclusion/exclusion criteria was mainly based on the 
need for PK objectives. It was not required that patients have partial seizure at baseline to enter study 
N01010. Therefore, study N01010 was not designed for assessing efficacy. The median percent change

of partial seizure from baseline is presented in Table 13. As shown, the efficacy was similar between 
40 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg in both Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Valproic acid (VPA) groups.

Seizure worsening 
-  
After  assessment  of  the  data  deriving  from  Study  N01010,  CHMP  considered  that  there  was  not 
enough information about the population with seizure worsening, and in particular it was not possible 
to establish whether seizure worsening was dose-related. Additionally, as in Study N01010 maximum 
efficacy is noted for 40 mg/kg/day, the MAH was asked to clarify whether this was related to specific 
co-medication, and finally to clarify whether levetiracetam clearance increased by 22% in association 
with enzyme-inducer medication. 
To answer CHMP’s questions, additional analyses were performed in patients with seizure worsening. 
Seizure worsening is defined as either an increase from baseline in total seizure frequency per week 
over  treatment  period  >  25%  or  at  least  one  treatment  emergent  adverse  event  with  the  following 
COSTART  preferred  terms:  Convulsion,  Grand  Mal  Convulsion,  Status  Epilepticus  NOS,  or  Status 
Epilepticus  Partial.  The  dose  of  study  medication  during  treatment  period,  whether  or  not  taking 
enzyme  inducing  AEDs,  whether  or  not  taking  non-AEDs  potentially  worsening  seizures  were 
analyzed for patients with seizure worsening.  
Is seizure worsening dose-related? 
- 
Study N159  was  not  designed  to look at  the  dose-response  relationship  since  all patients were  to  be 
titrated up to a stable dose of 60 mg/kg/day. Fewer patients on levetiracetam met the criteria of seizure 
worsening  as  compared  to  placebo:  respectively  21/101  (20.8%)  and  32/97  (33.0%),  indicating  that 
levetiracetam  at  high  doses  does  not  increase  the  risk  of  seizure  worsening  versus  placebo.  
In addition, Table 14 shows the dose of levetiracetam and placebo during treatment period in patients 
with  and  without  seizure  worsening.  There  is  no  difference  between  the  doses  administered  in  the 
patients with or without seizure worsening.

What is the effect of enzyme-inducing AEDs? 
- 
To address CHMP’s concern, percent change of partial seizure from baseline in patients who received 
levetiracetam with and without enzyme inducers in study N159 was analyzed. As shown in Table 15, 
the efficacy is similar in patients received enzyme inducers or not.

The relationship between seizure worsening and intake of enzyme inducing AEDs was also explored. 
The  results  are  presented  in  Table  16.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  enzyme  inducing  AEDs  was 
similar  in  the  levetiracetam  and  placebo  group  (47/101,  46.5%  versus  43/97,  44.3%).  As  expected, 
more  patients  in  the  placebo  group  were  classified  as  having  seizure  worsening  than  in  the 
levetiracetam group (33.0% vs 20.8%, respectively). In the subgroup “not taking an enzyme-inducing 
AED”,  the  percentage  of  patients  reporting  seizure  worsening  is  much  higher  in  the  placebo  group 
than  in  the  levetiracetam  group.  In  the  other  subgroup  “taking  an  enzyme-inducer”  the  difference  is 
smaller  but  is  still  in  favour  of  levetiracetam  (25.5%  vs  30.2%,  respectively).  However,  since  the 
samples are small and this study was not stratified according to concomitant AEDs, some other factors 
may also contribute to this observation.

Are there other potential pro-seizure medications? 
Some  non-AEDs  are  known  to  potentially  worsening  seizures.  To  assess  whether  or  not  there  is  a 
relationship  between  seizure  worsening  and  intake  of  pro-seizure  drugs,  additional  analysis  was 
conducted and results are summarized in Table 17. Since the use of these drugs was prohibited by the 
study  protocol,  the  number  of  patients  with  these  medications  was  very  low  and  the  results  were 
inconclusive.

Summary 
In summary, the MAH responses to these aspects can be summarised as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The percentage of seizure worsening is lower under the high doses of levetiracetam compared to 
placebo. 
The efficacy of levetiracetam 40 mg/kg/day is similar to that of 60 mg/kg/day in the PK study 
N01010, although this study was not intended to assess efficacy as inclusion criteria differed. 
The  efficacy of levetiracetam is similar in  patients  who received concomitant enzyme inducer 
AEDs  or  not.  Therefore,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  slightly  increased  clearance  of 
levetiracetam, associated with the use of enzyme-inducing AEDs, results in less seizure control. 
The percentage of seizure worsening is lower under levetiracetam than in the placebo group in 
both  the  subgroups  with  and  without  concomitant  enzyme  inducer  AEDs.  The  treatment 
difference is less pronounced in the subgroup “with enzyme inducer AED”. However due to the 
low  sample  size  in  the  subgroups  and  since  the  study  was  not  stratified  for  this  factor,  these 
results need to be interpreted with caution.  
The assessment of potential effect of concomitant pro-seizure drugs was not conclusive because 
of the very low number of subjects who received these compounds. 
The  CHMP  endorsed  the  MAH’s  summary.  However,  the  MAH  were  asked  to  clarify  the  rate  of 
seizure  worsening  (as  per  the  proposed  section  4.4  of  the  SPC  with  this  application)  in  the 
levetiracetam  group  (20.8%),  as  although  lower  than  in  placebo  (33%),  remains  relatively  high 
compared to other novel AEDs. The percentages for increase seizure frequency were then checked and 
found correct by the MAH. The percentages quoted by the CHMP are for “Seizure worsening” which 
includes  increase  in  seizure  frequency  plus  seizure  related  adverse  events;  e.g.  seizure  worsening, 
convulsions,  etc.  The  corresponding  paragraph  in  section  4.4  of  the  SPC  is  therefore  considered 
correct by the MAH, who believed that it should not be changed. The CHMP considered the MAH’s 
explanations acceptable. 
4.3  Clinical safety 
Safety  results  are  primarily  based  on  the  pivotal  placebo-controlled  study  N159,  with  additional 
information  from  the  open-label  extension  study.  Other  safety  information  includes  that  derived  in 
pharmacokinetic studies, ongoing studies, and post-marketing use. As of August 2004, approximately 
515,000  patient-years  of  marketed  Keppra  tablet  use  are  estimated.  Paediatric  use  is  estimated  to 
represent less than 10% of this figure. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 239 children with partial onset seizures have received levetiracetam in 5 completed studies. 
Of  these,  124  were  boys  and  115  were  girls;  about  two-thirds  were  Caucasian.  The  mean  age  was 
approximately  9  years  with  patients  ranging  in  age  from  2  months  to  17  years;  16  patients  were 
between the ages of 1  month and < 4 years; 63 patients were between 4 and < 8 years; 104 patients 
were between 8 and < 12 years; and 56 patients were between 12 and < 18 years. Additional safety 
information was reviewed for 58 children who participated in other studies.  
Adverse events 
In study N159, the majority of the patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event 
(TEAE):  88.1%  in  the  levetiracetam  group  and  91.8%  in  placebo  patients.  These  TEAE  were 
considered  related  to  the  drug  in  55.4  %  in  the  active  group  and  40.2  %  in  the  placebo  group, 
respectively.  Adverse  events  that  were  more  common  among  patients  randomised  to  levetiracetam 
than  to  placebo  were  somnolence,  accidental  injury,  hostility,  nervousness,  asthenia,  pain,  cough 
increased,  rhinitis  and  anorexia.  TEAEs  that  occur  with  an  incidence  of  >1%  in  the  patients 
randomised to levetiracetam are presented in Table 18. 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 18.  
Some of these adverse events, whatever the relationship with the treatment, are clearly dose-related: 
vomiting,  from  3.4%  for  <29mg/kg/day  to  12.2%  for  ≥50mg/kg/day;  hostility,  from  2.6%  for 
<29mg/kg/day to 9.9% for ≥50mg/kg/day; and convulsion, from 3.4% for <29mg/kg/day to 10.3% for 
≥50mg/kg/day.  Some  of  these  adverse  events  could  be  secondary  to  pharmacodynamic  interactions 
between levetiracetam and co-medications. For example, anorexia is often described in children, who 
receive more often topiramate compared to adults. Some of these children received psychotropic drugs 
for their behavioural problems and again some interactions are possible. Finally, several dose-related 
TEAEs persisted after 48 weeks of treatment. 
Behavioural and other psychiatric events have been associated with levetiracetam in adults. There was 
a similarly elevated risk for these events in children, especially children with neurological problems. 
The  individual  terms  for  which  there  was  a  two-fold  or  greater  relative  risk  in  levetiracetam-treated 
patients as compared to placebo (without consideration for treatment relationship) were, in decreasing 
order  of  incidence,  agitation,  nervousness,  and  depression.  Hostility  (the  COSTART  term  for 
aggressive  behaviour,  aggression,  angry  outbursts,  etc.)  also  occurred  with  a  greater  relative  risk  in 
patients randomised to levetiracetam. Overall, these were more common in children.

A  total  of  126  of  239  (52.7%)  children  exposed  to  levetiracetam  experienced  CNS-related  adverse 
events  that  can  be  considered  disturbances  of  behaviour  and/or  mood.  The  behavioural  events  were 
most  commonly  described  as  hostility  (10.9%)  and  nervousness  (10.5%).  Twenty  patients  either 
discontinued as a result or had a dose reduction and the event either resolved or diminished. A total of 
18 patients had behavioural events that were severe in intensity, including 7 of the patients with dose 
decreases  or  discontinuation.  None  were  serious  adverse  events  (SAE).  The  mood  disorders  were 
described  with  terms  consistent  with  depression,  sadness,  and  suicidal  ideation.  Five  of  these  cases 
either  required  hospitalisation  (in  1  patient  in  which  the  event  was  reported  as  an  SAE),  resulted  in 
discontinuation (2 patients, with resultant resolution of the events), required dose reduction (1 patient), 
or were severe in intensity (1 patient). 
Eight  patients  experienced  psychotic  episodes  while  on  levetiracetam.  Four  of  these  patients  had 
histories of behaviour problems or ADHD, one of whom also had a history of prior psychotic events in 
association with seizures. Four of the cases were SAEs. One child experienced psychotic depression 
after about 3 years on levetiracetam and withdrew from study as a result. The event continued despite 
discontinuation  of  treatment.  There  were  three  cases  of  psychotic  episodes,  described  more 
consistently  as  hostility  and  aggressive  behaviours  than  true  psychoses,  and  one  of  schizoaffective 
disorder. All occurred roughly within the first year of treatment. The patients were all hospitalized at 
some  time  for  psychiatric  reasons  and  treated  with  antipsychotic  and/or  antidepressant  medication. 
There were three cases of hallucinations; none of these was classified as SAEs.  
Overall  however,  few  patients  discontinued  due  to  adverse  events.  In  the  placebo-controlled  trial 
(N159),  5  patients  randomised  to  levetiracetam  (5.0%)  discontinued  due  to  an  adverse  event  versus  
9 patients (9.3%) in the placebo group. Convulsion was a common reason for discontinuation, more so 
in  the  placebo  group  than  in  the  levetiracetam  group:  3  patients  on  placebo  (3.1%)  and  1  patient 
randomised  to  levetiracetam  (1.0%).  The  remaining  reasons  for  discontinuation  amongst  patients 
randomised  to  levetiracetam  (single  patients  each,  1.0%)  were  ataxia,  depression,  hostility,  and 
hyperkinesia. The remaining reasons amongst patients randomised to placebo were ataxia, depression, 
emotional  lability,  hallucinations,  hostility,  and  sleep  disorder  (in  1  patient  each,  1.0%).  In  the 
remaining  studies,  including  the  extension  study,  13  patients  discontinued  levetiracetam  due  to  an 
adverse event. The reasons were hostility (2 patients for a total of 1.3%), convulsion (1 case for a total 
of 0.8%), and single cases of asthenia, headache, left ventricular hypertrophy, vomiting, nervousness, 
psychotic  depression,  status  epilepticus,  and  rash.  One  patient  also  discontinued  to  receive  a 
therapeutic  procedure.  With  respect  to  worsening  of  seizures,  20  patients  randomised  to  placebo 
(20.6%) and 14 patients randomised to levetiracetam (13.9%) experienced a 25% or greater increase in 
weekly  seizure  frequency  in  N159.  Similarly,  more  patients  randomised  to  placebo  (17  patients  or 
17.5%) had seizures reported as an adverse event as compared to levetiracetam (10 patients or 9.9%). 
Across all studies, 54 patients treated with levetiracetam (22.6%) had seizures reported at least once as 
an adverse event, described either as increase in frequency or intensity. Nine patients were hospitalised 
(SAEs). 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In  N159,  8  patients  (7.9%)  randomised  to  levetiracetam  group  and  9  patients  (9.3%)  randomised  to 
placebo  experienced a serious adverse event (SAE). None were considered  by the Investigator to be 
possibly related to study drug other than one case of convulsion in a patient randomised to placebo. 
Across all of the studies, a total of 66 patients exposed to levetiracetam (58 in addition to the 8 that 
occurred in N159) had one or more SAEs. All but one of these occurred in N157; 1 patient in N151 
had  an  overdose.  The  most  common  pertained  to  the  nervous  system  (convulsion,  status  epilepticus 
NOS,  personality  disorder,  depression,  and  psychosis),  reported  for  32  patients  overall  (13.4%). 
Procedures  requiring  hospitalisation  were  reported  for  23  patients  (9.6%).  The  latter  were,  however, 
mostly  diagnostic  or  therapeutic  procedures  related  to  epilepsy,  and  if  they  are  not  taken  into 
consideration (since these are not related to treatment with levetiracetam), there were 50 patients with 
treatment-emergent SAEs. One SAE had a fatal outcome. A 15-year old Caucasian girl had received 
levetiracetam  for  a  total  of  approximately  1  year,  first  in  N159  and  then  in  N157.  In  the  2  months 
before her death, she was noted to have serious worsening of behaviour problems. She was admitted to 
the  hospital  for  status  epilepticus,  thought  to  be  fever-induced.  She  had  symptoms  of  respiratory 
infection  as  was  being  treated.  On  the  way  to  the  hospital,  she  experienced  a  respiratory  arrest  and 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44 
32 
 
 
 
subsequently went into cardiopulmonary arrest. Ultimately, she experienced multi-organ failure due to 
massive ischemic insult. The death was judged by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug. 
Laboratory findings 
Levetiracetam  causes  small,  but  statistically  significant  decreases  in  white  blood  cell  (WBC)  and 
neutrophil  counts  (relative  to  placebo  in  N159).  These  effects  have  also  been  reported  in  adults. 
During long-term exposure, the magnitude of decrease was similar, i.e., there was no trend towards a 
progressive  worsening  or  greater  risk  with  longer  treatment.  A  total  of  39  patients  who  received 
levetiracetam in any clinical trial (16.3%) had a WBC and/or neutrophil count that was significantly 
low and/or reported as an adverse event. The values generally normalized despite continued treatment 
and no clinical sequelae were reported. Low white counts were reported as adverse events in 9 patients 
(3.8%). None had concomitant clinical manifestations nor resulted in dose change or discontinuation. 
There  is  a  trend  for  lower  platelets  in  LEV  group  compared  to  placebo.  Two  patients  had 
thrombocytopenia reported as an adverse event, but neither had clinically significantly low platelets or 
clinical consequences.  
On  continued  open-label  treatment,  there  were  small  increases  in  transaminases,  but  clinical 
consequences  were  not  reported.  There  was  a  total  of  6  patients  with  possibly  clinically  significant 
elevations in liver function tests (other than GGT), reported as adverse events in 3. AST and/or ALT 
were elevated to between one and three times the upper limit of normal in 4 patients: 2 continued on 
treatment and the values normalized, 1 value was observed at the final study visit in 1 patient with no 
further  follow-up,  and  one  occurred  2  weeks  after  the  last  dose  of  drug.  In  the  two  latter  patients, 
alkaline phosphatase was also increased. Two  additional patients had increased alkaline phosphatase 
as the only possibly clinically significant value, one of whom had substantial increases (worst value 
3439  U/L)  with  no  identifiable  cause  despite  extensive  work-up.  The  patients’  alkaline  phosphatase 
was  within  normal  limits  at  the  next  scheduled  visit,  approximately  3  months  later  with  continued 
treatment.  However,  it  is  frequent  to  observe  high  alkaline  phosphatase  in  children  and  teenagers, 
these being the reflection of growth. 
Eighteen  children  had  adverse  events  described  as  urinalysis  abnormalities.  Three  children,  all  of 
whom  were  receiving  topiramate,  had  kidney  stones.  The  remaining  15  had  mild  to  moderate 
urinalysis  abnormalities  (described  as  WBCs  in  the  urine,  ketones,  calcium,  leukocyte  esterase,  and 
nitrites, glucose, and bilirubin), judged not related to treatment in all but 3 cases. 
ECGs were obtained at the local site and results entered into the CRF. A centralised ECG reading was 
not  performed  and  measurements  were  relatively  infrequent  (end  of  the  placebo  controlled  trial  and 
after 1 year in the open-label extension study). These were not timed to peak plasma concentrations. 
The analysis of ECGs did not show evidence that levetiracetam has an effect on the ECG in children. 
However,  one  case  of  prolonged  QT  was  described  when  receiving  high  levetiracetam  doses 
(>99mg/kg/day) (ISS Nos. 5202). 
Paediatric post-marketing experience 
The  post-marketing  experience  of  levetiracetam  in  children  and  adolescents  aged  between  1  month 
and  less  than  16  years  was  reviewed  by  the  MAH.  A  total  of  236  cases  were  identified.  These  236 
cases involve 459 adverse events. Upon review of the post-marketing safety information, no specific 
safety signal was identified.  There were nine fatalities. One child died due to status epilepticus with 
acute circulatory failure, one child with a congenital dilated cardiomyopathy died due to heart failure 
during  a  seizure,  and  four  cases  were  suggestive  for  sudden  unexplained  death  in  epilepsy.  Of  the 
other three fatalities, one completed suicide, one died due to pneumonia and one died due to sudden 
hepatic  insufficiency  subsequently  to  a  blood  pressure  drop  due  to  hypoxia  in  relation  with  an 
inhalation pneumopathy. 
The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  were  related  to  psychiatric  disorders  (29%),  including, 
aggression,  abnormal  behaviour,  hallucination,  crying,  anger,  psychotic  disorder  and  anxiety.  There 
were  four  cases  of  suicidal  behaviour.  All  4  patients  were  concomitantly  treated  with  other  AEDs.  
In one case of completed suicide the patient had a history of difficult social situation, psychosis years 
ago  and  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder.  In  one  case  of  suicide  attempt,  the  patient  became 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
depressed  and  attempted  suicide  by  stepping  into  the  street.  There  was  no  previous  history  of 
depression or suicidal ideation. In one case of suicidal ideation, the patient had a history of learning 
disability.  After  starting  levetiracetam  he  was  seizure  free  and  presented  with  behaviour  disorder.  
In another case of suicidal ideation, the patient presented with aggression after starting levetiracetam. 
There was no data on psychiatric history and seizure control. In the latter two cases the events resolved 
while levetiracetam was continued at a reduced dosage. 
The  second  most frequently reported adverse events were related to nervous system disorder (17%), 
including  convulsions,  somnolence  and  psychomotor  hyperactivity.  The  reported  events  in  the 
paediatric population are comparable to these reported in the adult population, with the exception of 
psychomotor hyperactivity, which is more frequently reported in the paediatric population. 
In  summary, adverse  events  linked  to  the  treatment  with  levetiracetam  in  children  were  frequent,  as 
expected for this type of medication. Safety results in paediatric patients are largely consistent with the 
safety profile in  adults. However, the  occurrence  of neuropsychiatric  adverse  events in children was 
identified  by  CHMP  as  a  matter  of  concern  after  their  first  assessment  of  the  data  submitted  by  the 
MAH. The MAH was requested to clarify if the side effects were dose-related, and if risk factors for 
the  development  of  levetiracetam-induced  psychiatric  side  effects  can  be  identified  in  the  paediatric 
population.    CHMP  suggested  that  ‘Suicide’  and  ‘suicidal  ideation’  should  be  added  to  the  SPC  as 
undesirable effects in post-marketing experience, and requested that the MAH looked into this issue. 
This and other safety-related concerns, and the MAH responses to them are listed (text in italics) and 
discussed individually below 
- 
The  most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  in  children  were  CNS-related  disorders,  and 
included  hostility,  aggression,  abnormal  behaviour,  anger,  psychotic  disorder  and  anxiety  on 
one  hand,  and  somnolence  and  dizziness  on  the  other  hand.  A  more  detailed  description  of 
patients  at  risk  for  psychiatric  AEs  would  be  useful.  The  MAH  should  clarify  whether  risk 
factors for the development of levetiracetam-induced psychiatric side effects can be identified in 
the  paediatric  population  with  epilepsy.  For  instance:  mental  handicap,  pre-existing 
behavioural problems, hyperkinesia, etc. A warning should be added in Section 4.4 of the SPC.  
The MAH pointed out that a detailed description of the relative risk of different patients for psychiatric 
AEs  had  been  presented  in  their  submission,  in  the  Integrated  Safety  Summary  (Module  5,  Vol.27, 
Section 5.3.5.3 – ISS – p.1). Further to the CHMP request, however, these data have been extracted 
and presented below: 
Relative risks of CNS adverse events in adults and children 
The relative risk of psychiatric/behavioural events between levetiracetam and placebo was estimated 
based on study N159 and compared to adult data (from adequate and well controlled studies from the 
original adult partial onset seizure submission of levetiracetam). As shown in Table 19 and Table 20 
below,  although  the  incidence  of  psychiatric/behavioural  AEs  in  children  with  refractory  partial 
seizure who are treated with levetiracetam is 38.6% versus 18.6% in adults, the relative risk (RR) is 
similar in adults and children, as there is also a higher incidence of such AEs in children treated with 
for 
placebo  as  compared 
psychiatric/behavioural AEs in children is 1.39 (95% CI: 0.93-2.08); while that in adults is 1.77 (95% 
CI:  1.30-2.42).  The  majority  of  these  AEs  in  children  are  in  the  category  of  non-psychotic 
mood/anxiety/behavioural  symptoms,  RR  of  2.03  [95%  CI:  1.25  -  3.30].  Those  individual  terms  for 
which there was a two-fold or greater RR in levetiracetam treated paediatric patients as compared to 
placebo  were  agitation  (5.76;  95%  CI:  0.71-46.99),  nervousness  (4.32;  95%  CI:  0.96-19.50),  and 
depression (2.88;  95% CI:  0.30-27.23). Hostility also tended to  occur with a greater  RR (1.92; 95% 
CI: 0.75-4.91) in paediatric patients randomized to levetiracetam. 
(27.8%  vs.  10.5%).  The  modestly  elevated  RR

Risk factors for CNS adverse events 
To assess whether or not certain pre-existing medical conditions and seizure responses are risk factors 
of developing psychiatric/behaviour AEs, explorative analyses were conducted. 
The  neuropsychiatric  history  of  each  of  the  239  patients  in  the  pooled  database  was  reviewed.  
The review focused on the investigator verbatim for each medical history term as it provided a more 
reliable  and  accurate  description  than  the  ICD  coding.  The  neuropsychiatric  history  verbatim  terms 
were  therefore  re-classified  according  to  the  Diagnostic  Criteria  from  the  DSM-IV-TR  published  by 
the American Psychiatric Association, 2000.  
The RR (levetiracetam/placebo) of psychiatric events for patients with or without psychiatric histories 
was calculated. There is no greater risk of psychiatric behavioural events in patients with psychiatric 
histories  (RR  =  1.05,  95%  CI  =  0.63,  1.72).  The  incidence  of  these  events  in  levetiracetam-treated 
patients  is  similar  whether  or  not  they have  a  prior  history  (39.2%  vs.  38.0%,  for  with  and  without, 
respectively) and the RRs of emotional lability (RR = 2.94 vs 0.94), hostility (RR = 3.43 vs 1.18), and 
personality disorder (RR = 3.92 vs. 0.63) are higher in patients without a history (probably attributable 
to a lower incidence amongst placebo patients).   
The cognitive status of each N159 patient in the pooled database was also reviewed, again using the 
investigator  verbatim  for  each  medical  history  term  rather  than  the  ICD  coding.  Eighty-two  of  the 
patients (41.4%) had a significant history of cognitive impairment in the medical history, i.e., mental 
retardation, cognitive delay or impairment, encephalopathy, and/or global developmental delay. More 
events were reported in patients without known cognitive impairment history and the expected pattern 
of events with increased risk was seen in that group. This could, in part, be attributed to the difficulty 
in  rating  severely  impaired  children.  A  history  of  cognitive  impairment  does  not  seem  to  be  a  risk 
factor for the appearance of these behavioural adverse events. 
Adverse events reported in patients in N159 or receiving levetiracetam in the pooled database with and 
without  a  given  medical  history  were  compared  for  six  ICD-Level  2  categories  that  pertain  to  the 
nervous  system:  mental  and  behavioral  disorders,  behavioral/emotional  disorders  with  childhood 
onset,  disorders  of  psychological  development,  congenital  malformations  of  the  nervous  system, 
mental retardation, and organic mental disorders. There are no predominant trends in adverse events 
occurring in combination with any medical condition. The only observation is that cognitive adverse 
events tended not to be reported in patients with mental retardation and organic mental disorders. The 
latter group had relatively few nervous system adverse events reported. 
A  past  neuropsychiatric  history,  obtained  in  41.4%  patients  receiving  levetiracetam,  was  not  a 
predictive factor for CNS adverse events.  
Psychiatric  adverse  events  have  been  reported  to  occur  following  improvement  of  seizure  control,  a 
phenomena  known  as  “alternative  psychosis”  or  “forced  normalization”.  Therefore,  the  patients  in 
N159  were  also  categorized  into  those  who  responded  (defined  as  at  least  a  50%  reduction  from 
baseline in  weekly seizure frequency) and those who did not meet the criterion. There are relatively 
few patients randomized to placebo in N159 who met responder criteria; nonetheless, there does not 
appear to be a preponderance of events in either response category. 
Summary 
• 
These  additional  analyses  confirm  a  modestly  elevated  risk  for  psychiatric  and  behavioural 
events, in the category of non-psychotic mood/anxiety/behavioural symptoms, in children with 
refractory partial onset seizure disorder who are treated with levetiracetam.

• 
Even  though  the  overall  incidence  of  psychiatric  and  behavioural  events  appears  higher  in 
children as compared to adults, the relative risks are comparable. 
There is no greater risk of psychiatric behavioural events in patients with psychiatric histories. 
The  incidence  of  these  events  in  levetiracetam-treated  patients  is  similar  whether  or  not  they 
have  a  prior  history  and  the  relative  risks  of  emotional  lability,  hostility,  and  personality 
disorder are paradoxically higher in patients without a history (attributable to a lower incidence 
amongst placebo patients).   
A  history  of  cognitive  impairment  or  organic  mental  disorders  does  not  seem  therefore  to  be  a  risk 
factor for the appearance of these behavioural adverse events. 
SPC changes 
In accordance with this reply, since there is no real warning sign, the MAH proposed to include the 
information in section 4.8 (“Undesirable effects”) instead of section 4.4:  
“Safety results in paediatric patients were consistent with the safety profile of levetiracetam in adults 
except for behavioural psychiatric adverse events which were more common in children than in adults 
(38.6% versus 18.6%). However, the relative risk is similar in children as compared to adults as there 
was  also  a  higher  incidence  of  behavioural  psychiatric  adverse  events  in  the  placebo  group  in 
children as compared to adults (27.8% versus 10.5%).” 
The MAH’s assessment of the relative risk of CNS adverse events in children receiving levetiracetam 
is  acceptable  to  the  CHMP.  The  RR  is  similar  in  adults  and  children.  No  risk  factor  has  been 
identified. Therefore, the CHMP agreed to the MAH’s proposal to include this information in section 
4.8 of the SPC.  
The wording, however, needs to be simplified, as follows: 
“Safety results in paediatric patients were consistent with the safety profile of levetiracetam in adults 
except for behavioural psychiatric adverse events which were more common in children than in adults 
(38.6% versus 18.6%). However, the relative risk is similar in children as compared to adults”. 
The MAH agreed with the CHMP and provided amended Product Information, as requested. 
- 
The incidence of  somnolence and loss of appetite, if persisting,  may interfere with the normal 
development. The MAH should assess this risk.  
The MAH explained that body weight was one of the indicators for development and was measured 
multiple times during levetiracetam  treatment. To address the  concern  of CHMP regarding  potential 
risk of somnolence and loss of appetite that may interfere with normal development, patients with PCS 
“abnormal weight change” and with reported adverse events related to weight, somnolence and loss of 
appetite are reviewed below: 
In  the  double-blind  study  N159,  somnolence  was  more  commonly  reported  among  patients 
randomised  to  levetiracetam  than  to  placebo  (22.8%  vs  11.3%).  In  the  ISS  pooled  safety  database, 
29.7%  patients  treated  with  levetiracetam  reported  somnolence.  These  findings  are  similar  to  those 
found in adults exposed to levetiracetam. The events were generally mild or moderate in intensity but 
were reported as severe in 5 patients. The onset ranged from within 1 day of starting treatment to more 
than 3 years after. The duration ranged from 1 day to 870 days, with a median duration of 30 days. 
In  the  double-blind  study  N159,  anorexia  (loss  of  appetite)  was  more  commonly  reported  among 
patients  randomised  to  levetiracetam  than  to  placebo  (12.9%  vs  8.2%).  In  the  ISS  pooled  safety 
database, 15.5% patients treated with levetiracetam reported anorexia. The events were generally mild 
or moderate in intensity but were reported as severe in 2 patients. The onset ranged from within 1 day 
of starting treatment to more than 5 years after. The duration ranged from 1 day to 578 days, with a 
median duration of 55 days. 
Body weight was measured several times throughout the studies N159 and N157. There was a small 
mean increase in body weight during the total 22-week period from baseline to the final on-treatment 
visit  in  N159  as  illustrated  in  table  21  The  change  was  similar  in  the  placebo-  and  levetiracetam-
treated group (p = 0.4909, Kruskal-Wallis test).

In analysing the body weights in the overall pooled safety database, the 50th percentile of the normal 
growth curve was used as the marker for change, since increase in body weight is expected in children. 
In children between 4 to < 8 years of age, there was a mean increase of 2.5 kg and in children 8 to < 12 
and 12 to < 18 years of age, there was a 4.3 to 5.7 kg mean increase, respectively. Therefore, it appears 
that levetiracetam treatment would not affect the normal weight gain or growth curve in children. 
Further analysis performed by the MAH did not reveal any clear relationship between weight change 
and somnolence and thus did not suggest that somnolence will interfere with normal development in 
children. However, if anorexia is induced and persists, this may alter normal weight gain in children. 
Overall, since the mean body weight change in levetiracetam treated patients was similar to placebo 
treated patients, there is no clear relationship between levetiracetam treatment and weight loss. 
CHMP  considered  that  body  weight  is  a  rather  crude  method  to  assess  growth  BMI  and  head 
circumference in younger children would have been valuable additional parameters. However, CHMP 
agreed that there is no apparent relationship between somnolence and weight or growth changes. The 
issue is therefore considered resolved. 
However, according to the ‘Note for Guidance on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the 
treatment of epileptic disorders’ (16 November 2000, CPMP/EWP/566/98/rev), development of AED 
in children should include short and long term studies designed to detect possible impact on growths 
(amongst  others).  Thus,  CHMP  requested  that  the  MAH  would  amend  the  protocol  of  the  ongoing 
long-term follow up study NO1148 so that body height be not only measured at visit 1, but also at the 
final study visit.  
It should be clarified if the side effects of levetiracetam in children are dose-related and if they 
- 
persist over time as suggested by the present data.  
In  addition  to  the  data  presented  with  their  submission  dossier  for  this  variation,  to  further  explore 
whether  AE  persisted  over  time,  the  MAH  derived  the  AE  duration.  When  a  subject  reported  more 
than  one  episode  of  the  same  event,  the  maximum  duration  would  be  used.  After  the  merging,  AEs 
reported  by  ≥  20  subjects  and  the  following  events:  agitation,  hyperkinesia  and  weight  loss,  were 
evaluated (31 events in total). Results are presented in the form of histograms and scatter plots in the 
MAH’s response. No trend is apparent. In addition, the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients 
between AE duration and daily dose at onset have been calculated. Most of the correlations were low 
in  magnitude.  Only  the  following  events  showed  moderate  correlations:  agitation  (Pearson  =  0.545, 
Spearman  =  0.629  and  both  were  significant  at  5%  level);  emotional  lability  (Pearson  =  0.396, 
Spearman  =  0.427  and  the  latter  was  significant  at  5%  level);  and  flu  syndrome,  with  a  negative 
correlation  (Pearson  =  -  0.395,  Spearman  =  -  0.604  and  the  latter  was  significant  at  1%  level).  The 
significance test here was merely used to highlight some “interesting” results out of many evaluations. 
In fact the numbers of subjects for these 3 events were all pretty small: 15, 24, and 20, respectively. 
The CHMP considered that there was no clear trend with respect to time of onset or dose for any of the 
AEs,  except  for  agitation  and  emotional  lability  in  relation  to  dose  (relatively  low  coefficient  of 
correlation). When AEs are categorised by the dose at onset, the incidence of  nervousness tended to 
increase with increased dose and there was a weak trend for hostility and personality disorder to occur 
at higher doses. There was one case of QT prolongation in a child treated with a very high dose. No 
other case of QT prolongation has been described so far, even in overdoses; the preclinical data did not 
raise  concern  in  that  respect;  and  levetiracetam  does  not  inhibit,  nor  is  it  metabolised  by,  CYP450 
enzymes. 
When it comes to prolonged adverse events, it is difficult to determine from study N159 which effects 
would  persist  longer  since  this  was  a  relatively  short-term,  dose-escalating  study.  According  to  the 
new  analyses  provided  by  the  MAH,  agitation,  hostility,  hyperkinesia,  nervousness,  and  personality 
Keppra-H-C-277-II-44 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disorder  could  be  present  for  prolonged  periods,  while  somnolence  is  especially  mentioned  at  the 
beginning of the treatment. 
In  summary,  CHMP  considered  that  the  safety  data  are  reassuring  in  terms  of  duration  of  AEs, 
reversibility,  and  a  lack  of  clear  dose-relationship  for  any  effect  (with  a  possible  exception  for 
nervousness, agitation and emotional lability). The SPC correctly describes these aspects. 
- 
According to the CHMP  guideline for clinical  investigation  of  medicinal products in epileptic 
disorders, the development of AEDs in children should include short-term and long-term studies 
to  detect  possible  impact  on  learning,  intelligence,  growth,  endocrine  functions,  puberty,  and 
childbearing  potential.  Have  such  studies  been  included  in  the  paediatric  developmental  plan 
for  Keppra?  Before  getting  these  results,  a  warning  should  be  added  to  the  SPC  to  clearly 
specify that long-term effects remain unknown.  
The  MAH  explained  that  in  the  current  paediatric  development  program,  growth,  puberty,  and 
childbearing  potential  were  assessed  and  the  results  are  briefly  summarized.  A  study  specifically 
assessing any possible impact on learning and intelligence, cognitive and behaviour of levetiracetam is 
ongoing (N01103, long term follow-up N01148; both protocols had been included by the MAH). The 
results should be available in 2008. Endocrine function was not specifically assessed although blood 
glucose  was  measured  several  times  during  the  study  and  no  clinically  significant  findings  were 
identified.  
Growth 
Body weight was measured several times throughout the study N159 and its long-term extension study 
N157. There was a small mean increase in body weight during the total 22-week period from baseline 
to  the  final  on-treatment  visit  in  N159.  Based  on  the  data  of  body  weight,  it  did  not  suggest  that 
levetiracetam treatment would impact the growth of children. 
Puberty and childbearing potential 
The Tanner Staging Scale was to be used in N157 in patients for whom it was applicable. There was 
variable  compliance  with  completing  this  assessment.  Some  sites  completed  it  for  all  patients 
regardless of whether it was applicable, e.g., site 380 completed it for virtually all patients, even those 
less than  4  years of age.  Some sites did not  complete the form  at  all (e.g., sites 368,  389, and 395). 
Finally,  for  some  patients,  the  staging  either  was  not  performed  despite  seemingly  being  applicable 
based on age (≥ 14 years of age) or was performed but not consistently at all visits. By reviewing the 
listing and adverse events, there is no clear signal that levetiracetam treatment will impact the puberty 
and childbearing potential of children. 
Learning and intelligence: ongoing study N01103-N01148 
The  potential  effects  of  levetiracetam  in  learning  and  intelligence  will  be  evaluated  in  the  currently 
ongoing  Study  N01103  and  its  long-term  follow-up  Study  N01148.  Study  N01103  is  a  19-week, 
randomized, double-blind, multi-centre, placebo-controlled safety study to evaluate the cognitive and 
neuropsychological  effects  of  levetiracetam  20-60  mg/kg/day,  divided  in  twice  daily  dosing,  as 
adjunctive treatment in children 4-16 years old with refractory partial onset seizures. The objectives of 
this study are also to generate additional double-blind, placebo-controlled safety and efficacy data for 
levetiracetam (20-60 mg/kg/day), as compared to placebo, in this population. Subjects will be titrated 
to  a  maximum  tolerated  and  effective  dose,  up  to  60  mg/kg/day,  during  the  Evaluation  Period. 
Neurocognitive and behavioral testing will be performed at Baseline and at the end of the Evaluation 
Period (Week 12). The primary cognitive and neuropsychological safety variable is the change from 
baseline to the end of the Evaluation Period (Week 12) in the Leiter-R AM Memory Screen Composite 
Score. The secondary cognitive and neuropsychological safety variables are the changes from baseline 
to  the  end  of  the  Evaluation  Period  (Week  12)  in  the  Wide  Range  Assessment  of  Memory  and 
Learning-2 (WRAML-2) General Memory Index, Visual Memory Index, Verbal Memory Index, and 
Learning Index (ages 5-16). The exploratory safety variables are change from baseline to the end of 
the  Evaluation  Period  (Week  12)  in  the  Leiter-R  Examiner’s  Rating,  Achenbach  Child  Behavior 
Checklist  (CBCL)  Activities,  Social,  School,  and  Total  Competence  (Activities  +  Social  +  School) 
raw  scores,  and  Child  Health  Questionnaire  (CHQ-PF50).  The  details  can  be  found  in  the  study

protocol of study N01103 and N01148. These two studies are currently ongoing. The MAH committed 
to submit the final reports upon completion. 
Endocrine Function 
No special endocrine function tests were included in the paediatric development  program. However, 
blood glucose was monitored during all studies. As shown in table 22, the mean and median changes 
from baseline to the last on-treatment visit for glucose were small and comparable for both treatment 
groups  in  N159.  Differences  between  treatments  were  neither  clinically  relevant  nor  statistically 
significant.

Similar  results  were  obtained  for  the  pooled  database.  There  were  8  unique  patients  with  possible 
clinically  significant  glucose  abnormalities,  all  but  one  being  single  transient  episodes  of 
hypoglycemia.  There  was  one  case  of  new  onset,  insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus,  which  was 
considered not to be related to study medication by the Investigator. 
Proposed changes to the SPC 
The MAH proposed that the following wordings are added in Section 4.4 Special Warning and special 
precautions: 
“Available data in children did not suggest impact on growth and puberty. However, long term effects 
on learning, intelligence, growth, endocrine function, puberty and childbearing potential in children 
remain unknown.” 
The  CHMP  considered  that  growth  did  not  seem  to  be  affected  based  on  changes  in  weight.  
The assessment of puberty and childbearing potential was not performed adequately, so no conclusion 
on this aspect can be reached. It was agreed, however, that until valid data are generated in ongoing 
studies  to  be  reported  in  2008,  a  warning  should  be  added  to  the  SPC  section  4.4.  It  is  strongly 
recommended that thyroid function be measured in study N01103-48; such tests could not be found in 
the study protocol as provided.  
In  summary,  the  CHMP  considered  acceptable  to  wait  for  the  results  of  the  ongoing  double-blind 
randomised  safety study  in order to  assess the risk  towards  growth, learning, intelligence,  endocrine 
function, puberty and childbearing potential in children. Until then, a warning is added to section 4.4 
of  the  SPC.  However,  the  MAH  is  requested  to  amend  the  protocol  of  the  ongoing  N01103  safety 
study to include thyroid tests in it.

Anorexia is often reported as an adverse event. Was topiramate a co-medication in these cases? 
The  MAH  responded  that,  in  pooled  database,  there  were  37  of  239  (15.5%)  patients  reporting 
anorexia.  To  evaluate  whether  or  not  there  is  a  relationship  between  anorexia  and  topiramate  co-
medication, an exploratory analysis was conducted. As shown in table 23, in pooled safety database, 
among patients not concomitantly treated with topiramate, the incidence of anorexia was 12.6% (21 of 
167  patients).  However,  for  patients  with  topiramate  as  a  concomitant  medication,  the  incidence  of 
anorexia was 22.2% (16 of 72 patients), higher than that in patients not receiving topiramate. The Chi-
Square test is approaching significant level (p = 0.0585). The odds ratio was 1.99 with 90% CI of 0.97 
- 4.08.

(a) Yes = Anorexia occurred when patients took Topiramate concomitantly at same time. Subjects 4894, 5228, and 5351 were 
excluded  from  “yes”  since  they  had  the  anorexia  and  took  Topiramate,  but  the  TEAE  did  not  occur  concomitantly  with 
Topiramate intake. 
If  one  does  not  consider  whether  or  not  anorexia  and  topiramate  administration  occurred 
concomitantly, then the incidences of anorexia for patients without or with topiramate as concomitant 
medication  were  10.8%  and  26.4%,  respectively.  This  difference  is  statistically  significant  (p  = 
0.0022).  The  odds  ratio  is  2.97  with  90%  CI  of  1.45  -  6.08.  For  37  patients  who  reported  anorexia,  
19 of them also received topiramate treatment. In the double blind, placebo controlled study N159, the 
incidence  of  anorexia  in  placebo  group  was  8.2%.  In  conclusion,  it  is  the  MAH  belief  that  co-
medication  of  topiramate  did  increase  the  risk  of  developing  anorexia  in  children  treated  with 
levetiracetam. 
CHMP considered that anorexia is a well-known AE of topiramate. The current data cannot determine 
whether  co-administration  of  levetiracetam  and  topiramate  increases  the  risk  of  anorexia  over  and 
above  that  of  topiramate  alone.  However,  it  should  be  mentioned  in  the  SPC  that  anorexia  is  more 
frequent when topiramate is coadministered with levetiracetam. 
Therefore,  the  issue  is  considered  resolved  by  CHMP,  provided  the  MAH  adds  the  following  text 
under the heading ‘Metabolism and nutrition disorders‘ in section 4.8 of the SPC: 
“The risk of anorexia is higher when topiramate is co-administered with levetiracetam”. 
The MAH agreed with the CHMP and provided amended Product Information, as requested.

In  paediatric  studies,  in  16.3%  of  patients  there  is  a  slight  but  significant  decrease  in  white 
blood cell and neutrophil counts. This is reported as an adverse event in 3.8% of patients. What 
is the co-medication? Carbamazepine? Is there a pharmacodynamic interaction? There is also 
a small decrease in platelet count: is it due to valproate as co-medication? The applicant should 
answer these questions.  
The MAH answer was divided in the following two points: 
Leukopenia and use of carbamazepine or other AEDs 
In  pooled  safety  database,  there  were  39  unique  patients  (16.9%)  with  either  possible  clinically 
significant  abnormality  of  one  or  more  WBC  indices  (WBC  counts  and  WBC  differential  counts) 
and/or those with adverse events suggestive of hematological disorders. These cases were reviewed. 
In  N159,  more  children  randomized  to  levetiracetam  (3  vs  0  in  the  placebo  group)  had  a  possible 
clinically significant decrease in total WBC value; however, there was no apparent difference between 
treatment groups with respect to neutrophil counts (decreased in 5.0% and 4.2% of levetiracetam and 
placebo  patients,  respectively).  Slightly  higher  values  were  found  in  the  pooled  safety  database  for 
levetiracetam  (n=237).  Most  of  these  possible  clinically  significant  abnormal  WBC  indices  were 
transient. 
For all patients with WBC changes, co-medications were reviewed. They were found to be similar, in 
type  and  frequency,  in  patients  with  possible  clinically  significant  abnormal  WBC  indices  and/or 
adverse  events  compared  to  those  in  the  population  of  pooled  safety  database.  There  is  no  clear 
relationship between certain AED use and decrease in white cell and neutrophil counts or leukopenia. 
There is no indication of pharmacodynamic interaction.

Decrease in platelet count and use of valproate 
- 
An explorative analysis was conducted. No clear relationship between valproate use and decrease of 
platelet counts could be established. 
In  summary,  after  reanalysing  the  pooled  safety  database  and  the  results  of  the  double-blind  N159 
study, the MAH concluded there is no sign of a pharmacodynamic interaction with any other AED that 
could  increase  the  risk  of  leukopenia  or  thrombocytopenia  in  children  treated  with  levetiracetam. 
CHMP considered the MAH arguments satisfactory. 
4.4  SPC changes 
A number of comments were raised on the SPC wording initially proposed by the MAH. Additionally, 
various adjustments became necessary after provision of additional data as part of the MAH’s answers 
to  the  RfSI.  These  SPC-related  issues  have  been  discussed  in  details  individually  as  part  of  the 
appropriate  sections  of  this  document.  For  clarity,  however,  the  full  SPC  and  PL  as  eventually 
approved by CHMP are provided in Attachment 1 to this assessment report. 
The agreed changes to the Therapeutic Indication (4.1) section of the SPC are presented below: 
Therapeutic indications 
Keppra  is  indicated  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  partial  onset  seizures  with  or  without 
secondary generalisation in patients adults and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. 
4.5  Discussion and risk/benefit assessment 
At the time of the application to support this extension of the indication to children aged 4 years and 
older,  Keppra  (levetiracetam)  was  approved  for  use  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  partial 
onset seizures in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age. 
Clinically,  the  application  was  primarily  based  on  one  placebo-controlled  study  (N159)  for 
demonstration  of  efficacy  in  the  proposed  indication/population.  The  efficacy  of  levetiracetam  in 
children  from  4  years  of  age  for  the  adjunctive  treatment  of  partial  seizures  has  been  globally 
demonstrated in this short-term study. 
Numerous concerns were identified by CHMP after the first assessment of the dossier. These led to the 
adoption of a Request for Supplementary Information (RfSI). (See Attachment 5 for complete list) In 
addition, a number of comments were raised on the initially proposed SPC wording.  
The MAH provided their answers to the RfSI on 10 June 2005. 
In  conclusion,  the  MAH  has  provided  satisfactory  answers  to  all  of  the  clinical  questions  posed  to 
them  as  requests  for  supplementary  information. The  MAH  acknowledged  limited  available  data  on 
dose-response relationship. A more cautious dose titration (for both up-titration and down-titration) is 
now  proposed in the SPC  and the use  of the lowest efficient  dose is  stressed.  The robustness  of the 
results of the primary endpoint of study N159 has been supported in a more convincing way and the 
responses to both levetiracetam and placebo have been reanalysed taking into account non-parametric 
distribution and differential drop-outs. The response to levetiracetam appears identical across all ages. 
No risk factors have been found for CNS adverse events, the relative risk of which appears similar in 
children and  adults. The coadministration  of topiramate increases the risk  of  anorexia and  maybe of 
other AEs. For an overview of the outcome of the discussions over the SPC. 
Therefore,  based  on  the  review  of  safety  and  efficacy,  and  following  the  MAH’s  responses,  the 
benefit-risk balance for levetiracetam as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in 
children from 4 to 16 years of age with epilepsy has been sufficiently demonstrated.

V.  Conclusion 
On  27  July  2005  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to submit the follow-up measures as listed below and to 
submit  any  variation  application  which  would  be  necessary  in  the  light  of  compliance  with  these

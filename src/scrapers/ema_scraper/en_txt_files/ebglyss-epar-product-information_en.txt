CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Ebglyss is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents 
12 years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis and treatment 
of atopic dermatitis. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of lebrikizumab is 500 mg (two 250 mg injections) at both week 0 and 
week 2, followed by 250 mg administered subcutaneously every other week up to week 16. 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no clinical 
response after 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with initial partial response may further improve 
with continued treatment every other week up to week 24. 
Once clinical response is achieved, the recommended maintenance dose of lebrikizumab is 250 mg 
every fourth week.

Lebrikizumab can be used with or without topical corticosteroids (TCS). Topical calcineurin inhibitors 
(TCI) may be used, but should be reserved for problem areas only, such as the face, neck, 
intertriginous and genital areas. 
Missed dose 
If a dose is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, dosing should be 
resumed at the regular scheduled time. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Body weight 
No dose adjustment for body weight is recommended (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in children aged 6 months to <12 years or adolescents 12 to 
17 years of age and weighing less than 40 kg have not yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous use. 
Lebrikizumab is administered by subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, except for 5 cm 
around the navel. If somebody else administers the injection, the upper arm can also be used. 
For the initial 500 mg dose, two 250 mg injections should be administered consecutively in different 
injection sites. 
It is recommended to rotate the injection site with each injection. Lebrikizumab should not be injected 
into skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars. 
A patient may self-inject lebrikizumab or the patient’s caregiver may administer lebrikizumab if their 
healthcare professional determines that this is appropriate. Proper training should be provided to 
patients and/or caregivers on the administration of lebrikizumab prior to use. Detailed instructions for 
use are included at the end of the package leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.

Hypersensitivity 
If a systemic hypersensitivity reaction (immediate or delayed) occurs, administration of lebrikizumab 
should be discontinued and appropriate therapy initiated. 
Conjunctivitis 
Patients treated with lebrikizumab who develop conjunctivitis that does not resolve following standard 
treatment should undergo ophthalmological examination (see section 4.8). 
Helminth infection 
Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies. It is 
unknown if lebrikizumab will influence the immune response against helminth infections by inhibiting 
IL-13 signalling. 
Patients with pre-existing helminth infections should be treated before initiating treatment with 
lebrikizumab. If patients become infected while receiving lebrikizumab and do not respond to 
antihelminth treatment, treatment with lebrikizumab should be discontinued until infection resolves. 
Vaccinations 
Prior to initiating therapy with lebrikizumab, it is recommended that patients are brought up to date 
with all age-appropriate immunisations according to current immunisation guidelines. Live and live 
attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with lebrikizumab as clinical safety and efficacy 
has not been established. Immune responses to non-live vaccines were assessed in a combined tetanus, 
diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (TdaP) and a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (see 
section 4.5). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed.  
Live vaccines 
The safety and efficacy of concurrent use of lebrikizumab with live and live attenuated vaccines has 
not been studied. Live and live attenuated vaccines should not be given concurrently with 
lebrikizumab. 
Non-live vaccines 
Immune responses to non-live vaccines were assessed in a study in which adult patients with atopic 
dermatitis were treated with lebrikizumab 500 mg at weeks 0 and 2 followed by lebrikizumab 250 mg 
every other week. After 12 weeks of lebrikizumab administration, patients were vaccinated with a 
combined tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine TdaP vaccine (T cell-dependent) and a 
meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (T cell-independent) and immune responses were assessed 
4 weeks later. Antibody responses to both non-live vaccines were not negatively impacted by the 
concomitant lebrikizumab treatment. No adverse interactions between the non-live vaccines and 
lebrikizumab were noted in the study. Therefore, patients receiving lebrikizumab may receive 
concurrent inactivated or non-live vaccinations. For information on live vaccines see section 4.4. 
Concomitant therapies 
Given that lebrikizumab is a monoclonal antibody, no pharmacokinetic interactions are expected.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are limited amount of data from the use of lebrikizumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do 
not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As 
a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of lebrikizumab during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether lebrikizumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after 
ingestion. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot 
be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue from 
lebrikizumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
Animal studies showed no impairment of fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lebrikizumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The  most  common  adverse  reactions  are  conjunctivitis  (6.9%),  injection  site  reactions  (2.6%), 
conjunctivitis allergic (1.8%) and dry eye (1.4%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Across all clinical studies in atopic dermatitis, a total of 1720 patients were administered lebrikizumab, 
of which, 891 patients were exposed to lebrikizumab for at least one year. Unless otherwise stated, the 
frequencies are based on a pool of 4 randomised, double-blind studies in patients with moderate-to-
severe atopic  dermatitis  where  783  patients  were  treated  with subcutaneous lebrikizumab  during the 
placebo-controlled period (first 16 weeks of treatment). 
Listed in Table 1 are adverse reactions observed from clinical trials presented by system organ class and 
frequency,  using  the  following  categories:  very  common  (≥  1/10);  common  (≥  1/100  to  <  1/10); 
uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Conjunctivitis and related events 
During the first 16 weeks of treatment conjunctivitis, conjunctivitis allergic, blepharitis and keratitis 
were reported more frequently in patients treated with lebrikizumab (6.9%, 1.8%, 0.8% and 0.6% 
respectively) compared to placebo (1.8%, 0.7%, 0.2% and 0.3%). 
During maintenance treatment period (16-52 weeks) the incidence of conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis 
allergic with lebrikizumab was 5.0% and 5.9% respectively. 
Across all clinical studies, among lebrikizumab-treated patients treatment discontinuation due to 
conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis allergic occurred in 0.7% and 0.3% of cases, respectively. Severe 
cases of conjunctivitis and conjunctivitis allergic occurred in 0.1% and 0.2% of cases, respectively. 
72% of patients recovered, of those 57% recovered within 90 days. 
Eosinophilia 
Lebrikizumab-treated patients had a greater mean increase from baseline in eosinophil count compared 
to patients treated with placebo. In lebrikizumab treated patients 20.3% had any increase in eosinophil 
count compared to 11.7% with placebo. In general, the increase in the lebrikizumab-treated patients 
was mild or moderate and transient. Eosinophilia >5000 cells/mcL was observed in 0.4% 
lebrikizumab-treated patients and none of the placebo-treated patients. Adverse reactions of 
eosinophilia were reported in 0.6% of patients treated with lebrikizumab and with a similar rate in 
patients treated with placebo during the initial treatment period. Eosinophilia did not result in 
treatment discontinuation and no eosinophil-related disorders were reported. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions (including pain and erythema) were reported more frequently in patients who 
received lebrikizumab (2.6%) compared to placebo (1.5%). The majority (95 %) of injection site 
reactions were mild or moderate in severity, and few patients (< 0.5%) discontinued lebrikizumab 
treatment. 
Herpes zoster 
Herpes zoster was reported in 0.6% of the patients treated with lebrikizumab and none of the patients 
in the placebo group. All herpes zoster events reported were mild or moderate in severity and none led 
to permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
Long term safety 
The long-term safety of lebrikizumab was assessed in 5 clinical studies. In the two monotherapy 
studies (ADvocate- 1, ADvocate-2) up to 52 weeks and in patients enrolled in the TCS combination 
therapy study (ADhere) and followed in a long-term extension study (ADjoin) for a total of 56 weeks 
and the monotherapy ADore study in adolescents for also up to 52 weeks. The safety profile of 
lebrikizumab as monotherapy through week 52 or in combination with TCS through week 56 is 
consistent with the safety profile observed up to week 16.

Paediatric population 
Adolescents 12 to 17 years of age 
The safety of lebrikizumab was assessed in 372 patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe 
atopic dermatitis, including 270 patients exposed for at least one year. The safety profile of 
lebrikizumab in these patients was similar to the safety profile in adults with atopic dermatitis. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Single intravenous doses up to 10 mg/kg and multiple subcutaneous doses up to 500 mg have been 
administered to humans in clinical trials without dose-limiting toxicity. There is no specific treatment 
for lebrikizumab overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be monitored for any signs or 
symptoms of adverse reactions and institute appropriate symptomatic treatment immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned , ATC code: not yet assigned 
Mechanism of action 
Lebrikizumab is an immunoglobulin (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to 
interleukin (IL)-13 and selectively inhibits IL-13 signalling through the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα)/ 
IL-13 receptor alpha 1 (IL-13Rα1) heterodimer, thereby inhibiting the downstream effects of IL-13. 
Inhibition of IL-13 signalling is expected to be of benefit in diseases in which IL-13 is a key 
contributor to the disease pathogenesis. Lebrikizumab does not prevent the binding of IL-13 to the 
IL-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL-13Rα2 or decoy receptor), which allows the internalisation of IL-13 into 
the cell. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In lebrikizumab clinical studies, lebrikizumab reduced the levels of serum periostin, total 
immunoglobulin E (IgE), CC chemokine ligand (CCL)17 [thymus and activation-regulated chemokine 
(TARC)], CCL18 [pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC)], and CCL13 [monocyte 
chemotactic protein-4 (MCP-4)]. The decreases in the type 2 inflammation mediators provide indirect 
evidence of inhibition of the IL-13 pathway by lebrikizumab. 
Immunogenicity 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were commonly detected. No evidence of ADA impact on 
pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Adults and adolescents with atopic dermatitis 
The efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab as monotherapy (ADvocate-1, ADvocate-2) and with 
concomitant TCS (ADhere) were evaluated in three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
pivotal studies in 1062 adults and adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years and weighing ≥40 kg) with 
moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, defined by an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) ≥ 16, 
Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) ≥ 3, and a body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥ 10%. 
Patients enrolled into the three studies previously had an inadequate response to topical medication or 
determination that topical treatments are otherwise medically inadvisable. 
In all three studies, patients received an initial dose of 500 mg of lebrikizumab (two 250 mg 
injections) at weeks 0 and 2, followed by 250 mg every other week (Q2W) until week 16, or matching 
placebo in a 2:1 ratio. In ADhere, study patients also received concomitant low-to-mid potency TCS 
or TCI on active lesions. Patients were permitted to receive rescue treatment at the discretion of the 
investigator to control intolerable symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Patients requiring systemic rescue 
treatment were discontinued from study treatment. 
Patients achieving IGA 0 or 1 or at least a 75% reduction in EASI (EASI 75) without having received 
any rescue therapy were re-randomised in a blinded manner to (i) lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W; (ii) 
lebrikizumab 250 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W); or (iii) matching placebo up to 52 weeks. 
In ADvocate-1 and 2, patients not achieving IGA 0 or 1 or EASI 75 at week 16, or who received 
rescue medication prior to week 16, were entered into an Escape Arm and treated with open-label 
lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W through Week 52. 
In ADvocate-1 and ADvocate-2, after completing the 52-week study, and in ADhere, after completing 
the 16-week study, patients were offered the option to continue treatment in a separate long-term 
extension study (ADjoin). 
Endpoints 
In all three studies, the co-primary endpoints were the percentage of patients with IGA 0 or 1 (“clear” 
or “almost clear”), with a ≥2-point reduction from baseline, and the percentage of patients achieving 
EASI 75 from baseline to week 16. Key secondary endpoints (adjusted for multiplicity) included the 
percentage of patients who achieved at least a 90% reduction in EASI (EASI 90), percentage of 
patients with at least 4-point improvement from baseline in Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (Pruritus 
NRS), percentage of patients with at least 4-point improvement from baseline in Dermatology Life 
Quality Index (DLQI)  and interference of itch on sleep (Sleep-Loss Scale), which is a patient-
reported, single-item, daily scale measuring the extent of interference of itch on sleep over the last 
night on a 5-point Likert scale. An additional secondary endpoint (not adjusted for multiplicity) 
included the change from baseline in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM). 
Subjects 
Baseline characteristics 
The monotherapy studies ADvocate-1 and ADvocate-2 enrolled 424 and 427 patients, respectively, 
and across studies the mean age was 35.8, the mean weight was 77.1 kg, 49.9% were female, 63.7% 
were white, 22.6% were Asian, and 9.9% were black, 12.0% were adolescents (12 to 17 years). 
Overall, 61.5% of patients had a baseline IGA of 3 (moderate atopic dermatitis), 38.5% of patients had 
a baseline IGA of 4 (severe atopic dermatitis), and 54.8% of patients had received prior systemic 
treatment. The mean baseline EASI was 29.6, the mean baseline Pruritus NRS was 7.2 and the mean 
baseline DLQI was 15.5. 
The concomitant TCS study ADhere enrolled 211 patients and the mean age was 37.2, the mean 
weight was 76.2 kg, 48.8% were female, 61.6% were white, 14.7% were Asian, and 13.3% were 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
black, 21.8% were adolescents. In this study, 69.2% of patients had a baseline IGA of 3 (moderate 
atopic dermatitis), 30.8% of patients had a baseline IGA of 4 (severe atopic dermatitis), and 47.4% of 
patients had received prior systemic treatment. The mean baseline EASI was 27.3, the mean baseline 
Pruritus NRS was 7.1 and the mean baseline DLQI was 14.4. 
Clinical response 
Monotherapy studies (ADvocate-1 and ADvocate-2) – induction period, weeks 0-16 
In ADvocate-1 and ADvocate-2, a significantly greater proportion of patients randomised to 
lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W achieved IGA 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement from baseline, EASI 
75, EASI 90, and an improvement of ≥4 points in Pruritus NRS and DLQI compared to placebo at 
week 16 (see Table 2). 
In both monotherapy studies, lebrikizumab reduced daily worst itch severity compared to placebo, as 
measured by the percent change from baseline in Pruritus NRS, already at week 1 of treatment. The 
improvement in Pruritus NRS occurred in conjunction with improvements in skin inflammation 
related to atopic dermatitis and quality of life.

Monotherapy Studies (ADvocate-1 and ADvocate-2) – maintenance period, weeks 16-52 
To evaluate maintenance of response, 157 subjects from ADvocate-1 and 134 subjects from 
ADvocate-2 treated with lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W, who achieved IGA 0 or 1 or EASI 75 at week 16 
without topical or systemic rescue treatment, were re-randomised in a blinded manner 2:2:1 to an

Other patient-reported outcomes 
In both monotherapy studies (ADvocate-1 and ADvocate-2) and in the concomitant TCS study 
(ADhere) lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W significantly improved POEM and interference of itch on sleep 
(Sleep-Loss Scale) at week 16 compared to placebo. 
Adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) 
In the monotherapy studies ADvocate 1 and ADvocate 2, the mean age of adolescent patients was 
14.6 years, the mean weight was 68.2 kg, and 56.9% were female. In these studies, 63.7% had a

Adolescent patients treated with lebrikizumab and lebrikizumab + TCS achieved clinically meaningful 
improvements in disease severity and maintained response up to week 52. Additional data from the 
single-arm ADore study with lebrikizumab in 206 adolescents support the efficacy of lebrikizumab in 
adolescent patients up to 52 weeks of treatment. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
lebrikizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in atopic dermatitis (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After a subcutaneous dose of 250 mg lebrikizumab, peak serum concentrations were achieved 
approximately 7 to 8 days post dose.  
Following the 500 mg loading doses at week 0 and week 2, steady-state serum concentrations were 
achieved with the first 250 mg Q2W dose at week 4. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, the predicted steady-state trough concentrations 
(Ctrough,ss) following lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W and Q4W subcutaneous dosing in patients with atopic 
dermatitis (median and 5th - 95th percentile) were 87 (46-159) µg/mL and 36 (18-68) µg/mL, 
respectively. 
The absolute bioavailability was estimated at 86% based on a population PK analysis. Injection site 
location did not significantly influence the absorption of lebrikizumab. 
Distribution 
Based on a population PK analysis, the total volume of distribution at steady-state was 5.14 L. 
Biotransformation 
Specific metabolism studies were not conducted because lebrikizumab is a protein. Lebrikizumab is 
expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same 
manner as endogenous IgG. 
Elimination 
In the population PK analysis, clearance was 0.154 L/day and was independent of dose. The mean 
elimination half-life was approximately 24.5 days. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Lebrikizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increase in exposure over a 
dose range of 37.5 to 500 mg given as a subcutaneous injection in patients with AD or in healthy 
volunteers. 
Special populations 
Gender, age, and race 
Gender, age (range 12 to 93 years), and race did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics 
of lebrikizumab. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of lebrikizumab have not been conducted. Lebrikizumab, as a monoclonal antibody, 
is not expected to undergo significant renal or hepatic elimination. Population PK analyses show that 
markers of renal or hepatic function did not affect the pharmacokinetics of lebrikizumab. 
Body weight 
Exposure to lebrikizumab was lower in subjects with higher body weight but this had no meaningful 
impact on clinical efficacy. 
Paediatric population 
Based on population PK analysis adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with atopic dermatitis had slightly 
higher lebrikizumab serum trough concentrations compared to adults, which was related to their lower 
body weight distribution. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity (including safety pharmacology endpoints) and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
The mutagenic potential of lebrikizumab has not been evaluated; however monoclonal antibodies are 
not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with lebrikizumab. Evaluation of the available 
evidence related to IL-13 inhibition and animal toxicology data with lebrikizumab does not suggest 
carcinogenic potential for lebrikizumab. 
No effects on fertility parameters were observed in sexually mature monkeys after a long-term 
intravenous (females) or subcutaneous (males) treatment with lebrikizumab. Lebrikizumab had no 
effects on embryo-fetal or postnatal development.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Ebglyss is and what it is used for 
Ebglyss contains the active substance lebrikizumab. 
Ebglyss is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg 
with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, who can be treated with 
systemic treatments (a medicine given by mouth or injection).  
Ebglyss may be used with eczema medicines that you apply to the skin or it may be used on its own. 
Lebrikizumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that blocks the action of another protein 
called interleukin-13. Interleukin-13 plays a major role in causing the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. 
By blocking interleukin-13, Ebglyss can improve your atopic dermatitis and reduce the related itching 
and skin pain. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Ebglyss 
Do not use Ebglyss 
- 
if you are allergic to lebrikizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Ebglyss. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Ebglyss. 
Every time you get a new pack of Ebglyss, it is important that you note down the date and the batch 
number (which is on the packaging after “Lot”) and keep this information in a safe place. 
Allergic reactions 
Very rarely, this medicine can cause allergic (hypersensitivity) reactions. These reactions can occur 
shortly after you take Ebglyss, but also may happen later. If you notice symptoms of an allergic 
reaction, you should stop using this medicine and contact your doctor or get medical help 
immediately. Signs of an allergic reaction include: 
•  breathing problems 
• 
swelling of the face, mouth and tongue 
• 
fainting 
•  dizziness 
• 
•  hives, itching and skin rash 
feeling lightheaded (because of low blood pressure) 
Eye problems 
Talk to your doctor if you have any new or worsening eye problems, including redness and discomfort 
in the eye, eye pain or changes in vision. 
Vaccination 
Talk to your doctor regarding your current vaccinations plan. See section “Other medicines and 
Ebglyss”. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine should not be used in children with atopic dermatitis below the age of 12 or adolescents 
12 to 17 years of age and weighing less than 40 kg because it has not been tested in this age group. 
Other medicines and Ebglyss 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist: 
- 
- 
if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
if you have recently had a vaccination or plan to have one. You should not be given certain 
types of vaccines (live vaccines) while using Ebglyss. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
The effects of this medicine in pregnant women are not known. It is better to avoid the use of Ebglyss 
during pregnancy unless your doctor advises you to use it. 
It is not known whether lebrikizumab can pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or are 
planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. You and your doctor should 
decide if you will breast-feed or use Ebglyss. You should not do both. 
Driving and using machines 
Ebglyss is unlikely to influence your ability to drive and use machines. 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  How to use Ebglyss 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How much Ebglyss is given and for how long 
Your doctor will decide how much Ebglyss you need and how long you will use it for. 
The recommended dose is: 
•  Two initial injections of 250 mg lebrikizumab each (500 mg in total) at week 0 and week 2. 
•  One injection with 250 mg once every two weeks from week 4 up to week 16.  
Based on how you respond to the medicine, your doctor may decide to stop giving the medicine or 
to keep giving you one 250 mg injection every other week up to week 24. 
•  One injection with 250 mg every four weeks from week 16 onwards (maintenance dosing). 
Ebglyss is given as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection) into the thigh or abdomen, 
except for 5 cm around the navel. If somebody else gives the injection, it can also be given into the 
upper arm. You and your doctor or nurse will decide if you can inject Ebglyss yourself. 
It is recommended that you change the injection site with each injection. Ebglyss should not be 
injected into skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars, or in an area of skin that is affected 
by atopic dermatitis or other skin lesions. For the initial 500 mg dose, administer two 250 mg 
injections consecutively in different injection sites. 
It is important not to try to inject yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or nurse. A 
caregiver may also give you your Ebglyss injection after proper training. In adolescents 12 years of 
age and older, it is recommended that Ebglyss is administered by or under the supervision of an adult. 
The pre-filled syringe must not be shaken. 
Read the “Instructions for use” for the pre-filled syringe carefully before using Ebglyss. 
If you use more Ebglyss than you should 
If you took more Ebglyss than your doctor prescribed or you took the dose before it was scheduled, 
talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you forget to use Ebglyss 
If you have forgotten to inject a dose of Ebglyss, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you forgot to inject Ebglyss when you usually have planned to do it, take it as soon as you 
remember. The next dose should be injected on the regular scheduled day. 
If you stop using Ebglyss 
Do not stop using Ebglyss without speaking to your doctor first. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

Instructions for use 
1.  What Ebglyss is and what it is used for 
Ebglyss contains the active substance lebrikizumab. 
Ebglyss is used to treat adults and adolescents 12 years and older with a body weight of at least 40 kg 
with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, who can be treated with 
systemic treatments (a medicine given by mouth or injection). 
Ebglyss may be used with eczema medicines that you apply to the skin or it may be used on its own. 
Lebrikizumab is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that blocks the action of another protein 
called interleukin-13. Interleukin-13 plays a major role in causing the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. 
By blocking interleukin-13, Ebglyss can improve your atopic dermatitis and reduce the related itching 
and skin pain. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Ebglyss 
Do not use Ebglyss 
- 
if you are allergic to lebrikizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
If you think you may be allergic, or you are not sure, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice 
before using Ebglyss.

It is not known whether lebrikizumab can pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding or are 
planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this medicine. You and your doctor should

3.  How to use Ebglyss 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
How much Ebglyss is given and for how long 
Your doctor will decide how much Ebglyss you need and how long you will use it for. 
The recommended dose is: 
•  Two initial injections of 250 mg lebrikizumab each (500 mg in total) at week 0 and week 2. 
•  One injection with 250 mg once every two weeks from week 4 up to week 16. 
Based on how you respond to the medicine, your doctor may decide to stop giving the medicine or 
to keep giving you one 250 mg injection every other week up to week 24. 
•  One injection with 250 mg every four weeks from week 16 onwards (maintenance dosing). 
Ebglyss is given as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous injection) into the thigh or abdomen, 
except for 5 cm around the navel. If somebody else gives the injection, it can also be given into the 
upper arm. You and your doctor or nurse will decide if you can inject Ebglyss yourself. 
It is recommended that you change the injection site with each injection. Ebglyss should not be 
injected into skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars, or in an area of skin that is affected 
by atopic dermatitis or other skin lesions. For the initial 500 mg dose, administer two 250 mg 
injections consecutively in different injection sites. 
It is important not to try to inject yourself until you have been trained by your doctor or nurse. A 
caregiver may also give you your Ebglyss injection after proper training. In adolescents 12 years of 
age and older, it is recommended that Ebglyss is administered by or under the supervision of an adult. 
The pre-filled pen must not be shaken. 
Read the “Instructions for use” for the pre-filled pen carefully before using Ebglyss. 
If you use more Ebglyss than you should 
If you took more Ebglyss than your doctor prescribed or you took the dose before it was scheduled, 
talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you forget to use Ebglyss 
If you have forgotten to inject a dose of Ebglyss, talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
If you forgot to inject Ebglyss when you usually have planned to do it, take it as soon as you 
remember. The next dose should be injected on the regular scheduled day. 
If you stop using Ebglyss  
Do not stop using Ebglyss without speaking to your doctor first. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

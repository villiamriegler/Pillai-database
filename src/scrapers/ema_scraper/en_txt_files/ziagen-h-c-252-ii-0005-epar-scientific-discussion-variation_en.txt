II. 
Introduction 
With the original centralised application for Ziagen film-coated tablets and oral solution, submitted in 
June 1998, Glaxo Group applied for the treatment of HIV infection in adults and paediatric patients. 
Since abacavir in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine was shown to produce, in antiretroviral 
naive patients, a substantial viral suppression (similar to an HAART with indinavir) at 24 weeks, the 
CPMP concluded on 25 March 1999 that a positive opinion could be granted provided that particular 
precautions were taken in relation with the hypersensitivity reactions of concern in the safety profile of 
this antiretroviral agent.  
At that time, the risk/benefit ratio was not considered to be in favour of the recommendation of Ziagen 
for use in children and adolescents due to insufficient data. Particular concerns were raised about the 
incidence  and  difficulty  of  diagnosis  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  in  paediatrics.  It  was  decided  that 
the paediatric indication would be re-evaluated when more clinical experience would be available in 
adult  patients (with close  monitoring  and post-marketing surveillance)  to  better assess the  impact  of 
the  hypersensitivity  reactions  in  the  therapeutic  use  when  the  final  report  of  the  PENTA  (Paediatric 
European Network for Treatment of AIDS) 5 study would become available.  
With this type II variation the Marketing Authorisation Holder of Ziagen, submits the request for the 
extension of the indication to paediatric patients aged 3 months up to 18 years. 
The development in paediatric patients has been completed since the original submission, in particular 
results of one pivotal study in antiretroviral naive children, PENTA 5 is provided. Moreover, since the 
medicinal  product  has  been  registered  in  the  US  for  more  than  one  year,  data  on  the  US  post-
marketing experience are submitted.

Preclinical Data 
Preclinical data were presented in the original centralised application dossier. It included two studies 
performed in the juvenile rat.  
The toxicity of abacavir in young animals has been investigated in order to assess the influence of age 
on the toxicity profile of abacavir. Juvenile Wistar rats were treated from lactation day 3 for 31 and 
61 days  at  dosages  up  to  450  mg/kg  and  360  mg/kg  respectively.  Mortality  was  observed  since 
120 mg/kg with decreased activity, dehydratation and laboured breathing. Liver weight augmentation, 
hepatocellular  hypertrophy,  chronic  kidney  inflammation  with  tubular  dilatation  and  medulla 
mineralisation were observed at 360 mg/kg. Brain weight was significantly decreased at 360 mg/kg in 
both males and females and in females at 120 mg/kg with no recovery at 360 mg/kg. Brain histology 
was normal. 
The  decrease  in  brain  weight  was  probably  related  to  a  malnutrition  of  juvenile  rats  related  to  the  
toxicity  of  abacavir  (reduction  of  lactation).  The  CPMP  requested  that  this  issue  should  be  further 
explored. 
Consequently,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  committed  to  co-ordinate  a  review  by  an 
independent group of experts of the available data (brain histology) from the juvenile toxicology study 
to further evaluate the possibility for a direct effect of abacavir on brain growth and to submit a report 
on this review. 
Otherwise, the toxicity profile was similar between juvenile and adults rats. No amendments to section 
5.3  “Preclinical safety data” are necessary.

Clinical Data 
2.1  Pharmacokinetics

Data  in  children  from  3 months  to  13  years  of  age  were  submitted  with  the  original  marketing 
authorisation application and derived from two studies with the 4 and 8 mg/kg dosage regimens; one 
single dose study (n=22) and one study on the steady state pharmacokinetics (n=47). 
The overall pharmacokinetic parameters in children are comparable to adults with greater variability in 
plasma concentrations. In the single dose study, pharmacokinetics are not linear (probably due to the 
small number of enrolled children in any age group), between the two doses tested, 4 and 8 mg/kg bid. 
Exposures after administration of 4 mg/kg bid are somewhat lower than those in adult patients while 
they are higher after 8 mg/kg bid.  
The 8 mg/kg dose was chosen based on the high variability in exposure and the risk of under-treatment 
of some children. 
2.2  Clinical Efficacy 
In order to demonstrate the utility of abacavir as part of the treatment regimen in HIV infected patients 
the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  new  results  together  with  extended  data  of  already 
submitted studies: 24 weeks study report of PENTA 5 in naive patients; and 48 weeks study report of 
CNAA3006 and 14.3 months study report of  CNAAB3007 in experienced patients. 
3.2.1  PENTA 5 
This  was  a  randomised  partially  blinded  multicentre  comparative  phase  II  trial  designed  to  evaluate 
new antiretroviral regimens as initial therapy for HIV infected children. Three dual NRTIs [zidovudine 
(ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC) / ZDV plus abacavir (ABC)/ 3TC plus ABC] were compared each with 
or without a protease inhibitor [nelfinavir (NFV)]. 
In Part A, for mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic children, ZDV+3TC, ZDV+ABC and 3TC+ABC 
were compared, each with or without NFV in a factorial design. Children were randomised to either 
NFV or NFV placebo in a blinded fashion. The primary endpoints were serious laboratory (grade 3 or 
4)  or  clinical  events.  In  Part  B,  for  advanced  or  symptomatic  children  ZDV+3TC,  ZDV+ABC  and 
3TC+ABC  were  compared  and  all  children  received  NFV.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the  effect  on 
change in viral load by week 24 as measured by plasma HIV-1 RNA and serious laboratory (grade 3 
or 4) or clinical events.  
The dosing scheme was ZDV 360 mg/m²/day,  ABC 16 mg/kg/day,  3TC 8 mg/kg/day and  NFV 20-
30 mg/kg/dose, given 3 times daily. Overall, 130 children were randomised.  
The median age in the children was 5.3 years (range 0.3 – 16.7 ), with a baseline median viral load of  
119313  copies/ml  (range  29348  –  294420)  and  a  median  CD4  cell  count  of  545  /mm3  (range  331  – 
992). 
Analysis on activity are only discussed on the pooled data (part A + part B).  
Results at 24 and 48 weeks (ITT analysis) 
Over 88% of children remained on their original randomised regimen at 24 weeks.  Adherence in all 
treatment  arms  was  good  with  the  proportion  of  time  spent  on  randomised  therapy  to  24  weeks  of 
93%, 86% and 92% for the  ZDV/3TC, ZDV/ABC and ABC/3TC arms respectively. 
The  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  decreased  from  baseline  by  a  mean  of  2.1,  2.6  and  2.8  log10  copies/ml  at 
week  24  (global  p=0.01)  in  the  ZDV/3TC,  ZDV/ABC  and  3TC/ABC  groups  respectively  in  the 
unadjusted  analysis  regardless  of  the  presence  of  nelfinavir  (see  table  ab  1).  The  differences  in 
AUCMB (Area Under Curve Minus Baseline) of log10 HIV RNA between the 3 groups from baseline 
to 24 weeks was not statistically significant. The  proportion of children with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≤

400  copies/ml  was  significantly  greater  in  the  abacavir  containing  arms  than  in  the  ZDV/3TC  arm 
(table 2). There was no significant difference between the three arms in the proportion of children with 
HIV RNA ≤ 50 copies/ml.

This study is pivotal in the paediatric population. In antiretroviral naive children at advanced stage of 
HIV infection, a dual NRTI combination including abacavir (ZDV+ABC or 3TC +ABC) produces a 
substantial viral suppression in comparison with ZDV+3TC combination, regardless of the presence of 
NFV.  
With  this  application  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  submitted  also  48 week  results  that  have 
been submitted recently for publication. The Marketing Authorisation Holder committed to submit the 
final publication once available. 
When  comparing  proportions  ≤  50  copies/m,  although  only  a  trend  in  favour  of  the  abacavir 
containing  treatments  arms  is  seen  at  24  weeks,  by  48  weeks  the  proportion  of  children  receiving 
3TC/ABC with ≤50 copies/ml is significantly greater than that in the ZDV/3TC arm. This change over 
time can be  explained by it taking longer  for patients, in particular children with high baseline viral 
loads, to achieve a reduction to less than 50 copies than to less than 400 copies. The smaller numbers 
of  patients  achieving  a  viral  response  ≤50  copies/ml  at  24  weeks  therefore  made  it  difficult  to 
demonstrate  an  early  treatment  difference.  At  48  weeks  the  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  3TC/ABC 
group with less than 50 copies/ml had increased from that observed at 24 weeks, whilst the proportion 
of subjects with less than 400 copies/ml remained very similar to that at 24 weeks. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  proposed  to  include  this  information  in  the  SPC  section 
5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties” as follows: 
 Clinical experience: Clinical studies in antiretroviral-naïve patients:  
“In  a  study  comparing  the  unblinded  NRTI  combinations  (with  or  without  blinded  nelfinavir)  in 
children,  a  greater  proportion  treated  with  abacavir  and  lamivudine  (71%)  or  abacavir  and 
zidovudine  (60%)  had  HIV-1  RNA  ≤  400  copies/ml  at  48  weeks  compared  with  those  treated  with 
lamivudine and zidovudine (47%)[ p=0.09, intention to treat analysis]. Similarly, greater proportions 
treated with the abacavir containing combinations had HIV-1 RNA ≤50 copies/ml at 48 weeks (53%, 
42% and 28% respectively, p=0.07)”

3.2.2  CNAA3006 
Randomised, double-blind 48-weeks study in anti-retroviral experienced [>12 weeks previous therapy 
either  ZDV  (79%),  3TC  (55%)  or  other  therapy]  children  aged  >90  days  and  <12  years  old.  The 
primary  endpoint  of  the  study  was  the  proportion  of  patients  with  HIV-1  RNA  <10000 copies/ml. 
Medicinal products were administered as follows: placebo or abacavir solution (20  mg/ml, 8 mg/kg) 
added on to ZDV (180 mg/m3 bid) + 3TC (4 mg/kg bid). The switch criterion was viral load ≥10000 
copies/ml where patients either received open label triple therapy or other combinations or continued 
blinded  treatment  or  withdrawal  from  the  trial.  24  weeks  data  were  available  in  the  original 
submission, the Marketing Authorisation Holder now provides 48 week data. 
Median age in the children were 5.7 (range 0.6 - 13) years with no patients under 5 months and a few 
under 30 months of age. Other baseline characteristics are summarised below:

Results at 48 weeks 
A  total  of  155  of  205  patients  completed  48  weeks,  73  in  the  triple  therapy  and  82  in  the  double 
therapy group. Overall, 24% of subjects withdrew by week 48, predominantly due to adverse events in 
the abacavir group. Therefore, these long term data should be interpreted with precaution.  
The  proportion  of  patients  with  HIV-1  RNA  <  10  000  copies/ml  at  week  48  is  described  in  the 
following table which controls for randomisation stratum (by age and previous treatment) and baseline

In  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  the  proportion  of  patients  in  the  Intent  To  Treat  Population  who 
achieved  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  <  10  000  copies/ml  at  week  48  is  not  significantly  different  in  the 
ABC/ZDV/3TC  group  and  in  the  ZDV/3TC  group,  but  a  trend  is  observed  for  a  greater  viral 
suppression in the ABC group. 
However,  an  inherent  bias  of  the  As  Treated  analysis  is  that  it  excludes  patients  who  discontinued 
randomised treatment prior to Week 48, and this percentage was higher in the ABC group than in the 
control group (28% versus 20%).  
Greater antiviral activity with the addition of ABC was evidenced by greater median reduction from 
baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA with ABC/ZDV/3TC versus ZDV/3TC through 48 weeks of treatment. 
The  median  AUCMB  for  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  was  significantly  lower  in  ABC  group  than  in  the 
control group (ITT : - 0.47 versus - 0.21 log10 copies/ml, p<0.0001). It should be underlined that ABC 
has only demonstrated a slight impact in terms of HIV-1 RNA change from baseline (approximately - 
0.5 log10 copies/ml). 
The  normalised  area  under  the  curve  (NAUC)  for  CD4+cell  count  (which  allows  to  stabilise  the 
variability naturally observed in the CD4+ cell counts in children) through week 16 was slighty greater 
in  the  ABC  group  than  in  the  control  group  (ITT  :  1.11  versus  1.01,  p=0.279).  Besides  the  median 
increase from baseline in CD4+ cell count was 52 cells/mm3 in the ABC/ZDV/3TC group compared 
with 5 cells/mm3 in the ZDV/3TC group. The clinical relevance of this slight effect on the CD4+ cell 
count is not known. 
3.2.3  CNAA 3007 
This  was  an  open  label,  compassionate  use  study  aiming  at  providing  access  to  abacavir  for  infants 
and  children  [mean  age  7.9  years  (range  0.7-18.6)]  with  advanced  HIV-1  infection,  failing  or 
intolerant  to  standard  therapy.  The  regimen  initiated  in  the  study  included  abacavir  and  at  least  one 
other antiretroviral  that  the  child  had  not received  previously. The  dosage  of  abacavir  was  8 mg/ kg 
BID.  
Data on 74 enrolled patients were presented with the original submission. Now data on 154 patients 
are presented with this application. 
The paediatric population in this ‘compassionate use’ of abacavir was at advanced stage of the disease. 
Two thirds of the subjects had at least one prior AIDS-defining illness. Over 98% of children had prior 
NRTI therapy, 25% NNRTIs and 73% PIs. Concomitant antiretrovirals at month 1 included d4T (59% 
of children), nelfinavir (41%), ritonavir (30%) and nevirapine (27%). 
Baseline median CD4 cell count was 245 cells/mm3,  median CD4 % at 13.5% and a median viral load 
at 240 000 copies/ml. After 2 months a modest - 0.44 log copies/ml viral load change from baseline 
has been demonstrated.

Up to 30 September 2000, approximately 657 children and adolescents between 3 months and 18 years 
of  age  have  received  abacavir  through  clinical  trials,  including  expanded  access  and  named  patient 
programmes. Three hundred and seven children (47%) are between 6 and 12 years old. 
3.3.2  Deaths 
A total of 8 deaths in paediatric subjects have been reported to the Marketing Authorisation Holder, all 
of which were reported in patients enrolled in clinical trials.  Of these, none were related to possible 
hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir and 7 were considered to be unrelated to abacavir therapy. 
3.3.3  Serious Adverse events 
The  main  point  of  concern  is  the  occurrence  of  hypersensitivity  reactions,  which  may  be  fatal  with 
hypotension and with risk of multi-organ involvement. 
Hypersensitivity reactions  
Up to 30 September 2000, a total of 43 serious cases have been reported in children and adolescents 
aged  3  months  up  to  18  years  (28  cases  in  clinical  trials  and  expanded  access  programmes  and  15 
cases through spontaneous reporting). 
The  children  were  aged  between  4  months  to  16  years:  5  (12%)  were  aged  between  4  months  – 
2 years, 7 (16%) were aged between 2 – 5 years and 31 (72%) were aged 6 – 12 years. Thirty children 
(70%) were male. 
The time to onset of symptoms ranged from 1 day to 61 weeks. The majority of the hypersensitivity 
reactions  were  in  clinical  trials  (65%,  28/43).  In  22  cases  (51%),  a  hospitalisation  was  required.  No 
cases were fatal but three cases (7%) were considered to be life-threatening. 
Five  cases  of  the  43  (11.6%)  possible  hypersensitivity  reactions  involved  rechallenge  with  abacavir. 
Hypersensitivity  reactions  in  children  were  seen  with  the  same  frequency  as  has  been  described  in 
adults (4.3% and 4.1%, respectively in children and adults). The clinical symptoms are not different, 
however rash (81% and 67%) and gastrointestinal manifestations (70% and 54%) were more frequent 
in children than in adults. Even though  there were no fatal cases of hypersensitivity reactions and only 
3 life-threatening  cases,  particular  attention in  the  diagnosis  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  in children 
has to be ensured. Indeed some symptoms are difficult to report in this population (nausea, arthralgia, 
malaise). Other symptoms such as fever, diarrhoea, pharyngitis are common in small children, which 
might render the diagnosis more hazardous. Therefore, information for the adult in charge of the child 
must be particularly clear. 
Serious  adverse  events  other  than  hypersensitivity  reactions  reported  in  clinical  trials  and  in 
post-marketing surveillance 
Eighty-nine  cases  with  at  least  one  serious  adverse  event  have  been  reported  to  the  Marketing 
Authorisation  Holder  in  subjects  participating  in  clinical  trials,  excluding  possible  hypersensitivity 
reactions.  Of  these,  23  were  considered  possibly  related  to  study  medication  or  the  causality  was 
unknown and 66 were considered to be unrelated by investigator to study medication.  
Events possibly related to mitochondrial toxicity 
Mitochondrial toxicity has been causally attributed to the use of some nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors.  The  pattern  of  events  ascribed  to  mitochondrial  toxicity  varies  with  different  agents  but 
includes 
lipid  disorders,  myopathy  and 
haematological toxicity.  
lactic  acidosis,  pancreatitis,  peripheral  neuropathy, 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Only  one  case  of  peripheral  neuropathy  has  been  reported  as  a  serious  adverse  event  possibly 
attributable to abacavir. This case occurred in a child with late stage HIV disease and does not provide 
evidence that this event was related to  mitochondrial toxicity. This case was clearly confounded by 
Ziagen-H-252-II-05-AR

other  factors  and  showed  an  improvement  following  stopping  abacavir,  although    was  this  effect 
confirmed  by  subsequently  restarting  therapy.  However,  there  is  little  evidence  to  suggest    that  this 
case  is  indicative  of  new  safety  signals. Peripheral  neuropathy is known to  be    associated with HIV 
disease and the child also had a history of recurrent zoster and MAI infection and wasting. Dizziness 
has been reported in some cases of  hypersensitivity reactions where it is considered to be secondary to 
other  systemic  effects  of  the  reaction.  Overall,  it  has  been  reported  with  a  similar  incidence  in  the 
abacavir and control groups in most clinical trials in adults but is rarely reported in children. 
Lipid disorders 
Clinical  adverse  events  suggestive  of  lipid  disorders  have  not  been  identified  to  date  in  children 
receiving  therapy  with  abacavir.  Fasting  lipid  data  were  available  for  73  children  enrolled  in 
PENTA 5. Using the closest measurement to week 48, differences between the 3 nucleoside backbone 
groups  and  between  the  nelfinavir  and  nelfinavir  placebo  groups  were  not  clinically  relevant  but 
numbers were very small. 
Myopathy 
No  cases  of  myopathy,  including  cardiomyopathy,  have  been  reported  to  date  in  children  either  as 
serious adverse events in clinical trials or through post marketing surveillance. There is no evidence 
from  CNAA3006  or  PENTA5  that  myopathy  is  associated  with  abacavir  therapy;  creatine 
phosphokinase levels were not measured in these studies. 
Haematological disorders 
There is no evidence to suggest that haematological disorders are causally related to abacavir therapy, 
either  in  adults  or  children.  The  incidence  of  these  events  is  similar  in  clinical  trials  between  the 
treatment  and  control  groups  and  post  marketing  surveillance  has  not  indicated  any  previously 
unrecognised  effects.  Clinically  significant  anaemia  was  reported  in  one  child  (1%)  receiving  
abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine  in  PENTA5,  and  grade  3  or  4  decreased  haemoglobin  in  one  child 
receiving abacavir in CNAA3006 
compared  to  3  (3%)  in  the  control  group.  Clinically  significant  neutropenia  was  reported  in  6/92 
children  (7%)  in  the  abacavir  group  in  PENTA5  compared  to  3/36  (8%)  in  the  group  not  receiving 
abacavir,  and  grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  was  recorded  in  2%  in  the  abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine 
group and 3% in the control group in CNAA3006. 
Pregnancies 
One pregnancy has been reported in a 17 year old adolescent female who received abacavir therapy in 
the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy;  therapy  was  continued  and  the  outcome  of  pregnancy  is  not  yet 
known. 
Children below 3 months of age 
No  safety concerns have  been  raised from  the limited  data available  from  children aged  <3  months. 
Marketing authorisation is not sought for this age group at this time. 
Available safety data are limited to that obtained from neonates born to mothers who 
received  abacavir  during  pregnancy  and  9  neonates  enrolled  in  an  ongoing  single  dose  study  of 
abacavir in pharmacokinetics in newborn infants (PACTG321). 
There have been four cases of foetal or neonatal abnormalities reported in pregnant women receiving 
abacavir but not discernible pattern in birth defects. Three cases involved live births and the reported 
abnormalities were hypospadias, an extra digit on the right hand, and bilateral club foot (the twin of 
this infant was normal). In a further set of twins, twin to twin transfusion resulted in intrauterine death 
of  both  babies  at  24  weeks  gestation;  one  twin  was  reported  to  have  an  enlarged  bladder.  In  the 
pharmacokinetic study, PACTG321, 9 neonates less than 30 days of age were given a single oral dose

of 2mg/kg (Johnson et al, 2000). Abacavir disposition appeared to be substantially different from that 
observed in children or adults and dose of 2 mg/kg of abacavir yielded AUC values in the infants that 
was similar or greater than the recommended dose of 8 mg/kg in older children. This dose was well 
tolerated; one infant developed neutropenia, which resolved without intervention, which was felt to be 
related to the background zidovudine therapy. 
Long term treatment effects 
Approximately  227  children  have  been  treated  for  more  than  a  year  and  the  maximum  duration  of 
abacavir treatment in children and adolescents in clinical studies to date is about 142 weeks. No long 
term effects have been identified to date.  
Withdrawal effects 
No withdrawal effects have been reported in patients receiving abacavir, regardless of age.

Changes to the Product Information 
The  proposal  of  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  to  amend  the  Product  Information  was  overall 
endorsed. 
Furthermore the CPMP decided the following additional amendments : 
Sections 4.8 “Undesirable effects”  
The  profile  of  HSR  is  highlighted  by  the  frequency  (4.3  %)  and  by  the  characteristics  of  clinical 
symptoms.  Since  in  particular,  gastrointestinal  symptoms  commonly  accompany  various  viral/ 
bacterial  infections  in  children,  they  could  easily  be  overlooked  and  misinterpreted.  Therefore,  the 
profile of HSR in children should be highlighted by the factual characteristics of clinical symptoms in 
section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Therefore the following sentence has been added: 
“Rash  (81%  vs  67%,  respectively)  and  gastrointestinal  manifestations  (70%  vs  54%,  respectively) 
were more frequently reported  in children compared to adults.” 
Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic Properties” 
 The CPMP decided to delete the following sentence:  
«   Similarly,  in  children  with  extensive  antiretroviral  exposure,  a  modest  but  sustained  effect  of  the 
combination  of  abacavir,  lamivudine  and  zidovudine  was  observed  (median  reduction  0.61  log10 
copies/ml at 48 weeks). » 
The  question  of  the  durability  of  the  virological  response  is  particularly  difficult  to  solve  through 
clinical  studies  in  HIV  infection,  since  the  proportions  of  lost  to  follow-up,  of  switch  are  usually 
important at long term. 
As a matter of fact, this question has not been adequately addressed in the well designed pivotal study 
CNAAB  3005  (ABC/ZDV/3TC  vs  IDV/ZDV/3TC,  in  antiretroviral  naive  adult  patients).  This 
question is even more difficult to solve in paediatric patients, and considering the high proportion of 
patients who switch therapy at long term in study CNAAB 3006, no relevant information is considered 
to be provided in term of durability from this study. The CPMP considered that the 48 weeks results of 
study  CNAAB  3006  are  not  substantial  and  should  not  be  mentioned  in  section  5.1.  It  is  falsely 
reassuring in term of durability. Overall, the use of antiretroviral drug in paediatric patients is mainly 
based  on  the  substantial  efficacy  data  derived  from  clinical  studies  in  adults  patients  with  specific 
pharmacokinetic  data  in  paediatric  population.  Clinical  studies  in  paediatric  patients  are  helpful  to 
Ziagen-H-252-II-05-AR

confirm  the  adequacy  of  the  extrapolation  of  adults  data  to  paediatric  population.  The  issue  of 
durability is crucial and is not adequately addressed by the 48 weeks data of the CNAAB 3006 study, 
with a premature discontinuation rate of 47%.

Additional Commitments 
Educational Programme  
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  commits  to  extend  the  core  information  from  the  current  HSR 
educational  programme  to  include  paediatric-specific  elements  as  described  below,  to  highlight  to 
prescribers, healthcare providers and parents/guardians the serious nature of hypersensitivity reactions. 
The  key  objectives  and  messages  of  the  HSR  educational  programme  will  be  consistent  with  those 
previously implemented for adults. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder will supplement the current core information by expansion of the 
current education program, all paediatric marketing literature will always mention the hypersensitivity 
reaction, the  information booklet which currently accompanies the HSR  video will be supplemented 
with  an  additional  insert  to  cover  paediatric  issues,  the  development  of  a  parent/guardian-oriented 
Questions  and  Answers »,  brochure  to  cover  hypersensitivity  to  abacavir  and  paediatric-specific 
issues. 
Furthermore,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  commits  to  submit  all  paediatric  HSR  educational 
materials,  the  video  and  the  corresponding  information  booklet  to  the  national  agencies  before 
promotion  of  the  indication  in  the  EU  member  states.  The  national  agencies  will  be  requested  to 
provide any comments on the proposed HSR educational materials within three weeks. 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  commits  to  submit  the  educational  programme  and  material 
proposed for the paediatric population (parents and /or legal guardians) by 20 July 2001 for a thorough 
critical review by the CPMP. 
Specific Post-Marketing Surveillance 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder committed to  
- 
- 
provide  monthly  line  listings  of  all  cases  of  hypersensitivity  reactions  and  cases  with  a  fatal 
outcome  in  children  aged  under  18  years,  for  the  first  six-months  following  the  Commission 
Decision on this variation 
present in the further PSURs of Ziagen, the  adverse events in paediatric patients separately from 
those  occurred  in  adults.  When  possible  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  will  make  a 
distinction  between  antiretroviral  naive  and  experienced  children  in  the  presentation  of  the 
adverse events in paediatric patients.

Benefit/risk assessment  
Abacavir is available as oral solution, which is an adequate formulation for paediatric use. Based on 
the  previously  submitted  pharmacokinetic  studies,  the  dose  has  been  adequately  determined  in 
children  over  3  months  compared  to  pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  adults:  the  recommended  dose 
should be 8 mg/kg BID. 
Three  studies  have  been  performed  with  abacavir  as  oral  solution  in  paediatric  patients.  Like  for 
adults,  abacavir  has  demonstrated  a  substantial  virological  response  in  antiretroviral  naive  patients 
whereas the benefit was limited in experienced children.  
The main problem with abacavir are the hypersensitivity reactions. The frequency of hypersensitivity 
reactions in children does not differ from that seen in adults. Clinical manifestation of hypersensitivity 
reaction  in  children  are  similar  to  those  observed  in  adults,  even  though  rash  and  gastrointestinal 
Ziagen-H-252-II-05-AR 
10/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symptoms  are  more  common  in  children.  Particular  attention  has  to  be  given  to  the  information 
dealing with HSR reactions provided to prescribers and the adult in charge of the child. 
To  ensure  the  safe  use  in  paediatric  patients,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  has  made  
commitments  to  enlarge  the  educational  programme  already  implemented  since  the  Marketing 
Authorisation of Ziagen, to encompass prescribers in charge of paediatric population and to perform a 
specific post marketing surveillance in paediatric patients. In addition, the profile of HSR in children 
is highlighted by the factual characteristics of clinical symptoms in section 4.8 of the SPC . 
Altogether  these  particular  precautions  are  expected  to  control  the  risk  of  HSR  in  the  paediatric  
population.  
Based  on  the  CPMP  review  of  data  on  safety  and  efficacy  and  the  commitments  undertaken  by  the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder, the CPMP considered by consensus that the benefit/ risk  profile of 
Ziagen in the combination treatment of HIV infection of paediatric patients was favourable and issued 
a positive opinion on the extension of the therapeutic indications to include the paediatric population.  
III.  CONCLUSION 
The CPMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the proposed wordings to 
be introduced into the Summary of Product Characteristics and reflected in the Package Leaflet, based 
on the observations and the appropriate conclusions. 
The CPMP adopted on 27 June 2001 an Opinion on a Type II variation to be made to the terms of the 
Community Marketing Authorisation.

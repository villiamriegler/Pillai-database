The MAH agreed to include pulmonary fibrosis as an 
adverse drug reaction. However, the MAH submitted a 
justification for not updating the SmPC to include 
respiratory failure providing additional information. 
The CHMP did not agree with the MAH´s justification since 
available information indicates a causal role of 
temozolomide for the development of respiratory failure 
and its associated risk of fatality. Therefore, an update of 
the SmPC with this information was requested (section 4.4 
and 4.8).

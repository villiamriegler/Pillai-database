2.2.2.  Active  substance 
General information 
The chemical name of sunitinib is N-(2-(diethylamino)ethyl)-5-((Z)-(5-fluoro-1,2-dihydro-2-oxo-3H-
indol-3-ylidene)methyl)-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxamide corresponding to the molecular 
formula C22H27FN4O2. It has a relative molecular mass of 398.47 g/mol and the following structure in 
Figure 1: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of sunitinib was inferred from the route of synthesis and elucidated by a 
combination of Infra-red spectroscopy (IR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) (1H-NMR 
and 13C-NMR) and Mass spectrometry. 
The active substance is a yellow or orange yellow non-hygroscopic powder which has low pH-
dependent solubility in aqueous media. It is more soluble in strongly acidic media but practically 
insoluble above pH 5. 
Sunitinib exhibits polymorphism. The polymorphic forms of Sunitinib can be distinguished by XRD and 
the manufacturing process followed and described in the ASMF is capable of consistently producing 
same polymorphic form of Sunitinib.  
Sunitinib is achiral.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  
Three sites are involved in the manufacture of the active substance; one site performs the 
manufacture of one intermediate, the second one performs the manufacture of another intermediate 
and the third one performs the manufacture of the final AS. The starting materials are introduced in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/2430/2021  
Page 9/32 
 
 
 
 
 
the defined manufacturing process. The starting materials are acceptable and are controlled by suitable 
specifications. In addition, acceptable specifications for reagents, solvents and other materials used in 
the synthesis have been provided. Critical steps of the process were identified and are controlled by 
justified and appropriate in-process controls.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. The information presented regarding potential 
impurities/degradation products controlled in the active substance is sufficient. Overall, the defined 
control strategy is satisfactory. 
Sunitinib is packed in a white LDPE bag within a black polyethylene bag, stored within a triple 
laminated aluminium foil bag inside a fibre drum with silica gel desiccant, the combination of which 
provides moisture and light protection. The bags are filled with argon. The primary packing material 
complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, XRD), water 
content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (potentiometry), residual 
solvents (GC), particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.), and microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification limits for impurities/degradation products and residual solvents, are in accordance 
with the requirements of ICH guidelines Q3A and Q3C. All solvents used throughout the entire 
synthetic process, including those employed prior to the starting material, are routinely controlled in 
the specification and specified at levels below the ICH Q3C thresholds.  
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  non-compendial  methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. The finished product manufacturers have 
adopted the analytical methods for appearance, related substances, assay and residual solvents from 
ASMF  holder.  All  other  analytical  methods  are  Ph.  Eur.  The  specification  of  the  finished  product 
manufacturer  is  fully  in  line  with  the  specification  of  the  active  substance  manufacturer.  Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from several production scale batches generated by both active substance and 
finished product manufacturers is provided, demonstrating compliance with the proposed 
specifications. The batch data provided is considered to be sufficient. Consistency and uniformity of the 
active substance quality have been demonstrated.  
Stability 
Stability data from several commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed 
manufacturer stored for up to 12 months under long term conditions (5±3°C) and for up to six months 
under accelerated conditions (25±2°C/ 65±5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Some of these batches were manufactured using intermediate from a previous manufacturer. The 
accelerated study in the current container from long term batch and several accelerated batches were 
stored in the intended commercial pack, (argon-purged white LDPE bags inside argon-filled black 
polyethylene bags inside argon-filled triple laminated aluminium bags inside fibre drums with silica gel 
desiccant) and the other batches were stored in the previous packaging format. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. In the original pack stored at 25°C / 60% RH, an 
upwards trend for impurities was observed. Therefore, a more protective format was introduced and 
the favoured storage conditions changed from 25°C / 60% RH to 5 ± 3°C. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/2430/2021

Forced degradation studies were conducted for related substances under different stressed conditions 
like acid, alkali, hydrogen peroxide and thermal. The related substances method was shown to be 
stability indicating. The peak purity of sunitinib and degradation product peaks under all stressed 
conditions, was satisfactory. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 42 months stored in the 
proposed revised packaging, protected from light and at a temperature between 2 and 8°C. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The drug product is a hard capsule for oral administration containing 12.5, 25, 37.5 and 50 mg of 
sunitinib. The capsules presented as follows: 
12.5 mg: Gelatin capsules of size 4 with orange cap and orange body, printed with white ink “12.5 mg” 
on the body and containing yellow to orange granules. 
25 mg: Gelatin capsules of size 3 with caramel cap and orange body, printed with white ink “25 mg” on 
the body and containing yellow to orange granules. 
37.5 mg: Gelatin capsules of size 2 with yellow cap and yellow body, printed with black ink “37.5 mg” 
on the body and containing yellow to orange granules. 
50 mg: Gelatin capsules of size 1 with caramel cap and caramel body, printed with white ink “50 mg” 
on the body and containing yellow to orange granules. 
Sunitinib 12.5, 25, 37.5 and 50 mg hard capsules were developed to be physically and chemically 
stable for the assigned shelf life and equivalent to the reference product Sutent hard capsules, with 
microcrystalline cellulose as the only difference in the qualitative composition. In addition, Sunitinib 
Accord uses the free base of the active substance whereas the reference product is manufactured with 
the malate salt. 
Sunitinib is practically insoluble in water, very slightly soluble in methanol and alcohol, slightly soluble 
in dichloromethane and sparingly soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide. It also exhibits a pH dependent 
solubility gradient with the highest solubility observed in acidic media. Sunitinib is a BCS class IV 
compound with low solubility and low permeability across physiological pH range. 
A compatibility study was performed to examine the interaction between the active substance and the 
proposed excipients. Binary mixtures of sunitinib and each excipient as well as the final formulation 
mixture were wetted with water in a pre-defined ratio, dried and then stressed for 4 weeks at 
40°C/75% RH in open amber glass vials. The HPLC test results for impurity levels indicated no or only 
small increase in impurities. No incompatibility has been found. 
The whole formulation development was conducted on the highest strength capsule and then designed 
proportionally to create the lower, 12.5, 25, and 37.5 mg strengths. The formulation development of 
the 50 mg capsule is presented. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. 
The stability of representative formulation batches stored for a period of 6 months under accelerated 
conditions was satisfactory and as such the final formulation and process were established.

Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic characteristics (PK) as well as the in vitro dissolution and 
physicochemical characteristics of the reference product a quality target product profile was defined. 
The main critical quality attributes were defined. These are identified as attributes that may be 
impacted by formulation and/or process variables and were therefore investigated formulation and 
process development studies. 
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same as that intended for marketing. 
Essential similarity between the reference product and the proposed product has been shown through 
pharmaceutical equivalence testing and two pivotal bioequivalence studies (fasted and fed conditions) 
between the 50 mg strengths of the test and reference product. Comparative dissolution, assay and 
impurity profiles of sunitinib 50 mg hard capsules and the innovator product as used in the BE studies 
have been presented.  
However, the test product is considered to be bioequivalent to the reference product based on the 
clinical bioequivalence studies. 
The comparison of the dissolution profile in 0.1 N HCL of the bio-batch and other five 50 mg strength 
pilot batches of Sunitinib 50 mg hard capsules proved that the bio-batch is representative of the other 
batches manufactured using the intended commercial process.  
Additionally, the applicant requested a biowaiver of lower strengths 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 35.7 mg on 
the basis that the conditions defined in the Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence were 
fulfilled: all the strengths are manufactured by the same manufacturer and by the same manufacturing 
process, the qualitative composition of all strengths is the same, and the proposed formulations of the 
12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg and 50 mg (bio strength) capsules are dose proportional. 
The individual dissolution results, average and RSD values have been provided. Similarity factors were 
calculated where applicable (pH 4.5 and 6.8). The results of the in vitro dissolution study indicate that 
the dissolution profiles of Sunitinib 12.5, 25 and 37.5 mg are similar to the bio-batch of Sunitinib 50 
mg. 
Because of the different salt form in the reference product, solubility of sunitinib base and sunitinib 
malate were measured in different media in pH range. Based on this, it is concluded that the solubility 
of sunitinib base is highly pH dependent.  
The ability to discriminate between compliant and non-compliant batches was tested by comparison of 
a batch with proposed qualitative and quantitative composition and a batch with a different amount of 
binder and diluent. The dissolution profiles in the current proposed QC medium showed a much lower 
dissolution rate in the non-compliant batch. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has 
been demonstrated satisfactorily. 
The primary packaging is white aluminium-OPA/Alu/PVC blisters, aluminium-OPA/Alu/PVC perforated 
unit dose blisters and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with child resistant polypropylene 
closures. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of container closure 
systems has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by two manufacturers. The manufacturing process consists of 5 
main steps: dispensing (weighing and sieving), granulation, drying, blending and filling. The process is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The same manufacturing process is at both of the proposed commercial manufacturing sites.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/2430/2021  
Page 12/32 
 
 
 
The critical steps identified are drying of the granules, capsule filling and packaging controlled by 
several IPCs. Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It 
has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The proposed holding times are acceptable. The 
manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail and the in-process controls are adequate 
for hard capsules. 
Process validation data on several commercial scale batches at the respective batch sizes were 
provided. All batches met the in-process and finished product acceptance criteria. The presented 
process validation data confirm that the process is adequately controlled. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), identification of sunitinib (HPLC, UV), identification of titanium dioxide (in house), 
identification of iron oxide (in house), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph.Eur. content uniformity), water content (KF), uniformity of mass (Ph. 
Eur.) and microbial examination (Ph. Eur.).  
The potential presence of class 1 and 2A elemental impurities in the finished product has been 
assessed following a risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities 
by both finished product manufacturers. No Type 2B or Type 3 elemental impurities were included 
because none of them are intentionally added during manufacture of the raw materials. Batch analysis 
data on several batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each 
relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory.   
Risk assessments, in line with the “Questions and answers on Information on nitrosamines for 
marketing authorisation holders” and the “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation 
holders” published on the EMA website, have been presented for the finished product manufacturing 
process for both manufacturers and the active substance with respect to potential formation of 
nitrosamine impurities. The risk of nitrosamine contamination due to the API has been discussed in the 
risk assessment of the API supplier who provided the confirmatory testing of three batches by a 
validated GC-MS method and no nitrosamine was detected.  
A further risk of nitrosamine formation comes from the presence of the tertiary amine moiety in the 
API which could potentially react with any nitrite impurities present in the excipients or packaging 
during finished product manufacture. Sunitinib is indicated for the treatment of advanced cancer and 
as such, limits for nitrosamines in the finished product would be set in line with ICH Q3B. The MAA 
commits to submitting a consolidated risk evaluation further considering all of the above aspects by 
end of March 2021 and to conducting confirmatory testing of API and finished product by end of 2021. 
This is considered acceptable given the posology and advanced cancer indication. The benefit/risk of 
the product is considered positive despite this outstanding issue which will be addressed post-approval.   
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been presented. 
Batch analysis data was provided for several full-scale batches per presentation of 25 mg and 37.5 mg 
and several full-scale batches per presentation of 12.5 mg and 50 mg manufactured at one finished 
product manufacturing site; and several full-scale batches per presentation manufactured at the other

finished product manufacturing site, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released onto the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from several production scale batches of 12.5 and 50 mg capsules and several 
production scale batches of 25 and 37.5 mg capsules were manufactured and were tested for their 
stability. Several validation batches were manufactured at one of the finished product manufacturers 
and other several validation and pilot scale stability batches were manufactured at the second finished 
product manufacturer. Batches were stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25ºC ± 
2ºC / 60% ± 5% RH), up to 12 months under intermediate conditions (30°C ± 2°C, 65% ± 5% RH) 
and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C ± 2°C, 75% ± 5% RH) according to the 
ICH guidelines. The batches of Sunitinib Accord hard capsules are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The tested batches were 
packed either in aluminium-OPA/Alu/PVC blisters, HDPE bottles with PP child resistant closure or in the 
bulk packaging.  
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes have been observed and 
the same manufacturing process is applied at both sites.  
In addition, Sunitinib finished product was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products, packaged in both blisters and HDPE 
bottles. The results of the study indicate that upon direct exposure, the product is not sensitive to 
light, so for Sunitinib 12.5, 25, 37.5 and 50 mg hard capsules in aluminium-OPA/Alu/PVC blisters and 
in HDPE bottles, no special storage conditions with respect to light are required. 
A forced degradation study was also carried out. The results obtained confirm the stability indicative 
nature of the assay and related substances methods under thermal, alkaline, acidic and aqueous 
hydrolysis conditions. The active substance degrades significantly under oxidative conditions. 
According to the obtained stability results under accelerated and long-term conditions packed in HDPE 
bottles and additional open-dish studies, there is no indication that Sunitinib hard capsules are 
susceptible to deterioration and therefore no in-use stability studies have been performed. Usually, the 
storage condition “Store in the original packaging to protect from moisture” is applied to gelatin 
capsules, which are known to be sensitive to moisture. The open dish study has proved that the water 
content only increases slightly, and that appearance, assay, dissolution, and related substances are not 
affected after one-month storage at 25°C/60% RH. Therefore, the statement regarding protection from 
moisture is not required. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months with no special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEPs from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture are provided.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
Assessment report

uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. Sunitinib Accord 
capsules of all strengths have been shown to be bioequivalent to the reference product. However, the 
MAA submitted a partial risk assessment concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
medicinal product. The result of confirmatory testing provided by API supplier is that no nitrosamine 
was detected. Sunitinib is indicated for the treatment of advanced cancer and as such, limits for 
nitrosamines in the finished product would be set in line with ICH Q3B. The MAA is requested to 
submitting a consolidated risk evaluation by end of March 2021 and to conduct confirmatory testing of 
finished product by end of year 2021. This is considered acceptable given the posology and advanced 
cancer indication. The benefit/risk of the product is considered positive despite this outstanding issue 
which will be addressed post-approval.   
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
The applicant commits to submit a consolidated Nitrosamines risk evaluation further considering all of 
the aspects mentioned in the product specification in section 2.2.3 by end of March 2021, and to 
conduct confirmatory testing of finished product by end of year 2021.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of sunitinib are well known. As 
sunitinib is a widely used, well-known active substance, the applicant has not provided additional 
studies and further studies are not required. The overview based on literature review is, thus, 
appropriate. A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been 
provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why 
there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology 
data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
Discussion on impurity profile of drug substance and drug product has not been provided. Following 
the quality assessment, no concerns of toxicological importance have been identified for drug 
substance specification. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Justification that introduction of Sunitinib Accord hard capsules is considered unlikely to result in any 
significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all sunitinib containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance based on generic nature of the product has been 
provided. This is sufficient.  
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Sunitinib Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is considered unlikely to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/2430/2021  
Page 15/32 
 
 
 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all sunitinib containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Justification provided by the applicant that the introduction of Sunitinib Accord hard capsules is 
considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all sunitinib 
containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance is acceptable. Thus, 
the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of sunitinib are well known. There are 
no concerns from non-clinical perspective. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for hard capsules containing sunitinib. To support the marketing authorisation 
application the applicant conducted 3 bioequivalence studies with cross-over design under fasting / fed 
conditions. These studies were pivotal studies for the assessment. 
The applicant has provided a clinical overview where pharmacology, efficacy and safety of sunitinib 
were discussed. The active substance of Sunitinib Accord 12,5 mg (25 mg, 37,5 mg, 50 mg) hard 
capsules is not considered a new active substance. Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, efficacy and 
safety profiles of sunitinib are well known.  As sunitinib is a widely used, well-known active substance, 
no further studies are required.  An overview based on literature review is, thus, appropriate. 
Information stated in the clinical overview is up-to-date and adequately supported with the scientific 
literature. 
The proposed indication and posology of test product are in line with the reference product Sutent. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Exemption  
Biowaiver is applied for the lower strengths of 12.5, 25 and 37.5 mg capsules. 
In accordance with the ‘Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence’ EMA 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/corr**, if the application concerns several strengths of the active 
substance, a bioequivalence study investigating only one strength may be acceptable if all the 
following conditions are fulfilled: 
a) The pharmaceutical products are manufactured by the same manufacturing process.  
b) The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same.  
c) The composition of the strengths is quantitatively proportional i.e. the ratio between the amount of 
each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is the same for all strengths (for immediate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/2430/2021  
Page 16/32 
 
 
 
 
release products, coating components, capsule shell, colour agents and flavours are not required to 
follow this rule).  
d) Appropriate in vitro dissolution data should confirm the adequacy of waiving additional in vivo 
bioequivalence testing. 
According to the SmPC of the innovator product the area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
(AUC) and Cmax increase proportionally with dose in the dosing ranges of 25 to 100 mg. Additionally, 
the lower therapeutic dose is 25 mg, while the 12.5 mg strength is used for dose adjustments in 12.5 
mg steps, based on individual safety and tolerability. Therefore, although an additional 12.5 mg 
strength is available this is administered to subjects in order to modify their current dose at a total 
dose lying within the linear dose range. Further to the above, Sunitinib hard capsules 12.5, 25, 37.5 
and 50 mg product-specific bioequivalence adopted guidance as published by the EMA authorities 
(EMA/CHMP/315233/2014) suggests that the bioequivalence study should be conducted on the highest 
strength of 50 mg, provided that all biowaiver conditions are fulfilled for the lower strengths. 
According to sunitinib product-specific guidance (EMA/CHMP/315233/2014), the pharmacokinetics for 
sunitinib is linear, thus, in principle, the biowaiver request for the additional lower strengths is 
applicable.   
The justification for request of biowaiver is acceptable. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted three bioequivalence studies.

Study design  
This was a pivotal, single-dose, randomised, open-label, two-period, two-sequence, two-treatment, 
single-centre, two-way crossover study designed to demonstrate comparative bioavailability of 
sunitinib from Sunitinib 50 mg Capsules and Sutent 50 mg Hard Capsules administered to healthy male 
subjects under fasting conditions. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two dosing 
sequences. 
Subjects took their assigned formulation, designated by the randomisation scheme, after at least a 10-
hour fast, with 240 ±3 mL of ambient temperature water at their scheduled timepoint. Subjects were 
instructed not to touch, chew, bite or break the study drug. 
Following a fasting period of at least 4 hours after dosing, subjects were given standardised meals and 
caffeine/methylxanthine-free beverages were provided at approximately 4.5, 9.5 and 13.5 hours after 
dosing in each period. With the exception of the water ingested during drug administration, water was 
not permitted from 1 hour prior to drug administration until 1 hour post-dose, after which water was 
permitted ad libitum. 
Blood samples were taken at the following time points: Pre-dose and at 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 
8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 13, 14, 16, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hours after dosing in each study

POOLED ANAYSIS FOR FED STUDIES (17-VIN-0889): Title: Pooled statistical analysis between 
two, open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period, single-dose, 
crossover oral bioequivalence studies of Sunitinib 50 mg capsule and SUTENT (Sunitinib) 50 mg hard 
capsules of Pfizer Ltd., United Kingdom in healthy, adult, male subjects under fed conditions. (dated 
28/11/2017) 
Statistical Method 
The statistical analysis plan mentioned in the protocol was used to analyse the data. Dataset for 
estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-72, Tmax, AUC0-inf, AUCt/AUCinf, λz and t1/2 
were planned to calculate using non-compartmental model by using Phoenix WinNonlin Version 7.0 
(Pharsight Corporation, USA).  
For Sunitinib, ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-72 were planned to analyse 
by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using PROC GLM in SAS Software, Version 9.4. 
The model statement of PROC GLM in SAS Software included the fixed effects of Sequence, Treatment, 
Period and subject (Sequence). The Sequence effect was planned to test using the Subject (Sequence) 
effect as the error term. The sequence effect was planned to test at the 0.10 level of significance and 
other main effects related to treatment and period were planned to test at the 0.05 level of 
significance.  
Ninety percent confidence intervals for the difference between least square means of test and 
reference formulations were planned to calculate using mean square error, obtained in ANOVA, for ln-
transformed Cmax and AUC0-t for Sunitinib. Ninety percent confidence interval for the geometric least 
squares mean ratio was planned to obtain by taking the exponent of lower and upper limits of 90% 
confidence interval, obtained for the least square mean difference.  
Two one-sided tests, namely Schuirmann’s tests, was employed at 5% level of significance for the 
lower and upper limits of 90% confidence interval to check whether the 90% confidence interval for 
Cmax and AUC0-72 for Sunitinib were entirely within the bioequivalence limits 0.80 - 1.25 (80.00% - 
125.00%). However, the bioequivalence assessment was based on the 90% CI for the primary 
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-72. 
Results 
Final statistical analysis datasets for 17-VIN-0703 and 2135 studies were consisted of 46 and 19 
subjects respectively, therefore pooled pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses was performed over a 
total of 65 subjects.

Conclusions 
Bioequivalence between test product Sunitinib Accord 50 mg capsules and the reference product 
Sutent 50 mg hard capsules with respect to rate and extent of absorption of sunitinib has been shown 
under fasting condition.  
Due to different salt used in Sunitinib Accord compared to reference product Sutent, studies for food 
effect with the highest strength (therapeutic dose) were also conducted. In Study 2135, bioequivalence 
under fed conditions was not demonstrated probably due to one subject with low exposure for the test 
product and small sample size (n=24 subjects). However, in Study 17-VIN-0703 (same design as 
Study 2135) where more subjects (n=50) were recruited bioequivalence under fed conditions was 
demonstrated. In addition, the pooled analysis for Studies 2135 and 17-VIN-0703 showed 
bioequivalence between the test and the reference product under fed condition. 
The results of the bioequivalence study with the 50 mg formulation can be extrapolated to the other 
strengths 12,5 mg (25 mg, 37.5 mg) according to conditions in Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr*, section 4.1.6. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted three bioequivalence studies. 
The study 2134 demonstrated bioequivalence between the test Sunitinib Accord 50 mg Capsules and 
reference Sutent 50 mg under fasting conditions. 
The solubility study between sunitinib base and sunitinib malate (carried out using the shake-flask 
method) demonstrated that the solubility of Sunitinib base is highly pH-dependent. More specifically, 
Sunitinib base showed very poor solubility in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer, lower than 1X, while on the 
other hand, Sunitinib malate exhibited more than 10X solubility in all pH range of 1.0 to 6.8. 
Given the above results indicating marked differences between originator malate salt and test sunitinib 
base in higher pH 6.8 conditions, the applicant decided to additionally conduct a fed study in order to 
confirm comparability “with and without food” and thus to be in line with the administration conditions 
documented in the SmPC of Sutent. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/2430/2021  
Page 28/32 
 
 
 
 
 
As such, two bioequivalence studies (one of them failed to demonstrate bioequivalence) were also 
conducted in order to compare the bioavailability of sunitinib from Sunitinib Accord 50 mg hard 
capsules and Sutent 50 mg hard capsules in healthy male volunteers under fed conditions. 
For Study 0703, the applicant considered ANOVA model which took into account that there were two 
groups of subjects which underwent study in different time periods. This ANOVA model included fixed 
effects group, sequence, sequence by group, formulation by group and period (within group) and 
random effect subject nested within sequence. Such model resembles ANOVA model for two-stage 
design which proceeded to second stage where group is equivalent to stage. According to Questions & 
Answers: positions on specific questions addressed to the Pharmacokinetics Working Party 
(EMA/618604/2008 Rev. 11), section Number of subjects in a two-stage bioequivalence study design, 
such ANOVA model should not include interaction formulation by group and random effect of subject 
nested within sequence by group should be rather fixed effect. During the evaluation procedure the 
applicant was asked to re-evaluate BE based on ANOVA model without interaction formulation by group 
and with inclusion of subject nested within sequence by group as fixed effects. The applicant provided 
the required data therefore the issue was resolved. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented results of bioequivalence studies Sunitinib Accord 50 mg hard capsules (12,5 
mg; 25 mg; 37,5 mg) is now considered bioequivalent with Sutent 50 mg hard capsules (12,5 mg; 25 
mg; 37,5 mg) under fast and fed conditions.

the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Product information 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of sunitinib in hard capsules. The reference product Sutent 
is indicated for the treatment of unresectable and/or metastatic malignant gastrointestinal stromal 
tumour (GIST) in adults after failure of imatinib treatment due to resistance or intolerance; for the 
treatment of advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) in adults; for the treatment of 
unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNET) with disease 
progression in adults. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient.  
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open label, balanced, randomised, two-
treatment, two-sequence, two-period, single-dose, crossover trial. The study design was considered 
adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective 
European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out 
period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods 
applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Sunitinib Accord met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with Sutent. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/2430/2021  
Page 30/32 
 
 
 
AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, 
e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Sunitinib Accord is favourable in the following indication: 
Sunitinib Accord is indicated for the treatment of unresectable and/or metastatic malignant 
gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) in adults after failure of imatinib treatment due to resistance or 
intolerance. 
Sunitinib Accord is indicated for the treatment of advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (MRCC) in 
adults. 
Sunitinib Accord is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNET) with disease progression in adults.

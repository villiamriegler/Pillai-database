the echinocandins and Candida and to provide guidance to 
clinicians. EUCAST breakpoints have not yet been 
established for caspofungin, due to significant inter 
laboratory variation in MIC ranges for caspofungin. In lieu 
of breakpoints, Candida isolates that are susceptible to 
anidulafungin as well as micafungin should be considered 
susceptible to caspofungin. Similarly, C. parapsilosis 
isolates intermediate to anidulafungin and micafungin can 
be regarded intermediate to caspofungin.

caring for patients who may experience a hypersensitivity

4.4 of the Cancidas SmPC should be updated to include a 
warning. During the assessment of the procedure, a fatal 
case of complete heart block after caspofungin treatment 
was reviewed. It has been reported in a neutropenic patient 
with aspergillosis. The report is confounded by the prior use 
of daunorubin and cytarabine. The possibility remains that 
the complete atrioventricular block may have been caused 
by systemic aspergillosis, although pericardial and 
myocardial aspergillosis are rare manifestations of systemic 
aspergillosis which can result in arrhythmias and death. 
Another explanation could be that histamine released by

reports of atrioventricular block were found in the safety 
database, however they occurred several days to weeks 
after caspofungin treatment initiation and were confounded 
by concomitant medication or concurrent conditions. 
Following the review of these atrioventricular cases, the 
CHMP agrees with the MAH that currently no changes to 
the safety data are warranted and the benefit-risk of 
Cancidas is unchanged. However the CHMP considered that 
the MAH should monitor this adverse event and provide the 
relevant safety data within the next PSUR.

Based on the CHMP review of the available information and

on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance,

the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of Cancidas continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that the 
benefit risk profile of Cancidas continues to be favourable.  
Considering the safety profile of Cancidas, the CHMP agrees 
that that the Cancidas should continue to be closely 
monitored. The remaining safety concerns for Cancidas are 
in particular hepatitis and pancreatitis. Consequently, the 
MAH should continue to provide PSURs to the CHMP every 
2 years, unless otherwise specified. The CHMP is of the 
opinion that the renewal can be granted with unlimited

The objective of this variation was to reflect mainly the 
safety but also the pharmacokinetic and efficacy experience 
of a higher dosage of caspofungin at three times the 
authorised daily maintenance dose (i.e. 150 mg daily) 
tested in patients with invasive candidiasis. Although the 
submitted data had some limitations and they do not fully 
permit to recommend the use of this high dose of 
caspofungin in specific patient populations, it is considered 
that there may be patients who might benefit from this 
increased dosage. The relevant sections of the SPC have 
been updated to reflect the data.

On the basis of the data submitted, the risk/benefit balance 
in the treatment of invasive candidiasis in adult patients or

refractory to or intolerant of amphotericin B, lipid 
formulations of amphotericin B and/or itraconazole 
(Refractoriness is defined as progression of infection or 
failure to improve after a minimum of 7 days of prior 
therapeutic doses of effective antifungal therapy for 
Cancidas) or empirical therapy for presumed fungal 
infections (such as Candida or Aspergillus) in febrile, 
neutropaenic adult patients,  remains positive. 
This annual reassessment report provides the final safety 
data from 53 patients enrolled in a combination therapy 
study. These safety data remain limited, in particular since 
most of these patients received caspofungin together with 
voriconazole (N=30), and only very few patients received 
either an amphotericin formulation (N=16) or itraconazole

This annual reassessment report includes new safety data 
from  52 patients with invasive aspergillosis enrolled in a 
combination therapy study . These safety data present the 
first preliminary results from Cancidas given in combination 
with other antifungal agents in clinical trials. The final data,

The SPC was updated in its sections 4.4 "Special warnings 
concomitant use of caspofungin and cyclosporin A. 
II, Labelling 
and special precautions for use" and 4.5 "Interaction with 
and PL 
other medicinal products and others forms of interactions" 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
to include information on the concomitant use of 
caspofungin with cyclosporin A, following findings from 
clinical studies on healthy volunteers. The results showed 
an increase of the AUC of caspofungin by approximately 
35% when co-administered with cyclosporine A.  
Furthermore, despite the fact that no serious hepatic 
adverse events were noted in a retrospective study of 40 
patients treated during marketed use with caspofungin 
and/or cyclosporin for 1 to 290 days, close monitoring of 
liver enzymes should be considered if the two medicinal 
products are used concomitantly. 
The SPC was also updated in its section 4.8 "Undesirable 
effects" following the assessment of the PSUR covering the 
period 14.06.2003 - 13.12.2003 to replace "low platelets", 
"low potassium", and "low sodium" by "thrombocytopenia", 
Page 15/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"hypokalemia" and "hyponatremia". 
Finally, the MAH included editorial changes in the section 
6.6 "Instructions for use and handling" of the SPC to align 
Cancidas 70mg to Cancidas 50mg.

The section 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of the SPC has been 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
updated as follows: 
- removal of reference to "one case of" anaphylaxis, since 
reports of hypersensitivity exhibited features of systemic 
involvement that could be argued to be consistent with 
initial symptoms of anaphylaxis. In addition, the references 
to "dyspnoea, stridor, and worsening of rash", which 
applied to one specific patient, were deleted since in 
general, anaphylaxis may have different presentations.   
- addition of "hypercalcaemia", "hepatic dysfonction", 
"swelling" and "peripheral oedema" as post-marketing 
reactions. Together with the addition of hypercalcaemia as 
a post-marketing reaction, the MAH proposed to delete 
"high calcium" from the adverse events described in the 
SPC due to a reporting rate of 'only' 0.5%. The section 4 of 
the PL has been updated accordingly.

how to reconstitute 35mg of 70mg vials for patients with 
moderate hepatic insufficiency.

presented in the 1st PSUR covering the period from

Caspofungin MSD has not been changed and remains 
favourable.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Migraines are headaches that can involve significant pain and may be preceded by sensory warning 
symptoms or signs (auras).  Migraine is seen as a spectrum disorder, although it has been arbitrarily 
classified as either episodic migraine (EM), characterized by fewer than 15 headache days per month, or 
chronic migraine (CM), characterized by 15 or more headache days per month with at least 8 days being 
migraine days (International Classification of Headache Disorders [ICHD 3], 2013; Katsarava et al, 2012; 
Aurora, 2009).  Approximately 2.5% of individuals with EM progress to CM over the course of a year (Bigal 
and Lipton, 2008; Bigal et al, 2008), and CM often remits to EM (2-year transition rate of 26%) (Manack et 
al, 2011). 
Although EM and CM have been somewhat arbitrarily distinguished based on headache frequency (Katsarava 
et al, 2012), as noted above, the clinical symptomatologies are very similar and support the notion of 
migraine as a spectrum disorder.  Common clinical features include headache pain characteristics (eg, 
unilateral, throbbing, moderate to severe, exacerbation by physical activity) and associated symptoms (eg, 
nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia).  Not only are clinical symptomologies and functional 
impairments very similar, but functional imaging results demonstrate that similar areas of the brain are 
involved in EM and CM. Thus, the collective evidence suggests that EM and CM have a common underlying 
pathophysiology (Aurora and Wilkinson, 2007; Afridi et al, 2005; Aurora et al, 2005; Welch et al, 2001). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Migraine is a highly prevalent disease with approximately 15% of the European and Canadian populations 
and 12% of the United States (US) population suffering from migraine attacks (Lipton et al, 2007; Stovner 
and Andree, 2010).  The significant pain and other symptoms associated with migraine (nausea, vomiting, 
light and/or sound sensitivity) can substantially impair a patient’s ability to function physically, at work or 
school, and socially (Steiner et al, 2014; Steiner et al, 2013; Abu Bakar 2016).  
Demographic and comorbidity data showed that CM patients are more likely than EM patients to be 
overweight, unemployed and more depressed and anxious (Blumenfield et al 2010).  Migraines have also 
been found to be associated with a number of psychiatric and medical comorbidities such as depression and 
vascular disorders (Buse et al, 2010; Bigal et al, 2009).  Migraine has been described by the World Health 
Organization as the seventh leading cause of years lived with disability among all diseases (Global Burden of 
Disease 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2016).  Given its high prevalence, 
migraine is associated with a significant socio-economic burden, affects work participation (with reduced 
productivity while at work and absenteeism) and is associated with significant annual per patient indirect 
costs in Europe and the US (Linde et al, 2012; Munakata et al, 2009).

2.1.3.   Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CGRP seems involved in the pathophysiology of neurovascular headaches such as migraine at both central 
and peripheral levels. CGRP, in fact, is highly expressed in trigeminal neurons (especially in unmyelinated C 
and small myelinated Ad fibers) where is often co-localized with other neuropeptides (e.g., substance P). 
CGRP-positive trigeminal nociceptive fibers form a rich plexus on intracranial blood vessels. When released 
peripherally from activated trigeminal nociceptive endings, CGRP induces edema, increases blood flow, and 
recruits inflammatory cells, promoting neurogenic inflammation and leading to migraine pain. At synapses in 
the trigemino-cervical complex, CGRP transmits nociceptive inputs centrally, via the brainstem, to thalamus 
and somatosensory cortex, generating hyperalgesia. During migraine, CGRP could sensitize neuronal circuits 
decreasing the filtering of sensory inputs, leading not only to pain but also to allodynia, nausea, photophobia, 
and phonophobia (Barbanti et al., Neurol Sci 2017 May;38(Suppl 1):31-35).  
CGRP levels are markedly increased into external jugular venous blood ipsilateral to pain during the headache 
phase of migraine with or without aura. Serum and saliva CGRP levels are elevated during spontaneous 
migraine attacks and also interictally in patients with chronic migraine (CM). IV administration of human 
aCGRP (2 µg/ml for 20 min) induces migraine-like disorders and migraine without aura headache in 
migraineurs without aura, and triggers experimentally induced migraine attack in 57% of patients and typical 
aura symptoms in 28% in migraineurs with aura (Barbanti et al., Neurol Sci 2017 May;38(Suppl 1):31-35).   
CGRP mAbs are believed to target smooth muscle cells on blood vessels and neurons and glial cells located 
outside the blood–brain barrier, probably in the trigeminal ganglion and brainstem paraventicular structures 
(Barbanti et al., Neurol Sci 2017 May;38(Suppl 1):31-35). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Migraine is a complex disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of headache, most often unilateral and in 
some cases associated with visual or sensory symptoms—collectively known as an aura—that arise most 
often before the head pain but that may occur during or afterward. Migraine is most common in women and 
has a strong genetic component. Approximately 70% of migraine patients have a first-degree relative with a 
history of migraine. The risk of migraine is increased 4-fold in relatives of people who have migraine with 
aura. 
The diagnosis of migraine is based on patient history. International Headache Society diagnostic criteria are 
that patients must have had at least 5 headache attacks that lasted 4-72 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully 
treated) and that the headache must have had at least 2 of the following characteristics: 
•  Unilateral location  
•  Pulsating quality  
•  Moderate or severe pain intensity  
•  Aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (eg, walking or climbing stairs)  
In addition, during the headache the patient must have had at least 1 of the following: 
•  Nausea and/or vomiting  
•  Photophobia and phonophobia  
Finally, these features must not have been attributable to another disorder. 
Assessment report

Page 11/104 
  
  
Migraine is a chronic condition, but prolonged remissions are common. One study showed that among 
persons who had migraine during childhood, 62% were migraine free for more than 2 years during puberty 
and as young adults but that only 40% were still migraine free at age 30 years.   
The severity and frequency of migraine attacks tend to diminish with increasing age. After 15 years of 
suffering migraines, approximately 30% of men and 40% of women no longer have migraine attacks. 
Migraine and vascular disorders 
Migraine and ischemic strokes reportedly occur in 1.4-3.3 per 100,000 population and account for 0.8% of 
total strokes. Milhaud et al showed that in young patients (< 45 y) with active migraine who had suffered 
ischemic stroke, risk factors such as patent foramen ovale, female gender, and oral contraceptive use were 
much more likely to be present; posterior circulation stroke was characteristic. Surprisingly, older patients 
characteristically lacked vascular risk factors (ie, previous hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cigarette 
smoking).  Even in patients older than 45 years, women with migraine are more likely to suffer from ischemic 
stroke. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Across the spectrum, migraine is treated with agent(s) for the acute headache attacks, typically involving 
non-specific (symptomatic) agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) or migraine-
specific abortive medications such as triptans or, more rarely, ergotamine derivatives. In general, 
pharmacological prophylaxis should be part of a multi-modal treatment paradigm, also incorporating non-
pharmacological aspects such as nutrition, exercise, psychological interventions or other aspects that have 
been shown to be beneficial to migraine patients. While a lot of patients can be sufficiently managed with 
non-pharmacological interventions, many patients require prophylaxis due to the high severity of disease 
characterized by frequent attacks and/or severe functional impact. The main goal of a prophylactic treatment 
is to reduce the frequency of migraine days (Evers et al 2009; Silberstein et al 2012). 
The standard of care in migraine prophylaxis is quite heterogeneous across European countries, which is 
reflected in a large variety of recommendations in national treatment guidelines. Approved treatments in the 
European Union (EU) that are commonly available include propranolol, metoprolol, topiramate, and 
amitriptyline, which recently underwent a procedure to harmonize the prescribing information across the EU 
(Article 30 referral procedure). In addition to those, several countries have additional local therapies 
approved such as flunarizine, pizotifen or others.  Other compounds have shown some degree of efficacy in 
the prophylaxis of migraine but are not approved for this use in most European countries. Examples of such 
treatments include venlafaxine (antidepressants), lisinopril (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor), and 
candesartan (angiotensin-receptor blocker). 
Existing treatments are frequently associated with variable efficacy and poor safety and tolerability, leading 
to low persistence and adherence rates, both in clinical studies as well as in routine clinical use (Hepp et al, 
2015; Hepp et al, 2014). Further, there is a lack of robust clinical trial data for many existing therapies, as 
much of the available evidence is based on studies conducted decades ago that would not meet current 
regulatory and clinical trial quality standards. Many of the existing treatments, including approved therapies, 
were not originally developed for migraine prophylaxis and do not target the underlying pathophysiology of 
the migraine disorder. Moreover, few products approved or recommended for migraine prophylaxis have 
demonstrated efficacy across the full spectrum of migraine encompassing both CM and EM. Poor tolerability 
and adverse events (AEs) necessitating discontinuation of treatment further limit therapeutic options for

migraineurs. Topiramate is associated with paraesthesia and cognitive dysfunction, while dizziness, 
depression and weight gain are known to occur with propranolol/metoprolol (Bussone et al 2005; Adelman et 
al 2008; Vecsei et al 2015). Poor tolerability often leads to low treatment retention rates, both in clinical 
trials and in routine clinical practice with all of the available drug classes (Hepp et al 2014, Hepp et al 2015; 
Hepp et al 2016). The discontinuation rate due to AEs across phase 3 clinical trials for topiramate, as an 
example, was 25% for the approved dose of 100 mg (Adelman et al 2008), indicating that many patients do 
not benefit from treatment over the long term if they are unable to remain on the regimen due to 
intolerability issues.  This has also been shown in real-world data recently, with persistence to an initiated 
oral prophylactic medication (antidepressants, anticonvulsants, betablockers) being limited with 
approximately 25% still on drug after 6 months and only 14% remaining on the initial drug at 12 months 
(Hepp et al 2016).  
In addition, onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) is currently only approved for patients with CM in some European 
countries.  Each treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA requires 31 injections in the head and neck muscles.  
Frequently occurring AEs include neck pain, headache, worsening migraine, muscular weakness and eyelid 
ptosis (BOTOX package insert, 2016).  
As a result, many migraine patients switch between therapies and discontinuation rates further increase as 
patients cycle through multiple therapies with adherence rates being as low as 20% at one year (Hepp et al 
2016). Hence, there is unmet medical need for new prophylactic agents that are efficacious, safe, and well 
tolerated in order to improve long-term outcomes for the respective patients. 
About the product 
AMG 334 (erenumab) is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 that is directed against the calcitonin 
gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor complex and inhibits the action of CGRP.  AMG 334 is being developed 
for prophylaxis of migraine in adults. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the following: The applicant’s view that 
this new substance constitutes a major interest from the point of view of public health was not fully 
supported. The efficacy of erenumab seemed to be in line with that of Botox and topiramate, even though it 
was recognised that the tolerability of erenumab seemed favourable in comparison with many other migraine 
prophylactic drugs currently used. Thus, it was not agreed that the criteria for granting accelerated 
assessment were met.

Aimovig is available in packs containing one PFS, one PFP and in a multipack containing 3 (3x1) PFP. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
AMG 334 is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) antibody subclass produced using recombinant 
DNA  technology  in  a  Chinese  hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cell  line.  AMG  334  specifically  binds  to  the  extracellular 
domain  of  the  calcitonin  gene-related  peptide  receptor  (CGRP-R)  and  prevents  its  interaction  with  the 
neuropeptide  CGRP.  CGRP  has  been  shown  to  be  implicated  in  migraines  and  its  levels  are  elevated  in  the 
blood during a migraine attack. 
AMG 334 consists of 2 heavy chains (HC) and 2 light chains (LC) of the human lambda subclass, and have 36 
cysteine  residues  involved  in  both  intra-chain  and  inter-chain  disulfide  bonds.  Alternate  disulfide  linkages 
(IgG2-A/B  and  IgG2-B)  between  the  Fab  and  hinge  regions  exist,  as  with  all  IgG2  antibodies  studied.  Each 
heavy  chain  contains  an  N-linked  glycan  at  a  consensus  glycosylation  site  on  asparagine  306  As  is  typical 
with mammalian cell culture processes, C-terminal lysine 456 on the heavy chain is mostly removed due to 
the presence of carboxypeptidases during upstream production. 
The  theoretical  amino  acid  sequences  of  the  heavy  and  light  chains,  based  on  the  DNA  sequences,  are 
presented. The complete amino acid sequence of AMG 334 was verified.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturers 
The active substance is manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs). The 
facilities involved in the manufacture and testing of AMG 334 active substance, including contract laboratories 
were provided. 
The review found that all relevant active substance sites have valid manufacturing authorisations or valid 
GMP certificates as appropriate.  
No further issues that would trigger a GMP inspection have been identified during the assessment of the 
information in the Module 3 of the dossier. 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The cell culture process begins with thawing a working cell bank (WCB) vial. One single cell culture 
production bioreactor is harvested and purified to comprise a single batch of active substance. It is stated 
that the operational controls implemented at the cell culture steps maintain the number of population 
doublings within the established limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 14/104 
  
  
Raw materials, media compositions, process solutions and product contact materials used in cell culture and 
harvest are described in 3.2.S.2.3 (Raw materials). 
The production bioreactor is a single-use . The harvested cell culture filtrate is concentrated by and the 
harvested cell culture fluid (HCCF) is held at 2°C to 8°C within a defined hold time prior to further processing.  
AMG334 is purified with a series of chromatography, viral inactivation and filtration and ultra/diafiltration 
steps.. 
The final active substance manufacturing steps are polysorbate 80 addition, sterile filtration into containers, 
and storage. 
The description of the active substance manufacturing process, process controls, and raw materials is 
acceptable.  
It is noted that the definition of process parameter acceptable ranges enables variation in more than one 
parameter at the same time (in a given unit operation). This is discussed further in the section for 
manufacturing process development. 
Process parameter acceptable ranges and in-process control (IPC) limits for the active substance 
manufacturing process are based on conclusions from the process characterisation (and, where applicable, 
safety regulations). This is endorsed.  
Active substance transportation is sufficiently described.  
Reprocessing is not currently proposed during manufacturing of AMG 334 active substance. 
Cell substrate, genetic stability, cell banks 
In summary, to generate the production cell line, the deduced HC and LC DNA sequences were cloned and 
used to construct the AMG 334 HC and LC expression plasmids in a stepwise manner. The HC and LC 
expression plasmids were co-transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Following a clone screening 
and selection process, final clone AMG 334 -clone was selected as the AMG 334 production cell line. The host 
cell history is sufficiently described. 
The overall approach for testing of the genetic stability is approvable.  
A two-tier cell banking system of master cell bank (MCB) and WCB is used for production of AMG334. They 
are manufactured in compliance with cGMP, tested and characterised according to ICH Q5D. Cell bank test 
method descriptions are sufficient.  
Descriptions of the adventitious agents test methods and results are provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The control strategy for the active substance process includes direct control of process inputs and evaluation 
of the process performance. A performance indicator is a measurement (output) which is used to evaluate in-
process performance. Performance indicators allow direct assessment of product quality (e.g. impurity levels) 
and/or process consistency (e.g. step yield). Performance indicators are evaluated against predetermined 
limits during process validation and a subset of performance indicators are designated as IPCs for routine 
manufacture. IPCs which should be controlled within a defined range to ensure final product quality are 
designated as critical. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 15/104 
  
  
Limits for IPCs are categorised as rejection, action, or control limits. Rejection limits are established to assure 
no adverse impact to patient safety. A rejection limit, if exceeded or, in some cases, equalled, results in 
batch rejection if reprocessing is not permitted. 
Table 1. Parameters and limit definitions 
Justifications for selection of product quality IPCs and limits are presented in 3.2.S.2.6 (Process 
Characterisation – Cell Culture and Harvest / Purification).  
Test methods for IPC testing are sufficiently described.. The overall scientific approach and anonymised data 
was presented in response to a question. The approach regarding the PK modelling and the conclusion are 
supported.  
Process validation 
The AMG 334 active substance process validation life cycle strategy is designed to demonstrate that the 
manufacturing process is controlled and reproducible, consistently yielding active substance with the 
expected product quality attributes. 
The minimum number of full scale lots required for validation was determined. This was based on a high level 
of confidence in the process robustness and consistency in the commercial facility. An additional lot that was 
part of the same manufacturing campaign was manufactured to provide further evidence of process 
consistency. Active substance process validation studies include: cell culture and harvest, purification, in-
process pool hold, chromatography resin cleaning and reuse, membrane cleaning and reuse. Active substance 
fill uniformity was also tested. Shipping containers for frozen active substance were qualified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 16/104 
  
  
 
AMG 334 process validation is appropriately described and the manufacturing process for active substance 
can be considered validated. No concerns are raised as regards the transport qualification of AMG 334 active 
substance. 
Validation batch data (process parameters and performance indicators) are generally well aligned within 
rather narrow intervals, well above/below/within the quite wide acceptance criteria. A few deviations occurred 
during active substance process validation – these were acceptably investigated and handled.  
Protocols for further validation of chromatography resin reuse are provided, including studies of potential 
leachables for the chromatography at the end of the resin lifetime. This is endorsed. 
The described approach for ongoing process verification and trending of process data is also supported.  
Manufacturing process development  
Three versions of the active substance manufacturing process have been used during the clinical 
development: Process 1, Process 2 (Clinical) and Process 2 (Commercial).  
Analytical comparability between Process 1 and Process 2 (Clinical) active substance is considered to be 
demonstrated. No concerns are raised. 
Active substance from Process 2 (Clinical) and Process 2 (Commercial) manufacturing methods was 
compared as regards lot release analyses, further characterisation and stability during forced degradation. 
Minor differences were detected but reasonably explained except for the argument that analytical method 
variation was used to include data into historical intervals – as stated elsewhere in the Assessment report, 
method variability is already included in the batch data.  
Based on the totality of data, the comparability exercise is approvable.  
The evaluation and conclusion regarding the comparability between Process 2 (Clinical) and Process 2 
(Commercial) is endorsed. 
The process characterisation approach was based on an evaluation of existing knowledge from a variety of 
sources, AMG 334 commercial process development studies and manufacturing experience, and the results of 
process risk assessments. This information supported the design of process characterisation studies which 
addressed potential knowledge gaps, evaluated process robustness, and increased process understanding 
over a range of operating conditions.  
Process parameter and performance indicator definitions and their ranges and/or limits are provided below. 
Table 2. Definition of process parameters and ranges 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 17/104 
  
  
Process characterisation was conducted by executing a series of studies comprising multivariate optimal 
design of experiments (DoE), single variable experiments (univariate), and process challenge experiments. In 
these experiments, selected process parameters were intentionally varied and the results were analysed with 
appropriate statistical analysis tools to determine the effect on relevant product quality and performance 
indicators. 
Based on the knowledge derived from process characterisation and prior knowledge, acceptable ranges for 
the process parameters were established. When operated within the process parameter acceptable ranges, 
the process delivers acceptable quality and process performance. Approaches for establishing IPC limits are 
presented.  
The integrated control strategy incorporates a number of control elements including process parameters, in-
process controls (IPCs), release specifications, and periodic testing controls (e.g. validation, comparability, 
stability) of the active substance and finished product. The integrated control strategy reflects knowledge of 
product quality attributes (PQAs) and their potential to impact patient safety and product efficacy, as well as 
an understanding of the means by which these attributes are controlled during manufacturing and through 
shelf-life. 
Attributes that may have a severe, major or moderate impact on the safety or efficacy profile of AMG 334 
were identified as CQAs in alignment with ICH Q8 (R2). AMG 334 CQAs are summarised in the dossier. AMG 
334 quality attributes are controlled using a diverse set of control elements.  
The strategy to use multivariate understanding to increase process knowledge and establish ranges for 
process parameters is supported.  
The proposed manufacturing description with the identified acceptable ranges and the definition of acceptable 
ranges are acceptable as it has been assured that any negative effects due to potential interactions between 
process parameters will be detected by the proposed control strategy. Attributes impacted by two-factor 
interactions are controlled as CQAs. The dossier is updated with information regarding identified interactions 
and the DoE models’ goodness-of-prediction. This is acceptable.  
An extensive process characterisation was performed utilising small scale multivariate and univariate 
experiments evaluated by statistical models to identify and classify process parameter effects on product 
quality attributes. Specifically, the calculation of an impact ratio was used to assign process parameter 
criticality. This approach, and the outcome, is acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 18/104 
  
  
 
Small-scale model qualification is approvable. Minor offsets are sufficiently justified. 
The proposed IPCs, as based on process characterisation, process validation and experience from commercial 
scale runs are approvable.  
This is acceptable.  
Buffer parameter acceptable ranges were defined based on process characterisation. The parameters are 
verified to meet acceptance criteria prior to use in the process. This is acceptable. 
In-process hold pools characterisation and chromatography resin and filter reuse are sufficiently described.  
The AMG 334 manufacturing process includes single-use equipment for cell culture, mixing and purification 
pools. The information as regards the extensive single-use material characterisation and qualification is 
sufficient, no concerns are raised. 
No design space is claimed for the active substance manufacturing process. 
Characterisation 
Biochemical, biophysical, and biological characterisation of AMG 334 was conducted to provide a 
comprehensive understanding of the structural and functional properties and to enable an assessment of the 
criticality of product quality attributes (PQAs). Forced degradation studies were performed to reveal potential 
degradation pathways. All methods are qualified as fit for purpose. All elucidation of structure studies were 
conducted using materials manufactured using Process 2 (Clinical) or Process 2 (Commercial) and included 
both active substance and finished product. 
AMG 334 is a human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) subclass produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The intact molecule consists of two heavy chains (HC) and two light chains (LC) 
of the lambda subclass. AMG 334 contains a total of 36 cysteine residues involved in both intrachain and 
interchain disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain contains an N-linked glycan at a consensus glycosylation site on 
asparagine 306. As is typical with mammalian cell culture processes, the heavy chain C-terminal lysine 456 is 
mostly removed due to the presence of carboxypeptidases during upstream production. 
The active substance manufacturing process has been assessed for its potential to introduce process-related 
impurities. Impurities derived from the host cell and “potentially safety concern” (PSC) reagents were 
analysed for their clearance through the purification process.  
in the active substance process was evaluated for the Process 2 (Commercial) lots. Reduction of these 
impurities to predefined acceptance criteria was demonstrated during challenge studies performed at small-
scale during process characterisation (S.2.6, Process Characterisation - Purification) and confirmed at 
commercial scale during process validation. 
An extensive product characterisation is presented and endorsed. The conclusions regarding primary, 
secondary and tertiary structures are supported.  
Site and occupancy for the N-glycosylation was determined. No O-linked or non-human moieties were 
detected. 
It is agreed that the described potency assay is a good representation of the AMG 334 mechanism of action. 
There was no evidence of ADCC or CDC. These conclusions are supported. 
No concerns are raised regarding conclusions on forced degradation studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 19/104 
  
  
The conclusion that product-related impurities are well-controlled by the manufacturing process, 
recommended storage conditions, and associated analytical monitoring is supported. 
Reduction of residual amounts of process-related impurities was demonstrated in small scale challenge 
experiments and commercial scale process validation lots. The approach and the conclusions are supported. 
The evaluation and conclusions for process reagents considered to have “potential safety concerns” are 
scientifically sound and acceptable. 
Specification 
The proposed active substance specification covers identity, purity and impurities, potency and other general 
tests. The development of the AMG 334 active substance specification was performed in accordance with ICH 
Q6B (Specifications: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Biotechnological/Biological Products) and 
ICH Q8 (Pharmaceutical Development).  
In the original application, analytical method variations were used to expand intervals by addition/subtraction 
of the method intermediate precision. This was not supported as analytical variability is already included in 
the batch data. The Applicant agreed to remove this from the dossier. This is endorsed. 
A tightening of the specifications limits was requested and undertaken by the Applicant, during the review.  
The justifications for omitting analyses for certain process-related impurities from routine testing and 
specifications are acceptable.. This is also found acceptable.  
The proposed limits for protein concentration (±10% of the average historical data) and bacterial endotoxins 
are acceptable.  
The proposed active substance specification is acceptable.  
Analytical methods 
The descriptions of the methods used in the release and stability testing of active substance are acceptable.   
The non-compendial methods used in the release of active substance have been satisfactorily validated in 
accordance with recommendations as per ICH Q2 and is therefore deemed acceptable. 
Batch analyses 
Batch analyses data for all AMG 334 Process 1 and Process 2 active substance lots used during clinical 
development and for product manufactured at the commercial manufacturing facility were provided. All data 
complies with the active substance specifications. The information is sufficient and acceptable. 
The analytical procedures used during development are well described and justifications for why they are no 
longer on the commercial specification list are given. The descriptions and the justifications are found 
acceptable. 
Reference standard 
To date, two AMG 334 reference standards, one interim and one primary, have been produced. Data from 
characterisation and stability studies of the current reference standards is presented. This is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 20/104 
  
  
Release testing of future reference standards is described in the dossier. The testing will be performed per 
the approved finished product specification, with some acceptable exceptions. Additional characterisation 
tests are also defined. The approach is acceptable. 
Stability 
The stability studies were performed per the ICH Q5C and Q1A. Stability studies are conducted at the 
recommended storage condition of -30°C±10 °C and at elevated temperatures in order to assess the effect of 
these conditions on product quality. Accelerated (-20°C±10°C and 5°C±3°C) and stressed (25°C±10°C) 
conditions are performed to compare relative rates of degradation, assess the effect of temperature stress on 
the product, and support potential temperature deviations. Stability containers are smaller than, but 
otherwise identical to, the container closure system used in manufacturing. 
No statistically significant or meaningful changes are observed acceptance criteria included in the post-
approval stability program ensure that the quality of AMG 334 is appropriately measured and controlled 
throughout the shelf life.  
The subjects covered by the description of the stability studies, stability data and post-approval stability 
protocol are appropriate, for main parts in compliance with ICH guidelines and the chosen analytical methods 
appear adequately stability indicating.  This claim is supported by sufficient real time /real condition data 
from three primary batches (Process 2 Clinical) The Applicant commits to continue the ongoing stability 
studies until completion. This is endorsed. 
A reduced post-approval stability protocol is submitted, based on current and historical data demonstrating 
that a number of the tests are not stability indicating as regards material from the clinical and commercial 
processes (Process 2). The proposal is acceptable as part of the ongoing stability program conducted under 
GMP. It should be noted that for future post-approval process changes, the proposed reduced post-approval 
protocol is expected to be extended depending on the nature of the change.  
Any out-of-specification results or significant deviation trends will be communicated to regulatory authorities 
promptly. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Description and composition of the finished product 
The finished product is supplied as a sterile, single-use, preservative-free solution for SC injection in either a 
PFS or a prefilled AI/Pen. The AI/Pen is a disposable, handheld, mechanical (spring-based) delivery device 
that is provided ready-to-use, pre-assembled with the PFS. The primary container closure system for the PFS 
and AI/Pen is the same, except the PFS uses a regular wall (RW) needle and the AI/Pen uses a special thin 
wall (STW) needle. 
The qualitative composition of the finished product is provided in Table 4 below.

Pharmaceutical development 
Overall, the description of pharmaceutical development is sufficiently comprehensive and justifies the 
development of formulation composition, manufacturing process and container closure system. 
The finished product formulation is 70 mg/mL AMG 334 formulated in acetate, sucrose, polysorbate 80, 
pH 5.2. This formulation is intended to provide a sterile, preservative-free, dose of finished product for SC 
injection. 
The selected formulation composition provides the intended physiological tonicity, maintains pH, and 
minimizes aggregates. Acetate was selected for its buffering capacity at the selected pH. Sucrose was added 
to ensure physiological tonicity. Polysorbate 80 was added to minimize formation of soluble and insoluble 
aggregates. 
In line with the recommendations of ICH Q3D, a risk-based approach has been applied to assess the potential 
presence of elemental impurities in the finished product. 
Manufacturing process development 
Initially, finished product was produced by filling Process 1 clinical active substance The initial primary 
container was a Type 1 glass vial, which was used in toxicology studies and clinical studies. Later, finished 
product clinical production was transitioned to filling Process 2 (Clinical) active substance. The primary 
container changed to a Type 1 glass PFS. The transition from Process 1 to Process 2 (Clinical) also included 
an increase in the active substance protein concentration, a change in the finished product storage 
conditions, as well as a change in the active substance formulation.  
For commercial production, the manufacturing process . Minor changes were incorporated to accommodate 
facility fit and scale differences when the process was transferred from the clinical to commercial 
manufacturing site. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 22/104 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Comparability was performed in accordance with ICH Q5E and has been sufficiently demonstrated for finished 
product used throughout development to commercial scale manufacturing. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system consists of a 1 mL Type I glass syringe with a staked 27 gauge stainless steel 
needle regular wall (RW) with rigid needle shield (RNS) or special thin wall (STW) with non-rigid needle shield 
(nRNS), an elastomeric needle shield, and a fluoropolymer laminated plunger-stopper. The RW needle 
syringe is used for the stand-alone PFS configuration, while the STW needle syringe is used with the prefilled 
SureClick auto-injector (AI/Pen) configuration. Safety of the container closure system components is assured 
by compliance with appropriate USP, Ph. Eur., and JP monographs and ISO standards for primary containers 
and closures. Documentation supporting that the essential requirements of the Medical device directive 
(MDD, 93/42/EEC) for safety and performance-related device features are provided in the dossier. The 
container closure system is safe and suitable for use and the development has been sufficiently described. 
Product samples of the pre-filled syringe and the auto-injector/pen have been provided to assess the 
suitability for use. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process 
A full listing of the sites for the manufacture, testing of finished product, and assembly of the PFS and 
AI/Pen, has been provided. 
The  AMG  334  finished  product  manufacturing  process  for  70  mg/mL  PFS  includes  formulation  buffer 
preparation,  active  substance  thaw,  finished  product  formulation,  bioburden  reduction  filtration,  filtered 
formulated  finished  product  hold,  sterile  filtration  and  aseptic  filling,  syringe  plunger-stopper  placement, 
inspection, and storage. Acceptable ranges, where appropriate, are provided for process parameters.  
The description of manufacturing process and process controls and control of critical steps and intermediates 
of the finished product is sufficiently described. As requested, some further additional details have been 
added in the description of the manufacturing process of finished product. 
Controls of critical steps and intermediates 
Performance indicators allow direct assessment of product quality and/or process consistency.  Performance 
indicators are evaluated against predetermined limits during process validation and a subset of performance 
indicators are designated as in-process control (IPC) parameters for routine manufacture. IPCs which should 
be controlled within a defined range to ensure final product quality are designated as critical. In addition to 
IPCs, some in-process tests may be designated as real time release testing (RTRT). IPCs are part of the 
comprehensive integrated control strategy.  
For each critical IPC (bioburden, filter integrity testing), the corrective actions taken by the Applicant were 
adequately described.  
Process validation 
The finished product process validation lifecycle strategy is designed to demonstrate that the manufacturing 
process is controlled, reproducible, and consistently yields finished product with the required product quality. 
The PFS used in the prefilled AI/Pen device uses an nRNS in the primary container. Both RNS and nRNS 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 23/104 
  
  
primary containers are the same, with the only difference being the inner diameter of the staked needle. 
Process validation included the filling of both the RNS and nRNS, hence both presentations have been 
validated. 
Process validation information presented includes: 
  Summary of the approach to the establishment of the process validation strategy; 
  Summary  of  the  validation  of  the  finished  product  manufacturing  process  including  a  description  of 
each processing step and the acceptance criteria; 
  Outline of ongoing process verification monitoring programs within the Quality Management System 
that collects, analyses and responds to trends in product and process data related to product quality; 
  Summary of the validation of the filter used for the sterile filtration finished product manufacturing 
steps; 
  Summary of the validation of the media fill and sterilisation results; 
  Qualification of the transportation of the PFS and AI/Pen. 
The validation data presented demonstrate that the process is robust and performs as intended, giving a 
finished product which meets the quality requirements when conducted within the defined operating ranges. 
Three commercial-scale consecutive finished product lots were manufactured to validate the formulation and 
syringe filling process which covered the intended commercial batch size range. The validation was run at set 
points while the ranges of process parameters were challenged during the manufacturing process 
development. This is found acceptable.  
The sterility assurance of the filling process was evaluated and assured through the aseptic process 
simulation validation (media fill) and sterilization validation programs. Media fill validation was successfully 
performed and completed at AML to support the finished product aseptic process conditions for AMG 334. 
Results and requirements for the media fill validation are in line with the current EU requirements. This is 
found acceptable. 
Product specification 
The specifications and test methods used to assure the quality of the finished product at release cover control 
identity, purity and impurities, potency and other general tests. The additional test methods and acceptance 
criteria used to assure the functionality of the AI/Pen at release are provided. 
Relevant tests are included in the specifications for the finished product. As requested, test method number 
has been given to all analytical procedures used in the specifications for release and end-of shelf-life in the 
finished product specifications document. 
Some parameters are tested as real time release testing (RTRT) controls at the process step of syringe filling. 
Many tests used for release testing and stability testing of finished product are also used for release testing 
and stability testing of the active substance. These methods and validation results cover both the active 
substance and finished product. The analytical procedures were validated in accordance with ICH Q2 and the 
compendial methods have been verified according to the appropriate compendia chapters and determined to 
be suitable for use.

The Applicant proposed to maintain the erenumab active substance and finished product purity specifications 
as submitted in the original marketing application. The Applicant concludes that the proposed purity 
specifications at end of shelf life (EOSL) are supported by the clinical experience and also that changes of the 
purity attributes within the proposed ranges do not impact potency. The arguments presented in this updated 
justification for the proposed purity specifications for finished product of Aimovig is found acceptable and 
agreed to. In addition, the Applicant has also updated the dossier and included all accepted aspects of the 
justification of specifications.  
Furthermore, the Applicant has also presented additional results by sedimentation velocity analytical 
ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) for Aimovig and it is acknowledged that this product consists primarily of dimer 
with low levels of higher-order oligomeric species and that dimers are considered less immunogenic than 
higher-order oligomeric species.  
Batch analyses 
Batch analyses data from AMG334 finished product lots manufactured during development through scale-up 
and  transfer  to  the  commercial  manufacturing  sites  have  been  provided.  Each  lot  was  tested  to  the 
specification in place at the time of manufacture. 
Stability of the product 
Based on stability data collected to date, an expiry period of 24 months is proposed for AMG 334 finished 
product stored at the recommended storage temperature of 2°C to 8°C (referred to as 5°C). Additionally, to 
enhance convenience and facilitate dosing, storage for 14 days at up to 25°C is proposed.  
The ongoing stability program for the PFS finished product includes includes 24 to 36 months for 4 primary 
lots, and 18 months data for 3 production lots. The primary lots are representative of lots produced at the 
commercial manufacturing scale as demonstrated through the analytical comparability analysis presented in 
section P.2.3. To support the proposed storage for 14 days at room temperature (at up to 25°C), stability 
testing has been performed at 25°C after storage at the recommended storage condition for 24 months. 
Storage at room temperature (up to 25°C) should not exceed 14 days. 
Results have also been presented demonstrating that the secondary packaging effectively protects the 
finished product from light exposure. The PFS and PFP should be kept in the outer carton in order to protect 
from light. 
The proposed shelf-life for the AI/pen of 24 months at 5 °C and 14 days at up to 25°C is mainly based on the 
PFS stability data. The stability results for the AI/pen at the recommended (5 °C), accelerated and stressed 
conditions are consistent with the PFS. The primary container closure system is identical to that used for the 
PFS and there is no product contact with the auto-injector device. Comparability between the PFS and the 
AI/pen has been shown demonstrating that finished product quality is not impacted by the AI/pen assembly 
process and extrusion from the device. 
The Applicant commits to continue the ongoing stability studies of PFS and AI/pen until completion. In 
addition, a minimum of one lot of finished product will be added to the ongoing post-approval stability 
program annually. Any out-of-specification results or significant deviation trends will be communicated to 
regulatory authorities promptly. 
Assessment report

The proposed shelf-life for finished product of 24 months at the recommended storage temperature of 2°C to 
8°C as well as the proposed claim for a 14 days storage period at room temperature (at up to 25°C), within 
the proposed shelf-life, are found acceptable. 
Post approval change management protocol 
A post approval change management protocol (PACMP) concerning the addition of an additional 
manufacturing facility for the production of AMG 334 active substance in included in the submission. 
According to the Applicant, the transfer will not result in any changes to the overall process flow. No changes 
are proposed to production scale and only minor process changes for the production of the active substance 
to accommodate facility fit. There are no changes to the active substance specifications, in-process controls 
or test methods as a result of the product transfers. However, there is a change to the active substance 
container. 
The PACMP presents detailed description of the change (site transfer), risk assessment, development and 
characterisation studies to support site transfer, process comparability and control strategy, active substance 
analytical comparability plan, and an implementation plan and further commitments. 
The submitted PACMP for addition of the site for active substance production is considered approvable and 
will have to be implemented with a Type IB variation.  
The general approach for use of equivalence testing of pre- and post-change active substance, as described, 
is acceptable. Furthermore, it is stated that any post-change result inconsistent with historical trends will be 
assessed for impact to product quality and patient safety. This is important for all comparisons (lot release, 
characterisation data, forced degradation and real-time stability) and strongly supported.  
Tolerance intervals were used to set comparability criteria.  
Adventitious agents 
Acceptable information has been provided regarding TSE. No animal derived raw material is used in the 
manufacturing process other than the CHO-derived production cell line. No raw materials from albumin or 
other human tissue origin are used in the manufacturing process. 
The safety testing performed on the MCB, WCB and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) has been 
performed in accordance with ICH Q5A and Q5D and sufficient details have been provided. 
Several steps have been validated for virus clearance. The data provided for the virus clearance studies is 
acceptable and the data shows effective reduction of a wide range of model viruses. Satisfactory safety 
margin for retrovirus has also been demonstrated. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Manufacture, development, characterisation and control of erenumab active substance and finished product 
are, adequately described and no major objections are identified. One non-GMP compliant site introduced as 
a second site for cell bank storage had to be removed from the dossier; this was raised as an ’other concern’. 
The active substance manufacturing process is defined and controlled based on multivariate understanding 
and characterisation. There is no claim for design space, however the integrated control strategy 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 26/104 
  
  
encompasses description and control also of effects of process parameter two-factor interactions. This was 
found acceptable. The comparability exercises performed at the level of the active substance and the finished 
product were generally adequately performed. The active substance was also adequately characterised with a 
panel of state-of-the-art methods. The proposed specifications are considered acceptable. Acceptance limits 
for the purity attributes are acceptably justified with product-specific data. Appropriate product-specific 
information was provided. The proposed shelf-life for both active substance and finished product are found 
acceptable. The post-approval stability protocol is acceptable. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Aimovig is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply with 
existing guidelines. The cell cultivation and purification of the active substance are adequately described, 
controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its physicochemical and 
biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate specifications are set. The 
manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of 
the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently assured. 
The overall quality of Aimovig is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant has conducted a comprehensive battery of tests to characterise pharmacology and toxicology 
of erenumab. Pivotal safety studies were performed in compliance with GLP  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The non-clinical studies have demonstrated that AMG 334 binds to the CGRP receptor (with selectivity to 
other members of the class) and that it inhibits signalling with CGRP. AMG 334 was not active on rat, dog or 
rabbit receptor but was active at the cynomolgus receptor, with similar binding activity as with the human 
receptor. In vivo activity was demonstrated in a cynomolgus model of capsaicin induced increase in dermal 
blood flow, an effect mediated at least partly by CGRP. There are no animal migraine models. Therefore, all 
evidence for a therapeutic effect is derived from clinical data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 27/104 
  
  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In light of the widespread distribution of CGRP, and its likely pleiotropic activity, the applicant has provided a 
comprehensive discussion on the potential for secondary pharmacodynamics events which could be of 
importance for the safety assessment. The identified potential targets are: 
Cardiovascular 
CGRP is a potent vasodilator. Thus, inhibition of the CGRP receptor may pose a theoretical risk of increasing 
systemic blood pressure. Exogenous CGRP has been shown to cause vasodilation and systemic administration 
of CGRP causes hypotension in normotensive and hypertensive rats. Data from studies using CGRP-receptor 
antagonists in a number of species, including humans, cynomolgus monkeys and rats, suggest that CGRP 
does not play a role in the physiological control of systemic blood pressure in normal individuals. Nonclinical 
and clinical studies with AMG 334 did not show any evidence for blood pressure effects. 
A theoretical cardiovascular safety risk with CGRP receptor blockade is lack of compensatory vasodilation, 
particularly in the context of the coronary circulation during ischemic-related diseases/conditions. Infusion of 
CGRP at supraphysiological doses reduced myocardial infarct size in a rat ischemia model. However, a CGRP-
receptor antagonist had no effect. Peptide or small molecule CGRP antagonists had no adverse effects in dog 
and pig models of ischemia. It is believed that endogenous CGRP release is not sufficient to provide 
cardiovascular protection. 
Bone 
In rats, CGRP positive neurons are detectable in trabecular bone and differentiating osteoblasts express the 
CGRP receptor. Injection of CGRP in rats provides partial protection from gonadectomy-induced bone loss. 
In the chronic repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey, there were no effects on a number of 
biomarkers for bone formation and resorption, and no histopathological changes in the bone. In the ePPND 
study, there no skeletal bone changes in infants on radiographic examination. 
Gastric mucosa 
CGRP has been postulated to have protective effects against gastric injury. In a rat model of exogenously 
stimulated gastric acid secretion, endogenous CGRP reduced gastric acid secretion and intravenous 
administration of CGRP antagonists prevented this inhibitory effect. Low doses of peripherally administered 
CGRP were shown to ameliorate experimentally-induced gastric ulcers in rats and mice. 
There were no gastrointestinal-mediated clinical signs or lesions in AMG 334 repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkey. 
Pregnancy 
CGRP and CGRP receptors are expressed in human maternal and feto-placental tissues and circulating levels 
of CGRP are increased during pregnancy. It has been postulated that CGRP as a potent vasodilator may be 
important for the increase in uteroplacental blood flow and decrease in uterine vascular resistance during 
pregnancy. In a rat model for preeclampsia, continuous infusion of CGRP resulted in decreased blood 
pressure and improved fetal growth and survival. 
Recent evidence suggests a more prominent role of adrenomedullin over CGRP in pregnancy. 
In an enhanced pre- and postnatal developmental study in the cynomolgus monkey with AMP 334 there were 
no adverse findings.

EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 28/104 
  
  
Respiratory system 
CGRP is present in sensory nerve fibers throughout the respiratory tract and has been implicated in the 
regulation of vascular tone in the lungs. There are conflicting results on the role of CGRP in lung function. In 
the toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys there were no clinical signs of histopathological changes 
associated with respiratory distress. There were no changes in respiratory rate in the single dose telemetered 
cynomolgus monkey study. 
Immune system 
Sensory nerves containing CGRP are detected in primary and secondary lymphoid organs, where they appear 
to establish direct contacts with macrophages, tissue mast cells, and Langerhans cells. During inflammatory 
response, both local and systemic levels of CGRP rapidly increase. CGRP is a negative regulator of innate and 
adaptive immunity, limits tissue damage in inflammatory disorders, and facilitates wound healing. 
CGRP may also be produced by activated immune cells. In various in vitro and in vivo models, CGRP was 
shown to down-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, decrease antigen presentation, 
decrease NK cytolytic activity and decrease expression of the costimulatory receptor CD6 on dendritic cells 
and macrophages, and stimulate production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Functionally, CGRP may 
suppress Th1 responses and promote Th2 responses. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The effects of AMG 334 on cardiovascular endpoints, respiration rate, and neurobehavioral effects were 
assessed in a telemetered cynomolgus monkey study. There were no AMG 334-related arrhythmias or 
changes in ECG waveform.  There were no AMG 334-related changes in QRS duration or QTc interval.  In 
addition, there were no biologically-significant changes in PR interval, heart rate, or blood pressure, and no 
AMG 334-related changes in body temperature, respiration rate or neurological assessments. Exposure to 
AMG 334 was >30-fold the clinical Cmax. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific nonclinical drug interaction studies were conducted as no drug-drug interactions were expected 
based on the mechanism of AMG 334. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of AMG 334 after intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) dosing was determined in 
cynomolgus monkeys at doses that ranged from 0.1 to 300 mg/kg. In some studies anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
formation was assessed. Pooled PK data were modelled to determine overall PK parameters. The key findings 
were as follows:  
•  Greater than dose-proportional Cmax and AUC over a range of 0.1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg single IV doses, 
and dose-proportional exposure over a range of 3 to 300 mg/kg single IV doses.  
• 
Low (approximate 2-fold) accumulation ratio after repeat SC dosing of 25 to 225 mg/kg for 4 weeks 
or 25 and 150 mg/kg for 3 and 6 months (1.5- to 3-fold). 
•  Nonlinear PK consistent with target-mediated elimination. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 29/104 
  
  
• 
Estimated SC bioavailability of 60%. 
•  Volume of distribution typical of a monoclonal antibody suggesting limited extravascular distribution. 
•  ADAs detected coincidental with lower drug concentrations in some animals; effects on systemic 
exposure were only apparent at low doses so an assessment of the kinetics at pharmacologically and 
toxicologically relevant doses was not compromised. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicity was studied in cynomolgus monkeys, a pharmacologically relevant model and the 
exposure in the high dose group exceeded clinical exposure >100-fold. There were no toxicological findings of 
importance for the safety assessment.  One female monkey in the 1 month GLP study was euthanized on 
day 29 because of complications from immune complex-associated pathology (pyogranulomatous 
inflammation of lymph nodes) secondary to the development of circulating anti-AMG 334-immune complexes. 
Since immunogenicity to a human protein in an animal study is not predictive for clinical immunogenicity, this 
event is not suggestive of a clinical risk. 
Genotoxicity 
AMG 334 is a recombinant monoclonal antibody made up of naturally-occurring amino acids and contains no 
inorganic or synthetic organic linkers or other non-protein portions.  This indicates that it is highly unlikely 
that AMG 334 would react directly with DNA or other chromosomal material.  Therefore, no genotoxicity 
studies have been conducted, in accordance with ICH S6(R1). 
Carcinogenicity 
Per ICH S6(R1), an assessment of carcinogenicity is necessary when the product meets certain conditions, 
which in the case of AMG 334 is the expectation of continuous use of the product for > 6 months.  For small 
molecule therapeutics, carcinogenicity assays in mice and rats would be the standard approach to assess the 
risk of carcinogenesis.  These assays are not feasible for AMG 334 because it is a monoclonal antibody that 
does not have biologic activity in rodents.  AMG 334 has biologic activity in the cynomolgus monkey, but this 
species is not an appropriate model for evaluation of tumorigenic risk. 
Although there were no nonclinical studies conducted to assess carcinogenic risk, a comprehensive 
assessment of carcinogenic potential was performed based on knowledge of intended drug target, pathway 
primary and secondary pharmacology, data from nonclinical studies, and comprehensive literature review 
specifically addressing carcinogenicity risk.  
CGRP generally acts to down-regulate inflammation and a CGRP receptor inhibitor would not be anticipated to 
impair immune surveillance of tumors. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 30/104 
  
  
 
 
In vitro, CGRP increased cell proliferation by activating members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
family. Elevated CGRP expression has been observed in both plasma and tumors from specific cancers. The 
functional significance of the CGRP receptor and the ligand is unclear. However, any role for CGRP would 
likely be pro-carcinogenic and functional inhibition of CGRP would not be associated with carcinogenic risk. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
An enhanced pre- postnatal development study was performed in cynomolgus monkey. There were no AMG 
334-related effects on pregnancy/postpartum outcomes.  For foetuses that were aborted or stillborn, infants 
that died or were euthanized early, and infants that survived until the terminal necropsy at BD180 ± 2, there 
were no AMG 334-related effects in the placenta (when available) or on body weights; morphometric 
measurements; gross pathology; or on teratologic external, visceral, heart, or on skeletal evaluations and 
neurobehavioral assessments, where applicable. There were no effects on growth and development through 
6 months postpartum. 
Local Tolerance  
No dedicated local tolerance studies were conducted.  Local tolerance of AMG 334 was evaluated as part of 
toxicological assessment in the repeat-dose studies.  There were no macroscopic changes suggestive of 
intolerance. Macroscopic changes and/or minimal to moderate microscopic changes at the 
subcutaneous/intravenous injection site was observed and were attributed to the injection procedure and not 
related to the pharmacological activity of AMG 334. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Monoclonal antibodies such as AMG 334 are catabolized to individual amino acids and/or small peptides by 
endogenous proteases and high molecular weight prevents intact urinary excretion.  As such, excretion of 
active drug is not expected.  For these reasons, exposure to concentrations of AMG 334 in the environment 
does not pose any concern. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The primary pharmacodynamics program has been appropriate.  The discussion provided by the applicant on 
the biology of CGRP was considered to cover all aspects of importance for the safety evaluation. CGRP clearly 
has a widespread role and there are a number of biological mechanisms that theoretically could be affected 
by AMG 334 leading to adverse effects. However, both the literature and the safety data in cynomolgus 
monkey suggest that CGRP does not play an important role in homeostasis in normal situations. What cannot 
be excluded is that CGRP inhibition could have negative effects in combination with comorbidities and certain 
risk factors. The most import aspect relates to cardiovascular effects as CGRP has a vasodilatory action. 
While AMG 334 has not shown any effects on blood pressure in healthy animals and there was no evidence 
for blood pressure effect in clinical trials, there is a concern that CGRP may play a more crucial role in cases 
of ischemia. This has been experimentally studied with low molecular or peptidic CGRP antagonists in 
ischemia models in rat, pig and dogs, where the antagonist has no aggravating effects. While such risk 
cannot be fully excluded based on current data, it is not considered that further nonclinical studies with AMG 
334 would add to the safety assessment.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 31/104 
  
  
CGRP inhibition may lead to effects on the immune system, and could possibly modulate the immune 
response to infectious agents and the inflammatory response. No immunological effects were observed in the 
cynomolgus monkey studies. However, studies in healthy animals are not suitable to address small or 
moderate changes in host protection. In the absence of any signals from any of the nonclinical and clinical 
studies in relation to immune function and susceptibility to infection, there is no ground for requesting further 
studies on this subject. An effect of erenumab on immune functions remains a theoretical possibility. It is not 
considered justified to include this theoretical risk as a potential important safety concern in the RMP. 
However, it would be appropriate to provide reviews of adverse effects related to immune function, primarily 
infections in the future PSURs. 
An enhanced pre- postnatal development study was performed in cynomolgus monkey. It was agreed that 
this study did not identify any concerns for use during pregnancy. However, CGRP may be of importance to 
regulate uterine vascular resistance during pregnancy. There is a theoretical risk that CGRP inhibition may be 
a risk in pregnant women with risk factors for eclampsia. Based on such theoretical concerns, and also a 
more general uncertainty regarding treatment with a monoclonal antibody during pregnancy, it is 
recommended not to use Aimovig during pregnancy. 
Considering the very low transfer of IgG to milk and the limited uptake in the gut of the suckling child, the 
risk to the child is considered minimal. It is therefore appropriate to include a recommendation in the SmPC 
which would allow use during breast-feeding, if clinically needed.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There CHMP concluded that the non-clinical data provided were sufficient to support this dossier.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Based on the population PK analysis, the mean absorption time after sc administration was estimated to be 
3.36 days and absorption phase was complete in approximately 12 days. 
The relative bioavailability for SC administration when compared with that for IV administration was 
approximately 54% for AMG 334 after a single 140-mg dose. Based on the PopPK analysis the subcutaneous 
bioavailability of AMG 334 was estimated to be 81.8%.  
Most subjects included in the population PK analysis set received all of their SC injections in the arm (55%) 
and abdomen (36%); the remaining subjects received their SC injections in the thigh (3%) or unknown (6%) 
during the study. AMG 334 clearance did not differ according to injections site.  
Distribution 
According to the PopPK analysis, the estimated central volume of distribution was 4.350 L and volume of 
distribution at steady-state was 7.6 L.  
Elimination 
AMG 334 is an IgG2 antibody and as such no mass-balance study was performed.   
According to the PopPK analysis, linear clearance is independent of AMG 334 concentrations and estimated to 
be 198 mL/d (or 8.25 mL/h), which is similar to the reported clearance for endogenous IgG (10 mL/hr) in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 33/104 
  
  
 
literature, with a moderate IIV (27.6% CV).  The nonlinear clearance of AMG 334 is dependent on its 
concentrations and target density.  The maximal nonlinear clearance of the AMG 334-CGRP receptor complex 
is approximately 3.09 L/day and 16 times faster than the linear clearance (0.198 L/d). 
Based on model parameter estimates, at the clinical dose of 140 mg SC QM, the target-mediated pathway is 
saturated (peripheral target binding is >99%) for the entire dosing QM interval at steady state, which 
suggests complete blockade of peripheral target (extra-central nervous system).  Therefore, total clearance is 
predominantly linear (ie, nonlinear clearance is negligible) at the clinical dose regimen, and the terminal half-
life can be approximated using clearances and volumes of distribution, which is approximately 28 days for a 
typical subject.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
AMG334 exhibited nonlinear PK (exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased more than dose proportionally) over a 
dose range of 1 to 70 mg following single or multiple SC administrations to healthy subjects or subjects with 
migraine. After that, the exposure increased in proportion to the dose.

Subcutaneous Administrations of AMG 334 to Healthy Subjects and to Subjects With Migraine

Accumulation was approximately 1.6-fold from the first to the third dose following SC administrations of 
AMG334. Steady state was reached approximately at week 12.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
There were no differences in PK between healthy subjects and patients with migraine. 
Special population 
No dedicated studies in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment were performed for AMG334.  
Assessment report

In the popPK analysis using eGFR, renal function was not related to AMG 334 exposure. 
Weight was a significant covariate in the PopPK analysis, the median (range) bodyweight was 72.1 (39.8 to 
163) kg. Bodyweight was associated with AMG 334 PK parameters, namely central volume of distribution (Vc) 
and CL, such that increase in bodyweight results in decrease in AMG 334 exposures. For a 10 kg change from 
the dataset median (72 kg) in individual baseline bodyweight, CL changed by approximately 17% and V2 by 
approximately 21%. According to the exposure-response analysis, there appeared to be no additional effect 
of body weight on efficacy when differences in drug exposure were already accounted for.  
394 subjects (19%) in the popPK analysis were men.  The population PK analysis indicated that after 
accounting for bodyweight, gender did not have any notable effect on the PK parameters of AMG 334.  
The PK of AMG 334 at 70 mg was similar between healthy Japanese and white subjects. In the popPK 
analysis no overt difference was seen with respect to race even if there was limited number of others than 
white subjects. 
In the popPK analysis the presence of ADAs did not influence the exposure to AMG334 although the presence 
of ADAs was low (6.6% of subjects had binding anti-AMG 334 antibody). 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No in vitro metabolism and in vivo ADME studies have been performed for AMG 334. This is considered 
acceptable considering that AMG 334 is an IgG antibody.  
Two in vivo DDI studies were performed.  One of them showed that concomitant administration of AMG 334 
140 mg IV with sumatriptan SC had no effect on the PK of sumatriptan. However, as the study was done 
using IV dosing which is not the clinical administration route,  the PK results are not entirely applicable to SC 
administration.  
The effect of AMG 334 on the PK of ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate metabolites (norelgestromin and 
norgestrel) was investigated.  According to the Applicant the study was designed to maximize the potential 
for detecting a DDI taking PK samples 11 days after administration of a single dose of AMG 334 at cycle 3, 
since it is both close to tmax and corresponds to when maximal transcriptional effect on cytochrome P450 
enzymes, if any, is anticipated. This has not been supported and a study where AMG 334 was dosed to 
steady state instead as a single dose would have been more appropriate. The results from this study 
demonstrate that a single dose of AMG 334 does not affect the PK of ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate.  
Moreover, there is no mechanistic reason that a direct competitive inhibition should occur for an antibody 
such as AMG 334 with ethiny estradiol and/or norgestimate. 
Exposure –Response 
The aim of exposure-response analysis was to evaluate the effect of AMG 334 exposure on the change from 
baseline in monthly migraine days in episodic and chronic migraine patients by quantitatively describing the 
relationship between daily serum AMG 334 concentration and daily migraine rate.  Daily migraine response 
data from a total of 4 efficacy studies (2 phase 2 studies and 2 phase 3 studies) were included in the 
analysis. Covariates evaluated were age, sex, race, bodyweight, injection site, geographical region (North 
America and rest of the world), disease duration, and treatment with migraine prophylactic medication(s) 
prior to entry into screening. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 35/104 
  
  
 
Exploration of monthly migraine day reduction from baseline was tabulated and graphed versus near steady-
state Cmin (ie, at the week 9 to 12 visit period) for the pivotal and supporting episodic migraine studies 
(Studies 20120178, 20120296, and 20120297) and chronic migraine study (Study 20120295).  Evaluable 
subjects were grouped into exposure categories for comparison using the observed quartiles of week 12 Cmin 
exposures with a 70 mg QM regimen pooled across all 4 of the above listed clinical studies. 
A mixed effects logistic regression model was used to estimate daily migraine rates (ie, migraine day 
probability) during the baseline and double-blind study periods.  The response variable was whether or not 
the subject had a migraine day over the entire duration of study.  Subject-level random effect was included 
to estimate the probability of subject having a migraine day.  The model was fitted separately to data for 
subjects with episodic and chronic migraine. 
There was an incremental reduction in monthly migraine days for AMG 334-treated subjects with Cmin at 
week 12 above 4.12 µg/mL (corresponding to the lower Cmin quartile at 70 mg QM).  While 25% of patients 
at 70 mg fall below this level, only 3% of subjects in the 140 mg groups fell below this exposure. At week 12, 
the incremental improvement was 0.76 days for subjects with episodic migraine (Studies 20120178, 
20120296, and 20120297) and 0.38 days for subjects with chronic migraine (Study 20120295). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
CGRP is a neuropeptide that modulates nociceptive signalling and a vasodilator that has been associated with 
migraine pathophysiology. In contrast with other neuropeptides, CGRP levels have been shown to increase 
significantly during migraine and return to normal with headache relief. Intravenous infusion of CGRP induces 
migraine-like headache in patients, suggesting that CGRP may play a causal role in migraine. 
The CGRP receptor is located at sites that are relevant to migraine pathophysiology. Erenumab competes 
with the binding of CGRP and inhibits its function at the CGRP receptor. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Reduction of capsaicin-induced dermal blood flow 
Study 20101267 was a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and ascending multiple-
dose studies in healthy subjects and migraine subjects. The results of this study show a highly significant 
effect of AMG 334 at doses 21 mg and higher on inhibition of capsaicin-induced dermal blood flow (DBF). This 
effect was seen as early as day 4 after capsaicin application. As no significant effect could be shown for doses 
less than 21 mg, a steep dose-response curve between 7 mg AMG 334 and 21 mg AMG 334 is observed. For 
doses 21 mg and above (70 mg, 140 mg, 210 mg), there is no dose-dependent increase of the percent 
inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in DBF in the AMG 334 treatment group compared with the placebo 
group. Hence, based on phase 1 PD studies, a dose of 21 mg AMG 334 could be assumed to be suitable for 
further clinical efficacy studies.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and migraine subjects showed a highly significant effect of AMG 334 
doses 21 mg and higher on inhibition of capsaicin-induced dermal blood flow, indicating clinical effects from 
the 21 mg dose.  
In accordance with the exposure-response analyses presented by the applicant, the 140-mg regimen may 
provide a more robust maintenance of therapeutic concentration than 70-mg. This can be agreed for the 
episodic migraine population since a significant relationship between AMG 334 exposure and clinical efficacy 
for episodic migraine was seen and that the 70-mg dose provides an exposure that is still on the steep part 
of the exposure-response curve. 
The Applicant also stated that there was a significant relation between AMG 334 exposure and efficacy in the 
population with chronic migraine. The Applicant has provided statistical output that clarifies the exposure-
response for patients with chronic migraine. A linear model could describe this relation with higher erenumab 
leading to higher response. This indicates that the 140 mg dose has a higher likelihood to produce a 
therapeutic response compared to the 70 mg dose.  
The pharmacodynamics interaction study with sumatriptan on resting BP showed that there were no effect of 
AMG 334 alone and no interactions between AMG 334 IV and sumatriptan SC on BP, neither on MAP nor on 
systolic or diastolic BP, when measured at several time-points during the first 49 hours after AMG 334 
administration.  
The effects of different intrinsic factors on AMG 334 pharmacokinetics have been evaluated using popPK 
analysis. The popPK model sufficiently described the data. No studies was performed in renal and hepatic 
impaired subjects, this is acceptable considering that AMG 334 is a IgG antibody and is not expected to be 
influenced by renal and/ or liver impairment. 
Body Weight was a significant covariate in the PopPK analysis; however it has been shown with simulations 
that the exposures overlap for a dose of 140 mg and 2 mg/kg. Further, there was a trend for lower efficacy 
patients with high BMI.  
No in vitro metabolism and in vivo ADME studies has been performed for AMG 334. This was considered 
acceptable considering that AMG 334 is an IgG antibody.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP concluded that the clinical pharmacology package was adequate to support approval of Aimovig 
dossier.

Four adequately powered and designed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies 
providing evidence for the efficacy of AMG 334 in migraine prophylaxis in adults have been conducted.  Two 
of these 4 studies, 1 in CM and 1 in EM, are pivotal and include the originally proposed registration dose of 
140 mg; the other 2 studies, both in EM, are supportive and include doses of 70 mg or less.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study 20120178 in episodic migraine 
Based on the inhibition of capsaicin-induced dermal blood flow model, doses of 7 mg, 21 mg, and 70 mg 
were chosen by the Applicant for evaluation in the double-blind portion of phase 2 EM study with the intent to 
characterize the dose-response relationship and to aid in dose selection for further studies. 
This study was a phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, with a primary objective to 
evaluate the effect of AMG 334 compared to placebo in subjects with episodic migraine (EM). 483 subjects 
aged 18-60 were randomised. For the primary efficacy variable, reduction in mean monthly migraine days 
from baseline, a statistically significant change compared with placebo could be demonstrated for the 70 mg 
dose only. The same result was found for the secondary efficacy variable responder rate (≥ 50% reduction in 
monthly migraine days from baseline). For the secondary efficacy variable, reduction from baseline in 
monthly migraine attacks, a numerical reduction was seen for the highest dose of 70 mg AMG 334, but no 
statistically significant effect.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 39/104 
  
  
 
 
Subgroup analyses and a number of explanatory variables including patient reported outcome scores 
consistently showed a numerical improvement with the 70 mg dose, although there were only a few 
statistically significant findings. No effect could be shown for the lower doses. 
The conclusion of study 20120178 was that the assumed effective dose of 21 mg and the lower dose of 7 mg, 
showed no effect on primary, secondary or explanatory efficacy variables. The higher dose of 70 mg had a 
significant effect on the primary efficacy variable as well as on one of the secondary efficacy variables. For 
other explanatory variables a numerical difference in favour of the 70 mg dose was seen. Hence a higher 
dose might have even better effect and would be interesting to study. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study 20120295 
Methods 
This study was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with CM. The study 
consisted of an up to 3 weeks’ screening phase, a 4 weeks’ baseline phase,  a 12-week double-blind 
treatment phase that included AMG 334 at doses of 70 mg and 140 mg administered monthly (QM [every 4 
weeks]) by subcutaneous (SC) injection, and a 12 weeks’ follow-up phase. 
Study Participants  
The main inclusion criterion was patients who experienced 15 or more headache days per month, with  8 or 
more migraine days per month. 
Exclusion criteria included poorly controlled hypertension in the judgment of the investigator, or systolic 
blood pressure (BP) ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 100 mm Hg as measured at the screening or week -4 
study visits. Myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), unstable angina, coronary 
artery bypass surgery or other revascularization procedure within 12 months prior to screening. 
Treatments 
Double-blind AMG 334 70 mg, AMG 334 140 mg, or placebo was administered during the 12-week double 
blind treatment phase (ie, at day 1 and weeks 4 and 8). 
Investigational product was administered by authorized investigational site study staff as the last procedure 
after all other study visit procedures have been completed. The 2 injections were administered into the 
anterior abdominal wall, upper thigh, or upper arm. The injection site location should be the same for both 
syringes. Subjects should be observed for approximately 30 minutes after IP administration on day 1.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint for this study is the change in monthly migraine days from baseline to the last 4 weeks 
of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 40/104 
  
  
Secondary Endpoints 
•  At least a 50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days in the last 4 weeks 
of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase, calculated based on the following: 
if (change in monthly migraine days from baseline to the last 4 weeks of the 
double-blind treatment phase) *100/baseline monthly migraine days is less than or 
equal to – 50% 
•  Change from baseline in monthly acute migraine-specific medication treatment days 
in the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase 
•  Change from baseline in cumulative monthly headache hours in the last 4 weeks of 
the 12-week double-blind treatment phase 
Main Exploratory Endpoints 
•  Change in monthly migraine attacks from baseline to the last 4 weeks of the 12-week 
double-blind treatment phase 
•  Change in migraine-specific quality of life from baseline, as measured by the MSQ, 
version 2.1 at assessment time points 
•  Change in daily activity impact of headache from baseline, as measured by the HIT-6 
at assessment time points 
•  Change in migraine-related disability from baseline, as measured by the MIDAS 
(MIDAS total score, absenteeism score and presenteeism score) at assessment time 
Points 
Clinical outcome assessments were determined via eDiary data. 
Sample size 
Approximately 651 eligible subjects were planned to be randomized with a ratio of 3:2:2 to placebo, AMG 
334 70 mg, or AMG 334 140 mg, with a planned number of subjects in each treatment group as follows: 279 
subjects in the placebo group, 186 in the AMG 334 70-mg group, and 186 in the AMG 334 140-mg group. In 
Protocol Amendment 2, the number of randomized subjects was increased from 490 to 651 subjects to 
increase the power for each treatment arm and to adjust for multiplicity. Approximately 200 subjects were 
planned for inclusion in the novel PRO substudy. Approximately 120 subjects were planned for inclusion in 
the PK substudy.  
Assuming treatment effect compared to placebo of -1.9 for the AMG 334 70 mg group and a common SD of 
6.1, the planned sample size of 279 for placebo group and 186 for AMG 334 70 mg group will provide 85% 
power using a two sample t-test with a 2-sided significance level of 0.04. Assuming treatment effect 
compared to placebo of -2.21 for the AMG 334 140 mg group and a common SD of 6.1, the planned sample 
size of 279 for placebo group and 186 for AMG 334 140 mg group will provide 85% power using a two 
sample t-test with a 2-sided significance level of 0.01. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was based on a schedule generated by Amgen before the start of the study and was centrally 
executed using an IVR/IWR System. 
Assessment report

Approximately 651 subjects were planned to be randomised 3:2:2 to receive placebo, AMG 334 70 mg, or 
AMG 334 140 mg monthly (QM [every 4 weeks]) by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Randomisation was 
stratified by region (North America vs Other) and medication overuse at baseline (Yes vs No). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Placebo vials were packaged and formulated to match the vials containing 
AMG 334. The subject, site personnel, and Amgen study personnel and designees were blinded to the 
randomized treatment group assignment.  
Statistical methods 
Before the analyses for this study report were conducted, the protocol-defined statistical analyses were 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which was amended once prior to database lock. Subjects were 
analysed based on their randomised treatment group assignment. 
Statistical Hypothesis: The null hypothesis was that in subjects with chronic migraine, neither of the AMG 334 
doses differs from placebo with respect to change in monthly migraine days from baseline. The alternative 
hypothesis was that in subjects with chronic migraine, at least 1 AMG 334 dose reduces monthly migraine 
days from baseline to a greater extent than placebo. 
Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint for this study is the change in monthly migraine days from baseline 
to the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase. The primary endpoint was calculated as: 
(number of migraine days during the last 4 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase) – (number of 
migraine days during the 4-week baseline phase) 
Results 
Conduct of the study 
This study was conducted from 05 March 2014 (first subject enrollment) to 28 April 2016 (last subject end of 
study) at 69 centers in Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Norway, Poland, Sweden, 
United Kingdom, and USA.

Outcomes and estimation 
Of the 667 randomized subjects, overall 94.6% completed the study (92.7% in the placebo group, 96.3% in 
the 70 mg group and 95.8% in the 140 mg group). 82.8% were women, 94.2% were white, and the mean 
(minimum to maximum) age was 42.1 (18 to 66) years. The mean disease duration was 21.7 years, 73.8% 
had used previous migraine prophylactic treatment. 99.1% used acute medications. Mean monthly migraine 
days was 17.99 days and mean monthly headache days was 20.83.

Randomization was stratified by medication overuse at baseline and region. Medication overuse was reported 
for 41.1% of randomized subjects at baseline. Approximately half of the randomized subjects were in North 
America (47.2%) and half were in other regions (52.8%).  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
Table 7. Change From Baseline in Monthly Migraine Days, Observed, GLIMMIX 
Model (Efficacy Analysis Set) 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the treatment effect of AMG 334 compared 
with placebo on the change from baseline in monthly migraine days. Results for the sensitivity analyses were 
consistent with those observed for the primary analysis.  
The secondary endpoints responder rate and monthly acute migraine-specific medication days were 
highly statistically significant at both doses (P<0.001), whereas the endpoint “cumulative monthly 
headache hours” was only nominally statistically significant at the 140 mg dose (p=0.28 for the 70 mg 
dose, p=0.030 for the 140 mg dose). The monthly acute migraine-specific medication days endpoint 
was analyzed for the total study population event though a proportion of subjects did not use 
migraine-specific medications during baseline.

Exploratory endpoints 
Frequency- and pain intensity-related endpoints 
Monthly headache days and Monthly moderate and severe headache days were both highly statistically 
significant at all measured time-points (w 4, 8 and 12, respectively). 
Monthly migraine attacks was significant only at the 70 mg dose at week 8, otherwise (w 4, 12 and at the 
140 mg dose) non-significant. 
Monthly average of severity of migraine pain was non-significant throughout the study. 
Migraine-related symptoms  
Nausea, vomiting, phonophobia, photophobia, static allodynia, dynamic allodynia: 
Neither of these symptoms was significantly affected by AMG 334 treatment during the study.  These 
endpoints were analyzed for the total study population even though a proportion of subjects did not present 
these symptoms during baseline. 
Patient-reported outcomes (MIDAS, HIT-6, MSQ subscores, ASC-12, PROMIS) were in general statistically 
significant for both doses, except for ASC-12, which was non-significant at both doses. 
Subgroup analyses of primary endpoint 
Patients who had ever used onabotulinum toxin (Botox) as migraine prophylaxis had a worse outcome 
compared to patients who had never used Botox before. For previous use of topiramate as migraine 
prophylaxis, the same difference was not noticed. 
Study 20120296 
Methods 
This was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with EM.  The study had a 
24-week double-blind treatment phase that included AMG 334 at doses of 70 mg and 140 mg QM (every 4 
weeks) SC.  Subjects who completed the double-blind phase were then re-randomized to receive either AMG 
334 70 mg or AMG 334 140 mg QM [every 4 weeks] SC for an additional 28 weeks of treatment. 
Study Participants  
The main inclusion criteria were subjects with a history of migraine (with or without aura) for 12 months or 
more  and  /or  with  migraine  frequency  included  between  4  and  15  migraines  days  per  month  or  headache 
frequency less than 15 headache days per month. 
Treatments 
AMG 334 70 mg, AMG 334 140 mg, or placebo was dosed monthly (QM) by subcutaneous (SC) injections.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint:  
Change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days. The mean monthly migraine days will be calculated 
using the monthly migraine days from each of the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the double-blind 
treatment phase.  
Secondary Endpoints: 
• Achievement of at least a 50% reduction from baseline in mean monthly migraine days 
over the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the double-blind treatment phase 
• Change from baseline in mean monthly acute migraine-specific medication treatment 
days over the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the double-blind treatment phase 
• Change from baseline in mean physical impairment domain scores as measured 
by the MPFID over the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the double-blind 
treatment phase 
• Change from baseline in mean impact on everyday activities domain scores as 
measured by the MPFID over the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the double-blind treatment phase 
Sample size 
Approximately 852 eligible subjects were planned to be randomised with a ratio of 1:1:1 to placebo, AMG 
334 70 mg, or AMG 334 140 mg, with a planned number of 284 subjects in each treatment group. 
Assuming a treatment effect compared to placebo of -1.12 for the AMG 334 70 mg group and a common 
standard deviation of 3.78, the planned sample size of 284 subjects per group will provide 90% power using 
a two sample t-test with a 2-sided significance level of 0.04. Assuming treatment effect compared to placebo 
of -1.30 for the AMG 334 140 mg group and a common standard deviation of 3.78, the planned sample size 
of 284 subjects per group will provide 90% power using a two sample t-test with a 2-sided significance level 
of 0.01. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was based on a schedule generated by Amgen before the start of the study and was centrally 
executed using an IVR/IWR System. 
Approximately 852 subjects were planned to be randomised 1:1:1 to receive placebo, AMG 334 70 mg, or 
AMG 334 140 mg monthly (QM [every 4 weeks]) by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Randomisation was 
stratified by region (North America vs Other) and treatment status with migraine prophylactic medication (a. 
current migraine prophylactic medication treatment; b. prior migraine prophylactic medication treatment 
only; c. no prior or current migraine prophylactic medication treatment). 
At the week-24 visit, subjects in each treatment group were re-randomised 1:1 to AMG 334 70 mg or AMG 
334 140 mg for the 28-week active treatment phase. The re-randomisation was stratified by treatment group 
assigned during the double-blind phase.

Statistical methods 
Before the analyses for this study report were conducted, the protocol-defined statistical analyses were 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which was amended once prior to the database snapshot for 
the primary analysis. 
Statistical Hypothesis: The null hypothesis was that in subjects with episodic migraine, neither of the AMG 
334 doses differ from placebo with respect to change in mean monthly migraine days from baseline to the 
last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the double-blind treatment phase. The alternative hypothesis was that 
in subjects with episodic migraine, at least 1 AMG 334 dose reduces mean monthly migraine days from 
baseline to a greater extent than placebo. 
The primary analysis was performed when the last randomized subject had completed the week 24 
assessment or were discontinued from the study. 
Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint for this study is the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine 
days. The mean monthly migraine days was calculated using the monthly migraine days from each of the last 
3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the 24-week double-blind treatment phase. The primary endpoint was 
calculated as: 
(mean monthly migraine days over the last 3 months [months 4, 5, and 6] of the double-blind 
treatment phase [DBTP]) – (monthly migraine days during the 4-week baseline phase).

Numbers analysed 
Outcomes and estimation 
Of the 955 randomized subjects, overall 90.6% completed investigational product (study still ongoing) 
(89.0% in the placebo group, 90.5% in the 70 mg group and 92.2% in the 140 mg group). 85.2% were 
women, 89.1% were white, and the mean (minimum to maximum) age was 40.9 (18 to 65) years. The mean 
disease duration was 19.85 years, 56.5% were treatment naïve to migraine prophylactic treatment. Mean 
monthly migraine days was 8.29 days and mean monthly headache days was 9.20. 
Primary efficacy endpoint:

The difference in least squares means (LSMs) (95% CI) was -1.40 (–1.88, –0.92) days for AMG 334 70 mg 
vs placebo and –1.85 (–2.33, –1.37) days for AMG 334 140 mg versus placebo (p < 0.001 for both). There 
was a statistically significant mean reduction in the change in mean monthly migraine days from baseline to 
the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the 24-week double-blind treatment phase for AMG 334 70 mg and 
AMG 334 140 mg as compared with placebo.  
Results for the sensitivity analyses (LOCF/ANCOVA model, Generalised linear mixed effect model, per 
protocol analysis set (GLIMMIX model), Multiple imputation/ANCOVA model, Multiple imputation/MNAR-
Control –based pattern imputation/ANOCOVA model) were consistent with those observed for the primary 
analysis with all p-values being <0.001. 
Subgroup analyses indicated that there was no major difference in the outcome of the primary endpoint 
related to region, prior migraine prophylactic medication use, BMI, baseline monthly migraine days (< or ≥8 
days). The subgroup analysis for subjects with< or ≥8 days baseline migraine days showed a difference in 
LSM of -1.50 (-2.12, -0.89) and -1.93 (-2.54, -1.32) for the 70 mg and 140 mg doses in subjects with <8 
and a difference in LSM of -1.36 (-2.08, -0.63) and -1.78 (-2.51, -1.05) for the 70 mg and 140 mg doses in

subjects with ≥8 baseline monthly migraine days. Subjects having failed at least 1 previous migraine 
prophylaxis had a worse response in the placebo group compared to the non-failed subgroup. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 50% reduction in mean monthly migraine days 
from baseline to the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the 24-week double-blind treatment phase was 
26.6%, 43.3%, and 50.0% for the placebo, AMG 334 70-mg, and AMG 334 140-mg groups, respectively; 
results were statistically significant for each AMG 334 group vs placebo (p < 0.001 for both).  
There was a statistically significant greater mean reduction in mean monthly acute migraine-specific 
medication treatment days from baseline to the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the 24-week 
double-blind treatment phase for AMG 334 70 mg and AMG 334 140 mg compared with placebo. The 
difference in LSMs (95% CI) was -0.94 (-1.23, –0.64) days for AMG 334 70 mg vs placebo and –1.42 (–1.71, 
–1.12) days for AMG 334 140 mg vs placebo (p < 0.001 for both). It should be noted that this endpoint was 
analyzed for the total study population event though a considerable proportion of subjects did not use 
migraine-specific medications during baseline. 
There was a statistically significant greater mean reduction in mean monthly average physical impairment 
domain scores, as measured by the MPFID, from baseline to the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the 
double-blind treatment phase for AMG 334 70 mg and AMG 334 140 mg compared to placebo. The difference 
in LSMs (95% CI) was –1.86 (–2.95, –0.77) for AMG 334 70 mg vs placebo and –2.43 (-3.51, -1.35) for AMG 
334 140 mg vs placebo (p < 0.001 for both). (Data not shown) 
There was a statistically significant greater mean reduction in mean monthly average everyday activities 
domain scores, as measured by the MPFID, from baseline to the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the 
double-blind treatment phase for AMG 334 70 mg and AMG 334 140 mg compared to placebo. The difference 
in LSMs (95% CI) was -2.22 (–3.28, –1.16) for AMG 334 70 mg vs placebo and –2.57 (-3.62, -1.51) for AMG 
334 140 mg vs placebo (p < 0.001 for both). (Data not shown) 
Exploratory endpoints 
The proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 75% reduction in mean monthly migraine days 
from baseline to the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the 24-week double-blind treatment phase was 
7.9%, 20.8%, and 22.0% for the placebo, AMG 334 70-mg, and AMG 334 140-mg groups, respectively; 
results were statistically significant for each AMG 334 group vs placebo (p < 0.001 for both).  
However, there was no significant increase in the proportion of subjects achieving a 100 % reduction in 
mean monthly migraine days from baseline to the last 3 months (months 4, 5, and 6) of the 24-week 
double-blind treatment. The numbers were 2.8%, 3.2% and 5.0% for the placebo, AMG 334 70-mg, and 
AMG 334 140-mg groups, respectively. 
The change from baseline in the monthly average severity of migraine pain was significant over month 4, 
5 and 6 for both AMG 334 doses (p=0.002 for the 70 mg dose, p=0.003 for the 140 mg dose), whereas it 
was only borderline significant when assessed at each monthly assessment time-point (week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
24, respectively). 
Patient-reported outcomes 
HIT-6, Modified MIDAS, and MSQ scores were highly statistically significant at Months 4, 5, and 6.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The efficacy data for the week 12 were pooled for three studies which had used the 70 mg dose with episodic 
migraine as the indication (pivotal EM study 20120296, supportive EM study 20120297, and dose-finding EM 
study 20120178). In the pooled analyses, AMG 334 70 mg showed consistent efficacy over placebo for the 
primary endpoint of change from baseline in MMD, as well as for each of the secondary endpoints examined, 
see Table below.

CMH = Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel; LSM = least squares mean; CI = confidence interval, SD = standard deviation; MPFID = 
Migraine Physical Function Impact Diary; N = number of subjects in the Efficacy Analysis Set. 
The Efficacy Analysis Set includes subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product and had at least 1 change 
from baseline measurement in MMD during the double-blind treatment phase.  The model includes individual patient data 
from Studies 20120296, 20120297, and 20120178 (20120296 and 20120297 for MPFID endpoints) for subjects 
randomized to placebo or AMG 334 70 mg.  The pairwise comparisons compare AMG 334 70 mg vs placebo (reference 
group).  All p-values are unadjusted. 
a Adjusted analysis utilizes a generalized linear mixed model which includes treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction, 
study, region, prior/current treatment with migraine prophylactic medication, and baseline value as covariates and 
assumes a first-order autoregressive covariance structure.  All visits up to week 12 were included in the model. 
b The common odds ratios and p-values are obtained from a CMH test, stratified by study. 
c Impact on everyday activities domain score and physical impairment domain score range from 0 to 100.  Higher scores 
represent greater impact of migraine (ie, higher burden).

Supportive studies 
Study 20120297 in episodic migraine 
A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to 
evaluate the effect of AMG 334 compared to placebo in subjects with episodic migraine (ARISE Study). 
Approximately 540 subjects were planned to be randomized 1:1 to receive placebo or AMG 334 70 mg 
monthly (QM [every 4 weeks]) by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Randomization was stratified by region 
(North America vs Other) and treatment status with migraine prophylactic medication (a. current migraine 
prophylactic medication treatment; b. prior migraine prophylactic medication treatment only; c. no prior or 
current migraine prophylactic medication treatment). This study was planned to be the second pivotal study

for episodic migraine, but since the 140 mg dose was chosen as the therapeutic dose for MAA, this study is 
considered a supportive study in the present application. This study was, except for the choice of dose (only 
70 mg vs placebo), duration of the double-blind treatment period (12 weeks), and choice of third secondary 
endpoint (≥5-point responder rates at MPFID physical and everyday activities domain scores),  identical to 
the EM pivotal study 20120296. 
This study was conducted at 69 centers in Denmark, France, Greece, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, 
and the United States of America (USA). 
Adults 18 to 65 years of age with history of migraine with or without aura for ≥12 months and who 
experienced  ≥4 and < 15 migraine days per month with < 15 headache days per month, on average across 
the 3 months prior to screening, were eligible for this study.  
Baseline demographics, disease characteristics and use of prior prophylactic medication were balanced and 
similar to the pivotal 20120296 study. 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint:  
There was a statistically significant greater reduction in the change in monthly migraine days from baseline to 
the last month of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase for AMG 334 70 mg as compared with placebo. 
The difference in least squares mean (LSM) (95% CI) was –1.04 (-1.61, -0.47) days for AMG 334 70 mg vs 
placebo (p < 0.001).  
Secondary endpoints:  
The proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 50% reduction in monthly migraine days from baseline to 
the last month of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase was 29.5% for the placebo group and 39.7% for 
the AMG 334 70-mg treatment group; results were statistically significant for the AMG 334 70-mg group vs 
placebo (p = 0.010).  
There was a statistically significant greater reduction in the change from baseline in monthly acute migraine-
specific medication treatment days in the last month of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase for AMG 
334 70 mg as compared with placebo. The difference in LSM (95% CI) was –0.59 (–0.96, –0.21) days for 
AMG 334 70 mg vs placebo (p = 0.002).  
The proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 5-point reduction from baseline to the last month of the 
double-blind treatment phase in the average impact on everyday activities domain scores by MPFID was 
numerically larger for AMG 334 70 mg (40.4%) compared to placebo (35.8%), but the difference was not 
statistically significant (p=0.26).  
The proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 5-point reduction from baseline to the last month of the 
double-blind treatment phase in the average physical impairment domain scores by MPFID was numerically 
larger for AMG 334 70 mg (33.0%) compared to placebo (27.1%), but the difference was not statistically 
significant (p=0.13).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In the pivotal CM study (study 20120295), study participants should have been diagnosed with migraine 
according to ICHD-III Diagnostic criteria for migraine, have at least 15 headache days per month of which ≥ 
8 assessed as migraine days. Subjects were excluded if they had not responded to >3 migraine prophylaxis 
categories, were diagnosed with fibromyalgia or had suffered from cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events 
during the last 12 months prior to screening. 
The dose of 140 mg was divided into two injections (2 x 70 mg) in all clinical trials investigating the 140 mg 
dose, since the 140 mg dose was not yet available. For blinding reasons, all subjects in such studies received 
2 injections. 
All 4 studies included either an open-label or an active treatment component. Unlike the recommendations of 
the current EMA migraine guidelines, there was no active control arm in the pivotal studies. In contrast, in 
the International Headache Society (IHS) migraine guidelines, there is no such recommendation and other 
recent pivotal clinical trials in migraine have also been conducted without an active control arm.  
The primary endpoint (monthly migraine days, MMD) was the same in all efficacy studies, which facilitates 
comparisons between studies. This endpoint was chosen by the Applicant arguing the difficulty in measuring 
the duration of a migraine attack and because migraine days a more sensitive efficacy endpoint. The EMA 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of migraine (CPMP/EWP/788/01 
Rev.1, January 2007), recommends number or migraine attacks as primary endpoint but this endpoint could 
be considered acceptable according to the IHS Guidelines for controlled trials of prophylactic treatments. For 
CM, three different alternative primary endpoints have been recommended in the International Headache 
Society (IHS) Guideline on clinical trials for CM (Silberstein et al, 2008): monthly headache days with 
moderate or severe intensity, monthly migraine days, or number of migraine episodes. 
Regarding secondary endpoints, Silberstein et al (2008) recommend a 50% responder rate for migraine 
studies in general, but comments that ”in the CM population, a 30% responder rate can be clinically 
meaningful.” Furthermore, Silberstein et al recommend inclusion of Intensity of headache as one of the 
secondary endpoints. It is noted that intensity of headache has been included as exploratory endpoint and in 
addition indirectly captured by migraine days of moderate to severe intensity, or as part of QoL assessment 
scales and acute migraine medication use. Although being important to the patients, the effect of AMG 334 
on headache intensity was not as strong or consistent as for the primary and secondary endpoints. This 
discrepancy could partly be explained by the fact that headache intensity was only an exploratory endpoint in 
the current clinical programme. Headache intensity was graded as 1-3 at its peak intensity during each 
migraine headache. This fact, in combination with the use of acute or non-specific migraine medications 
taken in close relation to the headache was not taken into consideration for this exploratory endpoint. 
Only the time frame for comparison with baseline differs between the two pivotal studies, where the current 
CM study compares the last 4 weeks of the 12-week double-blind treatment phase with baseline values, 
whereas the pivotal EM study (20120296) compares the MMD during month 4, 5, and 6 with baseline. 
Secondary endpoints differ on the cumulative headache hours, which in the EM study (20120296) is replaced 
by the PRO scale MPFID developed by the applicant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 61/104 
  
  
The MPFID was developed to evaluate the impact of migraine on physical functioning. Besides some 
limitations as pointed out in the article of Kawata et al (Headache, 2017) the MPFID could help to identify 
areas of migraine impact and evaluate changes over time. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy and safety of Aimovig has been studied in one pivotal phase 2/3 trial in chronic migraine (CM) 
patients and one pivotal study in episodic migraine (EM) at the proposed therapeutic dose 140 mg SC and 
lowest effective dose 70 mg SC once monthly. Two supportive studies in episodic migraine included only the 
lowest effective dose, 70 mg SC once monthly, but not the 140 mg dose. Age was 18-65 in all studies but the 
phase 2 EM study, where the age was 18-60 years. 
Dose-response study 20120178 in episodic migraine 
Study 20120178 was a phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized dose response study in 
patients with EM. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of monthly SC injections of AMG 334 
compared to placebo on the change from baseline in monthly migraine days (MMD). The doses, 7 mg SC, 21 
mg SC and 70 mg SC were studied with the assumption that 21 mg would be an effective dose. The change 
in MMD was calculated at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The 70 mg dose displayed a significant effect at all time points. 
At week 12, the reduction in monthly migraine days as compared to placebo was 1.12 days (p=0.021). For 
the lower doses (7 mg SC, 21 mg SC), there was no effect on the primary efficacy variable.  
Except for borderline significant result (p=0.041) for the 70 mg dose at 8 weeks for reduction of severity of 
vomiting, there was no significant change from baseline in monthly severity of migraine related symptoms 
(nausea, vomiting, aura, photophobia and phonophobia). All patients were included in these analyses, 
although only a minority had the corresponding symptom. The severity of the migraine related symptoms 
was graded as 1=mild, 2=moderate or 3=severe and 0 if a symptom was not reported for qualified migraine 
headache. Therefore, mean severity of the symptoms at baseline and the respective time points are below 1 
for most of the migraine related symptoms. This leads to a dilution of the results, making it harder to find 
any possible true treatment effect. 
 The conclusion of study 20120178 is that the assumed effective dose of 21 mg and the lower dose of 7 mg, 
showed no effect on primary, secondary or explanatory efficacy variables. The higher dose of 70 mg had a 
significant effect on the primary efficacy variable as well as on one of the secondary efficacy variables. For 
other variables a numerical difference in favour of the 70 mg dose was seen. Hence, the results were 
interpreted as that a higher dose might have even better effect and hence the applicant decided to study the 
140 mg dose. 
Pivotal study 20120295 in chronic migraine 
Study 20120295 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in CM patients. Among the 667 randomised 
subjects, 631 (94.6%) completed the study. The percentage of subjects completing the study (ie, completed 
the week 12 assessment) was somewhat lower in the placebo group (92.7%) compared to the treatment 
groups (96.3% for the70 mg dose and 95.8% for the 140 mg dose), and most patients who discontinued did 
so due to withdrawal of consent or were lost to follow up in the placebo group. 
In the CM study, the number of randomised subjects was increased from 490 to 651 subjects in Amendment 
2 to increase the power for each treatment arm and to adjust for multiplicity. This is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 62/104 
  
  
The requirement of one post baseline measurement for inclusion in the efficacy analysis is a violation of the 
ITT principle. However since the number of patients excluded for this reason is low (n=4), this is not 
considered to have influenced the conclusions of the study. 
The method for controlling the type I error rate was considered acceptable for the primary and secondary 
endpoints. The primary analysis model is a linear mixed effects model without any imputation for missing 
data. However, sensitivity analyses with imputation based both on MAR and MNAR assumptions have been 
performed. For the responder variables, non-response has been imputed for missing data. The sensitivity 
analyses performed are considered sufficient. 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups. The mean 
baseline number of monthly migraine days was 18.0 and the mean number of monthly headache days was 
20.8, i.e. the vast majority of headache days were assessed as having migraine quality by the subject. The 
majority (67.9%) had failed previous prophylactic treatment and 49% had failed at least 2 previous 
prophylactic treatments. 
The proportions of subjects with history of migraine with aura (41.4%) and without aura (87.6%) partially 
overlap. This is due to the fact that subjects could belong to three different categories: either always 
experience migraine with aura, or always experience migraine without aura, or experience a combination 
(sometime experiencing aura, but not always) The subjects in the latter group were counted in both groups 
and thus the proportion of patients in the overall study population with  and without history of aura partially 
overlap and does not sum up to 100% as each individual could have been counted either for one or both 
groups. It has been suggested that migraine with aura and migraine without aura are clinically two different 
entities, that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the onset of attack are most likely different, and 
that clinical trials should differentiate between results on migraine attacks with or without aura (Tfelt-Hansen 
et al, 2012). However, the subgroup analyses from the pivotal studies 20120295 (CM) and 20120296 (EM) 
showed no meaningful differences for migraine days, responder rate and acute migraine-specific medication 
treatment days between patients who had ever experienced migraine aura and those who had not. 
Topiramate (68.3% of subjects), beta blockers (52.8%), tricyclic antidepressants (48.2%), and botulinum 
toxin (32.1%) were the most frequently used prior prophylactic medications.  
Randomization was stratified by medication overuse, which was reported for 41.1% of randomized subjects 
at baseline.  
The primary endpoint was highly significant at both doses tested (70 mg and 140 mg SC once monthly) and 
this result was consistent through different sensitivity analyses. 
The mean reduction of monthly migraine days was -6.53 days at the 140 mg dose (-6.63 at 70 mg) and -
4.24 in the placebo group, yielding a numerical difference of -2.29 monthly migraine days compared to 
placebo at the 140 mg dose. This is in line with the 2.0 monthly migraine days difference seen in the Botox 
pivotal studies (Botox SmPC). The placebo response was lower in the current study, being -6.2 days in the 
Botox study. 
The secondary endpoints responder rate and monthly acute migraine-specific medication days were highly 
statistically significant at both doses, whereas the endpoint “cumulative monthly headache hours” was only 
significant at the 140 mg dose. 
Both responder rate based on 50% reduction of MMD and reduction of monthly acute migraine-specific 
medication days are considered clinically relevant endpoints. A responder rate of 41.2% in chronic migraine 
is considered clinically relevant, and the difference to placebo was 17.7%, which is good. In comparison, in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 63/104 
  
  
the pooled pivotal Botox trials, 47% of the subjects achieved a 50% reduction of monthly headache days 
versus 35% in placebo, i.e. the difference was only 12%. 
Patient-reported outcomes were overall statistically significant with the exception of ASC-12, which showed 
only a positive trend. It is important to analyse whether these statistically significant changes also represent 
clinically meaningful differences to the patients. For HIT-6, a reduction of at least 2.3 points has been 
reported to be the minimally important difference (MID) for chronic migraine. In the present study, a LSM of 
2.5 vs placebo was seen, exceeding the MID. For MIDAS, no MID has been established.  For MSQ, the MIDs 
for all subdomains, being 3.2 for the RFR score, 4.6 for the RFP score and 7.5 for the Ef score, were 
exceeded in the present study with LSM being 7.35, 4.94 and 8.90 for the RFR, RFP and EF scores, 
respectively. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint appeared to show, among other baseline covariates, that subjects 
who had ever used onabotulinum toxin (Botox) had a lower reduction of monthly migraine days compared to 
those who had never used onabotulinum toxin. Since the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin in the 
prophylaxis of chronic migraine has been claimed to be at least partly mediated through blockade of local 
(peripheral) release of neuropeptides (including CGRP) involved in migraine induction, it is possible that 
subjects being non-responders to botulinum toxin migraine prophylaxis also showed a lower degree of 
response to AMG 334. However, the total number of subjects in this subgroup was low. Breakdown of Botox 
users into those who have not failed Botox or Botox treatment failures resulted in such small subgroups that 
the results of the subgroups could not be analysed in a meaningful way. 
On the other hand, subjects who had previously been treated with topiramate did not show a worse outcome 
than those not previously treated with topiramate. 
Pivotal study 20120296 in episodic migraine 
Most of the endpoints are the same in the two pivotal studies. The primary endpoint is monthly migraine days 
in all studies, facilitating comparisons between studies. This endpoint is also recommended along with 
migraine attacks as possible primary endpoints in the HIS guidelines for clinical trials on EM (Tfelt-Hansen et 
al, 2012).  
The major difference from the CM study is that MPFID is included as one of the secondary endpoints instead 
of cumulative headache hours. MPFID is a QoL assessment scale developed by the applicant, which was not 
ready to use when the CM study was started. The 2 points difference (0-100 points scale) observed could be 
considered as clinically relevant according to the methods used by the MAH to interpreted differences 
between groups. Cumulative headache hours is considered difficult to measure since the intensity can vary to 
a great extent during migraine episodes and the cut off line between ”headache” and ”no headache” can be 
hard to draw for the subject. Cumulative monthly headache hours was also the only secondary endpoint 
which was not highly significant (at the 70 mg dose it was non-significant, at the 140 mg dose p= 0.03) in 
the CM study, which may have contributed to the change of secondary endpoints. 
The requirement of one post baseline measurement for inclusion in the efficacy analysis is a violation of the 
ITT principle. However since the number of patients excluded for this reason is low (n=6), this is not 
considered to have influenced the conclusions of the study. 
The method for controlling the type I error rate is considered acceptable for the primary and secondary 
endpoints. 
The primary analysis model is a linear mixed effects model without any imputation for missing data. 
However, sensitivity analyses with imputation based both on MAR and MNAR assumptions have been 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 64/104 
  
  
performed. For the responder variables, non-response has been imputed for missing data. The sensitivity 
analyses performed are considered sufficient. 
In study 20120296, the planned number of subjects was 852; however the actual number of randomised 
subjects in this study was 955. A sample size re-estimation was planned after 30% of the planned number of 
subjects had completed three months of treatment. The results from this sample size re-estimation was that 
the sample size should remain unchanged. The over-enrolment was due to a long screening and baseline 
period (7 weeks in total) during which it could not be fully predicted exactly how many patients would be 
randomised in the end.  
As for the CM pivotal study, the discontinuation rate during the double-blind treatment phase (24 weeks) was 
overall low (9.1%), was highest in the placebo group (11.0%), and the main reason was subject request 
(4.7%) followed by adverse event (2.1%). During the 28 weeks’ active treatment phase (re-randomised to 
receive either 70 or 140 mg), 650 out of 844 (68.1%) continued active treatment. 
Baseline demographics were balanced between the treatment groups and very similar to the ones for the 
chronic migraine study 20120295. The mean age was about 1 year younger in the patients with episodic 
migraine compared to the ones with chronic migraine. 
Baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups. The mean monthly migraine 
days were 8.29 compared to 17.99 for chronic migraine, indicating that the applicant had managed to include 
subjects representative for chronic and episodic migraine, respectively. However, 8.29 migraine days per 
month, as in the episodic migraine study, also represents a significant level of suffering. 
Use of prior migraine prophylactic medication was balanced between groups. 56.5% were treatment naïve for 
prior prophylactic migraine treatment in the current EM study, versus 26.2% in the CM study (Study 
20120295). 
The reduction in monthly migraine days was -3.83 at the 140 mg, -3.36 at the 70 mg dose, and -1.95 in the 
placebo group. The treatment difference was -1.88 for the 140 mg dose compared to placebo. This was 
slightly lower than in the CM study 20120295 (where this difference was -2.29). However, one should keep in 
mind that the difference in baseline monthly migraine days was 9.7 days between these two studies (CM 
study 17.99, EM study 8.29).  
Since the applicant has proposed an indication text specifying the minimal number of monthly migraine days 
to at least 4, it was considered relevant to analyse whether there was a difference in efficacy between the 
subjects with baseline MMD of <8 days per month versus subjects with ≥8 days per month. This subgroup 
analysis showed a difference in LSM of -1.50 (-2.12, -0.89) and -1.93 (-2.54, -1.32) for the 70 mg and 140 
mg doses in subjects with <8 and a difference in LSM of -1.36 (-2.08, -0.63) and -1.78 (-2.51, -1.05) for the 
70 mg and 140 mg doses in subjects with ≥8 baseline monthly migraine days, indicating that the treatment 
effect was similar in both subgroups. In the <8 MDD subgroup, the mean MDD at baseline was 6.1-6.2 days 
and the reduction was -0.95 for placebo, -2.45 for 70 mg and -2.88 for 140 mg, yielding a % change from 
baseline of 15.6%, -40.2% and -46.3% for placebo, 70 mg and 140 mg erenumab. This supports the 
proposed indication text of erenumab as prophylactic treatment for adults with ≥4 migraine days per month. 
These results are in line with the results of a phase 3 study with topiramate vs placebo in episodic migraine, 
where topiramate at 100 or 200 mg daily doses reduced the monthly migraine days from a baseline value of 
about 6.5 with 1.8 more days than placebo. 
It has been suggested in the literature that a reduction of 1 monthly headache day may be regarded as the 
minimal important difference (Silberstein et al, 2010). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 65/104 
  
  
The proportion of subjects reaching the 50% responder rate at the 140 mg dose was 50%, compared to 
26.6% for the placebo group. Also the two other secondary endpoints reduction in acute migraine-specific 
medication days and MPFID domain scores were significant vs placebo. Even though both doses produced a 
highly significant result, the results numerically favoured the 140 mg dose over the 70 mg dose. 
The 75% reduction in migraine days responder rate was statistically significant for each AMG 334 group vs 
placebo (p < 0.001 for both).  
However, the 100 % reduction responder rate was not significantly affected since these numbers were very 
low in all treatment groups.  
The change from baseline in the monthly average severity of migraine pain was significant over month 4, 5 
and 6 for both AMG  334 doses (p=0.002 for the 70 mg dose, p=0.003 for the 140 mg dose).  
For HIT-6, a reduction of at least 1.5 points has been reported to be the minimally important difference 
(MID) for episodic migraine. In the present study, a LSM of 2.3 vs placebo was seen at the 140 mg dose, 
thus exceeding the MID. 
For MIDAS, no MID has been established.  
For MSQ, the MIDs have been reported to be 3.2 for the RFR score, 4.6 for the RFP score and 7.5 for the EF 
score. The MIDs were exceeded for the RFR and RFP scores, but not for the EF score in the present study 
with LSM being 6.47, 5.43 and 6.73 for the RFR, RFP and EF scores, respectively. 
Supportive study 20120297 in episodic migraine 
The results of the supportive study 20120297 in episodic migraine, using only the 70 mg dose vs placebo, 
showed efficacy results in line with the 70 mg dose in the pivotal EM study 20120296. 
Pooled data 
The pooled analysis of the 70 mg dose didn’t include the 140 mg dose. The results from the pooled efficacy 
analysis at 70 mg are consistent with the results at the 70 mg dose from the individual studies. 
Dose-response  
Based on early data during the development of AMG 334, the applicant planned to use the 70 mg dose as the 
therapeutic dose in the pivotal trials. This is why studies in the development were designed to test the 70 mg 
dose and not the 140 mg dose and the supportive study 20120297, originally planned to be one of two 
pivotal studies in episodic migraine, included only the 70 mg dose and not the 140 mg dose.   
However, the applicant has shown that for the majority of endpoints there is a numerically better effect from 
the 140 mg compared to the 70 mg dose in study 20120296 on episodic migraine. This difference was not so 
obvious when looking at the efficacy data from the 20120295 study.  
Additional data from the extensions of the CM and EM pivotal studies also show a numerically better effect of 
the 140 mg dose. In the extension study to 20120295, the 20130255 study, the results based on the last 
OLE dose showed numerically higher benefits for the 140 mg dose at week 52 with an additional reduction of 
-1.95 migraine days compared to the 70 mg dose. Likewise, in the active phase of study 20120296, the 
patients re-randomised to 140 mg showed a migraine day reduction of -0.68 vs the 70 mg dose. 
The treatment failure subgroups also show a numerically better treatment effect for the 140 mg dose 
compared to the 70 mg dose. 
Assessment report

The pharmacometrics analysis of the exposure-response modeling of the data also show a more clear 
exposure-response relation for the episodic migraine study 20120296 whereas this relation was not so 
obvious in the chronic migraine study (Study 20120295). There was an incremental reduction in monthly 
migraine days for AMG 334-treated subjects with Cmin at week 12 above a serum concentration of 4.12 
μg/mL (corresponding to the lower Cmin quartile at 70 mg QM). While 25% of patients at 70 mg fall below 
this level, only 3% of subjects in the 140 mg groups fell below this exposure. A higher dose than 140 mg has 
not been tested in any of the main studies, but the exposure-response model predicts that the response 
reaches a plateau at approximately 8.15 µg/mL for the episodic migraine population. The week 12 trough 
AMG 334 mean concentrations were around 13 µg/mL for the 140 mg dose, whereas they were around 6 
µg/mL for the 70 mg dose.  
Additional exposure-response modelling showed that the MMD% change from baseline was around -29% in 
the <4.12ug/mL Cmin exposure subgroup compared to around -37% in the ≥4.12 ug/mL Cmin subgroup. 
There is also a trend for exposure-response for daily migraine change for all subgroups except for the 
treatment-naïve subgroup in the CM study. 
Given the two alternatives (70 mg or 140 mg) for a single therapeutic dose to be used for all weight groups, 
the 140 mg dose is deemed the most appropriate since the 70 mg dose resulted in more subjects falling 
below the threshold exposure (4.12 ug/mL).  
Studies were not designed to show differences between the 2 doses. Though some exploratory analyses show 
numerically higher response levels for the 140 mg dose compared to 70 mg dose, the clinical relevance of 
these differences in terms of number of monthly migraine days is questionable. Regarding the differential in 
responder rates, the results come from open-label phases of trials where doses were not randomly allocated, 
therefore causality of these differences is difficult to decipher. Taking into account that erenumab has a 
significant efficacy at low dose (70 mg) compared to the placebo what comes out from these observation is 
mainly that the high dose could be as an alternative in some patients, including patients for whom the low 
dose lacks of efficacy. Moreover, it should be taken into account that (until the applicant has developed the 
140 mg injection pen) 2 injections are necessary for a 140 mg dose and that the more frequent adverse 
event were site injections reactions. Thus, the 70 mg dose has been proposed. Some patients may benefit 
from the 140 mg dose.  
Time-dependence 
A highly significant effect on migraine days was seen already at the week 4 evaluation in the EM study 
20120296. In addition, post-hoc analyses including exposure-response modeling suggested that daily 
migraine rates start differing from placebo already 4 days (140 mg dose) and 6 days (70 mg dose) after the 
first injection. These data should be interpreted with caution, since they are based on post-hoc analyses. 
It is noted that the significant effect numerically improved from week 4 to week 12, after which it appeared 
to be more or less stable. A trial period of 3 months for a new prophylactic medication for migraine is within 
the lines of recommendations of migraine treatment guidelines. The frequency and intensity of migraine 
attacks normally varies over the months, at least partly related to the circumstances of life of the subject. 
The applicant has proposed to include a recommendation in the SmPC to evaluate the efficacy of erenumab 
after 3 months’ treatment, which is in line with the clinical praxis and treatment guidelines and also 
supported by the study data, showing that full effect is achieved after 3 months treatment. The applicant’s 
proposal to refer to “clinical benefit” in the label statement is endorsed, since each individual migraine patient 
may display a unique response patterns in terms of effects on various endpoints and the evaluation of effect 
should be based on the physician’s interpretation of the total effect of treatment benefit for the patient.

Monthly efficacy data from EM study 20120296 on change from baseline in monthly migraine days show that 
the treatment effect is stable and maintained during the whole study period. Interestingly, from week 12 and 
onwards, also the placebo effect was maintained until week 24, both for the primary endpoint and the 
proportion of 50% responders. Generally, the placebo effect has been claimed to appear quite fast and not to 
be maintained for extended periods, although this belief was recently questioned by Khan et al, showing a 
persistence of the placebo response in the majority of major depression (MDD) patients when placebo 
treatment was continued in placebo responders for at least 12 weeks after the main study phase of 6-8 
weeks (Khan et al, The persistence of the placebo response in antidepressant clinical trials, Journal of 
Psychiatric Research 42, 791–796 (2008). 
The interim analysis from supportive study 20120178 showed that the treatment effect persisted in open-
label treatment at 70 mg for up to 64 weeks. Among the 27.9% who discontinued open-label treatment, the 
most common reasons were subject request (14.1%), Adverse event (3.7%), and an equal number of 
subjects who were lost to follow up and had lack of efficacy  (2.9% each). Among the 14.1% subjects who 
requested to discontinue treatment, lack of efficacy or adverse events could be masked. Thus, the apparent 
improved efficacy over long-term treatment may be an effect of gradual selection over time of subjects who 
respond well to treatment. 
It is acknowledged that the applicant has not studied planned discontinuation of the prophylactic treatment, 
but since the severity of migraine varies over the years, sooner or later the patient will not need prophylactic 
treatment anymore. The applicant states that there is no clinical data to support a gradual prolongation of 
treatment intervals, since this would prolong the periods of serum exposures below the efficacy threshold of 
a serum concentration of 4.12 µg/mL for the patients. In contrast, erenumab has been stopped at once 
without prolongation of the intervals throughout the clinical development programme. No exacerbation or 
rebound effect was seen after stopping erenumab treatment. Thus, the sponsor does not propose any specific 
recommendations as to how to stop the drug and the CHMP concurs with the applicant that neither specific 
recommendations on the frequency of re-evaluation of efficacy nor exact recommendation on how to stop 
treatment is needed in the SmPC.  
Subgroup analyses 
The apparent worse outcome for non-white subjects in the EM study seems to be related to a high placebo 
response in this subgroup and the wide CI due to the low number of subjects. In the CM study, this tendency 
for worse outcome in non-whites was not seen. On the contrary, the non-white subgroup had a better point 
estimate than the other subgroups. 
The data across the pivotal studies suggest that there is no difference in treatment effect across the 
demographic and baseline characteristic subgroup. Subgroup analysis performed by region was done 
comparing North America (US-Canada) versus other regions (this group included Turkey). Nevertheless, 
Turkish subjects made up a small fraction of the "other region" cohort and should not significantly change the 
treatment effect if removed from that very cohort. 
In the EM study, the 70 mg dose was clearly less effective in men, and the 140 mg dose was somewhat less 
effective in men. In patients with a BMI ≥median, both doses were less effective than in the overall 
population. These findings were partly reflected in the subgroup analyses for the CM study, where the 70 mg 
dose was less effective in men, but no difference was seen for BMI ≥median. In addition, the plasma 
concentration was lower in heavier patients. However, There was no clear trend for an effect by body-weight 
on reduction of MMD. The difference in dose-effect between low-weight and high-weight subjects could rather 
be explained by other confounding factors, including a higher placebo response, than lower efficacy due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 68/104 
  
  
lower exposure in these subgroups. In conclusion, there is no need to administer a higher dose than 140 mg 
in subjects weighting >100 kg. However, if the selected therapeutic dose would be 70 mg, there might be a 
need for dose adjustment for subjects weighting >100 kg. 
The treatment failure subgroups showed a higher treatment effect compared to the overall study population, 
driven by a lower placebo response in those who had previously failed treatment. Patients who had not failed 
previous treatment showed a higher placebo response, but the absolute response to treatment was similar in 
the non-failed groups compared to the treatment failure groups. 
Results indicate that AMG 334 was efficacious in patients previously exposed to migraine prophylactic 
treatments, with greater benefit, particularly for the 140 mg dose, in patients who had failed prior 
prophylactic treatment. The treatment effect for AMG 334 at both doses was generally lower for the subgroup 
who never failed prior prophylactic treatment (either prophylactic naïve or tried prophylactic therapy without 
failing), driven by a higher placebo response in these patients. 
Medication-overuse headache (MO headache) is defined by the International Classification of Headache 
Disorders as a headache in patients with a pre-existing primary headache disorder that occurs on >=15 days 
per month for >3 months, and is caused by overuse of medication intended for acute or symptomatic 
headache treatment. The prevalence of MO headache in the general population is around 1%, but the 
condition is much more common in people with headache, in particular chronic migraine. 
MO headache has been considered difficult to treat/refractory to prophylactic treatment and the only 
recommended treatment option used to be detoxification of acute migraine medication, followed by a switch 
to a “non-toxic” headache therapy. However, in recent years, the recommendations have switched to include 
an early initiation of a prophylaxis for chronic migraine (botulinum toxin or topiramate) parallel to 
detoxification of medications that have been overused and patient education (Diener et al. Nat Rev Neurol., 
2016 Oct;12(10):575-83, Diener, Cephalalgia. 2012 Apr;32(5):423-7).This view is now further supported by 
the results from the present CM study, showing even stronger efficacy results for the subgroup with 
medication overuse. 
Immunogenicity 
The incidence of subjects developing anti-AMG 334 antibodies during the double-blind phase was 6.3% for 
the 70-mg dose (3 of which had in vitro neutralizing activity), and 2.6% for the 140-mg dose (none of which 
had in vitro neutralizing activity). Thus, it appears that development of ADA was not dose-dependent, in fact 
the data could even indicate a higher percentage of ADA at the lower dose (70 mg). The applicant suggested 
different explanations for this apparent inverse dose-relation for ADAs, either a dose-dependent reduction in 
immunogenicity or limitations of the bioanalytical methods at higher dose levels or just a numerical 
difference. This will be further analysed from ADA data arising in the ongoing open label extension studies. 
Since the applicant agreed to include the information on the higher incidence of ADA at the 70 mg dose in the 
SmPC, the physicians and patients are informed that the incidence of ADA may be higher than the 2.6% 
reported for the 140 mg dose. 
Binding ADAs appeared not to affect efficacy of AMG334, whereas the number of neutralising ADAs was very 
low, precluding a firm conclusion on potential effect on efficacy of the antibody medication AMG334.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The studies were mostly designed in agreement with recommendations in international guidelines on clinical 
trials in migraine. All main efficacy endpoints were significant throughout the main clinical studies.  
To  migraine  patients,  it  is  ultimately  the  total  effect  on  the  disease  burden  that  counts,  which  is  often  a 
combination  of  reduction  of  number  of  migraine  days,  reduction  of  pain  intensity,  reduction  of  the  need  to 
take acute migraine medication to abort attacks and ultimately all these effects taken together will result in a 
better  quality  of  life,  perceived  as  better  ability  to  perform  activities  of  daily  life,  and  lower  absence  from 
work due to migraine attacks.  
Since  all  these  relevant  outcomes  have  been  included  in the  main  studies  and  the effects  are  significant  on 
almost  all  main  study  endpoints,  there  is  evidence  that  AMG  334  has  a  clinically  relevant  effect  in  both 
chronic  and  episodic  migraine.  In  addition,  AMG  334  is  also  effective  in  chronic  migraine  patients  fulfilling 
criteria  for  medication  overuse  headache  and  patients  who  have  failed  at  least  1  or  2  previous  migraine 
prophylactic treatments. The clinical relevance of the overall efficacy results was supported by literature. The 
results  are  in  line  with  results  from  migraine  prophylaxis  studies  with  approved  migraine  prophylactic 
treatments with well-designed pivotal studies, i.e. topiramate and Botox.  
The  mean  difference  in  migraine  days  compared  to  placebo  may  not  appear  so  impressive.  However,  the 
responder rate may be more relevant and easy to grasp to the patients. Studies were not designed to show 
differences between the 2 doses. Though some exploratory analyses show numerically higher response levels 
for the 140 mg dose compared to 70 mg dose, the clinical relevance of these differences in terms of number 
of  monthly  migraine  days  is  questionable.  Regarding  the  differential  in  responder  rates,  the  results  come 
from  open  label  phases  of  trials  where  doses  were  not  randomly  allocated,  therefore  causality  of  these 
differences  is  difficult  to  decipher.  Taking  into  account  that  erenumab  has  a  significant  efficacy  at  low  dose 
(70 mg) compared to the placebo what comes out from these observation is mainly that the high dose could 
be as an alternative in some patients, including those for whom the low dose lacks of efficacy. Thus, the 70 
mg dose has been introduced in addition to 140 mg. 
Patient exposure 
Up to May 2017, a total of 3311 subjects participated in the AMG334 clinical development program (includes 
studies 20120178, 20120295/20130255, 20120296, 20120297, 2020267 part A, 20101268 part A, 
20120130, 20140255, 20140477, 20150149 and 20150334).  Of these subjects, 3150 have been exposed to 
at least 1 dose of AMG 334. The majority of subjects were enrolled in Phase 2/3 EM or CM studies.  
Overall, the primary safety population (which is also the integrated safety population of Studies 20120178, 
20120295, 20130255, 20120296 and 20120297) was comprised of 2537 subjects (2591.3 SY of exposure) 
have been exposed to at least 1 dose of AMG 334: 2128 subjects (1787.6 SY of exposure) have been 
exposed to 70 mg at any time and 1223 subjects have been exposed to 140 mg (755.8 SY of exposure) at 
any time.  Of these patients, 1451 first received AMG 334 in placebo-controlled phases of clinical trials, while 
924 were initially randomized to placebo and first received AMG 334 in the open-label phases.  
The integrated analyses were based on subjects’ data from the double-blind treatment period through the 
primary analysis database cut-off date (20120295 and 20120297) or from pre-specified interim analysis data 
cut-off dates (20130255, 20120178, and 201201296) for the open-label extension or the active treatment 
phases.

Four data pools were derived from the integrated safety data set:  
Pool A, a 12-week pool consists of data collected in the double blind, placebo-controlled phases of the 
studies;   
Pool B, a 24-week pool consists of data collected in the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of study 
20120296;  
Pool C, longer-term safety data across the entire spectrum of exposure (double-blind treatment period 
and/or open-label extension/active treatment period) for patients who received at least 1 dose of AMG 334 
70 mg, 140 mg or both until the patient’s end of study or the date of data cut-off;  
Pool D, a subset of Pool C and comprises patients who have received at least 1 dose of AMG 334 70 mg, 140 
mg or both continuously over a minimum period of 1 year. 
In addition, data for modified Pool C and Pool D (called Pool E and Pool F, respectively) was also provided: 
Pool E, a subset of Pool C where subjects have continuous exposure to only one dose level of erenumab and 
were never exposed to another dose level of erenumab previously. 
Pool F, a subset of Pool D where subjects have continuous exposure to only one continued dose level of 
erenumab for at least one year and were never exposed to another dose level of erenumab previously. 
Overall, 2451 subjects (96.6%) were exposed to AMG 334 for ≥  3 months, 2280 subjects (89.9%) were 
exposed to AMG 334 for ≥  6 months, 1320 subjects (52.0%) were exposed to AMG 334 for ≥  12 months, 
and 291 subjects (11.5%) were exposed to AMG 334 for ≥  18 months. A total of 707 (27.9%) had 
continuous exposure to 70 mg for ≥  12 months and 176 (6.9%) had continuous exposure to 140 mg for ≥  
12 months. A total of 1305 (51.4%) subjects had continuous exposure to 70 mg and/or 140 mg for ≥  12 
months. A total of 465 patients were treated with 140 mg for at least 6 months without prior exposure to 
other active doses. Of these, 158 patients were treated with 140 mg for at least 12 months without prior 
exposure to other doses.

Patients in the 70 mg and/or 140 mg received either 70 mg, 140 mg or a combination of both doses. 
Duration of exposure is defined as: ≥3 months - patients receiving week 8 dose or later; ≥6 months - patients receiving week 20 dose or later; ≥12 months - 
patients receiving week 48 dose or later and ≥18 months - patients receiving week 72 dose or later.

The majority of subjects completed the scheduled number of doses. The mean (SD) cumulative duration of 
exposure to any dose of AMG 334 was 53.3 (39.7) weeks. For each subject, the duration of exposure to AMG 
334 is the sum of the duration of exposure (from first administration to last administration +28 days) from 
each individual study phase or study that the subject participated in. It is noted that continuous exposure 
was determined by length of exposure at any dose level.   
Differences in rates between the AMG 334 doses should be interpreted with caution in Pool C and D as 
patients could have switched between 2 different dose levels in different sequences. In these data pool, AMG 
334 long-term safety is shown for each dose level within the period during which the change in dose 
occurred. The safety data in Pool C, as well as Pool D (below), should be interpreted in the context of the 
total data for 70 mg and 140 mg.  
Example dosing scenarios for subject receiving AMG 334 at open-label extension/Active Treatment Phase are 
presented in the Figure below. 
Figure 2. Example Dosing Scenarios for Subject Receiving AMG 334 Through Open-label 
Extension/Active Treatment Phase 
In addition to the examples presented, subgroups of patients switched from placebo (Study 20120295, 
20120296, 20120297 and 20120178) or AMG 334 7mg/21mg (study 20120178) during the double blind 
controlled phase to AMG334 70mg or 140mg during the open-label extension/active treatment period are 
also included in the Pool C or pool D data set.

The mean (SD) age of subjects was 41.5 (11.2) years, with age range between 18-66 years old. No patient 
older than 66 years old was included in the studies. The majority of subjects were female (83.8%) and White 
(91.0%).   
Almost all subjects used acute headache medications (97.9%), and approximately 2/3 of subjects used acute 
migraine-specific medications (65.7%) during the baseline period. Slightly more than half of subjects had 
previously or concurrently been treated with a prophylactic migraine medication (52.4%), and almost half of 
subjects reported prior migraine prophylactic treatment failure due to lack of efficacy and/or poor tolerability 
(45.8%). Overall, Migraine disease characteristics were similar across the treatment groups.  More Migraine 
without aura subjects was included in the studies (approximately two times more than Migraine with aura 
subjects in each respective group). 
Migraine is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. A limited number of patients with a 
medical history of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease were included in the clinical 
studies.  Patients with a recent major cardiovascular event (i.e., myocardial infarction, stroke, transient 
ischemic attack, unstable angina, or coronary artery bypass surgery, or other revascularization procedure 
within 12 months prior to screening) were excluded. A total of 13 subjects (0.5%) reported a vascular 
medical history: 3 of the 13 subjects (0.1%) had coronary artery disease and 11 (0.4%) had cerebrovascular 
or peripheral arterial disease. Of these 13 subjects, only 5 subjects were received AMG 334 70mg or 140mg.

The applicant stated that overall, 511 subjects (49.0%) in the placebo group had at least 1 adverse event. A 
total of 422 subjects (47.3%) in the 70 mg group and 233 subjects (46.0%) in the 140 mg group had 
adverse events.  
Incidence of Adverse events leading to discontinuation of investigational product was 2 times higher in AMG 
334 treatment group than placebo (1.0% in the placebo group, 1.7% in the 70 mg group, and 2.0%) of 
subjects in the 140 mg group in Pool A. No significant trends are observed with respect to SAE, and Severity 
of the AEs. No death was reported.    
During the 12-week, placebo-controlled period, the most common occurring AEs (≥ 2.0%) overall were 
Nasopharyngitis (5.5%-7.5%), Upper respiratory tract infection (1.4%-4.5%), Injection site pain (0.9%-
3.7%), Fatigue (1.7%-3.3%), Nausea (1.9%-2.6%). No significant trends were observed between the 
placebo and active treated groups. 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred in ≥ 1% of patients in either 
AMG 334 70 mg or 140 mg group and ≥ 2 times the rate of the placebo group are presented in the table 
below. The AEs could be considered related to AMG 334 treatment if there is a possible biological plausibility 
based on MOA. Since the frequency of AE report rate was generally low, other consideration such as dose-
response trend and pattern in time-to-onset might not appear significant. Except injection site pain, other 
AEs including Constipation, Injection site erythema, Bronchitis, Muscle spasms and Pruritus generalized 
showed some degree of dose dependent increase (70mg vs 140mg groups, Table 20).

Overall, the overall incidence of AEs of adverse events, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were higher 
in Pool B (24 weeks) compared to Pool A (12 weeks), but similar across placebo, 70 mg, and 140 mg dose 
groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events that occurred ≥  1% patients in either AMG 334 70 mg or 140 
mg group and ≥  2 x the rate in the placebo group include: constipation, injection site pain, injection site 
erythema, bronchitis and gastroenteritis viral. Viral gastroenteritis was reported for 0.0%, 1.3%, and 1.6% of 
subjects in the placebo, 70 mg and 140 mg groups, respectively. One of the gastroenteritis viral events was 
reported as serious for 1 subject in 140mg. There were also gastroenteritis adverse events reported for 
1.6%, 1.0%, and 0.9% of subjects in the placebo, 70 mg and, 140 mg groups, respectively. It is noted that

Overall, 71.7% of subjects (151.7per 100 SY) in Pool C had at least 1 adverse event and adverse event rates 
were generally balanced across the AMG 70mg and 140mg doses. The exposure-adjusted subject incidence 
rates (per 100 SY) of adverse events were 158.9 and 147.0 for the 70 mg and 140 mg doses, respectively. 
The majority of adverse events were reported as grade 1 or grade 2. The exposure-adjusted subject 
incidence rates (per 100 SY) of adverse events were 159.0 and 152.8 for the 70 mg and 140 mg doses, 
respectively.  
17 frequently occurring adverse events as defined ≥ 2 per 100 SY exposures are reported. Of the frequently 
occurring events, viral upper respiratory tract infection and upper respiratory tract infection were the only 
events reported at an exposure-adjusted subject incidence rate of > 5 per 100 SY (All AMG 334) in the 120-
day Safety Update, and the rates were similar between the 70 mg and 140 mg doses. The common adverse 
event preferred term were similar to those observed in Pool A and B. There are few AEs reported more 
frequent in Pool C than in Pool A or B.  
No significant trends were observed with respect to the serious adverse events, Adverse events leading to 
discontinuation and death in AMG 334 70mg and 140mg groups.

Pool E 
Events with exposure-adjusted incidence rate differences where the 140mg group exceeded the 70mg group 
by>1.0 per 100 include the following terms (and magnitude of incidence rate difference per 100 SY): 
constipation (3.7), muscle spasms (2.2), injection site erythema (2.2), sinusitis (2.0), pruritus generalized 
(1.4), fatigue (1.3) and nausea (1.2). These trends are generally similar to the dose response trends 
obtained from the 12-week placebo controlled data there is no dose response trend noted for sinusitis 
(combined preferred terms (PT) sinusitis, chronic sinusitis, acute sinusitis) in the placebo, 70mg and 140mg 
groups with percentages of 1.8, 1.6 and 2.0. There is also no dose response trend noted for nausea in the 
12-week placebo controlled data as TEAE percentages in the placebo, 70mg and 140mg groups are 2.6, 2.4 
and 2.0 respectively. Fatigue also did not have a dose response pattern in the 12-week placebo controlled 
data. Of note is hypertension appeared in the exposure adjusted rates of most frequently reported adverse 
event table (below) for Pool E, but hypertension has not been included in the similar table for =Pool C 
(above). However, it is noted that pattern of subject incidence rate of Hypertension in Pool E for both 70mg 
(2.3) and 140mg (1.6) groups is quite similar to that reported in Pool C, 70mg (2.0) and 140mg (1.5).

AMG 334 70 mg died due to fatal AEs of arteriosclerosis and hypertensive heart disease. The second Subject 
received AMG 334 140 mg died due to heart failure associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular 
dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (diagnosed post mortem). According to the investigator, both events were not 
related to investigational product. 
Serious adverse events 
Pool A: During the 12-week placebo-controlled period, serious adverse events were reported for 16 of 1043 
subjects (1.5%) in the placebo group, 15 of 893 subjects (1.7%) in the 70 mg group, and 5 of 507 subjects 
(1.0%) in the 140 mg group.  
In the AMG 334 70 mg group, cholelithiasis, intervertebral disc protrusion and migraine were reported. In the 
AMG 334 140 mg group, 5 (1.0%) subjects experienced 10 SAEs. None of these SAEs were occurred more 
than 1 subject.

Preferred terms are sorted in descending frequency of the All AMG 334 column. 
Pool B: Incidence of serious adverse events in Pool B were slightly higher than in Pool A, but were similar 
across the placebo(2.2%), 70 mg (2.5%), and 140 mg (1.9%) dose groups. Cholelithiasis was the only 
serious adverse event to be reported for > 1 subject in the 70 mg group (2 subjects, 0.6%); 1 subject had a 
history of cholecystolithiasis and renal stones. Of note, of the 3 subjects in the 140 mg dose group who 
reported a serious adverse event in the Infections and infestations disorders system organ class (SOC), 1 
subject (29666041004) reported multiple serious adverse events (clostridium difficile colitis, kidney infection, 
pyelonephritis, and sepsis). This subject also had a medical history of recurrent urinary tract infections and 
recurrent pyelonephritis. 
Pool C, The exposure-adjusted incidence rates (per 100 SY) of serious adverse events were 4.3 and 4.6 for 
the 70 mg and 140 mg doses, respectively which is higher than that of in Pool A and B. 
The most frequent SAEs reported with a rate of 0.2 per 100 patient-years receiving any dose of AMG 334 (All 
AMG 334) were migraine, uterine leiomyoma, non-cardiac chest pain, intervertebral disc protrusion, syncope, 
depression and appendicitis. The applicant’s review of all serious adverse events did not identify any signals 
or trends that would suggest a potential safety concern. A review of individual serious adverse events found 
that the majority were either confounded and/or can be reasonably anticipated in the treatment population.

There were 3 subjects receiving 70 mg and 1 subject receiving 140 mg who had non-cardiac chest pain. In all 
of these cases, thorough cardiovascular evaluations were carried out and a cardiovascular aetiology was ruled 
out by the applicant. These cases were also reviewed by the independent Cardiovascular Events Committee 
and adjudicated as non-cardiac events. 
It is noted that “Musculoskeletal chest pain” and “Chest pain” were also reported, none of these were 
reported as SAE. 
The overall SAE profile in Pool D were similar to that of Pool C, with no new trends observed in SAEs among 
patients with longer exposure.  
Laboratory findings 
Blood creatine phosphokinase increased 
Blood creatine phosphokinase increased were reported in 3 subjects (2 in placebo, 1 in AMG 334 70mg) at 
baseline and 2 subjects (in AMG 70 mg and 140 mg each) in 12 weeks double blinded study phase in which, 
Grade 4 adverse event of increased blood creatinine phosphokinase was reported in one subject receiving 
140mg AMG 334. Blood creatine phosphokinase increased was reported in 17 subjects (0.7%) in Pool C, in 
which Grade 4 adverse event of increased blood creatinine phosphokinase was reported in two subjects 
receiving 140mg AMG 334. The applicant has reviewed the individual adverse events of increased blood 
creatine phosphokinase and concluded these were isolated events with no association to cardiac injury.  
Blood creatine phosphokinase MB increased was reported in 1 subject receiving 70 mg. This event was of 
grade 2 severity, non-serious, and assessed as not related to investigational product by the applicant. CPK-
MB has been used as a cardiac marker to assist diagnoses of an acute myocardial infarction.

Creatine Kinase lab findings 
Creatine kinase was the most frequently reported Grade ≥3 (≥4) lab toxicities post-baseline and the 
frequencies of these were slight different across treatment groups with numerally few more subjects reported 
in AMG 334 70mg/140mg group during 12 week double blinded study phase. The summary of Creatine 
kinase lab toxicity (Grade 3 and 4) in the Pool A is presented in the table below: 
Table 25 
Grade ≥4 post-baseline levels of creatine kinase levels were reported for 1 subject (0.1%) in the placebo 
group, 3 subjects (0.4%) in the 70mg and 2 subjects (0.4%) in Pool A in the 140mg group. In pool B Grade 
≥4 post-baseline levels of creatine kinase levels were reported in placebo, AMG 334 70mg, 140mg as 0%, 
0.6%(2 subjects) and 0.9% (3 subjects), respectively. Grade ≥4 post-baseline levels of creatine kinase levels 
were reported for 5 subjects (0.3%) receiving 70mg and 3 subjects (0.4%) receiving 140mg, there are no 
clear pattern observed during the >12 month period in Pool C.  
Based on the assessment of all grade 3 or 4 CK elevation in updated Pool C, there were a total of 73 subjects 
who had grade 3 or 4 CK elevation in the studies including 14 at the baseline. There was not an apparent 
pattern in time to onset of these CK elevations. No patients with grade 3 or grade 4 CK elevation had other 
laboratory abnormalities > grade 1, except for one subject who had grade 3 AST increase. There were no 
abnormal laboratory values including creatinine, BUN and estimated glomerular filtration rate to indicate any 
potential kidney injury in these patients. No myoglobin in serum or urine was reported. 
Of the 73 subjects, 11 reported mild or moderate musculoskeletal symptoms. There were no cardiac events 
reported in any of these subjects. Physical activity appears to be a confounder in most patients.  
The applicant’s review of safety data in the subjects with grade 3 or grade 4 CK elevations did not reveal a 
safety signal related to cardiac disorder, hepatic disorder, rhabdomyolysis, renal impairment or any other 
safety concern. The available data does not support a causal relationship between CK elevations and 
treatment with erenumab.

Safety in special populations 
The safety of AMG 334 was evaluated in various subpopulations. The intrinsic factors subject to review 
included the following: gender, age, race and Chronic migraine vs Episodic Migraine. In addition, the extrinsic 
factor, geographic region and treatment Failure of Prophylactic Migraine Medication were examined.  
In Pool A, 68 men (39.1%) and 443 women (51.0%) receiving placebo reported adverse events. In subjects 
receiving AMG 334 (All AMG 334), 99 men (38.8%) and 665 women (49.0%) reported adverse events. The 
incidence of adverse events was lower in every treatment group for men compared to women; however, the 
incidence of adverse events in women was consistent with the overall population (49.0% of subjects 
receiving placebo; 47.4% of subjects receiving AMG 334). The most frequently reported adverse event in 
both subgroups was nasopharyngitis, which was reported for 9.8% of men and 6.8% of women receiving 
placebo, and 3.9% of men and 6.4% of women receiving AMG 334 (All AMG 334). In general, the incidence 
of serious adverse events in both sexes is consistent with the overall population (1.5% in subjects receiving 
placebo; 1.3% in subjects receiving AMG 334). 
In Pool A, 39.0% and 45.2% of subjects with chronic migraine receiving placebo or receiving AMG 334 (All 
AMG 334) reported adverse events, respectively. 52.7% and 48.0% of episodic migraine subjects receiving 
placebo or receiving AMG 334 reported adverse events, respectively. No clear trends were observed with 
respect to serious adverse events between the chronic migraine and episodic migraine subgroup or placebo. 
Selected adverse events by chronic vs episodic migraine for Pool A are presented in the table below:

Based on the data submitted, the incidence of the possible related AEs such as constipation, injection site 
erythema, muscle spasms and AEs under cardiac disorder SOC were higher in CM subject groups than EM 
subject groups (e.g. Constipation:4.3% in CM 140mg group and 2.3% in EM 140mg group; Injection site 
erythema: 3.2% in CM 140mg group and 1.3% in EM 140mg group; Muscle spasms 3.7% in CM 140mg 
group and 0.9% in EM 140mg group; Cardiac disorder AEs: 2.1% in CM 140mg group and 0.9% in EM 
140mg group).  
Subgroup analysis by median age (<42.00 years and ≥42.0 years) using Pool A showed that the incidence of 
AEs were similar between respective age groups. 252 subjects < median age (50.5%) and 259 subjects ≥  
median age (47.6%) receiving placebo reported adverse events. In subjects receiving AMG 334 (All AMG 
334), 372 subjects < median age (49.2%) and 392 subjects ≥  median age (45.7%) reported adverse 
events. Data for elderly populations are not available. 
Given unbalanced races with white (>90% of the integrated safety dataset) and non white enrolled in the 
studies, no meaningful subgroup comparisons regards this aspect could be performed.  
In general, there was no difference in the incidence of adverse events by region (North America, Other). In 
Pool A, the incidence of adverse events in North American subjects was 45.4% in subjects receiving placebo 
and 45.9% in subjects receiving AMG 334. In North American subjects, upper respiratory tract infection was 
the most frequently reported event in the placebo group (4.8%) and the AMG 334 treatment groups (5.5%).  
In general, the incidence of adverse events in the treatment failed to prophylactic migraine medication group 
was slightly higher than that in the treatment not failed to prophylactic migraine medication group. No 
notable imbalance between placebo and the active treated groups were observed.  Selected adverse events 
by treatment failure of prophylactic migraine for Pool A provided by the applicant are presented in the table 
below:

Medication – Pool A (Integrated Safety Analysis Set)  
The elimination of AMG 334 is not affected by renal or hepatic function. No dose adjustment is deemed 
necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

Among the possibly related AEs, constipation and muscle spasms seem more frequently reported in CM than 
that in EM in 140mg group based on the Pool F data. Overall, the cardiovascular AE profile is comparable 
between CM and EM. Of note is the exposure-adjusted subject incidence rate for hypertension in CM is 
numerically higher in 140 mg (4.8%) than that in 70 mg (2.8%) (Pool F). The incidence rate for hypertension 
in 140mg in CM is also higher than that in EM (Pool F). Since only few subjects have reported hypertension in 
140mg groups, a clear dose dependency trend for hypertension in CM cannot be made. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Pool A: During the first 12 weeks of double-blind treatment (Pool A), the overall incidence of AEs leading to 
discontinuation was 1.0%, 1.7% and 2.0 % in the placebo, AMG 334 70mg and 140mg groups, respectively. 
Most AEs that led to discontinuation were reported in 1 subject at each AMG 334 dose group with the 
exception of arthralgia which were reported in 70 mg only. There were 2 events of palpitations resulted in the 
discontinuation were both in AMG 334 dose group. There are other confounding factors such as underlying 
cardiovascular risk factors and concomitant medication could contribute to the events. Two patients 
discontinued due to an SAE: 1 patient in the placebo group (hypersensitivity) and 1 patient in the 140 mg 
group (vestibular neuronitis).

Pool B: the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was reported as 2.5%, 2.2% and 3.1% for placebo, 
AMG 70mg and 140 mg, respectively. The majority of AEs that led to discontinuation were single events. The 
only AEs that occurred in > 1 patient were palpitations (2 patients; 1 in each of the 70 mg and 140 mg dose 
groups), vertigo positional (2 patients; 1 in each of the 70 mg and 140 mg dose groups) and arthralgia (2 
patients, both in the 70 mg group); all of which are described above for Pool A. 
Pool C: The overall exposure-adjusted incidence rate of AEs leading to discontinuation was 2.8 and 3.2 per 
100 SY in patients receiving 70 mg and 140 mg, respectively. AEs leading to discontinuation in > 3 patients 
with a rate of 0.1 per 100 pateitn-years were migraine, positional vertigo, nausea, fatigue, arthralgia, 
depression and hypertension.  These events occurred with comparable distribution between the 70 mg and

mg group only. Serious adverse events leading to discontinuation of investigational product were reported for 
13 of 2128 subjects receiving 70 mg  (0.6 per 100 SY)and 4 of 1223 subjects (0.4 per 100 SY) receiving 140 
mg. It is noted that the most frequently occurring serious adverse events leading to discontinuation of 
investigational product were associated with the SOC of Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified and 
included papillary thyroid cancer (2 subject), breast cancer (1 subject), invasive lobular breast carcinoma (1 
subject), breast fibroma (1 subject), and lung adenocarcinoma stage III(1 subject). None of these events 
were considered related to investigational product by the investigator. 
Pool E: In the percentage rates of discontinuation due to an adverse event is balanced between the 70mg 
and 140mg groups at 2.9% and 2.7% respectively. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates are 3.1 per 100 SY 
and 4.1 per 100 SY for the 70mg and 140mg groups. The most frequent reasons for discontinuation due to 
an AE, occurring in 0.1% of subjects or higher, are migraine, arthralgia, palpitation and hypertension.

2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Overall, the primary safety population was comprised of 2537 subjects exposed to at least 1 dose of AMG 
334: 2128 subjects (1787.6 SY of exposure) who have been exposed to 70 mg at any time and 1223 
subjects who have been exposed to 140 mg (755.8 SY of exposure) at any time. Of these patients, 1451 first

received AMG 334 in placebo-controlled phases of clinical trials, while 924 were initially randomized to 
placebo and first received AMG 334 in the open-label phases. 
Four data pools were derived from the integrated safety data set: Pool A,  a 12-week pool consists of data 
collected in the double blind, placebo-controlled phases of the studies;  Pool B, a 24-week pool consists of 
data collected in the double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of study 20120296; Pool C, longer-term safety 
data across the entire spectrum of exposure (double-blind treatment period and/or open-label 
extension/active treatment period) for patients who received at least 1 dose of AMG 334 70 mg, 140 mg or 
both until the patient’s end of study or the date of data cut-off; Pool D, a subset of Pool C and comprises 
patients who have received at least 1 dose of AMG 334 70 mg, 140 mg or both continuously over a minimum 
period of 1 year. It is noted that except of study 20120297 whereas only 70mg was studied, approximately 
50-70% patients who received AMG 334 in the studies have switched doses from 70mg to 140mg or vice 
versa. In addition, a subset of Pool C where subjects have continuous exposure to only one dose level of 
erenumab and were never exposed to another dose level of erenumab previously and a subset of Pool D 
where subjects have continuous exposure to only one continued dose level of erenumab for at least one year 
and were never exposed to another dose level of erenumab previously were also provided in Pool E and F, 
respectively. 
Overall, 2451 subjects (96.6%) were exposed to AMG 334 for ≥  3 months, 2280 subjects (89.9%) were 
exposed to AMG 334 for ≥  6 months, 1320 subjects (52.0%) were exposed to AMG 334 for ≥  12 months, 
and 291 subjects (11.5%) were exposed to AMG 334 for ≥  18 months. A total of 707 (27.9%) had 
continuous exposure to 70 mg for ≥  12 months and 176 (6.9%) had continuous exposure to 140 mg for ≥  
12 months. A total of 1305 (51.4%) subjects had continuous exposure to 70 mg and/or 140 mg for ≥  12 
months. A total of 465 patients were treated with 140 mg for at least 6 months without prior exposure to 
other active doses. Of these, 158 patients were treated with 140 mg for at least 12 months without prior 
exposure to other doses. 
There are possible differences in medical history, concomitant medications and comorbidities and AE profile 
between the CM and EM populations were also reviewed. The date showed that the baseline demographics 
and characteristics are generally comparable between the CM and EM pivotal studies. The mean and median 
age of the CM study population is slightly older than the EM study population. The percentages of subjects 
with a history of medical disease/condition at baseline and the patients used concomitant medications at 
baseline or during the double blind treatment were similar. 
Overall the pattern of the AE profiles observed for CM and EM are comparable. Of note is some of the related 
AEs (constipation and Muscle spasm) were more frequently reported in CM than EM in the 140mg, but this 
pattern was not appeared in the 70mg group. Considering these differences are small, these findings are 
considered not necessary to be reflected in the SmPC. Overall, the cardiovascular AE profile is comparable 
between CM and EM. Of note is the exposure-adjusted subject incidence rate for hypertension in CM is 
numerically higher in 140 mg (4.8%) than that in 70 mg (2.8%) (Pool F). Since only few subjects have 
reported hypertension in 140mg groups, a clear dose dependency trend for hypertension in CM cannot be 
made. 
The Applicant proposes the ongoing open-label extension study 20120178 – a Phase 2, Randomized, Double-
blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of erenumab in Migraine Prevention as the 
pharmacovigilance action for long-term safety. The study will collect 5-year data, with the LPLV estimated 
Q4, 2019, and final report therefore Q4, 2020. Currently there are 238 patients in the study.

Key safety findings 
Overall, baseline characteristics, baseline disease characteristics and patients with baseline cardiovascular 
risk factor were balanced across the placebo and treatment groups in the 12 weeks and 24 weeks controlled 
studies (Pool A and B). 
Based on 12 weeks placebo controlled studies, the incidence of AEs was comparable across all treatment 
groups in Pool A (47.4% for All AMG 334 group, 49.0% for placebo). The majority of AEs in all treatment 
groups were mild or moderate in severity. The rates of specific AEs were low (frequency of < 5%) with the 
exception of nasopharyngitis (6.0% for All AMG 334 group, 7.3% for placebo). The common AEs showing 
numerically higher rates for 140 mg are In ejection site reactions including Injection site pain and Injection 
site erythema, constipation, muscle spasm, generalized pruritus and bronchitis (Pool A) although the overall 
incidences were low (<5%). These events were generally mild or moderate in severity, none was serious and 
none led to discontinuation (except for a single case of constipation). All these AEs with exception of injection 
site pain also showed some degree of dose dependent increase (70mg vs 140mg groups). Adverse drug 
reactions for AMG 334 were basically selected by evaluating adverse events that occurred with a ≥ 1% 
overall incidence in AMG 334 70 mg or 140 mg group and ≥ 2 times the rate of the placebo group in the 
controlled study pools. In addition, a possible biological plausibility, dose-response trend or injection 
procedure are also been take into consideration. Currently, all AEs mentioned above are considered to be 
added in ADRs lists in the SmPC. 
The incidence of SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation in Pool A for AMG 334 was similar between the 140 
mg and 70 mg dose groups and also comparable to placebo. Overall, the rates of these events were low (≤ 
2%) in all treatment groups in Pool A.  
There are other safety findings considered important for further discussion: 
In the 12 and 24 week controlled studies (Pool A and B), Small differences across treatment groups for 
subjects with post baseline SBP > 160 mmHg were observed. In Pool A, the number of the subjects with post 
baseline SBP > 160 mmHg were 0.5%, 0.6% and <0.1% in AMG 334 70mg, 140mg and placebo group, 
respectively. The rate of the subjects with post baseline DBP >100 mmHg were 1.8%, 1.4% and 0.9%, in 
AMG 334 70mg, 140mg and placebo group, respectively. In addition, the numbers of the subjects with DBP 
increase from baseline ≥  10 mmHg with DBP ≤  90 mmHg measured at week 4, 8 and 12 were also higher in 
the AMG 334 treated groups (9.1-9.5% % in 140mg group, 6.9-7.8% in 70mg group) than in the placebo 
groups (5.6-7.1%). 
It is also noted that the numbers of the subjects with blood pressure changes from baseline between the 
various AMG 334 70 mg or 140 mg treatment periods appear to be unbalanced. There are some numeric 
imbalances observed in the updated pool results (long term safety data pools C, D, E and F). Focusing on the 
clinical relevant changes defined as increase from baseline of ≥ 10 mmHg in DBP and/or ≥ 20 mmHg SBP with 
DBP >90 mmHg and >140 mmHg SBP, respectively, the proportions  of subjects over time, for example, in Pool 
C appeared to be  increasing with the largest proportion  in the interval months > 24. This trend is supported by 
the observation in normotensive groups where a large proportion  of the subjects with data in the 140 mg 
group had blood pressure increase from baseline ≥  10 mmHg in DBP and/or ≥  20 mmHg in SBP with SBP 
≤ 140 mmHg (47%) or increase from baseline ≥  10 mmHg in DBP and/or ≥  20 mmHg in SBP with DBP ≤  90 
mmHg (44%) during the time period month >24. , This is more than twice the proportion of subjects with such 
blood pressure changes during the time period month 1-3. It is obvious that with longer follow-up the risk of 
developing hypertension is increased, but as hypertension is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular 
Assessment report

Page 89/104 
  
  
events, even a small increase in blood pressure is important and the possibility of a contributory effect by 
erenumb needs further elucidation.   
Some abnormal supraventricular rhythm cases were reported wither higher incidence in the 140 mg group 
suggesting possible dose-effect. Analysis of adverse events occurring in patients with abnormal ectopic 
supraventricular rhythm does not highlight any clear clinical impact. No new or other significant trends were 
observed in Pool B, C and D. 
In the long term open-label/active studies, the overall incidence of AEs appeared to increase over time. In 
addition, incidences of SAEs were slightly higher than 12 week controlled studies. There were generally no 
significant new trends observed in the long term safety data set (Pool C and D) as compared to the 3- and 6-
month controlled data. Pregnant and/or lactating women were excluded from participation in clinical studies 
and thus there is limited human data in this patient population. No conclusion could be drawn based on 29 
maternal exposures and 6 paternal exposures to erenumab from the AMG 334 clinical development program. 
There is a theoretical risk that CGRP inhibition may be a risk in pregnant women with risk factors for 
eclampsia. Based on such theoretical concerns, and also a more general uncertainty regarding treatment with 
a monoclonal antibody during pregnancy, a precautions or warning for women during pregnancy or lactating 
should be added in the SmPC. The issue of eclampsia in pregnant women should also be considered to be 
lifted as a potential important risk.  
Cardiovascular, Cerebrovascular, and Peripheral Arterial Disorder 
Since there is a theoretical concern that treatment with a CGRP receptor antibody may aggravate ischemic 
events such as stroke, TIA and MI, a comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk 
was provided by the applicant including the available data from AMG 334 clinical develop program.   
In the 12-week, placebo-controlled studies (Pool A) and the 24 weeks double blinded, placebo-controlled 
phase study 20120296 (Pool B),  the overall incidence of cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular AEs was low 
and were generally similar between the placebo group, the 70 mg group and the 140 mg group. No 
significant trends were observed. Palpitations were the most frequently reported adverse event in all 
treatment groups. 
The Pool C, longer-term safety data across the entire spectrum of exposure (double-blind treatment period 
and/or open-label extension/active treatment period), Myocardial ischaemia, Supraventricular extrasystoles, 
Bradycardia, Arteriosclerosis coronary artery, Conduction disorder, Pericarditis and Hypertensive heart 
disease events were reported . Most of these AEs have reported in 1 subject or 2 subjects in 70mg or 140mg 
dose group. There were 4 subjects who reported serious adverse events include myocardial ischemia (2 
subjects receiving 70 mg). For most of these cases, a strong causal relationship to AMG 334 seems unlikely 
since they have generally been confounded with a plausible alternative aetiology.  
However, one subject 17826003001 a 51-year-old female experienced two episodes of shortness of breath 
on exertion 8 days after first and second open label dose of AMG 334 70mg. The AE preferred term 
myocardial ischaemia on exertion based on ECG exercise was also reported. A causal relationship to AMG 334 
could be possible depending on reasonable time line and plausible action although other confounding factors 
such as concomitant medication might also play a role. 
In addition, there are two deaths reports.  One subject received AMG 334 70 mg died due to fatal AEs of 
arteriosclerosis and hypertensive heart disease. The second Subject received AMG 334 140 mg died due to 
heart failure associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (diagnosed post 
mortem). For both cases, there does not appear to be a strong causal relationship to AMG 334.  The overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 90/104 
  
  
incidence of the death reported in the studies is low and is not above the prevalence of CV mortality in the 
target population based on the Epidemiology data presented in the RMP. However, the follow-up for subjects 
included in trials are limited. 
Theoretically, an inhibition of the ability of vasodilatation in subjects with cardiovascular disease (either 
diagnosed or latent) could either result in an increased number of events based on the lack of vasodilation in 
case of occlusion of the vessels or increased damage due to impaired reperfusion after occlusion. The latter is 
difficult to demonstrate in a migraine population. 
Patients with migraine had an increased risk for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. The conducted 
phase 2/3 studies permitted inclusion of subjects with a cardiovascular history. However, the number of 
subjects with pre-existing major cardiovascular disease enrolled in the integrated AMG 334 studies was only 
0.5% and Patients with major cardiovascular disease (MI, stroke, TIA and unstable angina) were excluded. In 
addition, poorly controlled hypertension, systolic blood pressure 150 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 
90 mmHg or greater and BMI > 40 were also excluded from some of the clinical trials. No patient elderly than 
65 years old were included in the study. The long –term safety of AMG 334 is currently unknown. This is a 
particular concern having in mind that CGRP receptor antagonism theoretically may aggravate ischemic 
events such as stroke, TIA and MI, risks that are already slightly increased in patients with migraine. In light 
of this, the Applicant should discuss the appropriate target population for AMG 334 including a proposal for 
appropriate risk mitigation measures in the SmPC and additional pharmacovigilance actions. 
Other findings 
AEs of interest in gastrointestinal system, Nerve system, Immune system, Reproductive system were also 
evaluated.  
Except that the ADRs identified in the controlled clinical studies described above, no significant safety signals 
were observed based on available data. A long term safety data will be further assessed. 
The potential hepatotoxic effect of AMG 334 was assessed using a search strategy of hepatic disorder SMQ, 
as well as review of liver function laboratory tests. Few subjects with normal baseline LFTs increased to > 3 
times ULN or > 5 times ULN during the 12-month AMG 334 treatment period. Abnormal LFTs and Elevations 
of  total  bilirubin  were  also  observed  in  few  subjects  in  placebo  group.  No  subject  met  the  criteria  for  Hy’s 
Law. 
Grade 4 adverse event of increased blood creatinine phosphokinase was reported in one subject receiving 
140mg AMG 334 during 12 and 24 week double blind study period and 2 subjects receiving 140mg AMG 334 
in Pool C. There were a total of 73 subjects who had grade 3 or 4 CK elevation in the studies including 14 at 
the baseline. Of the 73 subjects, 11 reported mild or moderate musculoskeletal symptoms. There were no 
cardiac events reported in any of these subjects. Physical activity appears to be a confounder in most 
patients. There is a slight imbalance, based on a low number of patients, with more frequent occurrence of 
creatine kinase grade ≥ 3 (and ≥ 4) (lab toxicity level) under AMG 334 treatment compared to placebo. A 
review of safety data in the subjects with grade 3 or grade 4 CK elevations did not reveal a safety signal 
related to cardiac disorder, hepatic disorder, rhabdomyolysis, renal impairment or any other safety concern. 
The available data does not support a causal relationship between CK elevations and treatment with 
erenumab.  
Some abnormal supraventricular rhythm cases were reported wither higher incidence in the 140 mg group 
suggesting possible dose-effect. Analysis of adverse events occurring in patients with abnormal ectopic 
supraventricular rhythm does not highlight any clear clinical impact. There were also some prolonged PR

Page 91/104 
  
  
interval cases noticed with a possible trend to a dose dependant effect. No new or other significant trends 
were observed in Pool B, C and D.  
Other concerns that may associate with the use of anti CGRP antibody is immunogenicity and hypersensitivity 
reactions. In general, no significant trends were observed with respect to AE profile in the subjects who 
tested positive for binding AMG334 antibodies as compared with the safety profiles of antibody negative 
subjects. The exposure-adjusted Subject Incidence Rate of AE PT, Rash, Urticaria, Hypersensitivity and 
injection site eczema found higher in subjects who tested positive for binding antibodies than that of antibody 
negative subjects and placebo. Since these AEs only occurred in 1-3 subjects with AMG 334 binding antibody 
positive, it is not possible to draw a firm conclusion. An increased incidence rate of injection site reactions 
including injection site erythema, rash and pruritus and Pruritus were observed with 140 mg AMG 334 
compared to placebo and is considered an ADR. 
Based on knowledge of intended drug target pathway, the carcinogenic potential for AMG 334 was assessed 
depends on the clinical study data. No particular trends regarding malignancy were observed in the relatively 
short observation period of 52 weeks of the study period.  
Due to the clinical trial exclusion criteria, little to no data are available in migraine patients with major 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and 
unstable angina), elderly patients > 65 years of age, paediatric and adolescent patients < 18 years of age, 
pregnant or breastfeeding women, patients with severe renal impairment, and patients with moderate to 
severe hepatic impairment.  
2.5.6.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
AMG 334 was generally well tolerated, although a small increase in the incidence of Injection site reactions, 
Constipation, Muscle spasms and Pruritus were observed in the controlled studies. There is a theoretical 
concern that treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonism may aggravate ischemic events such as stroke, TIA 
and MI. One subject experienced two episodes of shortness of breath on exertion 8 days after first and 
second open label dose of AMG 334 70mg and reported myocardial ischaemia on exertion with a possible 
plausibility. Due to the clinical trial exclusion criteria, little to no data is available in migraine patients with 
major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. It is not known to what degree potential concerns relating 
to the theoretical risk of CGRP antagonists may apply to AMG 334.  
In view of the theoretical concern due to the vasodilating effects of CGRP, AMG 334 being the first in class, 
and the potential long-term exposure of patients for prophylaxis of migraine, no subjects with major 
cardiovascular disease (MI, stroke, TIA, and unstable angina) were included the erenumab phase 2 and 3 
clinical trials, the concern of Cardiovascular, Cerebrovascular, and Peripheral Arterial Disorder related to AMG 
334 treatment in migraine patients is identified as missing information.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: The Applicant will 
conduct non-interventional study to discuss cardiovascular outcomes in patients with pre-existing conditions 
and use in pregnant women.

Conclusion 
The  CHMP  and  PRAC  considered  that  the  risk  management  plan  version  1.4  (dated  25  May  2018)  is 
acceptable.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 17.05.2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that erenumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers erenumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Aimovig (erenumab) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Aimovig is intended for treatment as migraine prophylaxis in adult patients with at least 4 monthly migraine 
days.  
Migraines are believed to be a neurovascular disorder with disease mechanisms both within the brain and the 
blood vessels of the head. CGRP seems involved in the pathophysiology of neurovascular headaches such as 
migraine at both central and peripheral levels. When released peripherally from activated trigeminal nerve 
nociceptive endings, CGRP induces edema, increases blood flow, and recruits inflammatory cells, promoting 
neurogenic inflammation and leading to migraine pain. Serum and saliva CGRP levels are elevated during 
spontaneous migraine attacks and also between attacks in patients with chronic migraine (CM). 
Migraine is conceptualized as a spectrum disorder, although it has been arbitrarily classified as either episodic 
migraine (EM), characterized by fewer than 15 headache days per month, or chronic migraine (CM), 
characterized by 15 or more headache days per month with at least 8 days being migraine days. 
The aim of migraine prophylactic therapy is to reduce the number of monthly migraine days thereby 
ultimately improving daily functions and quality of life. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Migraine is treated with medications for the acute headache attacks, involving symptomatic medications such 
as NSAID or migraine-specific acute medications such as triptans. Many patients require prophylaxis due to 
the high severity of disease characterized by frequent attacks and/or severe functional impact. The main goal 
of a prophylactic treatment is to reduce the frequency of migraine days. 
The standard of care in migraine prophylaxis is quite heterogeneous across European countries. Approved 
treatments in the European Union (EU) that are commonly available include propranolol, metoprolol, 
topiramate, and amitriptyline, which recently underwent a procedure to harmonize the prescribing 
information across the EU (Article 30 referral procedure). Onabotulinum toxin A (Botox) is currently approved 
for patients with chronic migraine (CM) in some EU member states.  In addition to those, several countries 
have additional local therapies approved such as flunarizine, pizotifen or others.  Other compounds have 
shown some degree of efficacy in the prophylaxis of migraine but are not approved for this use in most 
European countries (e.g. venlafaxine, lisinopril and candesartan).

Existing treatments are frequently associated with variable efficacy and poor safety and tolerability, leading 
to low persistence and adherence rates. Many of the existing treatments, including approved therapies, were 
not originally developed for migraine prophylaxis and do not target the underlying pathophysiology of the 
migraine disorder.  
There is an unmet need for a disease-specific prophylactic treatment of migraine in adults, with clinically 
meaningful effects on number of migraine days and daily function/quality of life, and which is well tolerated. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
20120295: Phase 2/3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of SC Aimovig every 4 weeks for 12 weeks  in subjects with 
chronic migraine (≥8 monthly migraine days, ≥15 monthly headache days at baseline). 667 patients were 
randomised (3:2:2) to receive placebo, Aimovig 70 mg and Aimovig 140 mg. 
20120296: Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of SC Aimovig every 4 weeks for 24 weeks  in subjects with 
episodic migraine (≥ 4 and <15 migraine days per month with <15 headache days per month at baseline). 
955 patients were randomised (1:1:1) to receive placebo, Aimovig 70 mg and Aimovig 140 mg. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the chronic migraine study (Study 20120295), Aimovig at 70 and 140 mg reduced the number of monthly 
migraine days (primary endpoint) from a baseline mean of around 18 days by 6.64 (7.47, 5.81) and 6.63 
(7.45, 5.80) days, respectively, compared to a reduction in the placebo group of 4.18 (3.50, 4.86) days, 
resulting in a Difference in LSM of -2.46 and -2.45, respectively, and p-values of <0.001. 
The secondary endpoint monthly migraine days (MMD) responder rates (≥50% reduction in MMD from 
baseline to last 4 weeks of the 12-week DB treatment) were 23.5%, 39.9%, 41.2% for placebo, Aimovig 70 
mg and 140 mg, respectively, yielding adjusted odds ratios of 2.18 (1.46, 3.27) and 2.34 (1.56, 3.51) and p-
values of <0.001. 
Monthly acute migraine-specific medication treatment days were reduced by 1.58, 3.45, and 4.13, for 
placebo, Aimovig 70 mg and 140 mg, respectively, resulting in a difference in LSM of -1.86 (-2.60, -1.13) 
and -2.55  (-3.28, -1.82) vs placebo and p-values of <0.001. 
In the episodic migraine study (Study 20120296) Aimovig at 70 and 140 mg reduced the number of monthly 
migraine days (primary endpoint) from a baseline mean of around 8 days by 3.23 (3.58, 2.88) and 3.67 
(4.02, 3.33) days, respectively, compared to a reduction in the placebo group of 1.83 (2.18, 1.48) days, 
resulting in a Difference in LSM of -1.40 and -1.85, respectively, and p-values of <0.001. 
The secondary endpoint monthly migraine days (MMD) responder rates (≥50% reduction in MMD from 
baseline to last 3 months of the 24-week DB treatment) were 26.6%, 43.3%, 50.0% for placebo, Aimovig 70 
mg and 140 mg, respectively, yielding adjusted odds ratios of 2.13 (1.52, 2.98) and 2.81 (2.01, 3.94) and p-
values of <0.001. 
Monthly acute migraine-specific medication treatment days were reduced with 0.20, 1.13, and 1.61, for 
placebo, Aimovig 70 mg and 140 mg, respectively, resulting in a difference in LSM of -0.94 (-1.23, 0.64) and 
-1.42 (-1.71, -1-12) vs placebo and p-values of <0.001. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 97/104 
  
  
 
MPFID Physical impairment score was reduced with 2.38 (3.16, 1.59), 4.24 (5.02, 3.45), 4.81 (5.59, 4.03) 
for placebo, Aimovig 70 mg and 140 mg, respectively, resulting in a difference in LSM of -1.86 (-2.95, -0.77) 
and -2.43 (-3.51, -1.35) vs placebo and p-values of <0.001. 
MPFID Everyday activities score was reduced with 3.30 (4.06, 2.53), 5.52 (6.28, 4.75), 5.86 (6.62, 5.10) for 
placebo, Aimovig 70 mg and 140 mg, respectively, resulting in a difference in LSM of -2.22 (-3.28, -1.16) 
and -2.57 (-3.62, -1.51) vs placebo and p-values of <0.001. 
The results are consistent with regards to different main endpoints and also between the main studies of the 
development programme. The results for the primary endpoint monthly migraine days were supported by 
consistent positive effects on 50% responder rate, reduction of acute migraine-specific treatment and the 
positive effects on the patients’ quality-of-life, as reported in a number of different patient-reported outcome 
scales.  
However,  when  comparing  the  response  for  all  efficacy  (primary  and  secondary)  endpoints  in  both  main 
studies for both doses, the observed results are comparable. 
A  subgroup  analysis  of  the  episodic  migraine  study  dividing  the  subjects  into  those  with  <8  or  ≥8  MMD 
showed that a beneficial effect of erenumab on MMD of similar size was seen in both subgroups.  
Subgroup analyses from the two pivotal studies showed that subgroups of patients with chronic or episodic 
migraine who had failed >1 or >2 previous treatments achieved similar or slightly better results on MMD 
reduction compared to patients who were treatment naïve or hadn’t failed any previous treatment.  
In patients with chronic migraine (Study 20120295) fulfilling protocol-specified criteria for medication 
overuse headache (N=113 for placebo, N=77 for the 70 mg and N=78 for the 140 mg dose), efficacy results 
(MMD, 50% responder rate, acute migraine medication) were still highly significant for this small subgroup 
and consistent with the results from the whole study population. 
Time to onset and maintenance of effect: Analyses of the change from baseline in MMD (the primary 
endpoint in the 2 pivotal studies) at other assessment timepoints (ie, weeks 4 and 8 in Study 20120295 and 
weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 [based on the last 4 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase] in Study 
20120296) showed that a significant effect on MDD was achieved already at the week 4 assessment 
timepoint and was maintained throughout the 4 week-interval assessments up to week 24 (Study 
20120296). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Initially, the applicant proposed the 140 mg dose as their commercial therapeutic dose, since the episodic 
migraine study (20120296) showed dose-response with the 140 mg dose resulting in numerically better 
effects than the 70 mg dose. However, in the chronic migraine study (20120295), there was no obvious 
dose-response. From the exposure-response analyses, the seemingly flat relation between exposure and 
response based on the model for chronic migraine is in line with the weak dose-response effects seen in the 
CM study. In contrast, from the model for episodic migraine, a significant relationship between AMG 334 
exposure and clinical efficacy for episodic migraine was seen and the 70-mg dose provided an exposure that 
was still on the steep part of the exposure-response curve. 
Studies were not designed to show differences between the 2 doses. Though some exploratory analyses show 
numerically higher response levels for the 140 mg dose compared to 70 mg dose, the clinical relevance of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 98/104 
  
  
 
 
these differences in terms of number of monthly migraine days is questionable. Regarding the differential in 
responder rates, the results come from open label phases of trials where doses were not randomly allocated, 
therefore causality of these differences is difficult to decipher.  
The applicant has not conducted any head-to-head comparisons with other approved migraine prophylactic 
medicines (e.g. beta-blockers for EM, topiramate (EM and CM) and Botox (only CM)). A three-armed study 
with an active comparator in addition to placebo and the investigational product is recommended in the EMA 
Migraine Guidelines. However, the arguments by the applicant, that well-known side effects of the 
established migraine prophylactic treatments may unblind the patients and the study physicians to the actual 
received treatment, are acknowledged. Moreover, since the administration routes are different (oral for beta-
blockers and topiramate, SC once monthly for Aimovig, 31 local SC injections in the head and neck for Botox) 
the design of a double-blinded study would be very demanding. However, compared to historical data from 
topiramate and Botox published studies, treatment effects of Aimovig are well in line with these results. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A total of over 2,500 patients have been treated in registration studies. Of these, more than 1,300 patients 
were exposed for at least 12 months. 
Based on 12 weeks placebo controlled studies (Pool A), the common AEs that occurred with a ≥  1% overall 
incidence in AMG 334 70 mg or 140 mg group and ≥  2 times the rate of the placebo group are summarized 
as follow:  
•  Constipation was reported in 1.1%, 1.3%, and 3.2% of subjects in the placebo, 70 mg, and 140 mg 
groups, respectively. Constipation was not reported as serious for any subject and all events were 
grade 1 and 2 severity. 
• 
• 
Injection site pain was reported for 1.7%, 3.7%, and 1.6% of subjects in the placebo, 70 mg, and 
140 mg groups, respectively. Injection site pain was not reported as serious for any subject and all 
but 1 event were of grade 1 severity. 
Injection site erythema was reported for 0.2%, 1.0%, and 2.0% of subjects in the placebo, 70 mg, 
and 140 mg groups, respectively. Injection site erythema was not reported as serious for any subject 
and all but 1 event were of grade 1 severity; 1 event was grade 2. 
•  Muscle spasm was reported for 0.4%, 0.1%, and 2.0% of subjects in the placebo, 70 mg, and 140 
mg groups, respectively. Muscle spasm was not reported as serious for any subject and all but 1 
event were considered to be grade 1 and 2 severity; 1 event was grade 3.  
•  Generalized pruritus was reported for 0.1%, 0.0%, and 1.2% of subjects in the placebo, 70 mg, and 
140 mg groups, respectively. Generalized pruritus was not reported as serious for any subject  and 
all were considered to be grade 1 or 2 severity  
• 
The pruritus NEC HLT (High level term) was further reviewed and an imbalance was observed in the 
140 mg treatment group (0.5%, 0.7%, 1.8% in the placebo, 70 mg, and 140 mg groups, 
respectively). Individual terms included pruritus, generalized pruritus and rash pruritic. Based on the 
numeric differences between placebo and 140 mg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 99/104 
  
  
 
The overall incidence of AEs of adverse events were higher in Pool B (24 weeks) compared to Pool A (12 
weeks), but similar across placebo (63.6%), AMG 334 70 mg (57.6%), and AMG 334 140 mg (55.8%) 
groups. Treatment-emergent adverse events ≥  1% patients in either AMG 334 70 mg or 140 mg group and 
≥  2 x the rate in the placebo group include:  
•  Constipation (1.3%, 1.9% and 3.8% of the subjects in the placebo 70mg and 140mg groups, 
respectively) 
• 
• 
Injection site pain (0.3%, 3.2% and 0.6% of the subjects in the placebo 70mg and 140mg groups, 
respectively),  
Injection site erythema (0.3%, 1.9% and 1.3% of the subjects in the placebo 70mg and 140mg 
groups, respectively)  
There were no death or serious Hypersensitivity Reactions / anaphylaxis or any signal identified in the data 
submitted. In some cases, chronology and /or recurrence of the event after re-challenge supports causality 
with erenumab. A majority of cases reported rash with various manifestations, from pruritus to erythema, 
urticarial, eczema, or unspecified. There were cases of oedema / swelling only non-serious and sometimes 
not requiring drug discontinuation. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Considering that AMG 334 constitutes a new therapeutic approach for prophylaxis of migraine, the available 
safety data is considered rather limited to assess a particular concern that CGRP receptor antagonism 
theoretically may aggravate ischemic events such as stroke, TIA and MI, risks that are already slightly 
increased in patients with migraine.  
Although no significant trends were observed with respect to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular related AEs 
in the 12 week or 24 weeks controlled studies (Pool A and B),  there were two cardiac disorder related deaths 
and several subjects who reported serious cardiovascular or cerebrovascular adverse events including 
myocardial ischemia in the long term open label studies (pool C and D). For most of these cases, a strong 
causal relationship to AMG 334 seems unlikely since they have generally been confounded with a plausible 
alternative aetiology.  
In addition, the proportion of subjects with pre-existing cardiovascular disease enrolled in the integrated AMG 
334 studies was only 0.5% and patients with major cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease (e.g. MI, 
stroke, TIA and unstable angina) were excluded. No patient older than 65 years old were included in the 
study. Considering patients with migraine had an increased risk for cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
diseases and long term safety of AMG 334 is currently rather limited, it is not known to what degree potential 
concerns relating to the theoretical cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk of CGRP antagonists may apply to 
AMG 334.  
There were small differences cross treatment groups for the number of subjects with post baseline 
SBP>160mmHg and subjects with DBP increase ≥10mmHg in the 12 weeks controlled studies.  
A small number of subjects with normal baseline LFTs increased to > 3 times ULN or > 5 times ULN during 
the 12-month AMG 334 treatment period. No subject met the criteria for Hy’s Law. No significant trends were 
observed with respect to dose dependent Abnormal LFTs in the controlled study pools and the updated long 
term safety data. Even if patients were also taking other medications with known hepatotoxicity such as 
NSAID, in some cases a strong temporal relation between erenumab treatment and possible mild hepatic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018 
Page 100/104 
  
  
toxicity appears. The information on a risk of increased hepatic enzymes and Information on increased CPK 
should also be monitored in the future PSUR. 
There is also a theoretical risk that CGRP inhibition may be a risk in pregnant women with risk factors for pre-
eclampsia. Based on such a concern and also a more general uncertainty regarding treatment with a 
monoclonal antibody during pregnancy, the issue of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women should considered to 
be an important potential risk.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The significant reduction of MMD, greater responder rate and reduction of acute migraine-specific medication 
days compared to placebo and improvement of different quality of life-related scales are all important and 
relevant outcomes to the patient suffering from episodic or chronic migraine. The results on the main 
endpoints are deemed clinically meaningful when compared to literature references and results from pivotal 
migraine prophylaxis treatment studies with topiramate and Botox, respectively (a 2.0 monthly migraine 
days difference vs placebo in the Botox pivotal studies for chronic migraine (Botox SmPC) and a 1.6 MDD 
difference vs placebo in a phase 3 study with topiramate in episodic migraine (Silberstein et al, 2004). The 
results for both doses are comparable for most efficacy (primary and secondary) endpoints in both main 
studies. The additional benefit of the higher dose (140 mg every 4th week) compared to the lower dose (70 
mg every 4th week) is limited, but may be of benefit for some patients.   
The favourable effects of Aimovig have been demonstrated in the clinical studies covering the disease 
severity spectrum of migraine from episodic migraine (≥4 to ≤14 migraine days per month) to chronic 
migraine (≥8 migraine days and 15≥headache days per month).  
Concerning the optimal duration of use, this is largely unknown, but the SmPC includes a recommendation to 
consider discontinuation of treatment in patients who have shown no response after 3 months of treatment. 
Evaluation of the need to continue treatment is recommended regularly thereafter. 
The effects were similar in analysed subgroups, eg. migraine prophylaxis-naïve patients, those who have 
failed previous prophylactic therapy, as well as patients fulfilling the criteria for medication overuse. 
Treatment with AMG 334 was generally well tolerated, although a small increase in the incidence of injection 
site reactions, constipation, muscle spasms and pruritus was observed in the 3 to 6 months controlled studies 
compared to placebo.  
There is a theoretical concern that treatment with CGRP receptor antibodies due to their antagonism of 
vasodilatory effects of CGRP may aggravate an ischemic event (i.e. myocardial infarction, angina, stroke, 
TIA). However, the clinical development programme did not reveal any major findings that would suggest an 
increased cardiovascular risk with erenumab. The clinical development programme included two dedicated PD 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/413393/2018

studies, the first specifically investigating the potential interaction/augmentation of IV erenumab on the 
increase of blood pressure induced by sumatriptan and the second investigating the effects of IV erenumab 
on exercise duration on a treadmill in patients with stable angina. Neither of these two PD studies showed 
any clinically significant effects on blood pressure nor aggravation of myocardial ischaemia in these patients.  
In view of this theoretical concern related to the vasodilating effects of CGRP, AMG 334 being the first in 
class, and the potential long-term exposure of patients for prophylaxis of migraine it is a limitation that no 
subjects with major cardiovascular disease (MI, stroke, TIA, and unstable angina) were included the 
erenumab phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The theoretical concern of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and 
peripheral arterial disorder potentially related to AMG 334 treatment in migraine patients, is identified as 
missing information.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Even though a mean absolute reduction of monthly migraine days (MMD) of approx. 7 days in CM (compared 
to approx. 4 days for placebo) and approx. 3-4 days in EM  (compared to approx. 2 days for placebo) may 
not seem impressive, 40% of patients in CM and of up to 50 % in EM (compared to 24 % in CM and 27 % in 
EM for the placebo groups, respectively) experienced a 50% reduction of MMD which indicates that the 
results are of clinical relevance. This benefit is considered to outweigh the risks considering the rather low 
incidence of non-severe adverse events. 
3.7.1.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The Applicant has proposed an indication including all adult patients with at least 4 migraine days per month 
irrespective of age. It is recognized that patients with fewer migraine days than 4 per month are not eligible 
for prophylactic treatment and have not been included in the performed studies. Therefore, the at least 4 
migraine days per month is considered a relevant cut-off for initiating prophylactic treatment with erenumab. 
Based on the submitted data, patients with a more severe disease may have a somewhat higher response to 
treatment. However, there is no obvious cut off with respect to baseline severity that can support the 
inclusion of a higher cut-off in the indication. 
With respect to age, no patients older than 65 years were included in the studies. The Applicant has 
presented efficacy and safety data in different age groups which do not support that there is an attenuation 
of effect or increase of adverse events based on age. Further, it can be expected that the efficacy in patients 
older than 65 years would be similar to the other (studied) age groups also considering that the disease 
characteristics and pharmacokinetics of erenumab are not expected to be different compared to younger 
patients. Thus, it is considered that the B/R in younger patients can be extrapolated to patients above 65, 
and therefore, no restriction to the indication is warranted. 
4.  Recommendations

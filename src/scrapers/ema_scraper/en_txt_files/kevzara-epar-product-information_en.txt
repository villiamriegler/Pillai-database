CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Kevzara in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderately to 
severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who 
are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Kevzara can be 
given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when treatment with MTX is inappropriate 
(see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and supervised by healthcare professionals experienced in the diagnosis 
and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients should be given the patient alert card.

Posology 
The recommended dose of sarilumab is 200 mg once every 2 weeks administered as a subcutaneous 
injection. 
Reduction of dose from 200 mg once every 2 weeks to 150 mg once every 2 weeks is recommended 
for management of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and liver enzyme elevations. 
Dose modification 
Treatment with sarilumab should be withheld in patients who develop a serious infection until the 
infection is controlled. 
Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with a low neutrophil count, i.e. 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 2 x 109/L. 
Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with a platelet count below 
150 x 103/µL.

Sarilumab can then be resumed at 150 mg every 2 weeks and increased 
to 200 mg every 2 weeks as clinically appropriate. 
Treatment with sarilumab should be discontinued. 
If a dose of sarilumab is missed and it has been 3 days or less since the missed dose, the next dose 
should be administered as soon as possible. The subsequent dose should be administered at the 
regularly scheduled time. If it has been 4 days or more since the missed dose, the subsequent dose 
should be administered at the next regularly scheduled time, the dose should not be doubled.

Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Sarilumab has not 
been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The safety and efficacy of sarilumab have not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment, 
including patients with positive hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) serology (see 
section 4.4). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of sarilumab in children up to 18 years of age have not been established. No 
data are available.  
Method of administration 
Subcutaneous use. 
The total content (1.14 ml) of the pre-filled syringe/pre-filled pen should be administered as a 
subcutaneous injection. Injection sites (abdomen, thigh and upper arm) should be rotated with each 
injection. Sarilumab should not be injected into skin that is tender, damaged, or has bruises or scars. 
A patient may self-inject sarilumab or the patient's caregiver may administer sarilumab if their 
healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate. Proper training should be provided to patients 
and/or caregivers on the preparation and administration of sarilumab prior to use. 
Comprehensive instructions for administration of this medicinal product are given in the package 
leaflet.  
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Active, severe infections (see section 4.4). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Serious infections  
Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during 
treatment with sarilumab (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). As there is a higher incidence of infections in the 
elderly population in general, caution should be used when treating the elderly.  
Sarilumab should not be administered in patients with an active infection, including localised 
infections. The risks and benefits should be considered prior to initiating treatment in patients who 
have: 
• 
• 
• 
chronic or recurrent infection; 
a history of serious or opportunistic infections;  
HIV infection; 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection; 
been exposed to tuberculosis; or 
lived in or travelled to areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses. 
Treatment with sarilumab should be withheld if a patient develops a serious infection or an 
opportunistic infection.  
A patient who develops an infection during treatment should also undergo prompt and complete 
diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy 
should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored. 
Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other 
opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents including 
sarilumab for RA. The most frequently observed serious infections with sarilumab included 
pneumonia and cellulitis (see section 4.8). Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, candidiasis, 
and pneumocystis were reported with sarilumab. In isolated cases, disseminated rather than localised 
infections were observed in patients often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as MTX or 
corticosteroids, which in addition to RA may predispose them to infections.  
Tuberculosis 
Patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors and tested for latent infection prior to 
initiating treatment with sarilumab. Patients with latent or active tuberculosis should be treated with 
standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating treatment. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should be 
considered prior to initiation of treatment in patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis 
in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for 
latent tuberculosis but having risk factors for tuberculosis infection. When considering anti-
tuberculosis therapy, consultation with a physician with expertise in tuberculosis may be appropriate. 
Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis 
including patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy. 
Viral reactivation 
Viral reactivation has been reported with immunosuppressive biologic therapies. Cases of herpes 
zoster were observed in clinical studies with sarilumab (see section 4.8). No cases of Hepatitis B 
reactivation were reported in the clinical studies; however patients who were at risk for reactivation 
were excluded. 
Laboratory parameters 
Neutrophil count 
Treatment with sarilumab was associated with a higher incidence of decrease in ANC (see section 
4.8). Decrease in ANC was not associated with higher incidence of infections, including serious 
infections.  
• 
Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with a low neutrophil count, 
i.e., ANC less than 2 x 109/L. In patients who develop an ANC less than 0.5 x 109/L, treatment 
with sarilumab should be discontinued (see section 4.2). 
•  Neutrophil count should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and according to 
clinical judgment thereafter. For recommended dose modifications based on ANC results, see 
section 4.2. 
•  Based on the pharmacodynamics of the changes in ANC,  results obtained at the end of the 
dosing interval should be used when considering dose modification (see section 5.1).  
Platelet count 
Treatment with sarilumab was associated with a reduction in platelet counts in clinical studies. 
Reduction in platelets was not associated with bleeding events (see section 4.8). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with a platelet count below 
150 x103/µL. In patients who develop a platelet count less than 50 x 103/ µL, treatment with 
sarilumab should be discontinued. 
•  Platelet count should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and according to clinical 
judgment thereafter. For recommended dose modifications based on platelet counts, see section 
4.2. 
Liver enzymes 
Treatment with sarilumab was associated with a higher incidence of transaminase elevations. These 
elevations were transient and did not result in any clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical studies 
(see section 4.8). Increased frequency and magnitude of these elevations were observed when 
potentially hepatotoxic medicinal products (e.g., MTX) were used in combination with sarilumab. 
Initiating treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with elevated transaminases, ALT 
or AST greater than 1.5 x ULN. In patients who develop elevated ALT greater than 5 x ULN, 
treatment with sarilumab should be discontinued (see section 4.2). 
ALT and AST levels should be monitored 4 to 8 weeks after start of therapy and every 3 months 
thereafter. When clinically indicated, consider other liver function tests such as bilirubin. For 
recommended dose modifications based on transaminase elevations, see section 4.2.  
Lipid abnormalities 
Lipid levels may be reduced in patients with chronic inflammation. Treatment with sarilumab was 
associated with increases in lipid parameters such as LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and/or 
triglycerides (see section 4.8). Lipid parameters should be assessed approximately 4 to 8 weeks 
following initiation of treatment with sarilumab, then at approximately 6 month intervals. 
Patients should be managed according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidaemia. 
Gastrointestinal perforation and diverticulitis 
Cases of gastrointestinal perforation and diverticulitis have been reported in association with 
sarilumab. Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients with and without diverticulitis. 
Sarilumab should be used with caution in patients with previous history of intestinal ulceration or 
diverticulitis. Patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms such as persistent pain with 
fever should be evaluated promptly (see section 4.8).  
Malignancies  
Treatment with immunosuppressants may result in an increased risk of malignancies. The impact of 
treatment with sarilumab on the development of malignancies is not known but malignancies were 
reported in clinical studies (see section 4.8).  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in association with sarilumab (see section 4.8). Injection 
site rash, rash, and urticaria were the most frequent hypersensitivity reactions. Patients should be 
advised to seek immediate medical attention if they experience any symptoms of a hypersensitivity 
reaction. If anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of Sarilumab should 
be stopped immediately (see section 4.3).  
Hepatic impairment  
Treatment with sarilumab is not recommended in patients with active hepatic disease or hepatic 
impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).

Vaccinations 
Concurrent use of live vaccines as well as live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during treatment 
with sarilumab as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary 
transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving sarilumab. Prior to 
initiating treatment, it is recommended that all patients be brought up to date with all immunisations in 
agreement with current immunisation guidelines. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation 
of therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines regarding immunosuppressive 
agents (see section 4.5). 
Cardiovascular risk 
RA patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular disorders and risk factors (e.g. hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia) should be managed as part of usual standard of care. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Sarilumab exposure was not affected when coadministered with MTX based on the population 
pharmacokinetic analyses and across study comparisons. MTX exposure is not expected to be changed 
by sarilumab coadministration; however, no clinical data was collected. Sarilumab has not been 
investigated in combination with Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors or biological DMARDs such as Tumor 
Necrosis Factor (TNF) antagonists.  
Various in vitro and limited in vivo human studies have shown that cytokines and cytokine modulators 
can influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4) and therefore have the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics of 
concomitantly administered medicinal products that are substrates of these enzymes. Elevated levels of 
interleukin-6 (IL-6) may down-regulate CYP activity such as in patients with RA and hence increase 
drug levels compared to subjects without RA. Blockade of IL-6 signalling by IL-6Rα antagonists such 
as sarilumab might reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 and restore CYP activity, leading to altered 
medicinal products concentrations.  
The modulation of IL-6 effect on CYP enzymes by sarilumab may be clinically relevant for CYP 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or 
discontinuation of sarilumab in patients being treated with CYP substrate medicinal products, 
therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., theophylline) should be 
performed and the individual dose of the medicinal product should be adjusted as needed.  
Caution should be exercised in patients who start sarilumab treatment while on therapy with CYP3A4 
substrates (e.g., oral contraceptives or statins), as sarilumab may reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 
and restore CYP3A4 activity, leading to decreased exposure and activity of CYP3A4 substrate (see 
section 5.2). Interaction of sarilumab with substrates of other CYPs (CYP2C9, CYP 2C19, CYP2D6) 
has not been studied.  
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 3 months after 
treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of sarilumab in pregnant women.  
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sarilumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with sarilumab. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether sarilumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion. 
The excretion of sarilumab in milk has not been studied in animals (see section 5.3). 
Because IgG1 are excreted in human milk, a decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-
feeding or to discontinue sarilumab therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the 
child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No data are available on the effect of sarilumab on human fertility. Animal studies showed no 
impairment of male or female fertility (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Kevzara has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequent adverse reactions are neutropenia (14.2%), upper respiratory infections (7.1%), 
increased ALT (6.8%), urinary tract infections (5.7%), and injection site erythema (5.3%). The most 
common serious adverse reactions are infections (2.9%) (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions listed in the table have been reported in controlled clinical studies. The frequency of 
adverse reactions listed below is defined using the following convention: 
very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects 
are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Infections 
In the placebo-controlled population, the rates of infections were 84.5, 81.0, and 75.1 events per 100 
patient-years, in the 200 mg and 150 mg sarilumab + DMARDs and placebo + DMARDs groups 
respectively. The most commonly reported infections (5% to 7% of patients) were upper respiratory 
tract infections, urinary tract infections, and nasopharyngitis. The rates of serious infections were 4.3, 
3.0, and 3.1 events per 100 patient-years, in the 200 mg, 150 mg sarilumab + DMARDs, and placebo + 
DMARDs groups, respectively. 
In the sarilumab +DMARDs long-term safety population, the rates of infections and serious infection 
were 57.3 and 3.4 events per 100-patient years, respectively.   
The most frequently observed serious infections included pneumonia and cellulitis. Cases of 
opportunistic infection have been reported (see section 4.4). 
The overall rates of infections and serious infections in the sarilumab monotherapy population were 
consistent with rates in the sarilumab + DMARDs population. 
Gastrointestinal perforation 
Gastrointestinal perforation was reported in patients with and without diverticulitis. Most patients who 
developed gastrointestinal perforations were taking concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicinal products (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. The contribution of these concomitant 
medications relative to sarilumab in the development of gastrointestinal perforations is not known (see 
section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In the placebo-controlled population, the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to 
hypersensitivity reactions was higher among those treated with sarilumab (0.9% in 200 mg group, 
0.5% in 150 mg group) than placebo (0.2%). The rates of discontinuations due to hypersensitivity in 
the sarilumab + DMARDs long-term safety population and the sarilumab monotherapy population 
were consistent with the placebo-controlled population. In the placebo-controlled population, 0.2% of 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the patients treated with sarilumab 200 mg every two weeks (q2w) + DMARD reported serious 
adverse reactions of hypersensitivity reactions, and none from sarilumab 150 mg q2w + DMARD 
group. 
Injection site reactions 
In the placebo-controlled population, injection site reactions were reported in 9.5%, 8%, and 1.4% of 
patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg, 150 mg, and placebo respectively. These injection site reactions 
(including erythema and pruritus) were mild to moderate in severity for the majority of patients 
(99.5%, 100%, and 100%, for sarilumab 200 mg, 150 mg, and placebo respectively). Two patients on 
sarilumab (0.2%) discontinued treatment due to injection site reactions.  
Laboratory abnormalities 
To allow for a direct comparison of frequency of laboratory abnormalities between placebo and active 
treatment, data from weeks 0-12 were used as this was prior to patients being permitted to switch from 
placebo to sarilumab. 
Neutrophil count 
Decreases in neutrophil counts below 1 x 109/L occurred in 6.4% and 3.6% of patients in the 200 mg 
and 150 mg sarilumab + DMARDs group, respectively, compared to no patients in the placebo + 
DMARDs group. Decreases in neutrophil counts below 0.5 x 109/L occurred in 0.8% and 0.6% of 
patients in the 200 mg and 150 mg sarilumab+ DMARDs groups, respectively. In patients 
experiencing a decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC), modification of treatment regimen such 
as interruption of sarilumab or reduction in dose resulted in an increase or normalisation of ANC (see 
section 4.2). Decrease in ANC was not associated with higher incidence of infections, including 
serious infections. 
In the sarilumab + DMARDs long-term safety population and the sarilumab monotherapy population, 
the observations on neutrophil counts were consistent with those seen in the placebo-controlled 
population (see section 4.4).  
Platelet count 
Decreases in platelet counts below 100 x 103/µL occurred in 1.2% and 0.6% of patients on 200 mg and 
150 mg sarilumab + DMARDs, respectively, compared to no patients on placebo + DMARDs. 
In the sarilumab + DMARDs long-term safety population and the sarilumab monotherapy population, 
the observations on platelet counts were consistent with those seen in the placebo-controlled 
population.  
There were no bleeding events associated with decreases in platelet count. 
Liver enzymes 
Liver enzyme abnormalities are summarised in Table 3. In patients experiencing liver enzyme 
elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as interruption of treatment or reduction in dose, 
resulted in decrease or normalisation of liver enzymes (see section 4.2). These elevations were not 
associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical 
evidence of hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency (see section 4.4).

Lipids 
Lipid parameters (LDL, HDL, and triglycerides) were first assessed at 4 weeks following initiation of 
sarilumab+ DMARDs in the placebo-controlled population. At week 4 the mean LDL increased by 14 
mg/dL; mean triglycerides increased by 23 mg/dL; and mean HDL increased by 3 mg/dL. After week 
4 no additional increases were observed. There were no meaningful differences between doses.  
In the sarilumab + DMARDs long-term safety population and the sarilumab monotherapy population, 
the observations in lipid parameters were consistent with those seen in the placebo-controlled 
population.  
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with sarilumab.  
In the placebo-controlled population, 4.0%, 5.6%, and 2.0% of patients treated with sarilumab 200 mg 
+ DMARDs, sarilumab 150 mg + DMARDs and placebo + DMARDs respectively, exhibited a 
positive response in the anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay. Positive responses in the neutralising 
antibody (NAb) assay were detected in 1.0%, 1.6%, and 0.2% of patients on sarilumab 200 mg, 
sarilumab 150 mg, and placebo respectively.  
In the sarilumab monotherapy population, observations were consistent with the sarilumab + 
DMARDs population.    
Anti Drug Antibody (ADA) formation may affect pharmacokinetics of sarilumab. No correlation was 
observed between ADA development and either loss of efficacy or adverse reactions. 
The detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the 
assays used and testing conditions. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to 
sarilumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. 
Malignancies 
In the placebo-controlled population, malignancies occurred at the same rate in patients receiving 
either sarilumab + DMARDs or placebo + DMARDs (1.0 events per 100 patient-years).  
In the sarilumab + DMARDs long-term safety population and the sarilumab monotherapy population, 
the rates of malignancies were consistent with the rate observed in the placebo-controlled population 
(see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.  
4.9  Overdose 
There is no specific treatment for Kevzara overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be 
closely monitored, treated symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosupressants, Interleukin inhibitors, ATC code: L04AC14 
Mechanism of action  
Sarilumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG1 subtype) that specifically binds to both soluble and 
membrane-bound IL-6 receptors (IL-6Rα), and inhibits IL-6-mediated signalling which involves 
ubiquitous signal-transducing glycoprotein 130 (gp130) and the Signal Transducer and Activator of 
Transcription-3 (STAT-3).  
In functional human cell-based assays, sarilumab was able to block the IL-6 signalling pathway, 
measured as STAT-3 inhibition, only in the presence of IL-6.  
IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates diverse cellular responses such as proliferation, 
differentiation, survival, and apoptosis and can activate hepatocytes to release acute-phase proteins, 
including C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A. Elevated levels of IL-6 are found in the 
synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and play an important role in both the pathologic 
inflammation and joint destruction which are hallmarks of RA. IL-6 is involved in diverse 
physiological processes such as migration and activation of T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, and 
osteoclasts leading to systemic inflammation, synovial inflammation, and bone erosion in patients with 
RA. 
The activity of sarilumab in reducing inflammation is associated with laboratory changes such as 
decrease in ANC and elevation in lipids (see section 4.4). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Following single-dose subcutaneous (SC) administration of sarilumab 200 mg and 150 mg in patients 
with RA rapid reduction of CRP levels was observed. Levels were reduced to normal as early as 4 
days after treatment initiation. Following single-dose sarilumab administration, in patients with RA, 
ANC decreased to the nadir between 3 to 4 days and thereafter recovered towards baseline (see section 
4.4). Treatment with sarilumab resulted in decreases in fibrinogen and serum amyloid A, and increases 
in haemoglobin and serum albumin. 
Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy and safety of sarilumab were assessed in three randomised, double-blind, controlled 
multicentre studies (MOBILITY and TARGET were placebo-controlled studies and MONARCH was 
an active comparator-controlled study) in patients older than 18 years with moderately to severely 
active rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. 
Patients had at least 8 tender and 6 swollen joints at baseline.

Placebo-controlled studies  
MOBILITY evaluated 1197 patients with RA who had inadequate clinical response to MTX. Patients 
received sarilumab 200 mg, sarilumab 150 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks with concomitant MTX. The 
primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24, 
changes from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score at 
week 16, and change from baseline in van der Heijde-modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at week 52.  
TARGET evaluated 546 patients with RA who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant 
to one or more TNF-α antagonists. Patients received sarilumab 200 mg, sarilumab 150 mg, or placebo 
every 2 weeks with concomitant conventional DMARDs (cDMARDs). The primary endpoints were 
the proportion of patients who achieved an ACR20 response at week 24 and the changes from baseline 
HAQ-DI score at week 12. 
Clinical response 
The percentages of sarilumab + DMARDs-treated patients achieving ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 
responses in MOBILITY and TARGET are shown in Table 4. In both studies, patients treated with 
either 200 mg or 150 mg of sarilumab + DMARDs every two weeks had higher ACR20, ACR50, and 
ACR70 response rates versus placebo-treated patients at week 24.  These responses persisted through 
3 years of therapy in an open-label extension study. 
In MOBILITY, a greater proportion of patients treated with sarilumab 200 mg or 150 mg every two 
weeks plus MTX achieved remission, defined as Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein 
(DAS28-CRP) < 2.6 compared with placebo + MTX at week 52. Results at 24 weeks in TARGET 
were similar to the results at 52 weeks in MOBILITY (see Table 4).

Radiographic response 
In MOBILITY, structural joint damage was assessed radiographically and expressed as change in van 
der Heijde-modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the erosion score, and joint space 
narrowing score at week 52. Radiographs of hands and feet were obtained at baseline, 24 weeks, and 
52 weeks and scored independently by at least two well-trained readers who were blinded to treatment 
group and visit number.  
Both doses of sarilumab + MTX were superior to placebo + MTX in the change from baseline in 
mTSS at 24 and 52 weeks (see Table 6). Less progression of both erosion and joint space narrowing 
scores at 24 and 52 weeks was reported in the sarilumab treatment groups compared to the placebo 
group. 
Treatment with sarilumab + MTX was associated with significantly less radiographic progression of 
structural damage as compared with placebo. At week 52, 55.6% of patients receiving sarilumab 
200 mg and 47.8% of patients receiving sarilumab 150 mg had no progression of structural damage (as 
defined by a change in the TSS of zero or less) compared with 38.7% of patients receiving placebo. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment with sarilumab 200 mg and 150 mg + MTX inhibited the progression of structural damage 
by 91% and 68%, respectively, compared to placebo + MTX at week 52.  
The efficacy of sarilumab with concomitant DMARDs on inhibition of radiographic progression that 
was assessed as part of the primary endpoints at week 52 in MOBILITY was sustained up to three 
years from the start of treatment.

Physical function response 
In MOBILITY and TARGET, physical function and disability were assessed by the Health 
Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg or 
150 mg + DMARDs every two weeks demonstrated greater improvement from baseline in physical 
function compared to placebo at week 16 and week 12 in MOBILITY and TARGET, respectively.  
MOBILITY demonstrated significant improvement in physical function, as measured by the HAQ-DI 
at week 16 compared to placebo (-0.58, -0.54, and -0.30 for sarilumab 200 mg + MTX, sarilumab 
150 mg + MTX, and placebo + MTX, every two weeks, respectively). TARGET demonstrated 
significant improvement in HAQ-DI scores at week 12 compared to placebo (-0.49, -0.50, and -0.29 
for sarilumab 200 mg + DMARDs, sarilumab 150 mg + DMARDs, and placebo + DMARDs, every 
two weeks, respectively). 
In MOBILITY, the improvement in physical functioning as measured by HAQ-DI was maintained up 
to week 52 (-0.75, -0.71, and -0.46 for sarilumab 200 mg + MTX, sarilumab 150 mg + MTX, and 
placebo + MTX treatment groups, respectively).  
Patients treated with sarilumab + MTX (47.6% in the 200 mg treatment group and 47.0% in the 
150 mg treatment group) achieved a clinically relevant improvement in HAQ-DI (change from 
baseline of ≥0.3 units) at week 52 compared to 26.1% in the placebo + MTX treatment group.  
Patient reported outcomes 
General health status was assessed by the Short Form health survey (SF-36). In MOBILITY and 
TARGET, patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg + DMARDs every two weeks or sarilumab 150 mg + 
DMARDs every two weeks demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared to placebo + 
DMARDs in physical component summary (PCS) and no worsening on the mental component

summary (MCS) at week 24. Patients receiving sarilumab 200 mg + DMARDs reported greater 
improvement relative to placebo in the domains of Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, 
General Health Perception, Vitality, Social Functioning, and Mental Health. 
Fatigue was assessed by the FACIT-Fatigue scale. In MOBILITY and TARGET, patients receiving 
sarilumab 200 mg + DMARDs every two weeks or sarilumab 150 mg + DMARDs every two weeks 
demonstrated greater improvement from baseline compared to placebo + DMARDs. 
Active Comparator-controlled Study  
MONARCH was a 24 –week randomised double-blind, double-dummy study that compared sarilumab 
200 mg monotherapy with adalimumab 40 mg monotherapy administered subcutaneously every two 
weeks in 369 patients with moderately to severely active RA who were inappropriate for treatment 
with MTX including those who were intolerant of or inadequate responders to MTX.  
Sarilumab 200 mg was superior to adalimumab 40 mg in reducing disease activity and improving 
physical function, with more patients achieving clinical remission over 24 weeks (see Table 7).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Kevzara (sarilumab) in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in chronic idiopathic arthritis 
(including rheumatoid arthritis, spondylarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis) 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of sarilumab were characterised in 2186 patients with RA treated with 
sarilumab which included 751 patients treated with 150 mg and 891 patients treated with 200 mg 
subcutaneous doses every two weeks for up to 52 weeks.  
Absorption 
The absolute bioavailability for sarilumab after SC injection was estimated to be 80% by population 
PK analysis. The median tmax after a single subcutaneous dose was observed in 2 to 4 days. After 
multiple dosing of 150 to 200 mg every two weeks, steady state was reached in 12 to 16 weeks with a 
2- to 3-fold accumulation compared to single dose exposure. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the 150 mg every two weeks dose regimen, the estimated mean (± standard deviation, SD) steady-
state area under curve (AUC), Cmin, and Cmax of sarilumab were 210 ± 115 mg.day/L, 6.95 ± 
7.60 mg/L, and 20.4 ± 8.27 mg/L, respectively. 
For the 200 mg every two weeks dose regimen, the estimated mean (± SD) steady-state AUC, Cmin and 
Cmax of sarilumab were 396 ± 194 mg.day/L, 16.7 ± 13.5 mg/L, and 35.4 ± 13.9 mg/L, respectively. 
In a usability study sarilumab exposure after 200 mg Q2W was slightly higher (Cmax + 24-34%, 
AUC(0-2w) +7-21%) after use of a pre-filled pen compared to the pre-filled syringe. 
Distribution 
In patients with RA, the apparent volume of distribution at steady state was 8.3 L. 
Biotransformation 
The metabolic pathway of sarilumab has not been characterised. As a monoclonal antibody sarilumab 
is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same 
manner as endogenous IgG.  
Elimination 
Sarilumab is eliminated by parallel linear and non-linear pathways. At higher concentrations, the 
elimination is predominantly through the linear, non-saturable proteolytic pathway, while at lower 
concentrations, non-linear saturable target-mediated elimination predominates. These parallel 
elimination pathways result in an initial half-life of 8 to 10 days, and at steady-state an effective half-
life of 21 days is estimated.  
After the last steady state dose of 150 mg and 200 mg sarilumab, the median times to non-detectable 
concentration are 30 and 49 days, respectively. 
Monoclonal antibodies are not eliminated via renal or hepatic pathways. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
A more than dose-proportional increase in pharmacokinetic exposure was observed in patients with 
RA. At steady state, exposure over the dosing interval measured by AUC increased approximately 2-
fold with a 1.33-fold increase in dose from 150 to 200 mg every two weeks. 
Interactions with CYP450 substrates 
Simvastatin is a CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 substrate. In 17 patients with RA, one week following a 
single 200-mg subcutaneous administration of sarilumab, exposure of simvastatin and simvastatin acid 
decreased by 45% and 36%, respectively (see section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Age, gender, ethnicity and body weight  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses in adult patients with RA (ranging in age from18 to 88 years 
with 14% over 65 years) showed that age, gender and race did not meaningfully influence the 
pharmacokinetics of sarilumab. 
Body weight influenced the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab. In patients with higher body weight 
(>100 Kg) both 150 mg and 200 mg doses demonstrated efficacy; however, patients weighing 
>100 Kg had greater therapeutic benefit with the 200 mg dose. 
Renal impairment 
No formal study of the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab was 
conducted. Mild to moderate renal impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab. No 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe 
renal impairment were not studied. 
Hepatic impairment 
No formal study of the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of sarilumab was 
conducted (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated-dose 
toxicity, carcinogenic risk assessment and toxicity to reproduction and development. 
No long-term animal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenicity potential of 
sarilumab. The weight of evidence for IL-6Rα inhibition mainly indicates anti-tumour effects 
mediated by multiple mechanisms predominantly involving STAT-3 inhibition. In vitro and in vivo 
studies with sarilumab using human tumour cell lines showed inhibition of STAT-3 activation and 
inhibition of tumour growth in human tumour xenograft animal models. 
Fertility studies conducted in male and female mice using a murine surrogate antibody against mouse 
IL-6Rα showed no impairment of fertility.  
In an enhanced pre-/postnatal developmental toxicity study, pregnant Cynomolgus monkeys were 
administered sarilumab once-weekly intravenously from early gestation to natural birth 
(approximately 21 weeks) Maternal exposure up to approximately 83 times the human exposure based 
on AUC after subcutaneous doses of 200 mg every 2 weeks, did not cause any maternal or embryo-
foetal effects. Sarilumab had no effect on maintenance of pregnancy or on the neonates evaluated up to 
1 month after birth in body weight measurements, in parameters of functional or morphological 
development including skeletal evaluations, in immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes, 
and in microscopic evaluations. Sarilumab was detected in the serum of neonates up to 1 month. The 
excretion of sarilumab in Cynomolgus monkey’s milk has not been studied.

This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them,

5.  How to store Kevzara  
6.  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Kevzara is and what it is used for 
What Kevzara is 
Kevzara contains the active substance sarilumab. It is a type of protein called a monoclonal antibody. 
What Kevzara is used for 
Kevzara is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis if previous 
therapy did not work well enough or was not tolerated. Kevzara can be used alone or together with a 
medicine called methotrexate. 
It may help you by: 
• 
• 
slowing down damage to joints 
improving your ability to perform daily activities. 
How Kevzara works 
• 
• 
Kevzara attaches to another protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor and blocks its action. 
IL-6 plays a major role in the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis such as pain, swollen joints, 
morning stiffness, and fatigue. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Kevzara  
Do not use Kevzara: 
• 
if you are allergic to sarilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
if you have an active severe infection. 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if:  
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you have any infection or you get a lot of infections. Kevzara can lower your body's ability to 
fight infection: this means it can make you more likely to get infections or make your infection 
worse. 
you have tuberculosis (TB), symptoms of TB (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild 
fever), or have been in close contact with someone with TB. Before you are given Kevzara, 
your doctor will check you for TB. 
you have had viral hepatitis or other liver disease. Before you use Kevzara, your doctor will do 
a blood test to check your liver function. 
you have had diverticulitis (a condition of the lower bowel) or ulcers in your stomach or 
intestines, or develop symptoms such as fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go 
away. 
you have ever had any type of cancer. 
you have recently had any vaccination or are going to have a vaccination.  
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
using Kevzara. 
You will have blood tests before you are given Kevzara. You will also have the tests during your 
treatment. This is to check for low blood cell count, liver problems, or changes in your cholesterol 
levels. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Kevzara 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used, or might use any other medicines. 
This is because Kevzara can affect the way some other medicines work. Also some other medicines 
can affect the way Kevzara works. 
In particular, do not use Kevzara and tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using: 
• 
a group of medicines called “Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors” (used for diseases like rheumatoid 
 arthritis and cancer) 
other biological medicines used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
Kevzara can affect the way some medicines work: this means the dose of other medicines may need 
changing. If you are using any of the following medicines, tell your doctor or pharmacist before using 
Kevzara: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
statins, used to reduce cholesterol level 
oral contraceptives 
theophylline, used to treat asthma 
warfarin, used to prevent blood clots.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Talk to your doctor before using Kevzara if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be 
pregnant  or are planning to have a baby. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not take Kevzara if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. 
The effects of Kevzara on an unborn baby are not known. 
You and your doctor should decide if you should use Kevzara if you are breast-feeding.

1.  What Kevzara is and what it is used for 
What Kevzara is 
Kevzara contains the active substance sarilumab. It is a type of protein - called a “monoclonal 
antibody”. 
What Kevzara is used for 
Kevzara is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis if previous 
therapy did not work well enough or was not tolerated. Kevzara can be used alone or together with a 
medicine called methotrexate. 
It may help you by: 
• 
• 
slowing down damage to joints 
improving your ability to perform daily activities. 
How Kevzara works 
• 
• 
Kevzara attaches to another protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor and blocks its action. 
IL-6 plays a major role in the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis such as pain, swollen joints, 
morning stiffness, and fatigue. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Kevzara  
Do not use Kevzara: 
• 
if you are allergic to sarilumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have an active severe infection.  
• 
Warnings and precautions

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
you have any infection or, you get a lot of infections. Kevzara can lower your body's ability to 
fight infection and this means it can make you more likely to get infections or make your 
infection worse. 
you have tuberculosis (TB), symptoms of TB (persistent cough, weight loss, listlessness, mild 
fever), or have been in close contact with someone with TB. Before you are given Kevzara, 
your doctor will check you for TB. 
you have had viral hepatitis or other liver disease. Before you use Kevzara, your doctor will do 
a blood test to check your liver function. 
you have had diverticulitis (a condition of the lower bowel) or ulcers in your stomach or 
intestines, or develop symptoms such as fever and stomach (abdominal) pain that does not go 
away. 
you have ever had any type of cancer. 
you have recently had any vaccination or are going to have a vaccination. 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before 
using Kevzara. 
You will have blood tests before you are given Kevzara. You will also have the tests during your 
treatment. This is to check if you have a low blood cell count,   liver problems, or changes in your 
cholesterol levels. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years of age.

Step A: Get ready for an injection 
1. Prepare all the equipment you will need on a clean, flat working surface. 
•  You will need an alcohol wipe, a cotton ball or gauze, and a puncture-resistant container. 
•  Take one pen out of the packaging by holding the middle of the pen body. Keep the remaining 
pen in the carton in the refrigerator. 
2. Look at the label. 
•  Check that you have the correct medicine and the correct dose. 
•  Check the expiry date (EXP), this is shown on the side of the pens. 
 Do not use the pen if the date has passed. 
3. Look at the window. 
•  Check that the liquid is clear and colourless to pale yellow. 
•  You may see an air bubble, this is normal. 
 Do not inject if the liquid is cloudy, discoloured or contains particles.  
 Do not use if the window is solid yellow. 
4. Lay the pen on a flat surface and allow it to warm up to room temperature (<25°C) for at least 
60 minutes. 
82 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Using the pen at room temperature may make the injection more comfortable. 
 Do not use the pen if it has been out of the refrigerator for more than 14 days. 
 Do not heat the pen; let it warm up on its own. 
 Do not expose the pen to direct sunlight. 
5. Select the injection site. 
•  You can inject into your thigh or belly (abdomen) except for the 5 cm around your belly button 
(navel).  If somebody else gives you the injection, you can also use the outer area of the upper 
arm. 
•  Change injection site each time you inject. 
 Do not inject into skin that is tender, damaged or has bruises or scars. 
6. Prepare the injection site. 
•  Wash your hands. 
•  Clean skin with an alcohol wipe. 
 Do not touch the injection site again before the injection.

3. Press down and hold the pen firmly against your skin. 
•  There will be a “click” when the injection starts. 
4. Keep holding the pen firmly against your skin. 
•  The window will start to turn yellow. 
•  The injection can take up to 15 seconds. 
5. There will be a second click. Check to see if the entire window has turned yellow before you 
remove the pen. 
•  If you do not hear the second click, you should still check to see if the window has turned fully 
yellow.  
 If the window does not turn fully yellow, do not give yourself a second dose without speaking 
to your healthcare provider. 
85 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. Pull the pen away from your skin. 
•  If you see any blood, press a cotton ball or gauze on the site. 
 Do not rub your skin after the injection. 
7. Put your used pen and the cap into a puncture-resistant container right away after use. 
•  Always keep the container out of the sight and reach of children. 
 Do not put the cap back on. 
 Do not throw the used pens in household waste.

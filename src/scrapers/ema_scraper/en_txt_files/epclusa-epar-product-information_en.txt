Patients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 3 hours of dosing an additional tablet of 
Epclusa should be taken. If vomiting occurs more than 3 hours after dosing, no further dose of Epclusa 
is needed (see section 5.1). 
If a dose of Epclusa is missed and it is within 18 hours of the normal time, patients should be 
instructed to take the tablet as soon as possible and then patients should take the next dose at the usual 
time. If it is after 18 hours then patients should be instructed to wait and take the next dose of Epclusa 
at the usual time. Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose of Epclusa. 
Adult patients who have previously failed therapy with an NS5A-containing regimen 
Epclusa + ribavirin for 24 weeks may be considered (see section 4.4). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is warranted for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of Epclusa is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.   
Safety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis. Epclusa 
can be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are 
available (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of Epclusa is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic 
impairment (CPT Class A, B, or C) (see section 5.2). Safety and efficacy of Epclusa have been 
assessed in patients with CPT Class B cirrhosis, but not in patients with CPT Class C cirrhosis (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Epclusa in children aged less than 3 years have not been established. No 
data are available. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablet(s) whole with or without food (see section 5.2). Due 
to the bitter taste, it is recommended that film-coated tablets are not chewed or crushed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Medicinal products that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and/or strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
inducers (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort) (see 
section 4.5).  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Epclusa should not be administered concurrently with other medicinal products containing sofosbuvir. 
Severe bradycardia and heart block 
Life-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-
containing regimens are used in combination with amiodarone. Bradycardia has generally occurred 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
within hours to days, but cases with a longer time to onset have been observed mostly up to 2 weeks 
after initiating HCV treatment. 
Amiodarone should only be used in patients on Epclusa when other alternative anti-arrhythmic 
treatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. 
Should concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary, it is recommended that patients 
undergo cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of co-administration, after 
which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the 
first 2 weeks of treatment. 
Due to the long half-life of amiodarone, cardiac monitoring as outlined above should also be carried 
out for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated 
on Epclusa. 
All patients with concurrent or recent use of amiodarone should be warned of the symptoms of 
bradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they 
experience them. 
HCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection 
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after 
treatment with direct-acting antiviral medicinal products. HBV screening should be performed in all 
patients before initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, 
and should, therefore, be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. 
Patients who have previously failed therapy with an NS5A-containing regimen 
There are no clinical data to support the efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for the treatment of patients 
who have failed treatment with a regimen containing another NS5A inhibitor. However, on the basis 
of NS5A resistance associated variants (RAVs) typically seen in patients who have failed therapy with 
other NS5A inhibitor containing regimens, the in vitro pharmacology of velpatasvir, and the outcomes 
of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment in NS5A-naïve patients with baseline NS5A RAVs enrolled into 
the ASTRAL-studies, treatment with Epclusa + RBV for 24 weeks can be considered for patients who 
have failed therapy on an NS5A-containing regimen and who are deemed at high risk for clinical 
disease progression and who do not have alternative treatment options. 
Renal impairment 
Safety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 
ESRD requiring haemodialysis. Epclusa can be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when 
no other relevant treatment options are available (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). When Epclusa is used in 
combination with ribavirin refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for 
patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (see section 5.2). 
Use with moderate P-gp inducers and/or moderate CYP inducers 
Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. efavirenz, modafinil, 
oxcarbazepine or rifapentine) may decrease sofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentrations leading to 
reduced therapeutic effect of Epclusa. Co-administration of such medicinal products with Epclusa is 
not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Use with certain HIV antiretroviral regimens 
Epclusa has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure, especially when used together with an HIV 
regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or 
cobicistat). The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of Epclusa and a pharmacokinetic 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enhancer has not been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with co-administration 
of Epclusa with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing 
elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
given in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be 
considered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving Epclusa 
concomitantly with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for 
tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Refer to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate, or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Summary of 
Product Characteristics for recommendations on renal monitoring. 
Use in diabetic patients 
Diabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic 
patients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the 
first 3 months, and their diabetic treatment modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the 
diabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct-acting antiviral therapy is initiated. 
CPT Class C cirrhosis 
Safety and efficacy of Epclusa has not been assessed in patients with CPT Class C cirrhosis (see 
section 5.1). 
Liver transplant patients 
The safety and efficacy of Epclusa in the treatment of HCV infection in patients who are post-liver 
transplant have not been assessed. Treatment with Epclusa in accordance with the recommended 
posology (see section 4.2) should be guided by an assessment of the potential benefits and risks for the 
individual patient. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
As Epclusa contains sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, any interactions that have been identified with these 
active substances individually may occur with Epclusa. 
Potential for Epclusa to affect other medicinal products 
Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic 
anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3. Co-administration of Epclusa with 
medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters may increase the exposure of such 
medicinal products. See Table 4 for examples of interactions with sensitive substrates of P-gp 
(digoxin), BCRP (rosuvastatin), and OATP (pravastatin). 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect Epclusa 
Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP. Velpatasvir is also a 
substrate of drug transporter OATP1B. In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 was observed. Medicinal products that are strong inducers of P-gp and/or 
strong inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin, 
rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort) may decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir or 
velpatasvir leading to reduced therapeutic effect of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. The use of such medicinal 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
products with Epclusa is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate 
P-gp inducers and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. efavirenz, modafinil, oxcarbazepine or rifapentine) 
may decrease sofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentration leading to reduced therapeutic effect of 
Epclusa. Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended with Epclusa (see 
section 4.4). Co-administration with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp or BCRP may increase 
sofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentrations. Medicinal products that inhibit OATP, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 may increase plasma concentration of velpatasvir. Clinically significant 
medicinal product interactions with Epclusa mediated by P-gp, BCRP, OATP, or CYP450 inhibitors 
are not expected; Epclusa may be co-administered with P-gp, BCRP, OATP and CYP inhibitors. 
Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists 
As liver function may change during treatment with Epclusa, a close monitoring of International 
Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. 
Impact of DAA therapy on medicinal products metabolized by the liver 
The pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. 
immunosuppressive medicinal products such as calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in 
liver function during DAA therapy, related to clearance of HCV. 
Interactions between Epclusa and other medicinal products 
Table 4 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product 
interactions (where 90% confidence interval [CI] of the geometric least-squares mean [GLSM] ratio 
were within “↔”, extended above “↑”, or extended below “↓” the predetermined interaction 
boundaries). The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with either 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or velpatasvir and sofosbuvir as individual agents, or are predicted medicinal 
product interactions that may occur with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. The table is not all-inclusive.

Co-administration of amiodarone 
with a sofosbuvir containing 
regimen may result in serious 
symptomatic bradycardia. 
Use only if no other alternative is 
available. Close monitoring is 
recommended if this medicinal 
product is administered with 
Epclusa (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Co-administration of Epclusa with 
digoxin may increase the 
concentration of digoxin. Caution 
is warranted and therapeutic 
concentration monitoring of 
digoxin is recommended when 
co-administered with Epclusa. 
Clinical monitoring, looking for 
signs of bleeding and anaemia, is 
recommended when dabigatran 
etexilate is co-administered with 
Epclusa. A coagulation test helps 
to identify patients with an 
increased bleeding risk due to 
increased dabigatran exposure. 
Close monitoring of INR is 
recommended with all vitamin K 
antagonists. This is due to liver 
function changes during treatment 
with Epclusa. 
Epclusa is contraindicated with 
phenobarbital and phenytoin (see 
section 4.3). 
Epclusa is contraindicated with 
carbamazepine (see section 4.3). 
Co-administration of Epclusa with 
oxcarbazepine is expected to 
decrease the concentration of 
sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, leading 
to reduced therapeutic effect of 
Epclusa. Co-administration is not 
recommended (see section 4.4).

increase in tenofovir exposure (AUC and Cmax) was around 40-80% during co-
treatment with Epclusa and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine as part of 
various HIV regimens. 
Patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and Epclusa concomitantly 
should be monitored for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate. Refer to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing product’s 
Summary of Product Characteristics for recommendations on renal monitoring 
(see section 4.4).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of sofosbuvir, 
velpatasvir or Epclusa in pregnant women. 
Sofosbuvir 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
It has not been possible to fully estimate exposure margins achieved for sofosbuvir in the rat relative 
to the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3). 
Velpatasvir 
Animal studies have shown a possible link to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, Epclusa use is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether sofosbuvir, metabolites of sofosbuvir or velpatasvir are excreted in human 
milk. 
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of velpatasvir and metabolites of 
sofosbuvir in milk. 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, Epclusa should not be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of Epclusa on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate 
harmful effects of sofosbuvir or velpatasvir on fertility. 
If ribavirin is co-administered with Epclusa, refer to the Summary of Product Characterisitics for 
ribavirin for detailed recommendations regarding pregnancy, contraception, and breast-feeding. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Epclusa has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile of Epclusa has been determined in pooled Phase 3 clinical studies of patients with 
genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 HCV infection and in the postmarketing setting. No adverse drug reactions 
to Epclusa were identified from clinical studies. In the postmarketing setting, cases of severe 
bradycardia and heart block have been observed when SOF-containing products are used in 
combination with amiodarone, and HBV reactivation has been observed in patients coinfected with 
HCV/HBV following treatment with DAAs (see section 4.4).

Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
Assessment of adverse reactions for Epclusa is based on safety data from clinical studies and 
postmarketing experience. All adverse reactions are presented in Table 5. The adverse reactions are 
listed below by system organ class and frequency.  Frequencies are defined as follows: very common 
(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000) 
or very rare (< 1/10,000).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Cardiac arrhythmias 
Cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-containing regimens 
are used in combination with amiodarone and/or other medicinal products that lower heart rate (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Skin disorders 
Frequency not known: Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
Paediatric population 
The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of Epclusa in 
adults. Vomiting was observed as a very common adverse drug reaction to Epclusa in paediatric 
patients aged 3 to < 6 years. The safety assessment of Epclusa in paediatric patients aged 3 years and 
older is based on data from a Phase 2, open-label clinical study (study 1143) that enrolled 216 patients 
who were treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest documented doses of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir were a single dose of 1,200 mg and a 
single dose of 500 mg, respectively. In these healthy adult volunteer studies, there were no untoward 
effects observed at these dose levels. The effects of higher doses/exposures are not known. 
No specific antidote is available for overdose with Epclusa. If overdose occurs the patient must be 
monitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with Epclusa consists of general supportive 
measures including monitoring of vital signs, as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. 
Haemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir, 
GS-331007, with an extraction ratio of 53%. Haemodialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal 
of velpatasvir, since velpatasvir is highly bound to plasma protein.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; Direct acting antiviral, ATC code: J05AP55 
Mechanism of action 
Sofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is 
essential for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular 
metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analogue triphosphate (GS-461203), which 
can be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. 
GS-461203 (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and 
RNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. 
Velpatasvir is a HCV inhibitor targeting the HCV NS5A protein, which is essential for both RNA 
replication and the assembly of HCV virions. In vitro resistance selection and cross-resistance studies 
indicate velpatasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action. 
Antiviral activity 
The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir against full-length or 
chimeric replicons encoding NS5B and NS5A sequences from the laboratory strains are presented in 
Table 6. The EC50 values of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir against clinical isolates are presented in 
Table 7.

The presence of 40% human serum had no effect on the anti-HCV activity of sofosbuvir but reduced 
the anti-HCV activity of velpatasvir by 13-fold against genotype 1a HCV replicons. 
Evaluation of sofosbuvir in combination with velpatasvir showed no antagonistic effect in reducing 
HCV RNA levels in replicon cells. 
Resistance 
In cell culture 
HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple 
genotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a. Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated 
with the primary NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined. Site-directed 
mutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of genotype 1 to 6 conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced 
susceptibility to sofosbuvir and reduced the replication viral capacity by 89% to 99% compared to the 
corresponding wild-type. In biochemical assays, the ability of the active triphosphate of sofosbuvir 
(GS-461203) to inhibit recombinant NS5B polymerase from genotypes 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a expressing 
the S282T substitution was reduced compared to its ability to inhibit wild-type recombinant NS5B 
polymerase, as indicated by a 8.5- to 24-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). 
In vitro selection of HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir was performed in cell 
culture for multiple genotypes including 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a. Variants were selected at NS5A 
resistance associated positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 58, 92 and 93.  The resistance associated variants 
(RAVs) selected in 2 or more genotypes were F28S, L31I/V and Y93H. Site-directed mutagenesis of 
known NS5A RAVs showed that substitutions conferring a > 100-fold reduction in velpatasvir 
susceptibility are M28G, A92K and Y93H/N/R/W in genotype 1a, A92K in genotype 1b, C92T and 
Y93H/N in genotype 2b, Y93H in genotype 3, and L31V and P32A/L/Q/R in genotype 6. No 
individual substitutions tested in genotypes 2a, 4a, or 5a conferred a > 100-fold reduction in 
velpatasvir susceptibility. Combinations of these variants often showed greater reductions in 
susceptibility to velpatasvir than single RAVs alone. 
In clinical studies 
Studies in patients without cirrhosis and patients with compensated cirrhosis 
In a pooled analysis of patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who received Epclusa 
for 12 weeks in three Phase 3 studies, 12 patients (2 with genotype 1 and 10 with genotype 3) qualified 
for resistance analysis due to virologic failure. One additional patient with genotype 3 HCV infection 
at baseline was reinfected with genotype 1a HCV at virologic failure and was excluded from the 
virological analysis. No patients with genotype 2, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection experienced virologic 
failure. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of the 2 genotype 1 virologic failure patients, one patient had virus with emergent NS5A RAV Y93N 
and the other patient had virus with emergent NS5A RAVs L31I/V and Y93H at virologic failure. 
Both patients had virus at baseline harbouring NS5A RAVs.  No NS5B nucleoside inhibitor (NI) 
RAVs were observed at failure in the 2 patients. 
Of the 10 genotype 3 virologic failure patients, Y93H was observed in all 10 patients at failure (6 had 
Y93H emerge post-treatment and 4 patients had Y93H at baseline and post-treatment). No 
NS5B NI RAVs were observed at failure in the 10 patients. 
Studies in patients with decompensated cirrhosis 
In one Phase 3 study in patients with decompensated cirrhosis who received Epclusa + RBV for 
12 weeks, 3 patients (1 with genotype 1 and 2 with genotype 3) qualified for resistance analysis due to 
virologic failure. No patients with genotype 2 or 4 HCV infection in the Epclusa + RBV 12 weeks 
group experienced virologic failure. 
The 1 virologic failure patient with genotype 1 HCV had no NS5A or NS5B RAVs at failure. 
Of the 2 genotype 3 virologic failure patients, one had NS5A RAV Y93H emerge at failure. Another 
patient had virus with Y93H at baseline and virologic failure and also developed low levels (< 5%) of 
NS5B NI RAVs N142T and E237G at failure. Pharmacokinetic data from this patient was consistent 
with non-adherence to treatment. 
In this study, 2 patients treated with Epclusa for 12 or 24 weeks without ribavirin had emergent NS5B 
S282T at low levels (< 5%) along with L159F. 
Effect of baseline HCV resistance-associated variants on treatment outcome 
Studies in patients without cirrhosis and patients with compensated cirrhosis 
Analyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A RAVs and 
treatment outcome for patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in three Phase 3 
clinical studies (ASTRAL-1, ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3). Of the 1,035 patients treated with 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in the three Phase 3 clinical studies, 1,023 patients were included in the analysis 
of NS5A RAVs; 7 patients were excluded as they neither achieved sustained virologic response 
(SVR12) nor had virologic failure and 5 additional patients were excluded as NS5A gene sequencing 
failed. In the pooled analysis of the Phase 3 studies, 380/1,023 (37%) patients’ virus had baseline 
NS5A RAVs. Genotype 2, 4, and 6 HCV-infected patients had a higher prevalence of NS5A RAVs 
(70%, 63% and 52%, respectively) compared to genotype 1 (23%), genotype 3 (16%), and genotype 5 
(18%) HCV-infected patients. 
Baseline RAVs had no relevant impact on SVR12 rates in patients infected with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5 
and 6 HCV, as summarised in Table 8. Genotype 3 infected patients with the NS5A RAV Y93H at 
baseline had a lower SVR12 rate than patients without Y93H after treatment with Epclusa for 
12 weeks, as summarised in Table 9. In the ASTRAL-3 study, the Y93H RAV was detected at 
baseline in 9% of patients treated with Epclusa.

The NS5B NI RAV S282T was not detected in the baseline NS5B sequence of any patient in Phase 3 
studies. SVR12 was achieved in all 77 patients who had baseline NS5B NI RAVs including N142T, 
L159F, E/N237G, C/M289L/I, L320F/I/V, V321A/I, and S282G+V321I. 
Studies in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (CPT Class B) 
Analyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A RAVs and 
treatment outcome for patients with decompensated cirrhosis in one Phase 3 study (ASTRAL-4). Of 
the 87 patients treated with Epclusa + RBV, 85 patients were included in the analysis of NS5A RAVs; 
2 patients were excluded as they neither achieved SVR12 nor had virologic failure. Among the 
patients who received treatment with Epclusa + RBV for 12 weeks, 29% (25/85) of patients had 
baseline virus with NS5A RAVs: 29% (19/66), 75% (3/4), 15% (2/13), and 50% (1/2) for patients with 
genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 HCV, respectively. 
SVR12 in patients with or without baseline NS5A RAVs in the Epclusa + RBV 12 week group for this 
study is shown in Table 10.

Epclusa + RBV 12 weeks 
The single genotype 3 patient who had baseline NS5A RAVs and failed to achieve SVR12 had NS5A 
substitution Y93H at baseline; pharmacokinetic data from this patient was consistent with 
non-adherence to treatment. 
Three patients in the Epclusa + RBV 12 week group had baseline NS5B NI RAVs (N142T and 
L159F) and all three patients achieved SVR12. 
Paediatric population 
The presence of NS5A and NS5B RAVs did not impact treatment outcome; all patients with baseline 
NS5A (n=29) or NS5B NI (n=6) RAVs achieved SVR following 12 weeks treatment with Epclusa.  
Cross-resistance 
In vitro data suggests that the majority of NS5A RAVs that confer resistance to ledipasvir and 
daclatasvir remained susceptible to velpatasvir. Velpatasvir was fully active against the sofosbuvir 
resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B while all velpatasvir resistance-associated 
substitutions in NS5A were fully susceptible to sofosbuvir. Both sofosbuvir and velpatasvir were fully 
active against substitutions associated with resistance to other classes of direct-acting antivirals with 
different mechanisms of actions, such as NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitors and NS3 protease inhibitors.

The efficacy of Epclusa has not been assessed in patients who have previously failed treatment with 
other regimens that include an NS5A inhibitor. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Epclusa was evaluated in three Phase 3 studies in patients with genotype 1 to 6 HCV 
infection with or without compensated cirrhosis, one Phase 3 study in patients with genotype 1 to 6 
HCV infection with decompensated cirrhosis, one Phase 3 study in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients 
with genotype 1 to 6 HCV infection and one Phase 2 study in patients with HCV infection and ESRD 
requiring dialysis, as summarised in Table 11.

The ribavirin dose was weight-based (1,000 mg daily administered in two divided doses for patients 
< 75 kg and 1,200 mg for those ≥ 75 kg) and administered in two divided doses when used in 
combination with sofosbuvir in the ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3 studies or in combination with 
Epclusa in the ASTRAL-4 study. Ribavirin dose adjustments were performed according to the 
ribavirin prescribing information. Serum HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical studies 
using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman HCV test (version 2.0) with a lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) of 15 IU/mL. Sustained virologic response (SVR12), defined as HCV RNA 
less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the cessation of treatment, was the primary endpoint to determine 
the HCV cure rate. 
Clinical studies in patients without cirrhosis and patients with compensated cirrhosis 
Genotype 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 HCV-infected adults – ASTRAL-1 (study 1138) 
ASTRAL-1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 12 weeks of 
treatment with Epclusa compared with 12 weeks of placebo in patients with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 
HCV infection. Patients with genotype 1, 2, 4 or 6 HCV infection were randomised in a 5:1 ratio to 
treatment with Epclusa for 12 weeks or placebo for 12 weeks.  Patients with genotype 5 HCV 
infection were enrolled to the Epclusa group. Randomisation was stratified by HCV genotype (1, 2, 4, 
6, and indeterminate) and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the Epclusa and placebo group. Of 
the 740 treated patients, the median age was 56 years (range: 18 to 82); 60% of the patients were male; 
79% were White, 9% were Black; 21% had a baseline body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2; the 
proportions of patients with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection were 53%, 17%, 19%, 5% and 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7%, respectively; 69% had non-CC IL28B alleles (CT or TT); 74% had baseline HCV RNA levels of

Genotype 2 HCV-infected adults – ASTRAL-2 (study 1139) 
ASTRAL-2 was a randomised, open-label study that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with Epclusa 
compared with 12 weeks of treatment with SOF+RBV in patients with genotype 2 HCV infection. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with Epclusa for 12 weeks or SOF+RBV for 
12 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by the presence or absence of cirrhosis and prior treatment 
experience (treatment-naïve versus treatment-experienced). 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across the two treatment groups. Of the 266 
treated patients, the median age was 58 years (range: 23 to 81); 59% of the patients were male; 88% 
were White, 7% were Black; 33% had a baseline body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2; 62% had

Clinical studies in patients with HCV/HIV-1 Co-infection – ASTRAL-5 (study 1202) 
ASTRAL-5 evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with Epclusa in patients with genotype 1, 2, 3, or 4 HCV 
infection who were co-infected with HIV-1 (HCV genotype 5 and 6 allowed, but no such patients 
were included). Patients were on a stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy that included 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or abacavir/lamivudine administered with a ritonavir 
boosted protease inhibitor (atazanavir, darunavir, or lopinavir), rilpivirine, raltegravir or 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate /elvitegravir/cobicistat. 
Of the 106 treated patients, the median age was 57 years (range: 25 to 72); 86% of the patients were 
male; 51% were White; 45% were Black; 22% had a baseline body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2; 19 patients 
(18%) had compensated cirrhosis; and 29% were treatment experienced. The overall mean CD4+ 
count was 598 cells/µL (range: 183−1513 cells/µL).

SVR12 was achieved by 19/19 patients with cirrhosis. No patient had HIV-1 rebound during the study, 
and CD4+ counts were stable during treatment. 
Clinical studies in patients with Renal Impairment – study 4062 
Study 4062 was an open-label clinical study that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with Epclusa in 59 
HCV-infected patients with ESRD requiring dialysis. The proportions of patients with genotype 1, 2, 
3, 4, 6 or indeterminate HCV infection were 42%, 12%, 27%, 7%, 3%, and 9%, respectively. At 
baseline, 29% of patients had cirrhosis, 22% were treatment experienced, 32% had received a kidney 
transplant, 92% were on haemodialysis, and 8% were on peritoneal dialysis; mean duration on dialysis 
was 7.3 years (range: 0 to 40 years). The overall SVR rate was 95% (56/59); of the three patients that 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
did not achieve SVR12, one had completed Epclusa treatment and relapsed and two did not meet 
virologic failure criteria. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in HCV-infected paediatric patients 
aged 3 years and older was evaluated in a Phase 2, open-label clinical study in 214 patients with HCV 
infection.  
Patients aged 12 to < 18 Years:  
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was evaluated in 102 patients aged 12 to <18 years with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, or 
6 HCV infection. A total of 80 patients (78%) were treatment-naïve and 22 patients (22%) were 
treatment-experienced. The median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 51% of the patients were 
female; 73% were White, 9% were Black, and 11% were Asian; 14% were Hispanic/Latino; mean 
body mass index was 22.7 kg/m2 (range: 12.9 to 48.9 kg/m2); mean weight was 61 kg 
(range 22 to 147 kg); 58% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; the 
proportions of subjects with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 HCV infection were 74%, 6%, 12%, 2%, and 6%, 
respectively; no patients had known cirrhosis. The majority of patients (89%) had been infected 
through vertical transmission.  
The SVR rate was 95% overall (97/102), 93% (71/76) in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, and 
100% in patients with genotype 2 (6/6), genotype 3 (12/12), genotype 4 (2/2), and genotype 6 (6/6) 
HCV infection. One patient who discontinued treatment early relapsed; the other four patients who did 
not achieve SVR12 did not meet virologic failure criteria (e.g., lost to follow-up).  
Patients aged 6 to < 12 Years:  
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was evaluated in 71 patients aged 6 to <12 years with genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4 
HCV infection. A total of 67 patients (94%) were treatment-naïve and 4 patients (6%) were treatment-
experienced. The median age was 8 years (range: 6 to 11); 54% of the patients were female; 90% were 
White, 6% were Black, and 1% were Asian; 10% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body mass index was 
17.4 kg/m2 (range: 12.8 to 30.9 kg/m2); mean weight was 30 kg (range 18 to 78 kg); 48% had baseline 
HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU per mL; the proportions of patients with 
genotype 1, 2, 3, or 4 HCV infection were 76%, 3%, 15%, and 6%, respectively; no patients had 
known cirrhosis. The majority of patients (94%) had been infected through vertical transmission.  
The SVR rate was 93% overall (66/71), 93% (50/54) in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, 91% 
(10/11) in patients with genotype 3 HCV infection, and 100% in patients with genotype 2 (2/2) and 
genotype 4 (4/4) HCV infection. One subject had on-treatment virologic failure; the other four patients 
who did not achieve SVR12 did not meet virologic failure criteria (e.g., lost to follow-up). 
Patients aged 3 to < 6 Years:  
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was evaluated in 41 treatment-naïve subjects 3 years to < 6 years of age with 
genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4 HCV infection. The median age was 4 years (range: 3 to 5); 59% of the 
subjects were female; 78% were White and 7% were Black; 10% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body 
mass index was 17.0 kg/m2 (range: 13.9 to 22.0 kg/m2); mean weight was 19 kg (range: 13 to 35 kg); 
49% had baseline HCV RNA levels ≥ 800,000 IU per mL; the proportions of subjects with genotype 1, 
2, 3, or 4 HCV infection were 78%, 15%, 5%, and 2%, respectively; no subjects had known cirrhosis. 
The majority of subjects (98%) had been infected through vertical transmission. 
The SVR rate was 83% overall (34/41), 88% (28/32) in subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection, 50% 
(3/6) in subjects with genotype 2 HCV infection, and 100% in subjects with genotype 3 (2/2) and 
genotype 4 (1/1) HCV infection. No subject experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse. The 
seven subjects who did not achieve SVR12 did not meet virologic failure criteria (e.g., lost to follow-
up).

Elderly 
Clinical studies of Epclusa included 156 patients aged 65 and over (12% of total number of patients in 
the Phase 3 clinical studies). The response rates observed for patients ≥ 65 years of age were similar to 
that of patients < 65 years of age, across treatment groups. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetic properties of sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir have been evaluated in 
healthy adult subjects and in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Following oral administration of 
Epclusa, sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and the peak median plasma concentration was observed 
1 hour post-dose. Median peak plasma concentration of GS-331007 was observed 3 hours post-dose. 
Velpatasvir median peak concentrations were observed at 3 hours post-dose. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients, mean steady-state 
AUC0-24 for sofosbuvir (n = 982), GS-331007 (n = 1,428) and velpatasvir (n = 1,425) were 1,260, 
13,970 and 2,970 ng•h/mL, respectively. Steady-state Cmax for sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir 
were 566, 868 and 259 ng/mL, respectively. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-24 and Cmax were 
similar in healthy adult subjects and patients with HCV infection. Relative to healthy subjects 
(n = 331), velpatasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax were 37% lower and 41% lower, respectively in HCV-infected 
patients. 
Effects of food 
Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of Epclusa with a moderate fat 
(~600 kcal, 30% fat) or high fat (~800 kcal, 50% fat) meal resulted in a 34% and 21% increase in 
velpatasvir AUC0-inf, respectively, and a 31% and 5% increase in velpatasvir Cmax, respectively. The 
moderate or high fat meal increased sofosbuvir AUC0-inf by 60% and 78%, respectively, but did not 
substantially affect the sofosbuvir Cmax. The moderate or high fat meal did not alter GS-331007 
AUC0-inf, but resulted in a 25% and 37% decrease in its Cmax, respectively. The response rates in 
Phase 3 studies were similar in HCV-infected patients who received Epclusa with food or without 
food. Epclusa can be administered without regard to food. 
Distribution 
Sofosbuvir is approximately 61-65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent 
of drug concentration over the range of 1 µg/mL to 20 µg/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was 
minimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the 
blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. 
Velpatasvir is > 99.5% bound to human plasma proteins and binding is independent of drug 
concentration over the range of 0.09 µg/mL to 1.8 µg/mL. After a single 100 mg dose of 
[14C]-velpatasvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity ranged between 
0.52 and 0.67. 
Biotransformation 
Sofosbuvir is extensively metabolised in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside 
analog triphosphate GS-461203. The metabolic activation pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of 
the carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A (CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and 
phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by 
phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation results in the 
formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks 
anti-HCV activity in vitro. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not substrates or inhibitors of UGT1A1 or 
CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzymes. After a single 
400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, GS-331007 accounted for approximately > 90% of total 
systemic exposure. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Velpatasvir is a substrate of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 with slow turnover. Following a single 
dose of 100 mg [14C]-velpatasvir, the majority (> 98%) of radioactivity in plasma was parent drug. 
The monohydroxylated and desmethylated velpatasvir were the metabolites identified in human 
plasma. Unchanged velpatasvir is the major species present in faeces. 
Elimination 
Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the [14C]-radioactivity 
was greater than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, 
and expired air, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 
(78%) while 3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. These data indicate that renal clearance is the major 
elimination pathway for GS-331007. The median terminal half-lives of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 
following administration of Epclusa were 0.5 and 25 hours, respectively. 
Following a single 100 mg oral dose of [14C]-velpatasvir, mean total recovery of the 
[14C]-radioactivity was 95%, consisting of approximately 94% and 0.4% recovered from the faeces 
and urine, respectively. Unchanged velpatasvir was the major species in faeces accounting for a mean 
of 77% of the administered dose, followed by monohydroxylated velpatasvir (5.9%) and 
desmethylated velpatasvir (3.0%). These data indicate that biliary excretion of parent drug was a major 
route of elimination for velpatasvir. The median terminal half-life of velpatasvir following 
administration of Epclusa was approximately 15 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Velpatasvir AUC increases in a nearly dose proportional manner over the dose range of 25 mg to 
150 mg. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUCs are near dose-proportional over the dose range of 200 mg 
to 1,200 mg. 
In vitro potential for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir drug-drug interactions 
Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. 
Velpatasvir is also a substrate of OATP1B. In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 was observed. 
Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and its 
involvement in drug interactions with these transporters is primarily limited to the process of 
absorption. At clinically relevant plasma concentration, velpatasvir is not an inhibitor of hepatic 
transporters bile salt export pump (BSEP), sodium taurocholate cotransporter protein (NTCP), 
OATP2B1, OATP1A2 or organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, renal transporters OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, 
multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) or multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) 1, 
or CYP or uridine glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzymes. 
Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1.  GS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2, and MATE1. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Race and gender 
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to race or gender have been identified for 
sofosbuvir, GS-331007 or velpatasvir. 
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients showed that within the age range (18 to 
82 years) analysed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir, 
GS-331007, or velpatasvir.

The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir was studied in HCV negative adult patients with mild (eGFR ≥ 50 
and < 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal impairment 
(eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following a single 
400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, relative to patients with normal renal function 
(eGFR > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). GS-331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction 
coefficient of approximately 53%. Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4 hour 
haemodialysis removed 18% of administered dose. 
In HCV-infected patients with severe renal impairment treated with sofosbuvir 200 mg with ribavirin 
(n=10) or sofosbuvir 400 mg with ribavirin (n=10) for 24 weeks or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 90/400 mg 
(n=18) for 12 weeks, the pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were consistent with that 
observed in HCV negative adult patients with severe renal impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir was studied with a single dose of 100 mg velpatasvir in HCV 
negative patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault). 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir, GS-331007, and velpatasvir were studied in HCV-infected 
patients with ESRD requiring dialysis treated with Epclusa (n=59) for 12 weeks, and compared to 
patients without renal impairment in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir Phase 2/3 studies. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir was studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in 
HCV-infected adult patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B and C). 
Relative to patients with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher 
in moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 18% and 9% higher, 
respectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected adult patients indicated that 
cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to 
sofosbuvir and GS-331007. 
The pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir was studied with a single dose of 100 mg velpatasvir in HCV 
negative adult patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B and C). Compared 
to subjects with normal hepatic function velpatasvir total plasma exposure (AUCinf) was similar in 
patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in 
HCV-infected patients indicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically 
relevant effect on the exposure to velpatasvir (see section 4.2).  
Body weight 
In adults, body weight did not have a clinically significant effect on sofosbuvir or velpatasvir exposure 
according to a population pharmacokinetic analysis.

Paediatric population 
Sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir exposures in paediatric patients aged 3 years and older 
receiving oral once daily doses of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 400 mg/100 mg, 200 mg/50 mg or 
150 mg/37.5 mg per day were similar to those in adults receiving once daily doses of 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 400 mg/100 mg. 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir in paediatric patients aged less than 
3 years have not been established (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Sofosbuvir 
Exposure to sofosbuvir in rodent studies could not be detected likely due to high esterase activity and 
exposure to the major metabolite GS-331007 was instead used to estimate exposure margins. 
Sofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial 
mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse 
micronucleus assays. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat and rabbit developmental toxicity 
studies with sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir had no adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction, or development 
of the offspring in the rat pre- and post-natal development study. 
Sofosbuvir was not a carcinogen in the 2-year mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies at GS-331007 
exposures up to 15 and 9 times, respectively, higher than human exposure. 
Velpatasvir 
Velpatasvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial 
mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat 
micronucleus assays. 
Velpatasvir was not carcinogenic in the 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse and 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity studies at exposures at least 50-times and 5-times higher than human exposure, 
respectively. 
Velpatasvir had no adverse effects on mating and fertility. No teratogenic effects were observed in the 
mouse and rat developmental toxicity studies with velpatasvir at AUC exposures approximately 31- 
and 6-fold higher, respectively, than the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. However, 
a possible teratogenic effect was indicated in rabbits where an increase in total visceral malformations 
was seen in exposed animals at AUC exposures up to 0.7-fold the human exposure at recommended 
clinical dose. The human relevance of this finding is not known. Velpatasvir had no adverse effects on 
behaviour, reproduction, or development of the offspring in the rat pre- and post-natal development 
study at AUC exposures approximately 5-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose.

Patients should be instructed that if vomiting occurs within 3 hours of dosing an additional dose of 
Epclusa should be taken. If vomiting occurs more than 3 hours after dosing, no further dose of Epclusa 
is needed (see section 5.1). 
If a dose of Epclusa is missed and it is within 18 hours of the normal time, patients should be 
instructed to take the additional dose as soon as possible and then patients should take the next dose at 
the usual time. If it is after 18 hours then patients should be instructed to wait and take the next dose of 
Epclusa at the usual time. Patients should be instructed not to take a double dose of Epclusa. 
Adult patients who have previously failed therapy with an NS5A-containing regimen 
Epclusa + ribavirin for 24 weeks may be considered (see section 4.4). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is warranted for elderly patients (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of Epclusa is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.   
Safety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis. Epclusa 
can be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when no other relevant treatment options are 
available (see sections 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of Epclusa is required for patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic 
impairment (CPT Class A, B, or C) (see section 5.2). Safety and efficacy of Epclusa has been assessed 
in patients with CPT Class B cirrhosis, but not in patients with CPT Class C cirrhosis (see sections 4.4 
and 5.1). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Epclusa in children aged less than 3 years has not been established.  No data 
are available. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
Epclusa can be taken with or without food. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To help with swallowing of the Epclusa oral granules you can use food or water as detailed below. 
Alternatively, Epclusa oral granules can be swallowed without food or water. 
Taking Epclusa oral granules with food to aid swallowing 
To administer with food to aid swallowability of the granules, patients should be instructed to sprinkle 
the granules on one or more spoonfuls of non-acidic soft food at or below room temperature. Patients 
should be instructed to take the Epclusa oral granules within 15 minutes of gently mixing with food 
and to swallow the entire contents without chewing to avoid a bitter taste. Examples of non-acidic 
foods include chocolate syrup and ice-cream.  
Taking Epclusa oral granules with water to aid swallowing 
To administer with water, patients should be instructed that the granules can be taken directly into the 
mouth and swallowed with water. Patients should be instructed to swallow the entire contents of the 
sachet(s) without chewing. 
Taking Epclusa oral granules without food or water 
To administer without food or water, patients should be instructed that the granules can be taken 
directly into the mouth and swallowed. Patients should be instructed to swallow the entire contents of 
the sachet(s) without chewing (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Medicinal products that are strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and/or strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
inducers (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort) (see 
section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Epclusa should not be administered concurrently with other medicinal products containing sofosbuvir. 
Severe bradycardia and heart block 
Life-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir-
containing regimens are used in combination with amiodarone. Bradycardia has generally occurred 
within hours to days, but cases with a longer time to onset have been observed mostly up to 2 weeks 
after initiating HCV treatment. 
Amiodarone should only be used in patients on Epclusa when other alternative anti-arrhythmic 
treatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. 
Should concomitant use of amiodarone be considered necessary, it is recommended that patients 
undergo cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of co-administration, after 
which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the 
first 2 weeks of treatment. 
Due to the long half-life of amiodarone, cardiac monitoring as outlined above should also be carried 
out for patients who have discontinued amiodarone within the past few months and are to be initiated 
on Epclusa. 
All patients with concurrent or recent use of amiodarone should be warned of the symptoms of 
bradycardia and heart block and should be advised to seek medical advice urgently should they 
experience them. 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HCV/HBV (hepatitis B virus) co-infection 
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, some of them fatal, have been reported during or after 
treatment with direct-acting antiviral medicinal products. HBV screening should be performed in all 
patients before initiation of treatment. HBV/HCV co-infected patients are at risk of HBV reactivation, 
and should therefore be monitored and managed according to current clinical guidelines. 
Patients who have previously failed therapy with an NS5A-containing regimen 
There are no clinical data to support the efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for the treatment of patients 
who have failed treatment with a regimen containing another NS5A inhibitor. However, on the basis 
of NS5A resistance associated variants (RAVs) typically seen in patients who have failed therapy with 
other NS5A inhibitor containing regimens, the in vitro pharmacology of velpatasvir, and the outcomes 
of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment in NS5A-naïve patients with baseline NS5A RAVs enrolled into 
the ASTRAL-studies, treatment with Epclusa + RBV for 24 weeks can be considered for patients who 
have failed therapy on an NS5A-containing regimen and who are deemed at high risk for clinical 
disease progression and who do not have alternative treatment options. 
Renal impairment 
Safety data are limited in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 
ESRD requiring haemodialysis. Epclusa can be used in these patients with no dose adjustment when 
no other relevant treatment options are available (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). When Epclusa is used in 
combination with ribavirin refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics for ribavirin for 
patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (see section 5.2). 
Use with moderate P-gp inducers and/or moderate CYP inducers 
Medicinal products that are moderate P-gp and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. efavirenz, modafinil, 
oxcarbazepine or rifapentine) may decrease sofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentrations leading to 
reduced therapeutic effect of Epclusa. Co-administration of such medicinal products with Epclusa is 
not recommended (see section 4.5). 
Use with certain HIV antiretroviral regimens 
Epclusa has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure, especially when used together with an HIV 
regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or 
cobicistat). The safety of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the setting of Epclusa and a pharmacokinetic 
enhancer has not been established. The potential risks and benefits associated with co-administration 
of Epclusa with the fixed-dose combination tablet containing 
elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 
given in conjunction with a boosted HIV protease inhibitor (e.g. atazanavir or darunavir) should be 
considered, particularly in patients at increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving Epclusa 
concomitantly with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or with 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and a boosted HIV protease inhibitor should be monitored for 
tenofovir-associated adverse reactions. Refer to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate, or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate Summary of 
Product Characteristics for recommendations on renal monitoring. 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use in diabetic patients 
Diabetics may experience improved glucose control, potentially resulting in symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia, after initiating HCV direct-acting antiviral treatment. Glucose levels of diabetic 
patients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy should be closely monitored, particularly within the 
first 3 months, and their diabetic treatment modified when necessary. The physician in charge of the 
diabetic care of the patient should be informed when direct-acting antiviral therapy is initiated. 
CPT Class C cirrhosis 
Safety and efficacy of Epclusa has not been assessed in patients with CPT Class C cirrhosis (see 
section 5.1). 
Liver transplant patients 
The safety and efficacy of Epclusa in the treatment of HCV infection in patients who are post-liver 
transplant have not been assessed. Treatment with Epclusa in accordance with the recommended 
posology (see section 4.2) should be guided by an assessment of the potential benefits and risks for the 
individual patient. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
As Epclusa contains sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, any interactions that have been identified with these 
active substances individually may occur with Epclusa. 
Potential for Epclusa to affect other medicinal products 
Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic 
anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3. Co-administration of Epclusa with 
medicinal products that are substrates of these transporters may increase the exposure of such 
medicinal products. See Table 4 for examples of interactions with sensitive substrates of P-gp 
(digoxin), BCRP (rosuvastatin), and OATP (pravastatin). 
Potential for other medicinal products to affect Epclusa 
Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP. Velpatasvir is also a 
substrate of drug transporter OATP1B. In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 was observed. Medicinal products that are strong inducers of P-gp and/or 
strong inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin, 
rifampicin, rifabutin and St. John’s wort) may decrease plasma concentrations of sofosbuvir or 
velpatasvir leading to reduced therapeutic effect of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. The use of such medicinal 
products with Epclusa is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Medicinal products that are moderate 
P-gp inducers and/or moderate CYP inducers (e.g. efavirenz, modafinil, oxcarbazepine or rifapentine) 
may decrease sofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentration leading to reduced therapeutic effect of 
Epclusa. Co-administration with such medicinal products is not recommended with Epclusa (see 
section 4.4). Co-administration with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp or BCRP may increase 
sofosbuvir or velpatasvir plasma concentrations. Medicinal products that inhibit OATP, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 may increase plasma concentration of velpatasvir. Clinically significant 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medicinal product interactions with Epclusa mediated by P-gp, BCRP, OATP, or CYP450 inhibitors 
are not expected; Epclusa may be co-administered with P-gp, BCRP, OATP and CYP inhibitors. 
Patients treated with vitamin K antagonists 
As liver function may change during treatment with Epclusa, a close monitoring of International 
Normalised Ratio (INR) values is recommended. 
Impact of DAA therapy on medicinal products metabolized by the liver 
The pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are metabolized by the liver (e.g. 
immunosuppressive medicinal products such as calcineurin inhibitors) may be impacted by changes in 
liver function during DAA therapy, related to clearance of HCV. 
Interactions between Epclusa and other medicinal products 
Table 4 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant medicinal product 
interactions (where 90% confidence interval [CI] of the geometric least-squares mean [GLSM] ratio 
were within “↔”, extended above “↑”, or extended below “↓” the predetermined interaction 
boundaries). The medicinal product interactions described are based on studies conducted with either 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or velpatasvir and sofosbuvir as individual agents, or are predicted medicinal 
product interactions that may occur with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. The table is not all-inclusive.

Clinical monitoring, looking for 
signs of bleeding and anaemia, is 
recommended when dabigatran 
etexilate is co-administered with 
Epclusa. A coagulation test helps 
to identify patients with an 
increased bleeding risk due to 
increased dabigatran exposure. 
Close monitoring of INR is 
recommended with all vitamin K 
antagonists. This is due to liver 
function changes during treatment 
with Epclusa. 
Epclusa is contraindicated with 
phenobarbital and phenytoin (see 
section 4.3). 
Epclusa is contraindicated with 
carbamazepine (see section 4.3). 
Co-administration of Epclusa with 
oxcarbazepine is expected to 
decrease the concentration of 
sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, leading 
to reduced therapeutic effect of 
Epclusa. Co-administration is not 
recommended (see section 4.4). 
No dose adjustment of Epclusa or

Epclusa has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure (P-gp-inhibition). The 
increase in tenofovir exposure (AUC and Cmax) was around 40-80% during co-
treatment with Epclusa and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine as part of 
various HIV regimens. 
Patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and Epclusa concomitantly 
should be monitored for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate. Refer to the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-containing product’s

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of sofosbuvir, 
velpatasvir or Epclusa in pregnant women. 
Sofosbuvir 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
It has not been possible to fully estimate exposure margins achieved for sofosbuvir in the rat relative 
to the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3). 
Velpatasvir 
Animal studies have shown a possible link to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, Epclusa use is not recommended during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether sofosbuvir, metabolites of sofosbuvir or velpatasvir are excreted in human 
milk. 
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of velpatasvir and metabolites of 
sofosbuvir in milk. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Therefore, Epclusa should not be used during 
breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of Epclusa on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate 
harmful effects of sofosbuvir or velpatasvir on fertility. 
If ribavirin is co-administered with Epclusa, refer to the Summary of Product Characterisitics for 
ribavirin for detailed recommendations regarding pregnancy, contraception, and breast-feeding. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Epclusa has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile of Epclusa has been determined in pooled Phase 3 clinical studies of patients with 
genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 HCV infection and in the postmarketing setting.  No adverse drug reactions 
to Epclusa were identified from clinical studies.  In the postmarketing setting, cases of severe 
bradycardia and heart block have been observed when SOF-containing products are used in 
combination with amiodarone, and HBV reactivation has been observed in patients coinfected with 
HCV/HBV following treatment with DAAs (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
Assessment of adverse reactions for Epclusa is based on safety data from clinical studies and 
postmarketing experience. All adverse reactions are presented in Table 5. The adverse reactions are 
listed below by system organ class and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common 
(≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1000) 
or very rare (< 1/10,000).

Paediatric population 
The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical studies of Epclusa in 
adults. Vomiting was observed as a very common adverse drug reaction to Epclusa in paediatric 
patients aged 3 to < 6 years. The safety assessment of Epclusa in paediatric patients aged 3 years and 
older is based on data from a Phase 2, open-label clinical study (study 1143) that enrolled 216 patients 
who were treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The highest documented doses of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir were a single dose of 1,200 mg and a 
single dose of 500 mg, respectively. In these healthy adult volunteer studies, there were no untoward 
effects observed at these dose levels. The effects of higher doses/exposures are not known. 
No specific antidote is available for overdose with Epclusa.  If overdose occurs the patient must be 
monitored for evidence of toxicity. Treatment of overdose with Epclusa consists of general supportive 
measures including monitoring of vital signs, as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. 
Haemodialysis can efficiently remove the predominant circulating metabolite of sofosbuvir, 
GS-331007, with an extraction ratio of 53%. Haemodialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal 
of velpatasvir, since velpatasvir is highly bound to plasma protein.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use; Direct acting antiviral, ATC code: J05AP55 
Mechanism of action 
Sofosbuvir is a pan-genotypic inhibitor of the HCV NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is 
essential for viral replication. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide prodrug that undergoes intracellular 
metabolism to form the pharmacologically active uridine analogue triphosphate (GS-461203), which 
can be incorporated into HCV RNA by the NS5B polymerase and acts as a chain terminator. 
GS-461203 (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) is neither an inhibitor of human DNA and 
RNA polymerases nor an inhibitor of mitochondrial RNA polymerase. 
Velpatasvir is a HCV inhibitor targeting the HCV NS5A protein, which is essential for both RNA 
replication and the assembly of HCV virions. In vitro resistance selection and cross-resistance studies 
indicate velpatasvir targets NS5A as its mode of action. 
Antiviral activity 
The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir against full-length or 
chimeric replicons encoding NS5B and NS5A sequences from the laboratory strains are presented in 
Table 6. The EC50 values of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir against clinical isolates are presented in 
Table 7.

The presence of 40% human serum had no effect on the anti-HCV activity of sofosbuvir but reduced 
the anti-HCV activity of velpatasvir by 13-fold against genotype 1a HCV replicons. 
Evaluation of sofosbuvir in combination with velpatasvir showed no antagonistic effect in reducing 
HCV RNA levels in replicon cells. 
Resistance 
In cell culture 
HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir have been selected in cell culture for multiple 
genotypes including 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a. Reduced susceptibility to sofosbuvir was associated 
with the primary NS5B substitution S282T in all replicon genotypes examined. Site-directed 
mutagenesis of the S282T substitution in replicons of genotype 1 to 6 conferred 2- to 18-fold reduced 
susceptibility to sofosbuvir and reduced the replication viral capacity by 89% to 99% compared to the 
corresponding wild-type. In biochemical assays, the ability of the active triphosphate of sofosbuvir 
(GS-461203) to inhibit recombinant NS5B polymerase from genotypes 1b, 2a, 3a and 4a expressing 
the S282T substitution was reduced compared to its ability to inhibit wild-type recombinant NS5B 
polymerase, as indicated by a 8.5- to 24-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50).

In vitro selection of HCV replicons with reduced susceptibility to velpatasvir was performed in cell 
culture for multiple genotypes including 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a. Variants were selected at NS5A 
resistance associated positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 58, 92 and 93. The resistance associated variants 
(RAVs) selected in 2 or more genotypes were F28S, L31I/V and Y93H. Site-directed mutagenesis of 
known NS5A RAVs showed that substitutions conferring a > 100-fold reduction in velpatasvir 
susceptibility are M28G, A92K and Y93H/N/R/W in genotype 1a, A92K in genotype 1b, C92T and 
Y93H/N in genotype 2b, Y93H in genotype 3, and L31V and P32A/L/Q/R in genotype 6. No 
individual substitutions tested in genotypes 2a, 4a, or 5a conferred a > 100-fold reduction in 
velpatasvir susceptibility. Combinations of these variants often showed greater reductions in 
susceptibility to velpatasvir than single RAVs alone. 
In clinical studies 
Studies in patients without cirrhosis and patients with compensated cirrhosis 
In a pooled analysis of patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis who received Epclusa 
for 12 weeks in three Phase 3 studies, 12 patients (2 with genotype 1 and 10 with genotype 3) qualified 
for resistance analysis due to virologic failure. One additional patient with genotype 3 HCV infection 
at baseline was reinfected with genotype 1a HCV at virologic failure and was excluded from the 
virological analysis. No patients with genotype 2, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection experienced virologic 
failure. 
Of the 2 genotype 1 virologic failure patients, one patient had virus with emergent NS5A RAV Y93N 
and the other patient had virus with emergent NS5A RAVs L31I/V and Y93H at virologic failure.  
Both patients had virus at baseline harbouring NS5A RAVs. No NS5B nucleoside inhibitor (NI) 
RAVs were observed at failure in the 2 patients. 
Of the 10 genotype 3 virologic failure patients, Y93H was observed in all 10 patients at failure (6 had 
Y93H emerge post-treatment and 4 patients had Y93H at baseline and post-treatment). No 
NS5B NI RAVs were observed at failure in the 10 patients. 
Studies in patients with decompensated cirrhosis 
In one Phase 3 study in patients with decompensated cirrhosis who received Epclusa + RBV for 
12 weeks, 3 patients (1 with genotype 1 and 2 with genotype 3) qualified for resistance analysis due to 
virologic failure. No patients with genotype 2 or 4 HCV infection in the Epclusa + RBV 12 weeks 
group experienced virologic failure. 
The 1 virologic failure patient with genotype 1 HCV had no NS5A or NS5B RAVs at failure. 
Of the 2 genotype 3 virologic failure patients, one had NS5A RAV Y93H emerge at failure. Another 
patient had virus with Y93H at baseline and virologic failure and also developed low levels (< 5%) of 
NS5B NI RAVs N142T and E237G at failure. Pharmacokinetic data from this patient was consistent 
with non-adherence to treatment. 
In this study, 2 patients treated with Epclusa for 12 or 24 weeks without ribavirin had emergent NS5B 
S282T at low levels (< 5%) along with L159F. 
Effect of baseline HCV resistance-associated variants on treatment outcome 
Studies in patients without cirrhosis and patients with compensated cirrhosis 
Analyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A RAVs and 
treatment outcome for patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in three Phase 3 
clinical studies (ASTRAL-1, ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3). Of the 1,035 patients treated with 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in the three Phase 3 clinical studies, 1,023 patients were included in the analysis 
of NS5A RAVs; 7 patients were excluded as they neither achieved sustained virologic response 
(SVR12) nor had virologic failure and 5 additional patients were excluded as NS5A gene sequencing 
failed. In the pooled analysis of the Phase 3 studies, 380/1,023 (37%) patients’ virus had baseline 
NS5A RAVs.  Genotype 2, 4, and 6 HCV-infected patients had a higher prevalence of NS5A RAVs 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(70%, 63% and 52%, respectively) compared to genotype 1 (23%), genotype 3 (16%), and genotype 5 
(18%) HCV-infected patients. 
Baseline RAVs had no relevant impact on SVR12 rates in patients infected with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5 
and 6 HCV, as summarised in Table 8. Genotype 3 infected patients with the NS5A RAV Y93H at 
baseline had a lower SVR12 rate than patients without Y93H after treatment with Epclusa for 
12 weeks, as summarised in Table 9. In the ASTRAL-3 study, the Y93H RAV was detected at 
baseline in 9% of patients treated with Epclusa.

The NS5B NI RAV S282T was not detected in the baseline NS5B sequence of any patient in Phase 3 
studies. SVR12 was achieved in all 77 patients who had baseline NS5B NI RAVs including N142T, 
L159F, E/N237G, C/M289L/I, L320F/I/V, V321A/I, and S282G+V321I. 
Studies in patients with decompensated cirrhosis (CPT Class B) 
Analyses were conducted to explore the association between pre-existing baseline NS5A RAVs and 
treatment outcome for patients with decompensated cirrhosis in one Phase 3 study (ASTRAL-4). Of 
the 87 patients treated with Epclusa + RBV, 85 patients were included in the analysis of NS5A RAVs; 
2 patients were excluded as they neither achieved SVR12 nor had virologic failure. Among the 
patients who received treatment with Epclusa + RBV for 12 weeks, 29% (25/85) of patients had 
baseline virus with NS5A RAVs: 29% (19/66), 75% (3/4), 15% (2/13), and 50% (1/2) for patients with 
genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 HCV, respectively. 
SVR12 in patients with or without baseline NS5A RAVs in the Epclusa + RBV 12 week group for this 
study is shown in Table 10.

The single genotype 3 patient who had baseline NS5A RAVs and failed to achieve SVR12 had NS5A 
substitution Y93H at baseline; pharmacokinetic data from this patient was consistent with 
non-adherence to treatment. 
Three patients in the Epclusa + RBV 12 week group had baseline NS5B NI RAVs (N142T and 
L159F) and all three patients achieved SVR12. 
Paediatric population 
The presence of NS5A and NS5B RAVs did not impact treatment outcome; all patients with baseline 
NS5A (n=29) or NS5B NI (n=6) RAVs achieved SVR following 12 weeks treatment with Epclusa. 
Cross-resistance 
In vitro data suggests that the majority of NS5A RAVs that confer resistance to ledipasvir and 
daclatasvir remained susceptible to velpatasvir. Velpatasvir was fully active against the sofosbuvir 
resistance-associated substitution S282T in NS5B while all velpatasvir resistance-associated 
substitutions in NS5A were fully susceptible to sofosbuvir. Both sofosbuvir and velpatasvir were fully 
active against substitutions associated with resistance to other classes of direct-acting antivirals with 
different mechanisms of actions, such as NS5B non-nucleoside inhibitors and NS3 protease inhibitors. 
The efficacy of Epclusa has not been assessed in patients who have previously failed treatment with 
other regimens that include an NS5A inhibitor. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of Epclusa was evaluated in three Phase 3 studies in patients with genotype 1 to 6 HCV 
infection with or without compensated cirrhosis, one Phase 3 study in patients with genotype 1 to 6 
HCV infection with decompensated cirrhosis, one Phase 3 study in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients 
with genotype 1 to 6 HCV infection and one Phase 2 study in patients with HCV infection and ESRD 
requiring dialysis, as summarised in Table 11.

combination with sofosbuvir in the ASTRAL-2 and ASTRAL-3 studies or in combination with 
Epclusa in the ASTRAL-4 study. Ribavirin dose adjustments were performed according to the 
ribavirin prescribing information. Serum HCV RNA values were measured during the clinical studies 
using the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS Taqman HCV test (version 2.0) with a lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ) of 15 IU/mL. Sustained virologic response (SVR12), defined as HCV RNA 
less than LLOQ at 12 weeks after the cessation of treatment, was the primary endpoint to determine 
the HCV cure rate. 
Clinical studies in patients without cirrhosis and patients with compensated cirrhosis 
Genotype 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 HCV-infected adults – ASTRAL-1 (study 1138) 
ASTRAL-1 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 12 weeks of 
treatment with Epclusa compared with 12 weeks of placebo in patients with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 
HCV infection. Patients with genotype 1, 2, 4 or 6 HCV infection were randomised in a 5:1 ratio to 
treatment with Epclusa for 12 weeks or placebo for 12 weeks. Patients with genotype 5 HCV infection 
were enrolled to the Epclusa group. Randomisation was stratified by HCV genotype (1, 2, 4, 6, and 
indeterminate) and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the Epclusa and placebo group. Of 
the 740 treated patients, the median age was 56 years (range: 18 to 82); 60% of the patients were male; 
79% were White, 9% were Black; 21% had a baseline body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2; the 
proportions of patients with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 HCV infection were 53%, 17%, 19%, 5% and 
7%, respectively; 69% had non-CC IL28B alleles (CT or TT); 74% had baseline HCV RNA levels of 
at least 800,000 IU/mL; 19% had compensated cirrhosis; and 32% were treatment-experienced.

ASTRAL-2 was a randomised, open-label study that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with Epclusa 
compared with 12 weeks of treatment with SOF+RBV in patients with genotype 2 HCV infection. 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with Epclusa for 12 weeks or SOF+RBV for

ASTRAL-4 was a randomised, open-label study in patients with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 HCV 
infection and CPT Class B cirrhosis. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with 
Epclusa for 12 weeks, Epclusa + RBV for 12 weeks or Epclusa for 24 weeks. Randomisation was 
stratified by HCV genotype (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and indeterminate).

were White, 6% were Black; 42% had a baseline body mass index of at least 30 kg/m2. The 
proportions of patients with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6 HCV were 78%, 4%, 15%, 3%, and < 1% 
(1 patient), respectively. No patients with genotype 5 HCV infection were enrolled. 76% of the 
patients had non-CC IL28B alleles (CT or TT); 56% had baseline HCV RNA levels of at least 
800,000 IU/mL, 55% were treatment-experienced; 90% and 95% of patients had CPT Class B 
cirrhosis and Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score ≤ 15 at baseline, respectively.

Clinical studies in patients with HCV/HIV-1 Co-infection – ASTRAL-5 (study 1202) 
ASTRAL-5 evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with Epclusa in patients with genotype 1, 2, 3, or 4 HCV 
infection who were co-infected with HIV-1 (HCV genotype 5 and 6 allowed, but no such patients 
were included). Patients were on a stable HIV-1 antiretroviral therapy that included 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or abacavir/lamivudine administered with a ritonavir 
boosted protease inhibitor (atazanavir, darunavir, or lopinavir), rilpivirine, raltegravir or 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate /elvitegravir/cobicistat. 
Of the 106 treated patients, the median age was 57 years (range: 25 to 72); 86% of the patients were 
male; 51% were white; 45% were black; 22% had a baseline body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2; 19 patients 
(18%) had compensated cirrhosis; and 29% were treatment experienced. The overall mean CD4+ 
count was 598 cells/µL (range: 183−1513 cells/µL).

SVR12 was achieved by 19/19 patients with cirrhosis. No patient had HIV-1 rebound during the study, 
and CD4+ counts were stable during treatment. 
Clinical studies in patients with Renal Impairment – study 4062 
Study 4062 was an open-label clinical study that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment with Epclusa in 59 
HCV-infected patients with ESRD requiring dialysis. The proportions of patients with genotype 1, 2, 
3, 4, 6 or indeterminate HCV infection were 42%, 12%, 27%, 7%, 3%, and 9%, respectively. At 
baseline, 29% of patients had cirrhosis, 22% were treatment experienced, 32% had received a kidney 
transplant, 92% were on haemodialysis, and 8% were on peritoneal dialysis; mean duration on dialysis 
was 7.3 years (range: 0 to 40 years). The overall SVR rate was 95% (56/59); of the three patients that 
did not achieve SVR12, one had completed Epclusa treatment and relapsed and two did not meet 
virologic failure criteria. 
Paediatric population 
The efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in HCV-infected paediatric patients 
aged 3 years and older was evaluated in a Phase 2, open-label clinical study in 214 patients with HCV 
infection.  
Patients aged 12 to < 18 Years:  
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was evaluated in 102 patients aged 12 to <18 years with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, or 
6 HCV infection. A total of 80 patients (78%) were treatment-naïve and 22 patients (22%) were 
treatment-experienced. The median age was 15 years (range: 12 to 17); 51% of the patients were 
female; 73% were White, 9% were Black, and 11% were Asian; 14% were Hispanic/Latino; mean 
body mass index was 22.7 kg/m2 (range: 12.9 to 48.9 kg/m2); mean weight was 61 kg 
(range 22 to 147 kg); 58% had baseline HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU/mL; the 
proportions of subjects with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 HCV infection were 74%, 6%, 12%, 2%, and 6%, 
respectively; no patients had known cirrhosis. The majority of patients (89%) had been infected 
through vertical transmission.  
The SVR rate was 95% overall (97/102), 93% (71/76) in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, and 
100% in patients with genotype 2 (6/6), genotype 3 (12/12), genotype 4 (2/2), and genotype 6 (6/6) 
HCV infection. One patient who discontinued treatment early relapsed; the other four patients who did 
not achieve SVR12 did not meet virologic failure criteria (e.g., lost to follow-up).  
Patients aged 6 to < 12 Years:  
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was evaluated in 71 patients aged 6 to <12 years with genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4 
HCV infection. A total of 67 patients (94%) were treatment-naïve and 4 patients (6%) were treatment-
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experienced. The median age was 8 years (range: 6 to 11); 54% of the patients were female; 90% were 
White, 6% were Black, and 1% were Asian; 10% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body mass index was 
17.4 kg/m2 (range: 12.8 to 30.9 kg/m2); mean weight was 30 kg (range 18 to 78 kg); 48% had baseline 
HCV RNA levels greater than or equal to 800,000 IU per mL; the proportions of patients with 
genotype 1, 2, 3, or 4 HCV infection were 76%, 3%, 15%, and 6%, respectively; no patients had 
known cirrhosis. The majority of patients (94%) had been infected through vertical transmission.  
The SVR rate was 93% overall (66/71), 93% (50/54) in patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, 91% 
(10/11) in patients with genotype 3 HCV infection, and 100% in patients with genotype 2 (2/2) and 
genotype 4 (4/4) HCV infection. One subject had on-treatment virologic failure; the other four patients 
who did not achieve SVR12 did not meet virologic failure criteria (e.g., lost to follow-up). 
Patients aged 3 to < 6 Years:  
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was evaluated in 41 treatment-naïve subjects 3 years to <6 years of age with 
genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4 HCV infection. The median age was 4 years (range: 3 to 5); 59% of the 
subjects were female; 78% were White and 7% were Black; 10% were Hispanic/Latino; mean body 
mass index was 17.0 kg/m2 (range: 13.9 to 22.0 kg/m2); mean weight was 19  kg (range: 13 to 35 kg); 
49% had baseline HCV RNA levels ≥ 800,000 IU per mL; the proportions of subjects with genotype 1, 
2, 3, or 4 HCV infection were 78%, 15%, 5%, and 2%, respectively; no subjects had known cirrhosis. 
The majority of subjects (98%) had been infected through vertical transmission. 
The SVR rate was 83% overall (34/41), 88% (28/32) in subjects with genotype 1 HCV infection, 50% 
(3/6) in subjects with genotype 2 HCV infection, and 100% in subjects with genotype 3 (2/2) and 
genotype 4 (1/1) HCV infection. No subject experienced on-treatment virologic failure or relapse. The 
seven subjects who did not achieve SVR12 did not meet virologic failure criteria (e.g., lost to follow-
up). 
Elderly 
Clinical studies of Epclusa included 156 patients aged 65 and over (12% of total number of patients in 
the Phase 3 clinical studies). The response rates observed for patients ≥ 65 years of age were similar to 
that of patients < 65 years of age, across treatment groups. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The pharmacokinetic properties of sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir have been evaluated in 
healthy adult subjects and in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Following oral administration of 
Epclusa, sofosbuvir was absorbed quickly and the peak median plasma concentration was observed 
1 hour post-dose. Median peak plasma concentration of GS-331007 was observed 3 hours post-dose. 
Velpatasvir median peak concentrations were observed at 3 hours post-dose. 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients, mean steady-state 
AUC0-24 for sofosbuvir (n = 982), GS-331007 (n = 1,428) and velpatasvir (n = 1,425) were 1,260, 
13,970 and 2,970 ng•h/mL, respectively. Steady-state Cmax for sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir 
were 566, 868 and 259 ng/mL, respectively. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUC0-24 and Cmax were 
similar in healthy adult subjects and patients with HCV infection. Relative to healthy subjects 
(n = 331), velpatasvir AUC0-24 and Cmax were 37% lower and 41% lower, respectively in HCV-infected 
patients. 
Effects of food 
Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of Epclusa with a moderate fat 
(~600 kcal, 30% fat) or high fat (~800 kcal, 50% fat) meal resulted in a 34% and 21% increase in 
velpatasvir AUC0-inf, respectively, and a 31% and 5% increase in velpatasvir Cmax, respectively. The 
moderate or high fat meal increased sofosbuvir AUC0-inf by 60% and 78%, respectively, but did not 
substantially affect the sofosbuvir Cmax. The moderate or high fat meal did not alter GS-331007 
AUC0-inf, but resulted in a 25% and 37% decrease in its Cmax, respectively. The response rates in 
58 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Phase 3 studies were similar in HCV-infected patients who received Epclusa with food or without 
food. Epclusa can be administered without regard to food. 
Distribution 
Sofosbuvir is approximately 61-65% bound to human plasma proteins and the binding is independent 
of drug concentration over the range of 1 µg/mL to 20 µg/mL. Protein binding of GS-331007 was 
minimal in human plasma. After a single 400 mg dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir in healthy subjects, the 
blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity was approximately 0.7. 
Velpatasvir is > 99.5% bound to human plasma proteins and binding is independent of drug 
concentration over the range of 0.09 µg/mL to 1.8 µg/mL. After a single 100 mg dose of 
[14C]-velpatasvir in healthy subjects, the blood to plasma ratio of [14C]-radioactivity ranged between 
0.52 and 0.67. 
Biotransformation 
Sofosbuvir is extensively metabolised in the liver to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside 
analog triphosphate GS-461203. The metabolic activation pathway involves sequential hydrolysis of 
the carboxyl ester moiety catalysed by human cathepsin A (CatA) or carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) and 
phosphoramidate cleavage by histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) followed by 
phosphorylation by the pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. Dephosphorylation results in the 
formation of nucleoside metabolite GS-331007 that cannot be efficiently rephosphorylated and lacks 
anti-HCV activity in vitro. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not substrates or inhibitors of UGT1A1 or 
CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzymes. After a single 
400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, GS-331007 accounted for approximately > 90% of total 
systemic exposure. 
Velpatasvir is a substrate of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 with slow turnover. Following a single 
dose of 100 mg [14C]-velpatasvir, the majority (> 98%) of radioactivity in plasma was parent drug. 
The monohydroxylated and desmethylated velpatasvir were the metabolites identified in human 
plasma. Unchanged velpatasvir is the major species present in faeces. 
Elimination 
Following a single 400 mg oral dose of [14C]-sofosbuvir, mean total recovery of the [14C]-radioactivity 
was greater than 92%, consisting of approximately 80%, 14%, and 2.5% recovered in urine, faeces, 
and expired air, respectively. The majority of the sofosbuvir dose recovered in urine was GS-331007 
(78%) while 3.5% was recovered as sofosbuvir. These data indicate that renal clearance is the major 
elimination pathway for GS-331007.The median terminal half-lives of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 
following administration of Epclusa were 0.5 and 25 hours, respectively. 
Following a single 100 mg oral dose of [14C]-velpatasvir, mean total recovery of the 
[14C]-radioactivity was 95%, consisting of approximately 94% and 0.4% recovered from the faeces 
and urine, respectively. Unchanged velpatasvir was the major species in faeces accounting for a mean 
of 77% of the administered dose, followed by monohydroxylated velpatasvir (5.9%) and 
desmethylated velpatasvir (3.0%). These data indicate that biliary excretion of parent drug was a major 
route of elimination for velpatasvir. The median terminal half-life of velpatasvir following 
administration of Epclusa was approximately 15 hours. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Velpatasvir AUC increases in a nearly dose proportional manner over the dose range of 25 mg to 
150 mg. Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 AUCs are near dose-proportional over the dose range of 200 mg 
to 1,200 mg.

In vitro potential for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir drug-drug interactions 
Sofosbuvir and velpatasvir are substrates of drug transporters P-gp and BCRP while GS-331007 is not. 
Velpatasvir is also a substrate of OATP1B. In vitro, slow metabolic turnover of velpatasvir by 
CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 was observed. 
Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporter P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and its 
involvement in drug interactions with these transporters is primarily limited to the process of 
absorption. At clinically relevant plasma concentration, velpatasvir is not an inhibitor of hepatic 
transporters bile salt export pump (BSEP), sodium taurocholate cotransporter protein (NTCP), 
OATP2B1, OATP1A2 or organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, renal transporters OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, 
multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) or multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) 1, 
or CYP or uridine glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 enzymes. 
Sofosbuvir and GS-331007 are not inhibitors of drug transporters P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and OCT1. GS-331007 is not an inhibitor of OAT1, OCT2, and MATE1. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Race and gender 
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences due to race or gender have been identified for 
sofosbuvir, GS-331007 or velpatasvir. 
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HCV-infected patients showed that within the age range (18 to 
82 years) analysed, age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure to sofosbuvir, 
GS-331007, or velpatasvir. 
Renal impairment 
A summary of the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment (RI) on the exposures of the

The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir was studied in HCV negative adult patients with mild (eGFR ≥ 50 
and < 80 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2), severe renal impairment 
(eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis following a single 
400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, relative to patients with normal renal function 
(eGFR > 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). GS-331007 is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction 
coefficient of approximately 53%. Following a single 400 mg dose of sofosbuvir, a 4 hour 
haemodialysis removed 18% of administered dose. 
In HCV-infected patients with severe renal impairment treated with sofosbuvir 200 mg with ribavirin 
(n=10) or sofosbuvir 400 mg with ribavirin (n=10) for 24 weeks or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 90/400 mg

(n=18) for 12 weeks, the pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 were consistent with that 
observed in HCV negative adult patients with severe renal impairment. 
The pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir was studied with a single dose of 100 mg velpatasvir in HCV 
negative patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault). 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir, GS-331007, and velpatasvir were studied in HCV-infected 
patients with ESRD requiring dialysis treated with Epclusa (n=59) for 12 weeks, and compared to 
patients without renal impairment in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir Phase 2/3 studies. 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir was studied following 7-day dosing of 400 mg sofosbuvir in 
HCV-infected adult patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B and C). 
Relative to patients with normal hepatic function, the sofosbuvir AUC0-24 was 126% and 143% higher 
in moderate and severe hepatic impairment, while the GS-331007 AUC0-24 was 18% and 9% higher, 
respectively. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in HCV-infected adult patients indicated that 
cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically relevant effect on the exposure to 
sofosbuvir and GS-331007. 
The pharmacokinetics of velpatasvir was studied with a single dose of 100 mg velpatasvir in HCV 
negative adult patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment (CPT Class B and C). Compared 
to subjects with normal hepatic function velpatasvir total plasma exposure (AUCinf) was similar in 
patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Population pharmacokinetics analysis in 
HCV-infected patients indicated that cirrhosis (including decompensated cirrhosis) had no clinically 
relevant effect on the exposure to velpatasvir (see section 4.2).  
Body weight 
In adults, body weight did not have a clinically significant effect on sofosbuvir or velpatasvir exposure 
according to a population pharmacokinetic analysis. 
Paediatric population 
Sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir exposures in paediatric patients aged 3 years and older 
receiving oral once daily doses of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 400 mg/100 mg, 200 mg/50 mg or 
150 mg/37.5 mg per day were similar to those in adults receiving once daily doses of 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 400 mg/100 mg. 
The pharmacokinetics of sofosbuvir, GS-331007 and velpatasvir in paediatric patients aged less than 3 
years have not been established (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Sofosbuvir 
Exposure to sofosbuvir in rodent studies could not be detected likely due to high esterase activity and 
exposure to the major metabolite GS-331007 was instead used to estimate exposure margins. 
Sofosbuvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial 
mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo mouse 
micronucleus assays. No teratogenic effects were observed in the rat and rabbit developmental toxicity 
studies with sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir had no adverse effects on behaviour, reproduction, or development 
of the offspring in the rat pre- and post-natal development study. 
Sofosbuvir was not a carcinogen in the 2-year mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies at GS-331007 
exposures up to 15 and 9 times, respectively, higher than human exposure. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Velpatasvir 
Velpatasvir was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays, including bacterial 
mutagenicity, chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in vivo rat 
micronucleus assays. 
Velpatasvir was not carcinogenic in the 6-month rasH2 transgenic mouse and 2-year rat 
carcinogenicity studies at exposures at least 50-times and 5-times higher than human exposure, 
respectively. 
Velpatasvir had no adverse effects on mating and fertility.  No teratogenic effects were observed in the 
mouse and rat developmental toxicity studies with velpatasvir at AUC exposures approximately 31- 
and 6-fold higher, respectively, than the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose. However, 
a possible teratogenic effect was indicated in rabbits where an increase in total visceral malformations 
was seen in exposed animals at AUC exposures up to 0.7-fold the human exposure at recommended 
clinical dose. The human relevance of this finding is not known. Velpatasvir had no adverse effects on 
behaviour, reproduction, or development of the offspring in the rat pre- and post-natal development 
study at AUC exposures approximately 5-fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose.

Contents of the pack and other information 
If Epclusa has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet 
is addressed to your child (in this case please read “your child” instead of “you”). 
1.  What Epclusa is and what it is used for 
Epclusa is a medicine that contains the active substances sofosbuvir and velpatasvir. Epclusa is given 
to treat chronic (long-term) hepatitis C virus infection in adults and children aged 3  years and older. 
The active substances in this medicine work together by blocking two different proteins that the virus 
needs to grow and reproduce itself, allowing the infection to be permanently eliminated from the body. 
It is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with 
Epclusa. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Epclusa 
Do not take Epclusa 
• 
If you are allergic to sofosbuvir, velpatasvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6 of this leaflet). 
 If this applies to you, do not take Epclusa and tell your doctor immediately. 
• 
If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: 
• 
• 
• 
rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); 
St. John’s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures). 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor if you: 
• 
have liver problems other than from hepatitis C, for instance 
• 
if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor 
may want to monitor you more closely; 
if you have had a liver transplant 
• 
have kidney problems or if you are on kidney dialysis, since Epclusa has not been fully 
tested in patients with some severe kidney problems; 
are taking treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, since your doctor 
may want to monitor you more closely. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Epclusa if: 
• 
you currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat 
irregular heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor 
may consider different treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Epclusa is 
needed, you may require additional heart monitoring. 
you have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or 
adjustment of your diabetes medicines after starting Epclusa. Some diabetic patients have 
experienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with 
medicines like Epclusa. 
• 
• 
• 
Tell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months any medicines 
for heart problems and during treatment you experience: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; 
shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; 
chest pain; 
light-headedness; 
palpitations; 
near fainting or fainting. 
Blood tests 
Your doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Epclusa. This is so that: 
• 
• 
Your doctor can decide if you should take Epclusa and for how long; 
Your doctor can confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C 
virus. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age. The use of Epclusa in patients under 
3 years of age has not been studied. 
Other medicines and Epclusa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Warfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists are used to thin the blood. Your 
doctor may need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. 
Your liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other 
medications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to 
closely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting Epclusa. 
If you are not sure talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some medicines should not be taken with Epclusa. 
• 
Do not take with any other medicine that contains sofosbuvir, one of the active substances 
in Epclusa. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the medicines below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
amiodarone used to treat irregular heartbeats; 
rifapentine (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); 
oxcarbazepine (medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures); 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or any medicine containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, used 
to treat HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B; 
efavirenz used to treat HIV infection; 
digoxin used to treat heart conditions; 
dabigatran used to thin the blood; 
modafinil used to treat sleep disorders; 
rosuvastatin or other statins used to treat high cholesterol. 
Taking Epclusa with any of these may stop your medicines from working properly, or make any side 
effects worse. Your doctor may need to give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of medicine 
you are taking. This change could be to Epclusa or another medicine you are taking. 
• 
Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take medicines used to treat stomach ulcers, 
heartburn or acid reflux as they can decrease the amount of velpatasvir in your blood. These 
medicines include: 
• 
antacids (such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate). These should 
be taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after Epclusa; 
proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and 
esomeprazole). Epclusa should be taken with food 4 hours before using a proton pump 
inhibitor. 
H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine). If you 
need high doses of these medicines your doctor may give you a different medicine instead 
or adjust the dose of the medicine you are taking. 
• 
• 
These medicines can decrease the amount of velpatasvir in your blood. If you are taking one of these 
medicines your doctor will either give you a different medicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid 
reflux, or recommend how and when you take that medicine. 
Pregnancy and contraception 
The effects of Epclusa during pregnancy are not known. If you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Epclusa is sometimes used together with ribavirin. Ribavirin can harm your unborn baby. It is 
therefore very important that you (or your partner) do not become pregnant during this treatment or for 
a period of time after completing treatment. You must read the “Pregnancy” section in the ribavirin 
package leaflet very carefully. Ask your doctor for effective contraception method suitable for you and 
your partner. 
Breast-feeding 
Do not breast-feed during treatment with Epclusa. It is not known whether sofosbuvir or 
velpatasvir, the two active substances of Epclusa, pass into human breast milk. 
Driving and using machines 
Epclusa should not affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machinery. 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Epclusa contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to take Epclusa 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
Recommended dose 
The recommended dose of Epclusa in adults is one 400 mg/100 mg tablet once a day for 12 weeks. 
The recommended dose of Epclusa in patients aged 3 to less than 18 years is based on weight. 
Take Epclusa as advised by your doctor.  
Swallow the tablet(s) whole with or without food. Do not chew, crush or split the tablet as it has a very 
bitter taste. 
If you are taking an antacid (medicines used to relieve heartburn), take it at least 4 hours before or at 
least 4 hours after Epclusa.

Contents of the pack and other information 
If Epclusa has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet 
is addressed to your child (in this case please read “your child” instead of “you”). 
1.  What Epclusa is and what it is used for 
Epclusa granules are a medicine that contains the active substances sofosbuvir and velpatasvir which 
are given in a granule formulation. Epclusa is given to treat chronic (long-term) hepatitis C virus 
infection in adults and children aged 3 years of age and older. 
The active substances in this medicine work together by blocking two different proteins that the virus 
needs to grow and reproduce itself, allowing the infection to be permanently eliminated from the body. 
It is very important that you also read the leaflets for the other medicines that you will be taking with 
Epclusa. If you have any questions about your medicines, please ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Epclusa 
Do not take Epclusa 
• 
If you are allergic to sofosbuvir, velpatasvir or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6 of this leaflet). 
 If this applies to you, do not take Epclusa and tell your doctor immediately. 
• 
If you are currently taking any of the following medicines: 
• 
• 
• 
rifampicin and rifabutin (antibiotics used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); 
St. John’s wort (herbal medicine used to treat depression); 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin (medicines used to treat epilepsy and 
prevent seizures). 
86 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor if you: 
• 
have liver problems other than from hepatitis C, for instance 
• 
if you have a current or previous infection with the hepatitis B virus, since your doctor 
may want to monitor you more closely; 
if you have had a liver transplant 
• 
have kidney problems or if you are on kidney dialysis, since Epclusa has not been fully 
tested in patients with some severe kidney problems; 
are taking treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, since your doctor 
may want to monitor you more closely. 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Epclusa if: 
• 
you currently take, or have taken in the last few months, the medicine amiodarone to treat 
irregular heartbeats, as it may result in a life-threatening slowing of your heart beat. Your doctor 
may consider different treatments if you have taken this medicine. If treatment with Epclusa is 
needed, you may require additional heart monitoring. 
you have diabetes. You may need closer monitoring of your blood glucose levels and/or 
adjustment of your diabetes medicines after starting Epclusa. Some diabetic patients have 
experienced low sugar levels in the blood (hypoglycaemia) after starting treatment with 
medicines like Epclusa. 
• 
• 
• 
Tell your doctor immediately if you currently take, or have taken in the last months any medicines 
for heart problems and during treatment you experience: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
slow or irregular heartbeat, or heart rhythm problems; 
shortness of breath or worsening of existing shortness of breath; 
chest pain; 
light-headedness; 
palpitations; 
near fainting or fainting. 
Blood tests 
Your doctor will test your blood before, during and after your treatment with Epclusa. This is so that: 
• 
• 
Your doctor can decide if you should take Epclusa and for how long; 
Your doctor can confirm that your treatment has worked and you are free of the hepatitis C 
virus. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under 3 years of age. The use of Epclusa in patients under 3 
years of age has not been studied. 
Other medicines and Epclusa 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Warfarin and other similar medicines called vitamin K antagonists are used to thin the blood. Your 
doctor may need to increase the frequency of your blood tests to check how well your blood can clot. 
Your liver function may change with treatment of hepatitis C and therefore may affect other 
medications (e.g. medicines used to suppress your immune system, etc.). Your doctor may need to 
closely monitor these other medicines you are taking and make adjustments after starting Epclusa. 
If you are not sure talk to your doctor or pharmacist. 
87 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Some medicines should not be taken with Epclusa. 
• 
Do not take with any other medicine that contains sofosbuvir, one of the active substances 
in Epclusa. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the medicines below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
amiodarone used to treat irregular heartbeats; 
rifapentine (antibiotic used to treat infections, including tuberculosis); 
oxcarbazepine (medicine used to treat epilepsy and prevent seizures); 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or any medicine containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, used 
to treat HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B; 
efavirenz used to treat HIV infection; 
digoxin used to treat heart conditions; 
dabigatran used to thin the blood; 
modafinil used to treat sleep disorders; 
rosuvastatin or other statins used to treat high cholesterol. 
Taking Epclusa with any of these may stop your medicines from working properly, or make any side 
effects worse. Your doctor may need to give you a different medicine or adjust the dose of medicine 
you are taking. This change could be to Epclusa or another medicine you are taking. 
• 
Get advice from a doctor or pharmacist if you take medicines used to treat stomach ulcers, 
heartburn or acid reflux as they can decrease the amount of velpatasvir in your blood. These 
medicines include: 
• 
antacids (such as aluminium/magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate). These should 
be taken at least 4 hours before or 4 hours after Epclusa; 
proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole and 
esomeprazole). Epclusa should be taken with food 4 hours before using a proton pump 
inhibitor. 
H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine or ranitidine). If you 
need high doses of these medicines your doctor may give you a different medicine instead 
or adjust the dose of the medicine you are taking. 
• 
• 
These medicines can decrease the amount of velpatasvir in your blood. If you are taking one of these 
medicines your doctor will either give you a different medicine for stomach ulcers, heartburn or acid 
reflux, or recommend how and when you take that medicine.

pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine.

therefore very important that you (or your partner) do not become pregnant during this treatment or for 
a period of time after completing treatment. You must read the “Pregnancy” section in the ribavirin 
package leaflet very carefully. Ask your doctor for effective contraception method suitable for you and 
your partner.

Epclusa should not affect your ability to drive or use any tools or machinery.

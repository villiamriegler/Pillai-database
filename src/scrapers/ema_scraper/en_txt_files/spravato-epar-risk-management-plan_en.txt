Centralized procedure
Chemical class
Esketamine is the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine. It is a non-selective, 
non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
(NMDAR), an ionotropic glutamate receptor.
Summary of mode of action
Through NMDAR antagonism, esketamine produces a transient increase in 
glutamate  release,  leading  to  increases  in  α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-
isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) stimulation and subsequently to 
increases in neurotrophic signaling, which may contribute to the restoration 
of the synaptic function in brain regions involved with the regulation of mood 
and emotional behavior. Restoration of dopaminergic neurotransmission in 
brain regions involved in reward and motivation, and decreased stimulation 
of brain regions involved in anhedonia, may contribute to the rapid response.

in 
the 
Current:
Treatment-resistant  MDD (TRD): SPRAVATO,  in  combination  with  a
selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitor (SSRI) or  serotonin-norepinephrine 
reuptake  inhibitor  (SNRI),  is  indicated  for  adults  with  treatment-resistant
MDD who  have  not  responded  to  at  least  two  different  treatments  with 
antidepressants (ADs) in the current moderate to severe depressive episode.
Acute  short-term  treatment  of  psychiatric  emergency  due  to  Major 
Depressive Disorder:
SPRAVATO, co-administered with oral AD therapy, is indicated in adults 
with a moderate to severe episode of MDD, as acute short-term treatment,
for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms, which according to clinical 
judgement constitute a psychiatric emergency.
Proposed: Not applicable.
Dosage in the EEA
Current:
Treatment-resistant MDD:
SPRAVATO  is  for  nasal  use  only.  The  nasal  spray  device  is  a  single-use 
device that delivers a total of 28 mg of esketamine, in 2 sprays (1 spray per 
nostril).  To  prevent  loss  of  medicinal  product,  the  device  should  not  be 
primed before use. SPRAVATO is intended for administration by the patient 
under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional, using 1 device (for 
a 28 mg dose), 2 devices (for a 56 mg dose), or 3 devices (for an 84 mg dose), 
with a 5-minute rest between use of each device.
The dosage recommendations for TRD are shown below. It is recommended 
to maintain the dose the patient receives at the end of the induction phase in 
the maintenance phase. Dose adjustments should be made based on efficacy 
and  tolerability  to  the  previous  dose.  During the  maintenance  phase, 
SPRAVATO  dosing  should  be  individualized  to  the  lowest  frequency  to 
maintain remission/response.

PART II:  SAFETY SPECIFICATION
Module SI:  Epidemiology of the Indication(s) and Target Population(s)
Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder
their 
symptoms 
depressive 
Major depressive disorder is a common and serious psychiatric disorder affecting over 30 million 
individuals in the European Union (EU) (Wittchen 2011). Major depressive disorder is the leading 
cause  of  disability  (measured  as  years  lived  with  disability)  worldwide  and  is  associated  with 
elevated  mortality  and  suicide  risk  (Global  Burden  of  Disease  Study  2017;  Walker 2015; 
World Health  Organization  2018).  About  30%  of  patients  with  MDD  fail  to  achieve  remission 
from 
treatment  with  multiple  medications 
(Fava 2003; Rush 2006); these patients are identified as suffering from TRD. A globally accepted 
definition for TRD does not yet exist. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) defines TRD as 
lack of clinically meaningful improvement despite the use of adequate doses of at least two AD 
agents, derived from the group(s) of commonly used first line treatment, prescribed for adequate 
duration with adequate affirmation of treatment adherence (European Medicines Agency 2013). 
However, a variety of definitions have been used in studies ranging from nonresponse to 1 AD for 
≤4  weeks  to  a  failure  to  respond  to  multiple  adequate  (duration  and  dosage)  trials  of  different 
classes of ADs and electroconvulsive therapy (Schosser 2012). This variation in definitions makes 
it difficult to compare rates of TRD across studies.
despite 
There  are  several  different  extant  definitions  of  TRD.  As  a  result,  there  are  no  agreed  upon 
estimates of incidence or prevalence of the disorder.
Incidence:
In a Danish study of MDD patients, 14.0% developed TRD within 1 year of initial diagnosis, with 
an incidence rate of 163.6/1000 person-years (PY) (95% confidence interval [CI]: 161.8-165.6) 
(Gronemann 2018). In this study, TRD was defined as 2 changes in treatment. In a study in Japan 
in which TRD was defined as 2 treatment failures in patients with an incident MDD diagnosis, 
12.0% developed TRD within 1 year of the MDD diagnosis (Mahlich 2018).
A  recent  United  States  (US) study  using  administrative  healthcare  claims  found  that  10.4%  of 
patients  newly  diagnosed  with  depression  developed  TRD  within  1  year  (Cepeda  2018). 
Treatment-resistant depression was  defined as having received either 3 distinct ADs or  at least 
1 antipsychotic in addition to an AD within 1 year.
Prevalence:
A review of the literature indicated that 30% to 50% of patients do not respond to an initial trial of 
AD medication  (Trevino  2014).  The  CoBalT  (cognitive  behavioral  therapy  as  an  adjunct  to 
pharmacotherapy  for  treatment-resistant  depression in  primary  care)  study,  conducted  in  the 
United  Kingdom  (UK),  defined  patients  with  TRD  as  those  who  scored  ≥14  on  the  Beck 
Depression Inventory (BDI) II (ie, at least mild depression) after taking ADs for at least 6 weeks 
at  an  adequate  dose  (Thomas  2013).  Of  the  patients  studied,  55%  met  the  definition  for  TRD. 
Results  from the  US  Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression  (STAR*D) trial 
suggest that 35% of patients fail to respond to 2 trials of AD medication (Nemeroff 2007).
8
The  European  Group  for  the  Study  of  Resistant  Depression  (GSRD) reported  that  50.7%  of  a 
sample of 702 MDD patients were treatment-resistant, which was defined as not reaching a 17-item 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) score ≤17 (ie, at most mild depression), after 
at least 2 adequate consecutive AD trials administered during the last episode (Schosser 2012). 
Several scales have been used to assess TRD and response to therapy, including the Montgomery-
Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (Johnson 2016).
Demographics of the Population in the Authorized Indication - Age, Sex, Ethnic Origin,
and Risk Factors for the Disease
Age, Sex, and Ethnic Origin
In the European GSRD study, there were no demographic differences between patients with MDD 
only  and  patients  with  TRD.  The  mean  age  at  onset  of  TRD  was  36.8 years  of  age  (standard 
deviation: 15.6) (Souery 2007). Most patients (75.3%) were female, and 58.7% of patients were 
married. The increased prevalence of TRD among women was also seen in the CoBalT study, in 
which 70.3% of patients were female (Thomas 2013).  A  literature review showed that patients 
with TRD were predominantly non-Hispanic white (89%) and female (71%), with an average age 
of 46.7 years (Mrazek 2014). 
Risk Factors for the Disease
Risk  factors  for  TRD  include  early  age  at  onset  of  MDD  and  psychiatric  and  medical 
comorbidities,  including  anxiety,  substance  use  disorders,  insomnia,  and  pain  (Cepeda  2018; 
Rizvi 2014).  Other  factors  that  have  been  associated  with  TRD  include  inflammatory  system 
activation, abnormal neural activity, neurotransmitter dysfunction, melancholic clinical features, a 
higher traumatic load, more frequent and recurrent episodes of depression, and a longer duration 
of illness (Murphy 2017).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
No  pharmacological  treatments  for  patients  with  TRD  are  approved  in  the  EU.  Traditional 
treatments  for  MDD  include  psychotherapy  and  pharmacotherapy,  with  the  main  types  of  AD
medication being SSRIs, SNRIs, atypical ADs, tricyclic ADs, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(Mayo Clinic 2018). Pharmacotherapy is considered the first-line treatment for a major depressive 
episode  (MDE) (Bauer  2017).  All  approved  AD pharmacotherapies  work  slowly  over  several 
weeks  by  acting  on  the  same  monoaminergic  pathway.  The  World  Federation  of  Societies  of 
Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) recommends a careful review of the diagnosis and adequacy of 
dosing when patients do not respond to an AD treatment (Bauer 2017). Recommended strategies 
include: pharmacologic interventions with increasing dosage of an AD; switching to another AD
within  the  same  class;  switching  to  a  second  AD in  a  different  class;  combining  2  ADs from 
different  classes;  or  augmenting  the  AD.  Augmentation  strategies  may  involve  the  addition  of 
lithium or an atypical antipsychotic (eg, quetiapine) to the AD. The AD may also be combined 
with psychotherapeutic intervention or other non-drug therapies such as electroconvulsive therapy.
9
Recently, novel non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic TRD treatments have emerged, including 
repetitive  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation,  intravenous/intranasal  ketamine,  vagus  nerve 
stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation, and buprenorphine (off-label use) (Conway 2017).
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including 
Mortality and Morbidity:
The  STAR*D  study  was  conducted  among  outpatients  with  nonpsychotic  MDD  who  were 
candidates for medication as a first step in a series of 4 acute treatment steps (Rush 2006). Those 
who did not achieve remission or could not tolerate a treatment step were encouraged to move to 
the next step. Among those who entered the second step (after 1 failed trial), 55% relapsed within 
an average of 3.9 months. The overall relapse rate was higher with 2 and 3 failed trials (64.6% 
within  an  average  of  3.1  subsequent  months  and  71.1%  within  an  average  of  3.3 subsequent 
months, respectively). Among those not in remission at entry to each step, the relapse rate was 
higher still, at 67.7%, 76%, and 83.3% within about 3 months.
In the STAR*D study, patients with TRD had more pronounced decreases in daily functioning and 
health-related quality of life scores, compared to non-TRD MDD patients (DiBernardo 2017).
Compared with other patients with MDD, those with TRD have lower productivity, higher medical 
comorbidity, and more suicide attempts. A lack of response to 2 adequate dose-duration trials of 
different  established  pharmacotherapy  or  psychotherapy  classes  is  associated  with  a  poor 
prognosis  with  respect  to  relapse  and  future  treatment  tolerance  (Conway  2017).  A  systematic 
review of studies on follow-up treatment for patients with TRD, defined as failure to respond to at 
least 1 AD medication, reported that relapse rates rise with each successive step of treatment, from 
55.3% at step 2 to 71.1% after step 4 (Fekadu 2009). Patients with TRD experience a more severe 
and protracted course of illness and are more likely to experience comorbid physical conditions 
than patients with MDD who do not develop treatment resistance. These patients are also more 
likely  to  have  comorbid  mental  health  problems,  have  significant  short  and  long-term  social 
impairment,  and  are  more  likely  to attempt  suicide  (Vergunst  2013).  Suicide  attempt  rates  are 
7-fold  higher  among  TRD  patients  than  MDD  patients  who  are  treatment  responsive 
(Feldman 2013). In summary, patients with TRD have a lower likelihood to respond to available 
oral ADs; these patients are more likely to have pronounced functional impairment, substantially 
lower quality of life, and incur higher medical and mental healthcare costs compared with patients 
who respond to treatment (Mathew 2012; Mrazek 2014).
There is  some evidence  that TRD  has  a negative impact on mortality.  Bergfeld and colleagues 
conducted a meta-analysis that included 30 studies to evaluate the suicide rate among TRD patients 
undergoing various types of treatment (Bergfeld 2018). The overall incidence of completed and 
attempted suicides was 0.47 and 4.66 per 100 patient-years (PY), respectively. A Swedish study, 
which defined TRD patients as those having failed at least 3 treatment regimens, reported a 5-year 
relative survival of 0.97 compared to the general population and a 35% higher all-cause mortality 
compared  to  non-TRD  MDD  patients  (adjusted  hazard  ratio  1.35;  95% CI: 1.21-1.50) 
(Reutfors 2018).
10
An  observational  study  of  TRD  patients  in  the US  who  had  an  inadequate  response  to  at  least 
4 treatment  regimens  reported an  all-cause  mortality  rate  of  8.06  per  1000 PY  (95%  CI: 
0.00-16.99)  for  those  who  received  usual  treatment  (treatment-as-usual,  TAU) and  4.46  per 
1000 PY (95% CI: 0.00-9.41) for those who received VNS plus usual treatment (VNS + TAU) 
(Olin 2012). The suicide rate was 1.61 per 1000 PY in the TAU group and 0.88 per 1000 PY in 
the VNS + TAU group. Another US study, conducted in a Medicare population, compared TRD 
patients with managed depressed patients and reported a mortality rate of 46.2 per 1000 PY in the 
first 2 years after the diagnosis was established for the TRD sample, and 46.8 per 1000 PY for the 
same period for the managed depression population (Feldman 2013).
In a Danish study, depression was associated with excess mortality for both natural and unnatural 
causes  (Laursen  2016).  The  authors  reported  an  overall  mortality  rate  ratio  of  2.07  (95%  CI: 
2.05-2.09)  for  unipolar  depression,  4.66  (95%  CI:  4.53-4.79)  for  unnatural  causes,  and 
1.98 (95% CI: 1.97-2.00) for natural causes.
Important Comorbidities:
The following are major comorbidities associated with TRD:
 Hypertension (Mrazek 2014);

Joint, limb, or back pain (Mrazek 2014);
 Dyslipidemia (Mrazek 2014);
 Other psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety or personality disorder (Mrazek 2014);

Suicidal ideation (Mrazek 2014);
 Obesity (Rizvi 2014);
 Headache/migraine (Kubitz 2013);

Sleep disorder (Kubitz 2013).
Acute short-term treatment of psychiatric emergency due to Major Depressive 
Disorder
Suicidal  ideation  is  a  common  symptom  in  psychiatric  emergency,  as  MDD  is  the  psychiatric 
condition  most  commonly  associated  with  suicide  (Kessler  2005; Hawton  2013).  Therefore, 
suicide-related morbidity and mortality in patients with MDD are a major public health concern 
(Kessler 2005; Wasserman 2012).
Incidence:
The incidence of MDD requiring an emergency department (ED) visit has not been identified for 
the EU.
According to the National Center for Health Statistics, in 2015 there were 304,272 ED visits with 
a primary diagnosis of unspecified MDD. Additionally, there were 38,383 visits with moderate 
and 39,931 visits with severe MDD (National Center for Health Statistics [b]).
11
The  same  study  counted  8,166,861  physician  office  visits  for  unspecified  MDD  that  year. 
Additionally, there were 1,311,677 moderate and 1,991,170 severe MDD physician office visits 
(National Center for Health Statistics [a]).
Prevalence:
An  analysis  of  the  National  Epidemiologic  Survey  on  Alcohol  and  Related  Conditions  III 
(NESARC-III) conducted  in  2012  to  2013  showed  that  nearly  half  (49.5%)  of lifetime  MDD 
patients  had  severe  MDD.  The  finding  was  similar  for  those  with  onset  in  the  prior  12-month 
period (46.8%) (Hasin 2018).
A study conducted in Germany a few years earlier (2009 to 2012) reported a lower incidence of 
severe MDD of 29.9% in men and 39.0% in women (Bretschneider 2018).
The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO) World  Mental  Health  Survey  Initiative,  in  a  general 
population-based sample, reported 12-month prevalence estimates of suicidal ideation, plans and 
attempts  of  2.0%,  0.6%,  and  0.3%,  respectively,  for  developed  countries  and  2.1%,  0.7%,  and 
0.4%, respectively for developing countries (Borges 2010). Lifetime estimates for prevalence of 
suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were 9.2%, 3.1%, and 2.7%, respectively (Nock 2008).
Demographics of the Population in the Authorized Indication - Age, Sex, Ethnic Origin,
and Risk Factors for the Disease
Age, Sex, and Ethnic Origin
Women  typically  have  a  twofold  increased  risk  of  major  depression  compared  with  men.  The 
median age of onset of MDD is in the middle 20s (Kessler 2013).
Risk Factors for the Disease
Comorbid anxiety disorder and childhood adversities are risk factors for more severe depression 
(Markkula 2016). Lack of social support contributes to disease risk. People who are separated or 
divorced  have  significantly  higher  rates  of  major  depression  than those  who  are  married 
(Kessler 2013). Risk factors for recurrent depression include symptoms of anxiety, recent adverse 
life  events  and  a  history  of  alcohol  dependence  in  men  (van Loo  2018).  People  with  major 
depression are at greater risk of suicide compared to people without depression, and the risk of 
death by suicide may, in part, be related to the severity of the depression (US Department of Health 
& Human Services 2014).
Main Existing Treatment Options:
Patients  with  psychiatric  emergency  due  to  MDD  are  an  acutely  ill  population  that  requires 
immediate  intervention  (Wasserman  2012).  However,  there  are  no  approved  pharmacological 
treatments  for  the  rapid  reduction  of  the  symptoms  of  depression  in  this  patient  population 
(van der Feltz-Cornelis 2011). Furthermore, only limited information is available to guide clinical 
decisions,  since  this  population  has  typically  been  excluded  from  AD  drug  trials  in  the  past. 
Current  standard  practice  includes  initiation  or  optimization  of  oral  ADs  and,  frequently, 
hospitalization (American Psychiatric Association 2003; Wasserman 2012). Standard ADs may 
12
take several weeks to exert their full effect (Machado-Vieira 2010) limiting their utility in crisis 
situations.
Antidepressants are  the  treatment  of  choice  for  the  relief  of  depressive  symptoms  and  suicidal 
ideation, which often accompanies depression, with SSRIs considered first-line therapy in primary 
care settings (Schwartz-Lifshitz 2012). Electroconvulsive therapy has also been used as treatment 
for acute suicidality among severely depressed patients (Schwartz-Lifshitz 2012).
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the Untreated Population, Including Mortality 
and Morbidity:
Depression severity is inversely associated with remission and recovery as measured by the BDI 
(Markkula 2016). Exogeneous factors can contribute to elevated risk of suicide attempt, including 
stressful life events and interpersonal and financial difficulties. Perceptions of these stressful life 
situations  can  be  strongly  distorted  by  psychiatric  disorders.  In  the  context  of  MDD,  existing 
private,  professional,  or  health  issues  may  be  magnified  (Hegerl  2016).  Physical  illness  and 
disability can, in some patients, contribute to the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
A UK Study reported the age- and sex-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for all-cause mortality 
in depression was 2.55 (95% CI 2.45-2.65) (Das-Munshi 2019).
A Norwegian study reported an SMR of 23.9 (95% CI 18.0-31.8) for suicide in patients with MDD 
from 1980 to 2012 compared to the general Norwegian population (Hoye 2016). In the US, the 
Department of Health & Human Services estimates that 2% of people ever treated for depression 
as an outpatient will die by suicide (US Department of Health & Human Services 2014).
Important Comorbidities:
Comorbid conditions associated with MDD include the following:

Cardiovascular diseases (Hirschfeld 2002)
 Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (Hirschfeld 2002)

Cancer (Hirschfeld 2002)
 Alcohol dependence (Hirschfeld 2002)
 Neurological conditions (Hirschfeld 2002)

Type 2 diabetes (Mezuk 2008)
 Anxiety disorders (Markkula 2016).

Key Safety Findings
Toxicity
Repeat-dose toxicity
Repeat-dose toxicity studies of 3 and 6 months in rats 
and  3  and  9  months  in  dogs  were  conducted  with 
esketamine  hydrochloride  administered  intranasally. 
Once-daily  intranasal  administration  of  esketamine  in 
rats  up  to  9 mg/day  for  6  months  and  dogs  up  to 
72 mg/day  for  9 months  resulted  in  CNS-related 
clinical  signs  considered  non-adverse,  reflecting  the 
anesthetic  properties  of  the  test  article.  Higher  dose 
levels  could  not  be  achieved  in  these  studies  due  to 
limitations  associated  with  the  long-term  intranasal 
instillation  of  esketamine  in  rats  and  dogs.  In  the 
6 month repeat-dose toxicity study in rats, hyperplasia 
of the olfactory epithelium was found at 9 mg/day and 
in  a  single  female  at  3 mg/day.  In  the  9-month 
repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs, focal atrophy of the 
olfactory epithelium was observed in the nasal cavity of 
males at 48 and 72 mg/day. There was no damage to the 
epithelium  of  the  nasal  turbinates,  such  as  ulceration, 
metaplasia,  or  dysplasia,  nor  any  evidence  of 
pre-neoplastic  lesions.  Consequently,  the  microscopic 
changes observed in the nasal cavity of rats and dogs 
reflected a non-adverse local response to the long-term 
administration of esketamine. After 3 months of daily 
administration  at  9 mg/day,  the  systemic  exposure  of 
esketamine  in  rats  (Cmax and  AUC)  resembled  that  in 
humans  at  the  MRHD  of  84 mg;  the  Cmax- and 
AUC-based exposure ratios for esketamine in dogs after 
3 months  of  daily  administration  at  72  mg/day  were 
approximately 4- and 1-fold, respectively. 
Reproductive toxicity
No  adverse  findings  with  intranasal  esketamine  were 
observed  in  fertility  and  embryonic  developmental 
toxicity and pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity 
studies in rats. The latter study included assessment of 
the offspring following exposure to esketamine via the 
breast milk.

intravenously  with  ketamine  at  high  anesthetic  dose 
levels in the third trimester of pregnancy, neuronal cell 
death  was  observed  in  the  brains  of  their  fetuses 
(Brambrink  2012;  Slikker 2007).  Ketamine-induced 
neuronal cell death was also observed following early 
postnatal 
subcutaneous 
administration of ketamine to rat and mice pups during 
a  period  of  rapid  brain  growth  (Fredriksson 2004; 
Scallet 2004;  Young  2005;  Zou 2009).  This  period  of

intranasally administered ketamine in pregnant rabbits, 
the  offspring  showed  skeletal  malformations  at 
maternally toxic dose levels.

Key Safety Findings
Nervous system
In single-dose and 14-day repeated-dose neurotoxicity 
studies  with  intranasally-administered  esketamine  in 
rats, no evidence of histopathological brain lesions was 
noted. In single-dose neurotoxicity studies in which rats 
were intranasally administered esketamine at a dose up 
to 72 mg, the Cmax- and AUC-based safety margins for 
esketamine  were  approximately  59- and  86-fold, 
respectively,  the  human  exposure  at  the  MRHD  of 
84 mg.  In  a  14-day  neurotoxicity  study  in  which  rats 
were  intranasally  administered  esketamine  once  daily 
up  to  a dose  of  54 mg/day,  the  Cmax- and  AUC-based 
safety  margins  for  esketamine  were  approximately 
17- and 11-fold, respectively, the human exposure at the 
MRHD  of  84  mg.  Moreover,  no  evidence  of 
neurotoxicity  was  found  in  the  6-month  rat  and  the 
9-month  dog  repeated-dose  toxicology  studies  with 
once  daily  intranasal  administration  of  esketamine  as 
judged  by  brain  histopathology  (rats  and  dogs), 
neurobehavioral  observations  (rats)  and  neurological 
examinations  (dogs).  Similarly,  no  neurotoxicity  was 
noted  in  shorter-term  animal  toxicology  studies  in 
which esketamine was intranasally administered.
Nephrotoxicity
No evidence of nephrotoxicity was observed following 
intranasal administration of esketamine in rats and dogs 
for up to 6 and 9 months, respectively.
Nonclinical  data  do  not  indicate  a  safety

Brief Overview of Development
Janssen Research & Development has developed esketamine nasal spray for 2 indications: TRD 
and acute short-term treatment of psychiatric emergency  due to MDD.  Compared to ketamine, 
esketamine  has  a  higher  NMDAR affinity  that  allows  a  lower  volume  of  medication  to  be 
administered via the non-invasive and rapidly-absorbed intranasal route.

ESKETINTRD3004, ESKETINTRD3005, and ESKETINTRD2003 (excluding Double-blind Phase esketamine 14 mg).  The 
duration of exposure includes days on which subjects did not actually take trial medication. Note: Population (N=1708) includes 
1 subject dosed with oral antidepressant only during ESKETINTRD3004 after completing ESKETINTRD3005 on placebo. The 
exposure to esketamine was 0 in that subject.

Table SIV.1:  Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development 
Program
Criterion 1
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
Cardiovascular disease (cerebrovascular disease with a history of stroke 
or  TIA;  aneurysmal  vascular  disease;  coronary  artery  disease  with 
myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or revascularization procedure 
within  12 months  before  the  start  of  the  trial;  hemodynamically 
significant  valvular  heart  disease  such  as  mitral  regurgitation,  aortic 
stenosis, or aortic regurgitation; NYHA Class III-IV heart failure)
Cardiovascular  effects  due  to  increased  blood  pressure  are  expected  for 
esketamine  nasal  spray  based  on  esketamine’s  mechanism  of  action 
(sympathomimetic  effect;  direct  stimulation  of  the  CNS that  leads  to 
increased sympathetic nervous system outflow). Transient increases in blood 
pressure,  as  well  as  cardiovascular  and  blood  pressure-related  events,  in 
association with esketamine nasal spray were reported in the Phase 1 and 2 
clinical  trials  in  healthy  volunteers  and  patients  with  MDD.  Patients  with 
pre-existing cardiovascular conditions for whom a sudden acute increase in 
blood  pressure  might  pose  a  safety  risk  were  therefore  excluded  from 
esketamine clinical trials.
to 
be 
as  missing 
No
Considered 
included 
information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
SPRAVATO is contraindicated in patients for whom an increase in blood 
pressure  poses  a  serious risk  (SmPC  Section 4.3, Contraindications).  This 
includes  patients  with  known  aneurysmal  vascular  disease  (including  the 
intracranial, thoracic, or abdominal aorta or peripheral arterial vessels) and 
patients with a known history of intracerebral hemorrhage. As documented 
in  the  SmPC  (Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use,  Section 4.4), 
patients  with  cardiovascular  and  cerebrovascular  conditions should  be 
carefully  assessed  before  prescribing  SPRAVATO;  treatment  should  be 
initiated only if the benefit outweighs the risk.

Criterion 2
Uncontrolled hypertension or history of hypertensive crisis
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
Increased blood pressure is expected for esketamine nasal spray based on 
esketamine’s  mechanism  of  action  (sympathomimetic  effect;  direct 
stimulation of the CNS that leads to increased sympathetic nervous system 
outflow).  Transient  increases  in  blood  pressure in  association  with 
esketamine  nasal  spray  were  reported  in  the  Phase  1  and  2  clinical  trials. 
Patients  with  unstable  or  poorly  controlled  hypertension  may  be  at  an 
increased  risk  of  adverse  cardiovascular  effects.  These  patients  were 
therefore  excluded  from  esketamine  clinical 
trials  as  presence  of 
uncontrolled  hypertension  or  a  prior  history  of  hypertensive  crisis  was 
considered to pose a safety risk.
to 
be

No
Considered

information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
SPRAVATO is contraindicated in patients for whom an increase in blood 
pressure  poses  a  serious  risk  (SmPC  Section 4.3,  Contraindications).  The 
SmPC (Special warnings and precautions for use, Section 4.4) describes the 
need  for  blood  pressure  assessments  (prior  to  starting  treatment  and 
postadministration  until  blood  pressure  returns  to  acceptable  levels)  and 
recommended actions to manage blood pressure elevation.
Criterion 3
Clinically significant ECG abnormalities
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
Cardiovascular  effects  due  to  increased  blood  pressure  are  expected  for 
esketamine  nasal  spray  based  on  esketamine’s  mechanism  of  action 
(sympathomimetic  effect;  direct  stimulation  of  the  CNS  that  leads  to 
increased sympathetic nervous system outflow). Transient increases in blood 
pressure,  as  well  as  cardiovascular  and  blood  pressure-related  events,  in

information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
SPRAVATO is contraindicated in patients for whom an increase in blood 
pressure  poses  a  serious  risk  (SmPC  Section 4.3,  Contraindications).  As 
documented  in  the  SmPC  (Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use, 
Section 4.4),  SPRAVATO should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with 
known uncontrolled brady- or tachyarrhythmias that lead to hemodynamic 
instability;  these  patients  should  be  carefully  assessed  before  prescribing 
SPRAVATO, and treatment should be initiated only if the benefit outweighs 
the risk.

Table SIV.1:  Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development 
Program
Criterion 4a
Pregnancy 
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
For  ethical  reasons,  pregnant  women  are  normally  excluded  from  clinical 
trials.
The possibility of developmental neurotoxicity in human fetuses exposed to 
esketamine  in  utero  cannot  be  excluded  based  on  published  findings 
following administration of ketamine in animals.
to 
be

No
Considered

information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
SPRAVATO  is  not  recommended  during  pregnancy;  treatment  should  be 
discontinued  if  a  woman  becomes pregnant  (SmPC  Section 4.6,  Fertility, 
pregnancy and lactation).
Criterion 4b
Breast-feeding women
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
For  ethical  reasons,  breast-feeding  women  are  normally  excluded  from 
clinical trials.
It is unknown whether esketamine is excreted into human breast milk. Data 
in animals have shown excretion of ketamine in cow’s milk; therefore, it is 
expected that esketamine may be excreted in human milk.
to 
be 
as  missing 
No
Considered 
included 
information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
The SmPC (Section 4.6, Fertility, pregnancy and lactation) states that it is 
unknown whether esketamine is excreted in human milk. The decision must 
be  made  whether  to  discontinue  breast-feeding  or  to  discontinue/abstain 
from SPRAVATO therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding 
for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
35
Table SIV.1:  Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development 
Program
Criterion 5
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
Liver  cirrhosis  (eg,  esophageal  varices,  ascites,  and 
increased 
prothrombin  time);  ALT  or  AST  ≥2×ULN;  total  bilirubin  >1.5×ULN 
(unless elevation was consistent with Gilbert’s disease)
Esketamine is metabolized in the liver and hepatic clearance is required for 
termination of clinical effects. Abnormal liver function tests associated with 
the  use  of  intravenous  esketamine  have  been  reported,  particularly  with 
extended use or drug abuse.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class C) were excluded 
from  esketamine  clinical  trials  to  reduce  potential  confounding  of  the 
assessment of safety.
to 
be 
as  missing 
No
Considered
included 
information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
The safety profile of SPRAVATO is not expected to differ in patients with 
mild/moderate hepatic impairment. The SmPC states that SPRAVATO has 
not  been  studied  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child  Pugh 
class  C)  (Section  4.2,  Posology  and  method  of  administration  and 
Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties) and that it is not recommended in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Section 4.2, Posology and method 
of administration and Special warnings and precautions for use, Section 4.4). 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild (Child Pugh class A) 
or  moderate  (Child  Pugh  class B)  hepatic  impairment.  However,  the 
maximum  dose  of  84  mg  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with 
moderate  hepatic  impairment  (Section  4.2,  Posology  and  method  of 
administration).
Criterion 6
Patients <18 years of age
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
The safety and efficacy of esketamine nasal spray was first established in the 
adult  population.  It  is  standard  practice  to  develop  a  drug  in  the  adult 
population  before  the  pediatric  population  unless  the  target  disease  is 
exclusively pediatric.
to

as  missing 
No
Considered

Yes/No
Rationale (if not included

Use in patients <18 years of age is not relevant to the current indications in 
the adult population for SPRAVATO.

Program
Criterion 7
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
Psychotic disorder or MDD with psychotic features, bipolar or related 
disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, intellectual disability, autism 
spectrum  disorder,  borderline  personality  disorder,  antisocial 
personality  disorder,  histrionic  personality  disorder,  or  narcissistic 
personality disorder
In general, patients with multiple psychiatric comorbidities were excluded 
from  the  Phase 2  and  Phase 3  clinical  trials  so  as  not  to  confound  the 
assessment  of  efficacy.  Patients  with  psychiatric  diagnoses  other  than  the 
indications studied (eg, psychotic disorder, MDD with psychotic features, 
bipolar  or  related  disorders,  obsessive  compulsive  disorder,  and  autism 
spectrum disorder) were excluded from the Phase 3 clinical trials as these 
would require separate investigation. In addition, patients with a diagnosis 
of MDD with psychoses represented a more vulnerable population in whom
ketamine may cause psychotomimetic symptoms; therefore, these patients 
were  excluded  from  esketamine  clinical  trials.  Patients  with  the  other 
psychiatric  comorbidities  (ie,  borderline  personality  disorder,  antisocial 
personality  disorder,  histrionic  personality  disorder,  and  narcissistic 
personality disorder) were excluded so as not to confound the assessment of 
efficacy.
to 
be 
as  missing 
No
Considered

information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
As  documented  in  the  SmPC  (Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use, 
Section  4.4),  SPRAVATO should be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  a 
presence or history of psychosis, mania, or bipolar disorder; these patients 
should be carefully assessed before prescribing SPRAVATO, and treatment 
should be initiated only if the benefit outweighs the risk. SPRAVATO may 
be used in patients with psychiatric comorbidities other than psychosis.
Criterion 8
Homicidal ideation/intent
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
Patients with active homicidal ideation or intent were not included for safety 
and ethical reasons (risk to the investigative staff).

SPRAVATO may  be  used  in  patients  who  exhibit  homicidal  ideation  or 
intent. 
37
Table SIV.1:  Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development 
Program
Criterion 9
Evidence of moderate to severe substance use or alcohol use disorder
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
Current or recent evidence of moderate or severe substance or alcohol use 
disorder could interfere with clinical improvement and interpretation of the 
efficacy  and  safety  results.  Evidence  from  a  human  abuse  potential  study 
(Trial  54135419TRD1015)  suggests that  the  potential  for  abuse  with 
esketamine is similar to that of ketamine; therefore, patients with evidence 
of moderate or severe substance or alcohol use disorder may be at increased 
risk for abuse.
to 
be 
as  missing 
No
Considered 
included 
information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
SPRAVATO is available by prescription only and administered under the 
direct supervision of a healthcare professional. The SmPC (Special warnings 
and precautions for use, Section 4.4) includes a warning that individuals with 
a history of drug abuse or dependence may be at greater risk for abuse and 
misuse  of  SPRAVATO,  that  individuals  should  be  assessed  prior  to 
treatment for a history of substance use disorder, including alcohol, and that 
monitoring for signs of abuse or dependence is recommended. The potential 
for  abuse,  misuse,  and  diversion  of  SPRAVATO is  minimized  by  the 
product’s  design  and  its  administration  under  the  direct  supervision  of  a 
healthcare professional. The potential for abuse is further reduced by limited 
pack  sizes,  legal  controls  per  local  legal  requirements  in  Member  States 
where esketamine is scheduled, and Controlled Access Program.
Criterion 10
Thyroid disease/disorder
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
Ketamine  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  hypertension  and 
tachycardia  in  patients  with  hyperthyroidism  or  patients  receiving  thyroid 
replacement.  Hyperthyroidism 
the  risk  of  cardiovascular 
increases 
symptoms with use of esketamine. In addition, untreated thyroid disease may 
be associated with the presence of depressive symptoms; such patients were 
therefore excluded so as not to confound the assessment of efficacy.
to 
be 
as  missing 
No
Considered 
included 
information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
As  documented  in  the  SmPC  (Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use, 
Section  4.4),  SPRAVATO should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with 
hyperthyroidism that has not been sufficiently treated; these patients should 
be carefully assessed before prescribing SPRAVATO, and treatment should 
be initiated only if the benefit outweighs the risk.
38

Criterion 11
Significant pulmonary insufficiency
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
Respiratory depression has been reported following injections of ketamine 
and  esketamine,  particularly  after  a  high  dose  and/or  rapid  intravenous 
injection.
Patients  with  significant  pulmonary  insufficiency  were  excluded  from 
Phase 3  clinical  trials.  Treatment  for  the  primary  condition  leading  to 
pulmonary insufficiency is necessary first, as that is more immediate and life 
threatening.

Criterion 12
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
As  documented  in  the  SmPC  (Special  warnings  and  precautions  for  use, 
Section  4.4),  SPRAVATO should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with 
significant  pulmonary  insufficiency;  these patients  should  be  carefully 
assessed before prescribing SPRAVATO, and treatment should be initiated 
only if the benefit outweighs the risk.
Untreated  glaucoma,  current  penetrating  or  perforating  eye  injury, 
brain  injury,  hypertensive  encephalopathy,  intrathecal  therapy  with 
ventricular  shunts,  or  any  other  condition  associated  with  increased 
intracranial pressure or increased intraocular pressure or planned eye 
surgery
Increased blood pressure is expected for esketamine nasal spray based on 
esketamine’s  mechanism  of  action  (sympathomimetic  effect;  direct 
stimulation of the CNS that leads to increased sympathetic nervous system 
outflow).  Transient  increases  in  blood  pressure  in  association  with 
esketamine nasal spray have been reported in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. 
Intraocular  or  intracranial  pressure  could  theoretically  increase  after 
administration of esketamine nasal spray.
to

No
Considered 
included 
information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
The SmPC (Special warnings and precautions for use, Section 4.4) instructs 
prescribers to carefully assess patients before prescribing SPRAVATO and 
to initiate treatment only if the benefit outweighs the risk in patients with 
history  of  brain  injury,  hypertensive  encephalopathy,  intrathecal  therapy 
with  ventricular  shunts,  or  any  other  condition  associated  with  increased 
intracranial  pressure.  Increased  intraocular  pressure  is  not  expected  when 
SPRAVATO is used at therapeutic doses.
39
Table SIV.1:  Important Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Trials Across the Development 
Program
Criterion 13
Seizures
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
Seizures/epilepsy may be associated with depression. The primary treatment 
for patients with depressive symptoms and seizures/epilepsy is treatment for 
the  seizures  with  approved  medications.  Therefore,  enrollment  of  such 
patients in esketamine clinical trials was not considered prudent.
to

No
Considered 
included 
information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
The exclusion criterion was implemented for the purpose of the clinical trials 
and  not  for  a  specific  safety  concern.  Seizures/epilepsy  is  not  a 
contraindication or precaution for use of SPRAVATO.
Criterion 14
Uncontrolled  diabetes  mellitus  or  history  of  diabetic  ketoacidosis, 
hyperglycemic coma, or severe hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness
Reason 
exclusion criterion
for  being  an 
These  patients  were  excluded  from  the  Phase 3  clinical  trials  to  reduce 
potential confounding of the assessment of safety and efficacy. The presence 
of  uncontrolled  diabetes  could  confound  the  assessment  and  stability  of 
depressive symptoms. Patients with controlled diabetes were included in the 
clinical trials. 
to 
be 
as  missing 
No
Considered 
included 
information
Yes/No
Rationale (if not included 
as missing information)
The exclusion criterion was implemented for the purpose of the clinical trials 
and not for a specific safety concern. In long-term clinical trials (TRD3003 
and TRD3004), increased blood pressure was reported more frequently in 
patients  with  diabetes  compared  to  nondiabetic  patients  (in  both  the 
induction  phases  as  well  as  the  optimization/maintenance  phases  of  the 
respective trials).
Criterion 15
Use  of  benzodiazepines  at  a  daily  dose  greater  than  the  equivalent  of 
6 mg/day of lorazepam
Reason 
exclusion criterion

Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programs
The clinical development program is unlikely to detect certain types of adverse reactions such as 
rare adverse reactions or adverse reactions with a long latency.
The clinical development program was likely to detect adverse reactions following prolonged or 
cumulative exposure. Evaluation of the safety profile of esketamine nasal spray following longer 
exposure did not reveal any adverse reactions in addition to those previously identified. No new 
adverse reactions were identified with repeated dosing in the long-term trials compared to those 
seen  in  the  short-term  trials;  adverse  reactions  were  typically  seen  shortly  after  dosing  and 
generally resolved the same day. Patients from previous clinical trials were eligible to roll over 
into an ongoing open-label long-term extension safety study (54135419TRD3008) to assess the 
long-term safety (>1 year) of esketamine nasal spray in patients with TRD, which is specifically 
relevant to 2 important potential risks: Cognitive disorders and memory impairment (long-term 
use) and Interstitial cystitis (long-term use).

Module SVI:  Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification
Potential for Misuse for Illegal Purposes
Drug abuse is considered an important identified risk for SPRAVATO.
The exact mechanism underlying esketamine’s abuse potential is unknown. Esketamine is active 
within the central nervous system (CNS) and has a mechanism of action similar to that of racemic 
ketamine. As antagonists of NMDARs, both ketamine and esketamine induce psychoactive effects. 
Ketamine is a known drug of abuse recreationally and induces psychological effects, including 
dissociation and other perceptual distortions; alterations in cognition; and changes in mood. The 
most common way that ketamine is used recreationally is insufflation.
Evidence from an esketamine abuse potential study suggests that its potential for abuse is similar
to that of ketamine (Trial 54135419TRD1015).
The abuse potential of SPRAVATO and its mitigation are addressed in the EU product information 
(EU PI) (ie, Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] and Package Leaflet [PL]) and include 
the following concepts:



SPRAVATO is administered under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional.
The recommended dosing frequency of SPRAVATO for the TRD indication is twice weekly 
for  4 weeks,  followed  by  weekly  or  every-other-week  dosing  for  patients  with  a  favorable 
clinical response. During longer-term treatment, physicians are recommended to individualize 
the dosing frequency to the lowest frequency needed to maintain the patient’s clinical response 
and  to  perform  periodic  re-evaluation  of  patients  to  determine  the  need  for  continued 
treatment. For the indication of acute short-term treatment of psychiatric emergency due to 
MDD, the recommended dosing frequency of SPRAVATO is twice weekly for 4 weeks.
Individuals with a history of drug abuse or dependence may be at greater risk for abuse and 
misuse of SPRAVATO. Physicians are advised to assess individuals prior to treatment for a 
history of substance use disorder and to monitor for signs of abuse or dependence.
SPRAVATO is designed with the following features to deter abuse and misuse:
1. The product is supplied in limited pack sizes.
2. The drug product is contained in a Type I glass vial sealed with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper. 
The filled and stoppered vial is assembled into a manually activated nasal spray device. The 
device  is  difficult  to  disassemble  due  to  interlocking  design  features  of  the  actuator 
subassembly. Attempts to break open the device damage the vial and the contents are lost. 
The force required to pull the device apart is at least 60 Newtons (~13 pounds). If the device 
is taken apart, the stoppered vial provides an additional challenge to disassembly, as it is very 
difficult to pull the stopper out. Breaking the vial instead results in loss of the contents.
3. The product is supplied as a single-use device containing a total of 32.3 mg of esketamine 
HCl  (equivalent  to  28  mg  of  esketamine).  When  manually  actuated,  the  device  dispenses 
2 individual sprays; no sprays remain after the second spray is actuated.
46
4. The nasal spray device has a nominal fill volume of 230 μL and a delivery volume of 200 μL. 
The average measured residual volume left in the nasal spray device after actuation is ~30 μL 
(4 mg base).
Legal controls (eg, restrictions on storage and prescribing including special and restricted medical 
prescription with categorization at the Member State level) will be in place according to local legal 
requirements in the majority of Member States where esketamine is currently scheduled, either 
directly or indirectly due to its chemical relationship to ketamine. In these Member States, it is 
proposed  that the  scheduling  class  should  be  the  same  as  that  which  applies  already  to  any 
ketamine- or esketamine-containing medicinal product. The following recommendations minimize 
the risk of abuse, diversion and misuse. Any unused medicinal product or waste material should 
be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. All treatment should be administered under 
the  direct  supervision  of  a healthcare  professional. Healthcare  professionals are  advised  in  the
Healthcare  Professional  Guide to  monitor for  signs  of  abuse  or  dependence. There  will  be  no 
unsupervised administration of the product. A Controlled Access Program will be implemented, a 
key  element  of  which  is  to  ensure  SPRAVATO  is  dispensed  to  the  healthcare  settings  where 
administration takes place, as agreed at the Member State level, based on local legal requirements 
and/or local healthcare systems.
A Healthcare Professional Guide and a Patient Guide containing key messages regarding product 
administration  and  the  potential  for  abuse  and  dependence  are  additional  risk  minimization 
measures. Details are provided in Part V.

Risks not Included in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the indication treated):
Gastrointestinal effects including nausea and vomiting
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious, but occurring with a low frequency and 
considered to be acceptable in relation to the severity of the indication treated:
Not applicable
Known  risks  that  require  no  further  characterization  and  are  followed  up  via  routine 
pharmacovigilance  and  for  which  the  routine  risk  minimization  messages  in  the  product 
information are considered adequate:
Transient dizziness and vertigo 
Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile:
Transient mental and cognitive impairment
Transient anxiety
Transient  psychiatric  and  neurological  effects,  including  tremor,  dysarthria,  hypoesthesia,  lethargy, 
dysgeusia, and euphoric mood
Nasal effects including nasal discomfort, crust, pruritus, and dryness
Other reasons for considering the risks not important:
Respiratory depression
Respiratory  depression  is  a  known  adverse  reaction  for  marketed  esketamine  solution  for 
injection/infusion and marketed ketamine solution for injection/infusion, the risk of which is dependent 
on dose (ie, overdosage) and speed of the intravenous injection (ie, overly rapid administration).
No clinically significant decreases in respiratory rate were observed in esketamine Phase 3 trials. No 
cases of respiratory depression were reported, and no subjects required resuscitation. Isolated cases of 
2 or more consecutive oxygen saturation levels below 93% within the same visit (based on the pulse 
oximetry  data)  were  not  associated  with  clinical  symptoms  of  compromised  respiratory  function  and 
resolved spontaneously in the post-dose period prior to discharge, while vital signs remained within the 
normal range.
Suicidal ideation and behavior
Because suicidal ideation and behavior are symptoms of major depression and TRD, it is important to 
distinguish the contribution of treatment of these conditions to the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior 
from that of the underlying depression. The Applicant conducted a review to determine the occurrence 
of suicide-related events. 
Across all Phase 2 and 3 esketamine trials, there was a trend towards a reduction in suicidal ideation and 
behavior using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Most subjects reported no suicidal

Reason for not Including an Identified or Potential Risk in the List of Safety Concerns in the RMP:
ideation or behavior during these trials.
For subjects with no suicidal ideation or behavior at baseline, the rates of reported suicidal ideation (based 
on C-SSRS) occurring at least once during the treatment phase were similar for the esketamine + oral 
AD  groups  compared  to  the  placebo  +  oral  AD  groups  in  the  short-term  double-blind  trials 
(TRD3001/3002: 10.2% vs. 12.3%; TRD3005: 13.8% vs. 16.7%) and in the double-blind maintenance 
phase of the relapse prevention trial TRD3003 (2.4% vs. 4.5%). 
Severe suicidality-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as preferred terms (PTs)
of Completed suicide, Depression suicidal, Intentional overdose, Intentional self-injury, Multiple drug 
overdose  intentional,  Poisoning  deliberate,  Self  injurious  behaviour,  Self-injurious  ideation,  Suicidal 
behaviour, Suicidal ideation, and Suicide attempt, were reported at a low incidence (<1% for individual 
PTs) in each of the Phase 2 and 3 trials that was below the background rates expected in the treated 
population. Clinical review of suicidality-related TEAEs indicated that most of these events were likely 
associated with the underlying disease.
Hepatobiliary disorders
Hepatobiliary  disorders  are  known  adverse  reactions  for  marketed  esketamine  solution  for 
injection/infusion  and  marketed  ketamine  solution  for 
injection/infusion.  Hepatotoxicity  and 
cholangiopathy have been described in the literature for ketamine in the context of long-term use or high 
doses.
Esketamine  nasal  spray  was  studied  in  subjects  with  mild  to  moderate  hepatic  impairment 
(Trial ESKETINTRD1011). Following administration of a single 28 mg dose of esketamine nasal spray, 
mean total esketamine maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-
time  curve  (AUC) were  similar  in  subjects  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  (Child  Pugh  class  A)  as 
compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child 
Pugh class B), total esketamine Cmax was approximately 8% higher as compared to subjects with normal 
hepatic function, whereas AUC from time zero to time of the last observed quantifiable concentration 
(AUClast) and  AUC  from  time  zero  to  infinite  time  (AUC∞) values  were  114%  and  103%  higher,
respectively.
There was no evidence of treatment-emergent hepatotoxicity associated with esketamine nasal spray. 
Across the completed Phase 2 and 3 trials in TRD, increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred at 
low rates among the esketamine + oral AD treatment groups (ie, <2% in all trials/trial phases).
The observed increases in ALT/AST in the Phase 3 trials in TRD were primarily asymptomatic, transient, 
and resolved spontaneously without worsening while treatment with esketamine + oral AD continued. 
No persistent increases in liver transaminases were observed. A qualitative assessment of the individual 
cases  showed  that  majority  of  the  subjects  with  markedly  elevated  transaminases  had  an  alternative 
etiology  (eg,  co-medications  with  known  hepatotoxic  effects,  such  as  statins  and  acetaminophen; 
underlying disease, such as viral hepatitis B, fatty liver, or cholelithiasis; or history of excessive alcohol 
consumption).
Across all completed Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials with esketamine, no subject met the criteria for severe drug-
induced hepatocellular injury as defined by Hy’s law. Further, no cases of treatment-emergent elevated 
total serum bilirubin levels to >2×ULN were identified in esketamine-treated subjects.

Significant  clinical  consequences  of  esketamine  abuse 
include 
attenuation and dependence if the product is used outside the approved 
indication  and/or  dose  limits.  The  observed  low  incidence  of  severe 
TEAEs suggestive of drug abuse and the lack of evidence of a distinct 
withdrawal syndrome after cessation of dosing based on PWC-20 scores 
suggest that the drug abuse potential for patients with TRD alone is low. 
Patients with comorbid TRD and substance abuse disorders have not been 
studied; therefore, the risk in this population is unknown. The available 
data from patients with TRD suggest no significant impact on the risk-
benefit balance of esketamine nasal spray. The SmPC and PL, as well as 
the  Healthcare  Professional  Guide  and  Patient  Guide, provide 
information  to  the  prescriber  and  the  patient  on  the  risk  of  abuse. 
Prescribers are advised that individuals with a history of drug abuse or 
dependence may be at greater risk for abuse and misuse of esketamine 
nasal spray and that individuals should be assessed prior to treatment for 
a  history  of  substance  use  disorder,  including  alcohol.  Monitoring  for 
signs of abuse or dependence is recommended.
Given  that  dissociative  states  and  perception  disorders  observed  in  the 
clinical  trials  were  transient,  self-limiting,  and  without  clinically 
significant  adverse  outcomes,  the  overall  impact  on  the  risk-benefit 
balance  of  the  product  is  considered  low;  however,  the  impact  on  an 
individual patient may be significant. The SmPC and PL, as well as the 
Healthcare Professional Guide and Patient Guide, provide information to 
the  prescriber  and  the  patient  on  the  risk  of  dissociative  states  and 
perception disorders. A checklist for readiness to leave will be provided 
to aid healthcare professionals in determining when a patient is deemed 
stable  and  can  safely  be  allowed  to  leave  following  esketamine  nasal

somnolence/sedation may potentially impact a patient’s ability to drive or

on the risk-benefit balance of the product is considered low to moderate. 
The  SmPC  and  PL,  as  well  as  the  Healthcare  Professional  Guide  and

Risk-benefit Impact
Due to the transient and self-limiting nature of the cardiovascular effects 
observed in clinical trials, the overall impact on the risk-benefit balance 
of the product is considered low; however, the impact on an individual 
patient may be significant. The SmPC and PL, as well as the Healthcare 
Professional  Guide  and  Patient  Guide, provide  information  to  the

determining when a patient is deemed stable and can safely be allowed to

Given  the  recommended  intermittent  dosing  frequency  for  esketamine 
nasal  spray,  and  considering  that  most  events  related  to  cognitive 
disorders  and  memory  impairment  following  long-term  use  in  clinical 
trials were neither severe nor serious, and were generally self-limiting and 
resolved without intervention, the impact on the risk-benefit balance of 
the product is expected to be low.
Interstitial  cystitis  is  a  serious  adverse  reaction  that  may  result  in 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity. Given that no cases of 
esketamine nasal spray-related interstitial cystitis were observed in any 
of  the  Phase 2  and  Phase 3  trials,  which  involved  treatment  for  up  to 
1 year, the impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product is expected 
to be low. With intermittent exposure at the doses of 28 mg, 56 mg, and 
84 mg recommended in the SmPC for treatment of patients with TRD, the 
bladder has sufficient time between dosing sessions for self-repair from 
any potential irritation.
There are no or limited data on the use of esketamine in pregnant women. 
The possibility of neurotoxicity in developing fetuses cannot be excluded 
based on published findings suggesting developmental neurotoxicity of 
ketamine in animals. Esketamine nasal spray is not recommended during 
pregnancy and 
in  women  of  childbearing  potential  not  using 
contraception.

New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an 
Updated RMP
Missing information Use during pregnancy is removed from the list of safety concerns.
Pregnant women were excluded from esketamine clinical trials; if pregnancy occurred, withdrawal 
of  the  subject  from  the  trial  was  required.  SPRAVATO  is  not  recommended  for  use  during 
pregnancy,  and  treatment  should  be  discontinued  if  a  woman  becomes pregnant  while  using 
SPRAVATO (SmPC Section 4.6, Fertility, pregnancy and lactation). Because SPRAVATO is not 
expected to be used in pregnant women, use during pregnancy does not constitute a safety concern 
per GVP Module V (Revision 2) criteria for missing information.
51
Consequently,  the  National  Pregnancy  Registry  for  Antidepressants,  which  was  included  as  a 
category 3 additional pharmacovigilance activity to characterize the safety profile of SPRAVATO 
during pregnancy, is removed from the Pharmacovigilance Plan.
Of  note,  a  cumulative  review  of  the  company’s  Global  Medical  Safety  database  through 
31 August 2023  for  reports  of  pregnancy  associated  with  SPRAVATO  returned  92 cases  of 
maternal exposure prior to or during pregnancy. A review of these cases did not reveal a signal 
suggesting maternal or neonatal toxicity with serious adverse outcome or major malformations. 
Between March 2019 and July 2023, the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants enrolled 
4 participants who had been exposed to esketamine during pregnancy, for which there were no 
clinically significant findings.

Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential 
Risks
Important Identified Risk – Drug abuse
Potential Mechanisms:
Ketamine and esketamine are non-competitive, non-selective, open-channel NMDAR antagonists. 
As antagonists of NMDARs, ketamine and esketamine induce psychoactive effects. Ketamine is 
well known for its abuse potential in both humans and animals (Liu 2016). The exact mechanism 
underlying ketamine’s abuse potential is unknown. Given the known direct targets of ketamine 
and the effects of other NMDAR antagonists in the same class, the behavioral effects of ketamine 
at subanesthetic doses, including perceptual/dissociative symptoms, are thought to be primarily 
driven by its activity at the NMDAR, although indirect actions on dopaminergic neurotransmission 
may contribute as well (Broadbear 2004; De Luca 2012; Shram 2011; Winger 2002).
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Evidence from an esketamine abuse potential trial (Trial 54135419TRD1015) suggests that the 
potential  for  abuse  is  similar  to  that  of  ketamine,  a  known  drug  of  abuse  recreationally.  No 
evidence  of  drug-seeking  behavior  was  observed,  and  no  confirmed  cases  of  diversion  were 
reported in clinical trials of esketamine nasal spray.

Characterization of the Risk - Discussion:
Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder
Data from all clinical trials of esketamine nasal spray were examined for the occurrence of CNS
effects suggesting that the drug might be sought by patients specifically for abuse purposes. Such 
effects  are  related  to  esketamine’s pharmacology  and  were  identified  prior  to  the  start  of  the 
Phase 3 program based on the known properties of esketamine and ketamine. In a trial of abuse 
potential conducted in recreational polydrug users (n=41), single doses of esketamine nasal spray 
(84 mg  and  112 mg)  and  of intravenous  ketamine  (positive  control;  0.5  mg/kg  infused  over 
40 minutes) produced  significantly  greater  scores  than  placebo  on  subjective  ratings  of  “drug 
liking” and other measures of subjective drug effects.
55
The frequency of reported TEAEs suggestive of drug abuse was 54.4% in the All Clinical Trials 
Population and 4.0 times higher in the esketamine + oral AD  group vs. the placebo + oral AD 
group in the double-blind trials (51.1% vs. 12.8%). The odds ratio (OR) of 7.2 (95% CI: 5.2, 9.9) 
indicated that the odds of a TEAE suggestive of drug abuse occurring in the esketamine + oral AD 
group were 7.2 times that of the placebo + oral AD group. In the double-blind trials, no fatal events 
were reported in either group, and only a single serious event was reported in the placebo + oral 
AD group vs. no cases in the esketamine + oral AD group. In the All Clinical Trials Population, 
4 (0.2%) events were serious, and none was fatal. In the double-blind trials, 93.1% of the events 
were mild or moderate in severity, with 6.9% of the events being severe in the esketamine + oral 
AD group vs. 3.5% in the placebo + oral AD group. In the All Clinical Trials Population, 93.9%
of  the  events  were  mild  or  moderate,  and  6.1%  of  the  events  were  severe.  Across  all  trials  of 
esketamine in TRD, TEAEs suggestive of drug abuse most commonly associated with esketamine 
were dizziness, somnolence, and dissociation. In the fixed-dose short-term trial, a higher incidence 
of  dissociation  was  observed  with  the  higher  esketamine  dose;  the  other  commonly  reported 
TEAEs suggestive of drug abuse did not show a dose effect. Across the TRD trials, the majority 
of TEAEs suggestive of drug abuse were transient and self-limiting, occurring and resolving on 
the day of dosing of esketamine nasal spray.
Dependence and attenuation have been reported with prolonged use of ketamine. Individuals who 
were  using  high  doses  on  a  frequent  basis  and  considered  dependent  on  ketamine  reported 
withdrawal symptoms of cravings, anxiety, shaking, sweating, and palpitations.
The Physician Withdrawal Checklist 20-Item (PWC-20) was administered in the TRD2003 trial 
and  Phase 3  trials  to  assess  potential  withdrawal  symptoms  following  cessation  of  esketamine 
nasal spray treatment. The categories of withdrawal symptom status were as follows: no symptom; 
improved;  symptom  present,  unchanged;  and  new  or  worsened  symptom.  Across trials,  most 
subjects  did  not  report  symptoms  on  the  PWC-20.  Reported  symptoms  were  primarily  mild  to 
moderate in severity. New or worsening symptoms that generally corresponded to worsening of 
depression  occurred  after  withdrawal  of  treatment.  Worsening  of  depression  symptoms  was 
observed  mostly  in  subjects  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  lack  of  therapeutic  response. 
Across TRD trials, commonly reported symptoms following discontinuation of esketamine nasal 
difficulty 
spray 
concentrating/remembering, dysphoric mood, depression, and irritability. In TRD trials including 
oral  AD  +  placebo  as  a  comparator,  these  same  symptoms  were  also  frequently  reported  by 
subjects  following  discontinuation  of  placebo.  These  reported  symptoms  were  consistent  with 
those  of  depression  and  anxiety.  In  the  long-term  maintenance  Trial  TRD3003,  based  on  the 
PWC-20 results, there appeared to be no difference between treatment arms (ie, esketamine + oral 
AD vs. placebo  + oral AD) for each of the 20 items, with no evidence suggestive of  a distinct 
withdrawal syndrome.

Major depressive disorder in patients who have current suicidal ideation or behavior
The  frequency  of  reported  TEAEs  suggestive  of  drug  abuse  was  2.4  times  higher  in  the 
esketamine + SOC group vs.  the  placebo  +  SOC  group  (64.9% vs.  27.3%).  The  OR  of  4.9 
(95% CI: 3.3, 7.3) indicated that the odds of a TEAE suggestive of drug abuse occurring in the 
esketamine + SOC group were 4.9 times that of the placebo + SOC group. No fatal events were 
56
reported in either group, and no serious events were reported in the esketamine + SOC group vs. 
2 serious events in the placebo + SOC group. Of the events reported, 94.7% were mild or moderate 
in severity, and severe events made up 4.7% of events in the esketamine + SOC group vs. 2.2% in
the placebo + SOC group. The most common TEAEs associated with esketamine suggestive of 
abuse  potential  were  dizziness,  dissociation, and  somnolence.  These  symptoms  were  generally
reported  shortly  after  dosing  on  the  day  of  esketamine  administration and were  transient  and 
self-limiting. No new patterns were identified in the MDSI clinical trials compared with the TRD 
clinical trials.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Risk  factors  and  groups  for  substance  abuse  include  mental  health  disorders  (eg,  depression,
anxiety,  and  bipolar  disorder),  stressful  environmental  factors,  taking  addictive  prescription 
medication, alcohol consumption, and family history of drug abuse and addiction.
Dependence  and  attenuation  to  SPRAVATO may  develop,  particularly  when  not  used  as 
prescribed (eg, taking high doses on a daily basis over an extended period of time) or in individuals 
with a history of drug abuse or dependence.
Preventability:
The  decision  to  prescribe  esketamine  should  be  determined  by  a  psychiatrist. SPRAVATO is 
available  by  special  and  restricted  medical  prescription  only  and  administered  under  the  direct 
supervision  of  a healthcare  professional.  The  risk  for  drug  abuse  is  mitigated  with  appropriate 
warnings and instructions in the EU PI, limited pack sizes, and legal controls (eg, restrictions on 
storage and prescribing) according to local legal requirements in Member States where esketamine 
is scheduled.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Significant clinical consequences of SPRAVATO abuse include attenuation and dependence if the 
product is used outside the approved indications and/or dose limits. The observed low incidence 
of  severe  TEAEs  suggestive  of  drug  abuse  and  the  lack  of  evidence  of  a  distinct  withdrawal 
syndrome after cessation of dosing based on PWC-20 scores suggest that the drug abuse potential 
for patients with TRD alone is low. Patients with comorbid TRD or MDSI and substance abuse 
disorders have not been studied; therefore, the risk in this population is unknown.
The  available  data  from  patients  with  TRD and  MDSI suggest  no  significant  impact  on  the 
risk-benefit balance of SPRAVATO. 
Public Health Impact:
SPRAVATO is administered under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional; therefore, 
the impact of drug abuse on public health is expected to be low.
57
Important Identified Risk – Transient dissociative states and perception disorders
Potential Mechanisms:
Transient dissociative states reflect a type of sensory or proprioceptive perceptual disorder and are 
expected  effects  of  esketamine  based  on  its  mechanism  of  action  as  a  non-competitive, 
non-selective,  open-channel  NMDAR  antagonist.  The  perceptual  side  effects  attenuate  with 
repeated  administration  and  intensify  with  higher  doses  (within  the  subanesthetic  dose  range), 
while  the  AD action  is  maintained  or  improves  over  repeated  treatments  and  appears  to  reach 
maximum AD effect at an intravenous ketamine dose of 0.5 mg/kg (Fava 2017), an intravenous 
esketamine  dose  of  0.2 mg/kg  (TRD2001),  and  an intranasal esketamine dose  of 84 mg 
(TRD3001  data).  Moreover,  the  perceptual/dissociative  side  effects  do  not  correlate  with 
improvement of depression symptoms (Fava 2017; TRD3001 and TRD3002 data). Additionally, 
there was insufficient evidence from mediation analyses on data collected in Trial TRD3002 that 
the AD effect of esketamine nasal spray (assessed by change in MADRS after initiation of the first 
dose  and  after  the  last  dose)  was  mediated  by  the  perceptual/dissociative  effects  (assessed  by 
change  in  Clinician  Administered  Dissociative  States  Scale  [CADSS] total  scores  40 minutes 
postdose). These findings suggest that distinct mechanisms may underlie the AD and perceptual 
actions. These mechanisms may depend on different subtypes of NMDARs.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Transient dissociative states and perception disorders are expected effects of SPRAVATO based 
on  esketamine’s  mechanism  of  action,  and  have  been  observed  in  all  phases  of  the  clinical 
development program.

Characterization of the Risk - Discussion:
Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder
The frequency of reported AEs related to dissociative states/perception disorders was 29.3% in the 
All  Clinical  Trials  Population  and  8.7 times  higher  in  the  esketamine  +  oral  AD  group  vs.  the 
placebo  +  oral  AD  group  in  the  double-blind  trials  (27.0%  vs.  3.1%).  The  OR  (95%  CI)  of 
11.6 (6.7, 21.5) indicated that the odds of a dissociative states/perception disorders-related TEAE
occurring in the esketamine + oral AD group were 11.6 times that of the placebo + oral AD group. 
In  the  double-blind  trials,  no  fatal  or  serious  events  were  reported  in  either  group.  No  fatal  or 
serious events were reported in the All Clinical Trials Population. In the double-blind trials, 92.3% 
of  the  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  with  7.6%  of  the  events  being  severe  in  the 
60
esketamine + oral AD group vs. none in the placebo + oral AD group. In the All Clinical Trials 
Population, 93.2% of the events were mild or moderate, and 6.9% of the events were severe. In 
the  All  Clinical  Trials  Population,  an  outcome of  “Recovered”  was  reported  for 594 (99.5%)
events, and an outcome of “Recovered with sequelae” was reported for 3 (0.5%) events. Follow-up 
information from the investigational sites received after the data lock point confirmed an outcome 
of “Recovered” for all events.
Across completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials in TRD, the most common psychological effects of 
esketamine  nasal  spray,  as  captured  using  the  CADSS,  were  dissociative  states/perception 
disorders  (including  distortion  of 
illusions),  derealization,  and 
depersonalization.  Changes  in  mean  CADSS  score  indicated  that  the onset  of dissociative 
states/perception  disorders  generally  occurred shortly  after  the  start  of  the  dose,  peaked  by 
40 minutes postdose, and resolved by 1.5 hours postdose.
time  and  space  and 
Transient  dissociative  states/perception  disorders  (based  on  the  CADSS  scores,  overall  TEAE 
incidence rates, and severe TEAE incidence rates) were more pronounced in subjects receiving 
higher doses of esketamine nasal spray.
Across the TRD trials, the peak mean CADSS total score at the 40-minute timepoint in subjects 
treated  with  esketamine  nasal  spray  decreased  with  consecutive  doses.  This  attenuation  of 
dissociative states/perception disorders was reflected in the changes in mean CADSS total score 
and  mean  component  scores  in  the  short-term  trials  in  adults  and  elderly  subjects,  the  relapse 
prevention  trial,  and  the  long-term  safety  trial.  Consistent  with  CADSS  findings,  rates  of  the 
TEAEs of dissociation and perceptual effects and of the AEs of “feeling abnormal” and “feeling 
drunk” decreased  with  subsequent intranasal  dosing  sessions in  the  pooled  short-term  trials.  A 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics model also showed an attenuation of the dissociative effects 
of esketamine nasal spray over the initial 4 weeks of treatment.
Major depressive disorder in patients who have current suicidal ideation or behavior
The frequency of reported TEAEs related to dissociative states/perception disorders was 4.9 times 
higher in the esketamine + SOC group vs. the placebo + SOC group (40.1% vs. 8.2%). The OR of 
7.5 (95% CI: 4.4, 13.1) indicated that the odds of a TEAE related to dissociative states/perception 
disorders occurring in the esketamine + SOC  group were 7.5 times that of  the placebo + SOC 
group. No fatal events were reported in either group, and only 1 serious event was reported in the 
esketamine + SOC group vs. none in the placebo + SOC group. Of the events reported, 88.6% 
were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  and 10.7%  were severe  in the esketamine + SOC  group  vs. 
4.8% in the placebo + SOC group. The outcome was reported as “Recovered” for all events in both 
groups. Similar event characteristics (transient and generally occurring on the day of dosing) were
observed in the MDSI clinical trials compared to the TRD clinical trials and no new patterns were 
identified.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Risk factors for transient dissociative states and perception disorders are unknown.
61
There is a dose-response relationship between the esketamine dose and the severity of transient 
dissociative states/perception disorders, which is attenuated with repeated doses.
Preventability:
The  decision  to  prescribe  esketamine  should  be  determined  by  a  psychiatrist.  SPRAVATO  is 
available by special and restricted medical prescription only and is administered under the direct 
supervision  of  a healthcare  professional.  Serious  outcomes  of  dissociative  states/perception 
disorders  may  be  minimized by  advising  healthcare  professionals and  patients  about  expected 
transient  states/perception  disorders, by  advising  healthcare  professionals about monitoring 
patients postdose until the patient is considered stable based on clinical judgement, and by advising 
patients not to drive or operate machinery until the day after treatment, following a restful sleep.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Given that dissociative states/perception disorders observed in the clinical trials were transient, 
self-limiting,  and  without  clinically  significant  adverse  outcomes,  the  overall  impact  on  the 
risk-benefit balance of the product is considered low; however, the impact on an individual patient 
may be significant. 
Public Health Impact:
The  risk  of  transient  dissociative  states/perception  disorders  is  managed  through guidance 
provided in the EU PI, the Healthcare Professional Guide, the Patient Guide, and the Healthcare 
Professional Checklist; therefore, the impact of transient dissociative states/perception disorders
on public health is expected to be low.
Important Identified Risk – Disturbances in consciousness
Potential Mechanisms:
At AD doses, the side effects that follow administration of SPRAVATO, including sedation, are 
induced by primary or secondary actions of NMDAR antagonism, which is why these symptoms 
diminish rapidly with the decline in esketamine plasma levels.
However, unlike dissociation and AD responses, the sedative responses are variable from time to 
time  in  the  same  individual,  suggesting  that  there  are  confounding  factors  that  are  not  fully 
understood. An important mechanism for some of the outlying sedation effects was concomitant 
benzodiazepine use; thus, the addition of concomitant medications needs to be considered in the 
mechanism for the observed sedation.  From the pharmacological target point of view, sedation 
might require directly engaging potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-
gated  (HCN) channels  by  ketamine  or  esketamine  and/or  γ-amino  butyric  acid (GABA)
stimulation from other sources. There is convincing evidence of the involvement of HCN in the 
sedation effects of ketamine and esketamine at higher concentrations.
62
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Disturbances  in  consciousness  such  as  sedation  and  somnolence  are  expected  effects  of 
SPRAVATO based on esketamine’s mechanism of action, and have been observed in all phases 
of the clinical development program.

Characterization of the Risk - Discussion:
Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder
The  frequency  of reported  AEs  related  to  disturbances  in  consciousness  was  25.8% in  the  All 
Clinical  Trials  Population  and  2.9 times  higher  in  the  esketamine  +  oral  AD  group  vs.  the 
placebo + oral  AD  group  in  the  double-blind  trials  (21.7%  vs.  7.4%).  The  OR  (95%  CI)  of 
3.5 (2.3, 5.3) indicated that the odds of a disturbance in consciousness-related TEAE occurring in 
the  esketamine  +  oral  AD  group  were 3.5  times  that  of  the  placebo  +  oral  AD  group.  In  the 
double-blind trials, no  fatal or serious events were  reported in either  group.  In the All Clinical 
Trials  Population,  1  (0.2%) event was reported  to  be  serious,  and  none  was fatal.  In  the 
double-blind trials, 94.8% of the events were mild or moderate in severity, with 5.2% of the events 
being severe in the esketamine + oral AD group vs. 2.6% in the placebo + oral AD group. In the 
All Clinical Trials Population, 95.5% of the events were mild or moderate, and 4.5% of the events 
64
were severe. In the All Clinical Trials Population, an outcome of “Recovered” or “Recovering”
was reported for 503 (99.2%) events, and an outcome of “Not recovered” was reported for 4 (0.8%) 
events.
Most (>96%) reported TEAEs of somnolence or  sedation occurred on the day of dosing in the 
short-term  and  long-term  Phase  3  trials/trial  phases  in  TRD  and  of  these,  ≥95%  resolved 
spontaneously the same day. The frequency of TEAEs of somnolence reported on each dosing day 
was relatively stable across time.
responses  on 
the  pattern  of 
Based  on 
the  Modified  Observer’s  Assessment  of 
Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) in the Phase 2 and 3 trials in TRD, sedative effects of esketamine 
were generally mild, had an onset shortly after the nasal spray dosing peaking at 30 to 45 minutes 
postdose, and typically resolved by 1 to 1.5 hours postdose. Among esketamine treatment groups, 
10% or fewer subjects across the Phase 3 trials/trial phases in TRD had an MOAA/S score of 3 or 
less (corresponding to moderate or greater sedation) on a dosing day, although the occurrence of 
these scores was higher than that for the oral AD + placebo group. Across the Phase 3 trials in 
TRD, 10 of the 1,601 subjects treated with esketamine + oral AD (and 1 of the 432 subjects who 
received oral AD + placebo), had an MOAA/S score of 0 (no reaction to painful stimulus [trapezius 
squeeze]) and/or 1 (response to trapezius squeeze, including purposeful and reflexive withdrawal). 
These isolated instances of severe sedation generally did not repeat with subsequent dosing.
Among  subjects  with  an MOAA/S  score  of  ≤3  (including  those  with  a  score  of  0)  across  the 
Phase 3  trials in  TRD,  no  symptoms  of  respiratory  distress  were  observed,  and  hemodynamic 
parameters (including vital signs and oxygen saturation) remained within normal ranges. There 
were no TEAEs of respiratory depression among esketamine-treated subjects across the Phase 1, 
2 or 3 trials in TRD, and no subjects across these trials required cardiovascular resuscitation or 
other medical interventions.
Major depressive disorder in patients who have current suicidal ideation or behavior
The frequency of reported TEAEs related to disturbances in consciousness was 2.4 times higher 
in  the  esketamine  +  SOC  group  vs.  the  placebo  +  SOC  group  (29.4%  vs.  12.5%).  The  OR  of 
2.9 (95% CI: 1.8, 4.8) indicated that the odds of a TEAE related to disturbances in consciousness 
occurring in the esketamine + SOC group were 2.9 times that of the placebo + SOC group. No 
fatal or serious events were reported in either group. Of the events reported, 98.8% were mild or 
moderate  in  severity,  and  1.2%  was  severe  in  the  esketamine  +  SOC  group  vs.  none  in  the 
placebo + SOC  group.  The  outcome  was  reported  as  “Recovered”  for  all  events in  the 
esketamine + SOC group vs. 97.1% of events in the placebo + SOC group.
65
Sedation was measured objectively using the MOAA/S scale and also evaluated based on TEAE 
reporting. Based on the MOAA/S, sedative effects were generally mild, had an onset shortly after 
the start of dosing, and typically resolved by 1 to 1.5 hours postdose. The TEAEs of somnolence 
and sedation occurred on the day of intranasal dosing and resolved spontaneously the same day.
Discontinuations due to somnolence and sedation occurred in isolated cases in the Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 MDSI trials. In the cases of sedation, no symptoms of respiratory distress were observed, 
and  vital  signs  and  oxygen  saturation  remained  within  normal  ranges. No  new  patterns  were 
identified in the MDSI clinical trials compared with the TRD clinical trials.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Risk factors for sedation include old age (elderly patients) and use of concomitant sedatives.
Preventability:
The decision to prescribe esketamine should be determined by a psychiatrist. Serious outcomes 
resulting  from disturbances  in  consciousness may  be  minimized by  advising  healthcare 
professionals and  patients  about  expected  disturbances  in  consciousness  (ie,  sedation, 
somnolence), monitoring patients postdose until patients are considered stable based on clinical 
judgement, and advising patients not to drive or operate machinery until the day after treatment, 
following a restful sleep.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Although a sedative effect was consistently observed during the clinical development program, no 
severe consequences of somnolence and sedation have been reported in clinical trials. However, 
somnolence/sedation may impact a patient’s ability to drive or use machinery and may increase 
the patient’s risk of accidents, falls, or dangerous behavior, particularly if patients are allowed to 
leave too soon after SPRAVATO administration. Therefore, the overall impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product is considered low to moderate.
Public Health Impact:
The risk of disturbances in consciousness (somnolence and sedation) is minimized by guidance 
provided  in  the  EU  PI  and  additional  risk  minimization  materials;  therefore,  the  impact  of 
disturbances in consciousness on public health is expected to be low.
Important Identified Risk – Blood pressure increased
Potential Mechanisms:
Cardiovascular  effects  of  ketamine  and  esketamine  at  subanesthetic  doses  include  transient 
increases in blood pressure in some subjects. The primary target of both agents at such doses is
NMDARs. In addition to producing a transient increase in glutamate release in the brain, a single 
administration  of  ketamine  at  subanesthetic  doses  increases  dopamine  and  norepinephrine  in 
several  brain  regions.  These  effects  can  be  explained  by  their  direct  inhibition  of  interneurons 
through NMDARs. One plausible explanation for their cardiovascular side effects is that, through 
66
inhibition  of 
catecholaminergic neurons, resulting in increased sympathetic nervous system activity.
these  agents  stimulate  excitatory  neurons  and 
interneurons  directly, 
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Cardiovascular  effects due to increased blood pressure are expected for  SPRAVATO  based on 
esketamine’s mechanism of action (sympathomimetic effect; direct stimulation of the CNS that 
leads to increased sympathetic nervous system outflow). Transient increases in blood pressure, as 
well  as  cardiovascular  and  blood  pressure-related  events,  in  association  with  esketamine  nasal 
spray have been reported in the completed randomized, double-blind, controlled and open-label 
clinical trials. In clinical trials, elevations of blood pressure were transient, generally self-limiting, 
and did not require intervention.
Characterization of the Risk - Data:
The  below  tables  summarize  the  clinical  trial  data  for  TEAEs  of  increased  blood  pressure 
(Table SVII.4a and Table SVII.4b) and TEAEs of cardiac arrhythmias, as supportive data related 
to the blood pressure risk (Table SVII.5a and Table SVII.5b).

Characterization of the Risk - Discussion:
Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder
The frequency of reported AEs related to increased blood pressure was 12.8% in the All Clinical 
Trials Population and 3.0 times higher in the esketamine + oral AD group vs. the placebo + oral 
AD group in the double-blind trials (11.6% vs. 3.9%). The OR (95% CI) of 3.2 (1.9, 5.8) indicated 
that the odds of an event related to increased blood pressure occurring in the esketamine + oral AD 
group were 3.2 times that of the placebo + oral AD group. In the double-blind trials, no fatal events 
were reported in either group; 1 serious event was reported in the esketamine + oral AD group vs. 
no events in the placebo + oral AD group. In the All Clinical Trials Population, 2 (0.8%) events 
were reported to be serious, and none was fatal. In the double-blind trials, 98.6% of the events 
were mild or moderate in severity, with 1.4% of the events being severe in the esketamine + oral 
71
AD group vs none in the placebo + oral AD group. In the All Clinical Trials Population, 98.5% of 
the events were mild or moderate, and 1.5% of the events were severe.
Transient  increases  in  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP) and  diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP) were 
observed  shortly  after  esketamine  nasal  spray  administration,  reaching  maximum  within 
40 minutes, at the time of peak plasma esketamine levels, and generally returning to values close 
to pre-treatment within 1.5 hours after administration. Reported increases in blood pressure were 
primarily  asymptomatic.  Most  of  the  TEAEs  associated  with  elevated  blood  pressure  were 
transient and mild or moderate in severity. The largest mean maximum blood pressure increases 
across all intranasal dosing days compared with predose values in the total esketamine + oral AD 
group  in  pooled  short-term  trials  (TRD3001  and  TRD3002)  were  13.3  mm  Hg  (SBP)  and 
8.7 mm Hg  (DBP),  compared  with  the  corresponding  blood  pressure  increases  of  6.1  mm  Hg 
(SBP) and 4.9 mm Hg (DBP) in subjects receiving placebo + oral AD.
Markedly abnormal blood pressure elevations (defined as SBP of at least 180 mm Hg and/or DBP 
of at least 110 mm Hg, and categorized per trial criteria as acute hypertension) were reported at 
rates ranging from 2.0% to 11.1% across Phase 3 trials in TRD. These occurred primarily within 
1.5 hours after dosing. These markedly abnormal blood pressure increases were reported at higher 
rates  in  subjects  with  a  history  of  hypertension  as  compared  to  subjects  without  a  history  of 
hypertension  (pooled  TRD3001/3002  trials:  7.6%  vs.  4.3%;  long-term  safety  Trial  TRD3004: 
7.3% vs. 2.9%; relapse-prevention trial TRD3003 [any phase]: 5.5% vs. 4.1%). In the short-term 
trials, markedly abnormal blood pressure increases occurred at a higher rate in elderly subjects vs. 
younger adults (11.1% vs. 4.9%).
The frequency of AEs related to reported cardiac arrhythmia was 3.0% in the All Clinical Trials 
Population and 2.0 times higher in the esketamine + oral AD  group vs. the placebo + oral AD 
group in the double-blind trials (1.6% vs. 0.8%). The OR (95% CI) of 1.9 (0.5, 8.6) indicated that 
there was insufficient evidence to support that the true OR of cardiac arrhythmia-related events 
was greater than 1 when comparing esketamine + oral AD to placebo + oral AD. No fatal or serious 
events were reported in either group in the double-blind trials. In the All Clinical Trials Population, 
1 (1.8%) event was reported to be serious, and none was fatal. In the double-blind trials, 90.0% of 
the events were mild or moderate in severity, with 1 event (10.0%) being severe in the esketamine 
+ oral AD group and none in the placebo + oral AD group. In the All Clinical Trials Population, 
96.5% of the events were mild or moderate, and 3.5% of the events were severe.
In a QT study to assess the effects of esketamine nasal spray on cardiac repolarization in healthy 
adults (ESKETINTRD1013), therapeutic and supratherapeutic exposure to esketamine produced 
by an 84 mg dose of esketamine nasal spray and a 0.8 mg/kg intravenous infusion of esketamine, 
respectively,  did  not  prolong  the  QT/QTc  interval,  according  to  the  International  Council  for 
Harmonisation  of  Technical  Requirements  for  Pharmaceuticals  for  Human  Use  (ICH) E14 
guideline, based on a trial-specific power model and Fridericia’s correction methods. There were 
no notable trends or meaningful differences for QT interval, PR interval, and QRS interval over 
the 30-hour postdose timepoints when esketamine (84 mg nasal spray or 0.8 mg/kg intravenous 
infusion) was compared with placebo.
72
Major depressive disorder in patients who have current suicidal ideation or behavior
The frequency of reported TEAEs related to increased blood pressure was 2.3 times higher in the 
esketamine  +  SOC group vs.  the  placebo  +  SOC  group  (13.7%  vs.  5.9%).  The  OR  of  2.6 
(95% CI: 1.3, 5.2) indicated that the odds of a TEAE related to increased blood pressure occurring 
in the esketamine + SOC group were 2.6 times that of the placebo + SOC group. No fatal or serious 
events  were  reported  in  either  group.  Of  the  events  reported,  88.8%  were  mild  or moderate  in 
severity, and 11.1% were severe in the esketamine + SOC group vs. none in the placebo + SOC 
group. The outcome was reported as “Recovered” for all events in the esketamine + SOC group
vs. 94.1% of events in the placebo + SOC group. No new patterns were identified in the MDSI 
clinical trials compared to the TRD clinical trials.
The frequency of arrhythmia-related events was 2.6 times higher in the esketamine + SOC group
vs. the placebo + SOC group (4.2% vs 1.6%), and all events were mild or moderate in severity.
The OR of 2.8 (95% CI: 0.8, 12.0) indicated that there was insufficient evidence to support that 
the  true  OR  of  cardiac  arrhythmia-related  events  was  greater  than  1  when  comparing 
esketamine + SOC to placebo + SOC. No fatal, serious, or severe events were reported in either 
group. The outcome was reported as “Recovered” for all events in both groups. No new patterns 
were identified in the MDSI clinical trials compared to the TRD clinical trials.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
The risk of cardiovascular effects is greater in patients for whom an increase in blood pressure 
poses a serious risk, for example:



Patients who recently experienced a cardiovascular event, including myocardial infarction;
Patients with aneurysmal vascular disease (including intracranial, thoracic aorta, abdominal 
aorta, or peripheral arterial vessels);
Patients with history of intracerebral hemorrhage.
Preventability:
The decision to prescribe esketamine should be determined by a psychiatrist. SPRAVATO should 
not be administered to patients for whom blood pressure elevation poses a serious risk. To reduce 
the  risk  of  blood  pressure-related  events,  blood  pressure  should  be  monitored  at  each  dosing 
session,  predose  and  postdose.  Postdose  monitoring  should  be  performed  by  healthcare
professionals with training in blood pressure monitoring.
Blood  pressure  monitoring  equipment is  required at  each  clinic/facility  where  SPRAVATO is 
administered.
Predose  thresholds  and  recommendations  regarding  blood  pressure  assessments  and  actions  to 
manage blood pressure elevation are provided in the SmPC.
73
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Due to the transient and self-limiting nature of the cardiovascular effects observed in clinical trials, 
the  overall  impact  of  increased  blood  pressure  on  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  SPRAVATO is 
considered low; however, the impact on an individual patient may be significant. 
Public Health Impact:
SPRAVATO administration takes place under the direct supervision of a healthcare professional; 
therefore, the impact of blood pressure increased on public health is expected to be low.
Important Potential Risk - Cognitive disorders and memory impairment (long-term use)
Potential Mechanisms:
The  literature  remains  unclear  regarding  irreversible  cognitive  effects,  including  memory 
impairment, after chronic use of ketamine. 
Both  esketamine  and  ketamine  are  noncompetitive,  nonselective,  activity-dependent  NMDAR 
antagonists. The neuropsychiatric side effects of these medications are likely to be triggered by 
NMDAR blockade.  Other  receptors,  ion  channels,  and  neurotransmitter  transporters  may  also 
contribute to the cognitive disorders and memory impairment, especially in polydrug users and 
when much higher doses of ketamine and esketamine are used.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Long-term  cognitive  disorders  and  memory  impairment  have  been  reported  with  long-term 
ketamine use or drug abuse.  These effects did not  increase over time and were reversible after 
ketamine discontinuation.  The  effect  of  esketamine  nasal  spray  on  cognitive  functioning  was 
evaluated in long-term clinical trials, and results generally showed that performance on cognitive 
tests was slightly improved or remained stable.

Characterization of the Risk - Discussion:
A literature review summarized several studies that examined cognitive function in ketamine users. 
Infrequent or recreational ketamine use did not appear to be associated with long-term cognitive 
impairment. The most robust findings were that frequent ketamine users (>4 times a week), taking 
an average dose of 3.80 (± 2.36) grams per session, exhibited impairments in both short- and long-
term memory (Morgan 2009). Frequent ketamine users were also impaired on cognitive testing 
after long-term use (12 months) (Morgan 2010).
Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder
The frequency of reported AEs related to cognitive disorders and memory impairment was 4.1%
in the All Clinical Trials Population and 2.1 times higher in the esketamine + oral AD group vs. 
the  placebo  +  oral  AD  group  in  the  double-blind  trials  (3.9%  vs.  1.9%).  The  OR  (95%  CI)  of 
76
2.1 (0.9,  5.3)  indicated  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to  support  that  the  true  OR  of  a 
cognitive  disorders-related  or memory  impairment-related  event  was  greater  than  1  when 
comparing esketamine + oral AD to placebo + oral AD. No fatal or serious events were reported 
in either group in the double-blind trials, and no fatal or serious events were reported in the All 
Clinical Trials Population. In the double-blind trials, 92.3% of the events in the esketamine + oral 
AD  group  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity,  with  2  (7.7%)  of  the  events  being  severe  in  the 
esketamine + AD group compared with 1 event (11.1%) in the placebo + oral AD group. In the 
All Clinical Trials Population, 97.6% of the events were mild or moderate, and 2.5% of the events 
were severe. In the All Clinical Trials Population, the outcome was reported as “Recovered” for
74 (92.5%) events and “Not recovered” for 6 (7.5%) events. Of the 6 events with an outcome of 
“Not recovered”, only 2 events (amnesia and memory impairment) occurred in the esketamine + 
oral AD group; follow-up information from the investigational sites received after the data lock 
point confirmed an outcome of “Recovered” for these 2 events.
No TEAEs corresponding to the PT Cognitive disorder or the PT Cognitive motor disorder were 
reported in the Phase 3 trials in TRD.
In  the  Phase 3  short-term  trials in  TRD,  performance  on  each  of  the  cognitive  tests  was either 
improved from baseline or appeared stable relative to baseline, both at the end of the double-blind 
induction phase and at the 2-week follow-up assessment. These results indicated that treatment 
with esketamine + oral AD for up to 4 weeks did not influence any aspect of cognition studied in 
adult subjects with TRD and was not associated with any systematic changes in cognition in the 
elderly subjects. Similarly, comparison of the results for the double-blind maintenance phase of 
the  relapse  prevention  trial  TRD3003  showed  no  evidence  for  deterioration  of  cognitive 
performance with repeated, longer-term intermittent esketamine dosing. Specifically, during the 
maintenance phase, performance in the esketamine + oral AD and the placebo + oral AD groups 
improved or remained similar to that at baseline on all cognitive tests, including tests of simple 
and choice reaction time, visual memory, verbal memory, visuospatial memory and sequencing, 
and working memory.
In long-term safety and maintenance trials, the performance on each of the cognitive tests relative 
to baseline demonstrated an improvement or remained stable in each treatment phase. In elderly 
subjects,  while  performance  on  5  tests  of  higher  cognitive  functioning  improved  or  remained 
stable,  simple  and  choice  reaction  time  showed  slowing  that  began  at  Week  20  of  the 
optimization/maintenance  phase.  While  a  slowing  of  processing  speed  was  observed,  with 
maximal effect at Week 44, there was no evidence of broader attention deficit.
Results  of a Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial (ESKETINTRD1005) in 
healthy volunteers showed that a single esketamine 84 mg dose produced a transient decline in 
cognitive function at 40 minutes postdose, which resolved by 2 hours postdose.
Major depressive disorder in patients who have current suicidal ideation or behavior
The  frequency  of  reported  TEAEs  related  to  cognitive  disorders  and  memory  impairment  was 
2.6 times higher in the esketamine + SOC group vs. the placebo + SOC group (3.1% vs. 1.2%). 
The OR of 2.7 (95% CI: 0.6, 15.7) indicated that there was insufficient evidence to support that 
77
the true OR of an event related to cognitive disorders and memory impairment was greater than 1 
when comparing esketamine + SOC to placebo + SOC. No fatal or serious events were reported 
in either group. Of the events reported, 88.9% were mild or moderate in severity, and 11.1% were 
severe in the esketamine + SOC group vs. none in the placebo + SOC group. The outcome was 
reported as “Recovered” for 88.9% of the events in the esketamine + SOC group vs. all events in 
the placebo + SOC group. No new patterns were identified in the MDSI clinical trials compared 
with the TRD clinical trials.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Patients at risk for cognitive disorders and memory impairment are those who use SPRAVATO
for an extended period. A study that evaluated the long-term cognitive consequences of ketamine 
use found that frequent ketamine users (>4 times per week) were impaired on cognitive testing 
after long-term use (12 months)  while infrequent ketamine users (<4 times a week, but at least 
once a month) and ex-users did not show any long-term cognitive impairment (Morgan 2010).
Preventability:
The decision to prescribe esketamine should be determined by a psychiatrist. Long-term cognitive 
impairment  may be  prevented  through  proper  use  of  SPRAVATO,  including  an intermittent 
exposure regimen at recommended doses of 28 mg, 56 mg, and 84 mg for TRD and 56 mg and 
84 mg for MDSI.
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Given the recommended intermittent dosing frequency for SPRAVATO, and considering that most 
events related to cognitive disorders and memory impairment following long-term use in clinical 
trials  were  neither  severe  nor  serious,  were  generally  self-limiting,  and  resolved  without 
intervention, the impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product is expected to be low.
Public Health Impact:
The risk of cognitive disorders and memory impairment following long-term use is minimized by 
guidance provided in the EU PI and is not likely to have a significant impact on public health. 
SPRAVATO use in the general population is not anticipated to be wide; therefore, the impact of 
cognitive disorders and memory impairment on public health is expected to be low.
Important Potential Risk – Interstitial cystitis (long-term use)
Potential Mechanisms:
Interstitial cystitis is common in chronic ketamine abusers who tend to use a much higher dose 
and frequency (average of 2.77 g/day for an average of 20 days/month) (Kalsi 2011) than is used 
for depression. The mechanism by which an excessive amount of ketamine or its metabolites are 
associated  with  cystitis  is  not  known  but  appears  complex,  involving  multiple  pathways 
(Jhang 2015). Ketamine and its metabolites appear to affect bladder neurological pathways and 
78
the urothelium and underlying subcutaneous tissues, although the mechanisms remain unknown 
(Tsai 2015). Proposed mechanisms include (Chu 2008):
 Direct effect of ketamine or its metabolites on bladder interstitial tissues;
 Microvascular  changes  in  the  bladder  and  possibly  the  kidney  by  ketamine  and/or  its 
metabolites;


Indirect effect of ketamine by causing an autoimmune reaction against the bladder urothelium 
and submucosa due to circulating ketamine or urinary ketamine and its metabolites;
Bacterial infection.
There is no clear evidence that the repeated, pulsed administration of ketamine or esketamine at 
subanesthetic doses causes persistent interstitial cystitis.
Evidence Source(s) and Strength of Evidence:
Cystitis and lower urinary tract symptoms have been reported with ketamine in long-term street 
users or with higher doses (>10-fold therapeutic use). In a comprehensive literature review, the 
reported  chronic  physical  effects  of  high-dose,  near-daily,  long-term  ketamine  use  included 
ulcerative interstitial cystitis. Cases reported in the literature have linked ketamine abuse to cystitis.
Similar  effects  may  potentially  occur  following  esketamine abuse.  In  clinical  trials  with 
esketamine  nasal  spray,  there  was  a  higher  rate  of  lower  urinary  tract  symptoms  (pollakiuria, 
dysuria, micturition urgency, nocturia, and cystitis) in esketamine-treated patients than in patients
who received placebo. No cases of esketamine nasal spray-related interstitial cystitis have been 
observed in clinical trials, which involved treatment for up to a year.

No events related to interstitial cystitis were reported in the MDSI clinical trials.

Characterization of the Risk - Discussion:
Ketamine-related  cystitis  is  characterized  by  urinary  frequency/urgency,  urge  incontinence, 
dysuria, and bladder pain. A contracted bladder and bladder wall thickening are typically observed. 
Ulcerative cystitis with bleeding mucosa has been reported with long-term use and at high doses. 
The  urothelium  is  denuded  and  is  infiltrated  by  inflammatory  cells,  such  as  mast  cells  and 
eosinophils  (Jhang  2015; Tsai 2015). Symptoms  of  ketamine-related cystitis generally improve 
after discontinuing ketamine abuse. However, severe bladder pain, upper urinary tract damage, 
including  hydronephrosis,  and  kidney  injury  can  develop  in  patients  who  continue  to  abuse 
ketamine over a long period of time (Tsai 2015).
Cystitis was an AE of special interest and was assessed during the clinical trial program.
Treatment-resistant major depressive disorder
Although no cases of interstitial cystitis considered related to esketamine or cases suggestive of 
irreversible bladder damage were reported in any trials of esketamine nasal spray in TRD, a higher 
rate  of  lower  urinary  tract  symptoms  was  observed  (pollakiuria,  dysuria,  micturition  urgency, 
nocturia, and cystitis) in esketamine-treated patients compared with patients who received placebo. 
Other  reported  urinary  TEAEs  included  urinary  tract  infection,  cystitis,  cystitis  bacterial, 
pyelonephritis, and pyelonephritis acute. The events that were considered of clinical relevance, as 
they appeared to show a temporal relationship with esketamine administration in some subjects 
and were assessed by the investigators as drug-related, included urinary hesitation, oliguria, and 
urinary incontinence.
The frequency of TEAEs suggestive of interstitial cystitis in the All Clinical Trials Population was 
0.7% (n=12). In the double-blind trials, only 3 cases (0.5%) were reported in the esketamine + oral 
AD  group  vs.  1  case  in  the  placebo  +  oral  AD  group  (0.2%),  which  was  below  the  expected 
incidence in the treated population. The OR (95% CI) of 2.6 (0.2, 134.8) indicated that there was 
insufficient evidence to support that the true OR of an interstitial cystitis-related event was greater 
than 1 when comparing esketamine + oral AD with placebo + oral AD. None of the reported events 
in  the  double-blind  trials  (both  treatment  groups)  and  the  All  Clinical  Trials  Population  was
serious, and none was fatal. All reported events in the double-blind trials and the All Clinical Trials 
Population were mild or moderate in severity, with no severe events reported.
Major depressive disorder in patients who have current suicidal ideation or behavior
No cases were retrieved from the MDSI clinical trials.
Risk Factors and Risk Groups:
Patients at risk for cystitis include those who use SPRAVATO for a long period or at higher doses 
than prescribed.
81
Preventability:
The decision to prescribe esketamine should be determined by a psychiatrist. Early detection of 
cystitis may mitigate its seriousness. Patients with symptoms of cystitis should be referred to a 
specialist  for  diagnostic  workup,  if  required.  Further  testing  may  include  additional  urinalysis, 
cystoscopy, ultrasound, or biopsy of the bladder. Treatment generally includes discontinuation of 
esketamine and urological treatment similar to that for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome
(Tsai 2015).
Impact on the Risk-benefit Balance of the Product:
Interstitial cystitis is a serious adverse reaction that may result in persistent or significant disability 
or incapacity. Given that no cases of esketamine-related interstitial cystitis were observed in any 
of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials,  which involved treatment for up to 1 year, the impact on the 
risk-benefit  balance  of  the  product  is  expected  to  be  low.  With  intermittent  exposure  at  the 
recommended doses of 28 mg, 56 mg, and 84 mg for TRD and 56 mg or 84 mg for MDSI, the 
bladder has sufficient time between dosing sessions for self-repair from any irritation.
Public Health Impact:
SPRAVATO use in the general population is not anticipated to be wide; therefore, the impact of 
cystitis on public health is expected to be low.

Blood pressure increased.
The  specific  objectives  of  the  Healthcare  Professional  Guide  are  to  increase 
awareness of appropriate product administration (ie, under the direct supervision 
of a healthcare professional), to increase awareness of the need for monitoring of 
blood  pressure  before  and  after  dosing  under  the  supervision  of  a  healthcare 
professional, and to educate healthcare professionals about the following:
 Whether a patient is eligible to use SPRAVATO;








The  risk  for  abuse,  including  risk  factors/groups,  signs  of  abuse  and 
dependence, and the need to assess and monitor for this risk;
Expected transient dissociative states/perception disorders and disturbances 
in consciousness and how to minimize potential adverse outcome from such 
effects;
Assessment, monitoring, and managing increased blood pressure, including 
hypertensive crisis;
Expected cardiovascular adverse effects;
The  need  for  patient  observation  under  the  supervision  of  a  healthcare 
professional during and after dosing until the patient is stable based on clinical 
judgement;
The need for postdose monitoring by healthcare professionals with training in 
blood pressure monitoring;
Only  to  initiate  treatment  with  SPRAVATO in  patients  with  clinically 
significant or unstable cardiovascular or respiratory conditions if the benefit 
outweighs the risk. In these patients, SPRAVATO should be administered in 
a  setting  where  appropriate  resuscitation  equipment  and  healthcare 
professionals with training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation are available.

activity:
Ketamine  is  a  drug  of  abuse,  as  it  induces  psychological  effects  including 
dissociation and other perceptual distortions; alterations in cognition; and changes 
in  mood.  Ketamine  dependence  has  been  reported  in  the  literature.  There  is  an 
attenuation  of  the  dissociative effects.  Evidence  from  an  esketamine  abuse 
potential study suggests that the potential for abuse is similar to that of ketamine.

based  on  esketamine’s  mechanism  of  action.  Transient  dissociative  states  and 
perception  disorders,  disturbances  in  consciousness,  and  transient  increases  in 
blood  pressure  have  been  observed  in  the  clinical  development  program  for 
esketamine nasal spray. 
The Healthcare Professional Guide helps healthcare professionals to understand 
the key risks for SPRAVATO and is considered an essential additional measure to 
ensure  proper,  safe,  and  effective  use  of  the product. Educating  healthcare 
professionals is  important,  especially  considering  that  SPRAVATO requires 
specific measures before and after dosing.

Transient dissociative states and perception disorders, 
Disturbances in consciousness, and
Blood pressure increased.
The objectives of the Patient Guide are to:



Provide education about what adverse effects to expect and how to minimize 
those effects;
Provide  education  about  the  risk  for  abuse  and  dependence,  including  risk 
factors/groups,  signs  of  abuse  and  dependence,  and  the  need to  assess  and 
monitor for this risk;
Provide  education  about
the  drug  administration  procedure,  including 
preparation  (eg,  fasting  for  2 hours,  no  drinking  for  30  minutes)  and 
monitoring during the visit.


Increase awareness of:
 Appropriate product administration (ie, under the direct supervision of a 
healthcare professional);


The need for monitoring of blood pressure before and after dosing under 
the supervision of a healthcare professional and the need for postdose 
observation until the healthcare professional decides that the patient is

Objectives:
The  use  of  a checklist  allows  for  an  objective  basis  on  which  the  healthcare 
professional can  determine  when  a  patient  is  stable  and  may  safely leave  the 
postadministration  monitoring  setting. The  Healthcare  Professional  Checklist 
addresses the following important identified risks: Transient dissociative states and

Objectives:
The  objective  of  the  Controlled  Access  Program  is  to  minimize  the  important 
identified risk of Drug abuse:


SPRAVATO is dispensed to the healthcare setting where administration takes 
place (as agreed at the Member State level based on local legal requirements 
and/or local healthcare systems);
SPRAVATO is administered in the appropriate setting. Requirements include 
blood  pressure  monitoring  equipment  and  acknowledgement  of  receipt  of 
additional  educational  materials (Healthcare  Professional  Guide,  Patient 
Guide,  Healthcare  Professional  Checklist),  which  will  be  agreed  at  the
Member State level with each NCA.
The details of the program are to be tailored to the Member State and agreed with 
the NCA prior to launch of the product.

PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
Summary of Risk Management Plan for SPRAVATO (Esketamine Nasal Spray)
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) for SPRAVATO (esketamine nasal spray). 
The RMP  details important risks  of SPRAVATO, how these risks  can  be minimized, and how 
more  information  will  be  obtained  about  SPRAVATO’s  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing 
information).
SPRAVATO’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how SPRAVATO should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for SPRAVATO should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
SPRAVATO’s RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What it is Used For
SPRAVATO is authorized for use as an antidepressant in adults with treatment-resistant major 
depressive disorder (TRD) or acute short-term treatment of psychiatric emergency due to major 
depressive  disorder (see  SmPC  for  the  full  indications).  It  contains  an  aqueous  solution  of 
esketamine  hydrochloride  as  the  active  substance  within  a  single-use  nasal  spray  device  that 
delivers two sprays, one spray to each nostril. 
Further information about the evaluation of SPRAVATO’s benefits can be found in SPRAVATO’s 
EPAR,  including in its plain-language summary,  available on the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) 
webpage:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/spravato.

II.
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further 
Characterize the Risks
Important risks of SPRAVATO, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about SPRAVATO’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;
The  medicine’s  legal  status  — the  way  a  medicine  is  supplied  to  the  patient  (eg,  with  or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
102
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In the case of SPRAVATO, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analyzed,  including  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (PSUR)  assessment,  so  that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of SPRAVATO is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of SPRAVATO are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof  of a link with the use of SPRAVATO. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is  currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine);

activities
Evidence from an esketamine abuse potential trial (Trial 54135419TRD1015) 
suggests that the potential for abuse is similar to that of ketamine, a known drug 
of abuse recreationally. No evidence of drug-seeking  behavior was observed, 
and  no  confirmed  cases  of  diversion  were  reported  in  clinical  trials  of 
esketamine nasal spray.
Risk  factors  and  groups  for  substance  abuse  include  mental  health  disorders 
(eg, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder), stressful environmental factors, 
taking  addictive  prescription  medication,  alcohol  consumption,  and  family 
history of drug abuse and addiction.
Dependence  and  attenuation  to  SPRAVATO  may  develop,  particularly  when 
not used as prescribed (eg, taking high doses on a daily basis over an extended 
period of time) or in individuals with a history of drug abuse or dependence.

Risk  factors  and  risk 
groups
Risk  factors  for  transient  dissociative  states  and  perception  disorders are 
unknown.
There  is  a  dose-response  relationship  between  the  esketamine  dose  and  the 
severity of transient dissociative states/perception disorders, which is attenuated 
with repeated doses.

the medicine
Cardiovascular  effects  due  to  increased  blood  pressure  are  expected  for 
SPRAVATO based  on  esketamine’s  mechanism  of  action  (sympathomimetic 
effect; direct stimulation of the CNS that leads to increased sympathetic nervous 
system outflow). Transient increases in blood pressure, as well as cardiovascular 
and blood pressure-related events, in association with esketamine nasal spray have 
been  reported  in  the  completed  randomized,  double-blind,  controlled  and  open-
label clinical trials. In clinical trials, elevations of blood pressure were transient, 
generally self-limiting, and did not require intervention.
106
Important Identified Risk: Blood pressure increased
Risk  factors  and 
risk groups
The risk of cardiovascular effects is greater in patients for whom an increase in 
blood pressure poses a serious risk, for example: 



Patients  who  recently  experienced  a cardiovascular  event,  including 
myocardial infarction;
Patients  with  aneurysmal  vascular  disease  (including  intracranial,  thoracic
aorta, abdominal aorta, or peripheral arterial vessels);
Patients with history of intracerebral hemorrhage.

Important Potential Risk: Cognitive disorders and memory impairment (long-term use)
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization 
measures
Long-term cognitive disorders and memory impairment have been reported 
with long-term ketamine use or drug abuse. These effects did not increase over 
time and were reversible after ketamine discontinuation. The effect of 
esketamine nasal spray on cognitive functioning was evaluated in long-term 
clinical trials, and results generally showed that performance on cognitive tests 
was slightly improved or remained stable.
Patients at risk for cognitive disorders and memory impairment are those who 
use SPRAVATO for an extended period. A study that evaluated the long-term 
cognitive consequences of ketamine use found that frequent ketamine users 
(>4 times per week) were impaired on cognitive testing after long-term use 
(12 months) while infrequent ketamine users (<4 times a week, but at least once 
a month) and ex-users did not show any long-term cognitive impairment.

Important Potential Risk: Interstitial cystitis (long-term use)
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Cystitis and lower urinary tract symptoms have been reported with ketamine in 
long-term street users or with higher doses (>10-fold therapeutic use). In a 
comprehensive literature review, the reported chronic physical effects of high-dose, 
near-daily, long-term ketamine use included ulcerative interstitial cystitis. Cases 
reported in the literature have linked ketamine abuse to cystitis. Similar effects may 
potentially occur following esketamine abuse. In clinical trials with esketamine 
nasal spray, there was a higher rate of lower urinary tract symptoms (pollakiuria, 
dysuria, micturition urgency, nocturia, and cystitis) in esketamine-treated patients 
than in patients who received placebo. No cases of esketamine nasal spray-related 
interstitial cystitis have been observed in clinical trials, which involved treatment 
for up to a year.
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Patients at risk for cystitis include those who use SPRAVATO for a long period or 
at higher doses than prescribed.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The prevalence of diabetes across adults from 20 to 79 years in 2015 was estimated to be 8.8%, which 
represents 415 million people. In Europe, the prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be about 9.1%, 
and in North America (including the Caribbean), about 12.9%. Long acting insulin analogues are 
efficacious and offer glycemic control over 24 hours. Mylan’s investigational drug product MYL 1501D was 
being developed as a proposed biosimilar product to Lantus licensed in the European Union (EU), 
hereafter referred to as Lantus-EU, and Lantus licensed in the United States, hereafter referred to as 
Lantus-US. In early studies, Lantus licensed in India (referred to Lantus-IN) was used as the reference 
product. The proposed indication is the same as that approved for Lantus, i.e., for the treatment of 
diabetes mellitus in adults and children over 2 years of age. Data submitted with the dossier contain 
analytical, non-clinical and clinical data aiming at establishing biosimilarity between MYL-1501D and 
EU-approved and US-licensed Lantus in terms of purity, safety, immunogenicity and efficacy and, hence, 
to demonstrate that there is no clinically meaningful difference between MYL-1501 D and Lantus. 
About the product 
Note: beside of the current product name Semglee, the previous names MYL-1501D, FFP-112, Mylan’s 
Insulin Glargine, MIG and MYL IG is being used throughout this document. 
Semglee has been developed to be a biosimilar product to Lantus. Semglee has the same amino acid 
sequence as Lantus and, in contrast to Lantus which is produced in E. coli, is produced in Pichia pastoris 
(ayeast). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application is being made on the basis of Article 10(4) of EC Directive 2001/83/EC as biological 
medicinal product which is similar to a reference biological product. Comparability is being claimed with 
Lantus 100 units/mL (insulin glargine; 100 U/mL solution for injection in a cartridge) solution for injection

- Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing 
recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1), 2015. 
Annex to guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology derived proteins as 
active substance: Non-clinical and clinical issues, (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005), 2006, and revision 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1), 2015. 
The programme was also designed to comply with Scientific Advice from the EMA provided previously. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Semglee (insulin glargine), also referred to as MYL-1501D, has been developed to be a biosimilar product 
to Lantus (reference medicinal product).  
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection in a pre-filled pen (PFP) containing 100 
units/mL of insulin glargine equivalent to 3.64 mg/mL. The excipients are: metacresol, glycerol, Zinc 
chloride, Hydrochloric acid/Sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment and water for injections (WfI). The 
quantitative and qualitative composition of Semglee is the same as the formulation of the reference 
product Lantus presented in cartridge/pre-filled pens.  
The product is available in Type I colourless glass cartridge with a plunger (bromobutyl rubber), sealed 
using lined seals (laminate of polyisoprene and bromobutyl rubber). The cartridge is assembled in a 
disposable pen injector. Each pre-filled pen contains 3 ml of solution and comes in packs of 1, 3, 5 pens. 
The disposable pen injector with integrated 3 mL glass cartridges is intended for subcutaneous 
administration of the product. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance, recombinant insulin glargine, is a structurally modified insulin analogue. Semglee 
has the same amino acid sequence as Lantus and, in contrast to Lantus which is produced in E. coli, is 
Assessment report  
EMA/119474/2018  
Page 10/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
produced in Pichia pastoris (a yeast). The C-terminal end of the B-chain is elongated by two arginine 
residues and the C-terminal asparagine of the A-chain is replaced by glycine.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Origin, source and history of cell line development 
The active substance is expressed as a recombinant precursor protein in the host Pichia pastoris (a 
yeast). 
A two tiered cell bank system, comprising master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) was 
established. Adequate release specifications and characterisation data of MCB and WCB were provided; a 
protocol for future establishment of new WCBs was provided as well. 
End-of-production and post-production cell banks (the latter with additional cell generations after end of 
production) were established and their testing provided evidence of genetic stability during the entire 
production time. All raw materials are controlled by adequate specifications.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The illustration and description of the manufacturing process presented is complete and very detailed. It 
includes the manufacture in a production fermenter by a fed-batch process, followed by purification of the 
precursor protein from the harvest culture supernatant. The final MYL-1501D is purified through an 
enzymatic cleavage step in combination with a series of filtration and chromatography steps.  
The process is designed to remove impurities including the process-related Pichia-specific glycosylated 
variants. Excipients are added to generate the formulated active substance. 
Appropriate hold times have been established for process intermediates and for several processing 
solutions. 
The active substance manufacturing process has been extensively and adequately described.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The process has been developed based on prior knowledge from development gained from other insulin 
products. For critical process parameters normal operating ranges (NORs) have been defined. Based on 
process characterisation studies proven acceptable ranges (PARs) were also defined. Respective study 
reports were provided to support the PARs. Based on the study reports provided, the classification of 
process controls according to criticality is considered acceptable. 
Process validation 
A process validation study has been conducted with batches manufactured at commercial scale according 
to the NORs that have been defined. Process characterisation studies were also performed. They included 
a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) evaluation, subsequent studies of selected parameters for 
their impact on process performance and critical quality attributes and presentation of PARs derived 
thereof in addition to the NORs. The process characterisation studies provided evidence for 
representativeness of small scale studies for the commercial scale and justification for the PARs derived 
thereof.  
Assessment report  
EMA/119474/2018  
Page 11/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Clearance of process- and product-related impurities has only been presented based on real time results 
of the process verification batches. While for the enzyme used to cleave the precursor protein adequate 
removal could be demonstrated by data, removal capacities for host DNA and host cell protein (HCP) 
cannot be derived due to the low levels found. However, testing for both residuals is included in the active 
substance specification and this is considered to be acceptable. 
Hold time studies were performed for all intermediates intended to be held for a certain processing time 
and the hold times are considered supported. 
Tabulated results of lifetime studies for chromatography resins have been provided on a concurrent basis 
at commercial scale. Additional data has been provided to define sufficient column performance.  
Manufacturing process development 
Process development was initially driven by prior knowledge from manufacture of other insulin products. 
Further process development aimed at the improvement of operability, productivity, quality, scale-up, 
and adapting the process to different facilities. Several active substance manufacturing processes have 
been utilised throughout the development.  
Process comparison and comparative in-process data were provided to support similarity of different 
processes. In addition, a detailed product comparability study was provided to also support comparability 
of the resulting active substances from different processes. With a view to the biosimilarity claim the 
intended commercial process was developed aiming to reduce glycosylated product-related variants not 
contained in the reference product by improving the clearance capability of downstream chromatography 
steps for these impurities. Moreover, the scale was further increased and manufacture was transferred 
were a sufficient number of product consistency runs and process verification runs were manufactured. 
The comparability of active substances is considered supported by the data provided. Development of the 
process is overall described with sufficient detail.   
Characterisation 
Characterisation studies have been performed using representative MYL-1501D active substance (AS) 
and finished product (FP) batches. The AS batches have been manufactured using the intended 
commercial active substance manufacturing process.  
The primary, secondary and tertiary structures have been found comparable to the profiles of EU and US 
Lantus reference. Identical amino acid sequence of both chains, an accurate molecular mass for the intact 
protein as well as for the two chains A and B, a similar distribution of the disulphide bridges as well as 
comparable secondary and tertiary structure profiles could be confirmed for all batches tested. 
Non-reduced peptide mass fingerprint used for evaluation of the correct formation of disulphide bridges 
revealed two additional peaks which have been identified to be undigested insulin glargine structures.  
Several analytical methods have been used for control of MYL-1501D active substance impurity profile 
and are considered adequate for characterization and control of impurities including RP-HPLC and 
SEC-HPLC. The capability and suitability of the proposed analytical methods to resolve and differentiate 
between glycosylated and non-glycosylated impurities/species has been demonstrated.  
Biological activity has been investigated using several in vitro assay methods for evaluating the 
metabolic, mitogenic, insulin receptor binding, IGF-1 receptor binding and insulin receptor 
phosphorylation activity. Additionally, the in vivo assay described in the Pharmacopoeia was carried out 
Assessment report  
EMA/119474/2018  
Page 12/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to demonstrate the biological activity of MYL-1501D. Forced degradation studies revealing significant 
photo degradation as well as degradation under acidic and oxidative conditions have been presented.  
Specification 
Adequate active substance specifications have been provided comprising identity testing and impurity 
testing.  
Residual host cell protein determination and host cell DNA determination are performed using adequate 
assays. In addition, contents of zinc, as well as residual solvents are tested at active substance release 
and during stability, as appropriate. Likewise, loss on drying, sulphated ash as well as endotoxins and 
microbial limits are controlled at active substance release and during stability. In general, the proposed 
specification is considered adequate. 
The proposed impurity (“Related Compounds”) specification including both limits for glycosylated 
impurities and for other impurities is considered acceptable. The specification contains a limit for 
glycosylated variants to guarantee very low levels of these variants in future batches.  
The general approach to justify the proposed specifications taking into consideration process batch data 
as well as stability data is considered adequate. Based on this, the proposed acceptance limits for the 
specified parameters seem reasonably deduced. 
Analytical methods 
Most of the analytical procedures applied for control of the active substance are in-house methods for 
which acceptable descriptions have been provided. In light of the current Ph. Eur. Monograph “Insulin 
glargine” the company’s in-house analytical methods are justified as being more suitable and 
discriminating than the pharmacopoeial ones. This is considered acceptable. In addition, a cell-line and 
process-specific ELISA is proposed for determination of Pichia pastoris host cell proteins (HCP). The new 
test has been demonstrated to be suitable for the intended purpose. Sufficient details have been provided 
with regard to the validation of the proposed analytical procedures included in the AS specification. The 
proposed in-house analytical procedures were demonstrated to meet the pre-defined validation 
requirements.  
Batch analysis 
Batch data have been provided for active substance batches used in the pre-clinical and clinical 
development, process validation and stability batches. All batches comply with the specifications in place.  
Reference standard  
Sufficient details have been provided on the reference standard system established for active substance 
manufacture. Working reference standards are used. Qualification of the previously and currently used 
standards is considered adequate. An appropriate qualification protocol for future reference standards 
has been provided. 
Container Closure 
Sufficient detail on the container used for storage of the AS has been provided.

Stability 
Stability data have been provided for commercial active substance batches stored for up to 6 months at 
the proposed long-term storage condition and for up to 6 months at accelerated conditions. In addition, 
long-term stability data are available from supporting batches stored up to 48 months.  
All the batch data comply with the pre-determined active substance specifications. Based on the data, the 
claimed active substance shelf life is supported. The proposed stability protocol containing adequate 
stability-indicating test parameters is considered appropriate.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
MYL-1501D finished product (Semglee) is a clear, colourless liquid supplied in a pre-filled pen (PFP) 
intended for subcutaneous administration. The disposable pen injector with integrated 3 mL glass 
cartridges is sealed with a polyisoprene/bromobutyl seal and closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper. 
The cartridges are filled with a nominal volume of 3.0 mL. It contains 100 units/mL of insulin glargine 
equivalent to 3.64 mg/mL. Apart from insulin glargine as the active substance, Semglee contains the 
preservative metacresol; glycerol as a tonicity agent; Zinc chloride as stabiliser and Hydrochloric 
acid/Sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment in water for injections (WfI) (adjusted to target pH). The 
quantitative and qualitative composition of Semglee is the same as the formulation of the reference 
product Lantus presented in cartridge/pre-filled pens.  
Pharmaceutical development  
Semglee formulation was developed in several stages and characterisation studies were conducted with 
the formulation selected for commercial manufacture were used to further support the finished product 
composition and to study the tolerance ranges in the concentrations of the excipients in terms of the 
finished product stability. For these studies an appropriate design of experiments (DoE) concept was 
applied. Based on the results, the qualitative and quantitative composition of Semglee is regarded 
adequate with regard to product quality and stability.  
The manufacturing process of Semglee has been appropriately developed. Process development studies 
were conducted at the laboratory scale to study the impact of critical parameters on product stability. 
Process characterization studies were used to identify critical process parameters and to evaluate 
acceptable input parameter ranges and normal operating ranges of variables to be used during routine 
manufacturing operations and are confirmed to be adequate to ensure consistent product quality. In the 
course of the manufacturing process development the finished product production was transferred to the 
final commercial manufacturing site. The transfer involved an increase in the FP batch size and changes 
in the equipment. Analytical comparability between the finished product of these two production sites was 
appropriately evaluated and confirmed. Semglee finished product batches manufactured at the 
commercial manufacturing site by using active substance of the commercial AS process showed a lower 
level of impurities/product-related substances when compared with finished product manufactured 
during development.

Compatibility of the container closure system with MYL-1501D FP was sufficiently evaluated by 
extractable and leachable (E&L) studies. Potential leachables and extractables of the primary container 
closure components have been evaluated in extensive studies. 
In conclusion, the compatibility of the selected primary packaging components with Semglee formulation 
has been appropriately demonstrated.  Container closure integrity is routinely controlled at finished 
product batch release and during stability studies.  
Antimicrobial efficacy of the preservative was tested at the end of in-use stability studies.  The efficacy of 
the preservative was also demonstrated at its lower acceptance limit of 80% of the label claim.  
Medical Device 
The manufacturers of the pen components and subassemblies are EN ISO 13485:2012 certified and 
comply with requirements for design, development and manufacture of “Disposable Pen Injectors”. 
Evidence has been provided that Semglee disposable pen injector fulfils the essential requirements of the 
EU Medical Device Directive.  
Specifications for the pen body sub-assembly have been presented. The final commercial pen 
configuration was verified in view of accuracy and robustness apart from other aspects by considering the 
relevant ISO standards on pen injector systems. A selection of commercially available needles was 
applied in these studies and confirmed to comply with the requirements. The needle sizes compatible with 
the Semglee pen injector are indicated in the Instructions for Use.  
Human Factor Validation and clinical evaluation studies were conducted in order to confirm that Semglee 
pen injector and the Instructions for Use are appropriate for use by the intended user population.

(PFP) 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The cartridge manufacturing process has been sufficiently described. The batch formula of a commercial 
batch has been adequately presented.  
The process starts by mixing the active substance with the first set of excipients. Subsequently the 
remaining excipients are added. The pH is adjusted to target and the volume is made up to 100%. The 
bulk solution is filtered into a sterile vessel. Final sterile filtration is carried out on-line and the filtered 
solution is filled into the sterile cartridges and closed. The primary packaging components are sterilized at 
the finished product manufacturing site prior to use.

Process parameters applied for operating the manufacture of MYL-1501D FP cartridges are indicated. 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) have been described. The target set points and ranges of the CPPs are 
within the ranges evaluated during process development.  
The manufacturing process is controlled by appropriate in-process controls (IPC). Process verification was 
achieved by manufacturing several consecutive full-scale cartridge validation batches at the commercial 
manufacturing site. The testing programme, the sampling plan and the number of samples taken were 
acceptable. During the validation runs all process parameters were kept within their acceptable ranges or 
met the target value. Process validation was completed by testing several batches according to the 
release specification. All parameters tested met their acceptance criteria. No trend was observed even 
when multiple samples had been taken and analysed. The results confirm that the cartridge 
manufacturing process at the commercial manufacturing site consistently produces Semglee cartridges of 
the intended quality.  
Results of the filter validation studies involved the evaluation of filter compatibility and bacterial retaining 
capacity in the presence of the finished product as well as extractables and leachables from the filter 
materials.  
The pen assembly process has also been depicted and described. Checks after each step of the assembly 
process assure the correct assembly of the disposable pen. For the purpose of pen assembly process 
validation, a sufficient number of consecutive pen injector batches were manufactured at the commercial 
site. In addition, supportive validation data from a sufficient number of consecutive pen injector batches 
have been presented which are assessed supportive since they were manufactured by an assembly 
process demonstrated to be comparable. All results met the acceptance criteria. Although the size of the 
validation batches was significantly lower than the intended commercial batch scale the total data 
presented are considered sufficient to give assurance on the consistency of the assembly process. 
Adequate evidence that the assembly process does not impact the physicochemical and microbiological 
quality of the finished product was also provided. 
Product specification 
The list of test parameters for the finished product specifications contains tests on identity, Zn content, 
impurities, assay, pharmaceutical characteristics and cartridge function and dimension. The analytical 
methods are correctly assigned to the test parameters. Furthermore, shelf-life specifications are 
proposed for stability indicating parameters.   
Specific compounds were detected in the finished product formulation not detectable in the active 
substance. These substances were adequately identified and characterized. The level of these compounds 
in finished product batches was found to be low. For all other impurities, a comparison between the 
amounts found in Semglee solution and the corresponding active substance batches demonstrated that 
there is no considerable increase during the finished product manufacturing process. 
A risk assessment of the elemental impurities in MYL-1501D finished product in accordance with ICH Q3D 
has been presented. Analysis of Semglee finished product confirmed that none of the potential elements 
is above its limit of quantification in the finished product solution.  
The specified acceptance range for Zn amount, insulin glargine content, the pharmaceutical attributes as 
well as the performance and functional properties of the pen have been adequately justified and are 
accepted. The approach for the justification of the specification limits of the impurities is acceptable.  In 
addition, the proposed pen specification is considered adequate.

Analytical methods 
The analytical methods have been described in sufficient detail. The non-compendial methods used for 
routine control were adequately validated.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data have been presented for a sufficient number of batches manufactured at the 
commercial manufacturing site using active substance of the intended active substance manufacturing 
process. All parameters complied with their acceptance criteria. The release results of the assembled pen 
confirmed conformance with the pen release specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies on Semglee have been conducted in accordance to ICH requirements. A sufficient 
number of finished product batches have been included. Stability data up to 36 months were submitted 
for supporting batches. Up to 6 month’s data has been provided for commercial scale FP. The stability 
testing programme followed the established specification. All test parameters tested complied with their 
acceptance criteria when Semglee cartridges were stored at the recommended storage condition up to 36 
months.  
In-use stability of cartridges was tested after assembly with the pen. All test results were within the 
acceptance criteria and confirmed adequate physicochemical and microbiological quality after 28 days of 
storage at 30°C.  
Forced degradation studies at different stress conditions (temperature, light exposure, oxidation, pH and 
mechanical stress) revealed that the degradation rate is very similar between the FP samples deriving 
from different AS processes as well as in US and EU Lantus batches. Thus, it is considered justified to 
establish FP shelf life on the stability data of the previous FP batches. The claimed shelf life for the finished 
product of 24 months at the recommended storage temperature (2°C-8°C) is acceptable. After first use 
of the pen and based on the in-use stability results the product may be stored for a maximum of 4 weeks 
not above 30°C. Pens in use must not be stored in the refrigerator. 
Biosimilarity 
An extensive biosimilarity exercise was conducted to demonstrate analytical similarity of the test product 
MYL1501D with the reference product Lantus approved in the EU. In addition, analytical bridging was 
performed to compare the proposed biosimilar MYL1501D with EU and US Lantus. 
Multiple MYL1501D FP batches containing active substance manufactured by an earlier manufacturing 
process as well as a sufficient number of finished product batches containing active substance 
manufactured by the intended commercialization process have been included in the similarity 
assessment. Furthermore, a sufficient number of EU and US Lantus batches were used as reference 
product.  
In general, the choice of the test and reference product batches seems appropriate with regard to the 
number of batches, representativeness and differences in age. Analytical similarity study was performed 
by both, “side-by-side testing” as well as “stand-alone analyses”. It has been clarified that the same 
analytical methods were used in case of “stand-alone” analyses although the tests were performed at 
different time points.

For the similarity study, quality attributes of insulin glargine were identified that may have impact on 
safety and efficacy. The quality attributes have been ranked and categorized for their criticality by 
applying risk assessment principles and tools in accordance with ICH Q8 and ICH Q9. Product variants 
such as size-, sequence-, pI- and deamidation- variants, product attributes comprising protein content, 
amino acid sequence, higher order structure and zinc content and functional attributes determined as 
metabolic and mitogenic activity have been evaluated for analytical similarity between the test and 
reference product.  
Biological activity in terms of in vitro metabolic and in vitro mitogenic activity as well as in vivo (USP rabbit 
bioassay) was also investigated. Comparable biological activity against the insulin receptor (both IR-B 
and IR-A) and the insulin growth factor with regard of binding and auto-phosphorylation activity could be 
demonstrated for the MYL1501D test product, EU Lantus and US Lantus. Likewise, glucose uptake 
activity, cell proliferation and rabbit bioassay potency was found similar between the test and the 
reference product and the comparator.  
Structural comparability between the MYL1501D test product and the EU Lantus reference product and 
the comparator US Lantus was studied by applying numerous state-of-the-art methods demonstrating 
similarity in terms of primary (i.e., amino acid sequence), secondary, tertiary structure and molecular 
mass.  
Purity and impurity of MYL1501D test product, EU Lantus and US Lantus has been assessed both with 
regard to HMWP content and product variants (by RP-HPLC).   
Determination of HMW proteins using SEC-HPLC as well as orthogonal analytical methods (SEC-MALS and 
AUC) substantiated that HMW proteins of the test product are consistently below the values found for the 
reference product EU Lantus and the comparator US Lantus. 
Comparison of product variants/impurities between test and reference product is considered acceptable. 
Presence of product variants/impurities in the reference product have been appropriately addressed and 
compared between test and reference product.  
Deamidation/clipped species were present in comparable amounts in both, the test and the EU reference 
product. Product related impurities such as conjugates are lower in MYL1501D test product than in EU 
Lantus and US Lantus.   
Regarding the analytical similarity with respect to zinc content, the applicant has appropriately justified 
and demonstrated the analytical similarity with Lantus EU. 
A straight-forward statistical approach was used to assess the analytical similarity.  
With respect to glycosylated impurities, the active substance manufacturing process has been 
substantially improved to reduce glycosylated species. Furthermore, acceptable measures have been 
implemented to control the residual low levels of glycosylated impurities at active substance release. 
Consequently, similarity between the proposed test and reference products can be supported and the 
claim of analytical similarity between the MYL1501D test product and the EU Lantus reference product as 
well as bridging between EU Lantus and US Lantus is considered adequate. 
The outcome of the physicochemical and biological comparability exercise between MYL-1501D and 
Lantus is summarised in the table below.

Furthermore, unlike mammalian cell lines, yeast cell culture is not susceptible to transmit viral 
adventitious agents. Hence the risk of contamination with adventitious agents is very low. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Development, characterisation, manufacture and control of insulin glargine active substance and 
MYL-1501D finished product (Semglee) have been adequately described. EU GMP certificates have been 
issued for the active substance and finished product cartridge manufacturing sites as well as for the 
Semglee pre-filled pen assembly site.  
The proposed active substance specification includes the requested limits for glycosylated variants. 
Semglee finished product has an identical composition as the reference product Lantus. Appropriate 
studies were conducted to further support the quantitative composition of the finished product and the 
selected finished product manufacturing process. The commercial manufacture of Semglee cartridge has 
been sufficiently described, controlled and verified to ensure a consistent production of the intended 
quality of Semglee cartridges. The proposed control of impurities/product-related substances in Semglee 
finished product at release and during the stability studies is acceptable. Finished product stability studies 
were adequately performed and the results support the shelf life claimed for Semglee.  
Semglee pen injector was confirmed to deliver Semglee product accurately and safely. It was further 
demonstrated that the commercial assembly process consistently manufactures Semglee pre-filled pen of 
intended quality and performance. The assembly process does not compromise cartridge integrity and 
hence does not impact Semglee finished product quality.  
For insulin glargine (Semglee) an extensive analytical similarity study has been conducted to compare 
insulin glargine manufactured in Pichia pastoris with Lantus reference product manufactured in E.coli. The 
active substance manufacturing process is capable to reduce glycosylated species and since acceptable 
measures of control have been implemented to control the remaining low levels of glycosylated impurities 
the similarity claim between the proposed test and reference products is justified. The claim of analytical 
similarity between the MYL1501D test product and the reference product Lantus approved in the EU as 
well as bridging between EU Lantus and US Lantus is supported. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Biosimilarity to the 
reference product Lantus has been satisfactorily demonstrated at the quality level. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended additional points for investigation.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
The applicant has covered all levels of comparison as required by the CHMP biosimilar insulin guideline, 
i.e. receptor binding, receptor activation (measured as autophosphorylation) and metabolic effects 
(glucose uptake, adipogenesis and inhibition of lipolysis). As requested by the guideline, these tests were 
performed in vitro since thereby a higher accuracy can be achieved than in vivo. Nevertheless, in-vivo 
studies were also presented. Furthermore, the applicant studied off-target binding to the IFG-1 receptor 
(IGF1R) and consecutive mitogenesis. The pharmacological studies performed are listed in the table 
below.  
The evaluation of the study results is not fully in line with the European biosimilarity guideline. The 
applicant did not compare Glargine Mylan and the reference product Lantus directly, i.e. head-to-head in 
one experiment. Instead, each batch of Glargine Mylan and Lantus tested was compared to an internal 
working standard, and potency was calculated relative to this standard using a parallel line analysis. All 
comparisons were done at the level of relative potency values. On request the applicant provided all raw 
data, presented as concentration-response relationship curves so that plausibility of the calculated 
potency values could be assessed. The complete concentration-relationship curves provided much more 
information than the single potency value; the shape, steepness and upper limit of the curve are not 
reflected in the potency value. In most cases the individual data points fitted well to the expected sigmoid 
curve shape, indicating that a suitable concentration range was selected and that the results are reliable.

In vitro studies 
The results of the in-vitro studies were presented as concentration-response relationships which allow 
assessment of the biological plausibility of the results. In most cases data of test and reference product 
were  compared  art  the  level  of  relative  potency.  Concentration-response  data  were  analysed  using 
Parallel Line Analysis (PLA) software. The relative potency was obtained by calculating the linear portion 
of the dose response curve and comparing the ratio between the adjacent doses and the common slopes 
of any test agent (Lantus-EU, Lantus-US or MYL-1501D) to that of the internal working standard. In the 
respective figures below, the data corresponding to this standard are labelled in black. 
Binding to IR-B including binding kinetics 
Study U-15309 
A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based assay was used to evaluate the binding of insulin glargine to 
purified recombinant insulin receptors (IR-A and IR-B) in a Biacore instrument platform. The truncated, 
His-tagged receptor protein was immobilized on the surface of the CM5 sensor chip and the analyte (i.e. 
insulin glargine) was passed across the surface. Receptor protein (IR-A or IR-B) was coupled to the CM-5 
binding surface by first washing the cells with EDC/NHS followed by a 6 μg/mL injection of the protein. 
The receptor protein was immobilized on the CM5 chip in 10 mM acetate buffer to a baseline of 1500 RU. 
The concentrations of glargine used ranged from 3.125 to 100 nM.  
In generating the SPR data curves, Mylan’s analysis method set curve fitting parameters were to a single 
model demonstrating reasonable fit and kinetic values with no adjustment or alteration of the curve fit 
between experiment/analyte/batch. The selected Langmuir model assumes 1:1 binding, first order 
kinetics, and equivalent but independent binding sites. 
For determination of the association and dissociation rate (ka and kd) the measured curves (unsmooth 
colour lines in the figure below) were fitted to the above-mentioned function, and the black lines 
represent the fitted function. However, the fitted functions do not match the data curves very well. This 
may indicate that the binding and dissociation reactions did not follow the simple assumptions which were 
made by the applicant. On the other hand, a more complex model would likely introduce additional 
variability and/or bias to the data so that the applicant's approach is considered appropriate. 
The figure below shows representative sensorgrams for the different glargine concentrations used, one 
sensorgram for comparator EU-Lantus (left) and one for the biosimilar product Glargine Mylan 
(MYL1501D, right).

It  is  likely  that  the  calculated  KD  values  are  too  small  (i.e.  affinity  of  glargine  to  the  receptor  is 
overestimated) because association appears more slowly and dissociation faster with the raw data than 
with the fitted curve. However, the figure also shows that the deviation of the fit from the raw data is 
qualitatively and quantitatively similar in all three glargine preparations tested. Thus, this is no concern in 
respect to biosimilarity of the products. The shape of the curves meets the expectations, indicating that 
the results are plausible. No relevant differences between the three test products become obvious.

sensorgram for comparator EU-Lantus (left) and one for the biosimilar product Glargine Mylan 
(MYL1501D, right). The shape of the curves meets the expectations, indicating that the results are 
plausible. No relevant differences between Lantus and MYL1501D become obvious.

Autophosphorylation of IR-B 
CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells expressing IR-B were incubated with the test substances and lysed 
thereafter with the lysis buffer of the Alphascreen detection kit. The AlphaScreen Surefire technology was 
used for the detection of phosphorylated Insulin receptor in cellular lysate. Two antibodies recognize the 
phospho-Tyr 1150/1151 epitope and a distal epitope on Insulin receptor, respectively, and form a 
sandwich antibody complex. This complex is captured by AlphaScreen donor and acceptor beads, bringing 
them into close proximity. The excitation of the donor bead triggers emission of light at 520-620nm.  
The figures below show a representative concentration-response curve of IR-B autophosphorylation for 
EU-Lantus (left) and Glargine Mylan (right). The data points do not show large variability and can easily 
be fitted to a sigmoid curve, indicating plausibility of the results.

Glucose uptake (long-term) 
The method of determining glucose uptake used by the applicant is unusual. It measures the decrease of 
glucose concentration in the cell culture medium, assuming that glucose concentration decreases because 
the cells have consumed the glucose. Although this assumption is of course true, glucose consumption 
depends on many parameters and is not directly related to IR-mediated glucose uptake. In particular, 
measuring decreasing glucose in the medium requires rather long incubation of the cells with the test 
substances (22 h here) in order to achieve measurable differences. Insulin action over this time not only 
affects glucose uptake via GLUT4 but can also influence gene expression, cell proliferation or carbon 
hydrate and lipid metabolism in general. Hence, the response is very complex. In particular, an increased 
cellular glucose demand because of e.g. proliferation could result in insulin-independent glucose uptake. 
Thus, this assay would measure any ill-defined net insulin effect but not specifically glucose uptake via the 
insulin-sensitive transporter GLUT4 as desired. Therefore, glucose uptake is usually measured over short 
periods only (e.g. 15 min), and not glucose itself but a derivate that is recognised by GLUT4 and cannot 
be metabolised (2-deoxglucose) is used. 
The relative potencies in respect to insulin-dependent glucose consumption as described above of 
MYL-1501D, Lantus-EU, and Lantus-US were highly similar (values ranged from 0.90 to 1.06, 0.83 to 
1.12, and 0.94 to 1.12 respectively). 
The response towards glargine was compared to the effect of another growth factor, VEGF (vascular 
endothelial growth factor). The latter had essentially no effect as desired.

Adipogenesis 
Insulin is an adipogenic hormone that triggers the differentiation of pre-adipocytes into mature 
adipocytes in a process known as adipogenesis. The initial step of this protocol was the culture of 3T3-L1 
cells to 60-70% confluence. Differentiation was initiated by switching the cells to differentiation medium 
containing IBMX and ascending concentrations of insulin glargine, ranging from 0.79 to 12000 ng/mL. 
The cells were then incubated for six days. Thereafter, lipids were extracted and quantified by a 
fluorescence assay. The relative potency vs standard was calculated using SoftMax Pro 5.4.1 software. 
The figures below show a representative concentration-response curve of adipogenesis for EU-Lantus 
(left) and Glargine Mylan (right). The data points do not show large variability and can easily be fitted to

more complex cellular functions than binding and phosphorylation assays do. Therefore, a higher degree 
of variability is expected is not of concern.

Inhibition of lipolysis 
In an in vitro setting with 3T3-L1 cells, insulin inhibits adipolysis/lipolysis in a dose dependent manner. 
Lipolysis was measured by quantification of the free fatty acid released from the cells. The 3T3-L1 cells 
were differentiated by adding IBMX, dexamethasone, insulin and rosiglitazone to the culture medium. 
Lipolysis was stimulated with 3 nM of isoproterenol for 2 hours in the presence of ascending 
concentrations of insulin glargine (Lantus EU, Lantus US or Glargine Mylan). Supernatant was collected 
and a photometric free fatty acid assay was performed and evaluated by measuring absorbance at 
570nm.

IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) binding 
The experimental procedures were the same as described above for IR-B binding and kinetics (Study 
U-15309) except for the temperature during binding and dissociation. For IGF1R it was 25°C whereas the 
tests with IR-A and IR-B were performed at 10°C. Hence, binding and dissociation was faster with IGF1R.  
The figure below shows the Biacore readout for two exemplary experiments, one for EU-Lantus and the

Mitogenesis 
To compare the mitogenic potency of MYL-1501D with that of Lantus-EU and Lantus-US, Saos-2 human 
osteosarcoma cells were exposed to different batches and concentrations of the test articles, and 
proliferation was measured colourimetrically using the redox indicator dye Alamar Blue. Mitogenic 
potency was expressed relative to the working standard. 
The response towards glargine was compared to the effect of another growth factor, VEGF (vascular 
endothelial growth factor). VEGF had no effect as desired. 
The figures below show a representative concentration-response curve of mitogenesis for EU-Lantus

In vivo studies 
Two studies in mice were performed, one with SC and one with IV insulin injection. The results of these 
studies show that Glargine Mylan and Lantus dose-dependently decreased blood glucose. The effect size 
was similar, but, as expected, the variability was large. Hence, in-vivo PD studies are not requested as 
part of the biosimilarity exercise. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No dedicated nonclinical pharmacokinetic studies were conducted for MYL-1501D. Toxicokinetic 
measurements were made in the repeat-dose toxicity studies (see respective section below).

Formulations A and C slightly differ from the formulation intended for marketing. Formulations C and the 
formulation intended for marketing are quantitatively identical in composition. They differ only in the 
concentration of the glycerol stock solution used for the preparation. Formulation A contains additional 
polysorbate-20. These differences are not considered toxicologically relevant. 
In the single-dose studies, an expected dose-dependent decrease in blood glucose was observed. A 
comparator was not tested. No unexpected toxicity became obvious what is reassuring. However, a drug 
formulation was used (Formulation A) which is not intended for marketing. Furthermore, it is not clear 
whether the drug substance material used in these older studies is representative for the material 
intended for commercialisation. 
Repeated-dose studies: 
Study G11066: Comparative 28-Day Toxicity Study of MYL-1501D, Lantus-US and Lantus-EU 
Administered by Subcutaneous Route to Wistar Rats 
Two mortalities occurred, 1 female in the MYL-1501D high-dose recovery group and 1 female in the 
Lantus-US high-dose group. No mortalities were observed in female rats in the Lantus-EU high-dose 
group. 
Clinical signs of mild injury and scab formation at the injection site were observed in the in a few animals 
(some were in the placebo control group), mostly in Weeks 2 through 3. These clinical signs at the 
injection site were correlated with observations of reddish discoloration in gross pathology and 
haemorrhage, inflammation, and fibrosis in histopathology. Because no dose-dependent relationship was 
observed, the findings were attributed to the low pH of the formulation and to the injection procedure, 
rather than to the test or reference items per se. The signs generally appeared to have reversed by week 
4 of the treatment period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/119474/2018  
Page 33/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Functional observational tests were conducted in the control groups and the high-dose groups during 
week 4 of the treatment period. No abnormalities attributable to treatment were found. 
Food intake and body weight were comparable among groups; some isolated changes in food intake were 
observed in some groups at certain time points but there was no general trend. 
Expected treatment-related reductions in plasma glucose concentration (measured at study days 1 and 
28) were observed, and they were approximately proportional to dose.  
Toxicokinetics revealed high variability in Cmax and AUC. The indicated SD values are high for Cmax. In 
general, females had higher Cmax and exposure (AUC) than males. The AUC and Cmax values differed 
markedly between the three preparations tested without a consistent trend. E.g., the Mylan product had 
a lower AUC and Cmax than the two Lantus preparations in males whereas in females US-Lantus had the 
lowest AUC and Cmax. 
Study G4668: 90-Day Repeat-Dose Toxicity of MYL-1501D and Lantus-IN in Wistar Rats 
Toxicity and Pharmacodynamic Effect: The only adverse effects observed were 2 mortalities and clinical 
signs at the 0.38 mg/kg/day (high) dose; both deaths were related to the exaggerated pharmacodynamic 
effect of insulin glargine. Similar degrees and durations of glucose reduction were observed for all 3 test 
articles. The pharmacodynamic effects were consistent with the findings reported for Lantus. 
Injection Site Effects: The injection site effects observed were generally independent of the dose and 
were considered to be related to the formulation or procedure, rather than insulin glargine itself. Local 
effects at the injection site have been reported for Lantus (EPAR 2012). Hence, the lower concentrations 
most likely did not have any significant impact on the conclusions of the study. 
Immunogenicity: Low and comparable levels of binding antibodies were observed for the 3 test articles, 
independent of dose. Hence, the lower concentrations are not likely to have affected the results. 
Toxicokinetics: The pharmacokinetic profile of MYL-1501D was found to be comparable with Lantus-EU, 
and for generally comparable with Lantus-US.  
Study G4669: 90-day Repeat-dose Toxicity of MYL-1501D in New Zealand White Rabbits 
Toxicity: There were no toxicological observations of concern. A single mortality (female) occurred during 
the course of treatment that was attributed to hypoglycaemia (i.e., exaggerated pharmacology of the test 
article). There were no adverse findings in either gender in any treatment group with respect to body 
weight, food consumption, haematology, clinical chemistry, organ weights, or gross and histopathological 
findings. Histopathological examination of injection sites at the end of the study identified slight local 
irritation in both the vehicle control and high dose groups. Animals dosed with vehicle control developed 
epidermal hyperplasia, parakeratosis, and inflammatory foci at the injection site. One female in the 
high-dose group developed minimal leukocyte infiltration at the injection site. In general, all findings were 
considered incidental and not related to the treatment. 
Toxicokinetics: A dose-related increase in exposure to total insulin was observed on Days 1 and 90. No 
consistent gender difference was observed. MYL-1501D did not accumulate after repeated administration 
for 90 consecutive days. 
In the immunogenicity analysis, no samples were positive for antidrug antibodies, indicating that 
MYL-1501D did not induce antidrug antibodies in rabbits. 
Study U16176: 28d (+14d recovery) study in Wistar rats to compare Glargine Mylan from two different 
manufacturing processes; US-Lantus was another comparator.

There were no overt signs of toxicity in the study beyond the expected effects related to insulin 
pharmacology. Test agents MYL-1501D processes, and Lantus-US displayed similar directionality, 
magnitude, and duration of pharmacologic blood glucose reduction. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Insulin glargine is a recombinant human basal insulin analogue for the treatment of Type 1 (T1DM) and 
Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) mellitus.  
According to the guideline EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 1, proteins are exempted from the 
environmental risk assessment because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant's pharmacology programme was generally in line with the CHMP insulin biosimilar guideline. 
Binding to and activation of (i.e. autophoshorylation) the two insulin receptor (IR) isoforms, IR-A and 
IR-B, were tested as well as three different metabolic effects (glucose uptake, adipogenesis and inhibition 
of lipolysis). Binding and activation tests were also done with the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) together with 
mitogenic action in cell culture. The results of these functional assays provided support for the claim of 
biosimilarity. 
The functional assay of receptor activation, i.e. glucose uptake, was performed in an unusual way. The 
glucose uptake assay is a rather standardised procedure which measures the intracellular accumulation of 
radiolabelled 2-deoxy-glucose. However, the applicant measured consumption of glucose from the cell 
culture medium. Although this is less favourable since glucose consumption can depend on many different 
factors other than direct insulin-induced glucose entrance into the cell, the applicant has provided 
additional justifications during the application review that support the validity of the alternate glucose 
uptake assay format. The results from this assay showed similar glucose consumption. The applicant has 
later during the procedure provided two additional metabolic assays (adipogenesis and inhibition of 
lipolysis in 3T3-L1 cells) which are considered appropriate. Hence, the package of metabolic assays is 
acceptable. 
The Glargine Mylan and the Lantus batches were not compared directly head-to-head in the various 
assays. Instead, each batch was tested separately against a working standard. This was done because the 
number of samples that can be processed per assay setup is limited and because the applicant intended 
to achieve comparability of the results across different experiments. The latter is not required for the 
non-clinical biosimilarity exercise. Rather, a direct head-to-head comparison of test and reference 
product within one experiment is suggested by the European biosimilarity guideline. By normalising the 
data to an internal standard as done by the applicant, information was lost because many data points 
were combined to yield a single relative potency value. However, the applicant submitted all raw data, 
and from these it can be concluded that the behaviour of glargine Mylan and Lantus was indeed similar in 
all assays performed. 
The applicant also submitted in-vivo PD studies. These revealed the expected insulin effect (blood glucose 
lowering), however with a high inter-individual variability. For this reason, in-vivo studies are not required 
because they are considered too insensitive for detecting differences between the biosimilar and the 
reference product. 
According to the current version of the European biosmilar guideline, toxicology studies are not necessary 
for a biosimilar application unless there is cause for concern. In the case of Mylan's insulin glargine, it

should be noted that it is produced in Pichia yeast, whereas the reference product is produced in E. coli, 
leading to low levels of glycosylated species in the test product vs. no glycosylated species in the 
reference product. However, the applicant achieved a reduction of the glycosylated forms to very low 
levels so that the potential toxicological impact of the glycosylated forms in Mylan's glargine is considered 
negligible. The most relevant repeat-dose study in rats (G11066), comparing a recent Mylan formulation 
with EU- and US-Lantus, revealed no toxicological concerns. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical programme for Semglee is in line with CHMP guidelines and, regarding in vivo studies, 
exceeds the requirements. The results provided support a claim of biosimilarity.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The Semglee clinical pharmacology programme consisted of two studies, which were single dose 
crossover euglycaemic clamp studies. In respect to this application study GLARGCT100111 was 
conducted to demonstrate definitive PD and PK similarity between Semglee and Lantus EU in T1DM 
subjects. 
GLARGCT100111 was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, single-dose, 3-way crossover 
euglycemic clamp, active controlled study.  
The size of the batch used in this study is considered sufficiently large. The intended commercial batch 
size is 900 kg.  
Primary objectives: To compare the relative pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of 
Semglee with Lantus (EU and US) in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
Secondary objectives: To assess the single dose safety and local tolerability of Semglee relative to Lantus 
(EU and US). 
The primary PK endpoints were area under the plasma insulin concentration curve from 0 to 30 hours 
(AUCins.0-30h) and maximum insulin concentration (Cins.max). The secondary PK parameters were AUCins.0-6h, 
AUCins.6-30h, AUCins.0-∞, tmax, t½ and terminal elimination rate constant (λz). 
According to study protocol it was planned to determine insulin glargine concentrations and related 
pharmacokinetic parameters from ELISA.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Quantification of the insulin glargine concentration with the ELISA gave implausible results. Furthermore, 
GLP deficiencies in the analytical laboratory were identified. To address the technical difficulties of 
evaluating insulin glargine data with an assay that has different cross-reactivity for insulin glargine and 
human insulin and in response to a recommendation from the FDA, a specific LC MS/MS method to 
measure insulin glargine and its metabolites insulin glargine M1 and insulin glargine M2 in backup patient 
samples from the study was developed. This analysis is considered pivotal. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis of PK data is based on the PK-Full-Analysis-Set. Log-transformed primary endpoints, AUCins.0-30h 
and Cins.max, for all treatments (Semglee, Lantus EU and Lantus US) are analysed using a linear mixed 
effect model with treatment and period as fixed and subject as a random factor. The estimated geometric 
mean ratios and their 90% confidence intervals (CI) are calculated by exponentially transforming 
corresponding treatment contrasts (log scale) and CIs obtained from the mixed model. If the 
exponentially transformed 90% CIs for AUC ins.0-30h and C ins.max fell within the limits 0.8-1.25, 
bioequivalence was accepted. Secondary AUC-based PK endpoints are analysed using the same 
approach, but CIs are not required to fulfil the 0.8-1.25 limits.

Results 
A total of 114 subjects were included in the study, 2 subjects withdrew consent after the first treatment 
(Lantus EU), 1 subject was excluded from analyses because he was included into the study although 
fulfilling an exclusion criterion.  
LC MS/MS 
As seen during the blinded data review, median insulin glargine and M2 concentrations were below LLoQ 
at each time point. Thus, the following evaluations focus on the pharmacokinetic evaluations of M1, the 
predominant insulin glargine metabolite.

exclusion of many profiles, and only 72 out of 111 subjects treated with Semglee and Lantus EU could be 
included in the primary analysis. However, sensitivity analyses provided by the applicant range from 
including all subjects to including only subjects with profiles that have specific minimum numbers of

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
PD was evaluated as part of the PK study using an automated hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp 
method. Study duration after administration of test or reference was 30 hours. Subjects were connected 
to a Biostator at 1-6 hours prior to administration of trial drug. The subjects remained fasting during the 
entire glucose clamp. A variable infusion of human regular soluble insulin or glucose was initiated in order 
to obtain a blood glucose level of 5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). This level (±20%) had to be kept continuously 
for at least 1 hour before trial product administration. At 20 minutes prior to trial product administration 
the insulin infusion was completely terminated. The body weight at Visit 2 was used to calculate the dose 
for all three clamp experiments at Visit 2, 3 and 4. 
After trial drug administration, a variable i.v. infusion of a 20% glucose solution was initiated by the 
Biostator, which automatically calculated the appropriate glucose infusion rate (GIR) to keep the glucose

concentration constant at the glucose clamp target of 5.5 mmol/L. In case a high glucose infusion rate 
(GIR) was necessary, a part of the glucose infusion was done by an external pump. 
The blood glucose measurements of the Biostator were re-calibrated at regular intervals (at least every 
30 minutes) by blood glucose measurements performed with a laboratory method (Super GL Glucose 
Analyzer). 
Statistical methods 
The analysis of PD data was based on the PD-Full-Analysis-Set. Log-transformed primary PD endpoints 
AUCGIR.0-30h and GIRmax were analysed in the same way as primary PK endpoints. However, besides 90% 
CIs also 95% CIs were provided for geometric mean ratios. Secondary PD endpoints AUCGIR.0-6h and 
AUCGIR.6-30h were analysed using the same statistical approach as applied for the primary endpoints, but 
CIs for these endpoints are not required to fulfil specific requirements.  
GIRmax and tGIRmax were derived from smoothed GIR profiles. Smoothing was done using a locally 
weighted regression technique (SAS procedure PROC LOESS) with smoothing parameter 0.3. 
Results 
In general, the analysis of pharmacodynamic data was done as outlined in the protocol / statistical 
analysis plan. Inspection of the blinded to sequence (but not blinded to subject ID) PD data, however, 
revealed a number of profiles which had no glucose infusion requirements during a clamp period. In these 
cases, AUCGIR.0-30h and GIRmax are equal to zero and no log-transformation is possible. In addition, several 
subjects had very low glucose infusion requirements. Therefore, it was decided in the first Database 
Release Meeting that all subjects with any profiles of AUCGIR.0-30h ≤ 50 (h*mg/kg/min) should be excluded 
from the primary PD analysis. 
Four, six and five subjects were excluded for Semglee, Lantus EU and Lantus US, respectively.  
In addition, it was decided at the Database Release Meeting that four subjects (Lantus US: 1; Lantus EU: 
2; Semglee: 1) were to be excluded from GIRmax analysis due to technical problems which lead to 
obviously incorrect GIRmax values.

In the primary analysis for Study GLARGCT100111, a cutoff value based on AUCGIR0-30h of 50 mg/kg/min, 
which was approximately 5% of the mean AUCGIR0-30h, was used. A PD sensitivity analysis was conducted 
for which geometric mean and 95% CI were calculated when using different cut-off values, ranging from 
5 h*mg/kg/min to 500 h*mg/kg/min (around 0.5% to 50% of the mean AUCGIR0-30h). The outcome of 
this analysis in respect to AUCGIR0-30h and GIRmax is graphically shown in the figure below. For all tested 
cut-offs greater than zero the 95% CI lies within the desired range. The mean ratios are always close to 
unity.  
Sensitivity analysis for geometric mean ratio, based on PD data  
For Geometric Mean analysis, in cases of zero, the parameters AUCGIR0-30h and GIRmax were set to the 
lowest  value  greater  than  0  (over  all  subjects),  which  were  0.94  for  AUCGIR0-30h  and  0.0044067  for 
GIRmax. 
Zero values do not allow calculation of a geometric mean; therefore, in case of AUCGIR = 0 and GIRmax = 
0, a small non-zero value must be assumed to allow calculation of the geometric mean. In consequence, 
the resulting geometric mean depends on the value selected for substituting zero. Thus, in case of the 
cut-off point zero, the ratios and CIs are somewhat arbitrary. The method for selecting a suitable 
substitution for zero AUCGIR values is explained in the footnote of the table and is considered 
appropriate. Even with the lowest non-zero cut-off value (5 h*mg/kg/min, 0.5% of mean AUCGIR0-30h) 
the desired 95% CI is clearly met. Therefore, this sensitivity analysis implies that disregarded subjects 
with low AUCGIR did not introduce bias. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The design of the PK/PD study was generally in line with the biosimilar insulin guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1). The automated hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamp used in 
the study is regarded as the most accurate method for comparing the PD effect of insulins and insulin 
Assessment report  
EMA/119474/2018  
Page 44/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analogues. The duration of the clamp was 30 hours, which is greater than the minimum length of 24 hours 
recommended by the guideline.  
The pharmacokinetic evaluation was restricted to M1, the predominant insulin glargine metabolite, which 
is acceptable since the parent drug is immediately converted and therefore not measurable. M1 
determination with LC-MS/MS was quite insensitive (LLoQ = 0.2 ng/mL) which, however, was the usual 
sensitivity of this new glargine-specific assay at that time. This rather high LLoQ led to exclusion of about 
one third of subjects from the primary PK analysis. However, several sensitivity analyses were provided 
by the applicant, ranging from including all subjects to including only subjects with profiles that had a 
certain minimum of evaluable measurements and sensitivity analyses using different LLoQs. All these 
sensitivity analyses yield similar conclusions and equivalence criteria are well met for all analyses. There 
is no indication for introduction of a relevant bias by the exclusion of several PK-profiles due to the LLoQ 
for M1 of 0.2 ng/mL. The PK results can be considered robust. Therefore, the PK results support a 
conclusion of biosimilarity. 
The primary analysis of PD endpoints as presented by the applicant deviates from the study 
protocol/statistical analysis plan as, although a “blinded” review of the data was foreseen, no specific 
cut-off value for exclusion of low GIR-profiles was pre-specified. Based on this “blinded” review of data, 
the applicant decided to exclude subjects with any profile of AUCGIR.0-30h ≤ 50 (mg/kg). This analysis 
yielded 95% CIs meeting the pre-defined acceptance range of 80-125%. However, including all profiles 
and using the pre-specified analysis of log-transformed data, the 95% confidence intervals for the 
Semglee versus Lantus EU comparison were not contained within the pre-specified margins for either 
primary PD endpoint (AUCGIR0-30: 1.02 [0.782;1.34] and GIRmax: 1.04 [0.85;1,28]).  
The latter analysis should still be considered primary since the cut-off value for exclusion of low profiles 
was not prespecified and exclusion of low profiles increases the chance to conclude equivalence. In 
addition, reviewers were blinded to sequence but not blinded to subject ID. Hence, equivalence with 
regard to PD endpoints was formally not shown.  
However, the guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products 
containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1) 
does not mandatorily require the PD results as primary endpoint. The guideline states with respect to PD 
endpoints: If, based on comprehensive analytical characterisation and non-clinical in vitro tests using 
sensitive, orthogonal and state-of-the art methods, close similarity in physicochemical and functional 
characteristics can clearly be shown for the biosimilar and the reference insulin, all GIR-related 
parameters may be defined as secondary endpoints. Nevertheless, the PD results should always 
reasonably support the PK results. 
The data presented by the applicant in respect to analytical characterisation and non-clinical in vitro tests 
indicate similarity between MYL-1501D and EU-insulin glargine and results of the functional assays are 
reliable. Thus, similarity at the analytical and functional level together with PK similarity makes it unlikely 
that the variability in the PD data reflects product-related dissimilarity. Hence, GIR endpoints can be 
considered as secondary endpoints. Based on analytical and non-clinical data GIR endpoints can be 
considered as secondary endpoints. There is no evidence that the PD analysis with the 95% confidence 
intervals for the MYL-1501D versus Lantus-EU comparison being outside the pre-specified 80% to 125% 
margins for both AUCGIR0-30h and GIRmax is due to true differences in PD behaviour. 
The Applicant argued that low insulin response is neither specific to this study nor related to insulin 
resistance, that it was equally distributed between treatments and that low responses were not always 
seen in the same subjects, but rather occurred inconsistently (usually in just 1 out of 3 clamps).

EMA/119474/2018  
Page 45/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, the mean ratio remained close to 1 in all presented analyses supporting the notion that 
intra-individual variability is the likely cause for not meeting the primary objective.  
Since low responses complicate an analysis based on log-transformed data and increases the variance, 
the applicant provided results of an analysis based on the non-transformed data (i.e. assuming normality) 
including profiles of all subjects. This additional analysis resulted in CIs that are well within the 80-125% 
margins (AUCGIR: 0.997 [0.887;1.122] and GIRmax: 1.04 [0.941;1.153]). Neither log-transformed nor 
non-transformed data histograms of studentized residuals seem to indicate relevant deviations from the 
distributional assumption. 
Furthermore, the applicant provided additional sensitivity analyses for PD data that used different cut-offs 
for data exclusion (ranging from no exclusion to exclusion of profiles with AUCGIR≤500 mg/kg/min) to 
understand robustness of data and to evaluate any bias. All these analyses showed similar point 
estimates close to 1 with CIs getting tighter when excluding low profiles.  
In summary, there is no indicator that the PD analysis with the 95% confidence intervals for the 
MYL-1501D versus Lantus-EU comparison being outside the pre-specified 80% to 125% margins for both 
AUCGIR0-30h and GIRmax is due to true differences in PD-kinetics. The PD results can best be explained by 
intraindividual variability of study subjects. PD data reasonably support PK results. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A time interval of 0-30 hours post-dose is acceptable for a long acting insulin. 
Due to the difficulties with the ELISA-assay, the additional LC MS/MS quantification of the insulin glargine 
metabolite M1 is considered the pivotal assay. This analysis is burdened by a low sensitivity resulting in 
a high number of concentration profiles which had been excluded from analysis. However, supported by 
sensitivity analyses all fulfilling equivalence criteria, similarity between the pharmacokinetics of Semglee 
and Lantus EU can be concluded. 
Deviating from the protocol and SAP, profiles with AUCGIR.0-30h ≤ 50 (mg/kg) were excluded from the 
analysis of PD endpoints based on data not blinded to subject ID. This is in general not acceptable. 
Primary focus should therefore be on the pre-specified analysis including all patients. This analysis failed 
to show equivalence since the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were not contained within the 
pre-specified margins (AUCGIR0-30: 1.02 [0.782;1.34] and GIRmax: 1.04 [0.85;1,28]).  
However, the data presented by the applicant in respect to analytical characterisation and non-clinical in 
vitro tests indicate similarity between MYL-1501D and EU-insulin glargine and results of the functional 
assays are reliable. Thus, similarity at the analytical and functional level together with PK similarity makes 
it unlikely that the variability in the PD data reflects product-related dissimilarity. Hence, GIR endpoints 
can be considered as secondary endpoints in line with the “Guideline on non-clinical and clinical 
development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin 
analogues" (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1). 
While equivalence for PD endpoints is not formally shown, PD results still reasonably support PK data. For 
PD endpoints, the mean ratio remained close to 1 independent of number of subjects excluded with 
confidence intervals becoming tighter when excluding low profiles. Low GIR responses were not always 
seen in the same subjects, but rather occurred inconsistently (usually in just 1 out of 3 clamps) and were 
equally distributed between treatments. An analysis based on non-transformed data including all 
subjects/profiles might have been an alternative option and results in confidence intervals that are well 
within the 80-125% margin (AUCGIR: 0.997 [0.887;1.122] and GIRmax: 1.04 [0.941;1.153]).

In summary, there is no indicator that the PD analysis with the 95% confidence intervals for the 
MYL-1501D versus Lantus-EU comparison being outside the pre-specified 80% to 125% margins for both 
AUCGIR0-30h and GIRmax is due to true differences in PD behaviour. The PD results can best be explained 
by intraindividual variability of study subjects. PD data reasonably support PK results. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Introduction 
MYL-1501D (also described as MYL-1501D, Glargine Mylan) has been developed to be a biosimilar 
product to Lantus. The Company is seeking approval for the same indication as the one approved for 
Lantus, i.e. for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults and children over 2 years of age. 
Dose response study 
  N/A 
Main studies 
One phase III study was conducted with MYL-1501D to compare efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of 
MYL501D with Lantus US in patients with T1DM. Results are presented at week 24, the study has been 
ongoing at time of submission. The study was conducted with formulation D, the formulation intended for 
commercialization in the EU. The key goal of this study was to demonstrate a similar glycaemic efficacy 
with similar insulin doses between MYL501D and Lantus and to demonstrate safety, with a focus on 
immunogenicity, between the MYL501D and Lantus treatment groups. 
In addition, Clinical study reports (CSRs) of 2 supporting safety/efficacy studies conducted by Mylan's 
co-development partner Biocon with another partner for Japan were submitted. 
Study MYL-GAI-3002 (safety/ efficacy/ immunogenicity study in T2DM) and Study MYL-1501D-3003 (to 
study the interchangeability of MYL-1501D with Lantus) are ongoing; no efficacy results are submitted 
yet. 
As these studies are not formal requirements according to the Guideline on similar medicinal products 
containing recombinant human insulin they are only considered as supportive for efficacy. The euglycemic 
PK/PD clamp studies are considered pivotal to demonstrate comparable efficacy. In this overview detailed 
information is given for study MYL-GAI-3001 (details on supportive studies are given in the Clinical AR): 
Study MYL-GAI-3001: open-label, randomized, multi-center, parallel-group study to compare the 
efficacy and safety of MYL-1501D with Lantus-US in T1DM patients. Results at week 24 were presented 
within the initial submission (protocol number: MYL-GAI-3001); 52 week results were submitted with the 
responses to the Day 120 List of Questions. The primary endpoint of the study was change in HbA1c at 
Week 24; in the following, 24 week results and 52 week results are provided. An overview is given in the 
following table:

Design and conduct: following a 4-week screening period, all patients were shifted from their current 
mealtime insulin to Humalog and were titrated on Lantus during a six-week run-in period. Thereafter, 
patients were randomised to either Lantus or MYL1501D; after all patients had been exposed to 24 weeks 
of treatment, data were unblinded and an analysis for the primary endpoint was performed. An overview 
of the study design is given in the following table: 
Treatments 
Test Product, dose and mode of administration, batch number: Mylan's insulin glargine 100 IU/mL 
provided in a pre-filled disposable pen with a 3 mL cartridge was administered as a subcutaneous 
injection dosed as prescribed by the treating physician for the patient's need. The batch numbers were as 
follows: D050010, D050011, D050012, D050016, D050015, and BF15002786. 
Reference Therapy, dose and mode of administration, batch number: Lantus (100 IU/mL) 
provided in a pre-filled disposable pen with a 3 mL cartridge was administered as a subcutaneous 
injection dosed as prescribed by the treating physician for the patient's need. The batch numbers were as 
follows: 4F924A, 4F723A, 4F1034A, and 5F1346A. 
Mealtime Insulin (non-investigational medicinal product), batch number: 
Humalog (insulin lispro), referred to as mealtime insulin, provided in Kwikpen disposable pens (100 
U/mL) and administered as subcutaneous injections as prescribed by the treating physician for the 
patients' need. The batch numbers were as follows: C179320A, C276579A, C355204A, C269495D, 
C318195, and C400644. 
Patient population 
It was planned to randomize 500 patients; 832 patients were screened and 558 patients were 
randomized. A total of 557 patients were analyzed for efficacy and 558 patients were analyzed for safety. 
Patients with established diagnosis of T1DM per American Diabetes Association 2014 criteria who fulfilled 
the following criteria were included in this study: 
1.  Initiation of insulin treatment within 6 months of T1DM diagnosis 
2.  Treatment with basal-bolus insulin therapy for at least 1 year before screening 
3.  Fasting plasma C-peptide <0.3 nmol/L at screening 
4.  Patient was treated with once-daily Lantus at stable dose (±15% variation in dose) for at least 3 
months at screening 
5.  Glycosylated hemoglobin ≤9.5% at screening 
6.  Male or female, age between 18 to 65 years. 
Blinding: the study was conducted open-label. To minimize bias, the treatment assignments were not 
revealed to the bioanalytical laboratory for the antibody determinations, the central laboratory for the 
safety (clinical safety laboratory and immunogenicity) and efficacy (HbA1c) analyses, and for study 
members who were not in direct contact with the centers during conduct of the study. The investigator 
and patients were not blinded to the treatment assignments. In addition, before the interim database 
lock, study team members who were involved in making analysis-related decisions such as excluding 
subjects for the PP population, were also blinded.

The primary efficacy outcome was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. The primary efficacy 
analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. A 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) 
was used to establish non-inferiority of MYL IG to Lantus. A repeated measures analysis employing a 
restricted maximum likelihood-based, mixed effects model approach (MMRM) was used to produce a 95% 
CI for the difference between MYL IG and Lantus for mean change of HbA1c at week 24. The MMRM model 
included the fixed, categorical effect of treatment group assignment, visit, treatment group-by-visit 
interaction, and the other fixed-effect terms of region, basal insulin dosing time, and baseline HbA1c 
value as covariates. The data collected at baseline, Week 12, and Week 24 was used in the MMRM model 
for the interim analysis. For patients who prematurely withdrew from the study, if the last post-baseline 
data was not collected at a scheduled visit, then it was mapped to the next scheduled visit and that data 
was included in the analysis. Non-inferiority of MYL IG to Lantus was established if the upper bound of the 
95% CI was no greater than 0.4% at 24 weeks. The least squares (LS) means for each treatment group 
and associated standard errors were derived. Differences in LS means were calculated as associated 
2-sided 95% CI. A further robustness check was conducted on the primary efficacy variable using the 
per-protocol (PP) population and applied the same MMRM procedure to establish non-inferiority. Other 
sensitivity analyses were also used to check robustness of primary analysis method. The secondary 
efficacy analyses were performed on the IIT population. Similar statistical analysis approach for primary 
variable was performed for all secondary continuous variables. The secondary variables included HbA1c 
change from baseline at scheduled visits, change in fasting plasma glucose from baseline at scheduled 
visits, changes in SMBG levels from baseline at scheduled visits, changes in daily insulin dose unit/body 
weight (mealtime insulin, basal insulin, and total insulin) from baseline at scheduled visits. Furthermore, 
the percentage of patients reaching the target HbA1c (<7%) was summarized, and compared by 
treatment using the Cochran-Mantel–Haenszel test with basal insulin dosing time as stratification factor. 
Contrasts of LS mean at each scheduled visit was used to evaluate all pairwise treatment comparisons, 
and 95% confidence intervals for treatment differences in LS means were computed for each visit. The 
secondary safety analyses were performed on the safety population and similar analysis methods of 
secondary efficacy analysis for continuous variables were also used. The secondary safety variables 
included hypoglycaemic rate, antibody specific bindings, vital sign, and laboratory measurements. For 
safety categorical data analyses such as incidence of AEs, incidences of hypoglycaemic events, and 
incidences of total anti-drug antibody (ADA) and cross-reactive insulin anti-body, Fisher’s exact test or 
Chi-squared test were used. 
An interim database lock was conducted after all the patients were exposed to 24 weeks of treatment 
(completed visit 17). Following the interim database lock, an interim analysis corresponding to the 
primary analysis was planned and performed. The results of the interim analysis are kept confidential and 
have not been communicated to the study centers except one investigator for reviewing the CSR.

Primary efficacy parameter: change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 
The LS mean difference at Week 24 (primary endpoint) between the two groups was 0.03% (SE, 0.046) 
and the 95% CI was -0.066% to 0.117%, and was within the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of 0.4%. 
The primary efficacy analysis (non-inferiority test for change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24) for the 
ITT population, the results of sensitivity analyses performed using the PP population and the results of 
sensitivity analyses investigating the impact of missing data are summarized in the following table:

After Week 52, the LS mean difference in HbA1c between the two groups was -0.05% (SD, 0.052) and 
the 95% CI was -0.148% to 0.057%, again within the non-inferiority margin of 0.4%, see table below.

Secondary efficacy parameters 
A clinically non-significant decrease in the mean FPG at Week 24 from baseline (-0.81 mmol/L; p=0.004) 
was observed for MYL IG; while there was a slight increase from baseline in Lantus group (0.09 mmol/L; 
p=0.745). There was a statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups (p=0.017) at 
Week 24. At Week 52, mean FPG increased from baseline by 0.23 mmol/L in the MYL IG and by 0.43 
mmol/L in the Lantus group. The differences vs. baseline and the difference between the groups were not 
statistically significant. 
The SMBG profiles were comparable between two treatment groups. The overall average mean for the 
change from baseline for SMBG at Week 24 was -0.078 for MYL IG and -0.095 for Lantus treatment group; 
the difference between groups was not statistically significant (p=0.893). At Week 52, the overall average 
mean change from baseline was -0.082 for both treatment groups. 
At Week 24, there was no statistically significant difference in change from baseline between the two 
treatment groups for mealtime and total daily insulin doses (p=0.574 and p=0.567 respectively).

There was a statistically significant difference in change from baseline between treatment groups for 
daily basal insulin dose at Week 24 (p=0.002). At baseline, patients in MYL IG groups had lower daily 
basal insulin dose (0.3138 U/kg) compared to the patients in Lantus group (0.3289 U/kg). The mean 
change from baseline at Week 24 of daily basal dose for the MYL IG treatment group and the Lantus 
treatment group were 0.0152 U/kg and 0.0034 U/kg, respectively. During the course of the study, the 
basal insulin doses in both treatment groups converged leading to a similar basal insulin dose at Week 24. 
At Week 52, the mealtime insulin doses were still similar, 0.3795 vs. 0.3629 U/kg (MYL IG vs. Lantus). 
Basal insulin use still was numerically higher in the MYL IG group, 0.0128 vs. 0.0043 U/kg (MYL IG vs. 
Lantus); the difference was not statistically significant. 
The proportion of patients with HbA1c <7% at Week 24 was comparable between the two treatment 
groups as there were 73 (26.1%) patients in the MYL IG treatment group and 84 (30.3%) patients in the 
Lantus treatment group. The difference between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant 
(p=0.250). At Week 52, 65 patients (23.2%) in the MYL IG and 61 patients (22.0%) in the Lantus group 
had an HbA1c below 7%. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main focus of this application is to show that MYL-1501D (MYL-1501D, Glargine Mylan) is biosimilar 
to the reference product Lantus. The PK/PD clamp studies are therefore considered to be pivotal for the 
demonstration of equivalent efficacy. Efficacy data from clinical trials using HbA1c as endpoint are rather 
insensitive and can therefore only be considered supportive. No dose-finding studies have been 
performed which is acceptable for a biosimilar. 
The efficacy profile of MYL-1501D was demonstrated based on 24-week data from a phase III clinical trial 
(study MYL-GAI-3001). This study was a randomized, open-label, 2-parallel group efficacy study 
comparing MYL1501D and Lantus in subjects with T1DM. Reduction of HbA1c from baseline after 24 
weeks was the primary efficacy endpoint. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.4% has likewise 
been used in previous studies and is acceptable. Secondary efficacy endpoints, including SMBG profiles, 
insulin doses, the proportion of subjects achieving glycaemic goals and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) are 
commonplace in studies of anti-hyperglycaemic medications. 
The study was conducted open–label, i.e. subjects, investigators and sponsor personnel were aware of 
subject treatment assignments, but laboratory personnel remained unaware. This is acceptable for 
comparing two injectables administered by patients such as insulin. 
A supportive study (FFP-112-02) was conducted in Japanese T1DM patients using Lantus JP as reference 
investigational product. In general, the same design as in study MYL-GAI-3001 has been used; in this 
supportive study data at week 52 were also submitted.  
Efficacy data 
The treatment groups in study MYL-GAI-3001 were generally well-balanced and representative of the EU 
population. Equivalence was demonstrated between MYL1501D and Lantus for change from baseline in 
HbA1c at 24 weeks in patients with T1DM. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed on both ITT and 
PP populations with different methods and all demonstrated non-inferiority. Results from the secondary 
efficacy analyses (SMBG profiles, change from baseline in total and meal time insulin doses, proportion of

patients with HbA1c below 7%) supported similarity between MYL1501D and Lantus. The statistically 
significant difference at week 24 in FPG (with a slight decrease in FPG with MYL1501D and a slight 
increase with Lantus) is likely a chance finding and is not considered clinically relevant. The same applies 
for the difference in the mean change from baseline at week 24 for daily basal insulin dose between the 
two treatment groups (with a moderately greater increase in dose from baseline found for the MYL1501D 
group). The latter could at least partly be explained by a more intense titration due to a slightly lower 
baseline dose of basal insulin in the MYL1501 D group.  
Results of the supportive study conducted in Japan (FFP-112-02) also showed similarity in 
antihyperglycaemic efficacy between the investigational insulin glargine and Lantus JP, which was 
maintained throughout week 52. 
During the procedure, updated data for study MYL-GAI-3001, including results at week 52, has been 
submitted. Small errors in previously submitted results of the primary 24 wk analysis (HbA1c) and results 
of secondary endpoints slightly differed (to a clinically not relevant extent), due to a software error, and 
were corrected in this submission.  
2.5.2.  Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
As the euglycaemic clamp PK/ PD studies are considered to be the most sensitive approach in establishing 
similar efficacy of two insulins claimed to be biosimilar, study MYL-GAI-3001 is considered only supportive 
with regard to efficacy in this application dossier. Equivalence with regard to HbA1c change from baseline 
at week 24 between MYL1501D and Lantus in patients with T2DM was demonstrated and this was 
achieved at similar week 24 total insulin doses. Antihyperglycaemic efficacy was maintained at week 52 
with similar results across treatment groups. The results on the secondary endpoints generally support 
the primary outcome.  
2.5.3.  Clinical safety 
The safety assessment is mainly based on the main, world-wide phase 3 trial MYL-GAI-3001 (3001 for 
short) in Type 1 diabetics. In this study, Lantus sourced in the United States (US) served as comparator. 
Pharmaceutical bridging studies were performed to address representativeness of US Lantus for EU Lanus 
(see quality part). 
The other two completed phase 3 trials, CLG031/BIO012/DM/GLA/2007 (2007 for short) and FFP-112-02 
(FFP-02 for short) were conducted outside Europe (India and Japan) and used formulations of Mylan's 
insulin glargine that differ from the formulation intended to be marketed. Furthermore, the comparator 
(Lantus) was sourced outside the EU, and no pharmaceutical bridging studies to EU Lantus were 
performed for these Asian Lantus preparations. 
The supportive studies revealed no specific safety concern for Glargine Mylan. Hypoglycaemia was the 
most frequently reported AE type; the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions 
was low and gave no hint for enhanced immunogenicity of Glargine Mylan. Since the Mylan preparations 
used in the supportive studies differed from the preparation intended for marketing and since Lantus 
sourced from outside EU was used without showing representativeness, the results regarding anti-insulin 
antibodies from these studies are considered not relevant for the present application. Safety aspects of 
the supportive studies will not be discussed in further detail.

Patient exposure 
In Study 3001, 558 patients were evaluated for safety, 280 in the Mylan and 278 in the Lantus group. 
Through Week 52, the mean exposure of patients exposed to MYL IG was 351.0 days (SD: 60.07) and to 
Lantus was 348.6 days (SD: 70.74). 
Adverse events 
The following table provides an overview of the AE incidence in Study 3001 (52 week data). 80.4% and 
86.0% in the Mylan and Lantus group, respectively, had at least one AE (mainly hypoglycaemia). 6.4% in 
the Mylan and 7.9% in the Lantus group had at least an SAE. Also in the other AE categories shown below 
no remarkable differences between Mylan and Lantus were observed.

Far the most AEs were hypoglycaemias. Otherwise, respiratory and urinary tract infections were rather 
frequent. There was a numerical imbalance for nasopharyngitis and for headache (both were more 
frequent in the Lantus group), but this is most likely a chance finding and not related to study medication. 
In general, the frequencies of the different AE types were similar in the Mylan and Lantus group.  
Hypoglycaemia 
All hypoglycaemia 
Hypoglycaemia rate per patient per 30 days calculated between two visits is defined as total number of 
episodes between two visits divided by the number of days between the visits, multiplied by 30 days. The 
hypoglycaemic rates include severe hypoglycaemia, documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia, 
asymptomatic hypoglycaemia, probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia, relative hypoglycaemia, and 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The number of events especially of asymptomatic hypoglycaemia is dependent 
on how extensively the blood glucose was monitored which was different throughout the study. To ensure 
appropriate titration, during the run-in period and the first 4 weeks post randomization, eight point SMBG 
was performed three days a week every week, while after Week 4, it was performed at 4 week interval. 
Asymptomatic hypoglycaemia was defined as an event not accompanied by typical symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia but with a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). 
Assessment report  
EMA/119474/2018  
Page 56/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall constant profiles of hypoglycaemic rate were observed in both treatment groups at both run-in 
and treatment periods (see figure below). At baseline mean actual rates were 7.849 (episodes/30 days) 
in MYL IG treatment group and 7.462 (episodes/30 days) in Lantus treatment group. The mean values of 
actual rate were 2.852 versus 2.661 (episodes/30 days) at Week 24 and 1.739 versus 1.732 episodes/30 
days at Week 52 in MYL IG and Lantus groups respectively.

Treatment Safety Population 
Nocturnal hypoglycaemia 
Similar to anytime hypoglycaemic profiles, the nocturnal hypoglycaemia event rates were also 
comparable between the two treatment groups. At baseline, mean actual nocturnal rates were 1.555 
(episodes/30 days) in MYL IG treatment group and 1.368 (episodes/30 days) in Lantus treatment group. 
The mean values of actual rate were 0.538 versus 0.404 (episodes/30 days) at Week 24 and 0.238 versus 
0.264 (episodes/30 days) at Week 52 in MYL IG and Lantus treatment groups, respectively (see figure 
below).

Severe hypoglycaemia 
An event was considered severe hypoglycaemia if it required the assistance of another person to actively 
administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions which resulted in neurological recovery, 
regardless of the availability of a blood glucose measurement. 
Incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events was rare in both treatment groups. Similar incidences were 
reported in both treatment groups at scheduled visits. Of 11 patients with a severe hypoglycaemic event 
in MYL IG treatment group, 8 (2.9%) patients reported at least one severe hypoglycaemic event at night 
time while 7 (2.5%) patients reported at least one severe hypoglycaemic events at night time in Lantus 
treatment group. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Three patients died in Study 3001: 
•  Patient 0020602 (Lantus group), a 61-year old Caucasian male, had a myocardial infarction on Day 
50 of treatment. The investigator considered the event to be unrelated to study drug. The patient 
died on Day 62 of treatment. An autopsy was not performed 
•  Patient 1103403 (MYL IG group), a 42-year old male, experienced the SAE of hypoglycaemia on Day 
70 of treatment. The investigator considered the event to be probably related to study drug. The 
patient died on the same day. An autopsy was not performed. 
 
Patient 1102105 (MYL IG treatment group), a 65-year-old female, died on Day 347 of treatment due 
to unknown aetiology. The event of death was considered unlikely related to the study medication. 
An autopsy was not performed. 
Hypoglycaemia reflects an exaggerated PD effect of insulin. Therefore, the respective fatal event does not 
indicate a safety concern for Mylan's insulin glargine.

SAEs in Study 3001 
A total of 40 (7.2%) patients (18 [6.4%] versus 22 [7.9%] in MYL IG and Lantus treatment group, 
respectively) experienced at least one TESAE. The highest incidence of SAEs overall was observed for 
metabolism and nutrition disorders SOC; 7 (2.5%) patients and 10 (3.6%) patients in MYL IG and Lantus 
treatment groups, respectively. At the preferred term level, hypoglycaemia occurred with the highest 
frequency; 8 events the in MYL IG treatment group and 16 events in the Lantus treatment group. 
Generalized tonic-clonic seizure and goiter, each experienced by 2 patients in the Lantus treatment 
group, and acute kidney injury, experienced by 2 patients in the MYL IG treatment group, were the only 
other SAE PTs reported for more than 1 patient. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no meaningful changes in the mean values of the standard haematology and clinical chemistry 
parameters obtained. Some patients displayed individual clinically significant abnormalities; e.g., three 
patients in the Lantus group had low neutrophil or platelet count at a certain visit. Regarding serum 
chemistry, there were isolated changes in laboratory values at various time points but there was no 
consistent trend and there was no difference in the treatment groups. There were no patients with 
marked abnormal laboratory criteria in urinalysis parameters reported in this study. 
Vital signs: There were no clinically meaningful changes in mean values from baseline to Week 12, Week 
24, or Week 52 of the study for vital signs within the treatment groups. No clinically relevant treatment 
group differences were noted in the mean change from baseline for any vital signs. 
Safety in special populations 
Investigating safety in special populations in not required for a biosimilar application and hence was not 
done by the applicant. 
Immunological events 
Potential immunological effects of insulin are assessed based on injection site reactions, hypersensitivity 
reactions and formation of anti-insulin antibodies (incidence and semi-quantitative plasma level). Note 
that anti-insulin antibodies will be called anti-drug antibodies (ADA) in the following.

Injection site reactions 
No injection site reactions were reported. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
The following table summarises the observed potential hypersensitivity reactions in the Mylan and Lantus 
group. The number of events was low, and no meaningful differences between Mylan and Lantus became 
obvious.

The analytical method uses a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) format. Positive controls (PC) were 
prepared by spiking guinea pig anti-Lantus/Mylan Insulin Glargine (anti-LAN/MIG antibody) into the 
negative control (NC) serum pool. Samples underwent acid dissociation to release any anti-insulin 
antibodies complexed with free drug, followed with charcoal absorption of the free insulin analogue. The 
treated samples were neutralized with Tris buffer and centrifuged to sediment the charcoal. The 
supernatant was incubated at 2 to 8°C overnight with the corresponding [125I]-labelled tracer under the 
following conditions for both MIG and LAN tracers: 
•  RIPA Assay Buffer only 
•  RIPA Assay Buffer with excess unlabelled MIG 
•  RIPA Assay Buffer with excess unlabelled LAN 
•  RIPA Assay Buffer with excess unlabelled Novolin R (NOV; fast acting human insulin produced by Novo 
Nordisk) 
Positive Controls were prepared by spiking the pool of antibody-negative sera with guinea pig 
anti-Lantus/Mylan insulin glargine antibody supplied by Biocon Research Ltd at a concentration of 0.67 
mg/mL. 
After an overnight incubation, bovine gamma globulin and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were added to 
facilitate precipitation of antibody-tracer complex, centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The 
pellet was washed with PEG solution, vortexed, and centrifuged to re-precipitate the pellet. The 
supernatant was removed, and the pellet was counted on a gamma counter. A set of tubes that contained 
radiolabelled MIG or LAN was used to measure the total counts for the assay. The counts per minute 
(CPM) generated were used to calculate the % binding (%B/T) relative to the total CPM. Specific binding 
(%S/B = the difference between the %B/T for the uninhibited and the inhibited) and drug specific binding 
were reported. 
Two radio immunoprecipitation assays, the MYL IG assay and Lantus assay, were employed for the 
assessment of ADA in each patient samples. A two assay approach was utilized due to the potential 
structural differences between drug products arising from the different host cells used in production. For 
each sample, the presence of antidrug antibodies was reported as Total ADA (positive or negative) with 
the percent specific binding response. Analogous to titre values, the %SB represents was the relative 
amount of antibody present in the samples. Antibodies cross reactive to human insulin were also reported 
in terms of their presence (positive or negative) and relative amount (%SB). The Total ADA in samples (if 
Assessment report  
EMA/119474/2018  
Page 60/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
present) were also characterised in terms of cross reactivity between drug products (MYL IG and Lantus), 
which is reported as Drug Specific ADA. This assessment was the difference in %B/T in a sample inhibited 
with an excess of each drug product in the same assay. 
In order to avoid interference of the ADA assay with the therapeutically administered insulin present in 
plasma, the assay protocol requires liberation of the plasma insulin from the antibodies by acid treatment 
before performing the RIPA. Experiments performed for validation of this step demonstrated that removal 
of glargine from the ligand could be achieved (although not complete) and that the acid treatment did not 
interfere with further steps of the ADA assay. For assay validation, guinea pig anti-insulin antibody 
without insulin ligand was dissolved in normal human serum and used as positive control. 
Results 
Semi-quantitative antibody results, obtained instead of titres, are expressed as % specific binding (%SB) 
towards cross-reacting anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Specific binding and cross-reactivity are defined and 
determined as follows: 
%SB means percent of specific binding. Specific binding usually refers to so-called cross-reactive 
antibodies. 
Specific binding is defined as bound tracer (radioactively labelled MYL-GAI or Lantus) in the absence of 
unlabelled insulin minus bound tracer in the presence of a high surplus of unlabelled insulin. The 
unlabelled insulin occupies all specific binding sites for insulin so that the remaining binding of tracer must 
be unspecific and hence is subtracted to yield specific binding only. 
Cross-reactivity means that the unlabelled insulin used for competition is human insulin instead of 
glargine. Thus, this approach only detects antibodies which also can bind human insulin, not only 
glargine. 
When the same compound was used for tracing and competition, this was called "Total ADA" by the 
applicant. Patient serum samples were tested in both assays (one employed labelled MYL-GAI, and the 
other employed labelled Lantus) in a blinded format). 
 No major differences are expected between the total ADA and the cross-reacting ADA results since most 
ADA most likely bind various insulins since the molecular differences between the different insulins 
discussed here are small. As outlined above, two different tracers were used, MYL GAI and Lantus. The 
applicant has demonstrated that both tracers yielded very similar results, the applicant also 
demonstrated that all detected ADA reacted with MYL GAI as well as with Lantus. 
The figure below shows the time course of ADA level (measures as %SB) over 52 weeks in the Mylan 
(blue) and Lantus (red) group of Study 3001. Data are expressed as change from baseline. Baseline level 
was around 10% SB in both groups. Given the high variability of the results, identified by large error bars, 
essentially no change over time became obvious. For Glargine Mylan, all data points were numerically 
below zero, indicating that ADA level had decreased, but the effect size us small so that no further 
conclusion can be drawn from this observation.

(%SB) Over Time by Treatment for MIG Assay Safety Population. Note: At baseline, %SB was around 10 
in the MYL GAI and in the Lantus group (taken from Figure 14.4.7 of Study Report 3001). 
The ADA incidence, expressed as percentage of patients affected, is listed in the following table. It 
became obvious that the percentage of (total) ADA-positive patients was highest at baseline and was 
always lower during the course of the study. The reason is unclear, but the finding is in line with the %SB 
results shown above. 
The evaluation of cross-reacting ADAs revealed similar results (not shown here).

Neutralising antibodies were not determined in vitro. Instead, the applicant analysed whether there were 
clinical signs for neutralising ADA which can be identified by increasing insulin demand or deteriorating 
glucose control (e.g. HbA1c) in the absence of other reasons. Hence, the applicant provided scatter plots 
of daily insulin dose or HbA1c vs. ADA level where each data point represents an individual patient.

The plot for insulin dose is shown below. It can be derived from the plot that some patients required a 
rather high daily insulin dose, but the ADA level was low in these patients. Vice versa, patients with high 
ADA level had insulin doses in the usual range.  
Figure:Scatter plot of Cross-Reactive Insulin Antibody Percent Binding (%SB) with Total Daily Insulin 
Dose (U/Kg) at Week 24 for MIG Assay Safety Population 
The scatter plot showing HbA1c vs. ADA level is inserted below. There was no clear correlation between 
ADA level and HbA1c level, and there were no clear outlies which may identify patients with poor 
glycaemic control accompanied by high ADA level. The regression analysis of the Mylan group (red line) 
revealed a curve with a weakly positive slope. The slope is probably driven by three outlying data points: 
(1) HbA1c ≈9.6% / ADA level ≈40% SB; (2) HbA1c ≈10.0% / ADA ≈70%; (3) HbA1c ≈11.9% / ADA 
≈22%. The applicant explained that the high HbA1c levels are most likely not due to neutralising ADA. 
Instead, two of the patients had frequent hypoglycaemias so that the insulin regimen was not tightened. 
One patient suffered from Hashimoto's thyroiditis the treatment of which probably has worsened 
glycaemic control.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Investigation of drug-drug interactions is not required for a biosimilar application and hence was not 
performed by the applicant. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
A total of 6 (1.1%) patients in Study 3001 experienced 7 events leading to discontinuation of the study 
drug. Two patients in the Mylan group discontinued study drug due to hypoglycaemia. All other types of 
events occurred only once. For the latter events, relationship to study drug appears unlikely.  
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety evaluation was mainly based on one phase 3 trial in T1DM patients which recruited patient 
worldwide including Europe, which used the current Glargine Mylan formulation and which employed US 
Lantus as comparator; for the latter, representativeness for EU-Lantus was addressed at the 
pharmaceutical level. 
In a biosimilar application, safety assessment of the test product is mainly focussed on comparison to the 
reference product (Lantus) with respect to immunogenicity. General adverse events (AEs) and 
hypoglycaemia were also assessed and revealed no special safety concerns for Insulin Glargine Mylan. 
With regard to adverse drug reactions which are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects (e.g. 
hypoglycaemia), the demonstration of similar PK and PD profiles alone can already provide reasonable 
reassurance that these can be expected at similar frequencies. Results from the phase 3 study support 
the assumption of similar ADR profiles of test and reference.

The incidence of total AEs was similar between Glargine Mylan and Lantus; most AEs were 
hypoglycaemia. Serious AEs were infrequent with Glargine Mylan and Lantus. 
Immunogenicity was assessed at three levels, injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions and 
formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). The latter were characterised with respect to incidence and 
semi-quantitative plasma level (a substitute for titre).  
Injection site reactions were not observed in the main phase 3 study; potential hypersensitivity reactions 
were infrequent and fairly balanced between the treatment groups. ADA incidences and plasma levels 
were similar between the Glargine Mylan and Lantus group. Thus, there was no hint for increased 
immunogenicity of Glargine Mylan from these observations. 
Formation of antibodies against insulin is a well-known phenomenon in diabetics, especially with T1DM. 
Accordingly, most of the study patients had ADA already at baseline. Usually, anti-insulin antibodies are 
of no clinical relevance because they do not block the action of insulin (i.e. they are non-neutralising). 
Clinically relevant neutralising antibodies would lead to increased insulin need or to deteriorating 
glycaemic control. A total of four patients of the Glargine Mylan group had rather high insulin need or 
HbA1c and simultaneously higher ADA levels than most other patients. The applicant provided further 
information on these patients. The most likely reason for the rather poor glycaemic control was the high 
incidence of hypoglycaemic events in three of these patients. One patient had accompanying autoimmune 
disease the therapy of which most likely led to worsening of glycaemic control. 
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The phase 3 study in T1DM patients submitted by the applicant to investigate efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity of Glargine Mylan is adequate. The study gave no evidence for safety concerns or 
increased immunogenicity of Glargine Mylan compared to the reference product Lantus.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
A non-dosing user handling assessment, conducted in accordance with IEC 62366-1:2015 and completed 
with the proposed commercial pen as part of the device design and development programme, confirmed 
that the MYL-1501D pen and the respective IFU are appropriate for use by the intended user population:  
Summative Evaluation Study 
The Summative Evaluation study was a non-dosing user handling assessment completed with the 
proposed commercial pen as part of the device design and development programme. The study was 
designed and conducted in accordance with IEC 62366-1:2015: Application of Usability Engineering to 
Medical Devices. The intent of the study was to confirm that intended users could use the pen safely and 
effectively using the commercial pen design and near final instructions for use (IFU). In the study, users 
were asked to simulate an injection using the pen into an injection surrogate. Users did not actually 
administer a dose of the drug. The primary objectives of the study were 1) to confirm that the MYL-1501D 
pen, when used in accordance with the IFU, could be used safely and effectively by the intended user 
population (diabetic patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals (HCPs)) and 2) to perform an 
assessment of use errors relating to any aspect of use of the pen or IFU. Overall, the number of use errors 
was low. The majority of use errors occurred in untrained participants. As patients, in practice, will receive 
training before the first use of a new pen, it can be concluded that the likelihood of use errors with the 
MYL-1501D pen is low. Non-compliance with instructions to prime injection pen needles is one of the most 
common errors seen in the use of insulin pens. In this study, patients had transferred their habit not to 
prime the pen properly to the usability testing. Therefore, this use error is not considered specific for the 
MYL-1501D pen. Overall, the outcome of the study confirmed that the MYL-1501D pen and the respective 
IFU are appropriate for use by the intended user population.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Semglee contains insulin glargine and has been developed as a biosimilar. The EU reference product 
Lantus is indicated for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years 
and above. The Company was seeking approval for the same indications as those approved for Lantus. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In the development of a biosimilar product, there is no requirement to demonstrate benefit to the patient 
per se as this has been shown for the reference product. The benefits and risks are inferred from the 
similarity of the test product to the reference product in terms of quality, efficacy and safety. 
The reason for development is thus not to fulfil an unmet medical need but to offer a comparable 
alternative to the reference product. The efficacy/safety studies in the development programme included 
patients with prior use of Lantus in combination with a rapidly acting insulin.  
3.1.3.  Main studies 
The goal of a biosimilar development is the demonstration of analytical, functional and clinical similarity 
to the reference product in a comprehensive comparability exercise. Semglee was generally developed in 
line with EU biosimilarity guidelines and EMA scientific advice. 
Quality:  Demonstration  of  analytical  similarity  is  the  mainstay  of  any  biosimilar  development.  The 
applicant has provided the expected extensive analytical similarity studies.  
Nonclinical: In-vitro studies are the most important part of the non-clinical biosimilarity exercise since 
this approach is expected to yield the most accurate characterisation of insulin's action on its primary 
target, the insulin receptor (IR). All insulin effects observed in vivo are a consequence of the interaction 
of insulin (glargine here) with its cognate receptor. As requested by the European guideline on biosimilar 
insulins, receptor interaction testing was performed at three levels, i.e. binding to IR, activation of IR, 
measured as autophosphorylation, and functional consequences of activation. Binding and activation was 
determined separately for both  IR isoforms IR-A and IR-B, and also  for the  IGF1 receptor. Mitogenic 
potential was determined in permanently cultured human tumour cells. Although not requested by the 
guideline, data on in-vivo pharmacology, toxicology and toxicokinetics were also provided. 
Clinical: Euglycaemic clamp PK/ PD studies are considered the most sensitive approach in establishing 
similar efficacy of two insulins claimed to be biosimilar so that the clinical comparability exercise should 
focus  on  this  type  of  studies.  This  dossier  contains  2  clinical  pharmacology  studies,  one  of  which 
compared Semglee with EU sourced Lantus. 
1.  GLARGCT100111  (pivotal,  conducted  by  Mylan’s  co-development  partner,  Biocon)  a  double-blind, 
single-dose,  3-way  crossover,  phase  1  euglycaemic  clamp  PK/PD  study  in  patients  with  type  1 
diabetes mellitus. This study compared MYL-1501D (=Semglee) with Lantus sourced from US as well 
as with Lantus sourced from the EU.  
Assessment report  
EMA/119474/2018  
Page 70/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  FFP-112-01  (supportive,  conducted  by  FUJIFILM  Pharma  Co.,  Ltd.),  a  double-blind,  single-dose, 
two-period crossover, phase 1 euglycaemic clamp pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study 
in healthy Japanese male subjects. This study compared insulin glargine (MYL-1501D) with Lantus 
(Japan-sourced). The comparison of PK and PD effects was done following Japanese guidelines. This 
study was not sponsored by Mylan, and the Applicant submitted this study documentation only for 
informative purposes. 
The applicant also performed a phase 3 clinical efficacy/safety study (MYL-GAI-3001), the efficacy data of 
which are considered supportive. This was an open-label, 52-week study in T1DM patients to compare 
therapeutic  non-inferiority  (margin  0.4%)  of  Mylan  glargine  to  US-Lantus  in  respect  to  HbA1c.  280 
patients were randomised into the Mylan glargine group and 278 patients into the Lantus-US group. More 
than 94% of randomised subjects completed the 24-week study period. 52-week efficacy and safety data 
were submitted during the MAA procedure. 
Supportive phase 3 trials using slightly different Semglee preparations, Lantus sourced outside EU and 
conducted in non-European countries were also submitted.  
The revised product-class specific Guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological 
medicinal 
products 
containing 
recombinant 
human 
insulin 
and 
insulin 
analogues 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1) provides the possibility of waiving the phase 3 clinical trial. 
3.2.   Favourable effects 
Favourable effects supporting the demonstration of biosimilarity to the reference product: 
From a quality perspective: 
The quality documentation provided in the Semglee marketing authorisation application is of acceptable 
quality.  Semglee is manufactured in Pichia pastoris and therefore contains glycosylated variants whereas 
the EU reference product Lantus is manufactured in E. coli and therefore is not glycosylated. However, the 
glycosylated species in the test product have been largely reduced and will be specified at low levels. The 
extensive comparability exercise demonstrated analytical similarity. The residual very small amount of 
glycosylated variants in Semglee is not expected to have any effect on efficacy, safety or immunogenicity. 
In addition, analytical bridging was performed to compare the proposed biosimilar, EU Lantus reference 
product and US Lantus comparator. In general, the choice of the test and reference product batches 
seems appropriate taking into consideration quantity, representativeness and differences in age. An 
analytical bridge could be established between EU- and US-sourced reference product. Therefore, studies 
performed with the US reference product are also relevant for the present application.  
From a non-clinical perspective:  
The applicant's pharmacology programme for establishing biosimilarity of Semglee and Lantus (sourced 
from EU and US) was generally in line with the CHMP insulin biosimilar guideline. Binding to and activation 
of (i.e. autophosphorylation) the two insulin receptor (IR) isoforms, IR-A and IR-B, were tested as well as 
metabolic effects (glucose uptake, adipogenesis and inhibition of lipolysis). Binding and activation tests 
were also done with the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R). Mitogenic activity was tested by testing proliferation of 
permanently cultured human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 in response to stimulation with Semglee and 
Lantus. All assays revealed similar potency of Semglee and Lantus with respect to the tested parameter. 
From a clinical perspective: 
In the pivotal Phase 1 PK/PD clamp study GLARGCT100111 in patients with T1DM, the point estimates 
[90% CIs] of treatment ratio for Semglee vs. Lantus EU for the primary PK parameters INS-Cmax and 
Assessment report  
EMA/119474/2018  
Page 71/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
INS-AUClast were 1.03 [0.97 to 1.10] and 1.01 [0.95 to 1.09], respectively, indicating similar 
pharmacokinetic profiles between Semglee vs. Lantus EU. The results, obtained with LC-MS/MS analyses, 
are supported by an ELISA-assay, though this ELISA-analysis was burdened by major shortcomings.  
In the phase 3 study (MYL-GAI-3001), non-inferiority regarding change in HbA1c was demonstrated. The 
LS mean difference in change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24 between the Semglee and the Lantus 
group was 0.03% (SE, 0.046) and the 95% CI was -0.066% to 0.117%, and was within the pre-defined 
non-inferiority margin of 0.4%. 
The  results  for  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  including  fasting  plasma  glucose  (FPG)  and  SMPG 
profiles, the proportion of subjects achieving glycaemic goals, and changes in insulin dose were overall 
similar for Semglee and Lantus in study MYL-GAI-3001 and thus support the primary results.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
From the quality point of view, the claim of analytical similarity between the MYL1501D test product and 
the reference product Lantus approved in the EU as well as bridging between EU Lantus and US Lantus is 
supported. No uncertainties remain. 
The LC-MS/MS assay used to determine the M1 metabolites of insulin glargine was quite insensitive (LLoQ 
= 0.2 ng/mL) which, however, was the usual sensitivity of this new glargine-specific assay at that time. 
This rather high LLoQ led to exclusion of about one third of subjects from the primary PK analysis. 
However, several sensitivity analyses were provided by the applicant, ranging from including all subjects 
to including only subjects with profiles that had a certain minimum of evaluable measurements and 
sensitivity analyses using different LLoQs. All these sensitivity analyses yielded similar conclusions and 
equivalence criteria were well met for all analyses. Thus, the PK results can be considered robust. 
Therefore, the PK results support a conclusion of biosimilarity. 
Equivalence for PD data was not formally shown since post-hoc exclusion of GIR profiles with a low 
glucose infusion rate, i.e. AUCGIR.0-30h ≤ 50 h*mg/kg/min, is not acceptable. Although a blinded review of 
data with the possibility to exclude low GIR-profiles was pre-specified, the exact cut-off value was not. In 
addition, reviewers were blinded to sequence but not to subject ID. In contrast to the analysis excluding 
patients with low GIR profiles, the analysis not excluding the respective subjects failed to show 
equivalence for the primary PD endpoints AUCGIR.0-30 and GIRmax (95% CIs 0.78 to 1.34 and 0.85 to 1.28, 
respectively). 
Though demonstration of PD similarity formally failed by exceeding the 80-125% margins, it is acceptable 
to consider the PD endpoints as secondary endpoints since the respective requirements outlined in the 
biosimilar insulin guideline are met: similarity between MYL-1501D and EU-insulin glargine in respect to 
analytical characterisation and non-clinical in vitro tests using reliable functional assays has been 
established. Similarity at the analytical and functional level together with PK similarity makes it unlikely 
that the variability in the PD data reflects product-related dissimilarity.  
Furthermore, the following findings show that overall PD data are robust and reasonably support PK data: 
 
the applicant provided additional sensitivity analyses that used different cut-off values for data 
exclusion (ranging from no exclusion to exclusion of profiles with AUCGIR≤500 mg/kg/min). The 
resulting point estimates were similar and close to 1 for all analyses performed  
 
assuming normal distribution might have also been an alternative option. The analysis of 
non-log-transformed data from all subjects yielded results within the 80-125% margins.  
 
no evidence for induction of a bias by exclusion of low profiles could be identified.  
Assessment report  
EMA/119474/2018  
Page 72/76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar results were obtained for comparison of MYL-1501D vs. US-Lantus and EU-Lantus vs. 
US-Lantus. 
 
the PD results are in good agreement with the PK results. 
In addition, absent or low insulin response (i.e. absent or low GIR requirement) was equally distributed 
between treatments and occurred inconsistently (usually in just 1 out of 3 clamps).  
Taken together, there is no evidence that the PD analysis with the 95% confidence intervals for the 
MYL-1501D versus Lantus-EU comparison being outside the pre-specified 80% to 125% margins for both 
AUCGIR0-30h and GIRmax is due to true differences in PD-kinetics. The PD results can best be explained by 
intraindividual variability of study subjects. 
The initial uncertainties are considered resolved. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The ADR profile of insulin glargine is well-known, the most important risk being hypoglycaemia. 
From a nonclinical perspective no issues which would suggest unfavourable effects unique to the test 
product have been identified. 
From a clinical perspective, there were no relevant differences in the overall rate of TEAEs, SAEs, 
treatment discontinuations due to AEs, laboratory findings, hypoglycaemic events, injection site nor 
hypersensitivity reactions between the Semglee and Lantus treatment group in the phase 3 study. The 
adverse events captured mirrored those already described in the SmPC for Lantus. 
In the phase 3 study MYL-GAI-3001 at least one TEAE was reported in 80.4% of patients in the Semglee 
group and 86.0% in the Lantus group. The percentage of patients with at least one serious AE was 6.4% 
in Semglee group and 7.9% in Lantus group.  
The incidence of hypoglycaemia (all sub-categories) was not relevantly different between the Semglee 
and the Lantus treatment group. Up to Week 24, In the Semglee group, 2.84 episodes per 30 days 
occurred, and in the Lantus group 2.67 episodes/30d. 53.6% of the patients in the Semglee group and 
58.3% of the patients in the Lantus group had at least one episode of hypoglycaemia. The percentage of 
patients reporting at least one severe hypoglycaemia was low and was similar in the Semglee group 
(2.9%, 8 patients) and the Lantus group (2.2%, 6 patients). Also up to Week 52 no relevant differences 
in hypoglycaemia incidence was observed. No injection site reactions were observed in this study. 
Potential hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 5 patients (1.8%) in the Semglee and 6 patients 
(2.2%) in the Lantus group (52 wk). 
At baseline, around 73% of the study patients were positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Over the 
52-week period ADA incidence slightly decreased to the same extent in both treatment groups. The ADA 
levels, measured as % specific binding in the ELISA used by the applicant, also remained essentially 
constant during the study in both treatment groups. Since there was no increase in ADA incidence or level 
during the study, treatment-emergent ADA could not be determined. There were no clinical signs for 
neutralising antibodies; some patients had a rather poor glycaemic control but in these cases other 
reasons were more likely (e.g., a high incidence of hypoglycaemia prevented tightening of the insulin 
regimen).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The antibody assay included a step for removal of bound ligand because otherwise antibody molecules 
with insulin attached cannot be detected in the RIPA assay used. Removal of bound ligand was incomplete 
so that the antibody level may be higher than reported. However, this is not considered a concern since 
this affects Glargine Mylan and comparator Lantus to the same extent. Furthermore, the therapeutic 
insulin level is low so that in most cases only a small fraction of antibodies is blocked by attached insulin. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Semglee was developed as biosimilar to Lantus (insulin glargine). Of note, the conclusion of biosimilarity 
is based on the totality-of-the-evidence of the comparability exercise.  
Demonstration of structural and functional similarity is the foundation of any  biosimilar development. 
Analytical results from comprehensive biosimilarity testing indicate that the products can be regarded as 
similar.  
From  a  non-clinical  perspective,  similarity  of  Semglee  and  Lantus  was  shown  in  terms  of  in  vitro 
functionality, mitogenesis, and of toxicological, toxicokinetic and local tolerance profiles. In-vitro results 
are the most important part of the non-clinical biosimilarity exercise since this approach is expected to 
yield  the  most  accurate  characterisation  of  insulin's  action  on  its  primary  target.  All  insulin  effects 
observed in vivo are a consequence of the interaction of insulin (glargine) with its cognate receptor. The 
results presented supported this similarity claim.  
From the clinical point of view, the demonstration of PK/PD similarity in the euglycaemic clamp studies is 
considered key for concluding similar efficacy. Similar PK for test and reference could be concluded since 
several sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results and therefore suggest that the exclusion of patients 
due to the rather high Limit of Quantification (LoQ) of the assay did not bias the results. PD similarity on 
the other hand was not formally shown, most likely due to large intra-individual variability in response to 
insulin glargine resulting in single profiles of absent or low GIR requirements in some subjects. However, 
similarity at the analytical and functional level together with PK similarity makes it unlikely that the 
variability in the PD data reflects product-related dissimilarity. In such cases, PD endpoints may be 
considered secondary in line with the biosimilar insulin guideline. There is no indicator that the PD 
analysis with the 95% confidence intervals for the MYL-1501D versus Lantus-EU comparison being 
outside the pre-specified 80% to 125% margins for both AUCGIR0-30h and GIRmax is due to true differences 
in PD-kinetics. The PD results can best be explained by intraindividual variability of study subjects. PD 
data reasonably support the PK results. 
Demonstration of similar glycaemic control with similar insulin doses within the phase 3 study supports 
biosimilarity. However, the phase 3 study is less sensitive for showing similar efficacy than the PK/PD 
study. 
Adverse  events  can  be  expected  to  occur  at  similar  frequencies.  In  the  efficacy  and  safety  study,  no 
relevant differences were noted in the incidence of adverse events, including hypoglycaemic events.  
The phase 3 study mainly serves to assess immunogenicity. No increase in the incidence and level of 
anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was observed in each treatment group of the phase 3 study. Injection site 
reactions  and  potential  hypersensitivity  reactions  also  gave  no  hint  for  increased  immunogenicity  of 
Semglee compared to Lantus. There were no hints for neutralising antibodies.

3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Considering the totality of data from the comparability exercise, biosimilarity of Semglee to the 
comparator Lantus was shown. No risks of Semglee beyond the known effects of insulin glargine were 
detected. 
In line with the biosimilar insulin guideline, extrapolation to intravenous use and all indications and age 
groups of the reference medicinal product is acceptable. 
3.6.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Although PD similarity was not formally shown, the Applicant provided sound argument that convincing 
overall evidence for biosimilarity, particularly based on analytical and functional data, has been shown

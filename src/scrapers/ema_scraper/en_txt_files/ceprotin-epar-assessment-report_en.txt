Opinion 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Congenital protein C deficiency is an inherited thrombotic disease. Approximately 95% of affected 
individuals have heterozygous protein C deficiency, which is associated with thrombosis in adults. The 
rest has severe congenital protein C deficiency (SCPCD), which is caused by a homozygous genetic defect 
and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Double (compound) heterozygous defects, where the 
patient has a separate defect on each of the alleles of the protein C gene (PROC), inherited from each 
parent independently, can also result in SCPCD with symptoms indistinguishable from homozygous 
protein C deficiency. The PROC genotype is identified by a genetic analysis (Alhenc Gelas et al. 2020; 
Dreyfus et al. 1995). SCPCD (homozygous or compound heterozygous forms) is extremely rare (1 in 500 
000 to 1 in 750 000 births), but partial deficiencies (heterozygous forms) are much more frequent (1 in 
200 to 1 in 500) (Dinarvand and Moser 2019; Mathias et al. 2004). 
In addition, SCPCD is characterised by either a reduced level of circulating protein (type I), or less 
frequently (10-15% of cases), by (approximately) normal antigen level but decreased activity (type II) 
(Alhenc Gelas et al. 2020). 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The MAH is submitting this application to extend the current indication which included different conditions 
(e.g. surgery) for short-term prophylaxis to the full label of prophylaxis in patients with severe congenital 
protein C deficiency, namely: “CEPROTIN is indicated for prophylaxis and treatment of purpura fulminans 
and coumarin-induced skin necrosis in patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency.”

Epidemiology  
Patients with severe hereditary disease often present shortly after birth with PF, congenital blindness, and 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [Marlar A et al, J Pediatr 1989; 114:528-534, Hattenbach 
LO et al Ophthalmic manifestations of congenital protein C deficiency. J AAPOS 1999; 3(3):188–190]. The 
predicted prevalence of severe PC deficiency is 1 in 25,000- 40,000 individuals [Chalmers E et al Purpura 
fulminans: recognition, diagnosis and management. Arch Dis Child. 2011, Nov;96(11):1066-71]. 
However, only 20 patients with severe PC deficiencies within North America and the UK have been 
reported in the literature [Goldenberg NA et al, Haemophilia 2008; 14(6):1214-1221.2,9, Chalmers E et 
al Purpura fulminans: recognition, diagnosis and management. Arch Dis Child. 2011, Nov;96(11):1066-
71.]. This disparity between the observed and reported prevalence of severe congenital disease may be a 
result of underreporting and a high rate of perinatal mortality prior to diagnosis [Tait RC et al. Prevalence 
of protein C deficiency in the healthy population. Thromb Haemost 1995; 73(1):87-93.Preston FE et al. 
Increased fetal loss in women with heritable thrombophilia. Lancet 1996; 348(9032):913-916., Greer IA. 
Inherited thrombophilia and venous thromboembolism. Best Pract Res Clin Obstet, Gynaecol 2003; 
17(3):413-25]. 
According to registry data from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, an estimated 
2.25/million people have SCPCD worldwide. Within the UK, 11 cases of SCPCD have been reported. Based 
on a carrier prevalence estimate of 0.3%, 135 cases of SCPCD would be expected indicating that SCPCD 
may be underdiagnosed [Othman M,et al, Thrombosis and hemostasis health in pregnancy: Registries 
from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Res Pract Thromb Haemost. 2019 Aug 
1;3(4):607-614.14]. 
There are three forms of PF, including acute infectious, neonatal, and idiopathic PF, and each form has 
different prevalence. Acute infectious PF is the most common form of the disease. The prevalence of this 
form was estimated to be 10-20% of patients who develop meningococcal septicemia, where the 
estimated incidence of meningococcal disease was 1 case per 100,000 people per year [Patel J. 
Recognition and Management of Acute Purpura Fulminans: A Case Report of a Complication of Neisseria 
meningitidis Bacteremia. Cureus. 2021 Mar 4;13(3):e1370458,59]. 
The estimated prevalence of hereditary neonatal PF related to severe PC deficiency was about 1 in 
1,000,000 live births worldwide [Perera TB, Murphy-Lavoie HM. Purpura Fulminans. 2021 Jul 21. In: 
StatPearls [Internet], Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing; 2022 Jan–. Kim MC]. 
Coumarin induced skin necrosis (CISN) is a rare complication of oral anticoagulation with an estimated 
prevalence of 0.01% to 0.1% in patients receiving coumarin derivatives [Pabinger I et al. Coumarin 
induced acral skin necrosis associated with hereditary protein C deficiency. Blut 1986;52(6):365-370, 
Becker CG. Oral anticoagulant therapy and skin necrosis: Speculations on pathogenesis. Adv Exp Med Biol 
1987; 214:217-22277,78, Warkentin TE. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a ten-year retrospective. 
Ann Rev Med 1999; 50(1):129-147] 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The level of protein C activity is 65-135% in healthy adults and 30-40% at birth. Protein C concentration 
remains slightly low through childhood and achieves the adult range after puberty. For heterozygous 
protein C deficiency, the level of protein C activity is 30-50% in adults, and 30% or lower in newborns. 
Furthermore, for homozygous or double heterozygous protein C deficiency, the level of protein C activity 
is extremely low (less than 1%) (Goldenberg and Manco-Johnson 2008; Tcheng et al. 2008). 
Patients with homozygous or double heterozygous protein C deficiency, typically present with clinical 
manifestations within the first few hours or days of life. Severe fetal protein C deficiency may also result

in miscarriage or intrauterine thromboses. Since the microcirculation is the major site of function of the 
protein C pathway, the consequences of severe protein C deficiency typically first become manifest in the 
capillaries of the skin, then progress to the vessels of the eyes (leading to vitreous hemorrhage and 
retinal detachment), brain and kidneys. Blindness, which is permanent, is believed to occur in utero 
during the third trimester period or soon after birth (Barnes et al. 2002; Sirachainan et al. 2003). The 
clinical signs of PF are the result of capillary thrombosis with secondary bleeding and consist of 
ecchymotic skin lesions that, if untreated, rapidly develop into hemorrhagic bullae (Abu-Amero et al. 
2003). The gangrenous necrosis symptoms appear mainly on the extremities, but also on the buttocks, 
abdomen, scrotum, and scalp, and may necessitate amputation. In addition, multi-organ failure may also 
occur by thromboembolic disease with severe disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). If the 
condition is left untreated, the progression of the thrombotic lesions results in blindness, severe brain 
damage, multi-organ failure and death (Civantos et al. 1987; Marciniak et al. 1985; Pegelow et al. 1988; 
Pulido et al. 1987; Seligsohn et al. 1984; Tarras et al. 1988). After the newborn period, venous 
thromboembolism such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism and cerebral sinus 
thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis and arterial thrombosis such as cerebral infarction, has 
been reported in childhood and adults. 
Management 
CEPROTIN is currently the only treatment option available to substitute protein C in severe congenital PC 
deficiency (Dreyfus et al. 1995). Prior to licensure of CEPROTIN, other therapeutic options for the 
treatment of congenital PC deficiency included the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), low-molecular weight 
heparin (LMWH), and liver transplantation (Loop et al. 2004; Pescatore 2001). 
In the late eighties, only FFP and long-term treatment either with vitamin K antagonists or with FFP 
and/or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) were available for the treatment of severe PC 
deficiency. However, these treatments have several disadvantages (Kroiss and Albisetti 2010). Since 
protein C is a trace protein with a concentration of 4 µg/mL, the volume of FFP required to raise protein C 
to normal levels can lead to fluid overload, especially in children, with the risk of pulmonary edema, 
hypertension, hyperproteinemia, or proteinuria (Auberger et al. 1990; Auletta and Headington 1988; 
Casella et al. 1988; Civantos et al. 1987; Garcia-Plaza et al. 1985; Hartman et al. 1989 and 1990; Hintz 
et al. 1987; Majer et al. 1989; Marlar et al. 1989 and 1992; Pegelow et al. 1988; Pulido et al. 1987; Sills 
et al. 1984; Tarras et al. 1988; Vukovich et al. 1988). One case has been reported where a teenage 
patient developed severe allergic reactions to FFP. Furthermore, FFP carries the risk of transmitting blood-
borne viruses (Manco-Johnson and Nuss 1992; Marlar et al. 1992). Nonetheless, FFP would be considered 
the standard of care if PC replacement therapy were not available (Sirachainan et al. 2003). Due to the 
presence of the coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, replacement therapy with PCCs may further 
increase the risk of thrombotic complications in these patients, who are already prone to thrombosis. 
The prophylaxis of thromboembolic complications due to severe PC deficiency has been attempted using 
different approaches than for general PC replacement. Oral anticoagulation with coumarin derivatives, 
such as warfarin, may be used to decrease coagulation activity. However, during the initial phase of oral 
anticoagulation the activity of protein C is more rapidly suppressed than that of the procoagulant factors 
(II, VII, IX and X), which may result in a recurrence of symptoms as well as bleeding complications 
(especially in neonates and young children, where consistent International Normalized Ratio [INR] levels 
are difficult to achieve). Such complications have been observed in patients with severe congenital PC 
deficiency who were treated with oral anticoagulants (Abu-Amero et al. 2003; Auberger et al. 1990; 
Branson et al. 1983; Gatti et al. 2003; Hartman et al. 1989; Hartman et al. 1990; Manco-Johnson and 
Nuss 1992; Pegelow et al. 1988; Pulido et al. 1987; Tarras et al. 1988; Yuen et al. 1986). Moreover, 
Assessment report  
EMA/913542/2022 
Page 8/51 
 
 
 
 
there is concern about the long-term effect of coumarin derivatives on bone matrix protein in growing 
children (Barnes et al. 2002; Dreyfus et al. 1995; Menon et al. 1987). 
Heparin, though not successful when given alone, may be a useful adjunct to PC replacement therapy 
(Loop et al. 2004; Majer et al. 1989; Marciniak et al. 1985; Marlar et al. 1992; Rappaport et al. 1987; 
Sills et al. 1984). However, there is a risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and risk of 
osteoporosis with long-term use, especially in children (Gatti et al. 2003; Massicotte 2000). 
Successful prophylactic use of LMWH was reported in a child who presented with a deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT) and a measurable PC activity of 7% (Monagle et al. 1998). A further successful treatment with 
LMWH was reported in a patient with myeloid/natural killer cell precursor acute leukemia who was also 
homozygous for PC deficiency (Shimamoto et al. 2003). Although the disadvantages of long-term use of 
LMWH in children have not yet been thoroughly evaluated, the incidence of HIT and osteoporosis seems 
to be less with LMWH than with coumarin or heparin (Dix et al. 2000; Massicotte 2000; Streif et al. 
1999).  
Liver transplantation has been performed in a small number of pediatric patients with congenital PC 
deficiency as an alternative to PC replacement therapy (Kroiss and Albisetti 2010). Although liver 
transplantation was curative for severe congenital PC deficiency in a few cases, it necessitates lifelong 
immunosuppression and is associated with a potential risk of autoantibody formation against protein C 
produced by the transplanted organ, due to polymorphism (Casella et al. 1988). 
Severe congenital PC deficiency being a lifelong condition, long-term prophylaxis with CEPROTIN could 
prevent thromboembolic complications and overcome the drawbacks of alternative treatment options.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
CEPROTIN is a human, plasma-derived, monoclonal-purified concentrate of protein C. 
CEPROTIN 500 IU is prepared as a powder containing nominally 500 IU human protein C per container. 
CEPROTIN 1000 IU is prepared as a powder containing nominally 1000 IU human protein C per container. 
The product is reconstituted with Sterilised Water for Injections and contains approximately 100 IU/ml 
human protein C. The currently recommended initial dose of CEPROTIN in the EU is 60 to 80 IU/kg 
considering the recovery and half-life of the product in the patient. 
The product is also licensed in the USA with a recommended initial dosing of 100 to 120 IU/kg 
bodyweight and with 45-60 IU/kg bodyweight every 12 hours for LTP. 
Pharmacological classification and Mode of action 
Protein C, a vitamin K-dependent zymogen, is converted by the thrombin/thrombomodulin-complex and 
on the endothelial cell surface to activated protein C (APC), enhanced by the endothelial protein C 
receptor (EPCR). In the presence of its cofactor protein S (another vitamin K-dependent protein), APC 
exerts antithrombotic effect by limited proteolysis of the activated forms of factor V (Va) into Vi and 
factor VIII (VIIIa) into VIIIi, thus leading to a decrease in thrombin formation, which is known as 
coagulation promoting factor.  
In addition, APC displays indirect fibrinolytic properties by binding to plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 
(PAI-1), resulting in an increase in the activity of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Furthermore, 
because of reduced thrombin generation resulting from inactivation of factors Va and VIIIa, the activation 
of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is reduced, thus resulting in increased profibrinolytic 
activity. Protein C also exhibits cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Biologic roles of protein 
C are shown in Figure 1.

Current wording for the indication and posology 
In the EU, CEPROTIN is indicated in purpura fulminans and coumarin-induced skin necrosis in patients 
with SCPCD. Furthermore, CEPROTIN is indicated for short-term prophylaxis in patients with SCPCD if one 
or more of the following conditions are met: 
surgery or invasive therapy is imminent 
• 
•  while initiating coumarin therapy 
•  when coumarin therapy alone is not sufficient 
•  when coumarin therapy is not feasible 
The recommended dosing is based on laboratory assessment for each individual case starting with an 
initial dose of 60 to 80 IU/kg for determination of recovery and half-life. It is recommended to achieve an 
initial protein C activity of 100% which should be maintained above 25% for the duration of the 
treatment. 
In the case of an acute thrombotic event laboratory measurements should be performed every 6 hours 
until the patient is stabilised, thereafter twice a day and always immediately before the next injection. It 
should be kept in mind that the half-life of protein C may be severely shortened in certain clinical 
conditions such as acute thrombosis with purpura fulminans and skin necrosis (see SmPC). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH is providing an analysis of patients with SCPCD who received long-term prophylactic treatment. 
Re-analysis of the pivotal study 400101 was performed to address the CHMP position stated in the 
Scientific Advice letter (EMA/SA/0000050543) and to strengthen the position of LTP in patients with 
SCPCD. The proposed labeling and the supportive clinical data were presented on 07 December 2021 to 
the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (CHMP Rapporteur of CEPROTIN) in a Scientific Advice meeting.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
All treatments reported in the RDC (IMAG-039, IMAG-041 and compassionate use) were conducted in 
accordance with the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki and the national requirements in the 
participating countries; however, they were not always conducted in full compliance with the standards of 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Treatment with Protein C Concentrate, which was considered lifesaving, 
often took priority over meeting GCP standards and complying with the study protocols. 
Studies IMAG 098, 400101, 400501, and 400701 were performed in full compliance with GCP standards 
and with the national requirements of the participating countries. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
This application for a Type II variation to modify the approved therapeutic indication to include long-term 
prophylaxis in the labeling may result in a significant increase in use; therefore, the MAH is providing an 
evaluation of environmental impact as per the guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of Human protein C.  
Considering the above data, Human protein C is not expected to pose a risk to the environment as 
CEPROTIN contains a naturally occurring human protein as the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and that 
this product is isolated from human blood/plasma, the medicinal product is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. Thus, further studies evaluating the environmental impact of CEPROTIN are not 
necessary.

found to be approximately 10 hours. This is supported by findings in the literature (Auberger 1992; 
Dreyfus et al. 1991; Dreyfus et al. 1995; Hertfelder et al. 2002). 
However, the presence of acute symptoms, such as PF, DIC and acute thrombosis, can alter the PK 
parameters of CEPROTIN, e.g., by accelerating its consumption, reducing its in vivo recovery (IVR) and 
decreasing its half-life. Patients treated during the acute phase of their disease may display much lower 
increases in PC activity. Half-life values as short as 2 hours have been reported in the literature (Dreyfus 
et al. 1995). Therefore, coagulation parameters should be checked regularly due to the wide variation in 
individual responses to the effects of CEPROTIN. 
With regard to the PK of CEPROTIN in children, analyses of PK data showed that there is a difference in 
distribution, metabolism and elimination of CEPROTIN between children and adults. The half-life is shorter 
and clearance of protein C is faster in younger than in older subjects. This fact must be considered when 
a dosing regimen for children is determined. Neonates and very young children may require higher doses 
than adults.

2.4.1.  Main study 
Study 400101, A Phase 2/3 Clinical Study for the Determination of the 
Efficacy and Safety of Protein C Concentrate in Subjects with Severe 
Congenital Protein C Deficiency 
Study design and methods 
This was a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, 3-part study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
Protein C Concentrate in subjects with severe congenital protein C deficiency at 13 study sites in the 
United States. 
Part 1 of the study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Protein C Concentrate in the on-demand 
treatment of acute thrombotic episodes, such as PF, CISN, and vascular thrombosis. In subjects 
presenting with skin lesions, the severity of skin lesions was assessed during screening. In subjects 
presenting with vascular thrombosis, imaging was used to identify the location and extent of the 
thrombus. The efficacy of treatment for each episode in Part 1 was rated based on a 4-point scale 
(excellent, good, fair, and not effective). D-dimers were monitored to determine the resolution of 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in subjects with PF or CISN. 
Part 2 of the study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Protein C Concentrate in the short-term 
prophylaxis of acute thrombotic episodes during surgery, during the postpartum period and for initiation 
of oral or parenteral anticoagulation therapy. In addition, subjects could enter Part 2 at the discretion of 
the investigator during transition from parenteral to oral anticoagulant therapy or from oral to parenteral 
anticoagulant therapy. Subjects who received short-term prophylaxis with Protein C Concentrate for 
thrombotic complications were evaluated descriptively. 
Part 3 of the study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Protein C Concentrate for long-
term prophylactic treatment of acute thrombotic episodes. Originally, subjects were eligible for this part 
of the study if they: (a) had been treated in Part 1 of this study at least 3 times due to failure of oral or 
parenteral anticoagulant therapy despite compliance with their prescribed regimen; (b) had a 
documented contraindication for anticoagulation therapy; or (c) were on long-term prophylaxis treatment 
with Protein C Concentrate in another study or under emergency use provisions prior to study entry. 
Originally there was also no time limit for participation in Part 3. Amendment 1 to the Protocol, dated 
June 21, 2004, stipulated that only subjects less than 6 months of age were permitted to enroll in Part 3, 
and that the duration of prophylaxis with Protein C Concentrate was limited to a total of 6 months. 
Study participants 
•  Newborn subjects ≤6 months of age: diagnosis of severe congenital protein C deficiency, with 
documented functional protein C level of <20%. If a genetic diagnosis was not available prior to 
initiation of Protein C Concentrate treatment, a documented family history of protein C deficiency was 
required. 
•  Subjects >6 months of age: confirmed diagnosis of severe congenital protein C deficiency, i.e., by: 
o  a genetic analysis of severe congenital protein C deficiency (i.e., homozygous or double 
heterozygous) OR 
Assessment report  
EMA/913542/2022 
Page 15/51 
 
 
 
 
o  a documented family history of protein C deficiency AND a documented functional protein C 
level <20% while the subject was in an asymptomatic state and not receiving oral 
anticoagulation therapy. 
Additional Inclusion Criteria for Part 1 
•  Diagnosis of PF (characteristic cutaneous purpuric lesions involving erythema, induration, and pain) 
or CISN, and/or 
•  Diagnosis of acute thromboembolic episode including the determination of thrombus location. 
Additional Inclusion Criteria for Part 2 
•  Subjects requiring treatment with Protein C Concentrate for short-term prophylaxis for surgical 
procedures, during the postpartum period, or for initiation of oral or parenteral anticoagulation 
therapy. 
•  Subjects had to be in an asymptomatic state prior to treatment as defined by the absence of any 
signs/symptoms of thrombosis (e.g. PF, CISN, or thromboembolic event). 
Additional Inclusion Criteria for Part 3 
• 
Infants <6 months of age 
•  Subject had to be in an asymptomatic state prior to treatment in Part 3 as defined by the absence of 
any signs/symptoms of thrombosis (e.g. PF, CISN, thromboembolic disease or clinical evidence of 
DIC). 
Treatments 
Treatment in Part 1: 
Upon presentation with an acute event, the subject was to be infused with Protein C Concentrate at a 
dose of 120 IU/kg body weight (BW). This initial infusion was to be followed by 3 infusions of 60 IU/kg 
BW at an interval of every 6h. Doses for all subsequent infusions were to be based on the peak protein C 
level after the first dose (15±5 minutes after infusion) and were to be given once every 6h. Treatment 
was to continue until complete resolution of all non-necrotic lesions, healing of necrotic lesions and/or 
stabilization of thrombi. 
Treatment in Part 2: 
Surgery  
For elective surgery (non-emergency), Protein C Concentrate treatment was to be initiated at 120 IU/kg 
BW once daily until anticoagulation was successfully discontinued prior to surgery. For emergency 
surgery, one dose of 100 IU/kg BW was to be given during the anticoagulation reversal period prior to 
surgery.  
A dose of 60 IU/kg BW was to be administered 15 minutes before surgery and once every 6h for the first 
24h after the start of surgery. The frequency of infusions was to be reduced to 3 times daily between 24 
and 48h, and twice daily from 48h until anticoagulation was initiated (if applicable) and adequate levels 
were reached. Subsequently, Protein C Concentrate was to be administered once daily at the same dose 
for an additional 48h before it was discontinued. 
Assessment report  
EMA/913542/2022 
Page 16/51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Initiation of Anticoagulant Therapy (oral or parenteral) 
A dose of 60 IU/kg BW was to be administered upon initiation of anticoagulation, every 6h for the first 
24h, and reduced to 3 times daily between 24 and 48h. Infusions were to continue twice daily until 48h 
after adequate anticoagulation had been achieved (as specified in the study protocol), and once daily for 
an additional 48h thereafter before it was discontinued. 
Short-term Prophylaxis during the Postpartum Period 
The initial dose of 80 IU/kg BW was to be administered within 1 hour (h) after delivery. A dose of 60 
IU/kg BW was to be administered once every 6h for 4 additional doses (until 24h after delivery), reduced 
to 3 times daily between 24 and 48h, twice daily from 48h until anticoagulation was initiated and 
adequate levels were reached, and once daily for an additional 48h thereafter. 
Treatment in Part 3:  
The dosing regimen was to be established by the investigator based on the subject’s prior clinical data 
including any pharmacokinetic information, with the objective of preventing the trough (pre-infusion) 
levels from falling below 25% (or 10% for subjects on long-term anticoagulant treatment). The first 3 
doses had to be administered at the clinic/hospital. Pre- and 15 minute post-infusion levels were to be 
determined for all 3 doses, and the dose or frequency of infusions could be adjusted. Once a stable 
dosing regimen had been established, this was to be applied during home treatment for a maximum of 6 
months (as instituted by Amendment 1 of the study protocol). The pre- and post-infusion levels were to 
be measured at least once every 2 months (±2 weeks) to determine the adequacy of dosing.  
If a subject experienced a thrombotic episode during long-term prophylactic treatment or required 
surgery, the subject was to be admitted to hospital and treated under the provisions of Part 1 or Part 2 of 
the study until complete resolution of all thrombotic symptoms and DIC. 
Objectives 
The objective of this study was to demonstrate that Protein C Concentrate is safe and effective in subjects 
with congenital protein C deficiency in the following indications: 1) for the treatment of acute thrombotic 
episodes, such as PF, CISN and other vascular thromboembolic events; 2) for short-term thromboembolic 
prophylaxis during surgical procedures, the postpartum period and the initiation of oral or parenteral 
anticoagulation; and 3) for long-term prophylactic treatment of acute thrombotic episodes. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
Whether episodes of PF, CISN and/or other thromboembolic events were able to be treated effectively, 
effectively with complications, or not treated effectively. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
1.  Percentage of episodes of PF and thrombotic events in which the efficacy of treatment was rated as 
excellent, good, fair or none according to a predefined scale (Part 1). 
2.  Mean and median percent change, from baseline (at presentation) in the number and size of skin 
lesions of acute episodes of PF treated with Protein C Concentrate at treatment Days 0 6, 14, 28 and

12. Tabulation of AEs according to seriousness, severity, causality and outcome; number of AEs per 
subject related to product use that resulted in discontinuation or interruption of treatment (Parts 1, 2 
and 3). 
13. Pharmacokinetic parameters of protein C in asymptomatic subjects (AUC, terminal half-life, volume of 
distribution, mean residence time [MRT]) (Parts 1, 2 and 3). 
Sample size 
Due to the small number of subjects with this disorder, no minimum sample size was specified for this 
study. The expected number of subjects to be enrolled was approximately 15 to 20 over 2 years. Part 1 
was expected to treat 15 to 30 acute thromboembolic events. Part 2 was expected to involve 5 to 10 
subjects with severe congenital Protein C deficiency. The sample size for Part 3 was expected to be very 
small.

Randomisation 
It was planned not to randomize study subjects. 
Blinding (masking) 
The trial was uncontrolled and hence unblinded.  
Statistical methods 
The MAH set out to estimate the likelihood of the observed configuration under the assumption that there 
is no difference between the two modalities (On Demand (OD) and Prophylaxis) in the rates of these 
events. The calculated probability of the observed configuration indicates that it is highly unlikely to have 
occurred if there was no difference between OD and Prophylaxis. 
Primary and secondary endpoints for Study Part 3 
Subjects in the prospective study were planned to be treated for episodes of purpura fulminans, 
Coumarin-induced skin necrosis and/or other vascular thromboembolic events. Treatment of these 
episodes and of episodes in the historical control (see Section 14.0 in version 2 of the protocol, dated 
April 1, 2003) were planned be evaluated as effective, effective with complications, and not effective for 
skin lesions and other vascular thromboembolic events separately. The treatment of 1 episode (treatment 
course) was planned to may be comprised of 1 or more treatment modalities. The following definitions 
were planned to apply (skin lesions/other vascular thromboembolic events): 
Individual treatment modality (drug/drug combination, dose, frequency): 
1. Effective: stabilization and regression of skin lesions/stabilization of thrombi 
2. Effective with complications: effective treatment caused an adverse drug reaction interfering with the 
treatment regimen (resulted in change of dose or frequency of dosing) or forcing discontinuation of 
treatment or introducing pathogenic viral infection 
3. Not effective: All other 
Treatment course (sequence of treatment modalities): 
1. Not effective: The final treatment modality was ineffective and/or the subject was not discharged on a 
stable anticoagulation regimen 
2. Effective with complications: The final treatment modality was effective (possibly with complications) 
and the subject was discharged on a stable anticoagulation regimen, but 1 or more of the treatment 
modalities were effective with complications. 
3. Effective: The final treatment modality was effective and the subject was discharged on a stable 
anticoagulation regimen. Ineffective treatment modalities are disregarded, because in the historical 
control they may have been applied before the proper diagnosis of Protein C deficiency was available 
(e.g. antibiotics for presumed sepsis). 
Episodes of purpura fulminans or thrombotic events, which receive treatment that is not specified in the 
study protocol, will nevertheless be rated according to the primary efficacy endpoint. Analysis of efficacy 
both including and excluding these episodes will be conducted. 
Assessment report  
EMA/913542/2022 
Page 19/51 
 
 
 
 
The secondary endpoint addressed by Study Part 3 was planned to be: The number of episodes of 
purpura fulminans and/or thrombotic episodes while receiving long-term Protein C Concentrate 
prophylaxis. 
Analysis of the Primary Endpoint 
The comparison to historical controls was planned to be separate for skin lesions and other vascular 
thromboembolic events and was planned to be performed in a hierarchical testing design. First, 
effectiveness regarding skin lesions was planned to be compared in those episodes where subjects 
presented with purpura fulminans and/or Coumarin-induced skin necrosis. Only if this comparison would 
not be statistically significant, a second comparison regarding other vascular thromboembolic events was 
planned to be performed using the episodes with these symptoms. In this manner, no adjustment of the 
type I error was planned to be necessary, because a type I error can only occur in 1 of the 2 comparisons 
while all treated episodes are accounted for in the analysis of the primary endpoint. 
The overall type I error would not be controlled across the analyses of the two endpoints following the 
approach described in the protocol and the study report. However, the null hypothesis corresponding to 
the comparison of skin lesions could be formally rejected and thus according to a hierarchical testing 
approach one could proceed to testing other vascular thromboembolic events (at full level alpha) while 
controlling the overall type I error rate. 
The null hypothesis of no difference between the episodes of purpura fulminans, Coumarin-induced skin 
necrosis, and/or other vascular thromboembolic events in the prospective study and the historical 
controls was planned to be tested at the 5% level of overall statistical significance against a 2-sided 
alternative. Both individual hypothesis tests were planned to use the 5% level of significance, because the 
second test was planned to only be performed, if the first was not significant. 
The evaluation of treatment (effective, effective with complications, and not effective) for skin 
lesions/other vascular thromboembolic events was planned to be analysed as ordered categorical data 
using the exact Wilcoxon rank sum test as implemented in StatXact 534 or SAS version 8.235. Exact mid-
p values were planned to be reported to avoid conservativeness due to the discrete distributions. 
Acute thrombotic episodes treated with FFP prior to treatment with Protein C Concentrate were planned to 
be reported, but not included for this formal comparison. These would have been treatments for subjects 
newly diagnosed at a center that has not been qualified for participation at the time of presentation of a 
new subject with an initial acute thrombotic episode. 
Since more than 1 episode per subject were planned to be evaluated, a supplemental analysis was 
planned to consider subjects’first episodes only. 
Multiplicity 
A hierarchical testing design was planned to be used to avoid multiple testing. Skin lesions as the lead 
symptom of the disease were planned to be compared in a first statistical hypothesis test and other 
vascular thromboembolic events were planned to be analysed only if the first test was not significant.

Part 1: Treatment of Acute Episodes of PF/CISN or Thromboembolic Events 
A total of 24 episodes of PF/CISN or vascular thrombotic events in 11 subjects were treated with 
CEPROTIN in Part 1. 
For the primary efficacy analysis, the treatment of episodes of PF/CISN and/or other vascular 
thromboembolic events was rated as effective, effective with complications, or not effective according to 
the primary efficacy rating scale. The primary efficacy ratings in this study were compared to those in an 
historical control group who were treated with conventional treatments other than CEPROTIN (e.g., FFP). 
Of 19 episodes of PF/CISN (7 severe, 11 moderate, 1 mild) treated with CEPROTIN, 18 (94.7%) were 
rated as effective, and 1 (5.3%) was rated as effective with complications; none of the PF/CISN episodes 
treated with CEPROTIN was rated as not effective. When compared with the efficacy ratings for 23 
episodes of PF/CISN treated with conventional therapy (historical control group), the analysis showed 
that subjects with severe congenital PC deficiency were more effectively treated with CEPROTIN than with

other treatment modalities such as FFP or conventional anticoagulants (p=0.0032) (CSR 400101, Section 
11.4.1.1). 
In a secondary efficacy rating, 13 (68.4%) of 19 episodes of PF/CISN treated with CEPROTIN were rated 
as excellent, 4 (21.1%) were rated as good, and 2 (10.5%) episodes of severe PF/CISN were rated as 
fair; all were rated as effective. Four (80%) of 5 episodes of venous thrombosis had treatment ratings of 
excellent, while 1 (20%) was rated as good. When the secondary treatment ratings were combined for all 
24 PF/CISN episodes and thrombotic events, 70.8% of the treatment episodes were rated as excellent, 
20.8% were rated as good, and 8.3% were rated as fair. These results support the findings of the 
primary efficacy analysis (CSR 400101, Table 14.2.1-4). 
CEPROTIN also proved effective in reducing the size and number of skin lesions. As expected, the change 
in size and number of necrotic lesions after treatment with CEPROTIN was slower than for non-necrotic 
lesions. While non-necrotic skin lesions healed over a 12-day period, necrotic skin lesions healed over a 
52-day period of CEPROTIN treatment (CSR 400101, Section 11.4.1.2.2). 
Part 2: Short-Term Prophylaxis 
Three subjects entered Part 2 of the study for a total of 7 times for short-term prophylaxis treatment with 
study product. All 3 subjects entered Part 2 for initiation of anticoagulation therapy, and 2 of the subjects 
entered Part 2 also for surgical procedures. All 7 of the short-term prophylaxis treatments were free of 
complications of PF/CISN or thromboembolic events (CSR 400101, Table 14.2.2-6). 
Part 3: Long-Term Prophylaxis 
Eight subjects entered Study 400101 Part 3 for long-term prophylactic treatment with study product. The 
mean number of exposure days to on-site infusions was 14.1 (median 7.5), the mean number of 
exposure days to home infusions was 192.6 (median 183.0). The total mean volume administered was 
182.9 mL (median 97.8 mL) for on-site infusions and 2,648.1 mL (median 3,000.6 mL) for home 
infusions. 
Of the 8 subjects who entered Part 3 for a total of 10 times for long-term prophylactic treatment with 
CEPROTIN, 4 subjects actually received long-term prophylactic treatment in Part 3, and also received on-
demand treatment at different times during the study. The number of days on long-term prophylactic 
treatment in these 4 subjects ranged from 42 to 338. No episodes of PF/CISN occurred in these subjects 
during the total of 915 days of prophylactic treatment with CEPROTIN. However, the same 4 subjects 
experienced 13 episodes of PF/CISN during 660 days while they were on on-demand treatment and did 
not receive product (Table 4).

The number of episodes of PF/CISN and/or vascular thromboembolic events that occurred in all subjects 
in the study, whether they were treated on-demand or receiving long-term prophylactic treatment under 
Part 3 is summarized in Table 5. Three subjects were on-demand for the entire duration of the study. The 
total number of episodes of PF/CISN or vascular thromboembolic events that occurred during 1634 days 
of prophylaxis treatment for all subjects was zero. In comparison, a total of 31 episodes of PF/CISN or 
thrombosis were observed in 3687 days of not receiving study product while subjects were receiving 
treatment on-demand. Thus, the median rate of episodes during on-demand treatment was 0.24 per 
month (or approximately 3 episodes per year). The number of episodes that occurred while subjects were 
receiving treatment on-demand ranged from 0 to 6, including the additional episodes that were not 
treated with study product). Monthly rates of episodes of PF/CISN or vascular thromboembolic events 
while subjects were on-demand ranged from 0 to 6.4, with a median rate of 0.24 episodes per month and 
a 95% confidence interval for the median ranging from 0 to 0.57 episodes per month.

Study 400101 Post-hoc Randomization Test for Null Hypothesis of Same Frequency 
The 18 subjects shown in Table 4 were analysed in a post-hoc randomization test of the null hypothesis of 
the same frequency while treated on demand versus prophylactically against the alternative hypothesis of 
a higher frequency during on-demand treatment. The estimated one-sided p-value for the randomization 
test is 7.5E-9 < 0.001, should indicate that there is a strong evidence based on the observed data against 
the null hypothesis that the frequency of PF/CISN and/or thrombosis is the same between on-demand 
and prophylaxis treatments, and thus in favour of a lower frequency on prophylaxis (Table 6).

Long-Term Impairment  
No major changes in long-term impairment were observed in terms of visual impairments and 
amputations for subjects treated with study product. One subject shifted from abnormal neurological 
status at baseline to improved status at end of study. These results show that deterioration in long-term 
impairment status did not occur while subjects were treated with CEPROTIN.

Retrospective data 
The RDC (retrospective data collection) of studies IMAG-039 and IMAG-041, and compassionate use was 
based on the procedures of study IMAG-039 and was designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of 
the use of CEPROTIN from October 1989 to July 1999 in the US, Canada, and Europe. The investigational 
centres that had used CEPROTIN for IMAG-039, IMAG-041 and under compassionate use provisions, were 
contacted and consent for monitoring of the data was obtained from the subjects. Monitoring was 
subsequently conducted in these centres by collecting and verifying information against the source 
documentation in the medical records of the subjects. Complete data could not be collected for all 
subjects since the data spanned a period of almost 10 years (i.e., 1989-1999) and included 
compassionate use data for which the recording and monitoring requirements were not as rigorous. 
However, the data of 79 subjects (22 with severe congenital PC deficiency and 57 with simple 
heterozygous, acquired, other or unknown PC deficiency) were compiled and analysed. 
Outcome of long-term prophylactic treatment  
Nine subjects, of which 8 were homozygous and 1 was double heterozygous, received long-term 
prophylactic treatment for a period of up to 8 years. The efficacy of CEPROTIN was rated excellent in 7 
subjects. The remaining 2 subjects were not evaluated by the investigator (Table 8). Home treatment 
was established for 6 subjects. Three subjects  who received long-term prophylaxis under compassionate 
use provisions initially received the product by IV infusion, but were later switched to subcutaneous 
infusion following independent decisions made by the investigators (Table 9).

a Method I refers to Protein C Concentrate manufactured prior to 1992. Method II refers to CEPROTIN (Protein C 
Concentrate) manufactured according to the method used since 1992. In 1992, the manufacturing process was 
modified to include a second viral inactivation step as well as other changes in the chromatography purification steps. 
Key differences between the current and previous methods (Method I and Method II) are summarized in Table 2 of the 
Summary of Biopharmaceutic Studies (Module 2.7.1).  
b Ongoing at the time of the clinical study report. The date of the report is 16 November 2000. 
Narratives of the 9 subjects who received long-term prophylaxis are available. 
In most cases, the selection and timing of the dose used for each individual subject was determined by 
the investigator on the basis of the clinical status of the subject rather than on the basis of protocol-
specified individual PK data. For treatment of acute thrombotic episodes, the dose, replacement frequency 
and the duration of treatment depended on the severity of PC deficiency as well as the location and 
extent of thrombosis. The determination of dose based on clinical status was necessary either because 
the frequent blood sampling required for individual PK data could not be achieved in many subjects 
(particularly in neonates and infants) or because the product was administered in a life-threatening 
situation. A number of investigators used doses of 100 IU per kg BW every 6 h during the acute phase of 
thrombosis. After the clinical symptoms regressed, the frequency of CEPROTIN administrations was 
generally reduced to once per day (CSR RDC, Section IV.10.2.2). 
Study 400501 
A total of 11 subjects (6 male and 5 female) were enrolled at 10 study sites in the US. All subjects had a 
diagnosis of severe congenital PC deficiency. Age ranged from 2.1 years to 23.8 years (CSR 400501, 
Table 16.2.4-1). No efficacy analyses were carried out in this study. Only subject data listings are 
available. 
Treatment Outcome 
There were 28 acute episodes reported, in which the time to resolution ranged from 0 to 46 days. The 
treatment outcome for these episodes was considered effective in all cases except one (PF/CISN and 
Assessment report  
EMA/913542/2022

vascular thrombus). Subjects developed PF/CISN when not being treated with CEPROTIN. Initiation of 
therapy with CEPROTIN resolved PF/CISN in all subjects. Some subjects developed PF/CISN while on 
anticoagulation therapy. However, these episodes were also resolved upon treatment with CEPROTIN 
(CSR 400501, Table 16.2.6-3, Table 16.2.6-5). 
Dosage Information  
For acute episodes, the doses varied from 75 to 4040 IU per administration and the weight-adjusted 
doses from 28.85 IU/kg BW to 186.77 IU/kg BW. For prophylactic episodes, the doses varied from 112 to 
4040 IU per administration and from 19.46 IU/kg BW to 291.67 IU/kg BW (CSR 400501, Table 16.2.5). 
A listing of additional anticoagulants, anti-platelets, and systemic thrombolytics given to 11 subjects 
during the entire treatment period with CEPROTIN is shown in CSR 400501, Table 16.2.10-1, Table 
16.2.10-2. Some subjects did not tolerate anticoagulant treatment and were maintained on prophylactic 
doses of CEPROTIN (Table 16.2.6-5, Table 16.2.6-6). 
Study 400701 CEPROTIN Treatment Registry 
Study design and methodology 
The study was designed as a prospective, international, multi-center, open-label, noninterventional, 
observational post-authorization registry under normal clinical care. Some retrospective, historical data 
were also collected. Participants were identified in collaboration with hemophilia treatment centers and 
thrombosis centers known to have subjects with severe congenital protein C deficiency, as well as with 
centers that used CEPROTIN in emergent care situations (for severe acquired protein C deficiency 
[SAPCD]). Being a non-interventional registry study, there were no required predefined visits, medical 
tests, laboratory tests and/or procedures or interventions during the registry’s duration. All data collected 
in this registry originate from patient medical records documenting routine patient care. Both new users 
and current (prevalent) users of CEPROTIN were included in the registry. 
The registry was conducted at participating centers in Austria, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the 
United Kingdom and the United States of America. 
Study participants 
Patients with congenital protein C deficiency as well as those with acquired protein C deficiency treated 
with CEPROTIN. 
Planned: There was no minimum pre-specified sample size.  
All 43 eligible subjects at 24 participating sites were enrolled and analyzed in the registry. 
Objective 
The overall objective was to collect and assess data in the real-world situation on the treatment, safety, 
and treatment outcomes of subjects prescribed, receiving, and participating in the CEPROTIN treatment 
registry. 
Primary Objectives included: 
1.  To identify medical diagnoses associated with subjects receiving CEPROTIN 
2.  To record CEPROTIN treatment regimens categorized by medical diagnosis 
Assessment report  
EMA/913542/2022 
Page 29/51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  To assess the safety of CEPROTIN based on incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs), related 
SAEs, and related non-serious adverse events (AEs) 
Secondary objectives of the study included: 
1.  To examine relationships between CEPROTIN treatment and treatment outcomes: evidence of halting 
or reversal of coagulopathy or thrombosis, endorgan damage (including brain, lung, liver, kidney and 
other relevant affected organs), limb sparing, length of hospital stay (LOS), and mortality 
2.  To record information on CEPROTIN use and treatment outcomes in: 
• 
Pregnancy, labor and delivery 
•  Surgery and invasive procedures 
•  Different age groups 
• 
Pre-existing renal and/or hepatic dysfunction 
Results 
Efficacy of CEPROTIN treatment was collected both retrospectively and prospectively.  
Patient characteristics 
Twenty-five subjects diagnosed with severe congenital PC deficiency were enrolled in the registry. 
Subjects were evenly distributed by gender (13 subjects [52.0%] were male and 12 [48.0%] were 
female). Nearly one-half (48%) of the subjects were children between the ages of 2 and 12 years. The 
median duration of participation was 39.7 months (range: 0.9 to 59.9 months) with a total of 80.9 
subject-years on-study at the time of the final analysis. Most subjects (19/25) received long-term 
prophylaxis. These subjects participated for a median of 40.2 months (range: 24.0-56.1 months) in the 
registry (mean ± SD: 40.2 ± 9.41 months).  
Subjects were diagnosed with severe congenital PC deficiency at a median age of 0.0 years (range: 0.0 to 
19.9 years) and entered the study at a median age of 11.1 years (range: 1.3 to 43.7 years) (CSR 400701 
Table 12.1 and Table 2.1). Associated medical diagnoses were analyzed and included 16 (47.1%) cases of 
PF in 16 subjects (rated severe in 13 subjects and moderate in 3 subjects). There were 18 (52.9%) cases 
of thromboembolic disorders: 3 severe DIC, 2 severe PE, 5 DVT (2 moderate and 3 severe), 1 severe 
arterial thromboembolism, 3 severe macrovascular thrombosis, and 4 severe cases of thromboembolic 
episodes that did not fall into any of the categories mentioned above. No subjects presented with CISN 
(CSR 400701, Table 12.2). 
Among the 25 subjects with severe congenital PC deficiency, blindness and PF were each reported in 15 
subjects (60.0%), thromboembolic disease in 18 subjects (72.0%), stroke in 11 subjects (44.0%), 
thrombophilia in 4 subjects (16.0%), renal failure/dysfunction in 3 subjects (12.0%), PE in 2 subjects 
(8.0%), amputation in 1 subject (4.0%), and mesenteric thrombosis in 1 subject (4.0%). Eight subjects 
(32.0%) had conditions that fell within the category of “other”. No subjects had a history of myocardial 
infarction. Within the category of thromboembolic disease, there were 18 subjects with the disease; DVT 
(in 9/18 subjects) and DIC (in 3/18 subjects) were the most frequently reported conditions (CSR 400701, 
Table 13). 
Efficacy 
Historical Administration of CEPROTIN 
Most subjects (88.0%) had received treatment with CEPROTIN prior to enrollment. Of 84 historical 
CEPROTIN administrations, 41.7% were required for acute treatment, 20.2% for short-term replacement 
due to surgery, 29.8% for long-term prophylaxis, and 8.3% for other reasons. No historical treatments 
Assessment report  
EMA/913542/2022 
Page 30/51 
 
 
 
 
were given for short-term replacement of PC during pregnancy or the peri-partum period. Of these 84 
historical administrations of CEPROTIN, 88.1% were considered effective in the prevention of 
coagulopathy and thrombosis, 67.9% halted/reversed thrombosis, 42.9% halted/reversed coagulopathy, 
13.1% halted/reversed end organ damage, 9.5% resulted in limb sparing (data was missing for 4 cases; 
treatment outcomes were not mutually exclusive). 
Relapse was reported in 3 (12.0%) subjects and these were all subjects with severe congenital PC 
deficiency. Remission, seen in 21 subjects lasted a median of 3.0 years (range: 0.3 to 19.9). Transition to 
anticoagulant therapy was successful in 8 (32.0%) subjects assessed (CSR 400701, Table 5.1, Table 6.1). 
Administration of CEPROTIN during the Registry Study 
At enrollment, 21/25 (84.0%) of subjects were receiving CEPROTIN, which was required for long-term 
prophylaxis in 90.5% (19 subjects) and for short-term replacement due to surgery in 9.5%. (Only 3/25 
[12.0%] subjects received newly prescribed CEPROTIN after enrollment in the registry.) CEPROTIN was 
administered IV in 61.9% of subjects and subcutaneously in 38.1% subjects at enrollment (Table 7). 
Table 10. 
CEPROTIN Usage at Enrollment Subjects with Congenital PC Deficiency in Study 
400701 
Source: CSR 400701 Table 5.2.1 
Dosing at enrollment in subjects with severe congenital PC deficiency was variable (45 IU/kg in 1 subject, 
80 IU/kg in 1 subject, 100 IU/kg in 2 subjects, 120 IU/kg in 1 subject, and “other” in 16 subjects), as 
was the frequency of administration (5 subjects were dosed every other day, 3 were dosed three times a 
week, 2 were dosed twice a week, 1 was dosed every 12 h, 1 was dosed once a week and 8 were dosed 
as “other” indicating various other times). Dosing and frequency of administration at the time of analysis 
were similar to that at enrollment (CSR 400701, Table 5.2.1).  
In the subjects receiving long-term prophylactic treatment (19 of 25 subjects), who received a total of 
195 infusions, the dose during the study was 45 IU/kg for 37 (19.0%) infusions, 60 IU/kg for 18 (9.2%) 
infusions, 80 IU/kg for 17 (8.7%) infusions, 100 IU/kg for 5 (2.6%) infusions, 120 IU/kg for 2 (1.0%) 
infusions and “other” for the remaining 116 (59.5%) infusions. Of these 195 infusions, 36 (18.5%) were 
administered daily, 13 (6.7%) every 12 h, 2 (1.0%) every 6 h, 2 (1.0%) every 8 h, 7 (3.6%) every other 
day, 5 (2.6%) twice a week, and 7 (3.6%) infusions were administered three times a week. For the rest, 
other administration frequencies were used (Table 11).

In subjects with severe congenital PC deficiency, a total of 147 anticoagulation therapies were 
documented in 22 subjects, of which 51.7% were with enoxaparin sodium and 25.2% were with warfarin, 
largely given once or twice daily. Twenty subjects received at least one concomitant medication; the 
medications most frequently used were paracetamol (in 48.0% of subjects), lovenox (32.0%), morphine 
and warfarin (24.0% each), ibuprofen and enoxaparin (in 20.0% each), and alteplase, levicetarem, 
coumadin, and amoxicillin (in 16% each) (CSR 400701, Table 10.1, Table 14). 
PC activity levels during the study were available in 18 subjects with severe congenital PC deficiency. In 
subjects who received short-term replacement, 6 assays results were recorded for 2 subjects with a 
median PC activity level of 172.5% (range: 48.0% to 198.0%). All 6 assays were taken after the first 
CEPROTIN treatment date for each subject. Fourteen subjects who received long-term prophylaxis with 
CEPROTIN had a total of 201 assay results available, with a median PC activity level of 41.0% (range: 
1.0% to 191.0%) (CSR 400701, Table 15).

Outcome 
Acute treatment 
Of 25 acute episodes, 22 (88%) resulted in recovery, 2 (8.0%) displayed improvement and 1 (4.0%) was 
unchanged; there was no instance of an acute episode worsening when CEPROTIN was administered. 
With respect to specific treatment outcomes, 7 (28.0%) CEPROTIN administrations were reported to have 
resulted in halting/reversal of coagulopathy and 21 (84.0%) resulted in halting/reversal of thrombosis 
(CSR 400701 Table 6.2). 
Short-Term Replacement 
A total of 28 surgeries/invasive procedures were performed during the study in 13 subjects with severe 
congenital PC deficiency. Short-term replacement with CEPROTIN was administered for 23 (82.1%) of 
these surgeries/procedures. (There were no short-term replacements during pregnancy or the peri-
partum period.) All administrations of CEPROTIN for short-term replacement for surgery/invasive 
procedures were considered effective in the prevention of coagulopathy and thrombosis (CSR 400701 
Table 6.2, Table 16). 
Literature 
The MAH provided a collection of publications reporting about long-term treatment with CEPROTIN in 
patients with severe congenital PC deficiency (Table 12). The clinical benefits In the treatment of lesions 
and their further prevention were documented. No product-related side effects were reported. The most 
common reasons for discontinuing CEPROTIN therapy and starting oral anticoagulation were problems 
with the venous access. However, episodes of bleeding or recurrent purpura occurred in all patients who 
received oral anticoagulation. CEPROTIN therapy had to be reinstated in most of these children, either as 
needed to control symptoms, or on a long-term prophylactic schedule, alone or in addition to oral 
anticoagulation. If CEPROTIN is given prophylactically in addition to oral anticoagulation, twice weekly 
administration appeared to be sufficient. After the acute phase, trough levels of PC activity lower than 
0.25 IU/mL may be sufficient to prevent recurrent thrombosis. 
The authors also point out that one of the advantages of replacement therapy with CEPROTIN compared 
with FFP is the possibility of home treatment, which allows a near-normal lifestyle. Patients and parents 
may choose the timing of the injections to suit their convenience. The availability of various access 
devices has made home treatment feasible for patients who would otherwise be hospitalized for long 
periods of time.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Clinical efficacy of long-term prophylactic treatment with CEPROTIN in subjects with severe congenital 
protein C deficiency was investigated in one prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized phase 
2/3 study (400101). Supportive information on the use of CEPROTIN in this indication derives from 
retrospective data (RDC), one registry study (400701) and published data. 
The pivotal study 400101 was divided in three parts for on-demand treatment of acute episodes (part 1), 
short-term prophylaxis (part 2) and long-term prophylaxis (part 3). 
A total of 24 episodes of PF/CISN or vascular thrombotic events in 11 subjects were treated with 
CEPROTIN in Part 1. Three subjects entered Part 2 of the study for a total of 7 times for short-term 
prophylaxis treatment with study product (initiation of anticoagulation therapy, for surgical procedures). 
Eight subjects with a mean age of 4.7 years entered Part 3 for long-term prophylactic treatment with 
study product for a treatment period of 42 to 338 days. The dosing regimen for long-term prophylaxis 
was based on the investigator’s decision guided by Protein C activity levels preventing the trough levels 
from falling below 25% (or 10% for subjects on long-term anticoagulant treatment).  
The retrospective data collection (Studies IMAG-039 and IMAG-041 and Compassionate Use) included 9 
subjects, of which 8 were homozygous and 1 was double heterozygous, receiving long-term prophylactic 
treatment for a period of up to 8 years. The selection and timing of the dose used for each individual 
subject was determined by the investigator on the basis of the clinical status of the subject. 
In the registry study 19 patients with severe congenital protein C deficiency and a median age of 11.1 
years (range 1.3 to 43.7) were enrolled to receive long-term prophylaxis with CEPROTIN. The according 
dosing regimen also highly varied. The subjects on long-term prophylaxis participated for a median of 
40.2 months. 
The cases of 39 patients suffering from severe congenital PC deficiency were described in 17 publications. 
Most of the subjects had homozygous PC deficiency. There were also some cases with compound 
heterozygous PC deficiency. Most of the patients were neonates or very young infants displaying severe 
lesions of PF up to ophthalmologic complications including blindness and DIC. Long-term prophylactic 
treatment was introduced with regard to individual requirements. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study 400101 the outcome of the eight subjects on long-term prophylaxis is rated as excellent since no 
event of PF/CISN and/or thrombosis occurred. Four subjects had both periods of on-demand and 
prophylaxis experiencing 6, 4, 2 and 1 event while on on-demand treatment. A post-hoc reanalysis 
delivered significant results with regard to the non-occurrence of events during prophylaxis. Previously, it 
has been discussed whether the patient population in the different parts is comparable due to different 
inclusion criteria. For the inclusion in part 1 the presence of PF/CISN or thromboembolic events is a 
prerequisite. In part 3 patients should be asymptomatic. However, important differences of the included 
patients per part can be ruled out with regard to the baseline characteristics and the performed switching 
between parts. A further descriptive analysis shows a quite similar time frame between stopping long-
term prophylaxis and the occurrence of the first episode. Even if the patient number is very small (n=4), 
this demonstrates that long-term prophylactic treatment with Protein C Concentrate is effective in 
preventing thrombotic events by long-term treatment of subjects with severe protein C deficiency. 
Assessment report  
EMA/913542/2022 
Page 35/51 
 
 
 
 
In the retrospective data collection of 9 subjects, efficacy of CEPROTIN for long-term treatment was rated 
excellent in 7 subjects who were evaluated by the investigator. Dosing regimen (dose selection, timing) 
highly varied between individuals since it was based on the decision of the investigator according to PC 
activity levels. Sometimes long-term prophylaxis with CEPROTIN was combined with anticoagulation 
therapy. This data contribute to the supportive evidence that CEPROTIN is effective in long-term 
prophylaxis.  
The registry study does not provide outcome data for the 19 subjects on long-term prophylaxis with 
CEPROTIN. Their dosing regimens highly varied and most of the patients received anticoagulation 
therapies (enoxaparin sodium or warfarin). The available PC activity levels showed a broad range. 
Therefore, additional information is requested for these patients in the registry on long-term prophylactic 
treatment, which would be useful to characterise efficacy in older patients (age ranging between 1.3 to 
43.7 years in the recruited population). These data are expected in the submission of PSUR. 
In the publications, CEPROTIN was efficacious in the treatment of lesions and prevented the development 
of lesions during its following long-term administration. In general, no side effects of CEPROTIN treatment 
were reported. Since CEPROTIN prophylaxis requires frequent intravenous administration there was often 
a switch to oral anticoagulation, which does not appear to be fully effective in the prevention of 
thromboembolic events in severe PC deficiency. Thus, often oral anticoagulation was combined with 
CEPROTIN treatment. Regarding the individual requirements and the various treatment regimen for 
CEPROTIN prophylaxis, it is recognised that CEPROTIN is dosed according to laboratory measurements of 
the Protein C activity and the individual need judged by the treating physician. In this connection, the 
publications state that trough levels of PC activity can be lower than usual for effective long-term 
prophylaxis. In addition, it is reported that CEPROTIN administration can be reduced to twice per week in 
the combination with oral anticoagulation. Section 4.2 of the SmPC recommends the following posology 
for long term prophylaxis: “For the long-term prophylactic treatment, a dose of 45 to 60 IU/kg every 12 
hours is recommended. Measurement of the protein C activity should be performed to ensure trough 
levels of 25% or more. Dose or frequency of infusions should be adjusted accordingly.” Subcutaneously 
administered PC concentrate was described as tool for the long-term prophylactic treatment. Since no 
preclinical and/or clinical study data (especially no bioavailability data) are available for the subcutaneous 
route, this tool of administration should only be used in exceptional situations (see SmPC) and no 
recommendations can be made for long-term prophylactic treatment. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The overall evidence currently available indicates benefit for CEPROTIN in the long-term prophylaxis of 
congenital severe protein C deficiency and supports the sought extension of indication.  
In the pivotal study and RDC dataset efficacy of CEPROTIN was rated excellent in long-term prophylactic 
treatment in patients with SCPCD based on investigator`s evaluation. Exposure was limited to 6 months 
in the pivotal 400101 trial as per study design but much longer periods of prophylactic treatment are 
supported by the RDC dataset and various publications. Knowledge on the natural course of disease 
enables contextualisation of these data, thus overcoming the limited sample size and concluding for a 
positive effect of treatment sustained over time. This is reinforced by data collected in 4 out of 8 patients 
from study 400101 who received both on-demand and long-term schedule with CEPROTIN, demonstrating 
benefit in terms of prevention of events achieved with sustained therapy.  
Therefore, the extension of indication from short-term prophylaxis to prophylaxis is agreed.

A review of all the reported AEs in the clinical studies shows the following:  
Of a total of 146 subjects enrolled in clinical studies with CEPROTIN in the indication of congenital PC 
deficiency, 10 (6.8%) subjects died. All deaths were considered unrelated to the study drug. Of a total of 
825 reported AEs, 6 (0.7%) were considered to be related to the study drug. These were itching, rash, 
and light-headedness, which occurred in one subject in Study IMAG-098, and abdominal pain, pain in 
extremity, and PF, which occurred in one subject in Study 400701; all 6 related AEs occurred in two 
subjects in two studies (Study IMAG-098, Study 400701). Two of the related AEs were serious 
(abdominal pain, pain in extremity).  
Of a total of 164 subjects enrolled in clinical studies, treated with either CEPROTIN or placebo (albumin) 
in the indication of bacterial sepsis/septic shock and/or PF, 37 (22.6%) subjects died. No deaths were 
considered to be related to the study drug. Of a total of 56 reported AEs, 23 were serious and 33 were 
non-serious. All 23 SAEs were considered unrelated to the study drug. In Study IMAG-112, one moderate 
AE, skin rash, was deemed related to the albumin infusion. No other related AEs were reported in the 
sepsis/PF studies.

Study 400101 
Protein C was found to be effective for both short- and long-term prophylaxis. A total of 15 subjects were 
exposed to protein C. Eight subjects were studied for LTP. The median number of exposure days for these 
8 patients was: 7.5 for on-site infusions and 183 for home infusions. None of the AEs was related to 
study drug or resulted in withdrawal from the study. No protein C inhibitory antibodies were detected. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths  
In congenital PC deficiency, 10 (6.8%) subjects died of a total of 143 subjects treated with CEPROTIN: 8 
deaths were reported in the RDC (IMAG-039, IMAG-041, compassionate use), 1 death was reported in 
Study 400101, and 1 death was reported in Treatment Registry 400701. All deaths were considered 
unrelated to the study drug. Among the patients included in the literature review on congenital PC 
deficiency, one death occurred (see Summary of Clinical Efficacy [Module 2.7.3], Section 3.1.2.2.2, Case 
Report 9) (Dreyfus et al. 1995). In acquired PC deficiency (Section 5.2.2), 37 (22.6%) subjects died of a 
total of 164 subjects treated with either CEPROTIN or placebo (albumin) in the indication of bacterial 
sepsis/septic shock and/or PF: 5/12 subjects died in Study IMAG-103, 9/40 died in Study IMAG-112, 
21/94 died in Study CEPROTIN-D-001, and 2 died in Treatment Registry 400701. No deaths were 
considered related to the administration of the study drug. 
Serious AEs 
A comparison of serious and non-serious AEs cannot be made across all the studies in the indication of 
congenital PC deficiency, as no distinction was made in the RDC of studies IMAG-039, IMAG-041 and 
compassionate use between serious and non-serious AEs (although 4 severe AEs were reported in 4 
subjects in the RDC, i.e., abdominal pain, migraine headache, tachycardia (> 300 beats per minute), and 
ablation of second toe on the right and left foot). All AEs in the RDC were considered unrelated to the 
study drug. In Study IMAG-098, 52 SAEs occurred in 9 subjects; in Study 400101 there were 35 SAEs. 
None of these SAEs were attributed to the study drug. In Treatment Registry 400701, 39 of 111 AEs in 
subjects with severe congenital PC deficiency were serious and occurred in 13 subjects. A total of 3 AEs 
were considered possibly related to CEPROTIN by the investigator; two of these AEs were SAEs. All 3 
related AEs occurred in one subject and were as follows: abdominal pain (SAE), pain in extremity (SAE), 
and PF (non-serious AE) xi. It should be noted that in all 3 events the dose was increased and CEPROTIN 
was not discontinued. Related AEs occurred in one subject and were as follows: abdominal pain (SAE), 
pain in extremity (SAE), and PF (non-serious AE) xi. It should be noted that in all 3 events the dose was 
increased and CEPROTIN was not discontinued. 
Of a total of 56 AEs reported in the four studies in bacterial sepsis/septic shock and/or PF, 23 were 
serious and 33 were non-serious. All 23 SAEs were considered unrelated to the study drug. In Studies 
IMAG-103 and IMAG-112, most SAEs were deaths: Five deaths occurred in Study IMAG-103 and 9 deaths 
occurred in Study IMAG-112. These were attributable to septic shock or bacterial sepsis. 
Laboratory findings 
PC inhibitory antibodies 
Assessment of PC inhibitory antibodies was only performed during clinical studies on congenital PC 
deficiency. There have been no reports describing the development of an inhibitor against protein C in 
subjects with PC deficiency following administration of CEPROTIN. The determination of inhibitory 
antibodies against protein C was based on the chromogenic assay to determine protein C activity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/913542/2022 
Page 39/51 
 
 
 
 
Anti-Murine Antibodies 
During the manufacturing process, protein C is isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using a 
murine anti-human protein C monoclonal antibody.  As CEPROTIN may therefore, theoretically, 
contain traces of mouse protein as a result of this stage of the process, anti-murine antibodies were 
assessed during clinical studies. 
Anti-murine antibodies were determined in study IMAG-103 in acquired protein C deficiency and in 
studies RDC (IMAG-039, IMAG-041, and compassionate use), IMAG-098, and 400101 in congenital 
protein C deficiency. One positive test result for anti-murine antibodies was reported in study RDC. 
However, this test result was below the upper limit of 200 ng/mL of the ELISA test system used. No 
AEs (other than this low titre) occurred in this subject, who received a total of 51 doses of CEPROTIN 
(22,883 IU) over a treatment period of 15 months. 
Viral Safety 
No subjects showed positive shifts for HAV. 
Two positive hepatitis B markers were detected throughout the study courses of RDC (IMAG-039, IMAG-
041, compassionate use) and IMAG-098. However, these positive shifts are not likely to be due to 
CEPROTIN. No subjects showed positive shifts for HCV. 
While no transmission of PVB19 could be confirmed in study IMAG-103 and in the studies with congenital 
protein C deficiency, 6 subjects in study IMAG-112 seroconverted for PVB19. However, all 6 subjects had 
received non-virus inactivated blood products (FFP, plasma, whole blood, packed cells, erythrocytes, and 
thrombocytes) in addition to CEPROTIN. A transmission of PVB19 through CEPROTIN is very unlikely, 
given the drug product’s safety profile. 
In study IMAG-098, 7 subjects tested positive for PVB19-IgG antibodies at study entry, indicating that 
infection had occurred at some point prior to study entry. Six subjects were negative for PVB19-IgG at 
study entry, but 3 of them tested positive for PVB19-Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, indicating that 
a recent infection had occurred prior to study entry. Two subjects changed from negative to positive 
according to the PCR test method during the observation period. However, both of these subjects already 
had a positive result for PVB19 antibody at study entry (one positive result for PVB19-IgM and one for 
PVB19-IgG). No viral transmission was determined to have occurred in study IMAG-098 during the 3-
month follow-up period. 
In study 400101, one subject tested negative for PVB19-IgG at baseline, but was positive for IgG at all 
following assessments. The subject was negative for PVB19-IgM at all assessments. PCR for PVB19 
nucleic acid was negative 6 months after initial treatment with the study product. The investigator 
determined that the occurrence of the positive PVB19-IgG result did not coincide with any of the clinical 
symptoms expected with an active infection by PVB19, and therefore did not report this event as an AE. 
No subjects showed positive shifts for HIV-1/-2. 
Safety in special populations 
No studies evaluating the use during pregnancy/lactation have been performed.  
In addition, there are not clinical data in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment and in the elderly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/913542/2022 
Page 40/51 
 
 
 
 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies investigation evaluating drug interactions have been performed. No interactions with other 
drug products are currently known. In the absence of incompatibility studies, CEPROTIN should not be 
mixed with other medicinal products. 
In patients starting treatment with oral anticoagulants belonging to the class of vitamin K antagonists 
(e.g., warfarin, coumarin), a transient hypercoagulable state may arise before the desired anticoagulant 
effect becomes apparent. This transient effect may be explained by the fact that protein C, itself a 
vitamin K-dependent plasma protein, has a shorter half-life than most of the vitamin K-dependent 
proteins (i.e., II, IX and X). Subsequently, in the initial phase of treatment, the activity of PC is more 
rapidly suppressed than that of the procoagulant factors. For this reason, if the patient is switched to oral 
anticoagulants, protein C replacement must be continued until stable anticoagulation is obtained. CISN 
can occur in any patient during the initiation of oral anticoagulant therapy, but individuals with severe PC 
deficiency are particularly at risk (Broekmans 1985; Broekmans et al. 1983; Nazarian et al. 2009; 
Stewart 2010; Vigano'D'Angelo et al. 1986). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no withdrawals due to AEs. 
Post marketing experience 
The post-marketing experience with CEPROTIN is based on Periodic Safety Update Reports 
(PSURs)/Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRERs), covering the period from the International 
Birth Date (IBD) of CEPROTIN (16 July 2001) until 31 July 2021. 
CEPROTIN was first approved on 16 July 2001 in the European Union (EU) through a centralised 
procedure. As of 31 July 2021, CEPROTIN has approved licenses in 40 countries: Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, 
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kuwait, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, 
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States of America 
(USA). 
Cumulative Subject Exposure from Marketing Experience  
Due to the large number of parameters taken into account to calculate the daily dose and the duration of 
treatment for CEPROTIN, the best estimate of patient exposure is the number of units sold worldwide. 
The average daily treatments calculated in International Units (IU), are based upon the recommended 
dose of 60 - 80 IU/kg BW, a BW of 30 - 40 kg for an average individual, and on the assumption that a 
considerable proportion of subjects will be at child age. Based on the above methodology, the cumulative 
patient exposure can be estimated to be 437,188,650 IU (i.e., the number of units sold), corresponding 
to approximately 174,875 daily treatments cumulatively. 
Adverse Drug Reactions Reported in the Post-Marketing Experience  
The following adverse reactions have been reported in the post-marketing experience, listed by MedDRA 
System Organ Class (SOC):

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patients have been sufficiently exposed to protein C. 
The rates of AEs across clinical studies vary due to differences in the patient’s disease status, duration 
and other factors. Overall, however, reports of related AEs are extremely rare and uncritical (one case of 
skin rash to the placebo in IMAG-112) and one subject displaying 3 related AEs (itching, rash, and light-
headedness) in Study IMAG-098. As with any intravenous product allergic type hypersensitivity reactions 
are possible. The following ADRs have been reported in the post-marketing experience and the frequency 
of these ADRs is not known: restlessness, hyperhidrosis and injection site reaction. 
No certain safety issues have been identified with regard to prophylactic treatment. Furthermore, no 
specific safety data are available for CEPROTIN in the combination with anticoagulation therapy. 
Based on the revision of all available data in patients with severe protein C deficiency undergoing long-
term prophylaxis, it is noted that catheter thrombosis represented the most common reason for drug 
discontinuation. This is an expected complication of central catheterization which is required in the 
youngest ages. However, it is noted that in several occasions, intravenous therapy was switched to 
subcutaneous drug administration, which is identified as exceptional mode of administration in the 
current SmPC (section 4.2).  
The presentation of SAE including the fatal case showed a high rate of SAE due to deaths in acquired 
protein C deficiency. This observation is consistent with the underlying disease of bacterial sepsis/septic 
shock. All these cases were considered unrelated to the study drug. 
Overall, no clinically relevant dose-related changes have been observed for laboratory parameter. There 
is no evidence for viral transmission. 
No inhibitor development was detected in any patient treated with CEPROTIN. Development of low titre 
anti-murine immunoglobulins was observed in one patient without clinical implications. 
So far, post-marketing data do not display any safety signals due to CEPROTIN treatment. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Clinical safety has been analysed from the data of all clinical trials. The presented results are considered 
to be sufficient. No unexpected pattern in the reported adverse events and serious adverse events were 
observed. The safety data of studies cover subjects < 18 years and adults. No patients developed protein 
C inhibitory antibodies. Review of the new safety data does not reveal any new significant safety issue. 
The safety profile of the product remains consistent with the safety profile established during clinical trials 
and as established in previous evaluations. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.0 is acceptable. In addition, minor 
revisions were recommended to be taken into account with the next RMP update, as follows: 
- In the next revision of the RMP, please pay more attention to detail. For example, with regard to i) the 
wording in Table 2 Annex 2 (bleeding episodes is not a safety concern associated with Ceprotin); ii) the 
section on post-authorisation exposure (no reference to periods without specifying actual times; the term 
“Number of daily treatments” is ambiguous); and iii) the subsection Pharmaceutical form(s) and strengths 
in RMP part I, which of course remains applicable for Ceprotin.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 2.0 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in sections 4.2, and 4.4 in 
the SmPC and Package Leaflet and to correct the address of the manufacturer of the biological active 
substance in Annex II following variation EMEA/H/C/000334/IAIN/0126/G. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application is an extension of indication to include long-term prophylaxis (deletion of wording ‘short-
term’ and currently listed conditions) of purpura fulminans and coumarin induced skin necrosis in patients 
with severe congenital protein C deficiency.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
CEPROTIN is currently the only treatment option available to substitute protein C in severe congenital PC 
deficiency. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is not a real therapeutic alternative since the volume of FFP 
required to raise protein C to normal levels can lead to fluid overload, especially in children, with the risk 
of pulmonary edema, hypertension, hyperproteinemia, or proteinuria. Prothrombin complex concentrates 
(PCCs) contains protein C, but also vitamin K dependent coagulation factors with thromboembolic 
potential. Liver transplantation has been curative for severe congenital PC deficiency in a few cases. 
However, it necessitates lifelong immunosuppression and is associated with a potential risk of 
autoantibody formation against protein C produced by the transplanted organ, due to polymorphism. 
Long- term anticoagulation with coumarin or heparin derivates has side effects and can often not fully 
prevent thromboembolic events. Severe congenital PC deficiency being a lifelong condition, long-term 
prophylaxis with CEPROTIN could prevent thromboembolic complications and overcome the drawbacks of 
alternative treatment options.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Clinical efficacy of long-term prophylactic treatment with CEPROTIN in subjects with severe congenital 
protein C deficiency was investigated in one prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized phase 
2/3 study (400101) which was divided in three parts for on-demand (n=11), short-term (n=3) and long-
term treatment (n=8). Supportive information on the use of CEPROTIN in this indication derives from 
retrospective data (RDC), one registry study (400701) and published data. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In 8 subjects of study 400101 no event of PF/CISN and/or thrombosis occurred while on long-term 
prophylaxis. Four subjects were treated in both parts of on-demand and prophylaxis experiencing 6, 4, 2 
and 1 event while on on-demand treatment. A post-hoc reanalysis demonstrated that the  non-
occurrence of events during prophylaxis. A further descriptive analysis shows a quite similar time frame 
between stopping long-term prophylaxis and the occurrence of the first episode. The beneficial effects are 
supported by a registry study, publications and retrospective data. Section 4.2 of the SmPC recommends 
that if the response to CEPROTIN injection is satisfactory (measured by chromogenic assays), dosing may 
be gradually reduced to 12 hourly dosing ensuring trough protein C activity >25% (>0.25 IU/ml). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Since SCPCD is a very rare disease, the number of investigated patients was low. In the pivotal study 
only 8 of 18 included patients were on long-term prophylaxis for a limited time. This study was 
uncontrolled. The post-hoc analysis of 4 patients participating in both treatment parts of on-demand 
therapy and long-term prophylaxis has its limitations (e.g. different inclusion criteria). The supportive 
data comprising literature, retrospective data and a registry study also include a limited number of 
patients and show a high variation of applied dose regimen. There were several reports of combination 
with anticoagulation therapy and different requirements of trough levels of PC. Section 4.2 of the SmPC 
recommends that if the patient is switched to permanent prophylaxis with oral anticoagulants, protein C 
replacement is to be discontinued only when stable anticoagulation is obtained (see section 4.5). 
Furthermore, during the initiation of oral anticoagulant therapy it is advisable to start with a low dose and 
adjust this incrementally, rather than use a standard loading dose. At start of a combination treatment of 
anticoagulants (especially Vitamin K antagonists) with Protein C, stable activity levels of Protein C above 
0.25 IU/ml (chromogenic) should be maintained before starting the anticoagulation. Careful monitoring of 
the international normalized ratio (INR) is recommended. In the combination of Protein C Concentrate 
and -anticoagulants, a protein C trough level of about 10% or more is recommended to be maintained. 
In addition, as stated in section 4.2 of the SmPC mentions that in patients with combined severe 
congenital protein C deficiency and with APC resistance, there are limited clinical data to support the

safety and efficacy of CEPROTIN. The safety and efficacy of CEPROTIN in patients with renal and/or 
hepatic impairment have not been established. Patients with any of these conditions should be monitored 
more closely. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No certain side effects have been reported for long-term prophylaxis with CEPROTIN. Safety risks of 
hypersensitivity, inhibitors, transmissible agents, Heparin induced thrombocytopenia, concurrent anti-
coagulation medication are already reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The available safety database of 8 subjects on long-term prophylaxis is very small. The time frame of 
long-term prophylactic treatment was limited (42-338 days). Dosing was guided by blood levels of protein 
C and investigator`s decision. The actual administered doses of CEPROTIN have not been provided. No 
specific safety data are available for CEPROTIN in the combination with anticoagulation therapy.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The proposed extension of indication is supported by a strong pharmacological rationale. CEPROTIN is 
already approved in severe protein C deficiency for treatment of acute episodes and short-term 
prophylaxis, and offers the only protein C replacement therapy in a population of patients with a very rare 
inherited blood disorder for which current alternatives have limited efficacy and/or unsatisfactory safety 
profile. Available data are numerically limited, including 8 patients from the pivotal trial 400101 and 9 
from a retrospective dataset (RDC) which is consistent with the clinical setting. Evidence mainly refer to 
the paediatric population (small infants and children), as expected given the history of disease. Exposure 
to therapy was individually based in terms of dose/frequency of administration and length of treatment, 
limited to 6 months in the pivotal 400101 trial as per study design but much longer periods of 
prophylactic treatment are available from the RDC dataset and various publications. Given the lack of a 
proper PK/PD response in the long-term prophylaxis, information on dosage is provided in the SmPC as 
based on current findings. The effect of treatment (either with or without concomitant anticoagulation) 
was established based on clinically relevant outcomes (observed prevention of thrombotic events and skin 
lesions during treatment) and response was rated as excellent in all treated patients, as based on 
investigator’s assessment. Knowledge on the natural course of disease enables contextualisation of these 
data concluding for a positive effect of treatment sustained over time. Further information has been 
provided on efficacy as derived from the registry study that would include also an older population and 
additional information on combination of CEPROTIN with anticoagulants. 
No related AEs were reported for patients on long-term prophylaxis with CEPROTIN in the pivotal study. 
This favourable safety profile is supported by the safety data across all clinical studies. 
Unlike the pivotal trial where exposure was limited to 6 months, retrospective data from the RDC and 
registry study with longer treatment length (up to 8 years) showed that a common cause of drug 
discontinuation during long-term prophylaxis was catheter thrombosis, which is an expected complication. 
In several occasions, investigators switched to subcutaneous drug administration, currently contemplated 
in the SmPC section 4.2 in exceptional circumstances. 
Overall, the benefit of no thromboembolic events during prophylaxis outweighs the limitations of a small 
uncontrolled sample size in the pivotal study. The efficacy of prophylaxis is supported by publications, 
registry data and retrospective data. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The provided data demonstrate that long-term prophylactic treatment with Protein C Concentrate is 
effective in preventing thrombotic events in subjects with severe protein C deficiency. Prophylactic 
treatment with CEPROTIN showed a good safety and tolerability. An increased bleeding risk or allergic 
reactions were not observed. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ceprotin for this extended indication is positive.

Extension of indication to include long-term prophylaxis (deletion of wording ‘short-term’ and currently 
listed conditions) of purpura fulminans and coumarin induced skin necrosis in patients with severe 
congenital protein C deficiency, based on a re-analysis of long-term prophylaxis data from the pivotal 
Study 400101; a phase 2/3 clinical study undertaken to evaluate PK, safety and efficacy of CEPROTIN in 
patients with severe congenital PC deficiency for the treatment of acute thrombotic episodes, for short-
term thromboembolic prophylaxis and for long-term prophylactic treatment. As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated and the Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, 
the MAH took the opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in sections 4.4 and 4.8 the SmPC and

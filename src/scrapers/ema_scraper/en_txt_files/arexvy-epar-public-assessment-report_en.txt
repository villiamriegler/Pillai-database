2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus belonging to the Pneumovirus genus in the 
Paramyxoviridae family of which 2 antigenically distinct subtypes exist, RSV-A and RSV-B. 
RSV is a highly contagious human pathogen that causes respiratory tract infections in people of all ages. RSV 
infection does not confer long-term immunity; therefore, re-infection with RSV occurs throughout life and is 
common in all age groups. Usually, re-infections manifest as common acute upper respiratory tract 
infections. However, in more vulnerable individuals (e.g., immunocompromised persons or older adults), re-
infections can also lead to more severe disease, involving the lower respiratory tract. In older adults, 
immunosenescence and the presence of underlying medical conditions can lead to an increased risk of severe 
RSV disease, which may result in severe lower respiratory tract infections, cardiac complications, and 
exacerbations of underlying diseases (such as COPD, asthma, and chronic heart failure). RSV can lead to 
severe outcomes in these populations, such as pneumonia, hospitalisation, and death [Prasad, 2021].
2.1.2.  Epidemiology
In temperate climates throughout the world, RSV predictably causes fall-winter epidemics. In (sub) tropical 
regions, viral activity is more endemic, and outbreaks are less temporally focused. The RSV-A and RSV-B 
subtypes co-circulate, and the predominance of one over the other varies by year and geographic location.
An international prospective cohort study among 3 European countries, as part of the RESCEU research 
consortium, followed participants ≥60 YOA for the 2017-2018 (N=513) and 2018-2019 (N=527) RSV seasons 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 11/103
[Korsten et al., Eur Respir J 2021;57:2002688]. RSV was confirmed in 4.2% of participants in the first 
season and 7.2% in the second season. Based on a prospective cohort study conducted from October 2007 to 
April 2010 in 12 European countries, a 5.9% prevalence of RSV among LRTI outpatients ≥60 YOA was found 
[Bruyndonckx et al., Int J of infect. Dis. 2020; 95:384-390].
A meta-analysis based on a systematic literature review was conducted in 2020 to determine the burden of 
disease of RSV in adults ≥60 YOA in industrialised countries. 24 studies were included in the meta-analysis, 
leading to an estimated RSV-ARI attack rate of 1.09% (95% CI: 0.40-2.93), with an RSV-ARI hospitalisation 
rate of 0.13 % (95% CI:0.8-2.2) and an in-hospital case fatality rate of 6.8% (95% CI: 6.4-7.21). When 
applying these estimates to the European population estimate of adults aged 60 and older (estimated 2019 
population aged ≥ 60 years in geographic Europe (EU, EEA and other): 188,795,000)), 2 million cases of 
RSV-ARI are estimated each year, accounting for 250,000 hospitalisations and 17,000 in-hospital deaths 
[Savic et al. Influenza Other Respi viruses. 2022;1–10]. In Finland, a retrospective study found a 
hospitalisation attack rate of 58.3/100 000 for adults ≥65 YOA over 4 seasons, varying from 19.3 to 117.6 
[Auvinen et al., Influenza Other Respi Viruses. 2022; 16:276-288]. 
In adults, the highest burden of disease is in older people and those with comorbidities such as lung or heart 
disease and diabetes. In these patient populations, RSV can exacerbate conditions like chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, chronic heart failure, and lead to severe outcomes such as pneumonia, 
hospitalisation, and death.
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis
Symptomatic RSV usually starts as an upper respiratory tract infection, that can lead to more serious disease 
by involving the lower respiratory tract. 
The most common symptoms include nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea, sore throat, cough, sputum, dyspnoea, 
wheezing, rhonchi, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen saturation. In addition, systemic signs include 
fever, fatigue, body aches, headache, and decreased appetite.
2.1.4.  Management
Treatment
An antiviral agent, ribavirin, is licensed for the treatment of RSV infection in the United States and some EU 
Member States; however, it is not recommended in the United States or EU guidelines. Therefore, there is 
currently no specific treatment for RSV infections in older adults. Treatment for RSV in older adults is limited 
to supportive care, consisting of supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids and bronchodilators. Inhaled and 
systemic corticosteroids are often prescribed in patients with asthma or COPD.
Prevention
There is no licensed vaccine for the prevention of RSV-associated diseases. 
In children 2 preventative options are available: Synagis and Beyfortus. Synagis (palivizumab) is a 
humanised monoclonal antibody indicated for prophylaxis of RSV in children at high risk of RSV disease, 
including preterm infants. Beyfortus (nirsevimab) is a human monoclonal antibody indicated for the 
prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in neonates and infants during their first RSV season.

2.2.  About the product
The candidate Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine (Arexvy) consists of 120 µg of the RSVPreF3 
recombinant antigen and the AS01E Adjuvant System and is administered as a single dose. The RSVPreF3 
antigen is an engineered version of the RSV F surface glycoprotein, i.e., a trimeric RSV F protein stabilised in 
a pre-fusion conformation.
The F protein has been selected because it is a major surface antigen of RSV that is well conserved among 
the two antigenically distinct RSV-A and RSV-B subgroups. The F protein is necessary for the virus entry/cell 
fusion process and is the main target of the neutralising antibody response to RSV.
Arexvy is designed to: 


Boost the serum-neutralising antibody (NAb) response to prevent RSV infection and enhance the 
inhibition of viral replication. The aim of this vaccinal approach is to trigger an increase in RSV NAbs 
significantly above the natural infection levels observed in older adults.
Boost or de novo induction of a RSV-specific circulating T cell response to promote viral clearance and 
reduce disease severity (driven directly or indirectly by T cells). 
The claimed therapeutic indication is: Arexvy is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of lower 
respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes in adults 60 
years of age and older.
The recommended dosing regimen for Arexvy is a single dose of 0.5ml.
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to 
be of major public health interest. This was based on fact that it may be able to fulfil the unmet medical need 
for licensed vaccines that have a protective effect against RSV in the elderly population. Currently, there are 
no treatment or prophylaxis options available against RSV, which causes a significant burden of disease in 
the elderly population.
Development programme
The clinical development programme for Arexvy to support licensure in adults ≥60 years of age consists of 4 
Phase 3 studies, ADJ-006, ADJ-004, ADJ-007 and ADJ-009, and the Phase 2 dose-finding study ADJ-002.
The Applicant has halted the development of a maternal vaccination program using the investigational RSV 
Maternal (RSVPreF3) vaccine due to imbalances in preterm birth (PTB), observed in one study. A higher 
proportion of neonatal deaths (death of an infant within the first 28 days of life) was also observed, which 
was considered to be a consequence of PTB. The vaccine formulation used in the RSV Maternal program 
contained 120 μg of RSVPreF3 antigen (the same as used in the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine), unadjuvanted.
Compliance with CHMP guidance
The most relevant CHMP guidelines applied:


“Guideline on clinical evaluation of vaccines” (CPMP/VWP/164653/05, Rev.1).
“Guideline on the clinical evaluation of medicinal products indicated for the prophylaxis or treatment 
of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease” (EMA/CHMP/257022/2017).

2.4.  Quality aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
The finished product is presented as a preservative-free powder and suspension for suspension for injection 
containing 120 μg of RSVPreF3 antigen (powder) adjuvanted with AS01E (suspension). 
RSVPreF3 antigen consists of an engineered version of the RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein, stabilised in 
the pre-fusion trimeric conformation of the naturally occurring protein and is produced by recombinant DNA 
technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO cells).
Other ingredients of the antigen powder component are Trehalose Dihydrate, Polysorbate 80, Potassium 
Dihydrogen phosphate and Dipotassium phosphate. 
The AS01E adjuvant system is composed of the immuno-enhancers: plant extract Quillaja saponaria Molina, 
fraction 21 (QS-21) and 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) from Salmonella Minnesota. These are 
combined with liposomes, which consist of the excipients dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and 
cholesterol. Other ingredients of the adjuvant are Sodium chloride, Disodium phosphate, Potassium 
dihydrogen phosphate, and Water for injections. 
The pharmaceutical form of the Finish Product before reconstitution, as mentioned in the SmPC, is powder 
and suspension for suspension for injection. The monodose product (powder and suspension) is supplied in 
separate type I glass vials with butyl rubber stoppers. The liquid AS01E is used to reconstitute the RSVPreF3 
lyophilised antigen immediately prior to administration. One dose of reconstituted RSVPreF3 older adults 
vaccine (0.5 mL) contains 120 μg RSVPreF3 and 25 ug of each of the QS-21 and MPL immune enhancers.
2.4.2.  Active substance
2.4.2.1.  General Information
The fusion (F) protein is a major surface protein of RSV that is conserved among RSV groups A and B. This 
protein plays a critical role in RSV infectivity as it is involved in virus entry and cell-to-cell spread of the virus. 
Native RSV F is initially translated as a F0 protein precursor that is then cleaved at two closely spaced sites 
by a furin-like enzyme. This cleavage triggers the release of a small peptide (p27) while generating a fusion-
competent F molecule made of the two disulfide-linked F1 and F2 chains (F2 N-terminal to F1).
The RSV F protein is present in the form of homotrimers in a metastable pre-fusion structure anchored in the 
virus membrane. Binding with the target cell triggers a series of conformational changes in the F protein 
including the formation of a pre-hairpin intermediate, in which the hydrophobic fusion peptide at the N-
terminus of the F1 chain is inserted into the target membrane. Refolding of this intermediate results in the 
assembly of a highly stable post-fusion structure. RSV F also mediates the fusion of cell membranes of 
infected cells, leading to the formation of syncytia.
The RSVPreF3 antigen is an engineered version of the RSV fusion (F) surface glycoprotein, stabilised in the 
trimeric pre-fusion conformation of the naturally occurring F protein and eliminate triggering and

rearrangement into the post-F conformation. This is accomplished by the introduction of Cysteine residues 
leading to the formation of a disulfide bond; filling the cavities by hydrophobic substitutions, resulting in the 
pre-fusion molecule and a C terminal “foldon” domain. 
The calculated average molecular weight of the RSVPreF3 protein based on the mature protein amino acid 
sequence (492 amino acids) is 54.5 kDa.
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
Manufacture and quality control of RSVPreF3 antigen is performed by GSK Biologicals, at Wavre, Belgium. 
This site also stores the Working Cell banks and Master cell banks. The site holds a valid GMP certificate.
Production of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) trimetric glycoprotein F (RSVPreF3 antigen) Purified Bulk 
can be divided into the following stages: Cell culture, Purification, Storage.
Production of recombinant RSV glycoprotein F antigen is based on the amplification of a Chinese Hamster 
Ovary (CHO) cell line transfected with a DNA plasmid bearing the sequence of modified RSV glycoprotein F.
CHO transfected cells are amplified through a series of cultures to finally reach the high biomass density 
required for the inoculation of the production bioreactor at the appropriate scale. 
At the end of the culture step, the culture harvest is clarified by depth filtration. The clarified harvest is 
further processed by several purification steps, including different types of chromatography, viral inactivation, 
nanofiltration, ultrafiltration and filtration for bioburden control before freezing and storage.
There is no reprocessing during active substance manufacturing.
One single cell culture provides one single harvest (intermediate) on which one single clarification is 
performed. From this, one single batch of RSVPreF3 bulk antigen is obtained by purification.  
The ranges of critical process parameters and the routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria, 
are described for each step.
The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable.
Control of Materials
The CHO cell line used was derived from a parental CHO cell line. Vials of the pre-Master Cell Bank (pre-MCB) 
were prepared in serum-free medium.
The RSVPreF3 protein is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells 
using a two-tiered Cell Bank System (i.e., Master Cell Bank and Working Cell Bank).
Two working cell banks (WCBs) were manufactured from the master cell bank (MCB) by the same supplier 
according to the same manufacturing process. End of production cells (EPC) has been generated from both 
WCBs.
The quality control and characterisation tests for MCB, WCBs and EPCs are presented. The tests include tests 
for adventitious agents, identity and purity and are considered in line with the relevant requirements of Ph. 
Eur. 5.2.3 on “Cell substrates for the production of vaccines for human use” and ICH Q5A (R1) and ICHQ5D. 
The methods used and results are presented. The specifications are sufficiently justified.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 15/103
Characterisation of the MCB, WCBs and EPC is presented in detail. Based on the provided information the cell 
substrate can be considered as being stable from the MCB stage up to the EPC stage within the commercial 
process. Overall, the Scientific Advices provided by the EMA have been sufficiently taken into account.
The composition of solutions and materials was provided. No human or animal-derived raw materials are 
used for the production of the RSVPreF3 Master Cell Bank, Working Cell Banks and Active Substance. 
Materials of human or animal-derived origin used in early steps of cell bank preparation have been 
adequately evaluated from a TSE and viral safety perspective (See adventitious agents section). All raw 
materials used in the active substance manufacturing process are obtained with certificates of analysis from 
their respective suppliers and confirmatory identity and/or release testing are undertaken as necessary. In-
house specifications for non-compendial raw materials have been included in Module 3. Information on 
significant consumables is provided as requested.
Control of critical steps and intermediates
Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active 
substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical quality attributes (QA), 
process parameters (PP) and in-process tests. The number of Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) is limited. 
However, the assignment of a parameter as being critical or non-critical, as well as their ranges are 
sufficiently justified. Filter integrity testing is performed after nanofiltration and bioburden reduction filtration. 
Acceptance criteria are provided. In case of filter failure, a deviation is opened and impact on product quality 
is assessed. 
The company performs Quality Control (QC) release tests on the single harvest intermediate isolated during 
the manufacturing process, on the active substance and on the finished product. A batch will be discarded if it 
fails to conform to its specifications.
The Single Harvest step marks the end of the cell culture before purification.  
Satisfactory quality control (QC) release testing results have been provided for RSVPreF3 single harvests 
used to prepare process performance qualification (PPQ) batches. This includes testing for bioburden, 
mycoplasma and extraneous agents. The indicated holding times of the eluates or filtrates are justified.  
Process Validation
The submitted validation studies comprise three full scale PPQ batches (manufactured according to the 
commercial process) in the commercial facility. The RSVPreF3 active substance manufacturing process has 
been validated adequately.
The assessment of comparability between the reference batches used in clinical studies and PPQ batches 
manufactured in commercial facilities was performed in accordance with the International Conference of 
Harmonisation (ICH) Q5E guideline (CPMP/ICH/5721/03). 
Active substance batches used for manufacturing of clinical batches were selected as reference batches to 
establish comparability with commercial material (see next paragraph). Subsequently so called non-GMP 
reproducibility batches or engineering batches have been manufactured to gain process knowledge and were 
used to confirm consistent process performance of the PPQ batches. 
The actual values for the process parameters applied for the three PPQ batches are provided and are within 
the indicated ranges and/or the acceptance criteria. All attributes evaluated on PPQ batches were shown to 
be comparable to reference batches, with some exceptions. These have been justified as being due to 
process changes and having no impact on the product quality attributes as well as product comparability. 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 16/103
RSVPreF3 quantity and recovery are consistent. Overall, the analysis supports the conclusion that the 
commercial process is reproducible and sufficiently controlled and able to deliver a consistent product quality. 
Manufacturing process development
The active substance manufacturing process has evolved during the clinical development of RSVPreF3 
vaccine. The manufacturing process of RSVPreF3 active substance used for production of the PPQ and first 
commercial active substance batches is described in detail.
A brief summary of the RSVPreF3 active substance manufacturing process development throughout the 
clinical development phases is provided. 
Detailed information on the four processes and the major changes during development are presented. The 
rationale for the changes is provided. The main changes introduced throughout development were scale-up, 
changes in antigen production to increase productivity, optimization for the chromatography steps, improve 
viral clearance robustness and transfer of the manufacturing to different facilities. Comparability has been 
established between the different RSVPreF3 DS batches used during clinical product development. Major 
changes between process Phase 3 (clinical) and commercial (PPQ) are discussed in sufficient detail and 
justified. Sufficient details on the changes applied on analytical methods and control strategy per critical 
quality attribute (CQA) are presented, respectively for Single Harvest and active substance.
Characterisation
The RSVPreF3 antigen is a recombinant fusion (F) surface glycoprotein, stabilised in the pre-fusion 
conformation of the naturally occurring F protein. 
The physico-chemical and immunological properties of the active substance were assessed using different 
complementary analytical techniques. Overall, the characterization testing panel is considered suited for its 
purpose and results are comprehensively presented. 
The tests performed on the RSVPreF3 active substance clinical Phase 3 batches and PPQ (and technical 
development batches manufactured according to the commercial process), briefly describe their objectives 
and results. Interim reference standard (IRS) batch was used as the reference material for the 
characterisation tests. For each method, the result is presented in pictures of gels, chromatograms 
(overlays), spectra or tables, where appropriate.
Analytical data on the secondary structure, tertiary structure, isoelectric focusing, primary sequence, post-
translational modifications and glycosylation patterns showed no major differences between the batches 
manufactured according to Phase 3 and commercial processes and the interim reference standard. 
Product-related impurities
Product related impurities (aggregates) and process related impurities (including host cell proteins and DNA) 
present in the AS have been investigated throughout manufacturing development including batches used in 
nonclinical and clinical studies. 
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The specifications include appropriate tests for identity and potency by ELISA, physicochemical properties 
(pH, Description), antigen content and product-related substances by RP-UPLC, antigen purity and high 
molecular weight species by SEC-UPLC, endotoxin content by chromogenic kinetic method and HCP by ELISA.  
There are no separate end-of-shelf life specifications for the active substance.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 17/103
The proposed specifications are sufficiently justified and reflect the results found for the active substance 
batches listed. 
The active substance specification for in-vitro relative potency has been tightened in line with the tightened 
finished product specification. The specification for the Product-related substance has been recalculated and 
tightened as requested. The quality control panel for active substance has been extended with specification 
for aggregates. 
Furthermore, an acceptance criterion on the bioburden before freezing in-process control has been assigned.  
Analytical methods
For compendial analytical procedures, the company has made reference to Ph. Eur. monographs (pH, 
endotoxin). All in-house analytical procedures for the QC release of commercially purified bulks have been 
validated according to the relevant ICH guideline Q2 (R1). 
The same non-compendial analytical procedure is used for testing of identity and in vitro relative potency and 
for quantification of purity and product related impurities for both the active substance and finished product. 
Also, for RSVPreF3 content and product related substances, the test is essentially the same. An RSV process 
specific analytical method for HCP quantification has been developed and is adequately validated and suited 
for its purpose.
The method descriptions of the assay for RSVPreF3, purity, product related impurities and HCP have been 
clarified upon request. The validation of these methods is considered acceptable, and the methods are suited 
for testing active substance batches. 
Unique method identifiers have been included in the dossier for all in-house methods. 
Batch analysis
Batch analysis data from PPQ batches of the active substance were provided, along with batch analysis data 
for batches manufactured for use in the clinical studies throughout the clinical development phases.  
The results of all QC tests comply with the acceptance criteria in force at the time of testing and confirm 
consistency of the manufacturing processes.
Reference materials
Reference standard (RS) used for the in vitro potency and purity release testing of commercial material is 
derived from a clinical Phase 3 drug substance batch.
Information as regards potential (re)qualification of future standards has been provided.
The generation of the RSFPreF3 process-specific HCP Reference Standard from a null cell line according to 
Phase 3 process has been described in sufficient detail and it has been demonstrated that it is a good 
representative of the commercial process and is suitable to be used as the reference standard for the 
determination of host cell proteins.
Container Closure System
RSVPreF3 Purified Bulks are stored in sterile bottles (1000 mL) that are closed with caps. These containers 
are supplied clean, non-pyrogenic and sterile. The Container Closure System is shown to be suitable for long 
term storage of RSVPreF3 purified bulk. No risks were identified with the safety risk assessment of the 
container components.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 18/103
2.4.2.4.  Stability
A shelf-life of the active substance when stored at the intended storage conditions is proposed by the 
Applicant.
The stability studies conducted in line with ICH guidance include three PPQ batches. Stability-indicating 
release tests are included in the stability protocol. Stability of the PPQ batches available to date show that all 
tested parameters met the acceptance criteria, after storage at proposed storage conditions. 
The long term stability data of three reproducibility batches and three PPQ batches manufactured according 
to the commercial process support the proposed shelf-life for commercial batches upon storage at proposed 
conditions.  Supportive long term stability data are available for batches used in clinical development, 
including those from Phase 3 clinical studies. Supportive batches are considered sufficiently representative of 
commercial batches, however, storage conditions differ from those proposed for the commercial product but 
are still considered relevant.
During product development, the impact of certain physico-chemical stressors on structure and antigen 
stability were evaluated. 
The stability results confirm that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life 
in the proposed container and storage conditions.
2.4.3.  Finished medicinal product
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development
RSVPreF3/AS01E vaccine is a preservative-free suspension for intramuscular injection intended for active 
immunisation in the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated lower respiratory tract disease 
(LRTD) in adults aged 60 years and older.
The vaccine consists of two components:


The lyophilised RSV recombinant fusion protein RSVPreF3 (trimeric RSV Fusion protein stabilised in a 
pre-fusion conformation). After reconstitution, 1 dose contains 120 micrograms of RSVPreF3 antigen. 
The RSVPreF3 antigen is provided as a mono-dose preparation.
The liquid suspension consists of the AS01E Adjuvant System. AS01E is provided as a mono-dose 
preparation.
The liquid AS01E Adjuvant System is used to reconstitute the RSVPreF3 lyophilised antigen immediately prior 
to administration. The pharmaceutical form of the reconstituted vaccine is a liquid suspension for injection, 
appearing opalescent, colourless to pale brownish. 
The final containers consist of a 3 mL glass vial (uncoloured glass, Type I) closed with a butyl rubber stopper 
and aluminium cap.
The full list of excipients is provided in section 2.2.1 above: trehalose dihydrate (cryo-protectant), 
polysorbate 80 (surfactant), potassium dihydrogen phosphate and dipotassium phosphate (buffering agents). 
An overage is applied to compensate for loss during reconstitution, withdrawal and injection. A proper 
justification indicating the amount of loss due to reconstitution, withdrawal, and injection has been included 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 19/103
in section 3.2.P.2.2.2.  The formulation development of the finished product has been described and mainly 
involved the adjustment of the trehalose concentration and the target pH of the final product.
The AS01E Adjuvant System is composed of two immune-enhancers, QS-21 (a triterpene glycoside purified 
from the bark of the tree Quillaja saponaria Molina) and MPL (3-Odesacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A), using 
liposomes as a vehicle. The liposomes are composed of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and cholesterol, 
in a phosphate-buffered saline solution. DOPC is a semi-synthetic phospholipid and the key component of the 
liposomal bilayer membranes. Cholesterol serves to improve the rigidity of the structure and quenches the 
haemolytic activity of QS-21.
Pharmaceutical development
Three different formulations of RSVPreF3 (30 μg, 60 μg and 120 μg/dose), each reconstituted with either 
AS01B (50 μg MPL and QS-21 per dose), AS01E (25 μg MPL and QS-21 per dose) or unadjuvanted diluent 
(i.e. NaCl), were evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (RSV older adults=ADJ-002) to define the optimal 
dosage of recombinant protein. The 120 μg dosage with AS01E was selected for further development and 
subsequent clinical studies based on an optimal immunogenicity profile and acceptable tolerability.
The finished product manufacturing process has evolved during the clinical development of RSVPreF3 
vaccine. A brief summary of the RSVPreF3 finished product manufacturing process development throughout 
the development phases is provided.
The changes between the processes were mainly related to use of active substance from different active 
substance manufacturing processes (please refer to the active substance development section), changes in 
equipment, adaptation of the holding time of final bulk, change of manufacturing facility and scale, increase 
of fill volume, change of formulation (concentration of trehalose and antigen, target pH). The lyophilisation 
cycle has been optimised from Phase 3 to commercial process. The processes are sufficiently described and 
justified. A clear overview has been provided where it is shown which batch numbers were manufactured with 
which process, and, at which facility. Also, an overview has been provided where it is shown which batches 
were used in which clinical study. Information on analytical comparability of Final Container (FC) product 
manufactured according to Phase 3 and commercial processes, respectively, could be found in Section 
3.2.P.3.5 (discussed below).
Critical Quality Attributes have been identified by a technical risk assessment. In line with Guideline ICH Q8 a 
QTPP (Quality Target Product Profile) has been presented. Critical Process Parameters (CPP) have been 
defined as PPs that can impact one or more CQAs. The assignment of CPPs for Formulation, Filling and 
Lyophilisation was mainly based on prior product and process knowledge, which is considered acceptable. 
The suitability of the container closure system has been sufficiently justified. Extractables studies were 
performed, and no extractable compounds were present at levels that would be considered a safety risk. 
Results for the leachables study are available for up to 12 months and the study is ongoing for up to 60 
months. The Applicant has committed to submitting the Leachable study results when available (REC 1).
Compatibility between the adjuvant and RSVPreF3 have been shown by interaction studies between 
RSVPreF3 antigen and the adjuvant and by control of several CQAs. Additional data have been submitted that 
support the storage of 4 hours at 2 – 8 °C. the claimed in-use stability of 4 hours at 2 – 8 °C or 25°C is 
considered acceptable.

EMA/227054/2023

2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls
The manufacturing process of the RSVPreF3 finished product consists of 1) Formulation of the Final Bulk, 2) 
Filling and Lyophilisation, 3) Labelling and Packaging. Formulation, filling, primary packaging and 
lyophilisation takes place at GSK Biologicals, Wavre, Belgium (Wavre Nord).  The EU batch release site is 
Glaxosmithkline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium. Both sites hold valid GMP certificates.
Flow diagrams for the Formulation and the Filling and Lyophilisation steps and a narrative description of the 
manufacturing process have been provided. An overview of Critical Process Parameters has been provided. It 
is indicated where in the process In Process testing is carried out and holding times are indicated. No 
reprocessing is proposed. There are no intermediates defined in the manufacturing process of RSVPreF3 
finished product.
Upon request, several parameters have been added to the description of the manufacturing process. The 
description of the manufacturing process is sufficiently detailed. The filter material of each filter in contact 
with the finished product or components of the finished product and filter area of the final sterilising finished 
product filter have been provided. 
The conditions used for sterilisation of the vials and the stoppers have been provided. The sterilization of the 
stoppers is in line with the reference conditions as stated in the Ph. Eur 5.1.1. For the sterilization of the vials 
this is not the case. Satisfactory validation data are therefore submitted for the validation of the sterilisation 
process of the vials.  The control of CQAs by Quality Release, Process Monitoring, Characterisation or Quality 
Decision testing has been clearly justified. In Process testing is performed at four steps in the manufacturing 
process. Before sterile filtration, a test for bioburden is performed. The limit of the test (nmt 10 CFU/100mL 
is in line with the Guideline on the sterilisation of the medicinal product, active substance, excipient and 
primary container (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015). For the sterile filtration step, only a post-use 
integrity test was carried out on the filter. The applicant has agreed, upon request, to implement pre-use 
filter integrity testing of the sterilising filter prior to release in the EU market. The principle of the test, details 
on when the tests are performed, solution(s) used in the test and acceptance criteria before and after 
filtration have been provided in section 3.2.P.3.4.
A brief description of the shipping process of RSVPreF3 finished product has been included in the dossier. This 
is acceptable.
For process validation purposes, an appropriate number of consecutive lots were produced. Three consecutive 
final bulk PPQ runs were successfully completed for formulation process and seven consecutive DP PPQ runs 
were successfully and consecutively executed for filling and lyophilization processes. A bracketing matrix 
approach was followed in order to validate the ranges for formulation and filling volumes, holding time and 
pooling of different active substance batches.
All the batches used in the Phase 3 older adults clinical study were used as reference batches in the 
comparability study. Overall, it has been demonstrated that the PPQ batches are comparable to these Phase 
3 clinical batches, with some exception due to the change in holding time. However, difference was within the 
acceptance limits and therefore considered acceptable. Also, data demonstrating comparability with the 
earlier process versions are presented. It can be concluded that the manufacturing process is in a state of 
control and results are consistent and meet the specifications. 
Hold time validation studies were performed with two small scale and one full-scale lot to support the storage 
of Final Bulk. The proposed maximum hold time for the Final Bulk is considered validated. The results from 
the PPQ also support this. 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 21/103
Aseptic filling is considered appropriately validated using media simulation. The filling operation is considered 
validated for a maximum duration. Final sterile filtration validation was performed by a bacterial challenge 
test, under worst-case conditions. In line with the Guideline on the sterilisation of the medicinal product, 
active substance, excipient and primary container (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015), an acceptable 
minimum retention capacity has been shown. Also, other information relevant for filter validation is provided 
(type of filters, growth promoting/inhibiting properties of product matrix, potential sorption to the filter, 
compatibility with the solution, as well as extractables and leachables). 
Control of Excipients
Specifications of the compendial excipients purchased from commercial suppliers are complying with the 
current editions of European and other pharmacopoeias, as applicable, which covers the justification of the 
specifications.
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The specifications cover Description, pH, osmolality, Identity and potency (by ELISA), content of RSVPreF3 
(RP-UPLC), endotoxins (chromogenic kinetic method), water content (Karl Fischer), RSVPreF3 timer and High 
molecular weight species (SEC-UPLC) Polysorbate 80 (HPLC) and Trehalose (H-NM). 
The appearance testing includes testing for clarity and colour by an in-house method, using Ph. Eur 
standards. The specification for content accounts for product related substances.  Product related substances 
are not included as a separate attribute in finished product release specifications, but a separate specification 
is present at active substance level, which is acceptable. The justification for not including reconstitution time 
in the specifications, based on the development data, is considered acceptable. Visible particulates are not 
controlled at release but are controlled by a QD test on the FC which is acceptable. Sub-visible particulate 
contamination should be principally controlled at release in accordance with Ph. Eur. 0520. However, 
considering the intramuscular route of administration, the type of product, and the consistently low levels in 
the clinical lots and PPQ lots, control by a characterisation test is acceptable. Shelf-life acceptance criteria for 
stability indicating tests are the same as at release. Polysorbate 80 content is not controlled at shelf life. It 
has been sufficiently shown that polysorbate 80 content is stable over the proposed shelf life of RSVPreF3 
finished product. 
The acceptance limits for description, pH for the lyophilised vaccine and osmolality are considered acceptable. 
The acceptance criteria for potency and content are based on the batches that were used in the older adults 
clinical studies and are considered properly justified. 
The limit of water content is supported by stability data. The limit is in line with Ph. Eur 0153 Vaccines for 
Human use. The acceptance limits for endotoxin, trehalose and PS-80 are acceptable.
Analytical methods
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. pH, endotoxin and sterility are tested according to Ph. Eur 
methods. Osmolality is tested according to the USP method; a justification that the procedure is equivalent to 
the procedure described in Ph. Eur. monograph 2.2.35 has been provided). For description, in-house methods 
are used using Ph. Eur standards. The same analytical procedure is used for testing of RSVPreF3 content    
for both active substance and finished product. Also, the in vitro relative potency test   is used for both active 
substance and finished product. This test also serves as a test for identity.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 22/103
The methods for identity and potency, content and purity were validated for finished product batches. 
Validation results were in line with the results for active substance. All results complied, and it was shown 
that the methods are suitable for their intended purpose.
The endotoxin test is not validated as it is a compendial method. However, for products that contain a 
combination of polysorbate and phosphate, Low Endotoxin Recovery (LER) can occur. Therefore, the 
applicant has performed a LER study. No LER effect has been observed for the Final Product.   
For all methods in section 3.2.P.5.1. a reference to the method used is made, including a method reference 
number. The method reference number is also be included in section 3.2.P.5.2 and section 3.2.P.5.3 in order 
to maintain a clear link between specifications, methods and method validations. 
The information provided on the assay for identity and in vitro relative potency and on the assay for 
RSVPreF3 content in section 3.2.P.5.2 has been expanded upon request with aspects that are relevant for the 
validity of the method. The description of the chromatography methods has been expanded to include the 
chromatography conditions and representative chromatograms. For all methods, the system suitability 
criteria are in place, which are included in the SOPs, but are not included in section 3.2.P.5.2. Considering the 
extensive description of the system suitability criteria in the SOPs, this is considered acceptable. 
Batch analysis
Batch analysis data have been provided for the PPQ batches of the finished product along with batch analysis 
data for batches manufactured for use in the clinical studies throughout the clinical development phases as 
well as lots used in the toxicological studies. Results complied with acceptance criteria at the time of testing. 
Impurities
Impurities are not further characterised or discussed for finished product as they are covered in process-
related impurities and product-related impurities covered in the active substance section. A nitrosamines risk 
assessment was conducted on RSVPreF3 finished product. The risk assessment is provided in 3.2.R 
Nitrosamines risk assessment RSVPreF3 and concludes that the risk of nitrosamines being present in 
RSVPreF3 active substance and finished product is negligible. 
It is noted that ICHQ3D is not applicable to vaccines, and they are excluded from the scope. However, the 
updated Ph.Eur. monograph on pharmaceutical preparations (2619) states that for products outside the 
scope of general chapter 5.20 (which makes the ICH guideline binding in Ph.Eur), manufacturers of these 
products remain responsible for controlling the levels of elemental impurities using the principles of risk 
management. Elemental impurities are monitored in the leachables study, and this was deemed sufficient. 
According to the results, a toxicological assessment all compounds are below the PDE (Permitted Daily 
Exposure) or the TTC (threshold of toxicological concern) using ICP/OES to detect elemental impurities.
Reference materials
The reference standard is used as quantitative reference standard in the test for content and the test for 
potency. Qualification of the Reference standard is described in section 3.2 S.5. A protocol for future 
reference Standards is provided in section 3.2.R.
Container closure
The glass vials are manufactured with Type I colourless glass and are compliant with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1. The type 
I butyl rubber stoppers are compliant with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. The dimensions of the vials and stoppers are

provided. The suppliers of vial, stopper and flip-off cap have been provided and representative certificates of 
analysis have been submitted. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product
A shelf-life of 24 months at +2°C to +8°C for RSVPreF3 Final Container filled in 3 mL 1-dose Type I glass vial 
is proposed. 
The claimed shelf life is based on stability data for Phase 3 clinical lots (considered fully representative of the 
commercial lots). Real time stability data are available for up to 24 months for one lot, up to 18 months for 
three lots and up to 12 months for four lots and were conducted in line with ICH guidance. No degradation is 
observed for the parameters tested, except for water content, which increases. This increase in moisture is 
expected for a lyophilised product. It has been sufficiently justified that water content will remain below the 
acceptance criterion after 24 months, even for batches that are at the specification limit at release. 
The accelerated stability study confirmed the increase of aggregates with the increase of the temperature, as 
was also seen in stressed studies. Also an increase in water content is seen. Other parameters, like in vitro 
relative potency, remain stable when exposed to higher temperatures.
After reconstitution with AS01E adjuvant and incubation for 16 hours at +20°C ± 5°C or +25°C ± 5°C or 
+5°C ± 3°C for 4 hours, no effect is seen on pH and in vitro relative potency. Once reconstituted, chemical 
and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours at 2 °C – 8 °C or at room temperature up to 
25 °C. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and should 
not be longer than 4 hours.
The Applicant concludes that the results of the Temperature cycling study show that the finished product 
vaccine sustains exposure to temperature excursion for up to six months at +25°C + 2°C and 3 months at 
+40°C + 2°C. This conclusion is agreed. However, the product is authorised for storage at 2-8 °C for up to 
24 months. 
During product development, the impact of certain physico-chemical stressors on structure and antigen 
stability were evaluated. These stress factors included those that might be more relevant to real world 
manufacturing process and stability conditions. It included light exposure (photostability). RSVPreF3 finished 
product is sensitive to light exposure. A statement regarding protection from light is included in the SmPC, 
product leaflet and outer carton (i.e., “Store in the original package in order to protect from light”).
Based on the long-term stability data, the claimed shelf life of 24 months at +2°C to +8°C is acceptable for 
the RSVPreF3 Final Container.
2.4.4.  Finished medicinal product - AS01E adjuvant vial  
2.4.4.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development - AS01E adjuvant vial
The commercial presentation of AS01E (adjuvant system) is a monodose vial. This finished product 
component is an opalescent, colourless to pale brownish suspension for injection containing the following 
excipients: QS-21, MPL, dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine; cholesterol; sodium chloride; disodium phosphate 
anhydrous; potassium dihydrogen phosphate; water for injections. The target fill volume includes an overfill 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 24/103
which ensures a nominal injection volume of 0.5 mL. The primary packaging is a type I glass vial with butyl 
rubber stopper. 
The AS01E Adjuvant System is composed of two immuno-enhancers, QS-21 (a triterpene glycoside purified 
from the bark of the tree Quillaja saponaria Molina) and MPL (3-Odesacyl- 4’-monophosphoryl lipid A), using 
liposomes as a vehicle. MPL is a purified, non-toxic endotoxin derivative prepared from the lipopolysaccharide 
of the R595 strain of Salmonella minnesota and is a compendial excipient. 
The liposomes are composed of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and cholesterol, in phosphate-buffered 
saline solution. DOPC is a semi-synthetic phospholipid and the key component of the liposomal bilayer 
membranes. Cholesterol serves to improve the rigidity of the structure and quenches haemolytic activity of 
QS-21.
2.4.4.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls - AS01E adjuvant vial
The AS01E adjuvant is produced at GSK Bio (Wavre Nord), Avenue Fleming 20, Wavre Belgium or GSK 
Vaccines (Rosia), Bellaria Rosia, 53018 Sovicille, Italy. 
The manufacturing process of the AS01E Adjuvant System is composed of the following steps: Preparation of 
CLB, preparation of QS-21 LB; Formulation of AS01E FB; Sterile filtration and Filling to produce AS01E FC. 
Reprocessing is not described and thus, not allowed. The description of the manufacturing process is 
acceptable.  
The control strategy is described and aims to ensure consistent product quality and process performance. The 
process parameter ranges are sufficiently justified by process development and characterisation data and/or 
process performance qualification data. Some CPPs differ between the Rosia and the Wavre site - adequate 
justifications have been provided. Action limits and alert limits have been provided and justified for the fill 
volume/weight. The action limits for fill volume/weight range have been included in Module 3. At GSK Rosia 
pre- and post-use integrity testing of the sterile filter has been implemented, whereas at GSK Wavre only a 
post-use integrity test was carried out. The applicant has agreed, upon request, to implement pre-use filter 
integrity testing of the sterilising filter prior to release in the EU market. For both sites, the principle of the 
integrity test, details on when the tests are performed, solution(s) used in the test and acceptance criteria 
before and after filtration have been included in Module 3.
Detailed information on the validation of all different process steps is provided, including the production of 
concentrated liposome bulk (CLB), production of QS21 Liquid Bulk (QS-21 LB), formulation, sterile filtration 
and filling. Homogeneity in terms of filling volume has been demonstrated. The sterile filter has been 
adequately validated. A brief summary of the shipping validation has been provided. Long-term stability 
studies of CLB batches confirm stability for up to 24 months at 2 to 8°C. Stability data support the holding of 
AS01E Final Bulk (FB) for up to 30 days at 2 to 8°C in a stainless steel vessel or standard universal vessels. 
Control of Excipients
Specifications of the compendial excipients purchased from commercial suppliers comply with the current 
editions of pharmacopoeias, as applicable, which covers the justification of the specifications. The semi-
synthetic, plant-derived cholesterol complies with Ph. Eur. 0993; a commitment to switch to cholesterol that 
fully complies with Ph. Eur. 2397 (cholesterol for parenteral use) by March 2024 has been provided (REC 3). 
Specifications for Quality Release testing of QS-21 and DOPC are justified. 
The AS01E adjuvant system does not contain novel excipients or excipients of human or animal origin.

Development - AS01E adjuvant vial
The adjuvant AS01E as well as AS01B belong to the Applicant´s proprietary liposomal AS01 adjuvant system 
family. QS-21, DOPC and cholesterol were previously approved as excipients for the AS01B adjuvant (applied 
for Shingrix) which contains a double amount of MPL, QS-21, DOPC and cholesterol compared to AS01E. The 
manufacturing process and specifications for the different adjuvant components of AS01E and AS01B, i.e. 
MPL, QS-21, DOPC and cholesterol, are identical (only the amount of the components in the final adjuvant 
composition differs). Note that the previous development Series of AS01E are used during the development 
and clinical studies of Mosquirix vaccine (approved via Article 58 procedure).
The overfill (to ensure a nominal dose of 0.5 mL) is adequately justified and the justification is included in 
Module 3.
Important physicochemical and biological properties of the AS01E adjuvant system are adequately described 
in the dossier. The manufacturing process of AS01E Adjuvant System has been developed through the 
implementation of a “Series” of manufacturing processes, which reflect changes applied to the manufacture 
of the intermediates, AS01 formulation or filling, from one “Series” to the next one. RSVPreF3/AS01E Phase 
III studies have been performed with AS01E Series 13.   
The most significant changes applied to the manufacturing of AS01E Adjuvant System between Phase 3 
clinical development and commercial manufacturing are: transfer of the manufacturing process to the 
commercial facilities; scale-up of the AS01E formulation step; change of storage containers for intermediates. 
No changes to the formulation (ingredients) of AS01E have been indicated.
Establishment and evolution of the analytical control strategy for the intermediates CLB and QS-21 LB as well 
as for AS01E FB and FC product are adequately described.
2.4.4.3.  Product Specifications - AS01E adjuvant vial
The AS01E FP specification is shown below and includes appropriate tests for identity, physicochemical 
properties, content of adjuvant constituents, impurities and sterility that are compliant with Ph. Eur. All of the 
tests, with the exception of MPL content, volume and osmolality, are also performed during the ongoing 
stability studies. The proposed specifications are sufficiently justified. The Applicant´s proposal to a 
commitment to re-evaluate the specification limits when data from more than 30 lots are available is 
endorsed (REC 2).
Analytical methods- AS01E adjuvant vial
Descriptions of the analytical methods were provided. The method descriptions have been expanded to 
include relevant information (injection sequence and representative chromatogram).  The analytical methods 
are identified by method identifiers in Sections 3.2.P.5.1, 3.2.P.5.2, and 3.2.P.5.3. All methods have been 
appropriately validated.
Batch analysis- AS01E adjuvant vial
The presented batch release data for the subsequent AS01E adjuvant Series 10, A, B, 13, and C are within 
specifications and demonstrate product consistency. Series 13 AS01E lots has been used in RSV clinical 
studies for older adults, while Series C lots are considered representative of future commercial batches. Four 
Series C lots are manufactured at the Rosia site and one at the Wavre Nord site. Overall, the batch data 
confirm consistent production.

Characterisation of impurities AS01E adjuvant vial
The potential impurities in AS01E adjuvant system and their control strategy have been presented. Possible 
impurities are controlled at release of AS01E or at release of the raw materials. The low levels of impurities 
that may be present in AS01E FC are clinically qualified and do not pose any safety concerns. An adequate 
risk assessment for potential N-nitrosamine contaminants that reveals an acceptable low risk is provided 
under 3.2.R. Impurities have been studied in nonclinical and clinical studies. 
Reference materials-AS01E adjuvant vial
For the quantification of MPL, DOPC and cholesterol, reference standards obtained from commercial suppliers 
are used. There is only one in-house standard. This QS-21 reference standard is used for quality control 
release testing of the QS-21 Liquid bulk and the AS01E Final container (QS-21 content and QS-21-H limit test 
by HPLC). The comparability protocol for future QS-21 standards is presented and satisfactory. 
Container closure AS01E adjuvant vial
The liquid formulation is filled in 3 mL vial containers, sealed with 13 mm butyl stoppers for liquid 
formulations and secured with flip-off caps. The sterilization of the stoppers is in line with the reference 
conditions as stated in the Ph. Eur 5.1.1. For the sterilization of the vials and for sterilization of the stoppers, 
this is not the case. Therefore, as requested, validation data are submitted for the validation of the 
sterilization conditions. Representative certificates of analysis have been submitted for vial and stopper.
2.4.4.4.  Stability of the product- AS01E adjuvant vial
The Applicant proposes a shelf-life of 36 months at 2-8°C for AS01E Adjuvant System (1-dose) filled in 3 mL 
glass vials.
The major part of the available stability data comprises the 60 months stability data of previous Series 10, A 
and B (2-dose) and 18 months data of Series 13 (used for clinical studies of older adults). To date only nine 
months real time stability data are available for PPQ FC lots (Series C, 1-dose): one GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals SA Wavre Nord, Belgium lots and three GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines S.r.l. Sovicille, Italy FC lots.
The Applicant concludes that the results of the temperature cycling study show that the AS01E sustains 
exposure to temperature excursion for up to 14 days at 25°C or days at 37 °C during the 36 months shelf-
life. This conclusion is agreed. 
Photostability data demonstrate that AS01E is not sensitive to light. 
The shelf life 36 months at 2-8°C for AS01E Adjuvant System (1-dose) is acceptable based on the stability 
demonstrated for previous series of AS01E.
Because the shorter shelf-life of the finished product vial containing RSVPreF3, this medicinal product has an 
overall 2 year shelf-life when stored in a refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C) as stated in the SmPC
2.4.5.  Post approval change management protocols 
Not applicable.

2.4.6.  Adventitious agents
The strategy used to ensure that the RSVPreF3 active substance and finished product are free of adventitious 
agents is in compliance with the relevant EU viral safety and TSE requirements and includes: control of raw 
materials; testing of the MCB and WCB, as well as end of production cells; in-process testing of harvest for 
adventitious agents and bacterial contamination and viral clearance validation studies.
Raw materials of animal origin were used for the first steps of cell bank system development (up to the pre-
Master cell bank). A satisfactory evaluation of adventitious agents has been provided for these. The risk of 
TSE contamination is considered negligible due to the origin of the raw materials and the TSE certificates. The 
risk of other adventitious agent contamination is considered limited due to the process steps. 
With the exception of casamino acids, which are used during the production process of MPL (AS01 Adjuvant 
System), no materials from human or animal origin are used in the manufacturing process of active 
substance or finished product. This source of casamino acids is compliant with current EU TSE guidelines.
The active substance manufacturing process contains various steps that were shown to contribute to virus 
removal/inactivation (chromatography steps, viral inactivation, nanofiltration). Virus removal/inactivation was 
properly validated in scale-down models using appropriate model viruses. The results confirm that the 
purification process has an adequate viral clearance capacity. In combination with the testing of starting 
materials and intermediates this viral clearance capacity reduces the risk of viral contamination to a very low 
and acceptable level.
2.4.7.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects
The dossier of Arexvy is of good quality. The Active Substance and Final Product manufacturing processes 
have been clearly described and critical process parameters have been identified and justified. The control 
strategy, including in-process controls and release testing, is considered acceptable. The proposed shelf life 
for Active Substance and Final Product are supported by data and are considered acceptable.
Comparability has been shown between the batches used in Phase 3 clinical studies and PPQ batches 
manufactured according to the commercial manufacturing process. Process validation is considered adequate, 
and it can be concluded that the manufacturing process is in a state of control and results in the manufacture 
of batches that are consistent and meet the specifications.
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to the leachable study, specification limits for the 
adjuvant and full compliance with cholesterol for parenteral use. These points are put forward and agreed as 
recommendations for future quality development. 
2.4.8.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 28/103
2.4.9.  Recommendations for future quality development  
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation:
- The applicant is recommended to submit the Leachable study results for the finished product when available 
(REC 1).
- The specification limits for AS01E finished product (adjuvant) should be reviewed and submitted when data 
from more than 30 representative lots manufactured according to the commercial process are available (REC 
2).
- The applicant should demonstrate full compliance with cholesterol for parenteral use (Ph. Eur. monograph 
2397) by March 2024 (REC 3).
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects
2.5.1.  Introduction
The Applicant proposes a protein vaccine for active immunisation of adults ≥ 60 years (i.e., non-naïve 
population) to boost RSV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and prevent RSV infection-related 
lower respiratory tract disease. The proposed RSV vaccine is composed of a trimeric RSV fusion protein 
stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation (RSVPreF3) and the AS01 adjuvant system (AS01E) containing the 
immunoenhancers QS-21 and MPL in a liposomal vehicle with DOPC and cholesterol.
2.5.2.  Pharmacology
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The non-clinical PD package consists of five studies; three studies to show the immunogenicity of the vaccine 
and the justification of the adjuvant, two studies to support manufacturing development (characterisation). 
Extensive data on the adjuvant system AS01 and the specific components QS-21 and MPL are not provided. 
GSK refers to their dossier of Shingrix, for which the adjuvant system was assessed in detail. Considering 
that AS01 in the currently proposed RSV vaccine is not a new adjuvant, the absence of study reports in this 
MAA but reference to the Shingrix MAA is acceptable.
Immunogenicity studies
The Applicant has submitted three primary PD studies to characterise the immunogenicity of the PreF3-AS01E 
vaccine in mice and two immuno-characterization studies. For four of these studies, young adult female 
CB6F1 mice (6-8 weeks old), naïve to RSV, have been immunised three times with RSVPreF antigen with or 
without adjuvant. In contrast, the human target population is non-naïve to RSV infection and ≥ 60 years old, 
and the vaccine will be used as a single dose. The Applicant has thoroughly explained that the non-clinical 
studies are only intended to show immunogenicity and not to evaluate vaccine efficacy, because a good 
animal model that can mimic the intended human non-naïve elderly target population and the sensitivity to 
RSV-related disease upon infection is not present. Although cows can be infected with bovine RSV, which is 
genetically related to human RSV and can cause recurrent infections, the relevance and similarity of certain 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 29/103
(adjuvant-induced) immune responses and immunosenescence in these animals to humans is still unknown. 
Therefore, the Applicant stated that the non-clinical PD package was only aiming “to evaluate the need for an 
adjuvant system in the protein vaccine, and to support the choice of the AS01 adjuvant system in the vaccine 
formulation with the PreF antigen to elicit potent F-specific CD4+ T cell responses and RSV neutralising 
antibodies”. A further selection of the final formulation and determination of vaccine efficacy (i.e., protection 
against RSV infection and related disease) in both males and females was performed in the clinical studies. 
This approach can be endorsed. The non-clinical PD studies can thus only be regarded as proof-of-concept 
immunogenicity studies.
The first study (20160092-0094) was conducted to justify the need for an adjuvant. Mice received 2 μg 
RSVPreF3 alone or in combination with 50 μg AlOH, 10 μg AS01B or an unknown amount of AS03A. 
Immunisation with RSV antigen alone was not very immunogenic. In combination with especially AS01B, 
RSVPreF3 induced F-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and RSV-specific neutralising antibody titres 
after the second and third vaccination and induced proinflammatory cytokines as measured after the first and 
second vaccination.
The second study (20160201) was performed to select the most appropriate antigen dose for the subsequent 
proof-of-concept study. Mice were immunised with 2 μg, 0.5 μg or 0.125 μg RSVPreF2 in combination with 10 
μg (AS01B) or 5 μg (AS01E) adjuvant or immunised with 2 μg, 0.5 μg or 0.125 μg RSVPreF3 in combination 
with 10 μg (AS01B) adjuvant. Both AS01-adjuvanted PreF antigens induced cellular and humoral responses 
against RSV in naïve animals after the second and third immunisation. PreF2 induced higher T cell 
frequencies, while higher neutralising antibody titres were elicited with PreF3. 0.5 μg antigen was selected as 
the dose for the subsequent proof-of-concept study, based on a good balance between non-saturating 
responses and sufficient intensity of the responses.
The final proof-of-concept study (20170126-0174) compared antigens PreF2 and PreF3, non-adjuvanted or 
when combined with different AS01 doses. Mice received 0.5 μg RSVPreF2 in combination with 10 μg (AS01B) 
or 5 μg (AS01E) adjuvant, or received 0.5 μg RSVPreF3 in combination with 10 μg (AS01B), 5 μg (AS01E) or 
2.5 μg (AS01F) adjuvant. The RSVPreF antigens alone were poorly immunogenic, while RSVPreF2 and 
RSVPreF3 in combination with AS01 induced both B and T cell responses after the second and third 
immunisation. Higher T cell frequencies in the spleen and lung were induced with PreF2, while higher 
neutralising antibody titres and preF conformation-restricted site Ф-specific IgGs were elicited with PreF3. In 
general, there was no considerable difference in the height of the immune response between the adjuvant 
formulations, although AS01B induced slightly higher CD4+ T cell frequencies in the spleen compared to lower 
adjuvant doses.
In the immunogenicity studies, the Applicant also paid attention to clinical signs post-immunisation. Apart 
from the occurrence of abnormal gait in several animals (a consequence of injection in gastrocnemius 
muscle), no clinical observations were noted in these PD studies.
Immunocharacterisation studies
The Applicant has also conducted two characterisation studies in mice to support the manufacturing process 
and quality of the vaccine material.
One study (cov 0100-18) was conducted to characterise the immunogenicity of lyophilised GMP drug product 
material for clinical study Phase 1/2. For this study, Balb/c mice were used. These mice were immunised 
twice with 3 μg, 1.5 μg or 0.75 μg RSVPreF3-AS01B (i.e., 1/10th, 1/20th and 1/40th of the lowest human dose 
used in clinical study RSV OA=ADJ-002). After the second immunisation, a dose-dependent neutralising 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 30/103
antibody response was observed, with a ≥ 4-fold increase in individual titres in mice from the highest dose 
group. The GMP lot was therefore considered immunogenic and useful for Phase 1/2 clinical trial.
Another study (20180258) was performed to determine the impact of p27 present in RSVPreF3 trimers on 
the immunogenicity of the vaccine formulation. P27 is a 27 amino acid peptide that is removed during 
maturation, but some trimers still contain this peptide on one of the three F proteins. The immunogenicity of 
batches containing 100% p27-RSVPreF3 trimers was compared to batches with 100% fully cleaved RSVPreF3 
trimers and to batches containing a mix of fully and non-fully cleaved trimers. CB6F1 mice were immunised 
with 0.5 μg RSVPreF3 combined with 5 μg AS01E. Mean group immune responses for p27-containing trimers 
(100% batch) were non-inferior to responses for fully cleaved trimers (100% or mixed batches) after the 
second and third immunisation. It was, however, noted that a mixed batch with DS material representative 
for Phase 3 induced higher neutralising antibody responses (but similar T cell responses) compared to the 
other material tested (i.e., produced with an earlier production process). The Applicant did not further explain 
the differences between the tested batches with respect to the representativeness for clinical material. 
Considering the analytical results of the corresponding batch, this material had a lower % RSVPreF3 lacking 
site Ф-binding by D25 Fab compared to the other batches used in this study (Table 15 of module 3.2.S.3.1). 
This explains why differences in neutralising antibody titres but not in cellular frequencies were observed with 
this Phase 3 representative batch.
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies
The absence of secondary PD studies can be endorsed.
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme
The absence of dedicated safety PD studies can be endorsed.
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions
The absence of dedicated PD drug interaction studies can be endorsed.
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics
No dedicated PK or ADME studies for RSVPreF3 OA are performed. This is endorsed.
The adjuvant system AS01 is not a novel adjuvant, since several products using the adjuvant system have 
already been registered (a.o., Shingrix, using AS01B). Therefore, no new biodistribution studies with the total 
adjuvant system or with the included immunoenhancers are required.
2.5.4.  Toxicology
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity
No single dose toxicity studies are performed with RSVPreF3 alone or adjuvanted with AS01B. This is 
acceptable.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 31/103
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity
Two GLP-compliant repeated dose toxicity studies (and) were conducted in New Zealand White rabbits 
(10/sex/group), which received three intramuscular injections (Day 1, Day 15 and Day 29, followed by a 4-
week recovery period.) In study COV 8363131, animals were administered saline, RSVPreF3 (120 µg, 0.5 
mL) or RSVPreF3 adjuvanted with AS01B (120 µg, 0.5 mL). In study COV 8384096, saline, RSVPreF3 (240 
µg, 0.5 mL) or RSVPreF3 adjuvanted with AS01B (240 µg, 0.5 mL). The antigen dose is the same as (study 
COV 8363131) or twice (COV 8384096) the intended clinical dose, however, the clinical formulation is 
adjuvanted with AS01E instead of AS01B (120 μg RSVPreF3 with 0.5 mL AS01E). AS01B contains a double 
dose of (the same) immuno-enhancers compared to AS01E; therefore, the adjuvant dose can be considered 
more than the clinical dose. This is acceptable. 
Levels of anti-RSVPreF3 IgG antibodies were increased (measured at Day 32 and 57) in 80% of females and 
all males administered RSVPreF3 and in 80-90% of females and all males administered RSVPreF3 adjuvanted 
with AS01B in the first study. In the study with twice the human dose, all animals receiving antigen showed 
an increase in anti-RSVPreF3 IgG antibodies. Antibody titres were higher in the adjuvanted group compared 
to the non-adjuvanted group. No seroconversion was observed in the saline group.
The vaccine resulted in effects on clinical pathology parameters and histopathology that are consistent with 
immune stimulation following administration of a vaccine, amongst others changes in white blood cell and 
absolute neutrophil counts, minimally to mildly decreased albumin, increased lymph node weights (ileac and 
popliteal), CRP and fibrinogen. No consistent effect was observed on body temperature (measured at 6, 24 
and 48h).
Local effects at the injection site included minimal to slight myofiber degeneration/necrosis and minimal to 
moderate mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates, and were in general, more severe in the adjuvanted RSVPreF3 
group.
At the end of the recovery period, all effects were resolved or reduced in incidence and/or severity.
In both studies, the Applicant has calculated safety margins based on the antigen content and standard mean 
body weight. However, common allometric rules do not apply to a local immune response. Moreover, the 
analysis of a NOAEL is not an adequate approach, as inflammatory reactions at the site of injection will occur 
and will be needed for an adequate immune response (i.e., absence of toxicity is not the intention of a 
vaccine-related toxicity study). Nevertheless, the absolute human dose (or twice the human dose) was used 
for the repeated dose toxicity studies, which is sufficient. From the results of these studies, no clinical safety 
issues are expected.
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity
The absence of genotoxicity studies is accepted. This is not required for vaccines.
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity
The absence of carcinogenicity studies is accepted and not required for vaccines.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 32/103
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity
Considering the age of the target population, in principle, the absence of reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies is acceptable.
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data
The absence of toxicokinetic studies for RSVPreF3/AS01 can be endorsed.
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance 
The absence of a dedicated local tolerance study for RSVPreF3/AS01 can be endorsed. Local tolerance was 
evaluated as part of the repeat dose GLP toxicology studies in rabbits with RSVPreF3 adjuvanted with AS01B.
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies
The absence of additional toxicity studies is acceptable.
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
In accordance with CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100 entitled "Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use" published 01 June 2006, due to their nature, vaccines are 
unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, the absence of an environmental risk 
assessment is agreed with.
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
Clinical relevance of primary PD studies
The non-clinical studies described here have shown the immunogenicity of adjuvanted RSVPreF3 antigen in 
naïve mice. Thereby, it can be concluded that 1) an adjuvant is needed in the vaccine formulation for proper 
T and B cell responses, 2) the AS01 adjuvant system is an appropriate adjuvant for enhancing RSVPreF-
induced immune responses, with no considerable difference between AS01B and AS01E, 3) RSVPreF3 induces 
neutralising antibodies against RSV (including the pre-fusion epitope site Ø) and F-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cell responses, 4) the GMP material is immunogenic in mice, and 5) p27-containing trimers have no negative 
impact on the induced B and T cell responses.
However, the clinical relevance of the observed immune responses and the corresponding conclusions 
(including selection of the antigen type and adjuvant system) is doubtful because the used antigen doses 
used in the murine studies are very low (compared to the doses used in the rabbit tox study and in clinical 
studies), and the corresponding antigen:adjuvant ratios in these non-clinical studies are different from the 
ones used in clinical studies and proposed in the SmPC, without further justification. In all cases, the amount 
of antigen in the non-clinical immunogenicity studies was considerably lower than the adjuvant dose. 
Different antigen:adjuvant ratios may considerably impact the desired immune response and corresponding 
efficacy. As such, the non-clinical proof-of-concept studies only provide proof that the selection of RSVPreF3 
and the Adjuvant System AS01 can induce an immune response which is expected to be required to provide 
protection in humans. The proposed vaccine (120 μg RSVPreF3 and 50 μg AS01E) used in the clinic was 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 33/103
selected based on clinical phase 1/2 data. The Applicant explained that the antigen doses selected for these 
studies were not based on anticipated doses in humans but chosen to identify a dose within the dynamic 
range of the dose-neutralizing response curves. The intention of the non-clinical program was not to select 
the most immunogenic doses and ratio to be used in the clinic, but to select the most appropriate 
combination of antigen type and adjuvant system. Immunogenicity and efficacy of the proposed vaccine have 
been evaluated clinically.
In addition, the Applicant has tested non-clinically both RSVPreF2 and RSVPreF3. In naïve mice, RSVPreF2 
induced higher T cell responses, while RSVPreF3 induced higher neutralising titres (including pre-fusion 
epitope site Ø, not detected or poorly detected with RSVPreF2). The Applicant argues that both humoral and 
cellular immune responses are considered needed to protect elderly from severe RSV-associated lower 
respiratory tract disease. As only RSVPreF3 elicited neutralizing antibodies against the RSV prefusion-specific 
antigenic site Ø and as both antigens induced T cell responses (although PreF2 > PreF3), the Applicant had 
selected RSVPreF3 as the most relevant antigen to be used in elderly.  
The Applicant evaluated different AS01 adjuvant doses (AS01B, AS01E and AS01F) in combination with 
RSVPreF3 in mice. There were no considerable differences in the height of the immune responses between 
the three AS01 doses. AS01B and AS01E were compared in the phase 1/2 clinical study leading to the 
selection of AS01E for phase 3 studies. The lowest dose (AS01F) was not considered in the clinical phase.
The Applicant provided public literature in CTD module 4.3 (Steff et al., 2007) showing that in bRSV pre-
exposed cows immunised with a single injection of non-adjuvanted RSVPreF3, this antigen could boost RSV-
specific neutralising antibodies. It is acknowledged that the specific immune responses in cattle may be non-
similar to (elderly) humans, but these data indicate that in non-naïve animals an adjuvant may not be 
needed to boost RSV-specific immune responses, in contrast to naïve animals (as shown in the non-clinical 
murine studies). The need for an adjuvant was further addressed in clinical studies. 
In the immunogenicity studies, RSVPreF3 pre-clinical lot (study 20160092-0094) and pre-GMP lot (study 
20160201 and 20170126-0174) were used to immunise animals. Immunocharacterisation study cov 0100-18 
was conducted with a GMP lot used for Phase 1/2 clinical studies. In the immunocharacterisation study 
20180258, Phase 3-representative material and Phase 1/2-representative material were tested and 
differences in antibody titres were observed. According to the Applicant, the differences between the DS 
processes used for non-clinical and part of Phase 1/2, Phase 3 and commercial phase would not have 
impacted the critical quality attributes of RSVPreF3.     
The antigen material used in the non-clinical immunogenicity studies has been produced with the same 
process as used to produce Phase 1/2 material. As such, the non-clinical material can be considered 
representative for early clinical material. One characterization study (20180258) was conducted with antigen 
representative for clinical Phase 3 material, although some non-clinical formulations used in this study 
resulted in lower neutralizing antibody titres. This might be due to a difference in purification between the 
non-clinical material and the actual DS lot used in the clinic.  
It should further be noted that the study reports did not contain individual animal data in tabulated form. The 
Assessor’s conclusions are therefore solely based on the graphs and corresponding Applicant’s descriptions of 
the results provided in the reports.
Reproduction and developmental toxicity 
Although in principle, the absence of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies is acceptable for the 
current indication, regarding potential off-label use in pregnant women and the inclusion of complete data in 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 34/103
section 4.6 of the SmPC, the Applicant was requested to submit any available preclinical data on reproductive 
and developmental toxicity studies performed with RSVPreF3. The Applicant has provided two DART studies 
with RSVPreF3 (without adjuvant): one in rabbit (doses of 120 μg antigen) and one in rat (doses of 48 μg 
antigen). In addition, the report from a DART study with the complete product (i.e., RSVPreF3/AS01E; full 
human dose, 120 μg PreF3) in rabbit was provided. In neither of the studies effects were observed on female 
fertility, embryo-foetal, pre- and postnatal development. The conclusions of these studies are reflected in 
section 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC.
ERA
Due to their nature, vaccines are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment.
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
Considering the above-mentioned limitations on the non-clinical animal model and study design for the 
selected antigen type, antigen and adjuvant doses and antigen:adjuvant ratio used in clinical studies, and 
that the optimal combination could still be different in RSV-primed elderly compared to RSV-naïve young 
mice, the non-clinical proof-of-concept program only provides proof that the selection of RSVPreF3 and the 
Adjuvant System AS01 can induce an immune response which is expected to be required to provide 
protection in humans. The final formulation, antigen and adjuvant doses (120 µg RSVPreF3 with 50 µg 
AS01E) was selected based on clinical data. 
Overall, based on the results of the repeated dose toxicity studies, no clinical safety issues are expected.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics
No pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted for Arexvy. This is because pharmacokinetics studies are 
generally not needed for vaccines, consistent with current the Guidelines on clinical evaluation of vaccines. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics
The pharmacodynamic profile of vaccines is defined by their immunogenicity, as detailed in the CHMP 
guideline “Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005).
Mechanism of action
Arexvy consists of 120 μg of the RSVPreF3 recombinant antigen and the AS01E adjuvant system administered 
as a 0.5 mL single dose. RSVPreF3 antigen is an engineered version of the RSV F surface glycoprotein, i.e., a 
trimeric RSV F protein stabilised in a pre-fusion conformation. The F protein is conserved between the RSV A 
and B subtypes and the main target of RSV neutralising antibodies in human sera. Arexvy is designed to 
enhance antigen-specific cellular immune response and neutralizing antibodies response in individuals with 
pre-existing immunity against RSV. The adjuvant system AS01E contains QS-21 (i.e., a triterpene glycoside 
purified from the bark of the tree Quillaja saponaria Molina) and MPL (i.e., 3-O-desacyl-4-monophosphoryl 
lipid A), to enhance the immunogenicity. The adjuvant AS01E facilitates the recruitment and activation of 
antigen presenting cells carrying vaccine-derived antigens in the draining lymph node, which in turn leads to 
the generation of RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T cells.
Currently there is no established correlate of protection for symptomatic disease caused by RSV.

The lower limit Of Quantification (i.e. 590) was used as assay cut-off to calculate the fold increase of the frequency of RSVPreF3-
specific polypositive CD4+ T cells between 2 time points 
A quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay based on a commercially 
available kit was used to confirm the presence of RSV-A or RSV-B. The RSV-A and RSV-B qRT-PCR assay was 
validated before the start of testing in the RSV OA=ADJ-006 study. The validation report, qualification report 
and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for this assay are provided.
RSV-A and RSV-B RNAs extracted from the swab samples were detected in a duplex qRT-PCR format using 
specific amplification primers and fluorescent probes designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV 
nucleocapsid protein. The process involved nucleic acids extraction, conversion of RNA to complementary 
deoxyribonucleic acid by reverse transcription and detection by real-time RT-PCR reaction using a calibration 
curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV viral load was reported as copies of RSV RNA per mL of sample (assay 
positivity cut-off was set at the Limit of Detection: 304 copies per mL for RSV-A and 475 copies per mL for 
RSV-B). 
The following performance parameters were assessed during validation for the RT-PCR assay:
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 39/103
Table 2: Summary of performance parameters assessed during validation
Precision and linearity were confirmed over the analytical range ([LLOQ–ULOQ]) of [62.70–794371.57] 
copies/PCR and [16.33–806320.32] copies/PCR for RSV-A and RSV-B, respectively. The LODs of 1.90 
copies/PCR for RSV-A and 2.97 copies/PCR for RSV-B were also confirmed. 
Laboratory assays used in the assessment of the primary and secondary endpoints of the RSVPreF3 OA 
clinical studies in the dossier included neutralisation assays for the determination of functional antibodies 
against RSV-A and RSV-B and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measurement of 
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (Ab) binding to the RSVPreF3 protein. CMI was characterised by the 
evaluation of the RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell frequencies using Intracellular Cytokine Staining 
(ICS) assay performed on PBMC samples.
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
No human pharmacokinetic studies have been performed. This can be agreed upon as pharmacokinetic 
studies are not usually required for vaccines. 
The Applicant utilised a RT-PCR assay to determine the viral presence and several different assays to 
evaluate humoral and cellular immunogenicity. For all assays, validation, and qualification reports, as well as 
SOPs, were submitted.
It should be remarked though that during the validation exercise conducted for the different assays, 
parameters most susceptible to change in clinical testing conditions were validated, meaning the main 
parameters that define the assay performances (linearity, precision, accuracy when there is an international 
reference available, and the assay lower and upper limits), with other parameters being covered by 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 40/103
qualification experiments. . For the RT-PCR assay, a duplex RT-PCR performed at the sponsor laboratory, this 
is not considered a major issue as the most relevant parameters – including the LOD - have been validated. 
The assay is therefore considered fit for the purpose of reliably detecting the presence or absence of RSV-A 
or RSV-B in the clinical samples of the studies included in the dossier. The assay can be considered fit for 
purpose, however, full validation cannot be claimed. 
The same holds true for the RSV-A and RSV-B neutralisation assays, as several relevant assay parameters 
such as specificity, sample stability, and assay robustness are documented in the qualification report and not 
repeated during validation. It is however considered that the assays are considered fit for purpose. Further, 
the results of these assays are only considered supportive and are not necessary for the benefit/risk 
assessment. It is therefore not considered a requirement that the assay is fully validated. The lack of full 
validation may however have implications for (future) labelling claims that are based on comparative 
immunogenicity. 
The outcome of the assay, serum neutralising antibody (NAb) titre, is expressed in ED60 (Estimated Dilution 
60) values. The Applicant indicated that the ED60 was chosen as it was used during early development of the 
assay, and it was considered more conservative. 
Also, the RSV PreF3 IgG binding antibody assay as well as the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay are 
considered fit for purpose, but are not considered fully validated given that several parameters were not 
included in the validation experiments. Both assays however only provide supportive evidence of the humoral 
and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine and are considered fit for this purpose. For the ICS assay, it 
should be remarked that the analytical range is small, 590 – 19197 polypositive cells per million PBMC, and 
the global limit of blank is set (in qualification experiments) at 310 which is rather high. This may influence 
the range of responses that can be reliably assessed with this assay. Based on the submitted validation data 
the haemagglutination inhibition assay that was used in the co-vaccination study is deemed suitable for the 
intended use. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The assays used to confirm the presence of RSV in the clinical sampleswas a duplex RT-PCR performed at the 
sponsor laboratory. After the qualification experiments, the validation experiments only covered assessment 
of LOD, precision and linearity to confirm the performances of the assay in the clinical setting. Hence the 
assay can, based on the provided information, not be considered fully validated.  The assay is however 
considered fit for the purpose of reliably detecting the presence or absence of RSV-A or RSV-B in the clinical 
samples of the studies included in the dossier. 
As immunogenicity results are only supportive for the current application, and the provided validation and 
qualification reports for the different assays do not raise concerns, the lack of full validation of the 
immunogenicity assays should not hamper the B/R evaluation.
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy
The pivotal study providing information on the efficacy and safety of Arexvy and supporting the proposed 
indication is study ADJ-006, a Phase 3 study in healthy adults ≥60 years of age. The development program 
has been formally discussed with CHMP at various moments throughout development, and an agreement was 
reached regarding the key elements of the clinical development plan.

2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies
Study ADJ-002
This was a Phase I/II, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the 
safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the investigational RSV vaccine (adjuvanted with AS01E or 
AS01B or unadjuvanted) when administered intramuscularly (IM) according to a 0, 2 months schedule in 
adults aged 18-40 (Part A) or 60-80 years (Part B). Part A will not be further discussed. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the reactogenicity and safety of 2 doses of different 
RSVPreF3 OA vaccine formulations administered intramuscularly according to a 0, 2-month schedule, up to 1 
months post-last dose (Day 91). Secondary objectives included characterising the humoral (regarding RSV-
A/-B NAb titres and RSVPreF3-specific IgG Ab concentrations) and cellular (in terms of frequencies of 
RSVPreF3-specific polypositive CD4+ T cells) immune response to the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine formulations up 
to Day 91.
Eligible participants were healthy male and female participants between 60 and 80 years of age at the time of 
first vaccination (inclusive) with no prior exposure to any RSV vaccine. 
Participants were to receive 2 doses of vaccine formulations containing different antigen amounts (30, 60 or 
120 μg), non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted with either AS01E or AS01B, or Placebo. Participants were randomised 
to 10 study groups in a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio. In Part B, 1005 participants were enrolled and vaccinated 
with at least 1 dose of RSVPreF3 OA vaccine formulations or Placebo and 975 completed the study.
Immunogenicity Results
All participants were seropositive for RSV-A and RSV-B neutralising antibodies as well as RSVPreF3-specific 
IgG at baseline (Day 1). The highest antibody levels were obtained after Dose 1 for RSV-A neutralising 
antibodies, see Table 3. After a peak response at Day 31, the RSV-A neutralising antibody GMTs (ED60) 
slightly declined between Day 31 and Day 91 and then declined further at Month 8 and Month 14 but 
remained above the baseline values in all treatment groups (data not shown). 
A noticeable increase in the RSV-A neutralising antibody GMTs (ED60) was observed with increase in antigen 
dose from 30 µg to 120 µg. No noticeable effect of adjuvant was observed.

Safety results
The safety profile of the investigational vaccine was mainly characterised by reactogenicity events. An 
increase in the AE reporting pattern in the adjuvanted treatment groups compared to non-adjuvanted 
treatment groups and Placebo was observed. AS01E was observed to be less reactogenic compared to AS01B. 
The vast majority of AEs reported were <Grade 3 in intensity in all treatment groups. In total, 78 subjects 
reported 107 SAEs (including 7 SAEs leading to death for 4 subjects) from Dose 1 until the study end (Month 
14). None of the SAEs was considered to be causally related to vaccination as per the investigator’s 
judgment.

Conclusion
A clear impact of increasing the dose from 30 to 120 µg could be observed based on the humoral response, 
with RSV-A NAb GMT ratios D31/prevaccination ranging from 5.6 to 6.2 in the 30 µg group, 6.6 to 6.7 in the 
60 µg group and 8.0 to 9.9 in the 120 µg group. No clear effect of adjuvant on the humoral response was 
observed. In addition, no increase in binding antibody GMCs or RSV-A and -B NAb GMTs (see Table 3) could 
be observed on Day 91 after the second vaccination on Day 61, indicating that a second dose had no added 
value. Based on the cellular immune response, a slight increase in RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T-cells expressing 
at least 2 markers among IL-2, CD40L, TNFα, IFNγ, with increasing amounts of adjuvant was observed. The 
safety profile of the investigational vaccine was mainly characterised by reactogenicity events. An increase in 
the AE reporting pattern in the adjuvanted treatment groups compared to non-adjuvanted treatment groups 
and Placebo was observed. However, no safety concerns were identified for any of the RSVPreF3 OA 
investigational vaccine formulations assessed. 
The formulation with 120 ug RSVPreF3 adjuvanted with AS01E was selected for further investigation in phase 
3 studies.

secondary descriptive VE, safety and immunogenicity results available at VE Analysis 1.
Study Participants
The trial included healthy male or female participants aged 60 years and older who did not have a previous 
vaccination with an RSV vaccine, from whom written informed consent was obtained. Participants living in the 
community dwelling (CD), or long-term care facilities (LTCF) could be enrolled. Any underlying chronic 
condition was documented to be stable, according to the investigator’s clinical judgement, with or without 
treatment. Exclusion criteria included participants who were immunocompromised, and administration of 
long-acting or chronic treatment with immune modifying drugs. In addition, normal in and exclusion criteria 
appropriate for a vaccine trial were in place.

ARI: acute respiratory infection; LRTD: lower respiratory tract disease; RSV: respiratory syncytial virus; hMPV: human metapneumovirus; 
RT-PCR: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
1.    Fever is defined as a temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F by any route.
2.    Feverishness is defined as the feeling of having fever without objective measurement.
3.    Reported by study participant or investigator.
4.    Reported by investigator.
5.    Throat and/or nasal swab samples collected at ARI visits for RT-PCR testing will be collected within 6 days after ARI onset (i.e. up to 
Day 7). In special circumstances (for example in case of suspected COVID-19 infection and pending COVID-19 test result, or self-
quarantine) and if it is not possible to perform the ARI visit within 6 days after ARI onset (i.e. within Day 3 to Day 7), then the 
interval for this visit and the site swab collection may be extended up to maximum 14 days after ARI onset (i.e. until Day 15).
6.   The investigator will grade each ARI as mild, moderate or severe based on the grading scale.
7.   In case the participant was already receiving any of these for treating/controlling any pre-existing condition, any significant change 
or adaptation in the used therapy should be taken into account.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 47/103
In case of at least 2 concomitant ARI symptoms/signs identified by the participant (i.e., trigger for swabbing, 
see Table 5), the following visits and contacts will take place:
•Participant’s call (Day 2): Within 24 hours of the appearance of at least 2 concomitant ARI 
symptoms/signs, the participant should call the site staff. During the phone call, ARI symptoms/signs 
reported by the participant should be recorded in the eCRF and record the onset date of each symptom 
mentioned. An ARI visit will be organised. The participant is reminded to take a nasal self-swab. The 
self-collected swab should be done preferably within 48 hours of ARI onset but not later than 5 days 
after ARI onset. 
•ARI visit (Days 3-7): The ARI visit should take place soon after ARI onset, ideally 48 hours after ARI 
onset, but no later than 6 days after ARI onset (exceptions are made for suspected COVID-19 cases). 
Ideally, and in most cases, the ARI visit should be scheduled at least 1 day after the participant’s self-
swab (i.e., the nasal self-swab taken by the participant and the nasal and throat swab samples taken by 
the qualified site staff should not be done on the same day). 
Main secondary endpoints include:
The first occurrence of RT-PCR-confirmed RSV-A and/or B-associated ARI, according to the case 
definition (see Table 5).
The first occurrence of ARI or LRTD, according to the case definition (see Table 5).
- Occurrence of hospitalisation due to RSV-confirmed respiratory diseases or due to a complication 
related to RSV-confirmed respiratory diseases during the RSV seasons†.
-
In a subset of participants, at pre-Dose 1 (Day 1), 30 days post-Dose 1 (Day 31), pre-Dose 2 (pre-
Season 2) and pre-Dose 3 (pre-Season 3):
o RSVPreF3 IgG-specific Ab concentrations.
o NAb titers against RSV-A.
o NAb titers against RSV-B.
For information regarding additional secondary endpoints see Clinical AR.
Sample size
The original sample size for the study was determined assuming an attack rate of RSV-confirmed LRTD 
around 0.6% during the first season. Due to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic measures on 
RSV circulation and the difficulty to estimate the attack rate for Season 1, the sample size was increased up 
to 23 000 in the NH.
In total 25,040 subjects have been randomised.
Randomisation and blinding (masking)
An automated internet-based system (SBIR) was used for randomisation with randomisation ratio 1:1. The 
system’s randomisation algorithm used a stratification by subset (subjects included in 
reactogenicity/immunogenicity subset or not) and a minimisation procedure accounting for centre, age and 
region within each subset. Minimisation factors will have equal weight in the minimisation algorithm. The 
minimisation procedure used an unknown fixed percentage of randomness. 
The study was observer blind. Treatment administration was performed by qualified study personnel 
(unblinded) who will not participate in the study. Only the unblinded committee independent from the project 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 48/103
(firewall) reviewed the results of the unblinded analyses, which were performed by an unblinded independent 
external statistician. 
Statistical methods
Analysis sets



Exposed Set (ES): All participants who received at least the first dose of the study intervention. The 
allocation in a group is done in function of the administered intervention.
Modified Exposed Set (mES) - RSV: the mES-RSV will be the primary population for efficacy analysis on RSV-
confirmed cases. It will include all participants who received at least the first dose of the study intervention 
(ES) and who did not report an RSV-confirmed ARI prior to Day 15 after each vaccination. The allocation in a 
group is done in function of the administered intervention.
Per Protocol set for efficacy (PPSe): the PPSe will include all participants included in the mES who:
-
-
-
received at least the first dose of the study vaccine to which they were randomised,
have data available for efficacy endpoint measures,
did not have any protocol deviations leading to exclusion.

Solicited Safety Set (SSS): All participants who received at least the first dose of the study intervention 
(Exposed Set) and have solicited safety data.
Interim analysis and multiplicity
An optional planned interim analysis was performed as at least 35 cases were accrued (at the end of Season 
1 in NH or later). The Type I error for the interim was adjusted to maintain the overall (one-sided) 
significance level at 2.5%. The Wang-Tsiatis approach was planned to be used [Wang, 1987]. This alpha 
spending method (with boundaries between O’Brien-Fleming and Pocock boundaries) depends on the quantity 
of information accumulated at the time of interim analysis (using gsDesign package in R).
For analysis of season 1, only the primary objective was type I error controlled, i.e., demonstration of 
efficacy of RSV vaccine against RSV-confirmed LRTD during the first season. All other endpoints were 
supportive. Therefore, no adjustment of alpha for multiplicity was applied. 
Type I error was controlled over all seasons. If efficacy was demonstrated during the first season, testing of 
the confirmatory objectives in the next seasons will be done sequentially.
Primary efficacy endpoint and primary efficacy analysis
The primary efficacy endpoint is the first occurrence of RT-PCR-confirmed RSV-A and/or B-associated LRTD, 
with cases identified according to the case definition with an onset of 15 days post vaccination and confirmed 
by an external adjudication committee.
Missing or non-evaluable measurements were not imputed for the primary analysis and were considered 
missing (completely) at random. 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on a Poisson regression model adjusted for age and region and using 
an exact conditional method and performed for the mES population. The model will estimate the mean

number of cases as a function of the different covariates (age included in categories 60-69y, 70-79y, >=80y 
and region included as North America, Europe, Asia, SH) and the logarithm of the follow up time. For the 
primary efficacy analysis, the follow up time starts on Day 15 post-vaccination and ends at the first 
occurrence of the event or at the last contact or database cut-off date. Vaccine efficacy (VE) is defined as 1-
RR, where RR = Relative Risk calculated as the ratio of incidence rates (Arexvy / Placebo), presented with an 
adjusted CI and a one-sided p-value for testing H0: VE ≤ 20%.
As sensitivity analysis a Cox Proportional Hazard regression model was performed adjusted for age and 
region and based on the mES population.
Supportive analyses are: 1. A re-randomisation test based on the method presented in [Wang, 2020]. 2. An 
analysis including all RSV RT-PCR confirmed LRTD cases either fulfilling case definition (as confirmed by GSK 
internal review) and/or confirmed by the study Investigators. 3. An analysis considering the RSV cases only 
confirmed by the GSK qRT-PCR. 4. An analysis excluding RSV cases with respiratory co-infections (e.g. hMPV, 
SARS-COV-2, FLU, etc.).
Secondary efficacy analyses
The same analysis method as described for the primary efficacy endpoint was used for the secondary efficacy 
endpoints. As the secondary endpoints were not included in the confirmatory testing strategy, the results of 
the secondary efficacy endpoints are not type I error controlled and considered supportive.
The analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints related to RSV-confirmed cases are performed on the mES 
population, while the ES population will be the primary population for secondary efficacy endpoints not 
related to RSV or hMPV.

Study ADJ-006 was initiated on 25 May 2021 (first participant first visit). The data lock point for interim 
efficacy analyses at VE analysis 1 was 11 April 2022, the data lock point for safety analyses at VE analysis 1 
was 30 April 2022. The study remains ongoing.
The study is being conducted in 278 active sites in 17 countries, 14 countries in the Northern hemisphere 
(US, Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Germany, Poland, UK, Spain, Russia, South Korea, and 
Japan) and 3 in the Southern hemisphere (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa).

 Conduct of the study
Amendments
The original protocol (16 October 2020) was amended 3 times:
Protocol Amendment 1 (25 February 2021)
-
-
Increase sample size based on reduced attack rate due to restrictive measures in place to control the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
Implement consultation with regulatory authorities, including removal of lot-to-lot consistency 
evaluation and change in start of ARI surveillance.
Protocol Amendment 2 (06 October 2021)
-
-
Adapt the trigger for the assessment of the primary objective to allow the assessment of the primary 
objective once the required number of cases have been accumulated. 
Inclusion of an optional interim analysis in case number of cases triggering the final analysis of the 
primary objective is not achieved at the end of Season 1 in Northern Hemisphere.
- Move evaluation of efficacy against any ARI and any LRTD to secondary descriptive objective.
-
Assessment of immunogenicity in terms of NAb against RSV-B is added.
Protocol Amendment 3 (24 January 2022)
-
-
Include the assessment of the efficacy of annual revaccinations
Add evaluation of efficacy against each RSV subtype independently as secondary confirmatory 
objective at the end of the study, conditional to the number of cases accrued.
Protocol deviations
The number of participants with at least 1 important PD was consistent between both groups (5.9% [n=741] 
of participants in the RSVPreF3 group and 6.1%  [n=771] in the Placebo group). Most of the important PDs 
were related to “out of window assessment for immunogenicity” (308 vs 341), followed by “administration of 
vaccine  excluded  by  the  protocol”  (151  vs  162),  ”missed  assessment  (immunology)”  (77  vs  72),  and 
“administration of medication excluded by the protocol” (94 vs 67).
 Baseline data
The baseline demographic data of the ES population in study ADJ-006 is shown in Table 6.
Demographics and baseline characteristics of participants in the ES were well-balanced between the 2 
treatment groups. The median age of participants at first dose was 69.0 years in both groups, with a similar 
proportion of participants in each age category across groups (74.3% were ≥65 YOA, 44.1% were ≥70 YOA, 
8.2% were ≥80 YOA in the RSVPreF3 group 74.6% were ≥65 YOA, 44.1% were ≥70 YOA, 8.2% were ≥80 
YOA in the placebo group). Approximately half the participants were female (51.7%), and most were White 
(79.4%) and not of Hispanic or Latino origin (94.5%). Demographics and baseline characteristics of 
participants in the PPSe, PPSi and SSS were largely comparable to the baseline characteristics in the ES.

 Numbers analysed
The participant flow, including participants randomised, vaccinated, discontinued and ongoing, is presented 
above.
Primary efficacy analysis was performed on the mES (for endpoints related to RSV-confirmed cases). Additional 
analyses  were  performed  on  the  PPSe  and  on  the  ES  to  complement  the  primary  analysis  of  the  primary 
objective. 
The  primary  analysis  of  immunogenicity  was  performed  on  the  PPSi  for  participants  included  in  the 
immunogenicity and reactogenicity subset. As more than 5% of participants were excluded from the PPSi, a 
second analysis of immunogenicity was performed on the ES.

 Outcomes and estimation
Primary objective
Interim analysis
The submission contains data of the interim analysis. An interim analysis was triggered when 35 cases of 
RSV-confirmed LRTD were accrued. In total, 47 externally adjudicated cases of RSV-confirmed LRTD cases 
were accrued up to the data lock point of 11 April 2022 in the primary cohort for efficacy (i.e., mES). Cases 
with ARI visit up to DLP for efficacy analyses (11 April 2022) were taken into consideration. 
Analysis of the primary objective is presented in Table 7.

This result was confirmed in the ES and PPSe population: VE was 83.8% (96.95% CI: 61.1, 94.5, number of 
events 7 vs 43) and 81.7% (96.95% CI: 55.5, 93.8, number of events 7 vs 38) respectively. Results of the 
sensitivity analysis estimated using a Cox proportional hazard regression model, adjusted for the covariates 
age and region are consistent with the primary analysis (VE: 82.5% [96.95% CI: 57.6, 92.8]).

VE Analysis 2 (End of Season 1 in SH)
Of the 24981 vaccinated participants, 24966 (12467 in RSVPreF3 group and 12499 in Placebo group) were 
included in the Exposed set (ES) at VE1 (15 participants were excluded due to an invalid ICF). At the time of 
VE2, a valid ICF had been obtained for 7 out of these 15 participants, increasing the number of participants in 
the ES from 24966 (at VE1) to 24973 (at VE2) and those in the mES from 24960 (at VE1) to 24967 (at VE2).

VE analysis 2 (VE2) was based on efficacy data collected up to DLP 30 September 2022 or Dose 2 
(revaccination) if administered before. In total, 57 externally adjudicated cases of RSV-confirmed LRTD have 
been accrued up to the efficacy DLP in the mES. This represents 10 additional cases as compared to VE1.

One hospitalisation due to RSV-confirmed respiratory disease or complication was reported in the Placebo 
group which limits conclusions that can be drawn. In total, 42.9% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group and 
60.0% of participants in the Placebo group required medical visits during the RSV-confirmed LRTD episodes.
No VE was observed against any LRTD (6.8% [95% CI: -1.7, 14.6], 988 cases vs 1059).
Secondary objective: VE against RSV-associated ARI

Secondary objective: Immunogenicity
Evaluation of the humoral immune response was performed in a subset of participants, referred to as 
immunogenicity subset. This subset was planned to include approximately 1800 participants (corresponding 
to ~7% of the total study population). Participants contributing to the immunogenicity subset were recruited 
from a selected number of countries and selected number of sites. In the selected sites, the investigator 
allocated the first participants in each age category to the immunogenicity subset until the allocated target 
was reached.

Results and Analysis
Analysis description Primary Analysis – First occurrence of RSV-A and/or B-associated 
LRTD. VE was estimated with a Poisson regression model adjusted 
for age and region.
Modified Exposed Set (mES): It includes all participants who received at 
least the first dose of the study intervention (exposed set) and who did not 
report an RSV -confirmed ARI prior to Day 15 after vaccination.

Notes
Timepoint: The interim VE Analysis 1 of the primary efficacy endpoint was 
event driven. The interim analysis included 47 RSV LRTD cases confirmed by 
an external adjudication committee, which was above the minimum of 35 
cases pre-specified in the protocol to trigger the optional interim analysis. 
Since the success criterion was met, this analysis is considered final for the 
primary endpoint.

2.6.5.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis)
A side-by-side display of immunogenicity responses obtained during studies ADJ-006, ADJ-004, ADJ-007 and 
ADJ-009, conducted in older adults ≥60 years of age with no prior RSV vaccination, is presented below. 
Demographic characteristics of the participants were generally comparable across the intervention groups: 
median age ranging from 67.0 to 70.0 years old, and approximately half of the participants were male. In 
studies ADJ-006, -004 and 009, a majority of participants were White, while in study ADJ-007 50.1% were of 
mixed race, and 31.1% were White. In all studies, most participants were of not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.
A substantial immune response was observed in all Phase 3 studies in RSV vaccine-naïve adults ≥60 years of 
age, as assessed by neutralising antibodies (see Table 14). The results in the Phase 3 were in line with the 
neutralizing antibody GMTs observed in Part B of study ADJ-002 for participants receiving 120 µg RSV 
vaccine adjuvated with AS01E; with RSV-A NAb GMTs increasing from 988.0 pre-vaccination to 9350.9 Day 
30 post-vaccination (mean geometric increase 9.5; 95% CI 7.6-11.8) and RSV-B GMTs increasing from 
1368.0 pre-vaccination to 12544.4 Day 30 postvaccination (mean geometric increase 9.2; 95% CI 7.3-11.5). 
A trend toward lower immunogenicity with increasing age was seen.

2.6.5.5.  Supportive studies
The supportive studies, ADJ-004, -007, -009 and -011, all evaluated immunogenicity of RSVPreF3. No 
efficacy results were obtained.
Study ADJ-004 was a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, multi-country study to evaluate the 
immunogenicity, safety, reactogenicity and persistence of a single dose of the RSVPreF3 OA investigational 
vaccine and different revaccination schedules in adults aged 60 years and above. The study is ongoing and 
only data on a single administration with RSVPreF3 vaccine are available. Follow-up until 6 months after 
vaccination is included in the submission.
The data presented indicate that RSVPreF3 is immunogenic as it induces a robust immune response at 30 
days postvaccination as measured by both RSV-A and RSV-B neutralising antibodies and RSVPreF3 specific 
binding antibodies as well as RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T-cells. No RSVPreF3-specific CD8+ T-cells were 
induced. The cellular and humoral immune response declined over time from 30 days to 6 months post-
vaccination but remained above respective baseline levels.
Study ADJ-007 was a multicentre, multi-country, randomised, controlled, open label study to evaluate the 
humoral immune response, reactogenicity and safety of a single dose of RSVPreF3 OA when co-administered 
with FLU-QIV or given separately in adults ≥60 years of age. The primary objective of the study was to 
demonstrate the non-inferiority of RSVPreF3 OA (in terms of RSV-A NAb titres) and FLU-QIV (in terms of HI 
Ab titres) when co-administered (Co-Ad group) compared to when administered alone (Control group).
The co-primary objectives for immunogenicity were met:
 One month after the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine dose, the RSV-A neutralising antibody titres 
(ED60) in the Co-Ad group were shown to be non-inferior compared to the Control group, see Table 
15. (Success Criterion: The upper limit (UL) of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) on the group 
GMT ratio [Control group divided by Co-Ad group] for RSV investigational vaccine is ≤1.5).
 One month after the FLU vaccine dose, the HI antibody titres for each of the FLU vaccine strains in the 
Co-Ad group were shown to be non-inferior compared to the Control group, see Table 16. (Success 
Criterion:  The  UL  of  the  2-sided  95%  CI  on  the  group  GMT  ratio  [Control  group  divided  by  Co-Ad 
group] for each of the FLU vaccine strains is ≤1.5).

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
The sought indication for RSVPreF3 is active immunisation for the prevention of lower respiratory tract 
disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes in adults 60 years of age 
and older. Inclusion of the subtypes of the pathogen in the indication is not in line with the usual approach to 
the indication statement for vaccines intended to address multiple subtypes. The fact that the vaccine is 
efficacious in prevention of LRTD caused by both RSV-A and RSV-B is included in section 5.1 of the SmPC, 
where the estimated VE is presented.   
Currently there is no immune correlate of protection for RSV disease that could be used to infer protective 
efficacy based on immune responses and there is no vaccine licensed for the prevention of RSV. Therefore, 
vaccine efficacy trials in which candidate vaccines are compared with control groups that do not receive 
vaccination against RSV are required.
This application is based on the efficacy data from a single pivotal Phase 3 trial, study ADJ-006. Three Phase 
3 supportive clinical studies using the proposed vaccination regimen mainly investigated immunogenicity and 
safety. The development program has been formally discussed with CHMP at various moments throughout 
development, and an agreement was reached regarding the key elements of the clinical development plan. 
Two of the Phase 3 studies (RSV OA=ADJ-006 and RSV OA=ADJ-004) including the single pivotal Phase 3 
efficacy study (RSV OA=ADJ-006) are still ongoing. For adjuvanted seasonal vaccines, persistence of immune 
response following primary vaccination should be investigated as well as the need for annual revaccination. 
The Applicant has committed to submit the data for Study ADJ-004 and ADJ-006 on antibody persistence,

responses to booster doses and efficacy of booster vaccination. These studies will be followed-up as 
Committee Recommendation (REC). 
Dose selection
The dose and regimen that was chosen to be tested in the pivotal clinical efficacy study was a single dose of 
120 µg RSVPreF3 antigen adjuvanted with AS01E. The choice for a single dose of 120μg RSVPreF3/AS01E as 
the formulation and posology to be tested in the Phase 3 studies was agreed by CHMP 
(EMEA/H/SA/3912/2/FU/1/2020/II), based on the results of study ADJ-002. Based on humoral immune 
response the use of the highest dose of antigen tested as a single dose was supported, as a clear impact of 
increasing the antigen dose from 30 to 120 µg could be observed. No added value of a second vaccination 2 
months after the first dose was seen. No clear impact of adding an adjuvant was observed on the humoral 
immune response. In terms of the cellular immune response, a statistically significant increase (p-value < 
0.025) in RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T-cells expressing at least 2 markers among IL-2, CD40L, TNFα, IFNγ, was 
observed with the adjuvanted formulation as compared to unadjuvanted formulation. It is theoretically 
agreed that induction of CD4+ T-cell responses could be beneficial in terms of protection per se. Although, in 
the Phase 2 dose finding study the added value of the adjuvant is not clearly shown in terms of 
immunogenicity and the impact on protection was not evaluated, considering the safety profile of the 
adjuvanted vaccine was acceptable (see safety section) no objection is raised.
Design and conduct of clinical studies
The single pivotal trial used to estimate vaccine efficacy, study ADJ-006, was a randomised, observer-blind, 
placebo-controlled multi-country study. The design of the study has been previously discussed with CHMP in 
a scientific advice and is considered generally acceptable. It is not fully understood why the study was not 
performed double-blind by for example masking the injection. However, whilst the Applicant terms this study 
observer blind, due to visual appearance differences between vaccine and placebo, only those conducting the 
injections will be aware of the treatment assignments, which is appropriate and acceptable 
(EMEA/H/SA/3912/2/2019/III), if appropriately implemented. However, in case subjects become unblinded, 
due to differences in the appearance of the injection, the knowledge of the intervention and expectation 
about its protective effect may affect the behaviour of participants in the study. Therefore, the Applicant was 
asked to present more detailed information on the frequency of ARI contact and timing and frequency of 
swabs taken to ensure reporting behaviour was not affected by potential unblinding. The data provided did 
not give rise to concern and no major impact on behaviour was observed. The number of RSV-confirmed 
LRTD cases for the primary objective was claimed to be monitored in an unblinded manner by the 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) during Season 1. In preparation of the IDMC meetings, 
unblinded analyses are performed by an independent external statistician. The IDMC has made 
recommendation to GSK for continuing the study without sample size reassessment based on the review of 
the top line results from the interim analysis. A Firewall team received the statistical outputs of VE analysis 1 
only after the IDMC had indicated that the pre-specified success criterion had been met, upon review of top 
line efficacy and safety results. The firewall reviews the unblinded summaries to prevent the potential risk of 
unblinding at participant level and only blinded data is released to the study team. In addition, during SA the 
ability to maintain blinded follow-up for cases in an ongoing study once success is declared after an interim 
analysis was questioned.

EMA/227054/2023

The investigational RSVPreF3 vaccine was administered as a single IM dose of 0.5 mL which is identical to the 
proposed posology. The study population included in the main study, participants ≥60 years of age with and 
without underlying respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease, is the population expected to benefit from the 
vaccine and is in line with the RSV guideline and the targeted indication. The randomisation procedure is 
based on a minimisation procedure accounting for the factors centre, age and region, with a randomness 
percentage of 20%. It is unclear why minimization/dynamic allocation was applied for this large trial as this 
procedure is mainly applied in case stratification is not possible due to many prognostic factors for small trials 
(Guideline on adjustment for baseline covariates in clinical trials). Dynamic allocation does not guarantee 
balance within combinations of prognostic factors. However, based on the data presented on the balance 
within the combination of prognostic factors (baseline comorbidities, baseline frailty status, centre, age and 
region), there is no indication that the performed randomisation/minimisation procedure led to an imbalance.
The primary objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of a single dose of the RSVPreF3 vaccine in the 
prevention of RSV-confirmed LRTD during the first season in adults ≥ 60 YOA, with a success criterion of the 
LL of the 2-sided CI for VE being above 20%. The primary endpoint, the case definition for RSV-confirmed 
LRTD and the case definition for ARI to trigger swabbing have been agreed upon by CHMP. The evaluation of 
vaccine efficacy in different subgroups defined by age, baseline comorbidities and frailty status is considered 
relevant to determine robustness across the overall target population to ensure generalisability. In addition, 
the objective to determine vaccine efficacy against both RSV-A and RSV-B confirmed LRTD separately is 
considered relevant, as these subtypes usually co-circulate. 
Interim analysis
The current clinical study report presents results of the interim analysis of the primary objective. The VE 
Analysis 1 was case-driven and was performed with 47 cases of RSV-confirmed LRTD accrued in the primary 
cohort for efficacy up to efficacy data lock point (DLP) on 11 April 2022. According to the final SAP, the 
primary analysis was planned to be performed when at least 56 cases of RSV-confirmed and externally 
adjudicated LRTDs have been accrued in the primary cohort for efficacy (i.e., mES). If the number of events 
triggering VE Analysis 1 (at least 56 cases) is not achieved at the end of Season 1 in NH, an optional interim 
analysis might be performed when at least 35 cases have been accrued (at the end of Season 1 in NH or 
later). The interim analysis was triggered at the end of NH season 1 (30 April 2022). At end of NH season 1, 
30 April 2022, the DLP for the vaccine efficacy analysis 1 (VE Analysis 1) was retrospectively defined as the 
date of the ARI visit for the last swab considered for the analysis, 11 April 2022, in order to have all relevant 
information (swab samples being shipped/tested, follow-up information on ARI collected and entered in the 
eCRF screen, ARI data fully cleaned) to support adequate external adjudication for the cleaned data of the 
end of season 1. Between 11 April 2022 and 30 April 2022, there was only one additional RT-PCR-confirmed 
RSV LRTD which took place in the SH in the placebo group, therefore, a DLP on 30 April 2022 would have 
provided slightly more favourable results. 
There is a design switch between a fixed sample design (after at least 56 cases) and a group sequential 
design (interim analysis at the end of Season 1 if at least 35 cases have been accrued and final analysis after 
60 cases or when all data associated to the primary objective are available), which also could affect the type 
I error. Simulation results confirm that the adaptive design controls type-I-error but rely on strong 
distributional assumptions. Nevertheless, the adaptation is based on the total number of events in a blinded 
way. The asymptotic distribution of the usual chi-square test statistic is not affected by this interim 
examination.

Efficacy data and additional analyses
Main results
There was a total of 50 externally adjudicated cases of RSV-confirmed LRTD occurring after the first dose of 
either RSVPreF3 or placebo. Of these, 47 cases occurred 15 or more days after administration of RSVPreF3 or 
placebo, 7 in the RSVPreF3 group and 40 in the placebo group. The primary VE as estimated in the primary 
efficacy population based on the Poisson model adjusted for age and region was 82.6% (96.95% CI: 57.9, 
94.1). Cox regression analysis provided a similar estimated VE as estimated through Poisson regression 
(82.5% vs 82.6%). Since a minimisation procedure was used, additional sensitivity analyses were requested. 
The outcomes of these analyses supported the primary outcome and did not give rise to any concerns. No 
more than a single episode of RSV-confirmed ARI and RSV-confirmed LRTD was reported by any participant 
in the mES and ES. It was clarified that the primary analysis (VE Analysis 1) was performed on all cases that 
occurred during the study up to DLP. In total, there were 8 cases in the placebo group occurring outside the 
season. For hospitalization due to RT-PCR confirmed RSV respiratory diseases or for complication related to 
respiratory diseases only data during RSV Season 1 was used in the VE analysis 1.
Secondary outcomes
The cumulative incidence curve suggests that vaccine efficacy remains high up to at least 6 months. As the 
median follow-up was 6.7 months, VE after 6 months could not be accurately determined. The Applicant is 
asked to present results for VE over the full first season (including NH and SH) and multiple seasons as soon 
as the information becomes available. The Applicant confirmed that all data will be presented once available. 
In addition, the Applicant provided the results for VE analysis 2, which was based on data collected for the 
first full season, up to DLP of 30 September 2022 or revaccination (dose 2) if administered before 30 
September. In total, 10 additional externally adjudicated cases of RSV-confirmed LRTD were observed 
compared to the interim analysis. Overall, the results of VE2 are in line with the interim analysis. At VE2, the 
estimated level of protection demonstrated against RSV-confirmed LRTD was 78.9% (95% CI: 57.6, 90.5; p 
< 0.0001). The cumulative incidence curve suggests that vaccine efficacy remains high up to the end of a full 
season and for at least 11 months. 
Estimated VE against LRTD caused by RSV-A and RSV-B was substantial and comparable, with estimated VE 
against each subtype being >80% and LL being well above 20%. For 1 case in the placebo group information 
on serotype was missing, as the external test used to confirm RSV infection did not distinguish between RSV-
A and RSV-B subtype.
The estimated VE against RSV-confirmed LRTD was >80% in all age groups tested (with LL >20%), except 
the group ≥80 years of age. In the group aged ≥80 years, there were not enough cases to draw a conclusion 
on efficacy, with in total 5 cases (2 in the RSVPreF3 group vs 3 in the placebo group). However, no trend in 
declining VE was observed when comparing estimated VE in the age groups 60-69 years of age and 70-79 
years of age, being 81.0% (95% CI: 43.6-95.3) and 93.8% (95% CI: 60.2-99.9) respectively. This is 
reassuring.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 72/103
Approximately 39% of participants in the primary efficacy population, and the overall study population had at 
least one comorbidity at baseline such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, or diabetes. The 
estimated VE against RSV-confirmed LRTD more than 15 days post-vaccination was high in subjects with at 
least 1 pre-existing comorbidity of interest, 94.6% (1 vs. 18 cases), and 72.5% (6 vs. 22 cases) in those who 
did not have any comorbidity at baseline. As pre-existing comorbidities can lead to an increased risk of 
severe RSV disease, high vaccine efficacy in participants with comorbidities is assuring.
The number of severe RSV-confirmed LRTD cases based on requirement of supportive therapy was too low to 
draw meaningful conclusions, as only 4 cases were observed, all in the placebo group. Severe RSV-confirmed 
LRTD based on investigator assessment of severity and/or having at least 2 lower respiratory signs, were 
observed in 18 cases, of which 1 occurred in the RSVPreF3 group and 17 in the placebo group. Of these 18 
participants, 9 (all in the placebo group) experienced severe LRTD according to the investigator. The 
Applicant provided narratives for all participants who experienced severe LRTD according to definition 1, to 
be able to ascertain the level of severity of disease. Based on the narratives presented it is not agreed that 
all 18 cases, or even the 9 cases that were identified by the investigators, can be considered severe. Having 
at least 2 lower respiratory signs is not enough to determine disease severity. Definition 2 based on 
supportive therapy required is still considered the most objective measure to indicate disease severity. There 
were not enough cases to draw a conclusion on efficacy, with in total 4 participants, all in the placebo group, 
requiring supplemental oxygen.  
The estimated VE for both males and females was high, with the estimated lower limit of the 95% CI being 
above 20% for both subgroups. However, a difference was observed with estimated VE being 90.5% in males 
and 74.1% in females. As this difference in point estimate of VE is driven by a difference of only 3 cases in 
the RSVPreF3 group between males and females, this might be due to chance. At the end of season 1 in the 
SH, the observed VE against RSV-confirmed LRTD was 86.9% (95% CI: 56.7, 97.5) in males and 71.3% 
(95% CI: 31.4, 89.6) in females. The RSVPreF3 vaccine induced a substantial and comparable increase in 
titres for both neutralising and binding antibodies at 30 days postvaccination in both males and females. 
Given the wide and overlapping confidence intervals of VE against RSV-confirmed LRTD for males and 
females, no firm conclusions on any difference in VE can be drawn, while the fact that the LL of the 2-sided 
CI for VE is above 20% for both males and females does indicate that the vaccine is effective. Finally, the fact 
that the immune response in females is comparable to males indicates that there is no clear biological 
mechanism leading to reduced vaccine efficacy in females compared to males. 
Finally, analyses of relevant subgroups show consistency in the direction of the treatment effect. Where 
substantial differences are observed between relevant subgroups, e.g., age ≥80 years, frail subgroup or 
region, these differences are most likely attributable to either chance or low number of events. In addition, 
the Applicant provided a forest plot for all relevant subgroups (including hemisphere, region, ethnicity, race, 
sex, comorbidities and frailty in addition to RSV subtype, and age) using all categories of the variables, which 
also shows consistency in the direction and magnitude of the treatment effect, except when there were very 
low number of cases.
Secondary outcomes: RSV-confirmed ARI
When participants experienced at least 2 respiratory symptoms/signs or 1 respiratory symptoms/sign plus 1 
systemic symptom/sign for at least 24 hours, the participants experienced acute respiratory infection (ARI). 
ARI was the trigger to swab, after which the disease course could potentially include involvement of the lower 
respiratory tract to lead to LRTD. The results for RSV-confirmed ARI are in line with the results for RSV-
confirmed LRTD. The estimated VE against RSV-confirmed ARI was 71.7% (95% CI: 56.2, 82.3). This high 
protection against RSV-confirmed ARI was observed up to at least 6 months. The subgroup analyses in 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 73/103
different age categories and by baseline comorbidities indicate that vaccine efficacy is not impacted by either 
age or presence of comorbidities. As increased age and the presence of comorbidities can lead to an 
increased risk of severe RSV disease, these results are encouraging.
Immunogenicity
Results for both neutralising antibodies (RSV-A and RSV-B) and binding antibodies have been provided in a 
subgroup of ~1800 participants from selected sites. Overall, these results were in general agreement with 
similar trends being observed between neutralising and binding antibodies. 
Across studies, a consistent immune response was observed, with at 1-month postvaccination a ~10 fold 
increase in RSV-A neutralising antibody titres, an ~8 fold increase in RSV-B neutralising antibody titres, and 
a ~12 fold increase in binding antibody titres being observed. This indicates that vaccination induces a 
substantial increase in titres for both neutralising and binding antibodies at 30 days postvaccination, in line 
with a boost response in a population that has been previously exposed to RSV. Consistency across studies, 
shows the repeatability of the response induced.
Analysis by age category reveals, as expected, differences in GMTs based on age, with the highest response 
in the youngest age category. Unfortunately, it is currently unknown what the clinical relevance is of any 
specific GMT value, and hence differences in antibody titres between groups cannot be fully interpreted. 
Currently, no information on the persistence of antibody titres over 6 months is available in the currently 
proposed posology of a single dose. In study ADJ-004 it was observed that antibody titres declined over time, 
as titres for both neutralising and binding antibodies decreased. However, the titres remained well above 
baseline levels. The Applicant was requested to submit any data on longer-term persistence of antibody titres 
over time and on the effect of revaccination on immunogenicity once it is available. Antibody titres declined 
further up till month 12 post vaccination, however, did remain well above baseline. Revaccination at Month 
12 post dose 1 induced a substantial increase in RSV-A NAb, RSV-B NAb and IgG antibody titres but did not 
restore the titres to the levels observed 30 days after the first dose. This indicates that the booster potential 
of the vaccine is limited. However, as there is no CoP, any specific titre reached cannot be directly translated 
to efficacy. The impact of the limited booster ability will be shown in the ongoing efficacy study ADJ-006 
which will determine VE over multiple seasons and after revaccination. 
In study RSV OA=ADJ-011 (extension study of Phase 1/2 dose-finding study), neutralizing (and binding) anti-
RSV GMTs gradually declined after a two-dose vaccination schedule (1 month apart) over time until M18 
post-dose 2 and increased again 1 month after dose 3. However, GMTs as induced by the first vaccination 
could not be reached. Month 12 RSV-A serum neutralisation titres were positively correlated with titres 
measured 1 month post revaccination (Month 13) and a tendency towards higher fold increase in participants 
with lower pre-vaccination titres was observed. In the absence of an immune correlate of protection, efficacy 
data from RSV OA=ADJ-006 will be instrumental to complement the immunogenicity results observed post-
revaccination from RSV OA=ADJ-004. This will provide evidence to assess the need of the revaccination 
doses. 
During the pivotal study (ADJ-006) an exploratory analysis was planned to correlate the humoral immune 
response to the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine with protection against RSV-confirmed disease. For that 
purpose, blood samples for humoral immune response were collected from all participants at pre-Dose 1 (Day 
1) and 1-month post-Dose 1 (Day 31). These samples may be tested for a correlate of protection analysis. In 
addition, information on the humoral immune response pre-dose 2 and pre-dose 3 could also be used to 
investigate the CoP as efficacy in a second or even third season could potentially be linked to the humoral 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 74/103
response. The Applicant confirmed that analysis of CoP will be performed once more data are available from 
both multiple seasons for Study ADJ-006 and revaccination in study ADJ-004.
Induction of cellular immunity in terms of RSVPreF3-responsive CD4+ T-cells was demonstrated in studies 
ADJ-002 and ADJ-004 after RSVPreF3 OA vaccination. No RSVPreF3-responsive CD8+ T-cells were induced. 
In study ADJ-004 frequencies of RSVPreF3-responsive CD4+ T-cells declined over time (30 days to 6 months 
post-vaccination) but remained above baseline levels.
Overall, it can be concluded from the submitted immunogenicity analyses that the RSVPreF3 vaccine is able 
to induce a robust humoral immune response in the intended target population. As expected, trends toward 
lower humoral immune response can be seen with increasing age. However, the population ≥80 years of age 
still mounted a substantial immune response that was well above baseline levels, with a mean geometric 
increase in titres for neutralising antibodies being ≥8 for RSV-A and ≥6 for RSV-B. However, the immune 
response observed cannot be directly translated to efficacy as there is no correlate of protection.
Concomitant administration of Flu vaccine
A generally reduced immune response to RSVPreF3 can be observed when the vaccine is concomitantly given 
with QIV. In addition, similar results were obtained for the FLU-QIV vaccination; an immune response was 
elicited that was slightly reduced when comparing co-administration to non-concomitantly administered 
vaccines. The clinical impact of this (slightly) reduced response is unknown, given that for both RSV and 
influenza a correlate of protection does not exist. However, given that a clear immune response to both 
vaccines is observed, it can be agreed that the vaccines can be co-administered.
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
In conclusion, the results indicate that the RSVPreF3 vaccine is efficacious, with an estimated VE of around 
80% against RSV-confirmed LRTD. Protection remains high up to at least 6 months. No trend in decreasing 
vaccine efficacy is seen with increasing age or the presence of comorbidities, which are known risk factors for 
severe RSV disease. The results for RSV-confirmed ARI align with those RSV-confirmed LRTD.
The median follow-up for the interim analysis in study ADJ-006 was 6.7 months. Currently, the median 
follow-up time up to VE2 was 11.5 months in the mES. The information on longer-term protection is lacking 
as is the need for revaccination. Study ADJ-006 is designed to provide information on both efficacy of the 
single dose for a second RSV season and the impact of revaccination after 1 year. In addition, the 
immunogenicity of the second dose of RSVPreF3 will be tested. These data are considered highly relevant, 
and the Applicant is asked to present the data as soon as they are available (REC).
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:
The Applicant should submit the results for Study ADJ-004 and ADJ-006 on antibody persistence, responses 
to booster doses and efficacy of booster vaccination, once available
2.6.8.  Clinical safety
The main source of safety data to support the benefit/risk profile of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine in the target 
population of older adults ≥60 years was the placebo-controlled Phase 3 efficacy study ADJ-006 study. This 
study represents a major part of the overall exposure to the RSVPreF3 vaccine. The safety and reactogenicity 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 75/103
data is further supported by data from three Phase 3 studies (ADJ-004, -007 and -009) and one Phase 1/2 
dose-selection study RSV OA=ADJ-002, where applicable.
Safety assessments include monitoring and recording of solicited (administration site and systemic 
reactogenicity events), unsolicited adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of 
special interest (AESI), and deaths.
Solicited administration site events assessed in the Phase 3 studies included pain, erythema and swelling at 
the injection site and solicited systemic events included fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia. 
Recording of these AEs was solicited during the 4- day follow-up period after vaccination. Unsolicited AEs 
were assessed during the 30- day follow-up period after vaccination. Both solicited and unsolicited AEs were 
recorded on diary cards.
In all Phase 3 studies, SAEs and AESI were collected up to 6 months after vaccination. All SAEs and AESI 
considered vaccination-related, any fatal SAEs and AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study will be 
collected and recorded from the time of receipt of the first study vaccine until the participant is discharged 
from the study.
In general, the safety data was not pooled across the studies. However, aggregated analyses were performed 
overall and by subgroups by pooling data on medically attended unsolicited AEs, SAEs, and non-
serious/serious AESI from the Phase 3 studies (RSV OA=ADJ-006, -004, -007 and -009) considering all data 
post-vaccination with RSVPreF3 OA, except in case of co-administration with FLU-QIV. This analysis included 
a total of 15 303 participants.
The investigator was to assess causality for all AEs and SAEs. AEs will be considered related if there is a 
reasonable possibility of a relationship to study vaccine.
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure
Across all Phase 3 studies, a total of 15,745 participants in the ES and 100 participants in the Phase 1/2 
dose-finding study received at least 1 dose of the RSVPreF3 OA (120μg/AS01E) vaccine (Table 18).

Reactogenicity
For study ADJ-006, the solicited safety set (SSS), used to determine reactogenicity, included 1,757 
participants (879 in the RSVPreF3 group and 878 in the Placebo group).
In study ADJ-006, solicited AEs reported within 4 days following vaccination were observed in 71.9% 
participants in the RSVPreF3 group and in 27.9% participants in the Placebo group (Table 20).

During study ADJ-006, grade 3 solicited administration site events were reported in 1.5% of participants in 
the RSVPreF3 group and in no participants in the Placebo group (Table 20). In the RSVPreF3 group, Grade 3 
pain was reported in 1.0% of the participants; Grade 3 erythema and Grade 3 swelling were each reported in 
0.2% of the participants. Grade 3 solicited systemic events were reported in 3.3% of participants in the 
RSVPreF3 group and 0.9% in the Placebo group (Table 20). The most frequently reported Grade 3 systemic 
event was fatigue (1.7% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group and 0.5% of participants in the Placebo 
group), followed by myalgia (1.4% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group and 0.3% of participants in the 
Placebo group), arthralgia (1.3% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group and 0.6% of participants in the 
Placebo group) and headache (1.3% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group and 0% of participants in the 
Placebo group).
The reactogenicity profile observed in the studies ADJ-004, ADJ-007 and ADJ-009 were overall comparable to 
the reactogenicity profile observed in the solicited safety set in study ADJ-006. The majority of participants in 
all Phase 3 studies experienced a solicited adverse event within 4 days. The most frequently reported 
solicited AEs were injection-site pain, myalgia, fatigue and headache.
Unsolicited adverse events
ADJ-006
Within 30 days post-vaccination, at least 1 unsolicited AE was reported in 4,117 (33.0%) participants in the 
RSVPreF3 group (8,411 events) and in 2,229 (17.8%) participants in the Placebo group (3,732 events). Of 
note, for all participants who were not included in the SSS, all reactions following vaccination were recorded 
as unsolicited events, including also those reactions which were solicited in the SSS (i.e. solicited 
administration site events: injection site erythema, swelling and pain; and solicited systemic events: fatigue, 
headache, fever, myalgia and arthralgia). The more frequent occurrence of unsolicited AE in the RSVPreF3 
group in the ES is mainly driven by those PTs corresponding to the reactogenicity of the vaccine.
Within 30 days post-vaccination, at least 1 Grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported in 246 (2.0%) participants in 
the RSVPreF3 group (336 events) and in 158 (1.3%) participants in the Placebo group (207 events). The 
most frequent types of Grade 3 AEs reported by SOC were consistent with those reported for any AEs with 
“General disorders and administration site conditions” (76 [0.6%] participants in the RSVPreF3 group and 16 
[0.1%] participants in the Placebo group), “Nervous system disorders” (41 [0.3%] participants in the 
RSVPreF3 group and 27 [0.2%] participants in the Placebo group) and “Infections and Infestations” (28 
[0.2%] participants in the RSVPreF3 group and 36 [0.3%] participants in the Placebo group).
In the solicited safety set, at least 1 unsolicited AE was reported within 30 days post-vaccination in 131 
(14.9%) participants in the RSVPreF3 group and in 128 (14.6%) participants in the Placebo group. The most 
frequently reported unsolicited AEs (by PT) were headache (reported in 16 [1.8%] participants), followed by 
arthralgia (reported in 7 [0.8%] participants) and oropharyngeal pain (reported in 6 [0.7%] participants) in 
the RSVPreF3 group. In the Placebo group, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs (by PT) were 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 78/103
arthralgia (reported in 8 [0.9%] participants), followed by upper respiratory tract infection (reported in 7 
[0.8%] participants) and headache, injection site pruritis, oropharyngeal pain and nasopharyngitis (each 
reported in 5 [0.6%] participants). At least 1 Grade 3 unsolicited AEs was reported within 30 days post-
vaccination in 1.4% of participants in both groups.
ADJ-004, -007 and -009
In studies ADJ-004, -007 and -009 at least 1 unsolicited AE was reported in 12.8% - 14.8% of participants 
within 30 days following vaccination. In study ADJ-004 the most frequently reported unsolicited AE was 
headache (reported in 18 [1.1%] participants), followed by arthralgia (reported in 11 [0.7%] participants) 
and injection site pruritus (reported in 10 [0.6%] participants). In study ADJ-007, the most frequently 
reported unsolicited AE was hypertension (reported in 7 [1.6%] participants), followed by upper respiratory 
tract infection (reported in 5 [1.2%] participants) and headache and COVID-19 infection (reported in 4 
[0.9%] participants). In study ADJ-009 the most frequently reported unsolicited AE in the RSVPreF3_Grp1 
and RSVPreF3_Grp2 groups was headache (reported in 4 [1.6%] participants in both groups), while COPD, 
headache and pruritus were the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs in the RSVPreF3_Grp3 group (each 
event was reported in 3 [1.2%] participants).
At least 1 Grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported in 1.2% to 2.4% of participants.

Within 30 days post-vaccination, at least 1 Grade 3 related AE was reported in 112 (0.9%) participants in the 
RSVPreF3 group (165 events) and 25 (0.2%) participants in the Placebo group (41 events). The observed 
incidence of Grade 3 related injection site pain, injection site erythema, injection site swelling, pyrexia and 
headache were higher in the RSVPreF3 group compared to the placebo based on relative risk.

ADJ-004, -007 and -009
In study ADJ-004, at least 1 unsolicited AE considered by the investigator to be related to the study 
vaccination was reported in 59 (3.6%) participants. The most frequently reported related unsolicited AE was 
injection site pruritus (10 participants [1.1%]), followed by chills (8 participants [0.5%]) and asthenia, 
nausea and pruritus (all 3 participants [0.2%]). At least 1 Grade 3 unsolicited AE considered by the 
investigator to be related to the study vaccination was reported in 6 (0.4%) participants.
In study ADJ-007, after RSVPreF3 OA dose in the Control group, at least 1 unsolicited AE considered by the 
investigator to be related to the study vaccination was reported in 10 (2.3%) participants. The most 
frequently reported related unsolicited AE was injection site pruritus (2 participants [0.5%]). All other related 
unsolicited AEs were reported by 1 participant. At least 1 Grade 3 unsolicited AE considered by the 
investigator to be related to the study vaccination was reported in 1 (0.2%) participant.
In study ADJ-009, At least 1 unsolicited AE considered by the investigator to be related to the study 
vaccination was reported in 11 (4.4%), 15 (5.9%) and 12 (4.7%) participants in the RSVPreF3_Grp1, 
RSVPreF3_Grp2 and RSVPreF3_Grp3 groups, respectively. The most frequently reported related unsolicited 
AEs were headache (5 participants), pruritus and oropharyngeal pain (4 participants each). At least 1 Grade 3 
unsolicited AE considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccination was reported in 1 (0.4%) 
participant in the RSVPreF3_Grp1 group and 3 (1.2%) participants in the RSVPreF3_Grp2 group. 
Adverse events of special interest: pIMDs
Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) were considered adverse events of special interest (AESIs). 
Overall, up to the data lock point (DLP), at least 1 pIMD was reported in 55 (0.4%) participants in the 
aggregated analysis. The most frequently reported pIMDs (by SOC) were “Metabolism and nutrition 
disorders” (reported in 13 [0.1%] participants) and “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” 
(reported in 13 [0.1%] participants), followed by “Nervous system disorders” (reported in 8 [0.1%] 
participants).
Overall, a total of 9 (0.1%) participants reported pIMDs considered by the investigator as related to the study 
vaccination (Table 23).

ADJ-004, -007 and -009
In study ADJ-004, at least 1 SAE was reported in 65 (3.9%) participants. One SAE of Guillain-Barré 
syndrome considered by the investigator as causally related to the RSVPreF3 OA investigational vaccine was 
reported in 1 (0.1%) participant.
In study ADJ-007, at least 1 SAE up to study end was reported in in 15 (3.4%) participants in the Co Ad 
group and 20 (4.5%) participants in the Control group. Two SAEs of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis 
(ADEM) considered by the investigator as causally related to the FLU-QIV were reported. No related SAEs 
were reported in the Control group.
In study ADJ-009, up to the safety data lock point for the final analysis, at least 1 SAE was reported in 3 
(1.2%) participants in the RSVPreF3_Grp1 group (fall, sepsis, and cholecystitis), 2 (0.8%) participants in the 
RSVPreF3_Grp2 group (myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death) and 2 (0.8%) participants in the 
RSVPreF3_Grp3 group (COPD, pleural effusion, and pulmonary oedema in 1 participant and acute myocardial 
infarction in the other participant). None were assessed as possibly related to the study vaccine.

ADJ-002
In study ADJ-002, at least 1 SAE was reported in 11 (11.0%) participants in the 120µg RSVPreF3 + AS01E 
group, versus 9 (8.9%) of participants in the placebo group. None of the SAEs was reported by more than 1 
participant and none were considered by the investigator as causally related.
Deaths
Study ADJ-006
Up to DLP, at least 1 fatal SAE was reported in 49 (0.4%) participants in the RSVPreF3 group and in 58 
(0.5%) participants in the Placebo group across several SOCs. Three cases of fatal SAEs were reported by the 
investigator as related to the study vaccination: 1 case of cardiopulmonary failure in the RSVPreF3 group and 
1 case of pulmonary embolism and 1 death of unknown cause in the placebo group. 

Cardiopulmonary failure: A 60-69-year-old male who, 30 days after receiving RSVPreF3 OA, had a 
cardiorespiratory arrest with a fatal outcome (no autopsy was performed). The events triggering the 
cardiorespiratory arrest were not provided. Due to the time to onset, and predisposing medical 
conditions (diabetes Type II, hypertension, COPD, and obesity), the causal relationship to the vaccine 
product is considered unlikely.

Pulmonary embolism: A 70-79-year-old male with past medical history of asthma who, 147 days 
after receiving placebo, died due to pulmonary embolism. This type of event has been described in the 
framework of adenovirus-based COVID vaccines (vaccine-induced immune thrombotic 
thrombocytopenia) which is not applicable for the study intervention received. Considering the long time 
to onset and the presence of other risk factors such as asthma, the event is considered unlikely related 
to the vaccine product.
 Death of unknown cause: A 60-69-year-old male with medical history of diabetes Type II, 
hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia and fatty liver disease, who, 223 days after 
receiving placebo died of an unknown cause. The reported death is considered unlikely related to the 
vaccine product in view of the long time to onset after vaccination.
ADJ-004, -007 and -009
In study ADJ-004, up to the DLP, SAEs with a fatal outcome were reported in 6 (0.4%) participants: 2 
myocardial infarctions; 1 cardiac arrest, 1 COVID-19 pneumonia, and 2 deaths. None of the reported fatal 
SAEs were assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination.
In study ADJ-007, up to DLP, at least 1 fatal SAE was reported in 4 (0.9%) participants in the Co Ad group 
and in 8 (1.8%) participants in the control group across several SOCs. Of these, 1 event of acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis in the Co-Ad group was considered by the investigator to be related to the 
study intervention FLU-QIV vaccine.
In study ADJ-009, up to the safety data lock point for the final analysis, SAEs with fatal outcomes were 
reported in 3 participants (2 [0.8%] in the RSVPreF3_Grp2 group and 1 [0.4%] in the RSVPreF3_Grp3 
group). The events included myocardial infarction in 1 participant and sudden cardiac death in 1 participant in 
the RSVPreF3_Grp2 group and COPD, pleural effusion, and pulmonary oedema in 1 participant in the 
RSVPreF3_Grp3 group. None of the fatal SAEs were considered by the investigator to be causally related to 
the study intervention.

No deaths were reported in either the 120µg RSVPreF3 + AS01E group or placebo group.
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings
The clinical laboratory evaluations were only analysed in the Phase 1/2 study RSV OA=ADJ-002. No significant 
alteration of hematologic or biochemical laboratory parameters were observed. No laboratory evaluations were 
performed in the Phase 3 trials, which is acceptable.
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations
Age 
In the RSV OA=ADJ-006 study, the following observations were made in the RSVPreF3 group,

Solicited administration site events: The observed percentage of participants reporting injection 
site pain was higher in the 60-69 YOA (67.5%) category compared to the ≥80 YOA (42.1%) 
category. No difference was observed between the other age categories (≥ 65 YOA, ≥ 70 YOA and 
70-79 YOA). No difference was observed for erythema and swelling.

Solicited systemic events: The observed percentage of participants with headache was higher in 
the 60-69 YOA (30.9%) category compared to the ≥ 80 YOA (15.9%) category. No difference was 
observed between the other age categories (≥ 65 YOA, ≥ 70 YOA and 70-79 YOA). For myalgia, 
arthralgia and fatigue, no difference was observed by age category.
 Unsolicited AEs: As unsolicited AEs within 30 days post-vaccination are driven by events linked to 
the vaccine reactogenicity primarily reported by participants who were not included in the SSS, 
observations made on unsolicited AEs are aligned with conclusions made for solicited events.
Table 26 presents the number and percentage of AEs by age category (<65, 65-74, 75-84 and ≥85 years) 
for study RSV OA=ADJ-006, up to the data lock point (30 April 2022).
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 86/103
Table 26 Overview of adverse events up to data lock point by age category – Exposed Set (ADJ-
006)
In study ADJ-004, there is a trend toward lower reactogenicity when age is increasing. No meaningful 
differences were observed in the analyses of unsolicited AEs by age categories.
Aggregated analysis
 Medically attended unsolicited AEs: The observed percentage for the SOC ‘Nervous system 
disorders’ is higher in the ≥80 YOA category (1% [95% CI: 0.6, 1.7]) compared to the 60-69 YOA 
(0.3% [95% CI: 0.2, 0.4]) and 70-79 YOA (0.3% [95% CI: 0.2, 0.5] categories. The reported events 
are expected based on the comorbidities of the participants. By PT, no differences in percentage are 
observed.

SAEs: The observed percentages of participants with at least 1 SAE is higher in the ≥80 YOA 
category (6.6% [95% CI: 5.3, 8.0]) compared to 60-69 YOA category (3.9% [95% CI: 3.5, 4.3]), 
driven by the SOC “Nervous system disorders”. No imbalance by PTs is observed.

pIMDs: No difference was observed for subgroup analysis by age category

In the RSV OA=ADJ-006 study, the following observations were made in the RSVPreF3 group,

Solicited administration site events: The observed percentage of participants with solicited 
administration site events was lower in males vs. females for pain (50.3% vs. 69.7%) and erythema 
(4.5% vs. 10.0%). No differences were observed for swelling.

Solicited systemic events: The observed percentages of participants with solicited systemic events 
were lower in males vs. females for arthralgia (14.0% vs. 21.5%) and headache (20.0% vs. 33.2%). 
No differences were observed for fatigue and myalgia. Fever (≥ 38°C) was reported in 2.7% of 
female participants and 1.3% of male participants.

An imbalance was seen only for the PT ‘Urinary tract infection’ that was more frequently reported in females 
(0.4 [95% CI: 0.3, 0.6]) than males (0.1 [95% CI: 0.0, 0.2]). Incidence of this event is expected to be 
higher in women. No differences in SAEs or pIMDs were observed.

The goal of vaccination is to induce antibodies. Please refer to Adverse Events of Special Interest for an 
overview of pIMDs.
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions
Concomitant influenza vaccine
The proportions of participants with AEs, injection-site AEs, systemic AEs, and vaccine-related systemic AEs 
were generally comparable across concomitant and non-concomitant intervention groups, see Table 27. The 
proportion of participants who experienced SAEs was low, with 2 cases of disseminated encephalomyelitis 
being considered related to the FLU-QIV vaccine. Over the duration of the study, 4 (0.9%) participants in the 
Co-Ad group and 8 (1.8%) participants in the Control group died. Except for 1 case of disseminated 
encephalomyelitis, none were considered related to the study vaccines.
The most common type of related unsolicited AEs was injection site reactions in the Co-Ad group (1.6%) and 
in the Control group (1.1%).

2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events
Participants in study ADJ-006, ADJ-004 and ADJ-009 received a single dose of RSVPreF3 vaccine and, 
therefore, could not discontinue study intervention.
The number of discontinuations due to AEs is in all studies low, <2%. In study ADJ-006, discontinuations due 
to AEs were comparable between intervention groups: 0.6% in both the RSVPreF3 and placebo group. The 
number of discontinuations due to AEs is not expected to influence any of the conclusions drawn from the 
different studies.
AEs leading to discontinuation were reported across multiple SOCs.

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety
The clinical safety profile of RSVPreF3 was mainly derived from data obtained in study ADJ-006, which 
represents a major part of the overall exposure to the RSVPreF3 vaccine and is a placebo-controlled study 
conducted in the target population of older adults aged ≥60 years. The safety data is further supported by 
data from the other 3 Phase 3 studies (ADJ-004, ADJ-007 and ADJ-009) and a Phase 1/2 study ADJ-002 
(where appropriate). An aggregated analysis based on data pooled across all Phase 3 studies was performed 
for unsolicited adverse events (AEs) with a medically attended visit, serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-
serious/serious potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs).
Methods of collection of safety data were consistent across all Phase 3 studies. Reactogenicity as determined 
by solicited administration-site and systemic AEs was followed for 4 days, while non-serious, unsolicited AEs 
were followed for 30 days. In study ADJ-006, reactogenicity was determined in a subset of participants, 
which was agreed by CHMP. Therefore, in all other participants, not included in the solicited safety set (SSS), 
events considered solicited in the SSS were collected as unsolicited AEs. In all other Phase 3 studies, solicited 
AEs were collected in the exposed set (ES). In all studies, SAEs and pIMDs were collected up to 6 months or 
up to the data lock point. The strategy for collecting safety information was agreed by CHMP and led to a 
sufficient period to collect information on the outcome of the adverse events. 
No pooling of the safety data was performed, which was discussed and agreed upon with CHMP.
Exposure 
In total, >15000 participants were exposed to a vaccine containing 120µg RSVPreF3 adjuvanted with AS01E 
(Arexvy), of which 2411 were ≥80 years across all Phase 3 studies. In total 442 participants received the 
investigational RSVPreF3 vaccine concomitantly with FLU-QIV vaccine. The safety database, with over 15000 
subjects exposed to the investigational RSVPreF3 vaccine, is considered of sufficient size to describe common 
and uncommon adverse events.
As stated above, reactogenicity was only measured in a subset of participants in study ADJ-006. However, as 
the SSS contains 1757 participants, this ensures that the reactogenicity profile can be established accurately 
in comparison to placebo. The demographics of the SSS are similar between the RSVPreF3 and placebo group 
and largely comparable to the entire population.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 89/103
A vast majority of participants contributing to the safety database have been followed for at least 6 months, 
the safety database can be considered sufficient to support the evaluation of benefit-risk in the target 
population.
Solicited Adverse Events
In study ADJ-006, reactogenicity was evaluated in 1757 participants, of which 879 received RSVPreF3 and 
878 received placebo. Reactogenicity of the vaccine was higher compared to placebo, as all solicited AEs were 
experienced more frequently by participants in the RSVPreF3 group compared to participants in the placebo 
group. Within 4 days after vaccination, the percentage of participants experiencing at least 1 or more 
solicited AEs was 71.9% in the RSVPreF3 group versus 27.9% in the placebo group. 
Injection-site pain was the most frequently reported solicited AE (reported by 60.9% of participants in the 
RSVPreF3 group vs 9.3% in the placebo group), followed by fatigue (33.6% of participants in the RSVPreF3 
group vs 16.1% in the placebo group), myalgia (28.9% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group vs 8.2% in the 
placebo group) and headache (27.2% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group vs 12.6% in the placebo group). 
Fever (temperature ≥38 ˚C) was reported in few participants, although the percentage is higher in the 
RSVPreF3 group versus the placebo group (2.0% compared to 0.3%, respectively). The vast majority of 
solicited AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, with a low incidence of Grade 3 AEs (4.1% of participants in 
the RSVPreF3 group vs. 0.9% of participants in the placebo group experiencing any Grade 3 solicited AEs).
Across studies observations about solicited AEs were consistent, with a majority of participants experiencing 
1 or more solicited AEs, and injection-site pain being the most frequently reported solicited AE, followed by 
fatigue, myalgia and headache. In addition, across all studies most reactogenicity reactions were mild to 
moderate in intensity.
Limited information could be found on the duration of solicited administration site and systemic reactions, 
which was requested. The Applicant calculated both mean and median duration of solicited adverse events 
based on the duration of all solicited events including those that are ongoing beyond 4 days post-vaccination 
and provide an overview table with all solicited events on PT level lasting longer than 4 days, including 
duration. The median duration of solicited administration site and systemic AEs was short and comparable 
between the 2 treatment groups, between 1-2 days. The median duration of Grade 3 solicited AEs ranged 
from 1 – 4 days in the RSVPreF3 group and 2 – 4 days in the placebo group.
Unsolicited Adverse Events
In study ADJ-006 the solicited administration site and systemic AEs were collected as unsolicited AEs in 
participants not included in the solicited safety set (SSS). The percentage of participants experiencing an 
unsolicited AE was higher in the RSVPreF3 group (33.0%) compared to the placebo group (17.8%) in the ES, 
mainly driven by reactogenicity AEs collected as solicited AEs in the SSS. In the SSS, the percentage of 
participants experiencing unsolicited AEs was 14.9% in the RSVPreF3 group compared to 14.6% in the 
placebo group. In SOCs not linked to solicited AEs, no clear disbalance in percentage of participants 
experiencing PTs could be observed, except for investigations (63 [0.5%] participants in the RSVPreF3 group 
vs 17 [0.1%] in the placebo group).
Similar results were observed for the other Phase 3 studies, with unsolicited AEs being reported by 12.8% to 
14.8% of participants. The most frequently reported AEs were linked to reactogenicity of the vaccine. 
Overall, a vast majority of unsolicited AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, with the incidence of Grade 3 
unsolicited AEs being <2.5%.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 90/103
Related unsolicited adverse events were experienced by substantially more participants in the RSVPreF3 
group, 24.9%, compared to the placebo group, 5.8%.  
The following AEs considered possibly related to study vaccine are listed in 4.8: lymphadenopathy (including 
axillary pain), hypersensitivity reactions (such as rash), headache, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, 
myalgia, arthralgia, injection site pain, fatigue (including asthenia, lethargy and somnolence), injection site 
erythema, injection site swelling, fever, chills (including feeling cold), injection site pruritus, pain (pain in 
extremity) and malaise (including discomfort). Some PTs are clustered in a single ADR. For the clustered PTs, 
the frequency reported in the ADR table is based on the occurrence of all PTs that are clustered in a single 
term. 
The Applicant reviewed all hypersensitivity related AEs in all clinical studies and presented the information in 
tabulated format. Rash was the most frequently reported PT for hypersensitivity reactions.
Adverse events of special interest
Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) were collected as adverse events of special interest. The 
percentage of participants reporting pIMDs in the aggregated dataset was low, 0.4%. In study ADJ-006 there 
was no disbalance in reporting of pIMDs between treatment groups, with 0.4% participants in both the 
RSVPreF3 and placebo group reporting a pIMD. 
Of interest is 1 case of Guillain-Barré syndrome occurring 9 days after vaccination which was assessed as 
related to the vaccine by the investigator. Based on the narrative, the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre seems 
probable, and timing makes relatedness possible. However, as this is a single case, no strong conclusions can 
be drawn. It is deemed important to follow the occurrences of Guillain-Barré syndrome post marketing 
closely. Bell’s palsy assessed as possibly related to the study vaccine by the investigator occurred in 2 
participants in the RSVPreF3 group versus none in the placebo group. Due to concurrent illness in 1 
participant and time to onset of 196 days after vaccination in the other, relatedness to RSVPreF3 
administration is questioned in these cases. Finally, events of worsening of psoriasis and gout in studies ADJ-
006 and ADJ-009 were reported after vaccination. Currently there is insufficient information available to draw 
a clear conclusion on the causal relationship between vaccination with Arexvy and exacerbation of pre-
existing pIMDs based on these scant cases. Post-licensure, follow-up of pIMDs will occur in PSURs. 
Additionally, exacerbations of pIMDs will be determined in clinical trials.
Serious Adverse Events and Death
The proportion of participants with SAEs in the Phase 3 studies was <4.5% in all studies, which is in line with 
expectations in this elderly population. 
In study ADJ-006, the proportion of participants experiencing a SAE was similar in both treatment groups. The 
SAEs  occurred  in  similar  SOCs  in  both  treatment  groups,  with  the  most  commonly  reported  SAEs  being 
experienced in the SOCs of infections and infestations (107 subjects (0.7%) in the RSVPreF3 group and 115 
(0.9%) in the placebo group), cardiac disorders (91 subjects (0.9%) in the RSVPreF3 group and 86 (0.7%) in 
the placebo  group)  and  neoplasms  benign,  malignant  and unspecified (65  subjects  (0.5%) in the  RSVPreF3 
group and 58 (0.5%) in the placebo group). For the PT “Atrial fibrillation” a statistically significant difference 
with a RR of 7.02 (80% CI: 1.47, 75.62) was observed within 30 days post vaccination. Of the 14 events of 
atrial fibrillation reported, 10 in the RSVPreF3 group vs 4 in the placebo group, 6 events corresponded to new 
onset and 8 to recurrence of pre-existing atrial fibrillation. Although a statistically significant difference was 
observed between the groups, all events except one were observed in participants with pre-existing events of 
arrhythmias or with other risk factors/medical conditions.
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 91/103
The incidence of vaccination related SAEs was low; around 0.1% of participants experienced a SAE assessed 
as related to RSVPreF3. Considering none of the SAEs assessed as related to RSVPreF3 vaccine was reported 
by more than 1 participant, no strong conclusions can be drawn.
Over the course of the Phase 3 studies and the Phase 2 study, 80 participants administered RSVPreF3 died, 
which  is  not  unexpected  in  a  population  ≥60  years  of  age.  In  study  ADJ-006  no  notable  imbalance  in  the 
incidence of fatal SAEs was observed between the RSVPreF3 and placebo group. It is agreed with the Applicant 
that none of the deaths that occurred within the studies is related to RSVPreF3 or placebo. However, in a subset 
of participants reporting COVID-19 related AEs the Applicant reported a disbalance in fatalities, with 8 out of 
66  participants  in  the  RSVPreF3  group  vs  2  out  of  65  participants  in  the  placebo  group  died.  Although  the 
overall incidence of COVID-19 AE was similar between the groups, the number of participants with Covid-19 
AE with fatal outcome was fourfold as high in the RSV group as in the placebo group. The Applicant was asked 
to discuss this increased risk. A definitive explanation for the observed differences in occurrence of fatal cases 
of  COVID-19  between  the  treatment  arms  was  not  identified  by  the  MAH.  However,  currently  there  is  not 
enough evidence to suggest that vaccination with RSVPreF3 would expose recipients to a higher risk of fatal 
COVID-19 infection. Time to onset of ≥90 days after vaccination excludes an acute reaction. In addition, there 
is  no  indication  of  an  increase  in  disease  severity  of  COVID-19  which  is  expected  in  case  vaccine  enhanced 
disease would play a role. Finally, bias due to lack of structurally collecting COVID-19 cases and reported cause 
of death cannot be excluded.
Safety in special populations
Age
Solicited reactions were reported less frequently in older adults (≥ 80 years) compared to younger adults (60 
to 69 years), indicating a decrease in reactogenicity with increasing age. Even though reactogenicity 
decreased, the profile of AEs remained similar, with most commonly reported solicited administration site AE 
being injection-site pain and the most commonly reported systemic AE being fatigue, followed by myalgia. In 
addition, as expected an increase in medically attended unsolicited AEs and SAEs was observed with 
increasing age. Similar differences between younger (60 to 69 years) and older (≥ 80 years) adults were also 
seen in the placebo group.
Sex
Overall, the safety profile in the subgroups of sex was similar to the safety profile in the entire population, 
and no new safety signals were observed. However, reactogenicity was found to be higher in females 
compared to males. Higher rates of reactogenicity in females have been reported for different vaccines and 
do not impact the use of the vaccines. For SAEs and pIMD no difference was observed between males and 
females. For medically attended unsolicited AEs, the difference was driven mainly by urinary tract infections, 
which are known to occur more frequently in females compared to males.
Use in Pregnancy
Although the current application is for adults 60 years of age and older, the Applicant has also investigated an 
unadjuvanted  investigational  RSV  Maternal  (RSVPreF3)  vaccine.  This  development  programme  has  however 
been stopped due to observed imbalances in preterm birth. A higher proportion of neonatal deaths (death of 
an infant within the first 28 days of life) was also observed, which was considered to be a consequence of PTB.  
The vaccine formulation used in the RSV Maternal program contained 120 μg of RSVPreF3 antigen (the same 
as used in the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine), unadjuvanted. It can be agreed that neonatal death is not a separate 
signal,  but  most  likely  a  result  of  PTB.  The  root  cause  analysis  into  the  cause  of  the  PTB  is  still  ongoing. 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 92/103
Currently no conclusion on a causal relationship between administration of unadjuvanted RSVPreF3 and preterm 
birth can be drawn. Considering the composition of Arexvy is essentially the vaccine used in ADJ-009 plus an 
adjuvant, the information is considered relevant and is included in the SmPC, in light of the potential off-label 
use. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions
Concomitant injection with Flu QIV does not significantly affect the safety profile of RSVPreF3. The concomitant 
administration of Flu QIV with the investigation RSVPreF3 vaccine increases the reactogenicity profile. However, 
as a majority of AEs was mild in intensity and of short duration, the observation that the proportion of subjects 
experiencing  a  solicited  AE  was  somewhat  higher  compared  to  the  sequential  vaccination  is  not  considered 
clinically relevant. The occurrence of SAEs and pIMDs is balanced between the 2 groups and no new safety 
signals  were  detected.  However,  the  applicant  supplied  more  details  of  the  two  cases  with  respect  to  the 
plausibility of ADEM diagnosis. Neither of the reported ADEM cases included MRI and/or CSF analysis, therefore 
both cases contain insufficient information to definitively confirm an ADEM diagnosis. 
Discontinuation due to AE
68 participants in RSVPreF3 group and 72 participants in placebo group experienced an AE requiring expedited 
reporting. Only a listing was provided for the individual studies including all unrelated and related AE leading 
to discontinuation. The Applicant provided a summary for all related AE leading to study discontinuation for all 
studies. No questions arose from the data presented.
From the safety database, any adverse event reported in clinical trials that were considered as ADRs 
following qualitative and quantitative assessment have been included in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics.
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
Arexvy is a moderately reactogenic vaccine, with a majority of participants reporting 1 or more AEs; 
however, these were mostly mild or moderate in intensity and of short duration. The most frequently 
reported AEs by PT were solicited AEs: injection-site pain, fatigue, myalgia and headache. As expected, 
reactogenicity decreased with age. The proportions of participants with unsolicited AEs requiring a medically 
attended visit, pIMDs, SAEs and deaths in the RSVPreF3 group were low and comparable to the placebo 
group.
In conclusion, Arexvy is well tolerated in adults ≥60 years. Table 1 in section 4.8 of the SmPC reflects the 
frequency of ADRs.

The Applicant has not included any important identified risks. Based on the evaluation of safety data, it can 
be agreed that there are no important identified risks. 
There are no important potential risks identified. 
The Applicant indicated that the clinical trials excluded immunocompromised adults. Currently there is no 
indication that safety is of concern in this population. Follow-up as Committee Recommendation is considered 
appropriate: “the Applicant needs to submit the final study report for study RSV OA=ADJ-023 in 
immunocompromised participants, once available.” [REC]
For pregnancy and breastfeeding, the Applicant only states that the target indication of ≥60 should prevent 
use of the vaccine in that population. The Applicant has reported that enrolment and vaccination in RSV 
Maternal vaccine studies (using the same antigen as used in Arexvy) has been suspended because of an 
observed imbalance in the proportions of preterm births in the treatment group versus the Placebo group in 
one study. A higher proportion of neonatal deaths (death of an infant within the first 28 days of life) was also 
observed, which was considered to be a consequence of PTB. No further action is required for the RMP for the 
current indication in adults ≥60 years of age.

The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points.
2.9.  Product information
2.9.1.  User consultation
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions
None requested.
2.9.3.  Quick Response (QR) code
Not applicable. 
2.9.4.  Additional monitoring
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Arexvy [Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine 
(recombinant, adjuvanted)] is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance, 
which on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
3.1.1.  Disease or condition
RSV is a highly contagious human pathogen that causes respiratory tract infections in people of all ages. RSV 
infection does not confer long-term immunity; therefore, re-infection with RSV occurs throughout life and is 
common in all age groups. Usually, re-infections manifest as common acute upper respiratory tract 
infections. However, in more vulnerable individuals (e.g., immunocompromised persons or older adults), re-
infections can also lead to more severe diseases, involving the lower respiratory tract and lower respiratory 
tract disease (LTRD). 
It is estimated that each year RSV infections cause ~250 000 hospitalisations and ~17 000 deaths among 
older adults aged 65 years and older in Europe [Savic, 2020]. 
In adults, the highest burden of disease is in older people and those with comorbidities such as lung or heart 
disease and diabetes. In these patient populations, RSV can exacerbate conditions like chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, chronic heart failure leading to severe outcomes such as pneumonia, 
hospitalisation, and death.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Treatment
An antiviral agent, ribavirin, is licensed for the treatment of RSV infection in the United States and some EU 
Member States; however, it is not recommended in the United States or EU guidelines. Therefore, there is 
currently no specific treatment for RSV infections in older adults. Treatment for RSV in older adults is limited 
to supportive care consisting of supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids and bronchodilators. In addition, 
inhaled and systemic corticosteroids are often prescribed in patients with asthma or COPD.
Prevention
There is no licensed vaccine for the prevention of RSV-associated diseases. 
In children, 2 preventative options are available: Synagis and Beyfortus. Synagis (palivizumab) is a 
humanised monoclonal antibody indicated RSV for prophylaxis in children with a high risk of RSV disease, 
including preterm infants. Beyfortus (nirsevimab) is a human monoclonal antibody indicated for the 
prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in neonates and infants during their first RSV season.
Unmet medical need
RSV is the third most frequent cause (after influenza and rhinovirus, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic) of 
medically significant respiratory tract disease in adults and is a significant cause of disease burden in the 
older adult population. The impaired immune response in this population due to the ageing of the immune 
system (immunosenescence) and other risk factors, such as the presence of comorbidities and/or frailty, 
increase the risk of RSV disease and its complications. Older adults hospitalised with RSV infection can 
develop severe respiratory complications, particularly pneumonia, resulting in respiratory failure, the

requirement for supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospitalisation, and high 
mortality similar to seasonal influenza. Currently there is no specific treatment and no prophylactic vaccine 
available.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The main evidence for efficacy for Arexvy is based on a single pivotal observer blinded, randomised, placebo-
controlled trial (Study ADJ-006) conducted in 17 countries, 14 countries in the Northern hemisphere (US, 
Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Germany, Poland, UK, Spain, Russia, South Korea, and 
Japan) and 3 in the Southern hemisphere (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa). The trial was designed 
to demonstrate efficacy against RSV-confirmed LRTD occurring ≥ 15 days after administration of RSVPreF3 or 
placebo in adult participants ≥60 years of age until the occurrence of a prespecified number of blinded 
endpoints triggered the endpoint-driven efficacy analysis.
Study ADJ-006 enrolled healthy adults ≥60 years of age who were randomised 1:1 to receive a single dose of 
RSVPreF3 (n=12,471 participants) or placebo (saline, n=12,510 participants), intramuscularly. 
The efficacy analysis was event-driven, with 47 cases accrued to be included in the interim analysis.
3.2.  Favourable effects

Vaccine efficacy (VE) against RSV-confirmed LRTD: The confirmatory analysis in the modified 
exposed set (mES) at the interim analysis based on 47 accrued cases in study ADJ-006 indicated a 
VE point estimate of 82.6% with an adjusted 96.95% CI of 57.9% to 94.1%, meeting the 
prespecified study success criterion of an alpha-adjusted LL > 20%. A sensitivity analysis using a Cox 
regression model based on the mES population also showed that VE was >82% with LL >20%. In 
addition, this result was consistent with the VE observed in the exposed set (ES) and per protocol set 
for efficacy (PPSe) population, with VE in both populations being >81%. 




VE against RSV subtypes: The estimated VE against LRTD caused by RSV-A and RSV-B separately 
was >80%, with the LL of the 2-sided CI well above the pre-defined threshold of 20%.
VE by age category: There was no trend of declining VE when comparing VE in the age groups 60-
69 years of age (estimated VE of 81.0 [95% CI 43.6-95.3] based on 4 vs 21 cases) and 70-79 years 
of age (estimated VE of 93.8 [95% CI 60.2-99.9] based on 1 vs 16 cases). 
VE over time: Protection against RSV-confirmed LRTD was observed up to at least 6 months.
VE against ARI: The results for RSV-confirmed acute respiratory infection (ARI) are in line with the 
results for RSV-confirmed LRTD. The estimated VE against RSV-confirmed ARI was 71.7% (95% CI: 
56.2, 82.3). Protection against RSV-confirmed ARI was observed up to at least 6 months. No trend in 
declining VE was seen with increasing age.

Immune response: Across studies, a consistent humoral immune response was observed, with at 1 
month postvaccination a ~10-fold increase in RSV-A neutralising antibody titres, an ~8-fold increase 
in RSV-B neutralising antibody titres, and a ~12-fold increase in binding antibody titres. In addition, 
across studies it was observed that RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ but not CD8+ T-cells were induced.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
 Durability of VE response and need for revaccination. Data on vaccine efficacy is currently 
limited to approximately 6 months post-vaccination; therefore, there is no information on long-term 
protection by Arexvy. Descriptive evaluation of efficacy after the second and third RSV seasons in the 
NH are planned but are still outstanding. Data on this issue would be provided post-authorization.

VE in participants ≥80 years of age. Available data are insufficient to establish efficacy in 
participants ≥80 years of age. In the group aged ≥80 years in total 5 cases of RSV-confirmed LRTD 
(2/1,016 cases in the RSVPreF3 group vs 3/1,028 cases in the placebo group) were experienced.



Efficacy against severe LRTD and hospitalisation. Reliable efficacy estimates against severe 
LRTD and hospitalisation caused by RSV could not be established due to the lack of a sufficient 
number of cases within the clinical studies.
Immunocompromised populations. Data in high-risk immunocompromised populations is 
currently lacking. 
Persistence of immune responses in adults ≥ 60 YOA. Data from the immunogenicity study RSV 
OA=ADJ-004 showed that humoral and cellular immune responses increased from baseline to D31, 
but declined from D31 to month 6 (albeit to levels that were above baseline). The clinical relevance of 
this decline is unclear as there is no correlate of protection.

Correlate of protection. There is no correlate of protection known for RSV disease. Therefore, the 
immune response observed cannot be directly translated to efficacy or clinical benefit in adults. This 
hampers the interpretation of the observed vaccine-induced immunogenicity and the clinical 
relevance of meeting the non-inferiority margin for concomitant vaccination.
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
The clinical safety profile of RSVPreF3 was mainly derived from data obtained in study ADJ-006, which 
represents a major part of the overall exposure to the RSVPreF3 vaccine (12,467 participants vs 15,862 
overall). The median safety follow-up in study ADJ-006 was 7.8 months.
 Reactogenicity. In study ADJ-006, reactogenicity was evaluated in 1,757 participants, of which 879 
received RSVPreF3 and 878 received placebo. Injection-site pain was the most frequently reported 
solicited AE (reported by 60.9% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group vs 9.3% in the placebo group), 
followed by fatigue (33.6% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group vs 16.1% in the placebo group), 
myalgia (28.9% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group vs 8.2% in the placebo group) and headache 
(27.2% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group vs 12.6% in the placebo group). Solicited AEs were 
mostly mild to moderate in intensity, with 4.9% of participants in the RSVPreF3 group experiencing 
any Grade 3 solicited AE vs 0.9% in the placebo group. A consistent reactogenicity profile was 
observed in the different studies.
 Unsolicited AEs. Within 30 days after vaccination unsolicited AEs were reported more frequently in 
the RSVPreF3 group vs the placebo group (23.8% vs 18.7% in study -302 and 16.3% vs 14.8% in -
301). This was driven mainly by the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions, 
nervous system disorders and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, which mostly reflect 
the reactogenicity of RSVPreF3. A vast majority of all unsolicited AEs was mild to moderate in 
CHMP assessment report



intensity. A similar profile was observed in the different studies. In all studies (including study ADJ-
002), the incidence of Grade 3 unsolicited AEs was <2.5% of participants.
Potential immune-mediated diseases. In study ADJ-006, pIMDs were reported by 0.4% of 
participants in both the RSVPreF3 and placebo group.
SAEs. The proportion of participants with SAEs in the Phase 3 studies was <4.5% in all studies. In 
study ADJ-006, the proportion of participants experiencing a SAE was similar in both RSVPreF3 and 
placebo groups. None of the SAE considered related to investigational treatment was reported by 
more than 1 participants.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
 Guillain-Barré syndrome. A single case of Guillain-Barré syndrome possibly related to RSVPreF3 
vaccine was observed in study ADJ-004. As this is a single case, there is insufficient information 
available to determine the clinical impact. Follow-up post-licensure is warranted to investigate the 
incidence of GBS after vaccination with Arexvy further.  
 Worsening of pre-existing immune-mediated disorders. Two cases of pIMDs assessed as 
possibly related to the administration of RSVPreF3 considered worsening of a pre-existing immune-
mediated disorder, psoriasis and gout. Currently, no clear conclusion on the causal relationship 
between vaccination with Arexvy and exacerbation of pre-existing pIMDs cannot be drawn from these 
scant cases. Therefore, this will be followed-up in PSURs and clinical trials.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
RSV constitutes an important disease burden in the elderly population, leading to approximately 250,000 
hospitalisations and 17,000 deaths per year in the EU. To date no prophylactic vaccine is licensed and no 
treatment, other than supportive care, exists for the older adult population. Arexvy is intended for active 
immunisation for the prevention of RSV-associated LRTD in adults ≥60 YOA, which could potentially address 
(part of) the unmet medical need in the elderly population.
Overall, vaccine efficacy of a single dose of Arexvy administered IM has been demonstrated for the 
prevention of RSV-confirmed LRTD with the onset of at least 15 days after vaccination in adults ≥60 years of 
age based on the interim analysis of a single large pivotal phase 3 trial. In addition, an acceptable safety 
profile was observed.
The results are considered robust as comparable VE is observed in the different analysis sets and in a 
sensitivity analysis using Cox regression analysis. In addition, the results of VE analysis 2, based on data 
collected for the first full season (up to data lock point of 30 September 2022 or revaccination), are in line 
with the results of the interim analysis. The cumulative incidence curve suggests that vaccine efficacy 
remains high up to the end of a full season and for at least 11 months Further follow-up is expected as study 
ADJ-006 is currently ongoing and will be used to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of Arexvy over 
multiple seasons and the need for re-vaccination.
Subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint showed consistent results. Estimated VE was >80% in 
both the 60–69 year old and 70-79 year old subgroups, with no clear trend in declining VE with increasing 
age. In addition, in subjects with at least 1 pre-existing comorbidity of interest estimated VE was 94.6% 
(95% CI 65.9-99.9). These results are reassuring as age and comorbidities are known to increase the risk of 
severe RSV disease. Furthermore, the estimated VE against LRTD caused by either RSV-A or -B was >80% 
with a LL well above 20%, which is appreciated as the subtypes usually co-circulate. Finally, the results for 
efficacy against RSV-confirmed ARI are in line with the results of RSV-confirmed LRTD, though slightly lower, 
with an estimated VE against RSV-confirmed ARI of 71.7%. Similarly, analyses of other relevant subgroups 
(including hemisphere, region, ethnicity, race, sex, frailty) using all categories of the variables, showed 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/227054/2023
Page 100/103
consistency in the direction and magnitude of the treatment effect, except when there were very low number 
of cases, which is overall reassuring.
No reliable efficacy estimate can currently be established against severe RSV-confirmed LRTD or 
hospitalisation; however, it is likely that severe disease will be prevented as a consequence of preventing 
RSV-confirmed LRTD. RSV-confirmed LRTD in the population of adults ≥80 years of age can also not be 
reliably established based on the current information, as too few cases were accrued. 
After vaccination a substantial and consistent immune response was observed, with at 1-month 
postvaccination a ~10-fold increase in RSV-A neutralising antibody titres, an ~8-fold increase in RSV-B 
neutralising antibody titres, and a ~12-fold increase in binding antibody titres being observed across studies. 
However, considering there is no correlate of protection known for RSV disease, this immune response cannot 
be directly translated to efficacy or clinical benefit in adults. Information on the persistence of the immune 
response is limited. At 6 months after vaccination, the levels of neutralising and binding antibody titres were 
lower compared to 1 month after vaccination, however levels remained well above baseline. Similar 
tendencies were observed for kinetics of RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T-cell responses. No CD8+ T-cells were 
induced.
The documented safety exposure is sufficient for an adequate assessment of the safety profile of Arexvy. The 
observed safety profile is considered acceptable and is mainly characterised by reactogenicity reactions. The 
most frequently reported AEs were injection-site pain, followed by fatigue, myalgia and headache. 
Reactogenicity reactions were mostly mild to moderate, transient and self-limited. SAEs and pIMDs were 
infrequent in both the Arexvy and placebo groups. However, a single case of Guillain-Barré syndrome 
possibly related to RSVPreF3 vaccine was observed in study ADJ-004. As this is a single case, there is 
insufficient information available to determine the clinical impact of this observation. Further follow-up post-
licensure is warranted to gain more insight in the potential relation between RSVPre3F and Guillain-Barré 
syndrome.
No participants with severe immunodeficiency were included in the studies. As with other vaccines, such 
patients may not be protected as well as immunocompetent individuals by vaccination. In addition, safety 
information in these participants is lacking. Further data should be collected post-authorisation. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
The available clinical data for Arexvy, including the demonstrated vaccine efficacy against RSV-confirmed 
LRTD and ARI and induction of a robust immune response, establish the benefits of Arexvy in individuals 60 
years of age and older. There are no serious safety concerns. From a clinical perspective, a positive 
benefit/risk balance in the proposed indication of prevention of LRTD caused by RSV can therefore be 
established.
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance
Not applicable.

3.8.  Conclusions
The overall benefit/risk balance of Arexvy is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.
4.  Recommendations
Outcome
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Arexvy is favourable in the following indication:
“Arexvy is indicated for active immunisation for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) 
caused by respiratory syncytial virus in adults 60 years of age and older.
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.”
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

New Active Substance Status
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that Respiratory Syncytial Virus 
recombinant glycoprotein F stabilised in the pre-fusion conformation (RSVPreF3) produced in Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology, contained in the medicinal product Arexvy, is to 
be qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).

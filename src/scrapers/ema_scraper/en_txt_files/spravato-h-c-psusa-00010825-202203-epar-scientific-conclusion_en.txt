Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for esketamine (for centrally authorised 
product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on respiratory depression from spontaneous reports including in some cases a 
close temporal relationship, a positive re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the 
PRAC  Rapporteur  considers  a  causal  relationship  between  esketamine  (for  centrally  authorised  product 
only) and respiratory depression is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that 
the product information of products containing esketamine (for centrally authorised product only) should 
be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for esketamine (for centrally authorised product only) the CHMP 
is  of  the  opinion  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  medicinal  product(s)  containing  esketamine  (for 
centrally  authorised  product  only)  is  unchanged  subject  to  the  proposed  changes  to  the  product 
information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

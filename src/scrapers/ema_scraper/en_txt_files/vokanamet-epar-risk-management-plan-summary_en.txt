Summary of Risk Management Plan for VOKANAMET (Canagliflozin/Metformin 
Hydrochloride Fixed-dose Combination)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for VOKANAMET. The RMP details 
important  risks  of  VOKANAMET,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimized, and  how  more 
information  will  be  obtained  about  VOKANAMET’s  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing 
information).
VOKANAMET’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  (PL) 
provide essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how VOKANAMET 
should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  VOKANAMET  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
VOKANAMET’s RMP.
I. 
The Medicine and What it is Used For
VOKANAMET  is  authorized  for  treatment  of  adults  with  insufficiently  controlled  type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as an adjunct to diet and exercise (see SmPC for the full indication). 
VOKANAMET is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) containing canagliflozin and metformin as 
two different active substances. These are two medicines that work together in different ways 
to lower blood glucose (sugar) levels and can help prevent heart disease in adults with T2DM. 
It can be used by itself, or in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of 
diabetes.  It  also  can  be  used  in  patients  already  being  treated  with  the  combination  of 
canagliflozin and metformin as separate tablets. VOKANAMET is given as an oral film-coated 
tablet  (canagliflozin/metformin  hydrochloride  [HCl]  50 mg/850  mg,  50  mg/1000  mg, 
150 mg/850 mg, 150 mg/1000 mg).
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  VOKANAMET’s  benefits  can  be  found  in 
VOKANAMET’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vokanamet
II. 
Risks  Associated  With  the  Medicine  and  Activities  to  Minimize  or 
Further Characterize the Risks
Important  risks  of  VOKANAMET,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the 
proposed studies for learning more about VOKANAMET’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:


Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;


The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  the  case  of  VOKANAMET,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment so that immediate 
action  can  be  taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine  pharmacovigilance 
activities. 
II.A.
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks  of  VOKANAMET  are  risks that need special risk management activities to 
further  investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  taken. 
Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for 
which there is  sufficient proof of a link with the use  of  VOKANAMET.  Potential risks  are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

Risk  minimization 
measures
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) has been reported during postmarketing experience with 
canagliflozin  in  T2DM  patients,  including  cases  with  fatal  outcomes.  An  atypical 
presentation  (blood  glucose  values  less  than  13.9 mmol/L  [250  mg/dL])  has  been 
observed  during  postmarketing  surveillance  in  cases  of  DKA  for  canagliflozin  and 
across  the  class  of  sodium-glucose  co-transporter-2  (SGLT2)  inhibitors.  Cases  of 
ketoacidosis have occurred during off-label use of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 1 diabetes 
mellitus (T1DM) patients and in T1DM clinical trials (EMA, 2017). In an 18-week 
Phase  2  trial  in  subjects  with  T1DM  randomized  to  either  canagliflozin  or  placebo
(DIA2004), the frequency of DKA was higher than that observed in T2DM clinical 
trials.
The available clinical trial data suggest that patients diagnosed as having T2DM or 
misdiagnosed as T2DM (eg, T1DM, latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood), and 
who have a low beta-cell reserve, are unable to produce sufﬁcient insulin to suppress 
hepatic  ketogenesis  and  peripheral  lipolysis.  In  the  setting  of  known  DKA 
precipitating  factors,  such  as  an  acute  illness  (and  associated  increase  in  insulin 
resistance),  these  patients  can  develop DKA.  The  increased  rate  of  DKA  in  the 
CREDENCE  trial  was  observed  predominantly  in  subjects  in  the  lowest  eGFR 
stratum; which included subjects with a longer duration of diabetes, higher proportion 
of insulin use, and higher baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) than the overall 
population.

Important Identified Risk: Lactic acidosis
Evidence  for  linking 
the 
the 
medicine
risk 
to 
Risk  factors  and  risk 
groups
Risk  minimization 
measures
Evidence for lactic acidosis from metformin is based on the literature, including case 
reports, review of clinical trials and observational studies, as well as metformin drug 
labels. Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious metabolic complication that can occur due 
to metformin accumulation. Reported cases of lactic acidosis in patients on metformin 
have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal failure (Metformin 
SmPC,  2015).  Lactic  acidosis  has  been  reported  in  Phase 3/4  clinical  trials  when 
canagliflozin was given to subjects who were on a background of metformin, but at a 
lower incidence than observed in the comparator group.
Risk  factors  include  conditions  that  may  be  associated  with  or  promote  hypoxia, 
including heart failure, tissue hypoxia, respiratory failure, defective lactate clearance 
(alcohol abuse, and liver failure), renal impairment, renal or hepatic insufficiency. The 
risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient’s 
age.

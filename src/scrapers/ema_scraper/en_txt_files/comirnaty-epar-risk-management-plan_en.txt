Comirnaty
Centralised
Chemical class
Nucleoside-modified messenger RNA is formulated in LNP
Summary of mode of action
The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in Comirnaty is formulated in 
LNPs, which enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to 
direct transient expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits 
both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) 
antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19.
Important information about its composition
Comirnaty:
is nucleoside-modified messenger RNA formulated in LNPs;
is a white to off-white frozen dispersion
(pH:6.9 – 7.9).

Indication
Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in:


individuals 6 months of age and older (Comirnaty Original, Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5) 
individuals 12 years of age and older (Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1)
Incidence: 
The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus labelled as 
SARS-CoV-2.  The disease first emerged in December 2019, when a cluster of patients with 
pneumonia of unknown cause was recognised in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China1. The 
number of infected cases rapidly increased and spread beyond China throughout the world.  
On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern and thus a pandemic.2
Estimates of SARS-CoV-2 incidence change rapidly.  The MAH obtained incidence and 
prevalence estimates using data from Worldometer, a trusted independent organization that 
collects COVID-19 data from official reports and publishes current global and country
specific statistics online.3
As of 03 January 2023, the overall number of people who had been infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 was over 665 million worldwide, 4 Table 1 shows the incidence and 
prevalence as of 03 January 2023 for the US, UK, and EU-27 countries.  In the EU and the 
UK, by  03 January 2023 the total number of confirmed cases had accumulated to 204 
million, or 39,879 per 100,000 people. Across 27 countries in the EU, the number of 
confirmed cases ranged from 16,877 to 63,005 cases per 100,000 people. Romania and 
Poland reported the lowest incidence rates while France, Slovenia, and Austria reported the 
highest.4
In the US, the number of confirmed cases had reached over 102 million cases (30,671 per 
100,000 people) by 03 January 2023.4

The reported numbers refer to cases that have been tested and confirmed to be carrying the 
virus and sometimes, depending upon the country, also presumptive, suspect, or probable 
cases of detected infection.  There are large geographic variations in the proportion of the 
population tested as well as in the quality of reporting across countries.  People who carry the 
virus but remain asymptomatic are less likely to be tested and therefore mild cases are likely 
underreported.5

Further, as at-home rapid testing kits have become more readily available6 and formal testing 
resources reach capacity due to the Omicron variant, the true estimate of cases is estimated to 
be larger than formally reported counts.  The numbers should therefore be interpreted with 
caution.7  The variants from all SARS-CoV-2 specimens sequenced by the CDC during the 
week ending 31 December 2022 can be found in Figure 1 below, along with the variant 
proportions identified from the week ending 01 October through the week ending 31 
December 2022. Figure 2 shows the variant proportions of all EU countries from Weeks 38-
49, 2022.8

Prevalence:
The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is defined as active cases per 100,000 people 
including confirmed cases in people who have not recovered or died. On 03 January 2023, 
the overall prevalence estimates for the EU and UK were 669 and 119 active cases per 
100,000, respectively.4  The range of reported prevalence for EU-27 was 0 to 6,398 per 
100,000:Greece, Slovakia and Czech Republic reported the lowest prevalence while, 
Luxembourg, Poland and Estonia reported the highest (Table 1). It should be noted that 
Greece reported 0 active cases on 03 January 2023, leading to a prevalence estimate of 0 per 
100,000 population. 
In the US, the prevalence on 03 January 2023 was 584 active cases per 100,0004.
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication and risk factors for the 
disease:
Since the beginning of the pandemic, the ECDC has continuously collected COVID-19 
information from all EU/EEA member states.  In the ECDC’s TESSy database, COVID-19 
case-based data, including age and gender, are available for over 80% of the official number 
of cases reported by ECDC epidemic intelligence9 enabling estimates of age and gender 
distribution representative of the European population. The ECDC website posted a notice 
that the 04 November 2021 edition of the COVID-19 surveillance report would be the last 
and that it would not be updated in that form in the future.  Henceforth, surveillance data 
would be reported in a weekly “Country Overview Report” that provides less age-based 
information and no gender-based information.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance 
Network (COVID-NET) performs population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalizations in the US. Cases are identified by reviewing 
hospital, laboratory, and admission databases and infection control logs for patients who are 
hospitalized and have a documented positive SARS-CoV-2 test.12

Published studies have provided demographics of patients affected by COVID-19. In a study 
that analyzed data from 1,164 symptomatic, molecularly confirmed hospitalized (admitted 
between 5 May 2020 and 19 March 2021) COVID-19 patients from 20 different hospitals 
across the US, the median age was 59.0 years (intra-quartile range 20 years) and 61% of the 
patients were male.  The racial/ethnic distribution of the patients was 48% white, 22% black, 
5% Asian, 31% Hispanic and 65% non-hispanic.14
An observational, retrospective study examined patients ≥18 years old with confirmed 
COVID-19 presenting to the Emergency Departments of 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom, 
Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, predominantly during the first wave of the pandemic.  Those 
who were not admitted to hospital were a mean age of 51.6 (± 12.8) years old and 51.9% of 
them were male.  Those admitted to hospital were analyzed separately according to whether 
they survived or not.  The mean ages of those admitted were 62.5 (+/- 15.3) years and 62.6% 
were males for those who survived. For those who did not survive, mean age was 71.3 (+/-
12) years and 70.6% were male.15
Another study used data from the Primary Care Sentinel Cohort of the Oxford Royal College 
of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre database, which is considered to 
be nationally representative of the English population, to identify COVID-19 cases from 1 
March 2020 to 1 April 2021.  Overall, the investigators identified 395,680 persons with 
COVID-19 among the 7,382,775 persons registered in the database. The mean (sd) age of 
those infected was 44.56 (21.75) years; 55.6% of them were female; the racial distribution 
was 65.1% white, 2.8% black, 8.7% Asian, 2.3% other and 21.1% unknown; and 57% of 
them were from the “most deprived” socio-economic category.16

As of January 20, 2022, Omicron had been identified in all EU/EEA countries.17 The median 
age of the 155,150 cases reported to TESSy by EU/EEA countries up to that point was 30 
(interquartile range 20–33) years; 7% were aged 60 years and above and 50% were male.18
A study using data from 17 of 18 regional health agencies in France examined the 
demographic characteristics of 468 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant from 23 
November 2021 to 11 January 2022.  The cases were of a median age of 35 years, 55% 
female, and only 16% had pre-existing conditions (hypertension, obesity, diabetes, chronic 
respiratory disease, renal insufficiency, cancer, immunosuppression, liver disease, heart 
disease, neuromuscular condition, pregnancy, or other condition).18  A study of SARSCoV-2 
Omicron variant cases in Denmark used data from the routine Danish surveillance of 
COVID-19 in which information from several national registries is linked daily. As of 09 
December 2021, 785 cases of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron had been registered in Denmark. The
median age of the cases was 32 years (range 2 to 95) and 433 (55%) were male.19
In one US-based study, the mean age and gender distribution of persons infected with the 
Omicron variant of the COVID 19 virus was similar to that of persons infected with prior 
strains; the study, conducted using electronic health records from a large community health 
system, examined the outcomes of patients admitted to hospital for COVID-19 infection 
during 3 time  periods:  March 2020–June 2021 (pre-Delta period), July–November 2021 
(Delta period), and December 2021-February 2022 (Omicron period). Patients infected had a 
mean age 57.7, 58.8 and 61.0 years for the pre-Delta, Delta and Omicron periods, 
respectively, and were male 51.0%, 53.3% and 50.3 % for the pre-Delta, Delta and Omicron 
periods, respectively.20
A study in South Africa using data from 49 acute care hospitals compared demographic 
characteristics and outcomes in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 during 4 time periods: 
1. June to August 2020 (ancestral COVID-19 variant), 
2. November 2020 to January 2021 (Beta variant), 
3. May to September 2021 (Delta variant), and 
4.
(November 15 to December 7, 2021 (Omicron variant). Patients hospitalized during 
period 4 (Omicron) were younger (median age, 36 years vs 53-59 in the prior 3 periods), 
more likely female (60.8% vs 46.3–51.8% in prior 3 periods), less likely to have 
comorbidities (23.3% vs 52.5 -58.4% in prior 3 periods), and less likely to present with 
an acute respiratory condition (31.6% vs 72.6-91.2% in prior 3 periods).21
A similar study in the US used data from a genome sequencing study of SARS-CoV-2 in the 
Houston Methodist health care system. The authors identified 4468 symptomatic patients 
with infections caused by Omicron from late November 2021 through January 5, 2022. 
Compared with earlier patients infected with either Alpha or Delta variants in the health care 
system, Omicron patients were signiﬁcantly younger, more likely to be female, and more 
likely to be African American. Of note, this study found that the Omicron variant was 
associated with more vaccine breakthrough cases than previous variants of SARS-CoV-2.22

Another similar study described characteristics and outcomes abstracted from the electronic 
health records of adults aged ≥18 years admitted to one academic hospital with confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection during periods of Delta (July 15-September 23, 2021) and Omicron 
predominance (December 21, 2021-January 27, 2022) in Los Angeles, California. The 
authors reported that the median age of the patients admitted during the period of Omicron 
predominance was older (median 66 v. 60 years, p<0.01) than those admitted during the 
period of Delta predominance. The proportion of female cases was greater during the 
Omicron period (48.8% v 44.0%, p=0.15) but females were the slight minority compared 
with males during both the Delta and Omicron periods.  There was no difference in terms of 
race/ethnicity during the two periods.23
A CDC study of Omicron transmission within households in 4 US jurisdictions found that 
age was not related to transmission: Omicron attack rates were high across all ages regardless 
of vaccination status.24 A study of COVID-19 reinfections using Italian national data found 
that, during the period when Omicron was the dominant strain, those over age 60 had a 
greater risk of severe reinfection (i.e. severe symptoms during a second infection), but the 
elderly did not have greater risk for overall reinfections.25 In terms of race/ethnicity, a CDC 
study of 14 states found that during the Omicron-predominant period, peak hospitalization 
rates among non-Hispanic African American adults were nearly four times the rate of non-
Hispanic White adults and was the highest rate observed among any racial and ethnic group 
during the pandemic.26 This same 14-state CDC study found that, compared with the Delta-
predominant period, the proportion of unvaccinated hospitalized African American adults 
increased during the Omicron-predominant period.
An analysis of US data from 2020 showed that disease has been much less severe among 
ages 0-24 compared to ages ≥25 years, with 2.5% hospitalised, 0.8% admitted to an intensive 
care unit, and <0.1% dying among ages 0-24, versus 16.6% hospitalised, 8.6% intensive care, 
and 5% dying among ages ≥25 years.27  Early in the pandemic in the US, approximately 90% 
of hospitalized cases were over 40 years old, and the majority had been male, although 
currently there is an approximately equal distribution in sex.28 29 30 31 32
African American COVID-19 patients have been reported to have an increased risk of 
hospitalisation29 33 and mortality,34 compared to white patients in the United States.  A CDC 
report examined demographic trends among US COVID-19 deaths from May to August of 
2020.35 During the observation period, the percentage of US COVID-19 deaths that were 
Hispanic increased from 16.3% in May to 26.4% in August, this was the only racial or ethnic 
group among whom the percentage of deaths increased during that time.  
An earlier CDC report on excess deaths covering 26 January 2020 through 03 October 2020 
broke down excess deaths by demographics.36 By age during that period, the largest 
increase in deaths compared to average expected deaths occurred among adults aged 25-44 
(26.5% increase) while deaths among people <25 years was 2.0% below average during this 
period.  By race, increases in deaths compared to expectation were largest among Hispanics 
(53.6% increase), Asian Americans (36.6% increase), African Americans (32.9% increase).

In a 2021 report, the CDC data on Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19 reported that 
deaths in age groups 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, 85-84, and ≥ 85 years exceeded historical numbers 
from 2015-2019.37 An increase in deaths can be observed around week 35 that coincided 
with the wave of Delta variant infections, with the largest number of deaths occurring in the 
45-64 age group at 16,362.
While research earlier in the pandemic tended to focus on adults, more recent data have given 
greater attention to children and adolescents.  For the period January 01 - March 31, 2021 
across 14 states (the most recently available data), the CDC’s Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) - Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) database 
recorded 204 adolescents aged 12-17 who were hospitalized for likely primarily COVID-19-
related reasons.38   The 204 adolescents were 47.5% male consistent with the COVID case 
sex distribution across all ages and disproportionately from minorities, with 31.4% Hispanic 
and 35.8% non-Hispanic African Americans.38
For the period March 7, 2020 - December 24, 2022, the CDC’s COVID-NET database 
recorded that 6,434 children aged 0-4 had a positive COVID test proximal to hospitalization 
and  6,239 children aged 5-17 had a positive COVID test proximal to hospitalization.39
Another CDC report described demographic trends in US COVID-19 incidence among 
15,068 cases aged 0-24 years across 16 jurisdictions during the period 01 January 2020 
through 31 December 2020. 40 The report broke down incidence by age groups and 2020 
sub-periods that are presented in Table 4.  The table shows that early in 2020, 5-9-year-old
were experiencing less COVID-19 than 0-4-year-old, but by the end of the year this pattern 
had reversed.  Compared to 5-9-year-old, the age categories 10-14, 15-19, and 20-24 years 
old showed progressively greater incidence rates, a pattern that held throughout 2020.

Other US paediatric data are generally consistent with the CDC findings.  
Table 5 summarizes demographic results for a retrospective cohort of 135,794 individuals 
under the age of 25 who were tested for COVID-19 by 08 September 2020 within the 
PEDSnet network of US paediatric health systems.41 The table shows that, among the 
paediatric population, children aged 12-17 were more frequently infected than those under 
age 12.  African Americans and Hispanics had elevated frequencies of testing positive 
relative to their proportion of the cohort.

A study of 1,945,831 individuals aged 0-18 recorded in the Premier Healthcare Database 
between March and October 2020 included 20,714 paediatric cases of COVID-19; the 
authors reported similar patterns to what is shown in Table 5, with the additional observation 
that COVID-19 cases aged 0-1 and 12-18 years were more likely to develop serious illness 
than those aged 2-11.42   
A retrospective study of public health surveillance data in Denver, Colorado identified 9,815 
children and adolescents who had COVID-19 from March 1, 2020, through September 30, 
2021. The age distribution of those infected was as follows: <1 year 4.9%, 1-4 years 16.3%, 
5-10 years 29.6%, 11-13 years 18.4%, and 14-17 years 30.8%. The cases were 50% male and 
50% female.  The racial / ethnic distribution was Hispanic / Latino 57.3%, non-Hispanic 
White 29.0%, non-Hispanic Black 7.1%, and non-Hispanic other 6.5% from a base 
population that was Hispanic / Latino 46.3%, non-Hispanic White 36.9%, non-Hispanic 
Black 12.0%, and non-Hispanic other 4.9%.43

Risk Factors
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily through respiratory 
droplets and direct contact.44 Thus the risk of initial infection increases through spending 
time in close physical proximity to others, especially in indoor spaces with poor ventilation.45
People living in long-term care facilities or high-density apartment homes, or working in 
occupations with close proximity to others (e.g. healthcare, transportation), have a higher risk 
of infection.45 46 Among children, the primary source of infection is an infected adult living 
in the same household47 , but age is not associated with risk of initial infection among people 
aged 5 years and older based on current data from the CDC. 48 49
According to the CDC, some ethnic minority groups have a higher risk of infection (Table 
6).49   Male sex is also a significant risk factor for severe disease and mortality due to 
COVID-19.50  In addition, there is evidence that high-risk human leukocyte antigen 
haplotypes, higher expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphisms, and several 
genes of cellular proteases increase the risk of susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.51 52
Lastly, recent narrative reviews and meta-analyses indicate that Blood type O is associated 
with lower rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection; whereas type A is frequently described as a risk 
factor and is most often associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality.53 54

These differences in risk among ethnic groups may be attributed to differences in underlying 
factors that are correlated with race/ethnicity including socioeconomic status, access to health 
care, and occupation-related virus exposure.49
Children aged 5-17 typically experience a milder disease course and have lower risk of 
hospitalization or death.49,58 62 Further, among a cohort of children hospitalised with COVID-
19 in the United States from March 2020 to May 2021, infants and children 6 months - 4 
years of age had a similar risk of severe disease as children ages 12 - 17 years. 63
Risk of severe or fatal COVID-19 disease is also higher among persons who are current or 
former smokers, have lower socioeconomic status, have no or public insurance, or live-in
neighbourhoods with higher rates of limited English proficiency. 37,56 44 60 64 65 The CDC has 
also recognised other socio-demographic groups who may need to take extra precautions 
against COVID-19 due to increased risk for severe illness: pregnant women; breastfeeding 
mothers; people with disabilities or those who are clinically frail; people with developmental, 
behavioural or substance abuse disorders; and newly resettled refugee populations.66  
Among adults, risk for severe or fatal COVID-19 disease increases with the presence of 
chronic medical conditions, including obesity, chronic lung diseases (e.g., COPD), 
hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, liver disease, neurological diseases 
(e.g., stroke or dementia), chronic kidney disease, anaemia, sickle cell disease, 
immunosuppression, HIV, mycotic infection, vitamin D deficiency higher scores on the

A recent prospective observational study sought to better understand the association between 
characteristics of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the US and the risk of clinical 
outcomes and post-acute clinical sequalae of COVID-19 (PASC). 14  A total of 1,164 patients 
symptomatic patients admitted to 20 hospitals (affiliated with 15 academic institutions) 
across the US were enrolled.  Admission-specific data elements were acquired via review of 
electronic medical records at 5 separate time-points over a 28-day period. The patients’ 
disease severity was assessed at each time-point using a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 
not hospitalized/no limitations to death) based on World Health Organization and US 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease severity scales.  Data lock on the survey 
data was performed on April 7, 2022.  The median age was 59 years (interquartile range 20); 
711 (61%) were men; the overall mortality was 14%, and 228 (20%) of the patients required 
invasive mechanical ventilation.  The authors report that risk factors associated with 
prolonged hospitalization or death by day 28 included age ≥65 years, Hispanic ethnicity, 
elevated baseline creatinine or troponin, baseline lymphopenia, presence of infiltrate by chest 
imaging, and high SARS-CoV2 viral load.  Survivors were prospectively surveyed for 1 year 
after discharge through quarterly surveys. Of these 589 completed at least one survey at 
follow-up.  Three hundred five 52% of those completing at least one survey had at least one 
symptom consistent with PASC, most commonly dyspnoea. Female sex was the only 
associated risk factor for PASC).14

Another recent study by Tsai et al was conducted with the aim to estimate the global risk and 
risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome among patients with COVID-
19.  The authors performed a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of 
published studies from of patients in hospitals or nursing homes with acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) after COVID-19. Study inclusion criteria were: (1) the study 
provided primary data on the prevalence of ARDS using validated assessment tools or coded 
medical report data within a population-based study after COVID-19 occurred; (2) patients 
were diagnosed with COVID-19; and (3) the studies were observational, such as cohort and 
cross-sectional studies, and were published from 2019 to 2022. A total of 12 studies, 
conducted in 7 countries (including the US, China, Korea, India, Germany, Poland and 
Greece) were included. Six studies were retrospective three were cross-sectional, two were 
cohort studies, and one was a prospective study. All 12 studies were conducted with 
hospitalized patients. A total of 148,080 patients (50.8% male) were studied. The prevalence 
of ARDS among the studies ranged from 3.6% to 76.4%; the overall pooled risk was 23% 
(95% CI 14.3–34.7%) with significant heterogeneity within the 12 studies.  Based on the 
meta-analysis results, significant heterogeneity was identified among the studies for the risk 
of ARDS.  Therefore, a meta-regression analysis was conducted to identify factors affecting 
heterogeneity through the subgroups.  Meta-regression revealed that statistically significant 
risk factors for ARDS included: age ≥41 to 64 years, fever, multi-lobe involvement on chest 
X-ray, lymphopenia, mechanical ventilation with oxygen therapy, European region, and 
study sample size less than or equal to 500 patients.82
The presence of one or more underlying medical conditions also increases risk of severe or 
fatal disease among children aged 5-17. 83 84 85   In particular, childhood obesity has been 
consistently associated with two to three times the risk of severe disease or hospitalization86
87 87 and among hospitalized children with COVID-19 diabetes has been shown to increase 
the risk of death two-fold compared with those without diabetes.88 In addition, children and 
adolescents with obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiencies, malignancies, chronic 
respiratory diseases (cystic fibrosis, severe asthma etc.), and other chronic diseases are more 
susceptible to developing severe disease.89 For many other individual comorbid conditions, 
paediatric sample sizes are very small and different studies produce conflicting results, so it 
is difficult to estimate precise risk ratios based on current literature.58,84  
Several studies have examined the risk factors for infection with the Omicron variant and 
outcomes of the disease.  
The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) investigated the effectiveness of Omicron 
household transmission prevention strategies during November 2021 to February 2022. 
Persons with confirmed Omicron infection and their household contacts were interviewed. 
Omicron transmission occurred in 124 (67.8%) of 183 households. Among 431 household 
contacts of index Omicron cases, 227 were classified as having a case of COVID-19 (attack 
rate [AR] = 52.7%).  The AR was lower among household contacts of index patients who 
isolated compared with those of index patients who did not isolate (41.2% vs 67.5%, 
respectively; p <0.01).  Similarly, the AR was lower among household contacts of index 
patients who ever wore a mask at home during potentially infectious period (88 of 223) 
compared with those of index patients who never wore a mask at home (39.5%, vs 68.9%

respectively; p<0.01).24 The study also found that age was not a risk factor for Omicron 
transmission, as attack rates were high across all ages.24
A study of COVID-19 reinfections using Italian national data from August 2021 through 
March 2022 (periods of Delta and Omicron predominance) found that, for all variants, the 
strongest risk factor for reinfection, but not severe reinfection, was being unvaccinated (close 
to 3-fold) compared to those who were vaccinated for ≤120 days; the risk of reinfection was 
highest during Omicron regardless of vaccination status. Unvaccinated was defined as never 
received a dose or <14 days from 1st dose. Vaccinated was defined as at least 1 dose and ≥
14 days.  Reinfections were defined as infection ≥90 days after 1st infection.25 Having been 
vaccinated more than 120 days ago was also correlated with a greater risk of reinfection, 
presumably due to vaccine efficacy waning over time. Strikingly, reinfection with Omicron 
was 18 times the risk of reinfection with Delta regardless of vaccination status; however, 
severe reinfections with Omicron were only 0.37 times the risk of reinfection with Delta. In 
addition to risks of overall reinfections, the Italian study also looked at severe reinfections, 
that is, second infections in which the symptoms are severe.  They found that being over 60 
years old, and having had a severe first infection, were risk factors for a severe reinfection. 
We cannot exclude the possibility that some reinfections in the unvaccinated group are in 
individuals within 14 days of their 1st dose, known to be a susceptible period.
A CDC study of adults in 14 states found some evidence that race/ethnicity may have been a 
risk factor for COVID-19-related hospitalization during the Omicron-predominant period.  
The authors reported that peak hospitalization for any diagnosis in patients who tested 
positive during that time among non-Hispanic African American adults were nearly four 
times the rate of non-Hispanic White adults and was the highest rate observed among any 
racial and ethnic group during the pandemic.26  In this study, unvaccinated was defined as 
receiving no doses of vaccine.  This same 14-state CDC study found that, compared with the 
Delta-predominant period, the proportion of unvaccinated hospitalized African American 
adults increased during the Omicron-predominant period.
US FDA approved or authorized treatment options
Through January 2023, other COVID-19 vaccines were authorized and recommended for use 
in the United States including vaccines from Moderna (NCT04470427), and Johnson & 
Johnson/Janssen (NCT04505722). Others may subsequently be approved. The Pfizer-
BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, received FDA approval on 23 August 2021 for 
individuals 16 years of age and older 90 and received an emergency use authorization (EUA) 
in children 5 through 11 years of age on 29 October 2021.91 Novavax Adjuvanted COVID-19 
Vaccine received an EUA on 13 July 2022 for those 18 years of age and older. 92
EUA authority was also used to make treatments available in patients with COVID-19 ahead 
of formal approval. These products include direct treatment for COVID-19 infections and for 
other medical conditions in infected persons (Table 8).92

Symptoms of COVID-19
Symptoms of COVID-19 infection can range from very mild (or no symptoms) to severe or 
fatal.93 94 95 96 The most common symptoms for symptomatic infected persons are fever, dry 
cough, and fatigue; upper respiratory tract symptoms can include pharyngalgia, headaches, 
and myalgia.44  Current data indicate that about 80% of COVID-19 patients are 
asymptomatic or have mild-to-moderate symptoms, while about 15% develop more severe 
disease requiring hospitalization and about 5% require ventilation  support.44  In addition, 
10–20% of COVID-19-infected persons experience persistent or new symptoms for periods 
of weeks to years.44
The rate of asymptomatic infection decreases with increasing age and long-term care 
facilities are associated with a lower rate of asymptomatic infection when compared to 
household transmission or other healthcare facilities.96 The most common symptoms of 
COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath for both children and adults (Table 9).97
98 However, it has been noted that in older people, COVID-19 clinical presentation is 
extremely heterogeneous and atypical signs and symptoms such as hyporexia / apyrexia, 
confusion, delirium, and pre-syncope / syncope are more common than in middle-aged and 
younger persons. 99 A recent meta-analysis has estimated that 46.7% of infections in children 
are asymptomatic, while a recent systematic review that examined 1,140 cases of COVID-19 
in children from 23 published studies found that 11% of cases were asymptomatic. Among 
symptoms, fever was reported in 48%, cough 37%, any nasopharyngeal symptom 22%.100
In a more recent meta-analysis of 32 studies that provided information about COVID-19 
infection in paediatric patients the proportions with specific symptoms were as follows: fever 
33%, cough 25%, rhinorrhoea 13%, fatigue 9%, dyspnoea 9%, diarrhoea 6%, headache 9%, 
sore throat 7% and vomiting 7%.101

Among the first 43 cases of Omicron identified in the US between December 1-8, 2021, 93% 
were symptomatic.  The initial signs and symptoms reported were cough (89%), fatigue 
(65%), congestion or runny nose (59%), fever (38%), nausea or vomiting (22%), shortness of 
breath or difficulty breathing (16%), diarrhoea (11%), and loss of taste or smell (8%).102 In a
recent study of 338 cases in the Omicron period and 441 cases in the Delta comparator 
period, there was a decreased prevalence of self-reported loss of taste during the Omicron 
period (26.9% v. 57.4%, p<0.001).103  Although the majority of the 486 earliest cases of 
Omicron in France were symptomatic (89%), cases only reported mild symptoms that lasted 
a median of 4 days (IQR 2-7).18
The most common symptoms in hospitalized patients are fever (42-80%), shortness of breath 
(35-71%), fatigue (33-62%), cough (77-84%), chills (63%), myalgias (63%), headache 
(59%), and diarrhoea (33%).104 105 106 107
COVID-19 patients also commonly experience gustatory disorders (44%) and olfactory 
disorders (53%).108   Patients hospitalized in South Africa during the Omicron wave were 
less likely to present with an acute respiratory condition than in previous waves of the 
pandemic (31.6% v. 72.6-91.2%, p<0.001).21 Of note, among the 971 patients admitted 
during the Omicron wave 24.2% were vaccinated, 66.4% were unvaccinated, and vaccination 
status was unknown for 9.4%.21  Among non-hospitalised children < 18 years of age, 89% 
experienced one or more typical symptoms of COVID, including fever, cough, shortness of 
breath, and 22% experienced all three.105  Approximately 17% to 40% of those hospitalised 
with COVID-19 experience severe symptoms necessitating intensive care28 33 104 with 31% of 
children hospitalised experiencing severe COVID-19 that necessitates intensive care or

invasive ventilation or ends in death.  Risk factors for severe COVID-19 in hospitalised 
children include presence of a comorbid condition, younger age, and male sex.42,104  More 
than 75% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen.109
In their review of COVID-19 infection in children before and after Delta and Omicron 
variants, Khemiri et al report that the signs and symptoms of infection observed in paediatric
patients with Delta and Omicron variants are the same as those observed in children infected 
before the emergence of these variants. 110
Progression and Timeline of Mild to Moderate Disease
Mild to moderate disease is defined as the absence of viral pneumonia and hypoxia. For those 
who develop symptoms, the incubation period is usually 4 to 5 days, with 97.5% 
experiencing symptoms within 11 days of exposure.111 112 The average time from exposure 
to diagnosis was 3.7 days among 107 close contacts of Omicron-positive case patients, with 
70% being diagnosed by 5 days, and 99.1% being diagnosed by 10 days.113 Those with mild 
COVID-19 recover at home with supportive care and guidance to self-isolate.  Those with 
moderate disease are monitored at home and are sometimes recommended to be hospitalised 
if conditions worsen-.  Data on rates of re-infection are limited but variants may lead to 
increased risk of re-infection in the future. 100,111,114
Progression and Timeline of Severe Disease Requiring Hospitalisation
Those with severe disease will require hospitalisation to manage their illness. Based on data 
that have been systematically collected for the entire US by the CDC between 01 August 
2020 and 02 January 2023, there were 5,797,528 new hospital admissions for patients who 
tested positive for COVID-19 in the US.115 For the 50th week of 2022, 7.6 per 100 000 
population (country range: 1.3 - 19.5) were hospitalised due to COVID-19 in 14 countries of 
the EU/EEA with available data.116  As of 24 March 2022, 0.1-1.5% of children who tested 
positive for COVID-19 have been hospitalized (for any diagnosis) based on data reported 
from 25 states and New York City reporting, and 0.00%-0.01% of children with COVID-19 
have died based on data reported from 46 states, New York City, Puerto Rico and Guam.
Between 01 August 2020 and 02 January 2023, the CDC reports 175,603 total hospital 
admissions for patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the US for those 0-17 years of age.115
Studies early in the pandemic demonstrated that time from onset of illness to ARDS was 8-
12 days and time from onset of illness to ICU admission was 9.5-12 days.111  In 9 countries 
of the EU/EEA with available data, 0.5 per 100 000 population (country range: 0.1-1.3) were 
in the ICU due to COVID-19  during Week 49 2022.116  A meta-analysis found that, of 
patients <19 years of age, 11% went to the ICU, non-invasive ventilation was administered 
among 12%, and 4% required mechanical ventilation.94  A study of 82 cases in three 
paediatric hospitals noted that older children and those with higher body mass index or 
multiple comorbidities were more likely to receive respiratory support.117
A large number of patient characteristics (demographic/personal, comorbid conditions, 
complications of COVID) have been identified as being risk factors of severe COVID, or 
death from COVID (Table 10).

Risk Factors for Severe Disease and Poor Outcomes Associated with COVID-19 Variants
Recent studies have been published to identify risk factors for hospitalization with variants 
and according to vaccination status. One such study was conducted by the US CDC using 
data from COVID-NET, which conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-
confirmed COVID-19 associated hospitalizations in 99 counties across 14 states.  The 
authors examined COVID-19 associated hospitalization rates among adults aged ≥18 years 
during B.1.617.2 (Delta; July 1 - December 18, 2021; 4,852 cases) and Omicron (December 
19, 2021 - January 31, 2022; 829 cases) variant predominance, overall and by race/ethnicity 
and vaccination status. Vaccination status was identified using state immunization systems 
data and included the following statuses: unvaccinated, receipt of a primary series only, or 
receipt of a primary series plus a booster or additional dose. Hospitalization rates during peak 
Omicron circulation (January 2022) among unvaccinated adults remained 12 times the rates 
among vaccinated adults who received booster or additional doses (528.2 v. 45.0 per 
100,000) and four times the rates among adults who received a primary series, but no booster 
or additional dose (528.2 v. 133.5 per 100,000).  The rate among adults who received a 
primary series, but no booster or additional dose, was three times the rate among adults who 
received a booster or additional dose (133.5 v. 45.0 per 100,000).

During the Omicron-predominant period, peak hospitalization rates among non- Hispanic 
Black (Black) adults were nearly four times the rate of non-Hispanic White (White) adults 
and was the highest rate observed among any racial and ethnic group during the pandemic.26
A second study by the Los Angeles County (LAC) Department of Public Health was done by
a cross-sectional analysis of LAC residents aged ≥18 years with laboratory-confirmed SARS-
CoV-2 infection during November 7, 2021, to January 8, 2022.  Vaccination status was 
identified using a matching algorithm that links cases to immunization records.  Of 422,966 
reported SARS-CoV-2 infections in LAC residents aged ≥18 years, 33.6% (n=141,928) were 
in unvaccinated persons, 13.3% (n=56,185) were in fully vaccinated persons with a booster 
(considered fully vaccinated with a booster ≥14 days after booster) and 53.2% (n=224,853) 
were in fully vaccinated persons without a booster (≥14 days after primary series).  Hospital 
admissions for any reason ≤14 days after 1st lab-confirmed positive test were identified. 
Unvaccinated persons were more likely to be hospitalized, admitted to an ICU, require 
intubation for mechanical ventilation, or to die compared with persons who were fully 
vaccinated with a booster and those fully vaccinated without a booster.  Sequencing data 
were available for 1-18% of specimens during the Omicron period.  During the period of 
Omicron predominance (week ending January 8, 2022), 2.8% of unvaccinated people, 1.0% 
of fully vaccinated without booster, and 0.7% of fully vaccinated with booster were 
hospitalized. Unvaccinated persons had infection and hospitalization rates 3.6 and 23.0 
times, respectively, those of fully vaccinated persons with a booster and 2.0 and 5.3 times, 
respectively, higher than those of fully vaccinated persons without a booster. 127
Several international studies have examined the risk of serious disease or death associated 
with variants of the COVID virus. Chen at al conducted a multicenter observational study 
during the 2022 Omicron wave in Shanghai, China to examine the prognosis of infection 
with the Omicron variant among hospitalized patients who were “fragile” or who had “high-
risk” comorbidities.  Enrolled subjects were adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by 
real-time PCR between 20 March and 10 May 2022.  The primary outcome was progression 
to severe or critical disease consistent with WHO guidelines (Severe disease: one or more of 
oxygen saturation <93% on room air, signs of pneumonia, and signs of severe respiratory 
distress; critical disease: acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, or other 
conditions that would normally require the provision of life-sustaining therapies). The study 
population consisted of 847 patients, of whom 30.3% were age >70 years, 55.8% were not 
fully vaccinated, and 65.4% had at least one comorbidity (the five most common being 34% 
heart conditions, 18.5% metabolic disease, 18.4% chronic kidney disease [CKD] stage 4–5, 
17.1% isolated hypertension, and 12.5% cancer. A history of being bed-ridden long term was 
noted in 18.7%.  The overall rate for severe and critical cases was 11%. Multivariate analysis 
showed that comorbidities of CKD stage 4–5, cancer, and long-term bedridden history were 
risk factors for progression to severe or critical disease, whereas female sex, and 
fully/booster vaccinated were protective against progression to severe or critical disease.120
A study conducted in South Africa aimed to assess the clinical severity of COVID-19 in 
patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during the 
Omicron, Asp614Gly mutation, Beta variant, and Delta variant waves using data from an 
active surveillance program established specifically for COVID-19.128 Included patients had 
COVID-19 symptoms, were admitted for isolation, acquired nosocomial COVID-19

infection, or tested positive incidentally when admitted for other reasons from March 5, 
2020, to Jan 22, 2022. Severe COVID-19 disease was defined as one or more of development 
of acute respiratory distress syndrome, receipt of oxygen or invasive mechanical ventilation, 
or treatment in high-care or intensive-care units.  In patients with known clinical outcomes, 
52.3% in the Asp614Gly wave, 63.4% in the Beta wave, and 63.0% in the Delta wave met 
the criteria for severe disease, compared with 33.6% in the Omicron wave (p<0·0001).  The 
proportion of patients requiring supplemental oxygen and the median length of hospital stay 
was also lower in the Omicron wave than in the other three waves (p<0·0001 for each 
comparison). The in-hospital case-fatality ratio during the Omicron wave was 10.7%,
compared with 21.5% during the Asp614Gly wave, 28·.8% during the Beta wave, and 26.4% 
during the Delta wave (p<0·0001). On multivariable analysis, compared with those admitted 
to hospital in the Omicron wave, patients were more likely to have severe disease if they 
were admitted to hospital in the other 3 waves.  Other factors associated with severe disease 
in this patient population were older age, being male, being Indian (compared with being 
White), presence of a comorbidity, and the province of hospital admission.128
With respect to the paediatric population and variant disease, in the South African study 
mentioned above128 children and adolescents (<20 years) constituted 14.3% of total hospital 
admissions in the Omicron wave, compared with 3.3% in the Asp614Gly wave, 3.0% in the 
Beta wave, and 5.5% in the Delta wave. In children <5 years, the proportion of laboratory-
confirmed cases admitted during the Omicron wave was higher than in the other 3 waves 
(25.4% in Omicron vs 12.9%, 15.1% and 14.7% in the Asp614Gly, Beta, and Delta waves, 
respectively). In children and adolescents 5-19 years, the proportion of laboratory-confirmed 
cases admitted during the Omicron wave was also higher than in the other 3 waves (5.7% in 
Omicron vs 3.7%, 2.7% and 2.3% in the Asp614Gly, Beta, and Delta waves, respectively).  
However, the proportion of children and adolescents admitted to hospital who received 
supplemental oxygen, were treated in intensive care, or had severe disease was lower in the 
Omicron wave than in the other three waves.128  In their review of COVID-19 infection in 
children before and after Delta and Omicron variants, Khemiri et al report that these variants 
affected a large proportion of the younger population with presenting signs and symptoms 
generally similar to the original virus.  After the emergence of the Delta and Omicron 
variants the available information reported high hospitalization rates among children; 
nevertheless, clinical outcomes were similar or less severe compared to those in children 
infected before the emergence of these variants.110
In South Africa, significantly fewer hospitalized patients required oxygen therapy, 
mechanical ventilation, or intensive care during the Omicron wave than in previous waves of 
the pandemic.21 When compared to those who were hospitalized with the Delta variant 
(4,852 hospitalizations between July 1, 2021-December 18, 2021), those hospitalized with 
Omicron (829 hospitalizations between December 19, 2021-January 31, 2022) had a shorter 
length of stay (median 4 days v. 5 days, p<0.001), were less likely to be admitted to the ICU 
(16.8% v. 24.2%, p<0.001) and were less likely to receive invasive mechanical ventilation 
(7.6% v. 13.6%, p<0.001), based on data from COVID-NET.26

Mortality
According to a 2020 meta-analysis of paediatric studies published through October 2020, the 
mortality for paediatric patients 0.1-2%.27,94 In a study from January through June 2020 using 
the National Child Mortality Database (NCMD) in England, 5.7% of 437 children 0-17 years 
of age who died were SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive and those who died of COVID-19 were 
older and were more likely to be non-White ethnicity.129
Mortality data are presented from Worldometer, an independent organisation that publishes 
current, reliable COVID-19 statistics online.3 The mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 
defined as the cumulative number of deaths among detected cases. 
In the US, as of 03 January 2023, the mortality was 1,118,484 deaths (334 per 100,000 
people).  Mortality in the US was higher than that of the UK (290 per 100,000).4
Overall reported mortality among hospitalised COVID-19 patients varies from 12.8% to 26% 
in the EU, US and UK.33,35 130  131  Mortality rates are declining over time, presumably due to 
an improved understanding of COVID-19 and its management.132
hospitalized with the Omicron variant were less likely to die in the hospital than those with 
the Delta variant (7.0% v. 12.6%, p<0.001).26
In the US, patients 
Two recent publications (published prior to availability of the vaccine) describe efforts to 
develop models to predict mortality of patients with COVID-19. The first, by Vagliano et al, 
described and validated a predictive model, using data from electronic health records, for in-
hospital mortality of 972 COVID-19 patients admitted between 15 February 2020 and 1st 
January 2021 to the intensive care units of 19 hospitals during two different waves of the 
pandemic. In total 322 patients (33.1 %) died during their hospital stay. Survivors were 
significantly younger (61.0 vs 68.2 years) and were less often males (69.8 % vs 77.6 %) than 
non-survivors.  The strongest risk factors for mortality in the final model were older age, 
higher average fraction of inspired oxygen in the first 24 hours of admission, and higher 
maximum glucose in the first 24 hours of admission. A lower estimated glomerular filtration 
rate in first 24 hours of admission and higher neutrophil count in the first 24 hours of 
admission were other important risk factors for death.133
The second, by Sozio et al, was an observational, retrospective study that examined patients 
≥18 years old with confirmed (by real-time reverse-transcription PCR) COVID-19 presenting 
to the Emergency Departments of 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and 
Switzerland, predominantly during the first wave of the pandemic. The individual probability 
of being discharged directly from ED or of being admitted to hospital, with or without risk of 
mortality due to COVID-19, was estimated with several different implementations of 
machine learning models based on multiclass random forest classifiers. Analysis of Variance 
testing was performed according to admission and outcome status (not admitted, admitted 
and survived, admitted and died). Those patients who were admitted and died were older, 
more likely male, had higher serum creatinine levels, had lower platelet counts, had higher 
levels of mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM; an inflammatory biomarker that 
improves the prognostic assessment of patients with sepsis, septic shock and organ failure), 
higher white blood cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts, higher LDH, Procalcitonin, CRP

and D-dimer levels, and more often had comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, 
respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, and malignancy. 
The most important predictors of admission and death were in order of strength: MR-
proADM, age, LDH level CRP level, WBC count and platelet count. The authors presented a 
decision tree to facilitate interpretation of the most important interactions captured by the 
random forest classifier, in which age represents the predominant risk factor in determining 
the need for hospitalization, which is further enhanced by the patient’s levels of MR-
proADM and CRP.15
Complications of COVID-19 and Long-COVID
Complications of COVID-19 include impaired function of the heart/cardiovascular system,
134 135 136 137 brain/neurological system,138 139 lung, gastrointestinal/hepatobiliary system,140
kidney,141 142 metabolic/endocrine systems,143 and coagulation system.144 145 146   
Complications affecting the heart/cardiovascular system that have been observed include 
acute myocardial injury, acute coronary syndromes, venous and arterial thrombosis, 
cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, myocarditis, pericarditis, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, 
and right ventricular dysfunction.135  One recent review reports that the proportions of 
patients experiencing some of these complications are as follows: cardiac dysrhythmias in 17 
to 44%, cardiac injury with increases in blood troponin in 22 to 40%, myocarditis in 2 to 7%, 
heart failure in 4 to 21%, and thromboembolic events in 15 to 39%. 136 Another recent review 
indicates that injury to the myocardium has been reported in up to 30% of hospitalized 
COVID-19 patients and up to 55% in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. 137 In 
addition, it has been reported that long-term follow-up of Covid-19 patients has revealed 
increased incidence of arrhythmia, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, right ventricular 
dysfunction, and myocardial fibrosis.135
Neurologic complications of Covid-19 infection have also been extensively studied.   
Dimitriadis et al examined neurologic manifestations in critically ill Covid-19 patients in a 
prospective, multicenter, observational registry study of such patients admitted to 19 German 
ICUs between April 2020 and September 2021. During the study period, among the 15 ICUs 
that reported a total of 2681 admissions, 340 patients (12.7%) developed neurologic 
manifestations, the most common being encephalopathy (including delirium, disorder of 
consciousness, hypoxic encephalopathy, encephalopathy not further described), 
cerebrovascular disorders (including ischemic stroke, intra-cerebral haemorrhage, 
subarachnoid haemorrhage, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, reversible 
cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral microbleeds, 
subdural hematoma) and neuromuscular disorders (including polyneuropathy or myopathy, 
Guillain–Barré syndrome, myasthenia, myositis).138  
A meta-analysis on the incidence of seizures among Covid-19 patients by Hussaini et al 
included a total of 11,526 patients from 21 published articles. A total of 255 (2.2%; 95% CI 
0.05-0.24, p < 0.01) patients presented with seizures as the first manifestation of COVID-19.  
Only 71 of the 255 patients had previously been diagnosed with epilepsy.139

There are also psychological complications of Covid-19 infection.  
Khraisat et al conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of mental 
disorders among COVID-19 survivors. The analysis included 27 studies with a total sample 
size of 9605 Covid-19 survivors. The prevalence rates (95% CI) for psychological 
complications were as follows: overall psychological distress 36% (22–51%), post-traumatic 
stress disorder 20% (16–24%), anxiety 22% (18–27%), psychological distress 36% (22–
51%), depression 21% (16–28%), and sleeping disorders 35% (29–41%). 147  Also, a recent 
narrative review of the literature on post-acute neurologic sequelae of COVID-19 indicates 
that common conditions include persistent fatigue, headaches, “brain fog”, depression, and 
anxiety.148
Shih et al report that patients with COVID-19 can have GI and hepatobiliary manifestations, 
which are often mild and transient, although they can occasionally be severe. The most 
common consequential GI manifestation is ischemic enterocolitis.  Abnormal liver 
chemistries occur in 14-53% of Covid-19 patients, both at admission and during 
hospitalization. Typically, liver function test elevations are mild and recover without specific 
treatment.  Rarely patients with COVID- 19 may present with acute liver failure, develop 
primary liver disease during their illness, or develop post- COVID-19 cholangiopathy (a 
form of secondary sclerosing cholangitis).140   
Mallhi et al performed a review of 42 published systematic reviews on Covid-associated 
acute kidney injury (CAKI). They found that the incidence of CAKI ranged from 4.3% to 
36.4% overall among COVID-19 patients, 36%–50% in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), 
and up to 53% in patients with severe or critical illness. 141  Matsumoto and Prowle in their 
review of the literature on CAKI report that large observational studies and meta-analyses 
report an AKI incidence of 28-34% in all inpatients and 46-77% in patients admitted to the 
ICU. The majority of survivors recovered their kidney function by hospital discharge; 
however, they remained at increased risk of future AKI, a decline in estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR), and chronic kidney disease. Moreover, even in the absence of overt 
AKI a significant proportion of survivors of COVID-19 hospitalisation had reduced eGFR on 
follow-up.142
The risk of new onset diabetes mellitus was reported to be 66% (95% CI 1.38; 2.00) higher 
among survivors of COVID-19 compared with controls in a meta-analysis of eight studies 
consisting of 4,270,747 COVID-19 patients and 43,203,759 controls. 143
Other complications of COVID-19 include hemolytic anemia,149 endocrine disorders 
(including the thyroid, pancreas, adrenal, neuroendocrine, gonadal, and parathyroid glands)  
150 151, musculoskeletal disorders including persisting or new-onset fatigue, myalgia, 
arthralgia, arthritis, muscle weakness,152 opportunistic infections,81 and adverse pregnancy 
outcomes including preterm labour and caesarean delivery without any intrauterine infection, 
and severe neonatal asphyxia.153
A recent narrative review of coagulopathy associated with Covid-19 infection indicates 
thrombosis occurs as a result of the virus invading endothelial cells causing local 
complement activation and inflammation which leads to microvascular thrombi (both venous

and arterial), which may eventually lead to widespread macrovascular thrombotic injury and 
in some cases end-organ failure.145
Based on a meta-analysis of 42 studies, the risk of thromboembolism was 21% overall and 
31% in the ICU, with the pooled odds of mortality being 74% higher among those who 
experienced thromboembolism compared to those who did not.154
Complications of COVID-19 in pediatric populations
In children, multisystem inflammatory syndrome has been observed to be temporally 
associated with COVID-19 infection and often develop a rash following resolution of 
COVID-19.94 155 156   Complications include coronary artery aneurysms, cardiac dysfunction, 
and multiorgan inflammatory manifestations with  similarities to Kawasaki disease and other 
inflammatory conditions. Neonates born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection during 
pregnancy have also demonstrated a multisystem inflammatory syndrome with raised 
inflammatory markers and multi-organ dysfunction, especially of the heart.157
As of 03 January 2023, there were 9,333 cases of MIS-C reported to health departments in 
the United States with 76 deaths reported among those who met the MIS-C case definition.158  
Additional symptoms of MIS-C include abdominal pain, bloodshot eyes, chest tightness or 
pain, diarrhoea, lethargy, headache, low blood pressure, neck pain, and vomiting.159  
A recent narrative review of thromboembolic events (TEs) as complications of COVID-19 in 
children used data from 62 studies, describing 138 patients.  Venous TEs represented the 
majority (54%), followed by arterial thrombosis (38%, mainly arterial ischemic stroke), and 
intra-cardiac thrombosis (8%). Within the venous TEs group, pulmonary embolism was the 
most frequent, followed by deep venous thrombosis, central venous sinus thrombosis, and 
splanchnic venous thrombosis.160  A systematic review with meta-analysis of four studies to 
determine the incidence of thrombotic events in children and adolescent patients with 
COVID-19 infection reported that among 1,128 COVID-19 positive pediatric patients, nearly 
half of them developed inflammatory sequelae and 7.35% had thrombotic events.161
Recent studies have also shown that paediatric patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk 
of diabetes mellitus, particularly in the 30 days after their COVID-19 infection.162 163
Complications of Long-Covid
COVID-19 symptoms can persist weeks or months beyond the acute infection.164 165  The 
NICE guideline scope published on 30 October 2020 defined “Long COVID” signs and 
symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID‑19.  It includes both ongoing 
symptomatic COVID‑19 (from 4 to 12 weeks) and post‑COVID‑19 syndrome (12 weeks or 
more and for which signs and symptoms are not explained by an alternative diagnosis).166
A meta-analysis of 31 studies published until September 17, 2020 prior to the emergence of 
the Omicron variant among patients between 18 to 49 years of age found that COVID-19 
symptoms were experienced for 14 days to 3 months post-infection, including persistent 
fatigue (39-73%), breathlessness (39-74%), decrease in quality of life (44-69%), impaired 
pulmonary function, abnormal CT findings including pulmonary fibrosis (39-83%), evidence

of peri-/perimyo-/myocarditis (3-26%), changes in microstructural and functional brain 
integrity with persistent neurological symptoms (55%), increased incidence of psychiatric 
diagnoses (5.8% versus 2.5-3.4% in controls), and incomplete recovery of olfactory and 
gustatory dysfunction (33-36%).167  
Yang et al conducted a meta-analysis of 72 studies with a total of 88,769 patients to examine 
the occurrence of different symptoms up to one year of follow-up for previously hospitalized 
patients with COVID-19. A total of 167 sequelae related to COVID-19 were identified, the 
more common ones being fatigue 27.5%, somnipathy 20.1%, anxiety 18.0%, dyspnea 15.5%, 
PTSD 14.6%, hypomnesia 13.4%, arthralgia 12.9%, depression 12.7%, alopecia 11.2%. The 
prevalence of most symptoms declined after > 9 months of follow-up, but fatigue and 
somnipathy persisted in 26.2% and 15.1% of patients, respectively.168
The incidence of Long Covid is progressively greater among non-hospitalized to hospitalized 
to those hospitalized and treated in the ICU.  It varies from 16 and 53% of patients and 
occurs more frequently in patients after infection with the Alpha or Delta variants in 
comparison with patients infected with the Omicron variant.136 Major organ damage post-
discharge among adults hospitalized for COVID-19, including incident cardiac, pulmonary, 
liver, acute and chronic kidney, stroke, diabetes, and coagulation disorders were consistently 
greater in adults hospitalised for COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-controls in a meta-
analysis of nine studies with follow-up of patients ranging from 4 to 22 weeks post-
discharge.169   
Cardiovascular sequelae in post-acute COVID-19 include dyspnoea, chest pain, sinus 
bradycardia / dysrhythmias, palpitations and/or tachycardia, cerebrovascular disorders, 
pericarditis, myocarditis, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, thromboembolic events, right 
ventricular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, hypertension, 1 year. 136 135 134
Pulmonary symptoms and complications seen in long Covid include dyspnoea (occurring in 
15% of non-hospitalized patients and up to 81% of previously hospitalized patients), cough, 
chest pain, or decreased exercise tolerance.170
A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the long-term neurocognitive effects of 
COVID-19 in three studies comprised of 3,304 post-COVID-19 patients. Persistent 
neurological / cognitive sequelae of Covid-19 infection included headache 27.8%, fatigue 
26.7%, myalgia 23.14%, anosmia 22.8%, dysgeusia 12.1%, sleep disturbance 63.1%, 
confusion 32.6%, difficulty concentrating 22%, and psychiatric symptoms like PTSD 31%, 
feeling depressed 20%, and suicidality 2%.171  
Dangayach et al reports in a narrative review of the literature that neurologic complications 
in post-acute COVID-19 range from persistent fatigue, headaches, “brain fog”, depression, 
anxiety, and postural orthostatic tachycardia even in patients with mild disease.148  
Musculoskeletal disorders with long COVID, including persisting or new-onset fatigue, 
myalgia, arthralgia, arthritis, and muscle weakness, were noted in review of systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses that included 24 studies.152

Complications of Long-Covid in paediatric populations 
It has been estimated that up to 25% of the >14,000,000 children with COVID-19 in the year 
2019 have developed persistent symptoms of fatigue, post-exertional malaise, neurologic and 
cognitive symptoms, and other symptoms that interfere with activities of daily living for 
months after their initial illness; however more recent data suggest that the proportion of 
paediatric COVID-19 patients with long-term sequelae/symptoms is in the range of 3-10%.172
Post-acute COVID symptoms in children with asymptomatic or mild disease appear to be 
less severe than in adults, with the most common symptoms being a post-viral cough (4%), 
fatigue (2%), or both symptoms (1%) with the duration of symptoms lasting 3 to 8 weeks.173
174 89
Pellegrino et al performed a systematic literature review up to 15 February 2022 to 
summarize long COVID evidence and to assess prevalence and clinical presentation in 
children and adolescents. Twenty-two articles were included; 9 studies provided a control 
group. The authors found high variability in terms of prevalence (1.6–70%). The most 
frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (2–87%), headache (3.5–80%), arthro-myalgias 
(5.4–66%), chest tightness or pain (1.4–51%), and dyspnoea (2–57.1%). Five studies
reported limitations in daily function due to long COVID; most studies did not detect 
evidence of long-term pulmonary sequelae in these patients.175
Important co-morbidities:
As mentioned previously, there are a number of common comorbidities in patients with 
COVID-19; many of these conditions are also associated with more severe disease or 
progression of disease.  
Important comorbidities in those with more severe disease/hospitalised COVID-19 patients 
include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, 
chronic pulmonary disease or asthma, chronic kidney disease, cancer, chronic liver disease
and autoimmune disease.29-31,113,117 176 120 60 77 70 69 73 74 44 118 76 14 75 71 72
Prevalence of these conditions have been reported to be lower in mild cases and higher 
among fatal cases, as shown for European countries in Table 11 using TESSy data posted on 
12 August 2021177 below.

Table 12 below summarises comorbidities among US COVID-19 patients in a retrospective 
cohort study conducted among 629,953 individuals tested for COVID-19 in a large health 
system in the US Northwest between 01 March and 31 December 2020.37  
The most common comorbidities were similar in the full cohort and among those who tested 
positive: obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and asthma. Among those hospitalised for COVID-
19, a large number of comorbidities had elevated prevalence compared to the full cohort and 
those who tested positive: obesity, hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, congestive heart 
failure, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

In a retrospective cohort of 135,794 individuals under the age of 25 who were tested for 
COVID-19 by 08 September 2020 within the PEDSnet network of US paediatric health 
systems, the proportion of obese individuals was similar among those who tested negative 
(18%) and among mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (19%), but clearly elevated among 
severe COVID-19 cases (37%).41 Those with severe cases of COVID-19 more commonly 
had chronic conditions in at least two body systems, with 25% of COVID-19 negative 
individuals, 17% mild or asymptomatic cases, and 38% of severe cases having multiple 
chronic conditions.  More recent data provide insight into comorbidities among the paediatric
population.  For the period January 01- March 31, 2021 across 14 states, the CDC’s COVID-
NET database recorded 204 adolescents aged 12-17 who were hospitalized for likely 
primarily COVID-related reasons.38  Among the 204 adolescents, 70.6% had at least one 
major underlying medical condition, the most common conditions being obesity (35.8%), 
chronic lung diseases including asthma (30.9%), and neurologic disorders (14.2%).38
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis using published reports through August 25, 
2021 revealed that prematurity in young infants (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.63-2.46), obesity (RR, 
1.43; 95% CI, 1.24-1.64), diabetes (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.95–2.62), chronic lung disease (RR, 
2.62; 95% CI, 1.71-4.00), heart disease (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.58-2.09), neurologic disease 
(RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.05-1.33), and immunocompromised status (RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01–
2.04) were significant comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 (intensive care unit 
admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and/or death) in children.178

Crossfield et al performed a population-based prospective study linking individual genetic, 
biomarker, survey and electronic health record data from >500 000 UK participants, aged 
40–69 years at recruitment (2006– 2010). The study used individual patient-level data from 
the UK BioBank database, linked to COVID-19 data sets from laboratories, hospitals, and 
death certificates. The study population included those who provided baseline assessment 
data, were alive at the start of the study period and had not withdrawn consent.  All subjects 
had a COVID-19 diagnosis by a positive laboratory test result, or an ICD-10 code U071 or 
U072 recorded in hospital or death certificate data.  A cohort of 9560 patients with COVID-
19 of whom 50.8% (n=4,860) were women and 7,274 (76.1%) were White European were 
included.  The most common comorbidities of the study population included cardiovascular 
disease (12.8%), chronic respiratory disease (15.5%), chronic kidney disease (0.8), diabetes 
(7.1%), hypertension (28.6%), chronic liver disease (0.3%), and neurological disease (2.3%).  
The total number of comorbidities per subject was 0: 52.7%; 1: 31.7%  and ≥2: 15.6%. 60
Alharbi et al conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional observational of patients in a COVID-
19-designated specialty hospital in Saudi Arabia. Over an 11-month period from March 2020 
to January 2021, corresponding to the first wave of infection in the country when therapeutic 
interventions had limited options and were mostly dependent on a given patient’s condition.  
A total of 619 patients’ records (non-ICU = 369 and ICU = 250 patients, 61.4% male, 6.3% 
age 0-20 years, 16.8% age 21-40, 27.9% age 41-60, and 48.9% age >60) with confirmed 
COVID-19 diagnosed with a real-time PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 were included. The most 
common comorbidities of the study population included hypertension (59.8%), diabetes 
(47.2%), chronic pulmonary disease (28.6%), heart failure (13.2%), coronary artery disease 
(4.8%), and cancer (2.7%).118
A prospective observational study of hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and treated with advanced 
respiratory support (including high-flow nasal cannula, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 
or invasive mechanical ventilation) during the first two years of the pandemic was conducted 
by Reyes et al.  Included were a total of 66,565 patients from five continents (63.5% male, 
82.6% hospitalized and treated in high-income countries, 78.2% hospitalized and treated in 
Europe, 44.0% between 60 and 80 years old) were included.  The most common 
comorbidities of the study population included arterial hypertension (41.3), diabetes mellitus 
(30.3%), chronic cardiac disease (not hypertension; 22.1%), asthma (12.2%), chronic kidney 
disease 11.3%), obesity (16.2%), chronic pulmonary disease (not asthma; 13.3%), 
rheumatological disorder (8.1%), malignant neoplasm (7.7%), chronic neurological disorder 
(7.4%), and dementia 6.0%).179  
Ozonoff et al conducted a prospective, observational study of hospitalized patients with 
COVID-19 from 20 hospitals (affiliated with 15 academic institutions) across the US.   
Symptomatic patients ≥18 with confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were enrolled within 
48 hour of hospital admission.  Hospital admission data collected up to 11 November 2021 
was analyzed.  Between 05 May 2020 and 19 March 2021, 1,164 patients enrolled in the 
study and who met eligibility criteria were included in the final analysis. The median age of 
the study population was 59 years (interquartile range 20), 61% were men, and 32% smoked 
or used vaporized nicotine products.

Lastly, an observational study of all COVID-19 patients admitted to 19 Dutch ICUs 
participating in both the national quality registry National Intensive Care Evaluation and the 
EHR-based Dutch Data Warehouse as conducted by Vagliano et al. A total of 1,533 patients 
from the EHR and 1,563 from the registry were included.  Subjects were ≥18 years old and 
were admitted between 15 February 2020 and 01 January 2021 with confirmed COVID-19 
by positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for SARS-CoV-2 
or, in the early phase of the pandemic, with a CT-scan consistent with COVID-19. The 
authors developed multiple models on data from the first 24 hours of ICU admissions from 
February to June 2020 (first wave) and validated the models on prospective patients admitted 
to the same ICUs between July and December 2020 (second wave). The authors reported the 
prevalence of the following comorbidities during the first and second waves, respectively, as 
follows: acute renal failure (9.5% and 9.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease failure 
(9.5% and 9.1%), chronic respiratory insufficiency (3.2% and 2.0%), diabetes (21.5% and 
26.9%).133   
With respect to comorbidities among persons infected with the Omicron variant, little 
published data was found.  A study using data from 17 of 18 regional health agencies in 
France examined the demographic characteristics of 468 confirmed cases of the Omicron 
variant from 23 November 2021 to 11 January 2022. The cases were of a median age of 35 
years, and 55% were female.  Among the 278 cases in whom the information was known, 39 
(14%) had been previously infected with Covid-19.  Among the 394 cases with data on 
vaccination status, 92 (23%) were unvaccinated, 254 cases (64%) had received 2 doses of 
vaccine and 28 cases (7%) had received 3 doses.18 Only 16% had pre-existing conditions 
(hypertension, obesity, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, renal insufficiency, cancer, 
immunosuppression, liver disease, heart disease, neuromuscular condition, other condition, 
or pregnancy).  The prevalence of the individual comorbidities was not reported by the 
authors.18 It is possible that the low rate of comorbidities in this study population is driven by 
the relatively low age of the patients studied.
In the US (Virginia), data were collected from electronic medical records of adults (≥18 
years) with a diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1) hospitalized in a single health 
care system from 05 March 2020 to 05 February 2022 to evaluate hospitalized patients with 
COVID-19.20 The healthcare  system includes five hospitals in Virginia with a total of 1,800 
licensed acute care beds. The study period was constructed based on the most prevalent 
SARS-CoV-2 variant at the time as follows: March 2020 - June 2021 (pre-Delta), July -
November 2021 (predominantly-Delta), and December 2021 - February 2022 
(predominantly-Omicron). The prevalence of most common comorbidities of the study 
population, stratified by the variant that was predominant at the time of patient admission are 
shown in Table 13.20

Module SII. Non-Clinical Part of the Safety Specification
Nonclinical evaluation of BNT162b2 (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine) included pharmacology 
(mouse immunogenicity and NHP immunogenicity and challenge studies), pharmacokinetic 
(series of biodistribution, metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies), and toxicity (2 GLP rat 
repeat-dose toxicity) studies in vitro and in vivo.  A GLP DART study was also completed.  
No additional toxicity studies are planned for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Mouse 
immunogenicity studies were also conducted with variant modified vaccines.
Nonclinical studies in mice and NHP for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine demonstrated both a 
strong neutralizing antibody response and a Th1-type CD4+ and an IFN+ CD8+ T-cell 
response.  The Th1 profile is characterised by a strong IFNγ, but not IL-4, response 
indicating the absence of a potentially deleterious Th2 immune response and is a pattern 
favored for vaccine safety and efficacy.180  Rhesus macaques (Study VR-VRT-10671) that 
had received two IM immunisations with 100 µg COVID-19 mRNA vaccine or saline 21 
days apart were challenged with 1.05 × 106 plaque forming units of SARS-CoV-2 (strain 
USA-WA1/2020), split equally between the intranasal and intratracheal routes.181  COVID-
19 mRNA vaccine provided complete protection from the presence of detectable viral RNA
in the lungs compared to the saline control with no clinical, radiological or histopathological 
evidence of vaccine-elicited disease enhancement.  Variant-modified vaccines (BNT162b2 
Beta, BNT162b2 Omicron BA.1, and BNT162b2 Omicron BA.4/BA.5) evaluated either as 
monovalent formulations or also as bivalent formulations (Original + Variant) elicited robust 
neutralizing antibody responses in mice. Responses were generally highest against the variant 
matched to the vaccine; bivalent formulations provided a greater breadth of the antibody 
response in naïve mice compared to monovalent formulations.  When administered as a 3rd 
dose booster to mice that received 2 prior doses of BNT162b2, Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant 
vaccines elicited a more balanced response against Omicron sublineages compared to a 
booster with an Omicron BA.1 variant vaccine.
An intravenous rat PK study, using an LNP with the identical lipid composition as COVID-
19 mRNA vaccine, demonstrated that the novel lipid excipients in the LNP formulation, 
ALC-0315 and ALC0159, distribute from the plasma to the liver.  -While there was no 
detectable excretion of either lipid in the urine, the percent of dose excreted unchanged in 
faeces was ~1% for ALC-0315 and ~50% for ALC0159.  Further studies 
indicated- metabolism played a role in the elimination of ALC0315.  -Biodistribution was 
assessed using luciferase expression as a surrogate reporter formulated like COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine, with the identical lipid composition.  After IM injection of the 
LNPformulated RNA encoding luciferase in BALB/c mice, luciferase protein expression was 
demonstrated at the site of injection 6 hours post dose and expression decreased over time to 
almost reach background levels after 9 days-.  Luciferase was detected to a lesser extent in 
the liver; expression was present at 6 hours after injection and was not detected by 48 hours 
after injection.  After IM administration of a radiolabelled LNP-mRNA formulation 
containing ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 to rats, the percent of administered dose was also 
greatest at the injection site.  Outside of the injection site, total recovery of radioactivity was 
greatest in the liver and much lower in the spleen, with very little recovery in the adrenal 
glands and ovaries.  The metabolism of ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 was evaluated in blood, 
liver microsomes, S9 fractions, and hepatocytes from mice, rats, monkeys, and humans.

The in vivo metabolism was examined in rat plasma, urine, faeces, and liver samples from 
the PK study.  ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 are metabolised by hydrolytic metabolism of the 
ester and amide functionalities, respectively, and this hydrolytic metabolism is observed 
across the species evaluated.
In GLP toxicity studies, two variants of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidate were 
tested, designated “variant 8” and “variant 9” (V8 and V9, respectively).  The variants differ 
only in their codon optimisation sequences which are designed to improve antigen 
expression, otherwise the amino acid sequences of the encoded antigens are identical.  
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (V9) was evaluated clinically and submitted for application.  
Two GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies were performed in Wistar Han rats; one 
with each variant.  Both studies were 17 days in duration with a 3-week recovery period.  A 
DART study in Wistar Han rats has been completed.  Safety pharmacology, genotoxicity and 
carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted, in accordance with the 2005 WHO vaccine 
guideline.182
The IM route of exposure was selected for nonclinical investigation as it is the clinical route 
of administration.  Rats were selected as the toxicology test species as they demonstrated an 
antigen-specific immune response to the vaccine and are routinely used for regulatory 
toxicity studies with an extensive historical safety database.
Administration of up to 100 µg COVID-19 mRNA vaccine by IM injection to male and 
female Wistar Han rats once every week, for a total of 3 doses, was tolerated without 
evidence of systemic toxicity.  Expected inflammatory responses to the vaccine were evident 
such as oedema and erythema at the injection sites, transient elevation in body temperature, 
elevations in WBC count and acute phase reactants, and lower A:G ratios.  Injection site 
reactions were common in all vaccine-administered animals and were greater after boost 
immunisations.  Changes secondary to inflammation included slight and transient reduction 
in body weights and transient reduction in reticulocytes, platelets, and RBC mass parameters.  
Decreased reticulocytes were reported in rats treated with the licensed LNP-siRNA 
pharmaceutical Onpattro™ (NDA # 210922) but have not been observed in humans treated 
with this biotherapeutic183 suggesting this is a species-specific effect.  Decreased platelet 
counts were noted after repeat administration, but were small in magnitude of change, likely 
related to inflammation-related platelet activation and consumption, and unassociated with 
other alterations in haemostasis.  Elevated levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase were 
observed in the first repeat-dose toxicity study with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (V8) without 
evidence of cholestasis or hepatobiliary injury but was not recapitulated in the second repeat 
dose-toxicity study with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (V9), the final clinical candidate.  All 
changes in clinical pathology parameters and acute phase proteins were reversed at the end of 
the recovery phase for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, with the exception of low magnitude 
higher red cell distribution width (consistent with a regenerative erythroid response) and 
lower A:G ratios (resulting from acute phase response) in animals administered COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine.  Macroscopic pathology and organ weight changes were also consistent with 
immune activation and inflammatory response and included increased size and/or weight of 
draining iliac lymph nodes and spleen.  Vaccine-related microscopic findings at the end of 
the dosing phase consisted of oedema and inflammation in injection sites and surrounding 
tissues, increased cellularity in the draining iliac lymph nodes, bone marrow and spleen and

hepatocyte vacuolation in the liver. Vacuolation of portal hepatocytes, the only test article-
related liver microscopic finding, was not associated with any microscopic evidence of 
hepatic injury or hepatic functional effects (i.e., liver functional enzymes were not elevated) 
and may be associated with hepatocyte uptake of the LNP lipids.184  Microscopic findings at 
the end of the dosing phase were partially or completely recovered in all animals at the end 
of the 3-week recovery period for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. A robust immune response 
was elicited to the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine antigen.
Administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine to female rats twice before the start of mating 
and twice during gestation at the human clinical dose (30 µg) was associated with non-
adverse effects (body weight, food consumption and effects localized to the injection site) 
after each dose administration.  However, there were no effects of COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine administration on mating performance, fertility, or any ovarian or uterine parameters 
in the F0 female rats nor on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development in the 
F1 offspring.  An immune response was confirmed in F0 female rats following 
administration of each vaccine candidate and these responses were also detectable in the F1 
offspring (foetuses and pups).
In summary, the nonclinical safety findings related to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
administration primarily represent an expected immune reaction to vaccine administration 
and are clinically manageable or acceptable risks in the intended population.  The key safety 
findings regarding COVID-19 mRNA vaccine from nonclinical studies and their relevance to 
human usage are presented in Table 14. There was no evidence of vaccine-elicited disease 
enhancement.

Toxicity
Injection site reactions:
Injection site reactions were common and reversible or 
showed signs of reversibility at the end of the 3-week 
recovery period in nonclinical studies. 
Inflammation and immune activation:
Evidence of inflammation or immune activation was 
common, reversible, and included transiently higher 
body temperature, higher circulating WBCs, and higher 
acute phase reactants.  Secondarily, transiently lower 
body weights, reticulocytes, platelets, and RBC mass 
parameters were observed.
Relevance to Human Usage
Suggests low risk of vaccine-enhanced disease in 
humans; being investigated in CTs.
In common with other vaccines, COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine administration has the potential to 
generate injection site reactions such as oedema 
and erythema at the injection sites.
In common with all vaccines, COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine administration has the potential to 
generate inflammation which can lead to 
increased body temperature, higher circulating 
WBCs and higher acute phase proteins.
Decreased reticulocytes have not been observed in 
humans treated with the LNPsiRNA 
pharmaceutical Onpattro183, suggesting this 
finding in rats is a species-specific effect.
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine administration has the 
potential to transiently decrease platelets and RBC 
mass parameters. These transient decreases are
anticipated to be slight and are not likely to be 
clinically meaningful.
No effects are anticipated in WOCBP, pregnant 
women or their offspring.
Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity
No vaccine-related effects on female fertility or the 
development of fetuses or offspring were observed in a 
DART study of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in rats.

Module SIII. Clinical Trial Exposure
Four vaccine candidates were evaluated in Study BNT162-01. Based on safety and 
immunogenicity results from this study, 2 vaccine candidates, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, 
were selected for evaluation in Study C4591001, which is a Phase 1/2/3 randomised, 
placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate -selection, and efficacy 
study in healthy adults.
Phase 1 of Study C4591001 comprised dose-level–finding evaluations of the 2 selected 
vaccine candidates; multiple dose levels (some corresponding to those evaluated in 
Study BNT162-01) were evaluated.  Study vaccine was administered using the same 2-dose 
schedule as in Study BNT162-01 (21 days apart). Dose levels were administered first to an 
18- to 55-year age cohort, then to a 56- to 85-year age cohort.
Both vaccine candidate constructs were safe and well tolerated.  BNT162b2 at the 30-µg
dose level was selected and advanced to the Phase 2/3 expanded cohort and efficacy 
evaluation primarily because:


the reactogenicity profile for BNT162b2 was more favourable than BNT162b1 in both 
younger and older adults with similar immunogenicity results.
in the NHP challenge study (VR-VTR-10671 – see Module SII), a trend toward earlier 
clearance of BNT162b2 was observed in the nose.
Phase 2 of the study C4591001 (for which enrolment has completed) comprised the 
evaluation of safety and immunogenicity data for the first 360 participants (180 from the 
active vaccine group and 180 from the placebo group, with each group divided between the 
younger and older age cohorts) entering the study after completion of Phase 1.
The Phase 3 part of the study C4591001 (which is ongoing) evaluates the efficacy and safety 
in all participants (including the first 360 participants from Phase 2).  Phase 3 introduced 
enrolment of participants 16 to 17 years of age to be evaluated with the 18- to 55-year-old 
cohort, as well as enrolment of a 12- to 15-year-old cohort, and immunogenicity data from 
participants 12- to 15-year-old cohort are anticipated to bridge to the 16- to 25-year-old 
cohort.
Booster groups were subsequently added to evaluate boostability and protection against 
variant virus strains.
The pivotal study was initially planned to enrol approximately 30,000 participants, which 
would have a probability of 78% of detecting an AE with a frequency of 0.01% (1/10000) 
and a probability of 95% of detecting an AE with a frequency of 0.02% (1/5000).  
The protocol was amended to enrol approximately 46,000 participants, which slightly 
enhanced the ability to detect AEs. However, rarer events might not be detected.

Risk Management Plan
October 2023
Participants in the pivotal study were initially planned to be followed for up to 24 months in 
order to assess the potential for late-occurring adverse reactions, such as the theoretical risk 
of VAED including VAERD.  After completing the final efficacy analysis with vaccine 
efficacy shown to be 95%, and obtaining regulatory authorisation to vaccinate in many 
countries, MAH started to unblind all participants to determine those participants randomised 
to placebo so that they could be offered vaccine in accordance with local authorisation.  In 
study C4591001, the total follow-up time from Dose 1 to unblinding for the 21,926 
participants in the vaccine group was 83.4 person-year and for the 21,921 participants in the 
placebo group was 82.2 person-years.
The efficacy analysis in the 12 years and older population for the primary series, the analysis 
of 6-month post dose 2 data in the 16 years and older population and the evaluation of 
booster effects and/or protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, in 
participants 18 to 55 years of age have been reported out in previous RMPs. Refer to Annex 
7 for CT exposure.
Analysis of 6-month post Dose-3 data was conducted on 12 to 15 years of age who received 
the BNT162b2 booster at the cut-off on 03 November 2022. Clinical trial exposure tables are 
provided in Annex 7 (Table 28 to Table 30).
Further evaluation for the paediatric population (5-<12 years of age) has been conducted in 
study C4591007 (see Annex 7 from Table 31 to Table 38).
Phase 1 is the dose finding portion of the study. Dose levels were tested in sentinel cohorts of 
children by age de-escalation, starting with the lowest dose level in the oldest age group. For 
each age group, the dose level identified as safe and tolerable and immunogenic in 
C4591007.  Phase 1 was advanced for further evaluation in Phase 2/3.
Phase 2/3 (which is ongoing) was planned to evaluate BNT162b2 at the selected dose levels 
for each age group for safety and tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy (depending on 
meeting success criteria for immunobridging and accrual of a sufficient number of COVID-
19 cases). An immunobridging analysis was designed to compare SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing 
antibody responses in paediatric participants within each age group in Study C4591007 to a 
group of young adult participants 16 to 25 years of age in the C4591001 efficacy study.
The study design was modified (Amendment 6) to provide the necessary safety and 
immunogenicity data to support an EUA and future licensure of a booster (third) dose of 
BNT162b2 to maximize the protection against variants of concern including Delta and 
Omicron as seen in real-world vaccine effectiveness in older age groups. 
Exposure to the booster (3rd) dose of BNT162b2 for participants aged 5 to <12 years of age 
by demographic characteristics is shown in Annex 7 (Table 39 and Table 40). In addition, 
exposure in special population for participants 5 to <12 years of age who received a booster 
(3rd) dose is shown in Annex 7 (Table 41).
Further evaluation for the paediatric population (from the 2 to <5 years and 6 months to <2 
years of age) has been conducted in study C4591007 (which remains ongoing).

Module SIV. Populations Not Studied in Clinical Trials
SIV.1. Exclusion Criteria in Pivotal Clinical Studies Within the Development 
Programme
Detailed descriptions of all inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical studies are provided 
in the individual CSRs.
Inclusion criteria
 Healthy participants who are determined by medical history, physical examination 
(if required), and clinical judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in the 
study. 
 Healthy participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring 
significant change in therapy or hospitalisation for worsening disease during the 6 weeks 
before enrolment, can be included.  For the overall Phase 3 study population to be as 
representative and diverse as possible, the inclusion of participants with known chronic 
stable infection with HIV, HCV, or HBV was permitted as the study progressed.  Specific 
criteria for these Phase 3 participants can be found in the Section 10.8 of C4591001 
protocol.
 Study C4591001 Phase 2/3 only: Participants who, in the judgment of the investigator, 
are at higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 (including, but not limited to, use of mass 
transportation, relevant demographics, front-line essential workers and others).
 The participants enrolled in Study C4591001 were 12 years of age and older; with the 12-
to 15-year-old cohort included in the protocol starting from October 2020.
 The participants enrolled in Study C4591007 were 5 to <12 years, 2 to <5 years, and 6 
months to <2 years of age.
 The participants enrolled in C4591031 Substudy E and Substudy D were 18 years of age 
and older.
 The participants enrolled in C4591048 Substudy D were 5 to <12 years and in Substudy 
B were 2 to <5 years, and 6 months to <2 years of age.
Exclusion criteria
Phase 1 exclusion criteria were stricter than criteria in Phases 2 and 3 of the study.  
Participants were excluded from the studies according to the general criteria listed below:
Previous vaccination with any coronavirus vaccine
Reason for exclusion: To avoid confounding the assessment of serological or clinical 
immune response in the study population.
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No.

Risk Management Plan
October 2023
Rationale: Minimal potential clinical impact on the target population.
Previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19
Reason for exclusion: Phase 1 excluded participants with a previous clinical or 
microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19 because these participants may have some 
degree of protection from subsequent infection by SARS-CoV-2 and therefore would 
confound the pivotal efficacy endpoint.  
During Phase 2/3, participants with prior undiagnosed infection were allowed to be 
enrolled.  Screening for SARS-CoV-2 with nucleic acid amplification test by nasal swab 
or antibodies to non-vaccine SARS-CoV-2 antigen by serology was not conducted before 
vaccine administration in Phase 2/3, but samples were taken to run these assays after 
vaccination, thus identifying participants with unidentified prior infection.  This group 
will be assessed to identify whether prior infection affects safety.
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No.
Rationale: Safety in study participants with prior infection was assessed in the pivotal 
study.
Immunocompromised individuals with known or suspected immunodeficiency, as 
determined by history and/or laboratory/physical examination
Reason for exclusion: Immunocompromised participants may have impaired immune 
responses to vaccines and would therefore limit the ability to demonstrate efficacy, which 
is the primary pivotal endpoint.
Is it considered to be included as missing information? Yes.
Rationale: Participants with potential immunodeficient status were not specifically 
included in the study population.  However, since the study population is intended to be 
as representative as possible of the vulnerable population to COVID-19 illness, 
sub-analyses of immunogenicity data in future studies may provide further understanding 
of immune responses in this population.
Receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulin, from 60 days before study 
intervention administration or planned receipt throughout the study
Reason for exclusion: To avoid confounding the assessment of serological or clinical 
immune response in the study population.
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No.
Rationale: No impact on the safety of the target population.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

Risk Management Plan
October 2023
Reason for exclusion: To avoid use in a vulnerable population.
Is it considered to be included as missing information? Yes.
Rationale: Maternal vaccination with COVID 19 mRNA vaccine has been studied in 
C4591015 to explore unexpected negative consequences to the embryo or foetus.
Other medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the past year) or active 
suicidal ideation/behaviour or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk of 
study participation or, in the investigator’s judgment, make the participant 
inappropriate for the study
Reason for exclusion: To avoid misleading results deriving from non-compliance to study 
procedures.
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No.
Rationale: Safety profile of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is not expected to differ in these 
subjects when properly administered.
SIV.2. Limitations to Detect Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trial Development 
Programmes
The clinical studies are limited in size and, therefore, unlikely to detect very rare adverse 
reactions, or adverse reactions with a long latency.
SIV.3. Limitations in Respect to Populations Typically Under-Represented in Clinical 
Trial Development Programmes
There has been limited exposure to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in some special populations 
and no epidemiologic studies have been conducted in pregnant/breastfeeding women, 
paediatric participants (<12 years of age), and specific subpopulations that were excluded 
from the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine program.

Pregnant women
Exposure
There is limited experience with use of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in pregnant 
women.  Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with 
respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post-natal 
development.  Administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in pregnancy 
should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential 
risks for the mother and foetus.

Breastfeeding women were not initially included in the COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine clinical development program.
It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is excreted in human milk.  
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered 
along with the mother’s clinical need for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and any 
potential adverse effects on the breastfed newborn/infant/toddler from COVID-
19 mRNA vaccine or from the underlying maternal condition.  For preventive 
vaccines, the underlying maternal condition, complicated by underlying risks, 
is susceptible to disease prevented by the vaccine.

The number of doses cumulatively administered (as per public available data for the EEA5
countries, the US6, and Japan7) is currently updated on a bi-weekly base. Considering the 
current status of the vaccination schedule and the availability of only partial data published 
on the ECDC websites for doses of BNT162b2 vaccines (original and bivalent) administered 
in the EU-EEA countries,8 it is no longer applicable to estimate the number of doses 
administered from those shipped. Estimated administered doses were provided separately, as 
available on the public source data.
Approximately 4,615,732,0259 doses of BNT162b2 (original and bivalent) were shipped 
worldwide from the receipt of the first temporary authorisation for emergency supply on 01 
December 2020 through 18 June 2023.  The worldwide estimated cumulative number of 
shipped doses by vaccine presentation, region and countries and by age group based on data

Module SVI. Additional EU Requirements for the Safety Specification
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine does not have characteristics that would make it attractive for use 
for illegal purposes; therefore, there is only a low potential for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine
misuse for illegal purposes.
Module SVII. Identified and Potential Risks
In accordance with EMA RMP guidance for COVID-19 vaccines, the below factors were 
taken into consideration for the generation of the safety specification and are not determined 
to be identified or potential risks.
 The vaccine construct and the formulation.  The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine consists 
of non-infectious, non-replicating RNA in a lipid-based formulation, which delivers the 
RNA to cells in the immunised person.  Protein expression from the RNA is transient, 
and as is RNA itself.  There is no systemic toxicity associated with the LNP or its 
metabolism (Study reports 38166 and 20GR142). Vacuolation of hepatocytes was 
observed in rat toxicity studies and believed to be associated with the uptake of the LNP 
and was without evidence of any effect on liver function.  The liver vacuolation was 
reversed approximately 3-weeks after the last administration.
 The degradation of the active substance / antigen and potential impact on safety 
related to this; (e.g., for mRNA-based vaccines).  Like endogenous mRNA in the 
cytosol, vaccine RNA in cytosol is degraded. The COVID-19 mRNA contains no known 
toxic products of the degradation of the RNA or the lipids in the formulation.
 The vaccine does not contain an adjuvant.
SVII.1. Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission
The safety concerns of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in the initial RMP are listed in Table 56.

SVII.1.1. Risks not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP
Not all potential or identified risks for the vaccine are considered to meet the level of 
importance necessitating inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP.
Reasons for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
this RMP include:
Risks with minimal and temporary clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of 
the disease prevented).
The following reactogenicity events are identified risks not considered as Important: 
Injection site pain, Injection site swelling and Injection site redness, Pyrexia, Chills, Fatigue, 
Headache, Myalgia, and Arthralgia.
Very rare potential risks for any medicinal treatment, including vaccines, which are well 
known to healthcare professionals are not included in the list of safety concerns.
In acknowledgment of the EMA core RMP19 guidance, the reactogenicity profile of 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is discussed below with respect to observed differences in 
solicited reactogenicity systemic events between Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3. The observed 
differences do not impact the safety profile of the vaccine and are not proposed to be 
included in the list of safety concerns, rather they are discussed for completeness in the 
presentation of the safety profile.

C4591048 Substudy B Group 2 Subset (≥6 Months to <5 Years of Age: Booster (Fourth 
Dose) With BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 3 µg
In this initial subset of 60 participants, the frequencies of local and systemic reactions 
reported within 7 days after administration of BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 
3 µg were lower than the frequencies previously observed in association with BNT162b2 
within the respective age group.
C4591048 Substudy D Group 2 (≥5 to <12 Years of Age): Booster (Fourth Dose) With 
BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 10 µg
The reactogenicity profile within 7 days after BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 
was generally similar to that previously observed in association with BNT162b2 within the 
respective age group.
C4591044 Cohorts 2 (≥12 Years of Age) and 3 (≥18 Years of Age): Booster (Fourth 
Dose) of BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) at 30 or 60 µg
The reactogenicity profile within 7 days after BNT162b2 Bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 
vaccine was generally similar to that previously observed in association with booster doses of 
an Omicron BA.1-modified BNT162b2 bivalent vaccine and to BNT162b2 within the 
respective age groups at the same dose. Both local reactions and systemic events for 
participants who received the 30-µg dose level tended to be lower for adults >55 years of age 
compared with younger participants (18 through 55 years of age). There was an observed 
dose dependency for reactogenicity between the BNT162b2 bivalent (WT/OMI BA.4/BA.5) 
30- and 60-µg groups with most local reactions and systemic events reported more frequently 
after a 60-µg dose, which is consistent with prior observations for BA.1-modified bivalent 
and monovalent vaccines.
C4591031 Substudy E (Expanded Cohort >55 years of age) 
Local Reactions
Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction within 7 days after study 
vaccination, with swelling and redness at the injection site reported much less frequently. 
Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity and all events resolved within a 
median duration of 1 to 2 days after onset.
Systemic Events
Fatigue was the most frequently reported systemic event reported within 7 days after study 
vaccination, followed by headache, and less frequently chills, muscle and joint pain. 
Vomiting, diarrhoea and fever were the least frequently reported systemic events. Most 
systemic events were mild or moderate in severity and all events resolved within a median 
duration of 1 to 2 days after onset.

C4591031 Substudy D (18 to 54 years of age)
Local Reactions
Any local reactions reported within 7 days after first study (Dose 4) vaccination for Cohort 2 
participants were similar in the BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg (78.6%) and BNT162b2 30 µg 
(79.4%) groups. Most events were mild or moderate in severity, with the majority arising 
within the first 1 to 2 days after dosing and were short-lived. No Grade 4 local reactions were 
reported.
Systemic Events
Any systemic events reported within 7 days after first study (Dose 4) vaccination for Cohort 
2 participants were similar in the BNT162b2 OMI 30 µg (77.6%) and BNT162b2 30µg 
(72.9%) groups, and most events were mild or moderate in severity, with the majority arising 
within the first 1 to 2 days after dosing and were short-lived. No Grade 4 system events were 
reported.
Participants 16 years of age and older
The reactogenicity data were collected by participants’ e-diary for reporting prompted local 
reactions and systemic events for 7 days after each dose.
Local Reactions 
 Phase 1, Study BNT162-01
Local reactions generally increased in frequency and/or severity with increasing dose level 
and number of doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.  Most local reactions were mild or 
moderate in severity and resolved within several days of onset.  For COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine, incidence of local reactions was generally less after each dose in the older group 
(56-85 years) compared with the younger group (18-55 years), and severity of reactions was 
similar between both age groups.
 Phase 3, Study C4591001
In the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine group, pain at the injection site was reported more 
frequently in the younger group (16-55 years) than in the older group (> 55 years), and 
frequency was similar after Dose 1 compared with Dose 2 of COVID-19 mRNA in the 
younger group (83.7% vs 78.3%) and in the older group (70.1% vs 66.1%).
In the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine group, frequencies of redness and swelling were similar in 
the younger and older age group after Doses 1 and 2. Frequencies of redness were similar 
after Dose 1 compared with Dose 2 of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in the younger age group 
(5.4% vs 5.6%) and in the older age group (5.3% vs 7.2%). Frequencies of swelling were 
similar after Dose 1 compared with Dose 2 of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in the younger age 
group (6.3% vs 6.8%, respectively) and in the older age group (7.0% vs 7.8%). In the placebo

group, redness and swelling were reported infrequently in the younger (≤1.0%) and older 
(≤1.2%) groups after Doses 1 and 2.
Overall, across age groups, pain at the injection site did not increase after Dose 2, and 
redness and swelling were generally similar in frequency after Dose 1 and Dose 2.  Severe 
redness and swelling were reported infrequently and were similar between the younger and 
older age groups (≤0.7) after any dose. Severe pain at the injection site occurred more 
frequently in the younger age group compared to the older age group (2.5% vs 0.7%). After 
the first and second dose and in both age groups, the majority of local reactions were mild or 
moderate in severity, and no Grade 4 local reactions were reported.   
The median onset for local reactions after either dose was between Day 1.0 and Day 2.0 
(Day 1.0 was the day of vaccination) in the younger age group and between Day 1.0 and 
Day 3.0 in the older age group. Local reactions resolved with median durations between 1.0 
and 2.0 days in both age groups. 
For local reactions the frequency of redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site after any 
dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine was 8.5%, 10.2%, and 80.2% compared with 9.9%, 
11.1%, and 84.5% for those SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative at baseline, respectively. 
While the frequency of local reactions was numerically higher in those negative at baseline, 
these differences are not clinically meaningful.
Systemic Events 
 Phase 1, Study BNT162-01
Systemic events generally increased in frequency and/or severity with increasing dose level 
and number of doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Most systemic events were mild or 
moderate, arose within the first 1 to 2 days after dosing, and were short-lived. For COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine, the incidence of systemic events after each dose was similar in the older 
group (56-85 years) compared with the younger group (18-55 years). Reports of severe 
systemic events were similar between the younger and older COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
groups.
 Phase 3, Study C4591001
Systemic events were generally increased in frequency and severity in the younger group 
(16-55 years of age) compared with the older group (>55 years), with frequencies and 
severity increasing with number of doses (Dose 1 vs Dose 2).  Vomiting and diarrhoea were 
exceptions, which were reported similarly infrequently in both age groups and at similar 
incidences after each dose.
Systemic events in the younger group compared with the older group, with frequencies 
increasing with number of doses (Dose 1 vs Dose 2), were:
fatigue: younger group (49.4% vs 61.5%) compared to older group (33.7% vs 51.0%)
headache: younger group (43.5% vs 54.0%) compared to older group (25.0% vs 39.4%)

myalgia: younger group (22.9% vs 39.3%) compared to older group (13.6% vs 28.9%)
chills: younger group (16.5% vs 37.8%) compared to older group (6.5% vs 23.4%)
arthralgia: younger group (11.8% vs 23.8%) compared to older group (8.7% vs 19.0%)
pyrexia: younger group (4.1% vs 16.4%) compared to older group (1.3% vs 11.8%)
vomiting: younger group (1.2% vs 2.2%) compared to the older group (0.5% vs 0.7%)
diarrhoea: younger group (10.7% vs 10.0%) compared to the older group (8.4% vs 8.2%).
Systemic events were generally reported less frequently in the placebo group than in the 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine group, for both age groups and doses, with some exceptions. In 
the younger age group, vomiting and diarrhoea (after Dose 1 and Dose 2) were reported at 
similar frequencies in the placebo group and the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine group. In the 
older age group, vomiting and diarrhoea (after Dose 1 and Dose 2) were reported at similar 
frequencies in the placebo group and the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine group.
Following both Dose 1 and Dose 2, use of antipyretic/pain medication was slightly less 
frequent in the older age group (19.0% vs 37.0%) than in the younger age group (27.8% vs 
45.2%) after both doses, and medication use increased in both age groups after Dose 2 as 
compared with after Dose 1.  Use of antipyretic/pain medication was less frequent in the 
placebo group than in the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine group and was similar after Dose 1 and 
Dose 2 in the younger and older placebo groups (ranging from 9.3% to 13.7%).
Severe pyrexia (>38.9°C to 40.0°C) increased in frequency with the number of doses (Dose 1 
versus Dose 2) in younger (0.3% vs 1.5%) and older (0.0% vs 0.4%) participants who 
received COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and was reported in 0.1% of participants who received 
placebo in both age group after both doses. One participant in the younger COVID-19 
mRNA vaccine group reported pyrexia of 41.2°C only on Day 2 after Dose 2 and was 
nonfebrile for all other days of the reporting period. Grade 4 pyrexia was not reported in the
older COVID-19 mRNA vaccine group or in any placebo participants. 
After the first and second dose and in both age groups, the majority of systemic events were 
mild or moderate in severity.  
Systemic events in the younger and older age groups after either dose had a median onset day 
between Day 2.0 and Day 4.0 (Day 1.0 was the day of vaccination) and resolved with a 
median duration of 1 day in both age groups.  
For any pyrexia (mild, moderate, severe or grade 4) after either dose there were 17.5% 
compared to 15.1% in those positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively. 
Severe pyrexia (>38.9°C to 40.0°C) was reported in 0.6% participants and 1.0% participants 
in those positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, respectively. The frequency for 
other systemic events after any dose was numerically lower for those positive at baseline: 
fatigue, headache and chills the frequency was 54.2%, 49.7% and 32.8% compared with 
65%, 57.4%, 34.7% for those positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline,

respectively.  Arthralgia was another exception where 27.1% compared to 25.0% were 
reported between those positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. Note that the 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 positive subgroup included far fewer participants the negative 
subgroup, so their results should be interpreted with caution.
Participants 5 to <12 years of age 
Phase 1 and Phase 2/3 participants or their parent/legal guardian were to monitor and record 
reactogenicity for 7 days after each dose; in the 5 to <12 years of age group, events included: 
Local reactions
Pain, redness, swelling at the injection site.
Overall, the pattern of local reactions reported in children 5 to <12 years of age after each 
dose was generally similar to that observed in prior analyses of Phase 2/3 participants ≥12 
years of age in Study C4591001 with regard to pain at the injection site, but children had 
slightly higher frequencies of swelling and redness at the injection site (still within tolerable 
limits).
Systemic events
Fever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhoea, new or worsened muscle pain, new or 
worsened joint pain.
Overall, the pattern of systemic events reported in children 5 to <12 years of age after each 
dose was generally comparable to, or less than, that observed in prior analyses of Phase 2/3 
participants ≥12 years of age in Study C4591001.
Participants 2 to <5 years of age
Local reactions
Pain/tenderness at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction within 7 
days after each dose, with swelling and redness at the injection site reported much less 
frequently.  
Systemic events
Fatigue was the most frequently reported systemic event reported within 7 days after each 
dose, at similar frequencies in the BNT162b2 and placebo groups. 
Participants 6 Months to <2 Years of Age
Local Reactions
Tenderness at the injection site was the most frequently reported local reaction within 7 days 
after each dose, with swelling and redness at the injection site reported much less frequently.

Systemic Events
Irritability was the most frequently reported systemic event reported within 7 days after each 
dose, followed by drowsiness and decreased appetite. 
Overall, reactogenicity to three doses of vaccine was mostly mild to moderate and short-
lived, with most events occurring at similar or lower frequencies after the third dose 
compared with the first or second dose of BNT162b2 3-µg in infants and children 6 months 
to <5 years of age. The median onset of reactogenicity events was typically 1 to 2 days after 
each dose and most events resolved within 1 to 2 days after onset.
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine study C4591001 did not pre-specify AESI however, Pfizer 
utilizes a dynamic list of TME terms to be highlighted in clinical study safety data review. 
TMEs include events of interest due to their association with COVID-19 and terms of interest 
for vaccines in general and may include Preferred Terms, High Level Terms, High Level 
Group Terms or Standardised MedDRA Queries.
For the purpose of the RMP and summary safety reports, an AESI list was defined taking 
into consideration the available lists of AESIs from the following expert groups and 
regulatory authorities: 
Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC)185
 ACCESS protocol186
 US CDC (preliminary list of AESI for VAERS surveillance)187
 MHRA (unpublished guideline).
The AESI list is comprised of medical conditions to allow for changes and customisations of 
MedDRA terms as directed by AE reports and the evolving safety profile of the vaccine. The 
terms searched in the safety database to identify cases of potential AESIs are presented by 
body system (eg. Cardiovascular, Hepatic, Respiratory, etc.) when possible, for ease of 
presentation. Medical concepts that are captured in the AESI list include:

Immune and Autoimmune mediated events that are of interest for all vaccinations.
 Events associated with severe COVID-19.
The AESIs are taken in consideration for all routine and additional pharmacovigilance 
activities.

SVII.1.2. Risks Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns in 
the RMP
Important Identified Risk: Myocarditis and Pericarditis
Risk-benefit impact
Myocarditis and pericarditis are serious conditions that may occur concomitantly and that 
may range in clinical importance from mild to life-threatening.
Missing Information: Use in Pregnancy and while breast feeding
Risk-benefit impact
The safety profile of the vaccine is not fully known in pregnant or breastfeeding women due 
to their initial exclusion from the pivotal clinical study however, post-marketing experience 
in pregnant women is available.188 Additionally 2 clinical studies of the safety and 
immunogenicity of the COVID-19 vaccine in pregnant women are ongoing (C4591009, and 
C459101511); 3 non-interventional studies (C4591011, C4591051 and C4591052) to assess 
whether sub-cohorts of interest, such as pregnant women, experience increased risk of safety 
events of interest following receipt of the COVID-19 vaccines (including modified vaccines)
are planned and another 2 non-interventional studies, C4591021 and C459102212 are 
ongoing.
It is important to obtain long term follow-up on women who were pregnant at or around the 
time of vaccination so that any potential negative consequences to the pregnancy can be 
assessed and weighed against the effects of maternal COVID-19 on the pregnancy.
No data are available yet regarding the use of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 
mcg) and of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 mcg) during pregnancy and breast 
feeding.
Missing Information: Use in immunocompromised patients
Risk-benefit impact
The safety profile of the vaccine is not known in immunocompromised individuals due to 
their exclusion from the pivotal clinical study. The efficacy of the vaccine may be lower in 
immunocompromised individuals, thus decreasing their protection from COVID-19. Two 
non-interventional studies C4591021 and C4591024 (former Safety and immunogenicity in 
high-risk adults)] to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of vaccine 
candidate BNT162b2 in immunocompromised participants ≥2 years of age are ongoing .
11 Study C4591015 is completed with CSR in progress.
12 Please note that studies C4591009, C4591011, C4591021 (former ACCESS/VAC4EU) C4591022, 
C4591051 and C4591052 address only “Use in pregnancy” and not “Breast feeding”.

The efficacy of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 mcg) and of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 mcg) may be lower in immunocompromised individuals.
Two additional observational studies (C4591051 and C4591052) to assess the association 
between COVID-19 bivalent Omicron-modified Vaccine and safety events of interest among 
also immunocompromised patients are planned.
Missing Information: Use in frail patients with co-morbidities (eg. chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular 
disorders)
Risk-benefit impact
There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in frail patients with co-morbidities 
who are potentially at higher risk of severe COVID-19.  
Missing Information: Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders
Risk-benefit impact
There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in individuals with autoimmune or 
inflammatory disorders and a theoretical concern that the vaccine may exacerbate their 
underlying disease.
Missing Information: Interaction with other vaccines
Risk-benefit impact
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine will be used in individuals who also may receive other vaccines. 
Studies to determine if co-administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine with other vaccines 
may affect the efficacy or safety of either vaccine have not been performed. One protocol 
study (C4591030 - Co-administration study with seasonal influenza vaccine) is completed.
Missing Information: Long term safety data
Risk-benefit impact
The long-term safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is unknown at present, however further 
safety data are being collected in ongoing Study C4591001 for up to 2 years following 
administration of dose 2 of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and 2 non-interventional studies are 
ongoing (C4591036 and C4591038).
Two additional planned observational studies (C4591051 and C4591052) will capture safety 
events in individuals of any age who received the COVID-19 bivalent Omicron-modified 
Vaccine since its availability.

SVII.2. New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an Updated 
RMP
In accordance with CHMP positive opinion (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0087) received on 10 
March 2022 and based on the accumulation of post-authorization safety information, 
anaphylaxis has been removed as an IIR in the list of safety concerns because anaphylaxis is 
a known risk of vaccines that is understood by HCPs who administer vaccines and patients 
and does not considerably impact the benefit/risk profile of the vaccine. Product labeling and 
standards of medical care during the vaccination procedure provide adequate risk mitigation.
In accordance with the preliminary PSUR assessment report
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010898/202212) received on 12 May 2023, the important potential 
risk VAED/VAERD is removed from the list of safety concerns of the RMP, as the available 
cumulative data (clinical trial and post-marketing data) showed no safety information that 
substantiates retaining VAED/VAERD as an important potential risk. 
VAED/VAERD will continue to be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance.

Information
SVII.3.1. Presentation of Important Identified Risks and Important Potential Risks
SVII.3.1.1. Important Identified Risk: Myocarditis and Pericarditis
Table 57. Myocarditis and Pericarditisa
Potential mechanisms, evidence source and strength of evidence
A mechanism of action (MOA) by which the vaccine could cause myocarditis and pericarditis has not been 
established.  Nonclinical studies, protein sequence analyses and animal studies in rats and non-human 
primates have not identified a MOA.  Hypotheses for MOA include an immune stimulated response 
(including the possibility of molecular mimicry), a general systemic inflammatory response from vaccination 
or a hypersensitivity response.
Participants 5 to < 12 years of age
The MMWR189 issued on 01 April 2022, estimated the incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after 
infection, MIS and vaccination using EHR data from 40 US health care systems participating in PCORnet, 
the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (7) for the period January 1, 2021–January 31, 
2022. In this study, 27% of persons received mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine and 73% received BNT162b2 
(Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. In the unspecified dose cohort, 36% received Moderna and 64% Pfizer-
BioNTech. In the any dose cohort, 29% received Moderna and 71% Pfizer-BioNTech. Doses specified as 
booster doses were excluded.
Among males aged 5–11 years, the incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis using a 7 and 
21-day window were 0–4 after the first vaccine dose, 0 after the second dose, and 12.6–17.6 cases per 
100,000 after infection. Among females aged 5-11 years, there were no cases of myocarditis or pericarditis 
after vaccination; incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or pericarditis were 5.4–10.8 cases per 100,000 
after infection. Because there were no or few cases of myocarditis or pericarditis after vaccination, the RRs 
for several comparisons could not be calculated or were not statistically significant.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presented data at a VRBPAC meeting on 14 June 
2022 on the number of myocarditis cases within 7 days and 8-21 days of vaccination per million doses from 
spontaneous reports through 26 May 2022 in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)190.  In 
children 5-17 years of age, 54.8 million Pfizer-BioNTech doses were administered (including 3.8 million 
booster [third] doses). In general, the reporting rates were higher 0-7 days after vaccination than after 8-21

days across age groups and sexes. In the 0-7-day risk interval post dose 2, the crude reporting rates were 
highest in ages 16-17 years followed by 12-15 years and lowest for 5-11 years. For persons 5-11 years of age, 
the reporting rates in the 0-7-day risk interval were (per 1 million doses administered): 0.2 post dose 1, 2.6 
post dose 2, and 0 post booster in males; 0.2 post dose 1, 0.7 post dose 2, and 0 post booster in females. The 
reporting rates were slightly elevated post dose 2 in males, compared with the estimated background rates 
(0.2-2.2 per 1-million-person days in the 0–7-day interval). No excess cases were numerically estimated by 
authors in this analysis.
Data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) active surveillance network shared publicly by the CDC on 14 
June 2022 showed the incidence rates of chart confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis treated in emergency 
department or inpatient settings within 0-7 days post mRNA COVID-19 primary series and booster through 
28 May 2022. The occurrence of myocarditis and pericarditis was rare (n=3 post dose 2) based on 
approximately 800,000 doses administered in children 5-11 years of age, and lowest of the other reported age 
groups (12-15 and 16-17 years). The reported incidence rates per million doses administered 0-7 days post 
vaccination had wide reported confidence intervals (males, 15.2 [95% CI 3.1-44.5]; females, 0 [95% CI 0-
15.6]), suggesting instability and low precision.
Hause et al provided an analysis of safety of BNT162b2 vaccination among US children 5-11 years of age 
using 3 vaccine safety monitoring systems: v-safe (a voluntary smartphone-based system that monitors 
reactions and health effects), VAERS (the national spontaneous reporting system co-managed by CDC and 
Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), and VSD (an active surveillance system that monitors electronic 
health records for prespecified events, including myocarditis). 191 The estimated exposure in this age group at 
the date of the report was >16 million vaccine doses. In VAERS, the reporting rate of verified myocarditis 
during days 0–7 after dose 2 was substantially lower among males ages 5–11 years (2.2 per 1 million doses 
administered) than males ages 12–15 years (45.7 per 1 million doses administered). In weekly sequential 
analyses of VSD data, no signal for an increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination was found.
Participants 12 to 15 years of age
As per MMWR189 (01 April 2022), among males aged 12–17 years, the incidences of myocarditis and 
myocarditis or pericarditis were 2.2–3.3 after the first vaccine dose, 22.0–35.9 after the second dose, and 
50.1–64.9 cases per 100,000 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes comparing infected persons with first 
dose recipients were 4.9–69.0, and with second dose recipients, were 1.8–5.6; all RRs were statistically 
significant. Among females aged 12-17 years, incidences of myocarditis or pericarditis were 2.0 after the first 
vaccine dose, 2.1-5.4 after the second vaccine dose, and 24.7-35.7 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes
comparing infected persons with first dose recipients were 25.7-19.8, and with second dose recipients, were 
2.5-2.2; all RRs were statistically significant.
In a prospective nationwide multicenter study from Denmark192 among individuals 12–17 years of age, the 
study revealed an incidence of 97 males and 16 females with myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination 
per million. During the first 12 months of the COVID-19 era, the incidence of MIS-C and elevated troponin 
was 355 and 187 per million male and female adolescents (12-17 years) infected with SARS-CoV-2 (1 in 
2800 males and 1 in 5300 females), significantly higher than the incidence of myopericarditis after COVID-
19 vaccination in both males and females (Fisher’s exact test; P < 0.01). In another Danish population-based 
cohort study193, vaccination with BNT162b2 was associated with a significantly increased rate of myocarditis 
or myopericarditis among women only - in the 12-39 years age group, the absolute rate was 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 -
2.6) per 100 000 female individuals aged 12-39 years within 28 days of vaccination. In the overall 
BNT162b2 cohort, the absolute rate was 1.4 (1.0-1.8) per 100,000 vaccinated individuals within 28 days, and 
among individuals aged 12-17 years, the rate was 1.0 (0.2 to 3.0) per 100 000 individuals within 28 days of 
BNT162b2 vaccination. In this study, clinical outcomes of myocarditis or myopericarditis were 
predominantly mild and generally similar between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, although 
precision in describing clinical outcomes was limited owing to few events.

Table 57. Myocarditis and Pericarditisa
In evaluation of 404,407 adolescents vaccinated with BNT162b2 in Israel, Mevorach et al194 estimated the 
risk of myocarditis among male recipients in the 21 days after the first and second doses of 0.56 cases per 
100,000 after the first dose and 8.09 cases per 100,000 after the second dose; the risk estimates among female 
recipients were 0 cases per 100,000 after the first dose and 0.69 cases per 100,000 after the second dose. The 
risk of myocarditis after receipt of the second vaccine dose among male adolescents 12 to 15 years of age 
was estimated to be 1 case per 12,361; the corresponding risk among female adolescents was estimated to be 
1 case per 144,439. In this study, all the cases were clinically mild, involving a mean duration of 
hospitalization of 3.1 days (range, 1 to 6) and no readmissions during 30 days of follow-up.
Booster Dose (Participants 12 to 15 years of age)
The most recent estimates for myocarditis and pericarditis following booster dose administration and with 
inclusion of paediatric age groups were presented publicly by the US CDC on 7 June 2022 and 14 June 2022 
at VRBPAC meetings and concerned data from VAERS and VSD. 190
The VAERS analyses concerned data as of 26 May 2022 and included an estimated 93.4 million booster 
(third) doses of mRNA vaccines in people 18 years of age or older, and 3.8 million booster (third) doses of 
BNT162b2 in children 12-17 years of age. The reporting rates of myocarditis at 0-7 days were 15.3, 24.1, 
9.9, and 4.8 per million booster doses in males 12-15, 16-17, 18-24, and 25-29 years of age, respectively, 
with rates being lower than those reported post dose 2 in the same age groups and risk period (46.4, 75.9, 
38.9, and 15.2, respectively). The reporting rates of myocarditis 0-7 days post-booster dose did not exceed 
estimated background incidence for the period in males 30 years of age or older, and in females of any age 
presented.
The analysis of US VSD190 reported the incidence rates of chart confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis treated 
in emergency department or inpatient settings within 0-7 days post mRNA COVID-19 primary series and 
booster through 28 May 2022 for paediatric age groups. The exposure (ie, doses administered) in the VSD 
dataset was substantially lower than the overall national exposure utilized for the VAERS estimates above 
(ie, for children 12 17 years of age, there were 249,775 booster doses in VSD compared to 3.8 million 
booster doses in VAERS estimates). The number of verified myocarditis and/or pericarditis events in the 0–
7-day risk interval following boosters in 12-17 years was <10 in males or females, rendering wide reported 
confidence intervals and therefore a degree of uncertainty in the reported incidences; the data will be 
surveilled as it accumulates and is disclosed publicly. 
In a 20 April 2022195 presentation of VDS data through 12 April 2022 of people 12-39 years of age, the 
incidence rates of chart confirmed myocarditis or pericarditis treated in emergency department or inpatient 
settings within 0-7 days post mRNA COVID-19 primary series and booster were compared to 22 to 42 days 
after the corresponding vaccine exposure. Myocarditis rates were approximately halved following the booster 
(third) dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine than those following the primary series (with overlapping 
confidence intervals) for ages 12-39 years: 41.4 per million doses (33.1- 51.1) after BNT162b2 primary 
series vs 21.4 per million dose (12.7- 33.8) after BNT162b2 booster.  
Similarly, in the US publication by Kuehn et al, myocarditis occurrence after booster doses administered to 
adolescents was estimated by analysing VAERS system and v-safe reports received between 09 December 
2021 and 20 February 2022.196  During the study period, roughly 2.8 million US adolescents received a 
BNT162b2 booster dose. The confirmed myocarditis rate after a booster dose was 11.4 per 1 million 
administered doses among adolescent boys 12-17 years of age. By comparison, the myocarditis rate after the 
second dose in the primary vaccine series was 70.7 per 1 million among individuals 12-15 years of age and 
105.9 per 1 million doses among individuals 16-17 years of age.
Participants 16 years of age and older
As per MMWR189 (01 April 2022), among males aged 18-29 years, the incidences of myocarditis and 
myocarditis or pericarditis were 2.7-8.1 after the first vaccine dose, 12.1-15.0 after the second dose, and 85.5-
100.6 cases per 100,000 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes comparing infected persons with first dose 
recipients were 31.8-12.5, and with second dose recipients, were 7.0-6.7; all RRs were statistically

significant. Among males aged 30 years or older, the incidences of myocarditis and myocarditis or 
pericarditis were 3.8-7.3 after the first vaccine dose, 3.1-7.3 after the second dose, and 100.2-114.0 cases per 
100,000 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes comparing infected persons with first dose recipients were 
26.6-15.6, and with second dose recipients, were 32.3-15.6. Among females aged 18-29 years, incidences of 
myocarditis or pericarditis were 2.5-4.6 after the first vaccine dose, 3.1-5.2 after the second vaccine dose, and 
23.8-33.6 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes comparing infected persons with first dose recipients 
were 9.4-7.4, and with second dose recipients, were 7.6-6.4.  Among females aged 30 years or older, 
incidences of myocarditis or pericarditis were 3.1-6.2 after the first vaccine dose, 1.7-4.1 after the second 
vaccine dose, and 53.8-61.7 after infection. RRs for cardiac outcomes comparing infected persons with first 
dose recipients were 17.1-10.0, and with second dose recipients, were 31.2-14.9. The estimates in this study 
are similar to previous reports by CDC.  
An HCO study from Israel197 found a RR for myocarditis after vaccination of 3.24 (95% CI, 1.55 -12.44; RD 
2.7 events per 100,000 persons [95% CI 1.0 to 4.6]) compared with unvaccinated group. The study did not 
provide age and gender specific stratifications, but it reports that in the vaccinated group with myocarditis, 
the median age was 25 years (interquartile range, 20 to 34), and 90.9% were male. The same study found an 
excess risk of myocarditis of 11 events per 100,000 persons after SARS-COV-2 infection. Two further 
studies from Israel reported similar results.  Witberg et al.198 observed a small excess in events 3–5 days 
following the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, but most were mild presentations and just one classified as 
fulminant.  Mevorach et al.194 observed an incidence ratio of 5.34 for myocarditis in 5,442,696 persons 
following BNT162b2, although this was attenuated when restricted to the definite and probable cases of 
myocarditis. Risk of myocarditis was restricted to males under the age of 40 years and only observed 
following the second dose.
In a self-controlled case series study of over 38 million people aged 16 or older vaccinated for COVID-19 in 
England between 1 December 2020 and 24 August 2021199, authors estimated an extra one (95% CI 0, 2) 
myocarditis event per 1 million people vaccinated with BNT162b2 in the 28 days following a first dose and 
with an extra 40 (95% CI 38, 41) myocarditis events per 1 million patients in the 28 days following a SARS-
CoV-2 positive test.  The association with the second dose was not significant for BNT162b2 (IRR 1.3 [95% 
CI 0.98-1.72]).  The risk was higher in participants aged under 40 years, with an estimated 2 (95% CI 1, 3) 
and 3 (95% CI 2, 4) excess cases of myocarditis per 1 million people receiving a first or second dose of 
BNT162b2; and 10 (95% CI 7, 11) extra cases of myocarditis following a SARS-CoV-2 positive test in the 
same age group.
Booster Dose (Participants 16 years of age and older)
Using US VAERS data of adults aged ≥18 years who have met the myocarditis case definition following 
administration of 81.2 million COVID-19 mRNA booster doses in the United States between 22 September 
2021 through 6 February 2022, the US CDC found the rate of myocarditis following BNT162b2 to be highest 
in males aged 18-24 years (4.1 per 1 million booster doses). The rates for other age groups and females were 
low (or null).191
Two studies from Israel report incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis after booster dose. Aviram et al 200
report that 11,905 recipients >18 years who have received a booster dose throughout August 2021, there were 
4 cases of myocarditis: all male and young (21-38 years). 
Three out of 4 patients presented a notable medical history, of which 1 had prior myocarditis episodes (2014-
2015 presumably associated with a viral infection), and one patient had a history of childhood long QT and 
genetic mutation in keratin 16 gene; the clinical course was uneventful in all 4 patients. The second study 
evaluated military personnel in Israel201 vaccinated with a third dose of BNT162b2 until September 30, 2021, 
and diagnosed with myocarditis up to October 14, 2021, found the incidence rates of myocarditis in the week 
and 2 weeks following a third vaccine dose were 3.17 (95% CI, 0.64-6.28) and 5.55 (95% CI, 1.44-9.67) per 
100 000 vaccines given, respectively.  Because all myocarditis cases were in young men (18-24 years old), 
authors estimated the incidence for this specific population to be 6.43 (95% CI, 0.13-12.73) and 11.25 (95% 
CI, 2.92-19.59) per 100,000 vaccines given in the week and 2 weeks after a third vaccine dose, respectively.

Conclusion:  the MAH has updated the labels to include information about myocarditis and pericarditis 
following vaccine administration; a Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) to address these 
findings was distributed.  Surveillance will continue.
Risk factors and risk groups
Post-authorization reports have been received for more males than females, over a wide age range and 
following dose 1 and dose 2 of the vaccine. Evaluation by the EU and US CDC has found reports to be most 
frequent in adolescent and young adult male patients following the second dose of vaccine.
The disease course is self-limiting in a vast majority of cases: 95% of patients show a rapid resolution of 
symptoms and normalization of cardiac biomarkers, electro- and echocardiographic findings within days.202  
Cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest or death were not found significantly associated with the vaccine.197,203
Importantly, the available data suggest that the incidence rate of myocarditis in the context of COVID-19 is 
much greater than the risk of myocarditis following vaccination.  
Preventability
Healthcare professional should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis in vaccine 
recipients.
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the biologic product
The vaccine continues to have a favourable risk benefit balance.
Public health impact
Considering the low rates of myocarditis and pericarditis reported following vaccination, balanced with the 
risk of death and illness (including myocarditis) caused by SARS-CoV-2, the public health impact of post-
vaccination myocarditis and pericarditis is minimal.
a. Search criteria: the following PTs were used to retrieve cases of Myocarditis and Pericarditis: 
Autoimmune myocarditis; Eosinophilic myocarditis; Giant cell myocarditis; Hypersensitivity myocarditis; 
Immune-mediated myocarditis; Myocarditis; Autoimmune pericarditis, Pericarditis; Pericarditis adhesive; 
Pericarditis constrictive; Pleuropericarditis; Immune-mediated pericarditis.
Note: BC criteria is no longer applied; please refer to vaccine specific summary safety reports and periodic 
aggregate reports for further information on the characteristics of the post-marketing cases.

SVII.3.2. Presentation of the Missing Information
Table 58. Use in Pregnancy and while Breast Feeding
Evidence source:
The safety profile of the vaccine is not yet fully known in pregnant or breastfeeding women due to their 
initial exclusion from the pivotal clinical study.  There may be pregnant women who choose to be vaccinated.  
It is important to follow these women for pregnancy and birth outcomes. The timing of vaccination in a 
pregnant woman and the subsequent immune response may have varying favourable or unfavourable impacts 
on the embryo/foetus.  The clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the woman and foetus during 
pregnancy are not yet fully understood but some data have suggested that pregnant women have an increased 
risk of severe disease and complications when affected by COVID-19. This information should be considered 
in the benefit-risk consideration for vaccination in pregnancy.
Population in need of further characterization:
The lack of data is communicated in product labelling; for clinical study of the safety and immunogenicity of 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in pregnant women and while breast feeding, see PART III.2 and PART III.3.
Table 59. Use in Immunocompromised Patients
Evidence source:
The vaccine has not been studied in individuals with overt immunocompromised conditions. Therefore, 
further safety data will be sought in this population.
Population in need of further characterisation:
Safety data will be collected in individuals with compromised immune function due to acquired or genetic 
conditions or conditions requiring the use of immunosuppressants as this population of individuals in the 
active surveillance studies and the clinical studies proposed by the MAH (see PART III.2 and PART III.3).
Table 60. Use in Frail Patients with Co-morbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, 
cardiovascular disorders)
Evidence source:
The vaccine has been studied in individuals with stable chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension, obesity) 
however, it has not been studied in frail individuals with severe co-morbidities that may compromise the 
immune function due to the condition or treatment of the condition.  Therefore, further safety data will be 
sought in this population.
Population in need of further characterisation:
Safety data will be collected in individuals who are frail due to age or debilitating disease in the active 
surveillance studies and through routine pharmacovigilance (see PART III.2 and PART III.3).
Table 61. Use in Patients with Autoimmune or Inflammatory Disorders
Evidence source:
There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory 
disorders.
Population in need of further characterisation:
Safety data will be collected in individuals with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, including 
those who may be on immunosuppressants in the active surveillance studies (see PART III.2 and
PART III.3).

Evidence source:
There are no data on interaction of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine with other vaccines at this time.
Population in need of further characterisation:
All reports describing interactions of COVID-19 vaccine with other vaccines per national recommendations 
in individuals will be collected and analysed as per routine PV activities. Interactions with commonly used 
non-COVID-19 vaccines, such as influenza vaccine, are proposed to be studied in a future clinical study (see
PART III.2 and PART III.3).
Table 63. Long Term Safety Data
Evidence source:
At this time, 6-month post dose 2 safety data are available for all patients who have received COVID-19
mRNA vaccine in Study C4591001. The study is ongoing.
Anticipated risk/consequence of missing information:
At the time of vaccine availability, the long-term safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is not fully known, 
however there are no known risks with a potentially late onset. Data will continue to be collected from 
participants in ongoing study C4591001 for up to 2 years following the 2nd dose of vaccine.  Additionally, 
active surveillance studies are planned to follow long-term safety in vaccine recipients for 2 years following 
Dose 2.

PART III. PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-
AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES)
III.1. Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
Pfizer, on behalf of the MAH, monitors the safety profile of its products, evaluates issues 
potentially impacting product benefit-risk profiles in a timely manner, and ensures that 
appropriate communication of relevant safety information is conveyed in a timely manner to 
regulatory authorities and other interested parties as appropriate and in accordance with 
international principles and prevailing regulations.  Pfizer, on behalf of the MAH, gathers 
data for signal detection and evaluation commensurate with product characteristics.
Routine pharmacovigilance activities for signal detection occur on a regular basis and 
include:
 Receipt and review of individual AE reports (e.g., ADRs);
 Review of aggregated AE reports;
 Use of Data Capture Aids to facilitate the capture of clinical details about various AESIs
including:
o Potential multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adults (MIS-
C/A) experienced by individuals following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech 
COVID-19 Vaccine. The DCA is provided in Annex 4.
 Reference to the AESI list provided in PART II.SVII.1.1 - Risks not considered 
important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP;
 Observed versus expected analyses as appropriate;
 Regulatory authority safety alerts monitoring.
Summary safety reports
The submission of summary safety reports has complemented the submission of 6 monthly 
PSURs since authorisation. The need and frequency of such reports have been re-evaluated 
based on the available evidence from post-marketing experience and since 15 April 2022 
(DLP of the last report) SSRs are no longer required by EMA as per the final PRAC 
Assessment Report for PAM-MEA-002.13 - 3. SBSR/14. SSR (report: 
EMA/PRAC/577594/2022) dated 08 June 2022.
Potential Medication Errors
This section is applicable to all formulations presented in the RMP.
Potential medication errors are mitigated through the information in the SmPC and available
resources and referenced materials for healthcare providers and individuals receiving 
vaccination.

BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4-5 + BNT162b2 XBB.1.5
Risk Management Plan
October 2023
 The EU SmPC (section 6.6) contains instructions for vaccine dilution and 
administration, vaccination dosing, and storage conditions for the formulations of the 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. 
 Dosing card which provides information for vaccine storage, vial differentiation, dose 
planning, and administration is available, for healthcare provider reference.
 Patient Traceability and Vaccination Reminder card (Annex 7) will be provided with 
the pre-printed manufacturer name, placeholder spaces for dates of vaccinations and
batch/lot numbers as a mitigation effort for potential confusion between vaccines. 
(See Traceability for additional details).
These available resources will inform healthcare providers on the proper preparation and 
administration of various formulations of the vaccine and reduce the potential for medication 
error. 
Vial Differentiation
All vials have specific colour flip off plastic cap and label differentiation factors:
Potential medication errors are mitigated through the information in the label (colour of label 
boarder, product name on the label) and available resources and referenced materials for 
healthcare providers. 
For PBS sucrose 30 mcg presentation there are neither further plans to re-manufacture nor 
remaining inventory for sale. The elimination of this presentation may assist with mitigation 
of medication errors by having fewer available formulations; the formulation is removed 
from the RMP section.
Various resources and referenced resources to inform HCPs on the proper preparation and 
differentiation will be available.

Multi dose: If an attempt is made to dilute the 30 mcg/dose dispersion for injection vial, the user would immediately feel resistance to 
the addition of any further volume, because the vial fill volume is 2.25 mL and there is little remaining physical space to add diluent to 
the vial.  
Single dose: The filled volume for this light grey cap vial is only 0.48 mL because it contains 1 dose for extraction. If diluted with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution by mistake, more than 1 dose of over diluted vaccine may be erroneously extracted.

If the contents of the vial are not diluted with the required 1.3 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution, the user would only be able 
to extract approximately 5 doses instead of 10 doses because the vial fill volume is 1.3 mL. If excess diluent such as 2.2 mL which is the 
dilution volume for the 3 mcg/dose diluted product (maroon cap amount), is used to dilute the 10 mcg/dose vial, it would be difficult to 
add the entire volume of diluent into the vial, and the preparer will likely feel resistance.
Multi dose: If an attempt is made to dilute the 10 mcg/dose dispersion for injection vial (dark blue cap), the user would immediately feel 
resistance to the addition of any further volume, because the filled volume is 2.25 mL and therefore, there is little remaining physical 
space to add additional diluent to the vial.
Single dose: The filled volume for the light blue cap presentation is 0.48 mL because it contains 1 dose for extraction.  If diluted with 
sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution by mistake, the user would be able to extract multiple doses and the product would be over
diluted and not achieve the appropriate dose level if administered.

If the contents of the vial are not diluted with 2.2 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution, the user would only be able to

amount) or 1.3 mL of diluent (orange cap amount) were used, this would be an under dilution and would also reduce the number 
of doses able to be extracted from the vial, which might indicate to the HCP that there had been an error in preparation.

Traceability
The SmPC, includes instructions for healthcare professionals: 


to clearly record the name and batch number of the administered vaccine to improve 
traceability (section 4.4).
to report any suspected adverse reactions including batch/Lot number if available 
(section 4.8).
Traceability is available for every shipping container of COVID mRNA vaccine, which are 
outfitted with a unique device that provides real-time monitoring of geographic location and 
temperature 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Each device will also trace the batch/lot of 
the associated shipment.  The device is activated prior to shipment and information is 
transmitted wirelessly to Pfizer at a predefined cadence, on behalf of the MAH, until delivery 
to the vaccinator’s practice site.  A shipment quality report that indicates if the product is 
acceptable for immediate use is generated by Pfizer on behalf of the MAH and transmitted to 
the vaccinator’s practice site upon pressing of the stop button on the data logger, or arrival 
notification from the carrier in combination with the data loggers location and/or light signal.  
Additionally, alarms and escalation/notification for excursions (per pre-defined 
specifications) are programmed into the device.  These data may be used for the assessment 
of a safety signal.
The vaccine carton labelling also contains a 2-D barcode which has the batch/lot and expiry 
embedded within, should there be capability at a vaccination site to utilize this as an 
information source. 
Further, Pfizer on behalf of the MAH, provides Traceability and Vaccination Reminder cards 
(Annex 7) to vaccinators that may be completed at the time of vaccination.  The Traceability 
and Vaccination Reminder cards contain the following elements:
 Placeholder space for name of vaccinee;
 Vaccine brand name and manufacturer name;
 Placeholder space for due date and actual date of first and second doses, and 
associated batch/lot number;
 Reminder to retain the card and bring to the appointment for the second dose of the 
vaccine; 
 QR code that links to additional information; and
 Adverse event reporting information.
In addition, to the Traceability and Vaccination Reminder cards, two stickers per dose, 
containing printed batch/lot information and a coloured border corresponding to the 
Page 138
BNT162b2 + BNT162b2 BA.1 + BNT162b2 BA.4-5 + BNT162b2 XBB.1.5
Risk Management Plan
October 2023
associated vials for the dose, were made available to support documentation of the batch/lot 
on the Traceability and Vaccination Reminder card and vaccinee medical records in mass 
vaccination centers.  We also acknowledge that some EU member states may require 
utilisation of nationally mandated vaccination cards or electronic systems to document 
batch/lot number; therefore, the available Traceability and Vaccination Reminder cards and 
stickers with printed lot/batch information may not be utilized in all member states.  
The following milestones are proposed for the availability of the stickers with printed 
lot/batch information:


Initial vaccine availability: Sufficient quantities of blank “Traceability and 
Vaccination Reminder cards” were made available to vaccinators in the member 
states where utilisation of a nationally mandated vaccination card is not required.
29 January 2021: In addition to the blank “Traceability and Vaccination Reminder 
cards”, stickers with printed lot/batch information were made available to vaccinators 
at large scale (1000 subjects/day), mass vaccination sites in the member states where 
the national authority has not mandated another mechanism for documenting the 
lot/batch information. 
 Projected 2025: pre-printed batch/lot stickers will be available to co-ship with each 
vaccine shipment.
Cold-Chain Handling and Storage
Multiple modalities will be utilised for quality assurance throughout shipment due to the 
required ultra-cold storage for COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. 
 Each shipment of the vaccine is outfitted with a unique device that provides real-time 
monitoring of geographic location and temperature 24 hours per day, 7 days per week 
until delivery to a vaccinator’s practice site. Alarms and escalation/notification to 
Pfizer on behalf of the MAH and/or to the recipient for excursions (per pre-defined 
specifications) are programmed into the device. Additionally, a shipment quality 
report that indicates if the product is acceptable for immediate use is generated by 
Pfizer and transmitted to the vaccinator’s practice site.

Joint adverse event and product complaint (including available batch/lot information) 
trending reviews occur routinely with Global Product Quality.
 Additionally, available resources and referenced materials for vaccinators will include 
information regarding proper handling of the shipment container as temporary 
storage, and handling/disposal of dry ice until the received shipment is either placed 
into an ultra-low temperature freezer or is maintained in accord with pre-defined 
specifications in the shipment container as temporary storage (i.e., upon receipt of the 
shipment quality report noted above), as appropriate.

III.2. Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities
The MAH proposes the following 18 studies, of which 4 global, 4 in Europe only, 7 in US 
only, 2 in US and Canada and 1 in New Zealand/Australia. There are 7 interventional studies 
(C4591007, C4591015, C4591024, C4591031, C4591044, C4591048 and 1 study for vaccine 
interactions), 2 Low-Interventional studies (C4591036 and WI255886) and 9 non-
interventional studies (8 safety and 1 effectiveness), summarised in the table below and 
further detailed in Table 68 and Table 69.

Purpose
a. Based on the outcome of procedures PAM-MEA-015.2 and PAM-MEA-016, and in particular based on 
the conclusions of the Assessment Report for the Post-Authorisation Measure MEA/015.2 and MEA/016 
(EMA/CHMP/498689/2021) issued on 16 September 2021, the design of study C4591024 was agreed to 
satisfactorily cover the objectives initially planned for study C4591018, that is therefore removed from the list 
of studies
b. Vaccine effectiveness is not a safety concern.
c. The study does not involve any administration of vaccine or other Pfizer products but since a specimen 
collection procedure is required per protocol, this qualifies this study as ‘low-interventional’.
d. United Kingdom.

Non-Interventional Post Approval Safety Studies (9)
The MAH proposes 9 complementary studies of real-world safety of COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine that use multiple data sources and study designs. These are described in Table 68
below which includes the proposed post-approval safety studies that will be conducted in the 
EU and US.
 Study C4591021 is a Comirnaty safety surveillance study conducted in 
collaboration with University Medical Center Utrecht on behalf of Vaccine 
Monitoring Collaboration for Europe Consortium research team VAC4EU and 
based on the master surveillance protocol. 
 Additionally, C4591038 (formerly known as the C4591021 substudy) is also a 
collaboration with University Medical Center Utrecht on behalf of VAC4EU 
Consortium research team and is designed as a substudy of C4591021 to assess 
the natural history of post-vaccination myo-/pericarditis, e.g., recovery status 
(using medical record review) and/or identification of serious cardiovascular 
outcomes (using existing structured data) within 1 year of myo-/pericarditis 
diagnosis among occurring in individuals vaccinated with COMIRNATY as well 
as individuals not vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine.
 Study C4591051 is a Comirnaty Original /Omicron BA.4-5 safety surveillance 
study to be conducted using secondary data from administrative claims and 
electronic health records from data research partners participating in the US 
Sentinel System.

October 2023
 Study C4501052 is a Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 and Comirnaty Original 
/Omicron BA.4-5 safety surveillance study conducted in collaboration with 
University Medical Center Utrecht on behalf of Vaccine Monitoring 
Collaboration for Europe Consortium research team VAC4EU and based on the 
master surveillance protocol.
In addition to the studies in the EU, in support of the US BLA and sBLA applications, Pfizer 
will conduct 4 US studies and 1 US/CA for safety surveillance of COVID 19 mRNA.  These 
studies include:





1 study using secondary data from administrative claims/electronic medical 
records for military and civilian personnel and their families in the Department of 
Defense Military Health System (C4591011).
1 study using secondary data from EHR of patients included in the Veterans 
Healthcare Administration system (C4591012).
1 study using secondary data from administrative claims and electronic health 
records from data research partners participating in the US Sentinel System 
(C4591009).
1 low-interventional study using primary data from the Pediatric Heart Network 
(PHN), a NIH-funded consortium of leading research hospitals across the US, 
Canada, and other countries that conducts research in cardiovascular disease, to 
characterize the clinical course, risk factors, long-term sequelae, and quality of 
life in children and young adults <21 years with acute post-vaccine myocarditis 
over a 5-year period (C4591036).
1 study will monitor rates of pregnancy and infant outcomes in planned and 
unplanned pregnancies exposed to BNT162b2 using an established pregnancy 
registry. Women receiving BNT162b2 during pregnancy will be followed from 
exposure to one-year post-partum. Analyses will be conducted to evaluate if the 
pregnant women receiving the vaccine during pregnancy experience increased 
risk of pregnancy and infant outcomes compared with pregnant women who are 
unvaccinated (C4591022).
The protocols for the safety studies in the US (C4591009, C4591011, C4591012 and 
C4591022) were added in Annex 3 Part C.
Non-Interventional Post-Approval Safety Studies Assessing Myocarditis/Pericarditis 
Studies C4591021(EU), C4591011 (US), C4591012 (US), C4591009 (US), C4501051 (US)
and C4501052 (EU) will describe the incidence of myocarditis/pericarditis following 
Comirnaty vaccination overall, and stratified by age group, gender, race/ethnicity (if 
feasible), dose, and risk interval using structured information and following case 
confirmation via medical record review where feasible. To assess the magnitude of risk,

Risk Management Plan
October 2023
these studies include comparative methods (self-controlled analyses, and analyses involving 
a separate comparator group).  
Relative risk (RR) estimates from comparative analyses will be obtained overall and 
stratified by the same factors as described above when supported by sufficient cell counts.
To evaluate long-term outcomes, myocarditis/pericarditis-specific analytic endpoints in 
currently planned or ongoing studies C4591009, C4591011, C4591012, C4591021 and 
C4591038 (former C4591021 substudy) will assess the natural history of post-vaccination 
myo-/pericarditis, e.g., recovery status (medical record review) and/or identification of 
serious cardiovascular outcomes (structured data) within 1 year of myo-/pericarditis 
diagnosis among individuals vaccinated with COMIRNATY as well as individuals not 
vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine. 
Study C4591021 will also estimate the time trend, in relation to DHPC letter dissemination, 
of the proportion of individuals who received real-world clinical assessments for 
myocarditis/pericarditis following Comirnaty vaccination.
A long-term primary data collection low-interventional study is C4591036 (former Pediatric 
Heart Network (PHN), to evaluate the clinical course, risk factors, long-term sequelae, and 
quality of life of post-vaccine myocarditis/pericarditis over a 5-year period.    
In addition, protocols of studies C4591012 and C4591036 have been amended to include 
evaluation of individuals receiving additional approved doses, including the bivalent 
Omicron-modified vaccine. Additionally, the MAH has determined to not update the study 
C4591021, as accepted by the FDA and committed instead to conduct a standalone post-
authorization observational safety study (C4591052) to evaluate the bivalent omicron-
modified vaccine.

C4591011 (US) and C4591036 (US and Canada) will assess the use of vaccine for the 
occurrence of safety events of interest, including myocarditis and pericarditis. Each of these 
studies includes individuals of all ages, including ages 5 to <12, except for low-interventional 
study C4591036, which only includes individuals <21 years of age.
Non-Interventional Post-Approval Safety Studies in Pregnancy
It is anticipated that initial use in pregnancy will be subject to local health authority 
recommendations regarding which individuals should be vaccinated and likely very limited 
intentional vaccination of pregnant women; therefore, initially this information will derive 
from  6 of the real-world safety studies (C4591009, C4591011, C4591021 [former 
ACCESS/VAC4EU] C4591022, C4591051 and C4591052), described in Table 68. Study 
C4591012 is focused on patients in the Veterans Health Administration system and is not 
expected to capture many pregnancies given the demographics of the source population.

Risk Management Plan
October 2023
The findings from studies’ interim analysis (where planned) will inform a strategy to assess 
pregnancy outcomes as vaccination in pregnancy expands.  The MAH will consider 
established EU pregnancy research recommendations such as CONSIGN (COVID-19 
infectiOn aNd medicineS In preGNancy) when developing any pregnancy related study 
objectives (currently not listed in Table 68 and Table 69).
The MAH agrees that monitoring vaccine safety in pregnant women is critical. Given that a 
pregnancy registry based on primary data collection is susceptible to non-participation, 
attrition, small sample size and limited or lack of comparator data, Pfizer, on behalf of the 
MAH, would like to propose monitoring vaccine safety in pregnancy using electronic health 
care data, which could be conducted in a representative pregnant woman population exposed 
to the vaccine and minimize selection bias, follow-up bias, and reporting bias.  In addition, 
internal comparison groups, such as contemporaneous unvaccinated pregnant women or 
women receiving other vaccine(s) to prevent COVID-19 (if available) could be included.
Post-Approval Effectiveness Studies (2)
Pfizer will conduct, on behalf of the MAA, at least one non-interventional study (test 
negative design) of individuals presenting to the hospital or emergency room with symptoms 
of potential COVID-19 illness in a real-world setting (C4591014).  The effectiveness of 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine will be estimated against laboratory confirmed COVID-19 illness 
requiring admission to the ED or hospital where SARS-CoV-2 is identified. This study will 
allow determination of the effectiveness of Pfizer’s vaccine in a real-world setting and
against severe disease, and in specific racial, ethnic, and age groups.  
The purpose of the original study C4591014 (a test-negative design) was further developed 
with 2 new vaccine effectiveness epidemiology studies not sponsored by Pfizer (WI23528413
and WI255886) added. The harmonisation of study definitions across these  protocols will 
allow for data and results comparison across study populations to provide a robust evidence 
base for evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine following its introduction 
into the real-world setting. The two studies, C4591014 and WI255886, will also assess the 
effectiveness of bivalent Omicron-modified vaccines following their introduction.
13 Study WI235284 was completed, and final CSR was submitted on 30 June 2023 (Procedure 
NEMEA/H/C/005735/II/0186/G). This study is removed from PART III.2

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MINIMISATION ACTIVITIES)
RISK MINIMISATION PLAN
The safety information in the proposed product information is aligned to the reference 
medicinal product.
V.1. Routine Risk Minimisation Measures
The product information is sufficient to mitigate the current identified and potential risks of 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.  The necessary information to ensure appropriate use of the 
product is included in the relevant sections of the SmPC. No additional measures for risk 
minimisation are considered necessary by the MAH at this time.  The proposed minimisation 
measures are summarised in the table below for each safety concern.

of Myocarditis and Pericarditis
Direct Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC)
Objectives
Rationale for the 
additional risk 
minimisation activity:
Target audience and 
planned distribution 
path:
Plans to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the 
interventions and criteria 
for success:
To ensure that healthcare providers (HCPs) are aware of the potential for 
myocarditis and pericarditis associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine use.
The DHCP communication is to inform HCPs about the identified risk of 
myocarditis and pericarditis associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, to 
remind them to be alerted about the signs and symptoms and to counsel patients 
to seek immediate medical attention should they experience chest pain, shortness 
of breath, or palpitations.
The target audience includes general practitioners, cardiologists, specialists in 
emergency medicine and vaccination centres, HCPs who vaccinate patients and 
who provide medical care to patients who receive the vaccine.  Target groups 
should be further defined at national level, depending on national health care 
systems.
Estimating the time trend, in relation to DHPC letter dissemination, of the 
proportion of individuals who received real-world clinical assessments for 
myocarditis/pericarditis following Comirnaty vaccination.  
The DHPC distribution started on 19 July 2021 in all EEA countries as per the 
EMA’s communication plan.

medicine’s webpage www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/comirnaty.
II. Risks Associated With the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks
Important risks of Comirnaty, of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms) of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 together with 
measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learning more about 
Comirnaty's, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms) Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Comirnaty, of Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms) and of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 
and Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ 
below.
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Comirnaty, of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms) of 
Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5 are risks that need 
special risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the 
medicinal product can be safely administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified 
or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the 
use of Comirnaty, of Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 (15/15 micrograms), Comirnaty 
Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and Comirnaty Omicron XBB.1.5.  Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but 
this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Purpose of the study
To assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the BNT162b2 
RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate against COVID-19 in healthy paediatric 
subjects.  
To assess the occurrence of safety events of interest, including myocarditis and 
pericarditis, in the general US population (all ages), pregnant women, the 
immunocompromised and persons with a prior history of COVID-19 within 
selected data sources participating in the US Sentinel System.
To assess whether individuals (all ages) in the US DoD MHS experience increased 
risk of safety events of interest, following receipt of the COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine.
To assess whether individuals in the US Veteran’s Affairs Health System 
experience increased risk of safety events of interest, following receipt of the 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccine including the bivalent Omicron modified vaccine.
To assess safety and immunogenicity in pregnant women 
In addition, exploratory objectives include:
(a) To describe the immune response in infants born to breastfeeding maternal 
participants vaccinated with prophylactic COVID-19 mRNA vaccine during 
pregnancy.
(b) To describe the safety of maternal immunisation in infants born to breastfeeding 
maternal participants vaccinated with prophylactic COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
during pregnancy.
To estimate the effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine against hospitalisation 
and emergency department admission for acute respiratory illness due to SARS-
CoV-2 infection and to assess the effectiveness of bivalent Omicron-modified 
vaccines following their introduction in all authorized age groups.

Purpose of the study
To estimate the effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine against hospitalisation 
for acute respiratory illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to assess the 
effectiveness of bivalent Omicron-modified vaccines following their introduction
in individuals 18 years of age and older.
Safety, tolerability and immunogenicity based on representative medical conditions 
(≥18 years: NSCLC, CLL, in hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease).
Assessment of potential increased risk of adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
among individuals (all ages) after being vaccinated with COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine, including individuals less than 12 years of age.
Estimating the time trend, in relation to DHPC letter dissemination, of the 
proportion of individuals who received real-world clinical assessments for 
myocarditis/pericarditis following Comirnaty vaccination.  
To describe clinical course (treatment, survival, hospitalisations, long-term cardiac 
outcomes) of myocarditis and pericarditis among individuals diagnosed with 
myocarditis and/or pericarditis after receiving at least 1 dose of the Pfizer-
BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and among individuals diagnosed with myocarditis 
and/or pericarditis who had no prior COVID-19 vaccination, using a cohort. study.
To assess whether pregnant women receiving BNT162b2 experience increased risk 
of pregnancy and infant safety outcomes, including major congenital 
malformations, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, preterm delivery, small for 
gestational age, and small for age postnatal growth to one year of age relative to 
pregnant women who received no COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy.
To characterize the clinical course, risk factors, long-term sequelae, and quality of 
life in children and young adults <21 years with acute post-vaccine myocarditis
including myocarditis after the bivalent Omicron modified vaccine.
Safety and immunogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and quadrivalent 
seasonal influenza vaccine when administered separately or concomitantly.
To describe the safety and tolerability profile of BNT162b2 (30 μg or 60 μg),
BNT162b2 OMI (30 μg or 60 μg), and bivalent BNT162b2 and BNT162b2 OMI 
(30 μg or 60 μg) given as a fourth dose to BNT162b2 experienced participants >55 
years of age and experienced participants 18-to 55 years of age
To describe the safety/tolerability and immune response to BNT162b5 Bivalent and 
BNT162b2 Bivalents given as a 2nd booster dose to COVID-19-vaccine-
experienced participants ≥12 years of age.
To investigate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of bivalent BNT162b2 
RNA-based vaccine candidate(s) in healthy children.
To ensure comprehensive understanding of real-world safety of the Pfizer-
BioNTech COVID-19 bivalent Omicron-modified vaccine in large samples of 
general US populations.
To ensure comprehensive understanding of real-world safety of the Pfizer-
BioNTech COVID-19 bivalent Omicron-modified vaccine in large samples of

ANNEX 6. DETAILS OF PROPOSED ADDITIONAL RISK MINIMISATION 
ACTIVITIES (IF APPLICABLE)
The additional risk minimisation measure to address myocarditis and pericarditis is a Direct 
Healthcare professional communication, as below:
COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Comirnaty and Spikevax: risk of myocarditis and 
pericarditis 
Dear Healthcare professional,
BIONTECH/PFIZER and MODERNA BIOTECH SPAIN, S.L. in agreement with the 
European Medicines Agency and <National competent authority> would like to inform you 
of the following:
Summary 
 Cases of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported very rarely following
vaccination with the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Comirnaty and Spikevax.
 The cases primarily occurred within 14 days after vaccination, more often after the
second dose and in younger men.
 Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following
vaccination is similar to the course of myocarditis and pericarditis in general.
 Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and
pericarditis.
 Healthcare professionals should advise vaccinated individuals to seek immediate medical
attention should they experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations.
Background on the safety concern
The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, Comirnaty and Spikevax, have been approved in the EU 
under conditional marketing authorisation for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 
infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, in individuals 12 years of age and older (Comirnaty) and 
18 years of age and older (Spikevax), respectively.
Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in association with the COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccines.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
(PRAC) has evaluated all available data and concluded that a causal association between 
COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and myocarditis and pericarditis is at least a reasonable 
possibility. Accordingly, the Summary of Product Characteristics, sections 4.4 (‘Special 
warnings and precautions for use’) and 4.8 (‘Undesirable effects’) have been updated.

Risk Management Plan
Part VII: Annex 6
The benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh any risks. 
Up to 31 May 2021 in the EEA, 145 cases of myocarditis occurred among people who 
received Comirnaty and 19 cases among people who received Spikevax. In addition, 138 
cases of pericarditis occurred following the use of Comirnaty and 19 cases following the use 
of Spikevax. 
It is estimated that around 177 million doses of Comirnaty and 20 million doses of Spikevax 
have been administered in the EEA up to 31 May 2021.
Call for reporting
Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via their 
national reporting system and include batch/Lot number if available.
These medicinal products are subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick 
identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any 
suspected adverse reactions.

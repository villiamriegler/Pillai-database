Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for ibrutinib, the scientific conclusions 
of CHMP are as follows:  
Following a cumulative review, 17 cases of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) have 
been identified and assessed. Although some cases are confounded by previous or concomitant therapy 
with other drugs listing PML in the Summary of product characteristic (SmPC), the role of ibrutinib, also 
in light of its biological plausibility as an immunosuppressant, cannot be excluded.  
Since PML is a very serious clinical event which benefits from early diagnosis and intervention, health 
care professionals using ibrutinib would benefit from a warning with regards to the possibility of events 
of PML when using ibrutinib in the context of a prior or concomitant immunosuppressive therapy.  
Therefore, an update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to reflect the potential for this risk is recommended. 
The MAH should update the Risk Management Plan to included PML as an important potential risk and 
provide appropriate risk minimisation measures via the next type II variation affecting the RMP or with 
the next PSUR whichever occurs earlier. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ibrutinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing ibrutinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to 
the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation should be varied.

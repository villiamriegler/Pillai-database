2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Oprymea is indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's 
disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with levodopa, i.e. over the course of the 
disease, through to late stages when the effect of levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent 
and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur (end of dose or “on off” fluctuations). 
Pramipexole is a synthetic amino-benzothiazole derivative (ATC Code: N04B C05). It has been 
shown to be a selective and specific full dopamine receptor agonist with high affinity and 
selectivity for the D2 receptor subfamily, and particularly the D3 receptor subtype. It is used 
in the management of Parkinson’s disease, alone or as an adjunct to levodopa therapy in more 
advanced stages of the disease.  
Oprymea 0.088 mg, 0.18 mg, 0.35 mg, 0.7 mg and 1.1 mg tablets was authorised as a 
generic medicinal product containing pramipexole (as dihydrochloride monohydrate) as active 
substance. The reference product Sifrol 0.088 mg, 0.18 mg, 0.35 mg, 0.7 mg and 1.1 mg 
tablets was centrally authorised on 14 October 1997.  
The applicant applied for an extension of marketing authorisation in order to add to prolonged-
release tablets in the following strengths: 0.26 mg, 0.52 mg, 1.05 mg, 1.57 mg and 2.1 mg. 
In addition, the applicant took the opportunity to introduce some minor editorial and 
typographic changes in Module 3.S. 
Prolonged-release tablets are beneficial to patients with Parkinson’s disease as they can be 
administered once daily, thereby increasing patient convenience and compliance. In addition, 
administration of prolonged release tablets results in a pharmacokinetic profile with less 
pronounced maximum plasma levels and more stable plasma levels over time. 
To support the application, the MAH submitted data from dissolution and bioequivalence 
studies.  In the bioequivalence studies, Krka’s pramipexole prolonged release tablets were 
compared to Sifrol prolonged release tablets.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The medicinal product is presented as prolonged-release tablets containing 0.26 mg, 0.52 mg, 
1.05 mg, 1.57 mg and 2.1 mg of the active substance pramipexole (as dihydrochloride 
monohydrate). 
Other ingredients are: hypromellose, maize starch, silica, colloidal anhydrous and magnesium 
stearate.   The prolonged-release tablets are packed in OPA/Alu/DES/PE-Alu blisters as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/703661/2013 
Page 7/27 
 
 
  
  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The active substance used in the prolonged-release tablets (0.26 mg, 0.52 mg, 1.05 mg, 1.57 
mg and 2.1 mg), pramipexole, is the same active substance as the one approved for the 
currently authorised Oprymea tablets (0.088 mg, 0.18 mg, 0.35 mg, 0.7 mg and 1.1 mg). 
Nevertheless, the applicant resubmitted the Module 3.S since some minor editorial and 
typographic changes.were introduced. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a product essentially bioequivalent 
to the reference product, Sifrol prolonged-release tablets. In this context, the applicant 
developed a pharmaceutical formulation that is very similar to the reference product.The 
pharmaceutical development took into consideration that the active substance is BCS class 1. 
During development a range of release-rate controlling excipients were investigated and also 
different manufacturing processes such as wet granulation and direct compression were 
studied. Several pharmaceutical compositions of pramipexole were investigated during 
finished product development. It was noted that the active substance is slowly released by 
diffusion and erosion from the single unit matrix in the reference product and the Krka 
medicinal product. 
In order to insure comparable performance between Oprymea prolonged-release tablets and 
the reference product, the MAH performed two in vivo pilot bioequivalence studies. These pilot 
studies were conducted under fasting and fed conditions with two different formulations. 
According to the results the proposed formulations were found to be bioequivalent to the 
reference product. Based on these results, one of the formulations was chosen for further 
development. 
All strengths of the proposed Krka pramipexole prolonged-release tablet formulation were 
tested in vivo in order to prove the bioequivalence (BE) with the reference medicinal product 
under single dose fasting and fed (high fat) and steady state conditions. The compositions of 
the batches used for BE studies are identical to the product final formulation. Based on the 
results of pilot bioequivalence studies the most suitable dissolution method was developed. 
This method was further used as a supportive tool for the product development. 
The effect of particle size of the active substance was also evaluated. Formulations with the 
same composition and active substance with different particle size were tested.  The effect of 
hardness and compression speed on the properties of tablets was studied during the 
pharmaceutical development. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and 
their quality is compliant with Ph Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the 
finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/703661/2013 
Page 8/27 
 
 
  
  
The finished product is packed in blister packs consisting of OPA/Alu/DES/PE-Alu blisters. The 
material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The proposed commercial manufacturing process involves standard technology using standard 
manufacturing processes such as mixing, blending, compressing, packaging. Furthermore, the 
equipment used is commonly available in the pharmaceutical industry. A detailed 
manufacturing description and flow scheme have been provided. The process is considered to 
be a standard manufacturing process, but considering the finished product is a specialised 
pharmaceutical form (low dose, prolonged-release tablets), process validation data to cover 
the proposed batch size is provided. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this pharmaceutical form. 
Results on process validation for pilot scale batches and production scale batches, covering the 
proposed batch size range, have been provided. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visually), uniformity of dosage (Ph Eur), identification (HPLC and UV), 
impurities (HPLC), dissolution (Ph Eur), assay (95% - 105%, HPLC) microbiological quality (Ph 
Eur). The finished product specifications are standard for prolonged-release tablets. All tests 
included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. Appropriate data 
have been presented to justify the specifications. Impurities and degradation products have 
been evaluated and found to be acceptable from the point of view of safety. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot batches of each strength and first production 
scale batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three pilot scale batches of all strengths of finished product stored under long 
term conditions for twelve months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to six  months under 
accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/703661/2013 
Page 9/27 
 
  
  
batches of medicinal product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were 
packaged as proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, assay, impurities, dissolution and microbiological quality. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. One pilot batch of each strength has 
been investigated regarding photostability as defined in the ICH Guideline on photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No major changes were observed and 
reported. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Data on development, manufacture and control of this pharmaceutical form has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The new pharmaceutical form was developed since it is 
beneficial to patients with Parkinson’s disease as they can be administered once daily, thereby 
increasing patient convenience and compliance. The applicant developed a pharmaceutical 
formulation that is very similar to the reference product.All strengths of the proposed Krka 
pramipexole prolonged-release tablet formulation are bioequivalent to the reference medicinal 
product. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the medicinal 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
Based on the data provided, the quality of this medicinal product is considered to be 
acceptable. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been 
provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview 
justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with 
the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/703661/2013 
Page 10/27 
 
  
  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as 
the introduction of Oprymea manufactured by Krka d.d. Novo mesto is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all parmipexole containing 
products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is 
expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for prolonged release tablets containing pramipexole. To support the 
marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted five bioequivalence studies with 
cross-over design under both fasting and fed conditions.  
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment, the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1 in its current version is of particular relevance. 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
Exemption  
In line with the Note for guidance on modified release oral and transdermal dosage forms: 
section II (pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation), CPMP/EWP/280/96, prolonged release 
formulations can be assessed as bioequivalent on the basis of single and multiple dose studies 
which are designed to demonstrate, amongst other, that performance of the test and the 
reference formulation is equivalent after single dose and at steady state. In line with the Note 
as well as the biowaiver criteria laid down in the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1), the MAH applied to waive the need for 
conducting additional bioequivalence studies including multiple dose studies involving all 
strengths at steady state.  
All strengths of the pramipexole prolonged-release tablet formulation are manufactured by the 
same manufacturing process, the qualitative composition of the different strengths is the 
same, the amount of the active substance is less than 5 % of the tablet core weight, and the 
amount of a filler is changed to account for the change in amount of active 
Assessment report  
EMA/703661/2013 
Page 11/27 
 
  
  
The MAH furthermore confirmed to have conducted appropriate in vitro dissolution studies 
confirming the adequacy of waiving additional in vivo bioequivalence testing. Upon request of 
the CHMP, the MAH submitted comparative between strength in vitro dissolution data in three 
relevant dissolution media using paddle apparatus and dissolution rotation speed.  
Calculation of the f2 factor in accordance with criteria of the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence demonstrates similarity of profiles between all strengths of the pramipexole 
prolonged-release tablets formulation. The MAH concluded that the pharmacokinetics of 
pramipexole in the prolonged release formulations were linear and all the stipulated conditions 
of the dose proportionality rule were fulfilled as well as similar dissolution profiles between all 
strengths were demonstrated. 
The CHMP considered the justification to be acceptable and agreed with the MAH’s conclusions. 
Clinical studies 
To support this application, the MAH submitted the results of 5 bioequivalence studies with the 
test pramipexole prolonged release tablets formulation in comparison to Sifrol prolonged 
release tablets (see table 1 for an overview of the studies conducted)

Methods 
Study design  
Three of the bioequivalence studies were standard single dose fasting studies. One study was 
conducted under fed conditions and one study, where the highest strengths (1.57 mg and 2.1 
mg) were used, was conducted as a multiple dose study first assessing the 1.57 mg dosage 
strength and subsequently the 2.1 mg strength.  
The studies were conducted as open label, two periods, two sequences, crossover, controlled, 
randomised trials. 
Specific design aspects by study type (single dose fasting, single dose fed and multiple dose 
fasting) are summarized below: 
•  Single dose studies under fasting conditions

After at least 10 hours of fasting, each subject received one dose of pramipexole prolonged-
release tablets, administered with 240 ml of water. 
Sampling schedule:  
Blood samples for the analyses of pramipexole were collected before administration and at 
several points in time up to 48 hours post administration of a single-dose tablet with 240 ml of 
water. 
•  Single dose study under fed conditions 
Drug intake procedures:  
On the treatment days, after at least 10 hours of fasting and 30 minutes after the start of 
serving of a standardized high-fat high-calories breakfast (900 kcal, 16% from protein, 27% 
from carbohydrates and 57% from fat), each subject received one dose of pramipexole 
0.52 mg prolonged-release tablet, administered with 240 ml of water. 
Sampling schedule:  
Blood samples were collected pre-dosing and at administration and at several points in time 
up to 48 hours post administration of a single-dose of 0.52 mg prolonged release tablet with 
240 ml of water. 
•  Multiple dose study under fasting conditions 
Drug intake procedures: 
Study subject entered firstly an up-titration period of 9 days, immediately followed by a 
multiple dose cross-over study (cross-over 1) evaluating the bioequivalence of test product A 
and reference formulation B (1.57 mg of Pramipexol prolonged release tablets). Cross-over 
study 1 were immediately followed by the second cross-over study (cross-over 2) evaluating 
the bioequivalence of test formulation C and reference formulation D (2.1 mg of Pramipexol 
prolonged release tablets), ending with a down titration of 4 days. 
After uptitration period subjects received an oral dose of the assigned formulations with 240 
mL. 
There was no washout between periods. The first dose in each period was administered under 
fed conditions and all other doses under fasting conditions. 
The study terminated after adequate downtitration. 
Sampling schedule:  
Blood samples for the analyses of pramipexole were collected before administration and at 
several points in time up to 24 hours post administration on pre-specified days.  
Serial blood samples were collected at the following time points  
• 
• 
Predose on Days 12-30;

Population(s) studied   
All studies were conducted in healthy male volunteers. All single dose studies were conducted 
in 24 study subjects while the multiple dose study was performed in 36 subjects. In the 
multiple dose study, 32 subjects completed crossover 1 and 34 completed crossover 2. One 
Subject dropped out on day 2 of period 1 (crossover 1) as a result of withdrawing his informed 
consent. Subject 22 was dropped by on day 13 of period 1 (crossover 1) due to a swollen 
painful right knee which required treatment. Subjects 24 and 29 both did not have any 
pharmacokinetic blood samples on day 19 of period 2 (crossover 1) due to adverse events.

Analytical methods   
For studies: 12-365, 12-366, 12-368 and 12-368 HPLC-MS/MS (high performance liquid 
chromatography- mass spectroscopy) method for detection of Pramipexole was used(linear 
concentration range: 10 pg/mL to 10500 pg/mL; limit of quantitation: 10 pg/mL). The method 
has been sufficiently validated and the handling of samples in the studies are considered 
acceptable. 
For study 12-370 a similar validated LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography- mass spectroscopy) 
method for detection of pramipexole was used (linear concentration range: 30 pg/mL to 7500 
pg/mL; limit of quantitation: 30 pg/mL). The method has been sufficiently validated. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
In the single dose studies the following parameters were evaluated:  
•  Area under the plasma concentration curve from administration to last observed 
concentration at time t: AUC 0-t,  
•  Area under the plasma concentration curve extrapolated to infinite time: AUC0-∞,  
•  Maximum plasma concentration: C max,  
• 
Time until Cmax is reached: tmax,  
•  Elimination rate constant: Kel, and  
• 
Plasma concentration half-life: t½ el.  
The primary parameters assessed were: AUC0-t and C max. 
In the multiple dose study the following parameters were assessed:  
•  AUC 0-t,  
•  C max,  
•  Minimum plasma concentration C min, 
•  Mean plasma concentration C avg, 
•  %Fluctation,  
•  Swing ((C max – C min) /C min*100), and 
• 
tmax.  
The primary parameters assessed were: AUC0-t, C max and C min. 
Statistical methods   
In the single dose studies Latin square ANOVA was performed on the ln-transformed C max and 
AUC 0-t. The ANOVA model included sequence, period and treatment as fixed effects with 
subject nested within sequence. 
Assessment report  
EMA/703661/2013 
Page 15/27 
 
  
  
In the multiple dose study separate analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed on the ln-
transformed AUCτ, Cmin, and C max for each crossover (Crossover 1 and Crossover 2). The 
ANOVA model included group sequence, period nested within group, formulation, and 
formulation*group interaction as fixed effects, and subject nested within group*sequence as a 
random effect.  
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence for single dose studies: The 90% confidence interval 
(CI) of the ratio between test and reference for AUC and C max were to be inside the range 
0.8-1.25. 
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence for the multiple dose (steady state) study: The 90% 
CI of the ratios of LSM (Least Square Mean) of AUC 0-t, C max and C min of the test to reference 
formulation were to be within 0.8-1.25.

Safety data 
Only minor adverse events were reported by the MAH to have been observed during the 
conduct of the single dose studies using 0.26 mg, 0.52 and 1.05 mg prolonged release tablets 
(dizziness and headache). In the multiple dose study performed with 1.57 mg and 2.1 mg 
formulations, a total of 538 mild to moderate adverse events were reported by 35 of the 36 
subjects (97%) enrolled. Of these, 323 events occurred during the crossover periods and 215 
events occurred during the up-titration and down-titration phases. The occurrences of adverse 
events were comparable across test and reference treatments  for both dose levels of 
pramipexole. 
Conclusions 
For all studies, the calculated 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean ratios of test 
versus reference product for the primary pharmacokinetic parameters (single dose: C max and

AUC (0-t); steady state: C max, C min and AUC 0-t) lie within the accepted range of 0.8-1.25 (80.00-
125.00%). Therefore, based on the presented bioequivalence study(ies) Oprymea prolonged 
release tablets (0.26, 0.52, 1.05, 1.57 and 2.1 mg) is considered bioequivalent with Sifrol 
prolonged release tablets. 
The results of multiple dose study 12-370 with 1.57 and 2.01 mg formulations can be 
extrapolated to the other strengths included in this application, in line with the conditions in 
the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1, section 
4.1.6, and the Note for guidance on modified release oral and transdermal dosage forms: 
section II (pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation), CPMP/EWP/280/96. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available for Oprymea prolonged release tablets. The medicinal 
product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that the 5 bioequivalence studies, submitted in support of this 
application, have been performed in accordance with principles of GCP and GLP and were 
generally designed, conducted and analysed in accordance with current EU guidelines 
regarding the performance of bioequivalence studies.  
The bioanalytical methods used for detection of pramipexole were both developed based on 
literature references. Overall, the CHMP considered the applied methods as acceptable. Full 
and partial validations have been performed including the lower limit of quantitation. Adequate 
stability data were presented indicating that samples were stable at the end of the analysis 
period and that the results are therefore valid. The sampling time of up to 48 hours for the 
single dose studies was also considered acceptable to ensure measurements over 4-5 half-
lives based on an elimination half-life of approximately 10-12 hours. Likewise, the collection of 
samples 24 hours post dose on days 14, 19 and 21 was considered acceptable for 
measurements of steady state pharmacokinetics. 
The MAH’s justification for a biowaiver, as supported by in vitro dissolution data on similarity 
between additional strengths applied for and the strengths investigated in bioequivalence 
studies, was considered acceptable by the CHMP. Hence, the CHMP considered the absence of 
bioequivalence studies at steady state with 0.26, 0.52, and 1.05 mg tablets acceptable. 
The CHMP furthermore noted that in line with the Note for guidance on modified release oral 
and transdermal dosage forms: section II (pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluation), for single 
unit prolonged release formulations with multiple strengths a single dose study under fasting 
conditions is required for each strength. However, due to dose related safety concerns for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/703661/2013 
Page 20/27 
 
  
  
two highest strengths (1.57 and 2.1 mg, respectively) when given to a volunteer without prior 
up-titration, no single dose studies were conducted with the two highest strengths.  
Similarly, the Note for guidance on modified release oral and transdermal dosage forms 
requires that bioequivalence studies for prolonged release formulations under fed conditions, 
should be conducted with the same strength as those of the pivotal bioequivalence studies. 
However, the CHMP noted that the effect of food was only investigated in the 0.52 mg 
strength and that no such study was conducted for the highest strength used for single dose 
studies under fasting conditions. The MAH explained that the 0.52 mg strength was selected 
over the 1.05 mg strength due to safety concerns for the healthy volunteers. While the 
scientific literature only reports clinically not relevant food effects on Cmax for the reference 
product, a slight increase in Cmax (20%) and AUC (13%) was observed at the time of EU 
approval of Sifrol prolonged release tablets. The MAH judged that for pramipexole 1.05 mg 
prolonged-release tablets already a 25% increase in the exposure could be problematic with 
regards to safety. 
The CHMP considered that the MAH’s justification to omit certain bioequivalence studies with 
higher strengths of the prolonged-release formulation under fasting and fed conditions for 
safety reasons was acceptable. In particular, the CHMP noted that the two highest strengths 
were investigated in bioequivalence studies under steady state conditions and that, as for all 
studies conducted, the pre-set bioequivalence criteria (standard acceptance criteria) were 
met. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Pre-set bioequivalence criteria were met for all bioequivalence studies presented in support of 
this application. Hence, the CHMP considered that Oprymea prolonged release tablets (0.26, 
0.52, 1.05, 1.57 and 2.1 mg) was bioequivalent to the reference product Sifrol prolonged 
release tablets (26, 0.52, 1.05, 1.57 and 2.1 mg).  
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils 
the legislative requirements.  
Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 1.1, the PRAC considers by 
consensus that the risk management system for Pramipexole (Oprymea) in the treatment of

with non-use of pramipexole (observed risk ratio 1.86; 95% CI, 
1.21-2.85). 
Retinal degeneration 
The following information is included in Section 5.3 of the SPC 
(Preclinical safety data): 
A carcinogenicity study showed that, at doses of 2 mg/kg (of 
salt) and higher, pramipexole was associated with retinal 
degeneration in albino rats. The latter finding was not observed 
in pigmented rats, nor in a 2-year albino mouse carcinogenicity 
study or in any other species investigated. 
Photopsia 
Visual impairment including diplopia, vision blurred and visual

Photopsia is considered as covered by this description             
Overdose 
Section 4.9 of the SPC (Overdose): 
There is no clinical experience with massive overdose. The 
expected adverse reactions would be those related to the 
pharmacodynamic profile of a dopamine agonist, including 
nausea, vomiting, hyperkinesia, hallucinations, agitation and 
hypotension. There is no established antidote for overdose of a 
dopamine agonist. If signs of central nervous system stimulation 
are present, a neuroleptic agent may be indicated. Management 
of the overdose may require general supportive measures, along 
with gastric lavage, intravenous fluids, administration of 
activated charcoal and electrocardiogram monitoring.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active 
substance pramipexole; the MAH’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on 
information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
Five bioequivalence studies were provided in support of this application. The study design was 
considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with 
the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time 
as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Oprymea prolonged release tablets met the protocol-defined criteria 
for bioequivalence when compared with the reference product Sifrol. The point estimates and 
their 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean ratios of test versus reference product 
for the primary pharmacokinetic parameters (single dose: C max and AUC (0-t); steady state: 
C max, C min and AUC 0-t) were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of 
80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the 
chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation 
activities are required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Oprymea 0.26 mg, 0.52 mg, 1.05 mg, 1.57 mg, 2.1 
mg, prolonged- release tablets in the indication in adults for treatment of the signs and 
symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, alone (without levodopa) or in combination with 
levodopa, i.e. over the course of the disease, through to late stages when the effect of 
levodopa wears off or becomes inconsistent and fluctuations of the therapeutic effect occur 
(end of dose or "on off" fluctuations).

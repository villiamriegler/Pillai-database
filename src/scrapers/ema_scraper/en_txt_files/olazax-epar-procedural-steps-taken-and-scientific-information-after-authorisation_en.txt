update of the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL) regarding the use

antipsychotics, this is likely to be a class effect. In addition 
to the inclusion of neonatal drug withdrawal syndrome as 
listed adverse reaction, section 4.6 of the SmPC and 
section 2 and 4 of the PL were updated in accordance with 
the PhVWP/CHMP class labelling recommended wording, as 
follows: 
SmPC: Neonates exposed to antipsychotics (including 
olanzapine) during the third trimester of pregnancy are at 
risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or 
withdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and 
duration following delivery. There have been reports of 
agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, 
respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. 
PL: The following symptoms may occur in newborn babies, 
of mothers that have used [NAME] in the last trimester 
(last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle 
stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing 
problems, and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops 
any of these symptoms you may need to contact your 
doctor.

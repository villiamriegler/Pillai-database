The lymph nodes, liver and spleen are the most common sites of extra-medullary in
volvement in ALL. 
These  organs  and  tissues  are  enlarged  as  a  result  of  infiltration  by  blasts.  Lymph
  node  ,  hepatic  or 
splenic  enlargement  may  be  asymptomatic.  However,  intra-thoracic  lymph  node
  enlargement  can 
present  as  a  mediastinal  mass 
with  associated  respiratory  difficulty.  Central  nervous  system  and,  in 
boys, testicular involvement is less common. Signs or symptoms of CNS involvement include headache, 
nausea  and  vomiting,  lethargy,  irritability,  neck  stiffness  and  papilloedema.  Sig
ns  of  cranial  nerve 
involvement  (the  third,  fourth,  sixth  and  seventh  cranial  nerves  are  most  freque
ntly  involved)  may 
occur. ALL can also present as an intracranial or spinal mass causing numerous neur
ological symptoms, 
most  of  which  are  due  to  nerve  compression.  Testicular  involvement  appears  as
  painless  testicular 
enlargement and is most often unilateral.

Therefore, additional treatment is necessary to prevent relapse. In the past, childre

within a median of 4 to 6 months when treatment was not continued beyond the remi

phase.  In  the  late  1960s,  investigators  at  St.  Jude  Children's  Research  Hospital  developed  a  "total 
therapy"  appro
ach  for  the  treatment  of  children  with  ALL.  The  model  included  remission  induction, 
continuation chemotherapy with or without intensification, and preventive CNS therapy. The choice of 
continuation  therapy  was  empiric.  The  early  St.  Jude  studies  evaluated 
6-mercaptopurine, 
methotrexate,  cyclophosphamide,  and  cytarabine  in  various  doses  and  combi
nations.  The  best 
outcome  was  achieved  in  patients  who  received  2  to  3  years  of  daily  oral  6-m

whereas it was only 16% for all other patients. Recent clinical trials have confirmed the importance of 
intensive  re-induction  therapy  or  dose-intensified  antimetabolite  therapy,  even  for  patients  with 
favorable risk features. 
About the product 
The  development  of  the  purine  analogues  in  cancer  chemotherapy  (deVita  et  al  2005)  began  in  the 
early  1950s  with  the  synthesis  of  thiopurines.  The  purine  analogues  6-mercaptopurine  (6-MP)  and 
6-thioguanine (6-TG) continue to be used principally in the management of acute leukemia. 6-MP has 
an  important  role  in  maintenance  therapy  for  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL),  whereas  6-TG  is

active  in  remission  induction  and  in  maintenance  therapy  for  AML.  These  analog
ues  have  a  single 
substitution of a thiol group in place of the 6-hydroxyl group of the purine  base. 6-
MP is a structural 
analogue  of  hypoxanthine,  whereas  6-TG  is  an  analogue  of  guanine.  6-MP  is  an
  inactive  pro-drug 
which  acts  as  a  purine  antagoni
st  but  requires  cellular  uptake  and  intracellular  anabolism  to 
thioguanine  nucleotides  for  cytotoxicity.  Finally,  azathioprine  is  a  derivative  of  6-MP  and  acts  as  a 
prodrug to provide sustained release of 6-MP.

The  efficacy  of  6-mercaptopurine  (6-MP)  for  the  treatment  of  ALL  has  been  esta

years through a number of national and interna
by EU member nations for treating childhood ALL include oral 6-MP. Actual daily doses of 6-MP for the

The  rationale  for  the  development  of  Novapurine  oral  suspension  was  that  a  liquid  formulation  would 
provide  advantages  over  the  single-strength,  solid  tablet  for  the  treatment  of  a  serious  disease  in 
children.  The  proposed  oral  suspension  offers  more  flexibility  and  accuracy  in  terms  of  dosing  and 
improved  ease  of  administration  (and  hence  compliance)  for  children.  This  is  particularly  important 
given that the ideal dosing is to titrate according to haematological values.  
Mercaptopurine  Nova  Laboratories  oral  suspension  (20  mg/  ml)  contains  6-MP  as  monohydrate.  The 
applicant applied for the following indication: treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). It may 
be utilised in induction and consolidation phases of therapy of ALL. It is particularly indicated, however,

The  Applicant  submitted  on    22nd  February  2010  a  request  for  accelerated  assess
ment.  The  request 
was  rejected  since,  even  though  an  age  appropriate  formulation  is 
expected  to  facilitate  the 
administration  of  6-MP  to  children,  the  currently available formulation  (Pur
i-Nethol  50  mg  tablet)  has 
been  used  to  treat  children  for  many  years  with  good  treatment  results,  and  therefore  the  unmet 
medical need was questioned.  
Mercaptopurine was d

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  active  substance  is  Mercaptopurine  monohydrate.  Mercaptopurine  is  a  well-established  active 
substance  that  has  been  marketed  for  several  decades  as  Puri-Nethol®  tablets.  Mercaptopurine  is 
described in the European Pharmacopoeia (PhEur) and US Pharmacopoeia (USP).  
The physico-chemical properties of the active substance (mercaptopurine monohydrate or 6H-Purine-
6-thione, 1,7-dihydro-,monohydrate Purine-6-thiol monohydrate) have been adequately detailed 
including properties such as appearance, melting point, density, solubility, pKa, isomerism (none) and 
polymorphism (none observed).

Metabolism 
6-MP  is  a  pro-drug  and  therefore  requires  metabolism  before  being  able  to  exert  its  therapeutic 
cytotoxic effect. It is activated by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), followed 
by extensive metabolism to TGNs, before being incorporated into the DNA and RNA. The main enzymes 
competing  for  the  initial  metabolism  of  6-MP  are  HGPRT,  thiopurine  methyltransferase  (TPMT), 
aldehyde  oxidase  (AO)  and  xanthine  oxidase  (XO).  Both  XO  and  AO  produce  metabolites  believed  to 
have little or no cytotoxic action (Coulthard S et al., 2005). 
In  vivo  studies  in  rat  showed  6-MP  undergoes  a  high  rate  of  first-pass  metabolism  following  oral 
administration (Sasaki H et al., 1987).

In a study performed in rats after repeated administration of 6-MP by ip route for 1
2 days (Innocenti F 
et  al.,  1999),  6-MP  was  actively  metabolised.  6-MP  biotransformation  can  be
  modulated  by  agents 
acting on enzymes of the purine metabolism, resulting in significant changes in erythrocytes and tissue 
levels of 6-mercaptopurine nucleotides (6-MPN) and the active 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN).

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In  vivo studies  in  rabbit showed  that  intravenous co-administration  of  allopurinol 
with  6-MP  caused  a 
2-fold  increase  in  the  half-life  and  AUC  of  6-MP,  a  2-fold  decrease  in  total  body  clearance  and  an 
approximate  3-fold  decrease  in  elimination  rate  constant.  Allopurinol  had  negligible  effects  on  the 
arameters  of  the  major  metabolite,  6-thiouric  acid,  suggesting  that  allopurinol

Single dose toxicity studies were reported in the literature (Clarke DA et al., 1953). The LD50s of 
mercaptopurine in mouse, rat and cat by various routes of administration are provided in the following

Regardless  of  the  route  of  administration,  the  pattern  of  mortali
ty  following  single  high  doses  of 
mercaptopurine  were  similar  in  mice  with  mortality  typically  occurring  4  to  7  days  after  dosing,  with 
animals  typically  appearing  normal  for  up  to  6  hours  after  dosing.  For  sub-lethal  doses,  transient 
bodyweight losses were noted for up to a week after dosing which were subsequently recovered during 
the  following  week.  Mortality  occurred  at  an  earlier  stage  in  rat,  with  the  majority  of  mortalities 
occurring within 24 to 48 hours of dosing. At these high doses, there were severe effects on respiration 
in rat which was not noted in mouse.

Carcinogenicity 
In the IARC monograph (1987), it is reported that 6-MP was tested by intraperitoneal administration in 
mice and by intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous injection in rats. Limitations to the data in 
all reports precluded evaluation of possible carcinogenicity of this compound.  
A  2-year  carcinogenicity  study  published  in  the  literature  was  also  provided  to  document  the 
carcinogenic  potential  of  6-MP.  In  this  study  (Maekawa  A  et  al.,  1990),  mercaptopurine  was 
administered to F344 rats via the diet at dose levels of 0, 25 or 50 ppm for 2 years. 
In males, there was no significant increase in the incidence of any tumour in the treated groups over 
that arising spontaneously in the control group.  
In females, there were positive trends noted in the occurrence of several tumour types, including C-cell 
tumours,  pheochromotytomas,  uterine  adenocarcinomas  and  glioma,  with  the  incidence  of  C-cell

of  delayed  hypersensitivity.  Mercaptopurine  was  also  able  to  block  the  peripheral  manifestations  of 
immunity (skin reactions to antigens) without affecting the immune status of the animal. These various 
actions of mercaptopurine were brought out under selected conditions of timing, dosage and mode of 
antigen  administration.  The  processes  leading  to  the  development  of  delayed  hypersensitivity  were

necessary, as it would not add significantly to the existing knowledge. In terms of safety pharmacology

A 2 year oral (dietary) carcinogenicity study in rat showed positive trends towards a
 higher incidence 
of certain tumours such as C-cell tumors, pheochromocytomas, uterine adenocarci
nomas and gliomas, 
and  the  incidences  of  C-cell  tumors  and  pheochromocytomas  in  the  highest  dose  group  were 
significantly  higher  than  the  values  in  the  respective  control  group.  In  addition,  th
e  total  numbers  of 
malignant  tumors  increased  significantly  in  the  female  in  the  high  dose  group.  M
ost  of  the  tumors 
showing  high  incidence  in  this  study  are  frequently  observed  as  spontaneous  lesio
ns  in  this  strain  of 
rats,  however  the  study  is  of  insufficient  quality  to  allow  for  an  adequate  assessm
ent.  Nevertheless, 
due  to  the  clear  genotoxic  potential  of  mercaptopurine  shown  both  in-vitro
  and  in-vivo,  the 
carcinogenic potential of mercaptopurine cannot be excluded. This is adequately ex
pressed in  sections 
4.4 and 5.3 of the SPC. 
6-MP, in common with other cytotoxics, has shown to be teratogen
ic in experimental animals at doses 
similar  or  greater  than  those  used  therapeutically  in  humans.  Increased  frequencies  of  fetal  death, 
central  nervous  system,  facial  and limb  anomalies were  observed  among  offspring
s  of  mice,  rats  and 
rabbits treated a
t various times during organogenesis. In all species, the degree of embryotoxicity and 
the  type  of  malformations  are  dependent  on  the  dose  and  stage  of  g
estation  at  the  time  of 
administration. In addition to a direct lethal effect on foetuses,
 mercaptopurine affected the ability of 
surviving  female  foetuses  to  reproduce  upon  reaching  maturity  and  malformations
  in  the  second  and 
third generation of offspring were reported. Mercaptopurine did not affect the viabi
lity of differentiated 
spermatogonia and stem cells in the
 mouse but did produce some large round spermatids (presumed 
to be diploid) and a high frequency of abnormally shaped elongated spermatids. The
 text in section 4.6 
and relevant instructions in the package leaflet adequately r
eflect this information.  
No  juvenile  toxicology  studies  have  been  conducted  but  the  clinical  experience  in  this  regard  is 
considered sufficient. 
The local skin irritation properties of mercaptopurine were studied as part of a transdermal drug 
delivery system. This study is however not relevant for the current application.  
No non-clinical studies have been conducted to assess oropharyngeal toxicity. Given the long history of 
use of mercaptopurine and the extensive clinical database, the Applicant considers that the non-clinical 
assessment of local tolerance is unnecessary.  
Oropharyngeal mucositis is considered unlikely to be influenced by local exposure to mercaptopurine, 
but will be influenced by systemic levels of TGN, the active metabolite.

Mercaptopurine has been tested for skin irritation in mouse and human with 23 hour exposure per day 
for 21 days and shown to be non-irritant. 
According  to  the  CHMP  Scientific  Advice  given,  data  on  local  tolerance  of  the  new  fo
rmulation  in  an 
adequate  animal  study  would  be  considered  of  relevance  since  the  surface  of  o
ral,  pharyngeal  and 
oesophageal  mucosa  and  peri-oral  skin  (due  to  accidental  spilling)  exposed  to  dissolved  drug  is 
expected  to  be  considerably  higher  after  intake  of  a  liquid  formulation  than  after 
intake  of  a  tablet. 
Since these data were insufficient this issue is addressed in the clinical section. 
Scientific  advice  has  been  sought  by  the  Applicant  as  to  whether  there  is  a  n
eed  for  non-clinical 
pharmacology  or  toxicology  studies  in  relation  to  the  excipients  intended  to  be 
used  in  the  ‘to  be 
marketed’ formulation. The CHMP advised that the necessity of any excipient used
 in the formulation 
has  to  be  demonstrated  and  the  content  of  all  excipients  should  be  restricted  to  a
  minimum  without 
affecting the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug product. The discussion
 can be based on thorough 
literature  research,  considerations  of  the  long  term  administration  of  the  proposed  drug  product  and 
special  emphasis  on  the  intended  use  in  children  undergoing  chemotherapy.  The 
CHMP  also  advised 
the applicant to discuss risk associated with the use of the preservatives propyl pa

and  methyl  parahydroxybenzoate  at  the  proposed  long  term  treatment  in  ac

Generally, the use of propyl hydrobenzoate in pharmaceuticals for the paediatric p
opulation should be 
avoided  because  of  its  endocri
ne  disrupting  properties.  However,  the  level  of  propyl  hydrobenzoate 
exposure for patients treated with Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories is calculated by the Applicant to 
be less than 0.25% of the LOAEL which is considered to be low. The applicant has
 acknowledged the 
recommendations  of  the  CHMP  to  minimize  or  eliminate  the  content  of 
higher  esters  of 
hydroxybenzoate  in  Mercaptopurine  Nova  Laboratories.  If  required,  a  revised  f
ormulation  will  be 
introduced by variation of
 the marketing authorization.  
The  content  of  aspartame  in  the  liquid  formulation  of  mercaptopurine  is  low  and  a
prescribed for ALL will be less than 1% of the accepted daily intake (ADI). This is ac
with the CHMP Scientific advice given. 
t  the  typical  doses 
ceptable and in line 
The  estimated  UVmax  for  mercaptopurine  seems  to  be  328nm  and  biodistribu
tion  studies  in  the 
pigmented tissues are lacking. Normally, in these situations the lack of phototoxicity studies should be 
justified  but  due  to  the  extensive  clinical  experience  with  mercaptopurine  the  lack  of  photoxicity 
studies is considered acceptable.  
In  order  to  evaluate  the  potential  environmental  risk  in  the  EU  resulting  from  the  use  of  6-
mercaptopurine  monohydrate  in  Mercaptopurine  Nova  Laboratories  20  mg/  mL  Oral  Suspension,  an 
environmental risk assessment has been performed and submitted. 
Based on estimations from published epidemiological data (assuming a 100% market  share for child 
and adult ALL) and clinical information, a refined value for market penetration (Fpen) of 0.0000154 for 
6-mercaptopurine  in  Mercaptopurine  Nova  Laboratories  20  mg/  mL  Oral  Suspension  has  been  
established. This value is considerably lower than the default value of 0.01 in the CHMP Guideline on 
the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,

acokinetic  properties  of  6-mercaptopurine  tablet  formulation  are  well  known  out  of  the 
experience  with  Puri-Nethol  50  mg  tablets  and  are  summarised  below.    A  bioequivalence  study 
intended to bridge the existing data with the new liquid formulation was submitted
 as a basis for this 
application.

form
The Stockley’s drug interaction database reports three food interaction studies in ch
ildren. In one study, 
administration  of  mercaptopurine  15  minutes  after  a  standard  breakfast  including  milk  delayed  Tmax 
and  reduced  the  AUC  and  Cmax  by  26%  and  36%,  respectively.  However,  in  another  study  a  high 
inter-individual  variation  was  seen,  but  no  clear  effect  of  a  breakfast  consisting  of  milk  or  yoghurt, 
cereal  and  sandwiches,  on  mercaptopurin  bioavailability.  Yet  another  study  showed  a  not  statistically 
significant decrease in AUC and/or Cmax by 20-22% after a standardised breakfast, again with a wide 
inter-individual  variation.  In  vitro  data  indicate  that  mercaptopurine  is  catabolised  in  cow’s  milk, 
suggested due to the presence of the mercaptopurine-metabolising enzyme xanthine oxidase which is 
present in milk.  
The  Applicant  presented  a  case  report  (Sofianou-Katsoulis  et  al,  2006)  of  a  patient  who  during  the 
maintenance phase had elevated peripheral blood counts despite increasing the 6-MP dose to 160% of 
the calculated dosage for his body surface area (BSA). It was found out that the boy routinely took the

chemotherapy with cow’s milk. After changing to water, the 6-MP dose could be red
uced to the normal 
dose (100% of the calculated dose for his BSA). The authors suggest that the reduc
ed bioavailability of 
6-MP at administration with cow’s milk could be due to the high content of xanthine ox
idase in 6-MP. 
Rivard et al, 1989, showed that incubation of 6-MP with pasteurised cow’s milk at 3
7ºC for 30 minutes 
resulted  in  30%  catabolism  of  6-MP.    There  was  no  effect  if  the  milk  was  boiled 
for  5  minutes.  In  a 
study  in  17  children  with  ALL,  Riccardi  et  al,  1986,  demonstrated  that  administrat
ion  of  6-MP  with  a 
breakfast, including 250 ml m
ilk, reduced AUC by about 27%. In a study by Lonnerholm et al, 1989, 
on  the  other  hand,  there  was  no  difference  in  the  mean  bioavailability  of  6-MP  when  taken  with 
breakfast compared with the fasted state (mean ratio 1.03) but the individual fed/fasted ratios varied 
considerably, between 0.33 and 1.81.

The study was conducted in healthy, male volunteers. A total of 60 adult healthy volunteers were to be 
enrolled.    Dropouts  were  to  be  replaced  if  the  number  of  subjects  completing  the  study  would 
otherwise be less than 60. However, there were no drop-outs and all 60 subjects completed both study 
periods and were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.  
Analytical methods 
Plasma  samples  were  stored  at  -70ºC  in  the  clinic  until  shipped  to  the  analytical  laboratory.  Plasma 
concentrations of mercaptopurine were determined with a validated LC/MS/MS method. 6-thioguanine 
was used as internal standard. Altogether, 1920 plasma samples from 60 volunteers were analysed.

Elimination 
6-MP disappears rapidly from plasma, with t1/2 values of 20 to 90 minutes reported after intravenous 
administration. Generally, no parent compound is detected in plasma 8 hr after dose. However, 6-MP is 
activated intra-cellularly by conversion to cytotoxic ribonucleotide derivates, which have a longer half-
life  (approximately  5  hours).  The  active  6-MP  ribonucleotides  are  formed  via  hypoxantin  guanine 
phosphoribosyl  transferase  in  a  step-wise  process.  6-MP  ribonucleotide  inhibits  purine  nucleotide 
synthesis and metabolism which in turn alters the synthesis and function of RNA and DNA.  
In  the  liver,  mercaptopurine  is  rapidly  and  extensively  metabolised  by  methylation  and  oxidation  as 
well  as  the  formation  of  inorganic  sulfates.  S-metylated  metabolites  are  formed  via  tiopurine 
methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT activity is highly variable in patients due to genetic polymorphism. In 
a  Caucasian  population,  approximately  89%  have  normal  enzyme  activity,  11%  intermediate  activity 
and  0.3%  low  or  non-detectable  activity.  On  chronic  dosing,  low  TPMT  activity  leads  to  a  high

should  standardise  the  method  of  administration.  The  dose  should  not  be  taken  with  milk  or  dairy 
products (see section 4.5).  Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories should be taken at 
least 1 hour before 
or 2 hours after milk or dairy products. 
Section 4.5 : 
The administration of 6–mercaptopurine with food may decrease systemic exposure slightly but this is 
unlikely to be of clinical significance. Therefore, Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories may be taken with 
food or on an empty stomach, but patients should standardise the method of administration. The dose 
should not be taken with milk or dairy products since they contain xanthine oxidase, an enzyme which 
metabolises  6–mercaptopurine  and  might  therefore  lead  to  reduced  plasma  concentrations  of 
mercaptopurine. 
The  available  evidence  suggests  administration  of  mercaptopurine  in  the  evening  results  in  greater 
efficacy and hence reduced risk of relapse, therefore the optimal time of the day for Novapurine intake 
is in the evening. The following wording is included in section 4.2:

This application is to seek the indication of ALL for an oral 6MP liquid formulation where tablets are the 
only available formulation so far. This liquid alternative would allow treating patients (including adults)

problem of dose adaptation in children since the currently available tablets make it necessary to crush

6-MP  is  titrated  according  to  haematological  response,  usually  measured  by  neutrophil  and  platelet

2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical ef
ficacy 
In  this  application  no  further  clinical  efficacy  studies  were  provided  with  6-merca
ptopurine  because 
there  is  enough  clinical  experience  from  currently  available  data  since  oral  6-MP 
in  the  tablet  form 
(Puri-Nethol) is already licensed in the EU for the treatment of ALL. This is in line with Scientific Advice 
given to the Applicant. 
At the request of the CHMP the Applicant collected all data currently available in the EU from use of the 
proposed oral suspension to provide reassurance that the formulation is accepted by children in terms 
of  palatability.  This  may  have  implications  on  compliance  (and  thereby  efficacy)  and  reassurance  is 
needed that compliance is not lower than it is for the tablet.  
The  bioequivalence  study  suggested  that  the  two  products  have  similar  bioavailability  (AUC)  but  that 
absorption was more rapid from the suspension, with a considerably higher Cmax. Given that the 6-MP 
dose  is  always  individually  titrated  based  on  haematological  response/toxicity,  and  since  toxicity  is 
coupled  to  the  pharmacological  action  of  6-MP,  it  is  agreed  that  additional  clinical  data  to  confirm 
efficacy  of  the  oral  suspension  are  not  considered  necessary,  despite  the  difference  in  rate  of

mercaptopurine is withdrawn early enough. In TPMT-deficient patients, dosage redu
of the standard dosage (75 mg/m2/d) is necessary to prevent excessive toxicity (see
clinical pharmacology).  
Finally, due to myelosuppression, the concomitant use of mercaptopurine with yell
contraindicated.  Moreover,  immunisation  using  a  live  organism  vaccine  has  the

recommended. 
6-MP is hepatotoxic and hepatotoxicity occurs in up to 30% of adult patients and is
 manifested mainly 
as cholestatic jaundice, although elevations of hepatic transaminases may also
 be seen. Hepatotoxicity 
is usually mild and reversible after discontinuation of 6-MP, but frank hepatic necro
sis can occur after 
high doses of the drug. Combinations of 6-MP with other known hepatotoxic agents shoul
d be avoided, 
and  liver  function  test  results  should  be  closely  monitored.  The  mechanism  of 
liver  toxicity  is  not 
known  but  may  relate  to  the  cytochrome  P-450–dependent  metabolism  of  6-MP
  to  a  hepatotoxic 
metabolite  o
r  accumulation  of  6-MP  metabolites  in the  liver.  Liver  function  tests  should be  monitored 
weekly  during  treatment.  More  frequent  monitoring  may  be  advisable  in  those  with  pre-existing  liver 
disease  or  receiving  other  potentially  hepatotoxic  therapy.  The  patient  should  be  instructed  to 
discontinue Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories immediately if jaundice becomes apparent 
Similarly,  during  remission  induction  when  rapid  cell  lysis  is  occurring,  uric  acid  levels  in  blood  and 
urine should be monitored as hyperuricaemia and/or hyperuricosuria may develop, with the risk of uric 
acid nephropathy. Hydration and urine alkalinisation may minimize potential renal complications. 
Pancreatitis has  been  reported  to  occur  at  a frequency  of ≥  1/100  to  <  1/10  (“common”)  in  patients 
treated for inflammatory bowel disease.

2.7 Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.  
Risk Management plan 
The CHMP did not require the applicant to submit a risk management plan because it is accepted that 
risk management plans are generally not required for hybrid products where the active substance has 
been  on  the  market  for  a  long  time,  unless  a  safety  concern  requiring  additional  risk  minimisation 
activities has been identified with the reference product. This argument is considered relevant for the 
substance itself.

Surveillance of medication errors as a consequence of confusion with the use of syringes is part of the 
routine Pharmacovigilance strategy. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  routine  p
harmacovigilance 
was adeq
uate to monitor the safety of the product. 
No  additional  risk  m
inimisation  activities  were  required  beyond  those  included  in  the  product 
information.  
2.8 User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
ap licant show that the package le
p
aflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
6-MP remains an integral part of ALL treatment protocols in children. So far, the only licensed product 
on the EU market is a 50 mg tablet, which should not be divide
d, but in practice this has to be done in 
order to find an appropriate dose for the individual patient.  
During  therapy  of  ALL,  the  dose  of  6-MP  is  individualised,  essentially  based  on  ha
ematologic  toxicity. 
Compared  with  tablets,  which  is  the  only  currently  available  licensed  formulation,
  an  oral  suspension 
provides  better  accuracy  and  ease  of  administration  in  small  children.  From  an  efficacy  as  well  as 
safety perspective this is favourable.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  dose-limiting  toxicity  is  the  haematological  effect.  As  the  mercaptopurine  dose  is  individually 
titrated  based  on  haematological  response,  no  additional  systemic  toxicity  is  expected  from  the  oral 
suspension compared with the previously approved tablet. If a switch from tablets to oral suspension, 
or vice versa, is undertaken, the physician, patients and parents should be made aware that the dose 
may need to be adjusted.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
From  a  Quality  and  Non-clinical  perspective,  the  choice  of  propylpa
raben  as  preservative  was 
questioned, but the exposure of the patient is low, well below the lowest observed adverse event level. 
Nevertheless, it is recommended to the Applicant to eliminate this preservative in th
e future.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The  availability  of  a  suspension  provides  better  accuracy  and 
ease  of  administration  especially  when 
used  in  small  childre
n  and  this  is  important  from  an  efficacy  as  well  as  safety  perspective.  The 
haematological toxicity is part of the action of mercaptopurine, well managed by titration of the drug 
for individual use. The well known toxicity profile of mercaptopurine is expected to 
be better managed 
with more accurate dosing achieved with Mercapto
purine Nova Laboratories.   
Benefit-risk balance 
The  benefit-risk  balance  of  Mercaptopurine  Nova  Laboratories  oral  suspension 
20  mg/ml  for  the 
treatment of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia is positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-ri
sk balance 
Historically, the risk-benefit profile of 6-MP for the treatment of ALL have been well established based 
on  numerous  multi-centre,  multi-national  trials  in 
the  EU  and  other  developed  countries. 
Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories oral suspension ensures better precision and ease of administration 
than the existing tablet form and importantly, it will provide an alternative formula
tion for children who 
are  unable  to  swallow  tablets,  and  for  clinicians,  an  alternative  preparation  t
hat  also  allows  more 
flexible dosing. 
4.  Recom
mendations  
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus decision is of the opinion that Mercaptopurine Nova L
aboratories is not similar 
to Atriance, Evoltra, Glivec or Sprycel within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No. 847/200. See appendix 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Mercaptopurine Nova Laboratories in the treatment of acute 
lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in adults, adolescents and children is favourable and therefore 
recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

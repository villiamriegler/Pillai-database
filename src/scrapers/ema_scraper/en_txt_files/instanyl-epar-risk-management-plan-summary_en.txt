Summary of risk management plan for Instanyl (fentanyl citrate)
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Instanyl.  The  RMP  details 
important  risks  of  Instanyl,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimized,  and how  more  information 
will be obtained about Instanyl's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Instanyl's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Instanyl should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Instanyl should  be  read in the context of all  this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns or  changes  to  the  current  ones will  be  included  in  updates  of 
Instanyl's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Instanyl  is  authorized  for  the  management  of  breakthrough  pain  (BTP)  in  adults  already 
receiving  maintenance  opioid  therapy  for  chronic  cancer  pain. (See  SmPC  for  the  full 
indication).  It  contains  fentanyl  citrate  as  the  active  substance,  and  it  is  given  by  nasal 
spray.
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Instanyl’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Instanyl’s 
EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the
medicine’s webpage:

II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further 
characterize the risks 
Important  risks  of Instanyl,  together  with  measures  to  minimize  such  risks  and  the
proposed studies for learning more about Instanyl's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;



Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In the case of Instanyl, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analyzed, including  PSUR  assessment so  that immediate action  can be  taken 
as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If  important information  that  may  affect the  safe  use  of Instanyl is  not  yet  available,  it  is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Instanyl are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimize  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  taken. 
Important risks can be  regarded as  identified  or  potential.  Identified risks  are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Instanyl. Potential risks are concerns 
for  which  an  association  with  the use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data, 
but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing 
information  refers  to  information  on  the  safety  of  the  medicinal  product  that  is  currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks
Important identified risk: Addiction
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Dependence, often confused with addiction, is an expected 
response in cancer patients necessitating prolonged and 
continuous opioid therapy for pain management.
Risk factors and risk groups
In the case of off label or illicit use, the progression to opioid 
dependence may have dire consequences, including a yearly 
mortality rate of approximately 2%. Moreover, sustained 
remission from opioid dependence is difficult to achieve.
The target population is at high risk of opioid dependence as 
persistent and chronic cancer pain is expected to be managed with 
long-term strong opioids. Patients with prior substance abuse and 
underlying concomitant chronic non-cancer pain may be at higher 
risk for dependence and its associated risks of misuse, abuse, 
overdose, and off label use. There do not appear to be gender

Important identified risk: Misuse
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is 
intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the 
terms of the marketing authorization (GVP Module VI). Misuse can 
be characterized as not taking the medication according to 
prescription, unsanctioned use, altering the route of delivery, 
among others. 
Abuse of fentanyl, when it develops, is an issue, which has 
implications for the patients’ quality of life, and which requires 
treatment for resolution.
Patients with prior substance abuse and underlying chronic, non-
cancer pain may be at higher risk for dependence and its 
associated risks of misuse, abuse, overdose, and off label use. 
When Instanyl is used among those patients who are being 
treated for BTP, there may be a potential for misuse (overuse) 
due to inadequate baseline control of cancer pain. Misuse may 
also occur due to inadequate knowledge in correct use of the 
medication as prescribed. This is in large part attributable to the 
nature of the disease and associated polypharmacy used, care 
given by multiple providers and in some cases, confusion or 
mental compromise due to disease progression. Among patients 
who are using the medication for non-cancer indication (off label) 
those with history of substance abuse, alcohol abuse, family 
history of either, psychiatric illness or other lifestyle factors that 
compromise the overall well-being, the risk of intentional drug 
misuse is considerably higher. The elderly are also more 
susceptible to pain medication misuse. The elderly comprise 13% 
of the US population but receive over 30% of all prescribed 
medications, including analgesics.

Important identified risk: Abuse 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Abuse corresponds to persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive 
use of medicinal products which is accompanied by harmful 
physical or psychological effects (GVP Module VI). Abuse of 
fentanyl is considered to present a moderate risk among opioid-
tolerant persons due to associated behaviors deriving social, 
familial, criminal complications. Abuse in terms of overdose or 
misuse is moderate to severe due to consequences such as 
respiratory depression that can occur due to overdose (accidental 
or otherwise) and result in life-threatening or fatal outcomes. This 
risk is higher when abuse pertains to the opioid-naïve person who 
may be taking concomitant CNS depressants.
Patients with inadequate baseline control of cancer pain may be at 
risk for abuse. Patients suffering from chronic pain, concomitant 
to cancer pain or without, requiring opioid treatment. Other 
factors that may put some patients at increased risk of opioid
abuse/addiction include a personal/family history of substance, 
prescription medication and alcohol abuse, and major psychosocial 
issues (e.g. psychological/psychiatric disorders). Furthermore, 
prescription abuse is increasing among women and this may be 
correlated with a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety or

Important identified risk: Diversion
Evidence for linking the risk to

Risk factors and risk groups
Diversion of narcotics is a known risk of narcotic analgesics.
Drug diversion, broadly defined, is when the legal supply chain of 
prescription analgesic drugs is broken, and drugs are transferred 
from a licit to an illicit channel of distribution or use. 
There are life-threatening consequences of opioid-naïve overdose, 
at worst, fatal respiratory depression.
Patients inappropriately using fentanyl-containing medicines, 
patients with family members who suffer from chronic pain or 
substance abuse disorders, patients identified to have financial or

Important identified risk: Off label Use
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Off label use relates to situations where a medicinal product is 
intentionally used for a medical purpose not in accordance with 
the terms of the marketing authorization (GVP Module VI). 
Opioid analgesics in clinical practice may be used ‘off label’ due to 
inter-individual variability or prescribed in conditions in which 
some experts recommend against opioid use e.g. use in patient 
with non-cancer pain, absence of background opioid treatment, 
administration of high doses and absence of titration, fibromyalgia 
or long-term use of opioids in chronic non-cancer pain.
If used outside the indication in opioid-naïve patients there is a 
risk of respiratory depression as stated in the SmPC.
Risk factors and risk groups

Important identified risk: Medication errors
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Medication error refers to an unintended failure in the drug 
treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, 
harm to the patient (GVP Module VI). Dy et al., (2007) observed 
644 harmful error reports in opioid medication errors from 222 
facilities and found that 60% were errors in route of 
administration and 21% were prescribing errors. About one-fourth 
(23%) caused underdosing and 52% caused overdosing of an 
opioid medication. Morphine and hydromorphone had the highest 
improper dose errors (40% and 41%) than other opioids.
Opioid-naïve patients and children are at a high risk of developing 
adverse effects due to possible overdose as a result of a 
medication error. Respiratory depression may occur, and the 
event may become fatal.

Important identified risk: Respiratory depression
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
As with all potent opioids clinically significant respiratory 
depression may occur with fentanyl, and patients must be 
observed for these effects. Patients with pain who receive chronic 
opioid therapy may develop tolerance to respiratory depression 
and hence the risk of respiratory depression in these patients may 
be reduced. The concomitant use of CNS depressants may 
increase the risk of respiratory depression. Respiratory depression 
can be moderate to severe in nature and require medical 
intervention. In severe cases, it can be life-threatening and fatal.
Risk factors and risk groups
Patients not taking maintenance opioid therapy, opioid-naïve 
patients.
Patients taking CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, and nelfinavir) or 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., amprenavir, aprepitant, 
diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and 
verapamil) may result in increased fentanyl plasma 
concentrations, potentially causing serious ADRs including fatal 
respiratory depression.
The concomitant use of other CNS depressants, including other 
opioids, sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, 
phenothiazines, tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, sedating 
antihistamines and alcohol may produce additive depressant 
effects.
Unborn children are at risk if the pregnant mother is receiving 
treatment with fentanyl and breast-feeding infants are also at risk 
Important identified risk: Respiratory depression
if the mother is receiving treatment with fentanyl.
Patients who misuse/abuse fentanyl are at higher risk of overdose 
and therefore respiratory depression. The manifestations of 
fentanyl overdose are an extension of its pharmacological actions, 
the most serious effect being respiratory depression.

Important identified risk: Serotonin syndrome induces by interaction between fentanyl and 
serotoninergic drugs
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine
The severity of serotonin syndrome is highly variable. However, 
reactions may also result in severe hypertension and tachycardia 
that abruptly deteriorates into cardiovascular shock. Fatalities 
have occurred.
Severe and unpredictable interactions with MAOIs, involving the 
potentiation of opiate effects or the potentiation of serotonergic 
effects, have been reported.
Risk factors and risk groups
There is a risk of serotonin syndrome when drugs that inhibit the 
reuptake of serotonin are combined. Classes of drugs inhibiting 
serotonin reuptake activity include MAOIs, SSRIs and SNRIs. 
Other risk factors include:

Cytochrome P450 drug interactions or specific patient 
phenotypes making them more susceptible to serotonin 
syndrome 
Important identified risk: Serotonin syndrome induces by interaction between fentanyl and 
serotoninergic drugs
Medical conditions that decrease the available monoamine oxidase

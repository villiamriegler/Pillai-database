The results of this DUS study showed an increase in 
N/PSR/S/0019 
adherence to the SmPC guidelines in the post-RMM period 
compared to the pre-RMM period. This increase in 
adherence was measured for all the four criteria under 
study. Therefore, in view of available data regarding the 
PASS final study report, the PRAC considered that changes 
to the conditions of the marketing authorisation were 
warranted.

clinical study CL3-16257-068, a 6-week randomised 
double-blind parallel-group international multicentre study 
to evaluate the anti-anginal efficacy and safety of oral 
administration of ivabradine compared to placebo on top of 
a background therapy with a calcium antagonist 
(amlodipine or nifedipine) in patients with stable angina 
pectoris.  
The following information on the study has been included in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC:

“In a 1277-patients randomised placebo-controlled study, 
ivabradine demonstrated a statistically significant additional 
efficacy on response to treatment (defined as a decrease of 
at least 3 angina attacks per week and/or an increase in 
the time to 1 mm ST segment depression of at least 60 s 
during a treadmill ETT) on top of amlodipine 5 mg o.d. or 
nifedipine GITS 30 mg o.d. at the trough of drug activity 
(12 hours after oral ivabradine intake) over a 6-week 
treatment period (OR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.0–1.7]; p=0.012). 
Ivabradine did not show additional efficacy on secondary 
endpoints of ETT parameters at the trough of drug activity 
while an additional efficacy was shown at peak (3-4 hours 
after oral ivabradine intake).”

SmPC, Annex 
Since the initial registration, the SmPC of ivabradine states 
warning that heart rate reduction, as caused by 
II, Labelling 
that the use of ivabradine in patients with congenital QT 
ivabradine, may exacerbate QT prolongation, which 
and PL 
syndrome or treated with QT prolonging medicinal products 
could give rise to severe arrhythmias. In addition 
another warning was added to section 4.5 of the 
SmPC that potassium-depleting diuretics should be 
used with caution in combination with ivabradine due 
to the risk of severe arrhythmias, especially in 
patients with long QT interval. In section 4.8 of the 
SmPC “ECG interval QT prolonged” was added in the 
SOC “Investigations” under category “uncommon”. 
The Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in 
accordance. 
In addition two numerical mistakes were corrected in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Furthermore, the MAH proposed this opportunity to 
bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template 
version 8.0. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
should be avoided since QT prolongation may be 
exacerbated by heart rate reduction. Physiologically, QT 
interval varies inversely with heart rate, so an increase in 
the measured QT interval was predicted under ivabradine 
as with other heart rate lowering agents. Ivabradine was 
not shown to cause changes in QT interval other than those 
resulting from heart rate reduction on uncorrected QT. 
Nevertheless, in order to reinforce the existing precaution 
in such high risk population, and further to the extension of 
indication of ivabradine in congestive heart failure patients, 
in whom diuretics are widely prescribed in accordance with 
the current guideline of the European Society of Cardiology, 
a recommendation was added to use ivabradine with 
precautions in combination with potassium-depleting 
diuretics (thiazidic and loop diuretics). The SmPC was also 
updated with a warning that heart rate reduction, as 
caused by ivabradine, may exacerbate QT prolongation,

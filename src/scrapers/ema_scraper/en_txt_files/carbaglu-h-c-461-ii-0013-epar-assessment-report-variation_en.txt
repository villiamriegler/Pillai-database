1.  Introduction 
On  02JUN2016,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Hyperammonemia  in  Organic 
Acidemia  Decompensation,  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as 
amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study title and number is a stand alone study: 
Retrospective Observational Study of Hyperammonemia in Organic Acidemia Decompensation Episodes 
in Patients Treated with Carbaglu® with/or without Ammonia Scavengers versus Ammonia Scavengers 
Alone. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
No information was provided regarding the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study. However the 
drug product / name was “Carglumic acid (Carbaglu®) “ thus it is assumed that it is the one marketed 
in EU. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
OE-CGA001-OA2009  and  OE-CGA001-OA2012;  "Retrospective  Observational  Study  of 
Hyperammonemia  in  Organic  Acidemia  Decompensation  Episodes  in  Patients  Treated  with 
Carbaglu®  with/or  without  Ammonia  Scavengers  versus  Ammonia  Scavengers  Alone"  (study 
code: OE-CGA001-OA2009/ 0E-CGA001-OA2012) 
• 
exploratory analysis of the pooled results of these 2 retrospective observational studies 
(OE-CGA001-OA2009 and OE-CGA001-OA2012); 
Resumé 
In  2009,  a  retrospective  observational  study  (OE-CGA001-OA2009)  was  submitted  to  the  EMA  to 
support the claim of an extension of the indication of Carbaglu in the treatment of hyperammonemia 
due  to  organic  acidemias  (Methyl-Malonic  academia/MMA,  Propionic  Acidemia/PA,  Isovaleric 
Acidemia/IVA). The new indication for Carbaglu was approved in the European Union in May 2011. 
Clinical study report (dated 31 August 2015)  
Later in 2012, Orphan Europe wanted to also extend the indication of Carbaglu in US. For this purpose, 
it  was  advised  to  Orphan  Europe  to  add  a  comparative  arm  to  study  OE-CGA001-OA2009  by 
conducting  a  retrospective  observational  study  to  evaluate  hyperammonemia  in  OA  decompensation 
episodes in patients treated with NH3 scavengers without carglumic acid.

This study, with protocol number OE-CGA001-OA2012, is considered as the control arm of study OE-
CGA001-OA2009.  Study  OE-CGA001-OA2012  was  set  up  and  conducted  in  the  closest  possible 
conditions  to  study  OE-CGA001-OA2009,  particularly  regarding  the  type  of  study,  the  selected  sites, 
the  period  of  data  collection  and  the  data  collected.  The  data  from  the  two  studies  were  pooled;  an 
analysis by treatment group was performed. This analysis supports the efficacy and safety of carglumic 
acid  (Carbaglu)  for  the  treatment  of  hyperammonemia  due  to  PA,  MMA  and  IVA.  This  study  showed 
that the reduction of plasma NH3 level occurred faster in patients treated with carglumic acid with or 
without  NH3  scavengers.  This  reduction  was  particularly  marked  during  the  first  hours  of  the  acute 
hyperammonemic metabolic decompensation i.e. when it is critical to rapidly decrease the plasma NH3 
level to limit potential neurological sequelae. 
Addendum to clinical study report (dated 21 September 2015)  
An addendum to this CSR written later and dated 21 September 2015 is also included. It summarizes 
the  exploratory  analysis  of  the  pooled  results  of  these  2  retrospective  observational  studies  (OE-
CGA001-OA2009 and OE-CGA001-OA2012) in 3 separate treatment groups: carglumic acid only (Study 
OE-CGA001-OA2009),  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2009),  and  NH3 
scavengers  only  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2012).  Ammonia  level  data  were  censored  at  the  time  of 
extracorporeal detoxification initiation. The purpose of this exploratory analysis is to examine the effect 
of carglumic acid without the effect of NH3 scavengers or extracorporeal detoxification (HD/HF/PD) in 
patients with OA following episodes of hyperammonemic decompensation. Use of carglumic acid alone 
does not reflect clinical practice since the primary goal of treatment is to adequately treat patients as 
soon as possible using all available medications to reduce NH3 levels quickly. 
Depending  on  NH3  levels,  NH3  detoxification  usually  occurs  through  the  use  of  a  combination  of 
pharmacological  treatments  to  eliminate  NH3  excess  (e.g.,  NH3  scavengers:  sodium  benzoate  or 
sodium  phenylbutyrate)  and/or  through  extracorporeal  detoxification,  such  as  Hemodialysis, 
Hemofiltration or Hemodiafiltration, or Peritoneal dialysis in  severely decompensated patients. Due to 
their  invasive  nature,  extracorporeal  detoxification  is  usually  initiated  when  other  measures  fail  to 
control  hyperammonemia.  The  age  of  the  patient,  local  facilities,  and  center  experience  orient  the 
choice  of  extracorporeal  detoxification  method.  At  present,  none  of  these  NH3  scavengers  are 
approved  for  the  treatment  of  hyperammonemia  associated  with  propionic  acidemia  (PA),  methyl-
malonic acidemia (MMA), or isovaleric acidemia (IVA) in the European Union (nor in US).

OE-CGA001-OA2009/ OE-CGA001-OA2012: Retrospective Observational Study of Hyperammonemia in 
Organic Acidemia Decompensation Episodes in Patients Treated with Carbaglu® with/or without 
Ammonia Scavengers versus Ammonia Scavengers Alone 
Description 
Studies  OE-CGA001-OA2009  and  OE-CGA001-OA2012  were  retrospective  observational  studies 
conducted  to  evaluate  hyperammonemia  in  OA  decompensation  episodes  in  patients  treated  with 
carglumic  acid  with  or  without  NH3  scavengers  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2009:  treatment  group)  and 
NH3  scavengers  only  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2012:  control  group).  Data  regarding  decompensation 
episodes from 01 January 1995 until 31 October 2009 were recorded in as many patients as possible

enrolled  in  key  experienced  European  hospitals  in  Italy,  France,  Spain,  and  the  United  Kingdom 
(Studies  OE-CGA001-OA2009  and  OE-CGA001-OA2012)  and  Germany,  the  Netherlands,  and  Turkey 
(Study OE-CGA001-OA2009). 
The  pooled  results  of  these  2  retrospective  observational  studies  (OE-CGA001-OA2009  and  OE-
CGA001-OA2012)  is  summarized  in  3  separate  treatment  groups:  carglumic  acid  only  (Study  OE-
CGA001-OA2009),  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2009),  and  NH3 
scavengers  only  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2012).  Ammonia  level  data  were  censored  at  the  time  of 
extracorporeal detoxification initiation. The purpose of this exploratory analysis is to examine the effect 
of carglumic acid without the effect of NH3 scavengers or extracorporeal detoxification (HD/HF/PD) in 
patients with OA following episodes of hyperammonemic decompensation. 
Use of carglumic acid alone does not reflect clinical practice since the primary goal of treatment is to 
adequately  treat  patients  as  soon  as  possible  using  all  available  medications  to  reduce  NH3  levels 
quickly. 
Depending  on  NH3  levels,  NH3  detoxification  usually  occurs  through  the  use  of  a  combination  of 
pharmacological  treatments  to  eliminate  NH3  excess  (e.g.,  NH3  scavengers:  sodium  benzoate  or 
sodium  phenylbutyrate)  and/or  through  extracorporeal  detoxification,  such  as  HD,  HF,  or  PD  in 
severely decompensated patients. Due to their invasive nature, extracorporeal detoxification is usually 
initiated when other measures fail to control hyperammonemia. The age of the patient, local facilities, 
and center experience orient the choice of extracorporeal detoxification method. 
At  present,  none  of  these  NH3  scavengers  are  approved  for  the  treatment  of  hyperammonemia 
associated with propionic acidemia (PA), methyl-malonic acidemia (MMA), or isovaleric acidemia (IVA) 
in the US or Europe. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The post-hoc exploratory analyses discussed in this addendum were performed in 3 treatment groups: 
• Carglumic acid only (Study OE-CGA001-OA2009) 
• Carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers (Study OE-CGA001-OA2009) 
• NH3 scavengers only (Study OE-CGA001-OA2012) 
Data related to demographics, other baseline characteristics, and efficacy are presented by episode of 
decompensation  and  data related  to  safety  are  presented  by  episode  and  patient.  For  some patients, 
data  from  several  episodes  were  collected.  Since  these  episodes  may  have  been  treated  differently, 
data  related  to  them,  despite  being  from  the  same  patient,  may  have  been  included  in  different 
treatment groups. 
Study design 
This  was  a  pooling  of  retrospectively  acquired  data  in  studies  OE-CGA001-OA2009  and  OE-CGA001-
OA2012.

The rationale for these post-hoc analyses (3 treatment groups and censored data) was to better assess 
the isolated effect of carglumic acid in lowering NH3 levels over time by removing 2 main confounding 
NH3-reducing factors: NH3 scavengers and HD/HF/PD. 
Study population /Sample size 
The  safety  set  (SS)  included  all  decompensation  episodes  from  patients  enrolled  in  1  or  both  studies 
who received at least 1 dose of study treatment (carglumic acid, NH3 scavengers). 
The  full  analysis  set  (FAS)  included  all  decompensation  episodes  from  patients  enrolled  in  1  or  both 
studies who received at least 1 dose of study treatment (carglumic acid, NH3 scavengers) and had a 
confirmed diagnosis of OA (PA, MMA, or IVA) by the treating physician. 
The  post-hoc  exploratory  analyses  were  conducted  on  the  FAS  population.  For  the  efficacy  analyses, 
NH3 data was censored at the time of HD/HF/PD initiation. 
The post-hoc exploratory analyses were limited to: 
• Demographic summary with descriptive statistics only: Demography, Baseline characteristics, Study 
treatment dosing and Concomitant medications. 
Treatments 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy summaries: 
- Summary of daily plasma NH3 levels by 12-hour periods from 0 to 48 hours and by 24-hour periods 
from Day 2 to Day 5 
The highest NH3 levels by period were summarized using descriptive statistics. The mean ratio 
to  baseline  was  calculated  and  compared  between  treatment  groups  (in  pairs)  using  the 
Wilcoxon test. 
- Success rate 
Success  rate  was  defined  as  achieving  a  plasma  NH3  level  <=  60  μmol/L  (in  the  absence  of 
death, initiation of HD/HF/PD, or withdrawal from treatment for safety reasons): the proportion 
of success in each treatment group was computed with its 95% confidence interval (CI) using 
the Clopper-Pearson method; the 2 proportions were compared using the Fisher’s exact test. 
- Time to success 
Kaplan-Meier  survival  curves  for  time  to  success  (in  the  absence  of  death,  initiation  of 
HD/HF/PD, or withdrawal from treatment for safety reasons) were produced for each treatment 
group. The 3 treatment groups were compared using the log-rank test. 
- Summary of clinical symptoms and markers at baseline and endpoint 
-  Change  in  the  number  of  clinical  symptoms  and  markers:  analyzed  from  baseline  to  endpoint  with 
descriptive statistics 
- Shift in clinical symptoms and markers (symptoms versus no symptoms): analyzed from baseline to 
endpoint

- Adverse event (AE) summaries with descriptive statistics 
Statistical Methods 
General Considerations 
Continuous  variables  were  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics:  mean,  standard  deviation  (SD), 
median,  interquartile  range  (Q1  -  Q3),  range  of  values  (i.e.,  minimum  and  maximum  values),  and 
number of patients and/or number of episodes. 
Categorical data were presented using counts and percentages. Percentages were calculated according 
to the number of patients/episodes for whom/which data were available. 
For  safety  analyses,  descriptive  statistics  were  used  to  summarize  safety  parameters  by  treatment 
group. Adverse events were summarized at the patient and episode level with regard to number of AEs 
per  patient,  and  presented  as  a  summary.  Adverse  events  were  also  summarized  at  the  event  level 
with  regard  to  the  relationship  to  treatment,  action  taken,  and  outcome,  and  presented  in  tabular 
form. Finally, the number and percentage of episodes/patients experiencing each AE within each body 
system were summarized overall in tabular form. 
Post-hoc  statistical  analyses  were  performed  on  the  database  locked  on  02  July  2014.  All  analyses 
were  produced  using  the  Statistical  Analysis  Systems  (SAS®)  software  versions  9.2/9.3,  (SAS 
Institute,  Cary,  Northern  Carolina,  USA)  and  Adclin®  software  version  TPF  3.2.2  (Adclin  SA,  Paris, 
France). 
Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
With regard to dropouts and missing data, the same rules as in the full CSR were applied for the post-
hoc analyses. No imputations were performed on missing plasma NH3 data. 
Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
No  correction  to  nominal  p-values  for  multiple  comparisons  was  applied.  All  tests  were  considered 
significant at the 5% significance level (i.e., p ≤ 0.05). These post-hoc analyses should be considered 
exploratory,  and  inferences  made  based  on  p-values  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Statistical 
tests should be considered to be descriptive/suggestive rather than conclusive. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A consort chart by episode is presented in Figure 1. Note that the same patient may have had several 
episodes  that  were  treated  differently  which  explains  the  difference  between  the  number  of  patients 
and the number of episodes in each treatment group. 
A  total  of  102  episodes  were  collected:  39  episodes  in  the  carglumic  acid  group,  36  episodes  in  the 
NH3 scavengers group, and 27 episodes in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. 
Among  the  102  episodes  collected,  3  episodes  were  considered  screen  failures  (study  treatment  not 
received [n=2] and episode already included [n=1]). All 99 episodes were included in the SS. A total of 
98  episodes  from  83  patients  were  included  in  the  FAS;  1  episode  was  excluded  due  to  a  diagnosis 
other than OA.

Baseline data 
Demographic Data 
Demographic data by episode for patients included in the FAS are presented in Table below. 
The majority of episodes in all treatment groups occurred in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of PA 
although  the  proportion  was  higher  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group  than  the  other  2  groups  (50.0%  in 
the carglumic acid group, 81.8% in the NH3 scavengers group, and 51.9% in the carglumic acid + NH3 
scavengers group). 
Episodes  occurred  in  a  relatively  even  number  of  females  and  males  in  all  treatment  groups  and 
median gestational age of patients was 39.0 weeks in all groups.

Table 1 – Demography - FAS (N = 98 Episodes) 
History of the Disease 
The median age at diagnosis was 13.0 days (Q1 - Q3 = 5.0 - 33.0 days) in the carglumic acid group, 
9.5  days  (Q1  -  Q3  =  5.0  -  19.5  days)  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group,  and  8.0  days  (Q1 -  Q3  =  5.0  - 
15.0 days) in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. 
A family history of OA was reported in a greater proportion of episodes in the NH3 scavengers group 
(48.5%) than in the carglumic acid (15.8%) or the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers (7.4%) groups. 
Likewise,  consanguinity  of  parents  was  reported  in  a  greater  proportion  of  episodes  in  the  NH3 
scavengers group (69.7%) than in the carglumic acid (42.1%) or the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers 
(29.6%) groups. 
Summary of Episodes 
Summary of episodes data are presented in Table 2.  
The median number of days between the start of the episode and the start of treatment was 1 day in 
all treatment groups. More than 80% of the episodes ended within 15 days, with a median duration of 
episodes of 6.0 days in the carglumic acid and carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers groups, and 8.5 days 
in the NH3 scavengers group. 
The median duration of treatment was 4.0 days in the carglumic acid and NH3 scavengers groups, and 
5.0 days in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. 
End  of  the  treatment  was  due  to  the  end  of  the  episode  in  31  out  of  35  (88.6%)  episodes  in  the 
carglumic acid group, 16 out of 31 (51.6%) episodes in the NH3 scavengers group, and 25 out of 27 
(92.6%) episodes in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. 
End of the treatment was due to death in 3 out of 35 (8.6%) episodes in the carglumic acid group, 3 
out  of  31  (9.7%)  episodes  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group,  and  none  of  the  episodes  in  the  carglumic 
acid + NH3 scavengers group.

Switched  to  long-term  treatment  was  reported  only  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group  (10  out  of  31 
episodes, 32.3%). No episode reported lack of efficacy or AE as a reason for the end of treatment.

Baseline Characteristics of Episode 
Baseline characteristics of episodes included in the FAS are presented in Table 3.

The median age at the start of the episode was lower in the carglumic acid  + NH3 scavengers group 
(0.2  months  or  5.0  days)  than  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  (1.7  months  or  50.5  days)  or  the  NH3 
scavengers group (2.2 months or 68.0 days). 
The  median  baseline  NH3  level  was  higher  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (270.9 
μmol/L) than in the carglumic acid group (199.0 μmol/L) or the NH3 scavengers group (122.0 μmol/L). 
Table 3 – Baseline Characteristics of Episode - FAS (N = 98 Episodes) 
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Prior  medications  included  ongoing  treatment  at  the  time of  enrollment  and  before  the  start  of  study 
treatment. 
As expected, most of the prior and concomitant medications corresponded to treatment used to treat 
and monitor the metabolic decompensation and to prevent life-threatening complications. An overview 
of the treatments of interest initiated to treat the episode by treatment group is presented in Table 4. 
The  most  common  treatment  in  all  treatment  groups  was  carnitine  (90  out  of  98  episodes,  91.8%). 
Carnitine is given to compensate for secondary carnitine deficiency caused by urinary loss of carnitine 
bound  to  organic  acids.  Carnitine  seems  to  contribute  to  the  reduction  of  hyperammonemia  in  PA 
patients and to demonstrate antioxidant capacity

Table 4 – Medications of Interest during the Episode - FAS 
Hemodialysis/Hemofiltration/Peritoneal Dialysis 
Extracorporeal detoxification methods data by episode for patients included in the FAS are presented in 
Table 5. 
The  percentage  of  episodes  treated  with  HD/HF/PD  was  similar  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  (13.2%) 
and the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (11.1%), less than half of the percentage in the NH3 
scavengers group (30.3%). 
In  the  majority  of  episodes  for  which  data  was  collected,  the  patients  did  not  receive  HD/HF/PD 
treatment (80 out of 98 episodes, 81.6%).

Efficacy results 
Daily Plasma NH3 Levels 
A  summary  of  the  change  in  maximum  daily  NH3  levels  over  time  for  episodes  included  in  the  FAS 
(NH3 data censored at HD/HF/PD initiation) is presented in Table 6. Data are presented at baseline and 
after  initiation  of  treatment  by  period  of  treatment  up  to  and  including  120  hours  (5  days)  of 
treatment,  corresponding  to  the  acute  phase  of  the  hyperammonemic  metabolic  decompensation

episode.  Note  that  median  duration  of  treatment  was  4.0  days  in  the  carglumic  acid  and  NH3 
scavengers groups and 5.0 days in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. 
In addition, a summary of mean ratio in NH3 levels to baseline over time for episodes included in the 
FAS (NH3 data censored at HD/HF/PD initiation) is presented in Figure 2 by 12-hour periods from 0 to 
48 hours and Figure 3 by 24-hour periods from Day 1 to Day 5. 
Change  from  baseline  was  calculated  as  the  maximum  NH3  level  during  the  given  time  period  minus 
the last NH3 value prior to treatment initiation. Ratio to baseline was calculated as the maximum NH3 
levels  during  the  given  time  period  divided  by  the  last  NH3  value  prior  to  treatment  initiation. 
Reduction from baseline was calculated as 1 - [ratio to baseline] x 100. 
During the first 12 hours after treatment initiation, the mean ratio to baseline in the carglumic acid + 
NH3  scavengers  group  was  0.731;  this  corresponds  to  a  mean  reduction  from  baseline  of  -26.9% 
which is statistically significantly different (p=0.0238) from the NH3 scavengers group (mean ratio to 
baseline = 1.116, mean reduction from baseline = +11.6%). During the same time period, the mean 
ratio to  baseline in  the  carglumic  acid  group  was  0.866  which  corresponds  to  a  mean  reduction  from 
baseline of -13.4% which, when compared to the mean reduction from baseline in the NH3 scavengers 
group, was just above the statistical significance level limit (p=0.0576). 
From 12 to 24 hours after treatment initiation, there was no statistically significant difference between 
the  mean  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (-51.9%)  and  the 
NH3  scavengers  group  (-21.5%;  p=0.0806)  or  the  carglumic  acid  group  (-46.8%)  and  the  NH3 
scavengers group (p=0.1821), although the mean reductions were more than double in the carglumic 
acid-containing groups. 
From 24 to 36 hours after treatment initiation, there were statistically significant differences between 
the  mean  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (-71.2%)  and  the 
NH3  scavengers  group  (-6.6%;  p=0.0003)  and  the  carglumic  acid  group  (-43.8%)  and  the  NH3 
scavengers  group  (p=0.0183).  During  the  same  time  period,  there  was  also  a  statistically  significant 
difference  between  the  mean  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  and  the  carglumic 
acid + NH3 scavengers group (p=0.0120). 
From 36 to 48 hours after treatment initiation, there were statistically significant differences between 
the  mean  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (-63.6%)  and  the 
NH3  scavengers  group  (-15.2%;  p=0.0274)  and  the  carglumic  acid  group  (-62.5%)  and  the  NH3 
scavengers group (p=0.0348). 
From 48 to 72 hours after treatment initiation, there continued to be statistically significant differences 
between  the  mean  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (-75.6%) 
and  the  NH3  scavengers  group  (-16.3%;  p=0.0011)  and  the  carglumic  acid  group  (-65.9%)  and  the 
NH3  scavengers  group  (p=0.0054).  There  were  statistically  significant  differences  between  the  mean 
reduction from baseline in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group and the NH3 scavengers from 
72  to  96  hours  after  treatment  initiation  (p=0.0136)  and  from  96  to  120  hours  after  treatment 
initiation (p=0.0184), both in favor of the combination group.

Success/Failure 
Success was defined as 2 consecutive measures of plasma NH3 level equal to or below the threshold of 
60  μmol/L  without  i)  HD/HF/PD  started  after  the  initiation  of  treatment  by  carglumic  acid  or  NH3 
scavengers,  ii)  death,  or  iii)  treatment  withdrawal  for  safety  reasons.  Improvement  without  success 
confirmed was defined as the last post-baseline NH3 assessment equal to or below 60 μmol/L without 
i) HD/HF/PD treatment initiated after the first day of treatment, ii) death, or iii) treatment withdrawal 
for  safety  reasons.  The  proportion  of  success  and  improvement  without  success  confirmed  in  each

treatment  group  was  computed  with  its  95%  CI  using  the  Clopper-Pearson  method.  In  the  carglumic 
acid  group,  10  out  of  38  episodes  (26.3%)  were  treated  with  success  and  improvements  were  seen 
with  treatment  in  11  out  of  38  episodes  (28.9%).  There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference 
between treatment groups (p = 1.0000). 
Time to Success/Failure 
The time to success/improvement was calculated as the time from the first treatment administration to 
the  time  of  the  first  value  of  NH3  equal  to  or  below  60  μmol/L  after  treatment  initiation.  The  3 
treatment groups were compared using the log-rank test for homogeneity between strata. 
In  the  carglumic  acid  group,  it  took  34  hours  to  achieve  success/improvement  in  25%  of  episodes. 
There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  treatment  groups  in  the  time  to 
success/improvement (p = 0.7380). 
Changes in Clinical Symptoms and Markers 
Table 7 summarizes the neurological findings and feeding difficulties observed in >10% of episodes in 
any  treatment  group  at  baseline  as  these  2  parameters  are  most  relevant  at  the  onset  of  metabolic 
decompensation. 
The number of episodes with clinical symptoms and markers in all categories was generally higher in 
all treatment groups at baseline than at endpoint.

Overall,  shifts  in  findings  from  symptoms  at  baseline  to  no  symptoms  at  endpoint  occurred  for  the 
majority of categories.

At  baseline,  in  most episodes  (86%  to  100%)  across  all  3 treatment  groups,  patients presented  with 
neurological findings. The  shift from neurological findings at baseline to normal neurological status at 
endpoint occurred for 9 out of 18 (50%), 4 out of  11 (36%), and 5 out of 11 (45%) episodes in the 
carglumic acid group, the NH3 scavengers group, and the combination group, respectively. 
Rarely,  patients  with  no  neurological  symptoms  at  baseline  developed  symptoms  at  endpoint;  this 
occurred in 1 (5%) episode in the carglumic acid group, 1 (8%) episode in NH3 scavengers group, and 
no episode in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. 
Similarly,  at  baseline,  in  most  episodes  (86%  to  100%)  across  all  3  treatment  groups,  patients 
presented  with  feeding  difficulties.  The  shift  from  feeding  difficulties  at  baseline  to  normal  feeding  at 
endpoint occurred for 11 out of 19 (58%), 9 out of 12 (75%), and 8 out of 10 (80%) episodes in the 
carglumic acid group, the NH3 scavengers group, and the combination group, respectively. 
No  patient  in  any  treatment  group  developed  feeding  difficulties  at  endpoint  when  the  symptom  was 
not present at baseline.

HD/HF/PD initiation) 
Table  9  summarizes  the  number,  as  well  as  the  change  from  baseline,  of  neurological  findings  and 
feeding difficulties. 
The  median  change  in  the  number  of  neurological  findings  from  baseline  to  endpoint  was  -2.0  in  the 
carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group and -1.0 in both the carglumic acid and the NH3 scavengers 
groups. The median change in the number of feeding difficulties from baseline to endpoint was -1.0 in 
all 3 treatment groups. 
Overall,  the  number  of  clinical  findings,  including  clinical,  laboratory,  neurological,  psychiatric,  and 
respiratory  findings  and  feeding  difficulties,  from  baseline  to  endpoint,  decreased  in  all  treatment 
groups.

Safety results 
Extent of exposure 
In the carglumic acid group, all episodes (n = 38) were orally treated with carglumic acid; the mean 
(SD) daily dose of carglumic acid during the first 24 hours of treatment was 152.2 (123.1) mg/kg for 
patients  in  the  FAS.  Likewise,  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group,  all  episodes  (n  =  27) 
were orally treated with carglumic acid; the mean (SD) daily dose of carglumic acid during the first 24 
hours of treatment was 171.2 (94.7) mg/kg for patients in the FAS. Twenty (74.1%) of the episodes in 
this treatment group were treated concomitantly with 1 NH3 scavenger and 7 (25.9%) of the episodes 
in this treatment group were treated concomitantly with 2 NH3 scavengers. 
Treatment  with  NH3  scavengers  was  given  intravenously  in  72%  of  episodes.  Sodium  benzoate  was 
the  most  popular  concomitant  NH3  scavenger  used  (alone  in  66.7%  of  episodes  and  in  combination 
with sodium phenylbutyrate in 25.9% of episodes); the median (range) dose of sodium benzoate was 
257.8  (149-790)  mg/kg  .  Sodium  phenylbutyrate  was  used  alone  in  7.4%  of  episodes  and  in 
combination  with  sodium  benzoate  in  25.9%  of  episodes;  the  median  (range)  dose  of  sodium 
phenylbutyrate was 282.0 (169-5625) mg/kg. 
The median doses of the NH3 scavengers in the combination group were similar to the median doses in 
the NH3 scavengers group. In the NH3 scavengers group, the median (range) dose of sodium benzoate 
during  the  first  24  hours  of  treatment  was  250.0  (81-1000)  mg/kg  and  the  median  (range)  dose  of 
sodium phenylbutyrate during the first 24 hours of treatment was 277.8 (58-971) mg/kg.

A summary of AEs for patients/episodes included in the FAS is presented in Table 10. 
In total, 61 AEs were experienced by 17 (50.0%) patients during 19 (50.0%) episodes in the carglumic 
acid group, 97 AEs were experienced by 15 (68.2%) patients during 19 (57.6%) episodes in the NH3 
scavengers group, and 21 AEs were experienced by 11 (40.7%) patients during 11 (40.7%) episodes 
in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. Patients in the NH3 scavengers group experienced the 
greatest number of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs; n = 85), serious TEAEs (n = 31), severe TEAEs 
(n = 34), deaths (n = 14), and treatment-emergent deaths (n = 13). 
Patients in the carglumic acid group experienced the greatest number of drug-related TEAEs (n = 18) 
and drug-related serious TEAEs (n = 5). 
In  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group,  6  TEAEs  and  1  serious  TEAE  were  considered  drug-
related.  Drug-relatedness  in  the  combination  treatment  group  was  assessed  as  related  to  carglumic 
acid treatment exclusively and not to treatment with NH3 scavengers. 
Overall,  the  AEs  reported  in  the  study  were  largely  related  to  the  disease/condition  (i.e.,  metabolic 
decompensation) rather than drug toxicity.

Deaths 
A total of 22 fatal TEAEs occurred in 10 patients/episodes: 3 fatal TEAEs occurred in 3 patients (8.8%) 
during 3 episodes (7.9%) in the carglumic acid group, 13 fatal TEAEs occurred in 4 patients (18.2%) 
during  4  episodes  (12.1%)  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group,  and  6  fatal  TEAEs  occurred  in  3  patients 
(11.1%) during 3 episodes (11.1%) in the carglumic acid group + NH3 scavengers group. 
Other SAEs 
A  total  of  51  serious  TEAEs  occurred  in  20  patients/episodes:  13  serious  TEAEs  (5  considered  drug-
related)  occurred  in  8  patients  (23.5%)  during  8  episodes  (21.1%)  in  the  carglumic  acid  group,  31 
serious  TEAEs  (none  considered  drug-related)  occurred  in  8  patients  (36.4%)  during  8  episodes 
(24.2%)  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group,  and  7  serious  TEAEs  (1  considered  related  to  carglumic  acid) 
occurred  in  4  patients  (14.8%)  during  4  episodes  (14.8%)  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  +  NH3 
scavengers group. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Efficacy 
In  this  very  exploratory  analysis,  the  efficacy  of  treatment  with  carglumic  acid  compared  to  NH3 
scavengers  was  assessed  through  comparisons  of  plasma  NH3  levels  during  hyperammonemia  in  OA 
decompensation episodes prior to or not treated with extracorporeal detoxification (HD/HF/PD) in order 
to examine the effect of carglumic acid without confounding NH3-reducing treatments. 
This  comparison,  based  on  paired  retrospective  comparison,  yields  very  low  quality  or  strength.  Yet, 
given the rareness of the condition, the scarce population and the risks of non treatment within a short 
period of time, this approach may be the only one valuable in the near future. 
The following conclusions may be understood from the study: 
•  During  the  12-hour  periods  from  treatment  initiation  to  48  hours  and  the  24-hour  periods 
thereafter  until  120  hours,  the  mean  reduction  in  NH3  levels  from  baseline  in  the  carglumic 
acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  and  the  carglumic  acid  group  were  greater  than  in  the  NH3 
scavengers  group  despite  that  both  groups  had  higher  NH3  levels  at  baseline.  Overall,  NH3 
reductions from baseline were greatest in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. 
•  Differences  between  the  combination  group  and  the  NH3  scavengers  group  were  statistically 
significant in favor of the combination group during all time periods except from 12 to 24 hours 
after  treatment  initiation  even  though  the  mean  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  combination 
group was more than double that in the NH3 scavengers group. 
• 
There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  treatment  groups  in  rate  of 
success/improvement (p = 1.0000) or time to success/improvement (p = 0.7380). 
•  Overall, the number of clinical findings, including clinical, laboratory, neurological, psychiatric, 
and  respiratory  findings  and  feeding  difficulties,  from  baseline  to  endpoint,  decreased  in  all 
treatment groups. The median change in the number of findings from baseline to endpoint was

-4.0 in the carglumic acid group and -3.0 in both the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers and the 
NH3 scavengers groups. 
•  An overall shift in findings from symptoms at baseline to no symptoms at endpoint occurred for 
the majority of findings, including the neurological findings and feeding difficulties categories. 
The  shift  from  neurological  findings  at  baseline  to  normal  neurological  status  at  endpoint 
occurred  for  9  out  of  18  (50%),  4  out  of  11  (36%),  and  5  out  of  11  (45%)  episodes  in  the 
carglumic  acid  group,  the  NH3  scavengers  group,  and  the  combination  group,  respectively. 
Simarly the shift from feeding difficulties at baseline to normal feeding at endpoint occurred for 
11 out of 19 (58%), 9 out of 12 (75%), and 8 out of 10 (80%) episodes in the carglumic acid 
group, the NH3 scavengers group, and the combination group, respectively. 
• 
The median change in the number of neurological findings from baseline to endpoint was -2.0 
in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group and -1.0 in both the carglumic acid and the NH3 
scavengers  groups.  The  median  change  in  the  number  of  feeding  difficulties  from  baseline  to 
endpoint was -1.0 in all treatment groups. 
•  Median duration of treatment was 4.0 days in the carglumic acid and NH3 scavengers groups 
and 5.0 days in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. More than 80% of the episodes 
ended within 15 days; the median duration of episodes was 6.0 days in the carglumic acid and 
carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers groups, and 8.5 days in the NH3 scavengers group. 
Safety 
Analysis of the safety data in the 3 treatment groups showed that: 
• 
• 
The mean (SD) daily dose of carglumic acid during the first 24 hours of treatment for patients 
in the FAS was in the same range in the carglumic acid group (152.2 [123.1] mg/kg) and the 
carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (171.2 [94.7] mg/kg). 
Likewise, 
the  median  (range)  dose  of  NH3  scavengers  (sodium  benzoate/sodium 
phenylbutyrate) during the first 24 hours of treatment for patients in the FAS was similar in the 
carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group (257.8 [149-790] mg/kg / 282.0 [169-5625] mg/kg) 
and the NH3 scavengers group (250.0 [81-1000] mg/kg / 277.8 [58-971] mg/kg). 
•  Overall,  the  AEs  reported  in  the  study  were  largely  related  to  the  disease/condition  (i.e., 
metabolic decompensation) rather than drug toxicity. 
• 
• 
Patients  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group  experienced  the  greatest  number  of  TEAEs  (n  =  85), 
serious  TEAEs  (n  =  31),  severe  TEAEs  (n  =  34),  deaths  (n  =  14),  and  treatment-emergent 
deaths  (n  =  13).  Patients  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  experienced  the  greatest  number  of 
drug-related TEAEs (n = 18) and drug-related serious TEAEs (n = 5). 
The  SOC  with  the  greatest  number  of  TEAEs  was  general  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions (n = 10) in the carglumic acid group, metabolism and nutrition disorders (n = 26) in 
the NH3 scavengers group, and blood and lymphatic system disorders (n = 3) in the carglumic 
acid + NH3 scavengers group. 
•  A  total  of  3  fatal  TEAEs  occurred  in  3  patients  (8.8%)  during  3  episodes  (7.9%)  in  the 
carglumic  acid  group,  13  fatal  TEAEs  occurred  in  4  patients  (18.2%)  during  4  episodes 
(12.1%)  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group,  and  6  fatal  TEAEs  occurred  in  3  patients  (11.1%) 
during 3 episodes (11.1%) in the carglumic acid group + NH3 scavengers group.

This report presents the exploratory analysis of data collected in 2 different retrospective studies from 
patients hospitalized due to metabolic hyperammonemic decompensation episodes in OA (PA, MMA and 
IVA). Propionic acidemia, MMA and IVA  are rare inherited metabolic diseases which are characterized 
by a dysfunction of a specific step in amino acid catabolism, leading to accumulation of organic acids in 
blood and urine as well as high NH3 concentrations. Hyperammonemia is one of the most severe, life-
threatening  symptoms  in  metabolic  decompensation  episodes.  High  NH3  levels  are  neurotoxic 
[Butterworth,  1998]  and  it  has  been  shown  that  longer  durations  and  higher  values  of 
hyperammonemia  are  associated  with  poorer  neurological  outcomes  [Bachmann,  2003].  Prompt 
management  of  the  disease,  by  using  all  pharmacological  treatments  and  methods  available,  is 
required to avoid, or at least limit, the potential neurological sequelae encountered in OA patients. 
In the full CSR (dated 31 August 2015), patients/episodes were divided into 2 treatment groups: those 
treated  with  carglumic  acid  with  or  without  NH3  scavengers  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2009)  and  those 
treated  with  NH3  scavengers  only  (Study  OE-CGA001-OA2012).  In  this  Addendum,  patients/episodes 
were  divided  into  3  treatment  groups:  those  treated  with  carglumic  acid  only  (Study  OE-CGA001-
OA2009), those treated with carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers (Study OE-CGA001-OA2009), and those 
treated with NH3 scavengers only (Study OE-CGA001-OA2012). In addition, NH3 data presented were 
censored at the time of HD/HF/PD initiation in order to further isolate the potential effects of carglumic 
acid without other NH3-reducing treatments. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Data from a total of 98 episodes were included in the FAS; 60 of these episodes occurred in patients 
with  a  diagnosis  of  PA  (61.2%),  32  of  these  episodes  occurred  in  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  MMA 
(32.7%),  and  6  of  these  episodes  occurred  in  patients  with  a  diagnosis  IVA  (6.1%).  The  relatively 
small number of IVA patients is consistent with the frequency observed in clinical practice. 
The median age at the start of the episode was lower in the carglumic acid  + NH3 scavengers group 
(0.2  months  or  5.0  days)  than  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  (1.7  months  or  50.5  days)  or  the  NH3 
scavengers group (2.2 months or 68.0 days). Furthermore, mean NH3 levels at baseline were higher in 
the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (346  μmol/L)  than  in  the  carglumic  acid  group  (257 
μmol/L) or the NH3 scavengers group (227 μmol/L). 
The  patient  population  included  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavenger  group  appears  slightly  more 
severe  taking  into  consideration  2  key  risk  factors:  younger  age  and  initial  levels  of  ammonemia.  In 
addition, all of the patients whose episodes were treated with the combination of carglumic acid + NH3 
scavengers  displayed  neurological  findings  and  feeding  difficulties,  the  2  most  relevant  clinical 
symptoms  in  metabolic  decompensation,  at  baseline.  On  the  contrary,  patient  populations  in  the 
carglumic acid and the NH3 scavengers groups were comparable with regard to demographics and risk 
factors. 
The median duration of treatment was 4.0 days in the carglumic acid and NH3 scavengers groups, and 
5.0 days in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. The median duration of episodes was 6.0 days 
in  the  carglumic  acid  and  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  groups,  and  8.5  days  in  the  NH3 
scavengers group. 
During  the  12-hour  periods  from  treatment  initiation  to  48  hours  and  the  24-hour  periods  thereafter 
until  120  hours,  the  mean  reduction  in  NH3  levels  from  baseline  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3

scavengers  group  and  the  carglumic  acid  group  were  greater  than  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group. 
Overall, NH3 reductions from baseline were greatest in the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers group. 
Differences between the combination group and the NH3 scavengers group were statistically significant 
in favor of the combination group during all time periods except from 12 to 24 hours after treatment 
initiation  even  though  the  mean  reduction  from  baseline  in  the  combination  group  was  more  than 
double that in the NH3 scavengers group. 
Overall,  the  number  of  clinical  findings,  including  clinical,  laboratory,  neurological,  psychiatric,  and 
respiratory  findings  and  feeding  difficulties,  from  baseline  to  endpoint,  decreased  in  all  treatment 
groups.  The  median  change  in  the  number  of  findings  from  baseline  to  endpoint  was  -4.0  in  the 
carglumic acid group and -3.0 in both the carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers and the NH3 scavengers 
groups. In addition, an overall shift in findings from symptoms at baseline to no symptoms at endpoint 
occurred  for  the  majority  of  findings,  including  the  neurological  findings  and  feeding  difficulties 
categories, in all treatment groups. 
A  greater  percentage  of  episodes  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group  (30.3%)  were  treated  with 
extracorporeal  detoxification  (HD/HF/PD)  than  in  the  carglumic  acid  (13.2%)  or  the  carglumic  acid  + 
NH3  scavengers  groups  (11.1%).  Since  NH3  levels  are  one  of  the  main  biological  parameters  that 
trigger the decision to start these procedures, it is possible that the more rapid reduction in NH3 levels 
seen in episodes treated with carglumic acid may have lead to a decision not to initiate HD/HF/PD. 
This  exploratory  analysis,  attempting  to  examine  the  isolated  effect  of  carglumic  acid,  the  data  may 
suggest  that  carglumic  acid  is  effective in  reducing NH3  levels.  Whether  it  may  be  more  rapidly  than 
NH3  scavengers,  especially  during  the  first  hours  that  are  critical  to  limit  potential  unfavorable 
neurological outcomes remains to be confirmed in a more powerful seting. Acute hyperammonemia is a 
medical  emergency,  which  may  require  HD/HF/PD  for  rapid  removal  of  NH3,  with  adjunctive 
pharmacological treatment and protein restriction to prevent serious neurological sequelae. The use of 
NH3  scavengers,  is  still  debated  in  MMA  and  PA  as  there  is  the  theoretical  risk  of  increasing 
intramitochondrial  accumulation  of  coenzyme  A  (CoA)  esters  and  of  further  depleting  free  CoA 
availability The mean daily dose of carglumic acid during the first 24 hours of treatment for patients in 
the FAS treated with carglumic acid + NH3 scavengers (171.2 mg/kg) and carglumic acid only (152.2 
mg/kg)  was  in  the  same  range.  Likewise,  the  median  dose  of  NH3  scavengers  (sodium 
benzoate/sodium  phenylbutyrate)  during  the  first  24  hours  of  treatment  for  patients  in  the  FAS  was 
similar  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (257.8  mg/kg  /  282.0  mg/kg)  and  the  NH3 
scavengers group (250.0 mg/kg / 277.8 mg/kg). 
Overall,  there  were  fewer  AEs  in  the  carglumic  acid  +  NH3  scavengers  group  (n  =  21)  than  in  the 
carglumic acid group (n = 61) or the NH3 scavengers group (n = 97). Most AEs/SAEs appeared related 
to the disease/condition (i.e., metabolic decompensation) rather than drug toxicity. The carglumic acid 
group  had  the  greatest  number  of  drug-related  TEAEs  (n  =  18  versus  n  =  6  in  the  carglumic  acid  + 
NH3  scavengers  group,  and  n  =  1  in  the  NH3  scavengers  group).  It  is,  however,  worthwhile  to  note 
that  the  categories  of  drug-relatedness  were  different  in  the  2  studies  and  that  relatedness  referred 
exclusively to carglumic acid in the combination treatment group. 
In  line  with  the  reasoning  of  the  MAH,  and  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  full  CSR,  this  analysis 
apparently support the efficacy and the safety of carglumic acid for the treatment of hyperammonemia 
due  to  PA,  MMA,  and  IVA.  This  exploratory  analysis  showed  that  the  reduction  of  plasma  NH3  level

occurred faster in episodes treated with carglumic acid with or without NH3 scavengers. This reduction 
was  particularly  marked  during  the 
first  hours  of  the  acute  hyperammonemic  metabolic 
decompensation,  i.e.,  when  it  is  critical  to  rapidly  decrease  plasma  NH3  levels  in  order  to  prevent 
potentially devastating neurological sequelae. 
The  presented  retrospective  pooled  analysis  of  studies  OE-CGA001-OA2009  and  OE-CGA001-OA2012 
pretend to consolidate the results of the retrospective study whose analysis has been presented earlier 
to EMA. This pooling result from US recommendation  for granting MA in the indication of Carbaglu in 
the treatment of hyperammonemia due to organic acidemias (Methyl-Malonic academia/MMA, Propionic 
Acidemia/PA, Isovaleric Acidemia/IVA). 
The pooling of retrospectively acquired data in two different time settings is prone to several bias, and 
their conclusions must be very cautious. The fact that in some studied efficacy measures there has not 
been  a  difference  between  carglumic  acid  response  and  the  other  group  also  raise  doubts  over  the 
efficacy  in  the  medium-long  term  of  Carbaglu  treatment.  Nevertheless,  in  some  patients,  Carbaglu 
appear to be efficacious in the steep control of hyperammonemia in the studied population. 
This PAM has not been a required EMA procedure. 
The data provided do not negatively impact the benefit-risk balance of Carbaglu. Therefore no further 
regulatory action is required. 
In the package submitted by the MAH, information on the characteristics of the administered product 
was not clear. The MAH was informed of this and responded with the following information: 
“In  the  context  of  the  retrospective  nature  of  the  study,  the  episodes  treated  with  carglumic 
acid were collected between 1997 and 2009. 
The information was not available for all patients/episodes. 
Out  of  66  episodes,  the  information  on  the  carglumic  acid  formulation  used  was 
available for 43 episodes: 
-  2 episodes treated with carglumic acid powder (between 1997 and 1998) 
-  41  episodes  treated  with  Carbaglu  200  mg  dispersible  tablets  (marketed  in  EU) 
(between 2002 and 2009) 
For the 23 remaining episodes treated between 2002 and 2009 the information was not 
reported on the Case Report Form.  “ 
More than 60% of the episodes occurred when under treatment with the EU formulation. The response 
was considered acceptable. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

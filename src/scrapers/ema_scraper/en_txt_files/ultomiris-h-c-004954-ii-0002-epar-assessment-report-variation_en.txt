2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS; ICD-10 classification: D58.8) is a rare, progressive, and 
life-threatening disorder characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute renal injury, 
and extra-renal complications (Muus, 2013; Noris, 2009; Sellier-Leclerc, 2007). The predominant 
underlying cause of aHUS is dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement, resulting in 
uncontrolled complement activation (Campistol, 2015; Noris, 2009; Zuber, 2012; George 2014). This 
uncontrolled complement activation causes inflammation, endothelial activation and damage, and a 
prothrombotic/procoagulant state resulting in systemic thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA; Noris, 
2009; Stahl, 2008; Karpman, 2006; Licht, 2009). Approximately 20% to 48% of patients are reported 
to have signs and symptoms of damage to extra-renal organs at presentation, including elevated liver 
or pancreatic enzymes, pericarditis, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, seizures, altered consciousness, and 
focal neurologic deficits (Loirat, 2011; Brodsky, 2015; Fidan, 2018; Fremeaux-Bacchi, 2013). In many 
cases, multiorgan dysfunction is associated with poor prognosis and necessitates critical care. This 
underscores the importance of early recognition and treatment. Complement gene mutations are 
identified in 50% to 60% of patients with aHUS (Noris, 2010; Fremeaux-Bacchi, 2013; Maga, 2010), 
although evidence of a genetic abnormality is not required for diagnosis (Noris, 2010). 
The prognosis of aHUS in the absence of complement inhibitor therapy is poor. In a nationwide study 
of French pediatric and adult patients with aHUS, 17% of children and 46% of adults progressed to 
end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or death by 1 month after clinical manifestation, and 56% of adults 
and 29% of children progressed to ESKD or death by 1 year (Fremeaux-Bacchi, 2013). More recent 
data from a large aHUS registry demonstrated that without eculizumab therapy, 31% of adult patients 
with aHUS developed ESKD within 1 year of aHUS diagnosis and required dialysis or kidney transplant 
(Schaefer, 2018). Within 6 months of aHUS diagnosis in non-eculizumab-treated patients, 25% of 
patients were on chronic dialysis, 19% had received a kidney transplant, and approximately 67% had 
incurred further manifestations of aHUS, despite the use of plasma exchange/plasma infusion in 57% 
of patients. Furthermore, extra-renal manifestations persist for some patients even 6 months after 
aHUS diagnosis, including gastrointestinal (24%), cardiovascular (17%), pulmonary (12%), and 
central nervous system (22%). In summary, without complement inhibitor therapy, aHUS can lead to 
early mortality and significant morbidities such as ESKD.

Management 
Currently, the only approved treatment for aHUS is eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody 
that specifically binds to the complement protein complement component 5 (C5) with high affinity. 
When eculizumab was approved for aHUS in 2011, it was the first treatment for life-threatening 
complement-mediated TMA events. Because the administration regimen requires every 2 week (q2w) 
intravenous (IV) infusions (every 3 weeks for patients weighing 5 kg to < 10 kg), this frequency is 
relatively burdensome for patients. Repeated IV administrations are also associated with more 
frequent infusion-related morbidities such as infusion site reactions, infection risk, and pain at the 
infusion site. 
Prior to eculizumab, treatment of aHUS was limited to plasma therapy, though its clinical benefit had 
not been established. Since the approval of eculizumab, patients with aHUS are probably no longer 
treated with long-term plasma therapy, which can transiently maintain normal levels of hematologic 
measures while the underlying complement dysregulation and thrombotic microangiopathic processes 
likely persist (Loirat, 2010). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Ravulizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to C5 and blocks its activation by 
complement pathway convertases, thereby preventing the release of the proinflammatory 
anaphylatoxin C5a and the formation of the membrane attack complex via C5b. Ravulizumab 
specifically target the identical C5 epitope motif.  
The mechanism of action of ravulizumab is entirely through binding to C5, independent of any 
secondary pathways being induced or antagonized. Ravulizumab was constructed by introducing four 
unique mutations into the heavy chain of eculizumab resulting in increased antibody half-life allowing 
administration (in the maintenance phase) once every 8 weeks (see EPAR Ultomiris). 
Ravulizumab is currently approved for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal 
hemoglobinuria (PNH) in the US and EU. 
The recommended dosing regimen for ravulizumab consists of a loading dose followed by maintenance 
dosing, administered by intravenous infusion. The doses to be administered are based on the patient’s 
body weight.  
The dose and schedule of the administration of Ultomiris is provided in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance, ravulizumab is a protein and therefore no environmental risk assessment 
studies have been submitted, in line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Product for Human Use.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the dMAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
Table 1. Listing of clinical studies 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Because the route of administration is an IV infusion and the dosage form is a solution, absorption is 
not applicable as 100% of the administered dose is considered bioavailable. The time to maximum 
observed concentration (tmax) is expected at the end of infusion (EOI); however, because of the long 
terminal elimination half-life of ravulizumab and variability, the observed tmax in clinical trials 
occurred either at or soon after EOI.

Distribution 
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) volume of distribution at steady state for patients with aHUS on 
the studied weight-based dose regimen was 5.22 (1.85) L.  
Elimination 
As an immunoglobulin G (IgG) monoclonal antibody, ravulizumab is expected to be metabolized in the 
same manner as any endogenous IgG (degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic 
pathways) and is subject to similar elimination.  
The mean (SD) values for terminal elimination half-life and clearance of ravulizumab in patients with 
aHUS are 51.8 (16.2) days and 0.08 (0.04) L/day, respectively.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Ravulizumab exhibited dose-proportional increases in the maximum observed serum concentration 
(Cmax), concentration at the end of the dosing interval (Ctrough), and area under the serum 
concentration versus time curve over the dosing interval (AUCτ) as assessed using a power model. 
Special populations 
Impact of Hepatic or Renal Insufficiency 
No impact of hepatic or renal function on ravulizumab PK was identified in the studied patients with 
aHUS; hepatic: ALT range, 7.00 to 266 U/L; AST range, 12.0 to 645 U/L; renal: eGFR range, 4.00 to 
107 mL/min/1.73 m2.  
Impact of Dialysis 
No effect of dialysis on ravulizumab PK was identified. 
Impact of sex 
The mean body weight in adult female patients was 14% lower than that those observed in adult male 
patients. The mean Cave,ss values of ravulizumab in adult female patients was 17% higher than that 
observed in adult male patients. 
Impact of race 
Despite the 19% lower body weight in adult Japanese versus non-Japanese patients (56.1 and 69.4 
kg, respectively), mean Cave,ss values of ravulizumab in adult Japanese patients were within 2% of 
those observed in non-Japanese patients. 
Impact of PNH vs aHUS 
The mean Cave,ss in patients with aHUS > 100 kg (756 μg/mL, N = 3) was 19% higher than that 
observed in patients PNH > 100 kg (634 μg/mL, N = 13).  
The mean Cave,ss in patients with aHUS ≥60 to < 100 kg (722 μg/mL, N = 30) was within 2% of that 
observed in patients PNH ≥60 to < 100 kg (735 μg/mL, N = 141). 
The mean Cave,ss in patients with aHUS ≥40 to < 60 kg (763 μg/mL, N = 22) was 13% lower than 
that observed in patients PNH ≥40 to < 60 kg (873 μg/mL, N=68). 
Assessment report

The typical CL and Vc of ravulizumab in patients with PNH were 0.00369 L/h and 3.45 L, respectively. 
The mean (SD) terminal elimination half-life of ravulizumab in 222 patients with PNH enrolled in Phase 
3 trials was 49.7 (8.94) days.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The base Pop-PK model was used to evaluate the effects of concomitantly administered drugs on 
ravulizumab PK. The impact of concomitant medications from assorted drug classes (ie, anabolic 
agents for systemic use, antithrombotic agents, antianemic preparations, antihypertensives, 
corticosteroids for systemic use, antibacterials for systemic use, antimycolitics for systemic use, and 
immunosuppressants on subject-level variability parameters of ravulizumab were assessed. The 
assessment showed that the studied concomitant drugs do not impact ravulizumab PK in patients with 
aHUS or with PNH. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No new data on the mechanism of action has been presented in this application. 
Ravulizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to complement component 5 
(C5) with high affinity, inhibiting the enzymatic cleavage of C5 into C5a (the proinflammatory 
anaphylatoxin) and C5b (the initiating subunit of the terminal complement membrane attack complex 
[C5b-9]). By binding specifically to C5, ravulizumab antagonizes terminal complement-mediated 
inflammation, cell activation, and cell lysis. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity 
Across both studies in patients with aHUS in the ravulizumab development program (Studies 
ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and ALXN1210-aHUS-312), ravulizumab exhibited a low incidence of 
immunogenicity, with 1 treatment-emergent ADA observed with a low titer (< 1), no evidence of in 
vitro neutralization, and no apparent impact of ADA on PK, PD, safety, or efficacy. This is consistent 
with the low immunogenicity seen following previously reported ravulizumab treatment. 
With only 1 transient treatment-emergent ADA positive sample observed in the aHUS Phase 3 studies, 
formal covariate testing of ADA in the Final Pop-PK model was not conducted. A preliminary visual 
assessment of the impact of ADA at baseline was completed. No trend was noted, suggesting no 
impact of ADA at baseline on ravulizumab PK. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-efficacy analysis 
Longitudinal concentrations of free C5 (semi-log scale) by study (ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and 
ALXN1210-aHUS-312) and frequency of dosing (q4w and q8w) were presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 12/111 
 
 
  
  
In adult patients, the loading dose resulted in an immediate, complete, and sustained terminal 
complement inhibition, with all free C5 concentrations below 0.5 μg/mL. Concentrations of free C5 
remained suppressed for the MDs (q8w) of ravulizumab in adult patients with aHUS. 
For pediatric patients with body weight ≥ 20 kg (q8w dosing, middle panel), the loading dose resulted 
in an immediate, complete, and sustained terminal complement inhibition, with all free C5 
concentrations below 0.5 μg/mL. Concentrations of free C5 remained suppressed for the MDs in 
pediatric patients with body weight ≥ 20 kg.  
For paediatric patients with body weight ≥ 5 to < 10 kg and ≥ 10 to < 20 kg (q4w dosing), the 
loading dose resulted in an immediate, complete, and sustained terminal complement inhibition, with 
all free C5 concentrations below 0.5 μg/mL with the exception of one patient in the ≥ 5 to < 10 kg 
group (patient with a free C5 of 0.999 μg/mL on Day 15). The free C5 on Day 15 in the second patient 
in the ≥ 5 to < 10 kg group was 0.263 μg/mL. 
 Concentrations of free C5 remained completely suppressed for the maintenance dose (q4w) in 
paediatric patients with body weight ≥ 5 to < 10 kg. 
The serum free C5 versus time profiles were characterized by immediate and complete terminal 
complement inhibition, as defined by serum free C5 < 0.5 μg/mL, that was sustained throughout the 
26-week treatment period. 
Exposure-safety analysis 
No exposure-response relationships were observed for TEAEs reported in greater than 5% of adult 
patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 or in 2 or more paediatric patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-
312 due to the small sample size (N = 14). 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has conducted two Phase 3 clinical trials (ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and ALXN1210-aHUS-312) to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of ravulizumab for atypical hemolytic 
uremic syndrome. 55 adult patients and 14 paediatric patients were recruited. The PK and PD 
modelling building, covariate assessment, model qualification and exposure-response analyses are 
considered adequate for purpose.  
A two-compartment model with a combined residual error model and inter-individual variability on CL 
and Vc succesfully described the observed data. Covariate analysis identified the effect of body weight 
(as time-varying covariate) on CL, Q, Vc and VP, the effect of transfusion on CL and the effect of BMI 
(as time-varying covariate) on Vc and Vp as statistically significant covariates. Standard model 
assessment of the base model and covariate analysis revealed the adequacy of the PK structure to 
capture the observed data. Parameter precision was assessed through the bootstrap analysis, which 
showed the concordance between parameter estimates from the final population PK model and 
bootstrap analysis. A prediction-corrected visual predictive check showed the ability of the model to 
capture the mean and the dispersion of the data during 26 weeks of treatment in the adult population. 
Pc-VPC from pediatric population were provided stratified by each dosing regimen, showing that the 
model is slightly biased for the q4w schedule (for pediatric patients with less than 20kg). Other 
covariates might be affecting the estimation of CL, but due to the low number of pediatric patients, 
their effect is difficult to estimate. No renal nor hepatic effect were identified on ravulizumab PK. The 
vast majority of patients showed severe and ESRD renal impairment and normal/mild hepatic 
impairment, which may impede its inclusion as significant covariates on CL. Differences due to sex, 
race, type of disease were less than ±20% and therefore, no clinically relevant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 13/111 
 
 
  
  
No dosing adjustments are required for patients presenting with hepatic or renal insufficiency. 
Immunogenicity was low and it did not impact the PK or PD properties of ravulizumab. 
Because ravulizumab is a monoclonal antibody, clinically meaningful drug-drug PK interactions with 
small molecule drugs or other biologics are generally not expected. The clearance pathways of 
therapeutic proteins differ from those of small molecules. The latter are usually metabolized by 
oxidation via cytochrome P450s and/or conjugation. In addition, ravulizumab does not bind to a 
cytokine and the available safety data (> 450 patient-years) have not shown a drug-induced cytokine 
modulation, indicating that the potential of drug-related cytokine-based drug interaction is negligible. 
This is consistent with clinical and post-marketing eculizumab experience. 
The exposure-efficacy relationship was assessed through longitudinal concentrations of free C5. All 
schedules (q8w and q4w) achieved an immediate, complete and sustained terminal complement 
inhibition with free C5 concentrations below 0.5 μg/mL. The PK/PD relationship of ravulizumab was 
very steep, suggesting that the trough ravulizumab concentration greater than 175µg/mL would lead 
to free C5 concentrations below 0.5 µg/mL.  
No exposure-safety relationship was established. A probability >20% of headache, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, hypertension and nausea was reported, but it was irrespective of the Cmax,ss, Ctrough,ss, 
Cave,ss and AUCss levels in adults and pediatrics.  
With regard to the PK/PD model, as the model underpredicts the exposure in paediatric patients with 
body weight less than 20kg, the proposed change to increase the loading dose (i.e. from 300 mg to 
600 mg) to reach the target concentration based on population PK model is not justified since 
observed concentrations are already higher than those predicted by the population PK model.  
The  dose  regimen  for  the  Phase  3  studies  in  patients  with  aHUS  was  based  on  pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling and the adult dosing is the same as used in the PNH studies. 
The weight-based dose regimen for ravulizumab was designed to maintain serum drug concentrations 
above  a  threshold  that  provides  complete  terminal  complement  inhibition  sustained  throughout  the 
entire dosing interval. 
The body weight-based ravulizumab treatment regimen for adult patients with aHUS is identical to the 
one approved for adult patients with PNH and includes a loading dose on Day 1, followed by maintenance 
doses on Day 15 and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter, administered by IV infusion. 
The body weight-based dosing in paediatric patients with aHUS consists of a loading dose on Day 1, 
followed  by  maintenance doses  on  Day  15  and  q8w,  for  patients  weighing ≥20  kg,  or  every  4  weeks 
(q4w), for patients weighing < 20 kg, thereafter, administered by IV infusion. 
In Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312, a planned PK/PD initial analysis of ravulizumab PK and serum free C5 
levels was conducted after 4 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve (i.e., Cohort 1) patients weighing ≥
5 kg to <40 kg completed dosing through Day 71. Based on the results of this analysis, the loading dose 
for patients weighing between ≥5 to < 10 kg was changed from 300 mg to 600 mg. 
Dosages were based on the patient’s body weight.

2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic properties of ravulizumab for atypical haemolytic uremic 
syndrome were adequately characterized in 55 adults and 14 paediatric patients through two Phase 3 
clinical trials. In general, the modelling strategy is considered acceptable and the population PK model 
was considered able to account for the ravulizumab longitudinal observations in both populations. 
Overall, the population PK and PD parameter estimates of aHUS patients were no different from that 
of PNH patients.  Currently available data are described in section 4.8 of the SmPC but no 
recommendation for treatment can be made for patients below 10 kg body weight, as reflected in 
section 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC.

Treatments 
During the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, patients received a weight-based loading dose of 
ALXN1210 IV on Day 1, followed by maintenance treatment with ALXN1210 on Day 15 and q8w 
thereafter for patients weighing ≥ 20 kg, or q4w for patients weighing < 20 kg. 
The loading and maintenance doses were based on the patient’s body weight recorded on Dose 
Regimen Decision Days. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of ALXN1210 in complement inhibitor 
treatment-naïve adolescent and adult patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to 
inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) as characterized by 
thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and renal impairment. 
The secondary objectives of the study were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To characterize the safety and tolerability of ALXN1210 in this patient population 
To evaluate the efficacy of ALXN1210 by additional efficacy measures 
To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) of ALXN1210 
To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of ALXN1210 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020

Complete TMA Response during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, as evidenced by normalization 
of hematological parameters (platelet count and LDH) and ≥ 25% improvement in serum creatinine 
from baseline. 
Patients must have met all Complete TMA Response criteria at 2 separate assessments obtained at 
least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between. To be considered a responder 
during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, the latest time point a patient could first meet the 
response criteria was 28 days before the Day 183 assessment. 
Baseline value was defined as the average of the values from the assessments performed prior to the 
first dose of study drug (ie, results from screening and the Day 1 visit). When a patient was on 
dialysis at baseline, then the first valid creatinine value used as the baseline value was the first 
assessment ≥ 6 days post dialysis. If a patient was on dialysis during the entire 26-week Initial 
Evaluation Period, then the baseline creatinine was not calculated. 
Key secondary endpoints 
- 
Time to Complete TMA Response 
-  Complete TMA Response status over time 
-  Dialysis requirement status (for patients requiring dialysis within 5 days prior to ravulizumab 
treatment initiation) 
-  Observed value and change from baseline in eGFR 
-  CKD stage, as evaluated by eGFR at select target days and classified as improved, stable (no 
change), or worsened compared to baseline 
-  Observed value and change from baseline in hematologic parameters 
- 
Increase in hemoglobin of ≥ 20 g/L from baseline 
-  Change from baseline in QoL 
Sample size 
The planned sample size of 55 patients, in order to yield at least 50 evaluable patients by Day 183, for 
Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 required more than 150 sites to be opened for enrolment to complete 
within an acceptable time frame. The sample size was increased to 55 patients to account for a 
potential 10% dropout rate.  
Randomisation 
This was an open-label study. Patients who satisfied all criteria for enrolment were assigned to study 
treatment with ravulizumab at the Baseline Visit (Day 1). The Interactive Voice/Web Response System 
(IWRS) was used to assign vials containing ravulizumab to each patient. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a single-arm, open-label study; therefore, blinding was not necessary.

Statistical methods 
Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy analyses were performed using the Full Analysis Set (FAS), the primary efficacy population.  
The primary analysis and selected secondary efficacy analyses were repeated on the PP Set as 
sensitivity analyses. 
The primary analysis consisted of estimating the proportion of complete TMA responders among 
ravulizumab-treated patients. This was performed by calculating the point estimate and a 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the proportion of complete TMA responders in ravulizumab-treated 
patients. The 95% CI was based on the asymptotic Gaussian approximation method with a continuity 
correction. 
To be considered a responder during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, the latest time point a 
patient could first meet the response criteria was 28 days before the Day 183 assessment.  
Formal statistical comparison analyses were not planned for this estimation study. 
Sensitivity Analysis 
A sensitivity analysis was prespecified in the SAP to evaluate a slightly modified version of Complete 
TMA Response. This modification applied only to the patients who were on dialysis at baseline (ie, 
patients requiring dialysis within 5 days prior to first dose of ravulizumab). For these patients, the 
criterion requiring an improvement from baseline of 25% or more in serum creatinine was replaced by 
a post-baseline change in dialysis status (from requiring dialysis at baseline to no longer requiring 
dialysis) that was maintained for at least 4 weeks. The definition of Complete TMA Response remained 
the same for all other patients. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
•  Time to Complete TMA Response: For the secondary efficacy endpoint of time to Complete 
TMA Response, Kaplan-Meier cumulative distribution curves were generated along with 2-sided 
95% CIs. The corresponding summary table presented the cumulative distribution function 
estimate, the number of patients at risk, the number of patients responding, and the number 
of patients censored at each post-baseline time point. The table also presented first quartile, 
median, and third quartile, along with corresponding 2-sided 95% CI, of time to complete 
response. 
•  Complete TMA Response Status Over Time: Complete TMA Response was summarized over 
time by presenting the number and proportion of responders along with a 2-sided 95% CI for 
each post-baseline time point. 
•  Hematologic Normalization: The number and proportion of patients who achieved hematologic 
normalization, defined as the normalization of both platelet count and LDH, was summarized 
over time with a 2-sided 95% CI for each post-baseline time point. 
•  Hematologic TMA Parameters: Hematologic TMA parameters (platelets, LDH, hemoglobin) 
were summarized at baseline and each post-baseline time point using descriptive statistics for 
continuous variables for the observed value as well as the change from baseline. A mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the fixed, categorical effect of visit and fixed, 
continuous effect of the specific test’s baseline value as covariates may have been performed 
to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point. For analysis purposes, priority 
was always given to results from the central laboratory, but if at a specific analysis visit no 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 20/111 
 
 
  
  
central lab results were available, the local lab result could be used in the analysis for the 
specific analysis visit. 
•  Hemoglobin Response: The number and proportion of patients with an increase from baseline 
in hemoglobin ≥ 20g/L, observed at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 
days) apart, and any measurement in between, was summarized over time by presenting the 
number and proportion of responders along with a 2-sided 95% CI for each post-baseline time 
point. 
•  Dialysis Requirement Status: For patients requiring dialysis within 5 days prior to ravulizumab 
treatment initiation, the proportion of patients no longer requiring dialysis was summarized 
over time. A 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion receiving dialysis was provided.  
•  eGFR Value and Change From Baseline: Kidney function evaluated by eGFR was summarized 
at baseline and each post-baseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous 
variables for the observed value as well as the change from baseline. A value of 10 
mL/min/1.73 m2 for eGFR was imputed for patients requiring dialysis for acute kidney injury. 
This summary was repeated by kidney transplant status at enrolment, and on the PP Set. 
•  An MMRM with the fixed, categorical effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the baseline 
value as covariates may have been performed to test whether changes differ from zero at 
each time point. 
•  CKD Stage: Chronic kidney disease stage was summarized over time by presenting the 
number and proportion of patients that improved (excluding those with Stage 1 at baseline as 
they cannot improve), worsened (excluding those with Stage 5 at baseline as they cannot 
worsen), and stayed the same compared to CKD stage at baseline. Stage 5 was considered 
the worst category, while Stage 1 was considered the best category. A 2-sided 95% CI for the 
proportion was provided for each category. 
Table 4: Glomerular Filtration Rate Category/Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 
•  Quality of Life: Quality of life was evaluated using the EQ-5D-3L and the FACIT-Fatigue 
version 4 Questionnaire. The EQ-5D-3L and FACIT-Fatigue data were summarized at baseline 
and each post-baseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the 
observed value as well as the change from baseline. An MMRM with the fixed, categorical 
effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the specific test’s baseline value as covariates 
may have been performed to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point. 
•  Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data: For evaluation of Complete TMA Response during the 
26-week Initial Evaluation Period (primary endpoint), patients missing an efficacy assessment 
that was part of the definition of Complete TMA Response while still on study, had their last 
observation carried forward. For patients who withdrew from the study prior to Week 26, their 
data up to the time of withdrawal was used to assess Complete TMA Response. A confirmatory

result could not be from an assessment that was carried forward from the initial assessment 
when all Complete TMA Response criteria were met. 
For laboratory data, in the event of duplicate samples from local and central laboratories (for 
any time point), central laboratory results were used for analysis.

58 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve adult patients were enrolled at 41 study sites in 14 
countries. Efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS, which was based on a modified intent-to-
treat (mITT) approach. With this approach, confirmation of eligibility in patients may have occurred 
after receiving study drug. The FAS included all patients who received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab, 
had at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment, met serum creatinine eligibility criteria, and did not 
have ADAMTS13 deficiency or Shiga toxin-related HUS. Of the 58 adult patients enrolled and treated 
with ravulizumab in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311, 56 were included in the FAS for the Initial Evaluation

Note: Patients must have met all Complete TMA Response criteria concurrently, and each criterion must have been 
met at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between. The 
proportion of Complete TMA Response was based on the responders among treated patients. The numerator was 
the number of patients achieving Complete TMA Response during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period and the 
denominator was the number of patients in the FAS. Platelet values obtained from the day of a blood transfusion of 
platelets through 3 days after the transfusion were excluded from all analyses. All serum creatinine values obtained 
while a patient was on dialysis were excluded from all analyses. If a patient was on dialysis at baseline, then the 
first valid creatinine value used as the baseline value was the first assessment ≥ 6 days post dialysis. If a patient 
was on dialysis during the entire 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, then the baseline creatinine was not calculated. 
a95% CIs for the proportion were based on the asymptotic Gaussian approximation method with a continuity 
correction. 
bHematologic normalization includes normalization of platelet count and LDH. 
In the PP Set, Complete TMA Response during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period was observed in 
22 of the 44 patients (50% [95% CI: 34.1%, 65.9%]). 
Complete TMA Response Components 
During  the  Initial  Evaluation  Period,  47  (83.9%)  patients  achieved  platelet  count  normalization,  43 
(76.8%)  patients  achieved  LDH  normalization,  and  33  (58.9%)  patients  achieved  renal  function 
improvement (defined as ≥ 25% reduction in serum creatinine from baseline). 
In addition to the 30 patients who achieved a Complete TMA Response, 19 other patients achieved 1 or 
2  of  the  Complete  TMA  Response  components,  including  11  patients  who  had  both  platelet  and  LDH 
normalization  and  3  patients  who  had  both  platelet  count  normalization  and  serum  creatinine 
improvement.

Table 11: Number of Patients Who Achieved 1 or More Components of Complete TMA Response (Full 
Analysis Set) 
Seven patients (12.5%) in the FAS did not respond on any of the 3 components of the Complete TMA 
Response during the Initial Evaluation Period. 
In the PP Set, 39 (88.6%) patients had achieved platelet count normalization, 34 (77.3%) patients had 
achieved LDH normalization, and 25 (56.8%) patients had achieved renal function improvement. 
Complete TMA Response and Complete TMA Response Components 
Complete TMA Response was observed in 31 of the 56 patients in the FAS (55.4%; 95% CI: 41.4%, 
69.3%).  In  addition  to  the  30  patients  who  achieved  Complete  TMA  Response  during  the  Initial 
Evaluation Period, 1 additional patient had confirmation of the Complete TMA Response criteria during 
the Extension Period. 
A  total  of  48  (85.7%)  patients  had  achieved  platelet  count  normalization,  44  (78.6%)  patients  had 
achieved LDH normalization, and 33 (58.9%) patients had achieved renal function improvement. 
Updated efficacy data 
As  of  the  02  Jul  2019  data  cut-off  for  the  second  interim  analysis  of  Study  ALXN1210-aHUS-311,  4 
additional  patients  had  a  Complete  TMA  Response  that  was  confirmed  after  the  26-week  Initial 
Evaluation Period (with Complete TMA Response occurring at Days 169, 302, 401, and 407), resulting 
in an overall Complete TMA Response in 34 of 56 patients (60.7%; 95% CI: 47.0%, 74.4%). Platelet 
count  normalization  increased  from  47  to  48  patients  (85.7%;  95%  CI:  75.7%,  95.8%),  LDH 
normalization  remained  at  47  patients  (83.9%;  95%  CI:  73.4%,  94.4%),  and  renal  function 
improvement increased from 33 to 35 patients (62.5%; 95% CI: 48.9%, 76.1%).

Sensitivity Analyses 
• 
Patients Who Met All Laboratory Criteria for TMA at Day 1  
A sensitivity analysis was performed for patients in the FAS who met all laboratory criteria for TMA as 
determined by the central laboratory at Day 1. Of the 30 patients who met this criteria, Complete TMA 
Response was observed in 14 patients (46.7% [95% CI: 28.3%, 65.7%]). 
•  Modified Complete TMA Response – Initial Evaluation Period 
A  separate  analysis  was  performed  using  a  modified  version  of  Complete  TMA  Response.  The 
modification  applied  strictly  to  the  patients  on  dialysis  at  baseline.  For  the  Initial  Evaluation  Period, 
modified  Complete  TMA  was  observed  in  32  of  the 56  patients  in  the  FAS  (57.1%;  95%  CI:  43.3%, 
71.0). A total of 47 (83.9%) patients had achieved platelet count normalization, 43 (76.8%) patients 
had achieved LDH normalization, and 35 (62.5%) patients had achieved renal function improvement.  
In the PP Set, modified Complete TMA Response was observed in 24 of the 44 patients during the Initial 
Evaluation Period (54.5%; 95% CI: 38.7%, 70.4%). A total of 39 (88.6%) patients had achieved platelet 
count  normalization,  34  (77.3%)  patients  had  achieved  LDH  normalization,  and  27  (61.4%)  patients 
had achieved renal function improvement. 
•  Modified Complete TMA Response 
Modified  Complete  TMA  Response  was  observed  in  33  of  the  56  patients  (58.9%;  95%  CI:  45.2%, 
72.7%) in the FAS. A total of 48 (85.7%) patients had achieved platelet count normalization, 44 (78.6%) 
patients  had  achieved  LDH  normalization,  and  35  (62.5%)  patients  had  achieved  renal  function 
improvement. 
In the PP Set, modified Complete TMA Response was observed in 25 of the 44 patients as of the data 
cutoff date (56.8%; 95% CI: 41.0%, 72.6%). A total of 40 (90.9%) patients had achieved platelet count 
normalization,  35  (79.5%)  patients  had  achieved  LDH  normalization,  and  27  (61.4%)  patients  had 
achieved renal function improvement.

Complete TMA Response was achieved at a median time of 86 days and occurred as early as 7 days 
following the first dose of ravulizumab. The latest response was observed at 169 days, which was not 
counted in the primary analysis for the Initial Evaluation Period because it was confirmed (components 
of the response maintained for at least 28 days) after the Initial Evaluation Period.

Set) 
•  Complete TMA response status over time 
The 30 patients who achieved Complete TMA Response status during the Initial Evaluation Period had 
all done so by the Day 141 visit and as early as the Day 8 visit. From the median time to Complete TMA 
Response (86 days), the proportion of responders was stable. After achieving Complete TMA Response, 
some patients had transient periods during which not all components of response continued to be met.

Of the 3 Complete TMA Response components, platelets showed the earliest response, with more than 
half of patients achieving platelet count normalization by the Day 15 visit. In general, normalization of 
LDH and renal function required a longer duration of treatment to show the same extent of improvement.

Figure  3:  Complete  TMA  Response  Components  and  Hematologic  Normalization  Status  Over  Time 
During the Initial Evaluation Period (Full Analysis Set) 
•  Hematologic Normalization 
Hematologic  normalization  included  normalization  of  platelets  and  LDH.  During  the  Initial  Evaluation 
Period, hematologic normalization was observed in 41 of 56 patients in the FAS (73.2% [95% CI: 60.7%, 
85.7%]). In the PP Set, hematologic normalization during the Initial Evaluation Period was observed in 
33 of the 44 patients (75% [95% CI: 61.1%, 88.9%]).  
As of the data cut-off date, hematologic normalization was observed in 43 of the 56 patients in the FAS 
(76.8% [95% CI: 64.8%, 88.7%]). 
•  Hematologic TMA Parameters 
Mean  platelet  count  increased  from  baseline  early  in  treatment,  and  this  mean  improvement  was 
sustained over the duration of the Initial Evaluation Period. Mean (SD) platelet count improved rapidly 
after initiation of ravulizumab treatment, increasing from 118.52 (86.440) × 109/L at baseline to 240.34 
(160.646) × 109/L at Day 8. The mean platelet count remained above 227 × 109/L at all subsequent 
visits in the Initial Evaluation Period. 
Similarly, mean LDH value decreased from baseline rapidly, with the majority of the decrease occurring 
during the first month of ravulizumab treatment; this mean reduction in LDH was sustained over the 
duration of the Initial Evaluation Period. Mean (SD) LDH value decreased from 702.38 (557.959) U/L at 
baseline to 554.31 (603.954) U/L at Day 8 and further to 293.27 (156.999) U/L at Day 29. Mean LDH 
value remained below 250 U/L at all subsequent visits in the Initial Evaluation Period. 
In contrast, mean hemoglobin value increased more gradually over time during the Initial Evaluation 
Period. Mean (SD) hemoglobin value increased from 86.26 (14.866) g/L at baseline to 91.24 (15.397) 
g/L  at  Day  15  and  113.82  (17.086)  g/L  at  Day  57,  with  mean  values  remaining  above  this  level  at 
subsequent visits in the Initial Evaluation Period.

•  Hemoglobin Response 
During the Initial Evaluation Period, 40 of the 56 patients (71.4% [95% CI: 58.7%, 84.2%]) in the FAS 
achieved  a hemoglobin  response  (ie,  increase  in  hemoglobin  of ≥20  g/L  compared  to  baseline  with  a 
confirmatory result). 
Table 14: Hemoglobin Response With a Confirmatory Result During the Initial Evaluation Period (Full 
Analysis Set) 
•  Dialysis Requirement Status 
At baseline or within 5 days prior to the first dose of study drug, 29 (51.8%) patients in the FAS had 
received renal dialysis. As of the data cut-off date, 17 (58.6%) of these 29 patients discontinued dialysis 
during the study. Of the 27 patients who did not receive dialysis within 5 days prior to their first dose 
of study drug, 20 (35.7%) patients remained off dialysis and 7 patients initiated dialysis after start of 
treatment; 6 of these 7 patients required dialysis as of the last available follow-up visit. 
•  Observed Value and Change From Baseline in eGFR 
Renal function was assessed by eGFR. Mean eGFR gradually improved during the Initial Evaluation 
Period. For patients on dialysis a value of 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 was imputed. 
Overall, the mean eGFR value at baseline was 15.86 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Table 14.2.2.9.1.1). 
Improvement was seen by Day 15 (mean: 30.63 mL/min/1.73 m2). The mean eGFR was 48.2 
mL/min/1.73 m2 by Day 85 and was 51.83 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the end of the Initial Evaluation Period 
(Day 183). 
The mean eGFR value at baseline among the 8 patients with kidney transplant was 14.81 
mL/min/1.73 m2. Similar to the overall population, improvement was seen by Day 15 (mean: 23.29 
mL/min/1.73 m2). The mean eGFR was 28.29 mL/min/1.73 m2 by Day 85 and was 29.00 
mL/min/1.73 m2 at the end of the Initial Evaluation Period (Day 183).

•  Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 
In Study ALXN1210aHUS311 most patients had CKD Stage 4 or 5 at baseline. For the 47 patients with 
available baseline and Day 183 data, 32 (68.1%) of 47 patients in the FAS had improvement in CKD 
stage compared to baseline: 6 patients improved by 5 stages (ie, from ESKD to normal renal function), 
7 patients improved by 4 stages, 5 patients improved by 3 stages, 4 patients improved by 2 stages, and 
10 patients improved by 1 stage. Two patients experienced worsening CKD stage. One of these patients  
worsened from Stage 4 at baseline to Stage 5 at Day 8, received dialysis on Day 16, and remained at 
Stage 5 for the duration of the Initial Evaluation Period. The other patient worsened from Stage 4 at 
baseline to Stage 5 at Day 8 and remained at Stage 5 for the duration of the Initial Evaluation Period 
(except for 1 assessment of Stage 4 at Day 15).  
Nineteen  of  the  30  patients  who  had  a  Complete  TMA  Response  continued  to  have  improved  renal 
function during the Initial Evaluation Period after achieving Complete TMA Response, as assessed by an 
improvement in CKD stage from the time of Complete TMA Response to Day 183.

•  Change from baseline in QoL 
FACIT-Fatigue 
At baseline, the mean (SD) FACIT-Fatigue score for the 51 patients in the FAS with available data was 
24.03 (15.279). Overall, the patients in the FAS showed improvement in FACIT-Fatigue score over time 
during  the  Initial  Evaluation  Period.  At  Day  183,  the  44  patients  with  available  data  had  a  mean 
improvement from baseline in FACIT-Fatigue score of 19.15 (16.212). 
Figure 6: Observed Values of FACIT-Fatigue Score Over time (Full Analysis Set) 
An  improvement  of  ≥ 3  points  in  FACIT-Fatigue  score,  considered  to  be  a  clinically  meaningful 
improvement  (Cella,  2002;  Webster,  2003),  was  observed  in  37  (84.1%)  of  the  44  patients  with 
available data. All of these patients had a 3-point improvement from baseline by Day 29.  
EQ-5D-3L 
At  baseline,  the  mean  (SD)  EQ-5D-3L  score  was  0.48  (0.271)  for  the  53  patients  in  the  FAS  with 
available data. Overall, patients in the FAS showed improvement in EQ-5D-3L score over time during 
the Initial Evaluation Period. At Day 183, the 46 patients with available data had a mean change from 
baseline of 0.22.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analysis 
The Complete TMA Response rate was generally consistent across subgroups compared with the overall 
population (53.6%), with the exception of the following subgroups:  
•  The  percentage  of  Asian  patients  (4/15,  26.7%)  and  patients  treated  at  sites  in  East  Asia  (4/16, 
25.0%)  who  achieved  Complete  TMA  Response  was  lower  compared  to  the  overall  population;  2/3 
patients in Australia and 2/13 patients in the rest of East Asia. 
• Patients with a history of kidney transplant had a lower percentage of patients who achieved Complete 
TMA Response (2/8, 25.0%) compared to non-transplant patients (28/48, 58.3%). 
Although not a prespecified subgroup in the protocol, it was noted that 7 of the 8 patients who entered 
the study with persistent evidence of TMA for > 3 days after childbirth achieved Complete TMA Response 
by Day 43.

serum creatinine from baseline. Patients must meet all Complete TMA Response criteria at 2 separate 
assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between. 
Key secondary endpoints 
• 
Time to Complete TMA Response (Cohort 1 only) 
•  Complete TMA Response status over time (Cohort 1 only) 
•  Dialysis requirement status 
•  Observed value and change from baseline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
•  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage, as evaluated by eGFR at select target days and classified 
as improved, stable (no change), or worsened compared to baseline 
•  Observed  value  and  change  from  baseline  in  hematologic  parameters  (platelets,  LDH, 
hemoglobin) 
• 
Increase in hemoglobin of ≥ 20 g/L from baseline, observed at 2 separate assessments obtained 
at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, and any measurement in between (Cohort 1 only) 
•  Change from baseline in quality of life (QoL), as measured by Pediatric Functional Assessment 
of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Questionnaire (patients ≥ 5 years of age) 
Sample size 
The original protocol had a planned sample size of 16 patients. The total planned sample size was 
increased to include approximately 23 to 28 patients in Amendment 5 to account for addition of 
Cohort 2 (complement-inhibitor experienced adolescent patients). The minimum number of patients 
for each age category is as follows: 
•  Birth to < 2 years: 4 patients  
•  2 to < 6 years: 4 patients 
•  6 to < 12 years: 4 patients 
•  12 to < 18 years: 8 patients 
Data will continue to be collected for a minimum of 2 additional years in order to evaluate safety, 
durability of response, and long-term benefit/risk of ravulizumab treatment.  
Randomisation.  
As the study was a single-arm study does not apply randomization. 
Blinding.  
This was a single-arm, open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The efficacy analyses were performed using the FAS, the primary efficacy population, for Cohort 1 
only. The primary analysis and selected secondary efficacy analyses were repeated on the PP Set as 
sensitivity analyses. The FAS included all patients who received at least 1 dose of ravulizumab, had at 
Assessment report

least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment, met all eligibility criteria at baseline, and did not have 
ADAMTS13 deficiency or Shiga toxin-related HUS. The PP Set included all patients in the FAS who met 
prespecified criteria 
The primary analysis consisted of estimating the proportion of complete TMA responders among 
ravulizumab-treated patients. This was performed by calculating the point estimate and a 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the proportion of complete TMA responders in ravulizumab-treated 
patients. The CI was based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
 A sensitivity analysis was prespecified in the SAP to evaluate a slightly modified version of Complete 
TMA Response. This modification applied only to the patients who were on dialysis at baseline (ie, 
patients requiring dialysis within 5 days prior to first dose of ravulizumab). For these patients, the 
criterion requiring an improvement from baseline of 25% or more in serum creatinine was replaced by 
a post-baseline change in dialysis status (from requiring dialysis at baseline to no longer requiring 
dialysis) that was maintained for at least 4 weeks. The definition of Complete TMA Response remained 
the same for all other patients. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Time to Complete TMA Response: For the secondary efficacy endpoint of time to Complete TMA 
Response, Kaplan-Meier cumulative distribution curves were generated along with 2-sided 95% CIs. 
The corresponding summary table presented the cumulative distribution function estimate, the 
number of patients at risk, the number of patients responding, and the number of patients censored at 
each post-baseline time point. The table also presented first quartile, median, and third quartile, along 
with corresponding 2-sided 95% CI, of time to complete response.  
Complete TMA Response Status Over Time: Complete TMA Response was summarized over time by 
presenting the number and proportion of responders along with a 2-sided 95% CI for each post-
baseline time point.  
Hematologic Normalization: The number and proportion of patients who achieved hematologic 
normalization, defined as the normalization of both platelet count and LDH, was summarized over time 
with a 2-sided 95% CI for each post-baseline time point.  
Hematologic TMA Parameters: Hematologic parameters (platelets, LDH, hemoglobin) were 
summarized at baseline and each post-baseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous 
variables for the observed value as well as the change from baseline. A mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM) with the fixed, categorical effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the specific 
test’s baseline value as covariates may have been performed to test whether changes differ from zero 
at each time point. 
For analysis purposes, priority was always given to results from the central laboratory, but if at a 
specific analysis visit no central lab results were available, the local lab result could be used in the 
analysis for the specific analysis visit. 
Hemoglobin Response: The number and proportion of patients with an increase from baseline in 
hemoglobin ≥ 20 g/L, observed at 2 separate assessments obtained at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart, 
and any measurement in between, were summarized over time by presenting the number and 
proportion of responders along with a 2-sided 95% CI for each post-baseline time point. 
Dialysis Requirement Status: For patients requiring dialysis within 5 days prior to ravulizumab 
treatment initiation, the proportion of patients no longer requiring dialysis was summarized over time. 
A 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion receiving dialysis was provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 44/111 
 
 
  
  
eGFR Value and Change From Baseline: Kidney function evaluated by eGFR was summarized at 
baseline and each post-baseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous variables for the 
observed value as well as the change from baseline. A value of 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 for eGFR was 
imputed for patients requiring dialysis for acute kidney injury. An MMRM with the fixed, categorical 
effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the baseline value as covariates may have been 
performed to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point. 
CKD Stage: Chronic kidney disease stage (Table 7) was summarized over time by presenting the 
number and proportion of patients that improved (excluding those with Stage 1 at baseline as they 
cannot improve), worsened (excluding those with Stage 5 at baseline as they cannot worsen), and 
stayed the same compared to CKD stage at baseline. Stage 5 was considered the worst category, 
while Stage 1 was considered the best category. A 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion was provided for 
each category. 
Table 18: Glomerular Filtration Rate Category/Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 
Quality of Life: Quality of life was assessed in patients > 5 years of age by the Pediatric FACIT-Fatigue 
Questionnaire (patient-reported for patients who were ≥ 8 years of age at the time of enrolment; 
caregiver-reported or caregiver assistance for patients who were 5 to < 8 years of age at the time of 
enrolment; see Appendix F of the study protocol in Appendix 16.1.1). The FACIT-Fatigue data was 
summarized at baseline and each post-baseline time point using descriptive statistics for continuous 
variables for the observed value as well as the change from baseline. An MMRM with the fixed, 
categorical effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the specific test’s baseline value as covariates 
may have been performed to test whether changes differ from zero at each time point. Analyses were 
performed separately for patients who were 5 to < 8 years of age at the time of enrolment (ie, 
caregiver-reported or caregiver assistance) and patients who were ≥ 8 years of age at the time of 
enrolment (ie, patient-reported). 
Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data 
For evaluation of Complete TMA Response during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period (primary 
endpoint), patients missing an efficacy assessment that was part of the definition of Complete TMA 
Response while still on study, had their last observation carried forward (LOCF). For patients who 
withdrew from the study prior to Week 26, their data up to the time of withdrawal was used to assess 
Complete TMA Response. A confirmatory result could not be from an assessment that was carried 
forward from the initial assessment when all Complete TMA Response criteria were met. 
For laboratory data, in the event of duplicate samples from local and central laboratories (for any time 
point), central laboratory results were used for analysis.

Note:  Patients  must  have  met  all  Complete  TMA  Response  criteria  at  2  separate  assessments  obtained  at  least 
4 weeks  (28 days)  apart,  and  any  measurement  in  between.  Platelet  values  obtained  from  the  day  of  a  blood 
transfusion of platelets through 3 days after the transfusion were excluded from all analyses. All serum creatinine 
values obtained while a patient was on dialysis were excluded from all analyses. When a patient was on dialysis at 
baseline,  then  the  first  valid  creatinine  value  used  as  the  baseline  value  was  the  first  assessment  ≥ 6 days  post 
dialysis. If a patient was on dialysis during the entire 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, then the baseline creatinine 
was not calculated. 
a95% CIs for the proportion were based on exact confidence limits using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
bHematologic  normalization  includes  normalization  of  platelet  count  (≥ 150 × 109/L)  and  normalization  of  LDH 
(≤ 246 U/L).  Abbreviations:  CI  =  confidence

•  Complete TMA Response Components 
With the exception of 1 patient who withdrew from the study on Day 21 after 2 doses of ravulizumab, 
all 13 patients achieved platelet count normalization during the Initial Evaluation Period. Twelve 
patients achieved LDH normalization and 11 patients achieved renal function improvement (defined as 
25% reduction in serum creatinine from baseline) during the Initial Evaluation Period. 
Among the 4 patients who did not achieve Complete TMA Response, 2 patients achieved LDH and 
platelet count normalization and 1 patient achieved platelet count normalization and renal function 
improvement during the Initial Evaluation Period. The 1 patient  who did not have improvement in any 
of the Complete TMA Response components withdrew from the study due to an AE after receiving 2 
doses of study drug.

Sensitivity Analysis 
A separate sensitivity analysis was performed using a modified version of Complete TMA Response. 
The modification applied strictly to the patients on dialysis at baseline. For the modified Complete TMA 
Response analysis, Complete TMA Response was observed in a majority of these patients (71.4% 
[95% CI: 41.9%, 91.6%]) in the FAS and PP Set.

Secondary endpoints 
• 
Time to Complete TMA Response 
The median time to Complete TMA Response during the Initial Evaluation Period was 30 days and 
occurred as early as 15 days following the first dose of ravulizumab. The latest response was observed 
at 88 days.

Analysis Set) 
•  Complete TMA Response Status Over Time 
The 10 patients who achieved the Complete TMA Response status had all done so by Day 85. Nine of 
these responders had sustained their response status from the first time point when they achieved 
Complete TMA Response through the end of the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period. One patient 
achieved a Complete TMA Response at Day 15 and continued to meet the response criteria through 
the end of the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period, except at 1 visit time point (Day 71).

Table 23: Complete TMA Response Status Over Time With a Confirmatory Result (Full Analysis Set) 
•  Complete TMA Response Components Status Over Time 
With the exception of 1 patient who withdrew from the study after 2 doses of ravulizumab, all 
remaining 13 patients in the FAS achieved platelet count normalization. Platelet count normalization 
was achieved after the first dose of study drug (ie, by Day 15) for 12 patients; 9 patients at Day 8 and 
3 patients at Day 15. The latest response was observed at Day 71 (n = 1). When platelet count 
normalization was achieved, it was sustained by all patients, with the exception of 1 patient who did 
not meet this criterion at a single time point and then platelet count normalization resumed for the 
remainder of the Initial Evaluation Period. 
Of the 12 patients who achieved LDH normalization, this was achieved by Day 15 for 4 patients. The 
latest response was observed at Day 99 (n = 1). When LDH normalization was achieved, it was 
sustained by all patients, with the exception of 2 patients who did not meet this criterion at a single 
time point (1 patient at Day 183; 1 patient transiently at Day 71 and then LDH normalization resumed 
for the remainder of the Initial Evaluation Period). 
Of the 11 patients in the FAS that achieved renal function improvement, 6 patients achieved this 
improvement after the first dose of study drug (ie, by Day 15); 5 patients by Day 8 and 1 patient by 
Day 15. The latest response was observed at Day 57 (n = 1). All of the patients that met the criteria 
for the renal function improvement component sustained this response during the Initial Evaluation 
Period.

•  Hematologic Normalization 
Hematologic normalization included normalization of platelet count and normalization of LDH. During 
the Initial Evaluation Period, hematologic normalization was observed in 12 of 14 patients (85.7% 
[95% CI: 57.2%, 98.2%]). 
•  Hematologic TMA Parameters 
Overall, patients in the FAS showed improvement in all hematologic TMA parameters (platelets, LDH, 
and hemoglobin) during the Initial Evaluation Period. Improvements in platelet count and LDH level 
began on Day 8, and improvement in hemoglobin began on Day 22: 
The mean (SD) change from baseline in platelet count was 238.08 (154.402) at Day 8 and this mean 
increase was sustained over the duration of the Initial Evaluation Period.  
The mean (SD) change from baseline in LDH was -1330.61 (952.371) at Day 8, and increased to -
2111.88 (1350.886) at Day 29, and this mean decrease was sustained over the duration of the Initial 
Evaluation Period. 
The mean (SD) change from baseline in hemoglobin was 10.79 (16.120) at Day 15, and increased to 
36.13 (21.597) at Day 43, and this mean increase was sustained over the duration of the Initial 
Evaluation Period.

Notes: Baseline value was defined as the average of the values from the assessments performed prior to the first study drug 
infusion (these could include results from screening and the Day 1 visit). Platelet values obtained from the day of a blood 
transfusion of platelets through 3 days after the transfusion were excluded from all analyses. A mixed model for repeated measures 
was used which included the fixed, categorical effect of visit and fixed, continuous effect of the baseline value as covariates. A first-
order autoregressive covariance structure was used for platelets to model the within patient errors. Time points with fewer than 5 
patients were not displayed in the figure. Observed values: mean ± 95% CI. Model-based values: mean ± 95% CI. Abbreviations:

•  Hemoglobin Response 
During the Initial Evaluation Period, 12 of the 14 patients in the FAS (85.7% [95% CI: 57.2%, 
98.2%]) had an increase in hemoglobin of ≥20 g/L compared to baseline with a confirmatory result. Of 
the 13 patients who completed the 26 weeks of ravulizumab treatment, 12 patients had a hemoglobin 
response as of Day 99.

•  Dialysis Requirement Status 
Of the 5 patients who were receiving kidney dialysis at baseline (within 5 days of the first dose of 
study drug), 4 patients discontinued dialysis after 29 days or less of exposure to ravulizumab. No new 
patients initiated dialysis after starting treatment with study drug. 
• 
e-GFR Value and Change From Baseline 
Renal function, as assessed by mean (SD) eGFR, improved from 28.4 (23.11) mL/min/1.73 m2 at 
baseline to 108 (63.21) mL/min/1.73 m2 at the end of the Initial Evaluation Period. Results from the 
MMRM statistical analysis of the change in e-GFR from baseline demonstrated improvements within 29 
days of the start of ravulizumab treatment.  
One patient had a history of kidney transplant; this patient also had an improvement in e-GFR during 
the Initial Evaluation Period compared to baseline (22 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2).

•  Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 
Per the CKD stage definitions, Stage 5 (kidney failure) was considered the worst category, while Stage 
1 (normal renal function) was considered the best category (note: 3A and 3B are counted as separate 
CKD stages). The majority of patients (11 of 14 patients) evaluated at baseline were CKD Stage 4 or 
5; 5 (35.7%) patients were CKD Stage 5. With the exception of 2 patients, all of these patients 
improved their CKD stage (ie, shifted to a lower CKD stage from baseline through the end of the Initial 
Evaluation Period (Day 183); the shift was substantial as 9 patients improved by 2 or more stages.

baseline and at least 1 value at post-baseline visits were included in the summary. Percentages were based on the 
total number of patients with non-missing data at both the baseline visit and the post-baseline visit. The CKD stage 
is classified based on the National Kidney Foundation Chronic Kidney Disease Stage. Stages of CKD:Stage 1 = 
eGFR ≥ 90 (normal); Stage 2 = eGFR 60 to 89; Stage 3A = eGFR 45 to 59; Stage 3B = eGFR 30 to 44; Stage 4 = 
eGFR 15 to 29; Stage 5: eGFR < 15 (including dialysis: end stage). a The percentages for the post-baseline CKD stage at 
Day 183 are based on the 13 patients with available data. Abbreviations: CKD = chronic kidney disease; eGFR = estimated 
glomerular filtration rate.

At the end of the Initial Evaluation Period, 11 (84.6%) of 13 patients had improvement in CKD stage 
compared to baseline. Three of these patients had improvement by 5 stages, 4 patients had 
improvement by 4 stages, 3 patients had improvement by 2 stages, and 1 patient improved by 1 
stage. Two patients had no improvement in the CKD stage during the Initial Evaluation Period. One of 
these patients had a history of kidney transplant prior to the study. None of the patients worsened in 
CKD stage during the Initial Evaluation Period.  
•  Quality of Life 
For the 8 treated patients who were > 5 years of age, QoL was assessed using the Pediatric FACIT-
Fatigue Questionnaire. During the Initial Evaluation Period, these 8 patients had a mean (SD) 
improvement in the Pediatric FACIT-Fatigue score of 18.91 (14.988) compared to baseline. Three 
(37.5%) of 8 patients had a 3-point improvement in the FACIT-Fatigue total score from baseline at 
Day 8, 7 (87.5%) patients had a 3-point improvement from baseline at Day 29, and all 8 patients had

Notes: Baseline was the Day 1 value. Pediatric FACIT-Fatigue Questionnaire was used. The Pediatric FACIT-Fatigue Questionnaire at 
baseline and each post-infusion time point was scored using standard scoring algorithms. The FACIT-Fatigue score ranged from 0 to 
52, with a higher score indicating less fatigue. Values displayed are mean ± 95% CIs. Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; 
FACIT = Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy; NO. = number.  
Updated efficacy analysis (data cut-off 16 Oct 2019) 
Cohort 1 
Complete TMA Response, the primary endpoint for the trial, was observed in 14 of the 18 naïve 
patients (77.8%) during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period. Complete TMA Response during the 
Initial Evaluation Period was achieved at a median time of 30 days (range 15 to 97 days). 
As of the 16 Oct 2019 data cutoff, 3 additional patients had a Complete TMA Response that was 
confirmed after the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period (with Complete TMA Response occurring at Days 
291, 297, and 353); thus, 17 of 18 (94.4%) pediatric patients (95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) had a 
Complete TMA Response in the trial.

Cohort 2 
As of the 16 Oct 2019 data cutoff, 10 eculizumab-experienced patients who switched to ravulizumab 
have completed the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period and entered the Extension Period, with a 
cumulative median exposure of 43.6 weeks. This cohort consists primarily of adolescent patients, with 
a mean age of 11 years. The patients in this cohort had been treated with eculizumab at the approved 
dosing regimen for at least 90 days prior to screening and had clinical evidence of response indicated 
by stable TMA parameters, which is reflected in their disease status at baseline. No patients refractory 
to eculizumab were enrolled.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This type II variation is to add a new therapeutic indication for ravulizumab in the treatment of 
patients with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-
naïve or have received eculizumab for at least 3 months and have evidence of response to 
eculizumab.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
For the support of the current application, the MAH provided results from two studies to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of ravulizumab administered by IV infusion in patients with aHUS: 
•  Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study finally 
carried out in adult patients with complement-mediated TMA including aHUS who are naïve to 
complement inhibitor treatment. 
•  Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312 is a Phase 3, single-treatment arm, multicenter study in pediatric 
patients, from birth to < 18 years of age, with confirmed diagnosis of aHUS.  
The study has 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 includes complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients; 
Cohort 2 includes eculizumab-experienced patients.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as normalization of platelet count and lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), and ≥ 25% improvement in serum creatinine from baseline (Complete TMA 
Response) during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period at 2 separate assessments 4 weeks apart. All 
serum creatinine values obtained while a patient was on dialysis were excluded from all analyses. If a 
patient was on dialysis at baseline, then the first valid creatinine value used as the baseline value was 
the first assessment ≥ 6 days post dialysis. If a patient was on dialysis during the entire 26-week 
Initial Evaluation Period, then the baseline creatinine was not calculated. 
After a 26-week Initial evaluation period, patients were allowed to enter an extension period for up to 
2 years 
Given that eculizumab is the current standard of care in this setting, a randomised controlled study 
against eculizumab would have been preferable. However, bearing in mind the low prevalence and the 
severity of the condition, the lack of a comparator arm can be considered acceptable. According to the 
MAH the sample size for a randomized, actively controlled non-inferiority study would have been at 
least twice as large (>100) and would have required twice as many sites (>300). The single-arm 
design of the Phase 3 studies was considered adequate and acceptable by the CHMP Scientific Advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/3331/2/2016/II). 
Eligibility criteria for the ravulizumab studies required patients to have evidence of TMA (including 
thrombocytopenia, evidence of haemolysis, and kidney injury) based on platelet count, LDH, and 
serum creatinine level. However, patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency and Shiga toxin-related 
haemolytic uremic syndrome, were excluded (see SmPC section 5.1). Likewise, patients with chronic 
dialysis due to ESKD or those who had received plasma exchange/plasma infusion for 28 days or 
longer for the current TMA, were also excluded. The latter could mean to exclude a population already 
studied in the eculizumab studies, defined as patients with longer term aHUS without apparent 
evidence of TMA manifestations and receiving chronic plasma exchange/plasma infusion. The main 
population studied in the ravulizumab trials can be defined as complement inhibitor treatment-naïve, 
even though in the cohort 2 of the study aHUS-312 eculizumab-experienced patients were included. 
The Applicant provided data from 10 patients with aHUS included in Cohort 2 of Study aHUS-312, who 
have been previously exposed to eculizumab. In this case patients should have received eculizumab 
for at least 3 months and have evidence of response to eculizumab prior to switching (i.e. LDH<1.5 x 
ULN and platelet count ≥150,000 /μL and eGFR>30 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
In the aHUS-311 study 58 complement inhibitor treatment-naïve adult patients were enrolled, 
however two patients were excluded from the mITT due to positive stool test results for Shiga toxin 
once all screening test results were available. Mean age at the time of first infusion was 42.2 years, 
whereas the mean age at the time of first aHUS symptoms was 41.49 years, which is representative of 
population with a reasonable short history of the disease and naïve to eculizumab treatment. At

baseline (within 5 days of the first dose of study drug), 29 (51.8%) patients received kidney dialysis 
related to kidney failure caused by aHUS, with 48 patients at CKD Stage 4 or 5. Mean baseline 
platelets, LDH and haemoglobin were 118.52 (109/L), 702.38 (U/L) and 86.26 (g/L) respectively. Eight 
patients had any kidney transplant prior to entering the study, none of them was related to aHUS, 
however baseline kidney diseases leading to ESRD in these cases is not described. 
In Study aHUS-311, testing for complement gene mutations and anticomplement antibodies was 
performed in 38 patients (66%) of whom 7 (18%) were positive for a pathogenic mutation and 3 (8%) 
were positive for an anti-complement antibody. In Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312, genetic analysis was 
performed in 10 (56%) of the 18 patients in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) from Cohort 1. Of these, 2/10 
(20%) patients were positive for a known pathogenic mutation.  
Regarding protocol amendments, during the initial evaluation period, 11 country-specific and 3 global 
protocol amendments were made in Study aHUS-311 and 4 country-specific and 1 global protocol 
amendment were made in Study aHUS-312. No relevant impact on results are expected. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Patients included in Study aHUS-311 (and also in Study aHUS-312) were allowed to receive other 
immunosuppressive therapies if they had confirmed anti-complement factor antibodies requiring 
immunosuppressive therapy. Four patients in the Study aHUS-311 and 7 patients in Study aHUS-312 
were positive for anti-complement-factor antibodies. Anti-FH positive autoimmune aHUS patient may 
respond to immunosuppressive treatment and achieve TMA remission, therefore, their presence in the 
study may represent potential bias. Of these 11 subjects, only 2 paediatric patients received 
immunosuppressive therapy (mycophenolate mofetil). Therefore, it is unlikely immunosuppressive 
therapy had an effect on the response in this study (study aHUS-312). Nearly all patients with 
autoimmune disease reached a complete TMA response. 
In the study aHUS-311, complete TMA Response was observed in 30 of the 56 patients (53.6%; 
95%CI [39.6, 67.5]) during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period. Platelet normalization, LDH 
normalization and renal function improvement were achieved in 47 (83.9%), 43 (76.8%) and 33 
(58.9%) respectively. Seven patients (12.5%) in the mITT did not respond to any of the 3 
components of the Complete TMA. One additional patient had confirmation of the Complete TMA 
Response criteria during the Extension Period. Sensitivity analyses carried out were consistent with 
the primary endpoint (PP analysis, patients who met all laboratory criteria for TMA as determined by 
the central laboratory, patients who were on dialysis at baseline and modified complete TMA response 
at the date of data cut-off).  
According to the SAP, for evaluation of Complete TMA Response during the 26-week Initial Evaluation 
Period (primary endpoint), patients missing an efficacy assessment that is part of the definition of 
Complete TMA Response while still on-study, were to have their last observation carried forward 
(LOCF). In addition, a worst-case scenario with baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) was 
submitted as sensitivity analysis and results were in line with the primary analysis. On the other hand, 
for patients discontinuing from the study prior to Week 26, their data up to the time of discontinuation 
were to be used to assess Complete TMA Response.  
The primary population analysis cannot be considered ITT, since the MAH has carried out the analysis 
through a mITT. In the Study 311 two patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis. According to 
the Applicant no efficacy data were collected for those patients that were not finally included in the 
mITT population. Median time to complete TMA response was 86 days. However, the duration of the 
response was not uniform and some patients had transient periods during which not all components of 
response continued to be met. Overall, the complete TMA response was deemed reasonably stable

(above 45% approximately) once was achieved. 17 (58.6%) out of 29 patients who were on dialysis at 
baseline, discontinued dialysis during the conduct of the trial. Regarding the improvement in CKD 
stage, 6 patients improved by 5 stages (ie, from ESKD to normal renal function), 7 patients improved 
by 4 stages, 5 patients improved by 3 stages, 4 patients improved by 2 stages, and 10 patients 
improved by 1 stage. Of the 27 patients who were not on dialysis when they entered the study, 20 
patients remained off dialysis and 7 patients initiated dialysis after start of treatment; 6 of these 7 
patients required dialysis as of the last available follow-up visit. It can be deduced that 18 patients in 
study 311 remained dialysis dependent at the time of last follow up (32.1%).  
QoL data are not interpretable due to the lack of comparator and open label design.  
In the paediatric patients (312 trial) 14 out of 16 patients initially recruited were finally included in the 
mITT (same criteria as in the Study 311). The two patients were excluded due to failure to establish 
eligibility criteria based on central laboratory confirmation (aHUS was not confirmed). These 14 
patients represent those enrolled and treated in Cohort 1 (complement inhibitor treatment-naïve 
patients). The mean age at the time of first infusion was 6.1 years, whereas the mean age at the time 
of first aHUS symptoms was 4.94 years. Mean baseline platelets, LDH and hemoglobin were 60.50 
(109/L), 2324.11 (U/L) and 74.82 (g/L) respectively. 
Complete TMA Response was achieved by 10 of 14 patients (71.4%; 95% CI: 41.9%, 91.6%) during 
the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period. 13 patients achieved platelet count normalization, 12 patients 
achieved LDH normalization and 11 patients achieved renal function improvement (defined as 25% 
reduction in serum creatinine from baseline). Sensitivity analyses were in agreement with the primary 
endpoint. For the modified Complete TMA Response analysis, Complete TMA Response was observed 
in a majority of these patients (71.4% [95% CI: 41.9%, 91.6%]) in the FAS and PP Set. Results for 
modified Complete TMA Response over time with a confirmatory result for the FAS and PP Set were 
similar to the secondary endpoint Complete TMA Response over time. The median time to complete 
TMA response was 30 days. The duration of the response was overall sustained since nine of these 
responders had sustained their response status from the first time point when they achieved Complete 
TMA Response through the end of the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period. Of the 5 patients who were 
receiving kidney dialysis at baseline (within 5 days of the first dose of study drug), 4 patients 
discontinued dialysis after 29 days or less of exposure to ravulizumab. No new patient initiated dialysis 
after starting treatment with study drug. At the end of the Initial Evaluation Period, 11 (84.6%) of 13 
patients had improvement in CKD stage compared to baseline. 
Updated efficacy data (data cut-off: 10 Oct 2019 for Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and 11 December 
2019 for Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312) were also provided. In addition, the applicant provided further 
data on 10 adolescent patients included in Study 312 up to the data cut-off date for the second 
interim analysis. Of these, there were 3 patients in Cohort 1 (treatment- naïve patients) and 7 
patients in Cohort 2 (eculizumab-experienced patients).  
In Study 311, results from the second interim analysis showed a Complete TMA response after week 
26 for 4 additional patients. In Study 312, at the data cut-off for the second interim analysis primary 
endpoint results were available for 4 additional patients from Cohort 1 (n=18). Complete TMA 
response in Cohort 1 during the initial evaluation period was of 77.8%. Moreover, 3 additional patients 
had a Complete TMA response after week 26. Overall, responses were maintained up to week 52. With 
regard to Cohort 2 (i.e. eculizumab-exposed patients), during the 26 weeks of the initial evaluation 
period TMA parameters remained stable. After week 26 parameters seem to remain stable too, 
although data are still limited. 
The submitted studies are subject to bias due to the absence of a comparator arm. To contextualise 
the data and bearing in mind the limitations of indirect comparisons, efficacy results with ravulizumab 
were compared with eculizumab efficacy data. Eculizumab obtained the MA based on the results from 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 74/111 
 
 
  
  
two different clinical studies, study C08-002A/B which enrolled adolescent and adult patients with less 
severe disease, and study C08-003A/B that enrolled adolescent and adult patients with longer term 
aHUS without apparent evidence of TMA manifestations and receiving chronic plasma 
exchange/plasma infusion (plasma sensitive). Results from studies C10-004 (an open-label, multi-
center clinical trial of eculizumab in adult patients with aHUS. performed as a post-marketing 
commitment) and C10-003 (an open-label, multi-center clinical trial of eculizumab in paediatric 
patients with aHUS) were subsequently submitted (see EPAR for Soliris).  
On observing to the complete TMA response from ravulizumab study in adults, and comparing to the 
eculizumab ones, similar percentage of responders is obtained; 30/56 (53.6%) [95%CI 39.6, 67.5] vs 
11/17 (65%) [95% CI: 38%, 86%] and 23/41 (56%) [95% CI: 40%, 72%] ALXN1210-aHUS-311 vs 
C08-002A/B and C10-004 respectively. This comparability should be carried out assuming that in the 
study C08-002A/B results could be overestimated due to smaller sample size, whereas in the study 
C10-004, where both the sample size and patients are more comparable to the ravulizumab trial in 
adults, the point estimate is closer to that obtained in the 311 study. Of note, confidence intervals are 
overlapping. Besides, populations even not totally comparable, could be considered of having similar 
baseline characteristics, such as early aHUS, adult population, thrombocytopenia, elevated LDH and 
renal impairment. On the contrary, patients in the study C08-003 were considered to be in a later 
stage, being plasma therapy sensitive as they had normal platelet count and normal LDH levels. The 
same applies to the paediatric studies, both in baseline characteristics and results in terms of 
complete TMA response.  
Ravulizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to complement component 5 
(C5) with high affinity, inhibiting the enzymatic cleavage of C5 into C5a (the proinflammatory 
anaphylatoxin) and C5b (the initiating subunit of the terminal complement membrane attack complex 
[C5b-9]) and  ravulizumab has  already demonstrated an activity comparable to the one of eculizumab 
in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH).  
Overall, ravulizumab has shown a clinically meaningful response in the adult population.  
However, according to EMEA-001943-PIP01-16-M02, in paediatric study ALXN1210-aHUS-312, the 
minimum patients number required for each age category were: at least 4 patients from birth to < 2 
years of age; at least 4 patients from 2 years to < 6 years of age; at least 4 patients from 6 years to 
< 12 years of age and at least 8 patients from 12 years to < 18 years of age. Overall, the number of 
patients in each subgroup required in the PIP is fulfilled, except for patients <2 years.  
The MAH applied for a reduction of the number of patients < 2 years of age (from 4 to 2 patients). 
However, the PDCO was of the opinion that recruitment should be kept open for at least the originally 
planned time. Additionally, PDCO deemed that it is important not to decrease the patients’ number in 
this most fragile subset, and to generate data from at least 4 patients to support a model for dosing 
confirmation in children below 2 years of age. Seven paediatric patients (6 complement inhibitor-naïve 
patients and 1 eculizumab-exposed patient) from birth to less than 2 years of age have been enrolled 
in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312. Nevertheless, of these patients only 2 were included in the original 
efficacy analysis. Moreover, the loading dose received by both patients was 300 mg (1 received only 
two doses and the other completed the initial evaluation period). Four patients (3 complement 
inhibitor-naïve patients and the eculizumab-exposed patient) were part of the FAS and Safety Set. 
Among those 4 patients, 2 complement inhibitor-naïve patients received at least one dose of 
ravulizumab, but later discontinued following a confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome 
caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli. One additional complement inhibitor-naïve patient 
was enrolled early 2020 and is undergoing the initial evaluation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 75/111 
 
 
  
  
Therefore, due to the limited data on patients below 2 years of age no recommendation on a posology 
can be made for patients below 10 kg body weight. In addition, safety data profile seems to be slightly 
worse for patients < 2 years old (see Clinical Safety section). 
It is also noted the MAH was seeking a wording of the indication in the treatment of patients with 
atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), regardless of the previous treatment with eculizumab. 
Based on the results of the 10 patients included in Cohort 2 of the Study 312 and the Phase 3 study in 
PNH (Study PNH-302) the latter could be acceptable provided that patients have been treated with 
eculizumab and are stable (i.e. LDH<1.5 x ULN and platelet count ≥150,000 /μL and eGFR>30 
mL/min/1.73 m2). However, the extrapolation of the indication to a population of patients refractory 
to eculizumab treatment is not supported, since no aHUS patients who were refractory to eculizumab-
treatment were included in Cohort 2.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall and despite the studies limitations, efficacy of ravulizumab has been shown in patients with 
atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have 
received eculizumab for at least 3 months and have evidence of response to eculizumab. Considering 
the limited efficacy and safety data in patients below 10 kg body weight, these patients are excluded 
from the indication.. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evaluation supporting the use of ravulizumab (ALXN1210) administered intravenously (IV) 
for the treatment of patients with aHUS is based on study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and study ALXN1210-
aHUS-312. 
The extent of the data consists of the Initial Evaluation Period (26 weeks) or study discontinuation for 
all patients. In addition, for adult patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 who had visits in the 
Extension Period, data up to 15 Oct 2018 were included in the clinical safety database.

Patient exposure 
Table 34: Patient Disposition in Ravulizumab Clinical Program in aHUS 
As of the data cut-off date, 74 patients (52.9 patient-years [PY] of exposure) received at least 1 dose 
of ravulizumab in the Initial Evaluation Period (58 patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and 16 
patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312), of whom 62 patients completed the Initial Evaluation Period 
(49 patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and 13 patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312) and 
continued into the Extension Period. 
Overall, the median treatment duration was 215.0 days (range: 4 to 568 days). The median treatment 
duration in adult patients in Study ALXN120-aHUS-311 was 262.5 days (range: 4 to 568 days) and 
that in paediatric patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312 was 183.0 days (range: 7 to 186 days). 
Fifty patients received the 4 planned infusions according to the protocol-specified number of infusions 
for the Initial Evaluation Period, including 1 patient who withdrew from the study on Day 163 and 2 
patients who received 5 infusions (which were reported as major protocol deviations (Study 311)

Common adverse events 
Among all patients, the most frequently reported AE was headache (33.8%; 25 patients) with an 
exposure-adjusted rate of 71.8 events/100 PY. The other AEs reported by at least 20% of all patients 
were diarrhoea (28.4%; 21 patients), vomiting (25.7%; 19 patients), hypertension (23.0%; 17 
patients), and nausea and pyrexia (20.3%; 15 patients, each).

aHUS-312 
Adverse events of special interest  
The most important risk associated with complement component 5 (C5) inhibition is increased 
susceptibility to infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis. As of the data cut-off dates, no events of 
meningococcal infections were reported in Studies ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and ALXN1210-aHUS-312. 
Serious infections 
Overall, serious infections were reported in 15 (20.3%) patients across the 2 studies. Pneumonia was 
reported by 3 (4.1%) patients and Escherichia pyelonephritis, septic shock, and urinary tract infection 
were reported by 2 (2.7%) patients, each. Most SAEs were considered not related to study drug by 
the Investigator and likely related to the underlying condition in these patients.  
Infusion reactions 
Infusion-related reaction was reported in 2 (3.4%) patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and in none 
of the patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312. These AEs did not lead to infusion interruption and 
resolved during the study. 
Seven patients experienced nonserious AEs during infusion of study drug. These AEs were 
hypertension, limb discomfort, muscle spasm, paraesthesia, dysgeusia (2 episodes in 1 patient), and 
dizziness. Hypertension in 1 patient in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312 led to interruption of the infusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 82/111 
 
 
  
  
 
for 10 minutes. The infusion was then restarted, and the full dose was completed. As of the data cut-
off date for this submission, hypertension was resolving. The other AEs did not lead to interruption of 
the infusion and resolved. 
Adverse reactions 
The most common adverse reactions associated with ravulizumab are diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, 
nasopharyngitis, and headache. The most serious adverse reactions in patients in clinical trials with 
ravulizumab are meningococcal infection and meningococcal sepsis, although neither has been 
reported in the aHUS trials as of the respective database cut-offs. 
Adverse reactions observed in clinical trials for PNH and aHUS with ravulizumab are summarized in 
Table 40. Adverse reactions reported at a very common (≥ 1/10) common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) or 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) frequency with ravulizumab are listed by System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Overall, 4 deaths were reported in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and all deaths were considered not 
related to study drug by the Investigator; no deaths were reported in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312. 
One patient died due a pre-treatment AE and 3 (5.2%) patients died due to treatment-emergent SAEs 
(2 due to septic shock and 1 due to intracranial haemorrhage). Of the 3 patients who died due to 
treatment-emergent SAEs, 2 patients died early in the treatment period, 1 on Day 4 and the other on 
Day 26. 
Serious adverse events 
Overall, 38 (51.4%) patients across the 2 studies had at least 1 SAE (exposure-adjusted rate of 158.7 
events/100 PY). In both studies, SAEs were reported most frequently in the SOC Infections and 
Assessment report

Infestations (11 [19%] adult patients and 4 [25%] paediatric patients). The most frequently reported 
SAE was hypertension (5.4%; 4 patients) with an exposure-adjusted rate of 11.3 events/100 PY). 
Hypertension was expected in this population as a consequence of renal disease. No meningococcal 
infection was reported.

ALXN1210-aHUS-312 
Laboratory findings 
No pooled analysis of clinical laboratory tests was performed. Consistent with the pathogenesis of the 
disease, at baseline, most patients had low hemoglobin levels and platelet counts, and elevated LDH, 
serum creatinine, and urine protein. 
Haematology 
In both studies, the haematology and coagulation parameters did not show clinically important changes 
over time that would suggest any safety concern or worsening of disease associated with ravulizumab 
treatment. The mean changes from baseline in hemoglobin level and platelet count showed improvement 
over time, consistent with resolution of TMA hematologic parameters. The hematology and coagulation 
parameters did not show clinically important changes over time. 
In Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312, 1 patient had Grade 3 anemia that resulted in discontinuation of study 
drug and withdrawal of the patient from the study. The SAE of anemia was considered possibly related 
to study drug by the Investigator, although as a component of TMA this anemia may also have been 
associated with the underlying condition. The anemia responded to a dose of eculizumab that was 
greater than usually administered per the label. Another patient had a non-serious Grade 4 AE of 
neutrophil count decreased. 
Chemistry 
In both studies, no clinically significant mean changes from baseline over time were observed for liver 
function test parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase). Other clinical chemistry parameters did not show 
clinically important changes over time that would suggest any safety concern or worsening of disease 
associated with ravulizumab treatment. The mean changes from baseline in serum creatinine level and 
eGFR were consistent with improvement in renal function.

Vital signs 
Blood pressure 
In Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311, overall, the mean (SD) systolic blood pressure decreased from 143.74 
(16.040)  mmHg  at  baseline  to  125.54 (16.567)  mmHg  at  Day  183  and  mean  (SD)  diastolic  blood 
pressure decreased from 82.48 (14.254) mmHg at baseline to 77.71(11.879) mmHg at Day 183. 
In Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312, overall, the mean (SD) systolic blood pressure decreased from 112.50 
(17.877) mmHg at baseline to 103.08 (8.077) mmHg at Day 183 and mean (SD) diastolic blood pressure 
decreased from 73.03 (12.990) mmHg at baseline to 61.00 (5.902) mmHg at Day 183. 
Changes from baseline in mean temperature, mean heart rate, mean respiratory rate, and mean 
oxygen saturation did not show clinically important trends over time in adult and pediatric patients 
treated with ravulizumab in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 and Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312, 
respectively. 
Immunogenicity 
In both the studies, immunogenicity assessment was performed on Day 1, Day 71, Day 127, and Day 
183 or the Early Termination Visit. In Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311, 18 (31.6%) patients were ADA 
positive at baseline (pre-treatment), while post-treatment, 2 ADA positive samples were seen. One of 
the two post-treatment ADA positive samples came from a patient with ADA positive sample at 
baseline. The titer decreased post-treatment so this was not considered a treatment-emergent ADA 
positive sample. One patient had a transient treatment-emergent ADA positive titer of < 1:1 on Day 
68. 
In Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312, 12 (75%) patients were ADA positive at baseline (pre-treatment). 
There was no ADA positive result post- ravulizumab treatment. The ADA titers were low in all 
confirmed positive baseline samples, and the positive baseline results had no apparent impact on 
safety or efficacy in these patients. 
In the aHUS clinical program (N = 74), only 1 patient in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 had treatment-
emergent ADA. This ADA was transient in nature, low titer, non-neutralizing, and did not correlate 
with clinical response or AEs. 
In total, considering PNH and aHUS studies, 2 (0.6%) patients had treatment-emergent ADA.

Adverse events leading to infusion interruption 
Overall, AEs leading to infusion interruption was reported in 1 (1.4%) patient. This patient was from 
Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312 and had non-serious Grade 2 hypertension during the second infusion 
(Day 15) that resulted in transient interruption of the infusion. The infusion was then restarted after 
10 minutes and the full dose was completed. Overall, AEs leading to infusion interruption was reported 
in 1 (1.4%) patient. There were no interruptions for subsequent infusions. The AE was considered 
unlikely related to study drug by the Investigator and was resolving as of the data cut-off date for this 
submission. There were no AEs leading to infusion interruption in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311. 
Updated safety data 
In the initial submission, the extent of the data consisted of the Initial Evaluation Period (26 weeks) or 
study discontinuation for all patients; for adult patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 who had visits 
in the Extension Period, data up to 15 Oct 2018 were included in the clinical safety database. With this 
update, safety data are available for 89 patients, 58 in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 with data through 
02 Jul 2019, and 31 in ALXN1210-aHUS-312 with data through 16 Oct 2019. 
Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 (Adult Patients)  
As of 02 Jul 2019, there were no new treatment-emergent adverse events resulting in death, study 
discontinuation, or immunogenicity in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311. There were no patients with 
meningococcal infection. The exposure-adjusted rate for SAEs decreased from 232.7 events/100 PYs 
in the first 6-month period of the study to 31.1 events/100 PYs in the second 6-month period of the 
study and 62.3 events/100 PYs beyond 12 months of treatment with ravulizumab. There were no new 
or different trends in system organ class treatment-emergent adverse events observed during the 
Extension Period.  
Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312 Cohort 1 (Pediatric Treatment-Naïve Patients)  
With the addition of 5 patients to the Cohort 1 Safety Set and additional exposure during the 
Extension Period for the patients included in the initial submission, no safety concerns were identified 
(note that 1 of these 5 patients was discontinued per protocol due to being diagnosed with STEC-HUS

following administration of 2 doses of ravulizumab and is included in the Safety Set but not the FAS). 
There were no new treatment-emergent adverse events resulting in death, study discontinuation, or 
treatment discontinuation. There were no patients with meningococcal infection, and no patients 
developed immunogenicity. There were no new or different trends in system organ class treatment-
emergent adverse events observed in Cohort 1 during the Extension Period.  
Post marketing experience 
No postmarketing data in the new indication are available as of the data cut-off date. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Ravulizumab is currently authorised for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria (PNH). The safety dataset in support of the new proposed indication for ravulizumab 
(i.e. treatment of patients with aHUS) is based mainly on data from 58 adult patients treated with 
ravulizumab in study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 (Study aHUS-311) and 16 paediatric patients included in 
study ALXN1210-aHUS-312 (Study aHUS-312). Therefore, a total of 74 patients have received at least 
one dose of ravulizumab for the treatment of aHUS. All these patients were complement inhibitor 
treatment-naïve with evidence of thrombotic microangiopathy (characterised by thrombocytopenia, 
haemolysis and kidney injury).  
Median age in the pooled population was 34.8 years (range: 0.9, 77.1), with 12% (n=9) of patients 
being 65 years or older. With regard to the paediatric population, safety data are rather limited for the 
subgroup of patients <2 years.  
Ravulizumab dosing regimen is weight-based. Median baseline body weight was 67.5 kg in adults and 
16.7 kg in paediatric patients. Adult patients with a body weight <40 kg or paediatric weighing < 5 kg 
were not allowed to enter the studies. Regarding baseline disease characteristics, 57% of patients in 
Study aHUS-311 and 37.5% in Study aHUS-312, respectively, had dialysis at baseline and 9 patients 
(8 adult patients and 1 paediatric patient) had a history of kidney transplant. Short-term (≤28 days) 
use of plasma exchange/plasma infusion was allowed. In total, 48 (82.8%) patients received prior 
plasma exchange/plasma infusion treatment.  
The studies included an initial evaluation period of 26 weeks and an extension period after week 26. 
The MAH initially provided safety data from the initial evaluation period (both studies) and of those 
patients who had a visit in the extension period (Study aHUS-311). The median treatment duration 
was of around 37.5 months in adult patients (Study aHUS-311) and of 26 weeks in paediatric patients 
(Study aHUS-312), with a median of infusions received of 6 (range: 1, 11). Nearly all patients 
reported at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). Overall, the most commonly 
reported TEAEs (≥20%) were headache (33.8%), diarrhoea (28.4%), vomiting (25.7%), hypertension 
(23.0%) and pyrexia (20.3%). TEAEs of pyrexia, nasopharyngitis and constipation were more frequent 
in the paediatric population while gastrointestinal adverse events (i.e., diarrhoea, nausea), headache 
and arthralgia were more common in adult patients. The majority of TEAEs were of grade 1 or grade 
2. TEAEs of grade 3 and grade 4 were reported by 34 (45.9%) and 15 (20.3%) patients, respectively, 
most of them in adult patients. The most commonly reported TEAEs of Grade 3 in adults were 
hypertension (7 [12%]) and urinary tract infection (5 [9%]). End stage renal disease was the only 
TEAE of Grade 4 reported in more than one patient. In Study aHUS-312, none of the TEAEs of Grade 3 
was reported in more than two patients. 
Hypertension was commonly reported in both studies (23%) and it was also one of the most common 
SAEs reported (5.4%). However, the design of these studies (i.e., single arm), does not allow to 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 92/111 
 
 
  
  
elucidate to what extent hypertension could be related to ravulizumab treatment as it may be related 
to the underlying disease. In fact, hypertension is common in patients with active TMA and 
uncontrolled complement activation. For the time being it is not possible to elucidate to what extent 
the treatment with ravulizumab could be associated with this AE (majority of adult patients with aHUS 
patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 had hypertension reported in their medical history at baseline 
and prior to treatment with ravulizumab) or on the contrary could improve it as a consequence of 
decreased vascular endothelial activation and improved kidney function (the median [range] systolic 
BP at baseline for adult aHUS patients in Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 was 140.50 mm Hg [100, 
179.5]. On Day 183, the median [range] systolic BP declined to 123.00 mm Hg [94, 173]). A similar 
trend was observed in the Study aHUS-312. 
The main risk associated to ravulizumab and C5 inhibitors in general is an increased susceptibility to 
infections caused by Neisseria sp., especially Neisseria meningitidis. Patients are required to be 
vaccinated against meningococcal infections (as described in section 4.4 of the SmPC). In studies 
aHUS-311 and aHUS-312 meningococcal infection was considered an adverse event of special interest 
(AEOSI). No events of meningococcal infections were reported up to the data cut-off in either study, 
neither infections caused by other Neisseria sp.  
Taking into account that both ravulizumab and eculizumab have the same mode of action, a similar 
safety profile is expected. Therefore, adverse events already considered of special interest for 
eculizumab were also considered of special interest for ravulizumab. Having said that, apart from 
meningococcal infections, which so far is the only important identified risk for ravulizumab, several 
adverse events have been considered important potential risks for ravulizumab (some of them 
important identified risks for eculizumab), such as serious infections, immunogenicity and severe TMA 
complications in aHUS patients after ravulizumab discontinuation.   
TMA complications have been observed following discontinuation of eculizumab treatment in patients 
with aHUS. In this sense, the following warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC of 
ravulizumab. There are no specific data on ravulizumab discontinuation. In a long-term prospective 
observational study, discontinuation of complement C5 inhibitor treatment (eculizumab) resulted in a 
13.5-fold higher rate of TMA recurrence and showed a trend toward reduced renal function compared 
to patients who continued treatment. If patients must discontinue treatment with ravulizumab, they 
should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of TMA on an on-going basis. However, 
monitoring may be insufficient to predict or prevent severe TMA complications.  If TMA complications 
occur after ravulizumab discontinuation, reinitiation of ravulizumab treatment beginning with the 
loading dose and maintenance dose should be considered. 
Moreover, Aspergillus infection and infusion reactions are important identified risk for eculizumab. 
According to the MAH no cases of Aspergillus were reported in aHUS ravulizumab studies. Regarding 
infusion related reactions, they were reported in 2 patients in study aHUS-311 and none in study 
aHUS-312. According to the MAH none of these adverse events led to infusion interruption and 
resolved during the study. With regard to serious infections, 15 (20.3%) patients (11 [19.0%] in 
study aHUS-311 and 4 [25.0%] in study aHUS-312) reported a serious infection. Serious infections 
reported in at least two patients were pneumonia (3 [4.1%]), Escherichia pyelonephritis, septic shock 
and urinary tract infection (2 [2.7%], each). There were two fatal serious adverse events of infection 
(2 shock septic adverse events in Study aHUS-311).  
Analysis of all available Extension Period data through the data cut-off date for Study 311 suggests 
that, the exposure adjusted rates for SAEs decreased over time. A similar pattern is observed in Study 
312 (the exposure-adjusted rate for SAEs decreased from 131.5 events/100 patient-years (PYs) in the 
first 6-month period of the study to 73.0 events/100 PYs in the second 6-month period of the study 
and 96.9 events/100 PYs beyond 12 months of treatment with ravulizumab). 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 93/111 
 
 
  
  
With regard to deaths, 4 patients died in study aHUS-311 and none in study aHUS-312. One of them 
died due to a pre-treatment adverse event (cerebral arterial thrombosis). The other 3 deaths occurred 
due to a TEAE (2 septic shock and 1 intracranial haemorrhage). All of the patients had severe 
comorbidities and were in bad general condition at the time of receiving the study drug and none of 
the events was considered related to study drug by the investigator. No fatal adverse events were 
reported in PNH patients treated with ravulizumab neither in aHUS patients treated with eculizumab in 
clinical trials. Although the relationship to ravulizumab cannot be fully ruled out, the underlying 
disease likely had an important contribution. However, it is known that C5 is also produced by type-II 
epithelial cells and plays role in the tissue damages caused by infective agents like Pseudomonas 
strains, which was the case in one of the deaths. However, the direct connection of the severe lung 
manifestations due to Pseudomonas infection with the ravulizumab administration is uncertain.  
Four patients required treatment discontinuation (3 adult patients and 1 paediatric patient). The 
paediatric patient was a 1-year child who discontinued study treatment on day 21 (after having 
received 2 doses of ravulizumab) due to serious adverse events of hypertensive crisis and anaemia. 
The patient had not reached complete response. TEAEs in adult patients that led to treatment 
discontinuation were autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura and 
haemorrhage intracranial.  
In the aHUS clinical program (N=74), only 1 patient in Study ALXN1210 aHUS 311 had treatment-
emergent ADA. This ADA was transient in nature, low titer, non-neutralizing, and did not correlate 
with clinical response or AEs. 
Regarding subgroup analyses, the limited sample size does not allow to obtain sound conclusions. 
Nevertheless, safety data profile seems to be slightly worse for patients < 2 years old, although data 
is very limited, only 4 patients (2 patients received 300 mg as loading dose and another 2 received 
600 mg) were included in the safety analysis. Of those 4 patients, 2 received only two doses, one due 
to SAEs (300 mg as loading dose) and another due to discontinuation by exclusion criteria (600 mg as 
loading dose). Consequently, data to support safety of ravulizumab for patients with body weight 
below 10 kg are limited. Currently available data are described in section 4.8 but no recommendation 
on a posology and treatment can be made for patients below 10 kg body weight and the indication in 
this population cannot be recommended.  
No dedicated drug-drug interaction studies were performed. Because ravulizumab, like eculizumab, is a 
monoclonal antibody, clinically meaningful drug-drug PK interactions with small molecule drugs or other 
biologics  are  generally  not  expected.  In  addition,  ravulizumab  does  not  bind  to  a  cytokine  and  the 
available  safety  data  from  patients  with  PNH  and  aHUS  (>  450  PY)  have  not  shown  a  drug-induced 
cytokine  modulation,  indicating  that  the  potential  of  drug-related  cytokine-based  drug  interaction  is 
negligible. This is consistent with clinical and postmarketing eculizumab experience. 
Updated safety data, with a longer follow-up (i.e. extension study period) from Study 311 and Cohort 
1 of Study 312 did not show any safety concern. Overall, the safety profile of ravulizumab remained 
unchanged.  
In addition, safety data from Cohort 2 of Study 312 (i.e. eculizumab-exposed patients) were provided 
and no worrisome findings were identified. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile in paediatric patients appears similar to that of adults, except for a higher 
incidence of pyrexia, nasopharyngitis and constipation in children. Serious infections were also more

frequent in paediatric patients. The main concern is the limited database, especially in regard to 
children up to two years.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC 
have been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Annex II.D has been updated 
to include the new indication in the educational materials. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which 
were reviewed by QRD and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Ultomiris. The bridging report submitted by the MAH 
has been found acceptable. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, ravulizumab is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in 
any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a very rare, serious and life-threatening disorder 
characterized by the diagnostic triad of thrombotic thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolysis 
and impaired renal function as well as other ischemic complications. Most cases of aHUS are 
secondary to mutations in genes which encode components of the alternative pathway of the 
complement cascade. Similar to observations in PNH, uncontrolled complement activation may 
contribute to the TMA process in aHUS by causing inflammation and prothrombotic activity. Patients 
with aHUS currently face a very poor prognosis with high likelihood of kidney failure, dialysis and/or 
death within one year from the time of diagnosis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Corticosteroids and plasma exchange/plasma infusion are often the initial treatment used during the 
diagnostic workup, but they have limited benefit for aHUS. The only approved therapy for aHUS is the 
C5 inhibitor eculizumab. 
Since the approval of eculizumab, patients with aHUS are probably no longer treated with long-term 
plasma therapy, which can transiently maintain normal levels of haematologic measures while the 
underlying complement dysregulation and thrombotic microangiopathic processes likely persist.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
•  Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study finally 
carried out in adult patients with complement-mediated TMA including aHUS who are naïve to 
complement inhibitor treatment. 
•  Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312 is a Phase 3, single-treatment arm, multicenter study in pediatric 
patients, from birth to < 18 years of age, with confirmed diagnosis of aHUS.  
The study has 2 cohorts: Cohort 1 includes complement inhibitor treatment-naïve patients; 
Cohort 2 includes eculizumab-experienced patients. At the time of the initial application only 
data from cohort 1 were submitted. During the procedure, data from 10 patients included in 
Cohort 2 were available and were also submitted. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study ALXN1210-aHUS-311 (adults) 
•  Complete TMA Response (primary endpoint) was observed in 30 of the 56 patients (53.6%; 
95%CI [39.6, 67.5]) during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period.  
• 
• 
Platelet normalization, LDH normalization and renal function improvement were achieved in 47 
(83.9%), 43 (76.8%) and 33 (58.9%) respectively.  
Four additional patients had a Complete TMA Response that was confirmed after the 26-week 
Initial Evaluation Period, resulting in an overall Complete TMA Response in 34 of 56 patients 
(60.7%; 95% CI: 47.0%, 74.4) 
Overall, the complete TMA response was deemed reasonably stable (above 45% approximately) once 
was achieved. 
Regarding the improvement in CKD stage, 6 patients improved by 5 stages (ie, from ESKD to normal 
renal function), 7 patients improved by 4 stages, 5 patients improved by 3 stages, 4 patients 
improved by 2 stages, and 10 patients improved by 1 stage. 
Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312 (pediatric cohort 1) 
•  Complete TMA Response, the primary endpoint for the trial, was observed in 14 of the 18 
naïve patients (77.8%) during the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period. Complete TMA Response 
during the Initial Evaluation Period was achieved at a median time of 30 days (range 15 to 97 
days). 
•  As of the 16 Oct 2019 data cut-off, 3 additional patients had a Complete TMA Response that 
was confirmed after the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period ; thus, 17 of 18 (94.4%) paediatric 
patients (95% CI: 72.7%, 99.9%) had a Complete TMA Response in the trial. 
•  18 patients achieved platelet count normalization, 18 patients achieved LDH normalization and 
18 patients achieved renal function improvement (defined as 25% reduction in serum 
creatinine from baseline). 
The duration of the response was overall sustained since 9 of these responders had sustained their 
response status from the first time point when they achieved Complete TMA Response through the 
end of the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period. 
No new patients initiated dialysis after starting treatment with study drug. At the end of the Initial 
Evaluation Period, 15 (88.2%) of 17 patients had improvement in CKD stage compared to baseline.

Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312 (pediatric cohort 2) 
As of the 16 Oct 2019 data cut-off, 10 eculizumab-experienced patients who switched to ravulizumab 
have completed the 26-week Initial Evaluation Period and entered the Extension Period, with a 
cumulative median exposure of 43.6 weeks. TMA parameters remained stable. After week 26 
parameters seem to remain stable too, although data are still limited. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The lack of comparator and limited sample size hinder the appropriate interpretation of the results. 
See discussion under Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects. 
QoL data are not interpretable due to the lack of comparator and open label design. 
In regard to the Study ALXN1210-aHUS-312, at least 4 patients <2 years old were required by the 
PDCO during the assessment of the corresponding PIP. However, data from only 2 patients were 
submitted which is considered too limited. Therefore, further efficacy data in this target population are 
deemed necessary.  
There are no data in patients previously treated with eculizimab without evidence of response to this 
drug, therefore an indication cannot be recommended for this population. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Nearly all patients reported at least one TEAE. The most commonly reported TEAEs (≥20%) in patients 
with aHUS treated with ravulizumab were headache (33.8%), diarrhoea (28.4%), vomiting (25.7%), 
hypertension (23.0%) and pyrexia (20.3%). The majority of TEAEs were of grade 1 or grade 2. TEAEs 
of grade 3 and grade 4 were reported by 34 (45.9%) and 15 (20.3%) patients, respectively. 
SAEs were reported by around 50% of patients. SAEs most commonly reported were in the infections 
and infestations SOC (20.3%). By preferred term, the most commonly reported SAE were 
hypertension (4 [5.4%]), abdominal pain and pneumonia (3 [4.1%], each). In children, the only SAE 
reported in at least two patients was abdominal pain (2 [12.5%]). 
With regard to deaths, 4 patients died in study aHUS-311 and none in study aHUS-312. The causes of 
death were a pre-treatment adverse event (cerebral arterial thrombosis) and TEAE (2 septic shock and 
1 intracranial haemorrhage). None of the events was considered related to study drug by the 
investigator.  
The main risk associated to ravulizumab is an increased susceptibility to infections caused by Neisseria 
sp., especially Neisseria meningitidis. No meningococcal infections were reported in studies aHUS-311 
and aHUS-312. 
There were four patients that required treatment discontinuation (3 adult patients and 1 paediatric 
patient). TEAEs in adult patients that led to treatment discontinuation were autoimmune haemolytic 
anaemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura and haemorrhage intracranial. In the paediatric patient, 
treatment was discontinued due to serious adverse events of hypertensive crisis and anaemia. 
Overall, the safety profile in paediatric patients appears similar to that in adults, except for a higher 
incidence of pyrexia, nasopharyngitis and constipation in children. Serious infections were also more 
frequent in paediatric patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 102/111 
 
 
  
  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Safety data are rather limited, especially for the subgroups of children up to two years. Moreover the 
safety profile of ravulizumab in this population seems to be slightly worse than for the overall 
population, therefore a posology cannot be recommended for patients of less than 10kf of weight.  
Hypertension was more commonly reported in aHUS studies compared to PNH studies. However, the 
lack of a control arm does not allow to elucidate the real contribution of ravulizumab versus the 
underlying disease.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Both studies in adults and patients have shown a clinically meaningful complete TMA response with an 
overall sustained response along the initial period of 26 weeks. Platelet normalization, LDH 
normalization and renal function improvement were achieved in the majority of patients treated with 
ravulizumab. Results are supported by the sensitivity analyses carried out. Moreover, efficacy data 
with a longer follow-up (i.e. up to week 52) suggest that response is maintained over time.  
However, the lack of comparator, even acknowledging that from a feasibility perspective (a non-
inferiority trial would need more than 300 centers and more than 100 patients) and bearing in mind 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 104/111 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
the prevalence of the disease (the annual incidence of aHUS is approximately 0.1 to 0.2 cases per 
million) it would be prohibitive, hinders to a certain extent the achievement of firm conclusions. Taking 
into account the limitations of indirect comparisons, eculizumab is the only comparator authorised in 
the same indication the MAH is applying for. Eculizumab obtained the MA based on the results from 
two different clinical studies, study C08-002A/B which enrolled adolescent and adult patients with less 
severe disease, and study C08-003A/B that enrolled adolescent and adult patients with longer term 
aHUS without apparent evidence of TMA manifestations and receiving chronic plasma 
exchange/plasma infusion (plasma sensitive). Later on, results from studies C10-004 (adults) and 
C10-003 (paediatrics) were provided.  
On observing to the complete TMA response from ravulizumab study in adults, and comparing to the 
eculizumab ones, similar percentage of responders is obtained; 30/56 (53.6%) [95%CI 39.6, 67.5] vs 
11/17 (65%) [95% CI: 38%, 86%] and 23/41 (56%) [95% CI: 40%, 72%] ALXN1210-aHUS-311 vs 
C08-002A/B and C10-004 respectively. This comparability exercise should be carried out assuming 
that in the study C08-002A/B results could be overestimated due to a smaller sample size, whereas in 
the study C10-004, where both the sample size and patients are more comparable to the ravulizumab 
trial in adults, the point estimate is closer to that obtained in the 311 study. Of note, confidence 
intervals are overlapping. Besides, populations, even not totally comparable, could be considered of 
having similar baseline characteristics, such as early aHUS, adult population, thrombocytopenia, 
elevated LDH and renal impairment. On the contrary, patients in the study C08-003 were considered 
to be in a later stage, being plasma therapy sensitive as they had normal platelet count and normal 
LDH levels. The same judgement can be applied to the paediatric studies, both in baseline 
characteristics and results in terms of complete TMA response.  
Bearing in mind that ravulizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to 
complement component 5 (C5) with high affinity, inhibiting the enzymatic cleavage of C5 into C5a 
(the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin) and C5b (the initiating subunit of the terminal complement 
membrane attack complex [C5b-9]) and the fact that based on this MoA, has been already 
demonstrated a comparable activity to eculizumab in the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal 
nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), it is accepted that efficacy has been substantiate in a certain extent 
in the adult population. 
In the paediatric population, data to support safety and efficacy of ravulizumab for patients with body 
weight below 10 kg are limited. Currently available data are described in section 4.8 of the SmPC but 
no recommendation on a posology can be made for patients below 10 kg body weight (see SmPC 
section 4.2). Further data should be provided to support the use of ravulizumab in this patient 
population. The indication is restricted to patients with a body weight of 10 kg or above (see SmPC 
section 4.1).  
Overall, the safety profile of ravulizumab in aHUS appears comparable to that observed in adult 
patients with PNH. The reported incidence of some adverse events (gastrointestinal adverse events, 
arthralgia, hypertension, anaemia, constipation and urinary tract infections) seems to be higher in 
aHUS patients, which may be partly explained by the underlying disease. Overall, the safety profile in 
paediatric patients appears similar to that of adults, apart from a higher incidence of pyrexia, 
nasopharyngitis and constipation in children. Serious infections were also more frequent in paediatric 
patients.  
The safety profile of ravulizumab seems to be slightly worse for patients < 2 years old, although data 
is very limited (only 4 patients were included in the safety analysis; of those, 2 patients received a 
loading dose of 300 mg;1 received only two doses and the other completed the initial evaluation 
period). 
Assessment report  
EMA/280465/2020 
Page 105/111 
 
 
  
  
It is also noted the MAH was seeking a wording of the indication in the treatment of patients with 
atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), regardless of the previous treatment with eculizumab. 
Based on the results of the 10 patients included in Cohort 2 of the Study 312 and the Phase 3 study in 
PNH (Study PNH-302) the latter could be acceptable provided that patients have been treated with 
eculizumab and are stable (i.e. LDH<1.5 x ULN and platelet count ≥150,000 /μL and eGFR>30 
mL/min/1.73 m2). However, the extrapolation of the indication to a population of patients refractory 
to eculizumab treatment is not supported, since no aHUS patients who were refractory to eculizumab-
treatment were included in Cohort 2.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The observed benefit outweighs the unfavourable effects of ravulizumab in the treatment of patients 
with a body weight of 10 kg or above with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) who are 
complement inhibitor treatment-naïve or have received eculizumab for at least 3 months and have 
evidence of response to eculizumab. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ultomiris (ravulizumab) in the treatment of patients with a body weight of 10 kg or 
above with atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) who are complement inhibitor treatment-
naïve or have received eculizumab for at least 3 months and have evidence of response to eculizumab 
is positive.

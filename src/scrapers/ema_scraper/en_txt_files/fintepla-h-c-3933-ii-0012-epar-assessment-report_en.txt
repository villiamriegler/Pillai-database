2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a rare, severe, paediatric-onset developmental and complex 
epileptic encephalopathy. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Fintepla is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome as an add- on therapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients 2 years of age 
and older. 
Epidemiology 
Onset of LGS occurs most commonly before the age of 11 years, with a peak between 3 and 5 years of 
age (Arzimanoglou 2009; Hancock 2013). Patients with LGS account for 5% to 10% of children with 
seizures (Panayiotopoulos 2005). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a rare, paediatric-onset condition in which the epileptic activity itself may 
directly contribute additional cognitive and behavioural impairments over those expected from the 
underlying aetiology alone and that suppression of epileptic activity might minimize this additional 
impairment” (Scheffer 2017). 
The diagnosis of LGS includes clinical signs combined with typical EEG features associated with LGS. 
The clinical presentation of LGS is heterogeneous. However, LGS is always characterized by a triad of 
symptoms: multiple seizure types, slow spike-and-wave EEG, and abnormal cognitive development. 
Tonic seizures (TS), atypical absence seizures, and “drop attacks,” ie, seizures that result in sudden 
falls, are notable in this disorder and often result in serious injury. Patients with LGS also can 
experience milder seizures that do not result in falls, as well as many other seizure types, such as 
generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTC), myoclonic seizures (MS), focal seizures, and nonconvulsive 
status epilepticus (Camfield 2011). Other comorbidities associated with LGS include speech, cognitive, 
neurobehavioral, and motor abnormalities, which are believed to be, at least in part, due to sequelae 
of repeated brain insult from poorly treated seizures. In addition to concerns about social integration 
and care, LGS is one of the most complex epileptic disorders to manage, both for the general or 
paediatric neurologist and for specialists in epilepsy (Arzimanoglou 2009). 
Nearly all patients with LGS have treatment-resistant, lifelong epilepsy. Prognosis for LGS is very poor: 
approximately 5% of patients die, 80% to 90% continue having seizures into adulthood, and most 
patients have cognitive and behavioural problems (Panayiotopoulos 2005). In the setting of rare 
complete seizure freedom, behavioural and psychiatric disorders are nearly always present, language 
is frequently affected, and mental and psychiatric disorders tend to worsen with time (Hancock 2013). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 8/121 
 
 
 
Children and adults with LGS have an enormous disruptive impact on their families, and efforts to 
improve the quality of life for these patients are complex due to the severe lifelong limitations 
associated with drug-resistant epilepsy, intellectual disability, and other comorbidities (Camfield 2014). 
Management 
Due to the heterogeneity in aetiology, pathophysiology, and type of seizures experienced by patients 
with LGS, many different treatments are currently tried (Verotti 2018), often with little success and a 
high rate of drug resistance. Due to the refractory nature of seizures in LGS, seizure freedom is an 
unlikely goal of treatment; a main objective is to improve the patient’s QoL via a compromise between 
seizure control of the most severe seizures, avoidance of additional comorbidities, and tolerability 
(Cross 2017). 
Currently, 7 antiepileptic drug (AED) products are approved for the treatment of LGS in the US: 
felbamate, topiramate, lamotrigine, rufinamide, clonazepam, clobazam (CLB), and cannabidiol (CBD). 
Nine AEDs are approved for the treatment of LGS in Europe: felbamate, topiramate, lamotrigine, 
rufinamide, clonazepam, CLB, valproate (VPA), nitrazepam, and CBD. Two AEDs are approved in Japan 
for the treatment of LGS: lamotrigine and rufinamide. Other pharmacologic (benzodiazepines, 
zonisamide) and nonpharmacologic treatments (ketogenic diet [KD], vagus nerve stimulation [VNS], 
surgery) also are prescribed based on clinical experience. 
The use of carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, tiagabine, and phenytoin in LGS is not 
recommended due to the potential risk of aggravation of drop attacks with a myoclonic component 
(Cross 2017). 
Initial treatment for LGS is usually monotherapy with 1 of the currently approved AEDs. If this is not 
successful, which is the most common case, a second agent is usually added, although some 
physicians will prescribe the second drug as monotherapy (Wheless 2007; Arzimanoglou 2009). The 
treatment of LGS frequently requires a combination of 2 or more AEDs with an individualized regimen; 
seizure control is suboptimal in most patients in the clinical population. The recommendation is to 
attempt to use drugs that have different mechanisms of action and the least amount of interaction with 
one another. After lack of response to 2 or more AEDs, nonpharmacological treatments such as KD, 
VNS, or surgery may be considered. A treatment that has been shown to be effective in certain 
common seizure types cannot be assumed to be effective in patients with LGS to treat that seizure 
type. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Fintepla is an oral solution of fenfluramine hydrochloride (HCl), under development for the treatment 
of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older. 
Fenfluramine is a racemic compound containing dexfenfluramine and levofenfluramine. The 
stereochemical configuration of the d or (+) isomer (also known as dexfenfluramine or 
dextrofenfluramine) corresponds to the S enantiomer, and the configuration of the l or (-) isomer 
(levofenfluramine) corresponds to the R enantiomer. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in the 
ZX008 drug product is fenfluramine HCl.  
Fenfluramine oral solution is approved in the United States (US), European Union (EU), and United 
Kingdom (UK) as a treatment for seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age 
and older. The approved dosage of fenfluramine is expressed in labelling as the free base (active 
moiety). Of note, during development of ZX008 (fenfluramine HCl), doses of ZX008 were expressed as 
the HCl salt in study reports and are provided as such in this submission. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 9/121 
 
 
 
The doses of fenfluramine HCl that have been evaluated in clinical studies and that are recommended 
for use are between 0.2 to 0.8 mg/kg/day administered orally as equal doses twice daily (BID), with a 
maximum total daily dose of 30 mg, regardless of weight. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
As a result of the phase II POC study of fenfluramine for the treatment of seizures associated with 
LGS, a global clinical development program was launched to evaluate ZX008 for this use. US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific advice regarding the 
design of the development program was sought.  
The ZX008 LGS clinical development program includes the following Phase 3 studies conducted in 
children and adults (2 to 35 years) with LGS: 
• Study ZX008-1601, which comprises 2 parts analysed separately: 
− Study ZX008-1601 Part 1, a Phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, efficacy and safety evaluation in subjects with LGS 
− Study ZX008-1601 Part 2, a Phase 3, open-label, long-term extension in subjects with LGS 
from Part 1 
• Study ZX008-1900, which is a Phase 3, open-label, long-term extension study in subjects with 
epileptic encephalopathies, including LGS and Dravet syndrome. 
The MAH received Protocol Assistance from the CHMP on 14 December 2017 
(EMEA/H/SA/2770/2/2017/PA/SME/II). The Protocol Assistance pertained to clinical aspects of the 
dossier 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
All studies were conducted with standard operating procedures that comply with the principles of Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP). All studies were conducted with the approval of Ethics Committees or 
Institutional Review Boards. Informed consent was obtained for all subjects participating in these 
studies. Where required, regulatory approval was obtained from the relevant health authority. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Phase I: Estimation of exposure 
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) 
A PBT screening was performed and assessed as part of the initial MAA, which did not indicate that 
fenfluramine hydrochloride presents a persistence, bioaccumulation or toxicity (PBT) risk. 
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) value for Fenfluramine Base 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 10/121 
 
 
 
The PECSURFACEWATER for fenfluramine base in EU has been calculated in the initial MAA ERA for Dravet 
syndrome to be 0.00066 μg/L.  
The following PECSURFACEWATER calculation of fenfluramine base in EU is for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: 
In Phase I, the PEC calculation is restricted to the aquatic compartment. The calculation of the PEC in 
surface water (PECSURFACEWATER) assumes that the predicted amount used per year is evenly distributed 
over the year and throughout the geographic area, the sewage system is the main route of entry, 
there is no biodegradation or retention of the drug substance in the sewage treatment plant (STP) and 
metabolism in the patient is not taken into account. Thus, the PECSURFACEWATER is only calculated for the 
drug substance. 
An Fpen default value of 0.01 (1%) is proposed in the guideline. However, because data as confirmed 
by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) are available to estimate a more accurate 
refined Fpen value in the EU for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, these data, together with EU prevalence 
data from a recent literature search (conducted August 2021), have been utilised in the calculation of 
the PECSURFACEWATER.Table 1 gives the value that has been used in the refined market penetration (Fpen) 
calculation.

Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome 
Since the indication is not linked to a specific time of the year, the predicted amount of fenfluramine 
hydrochloride used per year is assumed to be evenly distributed over the year and throughout the 
geographic area (EU Member States where drug product is to be used). 
The worst-case (highest) calculation of the PECSURFACEWATER in the EU is shown below with the values

The combined PECSURFACEWATER for fenfluramine base in EU from its use in Dravet syndrome and 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is 0.0033 µg/L. 
A Phase II environmental fate and effects analysis is not applicable in view of the low environmental 
exposure to fenfluramine base, with the PECSURFACEWATER (0.0033 μg/L) > 3 times less than the action 
limit of 0.01 μg/L. 
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted an updated ERA as a part of a new indication application for use in Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome (patients 2 years of age and older). The update consisted of a recalculation of 
PECSURFACEWATER including both indications (Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome), and led to a value 
below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L.  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the available data, the new LGS indication does not lead to a significant increase in 
environmental exposure. The use of fenfluramine hydrochloride is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
The CHMP agrees that the available non-clinical data are acceptable to support the new proposed LGS 
indication. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Syndrome 
2.3.2.  Methods 
Bioanalysis 
A validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was used for 
quantitation of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine at KCAS, USA. The method utilized liquid/liquid 
extraction with derivatization of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine. Fenfluramine-d5 and 
norfenfluramine-d6 were used as internal standards. The method had a linear range of quantitation of 
0.25 to 100 ng/mL for both analytes. 
Population PK analyses 
A previous Pop PK model was developed to describe the PK of fenfluramine and active metabolite 
norfenfluramine in patients with Dravet syndrome. A refined population PK model for 
fenfluramine/norfenfluramine identical in structure to the previous model with the lone exception being 
the estimation of the IIV in VcFEN, was used to fit the LGS data from Study 1601.  
Study 1601 is a two-part study of ZX008 in children and adults with LGS. Part 1 included two cohorts: 
Cohort A included randomized subjects from North America, Europe, and Australia while Cohort B 
included randomized subjects from Japan. Data for the Pop PK model in LGS was obtained from Part 1, 
Cohort A. Part 2 is an ongoing long-term extension study. 
A total of 250 subjects and 1920 plasma concentration records were available from the subjects 
enrolled in Cohort A of Study 1601, Part 1. Eighty-six subjects received standard-of-care treatment 
plus placebo and were excluded from the analysis dataset. A total of 4 fenfluramine concentrations 
were above the upper limit of quantification of the assay; none were BLQ. The final population PK 
dataset contained 164 subjects and 1260 concentration records (628 fenfluramine concentrations and 
632 norfenfluramine concentrations).  
The only covariates of significance in the previous Pop PK model were body weight and concomitant 
administration of stiripentol which were both included in the LGS model a priori. Concomitant 
medications received by subjects included in the population PK analysis were phenobarbital, VPA, CLB,

carbamazepine and various PPIs. Age, BMI, CLcr, sex, race, concomitant medications and indication 
(healthy subjects, DS, LGS) were evaluated as potential covariates. 
Covariate analysis utilising forward selection and backward elimination resulted in the identification of 
one statistically significant relationship between CLNFEN and CLcr. The MAH considered the impact of 
renal function on CLNFEN to be modest in the 1601 Part 1 A dataset and unlikely of clinical relevance. 
The parameter estimates of the final model are shown in Table 4 with sampling-importance-resampling 
statistics (n=1000). 
Table 4 Summary statistics of resampled population PK parametered in comparison to the 
model parameter estimates from the final population pharmacokinetic  
Based upon internal qualification diagnostics, the fit of the refined model was robust with minimal bias 
overall and the refined model was deemed qualified for estimation of exposure in the subjects with 
LGS from ZX008-1601 by the MAH.  
Estimation of exposure metrics 
Exposure metrics for Study 1601 were derived using individual predicted steady-state concentration-
time profiles for each patient generated from the PK parameter estimates obtained from the final LGS 
PK model. The predicted mean AUC, Cmax and Cmin values with descriptive statistics are presented in 
Table 5.

parameters, derived from the fit of the population PK model, stratified by dose and weight 
category for the higher dose group 
Subjects with DS enrolled in Study 1 were chosen as the comparator group as they received the same 
doses as were administered in Study 1601 and no concomitant stiripentol. The geometric mean 
exposures were lower and the estimated geometric mean apparent oral systemic clearance (CL/F) was 
higher in subjects with LGS. While it is not possible to rule out that the observed differences geometric 
mean AUC0-24, Cmax, and CL/F for fenfluramine are due to the disease state (i.e., Dravet versus 
LGS), this is considered unlikely given that both disorders are paediatric epileptic encephalopathies 
that share clinical features and therapies. The differences are likely due to the relatively small sample 
sizes in each group.

arm and study population and presented by analyte 
This hypothesis is supported by the comparison of the observed concentrations and distributions of 
fenfluramine exposures in subjects with LGS and DS (Figure 9) and by the comparability in the 
norfenfluramine exposures between the two populations, which exhibited nearly identical distributions 
and geometric means within +/- 10%.

Steady-state exposure metrics (AUC0-24, Cmax, Cmin) for fenfluramine and norfenfluramine derived 
in pediatric (≤ 18 years of age) and adult (>18 years of age) subjects with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome 
from the fit of the population pharmacokinetic model to data from Study 1601 were shown and did not 
indicate relevant differences in exposure between the two age groups. Slightly higher mean exposures 
were observed for ≤18 year at the 0.8 mg/kg dose compared to adults. 
Exposure-response analyses 
A total of 251 subjects were available for the exposure-response analyses for efficacy; 164 received 
active fenfluramine of which 84 and 80 subjects received the 0.2 or 0.8 mg/kg/day dose, respectively, 
while 87 received placebo. The majority of subjects were ≤18 years of age (77%). With few 
exceptions, all subjects included in the E-R analyses for efficacy were also available for the safety E-R 
analyses. 
The population PK model was used for the estimation of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine exposure in 
LGS subjects from Study 1601. The individual estimates of exposure were used in the E-R analyses. 
The primary PK exposures were steady-state Cmax, Cmin and AUC0-24. 
The objectives of the E-R analyses were to explore the relationship between fenfluramine and 
norfenfluramine, and the sum of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine exposure and efficacy (as measured 
by percent change in drop seizure frequency) and several endpoints of potential interest from a safety 
perspective (blood glucose concentration, platelet count, weight loss, evidence of mitral valve 
regurgitation on echocardiogram, blood pressure, and heart rate) in subjects with LGS. 
The primary component of the E-R analyses was the construction of univariable statistical models, 
which were applied to quantify potential relationships among exposure variables and outcome. For 
continuous endpoints, linear, log-linear, or non-linear regression techniques were used, as indicated by 
the exploratory graphical analyses. If necessary Emax models were attempted to relate PK exposure to 
response. For categorical outcomes, analysis of variance (ANOVA) or logistic regression models were 
applied. After the univariable screening process, multivariable models were constructed to identify all 
potential predictors of variability.

While linear and log-linear regression models to relate exposure to efficacy were attempted, none of 
the exposure metrics were significantly related to the primary efficacy endpoint, percent change in 
drop seizure frequency. Separate sigmoidal Emax models were fitted to the data using percent change 
from baseline in drop seizure frequency during T+M as the dependent variable and each of the nine PK

Blood glucose 
Based upon the scatterplots, there does not appear to be a relationship between change in blood 
glucose concentration over time and PK exposure. None of the PK exposure measures are predictive of 
maximum change in blood glucose concentration during T+M as all of the p values were ≥0.10 (Table 
9).

Platelet count 
Based upon the scatterplots, there does not appear to be a relationship between change in platelet 
count over time and PK exposure. None of the PK exposure measures are predictive of maximum 
change in platelet count during T+M as all of the p values are ≥0.14 (Table 10).

Body weight 
Univariable analyses were conducted using linear regression to assess the relationship between 
maximum percent change in body weight during T+M to the nine PK exposures. The resultant 
parameter values and goodness-of-fit (using AIC) are provided in Table 11. Overall, PK exposure is 
predictive of decreases in body weight in both linear and log2-linear regression models, regardless of 
which PK exposure is evaluated. 
Table 11 Results of linear regression models relating maximum percent change in body 
weight during T+M to various PK exposure measures 
A full, multivariable model including all covariates, was then subjected to backward selection to identify 
any significant predictors of maximum percent change in body weight during T+M. Through this 
process, it was determined that the only significant predictor of maximum percent change in body 
weight during T+M was FEN AUC0-24. Based on the intercept value of 2.46, subjects receiving placebo 
would be expected to gain 2.46 kg during T+M. The coefficient term for the model (-0.379) indicates 
that a doubling in the steady-state FEN AUC0-24 would be expected to result in a relative loss of 0.379

kg during T+M, and the adjusted r2 value of 0.0997 indicates that FEN AUC0-24 explains 
approximately 10% in the variability in maximum change in body weight during T+M.

state fenfluramine AUC0-24, with fit of the log2-linear regression model of overlaid 
Mitral regurgitation 
Across all three treatment groups, 45 of the 250 subjects (18%) had a reading of trace mitral 
regurgitation in a post-baseline ECHO. The incidence of trace mitral regurgitation was slightly higher in 
subjects randomized to placebo. There was no indication that subjects with higher exposure were more 
likely to exhibit trace mitral regurgitation. Given the lack of apparent exposure-response relationships, 
no further analyses were conducted for this outcome variable. 
Blood pressure 
Graphical displays indicated that for diastolic blood pressure, that there were no trends in the 
population overall but a suggestion of a relationship in adults in which diastolic blood pressure 
increases with increasing exposure. For systolic blood pressure, there appeared to be a trend for an 
overall decrease in systolic blood pressure with increasing exposure. However, all of the above trends 
appeared relatively weak. Univariable analyses were conducted using linear regression. None of the PK 
exposure measures were predictive of maximum absolute change in either diastolic or systolic blood 
pressure during T+M as all of the p values were ≥0.13 (Table 12).

Page 21/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 12 Results of linear regression models relating maximum absolute change in blood 
pressure during T+M to various PK exposure measures 
The multivariable models that were most predictive included FEN AUC0-24 (log2-transformed), either 
age category (for diastolic blood pressure) or age as a continuous variable (for systolic blood 
pressure), and the interaction between FEN AUC0-24 and the respective age variable. Despite 
statistical significance, neither of the models were considered informative as their adjusted r2 values 
were 0.0153 and 0.0242 for diastolic and systolic blood pressure, respectively (data not shown). These 
low r2 values indicate that the combination of age and exposure explains less than 2.5% of the 
variability in maximum absolute change in blood pressure in the study population. 
Diastolic and systolic blood pressure were also evaluated as categorical variables defines as presence 
or absence of at least two post-baseline occurrences of an absolute change from baseline of >10 mm 
Hg for diastolic blood pressure and >20 mm Hg for systolic blood pressure. FEN AUC0-24 was used as 
an independent exposure variable in a recursive partitioning analysis. When the data were split at a 
FEN AUC0-24 value of 110 (~5th percentile of active subjects), a substantial difference was seen in the 
incidence; 24% of placebo subjects and active subjects with FEN AUC0-24 <110 had elevated diastolic 
blood pressure as opposed to 34% of subjects with FEN AUC0-24 ≥110. This threshold was then tested 
using logistic regression. The coefficient for the AUC cut-off was of borderline significance p-value of 
0.0877. Recursive partitioning was also conducted to identify if there were any threshold exposure 
values above and below which the incidence of elevated systolic blood pressure was significantly 
different. No thresholds could be identified. 
Heart rate 
The majority of subjects (238 of 251 or 94.8%) had three or more heart rate observations during 
T+M. 
Graphical displays showed a slight trend for heart rate to decrease with increasing exposure in the 
pooled population and the paediatric subjects. Univariable analyses were conducted using linear 
regression. None of the PK exposure measures were predictive of maximum absolute change in heart 
rate as all of the p-values were ≥0.43 (Table 13). Results of multivariable models including potential 
effect of age were similar in that the p-values for the coefficients for all of terms in the model (i.e., 
exposure and age as continuous or categorical) were non-significant p >0.5 (data not shown).

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of fenfluramine were previously assessed in the initial MAA (for Dravet 
syndrome). In this extension of indication procedure, only part 1 of study 1601 was used to evaluate 
PK. 
Absorption 
Fenfluramine is readily and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (Marchant 1992), and 
first-pass metabolism results in an oral bioavailability in the range of 68% to 83% (Bever 1997). Peak 
plasma drug concentrations are attained within 3 to 5 hours in humans (Study 1603; ICPD Report 
00619-2; Redux US NDA 20-344; Bever 1997; Richards 1985). 
Food does not affect the Cmax, time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) or AUC of fenfluramine or 
norfenfluramine. The maximum dose of 15 mg BID of fenfluramine HCl (ie, 6 mL ZX008 oral solution) 
is fully soluble in the volume of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract over its entire pH range. Due to its high 
solubility, fenfluramine absorption is unlikely to be affected by the coadministration of agents that 
modify GI pH. 
Distribution 
Following dosing, fenfluramine is distributed throughout the body (Pinder 1975). Mean in vitro plasma 
protein binding of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine is about 50% and binding is not influenced by 
concentration. 
Elimination 
Fenfluramine is metabolized to norfenfluramine, primarily by CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6. Enzymes 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4/5 are involved to a minor extent. 
Norfenfluramine is deaminated and oxidized to inactive metabolites. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 23/121 
 
 
 
 
Over 90% of an oral dose of fenfluramine is excreted in the urine as fenfluramine, norfenfluramine, or 
other metabolites with fenfluramine and norfenfluramine accounting for less than 25% of the total; 
less than 5% is found in faeces.  
As assessed in the initial MAA and reflected in the SmPC, the geometric mean (CV%) clearance (CL/F) 
of fenfluramine is 6.9 L/h (29%) and the half-life is 20 hours following oral administration of 
fenfluramine in healthy subjects. The elimination half-life of norfenfluramine is ~30 h. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Fenfluramine PK is approximately dose proportional. 
The relationship between ZX008 dose and weight was explored by PopPK analysis including subjects 
with LGS from Study 1601. When summary statistics are compared for the subjects randomized to 
ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day with those randomized to ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day who had body weight < 37.5 
kg ie, subjects whose dose was not limited to the maximum of 30 mg/day), an approximately 4-fold 
increase in exposure is observed. This is consistent with a dose-proportional increase in exposure, 
indicating that exposures will change predictably between 0.2 mg/kg/day and 0.8 mg/kg/day when 
unconstrained by maximum daily dose. 
Special populations 
Target population 
In subjects with LGS who received ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day, up to a total maximum daily dose of 30 mg 
fenfluramine, the observed fenfluramine and norfenfluramine concentration-time profiles were similar 
and the steady-state exposures (Cmax and AUC0-24) overlapped with those in subjects with Dravet 
syndrome. Steady state systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24) of fenfluramine in subjects with LGS 
was lower on average and estimated apparent clearance (CL/F) higher than in subjects with Dravet 
syndrome.

2.3.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The combined results of binding studies, receptor functionality assays, and in vivo models previously 
reviewed suggest that fenfluramine is a selective serotonin-releasing agent and a positive modulator of 
sigma-1 receptor. Fenfluramine may reduce seizures by acting as an agonist at specific serotonin 
receptors in the brain, including the 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors, and also by acting as a 
positive modulator of the sigma-1 receptor. Fenfluramine may also act through other mechanisms not 
yet identified in reducing seizures. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
2.3.5.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response relationships for both efficacy and safety were conducted. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was identical with that which was evaluated in the clinical trials: percent change in frequency 
of seizures that result in drops. Safety endpoints were selected for evaluation of potential relationships 
with PK exposure based on medical importance, utility of knowing the relationship to exposure, and 
observed frequency in the Phase 3 clinical program sufficient to support the analyses. The endpoints 
selected included laboratory values of interest (blood glucose concentration and platelet count), 
cardiovascular endpoints (blood pressure and heart rate), weight loss, and the occurrence of mitral 
regurgitation on echocardiogram. 
Exposure-response analyses for efficacy: a statistically significant relationship was observed between 
PK exposure and percent reduction in drop seizure frequency during the T+M period. 
Exposure-response analyses for safety: There were no relationships between any of the PK exposure 
variables and cardiovascular endpoints of blood pressure or heart rate, changes in blood glucose 
concentration or platelet count and the incidence of trace mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram 
during the T+M period. 
A statistically significant relationship was observed between steady-state FEN AUC0-24 and maximum 
change in body weight during the T+M period. The relationship is relatively weak such that the mean 
predicted maximum percent change in body weight at the 90th percentile of FEN AUC0-24 (1,861 
ng•h/mL) is a decrease in body weight of only 4.12% relative to placebo. 
2.3.6.  Dose finding 
The initial rationale for the development of ZX008 for LGS was based on an ongoing Phase 2 open-
label, pilot, dose-finding study (S58545) of fenfluramine HCl as an add-on therapy to conventional 
therapy in LGS (Lagae 2018). The study includes a 20-week Core period, in which the dose of ZX008 is 
titrated to a ≥ 50% response (ie, ≥ 50% reduction in major seizure frequency) and then maintained at 
that level until the end of the period, and an Extension period of up to 15 months, in which the dose is 
titrated to achieve maximum efficacy and tolerability. 
The Core period, which was completed, was designed as a pilot dose-finding study; therefore, dose 
escalation from the starting dose of ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day stopped when a subject’s convulsive seizure 
frequency was reduced by ≥ 50% of baseline, with a maximum allowed dose of 30 mg/day. Thirteen 
subjects (9 males and 4 females) with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 11.7 (4.4) years 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 26/121 
 
 
 
(range: 3 to 17) were enrolled. All subjects received ZX008 treatment for at least 20 weeks, with the 
exception of 3 subjects, including 1 who discontinued due to both lack of efficacy and treatment-
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and 2 who discontinued due to TEAEs. For the subjects who 
completed the 20-week Core period, the seizure frequency was reduced from a median of 61 major 
seizures per month in the pre-ZX008 baseline period to a median of 22 major seizures per month at 
the end of the Core period. During the Core period, 8 of the 13 enrolled subjects (62%) had a ≥ 50% 
reduction in major seizures with ZX008 treatment, and 3 (23%) subjects had a ≥ 75% reduction. The 
median dose of ZX008 received in this period was 0.4 mg/kg/day (dose levels at which ≥ 50% 
improvement was achieved: n = 2, 0.2 mg/kg/day; n = 6, 0.4 mg/kg/day; n = 3, 0.8 mg/kg/day; n = 
2, maximum 30 mg/day). Nine of the 13 subjects completed the Core period and entered the 
Extension period. At the time of each subject’s most recent visit in the published 2018 interim analysis 
(Month 15 for 7 subjects and Month 3 for 2 subjects who discontinued), 6 of 9 subjects (67%) had a ≥ 
50% reduction in major motor seizures and 3 of 9 (33%) had a ≥ 75% seizure reduction. For the 
study as a whole, a 58% median reduction was observed in seizure frequency compared with baseline. 
At 15 months, the median dose of ZX008 was 0.4 mg/kg/day (n = 5, 0.4 mg/kg/day; n = 1, 0.8 
mg/kg/day; n = 3, maximum 30 mg/day). The most common TEAEs were decreased appetite (n = 4) 
and decreased alertness (n = 2). Sleep problems, fatigue, tiredness, and sleepiness were each 
reported in 1 subject. No valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension were observed in any 
subjects at the time of the report, nor have they been observed in this ongoing study to date. 
2.3.7.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK characteristics of fenfluramine have been defined in the initial MAA. Fenfluramine showed dose-
proportional PK across the proposed dose range and age, sex or race did not influence the exposure 
(Cmax and AUC) of fenfluramine or norfenfluramine. 
Compared to the population with Dravet syndrome studied for the initial MAA, the geometric mean 
exposures were lower and the estimated geometric mean apparent clearance from plasma after oral 
administration (CL/F) was higher in subjects with LGS with no mechanistical explanation for a 
difference caused by the disease itself. The MAH states that the differences in mean values are most 
likely due to the relatively small sample sizes in each group, which is accepted. The active metabolite 
norfenfluramine exposures are comparable between the 2 populations with distributions and geometric 
means within ± 10%.  
For evaluation of dose-response relationship, weight loss and occurrence of mitral regurgitation on 
echocardiogram were selected as safety endpoints influenced by prior experience with fenfluramine 
treatment, which had been previously marketed as an appetite suppressant but was withdrawn from 
the US and EU markets due to post-marketing reports of cardiac valve disease and pulmonary 
hypertension. There was no relationship between any of the PK exposure variables and the incidence of 
trace mitral regurgitation on echocardiogram, cardiovascular endpoints of blood pressure or heart rate, 
changes in blood glucose concentration or platelet count. A statistically significant relationship was 
observed between steady-state AUC0-24 and maximum change in body weight. Decreased appetite 
and weight loss is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC, as well as aortic or mitral valvular heart 
disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
A statistically significant relationship was observed between PK exposure and percent reduction in drop 
seizure frequency during the T+M period. 
No formal dose finding study for fenfluramine in the clinical development program was provided. 
Instead, reference was made to a prospective open-label, proof of concept study.

proposed LGS extension of indication.

Submission 
Study ZX008-1601: A Two-Part Study of ZX008 in Children and Adults with Lennox- Gastaut 
Syndrome (LGS); Part 1: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Trial of Two Fixed 
Doses of ZX008 (Fenfluramine Hydrochloride) Oral Solution as Adjunctive Therapy for 
Seizures in Children and Adults with LGS 
Methods 
Study ZX008-1601 is an international, multicenter, Phase 3 study. Part 1 is a randomized, double-
blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of 2 dose levels of 
ZX008 (fenfluramine hydrochloride) as adjunctive therapy for seizures in subjects with LGS.  
Up to approximately 80 study sites in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia were planned to 
participate. Subjects in the study are divided into 2 cohorts: Cohort A includes subjects enrolled at 
sites in North America, Europe, and Australia; Cohort B includes subjects enrolled at sites in Japan 
only. The primary analysis for the study is based on Part 1 Cohort A data. Cohort A has completed Part 
1.  
Part 1 consisted of a 4-week Baseline, 2-week Titration Period (Titration), 12-week Maintenance, and 
2-week Taper Period (Taper) or Transition Period (Transition). The 4-week Baseline consisted of the 
establishment of initial eligibility during a screening visit, followed by an observation period in which 
Assessment report

subjects were assessed for baseline seizure frequency based on recordings of daily seizure activity 
entered into a diary. 
Upon completion of Baseline, subjects who qualified for the study were randomized (1:1:1) in a 
double-blind manner to receive 1 of 2 doses of ZX008 (0.2 or 0.8 mg/kg/day [maximum dose: 30 
mg/day]) or placebo. Subjects receiving concomitant stiripentol (STP) were planned to be randomized 
to placebo or ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 20 mg/day; to be analyzed as part of the 0.8 
mg/kg/day treatment group), with the ZX008 0.5 mg/kg/day dose being based on the predicted 
increase in fenfluramine plasma concentration with concomitant STP administration. However, no 
subjects receiving STP were randomized in the study. 
Note that doses of ZX008 are expressed as the fenfluramine hydrochloride salt. The 0.2, 0.5, 
and 0.8 mg/kg/day doses are equivalent to 0.2, 0.4, and 0.7 mg/kg/day (rounded), 
respectively, of the fenfluramine free base (with a conversion factor of 0.864). The 20 and 
30 mg/day maximum doses are equivalent to 17 and 26 mg/day of fenfluramine free base.  
Randomization was stratified by weight (<37.5 kg, ≥37.5 kg) to ensure balance across treatment 
arms, with a target of at least 25% of subjects in each weight group. All subjects were titrated to their 
blinded randomized dose over the 2-week Titration. Following dose titration, subjects continued 
treatment at their randomly assigned dose over the 12-week Maintenance. Total treatment time from 
the beginning of Titration through the end of Maintenance was 14 weeks. Subjects had ECG and ECHO 
assessments midway during Maintenance (at Week 6) and at the End-of-Study (EOS) Visit (Week 14). 
At the end of Maintenance (or early discontinuation), all subjects underwent the blinded 2-week Taper 
or Transition Period (Taper/Transition) depending on whether they exited the study or were enrolled in 
Part 2, the long-term open-label extension, respectively. Follow-up ECG and ECHO were performed 3 
to 6 months after study drug discontinuation for early termination (ET), or for those subjects who 
completed the study but did not enter the open-label extension. If there were any findings at the 3-
month post-dose follow-up, a second follow-up was repeated at 6 months and then every 3 months 
until resolved or stabilized. 
Throughout the study, parents/caregivers used the diary every day to record information about 
subjects. 
Study participants 
A subject was required to meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria to be 
eligible to enroll in the study and enter Baseline, and after completion of Baseline was additionally 
required to meet the randomization criteria to be eligible for randomization. 
The study population included pediatric and adult subjects with LGS 2 to 35 years of age who had a 
diagnosis of LGS with seizures that resulted in drops not completely controlled by current antiepileptic 
treatments. Because an accurate diagnosis of LGS is difficult in children younger than 2 years, and 
seizures that result in drops may not be accurately counted in this age group, children younger than 2 
years were not included. Although seizures persist into adulthood, the primary seizure types and the 
treatment setting may differ; thus, adults older than 35 years were not included in the study. Subjects 
without a formal diagnosis could still be enrolled at Sponsor discretion if all other criteria were met. 
Subjects must have met all of the following 4 criteria for LGS, as defined in the protocol:  
a. Onset of seizures at 11 years of age or younger. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 29/121 
 
 
 
b. Multiple seizure types (must have included TS or TA), including countable motor seizures that 
resulted in drops. Countable motor seizure types eligible for inclusion were: GTC, TS, CS, AS, FS, and 
MS that resulted in a drop. 
c. Abnormal cognitive development. 
d. Evidence of electroencephalogram (EEG) in the medical history that showed abnormal background 
activity accompanied by slow spike-and-wave pattern <2.5 Hz. (Acceptable evidence included a copy 
of the EEG trace, EEG report, or physician note that appropriately described the EEG findings.) 
Subjects were required to have been receiving ≥ 1 to 4 concomitant AEDs. The ketogenic diet (KD) 
and vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) were permitted as concomitant therapies during the trial but did not 
count toward this requirement. Rescue medications for seizures were not counted towards the total 
number of AEDs. All medications or interventions for epilepsy, including KD and VNS, must have been 
stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and were expected to remain stable throughout the 
study.  
All subjects were required to have had ≥ 8 drop seizures in the 4 weeks immediately prior to Screening 
(minimum of 4 drop seizures in the first 2 weeks and 4 in the last 2 weeks before Screening) based on 
parent/guardian report or Investigator medical notes and ≥ 8 drop seizures during the 4-week Baseline 
(≥ 2 drop seizures per week) as recorded in the eDiary. Eight or more drop seizures occurring at a 
consistent frequency represents subjects with uncontrolled seizures, excludes subjects whose seizures 
only occur in clusters or who have only intermittent infrequent seizures, and provides a sufficient 
baseline from which to measure meaningful change. Seizures that result in drops were of the type 
generalized tonic-clonic (GTC), secondarily generalized tonic-clonic (SGTC), tonic (TS), atonic (AS), 
and tonic/atonic (TA) that were reviewed and confirmed as drop seizures for each subject by the 
Epilepsy Study Consortium (ESC). 
Female subjects of childbearing potential must have had a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at 
Screening. Subjects of childbearing or child-fathering potential must have been willing to use medically 
acceptable forms of birth control, which included abstinence, while receiving treatment and for 90 days 
after the last dose. 
Exclusion criteria included but were not limited to: a degenerative neurological disease as aetiology of 
seizures; history of hemiclonic seizure (HS) in the first year of life; subject with only had drop seizure 
clusters where individual seizures could not be counted reliably; an anoxic episode requiring 
resuscitation within 6 months of the Screening Visit; pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); current or 
past history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease such as cardiac valvulopathy, myocardial 
infarction or stroke, or clinically significant structural cardiac abnormality, including but not limited to 
mitral valve prolapse, atrial or ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus (note: patent 
foramen ovale or a bicuspid valve were not considered exclusionary); current or recent history of 
anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or depression within the prior year that required medical treatment or 
psychological treatment for a duration greater than 1 month; history of glaucoma; moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment (asymptomatic subjects with mild hepatic impairment, such as elevated liver 
enzymes <3 × upper limit of normal [ULN] and/or elevated bilirubin <2 × ULN, may have been 
enrolled after review and approval by the Sponsor); severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular 
filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2); concomitant therapy with centrally-acting anorectic agents, 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors, any centrally-acting compound with clinically appreciable amount of 
serotonin agonist or antagonist properties, including serotonin reuptake inhibition, other centrally-
acting noradrenergic agonists including atomoxetine, or cyproheptadine; positive result on urine or 
serum tetrahydrocannabinol panel or whole blood cannabidiol at the Screening Visit; felbamate for less 
than 1 year prior to Screening, or did not have stable liver function and hematology laboratory tests,

or the dose had not been stable for at least 60 days prior to the Screening Visit; HIV positive; active 
viral hepatitis B or C; institutionalized in a general nursing home (ie, a facility that does not provide 
skilled epilepsy care); a clinically significant condition, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
interstitial lung disease, or portal hypertension, or had clinically relevant symptoms or a clinically 
significant illness within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit other than epilepsy, that would negatively 
impact study participation, collection of study data, or pose a risk to the subject. 
Randomization Inclusion Criteria 
1. Subject had been approved for study inclusion by the ESC. 
2. Subject did not have an exclusionary cardiovascular or cardiopulmonary abnormality based on 
ECHO, ECG or physical examination and was approved for entry by the central cardiac reader. 
Exclusionary abnormalities included but were not limited to: 
a. Trace or greater mitral or aortic valve regurgitation in a subject <18 years of age 
b. Mild or greater mitral or aortic valve regurgitation in a subject >18 years of age 
c. Possible signs of pulmonary hypertension with abnormal or greater than upper range of normal 
values 
d. Evidence of left ventricular dysfunction (systolic or diastolic) 
3. Subject demonstrated a stable baseline with ≥2 seizures resulting in drops per week during the 4-
week Baseline. 
4. Subject’s parent/caregiver had been compliant with electronic diary completion during Baseline, in 
the opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor. 
Treatments 
Subjects received ZX008 or matching placebo for up to approximately 16 weeks (Titration=2 weeks; 
Maintenance=12 weeks; Taper/Transition=up to 2 weeks). 
Test Product: ZX008 was supplied as an oral solution in concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/mL. 
Subjects were randomized to receive ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day, ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg/day 
if taking STP), or placebo. The maximum dose administered was 30 mg/day (or 20 mg/day for 
subjects taking STP). Study treatment was administered orally by the caregiver twice a day (BID) in 
equal divided doses. 
Reference Product: Matching ZX008 placebo was supplied as an oral solution and dosed in the same 
manner as ZX008. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of Part 1 was the primary objective of the entire study. 
• To evaluate the effect of ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day versus placebo as adjunctive therapy for the 
treatment of uncontrolled seizures in children and adults with LGS based on the change in frequency of 
seizures that result in drops between baseline (ie, the Baseline Period [Baseline]) and the combined 
Titration + Maintenance Periods (T+M). 
Seizures that result in drops were of the type generalized tonic-clonic (GTC), secondarily generalized 
tonic-clonic (SGTC), tonic (TS), atonic (AS), and tonic/atonic (TA) that were reviewed and confirmed

as drop seizures for each subject by the Epilepsy Study Consortium (ESC). These seizures may also be 
referred to as “seizures that result in drops (ESC-confirmed),” “ESC-confirmed drop seizures,” or “drop 
seizures” for brevity. 
The key secondary objectives of Part 1 were: 
• To evaluate the effect of ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day versus placebo as adjunctive therapy for the 
treatment of uncontrolled seizures in children and adults with LGS based on the change in frequency of 
seizures that result in drops between Baseline and T+M 
• To evaluate the effect of ZX008 0.8 and 0.2 mg/kg/day (independently) versus placebo on the 
proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥50% reduction from Baseline in the frequency of seizures that 
result in drops 
• To evaluate the effect of ZX008 0.8 and 0.2 mg/kg/day (independently) versus placebo on the 
Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI-I) rating, as assessed by the Principal Investigator

Sample size 
The sample size for Part 1 Cohort A was estimated under the assumption that adding ZX008 at 0.8 
mg/kg/day to current therapy will lead to a mean decrease in drop seizures that is 30 percentage 
points greater than adding placebo to current therapy. For example, if adding placebo leads to a 10% 
decrease in seizures, then adding the high dose of ZX008 would be expected to decrease seizures by 
at least 40%. 
The variability expected in the trial was estimated from a Phase 3 trial of clobazam for patients with 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome leading to an assumption that the standard deviation (SD) is 50%. Other 
assumptions include an allowance for 20% dropouts between randomization and the start of the 
maintenance period. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 63 subjects per treatment group for a 
nonparametric analysis affords 90% power to detect a difference between the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day 
and placebo groups that is significant at the α=0.05 level. Assuming a 20% drop-out rate prior to the 
start of the maintenance period yields a requirement for an additional 14 subjects per group for a total 
of 79 subjects per treatment group for a nonparametric analysis. Similar calculations for the 0.2 
mg/kg/day ZX008 group lead to a total required sample size of 237. The number of subjects 
randomized into Part 1 Cohort A is estimated to be approximately 250 due to the long baseline period. 
Assessor’s comments 
The sample size calculations were based on the assumed mean decrease in drop seizures and dropout 
rates. The sample size calculation reflects the primary analysis, with estimated 90% power and a 
significance level of 5%. The sample size calculation is acceptable. 
Randomisation 
Upon completion of the Baseline period in Part 1, subjects who qualify for the study will be randomized 
(1:1:1) in a double-blind manner to receive 1 of 2 doses of ZX008 (0.2 mg/kg/day, 0.8 mg/kg/day; 
30mg/day maximum [0.5 mg/kg/day; 20 mg/day maximum for subjects taking concomitant STP]) or 
placebo. The randomization will be stratified by weight (<37.5 kg, ≥37.5 kg) to ensure balance across 
treatment arms, with a target of at least 25% in each weight group. Subjects will be assigned a 
randomization number by the IWR system upon confirmation that subject qualifies for enrollment in 
the Titration period. Once a randomization number is assigned to a subject, the site will record the 
subject’s initials and identification number on the corresponding study drug bottles.

Assessor’s comments 
In ZX008-1601 part 1 Cohort A, eligible subjects were randomized (1:1:1) in a double-blind manner to 
receive 1 of 2 doses of ZX008 or placebo. The randomization was stratified by weight (<37.5 kg, 
≥37.5 kg) to ensure balance across treatment arms, with a target of at least 25% in each weight 
group. The randomization procedures in part 1 are agreed upon. 
Blinding (masking) 
The blinding scheme instituted for this study will ensure that the volume of study medication taken 
cannot be associated with the dose group, thus unblinding the study. This is achieved by random 
assignment of different concentrations of the ZX008 oral solution (1.25 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, and/or 5 
mg/mL) by the IWR system. The IWR system will instruct site personnel to the volume of oral solution 
to be administered based on that subject’s weight. (Dose will be recalculated by the system based on 
weight once at the midpoint of the study.) During the Titration, Maintenance, and Taper/Transition 
periods, the subjects and study personnel (Investigators, clinical staff, personnel involved in data 
collection and analysis, the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor) will be blinded to the treatment 
allocation and to the concentration of ZX008 oral solution. If an Investigator feels the blind should be 
broken, he/she can do so when necessary for treatment decisions. However, the Investigator should 
endeavor to discuss with the 
Medical Monitor or Sponsor’s Medical Representative, if available. The blind should only be broken in 
the event the knowledge of whether the subject is on active study medication versus placebo is needed 
to determine course of medical treatment for the event. The subject will be discontinued from the 
clinical trial upon breaking of the blind and the decision whether the subject can enter Part 2 will rest 
with the Sponsor if the subject exited Part 1 prior to completion. 
Statistical methods 
T+M Period: 
The primary analysis will compare the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group to the placebo group for Cohort A 
using a two-sided test at the α=0.05 level of significance. 
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a non-parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
with treatment group (three levels; Placebo, 0.2 mg/kg/day, 0.8 mg/kg/day) and weight strata group 
(< 37.5 kg, ≥ 37.5 kg) as factors, rank of baseline DSFB as a covariate and rank of percent CDSFT+M 
as response. Treatment group mean differences from placebo will be estimated via least squares 
means from the analysis model along with 95% confidence intervals. 
Rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative, in the presence of a statistically significantly 
smaller seizure frequency for the treatment group compared to the placebo group, (two-sided p-value 
<.05) will be regarded as evidence of a treatment benefit in favor of the 0.8 mg/kg group. A similar 
comparison of the location parameter for Z008 0.2 mg/kg/day vs. placebo will be regarded as evidence 
of a treatment benefit of the 0.2 mg/kg group. This is the 3rd key secondary endpoint. 
Additional statements may be used to obtain estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals. 
A second analysis of the primary endpoint will be completed using a parametric analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with treatment group (three levels; Placebo, 0.2 mg/kg/day, 0.8 mg/kg/day) and 
weight group (<37.5 kg, ≥37.5 kg) as factors, log baseline DSFB as a covariate and log (CDSFT+M 
+1) as response. Treatment group mean differences from placebo will be estimated via least squares 
means from the analysis model along with 95% confidence intervals. Since the least square means and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 34/121 
 
 
 
confidence intervals will be on the log scale, these least square means and confidence intervals will be 
exponentiated back to the original scale. 
Additional statements may be used to obtain estimates and associated 95% confidence intervals. 
Endpoints of the confidence interval (CIs) will be translated to the original scale using the ranks. 
M Period only: 
The primary endpoint analysis described above will be repeated using data from the Maintenance 
period only as response. For subjects who did not reach the Maintenance period, their Transition period 
data will be used to represent their M period data. 
Similar non-parametric and parametric ANCOVA models will be used. 
Treatment by baseline seizure category interaction: 
Treatment by baseline seizure category interaction: The non-parametric and parametric analysis for 
the T+M and M period described above will be repeated with baseline seizure frequency as a 
categorical variable, rather than a covariate, and will include baseline seizure frequency by treatment 
Sensitivity Analyses  
Wilcoxon Rank-sum Test 
The ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group will be compared to the placebo group on the percent change from 
baseline in seizures resulting in drops using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The median difference between 
the groups, and its 95% confidence interval, will be estimated using the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. 
Impact of Antiepileptic Drugs (AED) 
Subjects in the study are required to be on stable background therapy. Using the MITT population, an 
additional nonparametric ANCOVA analysis will be performed to assess the impact on the primary 
analysis of changes in dose or type of concomitant AED, which are protocol violations that may occur 
during the course of the study. 
For this analysis, each subject will be classified according to the number of concomitant AEDs used 
during the T+M period. Fisher’s exact tests will be used to compare the active dose groups with the 
placebo group on the percentage of subjects within each group who have a change in concomitant 
AEDs. 
Per protocol Analysis 
The primary efficacy ANCOVA will be repeated on the per protocol population (which excludes subjects 
with important protocol deviations that may affect the inference on efficacy such as a change in dose 
or type of concomitant AED). 
No Imputation for Seizure Clusters 
The primary efficacy ANCOVA will be repeated on the mITT population with no imputation for seizure 
clusters; i.e., seizure clusters will not be calculated in the frequency of seizures that result in drops. 
Exclusion of Outliers 
The distribution of the primary endpoint is inherently asymmetric since no subject can have more than 
a 100% decrease in seizures, but there is no reason a subject couldn’t have a 200% or even 1000% 
increase. In fact, there is no theoretical upper bound to the possible magnitude of an increase in a 
percent change statistic. To assess the sensitivity of the primary analysis to extreme outliers in percent 
change in drop seizure frequency, the primary analysis will be repeated excluding any PCDSF value 
that satisfies Tukey’s criterion for a “far out” outlier (Tukey, 1977).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 35/121 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Imputation for Dropouts 
Two different methods for imputation of missing values due to subject drop out will be incorporated 
into the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. When referring to frequency in the paragraphs 
below, it refers to the number of seizure events per 28 days. 
S1: Worst value substituted: In this analysis, for a subject who drops out of treatment, if the drop 
seizure frequency during T+M is lower than the baseline value, the baseline value will be substituted 
for the subject from the point of withdrawal to the end of the planned duration of T+M. However, if the 
seizure frequency during T+M is higher than the baseline value, there will be no substitution. The DSF 
for the planned duration of T+M will then be computed as a weighted mean of the value before 
dropout, and the imputed value after dropout. The weights will be the proportion of planned duration 
of T+M before and after dropout. The statistical analysis (nonparametric ANCOVA) described at the 
start of section 8.2.2 will then be performed on the resulting dataset. 
Treatment comparisons will be based on the least squares means and standard errors obtained from 
the ANCOVA. 
S2: Differential imputation method: In this analysis, subjects who dropout due to an adverse event, 
lack of compliance, loss to follow-up or subject choice will have their convulsive seizure frequency for 
the remainder of the time during the planned T+M period replaced with the worse of the observed 
value or the baseline value as described for S1. However, for other withdrawal reasons (e.g., “lack of 
efficacy”) their observed DSF during T+M will be imputed for the remainder of the time between 
dropout and end 
of planned T+M. The DSF for the planned duration of T+M will then be computed as a weighted mean 
of the value before dropout and the imputed value after dropout. The weights will be the proportion of 
time before and after dropout. The statistical analysis (nonparametric ANCOVA) described at the start 
of section 8.2.2 will then be performed on the resulting dataset. Treatment comparisons will be based 
on the least squares means and standard errors obtained from the ANCOVA. 
Key Secondary Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The first key secondary endpoint compares treatment groups on the percentage of subjects with at 
least a 50% reduction from baseline in seizures resulting in drops. That is, the proportion of subjects in 
the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group who have a decrease in frequency of seizures resulting in drops of at 
least 50 percentage points will be compared to the analogous proportion in the placebo group. This the 
1st key secondary efficacy endpoint. 
The comparison of the percentage of subjects with at least a 50 percent drop from baseline between 
treatment groups will be made using a logistic regression model that incorporates the factors 
treatment and weight strata and the baseline seizure frequency. Separate models will be fit for ZX008 
0.2 mg/kg/day vs. placebo and ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day vs. placebo. Achievement of the 50 percentage 
point reduction or greater, yes or no) will be modeled as a function of treatment group (2 levels; 
ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day (or ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day) and placebo) and baseline weight strata group 
(<37.5 kg, ≥ 37.5 kg). If the model with treatment and weight strata is not convergent (e.g. due to a 
0 count in a treatment by weight strata combination, the model will be refit using treatment only and 
the baseline seizure frequency. If the model still does not converge, no odds ratio and p-value from 
the logistic regression will be reported. 
The model estimated odds ratio (including a 95% confidence interval) and p-value for comparison of 
ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day to placebo and ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day to placebo will be provided. A 
supplementary Fisher’s exact test comparing treatment groups will be provided. 
Similarly, the number and percentage of subjects who have a worsening, ≥0% reduction, ≥25% 
reduction, ≥50% reduction, ≥75% reduction, 100% reduction, and near seizure-freedom will be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 36/121 
 
 
 
tabulated for each treatment. Near seizure-freedom will be defined as having 0 or 1 seizures leading to 
a drop in the T+M period. These are additional secondary endpoints. 
Multiplicity 
The Part 1, Cohort A efficacy analyses will employ a serial gatekeeper strategy to maintain the Type 1 
error rate at α=0.05 across the family of analyses that support the primary and key secondary 
objectives.  
The strategy specifies a hierarchy of significance tests where each test acts as a gatekeeper to the 
tests below it. 
• 
The hierarchy starts with the primary analysis comparing ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day to placebo on the 
change in number of seizures that results in drops from baseline.  
The next steps in the hierarchy entail the comparisons for the key secondary endpoints. 
•  Change from baseline in frequency of seizures that result in drops in T+M in the ZX008 0.2 
mg/kg/day group compared to placebo. 
•  Proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥50% reduction from baseline in the frequency of seizures 
that result in drops in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups independently versus 
placebo. 
•  Proportion of subjects who achieve improvement (minimally, much, or very much improved) in the 
Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI-I) as assessed by the Principal Investigator 
comparing the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day and 0.2 mg/kg/day groups independently versus placebo. 
Below is a complete list of steps in the testing hierarchy in order: 
1. Compare ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day to placebo on the change in frequency in seizures that result in 
drops per 28 days between the Baseline and T+M periods. 
2. Compare ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day to placebo on the proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥ 50% 
reduction from baseline in the number of seizures that result in drops. 
3. Compare ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day to placebo on the CGI-I at Visit 12. 
4. Compare ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day to placebo on the change in frequency in seizures that result in 
drops per 28 days between the Baseline and T+M periods. 
5. Compare ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day to placebo on the proportion of subjects who achieve a ≥ 50% 
reduction from baseline in the number of seizures that result in drops. 
6. Compare ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day to placebo on the CGI-I at Visit 12

Screen failure includes those subjects who failed 1 or more Entry or Randomization criteria. A subject may have failed 2 or more 
of these criteria and therefore is counted in multiple categories.  
Percentages are calculated using the number of screen failures as the denominator. 
Subjects failed Exclusion criterion 6 or Randomization criterion 2. These criteria both relate to cardiovascular findings and were 
occasionally used interchangeably to refer to exclusionary regurgitation findings on the Visit 1 echocardiogram. 
A Part 1 trial completer is a subject who completed Part 1 through Visit 12 or who completed through at least Visit 8 and then 
transferred to Part 2.  
Subjects for whom an early transfer to Part 2 (prior to Visit 12) was reported as the primary reason for Part 1 discontinuation. A 
total of 7 subjects transferred to Part 2 early, but another primary reason for discontinuation was reported for 4 of these subjects. 
Recruitment 
Study Sites: Subjects in Part 1 Cohort A were enrolled at a total of 65 sites in North America (34), 
Europe (29), and Australia (2). 
Studied Period: 27 November 2017 (first subject in Cohort A screened) to 25 October 2019 (last 
subject in Cohort A completed last Part 1 visit); database lock date of 30 January 2020. 
Conduct of the study 
Major protocol deviations were summarized for the Safety Population. These included deviations that 
had the potential to impact subject safety, subject rights, GCP compliance, or analysis of efficacy or 
safety endpoints. Multiple deviations could occur in the same subject, and thus a subject could be 
counted in more than 1 deviation category. Major protocol deviations were presented in a subject data 
listing for the Enrolled Population, sorted by treatment and site. 
≥1 major protocol deviation was reported for 138 subjects (52.5%). 
Table 16 Major Protocol Deviations (Safety Population) 
Informed consent deviations were reported for 40 (15.2%) subjects overall. 
Concomitant medication deviations affected 34 (12.9%) subjects overall, and were largely related to 
subjects taking prohibited behavioral medications (13 subjects: clonidine, guanfacine, quetiapine, 
aripriprazole, risperidone, methylphenidate, clozapine), antihistamines or cold preparations used >5 
days (10 subjects), anti-nausea medication (3 subjects), or antidepressants (1 subject). Deviations

were also reported for an AED dose increase for 3 subjects, dose decrease for 3 subjects, and new 
concomitant medication initiated for 1 subject. 
Dosing deviations were reported for 33 (12.5%) subjects overall and included calculated treatment 
compliance based on returned study drug bottles of >120% (15 subjects), treatment compliance of 
<80% (8 subjects), inability to perform compliance calculations due to missing study drug bottles (5 
subjects), dosing intervals exceeding 12 hours (2 subjects), and errors made in blinded study drug 
bottle use during Titration (2 subjects) and Transition (2 subjects). Of the 15 subjects with deviations 
reported for treatment compliance of >120%, only 3 subjects experienced overdosing due to error. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
The mean (SD) age was 13.7 (7.59) years, with the majority (187 [71.1%]) of subjects being <18 
years of age. Overall, 55.5% of subjects were male. The ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group had a greater 
percentage of male subjects than the other groups. The majority of subjects were white, and the 
majority of subjects were not Hispanic or Latino. In all of the treatment groups, subjects were 
approximately evenly distributed between the 2 weight strata (<37.5 kg; ≥37.5 kg). The 3 countries 
that enrolled the most subjects were the US (122 [46.4%]), Spain (25 [9.5%]), and Italy (19 [7.2%]).

Subjects in this study had seizures that were difficult to control, and most had experienced multiple 
treatment failures. The enrolled subjects had failed a median of 7 AEDs (range: 1 to 20) and were 
stabilized on standard of care antiepileptic treatments (Table 14) but were still experiencing high 
seizure burden, ranging from a median of 53 to 85 drop seizures per 28 days across the treatment 
groups. In both ZX008 treatment groups, subjects had a greater median DSF in Baseline than did 
subjects in the placebo group (Table 19).

Primary endpoint and Third key secondary endpoint: Change from Baseline in Drop Seizure 
Frequency 
Results of the primary nonparametric ANCOVA analysis of this endpoint are presented for the mITT 
Population in Table 8. These results demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for ZX008 0.8 
mg/kg/day compared with placebo on the percentage change in DSF between the 4-week Baseline and 
the 14-week T+M (26.5% vs 7.6%, respectively, p = 0.0013). Median percentage changes from 
Baseline in DSF during T+M in the mITT Population are shown in Figure 6. 
As third key secondary endpoint, the change from Baseline in DSF during T+M for the ZX008 0.2 
mg/kg/day group was compared with the placebo group (p=0.0939).

- Change from Baseline in Drop Seizure Frequency: Treatment by Baseline Seizure 
Frequency Category Interaction 
Additional supplemental nonparametric and parametric analyses evaluated the treatment-by- Baseline 
drop seizure frequency category interaction for the change from Baseline in DSF during T+M and 
during Maintenance alone. Baseline DSF was categorized using tertiles; that is, subjects were divided 
into 3 equally sized groups based on their DSF during Baseline. The lowest tertile contained 87 
subjects who had a DSF between 2 and 43 during Baseline. The middle tertile contained 88 subjects 
with Baseline DSF between 44 and 122, while the highest tertile contained 88 subjects with Baseline 
DSF of 124 or greater. 
The nonparametric analysis suggested that the difference between both ZX008 0.8 and 0.2 mg/kg/day 
and placebo was most pronounced among the subjects with the lowest frequency of seizures during 
Baseline. However, neither the effect due to Baseline tertile, nor the interaction between treatment 
and Baseline tertile were statistically significant in the model (p = 0.1981 and p = 0.2131, 
respectively).

Table 33 Percentage Change from Baseline in Drop Seizure Frequency: T+M, Analysis with 
Categorized Baseline Seizure Frequency (mITT Population) 
Results of the analysis for the change from Baseline in DSF during Maintenance and the results of the 
parametric analyses were similar to those of the nonparametric analysis. 
- Change from Baseline in Drop Seizure Frequency: T+M, Sensitivity Analyses 
Several sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint during T+M and during Maintenance (M) alone 
were performed. When the primary nonparametric ANCOVA analysis was repeated excluding extreme 
outliers, not imputing for seizure clusters, and using 2 different methods for imputation of missing data 
due to subject dropout, the results were similar to those of the primary analysis in each case on the 
mITT Population. An additional analysis that used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test in place of the 
nonparametric ANCOVA had results similar to those of the primary analysis.  
Results of analyses repeated using the PP Population rather than the mITT Population also were similar 
to the primary analysis results. 
- Change from Baseline in Drop Seizure Frequency: by Seizure Type 
At a subject level, the most common seizures during Baseline in the mITT Population were TS (76.8% 
of subjects overall [78.2% placebo, 79.3% ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day]), GTC (44.5% [46.0%, 44.8%]), 
and AS (38.4% [35.6%, 41.4%]). 
The median percentage change from Baseline in the frequency per 28 days of each of the 5 types of 
drop seizures during T+M was analyzed for the mITT Population using pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum 
tests for comparisons between the ZX008 and placebo groups (Figure 7). The frequency of each 
seizure type in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group was reduced from Baseline to a greater or similar 
extent compared with the placebo group. ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day had the greatest magnitude of effect 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 54/121 
 
 
 
 
in reducing GTC frequency relative to placebo (p = 0.0005), with a median percentage change from 
Baseline of -45.7%, compared with 5.5% for the placebo group. Improvements in GTCs are clinically 
significant because this seizure type is associated with increased injuries and hospitalizations and are a 
major risk factor for SUDEP; the SUDEP risk increases in association with increasing frequency of GTC 
(Harden 2017; Sveinsson 2020). 
Similar results were observed for the changes from Baseline during Maintenance in the frequency per 
28 days of each of the 5 types of drop seizures. ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day also had the greatest 
magnitude of effect in reducing GTC frequency relative to placebo (p = 0.0005).

of Drop Seizure During T+M (mITT Population) 
- Responder Analyses of the Percentage of Subjects Achieving Reductions or Worsening 
from Baseline in Drop Seizure Frequency  
A statistically significantly lower percentage of subjects in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group 
experienced worsening (increases) or no change from Baseline in DSF during T+M compared with the 
placebo group (p = 0.0229).

- Number of seizure free days 
The comparison of drop seizure-free days between the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day and placebo groups was 
statistically significant (p = 0.0293). The median percentage increase from Baseline in the number of 
drop seizure free days in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group was 38.9%, with a median absolute change 
of 1.4 days (range: -10.4 to 20.3), compared with a median percentage increase of 13.8%, with a 
median absolute change of 0.6 days (range: -11.3 to 14.7) in the placebo group. When the number of 
monthly drop seizure-free days during Maintenance alone was analyzed in the same manner, the 
comparisons between each of the ZX008 groups and the placebo group were not statistically significant 
(p = 0.1741). 
Per Protocol Efficacy Analyses 
The analyses of changes from Baseline in DSF during T+M, the 50% responder rate during T+M, and 
the percentages of subjects rated by the Investigator as improved and as clinically meaningfully 
improved on the CGI-I at Week 12 were repeated for the PP Population. Results of these analyses are 
summarized in Table 35. The results mirrored the mITT Population results, with the exception that for 
the PP Population, the percentage of subjects in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group who achieved a 
≥50% reduction from Baseline in DSF during T+M was not significantly greater than in the placebo 
group (p=0.0643).

Other seizure types 
The change from Baseline in all countable motor seizures, which include all seizures of the types GTC, 
SGTC, TS, AS, TA, CS, HS, and FS with observable motor signs, per 28 days during T+M was analyzed

Page 57/121 
 
 
 
 
for the mITT Population as a secondary endpoint using the same nonparametric ANCOVA model as 
used for the primary endpoint. ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day had a statistically significant benefit in reducing 
countable motor seizures compared with placebo (p = 0.0025). The median percentage changes in the 
frequencies of GTC, SGTC, TS, AS, and TA are presented above. FS with clearly observable signs were 
experienced by approximately 20.2% of subjects during Baseline. The comparisons between 0.8 
mg/kg/day and placebo groups did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1833). Clonic seizures were 
experienced by few subjects during Baseline (≤ 6 subjects per treatment group) and did not show an 
apparent response for 0.8 mg/kg/day group relative to the placebo group (p = 0.8528). Also, few 
subjects experienced HS (≤ 3 subjects per treatment group). 
The change from Baseline in all countable nonmotor seizures, which include all seizures of the types 
absence, myoclonic, focal without clear observable motor signs, infantile spasms, and epileptic 
spasms, per 28 days during T+M were analyzed for the mITT Population as a secondary endpoint using 
the same nonparametric ANCOVA model as used for the primary endpoint. Nonmotor seizures were 
experienced by approximately 66% to 72% of subjects in each treatment group during Baseline and no 
significant effect was observed in reducing countable nonmotor seizures during T+M compared placebo 
(p = 0.8027). 
New-Onset Seizure Types  
The incidence of new-onset seizure types during T+M was assessed for the mITT Population in a 
posthoc analysis. Few subjects (9 [3.4%]) subjects experienced ≥ 1 new seizure type during T+M, 
with the subject incidence rate of new seizures being similar in all treatment groups (3 subjects in 
placebo, 4 subjects in ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group). Due to the low number of subjects who 
experienced new seizures, it was not possible to assess whether a relationship existed between 
treatment group and the type of new seizure experienced. 
Incidence of Status Epilepticus 
The incidence and frequency of SE when reported as an AE, when analyzed as a seizure reported in the 
eDiary as lasting > 10 minutes in duration, or when defined as a comprising both of these criteria was 
summarized for each treatment group during Baseline and T+M. Regardless of how SE was defined, no 
significant differences were observed between each ZX008 group and the placebo group. 
A posthoc sensitivity analysis further explored the incidence of SE. The subset of seizure types officially 
recognized as SE by the ILAE, including GTC, SGTC, focal with clear observable signs, focal without 
clear observable signs, or absence/atypical absence with duration > 10 minutes were identified as SE 
for this analysis. This subset of SE events was further assessed based on increasing emergency, ie, 
requirement for 0, 1, or > 1 rescue medication. Again, no notable differences were observed between 
each ZX008 group and the placebo group. 
Subgroups 
The following subgroups were utilized for some efficacy analyses and adverse event summarizations: 
•  Age: 2– <6 years, 6–<12 years, 12 - <18, 2-<18 years, ≥ 18 – 35 years. 
•  Sex: Male, Female 
•  Baseline Weight: <37.5 kg vs. ≥ 37.5 kg 
•  Number of concomitant Antiepileptic Medications Used: ≤2, 3, ≥4 medications 
•  Number of prior Antiepileptic Medications Used: 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, ≥10 medications 
•  Baseline Frequency of Seizures that Result in Drops (events/28 days): based on observed 
tertiles 
Assessment report

Page 58/121 
 
 
 
•  Usage of a specific concomitant medication(s) (top 3 concomitant AEDs to be determined by 
data review) (Yes / No) 
All subgroup analyses were exploratory, and any estimates of treatment differences are considered 
nominal. Interpretability of the observed results is limited due to the relatively small sample size of 
many of the subgroups and the high variability in seizure frequency often observed in this population.

Design 
Hypothesis 
Treatments groups 
Study ZX008-1601 is an international, multicenter, Phase 3 study being 
conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of 2 dose 
levels of ZX008 (fenfluramine hydrochloride) as adjunctive therapy for 
seizures in subjects with LGS. Subjects in Cohort A were enrolled at sites 
in North America, Europe, and Australia.  
Part 1 consisted of a 4-week Baseline, 2-week Titration Period (Titration), 
12-week Maintenance (Maintenance), and 2-week Taper Period (Taper) or 
Transition Period (Transition). The 4-week Baseline period consisted of 
the establishment of initial eligibility during a screening visit, followed by 
an observation period in which subjects were assessed for baseline 
seizure frequency based on recordings of daily seizure activity entered 
into an electronic diary. 
Upon completion of Baseline, subjects who qualified for the study were 
randomized (1:1:1) in a double-blind manner to receive 1 of 2 doses of 
ZX008 (0.2 or 0.8 mg/kg/day [maximum dose: 30 mg/day]) or placebo. 
Randomization was stratified by weight at screening (<37.5 kg, ≥37.5 
kg) to ensure balance across treatment arms, with a target of at least 
25% of subjects in each weight group.  
All subjects were titrated to their blinded randomized dose over the 2-
week Titration. Following dose titration, subjects continued treatment 
with study drug at their randomly assigned dose over the 12-week 
Maintenance under blinded conditions. Total treatment time from the 
beginning of Titration through the end of Maintenance was 14 weeks. 
Subjects had ECG and ECHO assessments midway during Maintenance (at 
Week 6) and at the End-of-Study (EOS) Visit (Week 14) in Part 1. At the 
end of Maintenance (or early discontinuation), all subjects underwent the 
blinded 2-week Taper or Transition Period (Taper/Transition) depending 
on whether they exited the study or were enrolled in Part 2, the long-
term open-label extension, respectively. Parents/caregivers used the 
electronic diary every day to record information about subjects’ seizures, 
dosing of study drug, and use of rescue medication. 
Duration of main phase: 
16 weeks in Part 1 (Titration=2 weeks; 
Maintenance=12 weeks; 
Taper/Transition=up to 2 weeks).

Duration of Run-in phase:

Primary Analysis 
The Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population was defined as all 
randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and for 
whom at least 1 week of eDiary data were available. Subjects were analyzed 
according to the treatment group to which they were randomized. Analyses 
of the primary efficacy and key secondary endpoints were performed on 
data from the mITT Population. 
The Per Protocol (PP) Population was defined as all randomized subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of study drug; who completed at least 4 weeks of 
eDiary data in the Maintenance period; who had no major protocol 
deviations that would have a significant impact on clinical outcome in Part 1; 
and who met the inclusion criterion for Baseline drop seizure count. The 
primary efficacy endpoint and key secondary endpoint analyses were 
repeated on the PP Population.

Notes 
The efficacy analyses employed a serial gatekeeper strategy to control 
the type 1 error rate for pairwise comparisons between the ZX008 and 
placebo groups among the primary and key secondary outcomes. The 
hierarchy started with the comparison of ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day with 
placebo for the primary and key secondary endpoints #1 and #2 above 
in that order (Steps 1 through 3), followed by the comparison of ZX008 
0.2 mg/kg/day with placebo for the key secondary endpoints #3, #4, 
and #5 above in that order (Steps 4 through 6). Once a p-value of > 
0.05 was obtained for statistical comparison between the specified 
treatment groups for an endpoint, formal hypothesis testing of the 
remaining endpoints would stop. 
Supportive study(ies) 
Persistence of efficacy or tolerance 
Study 1601 Part 2 
Study 1601 Part 2 was designed to evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and effectiveness 
(secondary objective) of ZX008 for up to 1 year in the subjects who successfully completed Part 1.  
Treatment: During the OLE Treatment Period, all subjects were transitioned from their blinded daily 
dose to be treated initially with ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day for 1 month to assess effectiveness of this dose 
(Table 3). After 1 month at this dose, the Investigator could adjust the ZX008 dose for each subject 
based on effectiveness, safety, and tolerability.  
Efficacy Endpoints: 
The efficacy endpoints for Part 2 of the study are: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The change from baseline in the frequency of seizures that result in drops (ESC-confirmed). 
The change in frequency of all seizures that (typically) result in drops (i.e., GTC, SGTC, TS, AS, 
TA) between baseline and the OLE Treatment Period whether ESC confirmed as drop or not. 
The change from baseline in the frequency of all countable motor seizures (GTC, sGTC, TS, CS, 
AS, TA, FS, and HS) 
The change from baseline in frequency of all countable non-motor seizures (absence, 
myoclonic, 
focal without clear observable motor signs, infantile spasms, and epileptic spasms). 
The change from baseline in the frequency of all countable seizures (ie, motor and non-motor) 
The proportion of subjects who achieve a worsening from baseline (ie, ≤ 0% reduction), or > 
0%, 
≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, ≥ 75%, 100% reduction, and “near seizure freedom” (ie, 0 or 1 seizures) 
from 
baseline in frequency of seizures that result in drops (ESC-confirmed), seizures that typically 
result in drops, all countable motor seizures, all countable non-motor seizures, and all 
countable 
seizures 
•  Number of seizure-free days, defined as 1) days with no seizures that result in drops (ESC 
confirmed) and 2) days with no countable motor seizures. 
• 
Longest interval between seizures that result in drops (ESC-confirmed). 
•  Clinical Global Impression – Improvement rating, as assessed by the Principal Investigator. 
•  Clinical Global Impression – Improvement rating, as assessed by the parent/caregiver.

Part 2 is an open-label, long-term safety study of ZX008 for subjects who have successfully completed 
14 
weeks of treatment (Titration + Maintenance) in Part 1 and are candidates for continuous treatment 
for 
an extended period of time; subjects who have not completed the entire 14 weeks of treatment in Part 
1 may be eligible to participate in Part 2 on a case-by-case basis and only following sponsor approval. 
Part 2 consists of a 12-month Open-Label Extension (OLE) Treatment Period and a 2-week Post-Dosing 
Period. Thus, subjects who were randomized to ZX008 during Part 1 and complete Part 2 will have 
been 
treated with ZX0008 for at least 70 weeks (including their participation in both Part 1 and Part 2). 
Analysis sets: 
OLE Safety Population (OLE SAF) 
Safety analyses for Part 2 will be performed on the OLE Safety (SAF) Population, defined as all 
subjects 
who receive at least one dose of ZX008 during the open label extension. 
OLE mITT Population 
The OLE Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population is defined as all subjects who receive at least one 
dose of ZX008 and have a valid estimate of the frequency of seizures that result in drops from Part 1 
and 
at least one month (30 days) of valid seizure data during the open label extension. Effectiveness 
analyses, such as evaluating the change in the frequency of drop seizures, will be performed on the 
OLE 
mITT Population. 
Safety Population for Part 1 (DB SAF) 
The SAF Population for Part 1 is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
ZX008 or Placebo in Part 1, regardless of entry into Part 2. 
Long Term Safety (LT SAF) 
This population will include subjects who received at least one dose of ZX008 during Part 1 or Part 2. 
For 
subjects treated with Placebo in Part 1 and who were treated with ZX008 in Part 2, the first dose of 
ZX008 
would occur in the Part 1 transition period. 
Participant flow: 
A total of 247 Cohort A subjects enrolled in Part 2. At the time of the data cutoff date (19 October 
2020), a total of 143 subjects had completed the study, 19 subjects were ongoing, and 85 subjects 
had withdrawn. 
Table 5 shows that 122 subjects had completed and 83 subjects had withdrawn. The discrepancy of 
the 21 and 2 subjects, respectively, is due to delays in completion of the final disposition eCRFs as a 
result of profound restrictions and precautions related to COVID-19 for onsite personnel in-person 
availability and data monitoring. 
As of the data cutoff date, 195 (78.9%) of the subjects had completed ≥ 6 months of the study, 150 
(60.7%) of whom had completed ≥1 year. (Some subjects remained in the study longer than the 
planned duration of 1 year due to COVID-19 related restrictions and precautions imposed on their EOS 
visit.) Throughout their study participation, subjects used the eDiary to record daily seizure activity, 
and assessments of efficacy and safety, including cardiovascular safety, were performed according to 
the schedule in Table 4. Of the 150 subjects who completed ≥ 1 year in the study, 117 (78.0%) had a 
Month 12 ECHO performed.

Table 45 Overall Subject Disposition (OLE Safety Population and Open-Label Extension mITT 
Population) 
Recruitment: 
Study centers: Subjects in Part 2 Cohort A were enrolled at a total of 63 sites in North America (32) 
Europe (29), and Australia (2). 
Studied period: 18 April 2017 (Date first subject enrolled in Part 2) to interim database cutoff date (19 
October 2020). 
Baseline data: 
The interim analysis for Study 1601 Part 2 included 247 Cohort A subjects who had participated in 
double-blind Study 1601 Part 1. The subjects had a mean (SD) duration of exposure to ZX008 of 298.9 
(122.88) days as of the data cutoff date of 19 October 2020. (Note that due to precautions and 
restrictions related to COVID-19, some subjects delayed their EOS Visit and remained in Part 2 for 
longer than 365 ± 4 days [range: 370-542 days]).

Of the 241 subjects in the OLE mITT Population (ie, subjects who received ≥ 1 dose of ZX008 and had 
a valid estimate of drop seizure frequency from Part 1 and ≥ 1 month of valid seizure data during the 
OLE), 194 (80.5%) subjects had completed ≥ 6 months of the study, 150 (60.7%) of whom had 
completed ≥ 1 year. Nearly half the subjects in the mITT Population, 113 subjects, received a mean 
daily dose of ZX008 of 0.4 to < 0.6 mg/kg/day during the study; 68 received a mean daily dose of > 0 
to < 0.4 mg/kg/day and 60 received a mean daily dose of ≥ 0.6 mg/kg/day. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics of the Study 1601 Part 2 mITT Population were similar to 
the overall characteristics for the mITT Population in Study 1601 Part 1. The mean (SD) subject age at 
entry to Part 2 Cohort A was 14.3 (7.60) years (range: 2 to 36). The majority of subjects (68.5%) 
were < 18 years of age; 31.5% were ≥ 18 year of age. Fifty-six percent of subjects were male. The 
majority of subjects (80.5%) were white. Slightly over half the subjects (53.9%) were ≥ 37.5 kg. Most 
(98.4%) subjects were receiving between 1 and 5 concomitant AEDs during the study. Two subjects 
received > 5 concomitant AEDs. The most commonly used (≥ 25% of subjects) AEDs were valproate 
(all forms), clobazam, and lamotrigine. 
Outcomes and estimation: 
The first effectiveness outcome was the change from Baseline (Part 1) in DSF during the OLE 
Treatment Period (Table 31). Both the change in DSF for the entire OLE Treatment Period (Part 2 Day 
1 to EOS) compared with Baseline (Part 1) and the change in DSF for Month 2 to EOS (Part 2 Day 31 
to EOS) compared with Baseline (Part 1) were analyzed. The latter endpoint excluded the first month 
of open-label treatment, in which each subject was held on a dose of ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day and in 
which some subjects may have still been adjusting to the dose transition from Part 1. Both endpoints 
included subjects who were randomized to placebo and subjects randomized to ZX008 treatment 
during Part 1. Note that for this analysis, “EOS” refers to either EOS, ET, or last visit as of the interim 
analysis data cutoff date, whichever occurred first, for each subject.

Table 46 Change from Baseline in Frequency of Seizures Resulting in Drops per 28 Days 
(OLE mITT Population) 
The median percentage reduction from Baseline in DSF during the overall OLE Treatment Period (ie, 
Day 1 to EOS) was 28.6% (p < 0.0001). The median percentage reduction from Baseline for Month 2 
to EOS was 30.5% (p < 0.0001). Median percentage reductions in DSF were greatest at the ≥ 0.6 
mg/kg/day mean daily dose level of ZX008.

As shown in Figure 8, median percentage reductions from Baseline in DSF were observed at Month 1 
and maintained through Month 15.  
Figure 8 Median Percentage Change from Baseline in Drop Seizures Frequency During the 
OLE Treatment Period (OLE mITT Population) 
When analyzed by Part 1 randomized treatment, median percentage changes from Baseline in DSF 
during the overall OLE Treatment Period were similar for subjects originally randomized to the placebo, 
ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day, and ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day groups: -28.0%, 25.9%-, and 30.0%-, respectively. 
Analyses by age subgroup demonstrated that both pediatric (2 to < 18 years [n = 171]) and adult (≥ 
18 years [n = 70]) subjects had statistically significant median percentage reductions from Baseline in 
DSF during the Month 2 to EOS period (25.9% [p < 0.0001] and 40.0% [p = 0.0011], respectively). 
All pediatric age groups experienced median percentage reductions from Baseline in DSF, though 
reductions were variable between the subgroups. No relationship between age and the percentage 
reduction in DSF was apparent during the OLE. 
Table 47 Change from Baseline in Drop Seizure Frequency per 28 Days by Part 1 Age 
Subgroup (OLE mITT Population) 
Analyses by Part 1 baseline weight subgroup demonstrated that both subjects < 37.5 kg (n = 114) 
and ≥ 37.5 kg (n = 127) had statistically significant median percentage reductions in DSF during OLE 
from Month 2 to EOS period (28.2% [p = 0.0034] and 31.1% [p < 0.0001], respectively).

The percentage of subjects in the OLE mITT Population who achieved a ≥ 50% reduction from Baseline 
in DSF (50% responder rate) during the OLE Treatment Period is analyzed. Nearly one-third of 
subjects, 31.7%, achieved a clinically meaningful ≥ 50% reduction in DSF from Month 2 to EOS (ie, 
after the mandatory 1 month of ZX008 dosing at 0.2 mg/kg/day).  
No subjects in the OLE mITT Population had an AE of SE during Baseline. During the longer Part 2 
period, the number of subjects who had ≥ 1 AE of SE increased to 9 (3.7%) subjects. The mean (SD) 
number of AEs of SE per 28 days was 0.02 (0.178) (range: 0-2.4). When SE events were assessed 
based on seizure data from the eDiary alone (ie, seizures with duration > 10 mins), 104 (43.2%) 
subjects had ≥ 1 episode of SE during Baseline, and the mean (SD) number of episodes was 3.84 
(9.243) per 28 days (range: 0-82). During the Part 2 period, 136 (56.4%) subjects had ≥ 1 episode of 
SE and the mean (SD) number of episodes was 5.22 (19.942) per 28 days (range: 0-216.5). The 
sampling time for the Part 2 treatment period – 1 year – was considerably longer than the Part 1 4-
weeks Baseline, so the increase in episodes per 28 days during the OLE Treatment Period is likely 
attributable to the sampling duration. Of note, the mean number of episodes per 28 days in a 1-year 
trial (5.22) is not large and underscores the severity of LGS. 
Study 1900 
Study 1900 was designed to evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and the effectiveness of 
ZX008 (secondary objective) for up to 3 years (2 years in Denmark) in subjects with LGS, Dravet 
syndrome, or other epileptic encephalopathies. The interim analysis of this ongoing study included only 
subjects who entered this study from Study 1601 Part 2 Cohort A. As in Study 1601 Part 2, an open-
label, flexible dosing scheme for ZX008, up to 0.8 mg/kg/day (maximum 30 mg/day), was used in this 
study.  
Study 1900 data are limited to data for 60 subjects from Study 1601 Part 2 Cohort A who received ≥ 1 
dose of ZX008 in Study 1900 and had a valid efficacy assessment after Visit 1 during the OLE (the 
mITT Population). The mean (SD) subject age at entry to Study 1900 for subjects in the mITT 
Population was 15.2 (7.7) years of age (range: 4 to 37). The majority of subjects (66.7%) were < 18 
years of age; 33.3% were ≥ 18 year of age. Approximately 47% of subjects were male. The majority 
of subjects (75.0%) were white. The median weight was 38.4 kg (range: 14 to 91). The majority of 
subjects (70.0%) were rated by the Investigator on the CGI-S as moderately ill or worse relative to 
the Investigator’s total clinical experience within this patient population. The majority of subjects 
(70.0%) were rated by the parent/caregiver on the CGI-S as moderately ill or worse relative to 
expectations for age and development. 
At the last assessment in Study 1900 for each subject in the mITT Population as of the data cutoff 
date, the majority (> 78%) in the mITT Population were rated on the CGI-I by the Investigator and by 
the parent/caregiver as having an improved or stable overall condition relative to the CGI-S rating at 
Visit 1 (Study Day 1), ie, as having minimal, much, or very much improvement or no change. Sixty 
percent and 62.0% of subjects were rated by the Investigator and parent/caregiver, respectively, as 
having improvement (ie, minimal, much, or very much improved), and 41.8% and 40.0% of subjects, 
respectively, were rated as having clinically meaningful improvement (ie, much or very much 
improved). 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Phase 3 Study 1601 Part 1 is considered main proof of efficacy in patients with LGS. The long-term 
extension study (Study 1601 Part 2) is considered as supportive study only.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 1601 Part 1: 
Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy 
and safety of 2 dose levels of ZX008 (fenfluramine hydrochloride, 0.2 or 0.8 mg/kg/day [maximum 
dose: 30 mg/day]) as adjunctive therapy for seizures associated with LGS in children and adults 
(subjects 2 to 35 years of age). The study design is aligned with the standard placebo-controlled 
design recommended in epilepsy guideline for add-on therapies. Because an accurate diagnosis of LGS 
is difficult in children younger than 2 years, and seizures that result in drops may not be accurately 
counted in this age group, children younger than 2 years were not included. 
Subjects were required to have been receiving ≥ 1 to 4 concomitant AEDs. The ketogenic diet (KD) 
and vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) were permitted as concomitant therapies during the trial but did not 
count toward this requirement. Changes to background therapies were not allowed. 
All subjects were required to have had ≥ 8 drop seizures in the 4 weeks immediately prior to Screening 
(minimum of 4 drop seizures in the first 2 weeks and 4 in the last 2 weeks before Screening) based on 
parent/guardian report or Investigator medical notes and ≥ 8 drop seizures during the 4-week Baseline 
(≥ 2 drop seizures per week) as recorded in the eDiary. Eight or more drop seizures occurring at a 
consistent frequency represents subjects with uncontrolled seizures, excludes subjects whose seizures 
only occur in clusters or who have only intermittent infrequent seizures, and provides a sufficient 
baseline from which to measure meaningful change. Seizures that result in drops were generalized 
tonic-clonic (GTC), secondarily generalized tonic-clonic (SGTC), tonic (TS), atonic (AS), and 
tonic/atonic (TA) seizures.  
The exclusion criteria were acceptable.  
After a 4-week Baseline, upon randomization (1:1:1), subjects entered a 2-week Titration followed by 
a 12-week Maintenance for a total of 14-weeks treatment. The duration of treatment is acceptable.  
It is critical to note that doses of ZX008 are expressed as the fenfluramine hydrochloride salt. So, the 
0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg/day doses are equivalent to 0.2 and 0.7 mg/kg/day (rounded), respectively, of the 
fenfluramine free base (with a conversion factor of 0.864) which is used in clinic and expressed in 
SmPC. The 30 mg/day maximum dose is equivalent to 26 mg/day of fenfluramine free base. SmPC 
presents all data in fenfluramine free base doses only. 0.8 mg/kg/day dose (30 mg max) is the dose 
approved for Dravet syndrome.  
The comparison between the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day and placebo groups for the change from Baseline 
in DSF during T+M was the primary efficacy outcome measure; the comparison between the ZX008 
0.2 mg/kg/day and placebo groups was a key secondary outcome measure. Two other key secondary 
efficacy outcome measures were evaluated for both groups independently: 1) the percentage of 
subjects who achieved a ≥50% reduction from Baseline DSF, and 2) the percentage of subjects who 
were rated by the Investigator as improved on the CGI-I. 
The efficacy analyses employed a serial gatekeeper strategy to maintain the Type 1 error rate at 
α=0.05 across the family of analyses that supported the primary and key secondary objectives. The 
hierarchy started with the comparison of ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day with placebo for primary and key 
secondary outcomes, followed by comparison of ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day with placebo in the same 
sequence of outcomes. The SAP and protocol, clinical summaries do not agree on the hierarchy of 
tests, but the Section 8.1 of the SAP v2.0 provides the right sequence. Further, the MAH provided 
some clarifications on the predefined analysis, estimand strategy, missing data, absolute changes for 
DSF and distribution of data.

Part 2: 
Study 1601 Part 2 was designed to evaluate the long-term safety (primary objective) and effectiveness 
(secondary objective) of ZX008 for up to 1 year in the subjects who successfully completed Part 1.  
Upon transition to Part 2, all subjects were transitioned from their blinded daily dose in Part 1 to be 
treated initially with ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day for 1 month to assess effectiveness of this dose and all 
efficacy analysis used month 1 values as baseline. This creates confusion and issues with analysis 
regarding maintenance of effect as the treatment is blindly down titrated for all patients and started 
again at 0.2 mg/kg/day. For patients on active arms, this might have caused worsening of seizures or 
carry over effects from the high dose.  Due to tapering and dosing transition between study parts, high 
discontinuation, and flexible dosing (most patients were treated with 0.4-0.6 mg/kg/day dose) the 
conclusion in Part 2 may be biased. It is highly uncertain if efficacy results beyond 14 weeks could 
form the basis of maintenance of efficacy. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Part 1: 
A total of 335 subjects were enrolled and screened, 263 of these subjects were randomized (placebo: 
87 subjects; ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day: 89 subjects; ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day: 87 subjects). A total of 245 
(93.2%) randomized subjects were considered Part 1 completers. The study population included 187 
(71.1%) pediatric subjects < 18 years of age and 76 (28.9%) adult subjects ≥ 18 years of age with 
LGS. Approximately half of the subjects (46.4%) were from Europe which gives a good representation 
of EU population. The baseline population was mostly <18 years of age (71.1%), 55.5% male, 
majority of white race. The enrolled subjects had failed a median of 7 AEDs (range: 1 to 20) and were 
stabilized on standard of care antiepileptic treatments but were still experiencing high seizure burden, 
ranging from a median of 53 to 85 drop seizures per 28 days across the treatment groups. Most 
subjects (98.9%) received between 1 and 4 concomitant AEDs, the median number of concomitant 
AEDs was 3. The most commonly used concomitant AEDs (≥ 25% of subjects overall) were clobazam 
(45.2%), lamotrigine (33.5%), and valproate (55.9). 
Study 1601 Part 1 met its primary objective with the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day dose and it was supported 
by p-value for 50% responders for this dose. A 26.5% median percentage reduction in DSF was 
observed between Baseline and the 14-week T+M in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group, compared with 
a reduction of 7.6% in the placebo group (p = 0.0013). The percentage of subjects achieving a 
clinically meaningful ≥ 50% reduction from Baseline in DSF during T+M (ie, 50% responder rate) was 
25.3% in ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group, compared with 10.3% for placebo (p = 0.0150). CGI-I showed 
a supportive trend only.  
As the third key secondary endpoint (the fourth endpoint in the testing hierarchy), the change from 
Baseline in DSF during T+M for the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group was compared with the placebo 
group. The median percentage reduction from Baseline for the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group was 
14.2%. The difference between ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day and placebo was not significant (p=0.0939). 0.2 
mg/kg/day is not considered an effective dose. 
Supplementary or sensitivity analyses of primary endpoint provided mostly supportive results (during 
maintenance period only, using PP population, excluding extreme outliers, not imputing for seizure 
clusters, and using 2 different methods for imputation of missing data due to subject dropout, using 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, by seizure type). As maintenance period is recommended to be used for 
primary analysis in the epilepsy guideline, the primary analysis was used to compare the change from 
Baseline in DSF during Maintenance only. The results of this analysis for the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 75/121 
 
 
 
group (-27.2%) compared with the placebo group (-7.3%) (p=0.0018) were similar to those of the 
analysis for the T+M.  
Additionally, no significant increases in any individual seizure types, no notable difference in new 
seizure types or incidence of status epilepticus are reassuring. 
Due to small subgroups, some imbalances were observed. Most of the subgroups showed consistent 
favouring of 0.8 mg/kg/day treatment over placebo. Subgroups with uncertain effect were subjects 
using 4 or more concomitant AEDs, subjects with very high baseline seizure frequency, and subjects 
who had less than 4 AED use in the past. So, heavily treated subjects with highest baseline seizure 
frequency and subjects who have not failed many therapies in the past were the two extremes who 
had uncertain benefit of treatment with Fintepla. Of course, small numbers and no statistical power to 
detect differences in small subgroups is acknowledged. The most commonly used concomitant 
antiepileptic therapies did not seem to have an effect on the efficacy analysis. 
Part 2: 
247 subjects were enrolled in Part 2. A total of 83 subjects are reported as having discontinued during 
Part 2 as of the data cut-off date for the report. For the recommended dose, the claim of durable 
efficacy could be questionable, however the efficacy analyses (resembling primary analysis and 
responder analysis from Part 1) were supportive. Nearly one-third of subjects, 30.8%, experienced 
worsening or no change in DSF from Month 2 to EOS (ie, after the mandatory 1 month of ZX008 
dosing at 0.2 mg/kg/day). 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP agrees that efficacy on reduction in drop of seizure frequency was demonstrated in a study 
of adequate design (Study 1601 Part 1) for the 0.8 mg/kg/day dose. 
The recommended posology and the relevant data are correctly reflected in the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Fintepla is approved in the United States (US), European Union (EU), and United Kingdom (UK) for the 
treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older. The New 
Drug Application (NDA) for fenfluramine for this indication (NDA 212102) was approved in the US in 
June 2020. The marketing authorization application for this indication in the EU and UK was approved 
in December 2020.  
Fenfluramine was previously approved in Europe in the 1960s and the US (Pondimin NDA 16-618) in 
the 1970s as an appetite suppressant at a dose of 60 to 120 mg/day for the treatment of adult 
obesity. Fenfluramine was withdrawn from all world-wide markets by 1997 due to its reported 
association with cardiac valve abnormalities in adult patients who were receiving the drug, most often 
in combination with phentermine, to treat adult obesity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
[CDC] 1997; Connolly 1997; Wong 1998). The maximum ZX008 dose studied in the LGS clinical 
program is 30 mg/day, which is the same as that studied and approved in Dravet syndrome and is 2 to 
4 times lower than the daily doses prescribed in the past to treat adult obesity. 
The date cut-off date for safety in the LGS development program was 19 Oct 2020. The clinical studies 
that evaluated the safety of ZX008 in subjects with LGS include the following:

Table 48 Summary of Clinical Studies Providing Safety Information  
The following populations were defined for safety assessments (Figure 9): 
• The Study 1601 Part 1 Safety Population was defined as all randomized subjects who received at 
least one dose of ZX008 or placebo in Study 1601 Part 1 (N=263). 
• The ISS Safety Population (ISS-SAF) consists of all randomized subjects in Study 1601 Cohort A, 
who received ≥ 1 dose of ZX008 or placebo throughout their participation in Study 1601 Part 1, Part 2, 
or Study 1900 (N=263). One subject randomized to placebo in Part 1 did not continue into Part 2; thus 
262 subjects were treated with ZX008 in the double-blind and open-label extension (OLE) treatment 
periods. 
• The ISS Open-label Safety Population (ISS-OLE-SAF) consists of all subjects in the ISS Safety 
Population who received ≥ 1 dose of ZX008 in the Study 1601 Part 2 treatment period, regardless of 
whether they entered Study 1900 (N=247). The OLE period starts on the date of first open-label 
ZX008 dose in Study 1601 Part 2. Subjects in Study 1601 Part 1 who did not continue into Part 2 are 
not included in this population.

Decreased appetite was the most commonly reported TEAE in the ZX008 treatment groups; decreased 
appetite and pyrexia were the most commonly reported TEAEs in the placebo group. Decreased 
appetite was the only TEAE reported with a >10% difference in incidence between treatment groups; 
these events were reported for >10% more subjects in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group than in the 
placebo and 0.2 mg/kg/day group. 
System organ classes in which TEAEs were commonly reported in either ZX008 group (≥ 25% of 
subjects) that were reported with a ≥ 10% greater incidence than in the placebo group included 
Gastrointestinal disorders, Infections and infestations, and Metabolism and nutrition disorders.

somnolence, seizure, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory tract 
infection, constipation, and change in seizure presentation. Decreased appetite, vomiting, fatigue, 
pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, somnolence, and seizure were each reported for ≥ 10% of subjects at all 
mean daily dose levels of ZX008. TEAEs that were reported for ≥ 10% of subjects at any mean daily 
dose level and that appeared to have a dose relationship included pyrexia and nasopharyngitis, each of 
which was most common at the ZX008 ≥ 0.6 mg/kg/day mean daily dose level.

The most common TEAE occurring after 6 months of treatment was seizure (6.9%). 
Treatment-related AEs: 
For the Study 1601 Part 1 Safety Population, the subject incidence of treatment-related TEAEs 
occurring during T+M was higher in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group (55.2%) than in the placebo 
(39.1%) and ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day (34.8%) groups. The most common treatment-related TEAEs in 
the ZX008 groups (≥ 10% of subjects in either group) were decreased appetite, fatigue, and 
somnolence. Decreased appetite and fatigue were the only common treatment-related TEAEs reported 
with a >10% difference in incidence between treatment groups.

Treatment Emergent Adverse Events by Severity: 
In Study 1601 Part 1, 5 subjects (3 in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group and 1 in each of the other 
treatment groups) had TEAEs during T+M that were graded as severe. The TEAE somnolence in the 
ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group and the TEAE for abnormal behavior in the placebo group were assessed 
as possibly related to the study drug by the Investigators. 
Table 58 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported as Severe in Any Treatment Group, 
by System Organ Class and Preferred Term – T+M; Part 1 Safety Population 
For the ISS-SAF Population, severe TEAEs were reported for 21 (8.0%) subjects. Three (3.7%) 
subjects who received ZX008 >0 to < 0.4 mg/kg/day, 11 (9.7%) subjects who received ZX008 0.4 to 
< 0.6 mg/kg/day, and 7 (10.3%) subjects who received ZX008 ≥ 0.6 mg/kg/day had severe TEAEs. 
Severe TEAEs reported for ≥ 2 subjects overall were: status epilepticus, somnolence, change in seizure 
presentation, decreased appetite, and seizure. Two severe TEAEs for somnolence, and 1 severe TEAE 
for status epilepticus, abnormal behavior, and lethargy in the ZX008 ≥ 0.6 mg/kg/day group, and 1 
severe TEAE for decreased appetite, and asthenia in the ZX008 0.4 - <0.6 mg/kg/day group were 
assessed as possibly related to the study drug by the Investigators.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths: 
There were 2 deaths that occurred during Studies 1601 Part 1, 1601 Part 2, and 1900 as of the data 
cut-off date. 
One death occurred during Study 1601 Part 1. One subject, a 6 to 12 year-old male randomized to the 
ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day treatment group, experienced suspected SUDEP (MedDRA term: Sudden 
unexplained death in epilepsy) on Study Day 87. The subject had a relevant medical history including 
developmental delay, epilepsy, gastrostomy, and seizures. Concomitant antiepileptic medications and 
therapies included phenobarbital, levetiracetam, ethosuximide, valproate semisodium, and ketogenic 
diet (2014 – ongoing). The subject began dosing with study drug on Study Day -1 with ZX008 at 0.2 
mg/kg/day, titrated to a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/day over Titration, and entered Maintenance at this dose 
on Study Day 14. The subject was found unresponsive on the morning of Study Day 87; he was well 
when put to bed the night before. He had no fever and had been seizure free in the previous 48 hours. 
Despite 55 minutes of resuscitation, he could not be revived. The Investigator assessed the SUDEP as 
not related to the study drug.  
One death occurred during Study 1601 Part 2. One subject, a 30 – 40 year-old female randomized to 
the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day treatment group in Part 1 on Study Day -1 and entered Part 2 on Study Day 
127. On Study Day 159, the dose was increased to 0.4 mg/kg/day, and on Study Day 246, the dose 
was increased to 0.6 mg/kg/day. On Study Day 350, the subject experienced convulsive status 
epilepticus (MedDRA preferred term: Status epilepticus). On Study Day 350, the subject experienced 
an increase of seizures with a generalized tonic clonic convulsion every ten minutes and was admitted 
to the hospital. The subject was treated with rectal diazepam 40 mg once for convulsive status 
epilepticus. During the hospitalization, the subject experienced several seizures and was treated with 
intermittent intravenous (IV) valproic acid, intermittent levetiracetam, and lacosamide. Lacosamide 
300 mg IV was added once for convulsive status epilepticus, due to lack of response to treatment. The 
seizures were successfully controlled after IV lacosamide administration, but the subject suffered from 
a decreased level of consciousness. On Study Day 351, a chest x-ray performed showed she 
experienced the event of aspiration pneumonia (MedDRA preferred term: Pneumonia aspiration) and 
developed respiratory failure. The subject received amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, methylprednisolone, 
bronchodilators, and oxygen therapy as treatment for aspiration pneumonia. An electroencephalogram 
performed on Study Day 351 showed interactive epileptiform abnormalities in front of the temporal 
area. On Study Day 352, the subject’s condition was noted to be clinically worsening and palliative 
sedation measures were taken. An electrocardiogram performed on Study Day 353 showed asystole. 
The outcome of the event of pneumonia aspiration was reported as death on Study Day 353. The 
Investigator assessed the pneumonia aspiration and death as not related to ZX008. 
Other Serious Adverse Events: 
For the Study 1601 Part 1 Safety Population, at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE was reported during 
T+M for 18 subjects (6.8%): 4 subjects (4.6%) in the placebo group, 4 subjects (4.5%) in the ZX008 
0.2 mg/kg/day group, and 10 subjects (11.5%) in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group.  
Two subjects had treatment-emergent SAEs during T+M considered by the Investigator as related to 
treatment, including somnolence of moderate severity in a subject in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group 
(reported during Titration), which resolved after withdrawal of study drug; and change in seizure 
presentation of moderate severity in a subject in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group (reported during 
Maintenance), which resolved with an IV levetiracetam treatment and no change to study drug dosing.

Adverse events of special interest: 
Adverse events of special interest were specified as an elevated prolactin level ≥ 2×ULN; 
hypoglycemia < 3.0 mmol/L or 54 mg/dL, whether that level is associated with symptoms or not; and 
suicidal thoughts, ideation, or gestures. 
For the Study 1601 Part 1 Safety Population, 1 subject (1.1%) in the placebo group and 3 subjects 
(3.4%) in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group had ≥ 1 treatment-emergent AESI during T+M. The subject 
in the placebo group had hypoglycemia. All 3 subjects in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group had either 
hyperprolactinemia or blood prolactin increased; only 1 of these events was considered by the 
Investigator as possibly related to treatment. All AESIs were mild in severity. None of the events were 
SAEs or led to discontinuation of treatment. All events resolved in Part 1 or after the subject began 
open-label treatment in Part 2, with no action taken during Part 1 or Part 2. 
In ISS-SAF Population, a total of 9 (3.4%) subjects had ≥ 1 AESI. A total of 8 subjects had a single 
event of hyperprolactinemia (reported as either hyperprolactinemia or blood prolactin increased) and 1 
subject had 2 separate blood prolactin increased events. Hypoglycemia was also reported for 1 of 
these subjects. Only 1 event (blood prolactin increased) was reported as related to treatment. Two 
subjects had events (blood prolactin increased) of moderate severity; the remainder of the subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023

had events of mild severity. Of the 9 subjects with hyperprolactinemia or blood prolactin increased, 7 
subjects had experienced seizures within the prior 2 days of the elevated serum prolactin blood test 
results. None of the AESI led to discontinuation of treatment. The AESIs were resolved with no action 
taken for all but 1 subject (who had blood prolactin increased of mild severity) as of the data cutoff 
date. For 1 subject, who had blood prolactin increased of mild severity, the event was an SAE (“other 
medically important serious event”). The elevated prolactin level was first observed on Day 295 while 
the subject was receiving ZX008 0.7 mg/kg/day, resolved on Day 380, and was not associated with an 
increase in seizure activity. 
Analysis of Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome: 
A review of AEs reported in the double-blind study (Study 1601 Part 1) suggests a potential increased 
occurrence with higher ZX008 doses for decreased appetite, weight decreased, fatigue, and 
somnolence. 
- Decreased Appetite and Weight Loss 
Table 62 Study 1601 Part 1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Weight Decreased and 
Decreased Appetite During Double-blind Treatment Period by MedDRA Preferred Term; Part 
1 Safety Population 
Table 63 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Weight Decreased and Decreased Appetite 
During Double-blind Treatment Period by MedDRA Preferred Term (ISS-SAF Population) 
Weight loss is a known effect of ZX008 (fenfluramine). Decreased appetite and weight loss TEAEs were 
reported in more subjects randomized to the ZX008 treatment groups than the placebo groups during 
T+M. This is not unexpected given the known anorectic effects of fenfluramine. Subjects who reported 
decreased appetite did not necessarily report weight loss. The protocols did not mandate recording of 
the TEAE of weight loss upon certain thresholds. Rather, evaluation was conducted on observed weight 
loss ≥ 7% over the double-blind and open-label studies with body weight recorded on the vital signs 
case report form. 
- Lethargy, Somnolence, and Fatigue 
Taken together, lethargy, somnolence, and fatigue were reported more commonly in the ZX008 groups 
compared with the placebo group in Study 1601 Part 1. These 3 TEAEs were also commonly reported 
in the ISS-SAF population during the double-blind through OLE periods.

Laboratory findings 
Few clinically significant abnormalities were observed in hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis 
laboratory results. 
Mean platelet counts decreased slightly from baseline for both ZX008 treatment groups and the 
placebo group during double-blind treatment, although the mean and median values remained within 
the normal range. Valproate is associated with decreased platelet counts (Depakene® USPI 2020), and 
decreased platelet counts were observed during T+M in some subjects taking concomitant VPA in 
clinical studies of ZX008 in Dravet syndrome. A similar observation was made in Study 1601 Part 1. At 
Visit 8 among 130 subjects with platelet counts within the normal reference range at baseline and 
using VPA, 5/40 (12.5%) in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day had platelet decreases from baseline of ≥ 25% 
during T+M as did 3/46 (6.5%) in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day and 3/44 (6.8%) in the placebo groups. 
At Visit 12 among 136 subjects with platelet counts within the normal reference range at baseline and 
using VPA, 5/42 (11.9%) in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day and 6/51 (11.8%) in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day 
groups had platelet decreases from baseline of ≥ 25% during T+M as did 2/43 (4.7%) in the placebo 
group. This difference was not observed in subjects not using VPA. 
Few abnormalities observed in growth, precocious puberty, and thyroid function parameters were 
considered clinically significant changes. Treatment-emergent AEs during T+M were: blood prolactin 
increased or hyperprolactinemia (1 in the placebo group and 6 in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group); 
blood follicle stimulating hormone decreased (mild in severity, 1 subject in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day 
group);  blood testosterone decreased (mild in severity, 1 subject in the in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day 
group); blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased (3 subjects in the placebo group and 1 subject in 
the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group, mild in severity).  
Elevation in prolactin level has been previously associated with fenfluramine (Delgado 1991, Van de 
Kar 1985) and also with seizures in epilepsy (Chen 2005). Therefore, the number of subjects with ≥ 
25% increases from baseline in prolactin during T+M was evaluated, and the number of subjects who 
had a seizure event during T+M within 48 hours before a prolactin increase also was evaluated. Most 
increases from baseline in prolactin of ≥ 25%, which were more common in subjects in the ZX008 
group, were preceded by a seizure event. Elevated prolactin level ≥ 2 × upper limit of normal was 
prespecified as an AESI in Study 1601 Part 1 and Part 2 and was observed in 9 subjects. 
Vital signs: 
In ISS-SAF, treatment-emergent adverse events related to abnormal vital signs are presented in Table 
64.

13 subjects (4.9%): 5 (5.6%) in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group and 8 (9.2%) in the ZX008 0.8 
mg/kg/day group. An additional subject in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group had such a weight loss 
during the Taper/Transition Period. Of these subjects, 9 experienced loss of body weight ≥ 10% of the 
baseline value at ≥ 1 visit: 4 in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group and 5 in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day. 
Weight decrease was reported as a TEAE for 5 of the 14 subjects with body weight loss ≥ 7%: 1 in the 
ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group and 4 in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group. Decreased appetite or 
hypophagia was reported as a TEAE during the time of the weight loss for 8 of the subjects with a body 
weight decrease ≥ 7%: 2 in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group and 6 in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day 
group. Decreased appetite was reported as a non-treatment-emergent AE (reported as occurring on 
Study Day -1 through Day 128) for an additional subject in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group with a 
body weight decrease ≥ 7%. 
Body weight increase ≥ 7% of baseline value at any visit in T+M was reported for 23 (8.7%) subjects: 
12 (13.8%) in the placebo group, 5 (5.6%) in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group, and 6 (6.9%) in the 
ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group. Of these, 10 subjects experienced body weight gain ≥ 10% of the 
baseline value at ≥ 1 visit: 8 (9.2%) in the placebo group, and 2 (2.2%) in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day 
group. 
No consistent differences in the percentages of subjects having body weight losses were noted 
between the various pediatric age subgroups.

ISS-SAF Population. After 12 months of treatment in the open-label period, the mean (SD) BMI in 136 
subjects had slightly decreased from the double-blind baseline BMI by 0.580 (2.1012) kg/m2 and 137 
subjects had slightly decreased from the open-label baseline BMI by 0.276 (1.8246) kg/m2. 
The mean z-score for height at baseline in the double-blind treatment period was -0.890 SD and the 
mean z-score at Month 12 was -1.055 SD representing a decrease of 0.165 SDs in height over the 
double-blind through OLE period. For weight, the mean z-score was -0.607SD at baseline in the 
double-blind treatment period and the mean z-score at Month 12 was -1.179 SD representing a 
decrease of 0.572 SDs. Short stature is defined by individual height that is 2 SDs or more below the 
average height for age, sex, and ethnic group or more than 2 SDs below mid parental height (Barstow 
2015). 
Cardiac: 
Based on fenfluramine’s history, the ZX008 clinical development program was designed to ensure no 
subjects with pre-existing VHD or risk factors for such development entered the trials. In addition, to 
enhance safety measures, all subjects were monitored and administered only low doses of ZX008. 
The ZX008 LGS and Dravet syndrome clinical development programs, including subjects being treated 
with fenfluramine for more than 12 months, incorporated a prospectively defined, long-term 
longitudinal cardiovascular study of the heart valves, as well as evaluation for signs of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension (PAH) by 2-D Doppler echocardiogram. No PAH or structural abnormalities 
consistent with VHD were observed in any subject at any time during the LGS and Dravet syndrome 
programs. 
In Study 1601 Part 1, where trace mitral or aortic regurgitation were observed, the results were often 
transient; eg, findings at 1 visit were not always present at the following visit, with the exception of 2 
subjects. This observation was also recorded in the serial ECHOs conducted in the Dravet.  
The 2 subjects who exhibited greater than trace regurgitation in the mitral or aortic valves were: one 
12 – 18 year old subject in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group exhibited mild MR at Visit 12 (also 
considered physiologic), and one 6 – 12 year old subject in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group exhibited 
mild AR at Visit 12, which was later downgraded to absent regurgitation following a subsequent 
diagnostic transesophageal ECHO. No abnormalities were noted in valve morphology for either subject. 
For the ISS-SAF Population at the time of the data cutoff, a total of 1667 ECHOs performed on 262 
subjects were included in the summary analyses, with the mean (SD) number of ECHOs included per 
subject being 6.4 (1.94). As described in the sections below, no VHD or PAH was observed in the 
ZX008 LGS Phase 3 development program. Where trace MR or AR was observed, the results were 
often transient.

fatigue, pyrexia, somnolence, and vomiting; however, constipation, dysphagia, irritability, 
nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, seizure, and upper respiratory tract infection were additional common 
TEAEs for this subgroup. Common TEAEs reported with a ≥ 10% higher incidence in either ZX008 
group compared with the placebo group were as follows: 
• Pneumonia was reported for ≥ 10% more subjects in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group than in the 
placebo and ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day groups.  
• Constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and nasopharyngitis were reported for ≥ 10% more 
subjects in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group than in the placebo group but not the ZX008 0.8 
mg/kg/day group. 
• Dysphagia, upper respiratory tract infection, and vomiting were reported for ≥ 10% more subjects in 
the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group than in the placebo and ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day groups. 
For subjects 6 to < 12 years of age (N=72), the most common TEAEs in the ZX008 groups (≥ 10% of 
subjects in either group) were similar to the overall Safety Population: decreased appetite, diarrhea, 
fatigue, pyrexia, somnolence, and vomiting; however, constipation and upper respiratory tract 
infection were additional common TEAEs for this subgroup. Common TEAEs reported with a ≥10% 
higher incidence in either ZX008 group compared with the placebo group were as follows: 
• Decreased appetite was reported for ≥ 10% more subjects in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group than 
in the placebo group and ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. 
• Diarrhea was reported for ≥ 10% more subjects in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group than in the 
placebo group but not the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group. 
For subjects 12 to <18 years of age (N=77), the most common TEAEs in the ZX008 groups (≥ 10% of 
subjects in either group) were similar to the overall Safety Population: decreased appetite, fatigue, 
pyrexia, somnolence, and vomiting; however, asthenia, blood prolactin increased, and constipation 
were additional common TEAEs for this subgroup. Common TEAEs reported with a ≥ 10% higher 
incidence in either ZX008 group compared with the placebo group were as follows: 
• Decreased appetite was reported for ≥ 10% more subjects in both ZX008 groups than in the placebo 
group. 
• Fatigue and blood prolactin increased were reported for ≥ 10% more subjects in the ZX008 0.8 
mg/kg/day group than in the placebo and ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. 
For subjects ≥ 18 years of age (N=76), the most common TEAEs in the ZX008 groups (≥10% of 
subjects in either group) were a subset of those for the overall Safety Population: decreased appetite, 
diarrhea, and somnolence; weight decreased, and irritability were additional common TEAEs for this 
subgroup. The only common TEAEs reported with a ≥ 10% higher incidence in either ZX008 group 
compared with the placebo group were diarrhea, reported for ≥ 10% more subjects in both ZX008 
groups than in the placebo group, and decreased appetite, reported for ≥ 10% more subjects in the 
ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group than in the placebo and ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day groups. 
 For the ISS-SAF Population, the overall subject incidence of TEAEs was generally similar across the 3 
pediatric age groups, ranging from 91.7% to 94.7%. The subject incidence of TEAEs for the adult age 
group, 92.1%, was similar to the pediatric age groups. Treatment-emergent AEs experienced by ≥ 
10% of subjects in all age groups were: decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis, seizure, and somnolence. 
• For subjects 2 to < 6 years of age (N = 38), the most common TEAEs (≥ 10% of subjects) were the 
same as for the overall ISS-SAF Population and also included pneumonia, lethargy, insomnia,

irritability, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, weight decreased, pyrexia, vomiting, 
constipation, fatigue, and change in seizure presentation. 
• For subjects 6 to < 12 years of age (N = 72), the most common TEAEs (≥ 10% of subjects) were the 
same as for the overall ISS-SAF Population and also included diarrhea, upper respiratory tract 
infection, pyrexia, vomiting, constipation, fatigue, and change in seizure presentation. 
• For subjects 12 to < 18 years of age (N = 76), the most common TEAE (≥ 10% of subjects) were 
the same as for the overall ISS-SAF Population and also included asthenia, vomiting, constipation, 
fatigue, and change in seizure presentation.  
• For subjects ≥ 18 years of age (N = 76), the most common TEAEs (≥ 10% of subjects) were the 
same as for the overall ISS-SAF Population and also included diarrhea, upper respiratory tract 
infection, and irritability. 
AEDs: 
All TEAEs are presented by usage of the 3 most commonly used concomitant AEDs (ie, clobazam, 
lamotrigine, valproate). 
In double blind period, the most common TEAEs in the ZX008 groups for each concomitant AED 
subgroup were the same as those for the overall Safety Population, with the exception that pyrexia 
was not common in the valproate subgroup, and constipation, upper respiratory tract infection, and 
irritability were additional common TEAEs for the both the clobazam and lamotrigine subgroups.

Table 69 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in Part 1 by MedDRA System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term by Most Commonly Used Anti-Epileptic Medications (Cohort A – North 
America, Europe, Australia) Safety Population 
In ISS-SAF, the treatment-emergent AEs experienced by ≥ 10% of subjects in all 3 groups were: 
decreased appetite, diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, somnolence, seizure, and change in 
seizure presentation. 
Withdrawal and rebound: 
A total of 254 subjects in the Study 1601 Part 1 Safety Population received study drug during 
Taper/Transition.  
Three subjects (1.2%) experienced treatment-related TEAEs of seizure during Taper/Transition: 2 
subjects in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group and 1 subject in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group. All 
events were non-serious and considered moderate in severity, and the events resolved for all 3 
subjects. 
One subject had a severe TEAE during Taper/Transition (status epilepticus, reported for one subject in 
the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group). The event was not considered treatment related and resolved 
without a change in study drug. 
A review of subjects who experienced TEAEs during the Study 1601 Part 2 open-label taper period for 
subjects who did not enroll and continue treatment in Study 1900 showed TEAEs possibly related to

ZX008 or the tapering of ZX008 in 5 subjects. 3 were assessed as related to study drug and 1 of them 
was severe. 
• One subject was randomized to the placebo group in the double-blind treatment period and 
experienced an SAE of status epilepticus on Study Day 205, 4 days after the subject’s last dose of 
ZX008 in Study 1601 Part 2. The subject had been treated with a mean daily dose of ZX008 0.2 
mg/kg/day during the OLE period. On Study Day 198, the subject withdrew participation from the 
study, with the reason being reported as withdrawal by subject. The Investigator assessed the event of 
status epilepticus as severe and related to study drug withdrawal. The event resolved on Study Day 
205.

Post marketing experience 
Since the iMAA of Fintepla, the PRAC assessed the 2 first PSUSAs (PSUSA-10907-202112 and PSUSA-
10907-202106) and considered that the risk-benefit balance of medicinal products containing 
fenfluramine remains unchanged. 
The most recent PBRER for Fintepla was submitted to the EMA on 26 August 2022 and is under 
assessment (PSUSA-10907-202206). The MAH PBRER concluded: “During the reporting interval, no 
signals were newly identified, closed, under monitoring or awaiting evaluation. There have been no 
significant changes in the knowledge of risks or benefits of fenfluramine; therefore, the benefit-risk 
balance remains positive.”

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The main evidence of safety for Fintepla in the proposed LGS indication comes from  
- Study 1601 Part 1 Safety Population (N=263) and  
- ISS Safety Population (ISS-SAF) that consists of Study 1601 Cohort A subjects who are followed 
through Study 1601 Part 1, Part 2, or Study 1900 (N=263). 
Fenfluramine (Fintepla) is approved in the United States, European Union (EU), and United Kingdom 
(UK) for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients 2 years of age and 
older. The existing safety profile from this indication and post-marketing experience brings in 
supportive safety data. 
219 subjects with LGS have received ZX008 for ≥ 6 months, and 172 subjects have received ZX008 
for ≥ 12 months, with an overall range of ZX008 exposure from 9 to 991 days. This is considered 
satisfactory for safety assessment.  
During double-blind period, the incidence of TEAEs, treatment related TEAEs, treatment emergent 
SAEs severe TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation were all notably higher in ZX008 0.8 
mg/kg/day group. 5.7% of these events lead to discontinuation. On the other hand, during ISS-SAF, 
the subject incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug and/or the study was greatest 
at the lowest dose range group (>0 to 0.4 mg/kg/day mean daily doses) and this could be impacted by 
tapering and restarting on 0.2 mg/kg/day dose for all subjects (including ones on active arms) at the 
end of double-blind period. 
Most important TEAEs reported in the double-blind and open-label studies are known AEs associated 
with fenfluramine such as loss of appetite, weight loss, lethargy, somnolence, and fatigue. 
The most common TEAEs that occurred in ZX008-treated subjects in the double-blind Study1601 Part 
1 (≥ 10% of subjects in either group) were decreased appetite, fatigue, somnolence, diarrhoea, 
vomiting, and pyrexia. For ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group, decreased appetite 35.6%, fatigue 18.4%, 
somnolence 17.2%, diarrhoea 12.6%, constipation 9.2%, vomiting 8%, weight decreased 8%, upper 
respiratory tract infection 6.9%, lethargy 5.7% were most frequently observed TEAEs which were 
higher than placebo group in frequency. 
In ISS-SAF, the most common TEAEs reported to date (≥ 10% of subjects overall) were decreased 
appetite, somnolence, seizure, nasopharyngitis, pyrexia, fatigue, diarrhoea, vomiting, upper 
respiratory tract infection, constipation, and change in seizure presentation. TEAEs that were reported 
for ≥ 10% of subjects at any mean daily dose level and that appeared to have a dose relationship 
included pyrexia and nasopharyngitis, each of which was most common at the ZX008 ≥ 0.6 mg/kg/day 
mean daily dose level. By SOC, infections (nasopharyngitis, gastroenteritis viral, pneumonia, ear 
infection) and gastrointestinal disorders showed a tendency to increase in frequency with increased 
dose in ISS-SAF Population. The gastrointestinal events were also commonly observed during the first 
month of ZX008 treatment. 
The most common treatment-emergent SAEs (all reported in ≤ 10 [3.8%] of subjects) in the double-
blind through open-label treatment periods were change in seizure presentation (3.8%), status 
epilepticus (3.8%), pneumonia (3.1%), pneumonia aspiration (3.1%), seizure (1.5%), somnolence 
(1.5%), vomiting (1.1%), and dehydration (1.1%). For the double-blind period, a significantly higher 
percentage of patients experienced treatment-emergent SAEs in ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group (10 
patients, 11.5%) in comparison to 4 subjects (4.6%) in the placebo group, 4 subjects (4.5%) in the 
ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group. Especially gastrointestinal disorders and infections were more common in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 100/121 
 
 
 
active groups. For the ISS-SAF Population, percentage of patients who experienced treatment-
emergent SAEs increased with higher mean dose (16%, 19.5%, 26.5%). 
2 deaths have occurred, 1 due to SUDEP and 1 due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure 
(both were considered not related to study drug by the Investigators). 
In Study 1601 Part 1, a total of 21 TEAEs leading to study discontinuation in the 9 subjects in the 
ZX008 groups included somnolence, seizure, pleurothotonus, decreased appetite, vomiting, 
aggression, agitation, and lung disorder, of which 18 events were considered to be treatment-related.  
In the ISS-SAF Population, 24 (9.2%) subjects were reported as having withdrawn from treatment due 
to ≥ 1 TEAE. Events leading to treatment withdrawal that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects were seizure, 
somnolence, change in seizure presentation, decreased appetite, vomiting, fatigue, and 
echocardiogram abnormal (non-pathologic trace/physiologic regurgitation). Although rare, gait 
disturbance was one of the TEAEs leading to discontinuation. “Falls” was a previously identified signal 
in Dravet Syndrome. 
No subject has developed VHD or PAH throughout the program (important risks in RMP). Out of 262 
subjects monitored, 2 observations of mild MR/AR were noted during the program, but neither had any 
other echocardiographic signs of VHD nor any symptoms of VHD. Cardiac safety is monitored in 
ongoing Study 1900, however still limited with 3 years maximum follow up. Cardiac effects could occur 
in a longer exposure as they are related to cumulative exposure. The long-term safety is listed as 
missing information in RMP. 
Few abnormalities observed in growth, precocious puberty, and thyroid function parameters were 
considered clinically significant changes. Among these, growth retardation is an important potential 
risk in RMP, as growth scores for weight and height represented a decrease over treatment period but 
were not affected above 2SDs.   
Decreased appetite, weight loss, lethargy, somnolence, fatigue, ECG abnormal, prolactin increased are 
among identified signals. Weight loss, as an important identified risk, can be mitigated with routine 
event monitoring and medication guide/ educational materials to inform and educate prescribers and 
patients. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based on the available safety data, the CHMP concludes that the safety profile of Fintepla in the proposed 
LGS indication is acceptable. 
The highlighted safety concerns are appropriately reflected in the SmPC and will continue to be managed 
through the agreed RMP and monitored via the PSURs. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version in this application. 
The PRAC considered that the updated risk management plan is acceptable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The due date of the final PASS Registry report as 
approved in the procedure EMEA/H/C/PSP/S/0093.3 has been reflected in Annex II. 
Please see attachment 1 for full information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The justification for not testing with target patient group is that the package leaflet is essentially the 
same as the successfully tested Fintepla Package Leaflet for Dravet syndrome (DS) with the addition of 
the new indication, and the target audience is also very similar to that of DS, i.e. parents and carers of 
children and adults with a rare, severe and intractable epileptic syndrome. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a rare, severe, paediatric-onset developmental and complex epileptic 
encephalopathy. Onset of LGS occurs most commonly before the age of 11 years, with a peak between 
3 and 5 years of age. Patients with LGS account for 5% to 10% of children with seizures. LGS can be 
subdivided into cases of known origin (genetic, structural, metabolic, immune and infectious) and 
idiopathic cases. The epileptic activity itself may directly contribute additional cognitive and 
behavioural impairments over those expected from the underlying aetiology alone and that 
suppression of epileptic activity might minimize this additional impairment. 
LGS is always characterized by a triad of symptoms: multiple seizure types, slow spike-and-wave EEG, 
and abnormal cognitive development. Tonic seizures (TS), atypical absence seizures (AS), and “drop

attacks,” ie, seizures that result in sudden falls, are notable in this disorder and often result in serious 
injury. Patients with LGS also can experience milder seizures that do not result in falls, as well as many 
other seizure types, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTC), myoclonic seizures (MS), focal 
seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus.  
Nearly all patients with LGS have treatment-resistant, lifelong epilepsy. Prognosis for LGS is very poor: 
approximately 5% of patients die, 80% to 90% continue having seizures into adulthood, and most 
patients have cognitive and behavioural problems. Children and adults with LGS have an enormous 
disruptive impact on their families, and efforts to improve the quality of life for these patients are 
complex due to the severe lifelong limitations associated with drug-resistant epilepsy, intellectual 
disability, and other comorbidities. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Due to the heterogeneity in aetiology, pathophysiology, and type of seizures experienced by patients 
with LGS, many different treatments are currently tried, often with little success and a high rate of 
drug resistance. Due to the refractory nature of seizures in LGS, seizure freedom is an unlikely goal of 
treatment; a main objective is to improve the patient’s QoL via a compromise between seizure control 
of the most severe seizures, avoidance of additional comorbidities, and tolerability. A combination of 2 
or more AEDs with an individualized regimen is common. 
Currently, 9 AEDs are approved for the treatment of LGS in Europe: felbamate, topiramate, 
lamotrigine, rufinamide, clonazepam, clobazam, valproate), nitrazepam, and cannabidiol. Other 
pharmacologic (benzodiazepines, zonisamide) and nonpharmacologic treatments (ketogenic diet [KD], 
vagus nerve stimulation [VNS], surgery) also are prescribed based on clinical experience. 
The use of carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, tiagabine, and phenytoin in LGS is not 
recommended due to the potential risk of aggravation of drop attacks with a myoclonic component 
(Cross 2017). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main proof of efficacy was based on a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
Phase 3 Study 1601 Part 1 in subjects with LGS aged 2 to 35 years of age.  
The long-term effectiveness and safety is based on supportive studies: ongoing open-label, long-term 
extension part of the study, Study 1601 Part 2, and ongoing long-term extension Study 1900. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint: In pivotal Study 1601 Part 1, the median percentage reduction in DSF from 
Baseline during the 14-week T+M for subjects in the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group was 26.5%, 
compared with 7.6% for placebo (p= 0.0013). The reduction in DSF with ZX008 treatment was 
observed within 2 weeks. 
The first key secondary endpoint: The percentage of subjects achieving a clinically meaningful ≥ 50% 
reduction from Baseline in DSF during T+M (ie, 50% responder rate) was 25.3% in ZX008 0.8 
mg/kg/day group, compared with 10.3% for placebo (p = 0.0150). 
The second key secondary endpoint: CGI-I as another key secondary endpoint, did not show nominal 
significance for the ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group compared to placebo (p = 0.0567). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 112/121 
 
 
 
The third key secondary endpoint was the median percentage reduction from Baseline during the 14-
week T+M for subjects in the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group (14.2%), compared with placebo (7.6%) 
(nominal p= 0.0939).  
The fourth and fifth key secondary endpoints: The results for the ZX008 0.2 mg/kg/day group did not 
reach nominal statistical significance compared with the placebo group. 
The most common drop seizures by type on a subject basis during Baseline of Study 1601 Part 1 were 
TS, GTC, and AS. With ZX008 treatment, none of the 5 drop seizure types worsened from Baseline or 
relative to placebo, with each having a similar or greater median percentage reduction from Baseline in 
frequency during T+M, as necessary to support a positive outcome of the study. GTC seizure type had 
the largest percentage reduction from Baseline relative to placebo (> 50 percentage point difference 
[p ≤ 0.0005]). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Due to the heterogeneity in aetiology, pathophysiology, and type of seizures experienced by patients 
with LGS, many different treatments are currently tried, often with little success and a high rate of 
drug resistance. Due to the refractory nature of seizures in LGS, seizure freedom is an unlikely goal of 
treatment; a main objective is to improve the patient’s QoL via a compromise between seizure control 
of the most severe seizures, avoidance of additional comorbidities, and tolerability. A combination of 2 
or more AEDs with an individualized regimen is common. 
Currently, 9 AEDs are approved for the treatment of LGS in Europe: felbamate, topiramate, 
lamotrigine, rufinamide, clonazepam, clobazam, valproate), nitrazepam, and cannabidiol. Other 
pharmacologic (benzodiazepines, zonisamide) and nonpharmacologic treatments (ketogenic diet [KD], 
vagus nerve stimulation [VNS], surgery) also are prescribed based on clinical experience. 
The use of carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine, tiagabine, and phenytoin in LGS is not 
recommended due to the potential risk of aggravation of drop attacks with a myoclonic component 
(Cross 2017). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
219 subjects with LGS have received ZX008 for ≥ 6 months, and 172 subjects have received ZX008 
for ≥ 12 months, with an overall range of ZX008 exposure from 9 to 991 days. 
Decreased appetite, weight loss, lethargy, somnolence, fatigue, ECG abnormal, prolactin increased are 
among identified signals and are known AEs associated with fenfluramine or seizures.  
Valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension are important potential risks. With 
treatment up to 2.5 years, no VHD or PAH has been reported. Out of 262 subjects monitored, 2 
observations of mild mitral regurgitation/aortic regurgitation were noted. 
Growth retardation is an important potential risk in RMP, as growth scores for weight and height 
represented a decrease over treatment period but were not affected above 2SDs.  
The most common TEAEs that occurred in ZX008-treated subjects in the double-blind period (≥ 10% 
of subjects in either group) were decreased appetite, fatigue, somnolence, diarrhoea, vomiting, and 
pyrexia.  
In ISS-SAF Population, the most common TEAEs reported to date (≥ 10% of subjects overall) were 
decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, and seizure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/45762/2023  
Page 113/121 
 
 
 
The TEAEs with the highest incidence rates of ≥ 10 per 100 subject years of exposure in the double-
blind through open-label treatment periods were the same TEAEs as reported in Study 1601 Part 1 and 
Part 2. 
The most common treatment-emergent SAEs (all reported in ≤ 10 [3.8%] of subjects) in the double-
blind through open-label treatment periods were change in seizure presentation, status epilepticus, 
pneumonia, pneumonia aspiration, seizure, somnolence, vomiting, and dehydration. 
2 deaths have occurred, 1 due to SUDEP and 1 due to aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure 
(both were considered not related to study drug by the Investigators). 
In Study 1601 Part 1, a total of 21 TEAEs leading to study discontinuation in the 9 subjects in the 
ZX008 groups included somnolence, seizure, pleurothotonus, decreased appetite, vomiting, 
aggression, agitation, and lung disorder, of which 18 events were considered to be treatment-related.  
In the ISS-SAF Population, 24 (9.2%) subjects were reported as having withdrawn from treatment due 
to ≥ 1 TEAE. Events leading to treatment withdrawal that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects were seizure, 
somnolence, change in seizure presentation, decreased appetite, vomiting, fatigue, and 
echocardiogram abnormal (non-pathologic trace/physiologic regurgitation).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The majority of subjects treated for ≥ 12 months had received a mean daily dose of ZX008 of 0.4 to 
<0.6 mg/kg/day (although 0.8 mg/kg/day is the recommended dose and only tested dose with 
significant effect over placebo). During the double-blind period, the incidence of TEAEs, treatment 
related TEAEs, treatment emergent SAEs severe TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation were all 
notably higher in ZX008 0.8 mg/kg/day group. 5.7% of these events lead to discontinuation. On the 
other hand, during ISS-SAF, the subject incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug 
and/or the study was greatest at the lowest dose range group (>0 to 0.4 mg/kg/day mean daily 
doses) and this could be impacted by tapering and restarting on 0.2 mg/kg/day dose for all subjects 
(including ones on active arms) at the end of double-blind period. 
Valvular heart disease and PAH were risks evaluated for ZX008 based on the previously reported 
cardiotoxicity associated with fenfluramine at doses of 60 to 120 mg/day when used to treat adult 
obesity, i.e., 2 to 4 times higher than the proposed maximum daily dose (30 mg) for treatment of 
seizures in LGS. Cardiac safety is monitored in Study 1900 which is ongoing, however still limited with 
3 years maximum follow up. Cardiac effects could occur in a longer exposure as they are related to 
cumulative exposure. LGS population is usually young and require long term treatment.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
With 0.8 mg/kg/day dose, Study 1601 Part 1 (double-blind) met its primary objective and has shown 
26.5% decrease in median change from baseline in drop seizure frequency during treatment and 
maintenance periods. It is considered a clinically relevant effect size. This was supported by key 
secondary endpoint testing the 50% responder rate for this dose during the same period, and 25.3% 
of patients in the fenfluramine group compared with 10.3% in the placebo group achieved this 
endpoint. This is considered as clinically significant. Both endpoints supporting the efficacy for ZX008 
0.8 mg/kg/day dose is reassuring.  
Results with 0.2 mg/kg/day group versus placebo were not significant for the change from baseline in 
DSF and this dose is not recommended for clinical use. 
Supportive results for effect of 0.8 mg/kg/day were observed with supplemental or sensitivity analyses 
of primary objective (during maintenance period only [27.2% vs 7.3% for placebo], using PP 
population, excluding extreme outliers, not imputing for seizure clusters, and using 2 different 
methods for imputation of missing data due to subject dropout, using Wilcoxon rank-sum test, by 
seizure type,  …) and other secondary or exploratory endpoints such as percentage of subjects with 
improvement on CGI-I investigator rating. No significant increases in any seizure types, no notable 
difference in new seizure types or incidence of status epilepticus are reassuring. 
Decreased appetite, weight loss, lethargy, somnolence, fatigue, ECG abnormal, prolactin increased are 
among identified signals and are known AEs associated with fenfluramine or seizures. Valvular heart 
disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and growth retardation remain as important potential risks. 
Further discussions are due on infections, gastrointestinal disorders, status epilepticus, falls.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy on reduction in drop seizure frequency for Fintepla 0.8 mg/kg/day (one of the two doses 
tested in Study 1601 Part 1) was demonstrated in a study of adequate design and Fintepla 0.8 
mg/kg/day dose appears to have a manageable safety profile for treatment of LGS patients with a 
5.7% discontinuation rate.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Fintepla for the extension of the indication for LGS is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by a majority of 28 out of 29 votes, the variation to the terms of the Marketing 
Authorisation, concerning the following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected

of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome as 
an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients 2 years of age and older.  As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. The due date of the final PASS Registry report as approved in the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSP/S/0093.3 has been reflected in Annex II. Version 2.11 of the RMP has also been 
agreed. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Fintepla is not similar to Epidyolex within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200 (See appendix 1).  
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

Fintepla EMEA/H/C/003933/II/0012 
The undersigned member of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending

Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
Repatha is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial 
infarction, stroke or peripheral arterial disease) to reduce cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C 
levels, as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors: 
• 
in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other lipid-lowering 
therapies or, 
alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, 
or for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
• 
For study results with respect to effects on LDL-C, cardiovascular events and populations studied see 
section 5.1. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Prior to initiating evolocumab, secondary causes of hyperlipidaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia (e.g., 
nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism) should be excluded. 
Posology 
Primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia (including heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia) 
Adults and paediatric patients (aged 10 years and over) 
The recommended dose of evolocumab is either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly; 
both doses are clinically equivalent. 
Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in adults and paediatric patients aged 10 years and over 
The initial recommended dose is 420 mg once monthly. After 12 weeks of treatment, dose frequency 
can be up-titrated to 420 mg once every 2 weeks if a clinically meaningful response is not achieved. 
Patients on apheresis may initiate treatment with 420 mg every two weeks to correspond with their 
apheresis schedule. 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in adults 
The recommended dose of evolocumab is either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly; 
both doses are clinically equivalent. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years) 
No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. 
Patients with renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment, see section 4.4 for patients 
with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and effectiveness of Repatha have not been established in paediatric patients with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) or homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
(HoFH) who are younger than 10 years old or in paediatric patients with other types of 
hyperlipidaemia.

Method of administration 
Subcutaneous use. 
Evolocumab is for subcutaneous injection into the abdomen, thigh or upper arm region. Injection sites 
should be rotated and injections should not be given into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, 
or hard. 
Evolocumab must not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 
Repatha 140 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
The 140 mg dose should be delivered using a single pre-filled syringe. 
The 420 mg dose should be delivered using three pre-filled syringes administered consecutively within 
30 minutes. 
Repatha 140 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
The 140 mg dose should be delivered using a single pre-filled pen. 
The 420 mg dose should be delivered using three pre-filled pens administered consecutively within 
30 minutes. 
Repatha 420 mg solution for injection in cartridge 
The 420 mg dose should be delivered using a single cartridge with the automated mini-doser. 
Repatha is intended for patient self-administration after proper training. Administration of evolocumab 
can also be performed by an individual who has been trained to administer the product. 
For single use only. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, a reduction in total evolocumab exposure was observed 
that may lead to a reduced effect on LDL-C reduction. Therefore, close monitoring may be warranted 
in these patients. 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) have not been studied (see section 5.2). 
Evolocumab should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Dry natural rubber 
Repatha 140 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
The needle cover of the glass pre-filled syringe is made from dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), 
which may cause severe allergic reactions. 
Repatha 140 mg solution for injection in pre-filled pen 
The needle cover of the pre-filled pen is made from dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which 
may cause severe allergic reactions.

Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
The pharmacokinetic interaction between statins and evolocumab was evaluated in the clinical trials. 
An approximately 20% increase in the clearance of evolocumab was observed in patients co-
administered statins. This increased clearance is in part mediated by statins increasing the 
concentration of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) which did not adversely 
impact the pharmacodynamic effect of evolocumab on lipids. No statin dose adjustments are necessary 
when used in combination with evolocumab. 
No studies on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics interaction between evolocumab and lipid-
lowering medicinal products other than statins and ezetimibe have been conducted. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of Repatha in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). 
Repatha should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with evolocumab. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether evolocumab is excreted in human milk. 
A risk to breastfed newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or discontinue/abstain from Repatha 
therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the 
woman. 
Fertility 
No data on the effect of evolocumab on human fertility are available. Animal studies did not show any 
effects on fertility endpoints at area under the concentration time curve (AUC) exposure levels much 
higher than in patients receiving evolocumab at 420 mg once monthly (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Repatha has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

1 See section Description of selected adverse reactions. 
The safety profile was consistent between subjects with post-baseline LDL-C < 25 mg/dL 
(0.65 mmol/L) or < 40 mg/dL(1.03 mmol/L) compared to subjects with higher post-baseline LDL-C 
(≥ 40 mg/dL[1.03 mmol/L]), with median (Q1, Q3) Repatha exposure of 84.2 (78.1, 89.8) months in 
subjects who continued on Repatha and 59.8 (52.8, 60.3) months in subjects on placebo who switched 
to Repatha in an open-label extension study. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Injection site reactions 
The most frequent injection site reactions were injection site bruising, erythema, haemorrhage, 
injection site pain, and swelling. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and effectiveness of Repatha have been established in paediatric patients with heterozygous 
and homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. A clinical study to evaluate the effects of Repatha 
was conducted in 158 paediatric patients aged ≥ 10 to < 18 years old with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia. No new safety concerns were identified and the safety data in this paediatric 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
population was consistent with the known safety profile of the product in adults with heterozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia. Twenty-six paediatric patients with homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia have been treated with Repatha in clinical studies conducted in patients aged 
≥ 10 to < 18 years. No difference in safety was observed between paediatric and adult patients with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. 
Elderly population 
Of the 18,546 patients treated with evolocumab in double-blind clinical studies 7,656 (41.3%) were 
≥ 65 years old, while 1,500 (8.1%) were ≥ 75 years old. No overall differences in safety or efficacy 
were observed between these patients and younger patients. 
Immunogenicity 
In clinical studies, 0.3% of patients (48 out of 17,992 patients) treated with at least one dose of 
evolocumab tested positive for binding antibody development. The patients whose sera tested positive 
for binding antibodies were further evaluated for neutralising antibodies and none of the patients tested 
positive for neutralising antibodies. The presence of anti-evolocumab binding antibodies did not 
impact the pharmacokinetic profile, clinical response, or safety of evolocumab. 
The development of anti-evolocumab antibodies was not detected in clinical trials of paediatric 
patients treated with Repatha. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No adverse effects were observed in animal studies at exposures up to 300-fold higher than those in 
patients treated with 420 mg evolocumab once monthly. 
There is no specific treatment for evolocumab overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient 
should be treated symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted as required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: lipid modifying agents, other lipid modifying agents. ATC code: 
C10AX13 
Mechanism of action 
Evolocumab binds selectively to PCSK9 and prevents circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low 
density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on the liver cell surface, thus preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR 
degradation. Increasing liver LDLR levels results in associated reductions in serum LDL-cholesterol 
(LDL-C). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In clinical trials, evolocumab reduced unbound PCSK9, LDL-C, TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, 
ApoB/ApoA1, VLDL-C, TG and Lp(a), and increased HDL-C and ApoA1 in patients with primary 
hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia. 
A single subcutaneous administration of 140 mg or 420 mg evolocumab resulted in maximum 
suppression of circulating unbound PCSK9 by 4 hours followed by a reduction in LDL-C reaching a 
mean nadir in response by 14 and 21 days, respectively. Changes in unbound PCSK9 and serum 
lipoproteins were reversible upon discontinuation of evolocumab. No increase in unbound PCSK9 or 
LDL-C above baseline was observed during the washout of evolocumab suggesting that compensatory 
mechanisms to increase production of PCSK9 and LDL-C do not occur during treatment. 
Subcutaneous regimens of 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly were equivalent in 
average LDL-C lowering (mean of weeks 10 and 12) resulting in -72% to -57% from baseline 
compared with placebo. Treatment with evolocumab resulted in a similar reduction of LDL-C when 
used alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies. 
Clinical efficacy in primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
LDL-C reduction of approximately 55% to 75% was achieved with evolocumab as early as week 1 
and maintained during long-term therapy. Maximal response was generally achieved within 1 to 
2 weeks after dosing with 140 mg every 2 weeks and 420 mg once monthly. Evolocumab was 
effective in all subgroups relative to placebo and ezetimibe, with no notable differences observed 
between subgroups, such as age, race, gender, region, body-mass index, National Cholesterol 
Education Program risk, current smoking status, baseline coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, 
family history of premature CHD, glucose tolerance status, (i.e. diabetes mellitus type 2, metabolic 
syndrome, or neither), hypertension, statin dose and intensity, unbound baseline PCSK9, baseline 
LDL-C and baseline TG. 
In 80-85% of all primary hyperlipidaemia patients treated with either dose, evolocumab demonstrated 
a ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C at the mean of weeks 10 and 12. Up to 99% of patients treated with 
either dose of evolocumab achieved an LDL-C of < 2.6 mmol/L and up to 95% achieved an LDL-C 
< 1.8 mmol/L at the mean of weeks 10 and 12. 
Combination with a statin and statin with other lipid-lowering therapies 
LAPLACE-2 was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, 12-week study in 
1,896 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia who were randomised to 
receive evolocumab in combination with statins (rosuvastatin, simvastatin or atorvastatin). 
Evolocumab was compared to placebo for the rosuvastatin and simvastatin groups and compared with 
placebo and ezetimibe for the atorvastatin group. 
Repatha significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline to mean of weeks 10 and 12 compared with 
placebo for the rosuvastatin and simvastatin groups and compared with placebo and ezetimibe for the 
atorvastatin group (p < 0.001). Repatha significantly reduced TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, 
ApoB/ApoA1, VLDL-C, TG and Lp(a) and increased HDL-C from baseline to mean of weeks 10 
and 12 as compared to placebo for the rosuvastatin and simvastatin groups (p < 0.05) and significantly 
reduced TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, ApoB/ApoA1 and Lp(a), compared with placebo and 
ezetimibe for the atorvastatin group (p < 0.001) (see tables 2 and 3). 
RUTHERFORD-2 was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
12-week study in 329 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia on lipid-lowering 
therapies. Repatha significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline to mean of weeks 10 and 12 compared 
with placebo (p < 0.001). Repatha significantly reduced TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, 
ApoB/ApoA1, VLDL-C, TG and Lp(a) and increased HDL-C and ApoA1 from baseline to mean of 
weeks 10 and 12 compared to placebo (p < 0.05) (see table 2).

Statin intolerant patients 
GAUSS-2 was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, ezetimibe-controlled, 12-week 
study in 307 patients who were statin-intolerant or unable to tolerate an effective dose of a statin. 
Repatha significantly reduced LDL-C compared with ezetimibe (p < 0.001). Repatha significantly 
reduced TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, ApoB/ApoA1 and Lp(a), from baseline to mean of 
weeks 10 and 12 compared to ezetimibe (p < 0.001) (see table 3). 
Treatment in the absence of a statin 
MENDEL-2 was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo and ezetimibe-
controlled, 12-week study of Repatha in 614 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed 
dyslipidaemia. Repatha significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline to mean of weeks 10 and 12 
compared with both placebo and ezetimibe (p < 0.001). Repatha significantly reduced TC, ApoB, 
non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, ApoB/ApoA1 and Lp(a), from baseline to mean of weeks 10 and 12 
compared with both placebo and ezetimibe (p < 0.001) (see table 3).

Long-term efficacy in primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia 
DESCARTES was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
52-week study in 901 patients with hyperlipidaemia who received diet alone, atorvastatin, or a 
combination of atorvastatin and ezetimibe. Repatha 420 mg once monthly significantly reduced 
LDL-C from baseline at 52 weeks compared with placebo (p < 0.001). Treatment effects were 
sustained over 1 year as demonstrated by reduction in LDL-C from week 12 to week 52. Reduction in 
LDL-C from baseline at week 52 compared with placebo was consistent across background lipid-
lowering therapies optimised for LDL-C and cardiovascular risk. 
Repatha significantly reduced TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, ApoB/ApoA1, VLDL-C, TG and 
Lp(a), and increased HDL-C and ApoA1 at week 52 compared with placebo (p < 0.001) (see table 4).

OSLER and OSLER-2 were two randomised, controlled, open-label extension studies to assess the 
long-term safety and efficacy of Repatha in patients who completed treatment in a ‘parent’ study. In 
each extension study, patients were randomised 2:1 to receive either Repatha plus standard of care 
(evolocumab group) or standard of care alone (control group) for the first year of the study. At the end 
of the first year (week 52 in OSLER and week 48 in OSLER-2), patients entered the all Repatha 
period in which all patients received open-label Repatha for either another 4 years (OSLER) or 2 years 
(OSLER-2). 
A total of 1,324 patients enrolled in OSLER. Repatha 420 mg once monthly significantly reduced 
LDL-C from baseline at week 12 and week 52 compared with control (nominal p < 0.001). Treatment 
effects were maintained over 272 weeks as demonstrated by reduction in LDL-C from week 12 in the 
parent study to week 260 in the open-label extension. A total of 3,681 patients enrolled in OSLER-2. 
Repatha significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline at week 12 and week 48 compared with control

(nominal p < 0.001). Treatment effects were maintained as demonstrated by reduction in LDL-C from 
week 12 to week 104 in the open-label extension. Repatha significantly reduced TC, ApoB, 
non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, ApoB/ApoA1, VLDL-C, TG and Lp(a), and increased HDL-C and ApoA1 
from baseline to week 52 in OSLER and to week 48 in OSLER-2 compared with control (nominal 
p < 0.001). LDL-C and other lipid parameters returned to baseline within 12 weeks after 
discontinuation of Repatha at the beginning of OSLER or OSLER-2 without evidence of rebound. 
TAUSSIG was a multicentre, open-label, 5-year extension study to assess the long-term safety and 
efficacy of Repatha, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies, in patients with severe familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (FH), including homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. A total of 194 
severe familial hypercholesterolaemia (non-HoFH) patients and 106 homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia patients enrolled in TAUSSIG. All patients in the study were initially treated 
with Repatha 420 mg once monthly, except for those receiving lipid apheresis at enrolment who began 
with Repatha 420 mg once every 2 weeks. Dose frequency in non-apheresis patients could be titrated 
up to 420 mg once every 2 weeks based on LDL-C response and PCSK9 levels. Long-term use of 
Repatha demonstrated a sustained treatment effect as evidenced by reduction of LDL-C in patients 
with severe familial hypercholesterolaemia (non-HoFH) (see table 5). 
Changes in other lipid parameters (TC, ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and ApoB/ApoA1) also 
demonstrated a sustained effect of long-term Repatha administration in patients with severe familial 
hypercholesterolaemia (non-HoFH).

Treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in paediatric patients 
HAUSER-RCT was a randomized, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, 
24-week trial in 158 paediatric patients aged 10 to < 18 years with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia. Patients were required to be on a low-fat diet and must have been receiving 
optimized background lipid-lowering therapy (statin at optimal dose, not requiring up titration). 
Enrolled patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 24 weeks of subcutaneous once monthly 
420 mg Repatha or placebo. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in this trial was percent change from baseline to week 24 in LDL-C. 
The difference between Repatha and placebo in mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline to 
week 24 was 38% (95% CI: 45%, 31%; p < 0.0001). The least squares mean Standard Error (SE) 
reduction (p < 0.0001) in LDL-C from baseline at week 24 was 44% (2%) in the Repatha group and 
6% (3%) in the placebo group. Mean absolute LDL-C values at week 24 were 104 mg/dL in the 
Repatha group and 172 mg/dL in the placebo group. Reductions in LDL-C were observed by the first 
post-baseline assessment at the week 12 time point and were maintained throughout the trial. 
The secondary endpoint of this trial was mean percent change from baseline to weeks 22 and 24 in 
LDL-C, where week 22 reflects the peak and week 24 the trough of the subcutaneous once monthly 
dosing interval, and provides information about the time-averaged effect of Repatha therapy over the 
entire dosing interval. The least squares mean treatment difference between Repatha and placebo in 
mean percent change in LDL-C from baseline to the mean of week 22 and week 24 was 42% (95% CI: 
48%, 36%; p < 0.0001). For additional results, see table 6.

HAUSER-OLE was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, 80 week study of Repatha in 
150 paediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with HeFH that rolled-over from HAUSER-RCT and 
enrolled 13 de novo paediatric HoFH patients. Patients had to be on a low-fat diet and receiving 
background lipid-lowering therapy. All HeFH patients in this study received 420 mg Repatha 
subcutaneously once monthly (median exposure duration: 18.4 months). The mean (SE) percent 
changes in calculated LDL-C from baseline were: -44.4% (1.7%) at week 12, -41.0% (2.1%) at 
week 48, and -35.2% (2.5%) at week 80. 
The mean (SE) percent change from baseline to week 80 in other lipid endpoints 
were: -32.1% (2.3%) non-HDL-C, -25.1% (2.3%) ApoB, -28.5% (2.0%) TC/HDL-C 
ratio, -30.3% (2.2%) ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, and -24.9% (1.9%) TC. 
Treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
TESLA was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 12-week 
study in 49 homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia patients aged 12 to 65 years. Repatha 420 mg 
once monthly, as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, bile-acid sequestrants), 
significantly reduced LDL-C and ApoB at week 12 compared with placebo (p < 0.001) (see table 7). 
Changes in other lipid parameters (TC, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and ApoB/ApoA1) also 
demonstrated a treatment effect of Repatha administration in patients with homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia.

Long-term efficacy in homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
In TAUSSIG, long-term use of Repatha demonstrated a sustained treatment effect as evidenced by 
reduction of LDL-C of approximately 20% to 30% in patients with homozygous familial 
hypercholesterolaemia not on apheresis and approximately 10% to 30% in patients with homozygous 
familial hypercholesterolaemia on apheresis (see table 8). Changes in other lipid parameters (TC, 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ApoB, non-HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, and ApoB/ApoA1) also demonstrated a sustained effect of long-term 
Repatha administration in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Reductions in 
LDL-C and changes in other lipid parameters in 14 adolescent patients (aged ≥ 12 to < 18 years) with 
homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia are comparable to those in the overall population of 
patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.

HAUSER-OLE was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, 80-week trial in 12 HofH subjects to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Repatha for LDL-C reduction in paediatric patients 
from aged ≥ 10 to < 18 years of age with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Patients had to 
be on a low-fat diet and receiving background lipid-lowering therapy. All patients in the study 
received 420 mg Repatha subcutaneously once monthly. Median (Q1, Q3) LDL-C at baseline was 398 
(343, 475) mg/dL. The median (Q1, Q3) percent change in LDL-C from baseline to week 80 
was -14% (-41, 4). Reductions in LDL-C were observed by the first assessment at week 12 and was 
maintained throughout the trial, median (Q1, Q3) reductions ranging between 12% (-3, 32) and 15% 
(-4, 39). For additional results, please see table 9.

Effect on atherosclerotic disease burden 
The effects of Repatha 420 mg once monthly on atherosclerotic disease burden, as measured by 
intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), were evaluated in a 78-week double-blind, randomised, placebo 
controlled study in 968 patients with coronary artery disease on a stable background of optimal statin 
therapy. Repatha reduced both percent atheroma volume (PAV; 1.01% [95% CI 0.64, 1.38], 
p < 0.0001) and total atheroma volume (TAV; 4.89 mm3 [95% CI 2.53, 7.25], p < 0.0001) compared 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with placebo. Atherosclerotic regression was observed in 64.3% (95% CI 59.6, 68.7) and 47.3% 
(95% CI 42.6, 52.0) of patients who received Repatha or placebo respectively, when measured by 
PAV. When measured by TAV, atherosclerotic regression was observed in 61.5% (95% CI 56.7, 66.0) 
and 48.9% (95% CI 44.2, 53.7) of patients who received Repatha or placebo respectively. The study 
did not investigate the correlation between atherosclerotic disease regression and cardiovascular 
events. 
Effect on coronary atherosclerotic plaque morphology 
The effects of Repatha 420 mg once monthly on coronary atherosclerotic plaques as assessed by 
optical coherence tomography (OCT), were evaluated in a 52-week double-blind, randomised, placebo 
controlled study including adult patients initiated within 7 days of a non-ST-segment elevation acute 
coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) on maximally tolerated statin therapy. For the primary endpoint of 
absolute change in minimum FCT (fibrous cap thickness) in a matched segment of artery from 
baseline, least squares (LS) mean (95% CI) increased from baseline by 42.7 μm (32.4, 53.1) in the 
Repatha group and 21.5 μm (10.9, 32.1) in the placebo group, an additional 21.2 μm (4.7, 37.7) 
compared to placebo (p = 0.015; 38% difference (p = 0.041)). The reported secondary findings show 
treatment differences including change in mean minimum FCT (increase 32.5 µm (12.7, 52.4); 
p = 0.016) and absolute change in maximum lipid arc (-26° (-49.6, -2.4); p = 0.041). 
Cardiovascular risk reduction in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
The Repatha Outcomes Study (FOURIER) was a randomised, event-driven, double-blind study of 
27,564 subjects, aged between 40 and 86 years (mean age 62.5 years), with established atherosclerotic 
CV disease; 81% had a prior MI event, 19% had a prior stroke event and 13% had peripheral arterial 
disease. Over 99% of patients were on moderate to high intensity statin and at least one other 
cardiovascular medicine such as anti-platelet agents, beta blockers, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers; median (Q1, Q3) baseline LDL-C was 2.4 mmol/L 
(2.1, 2.8). Absolute CV risk was balanced between treatment groups, in addition to the index event all 
patients had at least 1 major or 2 minor CV risk factors; 80% had hypertension, 36% had diabetes 
mellitus, and 28% were daily smokers. Patients were randomised 1:1 to either Repatha (140 mg every 
two weeks or 420 mg once every month) or matching placebo; the mean duration of patient follow-up 
was 26 months. 
A substantial reduction of LDL-C was observed throughout the study, with achieved median LDL-C 
ranges of 0.8 to 0.9 mmol/L at each assessment; 25% of patients achieved a LDL-C concentration less 
than 0.5 mmol/L. Despite the very low levels of LDL-C achieved, no new safety issues were observed 
(see section 4.8); the frequencies of new onset diabetes and cognitive events were comparable in 
patients who achieved LDL-C levels < 0.65 mmol/L and those with higher LDL-C. 
Repatha significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular events defined as the composite of time to 
first CV death, MI, stroke, coronary revascularisation, or hospitalisation for unstable angina (see 
table 10); the Kaplan-Meier curves for the primary and key secondary composite endpoints separated 
at approximately 5 months (see figure 1 for the MACE three year Kaplan-Meier curve). The relative 
risk of the MACE composite (CV death, MI, or stroke) was significantly reduced by 20%. The 
treatment effect was consistent across all subgroups (including age, type of disease, baseline LDL-C, 
baseline statin intensity, ezetimibe use, and diabetes) and was driven by a reduction in the risk of 
myocardial infarction, stroke and coronary revascularisation; no significant difference was seen on 
cardiovascular or all-cause mortality however the study was not designed to detect such a difference.

FOURIER-OLE (study 1 and study 2) consisted of two open-label, single-arm, multicenter, extension 
studies to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Repatha in patients with 
established cardiovascular disease who completed the FOURIER study. Enrolled patients received 
Repatha 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg once monthly for approximately 5 years and continued 
moderate- (22.2%) or high-intensity (74.8%) background statin therapy. Of the 5 031 patients who 
received at least one dose of Repatha in study 1, 2 499 patients received Repatha and 2 532 patients 
received placebo in the FOURIER study. Of the 1 599 patients who received at least one dose of 
Repatha in study 2 854 patients received Repatha and 745 patients received placebo in the FOURIER 
study. Upon completion of study 1 and study 2, patients randomized to Repatha in the FOURIER 
study had up to 8.4 years (median 85.4 months) and 8.0 years of total Repatha exposure median 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
80.2 months) and patients randomized to placebo had up to 5.25 years (median 60.0 months) and 4.9 
years of total Repatha exposure (median 55.1 months), respectively.  
In study 1 and 2 combined, 72.4% (n = 4 802) of patients achieved a lowest post-baseline 
LDL-C < 25 mg/dL (0.65 mmol/L), 87.0% (n = 5 765) of patients achieved an LDL-C < 40 mg/dL 
(1.03 mmol/L), and 11.9% (n = 792) of patients had an all post-baseline LDL-C ≥ 40 mg/dL (1.03 
mmol/L).  Of the patients who achieved post-baseline low LDL-C (< 25 mg/dL or < 40 mg/dL), the 
overall subject incidences of treatment emergent adverse events were 80.0% patients who achieved 
LDL-C < 25 mg/dL and 82.7% in patients who achieved LDL-C < 40 mg/dL compared to 85.0% in 
patients with LDL-C ≥ 40 mg/dL.  The overall subject incidences of serious treatment emergent 
adverse events were 37.7% in patients who achieved LDL-C < 25 mg/dL and 40.0% in patients who 
achieved LDL-C < 40 mg/dL compared to 41.5% in patients with LDL-C ≥ 40 mg/dL. 
The mean percent reduction from baseline in LDL-C was stable during the OLE study period and 
ranged from 53.4% to 59.1% for study 1 and 62.5% to 67.2% for study 2, regardless of the patient’s 
original randomised treatment group in the FOURIER study. This appears to translate into a 
numerically lower subject incidence rate of adjudicated exploratory CV endpoints of the composite of 
CV death, MI and stroke for patients who had received Repatha in both the FOURIER and FOURIER 
OLE studies compared with patients who had received placebo in the FOURIER study and Repatha in 
the FOURIER OLE studies. 
Overall, no new safety findings were identified in these studies. 
Effect on LDL-C during acute phase of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) 
EVOPACS was a single country, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 8-week 
study on 308 ACS patients with evolocumab initiated in-hospital within 24 to 72 hours of presentation. 
If patients were not on a statin or were on statin treatment other than atorvastatin 40 mg prior to 
screening, this was stopped and atorvastatin 40 mg once daily was initiated. Randomisation was 
stratified by study centre and presence of stable statin treatment within ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrolment. 
Most subjects (241 [78%]) were not on stable statin treatment for ≥ 4 weeks prior to screening and 
most (235 [76%]) were not taking a statin at baseline. By week 4, 281 (97%) subjects were receiving 
high-intensity statins. Evolocumab 420 mg once monthly significantly reduced LDL-C from baseline 
to week 8 compared with placebo (p < 0.001). The mean (SD) reduction in calculated LDL-C from 
baseline at week 8 was 77.1% (15.8%) in the evolocumab group and 35.4% (26.6%) in the placebo 
group with a least squares (LS) mean difference (95% CI) of 40.7% (36.2%, 45.2%). Baseline LDL-C 
values were 3.61 mmol/L (139.5 mg/dL) in the evolocumab group and 3.42 mmol/L (132.2 mg/dL) in 
the placebo group. LDL-C reductions in this study were consistent with previous studies where 
evolocumab was added to stable lipid-lowering therapy as demonstrated by on-treatment LDL-C 
levels at week 8 in this study (reflecting steady-state effect of high-intensity statin in both treatment 
arms) of 0.79 mmol/L (30.5 mg/dL) and 2.06 mmol/L (79.7 mg/dL) in the evolocumab plus 
atorvastatin and the placebo plus atorvastatin groups, respectively. 
The effects of evolocumab in this patient population were consistent with those observed in previous 
studies in evolocumab clinical development program and no new safety concerns were noted. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption and distribution 
Following a single subcutaneous dose of 140 mg or 420 mg evolocumab administered to healthy 
adults, median peak serum concentrations were attained in 3 to 4 days. Administration of single 
subcutaneous dose of 140 mg resulted in a Cmax mean (SD) of 13.0 (10.4) μg/mL and AUClast mean 
(SD) of 96.5 (78.7) day•μg/mL. Administration of single subcutaneous dose 420 mg resulted in a Cmax 
mean (SD) of 46.0 (17.2) μg/mL and AUClast mean (SD) of 842 (333) day•μg/mL. Three subcutaneous 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
140 mg doses were bioequivalent to a single subcutaneous 420 mg dose. The absolute bioavailability 
after SC dosing was determined to be 72% from pharmacokinetic models. 
Following a single 420 mg evolocumab intravenous dose, the mean (SD) steady-state volume of 
distribution was estimated to be 3.3 (0.5) L, suggesting evolocumab has limited tissue distribution. 
Biotransformation 
Evolocumab is composed solely of amino acids and carbohydrates as native immunoglobulin and is 
unlikely to be eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms. Its metabolism and elimination are 
expected to follow the immunoglobulin clearance pathways, resulting in degradation to small peptides 
and individual amino acids. 
Elimination 
Evolocumab was estimated to have an effective half-life of 11 to 17 days. 
In patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia on high dose statin, the 
systemic exposure of evolocumab was slightly lower than in subjects on low-to-moderate dose statin 
(the ratio of AUClast 0.74 [90% CI 0.29; 1.9]). An approximately 20% increase in the clearance is in 
part mediated by statins increasing the concentration of PCSK9 which did not adversely impact the 
pharmacodynamic effect of evolocumab on lipids. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated no 
appreciable differences in evolocumab serum concentrations in hypercholesterolaemic patients (non-
familial hypercholesterolaemia or familial hypercholesterolaemia) taking concomitant statins. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Following a single 420 mg intravenous dose, the mean (SD) systemic clearance was estimated to be 
12 (2) mL/hr. In clinical studies with repeated subcutaneous dosing over 12 weeks, dose proportional 
increases in exposure were observed with dose regimens of 140 mg and greater. An approximate two 
to three-fold accumulation was observed in trough serum concentrations (Cmin (SD) 7.21 (6.6)) 
following 140 mg doses every 2 weeks or following 420 mg doses administered monthly (Cmin (SD) 
11.2 (10.8)), and serum trough concentrations approached steady-state by 12 weeks of dosing. 
No time dependent changes were observed in serum concentrations over a period of 124 weeks. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Data from the evolocumab clinical 
trials did not reveal a difference in pharmacokinetics of evolocumab in patients with mild or moderate 
renal impairment relative to non-renally impaired patients. 
In a clinical trial of 18 patients with either normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
[eGFR] ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, n = 6), severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
n = 6), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis (n = 6), exposure to unbound 
evolocumab as assessed by Cmax after a single 140 mg subcutaneous dose was decreased by 30% in 
patients with severe renal impairment and by 45% in patients with ESRD receiving haemodialysis. 
Exposure as assessed by AUClast was decreased by approximately 24% in patients with severe renal 
impairment and by approximately 45% in patients with ESRD receiving haemodialysis. The exact 
mechanism of PK differences is unknown; however, differences in body weight could not explain 
these differences. Some factors including small sample size and large inter-subject variability should 
be considered when interpreting the results. The pharmacodynamics and safety of evolocumab in 
patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD were similar to patients with normal renal function, 
and there were no clinically meaningful differences in LDL-C lowering. Therefore, no dose 
adjustments are necessary in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD receiving haemodialysis. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). 
Single 140 mg subcutaneous doses of evolocumab were studied in 8 patients with mild hepatic 
impairment, 8 patients with moderate hepatic impairment and 8 healthy subjects. The exposure to 
evolocumab was found to be approximately 40-50% lower compared to healthy subjects. However, 
baseline PCSK9 levels and the degree and time course of PCSK9 neutralisation were found to be 
similar between patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers. This 
resulted in similar time course and extent of absolute LDL-C lowering. Evolocumab has not been 
studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) (see section 4.4). 
Body weight 
Body weight was a significant covariate in population PK analysis impacting evolocumab trough 
concentrations, however there was no impact on LDL-C reduction. Following repeat subcutaneous 
administration of 140 mg every 2 weeks, the 12-week trough concentrations were 147% higher and 
70% lower in patients of 69 kg and 93 kg respectively, than that of the typical 81 kg subject. Less 
impact from body weight was seen with repeated subcutaneous evolocumab 420 mg monthly doses. 
Other special populations 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that no dose adjustments are necessary for age, race or 
gender. The pharmacokinetics of evolocumab were influenced by body weight without having any 
notable effect on LDL-C lowering. Therefore, no dose adjustments are necessary based on body 
weight. 
The pharmacokinetics of Repatha were evaluated in 103 paediatric patients aged ≥ 10 to < 18 years 
with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HAUSER-RCT). Following subcutaneous 
administration of 420 mg Repatha once monthly, mean (SD) trough serum concentrations were 22.4 
(14.7) mcg/mL, 64.9 (34.4) mcg/mL and 25.8 (19.2) mcg/mL over the Week 12, Week 22 and 
Week 24 time points, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of Repatha were evaluated in 12 paediatric 
patients aged ≥ 10 to < 18 years with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HAUSER-OLE). 
Following subcutaneous administration of 420 mg Repatha once monthly, mean (SD) serum trough 
concentrations were 20.3 (14.6) mcg/mL and 17.6 (28.6) mcg/mL at Week 12 and Week 80, 
respectively. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Evolocumab was not carcinogenic in hamsters at exposures much higher than patients receiving 
evolocumab at 420 mg once monthly. The mutagenic potential of evolocumab has not been evaluated. 
In hamsters and cynomolgus monkeys at exposures much higher than patients receiving 420 mg 
evolocumab once monthly, no effect on male or female fertility was observed. 
In cynomolgus monkeys at exposures much higher than patients receiving 420 mg evolocumab once 
monthly, no effects on embryo-foetal or postnatal development (up to 6 months of age) were observed. 
Apart from a reduced T-cell Dependent Antibody Response in cynomolgus monkeys immunised with 
keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) after 3 months of treatment with evolocumab, no adverse effects 
were observed in hamsters (up to 3 months) and cynomolgus monkeys (up to 6 months) at exposures 
much higher than patients receiving evolocumab at 420 mg once monthly. The intended 
pharmacological effect of decreased serum LDL-C and total cholesterol were observed in these studies 
and was reversible upon cessation of treatment. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In combination with rosuvastatin for 3 months, no adverse effects were observed in cynomolgus 
monkeys at exposures much higher than patients receiving 420 mg evolocumab once monthly. 
Reductions in serum LDL-C and total cholesterol were more pronounced than observed previously 
with evolocumab alone, and were reversible upon cessation of treatment.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Repatha is and what it is used for 
What Repatha is and how it works 
Repatha is a medicine that lowers levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol, a type of fat, in the blood. 
Repatha contains the active substance evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised 
protein designed to attach to a target substance in the body). Evolocumab is designed to attach to a 
substance called PCSK9 that affects the liver’s ability to take in cholesterol. By attaching to, and 
mopping up PCSK9, the medicine increases the amount of cholesterol entering the liver and so lowers 
the level of cholesterol in the blood. 
What Repatha is used for 
Repatha is used in addition to your cholesterol lowering diet if you are: 
• 
an adult with a high cholesterol level in your blood (primary hypercholesterolaemia 
[heterozygous familial and non-familial] or mixed dyslipidaemia). It is given: 
- 
together with a statin or other cholesterol lowering medication, if the maximum dose of a 
statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently. 
alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medications when statins do not work 
well or cannot be used. 
- 
• 
• 
a child aged 10 years and older with a high cholesterol level in your blood because of a 
condition that runs in your family (heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or HeFH). It is 
given alone or together with other cholesterol lowering treatments 
an adult or a child aged 10 years and older with a high cholesterol level in your blood because 
of a condition that runs in your family (homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or HoFH). 
It is given together with other cholesterol lowering treatments 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
an adult with a high cholesterol level in your blood and established atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (a history of heart attack, stroke or blood vessel problems). It is given: 
- 
together with a statin or other cholesterol lowering medication, if the maximum dose of a 
statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently. 
alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medications when statins do not work 
well or cannot be used. 
- 
Repatha is used in patients who cannot control their cholesterol levels with a cholesterol lowering diet 
alone. You should stay on your cholesterol lowering diet while taking this medicine. Repatha can help 
prevent heart attack, stroke, and certain heart procedures to restore blood flow to the heart due to a 
build-up of fatty deposits in your arteries (also known as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). 
2.  What you need to know before you use Repatha 
Do not use Repatha if you are allergic to evolocumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Repatha if you have liver disease. 
The needle cover of the glass pre-filled syringe is made from dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), 
which may cause severe allergic reactions. 
In order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the name 
and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also wish to make 
a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Repatha has been studied in children 10 years of age and older being treated for 
heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. 
The use of Repatha has not been studied in children under 10 years of age. 
Other medicines and Repatha 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Repatha has not been tested in pregnant women. It is not known if Repatha will harm your unborn 
baby. 
It is not known whether Repatha is found in breast milk. 
It is important to tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help 
you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Repatha, considering the benefit 
of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Repatha to the mother. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Repatha has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Repatha contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Repatha 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
The recommended dose depends on the underlying condition: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
for adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia the dose is either 
140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly. 
for children aged 10 years or older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia the dose is 
either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly. 
for adults or children aged 10 years or older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
the recommended starting dose is 420 mg once monthly. After 12 weeks your doctor may 
decide to increase the dose to 420 mg every two weeks. If you also receive apheresis, a 
procedure similar to dialysis where cholesterol and other fats are removed from the blood, your 
doctor may decide to start you on a dose of 420 mg every two weeks to coincide with your 
apheresis treatment. 
for adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (a history of heart attack, 
stroke or blood vessel problems) the dose is either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once 
monthly. 
Repatha is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). 
If your doctor prescribes a dose of 420 mg you must use three pre-filled syringes because each 
pre-filled syringe only contains 140 mg of medicine. After reaching room temperature, all injections 
should be given within a 30 minute period. 
If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver can give the injections of Repatha, you or your caregiver 
should receive training on how to prepare and inject Repatha correctly. Do not try to inject Repatha 
until you have been shown how to do it by your doctor or nurse. 
See the detailed “Instructions for Use” at the end of this leaflet for instructions about how to store, 
prepare, and give your Repatha injections at home. 
Before starting Repatha, you should be on a diet to lower your cholesterol. You should keep on this 
cholesterol lowering diet while taking Repatha. 
If your doctor has prescribed Repatha along with another cholesterol lowering medicine, follow your 
doctor’s instructions on how to take these medicines together. In this case, please read the dosage 
instructions in the package leaflet of that particular medicine as well. 
If you use more Repatha than you should 
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to take Repatha 
Take Repatha as soon as you can after the missed dose. Then, contact your doctor who will tell you 
when you should schedule your next dose, and follow the new schedule exactly as your doctor has told 
you.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Repatha is and what it is used for 
What Repatha is and how it works 
Repatha is a medicine that lowers levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol, a type of fat, in the blood. 
Repatha contains the active substance evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised 
protein designed to attach to a target substance in the body). Evolocumab is designed to attach to a 
substance called PCSK9 that affects the liver’s ability to take in cholesterol. By attaching to, and 
mopping up PCSK9, the medicine increases the amount of cholesterol entering the liver and so lowers 
the level of cholesterol in the blood. 
What Repatha is used for 
Repatha is used in addition to your cholesterol lowering diet if you are: 
• 
an adult with a high cholesterol level in your blood (primary hypercholesterolaemia 
[heterozygous familial and non-familial] or mixed dyslipidaemia). It is given: 
- 
together with a statin or other cholesterol lowering medication, if the maximum dose of a 
statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently. 
alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medications when statins do not work 
well or cannot be used. 
- 
• 
• 
a child aged 10 years and older with a high cholesterol level in your blood because of a 
condition that runs in your family (heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or HeFH). It is 
given alone or together with other cholesterol lowering treatments. 
an adult or a child aged 10 years and older with a high cholesterol level in your blood because 
of a condition that runs in your family (homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or HoFH). 
It is given together with other cholesterol lowering treatments. 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
an adult with a high cholesterol level in your blood and established atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (a history of heart attack, stroke or blood vessel problems). It is given: 
- 
together with a statin or other cholesterol lowering medication, if the maximum dose of a 
statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently. 
alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medications when statins do not work 
well or cannot be used. 
- 
Repatha is used in patients who cannot control their cholesterol levels with a cholesterol lowering diet 
alone. You should stay on your cholesterol lowering diet while taking this medicine. Repatha can help 
prevent heart attack, stroke, and certain heart procedures to restore blood flow to the heart due to a 
build-up of fatty deposits in your arteries (also known as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). 
2.  What you need to know before you use Repatha 
Do not use Repatha if you are allergic to evolocumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Repatha if you have liver disease. 
The needle cover of the glass pre-filled pen is made from dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), 
which may cause severe allergic reactions. 
In order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the name 
and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also wish to make 
a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Repatha has been studied in children 10 years of age and older being treated for 
heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. 
The use of Repatha has not been studied in children under 10 years of age. 
Other medicines and Repatha 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Repatha has not been tested in pregnant women. It is not known if Repatha will harm your unborn 
baby. 
It is not known whether Repatha is found in breast milk. 
It is important to tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help 
you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Repatha, considering the benefit 
of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Repatha to the mother. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Repatha has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Repatha contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to use Repatha 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
The recommended dose depends on the underlying condition: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
for adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia the dose is either 
140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly. 
for children aged 10 years or older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia the dose is 
either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly. 
for adults or children aged 10 years or older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
the recommended starting dose is 420 mg once monthly. After 12 weeks your doctor may 
decide to increase the dose to 420 mg every two weeks. If you also receive apheresis, a 
procedure similar to dialysis where cholesterol and other fats are removed from the blood, your 
doctor may decide to start you on a dose of 420 mg every two weeks to coincide with your 
apheresis treatment. 
for adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (a history of heart attack, 
stroke or blood vessel problems) the dose is either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once 
monthly. 
Repatha is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). 
If your doctor prescribes a dose of 420 mg you must use three pre-filled pens because each pre-filled 
pen only contains 140 mg of medicine. After reaching room temperature, all injections should be 
given within a 30 minute period. 
If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver can give the injections of Repatha, you or your caregiver 
should receive training on how to prepare and inject Repatha correctly. Do not try to inject Repatha 
until you have been shown how to do it by your doctor or nurse. 
See the detailed “Instructions for Use” at the end of this leaflet for instructions about how to store, 
prepare, and give your Repatha injections at home. If using the pre-filled pen, place the correct 
(yellow) end of the pen on the skin before injecting. 
Before starting Repatha, you should be on a diet to lower your cholesterol. You should keep on this 
cholesterol lowering diet while taking Repatha. 
If your doctor has prescribed Repatha along with another cholesterol lowering medicine, follow your 
doctor’s instructions on how to take these medicines together. In this case, please read the dosage 
instructions in the package leaflet of that particular medicine as well. 
If you use more Repatha than you should 
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to take Repatha 
Take Repatha as soon as you can after the missed dose. Then, contact your doctor who will tell you 
when you should schedule your next dose, and follow the new schedule exactly as your doctor has told 
you.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Repatha is and what it is used for 
What Repatha is and how it works 
Repatha is a medicine that lowers levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol, a type of fat, in the blood. 
Repatha contains the active substance evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody (a type of specialised 
protein designed to attach to a target substance in the body). Evolocumab is designed to attach to a 
substance called PCSK9 that affects the liver’s ability to take in cholesterol. By attaching to, and 
mopping up PCSK9, the medicine increases the amount of cholesterol entering the liver and so lowers 
the level of cholesterol in the blood. 
What Repatha is used for 
Repatha is used in addition to your cholesterol lowering diet if you are: 
• 
an adult with a high cholesterol level in your blood (primary hypercholesterolaemia 
[heterozygous familial and non-familial] or mixed dyslipidaemia). It is given: 
- 
together with a statin or other cholesterol lowering medication, if the maximum dose of a 
statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently. 
alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medications when statins do not work 
well or cannot be used. 
- 
• 
• 
a child aged 10 years and older with a high cholesterol level in your blood because of a 
condition that runs in your family (heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or HeFH). It is 
given alone or together with other cholesterol lowering treatments 
an adult or a child aged 10 years and older with a high cholesterol level in your blood because 
of a condition that runs in your family (homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or HoFH). 
It is given together with the other cholesterol lowering treatments. 
74 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
an adult with a high cholesterol level in your blood and established atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease (a history of heart attack, stroke or blood vessel problems). It is given: 
- 
together with a statin or other cholesterol lowering medication, if the maximum dose of a 
statin does not lower levels of cholesterol sufficiently. 
alone or together with other cholesterol lowering medications when statins do not work 
well or cannot be used. 
- 
Repatha is used in patients who cannot control their cholesterol levels with a cholesterol lowering diet 
alone. You should stay on your cholesterol lowering diet while taking this medicine. Repatha can help 
prevent heart attack, stroke, and certain heart procedures to restore blood flow to the heart due to a 
build-up of fatty deposits in your arteries (also known as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease). 
2.  What you need to know before you use Repatha 
Do not use Repatha if you are allergic to evolocumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Repatha if you have liver disease. 
In order to improve the traceability of this medicine, your doctor or pharmacist should record the name 
and the lot number of the product you have been given in your patient file. You may also wish to make 
a note of these details in case you are asked for this information in the future. 
Children and adolescents 
The use of Repatha has been studied in children 10 years of age and older being treated for 
heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. 
The use of Repatha has not been studied in children under 10 years of age. 
Other medicines and Repatha 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Repatha has not been tested in pregnant women. It is not known if Repatha will harm your unborn 
baby. 
It is not known whether Repatha is found in breast milk. 
It is important to tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or plan to do so. Your doctor will then help 
you decide whether to stop breast-feeding, or whether to stop taking Repatha, considering the benefit 
of breast-feeding to the baby and the benefit of Repatha to the mother. 
Driving and using machines 
Repatha has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

3. 
How to use Repatha 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure. 
The recommended dose depends on the underlying condition: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
for adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia the dose is either 
140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly. 
for children aged 10 years or older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia the dose is 
either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once monthly. 
for adults or children aged 10 years or older with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia 
the recommended starting dose is 420 mg once monthly. After 12 weeks your doctor may 
decide to increase the dose to 420 mg every two weeks. If you also receive apheresis, a 
procedure similar to dialysis where cholesterol and other fats are removed from the blood, your 
doctor may decide to start you on a dose of 420 mg every two weeks to coincide with your 
apheresis treatment. 
for adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (a history of heart attack, 
stroke or blood vessel problems) the dose is either 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg once 
monthly. 
Repatha is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous). 
If your doctor decides that you or a caregiver can give the injections of Repatha using the automated 
mini-doser, you or your caregiver should receive training on how to prepare and inject Repatha 
correctly. Do not try to use the automated mini-doser until you have been shown how to do it by your 
doctor or nurse. It is recommended that 10 to 13 years olds are supervised by an adult when they are 
using the automated mini-doser. 
See the detailed “Instructions for Use” at the end of this leaflet for instructions about how to store, 
prepare, and use your Repatha automated mini-doser at home. 
Before starting Repatha, you should be on a diet to lower your cholesterol. You should keep on this 
cholesterol lowering diet while taking Repatha. 
If your doctor has prescribed Repatha along with another cholesterol lowering medicine, follow your 
doctor’s instructions on how to take these medicines together. In this case, please read the dosage 
instructions in the package leaflet of that particular medicine as well. 
If you use more Repatha than you should 
Contact your doctor or pharmacist immediately. 
If you forget to take Repatha 
Take Repatha as soon as you can after the missed dose. Then, contact your doctor who will tell you 
when you should schedule your next dose, and follow the new schedule exactly as your doctor has told 
you.

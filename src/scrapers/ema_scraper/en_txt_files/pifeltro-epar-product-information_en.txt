4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
Pifeltro is indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of
adults, and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg infected with human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) without past or present evidence of resistance to the non-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) class (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.
Posology
The recommended dose is one 100 mg tablet taken orally once daily with or without food.
Dose adjustment
If Pifeltro is co-administered with rifabutin, one 100 mg tablet of Pifeltro should be taken twice daily
(approximately 12 hours apart) (see section 4.5).
Co-administration of doravirine with other moderate CYP3A inducers has not been evaluated, but
decreased doravirine concentrations are expected. If co-administration with other moderate CYP3A
inducers (e.g., dabrafenib, lesinurad, bosentan, thioridazine, nafcillin, modafinil, telotristat ethyl)
cannot be avoided, one 100 mg tablet of Pifeltro should be taken twice daily (approximately 12 hours
apart).
Missed dose
If the patient misses a dose of Pifeltro within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient should
take as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If a patient misses a dose by more
than 12 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take the next dose at the
regularly scheduled time. The patient should not take 2 doses at one time.
2
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment of doravirine is required in elderly patients (see section 5.2).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment of doravirine is required in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal
impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease and has not been
studied in dialysis patients (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of doravirine is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate
(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in patients with severe
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). It is not known whether the exposure to doravirine will
increase in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is advised when doravirine is
administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
Safety and efficacy of Pifeltro in children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg have not
been established. No data are available.
Method of administration
Pifeltro must be taken orally, once daily with or without food and swallowed whole (see section 5.2).
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin
Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong cytochrome P450 CYP3A enzyme inducers
is contraindicated as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations are expected to occur,
which may decrease the effectiveness of Pifeltro (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). These medicinal products
include, but are not limited, to the following:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
rifampicin, rifapentine
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)
mitotane
enzalutamide
lumacaftor
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
NNRTI substitutions and use of doravirine
Doravirine has not been evaluated in patients with previous virologic failure to any other antiretroviral
therapy. NNRTI-associated mutations detected at screening were part of exclusion criteria in the Phase
2b/3-studies. A breakpoint for a reduction in susceptibility, yielded by various NNRTI substitutions,
that is associated with a reduction in clinical efficacy has not been established (see section 5.1). There
is not sufficient clinical evidence to support the use of doravirine in patients infected with HIV-1 with
evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class.
Use with CYP3A inducers
Caution should be given to prescribing doravirine with medicinal products that may reduce the
exposure of doravirine (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Immune reactivation syndrome
3
Immune reactivation syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral
therapy. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune
system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic
infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, autoimmune hepatitis, polymyositis, and Guillain-
Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the
time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
Lactose
The tablets contain lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal
product.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Effects of other medicinal products on doravirine
Doravirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, and medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A
are expected to affect the clearance of doravirine (see section 5.2). Doravirine should not be co-
administered with medicinal products that are strong CYP3A enzyme inducers as significant decreases
in doravirine plasma concentrations are expected to occur, which may decrease the effectiveness of
doravirine (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).
Co-administration with the moderate CYP3A inducer rifabutin decreased doravirine concentrations
(see Table 1). When doravirine is co-administered with rifabutin, the doravirine dose should be
increased to 100 mg twice daily (the doses should be taken approximately 12 hours apart) (see
section 4.2).
Co-administration of doravirine with other moderate CYP3A inducers has not been evaluated, but
decreased doravirine concentrations are expected. If co-administration with other moderate CYP3A
inducers (e.g., dabrafenib, lesinurad, bosentan, thioridazine, nafcillin, modafinil, telotristat ethyl)
cannot be avoided, the doravirine dose should be increased to 100 mg twice daily (the doses should be
taken approximately 12 hours apart) (see section 4.2).
Co-administration of doravirine and medicinal products that are inhibitors of CYP3A may result in
increased plasma concentrations of doravirine. However, no dose adjustment is needed when
doravirine is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors.
Effects of doravirine on other medicinal products
Doravirine at a dose of 100 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the
plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are dependent on transport proteins for absorption
and/or elimination or that are metabolised by CYP enzymes.
However, co-administration of doravirine and the sensitive CYP3A substrate midazolam resulted in a
18 % decrease in midazolam exposure, suggesting that doravirine may be a weak CYP3A inducer.
Therefore caution should be used when co-administering doravirine with medicinal products that are
sensitive CYP3A substrates that also have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., tacrolimus and
sirolimus).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of doravirine in pregnant women.
Antiretroviral pregnancy registry
To monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients exposed to antiretroviral medicinal products while
pregnant, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to
register patients in this registry.
Animal studies with doravirine do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of doravirine during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether doravirine is excreted in human milk. Available
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of doravirine in milk (see
section 5.3).
It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid
transmission of HIV.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of doravirine on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate
harmful effects of doravirine on fertility at exposure levels higher than the exposure in humans at the
recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3).
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Pifeltro has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed
that fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence have been reported during treatment with doravirine (see
section 4.8). This should be considered when assessing a patient's ability to drive or operate
machinery.
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In phase 3 clinical trials with doravirine plus 2 NRTIs, the most frequently reported adverse reactions
were nausea (4 %) and headache (3 %).
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions with doravirine plus 2 NRTIs from Phase 3 clinical trials (DRIVE FORWARD,
DRIVE SHIFT and DRIVE AHEAD) are listed below by body system organ class and frequency.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.
Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1 000
to < 1/100) or rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000).

Immune reactivation syndrome
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Paediatric population
The safety of doravirine as a component of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil was evaluated
in 45 HIV-1 infected virologically suppressed or treatment-naïve paediatric patients 12 to less than
18 years of age through Week 48 in an open-label trial (IMPAACT 2014 (Protocol 027)). The safety
profile in paediatric subjects was similar to that in adults.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
There is no information on potential acute symptoms and signs of overdose with doravirine.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, ATC code: J05AG06
Mechanism of action
Doravirine is a pyridinone non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1 and inhibits HIV-1
replication by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Doravirine does not
inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases α, ß, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.
Antiviral activity in cell culture
15
Doravirine exhibited an EC50 value of 12.0±4.4 nM against wild-type laboratory strains of HIV-1
when tested in the presence of 100 % normal human serum using MT4-GFP reporter cells. Doravirine
demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of primary HIV-1 isolates (A, A1, AE, AG, B,
BF, C, D, G, H) with EC50 values ranging from 1.2 nM to 10.0 nM.
Antiviral activity in combination with other HIV antiviral medicinal products
The antiviral activity of doravirine was not antagonistic when combined with the NNRTIs delavirdine,
efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine, or rilpivirine; the NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine,
lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir disoproxil, or zidovudine; the PIs darunavir or indinavir; the fusion
inhibitor enfuvirtide; the CCR5 co-receptor antagonist maraviroc; or the integrase strand transfer
inhibitor raltegravir.
Resistance
In cell culture
Doravirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different
origins and subtypes, as well as NNRTI-resistant HIV-1. Observed emergent amino acid substitutions
in RT included: V106A, V106M, V106I, V108I, F227L, F227C, F227I, F227V, H221Y, M230I,
L234I, P236L, and Y318F. The V106A, V106M, V108I, H221Y, F227C, M230I, P236L, and Y318F
substitutions conferred 3.4-fold to 70-fold reductions in susceptibility to doravirine. Y318F in
combination with V106A, V106M, V108I, and F227C conferred greater decreases in susceptibility to
doravirine than Y318F alone, which conferred a 10-fold reduction in susceptibility to doravirine.
Common NNRTI-resistant mutations (K103N, Y181C) were not selected in the in vitro study. V106A
(yielding a fold change of around 19) appeared as an initial substitution in subtype B virus, and
V106A or M in subtype A and C virus. Subsequently F227(L/C/V) or L234I emerged in addition to
V106 substitution (double mutants yielding a fold change of > 100).
In clinical trials
Treatment-naïve adult subjects
The Phase 3 studies, DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD, included previously untreated
patients (n = 747) where the following NNRTI substitutions were part of exclusion criteria: L100I,
K101E, K101P, K103N, K103S, V106A, V106I, V106M, V108I, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q,
E138R, V179L, Y181C, Y181I, Y181V, Y188C, Y188H, Y188L, G190A, G190S, H221Y, L234I,
M230I, M230L, P225H, F227C, F227L, F227V.
The following de novo resistance was seen in the resistance analysis subset (subjects with HIV-1 RNA
greater than 400 copies per mL at virologic failure or early study discontinuation and having resistance
data).

Emergent doravirine associated resistance substitutions in RT included one or more of the following:
A98G, V106I, V106A, V106M/T, Y188L, H221Y, P225H, F227C, F227C/R, and Y318Y/F.
Virologically suppressed adult subjects
The DRIVE-SHIFT study included virologically suppressed patients (N=670) with no history of
treatment failure (see section, Clinical experience). A documented absence of genotypic resistance
(prior to starting first therapy) to doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir was part of the inclusion
criteria for patients who switched from a PI- or INI-based regimen.  Exclusionary NNRTI
substitutions were those listed above (DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD), with the exception
of substitutions RT K103N, G190A and Y181C (accepted in DRIVE-SHIFT).  Documentation of pre-
treatment resistance genotyping was not required for patients who switched from a NNRTI-based
regimen.
In the DRIVE-SHIFT clinical trial, no subjects developed genotypic or phenotypic resistance to DOR,
3TC, or TDF during the initial 48 weeks (immediate switch, N=447) or 24 weeks (delayed switch,
N=209) of treatment with DOR/3TC/TDF.  One subject developed RT M184M/I mutation and
phenotypic resistance to 3TC and FTC during treatment with their baseline regimen.  None of the
24 subjects (11 in the immediate switch group, 13 in the delayed switch group) with baseline NNRTI
mutations (RT K103N, G190A, or Y181C) experienced virologic failure through Week 48, or at time
of discontinuation.
Paediatric subjects
In the IMPAACT 2014 (Protocol 027) clinical trial, no subject who was virologically suppressed at
baseline met the criteria for resistance analysis. One treatment-naïve subject who met the
protocol-defined virologic failure criteria (defined as 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA test results
≥200 copies/mL) at or after Week 24 was evaluated for the development of resistance; no emergence
of genotypic or phenotypic resistance to doravirine was detected.
Cross-resistance
Doravirine has been evaluated in a limited number of patients with NNRTI resistance (K103N n=7,
G190A n=1); all patients were suppressed to < 40 copies/mL at week 48. A breakpoint for a reduction
in susceptibility, yielded by various NNRTI substitutions, that is associated with a reduction in clinical
efficacy has not been established.
17
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Laboratory strains of HIV-1 harbouring the common NNRTI-associated mutations K103N, Y181C, or
K103N/Y181C substitutions in RT exhibit less than a 3-fold decrease in susceptibility to doravirine
compared to wild-type virus when evaluated in the presence of 100 % normal human serum. In in vitro
studies, doravirine was able to suppress the following NNRTI-associated substitutions; K103N,
Y181C, and G190A under clinically relevant concentrations.
A panel of 96 diverse clinical isolates containing NNRTI-associated mutations was evaluated for
susceptibility to doravirine in the presence of 10 % foetal bovine serum. Clinical isolates containing
the Y188L substitution or V106 substitutions in combination with A98G, H221Y, P225H, F227C or
Y318F showed a greater than 100-fold reduced susceptibility to doravirine. Other established NNRTI
substitutions yielded a fold change of 5-10 (G190S (5.7), K103N/P225H (7.9), V108I/Y181C (6.9),
Y181V (5.1)). The clinical relevance of a 5-10 fold reduction in susceptibility is unknown.
Treatment emergent doravirine resistance associated substitutions may confer cross-resistance to
efavirenz, rilpivirine, nevirapine, and etravirine. Of the 8 subjects who developed high level doravirine
resistance in the pivotal studies, 6 had phenotypic resistance to EFV and nevirapine, 3 to rilpivirine,
and 3 had partial resistance to etravirine based on the Monogram Phenosense assay.
Clinical experience
Treatment-naïve adult subjects
The efficacy of doravirine is based on the analyses of 96-week data from two randomised, multicentre,
double-blind, active controlled Phase 3 trials, (DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD) in
antiretroviral treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected subjects (n = 1494). Refer to Resistance section for
NNRTI substitutions that were part of exclusion criteria.
In DRIVE-FORWARD, 766 subjects were randomised and received at least 1 dose of either
doravirine 100 mg or darunavir + ritonavir 800+100 mg once daily, each in combination with
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) selected by the
investigator. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 33 years (range 18 to 69 years), 86 % had
CD4+ T cell count greater than 200 cells per mm3, 84 % were male, 27 % were non-white, 4 % had
hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 10 % had a history of AIDS, 20 % had HIV-1 RNA greater
than 100 000 copies per mL, 13 % received ABC/3TC and 87 % received FTC/TDF; these
characteristics were similar between treatment groups.
In DRIVE-AHEAD, 728 subjects were randomised and received at least 1 dose of either
doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil 100/300/245 mg (DOR/3TC/TDF) or
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (EFV/FTC/TDF) once daily. At baseline, the median age
of subjects was 31 years (range 18-70 years), 85 % were male, 52 % were non-white, 3% had hepatitis
B or C co-infection, 14 % had a history of AIDS, 21 % had HIV-1 RNA > 100 000 copies per mL, and
12 % had CD4+ T cell count < 200 cells per mm3; these characteristics were similar between treatment
groups.
Week 48 and 96 outcomes for DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD are provided in Table 4. The
doravirine-based regimens demonstrated consistent efficacy across demographic and baseline
prognostic factors.

*For Week 96, certain subjects with missing HIV-1 RNA were excluded from the analysis.
P007 was a Phase 2b trial in antiretroviral treatment-naïve HIV-1 infected adult subjects (n = 340). In
Part I, subjects were randomised to receive one of 4 doses of doravirine or EFV, each in combination
with FTC/TDF. After week 24, all subjects randomised to receive doravirine were switched to (or
maintained on) doravirine 100 mg. Additional subjects were randomised in Part II to receive either
doravirine 100 mg or EFV, each in combination with FTC/TDF. In both parts of the trial, doravirine
and EFV were administered as blinded-therapy and FTC/TDF was administered open-label.

Virologically suppressed adult subjects
The efficacy of switching from a baseline regimen consisting of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors in combination with a ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted PI, or cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir,
or an NNRTI to DOR/3TC/TDF was evaluated in a randomised, open-label trial (DRIVE-SHIFT), in
virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adults.  Subjects must have been virologically suppressed
(HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies/mL) on their baseline regimen for at least 6 months prior to trial entry, with
no history of virologic failure, and a documented absence of RT substitutions conferring resistance to
doravirine, lamivudine and tenofovir (see section, Resistance).  Subjects were randomised to either
switch to DOR/3TC/TDF at baseline [N = 447, Immediate Switch Group (ISG)], or stay on their
baseline regimen until Week 24, at which point they switched to DOR/3TC/TDF [N = 223, Delayed
Switch Group (DSG)].  At baseline, the median age of subjects was 43 years, 16 % were female,
and 24 % were non-white.
In the DRIVE-SHIFT trial, an immediate switch to DOR/3TC/TDF was demonstrated to be non-
inferior at Week 48 compared to continuation of the baseline regimen at Week 24 as assessed by the
proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies/mL. Treatment results are shown in Table 6.
Consistent results were seen for the comparison at study Week 24 in each treatment group.

administered with two NRTIs.
Discontinuation due to adverse events
In a pooled analysis combining data from two treatment-naïve trials (P007 and DRIVE-AHEAD), a
lower proportion of subjects who discontinued due to an adverse event by week 48 was seen for the
combined doravirine (100 mg) treatment groups (2.8 %) compared with the combined EFV treatment
group (6.1 %) (treatment difference -3.4 %, p-value 0.012).
21
 
Paediatric population
The efficacy of doravirine was evaluated in combination with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil
(DOR/3TC/TDF) in an open-label, single-arm trial in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients 12 to less
than 18 years of age (IMPAACT 2014 (Protocol 027)).
At baseline, the median age of subjects was 15 years (range: 12 to 17), 58% were female, 78% were
Asian and 22% were Black, and the median CD4+ T-cell count was 713 cells per mm3 (range: 84 to
1,397). After switching to DOR/3TC/TDF, 95% (41/43) of virologically suppressed subjects remained
suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) at Week 24 and 93% (40/43) remained suppressed (HIV-1
RNA < 50 copies/mL) at Week 48. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with
doravirine in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of human
immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
The pharmacokinetics of doravirine were studied in healthy subjects and HIV-1 infected subjects.
Doravirine pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy subjects and HIV-1-infected subjects. Steady state
was generally achieved by Day 2 of once daily dosing, with accumulation ratios of 1.2 to 1.4 for
AUC0-24, Cmax, and C24. Doravirine steady state pharmacokinetics following administration of 100 mg
once daily to HIV-1 infected subjects, based on a population pharmacokinetics analysis, are provided
below.

GM: Geometric mean, % CV: Geometric coefficient of variation
16.1 (29)
0.962 (19)
0.396 (63)
Following oral dosing, peak plasma concentrations are achieved 2 hours after dosing. Doravirine has
an estimated absolute bioavailability of approximately 64 % for the 100 mg tablet.
Effect of food on oral absorption
The administration of a single doravirine tablet with a high-fat meal to healthy subjects resulted in a
16 % and 36 % increase in doravirine AUC and C24, respectively, while Cmax was not significantly
affected.
Distribution
Based on administration of an intravenous microdose, the volume of distribution of doravirine is
60.5 L. Doravirine is approximately 76 % bound to plasma proteins.
Biotransformation
Based on in vitro data, doravirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A.
Elimination
Doravirine has a terminal half-life (t1/2) of approximately 15 hours. Doravirine is primarily eliminated
via oxidative metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. Biliary excretion of unchanged medicinal product
22
may contribute to the elimination of doravirine, but this elimination route is not expected to be
significant. Excretion of unchanged medicinal product via urinary excretion is minor.
Renal impairment
Renal excretion of doravirine is minor. In a study comparing 8 subjects with severe renal impairment
to 8 subjects without renal impairment, the single dose exposure of doravirine was 31 % higher in
subjects with severe renal impairment. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, which included
subjects with CrCl between 17 and 317 mL/min, renal function did not have a clinically relevant effect
on doravirine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or
severe renal impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease or in
patients undergoing dialysis (see section 4.2).
Hepatic impairment
Doravirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. There was no clinically relevant
difference in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine in a study comparing 8 subjects with moderate
hepatic impairment (classified as Child-Pugh score B primarily due to increased encephalopathy and
ascites scores) to 8 subjects without hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required in patients
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in subjects with severe
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C) (see section 4.2).
Paediatric population  
Mean doravirine exposures were similar in 54 paediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years and
weighing at least 35 kg who received doravirine or doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil in
IMPAACT 2014 (Protocol 027) relative to adults following administration of doravirine or
doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil (Table 7).

Elderly
Although a limited number of subjects aged 65 years and over has been included (n=36), no clinically
relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine have been identified in subjects at least
65 years of age compared to subjects less than 65 years of age in a Phase 1 trial or in a population
pharmacokinetic analysis. No dose adjustment is required.
Gender
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between men and women for
doravirine.

Race
No clinically relevant racial differences in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine have been identified
based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of doravirine in healthy and HIV-1 infected subjects.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Reproductive toxicity
Reproduction studies with orally administered doravirine have been performed in rats and rabbits at
exposures approximately 9 times (rats) and 8 times (rabbits) the exposure in humans at the
recommended human dose (RHD) with no effects on embryo-foetal (rats and rabbits) or pre/postnatal
(rats) development. Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits showed that doravirine is transferred to the
foetus through the placenta, with foetal plasma concentrations of up to 40 % (rabbits) and 52 % (rats)
that of maternal concentrations observed on gestation Day 20.
Doravirine was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration, with milk
concentrations approximately 1.5 times that of maternal plasma concentrations.
Carcinogenesis
Long-term oral carcinogenicity studies of doravirine in mice and rats showed no evidence of
carcinogenic potential at estimated exposures up to 6 times (mice) and 7 times (rats) the human
exposures at the RHD.
Mutagenesis
Doravirine was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays.
Impairment of fertility
There were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development when
doravirine was administered to rats up to 7 times the exposure in humans at the RHD.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What Pifeltro is and what it is used for
What Pifeltro is
Pifeltro is used to treat HIV (‘human immunodeficiency virus’) infection. It belongs to a group of
medicines called ‘antiretroviral medicines’.
Pifeltro contains the active substance doravirine - a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
(NNRTI).
What Pifeltro is used for
Pifeltro is used to treat HIV infection in adults, and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at
least 35 kg. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (‘acquired immune deficiency syndrome’). You should
not take Pifeltro if your doctor has told you that the virus causing your infection is resistant to
doravirine.
Pifeltro must be used in combination with other medicines for HIV.
How Pifeltro works
When used with other medicines, Pifeltro works by preventing HIV from making more viruses in your
body. This will help by:
• 
• 
reducing the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your ‘viral load’)
increasing the number of white blood cells called ‘CD4+ T’. This can make your immune
system stronger. This may reduce your risk of early death or catching infections because your
immune system is weak.
35
2. 
What you need to know before you take Pifeltro
Do not take Pifeltro
• 
if you are allergic to doravirine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in
section 6.
• 
if you are taking the following medicines:
− carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines for seizures)
− rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines for tuberculosis)
− St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety) or
products that contain it
− mitotane (a medicine to treat cancer)
− enzalutamide (a medicine to treat prostate cancer)
− lumacaftor (a medicine to treat cystic fibrosis)
Do not take Pifeltro if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or
nurse before taking Pifeltro. See also “Other Medicines and Pifeltro” section.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Pifeltro.
Immune reactivation syndrome
This can happen when you start taking any HIV medicine, including this medicine. Your immune
system may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long
time. Tell your doctor right away if you start having any new symptoms after starting your HIV
medicine.
Autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue)
may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune
disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection
or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up
towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor
immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg. The use
of Pifeltro in children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg has not yet been studied.
Other medicines and Pifeltro
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other
medicines. This is because other medicines may affect how Pifeltro works, and Pifeltro might affect
the way some other medicines work.
There are some medicines you must not take with Pifeltro. See list under “Do not take Pifeltro”
section.
lesinurad (a medicine to treat gout)
bosentan (a medicine to treat lung disease)
dabrafenib (a medicine to treat skin cancer)
Talk to your doctor before taking the following medicines with Pifeltro, as your doctor may need to
change the dose of your medicines:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
telotristat ethyl (a medicine to treat diarrhoea in people with carcinoid syndrome)
rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis)
thioridazine (a medicine to treat psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia)
nafcillin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections)
modafinil (a medicine to treat excessive sleepiness)
36
If your doctor decides you should take these medicines with Pifeltro, one tablet of doravirine should be
taken twice daily (approximately 12 hours apart).
Your doctor may check your blood levels or monitor for side effects if you take the following
medicines with Pifeltro:
• 
• 
sirolimus (a medicine used to control your body’s immune response after a transplant)
tacrolimus (a medicine used to control your body’s immune response after a transplant)
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, talk
to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Pifeltro. It is preferable to avoid the use of this
medicine during pregnancy. This is because it has not been studied in pregnancy and it is not known if
it will harm your baby while you are pregnant.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Use caution when driving or riding a bicycle, or operating machines if you feel dizzy, tired, or sleepy
after taking this medicine.
Pifeltro tablets contain lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to lactose, talk to your doctor before
taking this medicine.
3. 
How to take Pifeltro
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse has told you. Check with your
doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are not sure. This medicine must be used in combination with other
medicines for HIV.
How much to take
The recommended dose is 1 tablet once a day. If you take certain medicines, your doctor may need to
change the amount of doravirine you take. See “Other medicines and Pifeltro” section for a list of
medicines.
Taking this medicine
• 
• 
Swallow the tablet whole (do not crush or chew).
This medicine can be taken with food or between meals.
If you take more Pifeltro than you should
Do not take more than the recommended dose. If you accidentally take more, contact your doctor.
If you forget to take Pifeltro
• 
• 
It is important that you do not miss or skip doses of this medicine.
If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember. But if your next dose is due within
12 hours, skip the dose you missed and take the next one at the usual time. Then continue your
treatment as before.
• 
• 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose.
If you are not sure what to do, call your doctor or pharmacist.
37
If you stop taking Pifeltro

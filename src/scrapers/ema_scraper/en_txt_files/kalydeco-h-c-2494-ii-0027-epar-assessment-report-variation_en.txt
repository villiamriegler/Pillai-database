2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This assessment report concerns the requested extension of indication for Kalydeco (ivacaftor) to include 
cystic fibrosis (CF) patients aged 18 years and older who have an R117H mutation in the CF 
Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. CF is an autosomal recessive genetic condition with 
an incidence of approximately 1:3500 in most European and North American countries and 1:5000 to 
1:20,000 in Latin America, the Middle East, and South Africa. Progressive obstructive lung disease causes 
over 90% of deaths in patients with CF. Mutations in the gene coding for the CFTR result in an absent or 
dysfunctional protein at the surface of certain epithelia. Although CF affects multiple organs, the leading 
cause of mortality is the progressive loss of lung function. CFTR normally transports chloride to regulate 
salt, fluid, and pH balance in multiple organs. In people with CF, the loss of chloride transport due to 
defects in the CFTR protein results in the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, 
loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction and elevated 
sweat chloride concentration (Van Goor et al, 2014).  
More than 1500 CFTR mutations have been identified, but only the functional importance of a small 
number is known. Evaluation of the molecular defect in the CFTR protein caused by CFTR mutations has 
shown that the loss of chloride transport can be due to a reduction in the quantity and/or function of 
CFTR channels at the cell surface. As for other ion channels, gating of the CFTR channel is measured by 
open probability, and conductance of the CFTR channel is measured by current amplitude. The CFTR form 
that has lower open probability than normal CFTR has a gating defect, and the CFTR form that has lower 
current amplitude than normal CFTR has a conductance defect.  
Some CFTR mutations cause more than 1 type of functional defect or reduce both the quantity and 
function of CFTR. Regardless of the type of defect caused by the CFTR mutation, CF disease severity 
generally correlates with the severity of the loss of chloride transport. A complete or near complete loss 
of CFTR-mediated chloride transport – referred to as “minimal function” of CFTR– results in severe CF. A 
more moderate loss of CFTR-mediated chloride transport – referred to as “residual chloride transport” or 
“residual function” – results in less severe CF.  
The R117H-CFTR mutation is a missense mutation that results in the replacement of an arginine residue 
at position 117 of CFTR with a histidine residue. It is associated with residual chloride transport and a CF 
phenotype characterized by exocrine pancreatic sufficiency. Although generally characterized as a Class 
IV conductance mutation, R117H-CFTR is known to exhibit a defect in channel gating which has been 
documented in published studies (Sheppard et al., 1993) and in studies conducted by the MAH.  This 
finding supports, from a pharmacodynamic point of view, the use of ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that 
increases channel gating and, consequently, improves chloride transport, for the treatment of patients 
with cystic fibrosis and the R117H mutation in an allele of the CFTR. The clinical and functional analysis of 
the R117H mutation shows that it has variable expression or penetrance, i.e., it may result in a variable 
phenotype ranging from normal to cystic fibrosis.  This phenotypic variability has been mainly attributed 
to the presence of a polypyrimidine (poly-T tract) variant located in another region of the CFTR gene in 
cis with R117H (Thauvin-Robinet C. et al, 2009).   
The R117H-CFTR mutation is present in approximately 2 to 3% of patients with CF. In Europe, North 
America, and Australia, approximately 1,600 people with CF aged 6 years and older have at least 1 copy 
of an R117H-CFTR mutation. In the EU, approximately 744 people have the R117H-CFTR mutation, of 
whom approximately 360 people have the R117H-CFTR mutation and are 18 years of age or older.

EMA/670896/2020 
Page 8/57 
 
  
  
Although the disease expression is relatively heterogeneous, the R117H-CFTR mutation may be 
associated with reduced lung function, gradually progressive obstructive lung disease, recurrent sinusitis 
and bronchitis, and increasing frequency of hospitalizations over the course of the lifespan due to 
pulmonary disease. As illustrated in figure below, which plots the distributions of percent predicted FEV1 
in individuals with an R117H-CFTR mutation by age cohorts in the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) 
Registry, there is an evident progression in lung function decline with age. Among CF patients with an 
R117H-CFTR mutation who are 19 to 30 years of age, 34% of patients have a percent predicted FEV1 
<80%, and that number increases to 55% for patients aged more than 30 years. 
Although the R117H-CFTR mutation may result in CF disease, the severity of CF per age group is 
generally less than that caused by the G551D-CFTR mutation or other CFTR mutations associated with a 
severe phenotype. Historically, due to the milder presentation of disease, many individuals with an 
R117H-CFTR mutation were not diagnosed with CF until the late childhood or adult years, when the 
disease had progressed and symptoms became much more evident. This has recently changed because of 
advances in newborn screening for CFTR mutations. More individuals with an R117H-CFTR mutation are 
now identified earlier in life, often without advanced pulmonary or gastrointestinal manifestations, since 
the symptoms of CF progress with patient’s age. Available data about life expectancy in CF patients with 
a less severe CF phenotype, such as those with the R117H-CFTR, also have a markedly reduced median 
life expectancy of just 50 years with the median age of death being 38 years in the US and 32 years in 
the UK. In contrast, the life expectancy for non-Hispanic white males in the US is 76 years, and for males 
in Europe is 72 years. Due to the small number of CF patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation who have 
contributed data to searchable registries and the likelihood that many subjects with mild CF are not 
genotyped at their time of death it is difficult to estimate the impact of the R117H-CFTR mutation on life 
expectancy. Based on a simple numerical comparison, CFTR mutations associated with a less severe 
phenotype appear to result in a disease process that is approximately 10 years slower than for CF

patients who have mutations associated with severe disease (approximate median age of death of 26 
years for severe CF and 38 years for less severe CF). Thus, while the R117H mutation is in the less 
severe spectrum of CF, it is associated with severe disease when compared to a normal population. The 
MAH conclude that there is therefore a clear and substantial unmet need in this population. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The main study in support of this application was:  
Study VX11-770-110: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Who Have the R117H-CFTR 
Mutation 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No major new pharmacokinetic data is discussed in the documentation provided in support of this 
extension of the indication with the exception of a Population pharmacokinetic (PK) study (Report J178) 
and exploratory PK/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses for study 110. In addition, analytical methods for 
the determination of ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor in human plasma are also provided.  
A method for the determination of ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor in human plasma containing 
K2EDTA by HPLC-MS/MS over the calibration range of 2.00 to 2000 ng/mL for ivacaftor and M1-ivacaftor 
and range of 10.0 to 10000 ng/mL for M6-ivacaftor was developed and validated at Covance. The pre-
study validations of the analytical methods are satisfactory. The method demonstrated acceptable 
selectivity and the presence of haemolysed red blood cells and natural high lipid content in human plasma 
did not affect the quantitation of ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor in this method. All calibration 
standards utilized within the regression had back-calculated values that were within the acceptance 
criteria. For QCs, all intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy values were within the acceptance 
criteria. The data confirm that the presence of the co-administered drugs and selected concomitant 
medications (loratadine, triamcinolone, cetirizine dihydrochloride, DL-alpha tocopherol- vitamin E, 
ergocalciferol- vitamin D2, and ipratropium bromide monohydrate) does not affect the quantification of 
ivacaftor, M1-ivacaftor, and M6-ivacaftor. There was no evidence of carryover and the matrix factor was 
not considered to impact assay performance in either plasma or CF plasma.  
In general, the in-study validation shows acceptable calibration standards and QCs as the precision and 
accuracy for all the three analytes met the acceptance criteria for all analytical runs. A total of 359 study 
samples were analysed in a total of nine analytical runs (no analytical runs failed) between November 
20th, 2013 and November 25th, 2013 at Covance Laboratories Inc. (Covance) 3301 Kinsman Boulevard 
Madison, Wisconsin 53704 USA. A total of five study samples were re-assayed for ivacaftor with 
acceptable results (~1% of total number of samples analysed), 27 study samples were re-assayed for 
M1-ivacaftor with acceptable results (~8% of total number of samples analysed) and of six study samples 
were re-assayed for M6-ivacaftor with acceptable results (~2% of total number of samples analyzed).

The reasons for re-assay and the reported results were submitted and were considered acceptable. 
Incurred Sample Reproducibility was acceptable for all three analytes. For all analytes, the maximum 
storage period between collection and analysis was no longer that the current validated storage period at 
-60 ºC to – 80 ºC. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The R117H mutation is a missense mutation that results in the replacement of an arginine residue at 
position 117 of CFTR with a histidine residue. It affects the extracellular loop of the first of two membrane 
spanning domains that form the pore of the CFTR chloride ion channel. The R117H mutation is associated 
with residual chloride transport and a CF phenotype characterised by exocrine pancreatic sufficiency. 
Updated information on the mechanism of action of ivacaftor based on two recently published papers (Jih, 
K-Y, Hwang, T-C., 2013; Eckford, P.D.W, Li, C., Ramjeesingh, M., Bear, C.E., 2012) has been provided 
showing that ivacaftor increases the frequency of the ATP-independent channel gating mode, but the 
mechanism has not been completely elucidated. 
Although R117H is usually considered as a class IV conductance mutation, the in vitro experiments 
performed in Fisher Rat Thyroid (FRT) cells expressing the aberrant R117H-CFTR protein show that the 
main molecular defect is a decrease in channel gating with a minor decrease in channel conductance 
compared to normal CFTR channels. This finding supports, from a pharmacodynamic point of view, the 
use of ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that increases channel gating and, consequently, improves chloride 
transport for the treatment of patients with CF and the R117H mutation in an allele of the CFTR.  It 
should be noticed, however, that the in vitro responses seen in these experiments do not necessarily 
correspond to in vivo pharmacodynamic response (e.g. sweat chloride) or clinical benefit. 
The clinical and functional analysis of the R117H mutation shows that it has variable expression or 
penetrance, i.e. it may result in a variable phenotype ranging from normal to cystic fibrosis. This 
phenotypic variability has been partially attributed to the presence of a polypyrimidine (poly-T tract) 
variant located in another region of the CFTR gene in cis with R117H.  The poly-T tract is present in every 
copy of the CFTR gene and occurs in one of three forms: 5T, 7T, or 9T. Depending on which poly-T form 
is present in the same copy of the CFTR gene with R117H (i.e. in cis) differing outcomes may occur. The 
R117H mutation in cis with the 5T variant typically results in more severe CF than the R117H mutation in 
cis with the 7T variant. Although many individuals with the R117H mutation associated to the poly-T 
variant 7T will not have cystic fibrosis lung disease some cases of severe disease have been reported in 
patients carrying a severe CF mutation (Thauvin-Robinet, C. et al, 2009). The 9T variant is highly unlikely 
to cause disease. The difference in clinical consequence is likely due to the lower amount of CFTR protein 
synthesized in people with the 5T variant compared to those with the 7T variant, as well as other factors 
such as modifier genes, environmental factors, and other complex CFTR alleles. Examples of complex 
CFTR alleles in addition to 5T and 7T include the number of TG repeats in intron 8 along with the 5T 
mutation (e.g., TG11-5T, TG12-5T, TG13-5T) as well as missense mutations, such as M470V, R668C, 
G576A, D443Y, R74W, and D1270N. In conclusion, R117H by itself does not act as a CF-causing 
mutation. However, under certain circumstances, and, as always, when another CF-causing mutation is 
present, R117H can cause disease.  In order to correctly interpret data from the R117H mutation in trans 
with an additional CFTR mutation it is necessary to know the phase of the mutations. The phase refers to 
the specific combination of mutations that are present together in the same copy of the CFTR gene. For 
instance, a patient may have the following mutations: R117H/G551D and 5T/7T. Determining the phase 
means determining which poly-T variant (5T, 7T, 9T) is in the same copy of the CFTR gene as R117H and 
which is in the same copy as G551D. For some patients, testing of their parents is necessary to determine 
the phase of the mutations. This information is relevant for the subgroup analysis by poly-T variant that 
was performed in study 110.  The results of study 110 were analysed by the presence of the poly-T 
variant (5T or 7T) in cis with the R117H mutation. However, this information was not available for all 
patients enrolled in the study for various reasons. As a consequence, some assumptions were made for

patients with the following genotypes: R117H/F508del and R117H/R117H. What is lacking is the complete 
genotype of all patients, i.e. including not only the mutations of the CFTR in trans but also the poly-T 
variants in cis for both alleles, i.e. the phase of the mutations. This is addressed in the section on clinical 
efficacy. Because of the phenotypic variability of the R117H-CFTR mutation, diagnosis of CF should be 
mainly based on clinical criteria alone. Patients with this mutation and a mutation that is known to cause 
CF should undergo periodic assessment as the clinical manifestations of the disease may appear later in 
life. Regarding the CFTR mutation in the second allele, the majority of patients (76.8%) enrolled in study 
110 had the F508del mutation on the second allele, a processing mutation that results in minimal 
amounts of CFTR reaching the surface. Ivacaftor treatment did not result in clinical benefit in subjects 
homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation although limited in vitro response in chloride transport was 
seen, showing that this mutation has some defective channel gating. Each of the other second alleles was 
present in no more than 2 subjects.  
Of the 793 patients with cystic fibrosis carrying a R117H mutation in CFTR2, 590 had F508del in the 
second allele. Their average sweat chloride is 60 mEq/L, their percent predicted FEV1 is in the range of 
72-113% in patients below 10 years old (n=36); for those between 10-20 years old (n=75) their percent 
predicted FEV1 ranges between 67-121% and between 29-113% for patients above 20 years of age (n= 
213). Twenty-four percent are pancreatic-insufficient and 25% are infected by P aeruginosa. Regarding 
other CFTR mutations in the second allele of patients enrolled in study 110, stop codon (nonsense) 
mutations such as E60X, G103X, G542X, R553X, S489X, and W1282X are expected to significantly 
disrupt CFTR protein production and result in little or no functional CFTR protein in the cell. As a 
consequence, it was expected that patients in study 110 with a stop codon mutation had sweat chloride 
values above the threshold of 60 mmol/l. This is the case with the exception of a single patient 
randomised to placebo who had as a second CFTR mutation R553X-7T and a baseline sweat chloride of 
52.25 mmol/l. With the exception of G103X all other stop codon mutation are described in CFTR2. 
Patients carrying these mutations in the CFTR2 database have sweat chloride values well above 60 
mEq/L. No information has been found for G103X in CFTR2.  G103X is described in a single patient in 
CFTR1. The patient in study 110 with the genotype R117H-5T/G103X-7T was randomised to placebo, his 
baseline percent predicted FEV1 was 63.50% and his baseline sweat chloride 82 mmol/l.  Average sweat 
chloride of patients included in CFTR2 who carry one of the below mutations found in the second allele of 
the CFTR gen of patients enrolled in study 110 are as follows:     
•  2184InsA: this is an insertion/deletion mutation that it is considered a CF-causing mutation. The 
average sweat chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=132) in the CFTR2 database is 
98 mEq/L. 
•  3659DELC: this is an insertion/deletion mutation that is considered a CF-causing mutation. The 
average sweat chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=247) in the CFTR2 database is 
101 mEq/L. 
•  621+1G->T: This is an splice mutation that is considered a CF-causing mutation. The average sweat 
chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=793) in the CFTR2 database is 102 mEq/L. 
•  DELTA I507: This is an insertion/deletion mutation that that is considered a CF-causing mutation. The 
average sweat chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=306) in the CFTR2 database is 
97 mEq/L. 
•  R560T: This is a missense mutation that that is considered a CF-causing mutation. The average sweat 
chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=196) in the CFTR2 database is 101 mEq/L.  
•  S341P: This is a missense mutation that that is considered a CF-causing mutation. The average sweat 
chloride of patients with CF carrying this mutation (n=7) in the CFTR2 database is 98 mEq/L. This

mutation has been shown in vitro to cause a severe conductance defect that is not responsive to 
ivacaftor in vitro  (Van Goor F, Yu H, Buron B, Hoffman BJ.; 2014).  
For an additional patient the CFTR mutation in the second allele was unknown. Two patients were 
homozygous for R117H.  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The MAH provided an updated Pop-PK model for ivacaftor based on the prior model by adding data from 
study 110. In addition, revised plasma concentration datasets for studies 007 (single dose, cross-over, 
relative bioavailability/food study), study 101 (phase 2a dose escalation in CF patients with the  G551D 
mutation), study 102 (phase 3 study in CF patients aged 12 years and older with the G551D mutation), 
and 104 (phase 2 study in CF patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation) replaced previous 
datasets for this analysis, while data from study 002 (single dose, cross-over, relative bioavailability/food 
study) were not incorporated into the model due to the reported issues with the bioanalytical assay. The 
model does not incorporate metabolites M1 and M6. Thirty-four ivacaftor-treated patients with the 
R117H-CFTR mutation contributed to the analysis with 321 ivacaftor concentrations.  The original model 
was refined, starting from the base model, and the covariate modelling approach followed was similar to 
the one performed for the prior model, i.e., parameter estimation was emphasized in front of the 
stepwise hypothesis testing. Formulation was removed from the model as a potential covariate. The 
reason was that formulation was not a significant covariate in the previous model, consistent with the 
similar relative bioavailability for the 50% DL-SDD and 80% DL-SDD formulations. The base model 
incorporated weight as an allometric function for all structural parameters. Sex, age and patient status 
did not explain in a clinically meaningful way the variability in ivacaftor PK. Ivacaftor Cl/F was reduced by 
21% in patients with the R117H mutation compared to CF subjects with a gating mutation. The estimated 
values for CL/F (90%CI) was 14.3 (12.7, 16.0) L/h for patients with R117H mutation vs. 18.2 (16.9, 
19.3) L/h for patients with non-R117H mutation. This change is claimed not to be clinically significant.  
The typical estimates (90% CI) of PK model parameters for the reference subject (70 kg, male, 18 years, 
CF subject, non-R117H mutation) were 18.2 (16.9, 19.3) L/hr for CL/F, 246 (196, 254) L for apparent 
(oral) central volume of distribution (Vc/F), 150 (48.1, 362) L for apparent (oral) peripheral volume of 
distribution (Vp/F), 3.09 (1.98, 14.0) L/h for apparent (oral) intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), 2.96 
(2.88, 3.17) h for zero-order dose duration (D1) and 0.721 (0.530, 0.765) h-1 for first-order absorption 
rate (ka). Summary statistics for ivacaftor Cmin and AUC in study 110 show overlap with the values 
observed in previous studies. Similarly, when data from children aged 6 to 11 years in study 110 are 
added the same tendency remains, i.e. exposure in them is higher than in adults. An ivacaftor dose of 
150 mg q12 achieved a mean Cmin,ss of 1240 ng/mL in paediatric patients from 6 to 11 years of age 
while the same dose resulted in a mean Cmin,ss of 683 ng/mL for adults. Mean AUC was 19,300 ng/mL.h 
for 6 to 11 year olds, compared to 10,300 g/mL.h for adults.  
For comparison purposes with previous studies, the MAH was asked to provide non-compartmental PK 
analysis of study 110 sorted out by age subgroup. The non-compartmental PK analysis shows that there 
is a considerable overlapping in PK parameters between studies. Oral clearance per age group in study 
110 is similar to that of patients with G551D and non-G551D gating mutations with the only exception 
being the clearance observed in the adolescent group of study 102 which seems abnormally higher. 
No attempt has been made to include PD endpoints in the modelling exercise as the graphical inspection 
of potential relationships between PK parameters and PD endpoints such as change in percent predicted 
FEV1 did not give any insight in this direction. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The newly provided data refer to the analytical methods that have been used in study 110 in order to 
determine ivacaftor, M1 and M6 concentrations in human plasma. In addition, updated pop-PK analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020 
Page 13/57 
 
  
  
including data from study 110 was discussed. The pop PK analysis estimates that patients with a R117H 
mutation have a small reduction in clearance. A non-compartmental analysis of study 110 PK data by age 
group shows that there is a considerable overlapping in the PK parameters between this study and prior 
studies of ivacaftor. As in the prior studies exposure in children aged 6 to less than 12 years old is higher 
in relation to that seen in adult patients.  
The in vitro experiments performed by the MAH (and also published data) confirm that the main 
molecular defect of the aberrant R117H-CFTR protein is a defect in channel gating rather than a defect in 
conductance (also present). This justifies, from a pharmacodynamic point of view, treatment with 
ivacaftor of patients carrying this mutation.  
The clinical and functional analysis of the R117H mutation shows that it has variable expression or 
penetrance, i.e. it may result in a variable phenotype ranging from normal to CF. This phenotypic 
variability has been mostly attributed to the presence of a polypyrimidine (poly-T tract) variant located in 
another region of the CFTR gene in cis with R117H (Thauvin-Robinet, C. et al, 2009). Depending on which 
poly-T form is present in the same copy of the CFTR gene with R117H (i.e. in cis) various outcomes may 
occur. The R117H mutation in cis with the 5T variant typically results in more severe CF than the R117H 
mutation in cis with the 7T variant. Although many individuals with the R117H mutation associated to the 
poly-T variant 7T will not have CF lung disease some cases of disease with early symptoms have been 
reported in patients carrying a severe CF mutation (Thauvin-Robinet, C. et al, 2009). The 9T variant is 
highly unlikely to cause disease. Those subjects who have the mutation known to cause CF should 
undergo periodic assessment as the clinical manifestations of the disease may appear later in life. 
It can be concluded that by itself, R117H does not act as a CF-causing mutation. However, under certain 
circumstances, and, as always, when another CF-causing mutation is present, R117H can cause disease. 
In general, the mutations present in the second allele of the CFTR (i.e. in trans) of patients enrolled in 
study 110 are all considered disease-causing mutations in CFTR2. No information has been found in 
CFTR2 for G103X which seems to be a nonsense mutation, i.e. also a severe CFTR mutation. This 
mutation is described in a single patient in CFTR1. In study 110, patient with the genotype R117H-
5T/G103X-7T was randomised to placebo and his baseline percent predicted FEV1 was 63.50%, his 
baseline sweat chloride 82 mmol/l. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pop-PK analysis indicates that parameter estimates seen in patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation 
are similar to those of patients with CFTR mutations such as G551D, non-G551D gating mutations and 
patients homozygous for F508del-CFTR mutation with the exception of a reduction in clearance, for which 
no physiological explanation is evident but is attributed to variability. A non-compartmental PK analysis of 
study 110 shows that there is a considerable overlapping in PK parameters between studies. Oral 
clearance per age group in study 110 is similar to that of patients with G551D and non-G551D gating 
mutations. As in the prior studies, exposure in children aged 6 to less than 12 years old is higher than in 
adult patients. 
From a pharmacodynamic point of view, treatment with ivacaftor of patients carrying a R117H mutation is 
justified because the predominant in vitro defect of the aberrant R117H-CFTR protein is a defect in 
channel gating, although R117H is usually classified as a class IV, i.e. conductance mutation. However, 
given its phenotypic variability and the usually milder course of the disease with symptoms and signs 
appearing sometimes later in life, treatment with ivacaftor should be considered for patients with a 
disease phenotype compatible with cystic fibrosis.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose-response studies have been performed. Patients in studies 110 and 112 (open label extension) 
were treated with ivacaftor 150 mg q12h based on the in vitro potency of ivacaftor towards the R117H 
mutation relative to other mutations that cause gating defects as well as tolerability, pharmacokinetic 
data, and the responses observed in studies 102 and 103, supporting the initial MAA submission of 
Kalydeco. A population PK model was subsequently developed based on the prior model for ivacaftor and 
incorporating data from study 110 showing, as previously mentioned, that  parameter estimates seen in 
patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation are similar to those of patients with other CFTR mutations 
studied in the ivacaftor clinical programme. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Title of Study 
Study VX11-770-110: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Ivacaftor in Subjects With Cystic Fibrosis Who Have the R117H-CFTR 
Mutation. 
Methods 
Study 110 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicenter study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in patients with CF aged 6 years and older who have a 
R117H-CFTR mutation. As shown in figure below, the study included a Screening Period (Day -35 to Day -
15), a Run-In Period (Day -14 to Day -1 relative to the first dose of study drug), a Treatment Period (Day 
1 [first dose of study drug] to Week 24), and a Follow-up period 3 to 4 weeks after the last week of study 
drug. Study visits during the Treatment Period occurred on Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24. Patients 
were offered after the Follow-up period to be enrolled in study 112.  
Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CF (defined as a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L [by quantitative 
pilocarpine iontophoresis] OR 2 CF-causing mutations AND chronic sinopulmonary disease), aged 6 years 
and older, were required to have at least 1 allele of the R117H-CFTR mutation. Patients were excluded if 
they had a CFTR gene mutation leading to CFTR channel with gating defect (i.e., any 1 of the following 
mutations: G551D, G178R, G551S, S549N, S549R, G970R, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P, or G1349D). In 
addition, patients must have had percent predicted FEV1 of 40% to 90% inclusive for subjects aged 12 
years and older or 40% to 105% inclusive for subjects aged 6 to 11 years (inclusive) based on the 
Hankinson or Wang equations. The Hankinson standard was used for male subjects 18 years and older 
and female subjects 16 years and older. The Wang standard was used for male subjects aged 6 to 17 
years and for female subjects aged 6 to 15 years. 
Study drug (ivacaftor 150 mg or ivacaftor-matched placebo) was administered every 12 hours with fat-
containing food such as a standard “CF” high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack for up to 24 weeks in 
addition to patients’ usual prescribed CF therapy. An amendment of the study protocol allowed patients to 
receive hypertonic saline in an attempt to improve enrolment.  
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ivacaftor in patients CF who have the R117H-CFTR 
mutation using as the main efficacy variable the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline 
through week 24. Secondary endpoints were absolute change from baseline in BMI at week 24, absolute 
change from baseline in sweat chloride through week 24, change from baseline in the respiratory domain 
of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) through week 24 and time to first pulmonary 
exacerbation. Safety was a secondary objective. There were also a number of exploratory (tertiary)

endpoints.  
Enrolment was planned for a 40-80 subjects. An unblinded interim analysis for safety and efficacy was 
performed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) after 40 patients had completed Week 8 Visit and, 
based on the results and rules pre-specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), the DMC did not 
recommend any changes. Enrolment was kept open until the study was terminated early by the sponsor 
and recruitment was halted after 70 subjects were randomized, based upon the power calculations and 
after exceeding the minimum number of subjects defined in the protocol. Subjects who did not have their 
Week 24 Visit by the time of study termination were considered to have completed their assigned 
treatment duration and were offered enrolment study 112. All available data were included in the final 
analyses regardless of whether subjects completed 24 weeks of study drug treatment.  
Study 110 was planned to be analysed with approximately 80 subjects but recruitment was halted after 
70 subjects were randomised. The MAH was requested to provide a detailed justification for not 
proceeding to 80 patients based on power calculations and the arguments used to stop the trial 
recruitment. The MAH’s response states that based on feasibility, enrolment in study 110 was planned for 
a minimum of 40 and a maximum of approximately 80 subjects. The study enrolled at the high end of the 
planned range (70 subjects). The MAH estimate that 50 adult patients is equivalent to approximately 
18% of all the adult EU patients with an R117H allele, and approximately 40% to 60% of those eligible 
for a study requiring FEV1 less than 90 percent predicted. One of the scenarios for sample size estimation 
discussed by the MAH is that with 80 patients and assuming a treatment effect of 5% in absolute change 
from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 and a standard deviation (SD) of 8%, the study would have been 
powered at 80%. As a consequence, with 70 patients (8 of whom were not allowed to complete the full 
course of treatment), it seems that the study was underpowered. This may be justified by the limited 
number of patients available. According with the MAH there are about 1600 patients in Europe, Australia 
and the United States with a R117H allele and cystic fibrosis. The actual sample size of study 110 
represents about 5% of them.  The fact that 38 patients were screened but considered not eligible mainly 
due to the requirements on percent predicted FEV1 at baseline seems to reinforce the MAH’s view that 
the number of patients available meeting all the inclusion and exclusion criteria is limited.  
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratifying for age and percent predicted FEV1 at screening to 
receive either 150-mg ivacaftor or ivacaftor-matching placebo q12h, in addition to their usual prescribed 
CF therapy. Only two adolescent patients were enrolled which could be attributed to the fact that the 
specific inclusion criterion related to the baseline percent predicted FEV1 stipulated that patients aged 12 
years and older should have a percent predicted FEV equal or below 90%, which apparently is not the 
case for most adolescent patients with an R117H mutation. 
The MAH stated that the SAP was finalised 5 days before the database lock and the unblinding of data, 
which guarantees the independence of the SAP to the current data. The primary analysis for the primary 
efficacy variable (absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24) was based 
on a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) that includes all 
randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Data were assumed missing at random 
and no imputation of missing data was done for the primary analysis. The MAH was requested to clarify 
the assumption that missing data occurred indeed at random. According to the MAH, there was very little 
missing data in study 110, with only 2 subjects withdrawing from treatment during the study. These 2 
subjects withdrew due to a pregnancy and non-compliance with the study protocol. There were additional 
8 subjects who were not allowed to complete the full 24 weeks of treatment due to the sponsor’s decision 
to stop the study early. All of them were considered as missing at random (MAR). While the 
argumentation for considering some of the cases as MAR is not fully supported, it is acknowledged that 
the amount of missing data is limited and that the sensitivity analyses showed that results are consistent 
with the underlying assumptions. Given the small amount of missing data (with at least some of them 
likely to be MAR), the consistency of the treatment effect estimates results from the different approaches, 
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020 
Page 16/57 
 
  
  
it is considered that the selection of the estimate would be unlikely to impact study conclusions. In 
relation to the covariance matrix used in the MMRM analysis, it has been clarified that the compound 
symmetry covariance matrix was used because it was found to be suitable for analyses of spirometry 
data in previous studies of ivacaftor. Alternative covariance matrices have been used and all results were 
found to be consistent with that of the primary analysis. The consistency of treatment effect over 
different visits was evaluated using the primary MMRM with treatment by visit interaction added to the 
model. To assess the robustness of the primary analysis, sensitivity analyses including pattern mixture 
model, dropout reason-based multiple imputation (using ANCOVA), and stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum test 
were implemented. Regarding the Wilcoxon rank-sum test it has been clarified that no imputation of 
missing data was done for the primary analysis. Two patterns were modelled; the completer and early 
termination patterns. This is considered acceptable taking into account the small amount of missing data. 
A responder analysis was also conducted by categorizing the absolute change from baseline in percent 
predicted FEV1 at Week 24 as ≥3.5% or <3.5, ≥5% or <5%, ≥7.5% or <7.5%, and ≥10% or <10%. 
The analysis for rate of change from baseline in BMI (secondary efficacy variable) was based on a linear 
mixed effects model (LMM). The primary analyses for change from baseline in sweat chloride value and 
change from baseline in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score were similar to that of the primary efficacy 
endpoint, i.e. MMRM. Time to first pulmonary exacerbation was analyzed using Cox regression; 
additionally, Kaplan-Meier methods were used to produce graphical presentations of the survival curves 
by treatment and to estimate cumulative survival rates by treatment.  
Subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints were performed in the same manner as the 
primary analysis for the following subgroups: age at baseline (≥18 years and 6 to 11 years [inclusive]); 
percent predicted FEV1 at baseline (<70%, 70% to 90% [inclusive], and ≥90% of the predicted value); 
geographic region (North America and Europe); sex (female and male); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P 
aeruginosa) infection status at baseline (yes and no); and R117H allele poly-T variant (5T, 7T, or 9T). A 
subgroup analysis for subjects aged 12 to 17 years (inclusive) was not conducted because there were 
only 2 subjects in that age group.  
The tertiary efficacy variables included pulmonary exacerbations, change from baseline in non-respiratory 
domains of the CFQ-R through 24 weeks of treatment, rate of change from baseline in weight, rate of 
change from baseline in height, CF-related complications, change from baseline in inflammatory 
mediators, change from baseline in qualitative microbiology cultures, change from baseline in 
immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), and change from baseline in faecal elastase-1. The primary analysis 
for tertiary efficacy variables was performed for the FAS only.  
Following database lock, post-hoc analyses were carried out. These analyses were primarily focused on 
exploring any potential differences in results due to age, baseline percent predicted FEV1, and R117H 
allele poly-T variant. Additional summary statistics were also carried out based on age, baseline percent 
predicted FEV1, and genotype characteristics.  
Interim analysis (IA) for safety and efficacy was carried out after 40 subjects had completed the Week 8 
visit. In order to control the overall type I error rate, a Bonferroni-type adjustment was applied. This 
reflected an allocated significance of 0.0052 for the IA. The significance level for the final analysis (week 
24) was set at 0.0448 as enrolment was not stopped after the IA. The IA was conducted by a CRO 
independent of the sponsor; the CRO communicated directly with the DMC, as described in DMC Charter. 
Following review of the IA data and after applying the pre-specified rules, the DMC recommendation was 
to continue with enrolment. While the Bonferroni- type adjustment to control the overall type I error has 
not been justified and it is not usually applied for conducting interim analysis, the alpha levels are 
agreeable. The plan to handle multiplicity as stated in the SAP is endorsed. Thus, the level of significance 
is set at 4.48% two-sided level.

Results 
Participant flow 
The above table shows patient disposition in study 110. One hundred and eight patients were screened, 
out of whom 70 patients were randomised to ivacaftor (n=36) or to placebo (n=34). Four subjects in the 
ivacaftor group and 2 subjects in the placebo group were excluded from the PPS due to major protocol 
violations. Four subjects in the ivacaftor group and 4 subjects in the placebo group were excluded from 
the CCS because they did not complete the full 24-week treatment period. A total of 32 in the ivacaftor 
group and 35 in the placebo group completed their full assigned duration of dosing. Two subjects in the 
ivacaftor group discontinued treatment prematurely: 1 because of noncompliance with the ophthalmologic 
examination and 1 because of pregnancy. Of the 67 subjects who completed the assigned duration of 
dosing, 59 subjects (28 in the ivacaftor group and 31 subjects in the placebo group) completed the full 
24-week Treatment Period. The remaining 8 subjects did not complete 24 weeks of treatment because 
the study was terminated early by the sponsor.

Recruitment 
Study 110 was initiated on 03 July 2012 and completed on 25 October 2013 in 27 study sites in North 
America (25) and Europe (2 centres in the UK where 15 patients were randomised).  
Conduct of the study 
The clinical study protocol was amended 4 times, 1 of which was a country-specific amendment for the 
UK. The final protocol (Version 4.0) is dated 11 June 2013. The main amendments were related to the 
clarification of the statistical analysis that was to be performed for the interim analysis and the control of 
the type I error. Also, amendments had to be implemented to deal with the analysis of patients who had 
not had their Week 24 Visit completed in the event of early study termination. These patients were to be 
considered to have completed their assigned treatment duration. In addition, clarifications were provided 
regarding concomitant medication, e.g. cycling antibiotic therapy. The exclusion of hypertonic saline use 
as part of the concomitant medication was removed.

A total of 70 patients were randomized (36 to placebo and 34 to ivacaftor) and 69 of them were dosed (a 
patient randomised to placebo was never dosed). Therefore, 69 patients were included in the full analysis 
set (FAS), i.e., 35 in the placebo group and 34 in the ivacaftor group. The Per Protocol Set (PPS) includes 
63 patients, i.e. 33 patients on placebo and 30 on ivacaftor. Six patients were excluded from the PPS for 
major protocol violations. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy variable of study 110 was the absolute change from baseline in percent predicted 
FEV1 through week 24, which is the recommended primary clinical endpoint in efficacy studies for CF 
given that lung function in cystic fibrosis CF declines with age and is a significant predictor of mortality.  
The mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24 by MMRM for the 
FAS was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group versus 0.46 percentage points in the placebo 
group. The estimated treatment difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was 2.11% (-1.13, 
5.35). This difference was not statistically significant.  The MAH stated that this result, even if not 
statistically significant, favours ivacaftor. However, the lack of statistical significance and the 95%CI 
indicate that either an improvement or impairment are possible. In contrast, the analysis of the mean 
absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 by mixed model from Week 24 through the Follow-up Visit (a 
treatment-free period after the last dose of ivacaftor or placebo) in study 110 showed a treatment 
difference (95%CI) of ivacaftor versus placebo of -2.32 (-4.28, -0.36). Results of the sensitivity analyses 
of the primary efficacy variable were consistent with the results of the primary analysis, i.e. no statistical 
significant differences between both groups of treatment were seen. Similarly, analysis of the primary 
variable in the PPS and CCS were consistent with the results of the analysis in the FAS.  
The absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at Week 24 for individual subjects is 
presented in figure below.  
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020 
Page 22/57 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Of the 28 patients in the ivacaftor group who completed 24 weeks of treatment, 20 had an improvement 
in percent predicted FEV1 after 24 weeks of treatment, 1 had no change in percent predicted FEV1, and 7 
had a decline in percent predicted FEV1. Six of the 7 patients in the ivacaftor group who had a decline in 
percent predicted FEV1 were children 6 to 11 years old.  
Table below shows the results of a responder analysis conducted by categorizing the absolute change 
from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24 as ≥ 3.5% or <3.5%, ≥ 5% or <5%, ≥ 7.5% or 
<7.5%, ≥ 10% or <10%.  
Narratives were requested for those patients on ivacaftor who had an increase from baseline in percent 
predicted <5% as well as for patients on placebo whose percent predicted FEV1 increased ≥5%. A total 
of 16 patients in the ivacaftor group had an absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 <5% at Week 24 
(11 females and 5 males). Of these, 7 (43.75%) had a decline in percent predicted FEV1 that ranged 
between -7.3 (an 11-year-old female patient with R117H-7T/F508del-9T) to -2.0 (a 9-year-old female 
with R117H-7T/F508del-9T). Five patients were females and 2 male patients. Six of these were children 
(i.e. under the age of 12 years) and the poly-T variant was 7T in four cases. Two patients with a stop 
codon mutation in the second CFTR allele had a decreased of -4.7 (an 8-year-old male patient with

R117H-7T/S489X-7T) and almost no change from baseline (0.6) in the case of a 22-year-old female 
patient with R117H-5T/G542X-9T.    
Overall, the above results show that children and patients with the 7T variant tend to respond worse to 
ivacaftor, although the MAH suggest that age confounds the results from the R117H-7T subgroup. While 
the analysis of the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 for all patients by sex shows that female 
patients have a better response to ivacaftor, among patients in the ivacaftor group who experienced a 
decreased from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 5 were female patients versus 2 male patients. 
Sweat chloride 
The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 24 was -26.3 mmol/L for the 
ivacaftor group and -2.3 mmol/L for the placebo group. The treatment difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor 
versus placebo was -24.0 mmol/L (-28.0, -19.9). Table below shows the results of a responder analysis 
that was conducted by categorizing absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 24 as 
≥5 or <5 mmol/L decrease, ≥10 or <10 mmol/L decrease, ≥15 or <15 mmol/L decrease, and ≥20 or 
<20 mmol/L decrease.

baseline in sweat chloride and for placebo patients with a decrease equal to or above 10 mmol/L. In 
addition, waterfall plots of changes from baseline in sweat chloride at week 2 and at week 24 (see figure 
below) were provided with the individual genotypes identified.

Only two patients on ivacaftor experienced a decrease in sweat chloride below 10 mmol/L. One of them 
was a 54-year-old male who was homozygous for R117H-7T and an 18-year-old female with R117H-
5T/F508del-9T. Both of them had sweat chloride values at baseline below 60 mmol/l (i.e. 43 and 45.8 
mmol/l) and they experienced a mild decrease in sweat chloride at week 24 of -3.75 and -9.5 mmol/l, 
respectively. The number of patients on placebo who had a decrease in sweat chloride >10 mmol/L at 
week 24 was 17, most of them with the 5T variant (12 patients). The decrease ranged between -32 
mmol/L and -12.25 mmol/L. This includes three patients with a stop codon mutation in the second CFTR 
allele. While variability in the measure of sweat chloride may explain some of these changes, it is difficult 
to explain the highest decreases. Data at week 2 of study 112 shows that almost all of these patients had 
a decrease in sweat chloride when they were switched to ivacaftor but the magnitude of the change was, 
in general, limited. The change in sweat chloride at week 24 is based on 30 patients on placebo and 26 
on ivacaftor out of the 35 and 34 in the overall FAS population of study 110. It is assumed that 8 patients 
(4 in each group) are those who were not allowed to complete 24 weeks of treatment. Two additional 
patients withdrew due to a pregnancy and non-compliance with the study protocol. Therefore, sweat 
chloride values are not available for 3 additional patients.  
Body Mass Index (BMI) 
The mean absolute change from baseline in BMI at Week 24 by LMM in the FAS was 0.49 kg/m2 in the 
ivacaftor group versus 0.23 kg/m2 in the placebo group. The treatment difference (95%CI) was 0.26 
kg/m2 (-1.57, 2.10). The mean change from baseline in BMI-for-age z-score (CDC growth chart for the 
22 patients who were 20 years of age or younger) at Week 24 by LMM was 0.13 points in the ivacaftor 
group versus 0.03 points in the placebo group. The treatment difference (95% CI) was 0.10 points (-
0.57, 0.77). The result is not surprising since the body weight in these patients was normal (some 
patients were even overweight or obese) and the majority of subject were pancreatic sufficient. However, 
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020 
Page 25/57 
 
  
  
 
it would be informative to look at individual changes from baseline in body weight/BMI in underweight or 
pancreatic insufficient patients. Hence, the MAH was requested to perform an additional analysis in such 
patients. The MAH did not provide the requested data; only individual baseline characteristics and 
summary statistics were presented. Two and 8 patients were underweight at baseline in the ivacaftor and 
placebo groups, respectively. This rate is in line with the imbalance in the rate of pancreatic insufficient 
patients in the ivacaftor and placebo groups. Both underweight ivacaftor patients were <11 years old and 
carried R117H-5T variant. One of the underweight ivacaftor-treated patients had weight data only until 
week 2 visit, and this patient had a weight gain of 1 kg from baseline by week 2. The other patient had a 
weight gain of 1 kg (increase in weight-for-age z-score of 0.35) and a BMI increase of 0.710 (z-score: 
0.4390) by week 24. According to the data provided there was at least one patient in the placebo group 
who had weight gain of 2 kg (BMI increase: 0.94 kg/m2). All pancreatic insufficient patients (at baseline, 
based on fecal-elastase-1 values) were older than 40 years, their genotype was R117H-5T/ F508DEL-9T. 
Two of them received ivacaftor, 5 received placebo. All pancreatic insufficient patients were well-
nourished or even obese. One patient in ivacaftor put on weight by 1.3 kg (BMI increased by 0.49 kg/m2) 
and the other one 2 kg (BMI increased by 0.59 kg/m2) during the 24 week period. There were only 3 
patients in the placebo group who had weight and BMI values at week 24, the values varies between high 
boundaries, one of them lost weight by 4 kg and other put on weight by 3 kg during 24 weeks. Nutritional 
status has been improved in the two ivacaftor-patients, but it cannot be clearly concluded that this 
favourable effect is different from placebo.   
Overall, based on the currently available data, a conclusion cannot be drawn on whether ivacaftor may 
improve nutritional status in underweight or pancreatic insufficient patients. 
Respiratory domain of the CFQ-R 
The mean absolute change from baseline in the pooled CFQ-R respiratory domain score through Week 24 
was greater in the ivacaftor group (7.6 points) than in the placebo group (-0.8 points). The estimated 
treatment difference (95%CI) was 8.4 points (2.17, 14.61).  
Pulmonary exacerbations 
All protocol defined pulmonary exacerbations occurred in patients ≥18 years of age. In the placebo group 
(n=35) 13 patients had 17 pulmonary exacerbations (event rate: 0.30) while in the ivacaftor group 
(n=34) 11 patients had 13 events (event rate: 0.25). The rate ratio (95%CI) was 0.84 (0.41, 1.73). The 
number of patients with pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalisation or IV therapy was 6 on 
placebo and 2 on ivacaftor. The proportion of event-free patients was 0.69 in the ivacaftor group versus 
0.58 in the placebo group. The calculated hazard ratio of 0.93 was not statistically significant. The 
survival curve shows that there seems to be a different temporal pattern with more pulmonary 
exacerbations in the ivacaftor group at the beginning of the study (e.g. Days 0-15: 3 events; Days 16-
56: 4 events) than in the placebo group (1 and 2 events, respectively). Whether this is related to the 
effect that has been described for some ivacaftor-treated patients, especially at the beginning of 
treatment, related to the increase in pulmonary secretions is not known.    
In summary, study 110 did not meet the primary objective, which was to show that treatment with 
ivacaftor for 24 weeks was superior to placebo as the treatment difference in the absolute change from 
baseline in percent predicted FEV1 was not statistically significant. As for the secondary variables, 
changes in sweat chloride and in the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R show larger changes in the 
ivacaftor group. The sweat chloride is considered a marker of the CFTR activity. The results of study 110 
in terms of sweat chloride are reassuring when the in vitro pharmacodynamic data is considered but so 
far no correlation with the change in percent predicted FEV1 could have been shown.

Table below summarizes the tertiary efficacy endpoint results for the FAS (with the exception of number 
and count of pulmonary exacerbations that have been shown above). No analysis of CF-related 
complications was performed because no episodes of pancreatitis or DIOS occurred during the study. 
Ancillary analyses 
The following pre-planned subgroups analyses were included in the SAP for the primary and secondary 
efficacy variables:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Age Group at Baseline (6 to 11years, 12 to 17 years, and ≥  18 years); 
Percent Predicted FEV1 Severity at Baseline (<70%, 70% to 90%, >90% of the predicted value); 
Geographic Region (US and EU); 
Sex (Female and Male); 
Pseudomonas infection status at baseline (yes or no); 
Poly T status (5T, 7T, 9T).  
Only subgroup analyses by age at baseline, by poly-T variant and by baseline percent predicted are 
detailed. For the remaining subgroups above mentioned the results of the analyses performed on the 
absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 are as follows: Female patients had a larger 
treatment difference (95%CI) than male patients, i.e. females: 3.66 percentage points (-0.92, 8.24); 
males: 0.09 percentage points (-5.04, 5.21). This difference is not explained by imbalances in age or 
R117H poly-T variant between the male and female patients, i.e. it remains basically unexplained. Among 
patients in the ivacaftor group who experienced a decreased from baseline in percent predicted FEV1, 5 
were female patients versus 2 male patients. The treatment differences (95%CI) were larger in Europe 
than in North America; i.e. North America: 1.78 percentage points (-2.02, 5.59); Europe: 4.15 
percentage points (-4.82, 13.12). Patients with P aeruginosa infection at baseline had a larger treatment 
difference than subjects without P aeruginosa infection at baseline, i.e., infected: 3.53 percentage points 
(-1.91, 8.98); not infected: 0.87 percentage points (-3.08, 4.81). Sweat chloride response was consistent 
across all subgroups and for all of them treatment differences favoured the ivacaftor group. The analysis

percentage points (1.63) in the placebo group (n=14) and 2.81 percentage points (1.70) in the 
ivacaftor group (n=14). The treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was 2.60 percentage

group (n=7). The treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was -4.32 percentage points (-
9.93, 1.29). 
Larger absolute changes in percent predicted FEV1 were seen for the ivacaftor group across the above 
subgroups of baseline percent predicted FEV1, with the exception of the baseline percent predicted FEV1 
>90% subgroup. The figure below summarises these results. 
Study110: Treatment Difference in Mean Absolute Change from Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV1 Trough 
Week 24 by Subgroups, Full Analysis Set (all patients) 
Patients ≥ 18 Years of Age (26 patients on placebo; 24 on ivacaftor): The mean absolute change from 
baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through Week 24 by MMRM for patients ≥ 18 years of age was greater 
for the ivacaftor group (4.51 percentage points) than for the placebo group (-0.46 percentage points). 
The treatment difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was 4.97 percentage points (1.15, 8.78). 
Based on the fact that a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference favouring ivacaftor versus 
placebo was observed in the age group of patients aged 18 years and older, the MAH sought an indication 
limited to adult patients. This, in the opinion of the MAH, was scientifically sound because it was already 
anticipated that children and adolescents could show different efficacy profiles in response to ivacaftor 
treatment primarily because of the differences in the manifestation of disease at different ages. 
Specifically, CF patients with the R117H-CFTR mutation have less advanced disease in childhood and 
adolescence compared to older patients. Therefore, a pre-planned subgroup analysis by patient age was 
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020 
Page 28/57 
 
  
  
 
included in the SAP for the primary and secondary endpoints (although these pre-planned subgroup 
analyses were not intended for regulatory claims).    
Consistently with an effect of ivacaftor is the fact that during the (treatment-free) Follow-up Period of 
Study 110, a greater decline in percent predicted FEV1 occurred in the ivacaftor group (-3.15%) than in 
the placebo group (-1.13%). A responder analyses for the mean absolute change from baseline in percent 
predicted FEV1 through Week 24 shows that 13 (54.2%) ivacaftor-treated patients experienced an 
increase in percent predicted FEV1 of ≥ 5% versus 4 (15.4%) placebo-treated patients.  
Individual patient responses for the absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at Week 24 
for subjects ≥18 years of age who completed 24 weeks of treatment are shown in the below waterfall 
plot. 
Of the 21 ivacaftor-treated patients with 24 week data, 19 had an increase in percent predicted FEV1 and 
1 had no change in percent predicted FEV1. Only an ivacaftor-treated  patient had a decline in percent 
predicted FEV1 at Week 24. This patient’s percent predicted FEV1 values were low throughout the study: 
42.3 percentage points on Day 1; 41.91 percentage points at Week 2; 44.66 percentage points at Week 
4; 40.88 percentage points at Week 8; 40.88 percentage points at Week 16, and 37.44 percentage points 
at Week 24. This patient did not have a pulmonary exacerbation or other respiratory adverse events 
reported around the time of the Week 24 visit.  
Regarding the secondary variables, the mean change from baseline in sweat chloride in the placebo group 
was -4.0 mmol/L and -25.9 mmol/L in the ivacaftor group (n=23). The treatment difference (95%CI) 
between groups was -21.9 mmol/L (-26.5,-17.3). Larger mean changes were also observed for the mean 
change in BMI (placebo: 0.22 kg/m2; ivacaftor: 0.53 kg/m2) and in the pooled respiratory domain of the 
CFQ-R (placebo: -0.46; ivacaftor: 12.18). Protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbations occurred only in 
patients in this age group and, consequently, the results described for the overall population apply.

As a consequence of the difference observed in this age group in the change in percent predicted FEV1, 
post-hoc analyses (following database lock) were also carried out in this age group and in the 6 to 11 
year-old group. These analyses were primarily focused on exploring any potential differences in results 
due to subject age, baseline percent predicted FEV1, and R117H allele poly-T variant. Additional summary 
statistics were also carried out based on subject age, baseline percent predicted FEV1, and genotype 
characteristics.  
Results of these subgroup analyses limited to the subjects ≥ 18 years old are presented in figure below 
for the primary efficacy variable. 
In the above subgroup analyses limited to patients ≥  18 years old, the following trends were observed: 
Patients in the ivacaftor group with a baseline percent predicted FEV1 of ≥ 70% to ≤ 90% showed a larger 
mean change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 (5.09 percentage points) than patients in the 
placebo group (-1.35 percentage points). Similar results were observed in patients with a baseline 
percent predicted FEV1 of <70% (4.46 and 0.45 percentage points respectively).  When the geographical 
region is considered, the mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was similar between the 2 
subgroups (Europe: 4.51 percentage points; North America: 4.81 percentage points). Treatment 
differences for change from baseline in sweat chloride (Europe: -22.6 mmol/L; North America: -22.9 
mmol/L) were similar for both geographic regions. When P aeruginosa infection status at baseline is 
considered, a larger treatment difference in the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was seen for 
the patients not infected with P aeruginosa than those infected (infected: 4.32 percentage points; not 
infected: 5.73 percentage points). The treatment differences for absolute change from baseline in sweat 
chloride (infected: -23.0 mmol/L; not infected: -24.4 mmol/L) were similar for both subgroups. 
Patients aged 12 to 17 years (a patient in each group): No statistical analysis was conducted because 
only 2 patients were enrolled.  
First patient was a 13-year-old female with CFTR genotype R117H-7T/F508DEL-9T. At baseline, this 
patient had a percent predicted FEV1 of 87.63, a sweat chloride value of 44.25 mmol/L, a BMI of 28.04 
kg/m2, and a CFQ-R respiratory domain score of 100 points. The patient was discontinued from the study 
Assessment report

Page 30/57 
 
  
  
 
 
16 days after the first dose of ivacaftor due to non-compliance in completing the required ophthalmologic 
examination at Screening. The only Treatment Period visit that the subject had was the Week 2 Visit, at 
which there was no substantial change in percent predicted FEV1 (baseline 87.63; Week 2: 88.23), but 
the patient’s sweat chloride showed a -17.25 mmol/L absolute change from baseline.  
Second patient, randomised to placebo, was a 17-year-old female with a CFTR genotype R117H-
5T/W1282X-7T, who completed the full 24 weeks of treatment. At baseline, the subject had a percent 
predicted FEV1 of 88.67 percentage points, a sweat chloride value of 74.75 mmol/L, a BMI of 21.86 
kg/m2, and a CFQ-R respiratory domain score of 77.78 points. At the Week 24 Visit, the patient had a 
7.53 percentage points absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline and a corresponding 
increase in CFQ-R respiratory domain score to 94.44 points. The subject’s sweat chloride value at the 
Week 24 Visit was slightly higher than at baseline. 
Patients 6 to 11 years of age (8 patients on placebo; 9 on ivacaftor): Table below summarizes the 
primary endpoint, the secondary endpoints, and the relative change from baseline in percent predicted 
FEV1 results for FAS patients 6 to 11 years of age (both inclusive). No protocol-defined pulmonary 
exacerbations occurred in children 6 to 11 years of age (inclusive) during the treatment period.  
Absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 was 3.51 and -2.82% percentage points in the 
placebo and ivacaftor groups, respectively with the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the 
treatment difference between ivacaftor and placebo below zero. This is not consistent with the results 
observed for this age group in studies 103 (G551D-CFTR mutation) and 111 (non-G551D-CFTR gating 
mutations) where the difference between placebo and ivacaftor in the absolute change in percent 
predicted FEV1 favoured ivacaftor and was above 10 percentage points. The MAH suggest that this 
appears to be a spurious result driven by an unusual placebo response and generally no or minimal 
change in FEV1 in subjects in the ivacaftor group. The placebo group had an improvement in mean 
percent predicted FEV1, from 93.98% at baseline to 98.43% overall post-baseline, while the ivacaftor 
group had a slight decline in mean percent predicted FEV1 from 97.49% at baseline to 96.25% overall 
post-baseline. To further explore this issue a comparison of the change from baseline in percent predicted 
FEV1 values was performed that showed that in the placebo group 4 patients had a decrease in percent

predicted FEV1 between Screening and Baseline, and 6 ivacaftor patients had an increase in percent 
predicted FEV1 between Screening and Baseline. This could have contributed to the observed treatment 
difference in the primary endpoint in subjects 6 to 11 years of age. The run-in period in study 110 was 
used to stabilise patients before dosing them. Those patients whose clinical status was not stable during 
this period were excluded from the study but it would appear that there were a number of patients whose 
FEV1 increased or decreased during this period. The MAH was requested to discuss how exclusion criteria 
were applied at screening and baseline in study 110, particularly in the youngest age group.  Patients 
were required to be clinically stable during screening; however, FEV1 measurement is associated with a 
degree of inherent variability and can vary between visits, even in subjects who are clinically stable. In 
this respect, the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria for spirometry set an 
upper limit of 150 mL for variance between pulmonary function tests at the same visit/time (or 100 mL if 
the FVC is ≤ 1.0 L). It is accepted that variation in percent predicted FEV1 can be seen even in stable 
patients. However, it is still unclear why some subjects had a decrease in percent predicted FEV1 between 
screening and baseline in the placebo group. Moreover, the fluctuation in spirometry parameters seems 
very high and does not seem to be related either to the study drug or to changes in clinical status. 
Further clarification was requested for four patients who showed substantial changes in spirometry 
parameters that could not be explained either by the study drug or by changes in clinical status. No 
appropriate explanation for the high observed variability in FEV1 could be given other than the expected 
high variability in spirometry in young children in general.  
Subgroup analyses by R117H poly-T variant (5T or 7T): The CFTR poly-T tract is present in every copy of 
the CFTR gene and occurs as 1 of 3 variants (5T, 7T, or 9T). R117H-5T results in a more severe disease 
phenotype than R117H-7T, while R117H-9T is highly unlikely to cause disease. CF genotyping was 
performed on all subjects at screening. Although this analysis provided the subjects' poly-T variant 
genotype, it did not specify the phase of the mutations, i.e. which CFTR allele each variant was located 
on, since different sequencing assay would have to be used. Therefore, allele-specific long-range PCR was 
conducted using an optional DNA sample (Sample A) from the subjects who consented to that sample. 
For subjects who either had DNA samples that could not be analysed or did not consent to the optional 
DNA samples, the poly-T variant for the R117H allele was derived if the subject had either a 
R117H/F508DEL or R117H/R117H genotype. All subjects who had the R117H/F508DEL genotype were 
considered to have one 9T variant; it was assumed that the 9T was on the F508DEL allele, and therefore 
the other variant (5T or 7T) was on the R117H allele. This assumption was considered valid because: (1) 
if a subject had R117H-9T they would have had a very mild disease phenotype (e.g., sweat chloride <60 
mmol/L) and would not have qualified for entry into the study, and (2) a survey of the scientific literature 
indicates that the F508DEL allele has always been reported with the 9T variant except in some Lebanese 
Maronites, 1 North Iranian individual, and 1 Hispanic individual. For subjects who did not have either a 
R117H/F508DEL or R117H/R117H genotype, the 5T/7T status for the R117H allele could not be derived. 
In the FAS population, the number of patients with confirmed R117H-5T was 24 in the placebo group and 
14 on the ivacaftor group. These figures for the R117H-7T poly-T variant were 5 and 11, respectively. 
The poly-T variant 5T (which usually confers an increased risk of disease severity) was more frequent in 
patients randomised to placebo. The poly-T variant that predominates in patients with a second mutation 
other than F508del is 7T. The confirmed plus derived dataset includes the following number of patients: 
27 patients on placebo and 21 on ivacaftor with the 5T variant while for the 7T variant the numbers are 7 
and 12 respectively. Eight of these 19 patients were children. The largest difference is seen in the number 
of patients in the ivacaftor group for whom a 5T variant has been derived, i.e. 7 patients. The analysis by 
poly-T status 5T or 7T in the confirmed plus derived dataset is based on some assumptions for 15 
patients for whom the poly-T status could not be identified. The assumption related to the poly-T variant 
9T in cis with the F508del mutation is acceptable. However, it is unclear how assignment of the poly-T 
status in cis with R117H was done for these patients with no confirmed variant. Overall, there were 19 
patients with sweat chloride below 60 mmol/l (10 on ivacaftor and 9 on placebo). Out of these, 15 (7 on 
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020

placebo and 8 on ivacaftor) had sweat chloride values below 60 mmol/l and a confirmed poly-T status. In 
10 of them the confirmed variant is 7T and in the remaining 5 it is 5T. Therefore, the assumption that if a 
subject had R117H-9T they would have had a very mild disease phenotype (e.g., sweat chloride <60 
mmol/L) does not seem completely justified. The analysis by poly-T status in the confirmed plus derived 
dataset should be viewed with caution. The analysis performed in the confirmed data set of the FAS 
shows that the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 in patients with the 5T variant was 
0.73 percentage points (1.20) in the placebo group and 6.02 percentage points (1.57) in the ivacaftor 
group. The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 5.3 percentage points [95% CI 1.3, 
9.3]. For the 7T variant the results were as follows: placebo: -0.92 percentage points (3.09); ivacaftor: -
0.72 percentage points (2.10). The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus placebo was 0.2 percentage 
points (95% CI -8.1, 8.5). 
In the confirmed plus derived dataset, the mean (SD) baseline percent predicted FEV1 for patients with a 
5T variant was 68.30 (18.84) in the placebo group and 70.48 (17.40) in the ivacaftor group. At Week 24 
these figures were as follows: 71.16 (23.10) and 74.50 (17.23) respectively. The mean (SD) absolute 
change from baseline at week 24 was 1.57 (6.45) and 6.30 (7.33) in the placebo and ivacaftor groups, 
respectively. The estimated (by MMRM) treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was 3.19 (-0.48, 
6.87). At week 24 percent predicted FEV1 was only available for 24 and 18 patients in the placebo and 
ivacaftor groups respectively. As for patient with the 7T variant (confirmed plus derived), the mean (SD) 
baseline percent predicted FEV1 was 81.05 (9.01) in the placebo group and 84.85 (20.48) in the ivacaftor 
group. At Week 24 these figures were as follows: 82.32 (10.08) and 87.94 (19.24) respectively. The 
mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at week 24 was 2.85 (5.93) and 0.45 (5.82) in the placebo and 
ivacaftor groups respectively. The estimated (by MMRM) treatment difference (95%CI) between groups 
was -1.46 (-8.69, 5.77). At week 24 percent predicted FEV1 was only available for 6 and 9 patients in the 
placebo and the ivacaftor groups respectively.  
Regarding sweat chloride the results of the absolute mean change from baseline favour the ivacaftor 
group in patients with a 5T or a 7T variant. For patients with the 5T variant, the mean (SD) absolute 
change at week 24 was -6.6 mmol/l (19.2) in the placebo group and -35.4 mmol/L (14.3) in the ivacaftor 
group. The estimated (by MMRM) treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was −25.1 (-30.1, -
20.0). For patients with a 7T variant, the mean (SD) absolute change at week 24 was −9.9 mmol/l (10.3) 
and −20.4 mmol/l (10.0) for the placebo and the ivacaftor groups respectively. The estimated (by MMRM) 
treatment difference (95%CI) between groups was −20.6 (-28.1, -13.1).

A waterfall plot analysis of individual subject responses at Week 24 suggests that some R117H-7T 
subjects may respond to ivacaftor treatment (see figure below).

It has been considered whether R117H-7T patients should be excluded from the indication as this variant 
leads to normal splicing and is rarely associated with disease manifestations and these are usually mild. 
However, severe lung disease has been also described in these patients and consequently their inclusion 
in the indication is supported but a cautionary warning is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC with a 
cross-reference to section 5.1 indicating the limitations of the effect seen in ivacaftor in patients with a 7T 
variant.  The results by the poly-T variant 7T previously shown may be confounded by age given that out 
of the 19 patients (confirmed plus derived dataset) in study 110 with an R117H-7T allele, 8 were children 
6 to 11 years of age. Of the patients ≥18 years of age with an R117H-7T allele, 4 were in the placebo 
group and 6 were in the ivacaftor group. Although these numbers are small, no clear FEV1 response was 
evident in the subgroup of subjects ≥ 18 years of age with an R117H-7T allele either. This issue should be

taken into account by prescribing physicians. If treatment with ivacaftor is being considered for patients 
with an R117H mutation the phase of the poly-T variant should be identified whenever possible, as 
described in the SmPC. 
Subgroup analyses by the second CFTR mutation: The majority of subjects (76.8%) had the F508del 
mutation on the second allele. Although ivacaftor can potentiate F508del-CFTR, the processing defect 
caused by F508del results in minimal amounts of CFTR reaching the surface, and ivacaftor treatment did 
not result in clinical benefit in subjects homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Each of the other 
second alleles was present in no more than 2 subjects. The non-F508del second alleles are known to 
produce either no or truncated CFTR protein (2184InsA, 3659DelC, 621+1G>T, E60X, G103X, G542X, 
R553X, S489X, and W1282X) to cause severe processing defects (F508Del, R560T, and DelI507), or to 
cause a severe conductance defect that is not responsive to ivacaftor in vitro (S341P). One ivacaftor-
treated patient with the genotype R117H-7T/R553X-7T had, however, a baseline sweat chloride below of 
52.3 mmol/l. Table below shows summary statistics of the mean (SD) absolute change from baseline at 
Week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 for patients in the FAS population.

The data above presented suggest that patients with a stop codon mutation responded worse to ivacaftor 
than patients with the F508del mutation as shown by an absolute change from baseline at week 24 of -
2.04 versus 4.9 percentage points. In the FAS population the number of patients with the F508del 
mutation is 25 (71.4%) on placebo and 28 (82.4%) on ivacaftor. In age group ≥18 years of age, 19 
patients in each group (73.1% on placebo, 79.2% on ivacaftor) had this mutation in the second allele of 
the CFTR.

codon mutations and “other” mutations in the second allele. Only two patients (a child and an adult) were 
in both the stop codon and ivacaftor groups while five patients (an adolescent and four adults) were in 
both the stop codon and placebo groups.  Due to the limited data, a firm conclusions on whether patients 
with a second stop codon mutation respond worse to ivacaftor cannot be made. The mean change from 
baseline in percent predicted FEV1 was -4.65 (child) and 0.56 (adult) percentage points in the two 
ivacaftor-treated patients. In terms of the mean change in sweat chloride, data at week 24 are not 
available for the child while the adult patient showed a decrease of 51.5 mmol/L from baseline. In 
patients aged 18 years and older, an analysis is presented by the second CFTR allele (i.e. F508del; Other) 
that shows the following: nineteen patients in each group had F508del as the second CFTR mutation in 
this age group; seven patients on placebo and 5 on ivacaftor had other mutations. The treatment 
difference (95%CI) for those with the F508del was 4.41 percentage points (-0.36, 9.18). The treatment 
difference (95%CI) for patients with other mutations was 6.85 (0.5414, 13.1500) percentage points.

Analysis description  A number of tertiary endpoints, additional spirometry variables, subgroup 
analyses and post-hoc analyses have also been performed.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
No analyses were performed across trials. However, baseline data and disease characteristics of patients 
enrolled in study 110 were compared to those of patients enrolled in studies 102 (adult and adolescent 
patients with a G551D mutation), 103 (patients aged 6 to 11 years with a G551D mutation) and study 
111 (patients aged 6 years and older with a non-G551D-CFTR gating mutation). It is concluded that 
consistently with the milder phenotype associated with the R117H-CFTR mutation patients in study 110 
had lower mean sweat chloride concentrations (approximately 70 mmol/L) than subjects from studies 
102, 103, and 111 (approximately 100 mmol/L). The recruited R117H subjects had well preserved BMIs 
(mean: 23.76 kg/m2) and a high proportion with pancreatic sufficiency. Regarding percent predicted 
study 110 patients who were 6 to 11 years of age had a baseline mean percent predicted FEV1 
approximately 10 percentage points higher than study 103 patients and a categorical distribution 
favouring higher baseline percent predicted FEV1 values. Similarly, the results of these studies have been 
discussed to give context for the efficacy claim of study 110. In studies 102, 103, and 111 (Part 1) 
analysis of the primary endpoint (absolute change in percent predicted FEV1) showed a substantial 
treatment effect in favour of ivacaftor that was statistically significant. Treatment differences in mean 
absolute change from baseline through week 24 in percent predicted FEV1 were in all cases above 10.0 
percentage points. In particular, in study 103 the treatment difference was 12.5 percentage points. The 
relevance of data from the previous studies of ivacaftor to support its efficacy in the age subgroup of 
patients aged 18 years and older with a R117H mutation is questionable. Precisely because the latter 
patient population is usually less severe better results would have been expected. On the other hand it is 
acknowledged that there may be less room for showing improvement. However, there are factors (such 
as the poly-T variant, the usually milder phenotype etc. in the case of the R117H-CFTR mutation) that 
make comparisons across these populations complex.      
Clinical studies in special populations 
The results of studies 110 and 112 have been discussed elsewhere in this report; both studies included 
paediatric population. 
Two 68-year-old patients were enrolled in study 110. Both of them were randomised to placebo. One of 
them apparently experienced adverse events of cough, sputum increased and pyrexia that are reported 
as not related and of moderate severity. They were considered as non-serious AEs in study 112. A 
moderate increase in percent predicted FEV1 was seen for both patients after twelve and two weeks of 
treatment with ivacaftor in study 112. Regarding sweat chloride, no change was seen in one of these 
patients while for the other a decrease of 30 mmol/l was seen at week 2 of study 112. Narratives have 
been provided strictly for two patients ≥ 65 years old enrolled in study 110. However, the overall median 
age in study 110 was 32 years while it was 23 years in study 111 (non-G551D gating mutations) and 24 
years in study 102 (G551D-CFTR mutation). The maximum age reported in these studies is 68, 57 and 53

years respectively. As a consequence, a more conservative approach would have been to consider at the 
very least to provide narratives for patients ≥ 60 years old. The MAH is requested to provide the number 
of patients ≥ 55 years old treated with ivacaftor in studies 110, 111 and 102 and the corresponding roll-
over studies. A total of 10 patients ≥55 years of age were treated with ivacaftor, of which 5 subjects 
turned 55 during ivacaftor treatment. In addition, 4 subjects from study 113 were ≥55 years of age 
during either study 113 (a pilot study testing the effect of ivacaftor on lung function in subjects with 
cystic fibrosis and residual CFTR function) or the rollover study 112. As a conclusion the number of 
patients treated with ivacaftor who are at least 55 years old is still limited.      
Supportive study 
Study 112 is an ongoing, open-label, rollover study of orally administered ivacaftor (150 mg q12h) 
designed to evaluate the safety (primary endpoint) and efficacy of long-term (approximately 104 weeks) 
ivacaftor treatment. This study enrolled patients with CF who completed study 110 (patients with an 
R117H-CFTR mutation), study 111 (patients with a non-G551D-CFTR gating mutation), and study 113 
(patients who have phenotypic or molecular evidence of residual CFTR function). Summarized in this 
report are results from a study 112 interim analysis, through the Week 12 Visit, of data from patients 
who were previously enrolled in study 110. Patients from study 111 and study 113 who enrolled in study 
112 were not included in this interim analysis. 
A schematic of the study 112 design is provided in figure below. 
Because patients in study 110 underwent a 3 to 4-week washout during the study 110 Follow-up Period, 
data from study 112 can provide additional information about ivacaftor efficacy in subjects with a R117H-
CFTR mutation, i.e. the purpose of the inclusion of this data in the present submission is to give support 
to the claim of efficacy of ivacaftor in patients aged 18 years and older. In addition, in spite of the fact 
that patients aged 6 to 11 years did not respond to ivacaftor in study 110 they were enrolled in study 
112. Consequently, this study also provides helpful information for them. For study 110 patients who 
enrolled in the ivacaftor arm of study 112, the Safety Follow-up Visit for study 110 was used as the 
Baseline Visit for study 112. In the following, patients from the ivacaftor group in study 110 are referred 
to as patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (i.e., patients who received ivacaftor in study 110 and in 
study 112), and patients from the placebo group in study 110 will be referred to as patients in the 
placebo/ivacaftor group (i.e., patients who received placebo in study 110 and ivacaftor in study 112). 
Of the 69 patients enrolled in study 110, 65 enrolled in the ivacaftor arm of study 112, 2 enrolled in an 
observational arm of study 112 and 2 did not enrol in study 112 due to early discontinuation of treatment 
in study 110. The FAS for this interim analysis includes 65 patients: 30 patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor 
group and 35 patients in the placebo/ivacaftor group. The 2 patients enrolled in the observational arm of 
study 112 were included in the Safety Set but not in the FAS. Of the 65 patients in the FAS, 64 patients 
Assessment report

completed at least 12 weeks of treatment in Study 112. A patient in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group 
discontinued between Week 2 and 12 and three other patients (1 placebo/ivacaftor and 2 
ivacaftor/ivacaftor) discontinued after Week 12. Of these only one patient in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group 
discontinued dosing due to an adverse event of pulmonary exacerbation. Of the 65 patients enrolled in 
the ivacaftor treatment arm of study 112, 49 were ≥ 18 years of age at the start of study 110, 15 were 6 
to 11 years of age, and 1 was 12 to 17 years of age. Baseline mean percent predicted FEV1 was 71.0% in 
the placebo/ivacaftor group and 72.7% in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group, which was comparable to the 
baseline FEV1 in Study 110 (placebo: 70.2%; ivacaftor: 75.7%; overall: 72.9%) because of the 3 to 4-
week wash out at the end of study 110. In study 112, the mean baseline sweat chloride concentration 
was 65.4 mmol/L in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 55.3 mmol/L in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Forty-
nine FAS patients who were ≥ 18 years of age at the start of study 110 enrolled in the ivacaftor arm of 
study 112 (placebo/ivacaftor: 26 patients; ivacaftor/ivacaftor: 23 patients). Baseline mean percent 
predicted FEV1 was 61.9% in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 68.7% in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group, 
which was again comparable to the baseline FEV1 in study 110 (placebo: 62.2%; ivacaftor: 67.0%). In 
study 112, the baseline sweat chloride concentration was 66.0 mmol/L in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 
53.8 mmol/L in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Fifteen FAS patients 6 to 11 years of age at the start of 
study 110 enrolled in study 112 (placebo/ivacaftor: 8 patients; ivacaftor/ivacaftor: 7 subjects). Their 
overall baseline mean percent predicted FEV1 was 92.1% (97.5% in the placebo/ivacaftor group and 
85.8% in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group). Percent predicted FEV1 baseline in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group 
was lower than that of study 110 (97.5%). This difference was likely due to a patient who suffered a 
large decrease in percent predicted FEV1 during study 110 due to a pulmonary exacerbation. This subject 
remained on ivacaftor throughout the pulmonary exacerbation and his FEV1 returned to baseline during 
study 112. In study 112, the baseline sweat chloride concentration was 62.8 mmol/L in the 
placebo/ivacaftor group and 60.4 mmol/L in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. Summary statistics were the 
pre-planned analysis for the overall population, patients aged ≥ 18 years, and patients aged 6 to 11 
years. Following database lock additional analyses were conducted to evaluate the absolute change from 
baseline to Week 12 in percent predicted FEV1 using a one-sample t-test.  
Outcomes 
Full Analysis Set, all patients (n=65) 
Summary statistics show that the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at 
week 12 in the placebo/ivacaftor group was 5.00 percentage points (7.67) and 6.04 percentage points 
(10.42) in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n=27 from the initial number of 30 at baseline). There is a 
discrepancybetween the initial number of patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (30) and those for 
whom spirometry data is available (27) at week 12   that has been addressed by the MAH.  The reasons 
for the lack of data for these 3 patients have been clarified as requested. For the overall population, the 
mean (SD) change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at week 12 was 5.45 percentage points 
(8.91).  
Full Analysis Set, Patients ≥ 18 Years of Age (n=49) 
Summary statistics show that the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at 
week 12 in the placebo/ivacaftor group was 5.47 (7.99) percentage points and 4.73 (6.39) percentage 
points in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group (n=20 from the initial number of 23 at baseline). The MAH should 
clarify this discrepancy in the number of patients in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. The mean (SD) overall 
absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline to Week 12 in study 112 was 5.15 percentage 
points (7.21)

Only 1 patient in this age group was enrolled in the placebo/ivacaftor group,  a 17-year-old White female 
with R117H-5T/W1282X-7T. At study 110 baseline his percent predicted FEV1 and sweat chloride were 
88.67 and 74.75 mmol/l. At study 112 baseline, these figures were as follows: 96.20 and 82 mmol/l, i.e. 
she had experienced an increase of 7.5 and 7.3 mmol/l in percent predicted FEV and sweat chloride 
respectively. At study 112 week 12 his percent predicted FEV1 was 100.59 (above the baseline of study 
110 and study 112). At week 2 his sweat chloride was 44.5 mmol/l, i.e. a large reduction was observed 
with respect to baseline values of studies 110 and 112. 
Full Analysis Set, Patients 6 to 11 Years of Age (n=15) 
Summary statistics show that the mean (SD) absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline at 
week 12 in the placebo/ivacaftor group was 3.58 (7.76) percentage points and 9.78 (10.42) percentage 
points in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group. There was a slight decrease in percent predicted FEV1 in the 
placebo/ivacaftor group at week 2 in study 112. Although the decrease is numerically very small, similar 
phenomenon was observed by the analysis of the youngest subgroup in study 110 that was attributed to 
unlucky pre-treatment trends in study 110. The MAH argues that a dip in percent predicted FEV1 in the 
placebo/ivacaftor group in 6-12 years old is not consistently seen across ivacaftor/ivacaftor or adult 
subgroups or previous studies with ivacaftor. In addition, no safety concern was raised. The 
argumentation, that if a drug-based mechanism was responsible for the dip at week 2, then the effect 
would be expected in both age groups is not completely understood, since the MAH explains the age 
restriction with different clinical effect of ivacaftor across age groups. No further issues are raised given 
the limited magnitude of the drop. The mean (SD) overall absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 
from baseline to Week 12 in study 112 was 6.47 percentage points (13.31).  
In conclusion, the results seen in study 112 in terms of change from baseline at week 12 in percent 
predicted FEV1 in the placebo/ivacaftor group improve the results seen in study 110 in patients receiving 
ivacaftor. This is seen in the age group ≥ 18 years old, particularly in those aged 6 to 11 years old. With a 
single exception, the increase at week 12 in percent predicted FEV1 is higher in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor 
group than in the placebo/ivacaftor group for all subjects and age groups. The results of the post-hoc 
statistical analyses performed show treatment differences between groups in percent predicted FEV1 that 
are statistically significant except for patients in the 6 to 11 year-old group. This is attributed to a single 
patient in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group who had an increase of 49.72 percentage points at week 12 
following resolution of a pulmonary exacerbation.  
However, results of study 112 require detailed discussion of the follow-up period of study 110 in which 
none of the patients received treatment. Summary statistics of the progression of percent predicted FEV1 
and sweat chloride at week 24 and at the end of the follow-up period in study 110 for all patients in the 
FAS as well as for the age subgroups of 6 to 11 years old and ≥ 18 years old have been provided upon 
request. Tables below show this information and also baseline and week 12 data from study 112 for 
percent predicted FEV1 and sweat chloride.

•

The above table shows that in the ivacaftor group baseline values of study 112 are systematically lower 
than values at follow-up of study 110. This leads to an increase in the change from baseline in percent 
predicted FEV1 at week 12 in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group.  
Regarding sweat chloride (see table below), the same applies, i.e. sweat chloride values at follow-up of 
study 110 and at study 112 baseline do not coincide with the highest differences seen in the ivacaftor 
group. The only exception corresponds to the analysis of all FAS patients in which the mean sweat 
chloride at follow-up of study 110 is higher than that at study 112 baseline. The decrease in the mean 
absolute change from baseline after 2 weeks of treatment with ivacaftor in study 112 was of similar 
magnitude in the placebo/ivacaftor and ivacaftor/ivacaftor groups and ranged from a minimum of 14.8 
mmol/l (patients ≥ 18 years old) in the ivacaftor/ivacaftor group to a maximum of 25.4 mmol/l (age

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
This extension of the indication of Kalydeco to patients with cystic fibrosis with an R117H-CFTR mutation 
is based on a single, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study (study 110) of 24 weeks of 
duration. As such, and in line with regulatory guidance, this study is expected to provide a compelling 
evidence of efficacy in the concerned patient population. CF being a rare disease and the allele R117H not 
as frequent as other CFTR mutations such as F508del it is justified that a single study is conducted. In 
Europe, North America, and Australia, approximately 1,600 people with CF aged 6 years and older have 
at least 1 copy of an R117H-CFTR mutation according to the MAH. Study 110 enrolled 70 patients in 
North America and Europe and was terminated prematurely by the sponsor. The MAH justified this with

the limited number of available patients with an R117H allele and CF who would meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, in particular the restrictions imposed by baseline percent predicted FEV1. This is 
reinforced by the fact that out of the 108 patients screened in study 110, 38 could not be randomized  
mainly due to the failure to meet the inclusion criterion related to percent predicted FEV1. 
Of the three main pillars on which the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is based the great are of uncertainty is 
related to the decision on whether the two mutations present are disease-causing. This is particularly the 
case of the R117H mutation that is described as a mutation of variable penetrance. Therefore, it would 
appear that requiring two disease-causing mutations AND a compatible clinical (lung disease) AND 
biochemical (i.e. sweat chloride values well in the range of the disease) phenotype (rather than two 
disease-causing mutations OR a sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L) could have overcome issues related to 
patients/mutations having a normal sweat chloride value at baseline. As the diagnostic criteria of CF used 
in study 110 stipulated that chronic sinopulmonary should be presented no further issues were raised 
except for the charcaterisation of patients with sweat chloride below 60 mmol/L.    
Additional concerns of the CHMP included differences in baseline of study population in terms of severity 
of the lung disease: P aeruginosa lung infection/colonisation at baseline (one of the main phenotypic 
features of CF lung disease) was present in 54.3% of patients on placebo and 44.1% of patients on 
ivacaftor. The mean baseline percent predicted FEV1 in the FAS population was 70.23% in the placebo 
group and 75.70% in the ivacaftor group. In the oldest age group these values are 62.21% and 67.03%. 
Pancreatic insufficiency was also more frequent in the placebo group (28.6% versus 8.8%).  In the 
confirmed plus derived dataset the number of patients on placebo with the poly-T variant 5T is 27 and 21 
on ivacaftor. In the age group ≥ 18 years old these numbers are 21 and 17 respectively. The treatment 
difference in the mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 was not statistically 
significant. However, in a pre-planned subgroup analysis by age, a difference between treatment groups 
was seen, which favoured ivacaftor in the age group ≥ 18 years of age. Data from patients ≥18 years of 
age were considered independently based on the following: 
• 
• 
ivacaftor has been proven to be effective for other CFTR mutations based on its mechanism of 
increasing CFTR channel open probability, 
there is age-based heterogeneity in the Full Analysis Set of patients enrolled in study 110  
•  more patients ≥ 18 years of age were enrolled than the minimum enrolment target set for the 
entire study 
• 
• 
• 
biological plausibility exists for a different treatment response in the age groups 
a consistency of treatment effect is observed across subgroups when limited to subjects ≥ 18 
years of age, and 
the study 110 results were replicated in study 112  
The MAH supplied plausible explanation for the differential results seen in adults and children with an 
R117H mutation. While there is no age dependency on the effect of ivacaftor at the level of the sweat 
gland, the lungs of CF patients are progressively damaged with age. Three types of additional analyses 
have been provided and discussed by the MAH: a forest plot analysis of absolute change in percent 
predicted FEV1 among the subgroups, including P values and the treatment by subgroup interaction as 
requested (refer to the description of the results of study 110), a regression analysis (conducted by FDA) 
and a data-driven tree procedure, labelled as “interaction trees”. Unlike other subgroups, there is a clear 
separation of the point estimates for the age subgroups, and the confidence intervals are non-
overlapping. Furthermore, the age is the most significant predictor of therapeutic effect. The regression 
analysis considered partitions by baseline FEV1 (<70% predicted, 70% to 90% predicted, and >90%) 
and by poly-T variant genotype (5T or 7T). Both factors were correlated with age because subjects 6 to

11 years of age had higher baseline FEV1 and were more likely to have R117H-7T allele. In the 6 to 11 
year-old group, only 8% of the patients have decreased FEV1 and 46% of the patients have no clinical 
symptoms at all. According to published data, the average age when mild form of CF is diagnosed is 11.8 
years. It is noted that there are reports of serious clinical symptoms in younger children, but the Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation registry data provided by the MAH show that clinical symptoms which require medical 
treatment are indeed more common over the age of 18 years. It is acknowledged, however, that numbers 
in the children group are limited and that the results in this group may be partially driven by the fact that 
a high number of children have well-preserved lung function and the 7T variant.  
In addition, patients with the 7T allele are a cause for concern as they represent a separate subgroup. 
The average response is practically zero, hence some patients improved and some patients actually 
deteriorated. Given the extremely small sample size (ivacaftor n= 4, placebo n= 6) it is not possible for 
the CHMP to draw any firm conclusion. Treatment decisions should be made considering all factors in the 
clinical practise. An adequate warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC with a cross-
reference to section 5.1.  
Overall, based on the above information, the CHMP concluded that an indication for adult patients with an 
R117H-CFTR mutation could be approvable. 
In the context of a potential extrapolation from adults to children, the MAH was requested to discuss 
treatment with ivacaftor for patients with lung disease as shown by percent predicted FEV1 equal to or 
less than 90% given the results seen in the adult group of patients included in study 110. This has been 
rejected by the MAH on grounds that lung disease may exist even in the presence of a normal percent 
predicted FEV1 and also because the data set available in study 110 to support defining a percent 
predicted FEV1 cut-off for the R117H mutation is limited. No other proposals were discussed but it is 
recognised that there may be young patients with an R117H mutation for whom treatment with ivacaftor 
could be considered based on clinical findings. These are, for instance, not only percent predicted FEV1, 
but also its trajectory over time, as well as the frequency of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and 
pulmonary infections (such as P. aeruginosa), the period at which a patient is at greater risk of decline in 
lung function (e.g. adolescence) and the presence of additional risk factors such as the 5T variant. This 
was acknowledged and therefore, the CHMP accepted that an indication based on a pre-specified percent 
predicted FEV cut-off was not reasonable.  
The MAH was also requested to discuss the available evidence of benefit in treating adult and paediatric 
patients with an R117H mutation who have well preserved lung function. However, in study 110 almost 
all subjects with higher than 90% percent predicted FEV1 at baseline were children, due to the inclusion 
criteria. The efficacy data are therefore almost the same in the subgroup of patients with >90% percent 
predicted FEV1 baseline as in the subgroup of children: FEV1 and the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R 
data favoured placebo and even the individual results suggest that the true effect of ivacaftor seems zero 
in these subjects. In study 103 (children with a G551D-CFTR mutation), 52 children aged 6 to less than 
12 years old were enrolled to receive placebo or ivacaftor 150 mg BID. Their mean baseline PPFEV1 was 
around 85% (as compared to 94.0 and 97.5 percentage points in the placebo group and ivacaftor groups 
of study 110 respectively). The mean absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 was greater in the 
ivacaftor group (12.58%) than in the placebo group (0.13%) with an estimated treatment difference for 
ivacaftor versus placebo of 12.45 percentage points (95% CI: 6.56, 18.34). In study 111 (patients with 
gating mutations other than G551D) the treatment difference was 9.8 percentage points (14 patients in 
the ivacaftor group and 13 in the placebo group). In contrast, a seemingly deteriorating effect was 
observed in children in study 110 and there are practically no data in adolescents. Beyond central values 
and statistical considerations even individual data suggest that the true effect of ivacaftor may be zero. 
Or rather more precisely, these effects –even if exist- are undetectable by parameters such as 
spirometry, CFQ-R rating scale or measurement of indirect nutritional parameters in such a relatively 
short duration. No new data can be generated for the moment. There is some evidence from case reports 
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020 
Page 44/57 
 
  
  
that children with an R117H-CFTR mutation may be clinically ill but the benefit of ivacaftor has not been 
proven in this age group. Consequently, the indication remains restricted to adult patients.  
A stopping rule based on sweat chloride for patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation was also proposed for 
patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation and not for patients with gating mutations which (as a group) are 
believed to be at an increased risk for more progressive and aggressive lung disease. Furthermore, two 
published papers (Seliger V et al, 2013; Durmowicz A et al, 2013) were discussed at the time of 
assessment of the extension of the indication of Kalydeco to patients with CFTR gating mutations other 
than G551D that show that some patients may respond to ivacaftor in spite of the fact that their sweat 
chloride did not decrease at least 20 mmol/l from baseline.  However, the studies by Selinger and 
Durmowitz are based on limited datasets (patients with G551D-CFTR mutation). The MAH was requested 
to perform a similar analysis of study 110 versus studies 102, 103 and 111. Scatter plots of absolute 
change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 at week 24 (week 8 for study 111) sorted by type of 
mutation (G551D versus R117H) versus absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride at the earliest 
point in time at which it was measured in each of the studies considered were provided for the ivacaftor 
and placebo groups. The graphical inspection of the scatter plots provided show that almost all patients 
with a G551D-CFTR mutation who showed a decrease in sweat chloride of at least 20 mmol/l also showed 
an increase (improvement) in percent predicted FEV1 at week 24. More variability in response was seen 
in patients with non-G551D gating mutations and in patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation.  However, 
no correlation was found for ivacaftor-treated patients with the exception of children with an R117H-CFTR 
mutation (n=5) for whom the correlation coefficient was -0.70. The inspection of the scatter plot of study 
110 shows that sweat chloride values were not sufficiently discriminative at the level of individual patients 
in order to make a decision on whether a particular patient should stop treatment with ivacaftor when 
sweat chloride level has not decreased. This conclusion is based on the database provided that only 
includes patients with sweat chloride and FEV1 values available at the points in time above requested 
(i.e., first available value of sweat chloride and the one of percent predicted FEV1).  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP raised several questions during the assessment of the results of study VX11-770-110. 
However, after the assessment of the responses of the MAH, no issues pertaining to clinical efficacy were 
pending since the MAH adequately responded to all raised issues. The CHMP concluded that the 
benefit/risk ratio in the extended indication of Kalydeco is positive and the new indication is: 
Kalydeco tablets are  indicated for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 6 years and 
older who have one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, 
G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Kalydeco is also indicated for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) aged 18 years and older 
who have an R117H mutation in the CFTR gene (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
A cautionary statement is included in section 4.4 in relation to patients with an R117H7T genotype and a 
cross-reference to section 5.1 was made where results by poly-T status are mentioned (including the 
limitations of such an analysis given the small numbers of patients with a confirmed 7T variant). The 
physicians are advised that less evidence of a positive effect of ivacaftor has been shown for patients with 
an R117H-7T mutation associated with less severe disease. Whenever possible the phase of the poly-T 
variant identified with the R117H mutation should be determined as this may be informative in 
considering treatment of patients with an R117H mutation.

2.4.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The MAH provided 24-week safety data from patients with cystic fibrosis who have an R117H mutation in 
an allele of the CFTR gene exposed to ivacaftor and/or placebo in study 110. Week 12 interim data from 
the long-term (104 weeks) open-label study 112 are also submitted. This study enrolled patients with CF 
who completed study 110, study 111 (patients with a non-G551D-CFTR mutation), and study 113 
(patients who have phenotypic or molecular evidence of residual CFTR function). Only serious adverse 
events from patients from study 110 are addressed. Therefore, the main basis for the safety analysis is 
study 110. 
Patient exposure 
The safety set of study 110 includes 69 patients who have received at least 1 dose of ivacaftor or placebo 
in study 110. Out of these 69 patients, 45 received treatment (21 on ivacaftor, 24 on placebo) for a 
period equal or longer than 24 weeks. The number of patients who received at least 24 weeks of 
treatment is below the expected number of 59 (i.e. 8 patients who could not complete the 24-week 
course of treatment plus the two ivacaftor-treated patients who discontinued prematurely). This 
discrepancy is assumed to be due to patients who missed some of their doses. Of the 69 patients enrolled 
in study 110, 65 enrolled in the ivacaftor arm of study 112 and 2 enrolled in the observational arm of 
study 112.  Two patients did not enrol in study 112 due to early discontinuation of treatment in study 
110. All ongoing patients completed the Week 12 Visit in study 112, with the exception of 1 subject. 
Adverse events 
In study 110, the proportion of patients with adverse events during ivacaftor treatment was 94.1% 
(32/34) versus 100% (35/35) in the placebo group. The System Organ Class (SOC) with the highest 
incidence of adverse events during both treatments was infections and infestations (61.8% of ivacaftor-
treated patients and 68.6% of placebo-treated patients). By Preferred Term, the AEs with the highest 
incidence in both treatment groups were infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF (38.2% [13 patients] in 
the ivacaftor group and 40.0% [14 patients] in the placebo group) and cough (29.4% [10 patients] in the 
ivacaftor group and 25.7% [9 pateints] in the placebo group). Sputum increased was reported by 5 
(14.7%) ivacaftor-treated patients and 4 (11.4%) placebo-treated patients (see table below).

EMA/670896/2020 
Page 46/57 
 
  
  
 
Taking into account the limited sample size it can be questioned that only those adverse events that 
occurred in at least 10% of patients treated with ivacaftor are summarised. In particular those adverse 
events that have been specifically requested to be followed in the PSURs such as hypersensitivity 
reactions, depression and suicide/self-injury, cataracts, haemoptysis and hyperbilirubinaemia are very 
unlikely to be captured with this approach. The MAH responded that the AEs of depression and 
suicide/self-injury, cataracts, and hyperbilirubinemia did not occur in either treatment group in study 110 
while hypersensitivity and haemoptysis occurred only in placebo-treated patients; hence, no update to 
the SmPC was needed. The CHMP made the following observations after assessing the submitted data: 
while abdominal pain was reported for 4 patients in the ivacaftor group and none in the placebo group, 
there were also two additional preferred terms of “abdominal pain upper”, “abdominal discomfort” making 
a total of 8 patients on ivacaftor with these related symptoms versus 2 on placebo. “Abdominal 
tenderness” is an additional related preferred term that was reported by a placebo-treated patient. Within 
the SOC of “Investigations”, the number of Preferred Terms related to results of liver function tests 
include “alanine aminotransferase increased”, “blood bilirubin increased”, “hepatic enzyme increase” and 
“liver function test abnormal”. While it is stated that no patients experienced hyperbilirubinemia in study 
110, the AE data in children include a case of blood bilirubin increased (apparently below 2xULN). Overall, 
this does not change the conclusions about the safety of ivacaftor but is relevant information for the 
Product Information and, consequently, the MAH was requested to recalculate the frequency of these and 
other adverse events that seem to be split in different preferred terms. Consequently, an extensive 
revision of section 4.8 was performed by the MAH, also in line with the SmPC guideline. This is acceptable 
to the CHMP. 
The incidence of patients with AEs considered by the investigator to be related or possibly related to the 
study drug was 8.8% (3 patients) in the ivacaftor group and 20.0% (7 patients) in the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020 
Page 47/57 
 
  
  
 
One (2.9%) patient in the ivacaftor group had an AE of increased C-reactive protein (CRP) that was 
considered by the investigator to be related to the study drug. Regarding the severity of the adverse 
events reported, compared with placebo, ivacaftor was associated with a higher incidence of mild events 
(50.0% during ivacaftor treatment versus 28.6% during placebo treatment) and a lower incidence of 
severe events (2.9% during ivacaftor treatment versus 14.3% during placebo treatment). There were no 
life-threatening adverse events in this study. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in study 110. Four patients (11.8%) treated with ivacaftor and 6 patients (17.1%) 
treated with placebo reported serious adverse events (SAE). The most common SAE in both treatment 
groups was infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF: 3 patients (8.8%) in the ivacaftor group and 6 
patients (17.1%) in the placebo group. SAEs of cellulitis and constipation each occurred in 1 (2.9%) 
patient in the ivacaftor group. None of the SAEs were considered related to the study drug. Patients from 
study 110 who rolled into study 112 reported a total of 12 SAEs. These SAEs were reported by 8 patients 
treated with ivacaftor (there were no SAEs in the observational arm). Of the 12 SAEs, 9 were infective 
pulmonary exacerbations of CF (one of them was considered possibly related to study drug), 1 was 
influenza, and two were angioedema and urticaria. There were no SAEs in the observational arm.  
Laboratory findings 
Results of all Liver Function Tests (LFT) at all-time points were not available for 6 patients in the placebo 
group and 7 patients in the ivacaftor group and hence, the absolute change from baseline to Week 24 in 
LFT could not be determined. The narratives of the 4 patients randomised to ivacaftor who did not 
complete 24 weeks of treatment show that in study 110 none of these patients had laboratory results in 
which alkaline phosphatise was >2 x upper limit of normal (ULN), ALT was >3 x ULN, AST was >3 x ULN, 
or total bilirubin was >2 x ULN. Out of the 13 patients with no LFT values at week 24, two additional 
patients discontinued the study and in the remaining 3 patients (one of them on ivacaftor) LFT 
measurements were not performed at week 24 for unexplained reasons. While the incidence of shifts 
from normal to high LFT values at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 was low (<15% across study visits), and 
there was no clear pattern for an increasing incidence of shifts over time in either treatment group for 
alkaline phosphatase, AST, total bilirubin, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), this is not the case for 
ALT for which 4 patients in the ivacaftor group (versus none  in the placebo group) had a shift from 
normal at baseline to high at week 24. In the ivacaftor group, no patients had a maximum ALT or AST 
that was >5 × ULN. Two patients (5.9%) had at least 1 maximum ALT value >2 x ULN to ≤ 3 x ULN. One 
patient had at least 1 maximum ALT value >3 x ULN to ≤ 5 x ULN; this patient also had at least 1 
maximum AST value >2 x ULN to ≤ 3 x ULN. Figures of liver function tests show that there is an overlap 
of values between both treatment groups for almost all liver function tests. However, the mean change in 
total bilirubin is systematically higher in the ivacaftor group with almost no overlapping between groups. 
The magnitude of the change is limited as shown by a maximum mean change of 5 micromol/L (i.e. 0.3 
mg/dl).  Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the lab abnormalities being followed in the PSURs.  In study 110, no 
subjects had a maximum total bilirubin value >2 × ULN in either treatment group. 
A considerable degree of overlapping exists in the mean change of other chemistry parameters that have 
been plotted over time (e.g., albumin, total protein and creatinine); however, in general, the magnitude 
of the changes is limited. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (sec), Prothrombin Time (sec) and 
Prothrombin Time INR (ratio) were the coagulation parameters determined. There is no hint that ivacaftor 
affects coagulation but the results of the analysis of these parameters in study 110 should be viewed with 
caution due to the fact that a considerable number of samples were affected by an insufficient sample.  
With respect to ECG assessment, no subject had a QTc value greater than 500 msec. Two patients had 
maximum increases into the category of >450 to ≤ 480 msec in QT interval corrected by Bazett’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020 
Page 48/57 
 
  
  
formula (QTcB) in the ivacaftor group. One patient (2.9%) in the placebo group and 4 patients (11.8%) 
in the ivacaftor group had maximum increases of >30 to ≤ 60 msec in QTcB. No patients in the placebo 
group and 2 patients (5.9%) in the ivacaftor group had maximum increases of >30 to ≤ 60 msec in QT 
interval corrected by Fridericia’s formula (QTcF). No patient had a maximum on-treatment increase from 
baseline in QTc interval >60 msec. The CHMP did not raise a concern. 
Safety in special populations 
Analyses of the incidence of adverse events by subgroups in study 110 were discussed by the MAH only 
for those occurring in at least 15% of patients, something that makes their interpretation more difficult. A 
total of 17 patients aged 6 to 11 years (inclusive), 2 patients in the 12 to 17 years (inclusive), and 50 
patients in the ≥ 18 year-old group were included in study 110. In the ≥ 18 year-old subgroup, 26 
patients received treatment with placebo, and 24 patients received treatment with ivacaftor. Among 
patients aged 6 to 11 years, 8 patients received placebo and 9 patients received ivacaftor. Table below 
shows adverse event that occurred in at least 15% of patients sorted out by age group.  
More patients on placebo than on ivacaftor reported adverse events in the ≥ 18 year-old age group, i.e. 
26 (100.0%) patients versus 23 (95.8%) respectively. Adverse events more commonly reported by 
ivacaftor-treated patients (as compared to placebo) were nasal congestion (20.8% on ivacaftor versus 
3.8% on placebo), oropharyngeal pain (16.7% and 0% respectively), and wheezing (16.7% versus 3.8% 
respectively). In the 6 to 11 year-old group all patients in each treatment group reported at least an 
adverse event. Adverse events reported by children were oropharyngeal pain (25.0% on ivacaftor versus 
11.1% on placebo, respectively), nasal congestion (12.5% versus 0% respectively), abdominal pain 
(22.2% versus 0%, respectively) and headache (22.2% versus 12.5% respectively). The incidence of 
infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF in the ≥ 18 years subgroup was 45.8% (11 patients, 14 events) in 
the ivacaftor group and 50.0% (13 patients, 23 events) in the placebo group. The incidence of cough was 
37.5% (9 patients, 12 events) in the ivacaftor group and 26.9% (7 patients, 8 events) in the placebo 
group. None of the subjects in the ≥ 18 years or 6 to 11 years subgroups had haemoptysis.   
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020 
Page 49/57 
 
  
  
 
 
Given that only those adverse events that occurred in at least 15% of patients are discussed, the MAH 
has been requested to provide in tabular format the number and percentage of all adverse events per 
treatment group sorted out by SOC and Preferred Term, which was performed by the MAH. Two patients 
(8.3%) in the ivacaftor group and 6 patients (23.1%) in the placebo group reported at least 1 SAE in the 
≥ 18 years subgroup. The most common SAE in both treatment groups was infective pulmonary 
exacerbation of CF. One patient had a SAE of cellulitis in the ivacaftor group. 
There was 1 pregnancy in study 110, where the patient received her last dose at study Week 16; no 
doses were missed. Based on the subject’s history of premature rupture of membranes, she had a 
cervical cerclage procedure performed at 14 weeks and 2 days of gestation. She was admitted for cervical 
insufficiency at 15 weeks gestation and developed gestational diabetes mellitus at 25 weeks and 5 days. 
The subject delivered a healthy baby at 28 weeks gestation via caesarean section due to premature 
rupture of membranes. The investigator confirmed that cervical insufficiency and gestational diabetes 
were not AEs. 
A total of 13 patients with a baseline percent predicted FEV1% <70% received ivacaftor; in the categories 
of ≥ 70% to ≤ 90% and >90% these numbers were 14 and 7, respectively. These figures for patients 
receiving placebo were 15, 14 and 6, respectively. The incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation of 
CF was similar during both treatments for the three baseline FEV1% predicted categories. However, in 
the category of baseline percent predicted FEV1 <70% the incidence of pulmonary exacerbations was 
higher than in the other two categories, i.e. 8 (53.8%) patients on ivacaftor versus 5 (35.7%) in those 
with ≥ 70% to ≤ 90% and 1 (14.3%) in those with >90%. The incidence of adverse events in the SOC 
“Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders” is higher in the ivacafor group than in the placebo 
group for patients with baseline percent predicted <70%. Six (42.6%) patients on ivacaftor and 5 
(33.3%) on placebo reported cough. Nasal congestion was reported by 1 (6.7%) and 5 (38.5%) patients, 
respectively. Oropharyngeal pain was reported only by 4 (30.8%) ivacaftor-treated patients. Other 
adverse events reported by more ivacaftor-treated patients are wheezing (3 patients vs. 1), upper-airway 
cough syndrome (2 patients vs. none on placebo). No ivacaftor-treated patients reported haemoptysis 
during study 110. However, this adverse event was reported by 6 placebo-treated patients (5 of them in 
the category of percent predicted FEV1<70%).   
The overall incidence of patients with adverse events during ivacaftor treatment was 95.8%, (23 patients, 
119 events) in North America and 90.0% (9 patients, 37 events) in Europe. The overall incidence of 
infective pulmonary exacerbations of CF during ivacaftor treatment was 33.3% (8 patients) in North 
America and 50.0% (5 patients) in Europe. In placebo group, the overall incidence of patients with 
adverse events was 100.0% (30 patients, 173 events) in North America and 100.0% (5 patients, 31 
events) in Europe; the  incidence of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF was 33.3% (10 patients, 13 
events) in North America and 80.0% (4 patients, 11 events) in Europe. The higher incidence of infective 
pulmonary exacerbation of CF, cough, and haemoptysis in Europe in the placebo group was justified by 
the small number of patients in this subgroup and the fact that all 5 patients in the Europe placebo 
subgroup were ≥ 18 years of age. By comparison, the North America placebo subgroup included patients 
6 to 11 years of age (8 patients), 12 to 17 years of age (1 patient), and ≥ 18 years of age (21 patients). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No patients had adverse events that led to study drug interruption during ivacaftor treatment. During 
ivacaftor treatment, 2 patients missed doses of ivacaftor treatment (one case missed 8 doses, one case 
missed one dose) due to AEs of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF. The events were considered by 
the investigator to be not related to the study drug. Two patients in the placebo group had AEs that led to 
study drug interruption. One patient had dehydration, gastroenteritis, and hypokalaemia that were 
considered by the investigator to be not related to the study drug. An additional patient had diarrhoea

and vomiting and missed 14 doses of placebo. The events resolved and were considered by the 
investigator to be possibly related to the study drug. 
Post marketing experience 
Adverse events of special interest that are being monitored in the PSURs are hypersensitivity reactions, 
depression and suicide/self-injury, haemoptysis and hyperbilirubinaemia. Due to the finding of a dose-
related increase in cataracts in juvenile rats in a nonclinical study, an ophthalmologic examination was 
performed at screening for all subjects. A follow-up ophthalmologic examination was also carried out in 
subjects aged 6 to 11 years (inclusive) at Week 24. Minimal changes in visual acuity were observed in 
both treatment groups, and no clinically important trends attributable to ivacaftor treatment were 
detected. No subjects developed lens opacities during study 110. According to the MAH the non-
congenital cases are confounded by the absence of a pre-treatment ophhalmological examination and a 
strong risk factor for development of cataract such as diabetes type I, corticosteroid use or familiar 
history of cataract. However, in one of the cases the patient underwent an eye examination prior to 
initiation of ivacaftor, without mention of cataracts and other of the patients underwent ophthalmological 
examination during treatment with ivacaftor without diagnostic of cataract but a follow–up 
ophthalmological examination several months after identified lens opacity. Therefore, a causal association 
to ivacaftor in these 2 cases could not be excluded. In addition, the progression of these lens 
abnormalities and the impact on vision in the long-term exposure is unknown. Given that lens opacities 
(cataracts) observed in the juvenile rat toxicity study were considered ivacaftor-related, there is a 
plausible causal relationship. This was already addressed by the PRAC and an adequate warning was 
included in the PI of Kalydeco tablets. Cataracts are being followed in the PSURs. At the time of 
assessment of the current procedure the MAH informed CHMP that a report of cataracts had been 
received in a paediatric patient older than 12 years old via PSUR. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH provided 24-week safety data from patients with cystic fibrosis who have an R117H mutation in 
an allele of the CFTR gene exposed to ivacaftor and/or placebo in study 110. The safety set of this study 
includes 69 patients who have received at least 1 dose of ivacaftor or placebo. Week 12 interim data from 
the long-term (104 weeks) open-label study 112 are also submitted. This study enrolled patients with CF 
who completed study 110, study 111 (patients with a non-G551D-CFTR mutation), and study 113 
(patients who have phenotypic or molecular evidence of residual CFTR function). Analysis of the 
occurrence of AEs and SEAs, including events of special interest, laboratory parameters, safety data in 
special populations, etc., did not reveal major inconsistencies with the already known profile of ivacaftor. 
The CHMP requested some re-calculations of originally submitted analyses and these were provided by 
the MAH. The current Product Information of this medicinal product reflects the latest safety profile.  
2.4.7.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
In conclusion, the CHMP was of the opinion that the safety profile of ivacaftor in patients with R117H-
CFTR mutation in study 110 was consistent with the one already known for this medicinal product. Some 
concerns were raised in order to clarify or to provide further safety data related to liver toxicity and 
coagulation parameters among others, but they were not considered critical and have been adequately 
addressed by the MAH during this procedure; the SmPC reflects the most up-to-date safety profile of 
Kalydeco.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Ivacaftor 150 mg administered every 12 hours for 24 weeks has been associated with an improvement in 
the absolute change in percent predicted FEV1 in a subgroup of patients aged 18 years and older with 
cystic fibrosis and an R117H mutation of the CFTR who were enrolled in a 24-week, randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study 110. The mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 
through Week 24 for patients ≥ 18 years of age was greater for the ivacaftor group (4.51 percentage 
points) than the placebo group (-0.46 percentage points). The treatment difference for ivacaftor versus 
placebo was 4.97 percentage points (95% CI: 1.15, 8.78). Percent predicted FEV1 is the recommended 
primary clinical endpoint in efficacy studies for CF given that lung function in CF declines with age and is a 
significant predictor of mortality. This improvement in FEV1 was accompanied by a decrease from 
baseline in sweat chloride (a marker of CFTR activity) and by an increase in the respiratory domain of the 
pooled Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) that was above the minimal clinically important 
difference. Descriptive statistics show that the improvement in percent predicted FEV1 was observed in 
this age group in patients with baseline percent predicted FEV1 equal to or below 90% (a single adult 
patient was enrolled with percent predicted FEV1 >90%). Similarly, the results indicate that the presence 
of the poly-T variant 5T, which is known to affect the phenotypic expression of patients carrying the 
R117H mutation, does not seem to impair the effect of ivacaftor on these patients.   
In the overall population of study 110, the effect on sweat chloride in the ivacaftor arm was consistent 
across all age groups. The mean absolute change from baseline in sweat chloride through Week 24 was -
26.3 mmol/L for the ivacaftor group and -2.3 mmol/L for the placebo group. The treatment difference 
(95%CI) for ivacaftor versus placebo was -24.0 mmol/L (-28.0, -19.9).  
After the last dose of ivacaftor or placebo in study 110 patients were followed for 3 to 4 weeks before 
being enrolled in study 112, a roll-over, ongoing study intended to address the long-term safety and 
efficacy of ivacaftor in patients with a R117H-CFTR mutation (patients with non-G551D gating mutations 
are also being followed in this study). The data provided seem to show that, as a group, during the 
treatment-free follow-up period patients who were on ivacaftor lost their moderate gain in percent 
predicted FEV1 seen during the 24-treatment period of study 110. Similarly, the limited data provided for 
study 112 (12-week interim analysis) show that patients who were randomised to placebo in study 110 
improved their FEV1 when they started to receive ivacaftor in study 112. This was also the case of 
patients who were initially randomised to ivacaftor and enrolled in study 112.     
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Study 110 where ivacaftor 150 mg was administered every 12 hours for 24 weeks did not meet its 
objective, as treatment with ivacaftor was not shown to be statistically different from placebo in a number 
of efficacy variables including change in percent predicted FEV1, change in BMI and time to first 
pulmonary exacerbation. The mean absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 through 
Week 24 for the FAS (all patients) was 2.57 percentage points in the ivacaftor group versus 0.46 
percentage points in the placebo group. The estimated treatment difference (95%CI) for ivacaftor versus 
placebo was 2.11 percentage points (-1.13, 5.35). In a pre-planned subgroup analysis by age, a 
difference between treatment groups favouring ivacaftor in the age group ≥ 18 years was observed. In 
the adult group, although larger mean changes were observed for the mean change in BMI for the 
ivacaftor group (placebo: 0.22 kg/m2; ivacaftor: 0.53 kg/m2), the 95% confidence interval of the 
treatment difference was (-1.90, 2.51).  Similarly, it is not known whether ivacaftor may be efficacious in 
adult patients with a percent predicted FEV1 above 90% since only a single adult patient on ivacaftor was 
Assessment report  
EMA/670896/2020 
Page 54/57 
 
  
  
available for the analysis while in children the effect seem favoured the placebo group. Hence, no 
amendments to the prescriber’s information in this respect can be justified. 
In essence, positive results from a subgroup analysis in the event of a failed primary endpoint in a pivotal 
trial are not sufficient for gaining regulatory approval unless there are exceptional circumstances. The 
draft guidance “EMA/CHMP/539146/2013, Guideline on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory 
clinical trials”, classifies the current situation as “Scenario 3”: “The clinical data presented fail to establish 
statistically persuasive evidence but there is an interest in identifying a subgroup, where a relevant 
treatment effect is evident and there is compelling evidence of a favourable risk-benefit”. This guidance 
defines the minimum requirements that should be met in order to justify “exceptional circumstances”. 
Overall, it is accepted that the results in the adult group have biological plausibility and that further 
analyses performed support the notion of a positive effect of ivacaftor in this group when all other 
evidence is considered.  
The effect of discontinuing prescribed therapies for CF while remaining on ivacaftor treatment has not 
been evaluated. During study 110, patients continued on their prescribed CF therapies. Thus, ivacaftor 
will remain recommended for use in addition to other prescribed therapies for CF.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of ivacaftor in patients with an R117H-CFTR mutation in study 110 was consistent with 
that observed in studies 102, 103 and 111 in patients with gating mutations and no new safety concerns 
emerge from the review of the safety data. The AEs with the highest incidence in both treatment groups 
were infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF and cough. The number of pulmonary exacerbations 
reported for safety purposes is usually higher than the number of protocol-defined pulmonary 
exacerbations analysed for efficacy that should meet stricter criteria. AEs for which the incidence was at 
least 5% higher with ivacaftor treatment than with placebo treatment included nasal congestion, 
oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, wheezing, upper airway cough syndrome, bacterial disease carrier 
and others. All of them were reported previously. In the ivacaftor group, no patients had a maximum ALT 
or AST value that was >5 × ULN. Two patients had at least 1 maximum ALT value >2 x ULN to ≤ 3 x 
ULN. Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the laboratory abnormalities being monitored in the PSURs. AEs 
associated with abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) occurred in 3 (8.6%) subjects in the placebo group 
and 1 (2.9%) subject in the ivacaftor group. Lens opacities, which are of concern in the paediatric 
population, were not reported in study 110. The risks are considered to be in line with previous findings, 
no other significant unfavourable effect could be observed in studies 110 and 112. Overall, the safety 
profile of ivacaftor was well characterised and remains within that observed with the use so far. Adverse 
drug reactions and potential risks are readily identified clinically or with routine laboratory monitoring, 
and are considered adequately managed with appropriate risk-management tools described in the SmPC 
and in the RMP. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
It is likely that the limited number of patients enrolled in study 110 contributed to the difficulty to capture 
the AEs that occur less frequently. The MAH is obliged to monitor and report a number of specific AE in 
the PSURs, which is reassuring. The SmPC reflects the most accurate safety information on ivacaftor and 
is hence considered acceptable to the CHMP. As discussed previously, the newly available data do not 
alter the overall safety profile of Kalydeco.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
CF lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in CF. Patients with CF typically 
experience a progressive loss of lung function, ultimately resulting in respiratory failure. The rate of FEV1 
decline may vary depending on several factors, such as genotype and environmental factors. Correlation 
between the genotype and the lung disease phenotype is particularly weak. The R117H-CFTR mutation is 
considered to have variable penetrance, i.e. it may result in a variable phenotype ranging from normal to 
cystic fibrosis. This phenotypic variability has been mainly attributed to the presence of a polypyrimidine 
(poly-T tract) variant located in another region of the CFTR gene in cis with R117H.    
Although study 110 did not achieve its objective, i.e. ivacaftor 150 mg every 12 hours for 24 weeks was 
not shown to be statistically different from placebo in a number of efficacy variables including change in 
percent predicted FEV1, a difference between treatment groups was seen that favours ivacaftor in the age 
group ≥ 18 years in a pre-planned subgroup analysis by age. As a consequence, the claimed indication 
was restricted to this age group; adults with CF who had an R117H-CFTR mutation. 
While the R117H mutation may cause a disease that is in the less severe spectrum of CF, it may be 
associated with severe disease when compared to a normal population. Overall, it was accepted that the 
results seen in the adult group have biological plausibility and that the further analyses performed 
support the notion of a positive effect of ivacaftor in this age group when all other evidence is considered.  
In summary, based on the above information, the CHMP concluded that an indication for adult patients 
with an R117H-CFTR mutation could be approvable and would bring benefit to the patient with this 
diagnosis. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Cystic fibrosis represents an area with a high-unmet medical need for specific targeted therapies. In 
patients with CF, lung function declines with age and is a significant predictor of mortality. Treatments 
that target the underlying chloride transport defect by restoring the function of the CFTR protein may 
decrease the morbidity and increase the lifespan of individuals with CF. In addition, the opportunity to 
intervene at an earlier stage in the progression of disease may further limit organ damage, reduce the 
morbidity, and prolong life. Although there is evidence of a pharmacodynamic response to ivacaftor in 
patients with an R117H mutation, no statistically significant improvement in percent predicted FEV1 was 
observed with ivacaftor in the overall study population in study 110. However, in the subgroup of patients 
aged 18 years and older an effect of ivacaftor cannot be excluded. In addition, further analyses have 
been performed that support the notion of a positive effect of ivacaftor in patients with clinical 
manifestations of CF, in particular with lung disease, who had an R117H-CFTR mutation. The main 
exception refers to patients with the 7T variant. The apparent lack of efficacy of ivacaftor in this group of 
patients is addressed with appropriate warnings in the SmPC. The safety risks are considered to be in line 
with previous findings, no other significant unfavourable effect could be observed in studies 110 and 112. 
Based on the data and analyses provided in the frame of this procedure, the CHMP considered that the 
benefit-risk ration for ivacaftor remains positive and the indication can be broadened to patients with CF 
aged 18 years and older who have a R117H mutation in the CFTR gene.

the SmPC have been updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to implement minor editorial changes in the annexes and to align the product 
information with the latest QRD template. An updated RMP version 4.9 was agreed as part of this 
procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, labelling, 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Kalydeco is not similar to Bronchitol (mannitol) within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  and  scientific  discussion  on  procedures,  which 
have been finalised before 4 June 2003. For scientific information on procedures after this date please 
refer to module 8B.

Introduction 
Zometa  with  the  active  ingredient  zoledronic  acid  is  a  biphosphonate  intended  for  tumour  induced 
hypercalcaemia.  [the  additional  indication:  prevention  of  skeletal  related  events  in  pateints  with 
advanced  malignacies  involving  bone,  is  examined  in  section  6  of  the  present  EPAR].  Zometa  has 
high binding affinity for divalent cations and accumulates in bone. The drug inhibits bone reabsorption 
by osteoclasts. 
Cancer is one of the most common causes of hypercalcaemia. Tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH) 
is  considered  as  an  emergency  situation  in  clinical  oncology  because  of  the  often-severe  symptoms. 
Dehydration, renal failure, mental confusion, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and ECG abnormalities may 
evolve  rapidly  with  increasing  levels  of  serum  calcium.  TIH  is  seen  in  many  types  of  malignancies 
with or without bone metastases. At least two mechanisms of hypercalcaemia seem to be involved in 
cancer.  The  tumour  cells  may  produce  humoral  factors  that  increase  bone  resorption  and  some 
tumours may cause bone destruction through local osteolytic mechanisms. 
Regardless of the mechanisms the first treatment principle in TIH aims at restoring normal hydration, 
as  these  patients  often  are  severely  dehydrated.  Hydration  consists  of  IV  isotonic  saline  with 
replacement  of  potassium  and  magnesium.  Concomitant  use  of  loop  diuretics  requires  close 
monitoring especially when the extracellular fluid volume is decreased (worsening of dehydration) or 
during  vigorous  hydration  (risk  of  pulmonary  oedema).  A  reduction  in  serum  calcium  will  result  in 
improvement in symptoms and many patients can be discharged from hospital.    
There  is  general  agreement  that  potent  bisphosphonates  (i.e.  pamidronate  and  ibandronate  both 
approved  in  the  EU)  given  intravenously  are  the  calcium-lowering  agents  of  choice  in  severe  TIH. 
These agents have a higher inhibitory effect on bone resorption than on bone mineralisation.  
Thus, a  bisphosphonate such as pamidronate is an appropriate comparator for the evaluation of any 
new  biphosphonate  like  zoledronic  acid.  One  might  argue  that  comparative  studies  are  of  lesser 
importance for efficacy assessment because rapid normalisation of serum calcium is a valid surrogate 
for  clinical  benefit.  Placebo-controlled  studies  are  excluded  for  ethical  reasons.  One  problem  in  the 
comparison of two bisphosphonates is the establishment of dose equipotency. The dosing scheme for 
pamidronate with regard to absolute dose, infusion time, and dosing intervals in relation to serum calcium 
levels has been adjusted several times since marketing. For the clinical development of zoledronic acid 
Novartis  has  selected  the  highest  recommended  single  dose  of  pamidronate  (90  mg  as  an  2-hour  i.v. 
infusion) as comparator versus two different dose levels for zoledronic acid.

Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Composition 
Zometa is a lyophilisate presented as a powder for solution for infusion. The container is a clear, 
uncoloured glass vial (class I, Ph. Eur) with a butyl rubber stopper. A 4% overage is filled to the vials 
to permit withdrawal of the labelled amount from the vials. An ampoule with 5 ml water for injection 
is included for each vial of lyophilisate. Prior to administration the lyophilisate is reconstituted with 
water for injections and further diluted with infusion media (0.9% w/v sodium chloride or 5% w/v 
glucose solution for infusion. 
Zometa is also presented as a concetrate for solution for infusion, in 5 ml transparent plastic vials with 
a rubber stopper. Each vial contains 4.264 mg of zoledronic acid monohydrate as the active ingredient, 
equivalent to 4 mg of anhydrous zoledronic acid.

Active substance 
The  active  substance,  zoledronic  acid,  is  synthesised  in  a  multistep  process  using  well-established 
chemical reactions. 
Specifications on all starting materials, solvents and reagents and of intermediates are provided and are 
acceptable.  
Elemental analysis, UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, MS, X-ray Powder Diffraction and X-ray structure 
analysis have proved the structure. 
Related  substances  and  a  number  of  inorganic  impurities  formed  during  the  synthesis  have  been 
identified. The impurity limits in the specifications are qualified by the toxicology studies. 
Batch analysis results from production size batches (9 at Novartis Basel Pharma AG and 3 at the defined 
site  for  commercial  production  Novartis  Stein  Pharma  AG,  Switzerland)  are  presented.  Data  comply 
with specifications. 
The stability data support a retest period of 36 months at up to 30°C, for the substance stored in double 
PE bags in metallic barrels.  
Other ingredients 
The excipients used in both formulations are commonly used in parenteral formulations and comply 
with  PhEur.  and  are  routinely  tested  for  bacterial  endotoxins  (PhEur).  The  choice  of  excipients 
including the amounts used and specifications of these are justified. 
Product development and finished product 
- 
Zometa powder for solution for infusion 
The qualitative composition has not changed during development and clinical trials. In phase I and II 
studies 0.1 mg, 1 mg and 4 mg dosage strengths of zoledronic acid have been used. Different relative 
amounts  of  excipients  were  used  for  each  of  these  strengths,  although  these  differences  are  not 
expected to have significant impact on efficacy or safety of the product intended for marketing. 
The  formulation  is  for  parenteral  use  as  the  active  substance  is  poorly  absorbed  after  peroral 
administration.  
Due  to  incompatibility  of  the  bulk  solution  with  pharmaceutical  glass  of  hydrolytic  class  I,  no  heat 
sterilisation  in  the  final  container  can  be  performed.  Therefore  the  sterilisation  method  chosen  is  an 
aseptic process with sterile filtration before lyophilisation. 
Zometa  4  mg  powder  for  solution  for  infusion  is  manufactured  by  a  standard  aseptic  procedure. 
Excipients and zoledronic acid are dissolved in water for injection. The solution is pre-filtered, sterile 
filtered and filled into washed, sterilised, depyrogenised glass vials. The vials are pre-stoppered with 
washed,  sterilised  butyl  rubber  stoppers.  Afterwards  they  are  freeze-dried  in  a  lyophilyser  under 
controlled  conditions.  After  lyophilysation  the  vials  are  closed  and  sealed  with  aluminium  flip-off 
caps. 
The product is manufactured in a facility that holds the necessary Manufacturing Authorisation. 
The control tests and specifications for the finished product are adequately drawn up and considered to 
be relevant for a product of this type. The impurity limits in the product specifications are justified by 
toxicology studies. 
Specifications for sterility and bacterial endotoxins for the finished product are included in the release 
and shelf life specifications and conform to the requirements of PhEur.

Zometa concetrate for solution for infusion 
The  liquid  formulation  in  the  plastic  vial  is  of  the  same  composition  as  the  already  licensed 
pharmaceutical  form  in  glass  vials  after  reconstitution  with  5  ml  water  for  injections,  thus  no 
additional clinical trials have been performed. 
During  development,  the  compatibility  of  the  bulk  solution  with  the  filters  and  tubing  material  has 
been  studied  and  has  been  found  satisfactory.  Chemical  and  physical  stability during  sterilisation  of 
the concentrate for solution for infusion has also been found to be satisfactory. The compatibility of 
the finished  product with  the packaging  material has  been demonstrated  by stability studies. For the 
compatibility of the preparation with infusion  media (5% glucose solution and 0.9% saline solution) 
and different infusion devices the Marketing Authorisation Holder refered to studies performed with 
the  already  aproved  pharmaceutical  form  (powder  for  solution  for  infusion),  which,  after 
reconstitution with 5 ml water for injections, had the same composition/concentration.  
As  part  of  the  container/closure  integrity  test  a  microbiological  challenge  test  with  the  primary 
packaging  materials  was  performed.  Results  from  storage  in  upright  and  inverted  position  show  no 
evidence of growth.  
The  manufacturing  method  of  the  finished  product  consists  of  the  following  process  steps.  In  the 
beginning  the  excipients  are  dissolved,  under  stirring,  in  water  for  injections.  Then  the  active 
substance  is  added  and  dissolved.  After  final  weight  adjustment  the  bulk  solution  is  filtered  before 
filling into plastic vials. The closed vials are subsequently steam sterilised.  
Validation has been carried out on 3 production scale batches. All batches met the acceptance criteria 
for  the  release  of  the  final  product  and  all  pre-defined  quality  and  performance  specifications 
established in the approved validation protocol was met. 
Specifications  for  sterility,  bacterial  endotoxins,  pH,  particulate  matters  and  visible  foreign  particles 
are  included  in  the  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  for  the  finished  product  and  conform  to  the 
requirements of Ph.Eur. 
Stability of the product 
- 
Zometa powder for solution for infusion 
The applicant has provided results from production batches, which have been stored according to ICH 
requirements in the packaging applied for.  
No changes are seen for any of the tested parameters at any of the tested conditions, except for a minor 
increase in a leachable at 40°C/75%RH. The finished product is very stable.  
Miscibility with physiologic saline and glucose: 
Zometa  was  reconstituted  with  5  ml  water  for  injection  and  further  diluted  to  20ml  and  50ml  with 
0.9% w/v NaCl solution or 5% w/vglucose solution. After storage at 2-8°C in 24 hours the solutions 
were in all cases clear.  
Compatibility with infusion devises: 
Zometa in 50ml 0.9% NaCl solution or 5% glucose solution stored for 24 hours at 2-8°C was found 
compatible  with  devices  made  from  PVC,  PE,  PP  or  glass.  No  decrease  in  active  ingredient  was 
observed. 
Stability of reconstituted solution: 
Reconstituted vials stored upright or upside down at room temperature over 24 hours, show no change 
in the tested quality parameters. 
A  shelf  life  of  36  months  is  acceptable.  There  is  no  special  storage  condition  specified.  The 
reconstituted  solution  is  chemically  and  physically  stable  for  24  hours  at  room  temperature.  From  a 
microbiological  point  of  view  the  product  should  be  used  immediately  after  further  dilution,  of  the 
reconstituted solution, with 50 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution for infusion or 5% glucose solution 
for  infusion.  If  not  used  immediately,  in-use  storage  times  and  conditions  prior  to  use  are  the 
responsibility of the user. The total time between reconstitution, dilution, and storage in refrigerator at 
2-8°C and end of administration must not exceed 24 hours.

Solvent 
Sterilised water for injection Ph. Eur. is used as a solvent. It is manufactured by Nycomed GmbH, St.-
Peter Strasse 25, A-4010 Linz, Austria. It is produced from water for injection in bulk which is sterile 
filtered, filled into sterilised and depyrogenized ampoules and sterilised by autoclaving at 121°C for 15 
min.  
The  final  product  is  tested  for  sterility  by  the  membrane  filtration  method  according  to  PhEur  and 
validated according to the requirements therein. 
The glass ampoules used (packaging) consist of 5 ml colourless borosilicate glass (type 1, PhEur).  
Results on production batches comply with the specification. Stability is satisfactory. 
Zometa concetrate for solution for infusion 
- 
Three  pilot  batches  have  been  stored  at  25°C/60%RH  and  30°C/70%RH  for  18  months  and  at 
40°C/75%  RH  for  6  months  in  the  packaging  applied  for.  In  addition  to  the  conditions  mentioned 
above,  results  at  some  time  points  are  available  for  the  following  conditions:  -20°C,  5°C,  50°C  and 
50°C/75%RH. As suggested by the stability results obtained with all batches, the proposed shelf life 
for  the  unopened  commercially  packaged  product  under  the  conditions  specified  in  the  SPC,  is 
acceptable, as no changes were seen at neither long term nor accelerated conditions. 
Furthermore  special  studies  have  been  performed  testing  the  photostability  and  the  freeze  and  thaw 
cycle  test  stability  of  the  finished  product  as  well  as  the  presence  of  extractables.  There  were  no 
changes observed for any of the tested parameters at any of the tested conditions.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Zometa  is  manufactured  using  a  conventional,  aseptic  manufacturing  process.  The  chemical-
pharmaceutical  dossier  is  well  documented  and  guarantees  the  quality  of  the  active  substance  and 
finished product, both initially and throughout the shelf life. The proposed specifications are suitable. 
A number of quality points were not resolved at the time of the CPMP opinion. However, these were 
considered to be minor, without any impact on the efficacy or safety of the product, and are indicated 
to be addressed post-approval.

Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
In vitro studies  
Cultures of murine calvarial bones, stimulated with a variety of naturally occurring agents, have been 
employed to demonstrate the efficacy of zoledronic acid in inhibiting calcium release; the effect was 
100  times  that  of  pamidronate.  The  potency  of  the  inhibition  of  calcium  release  and  calcium 
incorporation in murine calvarial cultures was compared with reference compounds. Zoledronic acid 
had the highest ratio for IC50 (calcium release)/IC50 (calcium incorporation) which indicates a potential 
for inhibition of bone resorption without affecting bone mineralisation.   
Zoledronic  acid  was  toxic  in  vitro  (induced  DNA  fragmentation  and  apoptosis)  in  human  myeloma 
cell lines, human epithelial carcinoma cell line and human breast cancer cell lines and it exhibited anti-
angiogenic effects in vitro and in vivo. 
In vivo studies  
Two models have been used, inhibition of hypercalcaemia in thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rats and 
inhibition of bone loss in ovariectomised (OVX) rats.  
1,25(OH)  2vitaminD3 induces hypercalcaemia in TPTX rats. Zoledronic acid dose-dependently inhibited the 
acute hypercalcaemia, achieving normalisation of serum calcium in all animals studied at a dose of 1.5 
µg/kg/day  s.c.  for  4  days.  In  this  system  zoledronic  acid  was  about  850  times  more  active  than 
pamidronate. 
4/33 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The effects of zoledronic acid in OVX rats were investigated in both short-term (3 weeks) and long-term 
studies (12 months). The OVX-induced bone loss could be completely prevented by zoledronic acid given 
both daily or intermittently. Similar findings were reported in OVX rhesus monkeys (16-month study). 
Furthermore, zoledronic acid inhibited the systemic osteopenia in rats and rabbits with experimental 
inflammatory arthritis. In general, zoledronic acid increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyses of 
long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses (e.g. up to 0.01 mg zoledronic acid/kg/day given to 
rats  for  12  months)  and  a  significant  increase  in  density,  and  improvement  of  the  mechanical 
properties of trabecular bone, after i.v. treatment of dogs for 6 months, particularly at 0.03 mg/kg.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed. 
General and safety pharmacology programme 
Zoledronic acid has no CNS effects in mice at doses of up to 10-mg/kg i.v. In isolated guinea pig atria 
and  ileum,  only  minor  effects  were  observed  at  the  highest  concentration  tested  (246  µM).  No 
cardiovascular effects were observed in anestesthetized cats at doses up to 3-mg/kg i.v. (30 mg/kg was 
lethal).  In  conscious  rats  zoledronic  acid  (1  mg/kg)  had  no  significant  effect  on  urinary  volume  or 
electrolyte secretion. Higher intravenous doses (1.5-50 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased the serum 
urea concentration in rats. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Disposition studies were performed with radiolabelled zoledronic acid. Concentrations in plasma and 
urine were analysed by a radioimmunoassay with  the limit of quantification  being 0.4 ng/ml and 10 
ng/ml  for  plasma  and  urine  determinations.  A  HPLC  method  was  developed  to  separate  zoledronic 
acid from potential metabolites in the urine of rats. Most studies were performed in rats and dogs. 
In  both  rats  and  dogs  radiolabelled  i.v.  Zoledronic  acid  (0.15  mg/kg)  was  cleared  rapidly  in  a 
multiexponential  manner  from  blood  and  plasma.  Very  low  residual  levels  (about  0.1%  of  the 
concentration  5  minutes  post-dose)  persisted  in  blood  and  plasma  for  several  days.  This  pattern  is 
similar to the PK data obtained from patients. The studies suggest linear pharmacokinetics. 
The  radioactivity  in  plasma  represented  predominantly  if  not  exclusively  parent  zoledronic  acid.  In 
rats zoledronic acid was almost completely bioavailable after s.c. administration. 
The binding to plasma proteins shows species differences, 96% in rats, 22% in humans and only 9% in 
dogs. In growing rats 60% of a dose of 0.1 mg/kg was retained in the skeleton. The apparent half-life 
in  the  whole  skeleton  appeared  to  be  longer  than  360  days.  This  finding  is  similar  to  data  for  other 
bisphosphonates.  
Except  for  the  kidney,  where  a  low  temporary  retention  of  zoledronic  acid  has  been  observed,  no  
tissues other than bones seems to accumulate the drug. 
Zoledronic  acid  not  retained  in  the  skeleton  is  mainly  excreted  via  the  kidney.  About  30%  of  the 
administered dose is excreted within the first 24 hours. No evidence of metabolites was found in the 
urine of rats. 
No data are available  on the distribution of zoledronic acid in pregnant animals. However, it can be 
expected that the compound will cross the placental barrier and be taken up into foetal bones. 
Plasma  concentrations  were  measured  at  different  times  in  the  toxicology  studies.  These  results  are 
used to compare the systemic exposure in animals and humans. The upper anticipated human dose is 8 
mg as a single i.v. infusion. The safety margins for AUC are about 16 (2 week rat study at dose of 0.6 
mg/kg every third day) to 25 (3 month dog study at doses o.1-0.2 mg/kg once daily). 
Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In acute parenteral studies in mice, rats and dogs, the compound produced marked toxicity already at 
doses  of  6  mg/kg  and  above.  In  rats  a  single  i.v.  dose  of  1.6  mg/kg  was  well-tolerated  with  no 
mortality,  the  only  clinical  sign  being  local  irritation  at  the  injection  site.  At  higher  doses  death 
5/33 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
occurred  most  likely  due  to  cardiac  arrest  (calcium  sequestration  by  zoledronic  acid)  or  in  case  of 
delayed mortality, deaths due to renal effects. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeated dose toxicity studies were performed with duration of treatment from 10 days to 52 weeks in 
mice, rats and dogs. Parenteral administration is most relevant to the therapeutic indication, but data 
following  oral  and  subcutaneous  administration  has  also  been  submitted.  The  most  frequent  finding 
consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyses of the long bones in growing animals at 
nearly all doses. This effect is in line with the compound’s pharmacodynamic antiresorptive activity.  
Zoledronic acid induced renal tubular necrosis with elevated BUN and creatinine values in both rats 
and dogs. The NOAEL (mg/kg) for this effect were 1.6 mg/kg (rat, single i.v. dose), 0.6 mg/kg every 
third day for 6 doses (rats), 2 mg/kg (dog single dose), 1 mg/kg/day for 10 days (dog), 0.2 mg/kg daily 
for  1  month  (dog),  0.01  mg/kg  daily  for  3  months  (dog)  and  0.005  mg/kg  alternating  days  for  16 
weeks, every third day through week 52 (dog). 
As can be seen from these results, zoledronic acid can cause renal toxicity. The animal data suggest 
that the renal safety margins narrow with long-term exposure and the compound should only be given 
to humans as single doses. 
High  doses  (specify  dose)  can  cause  hepatic  injury  with  elevation  of  ALAT  and  ASAT,  and 
degeneration, inflammation and necrosis of liver cells in individual cases, inflammation, haemorrhage 
and erosions of the gastrointestinal tract, severe local skin reactions at injection sites.  
Both the renal and hepatic effects have been observed with other biphosphonates in preclinical studies. 
As  expected  the  most  common  changes  in  clinical  chemistry  consist  of  hypocalcaemia,  other 
electrolyte imbalances, decreased bone alkaline phosphatase levels. 
Genotoxicity  
Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the standard genotoxicity battery. 
Carcinogenicity 
Oral carcinogenicity studies with duration of 104 weeks have been performed in mice and rats. 
Except for an increase in Harderian gland adenoma/adenocarcinoma in male mice (0.1-1 mg/kg) and 
female mice (>3 mg/kg) no sign of carcinogenicity was observed. These findings were not considered 
of relevance for the human situation. 
Reproduction Toxicity  
Teratology and fertility studies have been performed with doses up to 0.1 mg/kg. 
Many  treated  female  rats  and  rabbits  died  or  were  sacrificed  while  moribund  at  parturition  due  to 
difficulty in delivery (dystocia). 
In the teratology study conducted zoledronic acid caused skeletal malformations and dose-related poor 
skeletal ossifications in rats at doses over 0.2 mg/kg.  
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies were carried out in rabbits and guinea pigs with treatment duration of 5 to 25 
days.  Zoledronic  acid  was  shown  to  be  intravenously  irritating  and  to  induce  dermal  irritation  after 
repeated administration. 
Environmental Risk Assessment 
An  assessment  of  the  environmental  risk  was  performed  and  no  significant  risk  to  the  environment 
related to the use of zoledronic acid is anticipated. 
Impurities/Metabolites  
Two  major  by-products  were  identified  in  the  batches  used  in  toxicology  and  clinical  studies.  Their 
presence was not considered toxicologically important.

Discussion on toxico-pharmacological aspects 
The  antiresorptive  effects  on  osteoclasts  have  been  documented.  In  comparative  pharmacodynamic 
studies zoledronic acid has a considerably higher potency than pamidronate, the currently most used 
bisphosphonate  for  the  treatment  of  TIH.  The  thyro-parathyroidectomised  rat  model  and  the 
ovariectomised  rat  model  have  been  used  in  most  studies.  No  animal  models  of  TIH  have  been 
included. In response to the List of Questions, which queried the lack of studies in animal models of 
TIH, the applicant argued that it had been demonstrated that zoledronic acid inhibits osteoclastic bone 
resorption.  This  effect  can  be  translated  into  a  lowering  of  serum  calcium  in  animals  with 
experimental hypercalcaemia and increased osteoclastic activity regardless of underlying disease plays 
a  major  role  in  the  development  of  hypercalcaemia.  Data  from  the  new  murine  model  that  were 
presented in  abstract form in response to the List  of  Questions  support that zoledronic  acid potently 
inhibits osteolysis induced by bone metastases, although the direct effects on hypercalcaemia have not 
been investigated in neoplastic animal models. However, it is still regrettable that the specific situation 
of tumour invasion was not studied. This is only justified because there are sufficient clinical data to 
support the indication TIH. 
Zoledronic  acid  produced  toxicological  effects  in  the  kidney,  liver,  osseous  skeleton,  and 
gastrointestinal tract and is a local irritant. The renal NOAEL in rat and dog studies compared with the 
highest intended human dose of 8 mg varied within narrow limits (between 8 and 1 times the human 
dose). At higher i.v. doses the toxic effects included inflammation, haemorrhage and erosions in the 
gastrointestinal  tract;  hepatocellular  necrosis,  haemorrhage  and  inflammation;  severe  local  skin 
inflammation  at  the  injection  site.  In  both  species  studied  zoledronic  acid  caused  expected  dose-
dependent alterations in bones with increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in 
growing animals and a signficant increase in density and improvement of the mechanical properties of 
trabecular  bone  after  i.v.  treatment  of  dogs  for  6  months.  Hypocalcaemia  and  hypomagnesiaemia 
combined with lowered bone alkaline phosphatase were the most prominent laboratory findings. 
The total systemic exposure to the highest dose in rats and in dogs was respectively about 1-8 and 6-
28 times the highest expected human exposure (8 mg). 
Zoledronic  acid  causes  foetal  skeleton  malformations.  Like  other  bisphosphonates,  zoledronic  acid 
should not be used in pregnant women. This is reflected in the SPC. 
Zoledronic acid is not mutagenic or carcinogenic. 
4. 
Clinical aspects 
Clinical pharmacology 
Zoledronic acid is being evaluated mainly in oncology indications, namely treatment of TIH, and 
treatment of bone metastases. Two studies of Paget’s disease of bone are also included for the 
evaluation of pharmacodynamic properties of zoledronic acid. The studies were conducted in 
compliance with GCP. Studies in healthy volunteers have not been performed.  
Overview of trials presenting pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic data is given in the table

As  Zometa  inhibits  osteoclastic  bone  resorption  by  binding  to  calcified  bone  matrix,  its 
pharmacodynamic  effects  were  evaluated  by  investigating  how  it  affected  biochemical  markers  of 
bone  resorption,  such  as  serum  or  plasma  (albumin  corrected)  calcium,  bone  specific  alkaline 
phosphatase, PTH, and PTHrP. 
In  TIH  patients  urine  N-telopeptide  (NTX)/creatinine  ratio,  urine  calcium/  creatinine  ratio, 
urine(deoxy)pyridinoline/  creatinine  ratio,  and  urine  hydroxyproline/  creatinine  ratio  all  decreased 
significantly  from  baseline  after  a  single  infusion  of  zoledronic  acid,  consistent  with  the  drug’s 
inhibitory effects on bone resorption. Serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase tended to increase but 
the  changes  were  not  significant  for  this  marker  of  bone  formation.  The  differences  were  not  dose-
dependent.

Pharmacokinetics 
All known  bisphosphonates  are  characterised  by a very low bioavailability after oral  administration. 
For the treatment of TIH, only bisphosphonates formulated for i.v. use are of interest. There is a rapid 
disappearance  of  drug  from  the  systemic  circulation  after  i.v.  administration  reflecting  binding  to 
mineralised bone and renal excretion. This is followed by very low concentrations of zoledronic acid 
representing small amounts of drug being released from bones over weeks to months and eliminated 
almost  exclusively  by the  kidney.  A  more  complete  evaluation  of  the  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  would 
therefore require quantitative urine sampling over several weeks. PK studies in patients with TIH were 
not performed due to the anticipated difficulties in completing the required sampling schedule in this 
population. Zoledronic acid pharmacokinetics were studied in patients with bone metastases without 
TIH. 
Zoledronic  acid  was  determined  in  plasma  and  urine  using  a  specific  radioimmunoassay  with  the 
lower  limits  of  quantification  being  0.4  ng/ml  and  10  ng/ml  for  plasma  and  urine  determinations, 
respectively. 
Two  studies  have  been  submitted,  study  J001  conducted  in  Japan  (9  patients)  and  study  0503 
conducted in  the USA (23  patients). Pooled data from  these studies with a total  of  32  patients  were 
analysed using a validated, population pharmacokinetic approach.  
Maximal plasma concentrations of zoledronic acid were observed immediately post-end infusion. The 
concentration versus time curves showed a rapid decline followed by phases of slower decline. Low 
plasma  concentrations  of  zoledronic  acid  were  found  up  to  29  days  post  dose,  indicating  prolonged 
disposition from a storage compartment, presumably bone. 
In  the  pooled  evaluation  of  plasma  concentration  versus  time  data,  a  three-compartment  model  was 
chosen  for  the  final  fitting  of  the  data.  The  half-lives  for  the  triphasic  decline  of  the  plasma 
concentrations 0.23 hours, 1.75 hours and 167 hours reflect the high k (into bone)/k (out of bone) ratio 
of 48+ 20 and a much larger volume of distribution of the bone compartment, of 381 l to the combined 
volumes of the central and non-osseous peripheral compartments, of about 15 l. 
Zoledronic acid plasma concentrations in both studies are consistent with dose proportionality. 
Pharmacokinetic data indicate that AUC and Cmax increased proportionally with increasing doses of 
zoledronic acid. In the Japanese J001 trial, there were no dose-dependent differences in the results of 
bone  metabolism  marker  studies,  which  were  used  as  the  major  efficacy  parameters.  In  the  US  trial 
503  there  is  indication  that  the  amount  of  zoledronic  acid  retained  in  the  body  at  24  hours  post 
infusion  correlates  to  changes  in  some  bone  markers  (creatinine  adjusted  calcium  and  bone  alkaline 
phosphatase). The more zoledronic acid retained in the body, the lower the urinary calcium excretion, 
and the higher the serum bone alkaline phosphatase level. 
Plasma-clearance  seemed  to  be  almost  independent  of  dose  (2-16  mg)  and  infusion  time  (5  vs  15 
minutes).  The  clearance  of  drug  is  unaffected  by  patient’s  age  (range  studied  of  45-80  years).  The 
plasma clearance is proportional to creatinine clearance.  
Plasma protein binding is low, about 22%. 
Biotransformation of zoledronic acid in animals and human is negligible.  
Both  studies  used  quantitative  urine  sampling  0-24  h  (503)  and  0-48  h  (J001)  post  dose.  Study  503 
also included spot urine days 8, 15, 29 post dose. The urinary excretion of zoledronic acid was rapid 
over  the  first  6  hours  which  parallels  the  rapid  decline  in  plasma  concentrations.  The  percentage  of 
drug excreted was not affected by dose or infusion rate. 
Gender had no effect on total plasma clearance. 
Based  on  data  from  16  Caucasians,  7  black  Americans  and  9  Japanese  there  is  no  effect  on  total 
plasma clearance by race. 
Interaction studies 
No  targeted  studies  have  been  performed.  The  low  serum  protein  binding  (22%),  the  lack  of 
biotransformation, and the very low potential of reversible or irreversible inhibition of major human 
P450  enzymes  in  liver  microsomes  (CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6, 
9/33 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
CYP2E1,  CYP3A4/5  or  CYP4A9/11)  of  zoledronic  acid  are  all  factors  that  justify  the  absence  of 
formal drug-drug interaction studies. 
Like  other  bisphosphonates,  zoledronic  acid  should  not  be  mixed  with  calcium-containing  i.v. 
infusions because of its propensity to form insoluble calcium complexes. This is reflected in the SPC 
section 6.6. 
Concomitant  administration  of  anticancer  agents,  diuretics,  antibiotics  and  analgesics  in  the  clinical 
trials did not indicate the occurrence of drug-drug interactions. The SPC (section 4.5) cautions the co-
administration  with  aminoglycosides,  since  both  agents  may  have  an  additive  effect,  resulting  in  a 
lower serum calcium level for longer periods than required. 
Special populations 
In the US study 503 the mean age was 58 years (range 45 to 80 years). The results indicate that age 
has no effect on total plasma clearance of zoledronic acid. 
Data  in  severe  renal  impairment  are  not  available.  In  the  32  pharmacokinetic  patients  creatinine 
clearance  ranged  from  25  to  144  ml/min.  As  expected,  the  renal  clearance  of  zoledronic  acid  was 
proportional  to  the  creatinine  clearance.  The  individual  creatinine  clearance  is  probably  the  most 
important covariate for total plasma clearance of zoledronic acid. Since zoledronic acid is exclusively 
administered  as  single  dose  infusions  and  at  least  one  week  should  elapse  before  retreatment  is 
considered, there are no recommendations for dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment. 
Zoledronic  acid  is  not  metabolised  and  the  liver  plays  no  role  in  the  overall  clearance  of  the  drug. 
Studies in liver insufficiency have, therefore, not been conducted.

The  primary end-point  was  to  determine  with  a  dose  escalation  schedule  (giving  a  single  30-minute 
infusion to each patient) two non-toxic dose levels, each able to induce normocalcaemia in 4 or 5 out 
of 5 patients with TIH.

The  doses  tested  were  established  from  toxicological  studies  in  animals  using  zoledronic  acid,  and 
extrapolation to experience with pamidronate.  
Overall, 37 patients were included. Four did not actually receive the drugs, three other were excluded 
because not eligible (1) or for early deaths (2), leaving 30 evaluable cases.

Other secondary endpoints (days of normalization and duration of action) described the rapidity and 
duration of drug action. The day of normalisation of the corrected serum calcium was day 2 or day 3 
for most patients. The duration of action (i.e., time until hypercalcaemic relapse, computed from the 
day when the patients achieved normocalcaemia), is not a valid criterion because of the small number 
of  patients  recruited  and  as  most  patients  were  actually  not  evaluable:  eight  patients  died,  two  were 
lost or non-compliant. In addition, at the effective doses (0.002 and 0.04 mg/kg) only one patient per 
level actually relapsed (the duration of drug action was, respectively, 17 and 16 days).  
Main studies (036, 037)  
Both  pivotal  studies  in  patients  with  TIH  (any  cancer  and  corrected  serum  calcium  (CSC)  >  3.00 
mmol/l) have been submitted. Both used a randomised double blind, double-dummy design comparing 
4 mg or 8 mg zoledronic acid (5 minute i.v. infusion) with pamidronate 90 mg (2 hour infusion). The 
dummy  consisted  of  equal  amount  of  0.9%  NaCl  (50  ml/5  min  for  patients  randomised  to 
pamidronate; 250 ml/2 hours for patients randomised to zoledronic acid). The pamidronate dose is the 
highest recommended in the current approved SPC. Both treatment arms included i.v. hydration with a 
third infusion of 250 ml saline after active drug + dummy infusion. Both studies comprised two stages. 
In  stage  I  patients  were  randomised  to  initial  treatment  of  TIH  with  zoledronic  acid  (4  or  8  mg),  or 
pamidronate. In stage II, patients with refractory or relapsed TIH could be retreated with open-label 8 
mg zoledronic acid. 
In both studies only patients with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer and a 
corrected  serum  Calcium  (CSC)  level  >  3.00  mmol/l  (12.0  mg/dl)  were  included.  Patients  with 
previous  bisphosphonate  therapy  for  hypercalcaemia  within  last  90  days  or  for  other  reasons  within 
last  30  days, treatment  with  calcitonin,  mithramycin  or  gallium  nitrate  within  last  72  hours,  7  or  14 
days  respectively,  change  in  antineoplastic  chemotherapy  or  hormonal  therapy  within  last  7  days, 
serum  creatinine  >  400  µmol/l  (4.5  mg/dl)  or  hyperparathyroidism,  vitamin  D  intoxication,  ”milk 
alkali  syndrome”,  sarcoidosis  or  granulomatous  disease,  adrenal  insufficiency,  multiple  endocrine 
neoplasia syndromes were excluded from the studies. 
The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  the  incidence  of  complete  response  (CR)  defined  as  corrected 
serum  calcium  <  2.70  mmol/l  (10.8  mg/dl)  within  10  days  after  treatment.  Secondary  efficacy 
parameters included time to relapse of TIH, duration of CR, change from baseline CSC level, and % 
patients with refractory TIH.  
Patients  achieving  CR  were  followed  until  day  56  in  Stage  I  or  CSC  >  2.90  mmol/l,  whichever 
occurred  first.  Also  patients  with  an  incomplete  response  but  CSC  <  2.90  on  day  10  were  followed 
until day 56 or until CSC equal to or above 2.90 mmol/l. In stage II, patients received retreatment with 
8 mg zoledronic acid if their TIH was refractory to initial treatment, or if the TIH relapsed as defined 
by  a  CSC  of  >  2.90  mmol/l.  If  retreatment  resulted  in  a  CR  by day  10,  the  patient  was  followed  in 
stage 2 for 4 weeks or until relapse, whichever occurred first. Patients who did not achieve CR upon 
retreatment were discontinued from the trial.  
Within each treatment group, the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of completed responders 
by  Day  10  was  calculated  using  the  normal  approximation  to  the  binomial  distribution.  Time  to 
relapse and duration were presented by Kaplan-Meier plots with descriptive statistics including 95% 
11/33 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
confidence  limits  on  the  median.  Additionally,  secondary  analyses  were  performed  on  between-
treatment  comparisons.  These  analyses  are  considered  secondary,  because  the  studies  were  not 
powered  to  detect  differences  between-treatment  groups.  The  proportion  of  complete  responders  by 
Day 4, 7 and 10, the change from baseline in CSC at Day 4, 7 and 10, and the time to relapse were 
analysed  using  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test  controlling  for  baseline  CSC,  analysis  of  covariance 
including  baseline  CSC  as  covariate,  and  Cox  regression  including  baseline  CSC  as  covariate 
respectively. 
Efficacy  analyses  were  performed  on  both  the  per  protocol  (PP)  population  and  the  intent-to-treat 
(ITT)  population.  The  PP  population,  which  consisted  of  all  randomised  patients  who  received  the 
i.v.infusion  at,  visit  1  (baseline)  and  satisfied  the  admission  criteria  for  TIH  was  considered  as  the 
primary  data  set  for  efficacy  analysis.  The  ITT  population  consisted  of  all  randomised  patients  who 
received the i.v. infusion at visit 1 (baseline) of Stage I of the trial.  
Safety analyses were based on the ITT population. 
In terms of baseline demographic characteristics the three treatment groups in 036 were generally well 
balanced.  The  mean  baseline  CSC  levels  (mmol/l)  were  3.50,  3.39  and  3.51,  respectively.  Renal 
function  and  hydration  state  were  similar  in  the  three  treatment  groups.  In  study  037  the  three 
treatment  groups  were  similar  with  regard  to  baseline  demographic  characteristics  including  CSC 
levels,  renal  function  and  hydration  status.  There  were  relatively  more  patients  with  breast  or 
haematological  cancer  in  the  4  mg  zoledronic  acid  group  as  compared  to  more  patients  with  lung 
cancer in the 8 mg zoledronic acid and pamidronate groups. The patients in the 4 mg zoledronic acid 
groups had a longer duration of cancer as compared to the two other treatment groups. Finally, there 
was a greater percentage of patients with bone metastases in the two zoledronic acid groups.

In  study  036  the  between-group  differences  in  CR  rates  at  Day  10  were  not  significant,  but  the 
zoledronic  acid  treated  patients  achieved  CR  more  rapidly  than  the  pamidronate  group.  CR  rates 
appeared to  be independent  of the  CSC baseline level  for  zoledronic  acid  4  mg  group,  and with the 
exception of baseline PTHrP all other baseline characteristics appeared to have little if any effect on 
CR rates. Patients with PTHrP level above 2.0 pmol/l had somewhat lower CR rates. 
In study 037 The between-group difference in CR rate at Day 10 was significantly higher in the 4 mg 
zoledronic acid group compared the pamidronate group (p=0.018). There was no clear dose response 
with zoledronic acid. CR rates appeared to be independent of the baseline severity of TIH.

Of the 34 patients in study 036 who received retreatment with zoledronic acid 8 mg, 23 had achieved 
CR in stage 1 of the trials, the remaining 11 were either refractory to treatment or had less than CR. 
CR was achieved by Day 10 in 19 (55.9%) patients. Patients with a prior CR in stage 1 had a CR rate 
of 74% whereas refractory or failing patients on initial therapy only had a CR rate of 18%.  
Of  the  35  per-protocol  patients  re-treated  in  037,  24  previously  had  CR  in  Stage  1  of  the  study  and 
were retreated because of relapsing TIH. Their CR rate in Stage 2 was 58%. The remaining 11 patients 
had  either  refractory  TIH,  partial  response  or  were  unclassified.  In  this  group,  the  response  rate  in 
Stage 2 was only 27%. The overall CR rate after retreatment with 8 mg zoledronic acid was 48.6% (17 
patients). 
Discontinuation rates due to death (before day 56) were similar in the 3 treatment groups, whereas the 
dicontinuation rate due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect was higher in the pamidronate group (13 in 
pamidronate group, 4 in zoledronic acid 4 mg group and 5 in zoledronic acid 8 mg group). The same 
was  seen  in  where  7  discontinued  in  the  pamidronate  because  of  unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect, 
where the same number for the 4 mg and 8 mg zoledronic acid groups was 3 and 1 respectively. 
Pre-planned analysis performed across trials. 
A prospective metaanalysis from the two studies 036 and 037 was performed since the individual trials 
were  not  powered  for  statistical  comparisons  between  treatments.  Given  the  known  variability  in 
response in patients with TIH to bisphosphonates a difference of 10% is considered acceptable. Thus, 
assuming an one-sided equivalence range of 10%, an expected response rate of 90% after pamidronate 
and of 92% after zoledronic acid 4 or 8 mg, 90 patients per treatment arm are necessary to show non-
inferiority  of  either dose  compared to  pamidronate  with  a two-sided test  on the 5% level  (one-sided 
test on the 2.5% level) and a power of 80%.

Again,  the  primary  efficacy  variable  was  CR  in  the  per  protocol  population  defined  as  CSC  <  2.70 
mmol/l (10.8 mg/dl) by Day 10 (Stage 1 – initial treatment). Patients who discontinued or died prior to 
Day 10, and never had a CR, were considered as non-responders. 
Although there were some differences in baseline cancer characteristics as reflected by the individual 
trials,  the  treatments  groups  were  comparable  with  respect  to  baseline  demographic  characteristics, 
severity of TIH, renal function and hydration status.

Both  doses  of  zoledronic  acid  (4  mg  and  8  mg)  were  declared  non-inferior  to  pamidronate  90  mg, 
since the 95% CI of the difference between zoledronic acid and pamidronate in the percentage of CR 
was not only above the –10% preset non-inferiority limit but also above 0%. This indicates that both 
zoledronic acid doses are statistically superior to pamidronate. The results are shown in table below:

In the pooled analysis 69 patients received retreatment in Stage 2 of the protocol. Day 10 achieved CR 
in  36  patients  (52.2%).  Patients  with  a  previous  response  to  bisphosphonate  had  a  higher  CR  rate 
(78.3%) than patients with initial refractory TIH (21.7%).

Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
The  more  rigorous  and  extensive  pharmacokinetic  evaluations  were  possible  only  in  the  surrogate 
population of cancer patients with bone metastases, who would offer more definitive and reliable, as 
well as representative pharmacokinetic data. This would also allow assessment of PK/PD relationships 
and  testing  the  influence  of  population  covariates  (intrinsic  and  extrinsic  factors)  on  PK.  From  a 
clinical point of view it is therefore justified to perform PK studies in patients with cancer and bone 
metastases but without overt TIH.

EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No  studies  have  been  performed  in  specific  populations,  such  as  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic 
impairment. In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment dose adjustments are not considered 
necessary as only relatively small increases in AUC (on average only about 1.6-fold higher in patients 
with  moderate  renal  impairment  compared  to  patients  with  normal  renal  function)  were  seen  in 
patients  with  increased  serum  creatinine  representing  mild  to  moderate  renal  impairment.  The 
recommended clinical dose in treatment/retreatment for zoledronic acid allows for an adequate margin 
in renal impairment, since single doses up to 16 mg have been shown to be well tolerated. Only data in 
patients  with  mild  and  moderate  renal  impairment  are  available  and  a  recommendation  to  monitor 
renal function is included in the SPC. Due to the lack of clinical data the applicant does currently not 
recommend the use of zoledronic acid in patients with severe renal impairment (i.e. serum creatinine 
values ≥ 400 µmol/l or ≥ 4.5 mg/dl). Lack of studies in patients with hepatic impairment is justified 
because the drug is not metabolised, experimental studies demonstrate low plasma protein binding, the 
absence  of  biotransformation  and  because  there  is  no  hepatic  clearance  of  zoledronic  acid. 
Pharmacokinetic  drug – drug interactions  related to  protein binding and  hepatic  metabolic  clearance 
processes are therefore not expected.  
Formal drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted, but this is well justified.  
The dose-finding study indicated that a dose of 2 to 4 mg maximum should be chosen for future phase 
II  trials  in  patients  with  TIH.  In  the  pivotal  trials  the  applicant  used  an  infusion  time  of  5  min  for 
zoledronic  acid  was  used.  This  shorter  infusion  time  had  been  used  in  the  trial  003  without  safety 
problem.  In  response  to  the  List  of  Questions  the  applicant  argued  that  the  dose  selection  for  the 
pivotal trials had also been based on studies in non-TIH patients (i.e. phase II dose ranging studies in 
patients with bone metastases) as well as some extrapolation from pamidronate experience. 
This  is  acceptable  given  the  efficacy  and  safety  results  of  pivotal  trials,  although  the  effective  dose 
might be lower than the recommended 4 mg dose.  
Due to concern about renal safety expressed by the CPMP in the List of Questions and emerging data 
from clinical trials in bone metastases the applicant has changed the recommended infusion time from 
5 to 15 minutes. Although this change is not founded on the clinical experience in patients with TIH, 
the change is based on data from patients with bone metastases in whom renal safety was improved by 
lengthening the infusion time without losing efficacy. 
The 8 mg dose recommended for retreatment had been tested without controls and 4 mg had not been 
tested. In response to the List of Questions the applicant argued that the choice of the 8 mg dose was 
based  on  clinical  experience  with  pamidronate  and  with  other  bisphosphonates  in  the  treatment  of 
TIH, which showed that repeated administration at the same dose as initial treatment produces lower 
response  rates.  In  addition,  study  007  demonstrated  that  the  efficacy  of  zoledronic  acid  4  mg  and 
pamidronate  90  mg  appeared  comparable.  Therefore,  the  higher  dose  of  zoledronic  acid,  8  mg,  was 
deemed to be the best dose for retreatment, since this dose would probably be at least as efficacious as 
the 4 mg zoledronic acid dose and the pamidronate 90 mg dose while offering patients initially treated 
with  8  mg  zoledronic  acid  the  greatest  protection  if  the  first  dose  did  not  result  in  a  sustained  or 
adequate  response.  Despite  this,  52.2%  of  patients  responded  to  the  8  mg  dose  when  retreated.  The 
SPC acknowledges this, but states that limited data are available regarding retreatment.The applicant 
committed  to  perform  a  clinical  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  the  retreatment  in  TIH  patients 
comparing a dose of Zometa 4 mg and 8 mg. 
The applicant has shown a consistent high activity of zoledronic acid (4 or 8 mg single dose) in the 
treatment of tumour-induced-hypercalcaemia.  
In the preplanned metaanalysis zoledronic acid (4 or 8 mg) was shown to be not only non-inferior to, 
but  also  statistically  significantly  superior  to  pamidronate  90  mg  for  3  important  efficacy  variables 
(proportion of complete responders at  Day 90, change in CSC from baseline  at Day 10, and time to 
relapse).  The  applicant  considered  it  appropriate  to  switch  the  objective  of  the  analysis  from 
non-inferiority  to  superiority  although  not  explicitly  stated  in  the  pooled  analysis  protocol  for  a 
number of reasons. 
The  justification  is  in  concurrence  with  the  CPMP  Points  to  consider  paper  on  this  topic 
(CPMP/EWP/482/99).  The  factors  that  might  be  affected  by  the  change  in  the  objective  such  as 
appropriateness  of  comparator,  power  calculations,  size  of  additional  clinical  benefit,  choice  of 
16/33

analysis  population,  trial  quality  have  all  been  addressed  by  the  applicant.  Additionally,  the  
meta-analysis  protocol  was  not  done  post  hoc,  but  was  preplanned.  The  clinical  relevant  difference 
was determined a priori and the results imply clinically relevant superiority.  
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The  population  evaluated  for  safety  comprises  patients  from  the  3  studies  in  the  treatment  of  TIH 
(CJ/HC1, 036, 037), 3 studies in the treatment of bone metastases (003, 007, 035). Studies 007, 036 & 
037 compare zoledronic acid with pamidronate.

Hypocalcaemia  and  hypophosphataemia  were  slightly  more  common  among  patients  treated  with 
zoledronic acid than in the pamidronate group. 
A  slightly  greater  proportion  of  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  4  mg  and  zoledronic  acid  8  mg 
treatment  groups  had  renal  adverse  events  reported  compared  to  the  other  treatment  group 
pamidronate  90  mg.  A  higher  incidence  of  patients  classified  as  having  abnormal  renal  function, 
uraemia,  and  urinary  retention  in  these  2  groups  accounted  for  most  of  this  difference,  which  on 
further analysis of all Renal Adverse Event terms was determined not to be statistically significant.

Although there are slightly more events in the zoledronic acid treatment group, the overall incidence is 
low, there is no dose-related trend in overall occurrence of renal events in the zoledronic acid groups, 
and there is a lower incidence after retreatment. A review of patient histories shows that the zoledronic 
acid groups included a higher proportion of patients with a prior medical history of renal dysfunction 
or conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperuricaemia, which predisposed them to renal 
dysfunction, as well as a history of co-administration of nephrotoxic medications. A review of the 
renal adverse event profile determined that none of the renal adverse event was ascribed to the study 
drugs by the investigator. 
In response to the List of Questions the applicant listed all renal cases reported in the pivotal studies 
036 and 037. There is no statistical significant difference with regard to the overall incidence of renal 
events among all treatment groups. On the other hand there were numerically slightly more events 
listed with acute renal failure, renal function abnormal and uraemia in the zoledronic acid treatment 
groups as compared to the pamidronate group.  
Out of the 217 TIH patients treated, 58 (26.7%) died and 102 (47%) had serious AEs. Only in one case 
(confusion and hallucinations) did the investigator assess the AE to be related to the study medication.

Six patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg, 1 patient treated with zoledronic acid 8 mg, 2 patients 
retreated with zoledronic acid 8 mg and 2 patients treated with pamidronate experienced serious renal 
SAEs.  For  none  of  these  patients  did  the  investigator  consider  the  renal  SAE  to  be  related  to  the 
treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
A slightly higher frequency of low WBC and platelets (4.9% and 5.1% respectively) was seen in the 
zoledronic acid 4 mg group than in the 8 mg group (1.1% and 1.2% respectively), probably due to the 
more frequent use of chemotherapy in this group. 
The most common grade 3 or 4 haematological values for each treatment group were in absolute 
lymphocyte count. Similarly, although abnormalities in liver function tests were common, there 
appeared to be no consistent or systematic effects or differences between the treatment groups in effect 
on the liver. 
Hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia occurred more frequently following both doses of zoledronic 
acid than with pomegranate. No consistent effect of zoledronic acid was observed on serum 
magnesium, sodium or potassium levels.

Safety in special populations 
In patients with bone metastases, the AEs reported were similar to those reported in the TIH studies. 
Rates of deaths and serious adverse events were lower reflecting that TIH patients had more advanced 
cancer. In  patients  with  bone  metastases the frequency  of renal  AEs was similar for  zoledronic acid 
and pamidronate. 
Discussion on Clinical Safety 
The renal adverse events were numerically more frequently reported in the zoledronic acid treatment 
arms and in response to the List of Questions the applicant carried out a number of additional analyses 
pertaining to renal safety.  
There  was  a  numerical  greater  number  and  percentage  of  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  treatment 
groups with a renal adverse event term 14/86 (16.3%) and 14/98 (14.3%) with zoledronic acid 4 and 8 
mg,  respectively)  when  compared  to  pamidronate  (10/103  (9.7%)).  There  are,  however,  not  any 
statistically  significant  differences  in  the  number  of  patients  who  experienced  a  renal  adverse  event 
between the treatment groups as shown in the table below.

When analysing the narratives of the renal adverse events it was found that in none of these cases was 
the renal event considered to be study drug related by the investigator. The following conditions were 
repeatedly  found,  which  could  possibly  explain  the  occurrence  of  the  renal  event:  progression  or 
complications of underlying disease or those of its treatment, concomitant conditions (e.g. infections, 
cardio-pulmonary  failure,  diabetes),  concomitant  potentially  nephrotoxic  medication,  conditions  that 
were present prior to study start (e.g. hyperuricemia, urethral stricture) or mechanical irritation during 
urinary catheterisation.  
The  proportion  of  patients  with  an  increase  in  serum  creatinine  of  0.5  mg/dl  from  baseline  or  with 
serum creatinine >4.5 mg/dl in TIH studies showed a tendency to increase with increasing zoledronic 
acid dose. However, there were no significant differences across the treatment groups in the TIH trials 
with  respect  to  serum  creatinine  increases.  Another  analysis  was  carried  out  classifying  patients 
according to specified changes from baseline serum creatinine levels. Deterioration in renal function 
was  defined  as  an  increase  of  serum  creatinine  of  0.5  mg/dl  (44.2  µmol/l)  or  more  if  the  baseline 
serum creatinine level was normal (less than 1.4 mg/dl); an increase of serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dl 
(88.4  µmol/l)  or  more  if  the  baseline  serum  creatinine  level  was  abnormal;  or  doubling  the  serum 
creatinine level from baseline regardless of baseline serum creatinine level. The results are shown in 
the table below.

The statistical analysis of these data has not revealed any statistically significant differences between 
the treatment groups in the number of patients with increases in serum creatinine.  
In  the  completed  studies  in  the  treatment  of  bone  metastases  there  were  no  statistically  significant 
differences in the number of patients with renal adverse events between the treatment groups. There 
were  no  significant  differences  in  the  number  of  patients  with  serum  creatinine  changes  across  the 
zoledronic acid and pamidronate treatment groups. However patients switched to zoledronic acid 8mg 
dose had a higher incidence in serum creatinine changes due to the fact that these patients were on the 
trial  twice  as  long  as  the  original  treatment  groups  and  there  was  a  preponderance  of  multiple 
myeloma patients in this group.  
Analysis of unblinded information on renal safety of ongoing studies in treatment of bone metastases 
confirm that the dose and infusion time adjustments made in the ongoing trials resulted in a safe use of 
zoledronic acid, also when chronically administered. 
The applicant has committed to provide additional safety data especially regarding renal safety, from 
ongoing long-term studies testing Zometa 4 mg versus a control administered in a 15 minutes infusion 
and to provide post-marketing surveillance data accordingly. 
When treating TIH patients with zoledronic acid, precautions should be taken to minimise risk factors 
for renal dysfunction, including rehydration and avoidance of co-administration of aminoglycosides or 
other  nephrotoxic  medications,  as  well  as  consideration  of  a  more  prolonged  infusion  time.  This  is 
reflected in the SPC.

Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Quality 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Preclinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Overall,  the  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  provided  adequate  evidence  that  zoledronic  acid  has 
antiresorptive effects on osteoclasts and in comparative pharmacodynamic studies zoledronic acid was 
shown  to  have  a  considerably  higher  potency  than  pamidronate,  the  currently  most  used 
bisphosphonate for the treatment of TIH. 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed that zoledronic acid was not genotoxic and no tumour 
inducing effect was observed in the carcinogenicity studies.

In  preclinical  studies  zoledronic  acid  has  toxic  effects  on  the  kidney,  liver,  osseous  skeleton, 
gastrointestinal tract and is a local irritant. The renal NOAEL in rat and dog studies compared with the 
highest intended human dose of 8 mg varied within narrow limits (between 8 and 1 times the human 
dose). At higher i.v. doses the toxic effects included inflammation, haemorrhage and erosions in the 
gastrointestinal  tract;  hepatocellular  necrosis,  haemorrhage  and  inflammation;  severe  local  skin 
inflammation  at  the  injection  site.  Hypocalcaemia  and  hypomagnesiaemia  combined  with  lowered 
bone alkaline phosphatase were the most prominent laboratory findings. 
The total systemic exposure to the highest dose in rats and in dogs was respectively about 1-8 and 6-
28 times the highest expected human exposure (8 mg). 
Zoledronic acid causes foetal skeleton malformations. Zoledronic acid is contraindicated in pregnant 
women. This is reflected in the SPC. 
Efficacy 
The data provided support the claim that doses of 4 mg is effective in the treatment of tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia and at least as effective as the highest recommended dose of pamidronate. The results 
are corroborated by a preplanned metaanalysis of the data from the two pivotal studies, which shows 
that zoledronic acid is statistically superior to pamidronate. 
At a dose of 4 mg as single i.v. infusion, zoledronic acid consistently normalised the serum calcium 
level in about 90% of the patients treated. The results of the secondary parameters (mean change in 
corrected serum calcium levels, time to relapse of TIH, duration of response and duration of complete 
response) are similar to the results of the primary parameter. 
No  studies  have  been  performed  in  patients  with  renal  impairment.  Dose  adjustments  are  not 
considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment and the use in patients with 
severe renal impairment is not recommended. This is reflected in the SPC.  
Safety 
The incidence of AEs is high in TIH trials as expected in this population. The most frequent reported 
AE were fever, progression of cancer, anaemia, constipation, nausea, and dyspnea. Overall, the safety 
profile of Zometa including SAEs did not differ from that of pamidronate. 
The renal adverse event profile of zoledronic acid and pamidronate is similar. There was no difference 
between the treatment groups with regard to increases in serum creatinine. Zoledronic acid is renally 
excreted  and  therefore  could  be  associated  with  renal  dysfunction,  especially  in  patients  with  pre-
existing  renal  impairment,  a  medical  history  of  pre-disposing  conditions  or  concomitant,  potential 
nephrotoxic medications. 
The applicant has committed to provide additional safety data especially regarding renal safety, from 
ongoing long-term studies testing Zometa 4 mg versus a control administered in a 15 minutes infusion, 
and to provide post-marketing surveillance data accordingly. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
The overall benefit/risk assessment is considered to be positive considering that 
• 
• 
• 
the clinical efficacy is established compared to the chosen bisphosphonate reference treatment 
zoledronic acid was shown in the pivotal studies to be at least as effective and in the preplanned 
metaanalysis  to  be  statistically  superior  to  pamidronate,  this  difference  was  shown  to  be 
clinically relevant. 
The  renal  adverse  event  profile  of  zoledronic  acid  is  comparable  to  that  of  the  chosen 
bisphosphonate reference treatment. 
Thus, the overall risk/benefit balance for Zometa is positive. 
Based on the CPMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus 
that  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Zometa  in  the  treatment  of  tumour-induced  hypercalcaemia  was 
favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

6.1. 
Introduction 
The  development  of  bone  metastases  is  a  common  event  for  cancer  patients,  in  particular  for  those 
patients  suffering  from  cancers  in  the  breast,  lung  or  prostate.  Pain,  pathologic  fractures,  and 
neurologic deficits resulting from spinal cord compression are symptoms and complications caused by 
bone  metastases.  A  central  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  bone  metastases  is  played  by  osteoclasts, 
specialised bone cells which erode mineralised bone by secreting acids and lysosomal enzymes. The 
disruption  of  normal  bone  remodeling  seen  in  this  setting  develops  because  tumour  cells  synthesise 
and  release  soluble  factors  (e.g.  PTHrP,  growth  factors,  and  cytokines)  that  stimulate  osteoclastic 
activity. This increased osteoclastic activity leads to focal destruction of bone at the site of osteolytic 
metastases.  Bone  metastasis  characterised  by  increased  radiographic  density  is  called  osteoblastic 
metastasis.  Occasionally,  patients  might  have  metastases  with  a  mixed  osteolytic  and  osteoblastic 
pattern. It appears that osteoblastic metastases are also dependent on osteoclastic activity because the 
local formation of abnormal new bone is preceded by local osteoclastic resorption. 
Bisphosphonates  are  effective  inhibitors  of  osteoclastic  bone  resorption  and  have  demonstrated 
therapeutic efficacy (in terms of reducing skeletal events and/or controlling bone pain) in the treatment 
of lytic bone disease associated with multiple myeloma, lytic and blastic bone metastases associated 
with  breast  cancer,  and  in  controlling  bone  pain  in  blastic  bone  metastases  associated  with  prostate 
cancer. However, no currently available bisphosphonate has been demonstrated to significantly reduce 
skeletal events in patients with predominantly blastic metastases. Newer more potent bisphosphonates 
might be useful in the treatment of bone metastases of prostate cancer. 
6.2  Quality aspects:   
N/A 
6.3.  Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Additional  pharmacological  data  on  zoledronic  acid  monohydrate  were  reported  from  studies  done 
since  the  initial  application  for  the  treatment  of  TIH.  The  new  data  indicated  that  zoledronic  acid  is 
effective against the bone resorption induced by lytic bone metastases arising from malignant tumour 
cells, as it was in benign models of elevated bone turnover. These effects are probably shared by other 
bisphosphonates  too.  It  was  also  suggested  that  zoledronic  acid  has  anti-tumour  and  anti-angiogenic 
properties,  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo.  Further  investigations  are  needed  to  confirm  the  additional 
pharmacological effects, to establish whether similar properties are shared by other bisphosphonates or 
are unique to zoledronic acid, and to clarify the mechanism of action. 
Zoledronic  acid  was  well  tolerated  in  all  the  in  vivo  experiments  up  to  the  highest  dose  tested  of 
250 µg/kg/day.  The  main  issue  regarding  the  additional  pharmacological  effects  of  zoledronic  acid, 
and  possibly  other  bisphosphonates,  is  the  different  concentration  required.  The  50%  inhibition  of 
viability  and  growth  of  endothelial  cells  appears  at  2-7,  µM  i.e.,  130  –  460  times  higher  than  that 
needed to inhibit osteoclasts (15 nM in a particular murine model, for instance). Moreover, except for 
human bladder cancer cells, the 50 % inhibition of growth of other tumour lines is observed at much 
higher concentrations (13-30 µM) than in normal endothelial cells.

Pharmacodynamics 
The  effect  of  zoledronic  acid  on  serum  and  urinary  markers  of  bone  formation  and  resorption  was 
studied  in  J001,  505/503E  and  506.  In  view  of  a  large  interpatient  and  interstudy  variability  in  the 
bone marker data, no clear-cut dose-response and duration-response relationships could be established. 
In earlier dose ranging studies in patients with Paget’s disease of  bone and patients with cancer and 
bone  metastases  described  in  the  original  application,  low  single  and  multiple  doses  (0.1  mg  to  0.4 
mg)  produced  no  or  only  marginal  inhibitory  effects,  while  higher  doses  resulted  in  significant 
decreases of serum and urinary markers of bone resorption from baseline. The dose seemed to affect 
the duration of the effect too, as the earlier dose ranging studies, as well as studies J001, 503, and 506 
showed, that doses ≥ 4 mg strongly inhibited bone markers up to >3-4 weeks, whereas doses ≤ 2 mg 
did not have a prolonged effect. When the drug was administered chronically q 3-4 weeks, doses ≥ 4 
mg  provided  the  most  consistent  effect,  reducing  bone  markers  of  bone  resorption  throughout  the 
period of treatment.  
Pharmacodynamic studies also evaluated renal safety. Renal toxicity seemed to be dose-related. Single 
zoledronic acid doses of 4 mg to 16 mg had no immediate (24-hour post-dose) renal effect on serum 
creatinine. Long-term monitoring of serum creatinine (in study 503) revealed no clinically important 
changes in the 12 patients in the 4 mg q 4 weeks 5-min and 15-min infusion groups.  However, 2 out 
of 12 patients in the 8 mg q 4 weeks group, and 3/12 patients in the 16 mg q 4 weeks group, all with 
multiple  myeloma,  showed  serum  creatinine  increases  >0.5  mg/dL.  Data  from  study  506  confirmed 
the  lack  of  deleterious  renal  effect  of  three  monthly  4-mg  doses,  irrespective  of  baseline  renal 
function. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics of zoledronic acid were described in the original application based on studies 
J001 and 503. The present application included an extension of one of those studies (503E) and study 
506. The first addressed the effect of different infusion times; the second the effect of various degrees 
of  renal  impairment.  Zoledronic  acid  underwent  rapid  biphasic  disappearance  from  the  systemic 
circulation, followed by a gradual elimination phase. The longer infusion (15 min vs 5 min) of the 4 
mg dose gave an approximately 30% decrease in the post-end-infusion concentrations (Cend) but no 
significant differences in the partial area under the curve (AUC
max
and AUC
) were essentially dose-proportional in the range of 4-16 mg. Approximately 40% of the 
dose was excreted in the 24-h urine, with very low urinary excretion thereafter regardless of the dose 
and  duration  of  infusion.  Renal  clearance  of  zoledrenate  correlated  significantly  with  creatinine 
clearance after the first intravenous dose. Accumulation was low after repeated doses.

Within 24 h after infusion 30% to 40% of zoledronic acid was excreted in urine. The differences from 
patients  with  normal  renal  function  were  small  (-19  to  17%)  and  not  significant.  There  was  no 
accumulation  of  zoledronic  acid  in  renal  impairment.  Pharmacokinetics  in  severe  renal  impairment 
was not studied.

specific to 039). 
Dose-response  
One  active-controlled  (pamidronate)  dose-finding  study  (007)  was  conducted.  Patients  were 
randomised to 0.4, 2, or 4 mg zoledronic acid (5-min infusion), or pamidronate 90 mg given as a 2-
hour  IV  infusion  every  4  weeks  for  9  months.  The  study  tested  whether  the  proportion  of  patients 
requiring  radiation  to  bone  in  each  group  was  significantly  less  than  30%.  All  treatment  groups  but 
zoledronic acid 0.4 mg met this criterion. The doses used in efficacy trials (4-8 mg) were higher than 
the minimum effective dose identified in 007. The infusion time tested (5 min) had to be prolonged to 
15  min  in  order  to  minimise  the  renal  toxicity  that  appeared  in  several  patients  exposed  to  these 
dosages. 
Efficacy / Safety 
Pivotal  efficacy  data  were  provided  by  one  non-inferiority  trial  vs  pamidronate  (010),  and  two 
superiority trials vs placebo as illustrated in table 2: 
The  primary efficacy variable in each study was the proportion of patients experiencing at least one 
skeletal-related event (SRE), which included radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, pathological 
bone fractures, spinal cord compression, or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain (only in 
study  039).  Secondary  endpoints  were:  time  to  progression  of  disease;  time  to  progression  of  bone 
lesions;  objective  bone  lesion  response  from  radiological  studies;  pain  score  (Brief  Pain  Inventory); 
26/33 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analgesic score; ECOG performance scores; bone mineral density; and biochemical  markers of bone 
turnover. TIH was included as an SRE for some secondary efficacy analyses. 
In  view  of  the  increased  incidence  of  renal  adverse  events  the  MAH  amended  ongoing  trials  and 
increased the initial infusion time for zoledronic acid from 5 min to 15 min, and the infusion volume 
from 50 mL to 100 mL. Following further safety analysis in studies 039, 010, and 011 (then ongoing), 
the  Data  Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  and  an  independent  board  composed  of  nephrologists, 
recommended that all patients randomised to 8 mg zoledronic acid be switched to 4 mg in June 2000. 
These subsets of patients, referred to as “8/4 mg groups”, were not included in the primary analyses of 
the relevant trials, but results are reported for this group as well. 
Study 010  
The company sought scientific advice from European health authorities on the design of 010. On the 
basis of this advice, the MAH designed the statistical non-inferiority parameters of zoledronic acid 4 
mg compared to pamidronate 90 mg so that ‘the upper bound of a two-sided 95% confidence interval 
for the difference on the primary endpoint is below the non-inferiority margin of 8%. The 8% margin 
was  chosen,  since  the  intention  was  to  establish  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  zoledronic  acid  in  the 
treatment  of  bone  metastases  across  a  broad  spectrum  of  patients  (5-6%  had  conversely  been 
suggested  by  the  health  authorities).  Pamidronate  was  chosen  as  a  comparator  since  it  is  considered 
standard  treatment  for  breast  cancer  and  MM  patients  with  cancer-related  bone  lytic  lesions. 
Superiority tests were 2-sided (5% level). 
The  treatment  groups  were  well  matched  at  baseline  for  demographic  and  disease  characteristics. 
Patients treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg had fewer SRE than those treated with pamidronate (-2%, 
95% CI -7.9% to 3.7%), (Table 3) and the upper limit of the 95% CI of the difference was less than 
the specified non-inferiority margin of 8%.

In the stratum of breast cancer patients receiving hormonal therapy, the difference between ZOMETA 
4 mg and AREDIA was –5.4%, which was the largest difference observed in any of the 3 strata in this 
study.  The  median  time  to  first  occurrence  of  any  SRE  (including  TIH)  was  also  similar  between 
treatment groups. The mean SMR of any SRE (including TIH) up to month 13 was slightly lower for 
the ZOMETA groups than for the AREDIA 90 mg group, but differences between treatments were not 
statistically  significant.  The  specific  SRE  that  mostly  accounted  for  the  observed  tendency  to 
reduction  was  “radiation  therapy”  which  may  depend  on  subjective  decisions  and,  though  important 
itself,  is  less  so  than  other  endpoints  such  as  fractures.  The  proportion  of  patients  with  spinal  cord 
compression, surgery to bone, and hypercalcemia was very small in all treatment groups.

No  clinically  or  statistically  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups  were  observed  for  all 
secondary efficacy endpoints, including the composite pain score, the analgesic score and the quality 
of life assessment. 
217 out of 1643 patients (13.2%) died. Mortality did not differ significantly in the treatment groups. 
Drug-related SAE were more frequent in the zoledronic acid 8/4 group than with zoledronic acid 4 mg 
and pamidronate 90 mg (4.6% vs. 1.8 and 1.4%). Renal SAE were somewhat different even in patients 
randomised  after  the  infusion  amendment:  1.9%  in  the  zoledronic  acid  8/4  mg  group  (acute  renal 
failure being the most common, 1.3%) compared with 0.5% with 4 mg and 0.2% with pamidronate. 
Renal function deterioration measured by serum creatinine levels was more frequent in the zoledronic 
acid  groups  (13.2  and  20.4  %)  than  with  pamidronate  (6.7%).  After  the  15-minute  infusion 
amendment, proportions of those experiencing deterioration were similar with 4 mg and pamidronate 
(8.8 vs. 8.2%), though still higher in the 8/4 mg group (18.6%).  
Study 039  
The  use  of  placebo  in  the  control  arm  is  considered  appropriate.  The  treatment  groups  were  well 
matched  in  terms  of  demographic  variables  and  for  most  disease  variables,  but  there  were  some 
28/33 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indications  of  slightly  more  severe  disease  in  the  8/4  mg  zoledronic  acid  group,  namely  higher 
baseline  serum  levels  of  prostate-specific  antigen  (PSA),  and  slightly  higher  percentages  of  patients 
with ECOG scores over 2 and higher analgesic scores. The zoledronic acid 8/4 mg group also had a 
greater percentage of patients with abnormal renal function (serum creatinine ≥ 1.4 mg/dL) at baseline 
(21.6% versus 19.2% in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group and 15.9% in the placebo group). 
As shown in Table 6, zoledronic acid (4 mg) was more effective than placebo in preventing SRE. In 
this study, only two patients experienced TIH, and both of them also had other SRE; analyses of SRE 
including and excluding TIH are therefore identical. The difference in SRE rates between zoledronic 
acid 4 mg and placebo was evident after only three months of treatment, a clinically important finding.

It is noteworthy that zoledronic acid 8/4 mg did not achieve the same advantage as the 4 mg dose. This 
lack of consistency was surprising as one would expect the higher doses to produce better efficacy, 
though possibly more toxicity. 
The incidence of all SRE (including pathological, vertebral, and non-vertebral fractures) was 
consistently lower with zoledronic acid 4 mg than placebo (Table 7).

Among  the  secondary  outcome  measures,  time  to  the  first  occurrence  of  any  SRE  was  significantly 
longer with zoledronic acid 4 mg than placebo.  The median time to the first occurrence of a SRE for 
the  zoledronic  acid  4  mg  group  (≥  420  days)  was  99  days  longer  than  with  placebo.  However,  the 
median time to progression of bone lesions was similar in the three treatment groups, and the median 
time to overall disease progression was also the same (84 days). 
During  the  study  or  within  28  days  of  last  dose  of  the  study  drug  114  patients  died.  Mortality  was 
similar in the zoledronic acid 4 mg group (14.5%) and the placebo group (16.8%); the zoledronic acid 
8/4  mg  treatment  group  had  higher  mortality  (22.0%).  The  most  frequent  cause  of  death  was 
aggravated  malignant  neoplasm,  but four patients  from  the  8/4  mg group died  secondary to  renal or 
urinary disorders. 
The  incidence  of  AE  was  similar  in  all  groups,  although  some  gastrointestinal  AE  such  as  nausea, 
vomiting, constipation, and anorexia were more frequent in the zoledronic acid 8/4 mg group. In this 
group renal AE were also more frequent than in the other groups, patients randomized before or after 
the 15-minute infusion amendment.  
Renal function deterioration evaluated according to serum creatinine levels was more frequent in the 
zoledronic  acid  4  and  8/4  mg  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group  both  before  the  15-minute  infusion 
amendment (19.8%, 33.3%, and 9.9%), and after (15.2%, 20.7%, and 11.5%).  
Study 011  
20 different primary tumour types were included in this study with non-small cell lung cancer being 
the  predominant  primary  cancer  (49%).  The  most  frequent  among  others  were  renal  cell  carcinoma 
(10%), small cell lung cancer (8%), colorectal cancer (7%). The use of placebo in the control arm is

considered appropriate. The treatment groups were balanced with respect to demographic and disease 
characteristics  at  baseline.  The  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  at  least  one  SRE,  including  and 
excluding  TIH,  is  shown  in  the  Table  below.  Although  a  6%  reduction  in  SRE  was  observed  for 
Zometa 4 mg group, this was not a statistically significant difference from placebo (95% CI-15.2% to 
1.9%).

The  incidence  of  all  SRE  (with  the  exception  of  “surgery  to  bone”)  was  consistently  lower  with 
zoledronic  acid  4  mg  than  placebo,  but  only  the  difference  between  ZOMETA  8/4  mg  and  placebo 
was statistically significant. If TIH is included as an SRE, the proportion of patients having SREs in 
the  ITT  population  as  a  whole  became  statistically  significantly  lower  in  both  ZOMETA  treatment 
groups  than  for  placebo.  However,  statistical  significance  was  not  achieved  for  the  lung  cancer 
patients stratum. Subgroup analysis according to the pre- and post-15 minutes amendment shows that 
the effect of duration of infusion was negligible. 
The skeletal morbidity rate (number of SREs per year) was 2.24 in Zometa 4 mg  group and 2.73 in 
placebo  group.  With  regard  to  secondary  endpoints,  zoledronic  acid  4  mg  delayed  the  time  to  first 
SRE by 67 days compared to placebo. Time to progression of bone lesions and progression of disease 
with zoledronic acid 4 mg were also longer: the median time to progression of bone lesions (145 days) 
and median time to progression of disease (89 days) were also longer than with placebo (109 days and 
84 days, respectively), but these differences were not statistically significant.  
Approximately one third of the patients in each of the treatment groups died during the study or within 
28  days  of  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.  The  time  to  death  was  similar  for  all  treatment  groups.  The 
most frequent cause of death was progression of the underlying cancer. SAE were reported for similar 
percentages  of  patients  in  the  zoledronic  acid  and  placebo  treatment  groups.  Renal-related  AE  were 
more  common  in  the  zoledronic  acid  4  mg  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  before  the  15-minute 
infusion amendment, but the frequency was similar after the amendment. However, some specific AE 
were more frequent in the zoledronic acid groups, particularly increased serum creatinine (4.0% in the 
8/4 mg group, 2.7% in the 4 mg group and 0.5% in the placebo group), and acute renal failure (3.5%, 
2.2% and 0.5%, respectively). Most SAE appeared to be related to the underlying disease, and most 
30/33 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were judged not to be study drug-related by the investigators. Renal SAE such as acute renal failure, 
irrespective of causality, occurred at a higher rate in the zoledronic acid patients: 7.2% in the 8/4 mg 
group, 5.1% in the 4 mg group and 3.6% in the placebo group.  
Discussion of clinical efficacy 
The  composite  primary  endpoint  reduction  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with  any  skeletal  related 
events (SRE) as well as each type of event included in the composite endpoint are acceptable clinical 
measures for the impact of bone metastases for the patient. Although statistical significance has been 
demonstrated in some of the clinical trials the absolute differences between proportions are small and 
it is difficult to assess the true clinical benefit of such reductions.  The important issue is, therefore, 
whether an absolute reduction in the proportion of patients with SRE from 44% (placebo group study 
011)  to  38%  (Zometa  4  mg  group  study  011)  or  an  absolute  reduction  in  the  proportion  of  patients 
with SRE from 44% (placebo group study 039) to 33% (Zometa 4 mg group study 039) represents a 
relevant clinical benefit regardless of the level of statistical significance. The effects on SRE are not 
easily  translated  into  beneficial  effects  such  as  less  palliative  radiotherapy,  less  surgery  because  of 
pathological  bone  fracture  or  medullary  compression.  The  data  provided  suggest  that,  overall, 
symptomatic  SRE  can  be  better  controlled  with  Zometa  4mg,  but  none  of  the  individual  outcomes 
considered  (less  radiotherapy,  less  surgery,  less  cord  compression)  have  been  shown  to  improve 
compared  with  placebo,  although  any  numerical  difference  may  not  be  statistically  significant.  It  is 
acknowledged that a prolongation of the time to first SRE by approximately 2 months and 3 months 
with  Zometa  (Study  011  and  Study  039)  is  very  supportive  of  clinical  benefit.  Likewise,  the  pre-
planned  Anderson-Gill  analysis  taking  into  account  the  time  to  each  SRE  further  supports  the 
consistency of the results. Improvement in quality of Life and pain control are postulated and probable 
but not directly supported by the data. 
In  study  010  (breast  cancer  and  multiple  myeloma)  the  MAH  has  compared  ZOMETA  with  an 
approved  active  substance,  AREDIA,  and  non-inferiority  as  regards  efficacy  has  been  documented. 
Even with a non-inferiority margin of 8%, this phase III trial has provided sufficient robust evidence 
for comparable activity for ZOMETA versus AREDIA. 
In  study  039  (prostate  cancer)  ZOMETA  demonstrated  statistically  significant  efficacy  in  reducing 
skeletal  morbidity  due  to  bone  metastases  in  prostate  cancer.  However,  this  study  is  not  without 
problems.  It  is  not  clear  why  the  study  failed  to  show  efficacy  for  the  8/4  mg  group.  In  contrast, 
ZOMETA  4  mg  was  statistically  superior  to  placebo  with  proportions  of  patients  with  SRE  of  33% 
and 44%, respectively. 
Clinical study 011 supporting the indication “mixed bone metastases of solid tumours” failed to show 
statistical  significance  for  the  primary  endpoint  at  the  recommended  dose  of  4  mg.  Moreover,  a 
subgroup analysis, the same clinical study was not powered to detect statistical significance for, failed 
to  show  efficacy  for  both  ZOMETA  doses  (4  mg  and  8/4  mg)  in  patients  with  non-small  cell  lung 
cancer (approximately 50% of the patients included in the study). Results of the preplanned Anderson-
Gill analysis, which takes into account  the clinically meaningful endpoints total number of SREs and 
the  time  to  each  SRE  showed  that  Zometa  4  mg  reduced  the  overall  rate  of  occurrence  of  SREs  by 
approximately 27% compared to placebo. In the lung cancer stratum, the risk reduction of 27% with 
Zometa 4 mg versus placebo nearly reached statistical significance (p=0.06).  
During an oral explanation by the MAH with the CPMP the efficacy in patients with bone metastases 
in  solid  tumours  other  than  breast  or  prostate  cancer  (study  011)  was  not  achieved  for  the  primary 
endpoint of  the  proportion of patients  with  SREs. Secondary endpoints  such  as time to  first skeletal 
event  should  also  be  considered  important  for  such  patients  with  short  life  expectancy.  Skeletal 
morbidity rate was reduced by 11% if TIH is not included as an event and by 18 % if TIH is included. 
The decision to treat a patient should also take into consideration that the time needed for a treatment 
effect can be 2-3 months. The MAH discussed the possible impact of the large limits allowed for non-
inferiority  on  documentation  of  efficacy  of  Zometa  compared  to  pamindronate.  Although  study  010 
could  have  supported  claims  of  non-inferiority  with  as  little  as  40  %  retention  of  the  pamindronate 
effect, study results demonstrate an effect of 116% (95% CI: 72% to 159%) relative to pamindronate 
31/33 
EMEA 2005 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in earlier placebo-controlled trials. The MAH provided additional analysis results of study 010 similar 
to those provided for studies 011 and 039; breakdown of individual events in each treatment group and 
an Andersen - Gill multiple event analysis was performed. Findings from these analyses support the 
objective of non-inferiority.  
Furthermore, the MAH presented a table indicating the proportion of prostate cancer patients having 
each component of SRE by lesion type (lytic, blastic, other) in study 039. The treatment effects were 
less pronounced in patients with blastic lesions. 
Discussion of clinical safety 
The primary safety population consisted of 3,337 patients (2,251 treated with ZOMETA) from 1 phase 
II and three randomized, controlled bone metastases studies. The supportive safety population consists 
of  additional  493  patients  from  other  completed  secondary  (phase  I  or  open-label)  bone  metastases 
trials.  
With regards to renal safety, it seems that the increase in infusion time to 15 minutes and decrease in 
dose from 8 mg to 4 mg ZOMETA has provided evidence that the renal profile of ZOMETA is now 
similar to pamidronate 90 mg and placebo. The individual changes in serum creatinine seen in these 
ongoing trials suggest that the changes are reversible and for the 4 mg ZOMETA group have become 
uncommon with the 15 minutes infusion time. It can be concluded that 8 mg dose is clearly associated 
with a higher risk of renal function, but for the recommended dose of 4 mg the risk of renal toxicity 
associated with Zometa as compared with either placebo or pamindronate appears to be justified and 
manageable.  
Other  adverse  events  suspected  to  be  drug-  related  are  presented  in  table  .Nausea,  fatigue,  pyrexia, 
diarrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, cough, and headache occurred more frequently in the ZOMETA 4 mg, 
8/4  mg,  and  AREDIA  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group.  A  dose  relationship  for  ZOMETA  was 
observed for hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia notable values.

Benefit/ risk ratio and overall conclusion  
In clinical trials 011 (mixed bone metastases from solid tumours) and 039 (prostate cancer), statistical 
significance  with  regard  to  the  primary  endpoint:  reduction  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with  any 
skeletal  related  events  (SRE)  has  been  demonstrated,  however  the  absolute  differences  between 
proportions  are  small  and  the  true  clinical  benefit  of  such  reductions  is  difficult  to  assess.

Symptomatic SREs can be better controlled with Zometa, but there was no evidence of improvement 
in individual outcomes. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that a prolongation of the time to first SRE 
by  approximately  2  months  and  3  months  with  Zometa  in  studies  011  and  039  respectively  is  very 
supportive  of  clinical  benefit.  Improvement  in  quality  of  Life  and  pain  control  are  postulated  and 
probable  but  not  directly  supported  by  the  data.  In  study  010  (breast  cancer  and  multiple  myeloma 
patients) there is robust evidence of comparable activity for Zometa versus Aredia. 
In overall, ZOMETA appears to have the expected safety profile for a bisphosphonate that is used in 
patients  with  advanced  cancer.  Renal  safety  is  the  most  important  safety  aspect  and  this  issue  was 
discussed  extensively  during  the  assessment  and  approval  of  the  TIH  indication.  The  requested 
reassurance data on renal safety have been provided and it has been documented that ZOMETA 4 mg 
can be safely administered with 3-4 weeks interval as an 15 minutes IV infusion.. 
The MAH committed to provide PK data (even using limited sampling) after more than 3 cycles since 
patients may be treated for more than one year.  
Based on the CPMP review of data on safety and efficacy, the CPMP considered by consensus that the 
benefit/risk profile of Zometa in the following indication: 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or 
surgery to bone, or tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in patients with advanced malignancies 
involving bone,  
Was favourable and therefore recommended the Type II variation to the terms of the marketing 
authorisation.

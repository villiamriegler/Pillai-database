SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of the available information the CHMP 
II, Labelling 
is of the opinion that the quality, the safety and the efficacy 
and PL 
of this medicinal product continues to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considers that the 
benefit/risk profile of Tasmar continues to be favourable., 
but considers that its safety profile is to be closely 
monitored for the following reasons: 
- Since the lifting of the suspension there has been a 
relatively limited exposure in Europe. The CHMP also noted 
that this is effectively the first renewal since the lifting of 
the suspension.  
- Specific measures are still in place in relation to be 
monitoring of particular safety issues including 
hepatotoxicity and NMS, also remaining submision of yearly 
PSURs 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit 
one additional renewal application in 5 years time. 
Intense urges has been added to the section 4.4 of the SPC 
on the basis of the data submitted with the renewal 
dossier.

SmPC 
Further to the assessment of the12th PSUR for Tasmar, the 
(Special warnings and Special Precautions for Use) of 
the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) 
further to CHMP recommendation following 
assessment of the 12th PSUR. In addition, section 
4.8 of the SPC has been revised in accordance to the 
SPC guideline. 
CHMP requested that the Marketing Authorisation Holder 
(MAH) updated the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SPC) to refer to the possibility of late onset hepatitis. The 
CHMP request follows the publication of a case of late onset 
hepatitis (approximately 18 months after the start of 
tolcapone treatment).

The MAH therefore applied for an update of Section 4.4 
(Special warnings and Special Precautions for Use) to 
reflect the CHMP recommendation. Additionally, section 4.8 
(Undesirable Effects) has also been updated to bring it in 
line with the latest SPC guideline on presentation of the 
information on adverse drug reactions.

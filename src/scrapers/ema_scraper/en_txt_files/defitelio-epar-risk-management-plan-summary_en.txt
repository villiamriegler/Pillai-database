Part VI  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DEFITELIO 
(DEFIBROTIDE) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Defitelio.  The RMP details important 
risks of Defitelio, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Defitelio's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Defitelio's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Defitelio should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Defitelio should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Defitelio's 
RMP. 
I 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Defitelio is authorised for the treatment of severe hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in 
haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) therapy (see SmPC for the full indication).  It 
contains defibrotide as the active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion, over two 
hours. 
II 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES 
TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS 
Important risks of Defitelio, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Defitelio's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly. The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is 
supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimise its 
risks 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Defitelio is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Defitelio are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Defitelio. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks 
The safety information in the proposed Product Information is aligned to the reference medicinal 
product. 
Important identified risk: Haemorrhage (including, but not limited to, gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, pulmonary haemorrhage and epistaxis) 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Clinical trial data 
Risk factors and risk groups  Concomitant therapies: 
 
Important identified risk: Haemorrhage (including, but not limited to, gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, pulmonary haemorrhage and epistaxis) 
Concomitant use with other medications known to cause bleeding (i.e. 
anticoagulants, antiplatelets, thrombolitics) would theoretically increase 
the risk of haemorrhage. 
Age:  
In T-IND study, the overall incidence of haemorrhagic events was 
slightly higher in adults compared to paediatrics (32.4% vs. 27.4% 
respectively). However, the incidence of pulmonary haemorrhage 
events was higher in paediatric patients compared to adults (10.0% vs. 
4.3%, respectively), with the highest incidence observed in the youngest 
paediatric subgroup (Infants/Toddlers [<2 years]: 14.8%); Children [2-
11 years]: 7.3%; Adolescents [12-16 years]: 11.2%). The results of 
multivariate analysis examining potential confounding factors or risk 
factors for pulmonary haemorrhage (i.e. age, primary disease, HSCT 
form, conditioning regimen for current HSCT, pulmonary dysfunction 
presence at study entry, including ventilator dependency, as well as 
severity of the VOD) concluded that after adjusting for other 
confounding factors, young age itself was a significant risk factor for 
pulmonary haemorrhage in patients who develop VOD after HSCT or 
chemotherapy, with the highest risk observed in the 0-2 years subgroup 
(OR=3.62) [95%Wald CI 1.951 – 6.701], 2-<12 years (OR=1.78) [95% 
Wald CI 0.971 – 3.251] and 12-16 years subgroup (OR=2.60) 
[95%Wald CI 1.262 – 5.362], compared to adults (> 16 years). The 
underlying mechanism for this observation is not fully elucidated.

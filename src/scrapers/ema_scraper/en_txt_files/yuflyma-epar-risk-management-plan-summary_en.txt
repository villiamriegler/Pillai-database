Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan
Summary of risk management plan for Yuflyma™ (Adalimumab) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  for  Yuflyma.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of Yuflyma, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Yuflyma risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Yuflyma’s  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Yuflyma should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Yuflyma  should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this  information 
including the assessment report of  the evaluation and its  plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Yuflyma’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Yuflyma  is  authorised  for  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA),  axial 
spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) – ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and axial SpA without radiographic 
evidence  of  AS,  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA),  psoriasis  (Ps),  paediatric  plaque  Ps,  hidradenitis 
suppurativa (HS) (including adolescents from 12 years of age), Crohn’s disease (CD), paediatric 
CD, ulcerative colitis (UC), paediatric UC, uveitis (UV), and paediatric UV (see SmPC for the 
full indication). It contains adalimumab as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous 
route. 
Further  information  about  the  evaluation  of  Yuflyma’s  benefits  can  be  found  in  Yuflyma’s 
EPAR, including  in its  plain-language summary,  available on the European  Medicines  Agency 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/yuflyma 
II. Risks  associated  with  the  medicine  and  activities  to  minimise  or  further
characterise the risks  
Important  risks  of  Yuflyma,  together  with  measures  to  minimise  such  risks  and  the  proposed 
studies for learning more about Yuflyma’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL
and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly; 
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  the  case  of  Yuflyma,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly  analysed,  including  Periodic  Safety  Update  Report  (PSUR)  assessment  so  that 
taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
immediate  action  can  be 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Yuflyma is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  Yuflyma  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Yuflyma. Potential risks are concerns for which 
an  association  with  the  use  of  this  medicine  is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Important identified risk: Demyelinating disorders (including multiple sclerosis [MS], 
Guillain Barré syndrome [GBS] and optic neuritis [ON]) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
TNF-antagonists including adalimumab have been associated in rare 
instances  with  new  onset  or  exacerbation  of  clinical  symptoms 
and/or  radiographic  evidence  of  central  nervous  system  (CNS) 
demyelinating  disease  including  MS  and  ON,  and  peripheral 
demyelinating disease, including GBS. 
The role that TNF plays as an immunomodulator suggests that TNF 
the  development  of  drug-induced 
blockade  may  promote 
neuropathies  by  augmenting  the  number  of  activated  peripheral  T-
cells and thereby enhance autoimmune responses by altering antigen 
presenting  cell  function,  potentiating  T–cell  receptor  signalling, 
and/or  decreasing  apoptosis  of  autoreactive  T-cells.  These 
autoreactive T-cells might also drive the maturation of B cells into 
cells  secreting  autoantibodies  to  neuronal-specific  antigens.  A 
recent  report  in  a  murine  model  of  experimental  autoimmune 
encephalomyelitis suggests that membrane TNF is neuroprotective. 
Since  TNF  inhibitors  can  neutralise  both  soluble  and  membrane 
TNF, they may remove the neuroprotection provided by membrane 
TNF. Furthermore, an increasing number of neurologic side effects 
with the use of TNF-α Blockers have been reported in the literature, 
consisting  of  central  and  peripheral  nervous  system  demyelinating 
events (Kemanetzoglou E et al., 2017).

Evidence for linking the

about 
80%  of 
adults,  PML  occurs  primarily 
PML  is  a  reported  complication  of  a  variety  of  autoimmune 
rheumatic  diseases  (ARDs)  and  is  associated  with  both  synthetic 
and  biologic  immunosuppressive  agents  (Molloy  and  Calabrese, 
2012). Although John Cunningham (JC) virus antibodies are present 
in 
in 
immunocompromised individuals and is thought to be caused by JC 
virus reactivation. As a result, PML has been reported primarily in 
patients  with  underlying  immunosuppressive  conditions  (i.e.,  HIV 
infection,  AIDS,  malignancies) 
immunosuppressive 
medications. In addition, results from a study of a national hospital 
discharge database also suggested that rheumatic diseases, including 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and RA, are associated with a 
higher  rate  of  PML  compared  to  the  background  population 
(Kothary et al., 2011). 
and 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
PML  has  also  been  reported  with  TNF  inhibitors  in  the  setting  of 
autoimmune  diseases  (Molloy  and  Calabrese,  2012).  Since,  TNF-α 
plays  a  critical  role  in  recruiting  and  activating  macrophages,  NK 
cells,  T-cells,  and  antigen  presenting  cells,  depletion  of  TNF  by 
treatment  with  TNF-α  blockade  may  facilitate  reactivation  of  JC 
virus infection and progression to PML (Sammut et al., 2016). 
Yuflyma is a biosimilar medicinal product to the reference product 
Humira® . The evidence of the above mentioned risk is derived from 
known information of Humira®  (Humira®  SmPC). 
PML  occurs  predominantly  among  severely  immunosuppressed 
patients (e.g., due to chemotherapy, or HIV/AIDS). An analysis of 
PML cases found approximately 40% of patients were aged 40 to 49 
years  and  75%  were  male.  Currently,  over  80%  of  PML  cases  are 
diagnosed in  patients with  HIV/AIDS. Prior to  the era of HIV and 
AIDS,  more  than  60%  of  PML  cases  were  seen  in  patients  with 
system.  Other 
malignancies  of 
immunosuppressive  conditions 
that  put  patients  at  risk  of 
developing PML include malignancies, organ transplants, and some 
rheumatic diseases.

Two cases (Mahévas T et al., 2015, Nwafo N, 2018) have reported 
an association between RPLS and adalimumab. RPLS has also been 
reported  in  subjects  treated  with  other  medicines  similar  to 
adalimumab  (Kastrup  and  Diene,r  2008,  Zamvar  et  al.,  2008,

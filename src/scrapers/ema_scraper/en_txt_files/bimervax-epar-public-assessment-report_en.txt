1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant HIPRA HUMAN HEALTH SLU submitted on 21 March 2023 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for COVID-19 Vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted), through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point <1> <3> <4> 
of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon 
by the EMA/CHMP on 16 December 2021.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
‘BIMERVAX is indicated as a booster for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16  years 
of age and older who have previously received a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations’. 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
1.3.  Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0465/2022 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0465/2022 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
1.4.2.  New active substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance SARS-CoV-2 virus recombinant spike (S) protein receptor 
binding domain (RBD) fusion heterodimer – B.1.351-B.1.1.7 strains contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent 
of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
1.5.  Scientific advice 
The applicant received the following Scientific advice on the development relevant for the indication

The Scientific advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical, and clinical aspects: 
•  Structure of the eCTD Module 3; quality development to support Phase 3 studies and MAA  
•  Overall approach to bioanalytical method validation to support phase 3 trial and MAA 
•  Characterisation and nonclinical package for the adjuvant to support MAA 
•  Approach to presenting the environmental risk assessment for MAA 
•  Non-clinical development strategy: design of the developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) 
studies to support MAA; timing of DART studies with respect to phase 3 and inclusion of pregnant 
women in phase 3 studies; immunogenicity analysis waiver in DART studies 
• 
Immunobridging strategy; design of the respective studies; comparator; selection of endpoints; 
non inferiority margin; population; safety database; RMP 
Scientific advice compliance 
Study HH-2: Design and conduct of the study were compliant to the scientific advice 
(EMA/SA/0000066056) 
Study HH-5: Design and conduct were partially compliant to the scientific advice EMA/SA/0000066056 
and the Follow-up advice EMA/SA/0000080295 
•  Study HH-5 was designed as an uncontrolled study and the Comirnaty arm of Study HH-2 was 
planned to be used as a non-randomised control to the Study HH-5 population, all of those 
boostered with Bimervax. According to EMA, this approach raised some methodological 
concerns. 
•  EMA proposal on inclusion of patients primed with adenovirus vaccines or patients with 
heterologous priming was adopted by the Applicant in Study HH-5 
•  EMA proposed around a 3000-subject safety population (Safety data set) as a minimum. The 
applicant just reached this minimal requirement.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of cases of 
viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020, the pathogen causing this 
atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then, the virus has spread globally. 
On 30 January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International 
Concern and on 11 March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to 
control the outbreak. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors  
As of 21 March 2023, there have been over 761 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
globally with approximately 6.8 million deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19) as registered by WHO (https://covid19.who.int/). The majority of infections result 
in asymptomatic or mild disease with full recovery.   
Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are 
considered risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. Other risk factors include organ 
transplantation and chromosomal abnormalities. Increasing age is another risk factor for severe 
disease and death due to COVID-19. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA 
segment. It is enveloped and the virions are 50–200 nanometres in diameter. Like other 
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M 
(membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins.  
The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity 
and transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and 
fuse with the membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin 
converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit 
facilitates fusion with the cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine 
development because it was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits 
an immune response that prevents infection in animals. 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 13/177 
 
 
 
 
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins, and it has close genetic similarity to bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020 and the virus belongs to the beta-
coronaviruses. 
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. The median 
incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
As for all viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus will constantly change through mutation and, indeed, many 
variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with different sets of mutations have been observed worldwide. 
While most emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants will not have a significant impact on the spread of the 
virus, some mutations or combinations of mutations may provide the virus with a selective advantage, 
such as increased transmissibility or the ability to evade the host immune response. These variants 
could increase the risk posed by SARS-CoV-2 to human health and are considered variants of concern 
(VoC). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. The median 
incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
The severity of COVID-19 disease varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no 
symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases 
typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six 
weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged 
from two to eight weeks.  
Studies among hospitalised patients have found that high SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with 
worse outcomes, including increased mortality rates (Magleby, 2020) (Westblade, 2020). Community-
based studies in non-hospitalised patients show symptomatic patients have higher viral load across 
both adults and children compared to asymptomatic individuals (Chung, 2021). 
Assessment report

The gold standard method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test 
detects RNA but not infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. 
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or 
sputum sample. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The management of COVID-19 cases has developed since the start of the pandemic, and includes 
supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital 
organs.  
Treatment of hospitalised patients encompass anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone, 
targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy such as Veklury 
(remdesivir, EMEA/H/C/005622) or Paxlovid, that can be used in the outpatient setting (PF-
07321332/ritonavir, EMEA/H/C/005973).  
Monoclonal antibodies and notably bi-therapies to overcome potential escape by VOC with mutations 
on spike are perceived as of potential value. This was particularly true for immunocompromised 
individuals especially where vaccines might not induce adequate immune response in those patients of 
particular medical need. Thus, recently, four monoclonal antibodies Ronapreve 
(casirivimab/imdevimab, EMEA/H/C/005814), Regkirona (regdanvimab, EMEA/H/C/005854), Xevudy 
(sotrovimab, EMEA/H/C/005676) and Evusheld (tixagevimab /cilgavimab, EMEA/H/C/005788) have 
been authorised for the treatment of COVID-19 disease in individuals who do not require supplemental 
oxygen and who are at increased risk of their disease becoming severe. In the case of Ronapreve, it is 
also authorised for prevention of COVID-19, and Evusheld also for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-
19. 
Other products have been repurposed to be used for the treatment of COVID-19, such as Kineret 
(anakinra, EMEA/H/C/000363) in adult patients with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- 
or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure determined by plasma 
concentration of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR)≥6 ng/ml; and RoActemra 
(tocilizumab, EMEA/H/C/000955) in adults who are receiving systemic corticosteroids and require 
supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. 
Additionally, there are 7 approved vaccines for active immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 aiming to 
prevent COVID-19 disease: Comirnaty (EMEA/H/C/005735), Spikevax (EMEA/H/C/005791), Vaxzevria 
(EMEA/H/C/005675), Jcovden (EMEA/H/C/005737), Nuvaxovid (EMEA/H/C/005808) , COVID-19 
Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva (EMEA/H/C/006019) and VidPrevtyn Beta 
(EMEA/H/C/005754). The mRNA vaccines include in their marketing authorisation adapted Omicron 
vaccines. 
2.2.  About the product 
BIMERVAX (SARS-CoV-2 virus recombinant spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fusion 
heterodimer – B.1.351-B.1.1.7 strains) is intended as a booster for active immunisation to prevent 
COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older who have previously received a mRNA COVID-19 
vaccine. A single injection of 40 µg dosage of the vaccine is intended to be used. The vaccine contains 
a SARS-CoV-2 virus recombinant protein RBD fusion heterodimer – B.1.351 (Beta) -B.1.1.7 (alpha) 
strains. 
The vaccine is formulated in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution adjuvanted with SQBA 
adjuvant. The SQBA adjuvant facilitates activation of the cells of the innate immune system, which 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023

enhances the magnitude of the S protein RBD-specific immune response. The recombinant spike 
protein RBD domains of SARS-CoV-2 are recognised by immune cells as a foreign antigen and elicit 
neutralising antibody and cellular responses which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. 
Neutralizing antibodies against the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 prevent RBD binding to its cellular 
target ACE2, thus blocking membrane fusion and viral infection. Moreover, BIMERVAX vaccine induces 
antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with a Th1 response. 
A booster dose of BIMERVAX should be given intramuscularly at least 6 months after completion of the 
primary series with a mRNA vaccine. 
Throughout this document, the product is referred to as Bimervax or PHH-1V.  
2.3.  Quality aspects

80, sorbitan trioleate, sodium citrate, citric acid monohydrate and water for injections.  
The finished product is supplied in one pack size of ten multidose vials, each vial containing ten doses 
of 0.5 mL. 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
The active substance (antigen) of the PHH-1V vaccine is SARS-CoV-2 virus recombinant spike (S) 
protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fusion heterodimer comprising B.1.351-B.1.1.7 strains. The 
spike protein has 1273 amino acids, and the RBD domain corresponds to the consensus sequence from 
amino acid 319 to 541. Specifically, from position 437 to 508 there is the receptor binding motif, which 
is the region of the RBD that interacts directly with the ACE2 receptor.  
Except for the nature of the bond and the number of amino acids at the C-terminal, the PHH-1 and 
PHH-1V immunogen proteins have a high degree of equivalence at the conformational and structural 
level. 
This recombinant subunit antigen is a fusion (single polypeptide) dimeric RBD antigen that contains 
two monomers, a first monomer comprising the amino acid sequence of positions 319 to 537 of SARS-
CoV- 2 Spike protein RBD monomer derived from the B.1.351 variant (South African SARS-CoV-2), 
and it is followed by the amino acid sequence of positions 319 to 537 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 
RBD monomer derived from the B.1.1.7 variant (United Kingdom SARS-CoV-2) as the second 
monomer. The reference sequence is Uniprot P0DTC2 (D614G strain -Hu-1).

Figure 1. Structure of the B.1.351 (South Africa) - B.1.1.7 (UK) dimer receptor binding 
domain (RBD) immunogen of PHH-1V 
The molecular weight of the RBD is around 57kDa and variable N-glycan structures are observed. 
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used for the determination of the affinity between Human ACE2 
protein and the protein from Process 4. The affinity binding constant between Human ACE2 protein and 
the protein is 0.110 nM. 
The immunogenicity of RBD has been demonstrated by its ability to elicit neutralising antibodies 
(NAbs) against the virus without evident antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or vaccine-
associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) effects. 
At the beginning of the development of this vaccine, the candidate antigen was a recombinant protein 
whose sequence was that of a homodimer of the D614G receptor binding domain (RBD) (referred to as 
PHH-1). However, due to the rapid emergence and spread of new variants around the world, HIPRA 
decided to adapt to the new pandemic situation by developing a new antigen candidate (based on the 
same CHO cell platform technology as the vaccine) aimed at conferring protection against these new 
variants.  
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation, and process controls 
Manufacturers and contract laboratories 
The active substance (AS) is manufactured, tested and released at Laboratorios Hipra, S.A. Amer 
(Girona), Spain, in accordance with the good manufacturing practice (GMP). All the manufacturing 
sites involved in the manufacture of the active substance are appropriately authorised and hold valid 
GMP certification. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The PHH-1V active substance is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and the 
manufacturing process is divided into upstream and downstream process. 
The upstream process consists of several expansion steps in cell culture from the Working Cell bank 
(WCB) to the final culture in a bioreactor. Samples are taken to carry out in-process controls (IPCs). In 
accordance with ICH Q5A (R1), unprocessed bulk should be subjected on a routine basis to detection 
of extraneous agents, mycoplasma, minute virus of mice and retrovirus. Therefore, in vitro screening 
tests, using several cell lines should be used. The pre-harvest cell culture was not routinely tested for 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 17/177 
 
 
 
 
 
mycoplasma and adventitious virus. Consequently, this issue was initially raised as part of a Major 
Objection on viral safety. 
The initial approach proposed by the applicant was not endorsed as all batches should be fully tested. 
This safety requirement was finally accepted by the applicant, the testing introduced, and the Major 
Objection was considered resolved. 
The downstream process for purification of the active substance includes a clarification step followed 
sequentially by concentration and diafiltration steps, chromatography, viral inactivation, precipitation, 
chromatography, concentration and diafiltration, viral clearance by nanofiltration and final sterile 
filtration. The active substance batches are filled into sterile bags and stored at the recommended 
temperature. No reprocessing during the manufacturing process of the active substance was described.  
The flow charts and a narrative description of the manufacturing process were provided. Nonetheless, 
the initial description of the active substance manufacturing process was incomplete and insufficient. 
The active substance manufacturing process was described based on a very preliminary (“research-
grade”) version where many IPCs were proposed without acceptance criteria. The proposed control 
strategy also did not focus on critical quality attributes (CQAs) and was considered largely insufficient. 
IPCs were mixed up with critical material attributes, critical and non-critical process parameters (PP) 
and operating ranges. Most specified acceptance ranges were very broad and were not justified. The 
qualified operating ranges were not indicated. It was also unclear why individual parameters even 
though seen as critical had extremely broad acceptance ranges.  
Critical product quality attributes were not controlled at all throughout the whole manufacturing 
process. Many critical process parameters (CPP) or holding times were not considered. Thus, a Major 
Objection on the control strategy (as further discussed also in the section control of critical steps and 
intermediates) was raised. The applicant was requested to completely revise its AS and FP control 
strategy based on the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) and identify AS and FP CQAs, and to justify 
how CPPs and IPCs and their ranges had been established. A clear and unambiguous description of the 
process control strategy was requested for further assessment.  
With the responses all critical and key process parameters (CPP and KPP, respectively) and selected 
non-key process parameters (non-KPP) of the active substance upstream and downstream processes 
were discussed and justified. For the process parameters, ranges and criticality were also provided. 
The initial acceptance criteria were further tightened taking into account clinical data and data from all 
commercial AS batches available. Considering all data provided for the active substance, these new 
proposed limits are regarded as suitable in order to guarantee the quality attributes. 
Some additional specifications were proposed for unprocessed bulks with acceptable acceptance limits 
and the compliance of the batches manufactured was demonstrated. 
The updated control strategy designed for PHH-1V active substance manufacture takes into account 
the QTPP and the defined CQAs in order to assure that the final active substance meets the desired 
quality and the Major Objection on control strategy was considered resolved. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials, reagents and solvents: 
Raw materials used for the cell culture and purification process are listed together with their quality 
standard (in-house, Ph. Eur., USP/NF) and their intended use. Non-compendial materials are identified 
but in-house specifications were initially not provided but were further presented with the responses to 
the list of questions. For all critical raw materials such as cell culture media, chromatographic resins 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023

and filters, and the filters casettes for concentration and diafiltration, acceptance criteria have been 
adequately provided. 
Source, History and Generation of the cell Substrate: 
A stable cell line of genetically engineered CHO cells was established under non-GMP conditions. The 
master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) were established and qualified under GMP 
conditions. The MCB and WCB were tested and found free of adventitious virus, mycoplasma and are 
sterile. The genetic stability of the CHO cell line MCB, WCB and Extended Cell Bank (ECB) has been 
demonstrated and the proposed specifications for future WCBs are endorsed. 
The applicant claimed that the results obtained on the MCB and ECB (in the culture and study 
conditions performed) are comparable to each other. No infectious retrovirus activity was found in the 
MCB and ECB.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates  
IPCs for manufacturing Process 4 (commercial process) regarding the upstream and downstream 
processes were described. However, the characterisation of the active substance had not been finalised 
initially therefore, it was unclear how the Quality Target Product Profile and/or critical quality attributes 
could be set, how process qualification was performed and how CPPs and critical and non-critical in-
process controls were set. Apparently, no process data were used to define critical and non-critical 
parameters, operating ranges, and product impurities. Differences were observed when characterising 
the RBD fusion heterodimer obtained by the different manufacturing processes. In addition, most of 
the parameter ranges were extremely wide.  
The control of critical steps and intermediates section presented was unclear and ambiguous. Limits for 
critical product quality attributes that should be controlled throughout the whole manufacturing 
process, were still to be determined. Similarly, some aspects of the provided risk assessment were not 
supported such as the proposed low risk assigned to extraneous agents. Only a brief and vague 
summary was provided concerning the justification for the proposed process parameters’ ranges and 
their criticality. However, for both PPs and IPCs, it was not clear if the limits were acceptance criteria, 
normal operating range (NOR) or proven acceptable range (PAR). Therefore, it was unclear when a 
batch would be rejected. It was also unclear why individual parameters were defined as critical, when 
their acceptance ranges were extremely broad. Taken together, serious deficiencies related to the 
manufacturing control strategy of the active substance were initially identified (Major Objection). 
With the responses, the control strategy of the active substance manufacturing process was 
substantially improved. PP and IPCs for commercial process for the upstream and downstream 
processes were further discussed and described taking into account the data on the QTPP and/or CQAs. 
Control of intermediates 
There are no intermediates defined for the active substance manufacturing process. Holding times 
were established.  
Process validation and/or evaluation 
Three consecutive commercial scale batches were manufactured with the proposed commercial process 
(Process 4). The initial validation was performed in accordance with Annex 13 from GMP guideline 
related to Investigational Medicinal Products. Therefore, a new validation in compliance with the 
requirements of ‘Guideline on process validation for the manufacture of biotechnology-derived active 
substances and data to be provided in the regulatory submission’ (EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014) was 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 19/177 
 
 
 
 
carried out. The validation was performed with 3 consecutive batches. It should be noted that these 
validations were performed with batches manufactured when some of the updated control strategy 
proposals currently implemented were not included or assessed in those validations. As a result of the 
recently improved control strategy with the addition of several IPCs and PPs, a complementary 
validation of the whole active substance manufacturing process is currently on-going. The validation 
protocol scheme of this new exercise was provided. The applicant’s proposal to submit additional and 
complementary data in order to update the current manufacturing process validation with the recently 
added controls of the manufacturing process is endorsed. The validation protocol should be updated in 
accordance with the revised control strategy and the updated validation results should be submitted 
within 4 months after the marketing authorisation (Recommendation 5). 
Resin and filter reusability: 
Resin lifetime verifications at industrial scale have been provided.  
Process development 
Different manufacturing process versions have been in place during development. Manufacturing of 
clinical active substance material started with process 2 which was a small-scale manufacturing 
process. Active substance material from process 2 was used to supply the phase I/IIa, first in human 
clinical trials to select the antigen dose. Process 2 was upscaled to process 3 to support the phase IIb 
pivotal efficacy trial. Further development activities led then to process 4 which was used to supply the 
extended phase IIb pivotal efficacy trial as well as the phase III extended safety and immunogenicity 
trial. Process 4 is also the intended commercial manufacturing process. Whereas a total of thirty-seven 
batches are currently available for the intended commercial process 4 only a limited number of active 
substance batches have been manufactured with the previous process versions. Five active substance 
batches were produced according to process 2, and only one batch was produced with process 3. 
A multidisciplinary Major Objection was raised on the inadequate evaluation of comparability between 
batches from different versions of the manufacturing process. Among the main concerns was that the 
analytical portfolio used to assess the impact of the manufacturing process changes on CQAs was 
considered insufficient and inadequate. Furthermore, significant differences in CQAs between the active 
substance material from the different process versions were observed but were not further discussed 
or justified. High variability was observed between different manufacturing processes. The applicant 
should have justified the acceptance criteria a priori and demonstrated that the applied methods were 
qualified for the intended purpose. Samples should have been analysed head-to-head and a sufficiently 
representative number of batches should have been used. At the end the methodological portfolio was 
considerably improved to obtain insight into product- and process-related impurities, size-variants, 
degradation products. 
These shortcomings left critical questions as to whether the safety and efficacy profile of the clinical 
batches was representative of the commercial material. Unfortunately, active substance material 
manufactured by process 2 and 3 was no longer available, therefore a full new head-to-head analytical 
comparison using an improved analytical portfolio and including a sufficient and representative number 
of batches could not be performed. To address these limitations on comparability, the applicant 
presented a holistic approach. As full confirmation of comparability through analytical studies at quality 
level alone was no longer possible, a non-clinical comparability exercise including a specific bridging 
study as well as a comparison of data from different clinical trials using batches manufactured from 
different manufacturing processes was further performed and presented. 
The comparability evaluation at quality level was primarily conducted at the active substance level 
however it included as well, a comparability discussion of the SBQA adjuvant and the final PHH-1V

vaccine derived from different process versions. Process 2 was a small-scale process which was 
upscaled to the final scale for the upstream processing whereas no changes were introduced for the 
downstream processing when proceeding from process 2 to process 3. Process 3 was further optimised 
to the final process 4, which included the implementation of certain process parameters in the 
upstream processing and an upscaling of the downstream processing. Except for the removal of a step, 
the rest of the downstream process steps are identical between process 3 and 4 following the same 
order and with adjustment only of the process parameters and volumes for bigger equipment. A 
discussion on the implemented changes in the active substance manufacturing process was further 
provided. Another aspect of the active substance comparability evaluation, i.e. a comparison of the in-
process control results, where feasible, was also presented and discussed. A comparison of 
characterisation data was also provided. A total of five batches from process 2, one batch from process 
3 and five batches from process 4 have been further characterised. A comparison of the release batch 
data of all available batches of active substance manufactured following process 2, 3 and 4 was 
performed and presented. As discussed above, the active substance material manufactured by process 
2 and 3 was no longer available, and therefore complementary analysis of process 2 and 3 batches 
versus process 4 batches with the improved/extended method panel was no longer possible. 
A retrospective evaluation of comparability based on statistically derived comparability criteria was 
performed. The raw data were provided and for the majority of the investigated quality attributes, 
scatter plots were included which made the assessment of comparability possible. For several quality 
attributes the visual assessment of the scatter plots did not indicate any significant differences. Some 
differences were noted in the quality profile when clinical active substance material was compared with 
the commercial material (oligo-saccharide structures, deamination, oxidation and charge isoforms). 
The discussion of comparability at the quality level focused on the biological relevance of the observed 
differences and their potential impact on safety and efficacy. No negative impact on the efficacy and 
safety profile of the PHH-1V vaccine is expected from these differences. This conclusion was also 
supported by the non-clinical and clinical comparison. In summary, taken together the arguments and 
justifications brought forward by the applicant were considered sufficient to solve this Major Objection 
on comparability. 
Characterisation 
The characterisation of the RBD fusion heterodimer involved a battery of physicochemical and 
biological tests using sensitive and orthogonal state-of-the-art qualified analytical methods in order to 
elucidate the primary, secondary and higher-order structure, glycosylation, purity and impurities, 
quantity and biological activity in accordance with ICH Q6B ‘Guideline on specifications: test 
procedures and acceptance criteria for biotechnological/biological products’. Furthermore, according to 
the applicant, the quality attributes of the purified antigen have been tested to confirm the identity and 
integrity of the antigen in accordance with Ph. Eur. 0784 (Products of recombinant DNA technology). 
The analytical methods used for the characterisation of active substance were listed and included:  
1) for the structural characterisation and confirmation of primary structure: (a) determination of the 
intact protein and (b) subunit MW; (c) Identity; 
2) for the structural characterisation and confirmation of carbohydrate structure: (a) N-glycan profile 
and (b) total Glycosylation; 
3) for the structural characterisation and stability of the secondary and higher-order structure: (a) 
determination of secondary and higher-order structure of the protein; and (b) determination of 
stability parameters of the protein; 
4) for physicochemical properties: (a) Product-related substances; (b) Product-related impurities and 
purity of dimeric RBD protein; and (c) Total protein content; 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 21/177 
 
 
 
5) Quantity: antigen quantification; 
6) Biological activity: (a) determination of the affinity between hACE2 protein and the protein by SPR 
and (b) by ELISA 
As requested, the applicant has determined the de-amidated and oxidized forms in the three process 
validation batches as well as in 10 commercial batches manufactured with the intended commercial 
process 4. These data indicate quite constant levels of de-amidated and oxidized forms within 
acceptable ranges and thus support the conclusion that routine control for these quality attributes is 
not required. 
Overall, the active substance was extensively characterised with orthogonal physicochemical and 
biological methods and covered the relevant products attributes. 
Impurities 
Product-related impurities: 
Product-related impurities/substances are controlled by different analytical techniques such as SEC-
HPLC, SDS-PAGE and Capillary Electrophoresis Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (CE-SDS). This approach for 
the characterisation of the active substance product-related impurities/substances was considered 
acceptable. Nonetheless, the initial resolution of SEC-HPLC, and resolution and sensitivity of SDS-PAGE 
for the detection of PHH-1V variants, AS degradation, degradation components of vaccine and AS/FP 
impurities was too low and more sensitive methods needed to be developed. The applicant was 
requested to improve these methods to obtain better resolution, identification and quantification of the 
different product related impurities (details on this Major Objection and how it was considered resolved 
are further discussed in the specifications section below). 
Process-related impurities: 
The process-related impurities are specific to the process used for the active substance manufacture 
and the host cell used (HCP). The following process-related impurities have been identified during the 
active substance manufacture: host cell proteins (HCP), which are controlled by a generic ELISA 
method and host DNA, which is determined by qPCR testing.  
The capacity of individual purification steps to reduce process-related impurities such as HCP and DNA 
have been further studied. The reduction of DNA has been demonstrated. The reduction of process-
related impurities, DNA antifoam and anti-clumping agent (ACA) impurities were addressed and 
considered acceptable. However, the HCP reduction strategy was not fully optimised. No specific step 
was developed to reduce HCP levels. The HCP reduction was insufficient and not validated, and the 
proposed HCP specification was not clinically justified by safety data (Major Objection).  A 
multidisciplinary Major Objection was raised. Thus, the applicant was asked to implement a validated 
and robust HCP reduction step.  
With the responses, the applicant improved the HCP control strategy by implementing an alternative 
generic HCP-assay with higher coverage to replace the initially proposed assay. Coverage was 
assessed by two orthogonal methods using a solid phase, HCP kit specific antibody affinity extraction 
(AAE) and image-based computer assisted evaluation of 2D-PAGE as well as LC-MS detection. The 
assessment of coverage by two orthogonal methods is supported. Thus, the CHO HCP ELISA Kit shows 
an appropriate coverage, and the proposed replacement of the initial HCP is supported. 
The new assay was validated according to ICH Q2 R1 guideline for its accuracy, precision, specificity, 
linearity, range, limit of quantitation (LoQ) and robustness, and considered suitable for its intended 
application. HCP content data from 16 batches measured by the second generic assay were presented, 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 22/177 
 
 
 
and HCP levels from commercial batches seem reproducible. The Major Objection was considered 
resolved. 
The HCP content has been qualified in clinical trials. However, no information on the HCP profile was 
given. HCPs that can be considered high-risk include those that are immunogenic, biologically active, 
or enzymatically active with the potential to degrade either product molecules or excipients used in 
formulation, and these are often difficult-to-purify. Clinical and non-clinical material was found 
representative of the commercial manufacturing process. The applicant was requested to perform an 
in-depth characterisation of the qualitative HCP profile, including a risk assessment based on the 
outcome of the qualitative HCP assessment and is acceptable post approval (Recommendation 7). 
2.3.2.3.  Specification 
The release and shelf life specifications for the active substance include appropriate general tests (for 
appearance, pH and thermal shift assay (TSA)), tests for identity, heterogeneity, purity and impurities, 
biological activity (potency), quantity, sterility and endotoxins.  
The initial proposed panel of tests did not reflect the complexity of the molecule. The proposed 
specifications for a complex, post-translationally highly modified and a relatively unstable recombinant 
protein were imprecise and incomplete and were requested to be updated. The applicant was asked to 
improve its analytical portfolio for release and shelf-life assessment including validated state of the art 
methods to assess CQAs at the active substance and finished product level, for identity, potency, 
charge-variants, glyco-variants (consistency of glycosylation regarding side occupancy, amounts and 
structures), size-variants, degradation products. 
The resolution of SEC-HPLC and resolution and sensitivity of SDS-PAGE for the detection of PHH-1V 
variants, active substance degradation, degradation components of vaccine and AS/FP impurities was 
too low and more sensitive methods were requested to be developed. With the responses it was 
agreed that the SEC-HPLC method for AS and FP had been improved and duly validated. The new 
method is now capable of adequately distinguishing pre and post-peaks. 
In relation to CE-SDS it was noted that the elution pattern in CE-SDS did not correspond to the 
expected theoretical molecular weight (MW). This needed to be thoroughly discussed and the proposed 
evaluation procedure for CE-SDS results under reducing and non-reducing conditions, for the 
assessment of the active substance and finished product needed to be further improved. This resulted 
in a Major Objection.  
To address this MO and in order to achieve better reproducibility of CE-SDS, the applicant ran 
deglycosylated samples under reduced conditions. The data of the RBD fusion heterodimer analysed by 
CE-SDS under reduced and deglycosylated conditions showed reproducible electropherograms in which 
the full-length protein(s) is the predominant structure. Overall, the method has demonstrated to be a 
relevant and useful test for active substance batch release and stability monitoring. Therefore, this new 
method has been included in the release specification and will be routinely used for assessment of new 
manufactured commercial active substance batches (Process 4) and will be included in the protocol of 
future stability studies. 
CE-SDS under reduced conditions and after deglycosylated (CE-SDS-DG-R) methods for AS and FP 
have been improved and duly validated and the Major Objection was considered resolved.  
Nevertheless, the applicant is recommended to identify the 2 apparently both active identities in the 
major peak, as well as the 3 peaks related to product degradation (Recommendation 1). For CE-
SDS-DG-R, the applicant is also recommended to revise the active substance (AS) and finished product 
(FP) CE-SDS-DG-R specifications after 15 commercial AS and FP batches have been manufactured 
(Recommendation 2).

In summary, concerning the purity and product-related impurities, 3 different orthogonal methods are 
in place (SEC-HPLC, SDS-PAGE (reduced & non-reduced), and CE-SDS (reduced and non-reduced). 
Significant improvements of these methods have been implemented; consequently, the method panel 
for control of AS and FP purity/impurity can be considered acceptable. The specification limits for 
purity/impurity testing were considered adequate and have been sufficiently justified taking clinical 
batch data into account (however, regarding CE-SDS reference is made to Recommendations 1 and 
2).  
The applicant used the same ELISA to assess AS and FP potency and identity. The relevance of the 
assay for the vaccine’s mode of action and the assay’s specificity were questioned and eventually 
confirmed by experimental data provided by the applicant (see Analytical Procedures section). 
Nevertheless, the applicant was recommended to assess selectivity between alpha- and beta-strain 
specific epitopes (see analytical procedures section) in displacement experiments (Recommendation 
6). 
Regarding potency, new tightened acceptance criteria of relative potency (RP) for the AS was finally 
proposed. Manufacturing consistency, stability results from active substance/finished product, data 
from batches used in clinical studies and the method variability were considered in the recalculation of 
the potency acceptance criteria. The currently proposed acceptance criteria for potency are considered 
acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
Biological activity by Quantitative ELISA 
The ELISA, as depicted by the applicant, recognizes two different structural epitopes of the vaccine: 
one consists of the ACE2 binding motif of the recombinant protein, and the other one of a different, not 
overlapping but most probably immunologically irrelevant epitope. It was unclear if both RBD-chains of 
the heterodimer interact differently with ACE2, and if the proposed assay is able to detect changes or 
alterations of epitopes on just one chain of the heterodimer. The applicant presented further 
experimental data which confirmed that the assay specifically detects the dimeric structure of the 
immunisation antigen and that it is able to discriminate between intact and degraded active substance. 
Results from presented immunisation studies showed a correlation between the assay and the 
vaccine’s mode of action, and the initial concern was considered resolved. The proposed ELISA might 
reflect the Mechanism of Action, but it remained unclear if the assay can discriminate between strain-
specific epitopes present on both RBD-chain binding motifs of the heterodimer. As a post-authorisation 
commitment, the applicant will also assess the specificity of the potency assay in displacement 
experiments using monoclonal alpha- and beta-strain specific antibodies (Recommendation 6). 
Quantify CHO host cell proteins 
A commercially available ELISA has been validated to quantify CHO host cell proteins. 
Purity of RBD fusion heterodimer – SDS PAGE 
SDS-PAGE is used for the determination of the purity, product-related substances/impurities and 
presence of glycosylation. 
RBD fusion heterodimer Quantification by SEC-HPLC 
The resolution and the reproducibility of the SEC-HPLC method has been improved in order to quantify 
the main peak as well as high and low molecular weights peaks. 
Concerning the purity and product-related impurities, 3 different orthogonal methods are in place 
(SEC-HPLC, SDS-PAGE (reduced & non-reduced), and CE-SDS (reduced and non-reduced). Significant 
Assessment report

improvements of these methods have been implemented and the methods have been adequately 
validated. 
In summary, the improved analytical methods panel for control of active substance can be considered 
acceptable. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial 
methods appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Reference standards 
Two process 4 batches were qualified as Primary Reference Standard (PRS) and Working Reference 
Standard (WRS). The analytical methods used to characterise structural attributes of the reference 
standard have been presented. The analysis of the batches used as Reference Standards has been 
included. The current Reference Standard has been qualified. New Reference Standard should comply 
with all tests performed at the time of AS release and with tight requirements for qualification of the 
antigen. The information provided on reference standards is acceptable. 
Batch analysis 
Results of active substance batch analyses from: 4 batches produced by process 2, 1 batch produced 
by process 3 and 37 active substance batches manufactured with the process 4 (commercial process) 
were provided. The results complied with the specification that was in-force at the time of their release 
and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
2.3.2.4.  Stability 
A shelf-life of six months was initially claimed for the active substance when stored at 2 ºC – 8 ºC. 
Stability data have been provided from the ongoing long-term ICH stability studies at 5°C ± 3°C and 
from the completed accelerated stability studies at 25°C ± 2°C. At this time, 9-months stability data at 
long-term conditions and 6-months stability data at accelerated conditions are available for the first 
ICH stability studies. This stability study included the Process 4 batches considered representative for 
the intended commercial process. An extractable study has been performed in order to detect and 
identify extractables substances which could be released from the primary packaging system. The 
levels of impurities identified in the primary packaging system extracts did not exceed the proposed 
limits in any case during the extractable study. Thus, there are no concerns with regard to toxicity 
hazard from these impurities released from the primary packaging system.  
Unfortunately, all stability data were still generated with the “old” portfolio of the analytical methods 
which was not considered suitable for monitoring the stability of this complex recombinant protein (as 
discussed in the sections above). Consequently, the value of this stability data which was generated 
with a highly insufficient method panel was questionable as a basis for the shelf-life claim and thus this 
data was considered as supportive only.  
The results from this initial stability study showed that all tested parameters remained within the 
established acceptance criteria (at that time) after 6 months of storage at 5ºC ± 3ºC whereas certain 
outliers were observed after 9 months storage. A decrease in purity and a concomitant increase of 
product-related substances/impurities was observed. Similar but more pronounced trends were 
observed when stored at accelerated (25°C ± 2°C) conditions with out of specification values already, 
after storage for 1 month. These changes in purity/impurity profile were accompanied by a drop in the 
biological activity of the RBD fusion heterodimer, although with values still within the acceptance 
criteria after three months of storage at 25°C ± 2°C. These data indicate that this protein seems to be 
highly susceptible to product degradation and this certainly limits the long-term storage of the active 
substance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 25/177 
 
 
 
More recently, a new ICH stability studies at long-term (5°C ± 3°C) and at accelerated (25°C ± 2°C) 
conditions have been initiated. Three manufacturing-scale production PHH-1V active substance batches 
were included in this study. So far, stability data up to 6-months at both long-term and accelerated 
conditions are available for these new ICH stability studies. The stability results indicate a certain 
susceptibility of this heterodimer to degradation. Based on the results provided from these stability 
studies, a maximum shelf-life claim of 5 months can be supported at this point in time.  
In conclusion, based on the results from the aforementioned stability studies the claimed active 
substance shelf life of 5 months when stored at 2 ºC – 8 ºC is considered acceptable.  
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product - COVID-19 Vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted), 40 µg/dose, emulsion for injection 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description and composition of the finished product 
One dose (0.5 mL) of the finished product contains 40 micrograms (µg) of SARS-CoV-2 virus 
recombinant spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fusion heterodimer, comprising  
B.1.351-B.1.1.7 strains, adjuvanted with SQBA. Other ingredients are disodium phosphate 
dodecahydrate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and water for 
injections; SQBA adjuvant containing squalene, polysorbate 80, sorbitan trioleate, sodium citrate, citric 
acid monohydrate and water for injections. All excipients comply with European Pharmacopoeia 
monographs.  
The finished product (FP) is formulated with an SBQA oil-in-water adjuvant. The addition of an 
adjuvant to the composition of Bimervax, was considered necessary in order to generate a sufficient 
immune response to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 16 years of age and older 
following primary immunisation with an mRNA vaccine. Based on the results of the non-clinical studies 
conducted in mice, the adjuvant selected was SBQA, an oil-in water adjuvant consisting of squalene 
(9.75 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.18 mg), sorbitan trioleate (1.18 mg), sodium citrate (0.66 mg), citric 
acid (0.04 mg) and water for injections per dose of 0.5 mL. 
The vaccine is supplied as 10 doses of vaccine per vial. An overfill is carried out to ensure that the 
correct volume can be withdrawn from the vials for all ten 0.5 ml doses. 
The container closure system is a clear, sterilised Type I colourless 5 mL glass vial, stoppered with a 
sterilised Type I elastomeric stopper and an aluminium seal fitted with a plastic flip-off cap. Both 
bromobutyl or chlorobutyl stoppers can be used. These bromobutyl or chlorobutyl stoppers are 
classified as Type I rubber stoppers and comply with the specifications of Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. Suppliers of 
the primary packaging material need to be mentioned in the dossier and replacement or addition of a 
supplier should be handled via an appropriate variation (Recommendation 8). 
The finished product is supplied in one pack size of ten multidose vials.  
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a 40 μg/dose SARS-CoV-2 virus recombinant spike (S) protein RBD fusion 
heterodimer (B.1.351-B.1.1.7 strains), adjuvanted vaccine presented as a sterile, preservative-free 
white homogeneous emulsion for injection for intramuscular use. The active substance is formulated 
with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and with SQBA adjuvant, that is an oil-in-water 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 26/177 
 
 
 
 
adjuvant consisting of squalene (9.75 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.18 mg), sorbitan trioleate (1.18 mg), 
sodium citrate (0.66 mg), citric acid (0.04 mg) and water for injections per dose of 0.5 mL.  
Three dose levels of the recombinant RBD fusion dimer antigen were tested in the first-in human (FIH) 
randomised, controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, multicentre Phase I/IIa clinical trial HIPRA-
HH-1 conducted in 30 adult healthy volunteers distributed in three cohorts of ascending dose levels of 
antigen: 10 μg, 20 μg and 40 μg. Higher levels of binding antibodies were observed in subjects 
vaccinated with PHH-1V vaccine with an antigen dose of 40 μg, and a similar trend was observed for 
the levels of neutralising antibodies and T-cell response. These observations, together with the good 
safety and tolerability obtained for this higher antigen dose in terms of both local and systemic effects, 
supported the selection of PHH-1V with an antigen dose of 40 μg for further clinical development. 
Based on available interim results of the HIPRA-HH-2Phase IIb trial, the immunogenicity and safety of 
the selected dose of 40 μg/dose and PHH-1V formulation against VoCs was confirmed: PHH-1V showed 
a good safety profile and induced high neutralising levels against the D614G strain VoC and an 
improved immunogenicity response against Beta and Omicron variants compared to the comparator 
group. The Delta variant showed a non-inferior response to Comirnaty. 
The adjuvant selected for Bimervax finished product formulation is an SQBA adjuvant. The adjuvant 
fraction in PHH-1V FP represents about a 50 % v/v of the final composition of the vaccine. The buffer 
selected for PHH-1V FP formulation is PBS solution.  
The finished product material manufactured by previous manufacturing process 1, 2 and 3 was no 
longer available, which precluded a full new head-to-head analytical comparison using an improved 
analytical portfolio. No formal comparability study was performed to assess the impact on quality, 
efficacy and safety of the changes introduced in the manufacturing process of the PHH-1V FP due to 
the upscaling. Nonetheless, the applicant has conducted a retrospective analysis by comparison of all 
data available from material derived by the different processes. A comparability evaluation of the PHH-
1V FP was primarily based on a comparison of batch release data. Data of all controlled parameters 
showed similar values within the three different manufacturing processes or low variability that can be 
associated with the inherent variability of the concerned analytical methods. A syringe extraction study 
to simulate the withdrawal of ten vaccine doses as the worst case has been conducted.  
An in-use shelf life of 6 hours for PHH-1V vaccine at 2 ºC-8 ºC from the time of first needle puncture to 
administration has been demonstrated. 
Finished Medicinal Product - SQBA adjuvant, emulsion for injection 
Description and composition of the finished product 
The SQBA adjuvant for Bimervax is described as an oil-in water emulsion for intramuscular use 
containing squalene as the internal oil phase, sodium citrate-citric acid buffer as the external aqueous 
phase and polysorbate 80 and sorbitan trioleate as emulsifiers.  
Pharmaceutical development 
The SQBA adjuvant is a squalene-based adjuvant included in the formulation of Bimervax, whose 
qualitative and quantitative composition (9.75 mg squalene; 1.175 mg polysorbate-80; 1.175 mg 
sorbitan trioleate; 0.66 mg sodium citrate and 0.04 mg citric acid monohydrate per vaccine dose).  
All components are compendial substances. No formal comparability of the SQBA adjuvant derived 
from a small scale (process 1) and the commercial scale (process 2) was performed. A summary of 
differences in the manufacturing process versions for the SQBA adjuvant was included and it is agreed 
that these differences are not expected to lead to any changes in the quality profile of the SQBA 
adjuvant. In addition, a statistical comparison of variability of SQBA adjuvant manufacturing process 1 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 27/177 
 
 
 
versus process 2 has been performed. Results confirm the comparability of both processes as all 
parameters analysed for SQBA adjuvant batches produced with either Process 1 or 2 are within the 
mean ± 3SD. 
Manufacturers 
Appropriate valid GMP certificates have been provided for the manufacturer of the SQBA adjuvant. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The SQBA adjuvant is manufactured using standard manufacturing activities such as mixing, sterilising 
filtration, homogenization, and filtration. There is neither filling, stoppering nor storage of the SQBA 
adjuvant as the manufacturing process of Bimervax FP is designed as a continuous process.  
Similarly to the manufacturing control strategy of the active substance discussed in the active 
substance section, the manufacturing control strategy for the SQBA adjuvant has been revised based 
on QTTP and CQAs to demonstrate that the manufacturing process is robust and capable of 
consistently leading to SQBA adjuvant with the defined quality attributes. New IPCs have been 
introduced and results of IPCs from new batches manufactured with this updated control strategy were 
submitted. The data provided demonstrated that the SQBA manufacturing process is robust and 
reproducible. 
Process validation and/or evaluation 
Initially, the applicant provided only lists of critical steps, process parameters and IPCs. No information 
was provided on CQAs, if and how they were identified, and how different manufacturing steps could 
impact on them. Even the composition of the adjuvant and its stability throughout the manufacturing 
process were not considered critical. IPCs were listed, but it was not explained how they are able to 
control quality of the finished product. Proposed acceptance ranges for process parameters and IPCs 
were extremely broad.  
With the responses the proposed acceptance ranges for process parameters and IPCs have been 
tightened and are acceptable. The data presented is sufficient to confirm that the manufacturing 
process is able to deliver adjuvant with consistent quality. 
Specification 
The specifications for the SQBA adjuvant used in the production of Bimervax include general tests for 
appearance, pH, viscosity, particle size, squalene identification, squalene content, total emulsifying 
agents, purity/impurities, sterility and endotoxins. 
The proposed specifications for the SQBA are considered acceptable. The characterisation of impurities 
includes the carbonyl content and potential extractables and leachables from the sterile single-use bag 
(biocontainer). The components of the SQBA adjuvant namely squalene, polysorbate 80 and sorbitan 
trioleate contain alcohols and/or double bounds in their structures that can be oxidized to carbonyl 
groups (C=O) forming oxidation products and therefore are controlled at the level of the SQBA 
adjuvant as well as at the level of the vaccine finished product. This is endorsed. 
Reference standards 
For squalene, polysorbate 80 and trioleate information on primary reference standards, storage and 
stability monitoring have been provided and is acceptable.

Container closure 
SQBA adjuvant is packed in sterile single-use bag until its use for Bimervax finished product 
production. 
Stability 
A maximum holding time in the sterile single-use bag until its use for PHH-1V vaccine production has 
been demonstrated. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
Valid GMP certificates were provided for the different sites involved in the manufacturing of the finished 
product.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Bimervax, COVID-19 vaccine (PHH-1V) is manufactured using standard manufacturing steps such as 
mixing and homogenisation of vaccine components, sterilising filtration, aseptic filling, capping, 
labelling and secondary packaging.  
Briefly, the active substance RBD fusion heterodimer is added to the container containing the SQBA 
adjuvant and stirred until complete homogenisation. In parallel, the buffer solution is prepared by 
dissolving the components, stirred until complete homogenisation, sterile filtered and the filtrate 
collected on the container containing the mixture of antigen and adjuvant. The emulsion is further 
homogenised to obtain the vaccine bulk. No reprocessing activities are considered for the finished 
product production.  
Process validation and/or evaluation 
The manufacturing process of the Bimervax finished product is carried out under aseptic conditions. 
Validation studies on the manufacturing process of PHH-1V vaccine with have demonstrated that the 
PHH-1V finished product manufacturing process is robust and capable of consistently leading to a PHH-
1V FP vaccine that complies with the defined quality specifications. 
The following points have been considered with the scope of the validation of PHH-1V FP 
manufacturing process: 
• Media fills for validation of aseptic processing 
• Validation of the PHH-1V manufacturing process 
• Filter validations for filters used during PHH-1V manufacturing process 
• Validation of bioburden testing 
• Validation of sterility testing 
• Validation of bacterial endotoxins testing 
• Shipping validation studies 
It should be noted that these validation studies were performed before the implementation of the 
updated control strategy of PHH-1V FP and SQBA adjuvant and hence, some of the control strategy 
proposals currently implemented were not included or assessed in those validations. Therefore, the 
applicant has informed that, as a result of the recently improved control strategy including the addition 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 29/177 
 
 
 
of several IPCs and PPs, a complementary validation of the whole manufacturing process is currently 
on-going. This is accepted. 
2.3.3.3.  Product specification 
The release and shelf-life specifications for the finished product include appropriate general tests, tests 
for identity, heterogeneity, purity and impurities, biological activity (potency), quantity, sterility, 
endotoxins, container closure integrity test, visible and sub-visible particles and extractable volume. 
A Major Objection was raised on the analytical portfolio applied to control the active substance and 
finished product. The applicant was asked to improve its analytical portfolio for release and shelf-life 
assessment to include validated state of the art methods to assess CQAs at the finished product levels, 
namely identity, potency, charge-variants, glyco-variants (consistency of glycosylation regarding side 
occupancy, amounts and structures), size-variants, degradation products and excipients (polysorbate 
80 and sorbitan trioleate at the FP level). As discussed in the active substance section, the applicant 
improved the analytical portfolio used for AS and FP release and shelf-life determination. The 
methodological portfolio has been updated to control all the CQAs. Clinical material and especially its 
impurity profile were tested against the specifications valid at the time point of release by applying not 
fully validated methods, and thus not by applying the improved methodological portfolio. The following 
methods have been developed, validated and implemented to improve control of PHH-1V finished 
product at release and shelf-life: 
1. Identification of RBD fusion heterodimer by peptide mapping using RP-HPLC-UV. 
2. Control of product related substances and impurities using three different orthogonal 
methods: SDS-PAGE, CE-SDS and SEC-HPLC. 
3. Control of charge variants by capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF). 
4. Thermal shift analysis (TSA) to confirm the intactness and proper structure of the RBD 
fusion heterodimer. 
5. Determination of carbonyl content using a potentiometric method as indicator of oxidative 
processes of the components of the adjuvant. 
6. Control of excipients as total emulsifying agents (polysorbate 80 (PS80) and sorbitan 
trioleate).  
Peptide mapping was added as a method for assessment of identity, in combination with the already 
proposed methods ELISA and SEC-HPLC. This was endorsed, and AS and FP identity assessment is 
considered acceptable. The methodological portfolio to assess AS and PF purity, variants and 
impurities was improved by adding to the already proposed methodological portfolio SDS-PAGE under 
reducing conditions, charge variants by cIEF, and CE-SDS under reducing and non- reducing 
conditions.  
The applicant implemented a thermal shift assay (TSA) to overcome potential limitations of the 
described ELISA to assess AS and FP potency. The proposed TSA assay was not considered a 
quantitative assay, nor it is specific for the mechanism of action of the vaccine. Thus, it did not 
contribute to the assessment of potency, but it would complement the methodological portfolio used 
to assess AS and FP integrity and its shelf-life. Thus, the implementation of the TSA assay as a 
supplementary, general test was proposed by the applicant to control AS and FP purity for release and 
shelf-life determination. A TSA has been included as general test at release and shelf-life specification 
of the AS and FP in order to confirm the correct structure of the heterodimer.  
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 30/177 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding potency, new tightened acceptance criteria of RP for the FP were proposed. Manufacturing 
consistency, stability results from active substance/finished product, data from batches used in clinical 
studies and the method variability were considered in the recalculation of the potency acceptance 
criteria. The currently proposed acceptance criteria for potency are considered acceptable. 
Carbonyl content as a stability indicating parameter was only being determined in the adjuvant and for 
the finished product at release and was not being assessed for shelf-life determination. Following 
responses, the carbonyl content is currently included in the specifications for release and shelf life. All 
the stability results obtained from three finished product batches show that the carbonyl content in 
finished product is below the acceptance limit. This is acceptable. 
Initially the applicant did not have an analytical method able to separately get insight into PS80 and 
sorbitan trioleate concentrations in the adjuvant and at finished product level. The proposal to 
quantify both compounds as IPC’s before being mixed together and filtrated, and the control of 
combined levels in the finished product was not considered acceptable, especially because further 
manipulation steps could affect PS80 and sorbitan trioleate levels in the finished product differently. 
The applicant provided finished product release and shelf-life data from a suitable number of 
representative FP batches and committed to substitute the current method for the combined 
assessment of PS80 and sorbitan trioleate by analytical method(s) enabling separate quantification of 
PS80 and sorbitan trioleate. This was considered acceptable (Recommendation 4). 
In compliance with applicable regulations, a risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the PHH-1V finished product has been conducted considering all suspected and actual root 
causes in line with the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the 
CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 
5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on 
the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. 
Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
In addition, elemental impurities risk assessment has been performed in accordance with ICH Q3D 
Guideline for Elemental Impurities. According to the results obtained in this evaluation, the predicted 
levels of elemental impurities under evaluation are below their control threshold. Therefore, it is not 
necessary to implement additional actions to ensure the PDE is not exceeded. The information on the 
control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Analytical methods 
The presented set of analytical methods was considered sufficient to control the FP. Performance of the 
compendial methods in the respective FP-matrix was confirmed, and validation of product and process 
specific analytical methods sufficiently addressed in this and in the respective AS and adjuvant sections 
of the dossier. 
An overview of the analytical procedures used for the Bimervax FP product as well as validation data 
for the analytical procedures have been provided. Method validation has been described for all non-
compendial methods. The following analytical procedures have not been validated due to either being 
regarded as a compendial test (i.e., pH, osmolality, visible particles, extractable volume) or a 
technically simple analytical method (i.e., appearance, viscosity, particle size). Hence, no validation of 
the aforementioned analytical procedures is regarded as necessary. Nonetheless, it should be noted 
that although the general tests intended for the microbiological control (i.e., sterility and bacterial 
endotoxins) of the finished product are compendial tests, respective validation data were provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 31/177 
 
 
 
 
 
The suitability and applicability of the proposed compendial methods was confirmed and established 
with the FP matrix.  
Batch analysis 
Thirteen finished product batches have been manufactured at the commercial site and at the proposed 
commercial scale according to the commercial manufacturing Process 4 and filled in the proposed 
container closure system. The batch results provided are within the specifications and confirm the 
consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference standards 
Reference standards used for the control of squalene in the Bimervax finished product are the same 
standards used for the control of the adjuvant batches. 
The same reference antigen standard used for the control of the active substance is used for the 
determination of recombinant protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fusion heterodimer and its 
biological activity in the Bimervax vaccine. 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A shelf life of 1 year when stored at 2°C – 8°C, protected from light, is claimed for the Bimervax 
finished product. 
HIPRA has initiated an ICH stability study with primary batches fully representative of the 
manufacturing-scale production of Bimervax finished product. Long-term stability studies at 5°C ± 3°C 
are ongoing and accelerated stability studies at 25°C ± 2°C / 60% ± 5% RH have been completed with 
three GMP FP batches manufactured at the proposed commercial scale and in the proposed commercial 
manufacturing site and packaged in the proposed commercial container closure system.  
12 months data from the ongoing ICH long-term and accelerated stability studies with three finished 
product lots representing the final commercial material are available. All results from the long-term 
stability study are within the acceptance criteria. The analytical portfolio for the finished product 
specifications has been recently extended. In this context, finished product batches under long-term 
stability have been tested with the complete validated analytical portfolio at after 9, 10, 11 and 12 
months storage for two batches and after 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 month storage for the third one.  
Direct exposure to Ultraviolet (UV) light led to degradation of the protein; thus, protection from light is 
required for the storage of the finished product. 
Based on the data a shelf-life claim of 1 year when stored at long-term storage condition 2°C – 8°C 
can be agreed. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 6 hours at 2°C – 8°C 
from the time of first needle puncture. From a microbiological point of view, after first opening (first 
needle puncture), the vaccine should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage 
times and conditions are the responsibility of the user.   
Of note, the applicant missed to set the finished product vials in the inverted position in the first 
primary stability studies. A new stability study with finished product batches in the inverted position 
has been started very recently; however, currently no stability data from vials stored in the inverted 
position are available. Considering that the container closure components (Type I glass vials and 
rubber stoppers) comply with the respective Ph. Eur. monographs, no increased risk for the quality of 
the finished product stored in the described container closure system is expected. Nevertheless, the 
applicant is recommended to provide available stability data (including from vials stored in the inverted 
position) in a timeline of 3 months after the granting of the MA. (Recommendation 3).

2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy / Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy 
During the manufacture of the active substance, the only material that has an animal or human origin 
is the CHO cells used as starting material for the expression of the RBD protein. Apart from the CHO 
cells, none of the raw materials is of direct animal or human origin or have been produced using 
animal-origin components. Taking into account the information provided, it is concluded that the risk 
for TSE/BSE contamination do not exist or is very low. Other than the CHO cell line expressing the 
active substance and squalene (fish origin) contained in SQBA adjuvant, no animal or human derived 
materials are used in the manufacturing process of the vaccine. Therefore, there is no concern about 
TSE safety. 
Viral safety 
Master Cell Bank, Working Cell Bank (WCB) and Extended Cell Bank have been characterized. The 
protocol to establish new WCBs raise no concern. All unprocessed bulks will be tested for mycoplasma 
and adventitious viruses. This is acceptable. 
The data on viral reduction studies which were performed with 4 model viruses in duplicate runs, show 
a safety margin that is considered sufficiently reassuring of the viral safety of the product.  
In summary, the adventitious agents safety evaluation is considered acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The documentation initially included in the application dossier was overall considered to be insufficient 
to support the application for Bimervax (COVID-19 vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted)) and a number 
of Major Objections and other concerns were identified during the procedure.  
The major deficiencies identified during the procedure were summarised as follows: 
•  A first group of deficiencies related to the portfolio of the analytical methods which were 
considered insufficient for release testing of the active substance and the finished product, 
to assess its stability, and to compare products from different versions of the 
manufacturing process. The initial proposed panel of tests did not reflect the complexity of 
the molecule. The applicant only partially assessed the active substance physico-chemical 
and biological characteristics, and thus many CQAs were not adequately identified. The 
product QTPP and resulting CQAs were only taken into account very late in the 
development. Consequently, the proposed control strategy also did not focus on CQAs, and 
was largely insufficient. There was no link between the required finished product quality 
and the performance of the proposed manufacturing steps.  
• 
• 
The second group of deficiencies were related to the manufacturing control strategy of the 
active substance, the finished product and the adjuvant. The proposed strategy to also 
control the product-related variants/impurities was considered to be insufficient. During the 
procedure, the applicant was requested to implement suitable methods for the control of 
product-related variants/impurities.   
The third group of deficiencies were related to the control of viruses and host-cell proteins 
(HCP). Important virus safety measures like cell line qualification, bulk harvest testing and 
virus reduction validation were initially not in place and the manufacturing process 
(especially the downstream process) lacked the typical sequence of robust virus reduction 
steps, expected to be implemented in the manufacturing processes for biologics for human

medicines. Robust HCP reduction steps were also not in place as required. Therefore, the 
applicant was requested to prepare a risk assessment based on the outcome of the 
qualitative HCP assessment. The applicant was further asked to evaluate the potential 
impact of an induced HCP-specific immune response in light of treatment options with 
other therapeutic proteins. 
• 
The purity of the active substance, including viral safety, was not considered appropriate: 
only two chromatography steps as proposed by the applicant were insufficient for the 
active substance to reduce process related impurities and product related impurities to 
acceptable levels. The specification of acceptable impurity levels at critical steps of the 
manufacturing process, which would ensure achieving the targeted quality profile, were 
initially not defined or not assessed at all. The active substance of the vaccine is a 
recombinant protein combining in a synthetic single molecule two different variants from 
the Spike-protein RBDs. It is a complex, post-translationally highly modified and relatively 
unstable recombinant protein. Nonetheless, initially the active substance was not 
characterised in depth, and there was no follow-up on the various impurities identified 
which were classified by the applicant as non-critical without providing any (experimental 
or clinical) justification.  
• 
The proposed portfolio of active substance and finished product release and stability 
analytical methods was insufficient and many tests were not considered state of the art. 
The stability testing panel did not cover the most important quality attributes impacting on 
product safety and efficacy. The proposed potency-assay seemed only marginally related 
to the mechanism of action and its specificity/selectivity towards the RDB fusion protein 
was questionable. An adequate comparability evaluation of products manufactured by 
different versions of the manufacturing process was not possible as changes were 
implemented to critical manufacturing steps within one version of the manufacturing 
process, without any follow-up. Demonstration of comparability between processes was 
critical to ensure that the clinical data generated with previous processes can be 
considered representative of the commercial process.  
Following several rounds of questions, sufficient data was generated and additional information and 
justifications were provided. Samples from the previous manufacturing processes were not available 
and therefore a direct comparison of the different manufacturing processes was not possible. Also, as 
the product QTPP and resulting CQAs were taken into account very late in the development process, 
the applicant justified the acceptance criteria in a holistic way as follows: a comparability evaluation at 
quality level focusing on the biological relevance of the observed differences and their potential impact 
on safety and efficacy. The comparability evaluation at the quality level was amended with a non-
clinical comparability exercise including a specific bridging study as well as a comparison of data from 
different clinical trials using batches manufactured from different manufacturing processes (please 
refer to the active substance process development section for more information).  
The applicant has introduced a number of improvements to the analytical methods portfolio and 
included the following additional methods and control parameters: identification of RBD fusion 
heterodimer by peptide mapping using RP-HPLC-UV; control of product related substances and 
impurities using three different orthogonal methods: SDS-PAGE, CE-SDS and SEC-HPLC; control of 
charge variants by capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF); TSA to confirm the intactness and proper 
structure of the RBD fusion heterodimer; determination of carbonyl content using a potentiometric 
method as indicator of oxidative processes of the components of the adjuvant; control of excipients as

total emulsifying agents (polysorbate 80 (PS80) and sorbitan trioleate); Peptide mapping was added as 
a method for assessment of identity, in combination with the already proposed methods ELISA and 
SEC-HPLC. 
The introduced changes to the portfolio of active substance and finished product release and stability 
analytical methods was considered to be sufficient and now covers important quality attributes 
impacting on product safety and efficacy. The manufacturing control strategy of the active substance, 
the finished product and the adjuvant is now considered acceptable. With the responses, the control 
strategy of the active substance manufacturing process was substantially improved. PP and IPCs for 
Process 4 (commercial process) for the upstream and downstream processes were further discussed 
and described taking into account the data on the QTPP and/or CQAs. 
The deficiencies relating to viral and HCP safety have been appropriately addressed. The active 
substance and its purity profile has been characterised, and appropriate active substance and finished 
product release and stability specifications for purity, impurities and HCP have been set.  
GMP post-authorisation inspections have been recommended and adopted by CHMP to be performed as 
soon as possible in order to confirm GMP compliance of the manufacturing sites that have recently 
implemented changes in the methods and manufacturing processes in the dossier. 
Overall, the provided documentation to support the marketing authorisation application of Bimervax 
can be considered acceptable to address the quality of the active substance, the adjuvant and finished 
product in a satisfactory way. 
The applicant has agreed with the CHMP to address a number of outstanding issues post-approval as 
follows: with regard to: the CE-SDS-DG-R method and its resolution (REC1); active substance and 
finished product specifications revision when additional batch data from 15 commercial AS and FP 
batches is available (REC2); additional finished product stability data (REC3); replacement of the 
current method for the combined assessment of PS80 and sorbitan trioleate by analytical method(s) 
enabling separate quantification of PS80 and sorbitan trioleate (REC4); complementary data in order to 
update the current active substance manufacturing process validation with the recently additional 
controls for the AS manufacturing process (REC5); the specificity of the potency assay in displacement 
experiments using monoclonal alpha- and beta-strain specific antibodies (REC6), an in-depth 
characterisation of the qualitative HCP profile (REC7) and suppliers of the primary packaging (REC8). 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give assurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1. For CE-SDS-DG-R, the applicant is recommended to identify the 2 identities in the major peak, as 
well as the 3 peaks related to product degradation of the active substance within 6 months of MA (from 
MO5). 
2. For CE-SDS-DG-R, the applicant is recommended to revise the active substance (AS) and finished 
product (FP) CE-SDS-DG-R specifications after 15 commercial AS and FP batches have been 
manufactured. 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 35/177 
 
 
 
3. The applicant is recommended to provide available finished product stability data (including from 
vials stored in the inverted position) within 3 months after the granting of the MA. In case of any 
significant trends observed in the ongoing and/or in the newly started stability studies (even if the 
stability results are within the shelf-life specifications) the applicant is recommended to inform the 
Agency and to provide a discussion and justification for this trend.  
4. The applicant is recommended to substitute the current method for the combined assessment of 
PS80 and sorbitan trioleate by analytical method(s) enabling separate quantification of PS80 and 
sorbitan trioleate within 6 months after the granting of the MA. 
5. The applicant’s proposal to submit within 4 months after the marketing authorisation, additional and 
complementary data in order to update the current AS manufacturing process validation with the 
recently additional controls of the manufacturing process is endorsed.  
6. The applicant is recommended to assess within 6 months after the granting of the MA, the specificity 
of the potency assay in displacement experiments using monoclonal alpha- and beta-strain specific 
antibodies. 
7. An in-depth characterisation of the qualitative HCP profile of the AS should be performed in 2 
months after the granting of the MA. A risk assessment based on the outcome of the qualitative HCP 
assessment should be included, in view of the potential impact of an induced HCP-specific immune 
response on further treatment options with other therapeutic proteins. Independently of their 
abundance, all identified HCPs should be classified (depending on their biological, cellular component 
and molecular function) and further described regarding their potential risk. 
8. Suppliers of the primary packaging material should be mentioned in the dossier and replacement, or 
addition of a supplier should be handled via an appropriate variation. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Bimervax or PHH1V consists of purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD heterologous dimer fusion 
protein derived from B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) variants as vaccine antigen, and the SBQA, an 
oil-in-water adjuvant consisting of squalene (9.75 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.18 mg), sorbitan trioleate 
(1.18 mg), sodium citrate (0.66 mg), citric acid (0.04 mg) and water for injections per dose of 0.5 mL. 
The vaccine is intended to boost immunogenicity in adults vaccinated at least 6 months before with 
mRNA or adenovirus vaccines in a homologous or heterologous primary vaccination to prevent COVID-
19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, following a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose (40 µg recombinant RBD 
antigen and 50% (v/v) SBQA). 
The mechanism of action of SBQA adjuvant is well described in the literature based on SQBA analogous 
consisting of squalene (9.75 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.18 mg), sorbitan trioleate (1.18 mg), sodium 
citrate (0.66 mg), citric acid (0.04 mg) and water for injections per dose of 0.5 mL , including induction 
of chemokines for local recruitment of immune cells and enhanced antigen uptake by monocytes at the 
injection site, and enhanced monocytes differentiation into dendritic cells. The fixed 1:1 ratio of SBQA : 
RBD dimer in the PHH1 formulation was tested and an optimal ratio of adjuvant : antigen has not been 
explored.

2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The nonclinical pharmacology of PHH1V or PHH1V has been evaluated in 3 challenge models and in 6 
immunogenicity studies using different doses of antigen ranging from 0.04 µg to 40 µg, formulated 
with SBQA adjuvant (v/v 50%). In general, a prime-boost regimen was used and the vaccine was 
administered intramuscularly (i.m.) at Day 0 and Day 21 of each study. 
Challenge models 
A challenge study in Cynomolgus monkeys (27-31 months of age) receiving 2 doses (40 µg) of PHH1V 
vaccine showed a strong effect against SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge (strain D614G, 2 x 106 
PFU/animal, intranasal + intratracheal route on Day 36), including the prevention of infective virus 
load in lungs, a clear control of the infectious virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, as well as 
a prevention on bronchointerstitial lung inflammation at 6 days post challenge. In sera of vaccinated 
monkeys, not only the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding IgG antibodies, but also significantly high serum 
microneutralizing antibody titres against D614G, alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron SARS-CoV-2 
variants, were elicited at Day 28 of the study. In addition, vaccination with PHH1V induced an 
activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Day 28) after re-stimulation with alpha + beta peptide mix or 
Omicron peptides, denoting overall a balanced Th1/Th2 response and the secretion of RBD-specific IgA 
in low respiratory airways (Day 28), which increased after the SARS-CoV-2 experimental infection (Day 
42). The IgA supportive results were obtained using non-validated ELISA assay that enables to 
quantify BAL samples in a precise and linear manner. 
Similarly, a challenge study in Golden Syrian hamsters (5-6 weeks old) vaccinated with 20 µg or 40 µg 
PHH1V dose demonstrated the efficacy of the vaccine against experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2 
virus (SARS-CoV-2 Cat02 strain, 103.97 TCID50/animal, intranasal route on Day 35). Both doses of 
PHH1V vaccine reduced the infective viral load in lungs and elicited comparable SARS-CoV-2 RBD-
binding IgG response at Days 35, 37, 39 and 42. However, relative to 20 µg dose, vaccination with 40 
μg of PHH1V elicited the highest neutralizing antibody titres against D614G strain at Days 35 and 37 of 
the study, and provided a significant reduction in body weight loss and a better recovery of animals 
after challenge, and could also reduce the infective viral load and lesion severity in the upper 
respiratory. It is noteworthy that the results of viral titration and histopathology analysis of lungs of 
the vaccinated animals do not indicate the enhancement of respiratory disease associated with vaccine 
in this model. 
The challenge study conducted in the humanized K18-hACE2 mice model (4-5 weeks old) found that 
vaccination with PHH1V vaccine (10 µg or 20 μg) conferred strong protection against the SARS-CoV-2 
infection (SARS-CoV-2 Cat02, 103 TCID50/animal at Day 35), when assessed by weight loss or clinical 
signs (including mortality), infective viral load in main target organs (i.e. lungs, nasal turbinates and 
brain) as well as excretion of virus measured in the oropharyngeal swabs. Differences in viral load after 
experimental infection between vaccinated animals and control animals were also found in other 
respiratory (trachea, pharynx) or systemic (spleen and heart) organs. Moreover, in vaccinated animals, 
histopathological evaluation of lungs, nasal turbinates or brain showed no more than mild lesions after 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whereas moderate lesions were found in lungs and brain of some control 
animals, in line with high viral loads detected. In this study, PHH1V vaccinated animals showed 
significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding antibodies titres, and neutralizing titres against D614G  
strain at Days 35, 37 and 39, without significant difference between the 10 µg and 20 µg dose groups. 
Taken together, PHH1V vaccine demonstrated immunogenic and its protective efficacy has been shown 
in three different models, including non-human primates (NHP). The applicant explained that division 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 37/177 
 
 
 
of injection volumes between extremities in rodents is a common practice and has not been reported 
to have a negative impact on the animal’s immune response. The applicant further explained that the 
negative serology immunological status (pre-vaccination) of animals used in these pharmacology 
studies was based on the fact of their breeding in isolated facilities and handling under barrier 
conditions, rather than serology testing pre-vaccination. 
Immunogenicity studies 
Two immunogenicity studies were performed in BALB/c mice (6-7 weeks at 1st vaccination) 
demonstrating a dose-dependent immunogenicity of PHH1V, including induction of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-
binding IgG, neutralizing antibodies, and cellular immune responses. Neutralizing antibodies were 
elicited in mice with antigen doses as low as 0.2 μg at Day 21 and Day 35/Day 37 of the study. 
Vaccination with 20 µg PHH1V elicited pseudovirus-neutralizing titers (at Days 35 and 37) against 
alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants, orD614G strain, as well as a robust activation of CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells (at Days 35 and 37) producing an RBD-specific Th1-dominant response after in vitro re-
stimulation, and a balanced Th1/Th2 cytokines production until 48 hours post-stimulation, when 
analyzed in the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and ELISPot assays. Of note, in one study, the 20 
μg vaccine dose (formulated with SQBA) was found efficient to induce saturated immune response, 
with no beneficial effect seen for addition of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) or QS21 as 
immunostimulants to the vaccine formulation. 
The immunogenicity of PHH1V was further demonstrated in three pig studies (8-9 weeks old). In 
addition to induction of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-binding IgG response, high titers of neutralizing antibodies 
were observed on Day 38 or Day 35 in two pig studies using 20 µg PHH1V dose and no dose-response 
effect in terms of neutralizing antibodies observed for the 10 μg, 20 μg and 40 μg vaccine doses in the 
third study. From the third pig study, broader cross-neutralizing antibody titres in sera of the 
vaccinated pigs were evident on Days 28, 35 and 42 of the study, against multiple SARS-CoV-2 
Variants by the pseudovirus-based neutralization assays (PBNAs), including D614G strain, and alpha, 
beta, gamma, delta, delta plus, Mu and Omicron variants. The applicant provided evidence for 
detectable PBNA titers against alpha variant strain after first vaccination in some animals, but overall 
no data was reported of neutralizing antibodies against gamma, delta and omicron after one dose of 
vaccine. 
Similarly, studies in pig model also revealed effect of PHH1V vaccine on cellular immune response in 
animals receiving 10 µg, 20 µg, or 40 µg dose, when analyzed on Day 35 and Day 42, and the analysis 
of the ratio IgG2a/IgG1 indicates a balanced Th1/Th2 response to SARS-COV-2 commercial RBD 
peptide pools of SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain sequence. 
Additionally, a separate immunogenicity study in female Cynomolgus monkeys (30-35 months of age) 
showed that vaccination with 2 doses of PHH1V, at 20 μg or 40 μg, induced high levels of RBD binding 
IgG response and PBNA neutralizing antibody titres against pseudoviruses containing the SARS-CoV-2 
variants of alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants, on Days 29 and 36 of the study, and no significant 
differences were observed between the two tested doses. Neutralizing antibody titres against SARS-
CoV-2 variants slightly decreased on Day 65, but were maintained stable until the end of the study 
(Day 84). The PBNA data from challenge study in NHP showed that all animals developed high titers 
against gamma variant and some animals started to develop neutralizing antibodies against the 
Omicron variant after the first dose of vaccine. 
To sum up, results of these immunogenicity studies demonstrate that PHH1V vaccine, built on the 
fusion heterodimer RBDs of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and the B.1.351 (Beta) variants, is immunogenic and 
can elicit a cross-reactive response against different Variants of concern in different animal species 
including mice, pigs and NHPs.

2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed with PHH1V vaccine, which can be 
acceptable, according to the applicable regulatory guidelines. 
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Considering the nature of the PHH1V (local administration by i.m. route with limited systemic 
exposure) and the available nonclinical data, an effect on physiological functions (CNS, respiratory, 
cardiovascular, renal functions) other than the immune system are not expected. Still, FOB 
assessments were included in the GLP repeat dose toxicity studies AC25AA in mice (using PHH1 
vaccine) and AC91AA in rats (using PHH1V vaccine). No other safety pharmacology assessments are 
planned, which is considered acceptable according to current guidelines. 
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No studies on the pharmacodynamics drug interactions have been performed, which is in accordance 
with applicable guidelines. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In accordance with WHO guidelines on non-clinical evaluation of vaccines (WHO 2005) and vaccine 
adjuvants and adjuvanted vaccines (WHO 2013), traditional absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion (ADME) evaluations are not generally needed for vaccines. The safety concerns associated 
with vaccines are generally not related to the pharmacokinetics but are related to the potential 
induction of immune response. 
No PK studies were performed to assess the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion as well 
as the biodistribution and persistence of PHH1V vaccine or the SBQA adjuvant. 
It is expected that the recombinant protein is degraded to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
In addition, several studies available in the literature address the distribution of MF59C.1 (equivalent 
to SQBA adjuvant) when administered i.m. to mice as part of a vaccine and show that the majority of 
the adjuvant is retained at the administration site before clearance and some distribution to other 
tissues. Additional non-clinical studies to assess the PK of the adjuvant are not deemed necessary, 
considering that MF59C.1 is recognised as an established adjuvant and it is already approved for use in 
other vaccines by the same route of administration. This is aligned with the applicable regulatory 
guidelines. 
2.4.4.  Toxicology 
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were performed by the applicant, which is in accordance with applicable 
guidelines. 
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
The applicant conducted two pivotal GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies with PHH-1V 
adjuvanted with SBQA, one study in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and one study in New Zealand White 
(NZW) rabbits. In both studies, three doses of the vaccine candidate were administered via the 
intramuscular route, the clinical human route. In general, both toxicity studies were adequately 
designed including sufficient animal numbers per study group. An adjuvant-only study group was not 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 39/177 
 
 
 
included in these toxicity studies. This is acceptable because SBQA is comparable with the adjuvant 
MF59C.1 that is included in already approved products. 
In both PHH-1V toxicity studies, the animals were treated with 40 µg antigen per dose with 50% SBQA 
of the total vaccine volume, equivalent to the human clinical dose. However, only in the rabbit study, 
the full human dose volume of 0.5 mL/dose was administered to the study animals. In the rat study, 
the 40 µg antigen were administered only in a 0.1 mL dose, the maximum possible volume for those 
animals. Thus, lower amount of SBQA was administered into the rats. Overall, three intramuscular 
doses of 40 µg PHH-1V adjuvanted with SBQA were well tolerated in rabbits and rats. No mortalities or 
unscheduled deaths occurred in both studies. Furthermore, no remarkable differences in body weight 
gain, grip strength and sensory reactivity were observed in the animals. However, the mean body 
temperature was slightly higher after the first and third dose of PHH-1V in rats compared to the control 
group. In contrast, no difference of mean body temperature was observed in rabbits between 
vaccinated and control groups. In both animal models, slight, transient local reactions at the injection 
sites were observed after vaccination with PHH-1V, such as swelling of the skin in rats and slight 
erythema in rabbits. These findings were not severe and are typical for adjuvanted vaccines. The 
haematology parameters were within the normal range in rats and rabbits. However, significantly 
higher eosinophil levels were observed in rats of the PHH-1V group, which only partly recovered. In 
addition, a transient increase in fibrinogen levels was observed in rats. In contrast, no remarkable 
changes were observed in haematology and coagulation parameters in rabbits during the study. In 
clinical chemistry analysis, a slight transient increase in globulin and decrease in albumin levels were 
recorded in rats and rabbits of the PHH-1V group at the end of the treatment period. These alterations 
could be related to the expected antibody generation, increased production of inflammatory cytokines 
and/or post-administration inflammation process after vaccination with PHH-1V. Remarkable vaccine-
related organ weight changes were not observed in PHH-1V treated animals. However, only incidental 
slight differences were reported, such as greater kidney weights in female rats, lower weight of 
prostate and right mandibular gland in male rabbits. In addition, focal inflammation and fibroblastic 
proliferation were found in the subcutis at the injection sites of most male and female rabbits from the 
main PHH-1V group, which recovered only partly. Additionally, few animals had minimal to slight, 
multifocal inflammatory infiltrates into the skeletal muscle adjacent to the injection site associated with 
minor myofiber necrosis.  
In addition, two pilot non-GLP toxicity studies with PHH-1V have been conducted. One pilot toxicity 
study was conducted in rabbits via the intramuscular administration route with 40 µg antigen/dose. 
The other study was performed in mice via the subcutaneous and intramuscular routes with different 
amounts of antigen (40 µg, 20 µg, 10 µg, 5 µg, 0 µg) at four doses. In general, the animals well-
tolerated the vaccine. However, all rabbits of the pilot study suffered from encephalitozoon cuniculi 
infection and showed several adverse findings in different organs. Nevertheless, vaccine-related severe 
findings were not observed in the study animals.  
Moreover, the applicant conducted a GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity study in CD-1 IGS mice with 
SBQA-adjuvanted PHH-1, a COVID-19 vaccine from the same vaccine platform as PHH-1V but 
specifically designed against the D614G strain. This study is only of supportive character. The mice 
were vaccinated intermuscular with three doses of 50 µg antigen in 0.1mL (0.05 mL for each injection 
site). Four PHH-1 vaccinated mice died shortly after vaccine administration. One female died after the 
first dose, another female after the second dose and two males after the third dose. Before these mice 
died, the two males showed cyanosis, dyspnea, and prostration. After the third dose, two other male 
mice of the PHH-1 group showed transient abnormal behaviour, such as cyanosis, reduced activity, 
hunched back, abnormal gait, partially closed eyes, spasms and circling. The female mouse that died 
after the first dose showed no relevant macroscopic findings. However, the deaths of both males and 
that of the other female might be due to a drug-induced anaphylactic reaction. These three animals 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 40/177 
 
 
 
showed acute petechiae in the cerebellum together with acute congestion. Furthermore, anti-IgM and 
anti-IgG immunohistochemistry of the kidneys showed an increased thickening of the glomerular 
basement membranes from IgG deposits in treated mice compared to controls, which indicated the 
presence of circulating immunocomplexes associated with a type-III hypersensitivity immune reaction. 
In the remaining mice, no significant differences were observed compared to control mice regarding 
food consumption and body weight gain. However, higher body temperature and swollen skin at the 
injection sites were observed in the animals after every PHH-1 administration. The laboratory 
biochemistry parameters showed few alterations but they were still in a normal range. After the third 
PHH-1 dose, a significant increase in globulin levels was observed in vaccinated mice that could be 
related to the expected antibody generation after adjuvanted vaccine administration. Moreover, 
increased adrenal gland weight, increased spleen weight and decreased liver weight were observed in 
the PHH-1 group. At end of recovery, lower values in absolute brain weight were observed in males of 
the PHH-1 group. In addition, significantly higher values in absolute prostate weight was found in 
vaccinated males and significantly lower weight values of mandibular and sublingual glands were found 
in vaccinated females. At the end of the treatment, enlarged iliac and renal lymph nodes were 
observed in the PHH-1 treatment group, and few vaccinated mice showed abnormal coloration of 
stomach tissue. After the recovery period, some vaccinated mice still showed redness in different parts 
of the intestine, dark and reddish coloration in the mesenteric lymph nodes, reddish right uterine horn 
and/or pale liver. Although, PHH-1 caused these severe anaphylactic reactions in mice, which resulted 
even in few deaths, similar allergic reactions were not observed for PHH-1V in rats and rabbits. 
2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been performed in accordance with the WHO Guidelines on Non-clinical 
Evaluation of Vaccines (2005) and Guidelines on the Non-clinical Evaluation of Vaccine Adjuvants and 
Adjuvanted Vaccines (2014). The absence of these studies is considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed in accordance with the WHO Guidelines on Non-clinical 
Evaluation of Vaccines (2005) and Guidelines on the Non-clinical Evaluation of Vaccine Adjuvants and 
Adjuvanted Vaccines (2014). The absence of these studies is considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Additionally, the applicant conducted a combined GLP-compliant reproductive and development toxicity 
study to analyse any effects of PHH-1V on embryo-foetal, pre- and post-natal development in SD rats. 
Male and female rats were injected with 40 µg (0.1 mL/dose) PHH-IV antigen via the intramuscular 
route. The males received three administrations, 35 and 28 and 6 days prior to mating, and the 
females received four administrations, 21 and 14 days prior to mating and on gestation days 9 and 19. 
Half of the female rats were subjected to caesarean section with full foetal examination performed at 
the end of gestation. The other half of the female rats were allowed to deliver and were monitored until 
the end of lactation. In ELISA experiments, the applicant could show that high anti-RBD IgG binding 
antibody titres were detected in foetus and pups of PHH-1V-immunized rats due to exposure of 
maternal antibodies. Immunisation with the vaccine candidate PHH-1V did not affect the reproductivity 
of female or male rats. The sperm count, motility and morphology of PHH-1V vaccinated males were 
comparable to the control group. No vaccine-related differences in mating performance of female rats 
were observed. Furthermore, the oestrus cycle length of the vaccinated females was comparable to the 
control group and no vaccine-dependent effects on mating length and mating index were observed. 
The fertility and gestational index, and gestation length did not differ between PHH-1V vaccinated and 
control females. Also, no vaccine-dependent differences were observed in prenatal and postnatal loss

or lactation index between vaccinated and control groups. Furthermore, the percentage of live pups of 
PHH-1V-vaccinated dams was comparable to the control group and within historical control data. In 
general, no severe vaccine-related clinical signs and changes in pre- and post-natal development were 
observed in the F1 litters. Furthermore, skeletal and visceral examinations of the foetuses did not show 
any vaccine-related malformations or severe variations, indicating that up to four doses of 40 µg PHH-
1V did not cause teratogenic effects in rats. 
2.4.4.6.  Local Tolerance  
No stand-alone local tolerance study was conducted. This is acceptable and in line with relevant 
guidance on non-clinical vaccine development since local tolerance was evaluated in repeated dose 
toxicity studies. No aspects were identified in the submitted toxicity studies that would warrant raising 
a concern on local tolerance after i.m. administration of PHH-1 and PHH-1V. 
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100), due to their nature vaccines are unlikely to result in a 
significant risk to the environment. Therefore, environmental risk assessment studies are not provided 
in this application for Marketing Authorisation, which is considered acceptable. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The immunogenicity of PHH1V vaccine has been demonstrated for a prime-boost regimen in mice, 
hamsters, pigs and NHPs, showing induction of serum RBD-specific IgG responses and antibodies that 
(cross-)neutralize pseudoviruses containing RBD of different SARS-CoV-2 strains, including alpha, 
beta, gamma, delta, delta plus, Mu, and Omicron. The induction of RBD-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells 
with a balanced Th1/Th2 response was evident, too, whenever analyzed. A clear effect of the second 
dose (the boost) has been observed for the RBD binding IgG, and relatively, the information on (cross-
) neutralizing antibodies post primary vaccination (post dose 1) is limited from the nonclinical dossier. 
The efficacy of PHH1V vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 experimental infection has been consistently 
demonstrated following a prime-boost regimen in 3 challenge models including humanized K18-hACE2 
mice, hamsters and NHPs. Vaccination prevented infection of the lower and upper respiratory tracts 
and inflammation of the lungs in all studies, as well as prevented other consequences of the infection, 
such as virus spread to other organs/tissues like brains, spleens, hearts, etc (mice), body weight loss 
(mice, hamsters) and clinical signs including mortality (mice). A tendency of dose-response effect was 
revealed in hamster challenge model, with the highest dose (40 µg) of PHH1V conferring better 
efficacy and better recovery of the animals post experimental infection. Results of the hamster 
challenge model did not reveal any sign of enhanced respiratory disease associated with PHH1V 
vaccine. 
Overall, testing of the primary pharmacodynamics of PHH1V is adequate. 
There were no studies of second pharmacodynamics, pharmacodynamics drug interactions, or safety 
pharmacology performed with PHH1V vaccine. This is in line with currently applicable regulatory 
guidelines or justified by the absence of major finding in the completed repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Several points of other concerns identified for the primary pharmacodynamics aspect have been 
adequately addressed by the applicant during the rolling review procedure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 42/177 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
PK studies to assess the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion as well as biodistribution and 
persistence of the PHH1V vaccine or the SBQA adjuvant were not performed. The SBQA adjuvant is 
composed of squalene (9.75 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.18 mg), sorbitan trioleate (1.18 mg), sodium 
citrate (0.66 mg), citric acid (0.04 mg) and water for injections per 0.5 mL dose, whichhas been 
already included in the licensed vaccines. This is acceptable, according to the currently applicable 
regulatory guidelines on the non-clinical development of vaccine products. 
Toxicology 
The toxicity of SBQA adjuvanted PHH-1V was evaluated in two pivotal GLP-compliant repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, respectively. Overall, these studies revealed that three doses of 40 
µg PHH-1V were safe and well tolerated in the study animals. The vaccine only caused slight transient 
local and systemic reactions, which recovered in general within short time. Furthermore, a GLP-
compliant DART study with adjuvanted PHH-1V was conducted in rats. The applicant could 
demonstrate that the vaccine candidate induced no reproductive, teratogenic or developmental effects 
in rats. This study revealed also that foetuses and pups of PHH-1V-vaccinated rats had detectable 
RBD-specific binding antibodies. Thus, these data indicate that maternal anti-RBD binding antibodies 
were transferred to the foetuses and pups via umbilical cord and lactation. 
A dedicated local tolerance study was not performed, which is acceptable since local tolerance 
assessment was part of repeat-dose toxicity study. There were no studies on genotoxicity and 
carcinogenicity and no environmental risk assessment was carried out, which is in line with applicable 
guidelines.  
Overall, the safety profile of PHH-1V is acceptable. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No major non-clinical issues are identified in this application. Few points of other concerns were 
identified and have been properly addressed by the applicant.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted for PHH-1V. This is because pharmacokinetics 
studies are generally not needed for vaccines, consistent with current Guidelines on clinical evaluation 
of vaccines. 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 46/177 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic profile of vaccines is defined by their immunogenicity, as detailed in the CHMP 
guideline “Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005). As 
immunogenicity data of this vaccine are used to support the authorisation of this vaccine, 
immunogenicity data are included under the clinical efficacy section. 
In this section the mechanism of action and the respective assays applied to determine the 
immunogenicity data are discussed.  
Mechanism of action 
The PHH-1V is a SARS-CoV-2 RBD heterologous dimer fusion protein derived from B.1.1.7 (alpha) and 
B.1.351 (beta) strains as vaccine antigen, and the SBQA, an oil-in-water adjuvant consisting of 
squalene (9.75 mg), polysorbate 80 (1.18 mg), sorbitan trioleate (1.18 mg), sodium citrate (0.66 mg), 
citric acid (0.04 mg) and water for injections per 0.5 mL dose. Following administration, an immune 
response is generated, both at a humoral and cellular level, against the SARS-Co-V-2 RBD antigen. 
Neutralising antibodies against the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 prevent RBD binding to its cellular 
target ACE2, thus blocking membrane fusion and viral infection. Moreover, PHH-1V induces antigen-
specific T-cell immune response, which may contribute to protection to COVID-19. 
Applied Assays 
PBNA and VNA validation 
Two methods were used in this application to measure neutralizing antibodies (nABs) in the sera of the 
subjects: one pseudovirion-based neutralisation assay (PBNA) and a virus neutralisation assay (VNA).  
- 
For the PBNA, HIV-based pseudoviruses were designed that lack expression of the env and rev 
genes and were amended with the SARS-CoV-2 specific spike protein and a luciferase gene. 
The pseudoviruses are added to HEK293T/hACE2 cells that overexpress ACE-2 on their surface. 
The results in this assay are obtained as RLU (relative luminescence units), whereby the RLU 
readout is indirectly proportional to the content of nABs in the tested sera.  
- 
In the VNA SARS-CoV-2 viruses are added to a cell culture (ACE-2 expressing Vero-E6 cells) 
and infectivity of the cells in the presence of patient’s sera is used to determine the 
neutralising properties of the latter via fluorimetric readout (CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell 
viability assay (Promega) evaluating the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation 
of the available ATP).  
Initially only validation reports were submitted for the Alpha variant. Upon request, the Applicant 
submitted new validation reports of PBNAs specific to the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (Alpha), 
B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617 (Delta) and B.1.1.259 (Omicron).  
However, several concerns had to be addressed regarding the validation of both - PBNA and VNA. 
These issues included fundamental aspects required to ensure the validity and reliability of the 
obtained results.  
Documentation of production and stability of pseudoviruses and viruses was missing. Upon request the 
lacking documentation could be supplied together with data supporting the Applicant’s conclusion that 
the applied storage conditions of the pseudovirus and virus stocks enable stable storage for a 
prolonged time. 
Initially no information regarding the positive and negative controls (a high specific antibody level 
serum and a pre-pandemic serum) used during validation was provided. The Applicant clarified that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 47/177 
 
 
 
 
positive control test sera were obtained from patients having received two covid-19 vaccinations and a 
booster vaccination with PHH-1V. The negative control pre-pandemic serum was purchased at 
SigmaAldrich and originated from only one male donor (USA origin, AB blood type). This could be 
problematic, as one serum donor supposedly does not cover the neutralising capacity of the total 
population. Upon request the Applicant provided a scientific justification supported by assay data from 
the Phase 1/2a clinical trial HIPRA-HH-1 in which predominantly negative results were measured in 
Covid-19 naïve patient sera. It can be concluded that a sufficiently high number of negative sera was 
measured with the PBNA and the VNA to support the specificity. 
Further, it was not clear how the expected titre IC50 of the positive control serum pool has originally 
been determined, and if this titre value has been determined by a validated method. From the 
Applicant’s response to this concern, it is apparent that the IC50 values of the positive control sera 
used in the PBNAs and the VNA was determined with the same (yet non-validated) assays. 
Consequently, the applied PBNAs and the VNA are only capable of generating relative results of nABs in 
patient’s sera. This however also means that throughout the clinical studies, only relative nAB titres 
were and can be measured with the established PBNAs (and the Alpha-variant VNA). The efficacy 
evaluation of PHH-1V therefore solely needs to rely on a relative comparison between nAB levels 
between different treatment arms.  
The accuracy of both assays was determined by calculating the mean value of the analysed samples 
and expressing the variance of sub-groups of replicates (e.g. quadruplicate measured by Analyst A or 
B at day 1 or 2) to this mean value. This methodology is generally not supported. It should rather be 
determined by comparing the read-outs with their true value. However, it is acknowledged that this is 
currently not possible since no alternative analytical method was available to analyse the true value of 
the controls in the PBNA (and VNA) validations. Additionally, the Applicant argued that the final 
objective of the PBNA and VNA in the presented PHH-1V clinical studies is to compare levels of 
neutralizing antibodies between different treatments. Consequently, the true value of the positive 
control serum is not critical for the final evaluation of PHH-1V efficacy, which is acknowledged. In 
conclusion, the accuracy of the PBNA and VNA cannot be calculated, as no variance relative to a true 
value can be determined due to the lack of the latter. Consequently, the obtained results can only be 
compared within results obtained with the same assay.   
Initially, it was questioned whether the analytical range of the PBNA (and VNA) might be too narrow to 
allow coverage of all possible nAB levels in patients. As consequence, the Applicant widened the range 
for all variants. The new upper limits in these PBNAs are: Alpha: 13327 IC50 (corresponding to 4.12 
log10IC50); Beta: 39020 IC50 (4.59 log10IC50); Delta: 58848 IC50 (4.71 log10IC50); Omicron: 
49220 IC50 (4.69 log10IC50). It is assumed that the new ranges cover the expectable nAB levels in 
clinical trials, as the upper limit of quantification is approximately one order of magnitude higher as 
applied in the previously submitted PBNA and VNA validation reports. In addition, the Applicant 
provided a validated approach to dilute high titre sera to reach the validated analysis range. Upon 
request, the Applicant presented an updated SOP implementing respective re-analyses of such 
saturated samples as standard procedure. 
Originally, it was not clear if the claimed LOQ at 101.30 (20) IC50 of the Alpha variant PBNA and VNA 
has been experimentally determined, as no serum samples at this level were used in the validation 
studies. In response, the Applicant amended the Alpha variant validation, and incorporated low titre 
sera as LOQs in the Beta, Delta and Omicron variant PBNA validations. The new LOQs were as follows: 
Beta: 49 IC50 (1.69 log10IC50); Delta: 64 IC50 (1.80 log10IC50); Omicron: 61 IC50 (1.78 
log10IC50); Alpha: 33 IC50 (1.52 log10IC50). 
To conclude, validations of PBNAs of the main SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron) 
and of the Alpha variant specific VNA support a robust and reliable use of these assays in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 48/177 
 
 
 
determination of nABs throughout the clinical studies. Nevertheless, comparisons to results obtained 
with other assays cannot be made. 
Apart from the PBNA and VNA, three additional assays are used to analyse patient sera: a commercial 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding assay, an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay for the 
evaluation of T cell-mediated immunogenicity and an intracellular cytokine staining assay also to 
determine the cellular immunity responses towards PHH-1V. Only one of these assays was validated 
in-house (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay purchased from Roche). In a prior rapid scientific advice 
procedure (EMA/SA/0000078033), CHMP accepted this strategy. Nonetheless, for the non-validated 
assays, it is stressed that the data gathered in these assays cannot be regarded as reliable and should 
thus only be regarded as supplementary (but not pivotal) data.  
Correlation study between PBNA and VNA 
For the main conclusion of non-inferior or superior immunogenicity it is most important that differences 
between products obtained with PBNA correspond to comparable differences (in magnitude and scale) 
that would have been obtained using VNA. For this purpose, the Applicant was requested to provide 
Bland Altman plots of measurements obtained by either method for each variant and additional 
analyses from representative (or complete) samples from studies HIPRA-HH-1 and HIPRA-HH-2 
evaluating the comparability of between product differences in post vaccination titres between assays.  
The Applicant provided the requested Bland Altman plots comparing assay readouts from PBNA with 
corresponding measurements from VNA. Bland-Altman plots indicate close to 1:1 correspondence 
between assays for Alpha, Delta with higher absolute values obtained from PBNA (linear trend with 
slope 1 but positive intercept). For Omicron assays, a positive slope (indicating increasingly larger 
PBNA measurements for increasing average titres) was observed. For D614G strain, the estimated 
slope is negative (indicating increasingly lower PBNA values with increasing average titres). The latter 
however may be an artefact due to few outliers with large titre levels acting as leverage points. 
Overall, the variability between assay differences is within acceptable limits and importantly assay 
correspondence appears comparable between samples obtained from subjects vaccinated with different 
products.  
In addition, the Applicant provided an analysis comparing post vaccination GMTs using either PBNA or 
VNA based on a subsample from study HIPRA-HH-2. The comparison between Day 14 GMTs obtained 
using VNA in the subset closely reproduced corresponding values obtained by PBNA.  
Considering the information provided, the Applicant’s position that the measurements obtained by 
PBNA and VNA have adequate agreement is acknowledged.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
As this application is based on immunobridging, it is of utmost importance that the immune response 
in terms of neutralizing antibodies is appropriately measured and assays have to be validated and the 
use of an assay for primary analysis needs to be adequately justified.  
While several concerns had to be addressed during the assessment, it can be concluded that the 
presented validations of PBNAs of the main SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron) and 
of the Alpha variant specific VNA support a robust and reliable use of these assays in the determination 
of nABs throughout the clinical studies. However, comparisons to results obtained with other assays 
cannot be made. The PBNAs (and the VNA) do not provide absolute determinations of the nAB content 
in patient’s sera, as none of the PBNAs (and the VNA) has been calibrated to adequate reference 
standards (e.g., sera with known nAB level). Consequently, throughout the clinical studies, only 
relative nAB titres were and can be measured with the established PBNAs and the Alpha-variant VNA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 49/177 
 
 
 
The obtained results can therefore not be directly compared to other data sources. This means the 
efficacy evaluation of PHH-1V solely needs to rely on a relative comparison between nAB levels 
between different treatment arms.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PBNAs (and the VNA) do not provide absolute determinations of the nAB content in patient’s sera. 
Consequently, throughout the clinical studies, only relative nAB titres were and can be measured with 
the established PBNAs and the Alpha-variant VNA. The obtained results can therefore not be directly 
compared to other data sources. The efficacy evaluation of PHH-1V solely needs to rely on a relative 
comparison between nAB levels between different treatment arms.  
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  clinical  development  is  based  on  an  immunobridging  approach  to  extrapolate  efficacy  from  the 
approved mRNA vaccine Comirnaty for which vaccine efficacy has been established.  
2.5.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study HIPRA-HH-1 
Study HH-1 is a Phase 1/2a, FIH, randomized (5:1), controlled (comparator Comirnaty 30 µg), 
observer-blinded, dose-escalation (2 doses 21 days apart, 3 cohorts receiving either 10, 20, or 40 µg), 
multicentre study (n=2, both in Spain) to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of PHH-1V 
in 30 healthy adults aged 18-39.  
Immunogenicity objectives: 
Immunogenicity was measured at baseline, 3-weeks after the first dose and 2-weeks after the second 
dose and in the long term i.e., 24 and 48 weeks after the second dose of COVID-19 HIPRA vaccine. 
Measurements for all timepoints include:  
•  wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization,  
• 
• 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein  
T-cell mediated responses against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein 
Results:  
The following tables show the results for the endpoints: 
•  Neutralization titer measured as ID50 or IC50 and reported as reciprocal dilution/concentration 
for each individual sample and geometric mean titer (GMT) for group comparison at Day 21 and 
35. IC50 measured by PBNA.  
•  Geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) in neutralizing antibodies titers from baseline at Day 21 and 
35.

Overall, PHH-1V has demonstrated to be immunogenic in adult subjects vaccinated with antigen doses 
of 10 μg, 20 μg or 40 μg in a prime-boost regime. Specifically, high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising 
are produced against Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants. The sample size of this clinical trial was 
very low as it was a FIH. So, data from the immunogenicity could only be taken as a trend as the 
statistical analysis was not always able to confirm a significant difference with this sample size.  
There was no evidence of a clear dose-response relationship between the three PHH-1V vaccine doses.  
2.5.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Study HIPRA-HH-2  
Study HIPRA-HH-2 is a double-blind, randomized (2:1), active controlled (comparator Comirnaty 30 µg), 
multi-centre (10 sites in Spain), non-inferiority trial to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of a single 
PHH-1V dose (40 µg) as a booster vaccination in in adults (18, at least 10% >65 years). This study is 
planned to be followed by a Phase 3 single-arm, open-label trial to assess further immunogenicity and 
safety. 
The latest report provides the interim analysis (version 5.0; dated 10 March 2023) and presents results 
from all enrolled subjects who completed Day 14, Day 28, and Day 182 assessments, and also a subset 
of subjects who completed Day 98 assessments.  
Methods 
•  Study Participants  
Adults aged 18 years of age or older previously primed with 2 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine vaccine 
at least 182 days and with a maximum of 365 days prior to the booster injection. 
Inclusion criteria: 
Subjects must have met all the following criteria to be considered eligible for the study: 
1 
Male or female, by birth, ≥ 18 years old at Screening.  
2. 
Was willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, laboratory tests, complete 
diaries, and other study procedures. 
3. 
4. 
Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 to 40 kg/m2. 
Had received a complete COVID-19 vaccination programme (two administrations, 
prime and boosting) at least 182 days and with a maximum of 365 days before booster 
vaccination with Comirnaty vaccine.  
5. 
6. 
Had a negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at Screening.  
Was willing to avoid all other vaccines within 4 weeks before and after vaccination in 
this study (Day 0). Seasonal influenza vaccination was allowed if it was received at least 14 
days before or after Day 0. 
7. 
8. 
Was willing to refrain from blood donation during the study. 
Women of childbearing potential must have had a negative blood or urine pregnancy 
test at Screening and Day 0 (before vaccination). 
9. 
Women of childbearing potential must have been willing to use highly effective 
contraceptive methods or had practiced sexual abstinence from the screening visit until 8 
weeks after the vaccination (Day 0). Highly effective contraceptive methods included oral, 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 53/177 
 
 
 
 
intravaginal, or transdermal combined (containing oestrogen and progestogen) hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; oral, injectable, or implantable 
progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine 
device; intrauterine hormone-releasing system; bilateral tubal occlusion; vasectomised 
partner; condom and sexual abstinence. 
NOTE: A woman was considered of childbearing potential following menarche and until 
becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods 
included hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A 
postmenopausal state was defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range 
may have been used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement was insufficient. 
Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea methods (LAM) were not 
acceptable methods of contraception. 
10.  Males who were not sterilised, must have been willing to avoid impregnating female 
partners from Screening until 8 weeks after vaccination (Day 0). 
11.  Was willing and able to provide written informed consent prior the initiation of any 
study procedures.

Any medical disease (acute, subacute, intermittent, or chronic) or condition that in the 
opinion of the Investigator compromised the subject's safety, preclude vaccination or 
compromised interpretation of the results. 
4. 
Ongoing serious psychiatric condition likely to affect participation in the study (e.g., 
ongoing severe depression, recent suicidal ideation, bipolar disorder, personality disorder,

disease not requiring immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy and any stable 
endocrine disorders that have a confirmed autoimmune aetiology (e.g., thyroid, pancreatic), 
including controlled diabetes, were permitted at the discretion of the Investigator.  
10. 
Acute illness within 72 hours before Day 0 that, in the opinion of the Investigator may 
have interfered the evaluation of safety parameters. 
11.

generalised urticarial, angioedema and other significant reactions related to food, drugs, 
vaccines, or pharmaceutical agents, which were likely to be exacerbated by any component of 
PHH-1V (including the oil in water adjuvant equivalent to MF59C.1).  
13.  Use of any immunosuppressant, glucocorticoids, or other immune-modifying drugs 
within 2 months before Day 0; or anticipation of the need for immunosuppressive treatment 
within 182 days after vaccination (Day 0). NOTE: The use of topical, inhaled, and nasal routes 
were not permitted. Short courses of ≤5 days of topical and inhaled corticoids were 
permitted.

criteria throughout the study duration. 
•  Number and percentage of COVID-19 severe infections through Day 364. 
•  Number and percentage of hospital admissions associated with COVID-19 through Day 364. 
•  Number and percentage of intensive care unit admissions associated with COVID 19 through Day 
364. 
•  Number and percentage of deaths associated with COVID-19 through Day 364. 
•  Sample size 
In accordance with the FDA Guidance for Industry on Clinical Data Needed to Support the Licensure of 
Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines, non-inferiority for a new influenza vaccine product could be 
claimed if the upper bound of a two-sided 95% CI surrounding the ratio of GMT for the control to 
investigational product does not exceed 1.5. Given the uncertainty in the immune response and 
variability, this study was planned with a reduced non-inferiority margin of 1.4 to ensure sufficient 
sample size for safety and immunogenicity assessments. Considering these assumptions, and with a 
2:1 randomisation ratio, group sample sizes of 301 and 151, respectively, would have achieved 90% 
power to detect non-inferiority using a one-sided 2.5% significance level, two-sample t-test using a 
SDlog=0.45 for both treatments. 
Assuming a 25% withdrawal rate, a total of 602 subjects (401 in PHH-1V group, 201 in the Comirnaty 
active control group) were planned to be randomised in this study. 
The 602 planned subjects enrolled into the study were stratified 2:1 for the following age groups: 18 to 
64 years and ≥65 years.  
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Subjects were allocated to treatment using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomisation 
was stratified by age group: 18 to 64 years and ≥65 years with approximately 10% enrolled among 
the ≥65 group. Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment (PHH-1V or Comirnaty) in a 2:1 ratio. 
Randomisation could have taken place prior to the Baseline visit (Day 0) but the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria needed to be reviewed again during the randomisation visit to ensure that the 
subject was eligible. 
This study was double-blinded; subjects, site staff, the Sponsor, and the CRO were blinded to subject 
treatment. At each site, an unblinded pharmacist or other qualified personnel prepared the booster 
dose, depending on treatment allocation. In addition, an identified, unblinded site staff member, who 
was not otherwise involved with the study procedures (except for blood collection), may have 
administered treatment to subjects. A label was used to mask the syringe because the two treatments

were visually different. An unblinded Clinical Research Associate (CRA), who was not otherwise 
involved with monitoring study data, reviewed study drug accountability. 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
As of protocol version 5.0 the following analyses populations were defined in this study: 
•  Enrolled (EP): All subjects who have signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF). 
• 
Intent-to-treat (ITT): All subjects who are randomly assigned to treatment, regardless of 
the treatment status in the study. Subjects will be grouped as randomised. 
•  Modified Intent-to-treat (mITT): All subjects in the ITT who meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and received a dose of study drug. 
•  Per-protocol (PP): All subjects in the mITT who received a dose of study drug and have no 
major protocol deviations, as determined and documented by Sponsor prior to data base lock 
(DBL) and unblinding that impact critical or key study data. Subjects will be analysed according 
to the treatment they actually received. 
• 
Immunogenicity (IGP): All subjects in the mITT who had a valid immunogenicity test result 
before receiving study drug and at least one valid result after dosing. Subjects will be grouped 
as randomised. 
•  Safety (SP): All randomised subjects who received the study drug. This population will be 
used for all analyses of safety. Subjects will be analysed according to the treatment they 
actually received. 
The efficacy analysis was to be performed using the mITT and PP populations. Immunogenicity was to 
be further analysed using the IGP population. 
Due to concerns raised during the rolling review an additional analysis population“mITT3” was defined 
that excluded confirmed COVID-19 cases: All subjects in the mITT without COVID-19 infections 
recorded via adverse event reporting prior to their 6 month visit date, for the evaluation of long-term 
immunogenicity. 
Efficacy Analysis: 
To show non-inferiority the treatment group difference (Comirnaty active control vs PHH-1V) the 
efficacy analyses tested the following hypothesis (FDA Guidance for Industry on Clinical Data Needed 
to Support the Licensure of Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines): 
•  Null hypothesis, H0: The ratio of the GMTs (Licensed product: Investigational product) exceeds 
the non-inferiority margin (NIm); equivalently the difference in log(GMT) exceeds log(NIm). 
•  Alternative hypothesis, H1: The ratio of GMTs (Licensed product: Investigational product) is 
below NIm; equivalently the difference in log(GMT) is less than log(NIm). 
The NIm for this study is 1.4, whereby the upper bound of the 95% CI must be lower to reject the null 
hypothesis and is defined for each endpoint separately. 
 According to the interim CSR: 
The following subject populations were evaluated and used for presentation and analysis of the data: 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 59/177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Enrolled (EP): All subjects who had signed the ICF. 
• 
Intent-to-treat (ITT): All subjects who were randomly assigned to treatment, regardless of 
the subject’s treatment status in the study. Subjects were grouped as treated. 
•  Modified ITT (mITT): All subjects in the ITT who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
received a dose of study drug. Subjects who tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of 
receiving study drug were excluded. Subjects were grouped as treated. 
•  Per-protocol (PP): All subjects in the mITT and had no important protocol deviations, as 
determined, and documented by Sponsor prior to data base lock (DBL) and unblinding that 
impacted critical or key study data. Subjects were analysed according to the treatment they 
actually received. 
• 
Immunogenicity (IGP): All subjects in the mITT who had a valid immunogenicity test result 
before receiving study drug and at least one valid result after dosing. Subjects were grouped 
as treated. 
•  Safety (SP): All randomised subjects who received the study drug. This population was used 
for all analyses of safety. Subjects were analysed according to the treatment they actually 
received. 
The mITT population was the primary population for the analysis of efficacy parameters. Subsets of 
efficacy parameters were evaluated for the PP and IGP populations. The Safety population was the 
primary population for the analysis of safety endpoints. 
In Addition interim CSR Version 4.0: 
In version 4.0 of the Interim Study Report the Applicant additionally defines: 
• mITT3 (excluding confirmed COVID-19 cases): All subjects in the mITT without COVID-19 
infections recorded via adverse event reporting prior to their 6 month visit date, for the evaluation of 
long-term immunogenicity. 
Estimand 
According to the SAP: 
The primary estimand for the study which follows the ‘While On Treatment’ strategy is: 
The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMTs) for the two treatment groups in the target subject 
population for the neutralising antibody titres measured as inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) by PBNA 
for D614G strain at Day 14 after the booster dose, regardless of study discontinuation and COVID-19 
infections. 
Estimand components: 
A. The population is restricted to the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) above. 
B. The variable is the neutralising antibody titres measured as IC50 by PBNA for D614G strain and 
reported as GMT at Day 14 after the booster dose. 
C. The intervention effect is regardless of study discontinuation and COVID-19 infections. 
D. The population-level summary measure is the ratio of the GMTs for the two treatment groups. 
Secondary estimands will follow a similar strategy as above.

Analysis Methods 
According to the protocol: 
The following statistical methods were carried out: 
• 
• 
The continuous variables related to immunogenicity were analysed using analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) with previously log-transformed data. Estimates for each treatment group were 
presented with the associated 95% CIs of the geometric means. The treatment group 
difference (Comirnaty active control vs PHH-1V) was also presented with the corresponding 
95% CI and p-value. 
The binary variables related to the immunogenicity endpoints (e.g., proportion of subjects with 
a >=4-fold change in binding antibodies titre from Baseline) were described by frequency 
proportion and 95% CI using exact methods based on binomial, Clopper- Pearson method by 
treatment group. A logistic regression was used to evaluate the treatment comparisons and 
estimate the differences between groups and their 95% CI. 
•  Assessment of the subjects with COVID-19 infections and severity was described using 
incidence of cases and frequencies (%). 
All statistical tests were performed using a two-tailed 5% overall significance level, unless otherwise 
stated. The efficacy analysis was performed using the mITT and PP populations. Immunogenicity 
analysis was further analysed using the IGP population. 
To investigate the primary endpoint of neutralisation titre against D614G strain as measured by IC50 
by a PBNA at Day 14, a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used. 
The MMRM model will be carried out on log transformed data and will include the following effects: 
• 
Fixed effects: treatment group, age group, visit (Baseline and Day 14) and treatment-by-visit 
interaction 
•  Random effect: site 
•  Repeated measures structure: visits within subject. 
A compound symmetry covariance matrix structure was used. The denominator degrees of freedom 
were computed using the Kenward-Roger method. 
The model assumptions for each model were assessed, for example via visual inspection of the 
diagnostic plots. Alternative covariance matrix structures were explored and if necessary, 
transformation of the endpoint was considered as a sensitivity analysis. Alternative methods may be 
considered if assumptions on transformed data are also not met. 
The Least Squared (LS) mean ratio estimates for each treatment group were presented with the 
associated 95% CIs. The back-transformed treatment group difference in LS Means ratio (GMT) 
(Comirnaty active control vs PHH-1V) was also presented with the corresponding 95% CI and p-value.

Only key changes are reported here. For the full list of changes please refer to the study report. 
Protocol Version 3.0 (29 November 2021): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
 The sample size decreased, from 1075 to 602 subjects. 
 The percentage of subjects randomised in the 65+ age group decreased from 20% to 10%. 
 A phone call at 72 hours post vaccination was added for the first 30 subjects to collect safety 
data to be sent to the DSMB. 
 The non-inferiority margin increased to 1.4 from 1.25. 
 Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was added, which was to be used for the PP and 
IGP populations. 
 Infections (COVID-19) was added to the list of AESI’s potential immune-mediated medical 
conditions. 
Protocol Version 4.0 (20 December 2021): 
• 
• 
 The unblinding date was updated from Day 182 to Day 28. Once the subject was aware of 
which vaccine they received, they were able to decide if they wanted to receive a commercial 
COVID-19 vaccine (three months after receiving PHH-1V). 
 This was added as an extra visit between Day 28 and Day 182.  
Protocol Version 5.0 (14 February 2022): 
• 
• 
• 
 Day 98 was added to the schedule of events for only a subset of approximately 20% of the 
total number of subjects included in the study. 
 The exploratory endpoint was updated to collect the number and percentage of subjects with 
SARS-CoV-2 infections ≥14 days after PHH-1V booster vaccination. 
Infections (COVID-19) was updated in the list of AESI’s potential immune-mediated medical 
conditions to COVID-19 cases happening ≥14 days post-booster. 
•  Changes in the Planned Analysis of the Study 
Changes between the protocol-defined statistical analyses and those presented in the SAP: 
•  Addition of the Estimands Framework per ICH E9 (R1) addendum. 
•  Clarification of analysis of the exploratory endpoints relating to COVID-19 infections 
•  Update to secondary endpoint text for GMFR to correct terminology as this endpoint cannot be 
analysed at Baseline as this is used to calculate the fold rise. 
• 
 Amendments to the summary statistics for immunogenicity data to only list raw and 
reciprocal data and summarise the log10 transformations. 
Protocol Version 8.0 (20 July 2022):  
This latest protocol version submitted with sequence 4 (October 2022) incorporates the 
Applicant’s intent to investigate a fourth dose administration of PHH-1V. 
•  Baseline data 
For all analyses, Baseline was defined as the most recent measurement prior to the first

LS mean = least square mean; N = the number of subjects in the population; mITT = modified intent-to-treat 
population; MMRM = mixed model repeated measures. 
[1] A MMRM model was fitted to the assess the endpoint on the log10 scale. The model included treatment group, 
age group (18-64, >64), visit (Baseline, Days 14 and 98), and the treatment-by-visit interaction term as fixed 
effects. Site was included as a random effect. A compound symmetry covariance matrix was used to model the 
within-subject error and the Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate the degrees of freedom. Least 
Square Means from the fitted model on the log10 scale. 
[2] The GMT for treatment means and the GMT for the treatment ratio are estimated using LS Means from the fitted 
model on the log10 scale and back-transformed.

effects. Site was included as a random effect. A compound symmetry covariance matrix was used to model the 
within-subject error and the Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate the degrees of freedom. Least 
Square Means from the fitted model on the log10 scale. 
[2] The GMT for treatment means and the GMT for the treatment ratio are estimated using Least Square (LS) Means 
from the fitted model on the log10 scale and back-transformed. 
Raw data provided as <20 have been imputed as 20 for analysis. Any zero values have been imputed to 10 (half the 
LLOQ) for analysis. Transformations have been made on the imputed data.

[1] A MMRM model was fitted to the assess the endpoint on the log10 scale. The model included treatment group, 
age group (18-64, >64), visit (Baseline, Days 14 and 98) as fixed effects, and the treatment-by-visit interaction 
term. Site was included as a random effect. A compound symmetry covariance matrix was used to model the 
within-subject error and the Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate the degrees of freedom. 
[2] The adjusted treatment means are estimated using Least Square (LS) Means from the fitted model on the log10 
scale. 
[3] The GMT for treatment means and the GMFR for the treatment ratio are estimated using LS Means from the 
fitted model on the log10 scale and back-transformed.

Abbreviations: CI = Confidence interval, LS mean = least square mean, mITT = modified intent-to-treat, N = the 
number of subjects in the population, n = the number of subjects meeting the criterion. 
[1] % = n / number of subjects in the analysis. A responder is defined as those subjects with a fold change in binding 
antibodies of 4 or greater. 
[2] Exact CI for the proportion of responders has been calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
[3] A generalised estimating equations model for repeated measures was fitted to the assess the endpoint. The model 
included treatment group, age group (18-64, >64), visit (Baseline, Days 14 and 98) as fixed effects, and the 
treatment-by-visit interaction term. The model will assume a binomial family with logit link and an exchangeable 
working correlation matrix was used to model the within-subject error. 
[4] The adjusted treatment mean odds ratios and the treatment difference in odds ratio are estimated using Least 
Square (LS) Means from the fitted model on the log10 scale and back-transformed.

T-cell-mediated response to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein as measured by whole peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell (PBMC) stimulation by enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) at Baseline 
and at Day 14. This analysis was performed in a subset of subjects. 
To evaluate the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T-cell responses, 6 
peptide pools overlapping SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (2 pools), receptor binding domain (RBD) and 
RBD alpha, RBD beta, and RBD delta variants, were used. 
The peptides used in the simulations are as follows: 
SPIKE_SA: 194 peptides overlapping the S1-2016 to S1-2196 region of the Spike protein; 
SPIKE_SB: 168 peptides overlapping the S1-2197 to S2-2377 region of the Spike protein; 
RBD: 84 peptides overlapping the RBD region of the Spike protein (D614G strain sequence); 
RBD_B.1.1.7: 84 peptides overlapping the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant; 
RBD_B.1.351: 84 peptides overlapping the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant; 
RBD_B.1617.2: 84 peptides overlapping the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.

CD4+/CD8+ T-cell response to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein as measured by in vitro PBMC stimulation by 
cytokine staining assays at Baseline and at Day 14. This analysis was performed in a subset of 
subjects.  
The frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells expressing IFN-γ, interleukin-2 (IL-2), and interleukin-4 (IL-
4) was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) in a subgroup of approximately 30% randomly 
and blindly selected subjects previously determined as positive by ELISpot.

As IL-4 expression was not detected in the activated CD4+-T cells after the in vitro re-stimulation, the 
ICS results suggest that the PHH-1V booster vaccine induced a Th1-biased T-cell response.

to the pandemic’s evolution the response 
against the new strains of the virus became 
highly relevant (see below under the secondary 
endpoints).

Effect estimate per 
comparison 
For  D614G  strain,  the  GMT  ratio  on  Days  14  and  28  was  1.71  and  1.33 
respectively, which does not meet the non-inferiority criteria. On Day 98, the 
GMT ratio was 0.88 which meets the non-inferiority criteria and the GMT ratio 
on Day 182 was 0.62 which meets the superiority criteria.  
For Beta variant, the GMT ratio on Day 14 of 0.62, on Day 28 of 0.65, on Day 
98 of 0.58 and on Day 182 of 0.70 meet in all timepoint the superiority criteria.  
For the Delta variant the GMT ratio on Day 14 of 1.02, and on Day 28 of 0.89 
meet the non-inferiority criteria. The GMT ratio on Day 98 of 0.52 and on Day 
182 of 0.55 meet the superiority criteria.  
For Omicron BA.1, the GMT ratio on Day 14 of 0.60, on Day 28 of 0.66, on 
Day 98 of 0.60 and on Day 182 of 0.76 meet superiority criteria of the PHH-
1V vaccine versus Comirnaty vaccine.  
Furthermore, at Day 182 the analysis was performed with the mITT3 (excluding 
the population with confirmed COVID-19 infections). For D614G strain the GMT 
ratio was 0.54. For Beta, the GMT ratio was 0.54. For Delta the GMT ratio was 
0.43  and  for  Omicron  BA.1,  the  GMT  ratio  was  0.56  which  meet  superiority 
criteria of the PHH-1V vaccine versus Comirnaty vaccine for all tested strains. 
It is confirmed a sustained immune response after PHH-1V booster dose.

Analysis description  Secondary analysis:  
The neutralising antibody levels observed after the booster with the PHH-1V at 
D182 were higher than those observed with Comirnaty vaccine, demonstrating 
a more sustained immune response for all tested strains. This fact was shown 
in individuals below 65 years old and in individuals 65 years old and older. 
The fold rise in neutralising antibody titres against all strains was tested and 
GMFR ratio calculated.  
For  D614G  strain,  the  GMFR  ratio  on  Days  14  and  28  was  1.83  and  1.43 
respectively, which does not meet the non-inferiority criteria. On Day 98, the 
GMFR ratio was 0.90 which meets the non-inferiority criteria and the GMFR ratio 
on Day 182 was 0.66 which meets the superiority criteria.  
For Beta variant, the GMFR ratio on Day 14 of 0.70, on Day 28 of 0.74, on Day 
98 of 0.65 and on Day 182 of 0.78 meet in all timepoint the superiority criteria.  
For the Delta variant the GMFR ratio on Day 14 of 1.12, and on Day 28 of 0.98 
meet the non-inferiority criteria. The GMFR ratio on Day 98 of 0.59 and on Day 
182 of 0.60 meet the superiority criteria.   
For Omicron BA.1, the GMFR ratio on Day 14 of 0.69, on Day 28 of 0.76 meet 
superiority criteria. The GMFR ratio on Day 98 of 0.71 and on Day 182 of 0.87 
meet non-inferiority criteria of the PHH-1V vaccine versus Comirnaty vaccine. 
A  high  seroresponse  with  a  ≥4-fold  change  in  binding  antibodies  titre  from 
Baseline at Days 14, 28, 98 (for a subset of 20%), and 182 after the booster 
dose was observed after a booster dose of PHH-1V (Day 14: 98.4%, Day 28: 
97.6%, Day 98: 94.9%, Day 182: 94.9%). 
The  heterologous  boost  with  PHH-1V,  after  a  primary  immunization  with 
Comirnaty, elicited a Th1-CD4+ T cell response, more potent than the response 
induced  by  the  homologous  boost  with  Comirnaty,  and  a  CD8+  T  cell  response 
specific against RBD. 
A total of 31.2% and 32.4% of non-severe Covid-cases were reported in PHH-
1V and Comirnaty arms, respectively.  There were no cases of severe COVID-
19 infection and there were no immune-mediated adverse events in the study.

renally impaired participants are not expected to have different pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure to the

2.5.5.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Analysis to support an indication for subjects previously vaccinated with mRNA Covid-19 
vaccines 
In the pivotal study, data was obtained only with the comparator Comirnaty. In order to support the 
broader indication for subjects previously vaccinated with mRNA vaccines, the Applicant provided the 
immunogenicity data for individuals previously vaccinated with two doses of Spikevax from study 
HIPRA-HH-5 and concluded that the neutralising antibody levels observed at Day 14 after the booster 
with PHH-1V clearly show a strong booster effect. It is agreed that an immune response can be 
observed with an increase in GMTs of 6-20 fold. Although, this increase is much lower compared to the 
data derived in study HIPRA-HH-2, it has to be considered that the baseline titres were also about 10 
fold higher in Spikevax-vaccinated subjects. However, it has to be mentioned that the sample size is 
limited with 171 subjects and that the presented results could also be driven by a few strong 
responders. The higher baseline titres could also indicate previous unconfirmed Covid-19 infection in 
the respective subjects. Since the study was performed during the Omicron wave (first patient enrolled 
03 February 2022), this cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the observed increase at D14 still indicates 
a considerable immune response to PHH-1V. 
The following table integrates data from studies HIPRAHH-5 and HIPRA-HH-2 (subjects previously 
vaccinated with two doses of Comirnaty). In study HIPRA-HH-2 one arm received a booster dose of 
Comirnaty. It can be assumed that the titre achieved with the Comirnaty dose represents a protective 
level of neutralizing antibodies. It appears that subjects previously vaccinated with two doses of 
Spikevax achieved higher titres compared to the subject with three doses of Comirnaty for all tested 
variants. Of note, this is an informal across study comparison. Nevertheless, there is no concern that 
PHH-1V elicits protective titres also in subjects who were vaccinated with two doses of Spikevax.

The Applicant further presented an overview of safety data collected in study HH-5 in the respective 
subjects: 561 individuals vaccinated with two doses and 118 subjects vaccinated with one dose of 
Spikevax and having covid-19 infection or having received another dose of another vaccine 
(Comirnaty, Vaxzevria). It appears that more subjects that followed the primary vaccination with 
Spikevax/Spikevax tended to report solicited local and systemic events compared to the general 
population or subjects primary vaccinated with Comirnaty/Comirnaty, but numbers do not give rise to 
concern and the overall pattern of safety results are comparable to the overall population and to 
subjects previously vaccinated with Comirnaty. No concerns regarding a different safety profile arise 
from this data. However, the dataset is too small for any conclusions regarding uncommon adverse 
reactions.  
The presented data supports an indication for subjects previously vaccinated with mRNA Covid-19 
vaccines.  
2.5.5.5.  Supportive study(ies) 
Study HH-5  
This study is an ongoing, Phase III, open label, single arm, multi-centre, trial to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity of a booster vaccination with PHH-1V in adults vaccinated against COVID-19 with 
several primary vaccine schedules.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to assess safety and tolerability of PHH-1V as a booster dose in 
healthy adults vaccinated against COVID-19 with several primary vaccination schedules.  
Immunogenicity data was only collected in a subset of subjects. 
Secondary objectives are: 
•

Outcomes/endpoints 
The following secondary endpoints are related to efficacy: 
•  Neutralisation titre against D614G strain and Omicron strains, and any other relevant VoC in 
the epidemiologic moment, measured as inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) by a pseudovirion-
based neutralisation assay (PBNA) and reported as reciprocal concentration for each individual 
sample and geometric mean titre (GMT) for descriptive statistics analysis at Baseline and at 
Days 14, 91, 182, and 365. 
• 
The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) in neutralising antibody titre from Baseline to Day 14. 
•  Binding antibodies titre measured for each individual sample and GMT for descriptive statistics 
analysis at Baseline and Days 14, 91, 182, and 365. 
The GMFR in binding antibody titre from baseline to Day 14. 
The percentage of subjects that after the booster dose have a ≥4-fold change in binding 
• 
• 
antibodies titre from Baseline to Day 14. 
The following exploratory endpoints are related to efficacy: 
• 
T cell-mediated response to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein as measured by whole peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell (PBMC) stimulation by enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) at 
Baseline and at Day 14. This analysis was performed in a subset of 27 subjects. 
•  CD4+/CD8+ T cell response to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein as measured by in vitro PBMC 
stimulation by cytokine staining assays at Baseline and at Day 14. This analysis was performed 
in a subset of 27 subjects. 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculation was performed for this Phase III study. 
The study is planned to be performed in approx. 3000 subjects ≥16 years old, mainly in Spain with few 
centres in Italy and Portugal and is still ongoing (Date of the report: 30 May 2022 (version 2.0); Date 
first subject enrolled: 03 February 2022; Date last subject completed: Pending). 
Subjects were eligible to enrolled when they had received: (1) two homologous doses of Comirnaty, 
Spikevax or Vaxzevria, (2) one dose of Janssen, (3) two heterologous doses of Comirnaty + Spikevax 
(or vice-versa), Vaxzevria + Comirnaty/Spikevax, or (4) one dose of vaccine (Comirnaty, Spikevax, 
Vaxzevria or Janssen) and had a confirmed COVID-19 infection before or after the vaccination. 
Statistical methods 
Descriptive analysis was performed for variables overall by time-point. Categorical variables were 
presented by means of number of cases and frequencies (%) and continuous variables were presented 
by number of non-missing observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, min and max. For 
the immunogenicity variables the geometric mean titre, geometric mean concentration, GMFR, and 
standard deviations will be presented, as appropriate. Dichotomised measures for immunogenicity 
were presented as frequencies and percentages. 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also provided, as 
appropriate. In general, missing data was not imputed. For exploratory endpoints related to the 
immunogenicity endpoints and T-cell, zero values were imputed to half of the lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ). If other parameters were deemed appropriate for imputation, information was 
detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
Geometric mean titre (GMT), geometric mean concentration (GMC), GMFR and standard deviations 
were calculated based on the log-transformed titres. Calculation of 95% CI was based on the t

distribution of the log-transformed titres or the difference in the log-transformed titres for GMT and 
GMFR, respectively, then back transformed to the original scale. 
Results 
This interim analysis (version 3.0) presents results from the first 2646 enrolled subjects who have 
completed Day 14 safety assessments in Spain. There were 2593 subjects in the modified intent-to-
treat population and 230 subjects in the immunogenicity population.  
The immunogenicity subset should include about 8% of the enrolled subjects with no history of SARS-
CoV-2 infection (approx. 250 subjects: 100 subjects with two doses of Vaxzevria, 100 subjects with 
heterologous priming (Vaxzevria vaccine combined with messenger RNA vaccine) and 50 subjects with 
two doses of Spikevax. 16- or 17-year old subjects were to be vaccinated with two doses of Comirnaty.  
Defined populations: 
-  Modified Intent-to-treat (mITT): All subjects in the ITT (enrolled, regardless of the subject’s 
treatment status in the study) who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, received a dose of 
study drug and had not tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of receiving study drug. 
- 
Immunogenicity population (IGP): All subjects in the mITT who had a valid immunogenicity 
test result before receiving study drug and at least one valid result after dosing. Subjects were 
grouped following primary vaccination schemes. For the immunogenicity assessment, subjects 
who have a recorded case of COVID-19 were excluded.   
At day 0, each subject will receive one dose of COVID-19 HIPRA’s vaccine (PHH-1V; 0.5 mL (40 μg), 
single intramuscular administration; Batch number: 75N11). For immunogenicity assessment, each 
subject will be followed for 52 weeks (365 days) after the administration of the booster vaccination on 
Day 0. Evaluations of immunogenicity parameter will be performed at baseline and at Days 14, 91, 182 
and 365.  
Immunogenicity Results (secondary endpoints): 
Neutralising antibody results demonstrate that PHH-1V vaccine was able to elicit high levels of 
neutralising antibodies for the D614G strain SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as the VOCs Beta, Delta and 
Omicron.

Exploratory endpoints 
SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 related endpoints ≥14 days after PHH-1V booster:  
14 subjects were reported with a SARS-CoV-2 infection ≥14 days after PHH-1V booster. 
No subjects experienced severe COVID-19 infections, were hospitalised due to COVID-19, or were 
admitted to the ICU due to COVID-19 ≥14 days after PHH-1V booster during the time of this report. 
There have been no deaths associated with COVID-19 during the time of this report.  
T-cell mediated response 
• The RBD/Spike-specific IFN-γ+ T-cell response was analysed in a subset of 14 subjects immunised 
with PHH-1V after a primary vaccination with Vaxzevria. Data show that the heterologous booster with 
PHH-1V, after a primary vaccination with Vaxzevria elicits a significant IFN-γ+ T-cell response. (This 
report includes ELISpot data from day 0 (visit 2) and day 14 (visit 3). ICS is currently being performed 
and results will be included in the next Interim Report.)

(D614G strain, RBD alpha, RBD beta and RBD delta) and Spike (SA, SB) peptide pools, and analysed 
by IFN-γ-specific ELISpot assay. A logarithmic scale has been used for plotting purposes. 
Conclusion: 
• The plan to include groups who received one or two doses of any of the four approved vaccines with 
or without having had natural infection is intended to mimic as much as possible the current EU 
scenario. Individuals are being vaccinated regardless of their infection history and regardless of the 
previous vaccination scheme. Thus, several primary vaccine combinations, and previously infected 
subjects were enrolled in this study. Local and systemic reactogenicity have been assessed separately 
in these sub-groups and also considering the time elapsed since completion of the primary vaccination 
sequence or previous COVID-19 infection. 
• There were no cases of severe COVID-19 infection. The cases of COVID-19 infection reported were 
non-severe cases. Such findings indicate that PHH-1V provides protection to moderate, severe, life-
threatening, and fatal forms of SARS-CoV-2 infections. 
• Immunogenicity was assessed at Baseline and Day 14 in a subset of 230 subjects vaccinated with 
two doses of Comirnaty/Comirnaty (individuals 16-17 years old), Spikevax/Spikevax, 
Vaxzevria/Vaxzevria, or a combination of Vaxzevria and another brand of vaccine. In general, results 
showed a steep increase in immune response after PHH-1V vaccination, regardless of the brand of 
vaccine. The subsets previously vaccinated with Comirnaty/Comirnaty, Spikevax/Spikevax and 
Vaxzevria/Vaxzevria showed a high increase in the immune response after the PHH-1V booster dose. 
The percentage of responders (subjects with ≥4-fold change in binding antibody titres from Baseline to 
Day 14 after a booster) demonstrated that a response in antibody titres was observed in most 
vaccinated subjects.

Study HAN-01 
A phase IIb, multicenter, observed-blind, randomized, active controlled study to evaluate safety and 
immunogenicity of a recombinant protein RBD fusion dimer candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in 
adult healthy volunteers in Vietnam 
The study was conducted in Vietnam in 256 healthy adults aged 18-60 (Date of the interim report: 6 
April 2022 (version 2.0); cut-off date: 28 December 2021; Date first subject enrolled: 11 November 
2021; Date last subject completed: 11 January 2022). Subjects were eligible to enrolled when they 
had not received any Covid-19 vaccine and had no history of received COVID-19 infection.  
Subjects are randomized (1:1) to receive either COVID-19 Vaccine HIPRA or Pfizer–BioNTech 
(Comirnaty). Finally, 121 participants received 2 doses of PHH-1V and 124 participants received 2 
doses of Comirnaty vaccine. The study consists of a screening visit, vaccination, and revaccination 21 
days later, and follow up visits according to the Schedule of visits. Each subject is followed for 24 
weeks after the first dose. The study duration is approximately 30 weeks. 
The primary objectives are to assess safety and tolerability and to evaluate the immunogenicity at 
baseline and 3-weeks after the first dose and 2-weeks after the second dose of COVID-19 HIPRA 
vaccine (control: Pfizer (D614G strain, non-inferiority)). 
Secondary endpoints include the evaluation of different time points (e.g. 21 weeks) and different 
variant strains (Beta, Delta). 
Exploratory endpoints include SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 related endpoints (e.g. (severe) infections, ICU 
admission, death). Data on COVID-19 cases is not included in this Interim Report. Some Covid-19 
cases were reported and all cases were asymptomatic, or mild cases in both groups. This parameter

The presented results show an increase in neutralising antibody titre for all variants. Superiority could 
be shown for the Beta variant, non-inferiority for Omicron and inconclusive results have been obtained 
for Delta (numerically lower). Immunogenicity results of this study are not considered relevant for the 
current application. 
Study HH-10 
A Phase IIb, double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, multi-centre, non-inferiority trial to assess 
immunogenicity and safety of a booster vaccination with a recombinant protein RBD fusion dimer 
candidate (PHH-1V) against SARS-CoV-2, in adults fully vaccinated with adenovirus vaccine against 
COVID-19 
The study is planned to be performed in Spain in approx. 273 subjects ≥18 years old and is still 
ongoing (Date of the report: 13 May 2022 (version 2.0); Date first subject enrolled: 25 March 2022; 
Date last subject completed: Pending). Subjects were eligible to enrolled when they had received two 
doses of Vaxzevria and had no history of Covid-19 infection. Subjects were randomly assigned (2:1) to 
receive either COVID-19 HIPRA’s vaccine (PHH-1V; 0.5 mL (40 μg), single intramuscular 
administration. Batch number: 75N1116) or COVID-19 Pfizer–BioNTech’s vaccine (Comirnaty; 0.3 mL 
(30 μg), single intramuscular administration; several commercial batches).

Subjects received a single booster dose, according to treatment assignment, on Day 0 and were 
observed for 15 minutes after vaccination. Subjects returned to the site on Days 14, 98, and 182 (final 
visit) for blood sample collection and safety follow-up. Each subject will be followed for 182 days after 
the administration of the booster vaccination on Day 0. The total clinical study duration for each 
subject will be up to 7 months. 
The primary objectives of this study were to compare the change in immunogenicity against the 
Omicron strain at day 14 following the booster dose with the respective vaccines and to assess the 
safety and tolerability of PHH-1V as a booster dose in healthy adult subjects fully vaccinated against 
COVID-19 with Vaxzevria vaccine. 
Secondary objectives included determining the immunogenicity of other VOCs (Beta, Delta) and of 
different timepoints also for the Omicron strain (Baseline, Days 14, 98, and 182).  
Exploratory endpoints include SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 related endpoints (e.g. number of (severe) 
infections) (not included in this report, updates expected in next cycle).  
This interim analysis presents immunogenicity results from all enrolled subjects who have completed 
Day 14 assessments. At the date of data cut off (02 May 2022), 25 subjects were vaccinated, 17 
subjects received the PHH-1V vaccine, and 8 subjects received the Comirnaty vaccine.  
Results: 
For all variants neutralising antibody levels sharply increased in both vaccine arms 14 days after 
receiving the booster.

• There were no statistically significant differences in GMFR against omicron, beta or delta variants 
with the PHH-1V vaccine compared to the Comirnaty vaccine.  
• There is no statistically significant difference in fold change in binding antibodies between the vaccine 
arms on Day 14 (GMFR ratio of 2.89 [95% CI: 0.89, 9.41; p 0.0738]).

Overall, the results indicate that the PHH-1V vaccine is showing high levels of neutralising antibodies 
for the last and currently predominant VOCs. Data indicate that the booster with PHH-1V elicits an 
immune response similar to that of Comirnaty, although the sample size is small to be able to conduct 
statistics on noninferiority. 
The main reason for this low sample size is the difficulty to recruit more subjects and the exclusion of 
numerous subjects due to exclusion criteria (e.g. SARS COV-2 positivity, inability to provide valid blood 
samples). Further, most of the subjects who have received two doses of Vaxzevria vaccine have 
already received their booster (third dose of mRNA vaccine) and/or they have been diagnosed with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, there is a high number of subjects who received a heterologous 
primary vaccination scheme.  
The study is ongoing and every effort to improve recruitment is being executed along the way. All 
study centres have been supported by the Sponsor in the implementation of several different 
recruitment strategies. Currently, there has been an active search for new potential centres to be 
added to this program once they confirm they have access to the target population. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development is based on an immunobridging approach to extrapolate efficacy from the 
approved mRNA vaccine Comirnaty with established efficacy to the vaccine candidate PHH-1V. This 
approach is considered acceptable and was agreed to in the previous EMA-SA procedure (EMADOC-
1700519818-742601, Case No.: EMA/SA/0000066056). 
This MAA is based on the interim reports of several clinical studies, Study HH-1, HH-2, HH-5, HAN-01 
and HH-10. Studies HH-2, HH-5 and HH-10 are currently still ongoing, Study HH-1 reached the 1 year 
follow-up in August 2022, HAN-01 is completed. The submission of the final CSRs is documented as 
commitments and is included in the RMP. 
Study HH-2 is currently considered as the pivotal study for this application. It is a double-blind, 
randomized (2:1), active controlled (comparator Comirnaty 30 µg), multi-centre (10 sites in Spain), 
non-inferiority trial to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of a single PHH-1V dose (40 µg) as a 
booster vaccination (3rd dose) in adults (≥18, at least 10% >65 years) who previously received 
primary vaccination with Comirnaty.  
All other studies are considered supportive: 
- 
Study HH-5 is a phase III open label study to assess a booster vaccination in approx. 3000 
subjects with different vaccination/Covid-19 infection history. The study is mainly focussed on safety 
but also includes an immunogenicity assessment in currently 230 subjects (approx. 250 planned) 
- 
Study HH-1 is a Phase 1/2a, FIH dose-finding study for a two-dose primary immunization in 30 
healthy adults aged 18-39. Study HH-1 is not considered suitable to support a claim for a booster (3rd) 
dose since a primary immunization schedule was evaluated and further the number of included 
subjects is limited.  
- 
Study HAN-01 is a completed phase IIb study, for primary immunization (two doses) in adult 
healthy volunteers in Vietnam. Similar to study HH-1, this study is not considered suitable to support a 
claim for a booster (3rd) dose since a primary immunization schedule was evaluated. 
- 
Study HH-10 is a Phase IIb study to assess immunogenicity and safety of a booster vaccination 
with PHH-1V in adults fully vaccinated with adenovirus vaccine. While this study could be important to 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 125/177 
 
 
 
extend the indication also to subjects who have been received adenovirus vaccines, the data is 
currently too limited (25 subjects vaccinated) to support any such claim. 
Pivotal Study HH-2 
Study HH-2 is currently considered as the pivotal trial as it currently delivers the main immunogenicity 
data (751 subjects) for this application and immune responses pertaining to the Applicant’s intended 
application as booster vaccination were investigated. Overall, the study design of Study HH-2 appears 
acceptable, selection criteria are considered appropriate and sampling time points (Day 14, Day 28, 
Day 98, Day 182, and Day 364 (final visit)) are considered adequate to capture immune response 
kinetics. Currently only immunogenicity data for Day 14, Day 28, and Day 182 assessments, as well as 
Day 98 assessments of a subset (~20%) of subjects are presented (interim study report version 5.0, 
dated 10 March 2023). 
Stratification by age group (18-64 yoa, ≥65 yoa) with approximately 10% of the sample enrolled in 
the ≥65 yoa group is in principle endorsed.  
The choice for Comirnaty as active comparator is considered adequate as this vaccine is authorized for 
booster vaccination and efficacy has been established. 
Booster vaccination with either PHH-1V or Comirnaty was administered at least 182 days after the 
second dose of the primary series.  
Approximately 602 subjects were planned for Study HH-2. However, 862 subjects were screened and 
765 subjects vaccinated (513 PHH-1V; 252 Comirnaty). While in general a larger sample size could be 
preferable, this significant overrun had to be justified. Further, it had to be excluded that this overrun 
may have been driven by preliminary immunogenicity results. The Applicant argued that for logistics 
issues in the face of the dynamic epidemiologic situation a substantially larger number of subjects was 
included in the study compared to preplanned sample size targets. Moreover, the Applicant provided a 
re-analysis of the primary endpoints limited to the first 602 subjects (corresponding to the original 
sample size target) as requested. Since corresponding results are in line with results obtained from the 
mITT population (i.e. the primary analysis population) and support the main conclusions from Study 
HH2, this issue was resolved. 
Overall, the chosen objectives and endpoints are appropriate to investigate immune responses for a 
booster application and were also accepted in the EMA-SA (EMADOC-1700519818-742601, Case No.: 
EMA/SA/0000066056).  
Statistical methods are overall acceptable. However, the definition of the primary analysis population 
(mITT) differs between protocol and study report where subjects with COVID-19 infection <14 days 
after vaccination were excluded. This is also not in line with the estimand specified in the SAP. 
Respective sensitivity analyses, including analyses performed with a population in line with the 
estimand including subjects regardless of infection (mITT-2), were provided upon request which could 
address the raised concerns. In addition, a new analysis population ‘mITT3’ was introduced, defined as 
individuals included in the mITT but without COVID-19 infections confirmed by PCR or rapid antigen 
test between Day 0 and Day 182. Some ambiguities concerning the analysis model estimating GMT 
differences for VOCs noted in the results tables were addressed by the Applicant and it was clarified 
that while the table captions listed several visits, estimates were based on immunogenicity data up to 
Day 14 only. Technically, the multiple type I error rate is not controlled for conclusions on 
immunogenicity differences for VOCs. Nevertheless, the results are supportive of comparable or even 
better immunogenicity against Beta, Delta and Omicron.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
As this application is based on immunobridging, a proven surrogacy of PBNA for VNA for all different 
variants is a prerequisite for using PBNA as primary immunogenicity assay. This had also been 
emphasized during the scientific advice procedure (”The correlation with VNA as determined against 
whole virion needs to be demonstrated for the different strains”, EMADOC-360526170-955736, Case 
No.: EMA/SA/0000078033). Initially several issues and lack of relevant data were identified regarding 
the used immunogenicity assays that questioned the validity of the presented data. The Applicant 
could mitigate the raised concerns and provided additional data to support the agreement between 
PBNA and VNA measurements. Consequently, the suitability of the PBNA as primary immunogenicity 
data source is accepted.  
The currently available neutralizing antibody response was measured using PBNA. Only preliminary VNA 
data are available.  
Only  data  for  D614G  strain  and  the  Beta,  Delta  and  Omicron  BA.1  VOC  were  presented  so  far.  Since 
PHH-1V’s active substance consists of a RBD fusion heterodimer based on SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351 
(Beta) and B.1.1.7 (Alpha), the lack of data regarding the Alpha VOC appeared counterintuitive. D614G 
strain was selected as it was the ancestral strain for which efficacy was demonstrated in most of the first 
clinical trials of already registered vaccines. Although currently not considered as VOC, Beta was selected 
as it is a variant that contains some of the most relevant mutations that have been sustained along the 
evolution of the virus. Delta and Omicron BA.1 were selected because these are the variants that are 
still  of  most concern  at  time  of  study conduct  and  considered  as  VOC. Although  data  on Alpha  would 
have been expected due to the composition of the vaccine, lack thereof is not considered prohibitive of 
potential approval of this vaccine as it is not specifically developed as variant vaccine against Alpha. To 
date, there are no reliable data on the immunogenicity for the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages. Albeit 
the  Applicant  developed  a  PBNA  assay  for  BA.4/5  but  could  not  provide  documentation  of  a 
validated/qualified bridging. 
Pivotal Study HH-2 
In the pivotal HH2 study, PHH-1V failed to  demonstrate non-inferiority against the active comparator 
Comirnaty in the primary efficacy endpoint (neutralizing antibody responses against the D614G strain at 
Day 14, PBNA). Thus, the multiple type I error rate was not controlled for conclusions on immunogenicity 
differences for VOCs. While PHH-1V failed to demonstrate non-inferiority against the active comparator 
Comirnaty in the primary efficacy endpoint (neutralizing antibody responses against the D614G strain 
strain at Day 14, PBNA), it was superior with regard to the Beta and Omicron VOC and non-inferior with 
regards to the Delta VOC (secondary endpoints, also neutralizing antibody responses at Day 14, PBNA). 
Notwithstanding that the primary endpoint was not met, the application can still be approvable, since 
the D614G strain strain has been superseded by the emerging VOCs in particular the recent Omicron 
VOC, rendering the secondary endpoints clinically more relevant than the primary endpoint.  
The  presented  immunogenicity  data  is  based  on  the  modified  ITT  population  (mITT)  defined  as  all 
subjects who received a dose of study drug minus subjects that tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 
days of receiving study drug. The exclusion of subjects with a positive test was however not prespecified 
and does not correspond to the initially defined estimand, which refers to vaccinated subjects regardless 
of infection. In addition, no consistent screening strategy for infections during the study and especially 
for these initial 14 days has been implemented. Since the study was performed during the Omicron wave 
with very high incidences also of asymptomatic cases, it cannot be assumed that all infections have been 
identified. While it can be assumed that both study arms were affected equally by potential infections, 
an overall influence cannot be ruled out. Consequently, respective analyses using a population according 
to the estimand (mITT-2) were requested together with reverse cumulative distribution curves of titres 
Assessment report

Page 127/177 
 
 
 
for the primary endpoint and VOCs. According to the provided responses, there seem to be no or only 
slight differences between the mITT and mITT-2 results. In addition, the requested reverse cumulative 
probability plots (mITT baseline and Day 14) supported the finding of PHH-1V’s failed non-inferiority vs 
Comirnaty  for  D614G  strain,  non-inferior  immune  response  of  PHH-1V  to  Comirnaty  for  Delta  and 
superior  immune  response  of  PHH-1V  over  Comirnaty  for  Beta  and  Omicron,  all  with  regard  to 
neutralizing antibody titres.  
Data for Day 98 was provided only for a subset of subjects (~20% of total subjects). An overall decrease 
of  neutralizing  antibody  titres  was  observed  compared  to  the  Day  14  results.  Notably,  the  results 
indicated  that  neutralizing  antibodies  may  wane  to  a  lesser  degree  in  the  PHH-1V  arm  than  in  the 
Comirnaty arm. Neutralizing antibody responses against D614G strain, Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1 
strain at Day 14, Day 28, Day 98 (subset of 20% of total subjects), and Day 182 were provided. Day 28 
results are fairly similar to those measured on Day 14 with regard to the fact that PHH-1V’s failed non-
inferiority  vs  Comirnaty  for  D614G  strain,  non-inferior  immune  response  of  PHH-1V  to  Comirnaty  for 
Delta, and superior immune response of PHH-1V over Comirnaty for Beta and Omicron. In contrast, the 
Day 182 results, as suggested by Day 98 data, show superior neutralizing immune responses of PHH-1V 
over Comirnaty for D614G strain, Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1, indicative for less waning of PHH-1V-
elicited  immune  responses  compared  to  Comirnaty-elicited  immune  responses.  Still,  the  clinical 
relevance in terms of protections remains unknown. 
The Applicant introduced a new analysis population ‘mITT3’, defined as all subjects in the mITT without 
confirmed COVID-19 infection/s between study treatment and Day 182 visit. Subjects with asymptomatic 
infections are not included in this population due to lack of regular routine testing. Day 182 data shows 
that across all tested strains (D614G strain, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1) nAb GMTs and nAbs GMFRs are 
in both treatment arms higher in the mITT than in the mITT3, highly likely due to increased immune 
responses upon COVID-19 infections.  
Of  the  overall  751  subjects  (mITT/PP  baseline  numbers),  56  included  subjects  were  ≥65  yoa.  This  is 
below  the  targeted  10%  of  the  overall  population.  The  presented  immune  responses  of  the  mITT-2 
population  for  each  tested  variant  are  lower  in  these  56  subjects  compared  to  the  overall  mITT-2 
analyses. Although an overall lower immune response is expected in older subjects compared to younger 
subjects,  the  data  also  revealed  differences  between  treatment  arms.  The  age-related  effect  on  nAb 
GMTs seemed to be more pronounced for PHH-1V compared to Comirnaty. At Day 14, for D614G strain, 
Beta and Delta, the nAb GMTs were considerably lower compared to the Comirnaty arm, while the results 
for all subjects indicated comparable or higher nAb GMTs for the PHH-1V arm (except for D614G strain). 
For Omicron, nAb GMTs in both arms are similar, while in the overall population the GMT was higher in 
the  PHH-1V  arm.  On  the  other  hand,  responder  analysis  of  neutralizing  immune  responses  of  elderly 
subjects indicates largely similar percentages (except for D614G strain) of subjects achieving an at least 
4-fold rise in neutralizing antibodies, which is considered reassuring to some extent as it is indicative for 
a sufficient protection after the booster dose. In contrast to the above mentioned Day 14 results (i.e. 
lower nAb GMTs for D614G strain, Beta and Delta in the PHH-1V arm compared to the Comirnaty arm 
for subjects ≥65 years of age (yoa) while the results for all subjects indicated comparable or higher nAb 
GMTs for the PHH-1V arm (except for D614G strain) and similar nAb GMTs for Omicron in both arms for 
subjects ≥65 yoa while in the overall population the GMT was higher in the PHH-1V arm), the Day 182 
results  showed  higher  nAb  GMTs  in  the  PHH-1V  arm  than  in  the  Comirnaty  arm  for  all  tested  strain 
(D614G strain, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1) in subjects ≥65 yoa. Therefore, it seems that the reduced 
waning of immune responses observed in the PHH-1V arm compared to the Comirnaty arm for both age 
cohorts (<65 yoa, ≥65 yoa) overcomes the initially observed lower neutralizing immune responses in 
subjects ≥65 yoa who received PHH-1V compared to Comirnaty. 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 128/177 
 
 
 
Taken together, the results indicate that neutralizing antibody responses wane to a lesser degree in the 
PHH-1V arm than in the Comirnaty arm across all analysed data sets (mITT, mITT2, mITT3), age cohorts 
(above or below 65 yoa) and strains (D614G strain, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1).  
Day 14 and Day 28 data of subjects who achieved an at least 4-fold rise in nAbs for each variant (D614G 
strain, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1 strains) for study HIPRA-HH-2 shows that the percentages of subjects 
with an at least 4-fold rise in nAbs are fairly similar between the PHH-1V and Comirnaty treatment, in 
particular with regard to Omicron BA.1. 
In addition, very limited data regarding cellular immunogenicity including T-cell-mediated response and 
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response were provided (8 PHH-1V and 7 Comirnaty subjects). Both treatment 
groups showed a significant activation of IFN-γ producing lymphocytes after the in vitro re-stimulation 
with  peptides  pool  of  RBD  (D614G  strain,  Alpha,  Beta  and  Delta  variants)  at  2  weeks  post-boost.  No 
significant  differences  were  observed  between  PHH-1V  and  Comirnaty  groups  when  PBMC  were 
stimulated in vitro with RBD antigens. However, the Comirnaty group showed a higher activation of IFN-
γ  producing  cells  after  the  in  vitro  stimulation  with  the  Spike  (SA  and  SB)  antigens  at  2  weeks  post-
boost while in the PHH-1V  group only showed some activation of IFN-γ producing lymphocytes after the 
in vitro stimulation with the Spike SA antigen and practically no activation with the Spike SB antigen. 
Hence,  the  characterization  of  the  antigen-specific  T  cell  responses  demonstrated  that  the  boost 
immunization with the PHH-1V vaccine induced the activation of CD4+ T cells expressing IFN-γ after re-
stimulation with RBD peptides (from D614G strain sequence and Alpha and Beta variants), even with a 
more potent response compared to the Comirnaty boost. CD4+ IFN-γ+ T cell response was also observed 
after  the  re-stimulation  with  Spike  SA  peptides  in  the  group  vaccinated  with  PHH-1V,  although  no 
activation was elicited by the Spike SB peptides. All these ICS results should be handled with caution, 
since they were studied in a very restricted patient subpopulation. 
Covid-19  infections  were  reported  for  4.1%  after  booster  vaccination  with  PHH-1V  whereas  4.8%  of 
subjects had a Covid-19 infection after booster vaccination with Comirnaty. Further no severe Covid-19 
infections, ICU admissions, ventilation events or deaths related to Covid-19 were reported. 
Supportive Dose-finding Study HH-1 
This FIH dose-finding study evaluated a two-dose primary immunization. The Applicant provided results 
based on PBNA data for the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variant and based on VNA data for Alpha. 
Based on these results, all applied doses (10, 20, and 40 µg) of PHH-1V were immunogenic in the studied 
population aged 18-39, which is indicated by the elicitation of both neutralizing and binding antibodies 
and is further supported by analyses of the cellular immune response. 
The highest dose of 40 µg dose yielded the highest mean values at D35 (i.e. 14 days after second dose) 
across all currently available neutralizing antibody analyses (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta PBNA and 
Alpha  VNA).  Hence,  the  decision  to  apply  the  40 µg  in  further  studies  (e.g.  HH-2)  appears  plausible. 
However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  no  clear  dose-dependent  effect  on  immunogenicity  can  be 
concluded. Furthermore, the dose-finding was not specifically designed for booster vaccination but only 
for primary vaccination. Therefore, there remains some uncertainty whether the chosen dose is indeed 
the most optimal dose for booster vaccination.

Other supportive studies 
Studies  HAN-01  and  HH-10  do  not  provide  informative  data  for  the  current  indication  (primary 
immunization scheme, subjects that received other primary vaccination than mRNA vaccines). 
Study  HH-5  was  mainly  intended  to  assess  safety  aspects  in  a  population  with  broader  immunization 
history (Covid-19 vaccination and infections; approx. 3000 subjects). Immunogenicity was assessed in 
a subset of 230 subjects without prior (symptomatic/detected) Covid-19 infection. This subset mainly 
included  subjects  with  a  primary  immunization  with  two  doses  of  Spikevax.  The  results  are  overall 
comparable  to  the  pivotal  study  and  the  data  in  Spikevax  primed  subjects  was  used  to  justify  the 
indication. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In summary, the provided results are indicative of a superior neutralizing immune responses of PHH-
1V over the active comparator Comirnaty against Omicron BA.1 and Beta, as well as non-inferior 
neutralizing immune response against Delta, 14 days after booster administration. Additionally, long-
term data indicates that antibodies may wane to a lesser degree after PHH-1V administration than 
after Comirnaty administration for subjects above or below 65 years of age and irrespective of the 
virus strain. 
2.5.8.  Clinical safety 
The applicant has provided interim safety data from the clinical studies HIPRA HH-1, HIPRA HH-2, 
HIPRA HH-5, HIPRA HH-10 and HAN-01. 
•  Study HIPRA HH-2 evaluated one vaccination as booster dose (3rd vaccination) of Bimervax 
in comparison to Comirnaty (n=513 for Bimervax and n=252 for Comirnaty). Primary safety 
objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of Bimervax as a booster dose in healthy adult 
subjects fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Comirnaty vaccine. Data cut-off date of 
available interim study report: 17th of February 2022. 
•  Study HIPRA HH-5 evaluated the booster vaccination with Bimervax in subjects with a 
variety of possible primary vaccinations, but primarily included subjects with prior homologous 
Comirnaty (C/C; n=1535) or Spikevax vaccination (S/S; n=561; subject numbers based on 
exposure data from data cut-off on 31st of March 2022, as per data cut-off on 18th of July 
n=2661 subjects were exposed to Bimervax in study HH-5). Primary safety objective: To 
assess the safety and tolerability of Bimervax as a booster dose in healthy adult subjects 
vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Comirnaty, Spikevax, Vaxzevria or JCOVDEN vaccines. 
Data cut-off date of available interim study report: 31st of March 2022. 
•  Study HIPRA HH-10 is designed to investigate the booster vaccination with Bimervax in 
subjects that had received two doses of Vaxzevria as primary vaccination, but the currently 
available interim study report for study HH-10 comprises data for n=25 subjects (n=17 for 
Bimervax and n=8 for Comirnaty). Primary safety objective: To assess the safety and 
tolerability of Bimervax as a booster dose in healthy adult subjects fully vaccinated against 
COVID-19 with the Vaxzevria vaccine. Data cut-off date of available interim study report: 2nd 
of May 2022. Note that no safety data were provided in the interim study report. However, 
safety data for study HH-10 were only provided as part of pooled safety data with comparable 
clinical studies HH-2 and HH-5 (data extraction time 18th of July 2022). More details regarding 
study specific safety results are to be submitted with the final study report.

Subjects were provided with a paper diary to record local and systemic reactions after vaccination from 
Day 0 through Day 7. Unsolicited adverse events (local and systemic) were reported through Day 28. 
Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESIs),  and  medically  attended 
adverse  events  (MAAEs)  were  reported  throughout  the  duration  of  the  studies.  Adverse  events  were 
assessed at each visit based on careful clinical observation of the subject, laboratory tests or spontaneous 
reports by the subject discovered as a result of general questioning by the study staff. All AEs were to 
be  recorded  in  the  eCRF. It  has  to  be noted  that  safety  data  for  studies  HH-1  and  HAN-01  were  also 
submitted, but these studies followed a primary vaccination scheme for Bimervax (i.e., first and second 
dose of COVID-19 vaccine), which is not the vaccination scheme licensed with this procedure. Data of 
these two studies do not essentially contribute to the evaluation of safety for the licensed single booster 
vaccination after primary vaccination scheme with mRNA vaccines but are considered supportive. Thus, 
the  discussion  of  provided  data  is  focused  on  studies  HH-2,  HH-5  and  HH-10  with  in  total  more  than 
3000 subjects exposed to Bimervax. 
•  Study HIPRA HH-1 evaluated two vaccinations as primary immunization (5 subjects for 10µg 
of Bimervax or 10 subjects each arm for 20µg and 40µg of Bimervax compared to Comirnaty). 
Primary safety objective: To assess safety and tolerability of Bimervax in adult healthy 
volunteers. Safety was measured by solicited and unsolicited reactions (local and systemic) 
following each dose vaccination. Data cut-off date of available interim study report: 12th of May 
2022. 
•  Study HAN-01 was a Phase IIb, randomized, controlled, observer-blinded clinical trial to 
evaluate safety and immunogenicity of Bimervax in a total of 256 healthy adults not vaccinated 
previously with any Covid-19 vaccine and without a prior Covid-19 infection. Treatment groups 
received either 2 doses of Bimervax or 2 doses of Comirnaty. Doses were separated 21 days 
for each of the vaccines. Comparative data from active control arms receiving Comirnaty is 
available from Phase I and II studies (HH-1: n=5; HH-2: n=252). Primary safety objective: To 
assess safety and tolerability of Bimervax in healthy adult volunteers. Safety was measured by 
solicited and unsolicited reactions (local and systemic) following each dose vaccination. Data 
cut-off date of available interim study report: 28th of December 2021. Currently limited data 
are provided for this study. 
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The safety population was defined as the number of subjects that received at least one dose of study 
vaccine. 
The overall available dataset for study HIPRA HH-1 (25 subjects exposed to PHH-1V (+5 Comirnaty); 
Two doses of PHH-1V were administered in 5 subjects (10µg + Comirnaty) or 10 subjects each in the 
20µg and 40µg study arms) and study HAN-01 (n=128 subjects exposed to two doses of Bimervax) 
is limited. The submitted data from these studies are not considered sufficient for any conclusion on 
safety of PHH-1V used as primary vaccination.  
Extent of exposure: 
In general, the provided extent of exposure is currently restricted to number of subjects that received 
one (booster in studies HH-2, HH-5, HH-10) and or two vaccinations (HH-1 and HAN-01). Please, 
refer to Table 46 for additional details. Note that study HH-4 is planned with 400 included subjects to 
be exposed to PHH-1V, but currently no data are available for this study.

Duration of follow up 
The Applicant provided information regarding the follow up time in studies HH-2 (cut-off date: 17th of 
February 2022, overall mean 78 days, range 70-92 days) and study HH-5 (data cut-off date: 18th of 
July 2022, a mean of 5.015 months have elapsed since the last participant received the booster dose 
of PHH-1V). Currently no information on safety follow up is available for study HH-10 (data cut-off 
date: 2nd of May 2022). A dedicated safety discussion for study HH-10 will be provided in the final 
study report.

2.5.8.2.  Adverse events 
Data for the dose finding study HIPRA-HH-01 is provided separately as different doses and a distinct 
vaccination scheme were followed (primary vaccination scheme with two doses), in order to provide 
insight in aspects relevant for dose finding. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), solicited local and systemic adverse events as well as 
unsolicited adverse events from studies HIPRA-HH-2, HIPRA-HH-5 and HIPRA-HH-10 are 
presented as pooled safety data with data extraction time 18th of July 2022. Pooled safety data were 
requested as vaccination schemes and applied doses were the same in all three studies. Data from 
individual studies are discussed where considered essential.  
Safety data from study HAN-01 are not presented in detail in this report, due to differences in the 
applied vaccination scheme (two primary vaccinations rather than a booster vaccination) and limited 
data provided. However, safety data relevant for the MA are discussed where needed.

Study HIPRA-HH-1 
Most of the subjects in all study cohorts reported solicited adverse events within 7 days after each 
dose. The majority of adverse event were local. There was no grade 3 solicited adverse events 
reported. The most frequently reported local AE were pain at the injection site or local sensitivity and 
the most frequently reported general AE were headache end fatigue. (Table 53)

Pooled safety data for the booster vaccination with PHH-1V from studies HIPRA-HH-2, 
HIPRA-HH-5 and HIPRA-HH-10 
A total of 9279 TEAEs were reported in 2818 (88.29%) subjects in Studies HH-2, HH-5, and HH-10. 
The most frequently reported events by System Order Class (SOC) (reported by ≥10% subjects) were 
General disorders and administration site conditions (6352 TEAEs reported in 2721 (85.24%) 
subjects), Nervous system disorders (1114 TEAEs in 1034 (32.39%) subjects), Musculoskeletal and 
connective disorders (740 TEAEs in 691 (21.65%) subjects) and Gastrointestinal disorders (531 TEAEs 
in 404 (12.66%) subjects). 
The most frequently reported preferred terms (reported by ≥1% subjects) were injection site pain 
(82.46%), headache (31.39%), fatigue (31.14%), myalgia (20.71%), injection site swelling (7.96%), 
diarrhoea (7.71%), injection site erythema (7.14%), vomiting (5.29%), injection site induration 
(2.32%), pyrexia (1.97%), COVID-19 (1.50%), nausea (1.47%), lymphadenopathy (1.32%) and 
axillary pain (1.28%).  
Solicited local reactions (day 0 through day 7) 
Overall, the majority of solicited local reactions occurred on Day 0 with 4267 events in 2324 (71.81%) 
subjects in Studies HH-2, HH-5, and HH-10. This frequency decreased each day through to Day 7 (Day 
1: 68.08%; Day 2: 33.36%; Day 3: 13.60%; Day 4: 5.80%; Day 5: 2.91%; Day 6: 2.19%; Day 7: 
1.85%). The most frequently reported solicited local reactions from Day 0 to Day 7 were pain and 
tenderness on the vaccine administration site, with 65.48% of subjects experiencing pain and 58.30% 
of subjects experiencing tenderness on Day 0 and decreasing to 1.22% and 1.38%, respectively, on 
Day 7. Please, refer to Table 55 for additional details.

Solicited systemic events (day 0 through day 7) 
On Day 0, the overall number of solicited systemic events was 1528 in 890 (27.88%) subjects in 
Studies HH-2, HH-5, and HH-10. The percentage of subjects with solicited systemic adverse events on 
Day 1 was 31.64%, 18.11 % on Day 2 and 5.51% on Day 7. The most frequently reported solicited 
systemic event from Day 0 through to Day 7 was fatigue. Overall, the percentage of subjects who 
reported fatigue was 17.26% on Day 0, 19.24% on Day 1, 10.43% on Day 2, 6.23% on Day 3, 4.73% 
on Day 4, 4.51% on Day 5, 3.67% on Day 6, and 2.76% on Day 7.

Unsolicited events (day 0 through day 28) 
Overall, 1019 unsolicited local and systemic adverse events were reported in 711 (22.27%) subjects in 
Studies HH-2, HH-5, and HH-10. The most frequently reported unsolicited local and systemic adverse 
event was COVID-19 with 48 events in 48 (1.50%) subjects. Other frequently reported unsolicited 
local and systemic adverse events reported in ≥1% of subjects included lymphadenopathy (42 events 
in 42 [1.32%] subjects), headache (48 events in 41 [1.28%] subjects) and axillary pain (45 events in 
41 [1.28%] subjects).

There were 341 AESIs in 340 (10.65%) subjects in Studies HH-2, HH-5, and HH-10. The most 
frequently reported AESI was COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 test positive: 227 cases in 7.11% and 95 
cases in 2.98% of subjects. Only COVID-19 cases occurring ≥ 14 days post vaccination and throughout 
the duration of the study were considered as AESIs. There were no severe COVID-19 cases. 
Furthermore, two cases of urticaria were reported as well as one case of asymptomatic Covid-19, 
pericarditis and thrombocytopenia each. No AESI was reported for study HH-1 and one AESI 
(appendicitis) was reported for study HAN-01. Note that definitions of AESI might deviate from above 
mentioned pooled studies. However, no details are currently provided for study HAN-01.

MAAEs 
Overall, there were 295 MAAEs in 226 (7.08%) subjects in Studies HH-2, HH-5, and HH-10. The most 
frequently reported MAAE was infections and infestations (123 events in 111 [3.48%] subjects). Other 
frequently reported MAAEs with reported frequencies ≥0,5% included Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders (30 events in 23 [0.72%] subjects) and Injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications (20 events in 20 [0.63%] subjects). 
2.5.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study HH-1:  
No SAEs (including death) have been reported in this study. 
Study HH-2:  
A total of four subjects have reported SAEs in this study, from which 3 were in the PHH-1V group. No 
death has been reported in this study.  
Details on the SAEs are provided as follows:  
A 60-69 year-old subject experienced myocardial infarction around 6 weeks after vaccination 
• 
with PHH-1V. The subject had a history of arterial hypertension and dyslipidaemia, as well as 
pulmonary bullae, and gastric ulcer. The event resolved after treatment (stent implantation) and was 
rated without reasonable possibility of relatedness to the vaccine. 
One SAE of acute pyelonephritis (moderate intensity) was reported in a 20-29-year-old subject 
• 
more than 2 months after vaccination with PHH-1V. The event resolved 10 days after start of the 
event. No reasonable possibility of relatedness to the vaccine was concluded. 
One SAE of transient ischemic attack was reported on the Comirnaty vaccine arm in a 70-79-
• 
year-old subject around 3 months after booster vaccination with PHH-1V. The event was considered 
mild in intensity and resolved 1 week after start of the event. No reasonable possibility of relatedness 
to the vaccine was concluded. 
A 50-59-year-old subject was involved in an accident (>5 months from vaccination with PHH-
• 
V1) resulting in multiple rib fractures and clavicular left fracture, a pulmonary contusion left upper lobe 
and simple left renal cyst rupture. The event was considered potentially life threatening but is reported 
as resolving/recovering. No reasonable possibility of relatedness to the vaccine was concluded. 
Study HH-5:  
A total of ten subjects reported SAEs (including one death) in study HH-5.  
A 20-29-year-old subject died 2 days after vaccination with PHH-1V due to a road traffic 
• 
accident. The death was considered unrelated to the administration of PHH 1V.  
A 30-39-year-old subject experienced a grade 2 pericarditis 14 days after vaccination with 
• 
PHH-1V. The event was of moderate intensity and was considered not resolved at the data cut off of 
the interim report. The event was considered as possible related to vaccination by the investigator 
assessment.  
A 20-29-year-old subject had a serious event of food allergy one week after receiving PHH-1V. 
• 
The event was considered potentially life threatening, without reasonable possibility to be related to 
the vaccination and was resolved one day after start of the event.

A 20-29-year-old female  had an acute abdomen ovarian endometrioma with symptoms 
• 
starting 5 days after vaccination with PHH-1V. The event was considered severe in intensity, without 
reasonable possibility to be related to the vaccine. The event was resolved around 2 months after start 
of the event.  
A 30-39-year-old subject had a vestibular syndrome 21 days after vaccination The event was 
• 
considered severe in intensity, without reasonable possibility to be related to the vaccine and the event 
outcome was resolved around 3 months after start of the event.  
A 50-59-year-old subject had a right ankle ligament injury around 2 months after receiving 
• 
PHH-1V. The event was reported as mild in intensity, without reasonable possibility to be related to the 
vaccine and was considered recovered/resolved 2 days after the event has started 
A 20-29-year-old subject had a recurrent shoulder dislocations 80 days after vaccination. The 
• 
event was reported as mild in intensity, without reasonable possibility to be related to the vaccine and 
the outcome was recovered 8 days after start of the event. 
A 40-49-year-old subject had a dilated cardiomyopathy with severe ventricular dysfunction 
• 
starting more than 3 months after vaccination. The event was reported as potentially life-threatening 
and without reasonable possibility to be related to the vaccine. The subject has been discharged from 
the hospital and the event is ongoing at the cut-off date of the latest report  
A 30-39-year-old subject had gonococcal urethritis starting 2 months after vaccination. The 
• 
event was reported as mild in intensity, without reasonable possibility to be related to the vaccine and 
recovered/resolved 2 days after the event has started. 
A 30-39-year-old subject had an anaphylaxis approximately 3 months after vaccination. The 
• 
event was reported as life-threatening and without reasonable possibility to be related to the vaccine 
and resolved the same day it started. 
Study HH-10 
No SAEs (including death) have been reported in this study. 
HAN-01 
Two subjects reported SAEs after exposure to PHH-1V, one subject with vestibular disorder and one 
subject with appendicitis. None of the cases was considered product related. No death was reported in 
the study. 
2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
No laboratory data following vaccination with PHH-1V was provided from study HIPRA HH-1. Only pre-
randomization data was provided.  
Regarding study HIPRA HH-2, the Applicant stated that no clinically significant findings in Haematology 
and Vital signs were observed. Three events were observed regarding Biochemistry parameters: 1 in 
the PHH-1V group (hypoglycaemia) and 2 in the Comirnaty group (transaminase increase). 
In Study HIPRA HH-5, the Applicant states that no noteworthy changes or trends occurred in 
haematology or biochemistry laboratory evaluations. Furthermore, it is stated that no clinically 
significant vital sign measurement (with data cut-off date on 31st of March) was observed among the 
subjects during the period of the current study report  
For study HIPRA HH-10 no listing of abnormal laboratory values was provided. The respective listing is 
expected with the final study report.

No pattern of concern was identified from currently reported data (data cut-off date of interim study 
report 28th of December 2021) for study HAN-01 regarding subjects with clinically significant changes 
in laboratory parameters. 
2.5.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
No data in special populations including hepatic impairment, renal impairment, pregnant or lactating 
women or in immunocompromised individuals is currently available. Of note, classical hepatically and 
renally impaired participants are not expected to have different pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure to the 
product due to the type of active substance (protein antigen) and its expected PK profile (lack of 
systemic exposure or metabolism by cytochromes, for example). Use in immunocompromised patients 
is considered missing information in the RMP and will be addressed via additional pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
Elderly population 
Safety data for the elderly population 65 years of age and older were provided for studies HH-2 and 
HH-5. Detailed safety data from study HH-10 are still awaited with the final study report, but it is 
noted that the reported maximum age in the study group treated with PHH-1V was 65 years. During 
study HH-2 in total 56 subjects ≥65 years were followed (n=38 received PHH-1V and n=18 received 
Comirnaty) and during study HH-5 in total 22 subjects ≥65 years were followed (all received PHH-1V). 
The Applicant provided safety findings for elderly subjects in studies HH-2 and HH-5  Table 58.  
Table 58 Summary of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) – elderly population ≥65 
years (safety population; study HIPRA-HH-2 and HIPRA-HH-5) 
The most common SOC in both studies was General disorders and administration site conditions with 
68 TEAEs in 39 subjects (69.6%) in HIPRA-HH-2 and 30 events in 13 (59.09%) subjects in HIPRA-HH-
5 (principally pain at the injection site), which was followed by Nervous system disorders in both 
studies (5 events in 5 subjects (13.2%) and 3 events in 3 subjects (13.64%) in study HH-2 and HH-5 
respectively). The AEs were mild or moderate. No severe TEAEs were reported. 
Safety pooled data by age subgroups (below 65 years, 65-74 years, 75-84 years and above 84) was 
provided as shown in the Table 59. 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 148/177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 88.63%, 71,70% and 83.33% of the participants aged below 65 years of age, 65-74 and 75-
84 reported TEAEs. No TEAE was reported in 1 subject aged older than 84.  
2760 TEAEs were reported in 43 subjects (76.8%), corresponding to 58 TEAEs in 28 (73.7%) subjects 
in the PHH-1V group and 36 events in 15 subjects (83.3%) in the Comirnaty group. In HIPRA-HH-5 40 
events were reported in 15 (68.18%) elderly subjects. Majority of the TEAEs were non serious and 
none of them lead to drop out from the study (Table 59). 
TEAEs considered related to vaccination by age group are described in Table 59.

2.5.8.6.  Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Pregnant or lactating women or women intending to become pregnant or planning to breastfeed during 
the study have been excluded from participation in clinical studies. No cases of inadvertent exposure to 
Bimervax during pregnancy or breastfeeding have been reported in the clinical studies up to the cut-off 
dates submitted in this MAA. Use in pregnancy and lactation is listed as missing information in the RMP 
and will be addressed via additional pharmacovigilance activities. Administration of Bimervax during 
pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the 
mother and foetus. 
2.5.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed and the concomitant administration of PHH-1V with other 
vaccines has not been studied. Interaction with other vaccines will be followed as part of the RMP. 
2.5.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study HIPRA HH-2 (cut-off date 18th July 2022), there were a total of 4 subjects who prematurely 
discontinued from the study, 3 of them after PHH-1V and 1 subject after Comirnaty. Reasons for 
discontinuation are currently unknown and are expected be provided with the final study report.  
In study HIPRA HH-5 (cut-off 31st March 2022), a total of 4 subjects prematurely discontinued 
participation in the study, all of them in the PHH-1V study group. Reasons for subject premature 
discontinuation included no attendance on Day 14 visit, refusal to continue in the study, traffic accident 
and withdrawal of consent.  
Overall, no concerns arise from the reported discontinuations in studies HIPRA HH-2 and HIPRA HH-5. 
A full list of discontinuations is expected in the final clinical study report of all clinical studies.

2.5.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
There’s no post-marketing data for this vaccine. 
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Interim safety data are available from a two-dose primary vaccination (i.e., first and second 
vaccination with PHH-1V) in studies HH-1 and HAN-01 as well as from booster vaccination (i.e., third 
vaccination) in studies HH-2, HH-5 and HH-10. Upon request the Applicant clarified that beyond the 
first week after vaccination, adverse events were collected at the investigational site during subject 
visits on days 14 and 28 via anamnesis that covered the periods from days 0-14 and days 14-28. No 
diary documentation was required for participants beyond day 7, but participants have been 
encouraged and reminded to report any AE at the time of their occurrence at any point during the 
study. Any reported AE was registered in the eCRF.  
The MAA at hand addresses a booster dose in previously immunised subjects and thus this assessment 
is focused on clinical studies that followed a respective patient population (i.e., from studies HH-2, HH-
5 and HH-10). Currently available interim data for study HH-10 comprise n=25 subjects (n=17 for 
PHH-1V and n=8 for Comirnaty), which is not considered sufficient for robust conclusions. Thus, data 
from this study are pooled with data from studies HH-2 and HH-5 to allow for robust conclusions from 
>3000 subjects exposed to PHH-1V as booster vaccination. The main data relevant for the assessment 
of safety are considered to derive from studies HH-2 (n=513 subjects exposed to PHH-1V) and HH-5 
(n=2646 subjects exposed to PHH-1V, mostly subjects that received Comirnaty/Comirnaty with 
n=1535 or Spikevax/Spikevax with n=561 as primary vaccination; numbers refer to data cut-off from 
31st of March 2022). Therefore, the assessment of data will concentrate to a large proportion on data 
reported for these two studies. Upon request the Applicant provided pooled safety data for subjects 
that were boosted with PHH-1V in studies HH-2, HH-5 and HH-10. Treatment related AEs for pooled 
safety data (i.e., pooled safety data for the booster vaccination with PHH-1V from clinical studies HH-2, 
HH-5 and HH-10) are also reported in the SmPC. 
Provided interim information are to be complemented in future clinical study report submissions.  In 
study HH-5, 2646 subjects received one dose of PHH-1V (as per data cut-off from 31st of March 2022; 
data cut-off from 18th of July reports 2661 subjects exposed to PHH-1V in study HH-5). The number of 
subjects older than 65 years of age (n=38 for PHH-1V and n=18 for Comirnaty in study HH-2 and 
n=22 for study HH-5) and ≥16 to <18 years (n=36 in study HH-5) is limited but considered 
acceptable. Applicant provided the requested AE data from the studies HH-2 and HH-5 specific for the 
elderly population. No trends of AE frequencies in favour of the population below or above 65 years can 
be drawn from the provided data. This also means that the safety of PHH-1V might not be worse in the 
elderly subgroup than in the subgroup below 65 years. However, the number and percentage of 
patients between 65 and 74 yoa are low and those of patients below 75 and 84 yoa is very low. Thus, 
the above-mentioned findings must be handled with caution. It is further recognized that more female 
subjects were included in study HH-2 (i.e., approximately 37% male and 63% female) and slightly 
more male subjects were included in study HH-5 (52.5% male and 47.5% female). The imbalance in 
gender is comparable for both treatment groups in study HH-2. This minimal imbalance in gender is 
not considered to affect the interpretation of study results. In total 4 subjects prematurely 
discontinued from study HH-2 after study drug exposure (3 subjects after PHH-1V and 1 subject after 
Comirnaty, referred to the available interim study report with data cut-off on 18th of July). Reasons for 
discontinuation are currently unclear, but low numbers do not raise a concern. Still, reasons are 
expected to be provided with the final study report. The Applicant clarified that other participants 
discontinued before drug exposure mainly because no valid vaccination certificate could be provided for 
study participation. Four (0.15%) subjects prematurely discontinued participation in study HH-5 (all 
Assessment report

subjects in this study were vaccinated with PHH-1V). Reasons for subject premature discontinuation 
included no attendance on Day 14, refusal to continue in the study, traffic accident, and withdrawal of 
consent (referred to the available interim study report for HH-5 with data cut-off on 31st of March). No 
concerns arise from reported discontinuations. 
Study HH-5 was a single-arm study (all subjects received PHH-1V) and thus, no direct comparison 
within study HH-5 is given. To facilitate contextualisation of the data, frequencies are being compared 
to study HH-2. Individual study results as well as provided pooled safety data across clinical studies 
HH-2, HH-5 and HH-10 are discussed in the following. TEAEs are defined as adverse events that 
started on or after the date of study treatment administration until 28 days thereafter. Participants 
were observed for at least 28 days, allowing an assessment of the data. According to the most actual 
study report for study HH-2 (i.e. v.4.0) with safety data cut-off date on 17th of February 2022 (as 
clarified by the Applicant this date is distinct from the depicted data cut-off date 18th of July, which 
only refers to an update of immunogenicity data;), a total of 2642 TEAEs were reported in 696 
(91.0%) subjects, including 1581 TEAEs in 458 (89.3%) subjects that received the PHH-1V vaccine 
and 1061 TEAEs in 238 (94.4%) subjects that received the Comirnaty vaccine. No pattern of concern is 
identified from reported numbers in TEAEs when comparing events reported for PHH-1V to events 
reported for Comirnaty in study HH-2. In fact, events for PHH-1V appear to be generally milder 
compared to events in association with Comirnaty as booster vaccine (i.e., milder, but less moderate 
and severe TEAEs for the PHH-1V treatment group compared to the Comirnaty treatment group). In 
total 7552 TEAEs are reported in 2337 subjects (of n=2661 exposed subjects) that received a booster 
vaccination with PHH-1V during study HH-5 as per data cut-off on 18th of July. The frequency in  total 
number of TEAEs is comparable in HH-5 (87.82%) and HH-2 (89.3%) and is slightly lower compared to 
Comirnaty in study HH-2 (94.4%; values refer to data-cut on 18th of July 2022). For pooled safety 
data overall 9279 TEAEs in 2818 subjects and 8639 related TEAEs in 2778 subjects were reported from 
3192 subjects that received PHH-1V as a booster vaccine during studies HH-2, HH-5 and HH-10 (i.e., 
88.3% and 87% for TEAEs and related TEAEs, respectively). Of those, 7651 TEAEs were reported as 
mild in intensity in 1909 (59.81%) subjects, 1540 TEAEs were reported as moderate in intensity in 847 
(26.54%) subjects, 87 TEAEs were reported as severe in intensity in 61 (1.91%) subjects, and 1 TEAE 
was reported as missing in 1 (0.03%) subject.  
Considering the classification of AEs by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) in 
study HH-2, gastrointestinal disorders (13.3% vs. 8.3% for PHH-1V and Comirnaty, respectively) as 
well as respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3.3% vs. 1.6% for PHH-1V and Comirnaty, 
respectively) are the only two categories of system organ class with higher incidences in the PHH-1V 
group compared to subjects treated with Comirnaty. Most pronounced appear differences in PT 
diarrhoea (7.2% vs. 2.4% for PHH-1V and Comirnaty, respectively), cough (1% vs. 0% for PHH-1V 
and Comirnaty, respectively) and oropharyngeal pain (1% vs. 0% for PHH-1V and Comirnaty, 
respectively). Besides these SOCs, also asthenia (1.8% vs. 1.2% for PHH-1V and Comirnaty, 
respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (1% vs. 0.4% for PHH-1V and Comirnaty, respectively), 
nausea (5.8% vs. 5.2% for PHH-1V and Comirnaty, respectively) and vomiting (1.9% vs. 1.2% for 
PHH-1V and Comirnaty, respectively) are reported PTs with slightly higher incidences for booster with 
PHH-1V. Most outstanding differences in PT as reported in study HH-5 and compared to study HH-2 are 
evident for malaise (20.26% of subjects in study HH-5, but none reported in study HH-2 for PHH-1V or 
Comirnaty), injection site swelling (9.56% in study HH-5, 0.6% for PHH-1V in HH-2 and 2.8% for 
Comirnaty in HH-2), injection site induration (1.21% in HH-5, 8.6% for PHH-1V in HH-2 and 17.1% for 
Comirnaty in HH-2), nausea (none in HH-5, 5.8% for PHH-1V in HH-2 and 5.2% for Comirnaty in HH-
2), vomiting (5.93% in HH-5, 1.9% for PHH-1V in HH-2 and 1.2% for Comirnaty in HH-2) and myalgia 
(1.81% in HH-5, 19.5% for PHH-1V in HH-2 and 34.1% for Comirnaty in HH-2; reported data refer to 
frequencies as reported in the currently provided interim study reports with data cut-off 18th of July 
for study HH-2 and 31st of March for study HH-5).

For the first two days of the 7-day observation period for solicited systemic events after booster 
vaccination in study HH-2 the total number of events is higher for the group vaccinated with 
Comirnaty. Only diarrhoea was reported with higher incidences for the PHH-1V treatment group 
throughout the observation period of 7 days. However, starting with day 3 post-vaccination the total 
number of events is higher for the group treated with PHH-1V and remains higher until day 7. Still, 
principally less subjects are affected by solicited systemic AEs after booster vaccination with PHH-1V 
compared to those vaccinated with Comirnaty (with diarrhoea as an exception with mildly higher 
incidences after PHH-1V). Upon request the Applicant confirmed that the mean duration of headache 
and fever was 0.2 days longer for both events in subjects after vaccination with PHH-1V compared to 
the mean duration after vaccination with Comirnaty. Importantly, the general proportion of subjects 
reporting headache or fever was higher after vaccination with Comirnaty compared to vaccination with 
PHH-1V. Generally, a lower rate of subjects was affected by solicited systemic AEs after booster 
vaccination with PHH-1V compared to those vaccinated with Comirnaty. The only exception appears to 
be diarrhoea with slightly higher incidences after PHH-1V. Potentially longer duration of events after 
PHH-1V compared to Comirnaty (e.g., 0.2 days for headache and fever) does not indicate a major 
safety concern. Similar conclusions regarding solicited local and solicited systemic event apply when 
considering primary vaccination (with a focus on Comirnaty/Comirnaty and Spikevax/Spikevax, due to 
low subject numbers for other subgroups) and time since last primary Covid-19 vaccination as 
assessed during study HH-5. Still, it appears that more subjects that followed the primary 
Spikevax/Spikevax vaccination tended to report solicited local and systemic events, but numbers do 
not give rise to concern. No major discrepancies were identified for subjects with >3 to ≤6 month or 
>6 to ≤12 months elapsed time since the last primary vaccination (data for ≤3 months and >12 
months are limited). 
The proportion of subjects taking pain medication and/or antipyretics during study HH-2 as well as the 
amount of such medication was proportionally higher for the Comirnaty group (44% and 25.14% of 
subjects after booster with Comirnaty and PHH-1V, respectively). A very comparable pattern in the use 
of concomitant medication is seen from provided information for study HH-5. No concerns arise from 
reported concomitant medication from studies HH-2 and HH-5. 
Throughout the 7-day observation period for solicited local reactions after booster vaccination, no 
event (i.e., erythema/redness, induration/swelling, pain and tenderness) was reported with higher 
incidences for subjects treated with PHH-1V compared to subjects treated with Comirnaty during study 
HH-2. Similar as observed for solicited systemic events, also for solicited local reactions it appears that 
local reactions were more frequently reported in study HH-5 during the first days compared to study 
HH-2 (most striking in pain and tenderness). However, this difference is not present in following days 
of observation. Importantly, the general reporting of solicited local reactions is lower for PHH-1V in 
study HH-5 than for Comirnaty in HH-2 and does not indicate any major safety concern. 
Data as reported in study HH-2 regarding unsolicited systemic and local adverse events indicate lower 
incidences for PHH-1V compared to Comirnaty and do not give reason of concern. However, a 
substantially lower frequency is reported in study HH-5 (18.59% and 28.8% for PHH-1V in study HH-5 
and study HH-2, respectively). Upon request the Applicant clarified that the main cause for the overall 
higher frequency of unsolicited adverse events in study HH-2 is the higher rate of Covid-19 infections 
that occurred during the study time compared to study HH-5. Fluctuation in infection waves across the 
population of study HH-2 and HH5 can be agreed as reason for the discrepancy between both studies. 
It is noted that Covid-19 infection beyond 14 days after vaccination were considered an AESI and not 
as an unsolicited systemic event. Similar conclusions regarding unsolicited local and unsolicited 
systemic events apply when considering primary vaccination subgroups (with a focus on 
Comirnaty/Comirnaty and Spikevax/Spikevax, due to low subject numbers for other subgroups) and 
time since last primary Covid-19 vaccination as assessed during study HH-5.

With respect to pooled safety data Medically Attended Adverse Events were mostly reported for SOC 
Infections and infestations (in 3.48% of subjects across the three pooled studies). No other SOC was 
reported in more than 1% of subjects (next most frequent SOC was Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders in 0.72% of subjects) and the most frequently reported PTs were Covid-19 (0.53% of 
subjects), nasopharyngitis (in 0.38% of subjects) and urinary tract infection (in 0.31% of subjects). No 
concerns arise from reported MAAEs. Adverse events of special interest were reported in 10.65% of 
subjects across the three pooled studies and were mostly related to Covid-19 infections (7.11% with 
reported Covid-19, 2.09% with SARS-CoV-2 test positive and 0.03% with asymptomatic Covid-19). It 
is noted that Covid-19 infections happening before day 14 were considered as adverse events only and 
not as AESI. Covid-19 infections are also discussed further in the section regarding clinical efficacy. 
Urticaria was reported in 2 subjects and single events of pericarditis and thrombocytopenia were also 
reported. No concerns arise from reported AESIs (pooled safety data refer to data cut-off on 18th of 
July 2022). 
No death was reported during study HH-2 and 1 death in study HH-5 was considered unrelated to the 
administration of PHH 1V (traffic accident). No concerns arise from reported fatal events. Serious 
adverse events were generally rare in clinical studies HH-2 (n=3 subjects that received PHH-1V 
reported with narrative from >500 subjects exposed to PHH-1V) and HH-5 (n=9 subjects with 
narratives and one subject reported dead during study from >2600 exposed subjects). Currently, 
occurred SAEs are too limited to robustly conclude on study vaccine related cases. However, since the 
casual relationship between the vaccination with Bimervax and pericarditis cannot be excluded, the 
Applicant agreed to include pericarditis in section 4.8. of the SmPC. Post-authorisation safety measures 
for close monitoring of the occurrence of pericarditis/myocarditis as proposed by the Applicant 
(defining them as AESIs, further characterization  in the PASS  and inclusion as important 
identified/potential risks in the safety concerns of the RMP) are agreed and endorsed. 
No concerns arise from reported laboratory findings. Measurements that were detected as AEs (in total 
38 events during study HH-5 from >2600 subjects that exposed to PHH-1V) do not give rise to 
conclude any pattern that might indicate a major risk upon booster vaccination with PHH-1V (3 grade 3 
events, all of which considered unrelated and of distinct character, and no grade 4 event). Similarly, 
the lack of clinically significant findings regarding vital sign measures also supports this impression (as 
per data cut-off on 31st of March 2022). 
A major objection had been raised during the procedure regarding high level of residual host cell 
proteins, which was also considered concerning from a safety perspective with respect to CHO HCP 
specific antibodies. For addressing the MO from a clinical perspective, the Applicant randomly selected 
study participants from trials HH-5 and HH-2 to test serum samples for immunogenicity against CHO 
HCP, i.e., IgG antibody detection with the ELISA VM-859-00 in serum samples. Provided data do not 
indicate any significant rise in IgG antibody titres against CHO HCP in serum samples of subjects 
vaccinated with PHH-1V during studies HH-2 and HH-5 (i.e., single booster vaccination). Importantly, 
the reliability of measures provided by the used VM-859-00 assay are questioned due to uncertainties 
regarding crucial aspects of the provided assay validation. Furthermore, it is also noted that it appears 
more appropriate to evaluate the presence and levels of IgG antibodies after repeated exposure to the 
vaccine (e.g., studies HAN-01 and/or the extension period of study HH-2 would appear more suitable 
for this approach). In summary, from a clinical perspective submitted data were not considered 
adequate to address the raised concern regarding potential immunogenicity of HCPs. This is mainly 
based on the issues raised regarding the assay used for determination of immune response against 
HCP. Based on theoretical considerations, an immune response against HCP would not be unexpected. 
The applicant was therefore asked to provide a risk assessment to estimate in how far a potential 
immune response against HCP contained in PHH-1V is of clinical relevance. For this risk assessment, 
the results of the characterisation of HCP content as requested in the quality section, should be

considered. The Applicant committed to perform the requested in-depth characterization of the 
qualitative HCP profile including a full risk evaluation of identified HCPs and to submit results within 2 
months post-approval (REC7). 
2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the currently available data PHH-1V appears to be less reactogenic compared to Comirnaty. 
Gastrointestinal disorders (especially diarrhoea) seem to occur more frequently in the PHH1V group. 
Headache and fever occur with longer duration in the PHH-1V group (i.e. 0.2 days longer compared to 
Comirnaty). Data from study HH-5 on a higher number of subjects generally confirm results from study 
HH-2. Pooled safety data are reported from studies HH-10, HH-2 and HH-5. 
It is noted that the vaccine contains a high level of residual host cell proteins (HCP). Based on 
theoretical considerations, an immune response against HCP would not be unexpected. The applicant 
was therefore asked to provide a risk assessment to estimate in how far a potential immune response 
against HCP contained in PHH-1V is of clinical relevance. For this risk assessment, the results of the 
characterisation of HCP content as requested in the quality section, should be considered. The 
Applicant committed to submit results of an in-depth characterization of the qualitative HCP profile 
including a full risk evaluation of identified HCPs within 2 months post-approval.

2.6.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.0 acceptable. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2.  Labelling exemptions  
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the 
labelling flexibilities described in the Questions and Answers on labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 
vaccines (EMA/689080/2020 rev.3) document which aims at facilitating the preparedness work of 
COVID-19 vaccine developers and the associated logistics of early printing packaging activities. 
EU packaging specific derogations 
Outer and immediate packaging in EN only  
Outer and immediate labelling will be provided in English only for all EU Member States (MSs), as well 
as Norway and Iceland. The labelling flexibility is granted until end of September 2023. 
English only printed package leaflet  
If required, EN printed package leaflet (PL) will be supplied to EU MSs, including Norway and Iceland. 
Except for those countries that require it in their national language as per labelling Q&A. The applicant 
plans to provide electronic and downloadable national translations of the Package Leaflet for other 
Member States/languages via a QR code. The labelling flexibility is granted until end of September 
2023. 
Omission of the Blue Box information on the outer carton  
Due to the use of one unified EN packing across all the EU countries, the Blue Box will not be displayed 
on the outer carton. The labelling flexibility is granted until end of September 2023. The information,

normally provided in the market specific packaging Blue Box area of the carton, will be provided as an 
electronic version on the website (via the QR code/URL) 
2.8.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and the package leaflet for the purpose of providing 
information to Healthcare Professionals and vaccine recipients has been submitted by the applicant and 
has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: 
Statutory information 
• Approved regulatory information, including the Package Leaflet (PL) and Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC);  
• Vaccination card; 
• Blue Box information as required by each Member State. 
2.8.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004,) COVID-19 Vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 
1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The clinical manifestation of 
COVID-19 is non-specific and variable. It can range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe 
pneumonia and death. The disease burden is highest amongst subjects with increased age; however, 
all age groups are susceptible. Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised 
status, cancer, and obesity are considered risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
At the time of authorisation of this vaccine, several products have received marketing authorisation for 
the treatment of COVID-19. These encompass antiviral therapy (PF-07321332 / ritonavir, remdesivir), 
anti-inflammatory therapy (dexamethasone), IL-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab), IL-1 inhibitor (anakinra) as 
well as monoclonal antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (casirivimab/imdevimab, 
regdanvimab, sotrovimab and tixagevimab / cilgavimab). These therapies have shown variable efficacy 
depending on the severity and duration of illness as well as against different variants of concern. 
Additionally, there are 7 approved vaccines for active immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 aiming to 
prevent COVID-19 disease: Comirnaty (EMEA/H/C/005735), Spikevax (EMEA/H/C/005791), Vaxzevria 
Assessment report

(EMEA/H/C/005675), Jcovden (EMEA/H/C/005737), Nuvaxovid (EMEA/H/C/005808), COVID-19 
Vaccine (inactivated, adjuvanted) Valneva (EMEA/H/C/006019) and VidPrevtyn Beta 
(EMEA/H/C/005754). The mRNA vaccines include in their marketing authorisation adapted Omicron 
vaccines. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical programme to develop PHH-1V consists of several trials from which interim reports of five 
studies have been submitted to support the use of this vaccine as a booster:  
Study HH-1, Study HH-2, Study HH-5, Study HAN-01 and Study HH-10. Study HH-2, Study HH-5, and 
Study HH-10 are currently still ongoing, Study HH-1 reached the 1-year follow-up in August 2022, 
HAN-01 is completed. 
Study HH-2 is currently considered as the pivotal study for this application. It is a double-blind, 
randomized (2:1), active controlled (comparator Comirnaty 30 µg), multi-centre (10 sites in Spain), 
non-inferiority trial to evaluate immunogenicity and safety of a single PHH-1V dose (40 µg) as a 
booster vaccination (3rd dose) in adults (18 yoa or older, at least 10% >65 years) who previously 
received primary vaccination with Comirnaty. 252 individuals 18 yoa or older received one dose of 
Comirnaty, 513 individuals 18 yoa or older old received one dose of Bimervax. 
All other studies are considered supportive: 
•  Study HH-5 is a phase III open label study to assess a booster vaccination in approx. 3000 
subjects with different vaccination/Covid-19 infection history. The study is mainly focussed on 
safety but also includes an immunogenicity assessment in currently 230 subjects (approx. 250 
planned) 
•  Study HH-1 is a Phase 1/2a, FIH dose-finding study for a two-dose primary immunization in 30 
healthy adults aged 18-39. Study HH-1 is not considered suitable to support a claim for a 
booster dose since a primary immunization schedule was evaluated and in addition, the 
number of subjects enrolled is limited.  
•  Study HAN-01 is a completed phase IIb study, for a two-dose primary immunization in adult 
healthy volunteers in Vietnam. Like study HH-1, this study is not considered suitable to support 
a claim for a booster dose since a primary immunization schedule was evaluated. 
•  Study HH-10 is a Phase IIb study to assess immunogenicity and safety of a booster vaccination 
with PHH-1V in adults fully vaccinated with adenovirus vaccine. Currently the data is too 
limited (25 subjects vaccinated) to support any such claim. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary endpoint 
For the D614G strain, the GMT ratio on Days 14 and 28 was 1.71 and 1.33 respectively, which does 
not meet the non-inferiority criteria. On Day 98, the GMT ratio was 0.88 which meets the non-
inferiority criteria and the GMT ratio on Day 182 was 0.62 which meets the superiority criteria. 
Secondary endpoints 
For the Beta variant, the GMT ratios on Day 14 of 0.62, on Day 28 of 0.65, on Day 98 of 0.58 and on 
Day 182 of 0.70 all meet the superiority criteria.  
For the Delta variant the GMT ratios on Day 14 of 1.02, and on Day 28 of 0.89 meet the non-inferiority 
criteria. The GMT ratios on Day 98 of 0.52 and on Day 182 of 0.55 meet the superiority criteria.  
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 167/177 
 
 
 
 
For Omicron BA.1, the GMT ratios on Day 14 of 0.60, on Day 28 of 0.66, on Day 98 of 0.60 and on Day 
182 of 0.76 meet superiority criteria.  
Furthermore, at Day 182 the analysis was performed with the mITT3 (excluding the population with 
confirmed COVID-19 infections). For the D614G strain the GMT ratio was 0.54. For Beta, the GMT ratio 
was 0.54. For Delta the GMT ratio was 0.43 and for Omicron BA.1 the GMT ratio was 0.56. 
Consequently, all tested strains meet superiority criteria. 
Among the secondary endpoints, the fold rise in neutralising antibody titres against all strains was also 
tested and the GMFR ratio calculated.  
For the D614G strain, the GMFR ratios on Days 14 and 28 were 1.83 and 1.43 and did not meet the 
non-inferiority criteria. On Day 98, the GMFR ratio was 0.90 which meets the non-inferiority criteria 
and the GMFR ratio on Day 182 was 0.66 which meets the superiority criteria.  
For the Beta variant, the GMFR ratio on Day 14 of 0.70, on Day 28 of 0.74, on Day 98 of 0.65 and on 
Day 182 of 0.78 all meet the superiority criteria.  
For the Delta variant the GMFR ratio on Day 14 of 1.12, and on Day 28 of 0.98 meet the non-inferiority 
criteria. The GMFR ratio on Day 98 of 0.59 and on Day 182 of 0.60 meet the superiority criteria.   
For Omicron BA.1, the GMFR ratio on Day 14 of 0.69, on Day 28 of 0.76 meet superiority criteria. The 
GMFR ratio on Day 98 of 0.71 and on Day 182 of 0.87 meet non-inferiority criteria  
The heterologous boost with Bimervax, after a primary immunization with Comirnaty, elicited a Th1-
CD4+ T cell response, more potent than the response induced by the homologous boost with 
Comirnaty, and a CD8+ T cell response specific against RBD. 
Exploratory endpoints 
A total of 31.2% and 32.4% of non-severe Covid-cases were reported in the Bimervax and Comirnaty 
arms, respectively. There were no cases of severe COVID-19 infection and there were no immune-
mediated adverse events in the study. 
Elderly subjects 
At D14 the immune response for each tested variant are lower compared to the overall mITT-2 analyses. 
For  D614G  strain,  Beta  and  Delta,  the  nAb  GMTs  were  lower  compared  to  the  Comirnaty  arm.  For 
Omicron, nAb GMTs in both arms are similar. Responder analysis indicates largely similar percentages 
(except for D614G strain) of subjects achieving an at least 4-fold rise in neutralizing antibodies indicative 
for a sufficient protection.  
The Day 182 results showed higher nAb GMTs with PHH-1V compared to Comirnaty for all tested strains.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No correlate of protection against COVID-19 exists. The immunobridging approach of PHH-1V to 
Comirnaty with known efficacy is therefore essential for the interpretation of a potential protective 
effect of PHH-1V. 
In the pivotal HH2 study, PHH-1V failed to demonstrate non-inferiority against the active comparator 
Comirnaty in the primary efficacy endpoint (neutralizing antibody responses against the D614G strain 
at Day 14, PBNA). Thus, the multiple type I error rate was not controlled for conclusions on 
immunogenicity differences for VOCs.  
The modified ITT population (mITT) was defined as all subjects who received a dose of study drug 
minus subjects that tested positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of receiving study drug. The exclusion 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 168/177 
 
 
 
 
of subjects with a positive test was however not prespecified and does not correspond to the initially 
defined estimand (vaccinated subjects regardless of infection). In addition, as the study was performed 
during the omicron wave with very high incidences also of asymptomatic cases, it cannot be assumed 
that all infections have been identified, since no consistent screening strategy for infections during the 
study has been implemented and an overall influence on study results cannot be ruled out.  
Assays: The PBNAs (and the VNA) do not provide absolute determinations of the nAB content in 
patient’s sera, as none of the PBNAs (and the VNA) has been calibrated to adequate reference 
standards (e.g., sera with known nAB level). Consequently, throughout the clinical studies, only 
relative nAB titres were and can be measured with the established PBNAs and the alpha-variant VNA. 
This means the efficacy evaluation of PHH-1V solely needs to rely on a relative comparison between 
nAB levels between different treatment arms. The obtained results can therefore not be directly 
compared to other data sources.  
To date, there are no reliable data on the immunogenicity for the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages. 
Albeit the Applicant developed a PBNA assay for BA.4/5 by using the same method as for the previous 
variants, the HEK-293 cell line used for the previous variants had to be replaced for the Vero E6 cell 
line without implementation of a validated/qualified bridging assay.  
The dose finding Study HH-1 was not specifically designed for booster vaccination but only for primary 
vaccination and no clear dose-dependent effect on immunogenicity can be concluded. Therefore, there 
remains some uncertainty whether the chosen dose is indeed the most optimal dose for booster 
vaccination. 
Only limited data is available for paediatric subjects: 36 subjects 16-17 yoa received primary 
immunisation with Comirnaty followed by one PHH-1V dose in study HH-5 of which only 11 are 
included in the immunogenicity subset 
Vaccinations with Bimervax have been applied 182 days after the second dose of the primary series. 
Only very limited immunogenicity data is available for shorter time frames.  
Of overall 751 subjects (mITT/PP baseline numbers), 56 included subjects were ≥65 yoa. This is below 
the targeted 10% of the overall population. The number and percentage of patients between 65 and 74 
yoa are low and those of patients between 75 and 84 yoa is very low. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The main data relevant for the assessment of safety are derived from studies HH-2 (n=513 subjects 
exposed to PHH-1V) and HH-5 (n=2646 subjects exposed to PHH-1V). Despite limited in sample size, 
also data from study HH-10 were considered relevant for the total safety pool.  
Provided pooled safety data from studies HH-2, HH-5 and HH-10 (all with data extraction on 18th of 
July 2022 and analysis run on 11th of August 2022) concluded a total of 9279 TEAEs reported in 2818 
subjects (8639 related TEAEs in 2778 subjects). Events for PHH-1V appear to be generally milder 
compared to events in association with Comirnaty as booster vaccine. The frequency of TEAEs 
following PHH-1V is comparable across studies in HH-5 (87.82%) and HH-2 (89.3%) and is slightly 
lower compared to Comirnaty in study HH-2 (94.4%).  
By SOC and PT, in study HH-2, gastrointestinal disorders (13.3% vs. 8.3% for PHH-1V and Comirnaty, 
respectively) as well as respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (3.3% vs. 1.6% for PHH-1V and 
Comirnaty, respectively) are the two categories of system organ class with higher incidences in the 
PHH-1V group compared to subjects treated with Comirnaty. Most pronounced differences were found 
in PTs diarrhoea (7.2% vs. 2.4% for PHH-1V and Comirnaty, respectively), cough (1% vs. 0% for PHH-
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 169/177 
 
 
 
 
1V and Comirnaty, respectively) and oropharyngeal pain (1% vs. 0% for PHH-1V and Comirnaty, 
respectively).  
In study HH-2 the total number of as well as the overall rate of subjects with solicited systemic events 
after booster vaccination is higher for the group vaccinated with Comirnaty for the first two days of the 
7-day observation period. However, starting with day 3 post-vaccination the total number of events is 
higher for the group treated with PHH-1V and remains higher until day 7. The mean duration of 
headache and fever was 0.2 days longer for both events in subjects after vaccination with PHH-1V 
compared to the mean duration after vaccination with Comirnaty. Importantly, the general proportion 
of subjects reporting headache or fever was higher after vaccination with Comirnaty compared to 
vaccination with PHH-1V. Only diarrhoea was reported with higher incidences for the PHH-1V group 
throughout the observation period of 7 days. Still, less subjects reported solicited systemic AEs after 
booster vaccination with PHH-1V compared to those vaccinated with Comirnaty (except for diarrhoea) 
in Study HH-2.  
The proportion of subjects taking pain medication and/or antipyretics as well as the amount of such 
medication was proportionally higher for the Comirnaty group (44% and 25.14% of subjects after 
booster with Comirnaty and PHH-1V, respectively). These data do indicate a potentially better 
tolerability for the booster vaccination with PHH-1V. 
Throughout the 7-day observation period for solicited local reactions after booster vaccination, no 
event (i.e., erythema/redness, induration/swelling, pain and tenderness) was reported with higher 
incidences for subjects vaccinated with PHH-1V compared to subjects vaccinated with Comirnaty 
during study HH-2.  
Data as reported in study HH-2 regarding unsolicited systemic and local adverse events indicate lower 
incidences for PHH-1V compared to Comirnaty and do not give reason of concern.  
With respect to pooled safety data, Medically Attended Adverse Events were mostly reported for SOC 
Infections and infestations (3.48% of subjects across the pooled studies HH-2, HH-5 and HH-10). No 
other SOC was reported in more than 1% of subjects.  
Adverse events of special interest were reported in 10.65% of subjects across the pooled studies HH-2, 
HH-5 and HH-10 and were mostly related to Covid-19 infections. One SAE of pericarditis was reported 
with relation to the study vaccine, and it is listed as an adverse reaction. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
More female subjects were included in study HH-2 (i.e., approximately 37% male and 63% female), 
but slightly more male subjects were included in study HH-5 (52.5% male and 47.5% female). 
Reasons for the imbalance are not entirely evident, but the imbalance in gender in study HH-2 was 
comparable for both study groups and is not considered to affect the interpretation of study results. 
The number of subjects older than 65 years of age (n=38 for PHH-1V and n=18 for Comirnaty in study 
HH-2 and n=22 for study HH-5) and ≥16 to <18 years (n=36 in study HH-5) is limited but considered 
acceptable. The Applicant provided the requested AE data from the studies HH-2 and HH-5 specific for 
the elderly population. However, the number and percentage of patients between 65 and 74 yoa are 
low and those of patients between 75 and 84 yoa is very low. Thus, the above-mentioned findings 
must be handled with caution. 
Beyond the first week after vaccination, adverse events were collected at the investigational site during 
subject visits on days 14 and 28 via anamnesis that covered the periods from days 0-14 and days 14-
28. No diary documentation was required for participants beyond day 7, but participants have been 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 170/177 
 
 
 
 
encouraged and reminded to report any AE at the time of their occurrence at any point during the 
study. Any reported AE was registered in the eCRF.  
Comparison of HH-2 and HH-5 showed a remarkable differences for malaise (20.26% of subjects in 
study HH-5, but none reported in study HH-2 for PHH-1V or Comirnaty), injection site swelling (9.56% 
in study HH-5, 0.6% for PHH-1V in HH-2 and 2.8% for Comirnaty in HH-2), injection site induration 
(1.21% in HH-5, 8.6% for PHH-1V in HH-2 and 17.1% for Comirnaty in HH-2), nausea (none in HH-5, 
5.8% for PHH-1V in HH-2 and 5.2% for Comirnaty in HH-2), vomiting (5.93% in HH-5, 1.9% for PHH-
1V in HH-2 and 1.2% for Comirnaty in HH-2) and myalgia (1.81% in HH-5, 19.5% for PHH-1V in HH-2 
and 34.1% for Comirnaty in HH-2). Reasons for the distinct pattern per study could be related to 
individual interpretation regarding the reporting of AEs per patient diary, but these are not entirely 
clear.  
A substantially lower frequency of unsolicited AEs reported in study HH-5 compared to study HH-2 
(18.59% and 28.8% for PHH-1V in study HH-5 and study HH-2, respectively) was considered related 
to seasonal fluctuations in infection waves that affected both studies in a distinct manner. 
Vaccination with PHH-1V following the primary Spikevax/Spikevax vaccination schedule, resulted in a 
higher frequency of solicited local and systemic events compared to other primary vaccination 
schemes. Reasons are currently unclear, but numbers do not give rise to concern. 
All subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at screening, symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects in 
close contact with a subject known with Covid-19 were assessed via the standard procedure in the 
health system. No dedicated screening system after vaccination was established for study participants. 
This strategy does not ensure that all COVID-19 cases have been observed in the study and in case 
studies are performed in different countries/regions the standard procedures might differ. However, it 
is acknowledged that severe cases would have most likely been detected. 
A possible impact on clinical safety from high remaining HCP content is currently unclear. The Applicant 
committed to submit results of an in-depth characterization of the qualitative HCP profile including a 
full risk evaluation of identified HCPs within 2 months post-approval (REC7). 
Studies are still ongoing and data for individual studies were provided at distinct data cut-offs. Further 
updates of data with the final study reports should be anticipated.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
While PHH-1V failed to demonstrate non-inferiority against the active comparator Comirnaty in the 
primary efficacy endpoint (neutralizing antibody responses against the D614G strain at Day 14, PBNA), 
it was superior with regard to the Beta and Omicron VOC and non-inferior with regards to the Delta 
VOC (secondary endpoints, also neutralizing antibody responses at Day 14, PBNA). Notwithstanding 
that the primary endpoint was not met, the application could still be approvable, since the D614G 
strain has been superseded by the emerging VOCs in particular the recent Omicron VOC, rendering the 
secondary endpoints clinically more relevant than the primary endpoint. 
The submitted overall data was not considered suitable to support a claim for a booster dose for 
previously immunized subjects irrespective of the vaccine administered previously. Only an indication 
including subjects with primary immunization with mRNA vaccines is acceptable.  
Booster vaccination with either PHH-1V or Comirnaty was administered at least 182 days after the 
second dose of the primary series for most study participants. Available data for booster vaccinations 
with PHH-1V below 6 months after the second dose of the primary series are currently limited. Thus, 
based on available data the interval between the last dose of previous COVID-19 vaccine and Bimervax 
should be at least 6 months.  
Although limited data is available in individuals 16 yoa and older (36 subjects 16-17 yoa received 
primary immunisation with Comirnaty followed by one PHH-1V dose in study HH-5 of which only 11 are 
included in the immunogenicity subset), the respective results show a strong increase of neutralizing 
immune responses after PHH-1V administration. In addition, data on neutralizing GMTs do not suggest 
apparent differences to that obtained in adults and it is noted that higher GMTs were obtained. Thus, 
the data supports an indication in individuals 16 yoa or older. 
Safety data are rather limited considering the total amount of subjects followed (around 3000) but 
provided results do not indicate major deviations from licensed Covid-19 vaccines (i.e., Comirnaty as 
tested in study HH-2) and the overall safety database is considered sufficient to conclude on the safety 
profile. Gastrointestinal disorders appear more pronounced (specifically PT diarrhoea), but PHH-1V 
appears to be less reactogenic compared to Comirnaty, based on the currently available data. A 
serious adverse event of pericarditis is noted with concern, as similar events were reported for other 
Covid-19 vaccines as well. Further observation appears crucial during post-marketing, but overall, the 
safety database is considered acceptable. A possible impact on clinical safety from high remaining HCP 
content is currently unclear, but the Applicant committed to submit results of an in-depth 
characterization of the qualitative HCP profile including a full risk evaluation of identified HCPs within 2 
months post-approval (REC7). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The immunobridging approach used for this application is considered acceptable and the provided data 
allow to assume efficacy for the booster vaccination with Bimervax in subjects who have previously 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 175/177 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
received a mRNA COVID 19 vaccine. The provided data further show an acceptable safety profile, 
overall comparable to other COVID-19 vaccines.  
The benefit/risk balance of Bimervax for the sought indication “active immunisation to prevent COVID-
19 in individuals 16 years of age and older who have previously received a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine” is 
positive.  
Furthermore, in view of the development programme, the nature of the product and the data package 
provided, the dossier is considered comprehensive vis-à-vis the dossier requirements for a vaccine 
authorisation using an immuno-bridging approach. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Bimervax is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Bimervax is favourable in the following indication(s): 
‘BIMERVAX is indicated as a booster for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 
years of age and older who have previously received a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations.’ 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory, or a laboratory designated for that purpose. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/175278/2023  
Page 176/177 
 
 
 
 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that SARS-CoV-2 virus 
recombinant spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fusion heterodimer – B.1.351-B.1.1.7 
strains is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

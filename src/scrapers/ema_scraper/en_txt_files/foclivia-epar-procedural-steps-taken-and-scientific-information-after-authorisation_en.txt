1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Annex II 
On the basis of the available clinical data for influenza 
A/H5N1 and A/H1N1 strains submitted to CHMP since MA, 
the benefit-risk balance of Foclivia remains favourable. 
Page 25/33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Foclivia is not marketed since it is a mock-up pandemic 
vaccine. The knowledge of the safety of Foclivia vaccine is 
based, until now, on limited data coming from clinical 
studies. Most of the available evidence is based on the 
experience gathered with the pandemic vaccine A/H1N1, 
Focetria. Due to the type of vaccine under evaluation and 
taking into account that it can be used only in a pandemic 
situation after a strain change, it is expected that in the 
next five years the generation of new evidence from post-
marketing experience is very unlikely.   
Thus, the CHMP recommends that the renewal be granted 
with unlimited validity. The MA will remain under 
exceptional circumstances.

sulphate among the trace residues, data on 
pregnancy with H1N1v, results from a cumulative 
review on thrombocytopenia and data on 
immunogenicity and safety from study V111_03 in 
children with H1N1v. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data is the following: i) data indicating that some cases of 
convulsion with and without fever have been reported in 
subjects vaccinated with H1N1v and thus patients need to 
be informed; ii) barium sulphate was included among the 
trace residues due to the associated hypersensitivity risks; 
iii) data on pregnancy with H1N1v was included to show 
that there is no direct or indirect harmful effects from 
vaccination with H1N1v during pregnancy; iv) results from 
a cumulative review on thrombocytopenia was included to 
alert that some cases have been detected with seasonal 
influenza vaccines; v) and data on immunogenicity and 
safety from study V111_03 in children with H1N1v was 
added overall supporting the positive benefit/risk profile of 
the vaccine.

The adverse reactions from clinical trial V87P6 in children 
following CHMP request in PSU012 to include data on

aged 6 months to 17 years were included in section 4.8 of 
safety and immunogenicity from the pediatric study 
V87P6. Based on the SmPC guideline section 4.2 was 
also restructured and a standard statement on 
pediatric studies deferral was added in section 5.1. 
The DDPS details in Annex II were revised based on

Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
the SmPC, showing a safety profile similar to a seasonal 
vaccine and an increased reactogenicity after the booster 
dose and in the older age groups. Section 4.2 was 
restructured in line with the SmPC guideline and to improve 
clarity. Data from the pediatric clinical trial V87P6 were 
included in section 5.1 of the SmPC to show that high levels 
of antibodies were achieved after two vaccinations in all 
age groups. The standard statement on deferral of pediatric 
studies was added to section 5.1 based on the SmPC 
guideline. Editorial changes for improved clarity were

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Fampyra 10 mg prolonged-release tablets 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each prolonged-release tablet contains 10 mg of fampridine. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Prolonged-release tablet. 
An off-white, film coated, oval biconvex 13 x 8 mm tablet with flat edge debossed with A10 on one 
side. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Fampyra is indicated for the improvement of walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis with 
walking disability (EDSS 4-7). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with fampridine is restricted to prescription and supervision by physicians experienced in 
the management of MS. 
Posology 
The recommended dose is one 10 mg tablet, twice daily, taken 12 hours apart (one tablet in the 
morning and one tablet in the evening). Fampridine should not be administered more frequently or at 
higher doses than recommended (see section 4.4). The tablets should be taken without food 
(see section 5.2). 
Missed dose 
The usual dosing regimen should always be followed. A double dose should not be taken if a dose is 
missed. 
Starting and evaluating Fampyra treatment 
• 
• 
• 
Initial prescription should be limited to two to four weeks of therapy as clinical benefits should 
generally be identified within two to four weeks after starting Fampyra 
An assessment of walking ability, e.g. the Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) or Twelve Item 
Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), is recommended to evaluate improvement 
within two to four weeks. If no improvement is observed, the treatment should be discontinued 
This medicinal product should be discontinued if benefit is not reported by patients. 
Re-evaluating Fampyra treatment 
If decline in walking ability is observed, physicians should consider an interruption to treatment in 
order to reassess the benefits of fampridine (see above). The re-evaluation should include withdrawal 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of this medicinal product and performing an assessment of walking ability. Fampridine should be 
discontinued if patients no longer receive walking benefit. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Renal function should be checked in the elderly before starting treatment with this medicinal product. 
Monitoring renal function to detect any renal impairment is recommended in the elderly (see section 
4.4). 
Patients with renal impairment 
Fampridine is contraindicated in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 50 mL/min) (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of this medicinal product in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Fampyra is for oral use. 
The tablet must be swallowed whole. It must not be divided, crushed, dissolved, sucked or chewed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to fampridine or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Concurrent treatment with other medicinal products containing fampridine (4-aminopyridine). 
Patients with prior history or current presentation of seizure. 
Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min). 
Concomitant use of Fampyra with medicinal products that are inhibitors of Organic Cation 
Transporter 2 (OCT2) for example, cimetidine. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Seizure risk 
Treatment with fampridine increases seizure risk (see section 4.8). 
This medicinal product should be administered with caution in the presence of any factors which may 
lower seizure threshold. 
Fampridine should be discontinued in patients who experience a seizure while on treatment. 
Renal impairment 
Fampridine is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Patients with renal impairment have 
higher plasma concentrations which are associated with increased adverse reactions, in particular 
neurological effects. Determining renal function before treatment and its regular monitoring during 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment is recommended in all patients (particularly in the elderly in whom renal function might be 
reduced). Creatinine clearance can be estimated using the Cockroft-Gault formula. 
Caution is required when Fampyra is prescribed in patients with mild renal impairment or in patients 
using medicinal products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propranolol and 
metformin. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In post-marketing experience, serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction) have 
been reported, the majority of these cases occurred within the first week of treatment. Particular 
attention should be given to patients with a previous history of allergic reactions. If an anaphylactic or 
other serious allergic reaction occurs, this medicinal product should be discontinued and not restarted. 
Other warnings and precautions 
Fampridine should be administered with caution to patients with cardiovascular symptoms of rhythm 
and sinoatrial or atrioventricular conduction cardiac disorders (these effects are seen in overdose). 
There is limited safety information in these patients. 
The increased incidence of dizziness and balance disorder seen with fampridine may result in an 
increased risk of falls. Therefore, patients should use walking aids as needed. 
In clinical studies low white blood cell counts were seen in 2.1% of Fampyra patients versus 1.9% of 
patients on placebo. Infections were seen in the clinical studies (see section 4.8) and increased 
infection rate and impairment of the immune response cannot be excluded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Concurrent treatment with other medicinal products containing fampridine (4-aminopyridine) is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Fampridine is eliminated mainly via the kidneys with active renal secretion accounting for about 60% 
(see section 5.2). OCT2 is the transporter responsible for the active secretion of fampridine. Thus, the 
concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal products that are inhibitors of OCT2 for example, 
cimetidine are contraindicated (see section 4.3) and concomitant use of fampridine with medicinal 
products that are substrates of OCT2 for example, carvedilol, propranolol and metformin is cautioned 
(see section 4.4.) 
Interferon: fampridine has been administered concomitantly with interferon-beta and no 
pharmacokinetic medicinal product interactions were observed. 
Baclofen: fampridine has been administered concomitantly with baclofen and no pharmacokinetic 
medicinal product interactions were observed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are limited amount of data from the use of fampridine in pregnant women. 
Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure it is 
preferable to avoid the use of fampridine in pregnancy. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether fampridine is excreted in human or animal milk. Fampyra is not recommended 
during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
In animal studies no effects on fertility were seen. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Fampyra has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of Fampyra has been evaluated in randomised controlled clinical studies, in open label long 
term studies and in the post marketing setting. 
Adverse reactions identified are mostly neurological and include seizure, insomnia, anxiety, balance 
disorder, dizziness, paraesthesia, tremor, headache and asthenia. This is consistent with fampridine’s 
pharmacological activity. The highest incidence of adverse reactions identified from placebo-
controlled trials in multiple sclerosis patients with fampridine given at the recommended dose, are 
reported as urinary tract infection (in approximately 12 % of patients). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions are presented below by system organ class and absolute frequency. Frequencies are 
defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100);

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hypersensitivity 
In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions (including 
anaphylaxis) which have occurred with one or more of the following: dyspnoea, chest discomfort, 
hypotension, angioedema, rash and urticaria. For further information on hypersensitivity reactions, 
please refer to sections 4.3 and 4.4. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Acute symptoms of overdose with fampridine were consistent with central nervous system excitation 
and included confusion, tremulousness, diaphoresis, seizure, and amnesia. 
Central nervous system adverse reactions at high doses of 4-aminopyridine include dizziness, 
confusion, seizures, status epilepticus, involuntary and choreoathetoid movements. Other side effects 
at high doses include cases of cardiac arrhythmias (for example, supraventricular tachycardia and 
bradycardia) and ventricular tachycardia as a consequence of potential QT prolongation. Reports of 
hypertension have also been received. 
Management 
Patients who overdose should be provided supportive care. Repeated seizure activity should be treated 
with benzodiazepine, phenytoin, or other appropriate acute anti-seizure therapy.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX07. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Fampyra is a potassium channel blocker. By blocking potassium channels, fampridine reduces the 
leakage of ionic current through these channels, thereby prolonging repolarization and thus enhancing 
action potential formation in demyelinated axons and neurological function. Presumably, by 
enhancing action potential formation, more impulses might be conducted in the central nervous 
system. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Three phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled confirmatory studies, (MS-F203 and 
MS-F204 and 218MS305) have been performed. The proportion of responders was independent of 
concomitant immunomodulatory therapy (including interferons, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod and 
natalizumab). The Fampyra dose was 10 mg twice a day (BID). 
Studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 
The primary endpoint in studies MS-F203 and MS-F204 was the responder rate in walking speed as 
measured by the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW). A responder was defined as a patient who 
consistently had a faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double 
blind period as compared to the maximum value among five off-treatment visits. 
A significantly greater proportion of Fampyra treated patients were responders as compared to placebo 
(MS-F203: 34.8% vs. 8.3%, p< 0.001; MS-F204: 42.9% vs. 9.3%, p< 0.001). 
Patients who responded to Fampyra increased their walking speed on average by 26.3% vs 5.3% on 
placebo (p< 0.001) (MS-F203) and 25.3% vs 7.8% (p< 0.001) (MS-F204). The improvement appeared 
rapidly (within weeks) after starting the treatment. 
Statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in walking were seen, as measured by the  
12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale.

Study 218MS305 
Study 218MS305 was conducted in 636 subjects with multiple sclerosis and walking disability. 
Duration of double-blind treatment was 24 weeks with a 2 week post–treatment follow-up. The 
primary endpoint was improvement in walking ability, measured as the proportion of patients 
achieving a mean improvement of ≥ 8 points from baseline MSWS-12 score over 24 weeks. In this 
study there was a statistically significant treatment difference, with a greater proportion of Fampyra 
treated patients demonstrating an improvement in walking ability, compared to placebo-controlled 
patients (relative risk of 1.38 (95% CI: [1.06, 1.70]). Improvements generally appeared within 2 to 4 
weeks of initiation of treatment, and disappeared within 2 weeks of treatment cessation. 
Fampridine treated patients also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the Timed Up 
and Go (TUG) test, a measure of static and dynamic balance and physical mobility. In this secondary 
endpoint, a greater proportion of fampridine treated patients achieved ≥ 15% mean improvement from 
baseline TUG speed over a 24 week period, compared to placebo. The difference in the Berg Balance 
Scale (BBS; a measure of static balance), was not statistically significant.

The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Fampyra in all subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of multiple sclerosis with walking 
disability (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Orally administered fampridine is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. 
Fampridine has a narrow therapeutic index. Absolute bioavailability of Fampyra prolonged-release 
tablets has not been assessed, but relative bioavailability (as compared to an aqueous oral solution) is 
95%. The Fampyra prolonged-release tablet has a delay in the absorption of fampridine manifested by 
slower rise to a lower peak concentration, without any effect on the extent of absorption. 
When Fampyra prolonged-release tablets are taken with food, the reduction in the area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of fampridine is approximately 2-7% (10 mg dose). The 
small reduction in AUC is not expected to cause a reduction in the therapeutic efficacy. However, Cmax 
increases by 15-23%. Since there is a clear relationship between Cmax and dose related adverse 
reactions, it is recommended to take Fampyra without food (see section 4.2). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Fampridine is a lipid-soluble active substance which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. 
Fampridine is largely unbound to plasma proteins (bound fraction varied between 3-7% in human 
plasma). Fampridine has a volume of distribution of approximately 2.6 L/kg. 
Fampridine is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein. 
Biotransformation 
Fampridine is metabolised in humans by oxidation to 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine and further 
conjugated to the 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine sulfate. No pharmacological activity was found for the 
fampridine metabolites against selected potassium channels in vitro. 
The 3-hydroxylation of fampridine to 3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine by human liver microsomes 
appeared to be catalysed by Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1). 
There was evidence of direct inhibition of CYP2E1 by fampridine at 30 μM (approximately 12% 
inhibition) which is approximately 100 times the average plasma fampridine concentration measured 
for the 10 mg tablet. 
Treatment of cultured human hepatocytes with fampridine had little or no effect on induction of 
CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4/5 enzyme activities. 
Elimination 
The major route of elimination for fampridine is renal excretion, with approximately 90% of the dose 
recovered in urine as parent active substance within 24 hours. Renal clearance (CLR 370 mL/min) is 
substantially greater than glomerular filtration rate due to combined glomerular filtration and active 
excretion by the renal OCT2 transporter. Faecal excretion accounts for less than 1% of the 
administered dose. 
Fampridine is characterized by linear (dose-proportional) pharmacokinetics with a terminal 
elimination half-life of approximately 6 hours. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and, to a 
smaller extent, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increase proportionately with 
dose. There is no evidence of clinically relevant accumulation of fampridine taken at the 
recommended dose in patients with full renal function. In patients with renal impairment, 
accumulation occurs relative to the degree of impairment. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Fampridine is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, and with creatinine clearance known to 
decrease with age, monitoring of renal function in elderly patients is recommended (see section 4.2). 
Paediatric population 
No data are available. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Fampridine is eliminated primarily by the kidneys as unchanged active substance and therefore renal 
function should be checked in patients where renal function might be compromised. Patients with mild 
renal impairment can be expected to have approximately 1.7 to 1.9 times the fampridine 
concentrations achieved by patients with normal renal function. Fampyra must not be administered to 
patients with moderate and severe renal impairment (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Fampridine was studied in oral repeat dose toxicity studies in several animal species. 
Adverse responses to orally administered fampridine were rapid in onset, most often occurring within 
the first 2 hours post-dose. Clinical signs evident after large single doses or repeated lower doses were 
similar in all species studied and included tremors, convulsions, ataxia, dyspnoea, dilated pupils, 
prostration, abnormal vocalization, increased respiration, and excess salivation. Gait abnormalities and 
hyper-excitability were also observed. These clinical signs were not unexpected and represent 
exaggerated pharmacology of fampridine. In addition, single cases of fatal urinary tract obstructions 
were observed in rats. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be elucidated, but a causal 
relationship with fampridine treatment cannot be excluded. 
In reproduction toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, decreased weight and viability of foetuses and 
offspring were observed at maternally toxic doses. However, no increased risk for malformations or 
adverse effects on fertility was noted. 
In a battery of in vitro and in vivo studies fampridine did not show any potential to be mutagenic, 
clastogenic or carcinogenic.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fampyra is and what it is used for 
Fampyra contains the active substance fampridine which belongs to a group of medicines called 
potassium channel blockers. They work by stopping potassium leaving the nerve cells which have 
been damaged by MS. This medicine is thought to work by letting signals pass down the nerve more 
normally, which allows you to walk better. 
Fampyra is a medicine used to improve walking in adults (18 years and over) with Multiple Sclerosis 
(MS) related walking disability. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation destroys the protective sheath 
around the nerves leading to muscle weakness, muscle stiffness and difficulty walking.

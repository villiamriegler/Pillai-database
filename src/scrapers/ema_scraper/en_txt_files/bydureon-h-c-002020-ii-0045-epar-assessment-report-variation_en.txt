Extension of Indication to include treatment in combination with basal insulin for Bydureon; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated based on the study 
D5553C00002 (Duration 7 study) which evaluated safety and efficacy of exenatide once weekly therapy 
added to titrated basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycaemic control on 
basal insulin with or without metformin. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make minor corrections in sections 4.8 and 
5.1 of the SmPC. Furthermore, the updated RMP version 26 has been submitted. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0130/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP (P/0130/2016) was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The purpose of this application is to provide information on the efficacy and safety of concomitant add-on 
treatment with exenatide once weekly (prolonged-release exanatide) to titrated basal insulin with or 
without metformin, supporting addition of new study data to the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC), section 5.1. 
As combination with insulin is not covered by the current indication, SmPC, section 4.1 has been updated. 
The MAH proposes to simplify the wording to be in line with more recently approved glucose-lowering 
agents including other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs).  
It should be noted that the wording of the indication was updated within procedure 
EMEA/H/C/2020/II/41, which got a positive opinion by the CHMP in July 2017. Thus with this procedure, 
the indication is only updated to include “basal insulin”. 
Proposed indication: 
Bydureon is indicated in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic 
control in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including basal insulin, when the 
therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control (see section 
4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations). 
Exenatide once weekly (prolonged-release exanatide) 
Exenatide, a GLP-1RA, exerts its glycaemic-lowering effect by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin 
secretion, suppressing glucagon release, and delaying gastric emptying.  In addition, it lowers weight by 
inducing satiety through central mechanisms.  
Rationale for combination therapy with exenatide and basal insulin 
Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease that is characterised by defects in multiple organ systems and 
usually requires combination therapy with agents that target different pathways.  Because physiological 
defects may be manifested differently in individual patients, and patients differ in their care needs due to 
differences in demographics, comorbidities, individual preferences and other factors, individualisation of 
diabetes management is emphasised in international guidelines as essential for successful diabetes care.  
Assessment report  
EMA/717429/2017 
Page 5/42 
 
  
  
 
The availability of various types and combinations of diabetes therapy is consistent with this emphasis on 
patient-centered care.   
Because of their differing and complimentary mechanisms of action, the combination of exenatide and 
basal insulin glargine was expected to be a more effective treatment strategy than intensification of basal 
insulin therapy alone. Basal insulin treatment primarily improves FPG, and exenatide has a significant 
effect on PPG via its postprandial effects. The body weight loss associated with exenatide was expected to 
mitigate the weight gain associated with insulin, and the gradual onset of action and glucose-dependent 
mechanism of action of exenatide were not expected to exacerbate the risk of hypoglycaemia associated 
with insulin. Additionally, the weekly administration of EQW and the lack of a requirement for monitoring 
would not add significantly to the patient burden associated with insulin therapy. 
The clinical programme for this submission consists of a single Phase 3 study, Study D5553C00002.  A 
28-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase 3 trial to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of once weekly exenatide therapy added to titrated basal insulin glargine 
compared to placebo added to titrated basal insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) who have inadequate glycaemic control on basal insulin glargine with or without metformin. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was performed because exenatide, as a moderately sized naturally-
occuring peptide, is unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment, in line with the current ERA 
guideline (CPMP/SWP/4447/00).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
An exploratory object was to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) of exenatide following 2 mg 
subcutaneous injections once weekly. 
Sparse PK samples were taken regularly and plasma concentrations of exenatide were determined by the 
use of a validated ligand binding assay. The presences of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) was also 
determined. 
All together 214 patients were included in the PK evaluation. 
Historically plasma concentrations of exenatide associated with high titers of ADA >625, have been 
excluded from the PK analyses which were also done in the current study.  
Below figure shows the plasma concentration-time profile of exenatide in patients with ADA ≤625. Steady 
state was reached after about eight weeks treatment. Geometric mean (SE) steady state was calculated 
to 161(8) pg/ml.

>25 and <30 kg/m2 162 (19) pg/ml. Only nine patients included had a BMI of <25 kg/m2, with a steady 
state calculated to 223 (6) pg/ml. 
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Descriptive PK shows a steady state after about eight weeks treatment. Higher steady state levels were 
seen in subjects with decreased renal function. Patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 had comparable steady state 
concentrations as subjects with a BMI of >25 and <30 kg/m2.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study D5553C00002.  A 28-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group, Phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once weekly exenatide 
therapy added to titrated basal insulin glargine compared to placebo added to titrated basal 
insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have inadequate 
glycemic control on basal insulin glargine with or without metformin. 
Methods 
Study D5553C00002 was a 28-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicentre, Phase III 
efficacy and safety study of EQW 2 mg versus placebo as add-on treatment to titrated basal insulin in 
patients with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control on titrated basal insulin with or without 
metformin, and with or without an SU (discontinued at Week -8). 
EQW=exenatide once weekly; HbA1c=glycated hemoglobin A1c; Met=metformin; PBO=placebo; 
SU=sulfonylurea; T2DM=Type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Study participants 
Inclusion / exclusion criteria 
Patients were included in the study if they were treated with basal insulin glargine at a dose of ≥20 
units/day once daily for at least 6 weeks prior to Screening, in combination with diet and exercise alone 
or in combination with: 
- 
- 
a stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening) 
a stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening) and a  
stable dose of SU for at least 8 weeks prior to the Screening visit. 
Exclusion criterias included administration of any antihyperglycaemic therapy, other than SU, insulin, or 
metformin, for more than 14 days (consecutive or not) during the 12 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening). 
In addition, administration of any antihyperglycaemic therapy, other than SU, insulin, or metformin, at 
any dose, at any time during the 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening).  
Also excluded were patients who had been treated, were currently being treated, or were expected to 
require or undergo treatment with any of the following treatment-excluded medications: 
- 
any DPP-4 inhibitor within 3 months prior to Visit 1 (Screening) 
Assessment report  
EMA/717429/2017 
Page 9/42 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
- 
systemic corticosteroids within 3 months prior to Visit 1 (Screening) by oral, intravenous, intra-
articular, or intramuscular route; or potent, inhaled, or intrapulmonary steroids known to have a high 
rate of systemic absorption.  
- 
prescription or over-the-counter weight loss medications within 3 months prior to Visit 1 (Screening). 
Background therapy 
Patients were treated with basal insulin glargine at a dose of ≥20 units/day once daily for at least 6 
weeks prior to screening. Insulin glargine dose was optimized according to the INITIATE algorithm during 
the insulin dose optimization phase and throughout the treatment phase of the study. The Investigator 
could have deviated from this algorithm if necessary according to his/her clinical judgment. Glucose 
control was optimized by (further) titrating the insulin glargine dose, aiming to achieve a fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG) of 4,0–5,5 mmol/l without hypoglycaemia. Adjustments were made at scheduled visits and 
in between visits by both Investigators and patients. Dose changes (if any), were based on the average of 
3 consecutive measurements (on different days) of fasting blood glucose levels. 
The INITIATE algorithm 
A majority of patients (84% in EQW group, 81% in placebo group) were treated with a stable dose of 
metformin (≥1500 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks prior to screening. Up to week 28, patients continued to 
administer the same type and dose of metformin therapy they were using at study entry. 
Metformin is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy in both the United States (US) and the 
European Union (EU). 
Exenatide 
The 2 mg dose was used for this study as it is the dose that was studied in the Phase III program, and is 
the only approved dose of exenatide once weekly. 
Rescue 
During 28-Week randomised treatment period, patients with inadequate glycaemic control based on 
progressively stricter glycaemic criteria (table below) remained in the study and received open-label 
rescue therapy with prandial insulin while they continued receiving study medication. 
Assessment report  
EMA/717429/2017 
Page 10/42 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Patients who met rescue criteria in the double-blind Treatment Period first completed the Rescue Visit 
procedures (equivalent to the Week 28 assessments) before receiving open-label rescue therapy, to 
ensure that important study endpoint measurements were collected. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To compare the change from baseline in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) achieved with EQW added to titrated 
basal insulin glargine to placebo added to titrated basal insulin glargine, with or without metformin, after 
28 weeks of double-blind treatment. 
Secondary objectives 
To compare the effect of EQW added to titrated basal insulin glargine, with or without metformin, to 
placebo added to titrated basal insulin glargine, with or without metformin, on changes in glycaemic 
control and anthropometric measures. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 28. 
Secondary endpoints 
Glycaemic  
•  Change in 2-hour PPG after a standard meal tolerance test (MTT) at Week 28. 
• 
Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0% at Week 28. 
•  Change in total mean daily insulin dose from baseline to Week 28. 
• 
Proportion of patients with HbA1c <7.0% at Week 28 with no body weight gain at Week 28 and 
no major hypoglycaemia over 28 weeks. 
Body weight 
•  Change in body weight from baseline to Week 28. 
Blood pressure 
•  Change in SBP from baseline to Week 28. 
Sample size 
Sample size was estimated to be 209 patients per treatment group, assuming: 
•  Mean difference of 0.35% in HbA1c change from baseline 
•  Standard deviation of 1.1% 
• 
Testing at 2-sided α=0.05 
•  90% power to detect treatment differences. 
Assuming a 5% dropout rate prior to Week 4 (Visit 8), the first visit where HbA1c was tested, 220 
patients per treatment arm (a total of 440 patients) would have had post-baseline measurements of 
HbA1c and thus would have been included in the ITT analysis of the primary objective. Assuming 40% of 
screened patients failed to meet enrolment criteria and 25% of the patients who met enrolment criteria 
Assessment report  
EMA/717429/2017 
Page 11/42 
 
  
  
failed to meet the randomization criterion after the dose optimization phase, approximately 978 patients 
were to be screened. 
Randomisation 
Patients who meet all criteria for this study were randomized to double-blind treatment at Visit 5. 
Assignment to treatment groups were determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an 
IVRS.  
Randomization codes will be assigned strictly sequentially as patients become eligible for randomization; 
patients will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. If a randomization number is 
allocated incorrectly, no attempt should be made to remedy the error once study material has been 
dispensed. The patient will continue with the allocated number and study material. Subsequent patients 
will continue using the first unallocated randomization number in the original numbering sequence. 
Random assignment to study treatment were stratified by HbA1c stratum (<9.0% or ≥9.0%), and 
diabetes management method (SU use or non-SU use).  
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Patients, the investigator, study site personnel, and sponsor personnel 
involved with data review and analysis will remain blinded to study treatment throughout the study. To 
preserve the blinding, access to the treatment codes will be limited to personnel not involved in the daily 
conduct of the study or data review and analysis.  
The results central laboratory for FPG and HbA1c are blinded to the Investigator for all visits except Visits 
1-5. FPG values are blinded to the investigator site until the unblinding criteria for rescue therapy are 
met. If the criteria for rescue therapy are met, a report will be sent to the site for an individual subject. 
Previous values will remain blinded and the site will only receive the values going forward from the point 
the criteria were met. 
Statistical methods 
Different analysis sets were defined: 
The Randomized analysis set consisted of all patients who signed informed consent and who were 
randomized to a treatment group. Analysis performed for this Randomized population was according to 
the treatment group to which patients were assigned (regardless of whether or not they receive study 
drug). 
The Intention to treat (ITT) analysis set, the primary efficacy analysis set, included all randomized 
patients who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 post-baseline HbA1c 
assessment, with patients being analyzed as randomized, rather than as treated. 
The Per-protocol (PP), the secondary efficacy analysis set, was a subset of the ITT without important 
protocol violations. Patients excluded from the PP analysis were identified prior to database lock and 
treatment unblinding. 
All statistical tests were conducted at a 2-sided significance level of 5% unless otherwise specified. Where 
appropriate, model-based point estimates, together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were 
presented along with the 2-sided p-values for the tests. 
The multiplicity adjustment procedures to protect the family-wise type I error rate for the primary 
endpoint and secondary endpoints are described in Figure 1.  Each hypothesis test served as a serial 
gatekeeper for the tests placed later in the sequence, i.e., the null hypothesis for no treatment difference 
must have been rejected in order to proceed to the next hypotheses. If a null hypothesis for no treatment 
difference could not be rejected, all subsequent hypothesis testing stopped. All nominal p-values for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/717429/2017 
Page 12/42 
 
  
  
secondary analysis are presented. All other analyses for exploratory efficacy endpoints were evaluated at 
a 2-sided significance level of 5% without multiplicity adjustment. 
Figure 1.  Hypothesis testing procedure 
The primary efficacy analysis was to compare treatment arms with respect to change from baseline in 
HbA1c at Week 28 for the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set. The difference between treatment groups 
was estimated using an MMRM. Factors in the MMRM model included treatment, region, baseline HbA1c 
stratum (<9.0% or ≥9.0%), baseline SU-use stratum (yes vs. no in prior SU usage), week, and 
treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects. Baseline measurement of HbA1c was included as a 
continuous covariate for primary efficacy analysis. 
An unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within-patient errors, unless the model did 
not converge, in which case the covariance matrix was to be decided upon model convergence status and 
the Akaike information criterion. The Kenward-Roger approximation was used to estimate the 
denominator degrees of freedom. 
The least-squares (LS) means for change from baseline by visit and treatment, the SEs, and the 
corresponding 95% CIs, as well as the LS mean treatment differences, SEs for the LS mean treatment 
differences, the 95% CIs around the LS mean treatment differences, and the p-values for between 
treatment group comparisons, were derived from the MMRM. 
If a patient’s last available measurement during the 28-week assessment period was from an 
unscheduled visit or Early Termination visit, the value was programmatically mapped to the next closest 
scheduled visit and included in the MMRM analysis. No other missing data imputation was performed. 
Data collected after the initiation of the glycaemic rescue therapy or at the post-treatment Follow-up 
visits after a premature treatment discontinuation, were excluded from the analysis.  
For all secondary continuous variables for which multiple post-baseline measurements were collected, the 
MMRM model was applied as the main analysis. Data collected after the initiation of the glycaemic rescue 
therapy or at the post-treatment Follow-up visits after a premature treatment discontinuation were 
excluded, except for blood pressure-related endpoints, where data after rescue were included.

Change from baseline in postprandial glucose (PPG) was analysed by an ANCOVA model. The observed 
value and change in 2-hour PPG from baseline to Week 28 was also summarized descriptively by 
treatment for the ITT analysis set. The ANCOVA model included treatment, region, baseline HbA1c 
stratum (<9.0% or ≥9.0%), and baseline SU-use stratum (yes vs. no in prior SU usage) as fixed effects 
and the baseline value of 2-hour PPG as a covariate. The LS mean in each treatment group at Week 28, 
the SE, and the corresponding 95% CI, as well as the LS mean difference between treatment groups, the 
SE, the 95% CI, and the p-value, were derived and presented from the ANCOVA model. 
Proportions of patients achieving HbA1c target values of <7.0% at Week 28 were summarized and 
compared by treatment using a CMH test stratified by baseline HbA1c stratum (<9.0% or ≥9.0%) and 
baseline SU-use stratum for ITT analysis set. The general association statistics were provided. All patients 
with missing endpoint data were treated as non-responders. 
Supportive analyses 
For the primary endpoint, supportive analyses were done using the same MMRM model as in the primary 
analysis but based on the PP analysis set and the Randomized analysis set. 
To further support the primary endpoint analysis, an ANCOVA examining the last available observation 
prior to receiving rescue therapy in ITT analysis set was conducted. The model specification is the same 
as the ANCOVA described above. 
In addition, to provide a comprehensive view of the treatment effect in accordance with the ITT principle, 
data collected post rescue therapy and post discontinuation of study medication were included in the 
following sensitivity analyses: 
1.  HbA1c measurements collected during the study period, including those collected after the 
initiation of rescue medication or after discontinuation of study medication, were analysed using 
the same MMRM model as that for the primary efficacy analysis in HbA1c. 
2.  HbA1c measurements collected during the study period, including those collected after the 
initiation of rescue medication, but excluding data collected after discontinuation of study 
medication, were analysed using the same MMRM model as that for the primary efficacy analysis. 
To address the possible violations of the missing at random (MAR) assumption, 2 additional methods of 
sensitivity analyses based on missing not at random (MNAR) assumption were conducted. The first 
method was the copy reference (CR) analysis and the second method was the tipping point analysis. 
The CR method assumes that patients from the experimental treatment arm who discontinue the study 
treatment early or initiate a rescue therapy will follow the trajectory of outcomes in the control arm after 
treatment discontinuation/initiation of rescue therapy. The tipping point method considers an MNAR 
mechanism that patients from the experimental treatment arm who discontinue study treatment 
prematurely or who initiate a rescue therapy would have, on average, their efficacy values post 
rescue/post treatment discontinuation worse by some amount delta compared to efficacy values of similar 
patients who continue with the study treatment and do not require rescue therapy. The aim of the tipping 
point analysis is to find a “tipping point” corresponding to a value of delta where the study conclusion of a 
significant treatment effect would no longer hold. An interpretation of clinical plausibility of the 
assumption underlying the tipping point will be provided. 
Additional sensitivity analyses for HbA1c were also performed to exclude patients who were screened or 
randomized multiple times. Such patients to be excluded from the analysis were identified by clinical 
operations with reason of exclusion prior to database lock.

Protocol deviations 
A total of 15 patients (3.3%) had important protocol deviations: 8 patients (3.5%) in the EQW group and 
7 patients (3.0%) in the placebo group.  
Baseline data 
In general, baseline demographic characteristics were similar across the treatment groups. Overall, most 
patients randomized in this study were white (87.0%) The majority of patients in the ITT analysis set 
were from the United States (54.2%); approximately 41.0% were from Europe and the remainder was 
from South Africa (4.8%).
The mean age of patients in the study was 58 years and 48% of the patients were female. The mean 
height of patients in the study was 167.0 cm, and the mean weight was 94.02 kg. The mean BMI was 
33.66 kg/m2, and most patients were in the obese (≥30 kg/m2) BMI group (70.1%). 
In general, baseline disease characteristics were similar across the treatment groups. The mean baseline 
HbA1c was 8.5%. The mean duration of diabetes was 11 years. Sulfonylurea use at screening was 
reported by 34.9% of patients overall, with metformin use at baseline reported by 82.6% of patients 
overall. The mean glargine dose at Screening was 38.7 units/day in the EQW group and 39.0 units/day in 
the placebo group. After the insulin dose optimization phase, the mean glargine dose at baseline was 
50.1 units/day in the EQW group and 52.0 units/day in the placebo group. 
The mean baseline eGFR calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) method was 90.5 
mL/min/1.73m2, and the result was similar when the CKD-EPI calculation method was used. Most 
patients had baseline eGFR (MDRD) ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2, with no patients having eGFR <30 
mL/min/1.73m2. 
In general, medical and surgical history was similar across the treatment groups. The most commonly 
reported medical history terms were hypertension (79.7%), hyperlipidaemia (36.7%), diabetic 
neuropathy (24.6%), and obesity (23.8%).The most commonly reported surgical history terms were 
hysterectomy (15.6%), cholecystectomy (9.9%), appendectomy (7.3%), and tonsillectomy (5.2%).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 28  
Mean HbA1c decreased from baseline to Week 28 in both treatment groups. The least squares (LS) mean 
change in HbA1c was -0.96% for the EQW group and -0.23% for the placebo group. The difference in LS 
mean change between the EQW group and the placebo group was -0.73% (p<0.001)

Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint 
The results for each of the planned supportive and sensitivity analyses were consistent with those of the 
primary analysis. 
To provide a comprehensive view of the treatment effect in accordance with the pure ITT principle, data 
collected post rescue therapy or treatment discontinuation and post rescue therapy were included as 
additional supportive analyses using the same MMRM model as that for the primary efficacy analysis of 
HbA1c. Including measurements post rescue therapy or treatment discontinuation, the LS mean change 
in HbA1c was -0.94% for the EQW group and -0.24% for the placebo group. The difference in LS mean 
change between the EQW group and the placebo group was -0.70% (p<0.001). 
These results are consistent with the primary MMRM analysis which was analysed without data collected 
post rescue therapy or treatment discontinuation.

Glycaemic endpoints: 
EQW was superior to placebo in reducing 2-hour PPG after a standard MTT at Week 28. 
The difference between EQW and placebo for change from baseline to Week 28 in mean daily insulin dose 
was not statistically significant.  
A larger proportion of patients in the EQW group (22.1%) achieved HbA1c <7.0% at week 28 with no 
weight gain and no major hypoglycaemia over 28 weeks than in the placebo group (2.6%). However, the 
comparison of proportions between treatments was not tested for statistical significance because the 
comparison of treatments for the previous secondary endpoint in the hierarchy of statistical analyses 
(i.e., change in daily insulin dose) was not statistically significant. 
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
FPG was an exploratory end-point in the study. Basal insulin was titrated throughout the study in order to 
achieve the treatment target of FPG 4.0-5.5 mmol/L. There was a greater change in FPG from baseline to 
Week 28 in the EQW group compared to the placebo group. 
The change in FPG over time from baseline to Week 28 is presented graphically in Figure 2. Mean FPG 
decreased from Week 1 to Week 4 and then remained stable over time for the EQW group; there were no 
relevant changes in FPG over time for the placebo group.

Body weight endpoints 
Mean body weight decreased from baseline to Week 28 by 1.04 kg in the EQW group and increased by 
0.46 kg in the placebo group. The difference in LS mean change between treatment groups was 1.50 kg 
(p<0.001). 
Blood pressure 
There was a numerical decrease in SBP in the EQW group compared with baseline; however, there was no 
difference in SBP compared with placebo (nominal p=0.129).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study D5553C00002 was a 28-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, Phase 3 
efficacy and safety study of once weekly exenatide therapy added to titrated basal insulin glargine 
compared to placebo added to titrated basal insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) who have inadequate glycaemic control on basal insulin glargine with or without metformin. 
Overall the study population is adequate for the purpose of the study and the study duration is sufficient 
to allow assessment of the short-term effect on HbA1c. 
A double-blinded study design was chosen, which is acknowledged considering that EQW is to be injected 
subcutaneously.  
The overall approach to the statistical analysis and sensitivity analyses are acceptable and covering the 
various aspects that should be addressed. There is however some comments on the choice of the primary 
analysis method and data set.  
The definition of the ITT data set excludes patients without post-baseline HbA1c assessment. These 
subjects should preferably be included in the primary analysis set; however, in this study only 1 patient in 
each treatment group was excluded hence similar results would be expected with an all randomised 
analysis set.  
The primary analysis model, a mixed model repeated measures model, no explicit imputation of missing 
assessments is performed. Considering that missing at random (MAR) seldom is a plausible assumption 
the planned sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the primary analysis to departures from the 
MAR assumption is endorsed. Generally, the preferred analysis is one with which a continued treatment 
benefit after study treatment discontinuation is avoided. Given the model used, of importance for the 
credibility of the estimated primary outcome is to what extent subjects stayed in a study and contributed 
with data.  
The n presented in the table of the results of the primary analysis are the number of patients with 
observed baseline and week-28 values. The descriptive statistics presented are based on 206 and 207 
patients in the respective treatments groups. However, it is understood that all Intent-to-treat patients 
(231 and 230 patients) are included in the MMRM analysis. There is a discrepancy in number of patients 
between the analyses using different statistical models, i.e. MMRM and ANCOVA, due to difference in 
available data and imputed data for a particular analysis. For the primary endpoint 206 and 207 patients 
have available data and 25 and 23 with missing data, in the respective treatment groups. The analysis 
based on ANCOVA included 227 in active treatment group and 230 patients in the placebo group with 
observed baseline and week-28 values, which is understood to include imputed values.  
A sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint based on all randomised patients using a conservative 
imputation approach in case data is missing (e.g. ANCOVA with BOCF) was provided as requested. 
Analyses should be performed both with and without censoring of post rescue therapy and post study 
treatment discontinuation. In at least one analysis patients with missing endpoint data, patients in need 
of rescue therapy and patients who discontinued the study and/or study treatment should be handled as 
treatment failures using baseline observation carried forward (BOCF). 
The relevance of why data collected while subjects where on rescue were to be treated as missing can 
Assessment report  
EMA/717429/2017 
Page 24/42 
 
  
  
 
 
further be discussed. With the primary approach excluding data after rescue, used for analyses of primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints, only data collected up to the time-point for when a subject needed 
rescue was used to estimate treatment efficacy. Hence, what will further have an impact on the primary 
outcome is to what extent subjects were in need of rescue. What is to be considered the most appropriate 
approach may (at the planning stage) depend on study design and objective. In a superiority study 
versus placebo, in theory, if the experimental treatment works, the approach where including data 
collected after starting on rescue treatment should result in a more conservative estimate.  
The sensitivity approach using the CR approach is considered a reasonably conservative method for 
handling of missing data that is not considered missing at random. Patients in the active treatment group 
are assigned a placebo-like value and the placebo treated patients are assigned a value that does not 
punish the placebo treatment. The tipping point analysis is also supported as a useful way to assess 
MNAR data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy data with regard to the primary endpoint, reduction in HbA1c, supports the use of exenatide as 
an add-on treatment to insulin therapy. Secondary endpoints are consistent with this view.  
In the exenatide treated group the mean change from baseline in HbA1c was -0.96% compared to the 
placebo group which had a reduction of -0.23% from the baseline levels of 8.5% in both groups 
(estimated treatment difference -0.73% (95% CI: -0.93, -0.53; p<0.001). It is noted that during the 
eight week insulin dose optimization phase prior to study start, mean HbA1c decreased on average 0.6%. 
Relative to this effect, HbA1c decrease during the 28 week long study suggests that insulin optimization 
therapy was less aggressive once the study was initiated.  
The most conservative sensitivity analysis using baseline observation carried forward imputation for 
missing data after excluding data post-rescue and post-premature treatment discontinuation alters the 
estimated difference between treatments to -0.62 with a 95% 2-sided CI (-0.80, -0.44). 
The change in FPG over time showed a significant reduction in the exenatide group from week 2 and 
onwards throughout the study, whereas FPG did not change over time in the placebo group. The 
relatively flat FPG curve in the placebo group may further indicate that the insulin therapy was not 
optimized, i.e. more insulin could perhaps have been administered. At each visit during the study (week 
1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24) before the final visit week 28, FPG was measured and insulin dosage should 
be adjusted according to the INITIATE algorithm. However, at each of the eight visits, mean FPG in the 
placebo group was higher than the baseline value of 8.0 mmol/l. Target FPG levels were thus not reached 
in the insulin treated placebo group. The MAH acknowledges that insulin titration did not occur to the 
extent that was expected and that insulin titration plateaued after randomisation to study drug. However, 
insulin titration was not significantly different between the two groups over 28 weeks. Two explanations 
for the sub-optimal insulin titration are presented by the MAH; concerns about hypoglycaemia, and 
clinical inertia. Both explanations appear reasonable. The MAH claims that in this regard, study results are 
more consistent with real world clinical practice, in which the dose of insulin often remains unchanged 
despite poor glycaemic control. This may be true but it is important that the study is adequately reflected 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC. The wording is considered acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The study D5553C00002 provided supports the use of EQW in combination with basal insulin. In this 
study exenatide treatment led to a slight reduction in body weight. Basal insulin treatment on the 
contrary led to a small increase in body weight. In this regard the combination of basal insulin and 
Assessment report

exenatide could be a rational option for T2D patients where weight gain should be minimised and when 
there is a need for improvement of the metabolic control.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety and tolerability of exenatide as both single agent therapy and in combination with other 
therapies for T2DM, including metformin, were thoroughly documented and evaluated in the clinical 
development programme for BYDUREON. 
The most frequent adverse reactions reported with EQW were mainly gastrointestinal related (nausea 
which was the most frequent reaction and associated with the initiation of treatment and decreased over 
time, and diarrhoea). In addition, injection site reactions (pruritus, nodules, erythema), hypoglycaemia 
(with a sulphonylurea), and headache occurred. Most adverse reactions associated with prolonged-release 
exenatide were mild to moderate in intensity. The risk of hypoglycaemia is low and dependent on the 
background therapy used.  
Since immediate-release exenatide has been marketed, acute pancreatitis has been reported with a 
frequency not known and acute renal failure has been reported uncommonly. 
Patient exposure 
Both the mean duration of exposure to study medication and the proportion of patients in the exposure 
categories were similar across treatment groups in Study D5553C00002. The mean duration of 
exenatide/placebo exposure was 189.7 days in the EQW group and 191.4 days in the placebo group. 
Adverse events 
Hypoglycaemia was recorded on a separate CRF throughout the study, separate from other AEs. 
Adverse events and SAEs were reported by similar numbers of patients in both treatment groups (Table 
8).

Common adverse events  
The most commonly reported AEs (frequency ≥5% in any treatment group) by preferred term (PT) were 
urinary tract infection, nausea, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, and injection site nodule. Events 
of blood creatine phosphokinase increased were more common in the placebo group and injection site 
nodules were more common in the EQW group (Table 9).

Table 9 
All adverse events 
There was a >1% difference in the proportion of patients in the EQW group compared with the placebo 
group reported AEs in the following SOCs: gastrointestinal disorders (EQW, 15.1%; placebo, 10.8%); 
general disorders and administration site conditions (EQW, 12.1%; placebo, 6.1%); vascular disorders 
(EQW, 4.3%; placebo, 2.6%); skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (EQW, 3%; placebo, 1.7%); and 
psychiatric disorders (EQW, 2.2%; placebo, 0.4%). 
Adverse events of nausea, diarrhoea, and dyspepsia were more common in the EQW group (5.2%, 4.7%, 
and 2.2%, respectively) compared with the placebo group (3.9%, 3.5%, and 0%, respectively). 
No malignancies were reported during the study other than one event of malignant skin neoplasms (PT: 
squamous cell carcinoma) in the EQW group. 
Adverse events reported as related to study drug 
Adverse events reported as related to study medication (EQW or placebo) as judged by the investigator 
were reported more frequently in the EQW group than in the placebo group. 
Adverse events related to study medication (EQW or placebo) were reported by 41 patients (17.7%) in 
the EQW group and 27 patients (11.7%) in the placebo group. The most common AEs related to study 
medication or titrated basal insulin were injection site nodule (EQW, 5.2%; placebo, 0.4%), nausea 
(3.0% and 2.6%, respectively), diarrhoea (2.2% and 1.3%, respectively), and injection site pruritus 
(1.7% and 1.3%, respectively). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The frequency and types of SAEs during the 28-week treatment period were low and similar across 
treatment groups. Serious AEs were reported by 11 patients (4.7%) in the EQW group and 11 patients 
(4.8%) in the placebo group. More SAEs were reported in the SOC of psychiatric disorders for the EQW 
group (1.3%) compared with the placebo group (0%). At the PT level, no SAE was reported by more than 
1 patient (0.4%) per treatment group, with the exception of cardiac failure congestive and 
musculoskeletal chest pain, each reported by 2 patients (0.9%) in the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/717429/2017 
Page 28/42 
 
  
  
 
 
One patient in the placebo group died during the study. The patient experienced an SAE of pneumonia 
and the cause of death was adjudicated as undetermined. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Incidence of hypoglycaemia 
There were no events of major hypoglycaemia. Events of minor and other hypoglycaemia occurred in a 
similar number of patients in each treatment group. Events of minor hypoglycaemia were reported in 13 
patients (5.6%) in both the EQW (31 events) and placebo (28 events) groups. Events of other 
hypoglycaemia (defined as not meeting the criteria for major or minor hypoglycaemia) were reported in 
68 patients (29.3%; 331 events) in the EQW group and 64 patients (27.7%; 311 events) in the placebo 
group. 
Adjudicated CV events 
There were 3 confirmed adjudicated CV events in the study (cardiac failure congestive, myocardial 
infarction and ventricular fibrillation), all in the placebo group. 
Pancreatic carcinoma related- or thyroid neoplasm-related events 
No pancreatic carcinoma-related events or thyroid neoplasm-related events were reported during the 
study. 
Injection site-related events 
Injection site-related events were reported in 18 patients (7.8%) in the EQW group and 7 patients 
(3.0%) in the placebo group. All events were mild or moderate in intensity and most were considered 
related to study medication by the investigator. Adverse events of injection site nodule and injection site 
erythema were more common in the EQW group (5.2% and 1.3%, respectively) compared with placebo 
group (0.4% and 0%, respectively). 
Gastrointestinal-related events 
Gastrointestinal-related events were reported in 35 patients (15.1%) in the EQW group and 25 patients 
(10.8%) in the placebo group, and these events were mostly mild or moderate in intensity. The most 
commonly reported gastrointestinal-related AEs were nausea (EQW, 5.2%; placebo, 3.9%) and diarrhoea 
(EQW, 4.7%; placebo, 3.5%), none of which were reported as SAEs. 
Vital signs  
Pulse rate increased from baseline to Week 28 by 2.5 beats/min in the EQW group and remained 
unchanged in the placebo group (mean change from baseline, 0.2 beats/min). 
Laboratory findings 
Creatinine elevations 1.5x higher than pre-treatment creatinine were greater in the EQW group (20 
patients [8.6%]) compared with the placebo group (12 patients [5.2%]). In the EQW group, 14 of the 20 
patients had one-time elevations in creatinine. Despite being >1.5x higher than pre-treatment values, the 
creatinine values remained within the normal range in 11 of the 20 EQW patients. Of these 20 EQW 
patients, 16 had normal creatinine values and 4 had high values at the last collection; of the 4 high 
values, 3 were less than 1.5x the pre-treatment value. None of the creatinine elevations in the EQW 
group were reported as AEs. 
Creatine kinase elevations of >10x ULN were reported for more patients in the placebo group (4 patients; 
1.7%) compared to the EQW group (no patients).

Anti-exenatide antibodies  
Anti-exenatide antibodies were observed in 76.0% of patients in the EQW group at any time during the 
study. The mean proportion of patients positive for anti-exenatide antibodies plateaued at Week 8 and 
remained stable through the end of treatment period. The proportion of patients with high positive 
antibody titer (≥625) peaked at Week 8 (27.0%) and then decreased over time to the lowest proportion 
at Week 28 (12.9%). At Week 28, the mean change from baseline HbA1c in the EQW group was similar in 
patients with any positive antibodies (-1.05%) compared with patients who were antibody negative (-
0.88%), and greater in patients who were low-titer antibody positive (-1.19%) compared with patients 
who were high-titer antibody positive (-0.48%). As observed in previous EQW clinical studies, injection 
site-related AEs were more common among patients who were antibody positive (7.3%) than those who 
were antibody negative (0.4%).  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Greater proportions of patients discontinued study treatment because of an AE and had an AE that was 
considered to be related to study treatment in the EQW group compared with placebo.  
Discontinuation of study medication (EQW or placebo) because of an AE was reported for 9 patients 
(3.9%) in the EQW group and 4 patients (1.7%) in the placebo group. More patients in the EQW group (4 
patients [1.7%]) discontinued due to AEs in the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders compared with the 
placebo group (1 patient [0.4%]). At the PT level, no AE leading to discontinuation was reported by more 
than 1 patient per treatment group. 
Post marketing experience 
Limited data are available from post-marketing reports of concomitant use of EQW and titrated basal 
insulin. Given the cumulative exposure estimate for the exenatide twice daily and EQW formulations (over 
3,117,218 and 1,307,511 patient-years, respectively), the overall patient-years of exposure for exenatide 
is estimated to be over 4.4 million patient-years for the cumulative period ending 31 March 2017. 
The important identified risks with EQW (pancreatitis, acute renal failure, rapid weight loss, and injection 
site reactions) and important potential risks (risks associated with anti-exenatide antibodies [focus on 
anaphylactic-type reactions], cardiac events, pancreatic cancer, thyroid neoplasms, administration error, 
malignant neoplasm following combination treatment with insulin [this risk is an imposition in the EU Risk 
Management Plan; ie, not the Company position]) for exenatide are described in the EU Risk Management 
Plans for BYETTA and BYDUREON, 13 January 2016. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
With study D5553C00002, 28 week data on the concomitant treatment with exenatide and insulin has 
been provided. A total of 463 patients were included in the safety data set out of which 232 received 
exenatide. The mean duration of exposure to exenatide was about 190 days. The overall reporting of AEs 
was fairly balanced between the EQW group (54%) compared to the placebo group (58%). Treatment 
related AEs were more common in the EQW treated group (18%) than in the placebo group (12%). 
GI events were more common with EQW (15%) than with placebo (11%). AEs judged as drug related 
were mainly GI events and injection site reactions, in line with the known safety profile for exenatide. 
The frequency and types of SAEs during the 28-week treatment period were low and similar across 
treatment groups. Serious AEs were reported by 11 patients (4.7%) in the EQW group and 11 patients 
(4.8%) in the placebo group. At the PT level, no SAE was reported by more than 1 patient (0.4%) per 
treatment group, with the exception of cardiac failure congestive and musculoskeletal chest pain, each 
reported by 2 patients (0.9%) in the placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/717429/2017 
Page 30/42 
 
  
  
No malignancies were reported during the study other than one event of squamous cell carcinoma in the 
EQW group. 
One patient in the placebo group died during the study. The patient experienced an SAE of pneumonia 
and the cause of death was adjudicated as undetermined. 
Hypoglycaemia was an AE of special interest in the study. There were no events of major hypoglycaemia. 
Events of minor (13 patients, 5.6% in each group) and other (68 patients (29%; 331 events) EQW, 64 
patients (27.7%; 311 events) placebo) hypoglycaemia occurred in a similar number of patients in each 
treatment group. Hypoglycaemia (with insulin) is proposed to be added as an adverse event in SmPC 
section 4.8, with the frequency common based on the observed frequency of minor events. This is 
endorsed. 
An increase in heart rate (2.5 bpm) was observed in the EQW group at week 28. These findings are 
consistent with results observed in other EQW studies. No increase was observed in the placebo group. 
Anti-exenatide antibodies were observed in 76.0% of patients in the EQW group at any time during the 
study. At Week 28, the mean change from baseline HbA1c in the EQW group was similar in patients with 
any positive antibodies (-1.05%) compared with patients who were antibody negative (-0.88%). Patients 
who were high-titer antibody positive seem to have a reduced effect (-0.48%). This is in line with 
previous observations. 
Injection site-related events were more common in patients with ADA. Increased injection site related 
AEs in patients with positive antibodies have also been observed in previous EQW studies. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new important safety issues have been brought forward from the current study. A combination 
treatment with insulin means that there will be risk for hypoglycaemia. The data does not indicate that 
the add-on treatment with exenatide will increase this risk compared to insulin treatment alone. 
Hypoglycaemia (with insulin) is proposed to be included in the SmPC, section 4.8, which is endorsed. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The updated RMP version 26 was initially submitted as part of this application. A consolidated updated 
version of the RMP, version 29, was subsequently submitted and assessed within the procedure. 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted RMP: 
The PRAC considered that the RMP version 29 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the RMP version 29 with the following content:

As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to hypoglycaemia (with insulin) has been added to the 
product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. The changes are as follows: 
4.1 Therapeutic indications 
Bydureon is indicated in adults 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic

control in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including basal insulin, when the 
therapy in use, together with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycaemic control (see section 
4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations). 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
. . . 
When used with insulin, prolonged-release exenatide and insulin must be administered as two separate 
injections. 
. . . 
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
. . . 
Concomitant medicinal products 
The concurrent use of prolonged-release exenatide with insulin, D-phenylalanine derivatives 
(meglitinides), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or other GLP-1 receptor 
agonists has not been studied. The concurrent use of prolonged-release and immediate-release exenatide 
has not been studied and is not recommended. 
. . . 
For changes in subsequent sections of the SmPC, including section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties, 
and consequential changes in the patient leaflet, see complete PI in attachment. 
Minor editorial changes were also made to the PI and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Favourable effects 
Study D5553C00002 was a 28-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicentre, Phase III 
efficacy and safety study of prolonged-release exanatide (exenatide once weekly; EQW 2 mg) versus 
placebo as add-on treatment to titrated basal insulin in patients with T2DM who had inadequate 
glycaemic control on titrated basal insulin with or without metformin. 
The primary objective of the study was met. The mean HbA1c decreased from baseline to Week 28 in 
both treatment groups. The least squares (LS) mean change in HbA1c was -0.96% for the EQW group 
and -0.23% for the placebo group. The difference in LS mean change between the EQW group and the 
placebo group was -0.73% (p<0.001). A larger proportion of patients treated with exenatide also reached 
HbA1c ≤ 7% at the end of the study (active 33%, placebo 7%, p<0.001). The study also reported a 
significant reduction in bodyweight compared to the placebo group (-1.5 95% CI -2.17, -0.84, p<0.001). 
These finding supports the proposed updated indication with concomitant insulin treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/717429/2017

3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The change in FPG during the study showed a significant reduction in the exenatide group from week 2 
and onwards throughout the study, whereas FPG did not change over time in the placebo group. The 
relatively flat FPG curve in the placebo group could indicate that the insulin therapy was not optimized. In 
fact, at each of the eight study visits, FPG in the placebo group was on average increased from the 
baseline value of 8.0 mmol/l. Therefore the size of the beneficial add-on effect of exenatide to optimised 
basal insulin therapy cannot be determined from the presented data. The study data however show that 
exenatide, when added to basal insulin treatment, provides a significant additional effect on metabolic 
control. 
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
With study D5553C00002, 28 week data on the concomitant treatment with exenatide and insulin has 
been provided. A total of 463 patients were included in the safety data set out of which 232 received 
exenatide. The mean duration of exposure to exenatide was about 190 days. The overall reporting of AEs 
was fairly balanced between the EQW group (54%) compared to the placebo group (58%). Treatment 
related AEs were more common in the EQW treated group (18%) than in the placebo group (12%). AEs 
judged as drug related were mainly GI events and injection site reactions, in line with the known safety 
profile for exenatide. Because of the established risk profile of insulin, hypoglycaemia was an AE of 
special interest in the study. There were no events of major hypoglycaemia. Events of minor (13 patients, 
5.6% in each group) and other hypoglycaemias occurred in a similar number of patients in each 
treatment group (68 patients (29%; 331 events) EQW, 64 patients (27.7%; 311 events) placebo). 
Hypoglycaemia (with insulin) is added as an adverse event in SmPC section 4.8. Overall in this study no 
new serious risks have been discovered for exenatide. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Only short-term data (28 weeks) of the treatment combination is yet available.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
When EQW was added to basal insulin treatment, a clinically relevant reduction of HbA1c was observed in 
combination with a slight reduction in body weight. This is considered of benefit, especially as this was 
shown in an over-weight, and difficult to treat, population of patients with T2DM. 
The safety data provided does not indicate that there is any additive toxicity or change in the safety 
profile, with the important exception of insulin related hypoglycaemia when exenatide is used 
concomitantly with insulin. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
T2DM is a progressive disease where metabolic control is often difficult to achieve. Once life style changes 
are insufficient to maintain metabolic control, metformin remains the first step in pharmaceutical 
treatment. Upon failure on metformin, current treatment guidelines recommend individualised treatment, 
combining existing treatment options based on the patient’s needs. A majority of T2DM patients is 
overweight and hypertensive, thus there is a need for treatment options which at least not aggravate 
these conditions.  
In this study exenatide once weekly treatment as add-on to basal insulin resulted in improved metabolic 
control in combination with a slight reduction in body weight. Basal insulin treatment alone on the 
contrary led to a small increase in body weight. Thus the combination of basal insulin and exenatide could 
be a rational option for T2D patients where weight gain should be minimised and when there is a need for 
improvement of the metabolic control. Exenatide add-on treatment with basal insulin could also be an 
option for patients that are prone to hypoglycaemic events, since exenatide do not seem to increase the 
risk for hypoglycaemia compared to intensified basal insulin therapy alone. 
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Bydureon (prolonged-release exenatide), including the combined use with basal 
insulin, is considered positive.

Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes

I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include treatment in combination with basal insulin for Bydureon; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated based on the study 
D5553C00002 (Duration 7 study) which evaluated safety and efficacy of exenatide once weekly therapy 
added to titrated basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control on 
basal insulin with or without metformin. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make minor corrections in sections 4.8 and 
5.1 of the SmPC. Furthermore, the consolidated RMP version 29 has been agreed.

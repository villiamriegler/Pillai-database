SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1 
Introduction 
Telzir tablet and oral suspension contains fosamprenavir (FPV) which is the phosphate ester pro-drug 
of the protease inhibitor (PI) amprenavir (APV) and was developed to reduce the large pill burden and 
pill  size  associated  with  the  amprenavir  (Agenerase)  soft  gelatin  capsule  formulation.  Telzir  is 
approved  for  use  in  combination  with  low  dose  ritonavir  (RTV)  for  the  treatment  of  Human 
Immunodeficiency  Virus  Type  1  (HIV-1)  infected  adults  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral 
medicinal products. The recommended dose for adults is 700 mg twice daily, combined with 100 mg 
ritonavir twice daily.  
At  the  time  of  approval  of  the  initial  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  (indication  for  use  of  Telzir  in 
adults;  12  July  2004),  no  paediatric  data  were  available.  The  MAH  had  committed  to  provide 
paediatric data by 31 December 2006. The present variation was submitted to extend the indication to 
include the use of Telzir tablet and oral suspension in paediatric patients. Hence, this Type II variation 
was submitted to address the post-authorisation commitment undertaken by the MAH in their letter of 
undertaking dated 24 March 2004. 
It  is  relevant  to  mention  that  Agenerase  (amprenavir)  is  already  approved  in  the  EU  for  use  in 
combination therapy for paediatric patients aged 4 years and above (dose 17 mg/kg oral solution three 
times daily). Because of the potential risk of toxicity from the large amount of the excipient, propylene 
glycol in Agenerase oral solution, it is contraindicated in infants and children below 4 years of age. 
Telzir oral suspension represents a significant improvement in that respect as it contains significantly 
lower  concentrations  of  propylene  glycol  (10.2  mg/ml  compared  with  550  mg/ml);  this  extends  the 
potential  option  of  fosamprenavir  treatment  to  children  below  the  age  of  4  years.  In  addition,  the 
fosamprenavir oral suspension contains no Vitamin E (compared with 46 IU/ml for Agenerase) and is 
more concentrated (50 mg/ml compared with 15 mg/ml), reducing the volume required per dose. 
The MAH performed three dose finding open Phase II studies (still ongoing) in paediatric patients of 
which  2  studies,  namely  Study  APV29005  and  Study  APV20003,  are  considered  most  relevant  for 
establishing  the  current  dosing  recommendation.  In  study  APV29005,  twice  daily  doses  of 
fosamprenavir  (with  or  without  ritonavir)  were  administered  to  75  children  aged  2-18  years  for  48-
weeks.  Dosing  and  analysis  were  performed  by  age  groups  (2-5,  6-11  and  12-18  years).  In  study 
APV20003,  a  once  daily  regimen  was  investigated  in  children  aged  2-18  years,  and  in  Study  APV 
20002, fosamprenavir oral solution + ritonavir were  administered to 10 children aged < 2 years old. 
The MAH considered Study APV29005 as pivotal, and the other two studies (the one with the once 
daily regimen (APV20003) and the other in the very young (APV20002)) as supplementary.  
Based  on  the  study  outcomes  regarding  safety  and PK  simulation  data  (compared  to  reference  adult 
plasma levels), the MAH proposed the following posology for children:  
•  For children aged 2-5 years old: fosamprenavir/ritonavir 20/3 mg/kg twice daily 
•  For  patients  aged  ≥  6  years  old:  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  18/3  mg/kg  twice  daily,  up  to  the 
standard adult fixed dose regimen of 700/100 mg twice daily for children and adolescents > 39 
kg 
As a reminder, for a 70 kg adult, the dose is 10 mg/kg fosamprenavir twice daily in combination with 
ritonavir 100mg twice daily. 
Due to few participants in study APV20002 and insufficient plasma exposure achieved after even 4.5-
fold  higher  doses/kg  than  in  adults,  no  dosing  recommendations  could  be  made  for  the  very  young 
(children < 2 years old).  
For  this  application  the  CPMP  HIV  guideline  “Guideline  on  the  clinical  development  of  medicinal 
products  for  the  treatment  of  HIV  infection”  is  applicable  (November  2005  CPMP/EWP/633/02, 
Rev. 1).

Non-Clinical  
No new non-clinical data were submitted in support of this variation application. The juvenile toxicity 
studies submitted in the framework of the original Marketing Authorisation Application for Telzir and 
in  the  framework  of  post-marketing  follow-up  indicate  that  the  safety  profile  of  fosamprenavir  in 
children ≥2 years of age is unlikely to be different to that seen in adult patients and support the safe 
clinical use of fosamprenavir in HIV-infected paediatric patients 2 to 18 years of age at the proposed 
recommend doses.

Clinical pharmacology – Pharmacokinetics  
Due  to  the  different  dosage  regimens  employed  within  both  studies  (twice  daily  vs.  once  daily, 
boosted  vs.  unboosted,  different  mg/kg  doses),  evaluable  plasma  amprenavir  pharmacokinetic  (PK) 
data  for  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  regimens  in  APV20003  and  APV29005  are  very  limited;  especially 
for  the  proposed  twice  daily  regimen,  only  a  very  limited  amount  of  plasma  amprenavir  data  is 
presented (table 1).

Main Study APV29005 
Study Design 
Study  APV29005  is  a  Phase  II,  open-label,  48-week  study  designed  to  evaluate  plasma  amprenavir 
pharmacokinetics,  safety,  and  antiviral  activity  of  fosamprenavir  twice  daily  in  HIV-1  infected,  PI-
naïve  patients  2  to  5  years  old  and  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  in  PI-naïve  and  PI-
experienced  patients  2  to  18  years  old.    Subjects  receiving  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  were 
enrolled  into  age-defined  cohorts  of  2  to  5  years,  6  to  11  years,  and  12  to  18  years.  At  the  time  of 
submission, insufficient PK data in the 2 to 5 year old cohort was available; therefore, this group is not 
discussed within this report.  
Subjects received concurrent NRTIs and patients older than 6 years of age could receive enfuvirtide; 
NNRTIs  and  other  PIs  were  not  allowed  during  the  study.    Subjects  and/or  their  parents/legal 
guardians  were  instructed  to  administer  the  fosamprenavir  oral  suspension  with  food  in  order  to 
accommodate  the  frequent  eating  schedule  of  children,  to  enhance  adherence  through  taste  masking 
with  food,  and  to  improve  tolerability.    For  patients  in  each  age  cohort,  serial  PK  sampling  was 
conducted at Week 2 and trough sampling was conducted at all subsequent visits.   
Pharmacokinetic Population 
Seventy-five  (75)  patients  were  enrolled,  67  patients  provided  plasma  amprenavir  Cτ  data  and 
51 patients provided full plasma amprenavir PK profiles.

Pharmacokinetic Results 
Fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily in Patients 6 to 11 Years Old 
Compared to the historical adult population receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100mg twice daily, 
paediatric  patients  6  to  11  years  old,  receiving  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  15/3  mg/kg  twice  daily  had 
13%  lower  plasma  amprenavir  AUC(0-τ)  and  23%  lower  Cmax  values,  but  similar  Cτ  values; 
whereas, patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 18/3 mg/kg twice daily had 26% higher AUC(0-τ) 
and similar Cmax and Cτ values (table 2).  Three 6 to 11 year old patients who weighed at least 39kg 
and  received  the  adult  tablet  regimen  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  700/100mg  twice  daily  had  similar 
plasma amprenavir AUC(0-τ) and Cmax values, but 17% lower  Cτ values compared to adult values 
(table 2). 
Paediatric patients 6 to 11 years old who received fosamprenavir 15 mg/kg or fosamprenavir 18 mg/kg 
in combination with ritonavir 3 mg/kg twice daily had 51% higher plasma ritonavir AUC(0-τ), similar 
Cmax,  and  2.58-fold  higher  Cτ  values  than  observed  in  the  historical  adult  population.    Similarly, 
paediatric  patients  6  to  11  years  old  who  weighed  at  least  33  kg  and  received  ritonavir  100 mg 
capsules  had  43%  higher  plasma  ritonavir  AUC(0-τ),  similar  Cmax,  and  3.04-fold  higher  Cτ  values 
than observed in the historical adult population.

Fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily in Patients 12 to 18 Years Old 
The  majority  of  patients  in  the  12  to  18  year  old  age  group  received  the  adult  tablet  regimen  of 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir 700/100mg twice daily.  Compared to the historical adult population receiving 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir  700/100mg  twice  daily,  12  to  18  year  old  patients  had  20%  lower  plasma 
amprenavir AUC(0-τ), 23% lower Cmax, and 20% lower Cτ values (table 3).  Four patients in the 12 
to 18 year old age group received fosamprenavir oral suspension at a dose of fosamprenavir/ritonavir 
4/26
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15/3 mg/kg twice daily and plasma amprenavir AUC(0-τ) was 41% lower, Cmax 30% lower, and Cτ 
33% lower than observed in the historical adult population (table 3). 
All of the 12 to 18 year old patients, except two patients who turned 12 years old during the study, 
received  ritonavir  100  mg  capsules.    Compared  to  the  historical  adult  population  receiving 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir  700/100  mg  twice  daily,  12  to  18  year  old  patients  had  20%  higher  plasma 
ritonavir AUC(0-τ), similar Cmax, and 33% higher Cτ values.

First Supportive Study APV20003 – once daily regimen 
Study Design 
Study  APV20003  is  a  Phase  II,  open-label,  48-week  study  designed  to  evaluate  plasma  amprenavir 
pharmacokinetics, safety, and antiviral activity of fosamprenavir/ritonavir once daily in antiretroviral-
naïve  and  -experienced  patients  2  to  18  years  of  age.    Patients  were  enrolled  into  three  age-defined 
strata of 2 to 5, 6 to 11, and 12 to 18 years.  Per protocol amendment ten patients (six in the 2 to 5, 
three in the 6 to 11, and one in the 12 to 18 year old age groups) switched to fosamprenavir/ritonavir 
twice daily regimens.  
Patients  received  concurrent  NRTIs.  NNRTIs  and  other  PIs  were  not  allowed  during  the  study.  
Patients  and/or  their  parents/legal  guardians  were  instructed  to  administer  the  fosamprenavir  oral 
suspension  with  food  in  order  to  accommodate  the  frequent  eating  schedule  of  children,  to  enhance 
adherence  through  taste  masking  with  food,  and  to  improve  tolerability.    For  patients  in  each  age

stratum,  serial  PK  sampling  was  conducted  at  Week  4  and  trough  sampling  was  conducted  at  all 
subsequent visits.   
Pharmacokinetic Population 
Sixty-nine  (69)  patients  were  enrolled,  55  patients  provided  plasma  amprenavir  Cτ  data  and 
26 patients  provided  full  plasma  amprenavir  PK  profiles  for  the  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  30/6  mg/kg 
  Two  additional  patients  provided  plasma  amprenavir  Cτ  data  for 
once  daily  regimen. 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily only.  
Pharmacokinetic Results 
For 12 to 18 year old patients receiving either the fosamprenavir/ritonavir 30/6 mg/kg once daily or 
the fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg once daily regimen, plasma amprenavir AUC(0-τ) and Cmax 
appeared similar to and Cτ appeared approximately 20% lower than values historically observed for 
adult patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg once daily.  
For 6 to 11 year old patients receiving the fosamprenavir/ritonavir 30/6 mg/kg once daily regimen, on 
average,  plasma  amprenavir  AUC(0-τ)  was  27%  lower  and  Cmax  was  30%  lower;  whereas,  Cτ 
appeared  similar  to  values  historically  observed  for  adult  patients  receiving  fosamprenavir/ritonavir 
1400/200 mg once daily.   
For 2 to 5 year old patients receiving the fosamprenavir/ritonavir 30/6 mg/kg once daily regimen, on 
average, plasma amprenavir AUC(0-τ) was 30% lower, Cmax was 34% lower, and Cτ was 30% lower 
than  values  historically  observed  for  adult  patients  receiving  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  1400/200  mg 
once daily. 
Second Supportive Study APV20002 – very young children (< 2 years) 
Study Design 
Study  APV20002  is  a  Phase  II,  open-label,  48-week  study  designed  to  evaluate  plasma  amprenavir 
pharmacokinetics, safety, and antiviral activity of Fosamprenavir alone twice daily in HIV-1 infected, 
PI-naïve,  paediatric  patients  and  of  Fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  in  PI-naïve  and  PI-
experienced paediatric patients 4 weeks to <2 years old.   
Data from patients below the age of two are presented although currently no dosing recommendation 
can be given for this age group. Patients received concurrent NRTIs. NNRTIs and other PIs were not 
allowed.  Parents/legal guardians were instructed to administer the study drugs with food in order to 
accommodate  the  frequent  eating  schedule  of  children,  to  enhance  adherence  through  taste  masking 
with food, and to improve tolerability.   
Pharmacokinetic Population 
All 13 enrolled patients underwent PK sampling during the study and 12 patients provided evaluable 
data.  Eleven patients provided plasma amprenavir PK profiles after administration of a single dose of 
fosamprenavir  30mg/kg.    Nine  patients  provided  steady-state  plasma  amprenavir  and  ritonavir  PK 
profiles at Week 2 and Cτ data at subsequent visits. 
Pharmacokinetic Results 
Nine  6  to  <24-month  old  paediatric  patients  receiving  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  regimens 
ranging  from  29.4/5.6  to  51.1/8.2  mg/kg  twice  daily  had  steady-state  plasma  CL/F  values  that  were 
markedly higher than those observed in the historical adult population (table 4).

PK  parameter  values  were  highly  variable  (CVb%  ranging  from  113  to  165%  across  the  PK 
parameters) for the paediatric patients 6 to <24 months old. Co-administration of fosamprenavir with 
ritonavir  in  paediatric  patients  6  to  <24  months  significantly  reduced  plasma  amprenavir  CL/F  by 
approximately 60%. 
Compared to the historical adult population, a subset of five paediatric patients ages 6 to <24 months 
receiving  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  45/7  mg/kg  twice  daily  demonstrated  that  despite  an  approximate 
5-fold increase in fosamprenavir and ritonavir doses on a mg/kg basis, plasma amprenavir AUC(0-τ) 
was approximately 48% lower, Cmax 26% lower, and Cτ 29% lower in the paediatric patients.   
Population PK model 
The MAH developed a PPK model using pooled data from all three paediatric studies. The advantage 
of  population  modelling  is  that  plasma  samples  from  studies  with  different  dosing  regimens  (once 
daily and twice daily) and sparse and rich sampling could be integrated in one model. From the model, 
exposure data for different dosing regimens and different age groups were simulated, in search of an 
optimal dosing schedule. 
Population characteristics 
The dataset was comprised of 137 patients aged 0.72-18 years, contributing 1322 plasma amprenavir 
concentrations.  The  median  age  was  10  years.  Body  weight  ranged  form  5.9-102.8  kg.  Baseline 
alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations ranged from 0.41-2.69 g/l. Only 18 patients received 
no ritonavir. In 33 cases, fosamprenavir was administered in fasted state.  
Structural model 
Data  were  analysed  using  nonlinear  mixed-effect  modelling  (NONMEM  version  V  1.1).  Data  were 
fitted to a two-compartment model plus an absorption compartment. The chosen parameters were Ka 
(absorption constant), V2/F (central compartment), CL/F (clearance from central compartment), V3/F 
(peripheral  compartment)  and  Q  (inter-compartmental  clearance).  CL  and  V  were  modelled  as  a 
function of weight (allometric scaling with 0.75 exponent).  
In  the  base  model,  food,  ritonavir  intake  and  fosamprenavir  formulation  (tablet  or  oral  suspension) 
were taken into account.  
Inter-individual variability (IIV, symbolised by η) could be estimated for V2/F, CL/F and Q, but not 
for Ka. A co-variance term was defined for V2/F and CL/F (meaning that during estimating of IIV for 
CL  and  V2,  co-variance  between  these  two  parameters  is  accounted  for).  Inter-occasion  variability 
(IOV) was estimated for CL/F. The error model was described by proportional + additive error. The 
FOCE-INTERACTION method was used throughout model development.

Final model 
Co-variates race, gender and AAG level were included. Despite the fact that weight was included in 
the basic model, still a part of the variability of CL and V could be explained by gender and age.  
Population PK estimates 
PPK  parameter  estimates  are  presenting  a  male  child  10  years  (35  kg),  treated  with  suspension  and 
food.  CL  without  ritonavir  was  estimated  as  84  l/hr,  versus  34  l/hr  when  booster  ritonavir  was 
administered. For comparison, in an adult model, the unboosted CL/F was estimated as 91.8 l/hr and 
boosted  CL/F  as  21.5  l/hr.  Weight-adjusted  CL/F  is  expected  to  be  1.4  point  greater  in  younger 
children (age 1.09 year) compared to children aged > 4 years. The negative relationships between CL 
or V2 and AAG were reported before for adults (table 5). 
Bioavailability (F) for oral solution was estimated to be 13% lower with food. When fosamprenavir 
was administered as tablet, F is 9% higher compared to oral solution. F was 15% lower for girls, and 
6%  lower  for  African  children.  However,  the  95%  CI  of  these  categorical  co-variates  include  1, 
indicating that the effect could not be reliably estimated.

Validation 
The posterior predictive check, evaluation of residual distributions and goodness-of-fit plots indicated 
that the model described the data reasonably well. 
Simulation 
Using  the  final  population  PK  model,  simulations  were  completed  to  predict  twice  daily  dosage 
regimens  that  would  deliver  target  plasma  amprenavir  AUC  and  Cτ  levels  in  adults  (AUC:  37.0 
(mean)-64(max) µg/ml*hr, Cτ (=Cmin): 1.55 (minimal)-3.52 (maximal) µg/ml).  For the simulations, 
doses  were  not  to  exceed  the  adult  tablet  dosing  regimen  and  doses  were  administered  under  fed 
conditions.  Based on the simulations, the following fosamprenavir/ritonavir dosage regimens and age-
stratifications were predicted:  
•  2 to 5 years: 
•  ≤6 years: 
Fosamprenavir/ritonavir 23/3 mg/kg twice daily,  
Fosamprenavir  /ritonavir  18/3  mg/kg  twice  daily,  up  to  adult  tablet  dosage 
regimen of  
Fosamprenavir /ritonavir 700/100 mg twice daily.   
With these dosage regimens, the predicted plasma amprenavir plasma exposure values met the target 
for 2 to 11 year olds; for 12 to 18 year olds, the predicted geometric mean AUC(0-τ) and Cmin values 
were approximately 20% lower than the targeted adult exposure.   
Results 
The main predictors of plasma amprenavir exposure, as determined by change in CL/F, were: 
•  The  presence  or  absence  of  ritonavir,  where  co-administration  of  ritonavir  was  estimated  to 
decrease plasma amprenavir CL/F by approximately 60%. 
•  Age,  where  weight  adjusted  CL/F  was  estimated  to  be  1.4-fold  greater  in  the  youngest 
children (1.09 years) as compared to children ≥5 years of age. 
•  Body weight, with a range of typical population CL/F estimates of 6.6 to 46.2L/hr across the 
weight range in the dataset. 
•  AAG, with a range of typical population CL/F estimates of 22.5 to 55.6 l/hr across the AAG 
range of 0.4 to 1.5g/l. 
The main predictors of plasma amprenavir V2/F were: 
•  Body  weight,  with  a  range  of  typical  population  V2/F  estimates  of  32.1  to  432L  across  the 
weight range in the dataset. 
•  AAG, with a range of typical population V2/F estimates of 189 to 367L across the AAG range 
of 0.4 to 1.5g/l. 
Discussion on pharmacokinetics 
The  dose  recommendation  derived  from  the  PPK  model  for  children  above  the  age  of  six  is  in  line 
with the doses used in study APV29005 for this age group. The fact that for 12 to 18 year olds, the 
predicted  geometric  mean  AUC(0-τ)  and  Cmin  values  were  approximately  20%  lower  than  the 
targeted adult exposure in the PPK model are to some extent balanced by the efficacy data for this age 
group.  Nevertheless,  this  positive  clinical  outcome  needs  to  be  further  substantiated  in  the  ongoing 
studies. Concerns, however, remain with the age group of children below the age of six.  
The PPK model arrived at dosage recommendation for children that are based on kg BW and stratified 
into  two  age  groups  with  the  age  of  6  years  being  the  limit  between  the  two.  A  drawback  of  the 
currently  proposed  doses  based  on  these  age-classes  is  that  on  the  6th  birthday,  doses  should  be 
abruptly lowered.  
In  addition,  according  to  the  PPK  model,  higher  doses  (23/3  mg/kg  fosamprenavir/ritonavir)  were 
predicted for children 2 to 5 years of age than currently recommended (namely 20/3 mg/kg) and used 
in study APV29005. Assuming the validity of the PPK model, there is a risk of under-dosing when the 
study  is  continued  with  the  lower  dose.  Therefore,  this  study  design  should  be  amended  to  either 
include  a  high-dose  study  arm  (parallel-design)  where  children  are  treated  with  23/3  mg/kg  or  an 
9/26
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interim analysis at an early stage to evaluate the adequacy of the 20/3 mg/kg dosing in order to avoid 
sub-optimal  plasma  levels.  The  MAH  has  addressed  this  need  by  committing  to  amend  the  study 
protocol to include a high-dose study arm (see also attached Letter of Undertaking).  
Given the current absence of data in children aged 2 to 5 years in the recommended dosage regimen, 
questions raised in regards to the feasibility of the dose change at 6 years of age as well as the critical 
issue  of  potential  under  dosing  identified  by  the  PPK  model  remain  unsolved.  Therefore,  no 
conclusion on the adequacy of the dose recommendation in children below the age of six can currently 
be  reached.  This  will  have  to  await  the  results  of  this  age  group  from  study  APV  29005,  once  the 
above amendments have been incorporated in an amendment of the study protocol (see also attached 
Letter of Undertaking).  
The fact that in study APV20002 (very young children of 6 to 24 months of age) no sufficient plasma 
levels could be achieved even after administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir doses up to 4.5-fold the 
adult ones raises major concerns.  This may not only be explained by the relatively higher CL in this 
age group, but may be due to an insufficient absorption of the oral solution, possibly because of a short 
gastrointestinal transit time in small children, or because of frequent vomiting and diarrhoea in HIV-
infected children. The MAH should further research the underlying cause of this effect in the ongoing 
study (see also attached Letter of Undertaking). 
Even  though  no  dosing  recommendations  could  be  made  for  this  age  group  of  very  young  children 
(<2 years old) due to the small number of participants in study APV20002, the CHMP recommended 
that  a  warning  should  be  included  in  the  SPC  that  even  with  doses  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir 
45/7 mg/kg twice daily no sufficient plasma exposure levels were achieved in a number of patients.

Methods 
The main inclusion criterion for Studies APV29005 and APV20003 studies was similar: 
•  Patients for whom, following resistance testing where appropriate, an active NRTI backbone 
regimen consisting of two NRTIs could be constructed.  
Patients must have also met one of the following criteria: 
•  ART-naïve patients who have not received any length of therapy with NRTIs and/or NNRTIs 
in  study  APV29005.  APV20003  included  patients  with  ≤4  weeks  (28  days)  therapy  with  an 
NRTI, no previous therapy with an NNRTI and less than one week therapy with a PI. 
•  ART-experienced patients (with NRTIs NNRTIs and/or a PI). 
•  PI-naïve patients: defined as having received less than 1 week of any PI. 
10/26
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  PI-experienced  patients:  defined  as  having  prior  experience  with  no  more  than  three  PIs 
excluding  Agenerase.    Prior  ritonavir  boosted  PI  therapy  was  considered  as  only  one  PI  as 
long  as  the  ritonavir  dose  was  lower  than  that  recommended  for  use  of  ritonavir  as  an 
antiretroviral agent. 
The main exclusion criteria for both studies were similar and were: 
•  The patient had a prior history of having received amprenavir. 
•  The  patient  had  NNRTI  therapy  within  14  days  prior  to  study  drug  administration  or 
anticipated need for concurrent NNRTI therapy during the study period. 
•  The patient had a malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction which might 
interfere with drug absorption or render the patient unable to take oral medication. 
•  The  patient  had  any  serious  medical  condition  (e.g.,  haemoglobinopathy,  chronic  anaemia, 
diabetes,  cardiac  dysfunction,  and  hepatitis)  which,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  might 
compromise the safety of the patient. 
•  The  patient  had  current  Grade  2  or  higher  serum  lipase  within  28  days  prior  to  study  drug 
administration and/or history of clinically relevant pancreatitis within the previous 6 months. 
•  The  patient  had  Grade  3  or  4  transaminase  levels  (alanine  aminotransferase  and/or  aspartate 
aminotransferase within 28 days prior to study drug administration and/or clinically relevant 
hepatitis within the previous 6 months. 
•  Treatment  with  protocol-excluded  medications  within  28  days  prior  to  receiving  study 
medication or the anticipated need during the study. 
Demographics and disease characteristics 
Age  groups,  with  the  exception  of  FPV/RTV  recipients  in  the  2  to  5  year  age  group  (APV29005, 3 
patients vs. 17 in APV20003), were similarly represented across the two studies. The median age was 
12.0 years in both studies. Overall there were slightly more female patients than males, and patients 
were predominantly Caucasian.  
The majority of paediatric patients were either mildly (Class A) or moderately (Class B) symptomatic 
at  baseline  according  to  the  CDC  Classification  for  children  <13  years.    Likewise,  the  majority  of 
adolescents were CDC Class A or B at baseline.  
The  baseline  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  levels,  median  CD4+  cell  counts  and  CD4+  percentages  were 
similar among PI-naïve and PI-experienced patients (table 7).

There  were  differences  between  the  studies  with  regard  to  the  median  duration  of  prior  exposure  to

Abacavir/lamivudine  was  the  most  common  NRTI  initial  combination,  used  by  44%  (55/126)  of 
patients.  Most  PI-experienced  patients  enrolled  had  one  prior  PI  exposure  only  (predominantly 
nelfinavir). 
Antiviral response endpoints  
Antiviral responses endpoints for studies APV29005 and APV20003 were secondary and included the 
proportion  of  patients  with  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  <400  and  <50copies/ml  over  time,  changes  from 
baseline  in  HIV-1  RNA  over  time,  changes  from  baseline  in  helper-inducer  T-lymphocyte  surface 
antigen  (CD4+)  cell  counts  and  CD4+  cell  percentages  over  time.  In  both  studies,  HIV  Genotypic 
Resistance testing (Geneseq, Monogram Biosciences Inc) was to be performed at baseline and at the 
time  of  protocol-defined  virologic  failure.    Due  to  the  open-label,  non-comparative  design  of  the 
paediatric studies, no formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed.  Descriptive methods were 
thus  used  in  analysis  of  the  data  obtained  from  these  studies.  Intent-to-Treat  Exposed  ITT(E) 
Population  was  the  primary  population  for  the  antiviral  response  analysis  in  these  two  studies,  and 
consisted  of  all  patients  with  documented  evidence  of  having  received  at  least  one  dose  of 
investigational product. Analyses of antiviral response for the ITT(E) Population included the TLOVR 
algorithm and Observed analysis.

Results 
Patient disposition 
The  proportion  of  premature  discontinuation  was  higher  in  APV20003  (43%  versus  18%)  in  the 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir  treatment  groups.  Patients  listed  as  discontinued  for  “Other”  reasons  were 
mainly due to being unable to adhere to or tolerate the taste of fosamprenavir/ritonavir, too low plasma 
amprenavir concentration at the end of the dosing interval, very bad compliance for all antiretroviral 
drugs generally and a pregnancy (table 9).

Antiviral response 
The  majority  of  patients  in  both  studies  had  greater  than  48  weeks  of  exposure  to  study  treatment. 
However,  the  initially  submitted  interim  study  reports  do  not  present  antiviral  response  data  beyond 
Week 24 for Study APV29005 because 3 patients in this study receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice 
daily did not reach their Week 24 visit evaluation but were still on therapy as of the data cut-off date. 
They were therefore classified as virologic failures in the TLOVR algorithm. Across the two studies, 
similar  proportions  of  PI-naïve  patients  and  of  PI-experienced  patients  achieved  HIV-1  RNA 
<400copies/ml at Week 24 (table 10).

The  reasons  for  non-response  was  primarily  due  to  virological  failure  (mainly  due  to  viral  level 
rebound  in  the  PI-naïve  patients  versus  never  reaching  viral  load  suppression  in  the  PI-experienced 
patients)  followed  by  adverse  events  (with  a  higher  rate  in  the  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  once  daily 
dosing regimen in study APV20003). In both studies, the median plasma HIV-1 RNA level decreased 
over time.   
There were differences in antiviral response across the age groups, although the differences were not 
consistent between studies (table 12).

Antiviral response in adolescents at week 48 
In answer to the request for supplementary information, the MAH performed a preliminary Week 48 
efficacy analysis of the 12-18 years old age group in APV29005 based upon laboratory data currently 
available.  Tables  13  and  14  below  present  the  Week  48  antiviral  response  for  adolescents  in 
APV290005.

Compared  to  Week  24,  the  two  additional  PI-naïve  patients  classified  as  failure  in  the  Week  48 
TLOVR analysis comprised one virological rebound and one discontinuation while suppressed due to 
'other'  reasons  captured  as    'poor  medical  compliance'  for  the  IP  discontinuation  data.  The  one 
additional PI-experienced patient classified as failure post Week 24 in the Week 48 TLOVR analysis 
was a virological failure at Week 48 due to plasma HIV-1 RNA rebound.

Study outcomes at Week 48 using the <50 copies/ml TLOVR analysis in the ITT(E) Population for PI-
naïve  and  PI-experienced  adolescents  respectively  were  as  follows:  14/19  (74%)  and  6/10  (60%)  of 
were  responders,  3/19  (16%)  and  3/10  (40%)  experienced  virological  failure.  In  addition,  three  PI-
naïve  adolescents  discontinued  study  drug  before  achieving  suppression  (n=2)  or  while  suppressed 
(n=1), one for adverse events and two for ‘other’ reasons. 
Overall, the data show that the efficacy observed at Week 24 is generally sustained through Week 48, 
and  that  the  majority  of  patients  achieving  viral  suppression  to  <400  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  copies/ml 
also achieved maximal suppression to <50 copies/ml, especially in the group of PI-naïve patients. 
Immunological response  
In the ITT(E) Observed analysis of the median change from baseline in CD4+ cells, increases (114 to 
149 cells/mm3)  were  observed  at  Week  24  and  were  similar  between  the  PI-naïve  and  the  PI-
experienced groups in Studies APV29005 and APV20003 (table 15).

both  baseline  and  Week  24  data  in  studies  APV29005  and  APV20003  (table  16).  Similar 
improvements were seen across the PI-naïve and PI-experienced groups in both studies. Roughly 1/3 
of the patients showed improvement and 2/3 maintained their status. Week 48 results (not shown for

Disease progression 
There  was  no  disease  progression  or HIV-associated  conditions  reported  in Study  APV29005.    HIV 
disease progression during Study APV20003 occurred in one patient in the PI-experienced group, who 
developed a mycobacterial infection. 
Resistance data 
Both genotype and phenotype analyses were performed in studies APV29005 and APV20003. 
APV29005 
In this study, the majority of the ITT-exposed population was included in the Virology population at 
baseline,  comprising  82%  (47/57)  of  patients  and  including  87%  (26/30)  of  the  PI-experienced 
patients.    Nine  of  the  12  patients  classified  as  virological  failures  at  Week  24  (ITT[E]  TLOVR, 
≥400 copies/ml) provided on-therapy analysis.  An additional seven patients were analysed for clinical 
management purposes following the investigator’s request, but four of these were after only 4 weeks 
therapy. 
to 
the  group  of  ART  experienced  patients  without  significant  phenotypic  resistance 
In 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir  baseline  (N=40),  38  were  lacking  amprenavir-associated  mutations  at 
baseline.    In  the  PI-experienced  group  (N=26),  2 patients  had  HIV  virus  with  >4-fold  reduced 
susceptibility to amprenavir at baseline. Both experienced virologic failure. 
Three  of  nine  patients  with  virological  failure  at  Week  24  with  on-therapy  genotypes  showed 
significant PRO mutation selection on-therapy.  Amprenavir resistance associated mutations selected 
were I54M/l (n=2), I50V (n=2), and I84V (n=2) (total number of patients: n=3) and these were always 
associated with phenotypic resistance to fosamprenavir/ritonavir.  There was relatively little change in 
the  genomes  of  the  viruses  from  the  other  six  patients.    Of  the  seven  patients  analysed  at  the 
investigator’s request, only one showed changes from baseline in protease.  
APV20003 
Two virology populations were analysed: the NRTI-experienced population, and the Virology Failure 
Population.  Genotypic analyses were performed in the NRTI experienced subpopulation at screening 
(N=53)  to  help  construct  an  active  background  regimen  of  two  NRTIs,  and  both  genotypic  and 
phenotypic analyses were performed for patients with plasma HIV-1 RNA >400 copies/ml at Week 24 
or 48 or at the investigator’s request (N=30). 
Of  the  seven  patients  with  virological  failure  who  developed  amprenavir  resistance  associated 
mutations, six were in the PI-experienced group; one of these patients had an amprenavir mutation at 
baseline  and  selected  I54L  on  therapy.   Six  of  the patients  also  had  one  or  more  TAMs  at  baseline, 
four of these with M184V; one patient did not have NRTI resistance-associated mutations.  Thus in six 
of these seven cases, it is likely that the NRTI had impact on the success of the regimen. 
16/26
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On treatment analysis has shown that the highest absolute fold-changes in amprenavir resistance were 
observed  when  amprenavir  resistance  mutations  were  selected  into  a  background  of  other  PI 
mutations.    Of  a  total  of  11  patients  with  virus  showing  phenotypic  resistance  to  amprenavir  on-
treatment,  10/11  were  previously  PI-experienced  patients  and  were  infected  with  virus  containing 
multiple  PI-mutations  at  baseline,  and  3/11  patients  harboured  viruses  with  phenotypic  resistance  to 
amprenavir at baseline.  Such isolates showed cross-resistance to other PIs except for LPV where 73% 
(8/11) remained below the clinical cut-off. 
Treatment Adherence in Study APV29005  
The adherence was planned to be explored in this study:  
•  by the pill count and the visual assessment of full, partial or empty bottle 
•  by the Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) adherence questionnaire exploring the 
potential reasons for non-adherence (including taste, refusal, interference with lifestyle etc.) 
Fosamprenavir adherence behaviour assessment was only available for 51% of patients.  The reasons 
for non-adherence were obtained for only 59% of patients at weeks 24. The lower rate of adherence 
was  observed  for  patients  aged  12-18  years  (73%  at  week  24).  The  rate  of  adherence  decreased 
between week 24 and week 48 for all cohorts; comprised between 86 % and 60% at week 48. By week 
24,  the  major  reason  for  non-adherence  was  “taste,  can’t  get  it  down,  spits  up,  amounts  of  pills  or 
liquid” in children less than 13 years and “made me sick to my stomach; threw-up; it tasted badly”. Of 
note, the reporting of these events decreased over the course of the study.

supportive  for  the  use  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  in  paediatric  patients  above  the  age  of 
six, due to the lack of children evaluated for the lower age group. The MAH agreed to this restriction 
as  compared  to  the  initially  proposed  age  group  of  children  above  the  age  of  two  (see  also 
attachment 8  to  this  assessment  report).  In  the  supported  age  group,  however,  both  antiviral  and 
immunological responses were acceptable.

The  studies  were  designed  to  evaluate  primarily  the  PK  and  safety  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  in 
children  of  all  ages,  who  were  antiretroviral  therapy  naïve  or  experienced,  PI-naïve  or  experienced, 
and had variable baseline viral resistance.  Antiviral activity was a secondary endpoint only, which is 
consistent  with  ICH  E11  guidance.  The  observed  variability  in  antiviral  response  by  age  group  was 
most likely due to differences in underlying baseline viral resistance or treatment experience of each 
individual patient rather than due to age per se. In APV29005, the majority of patients with any (one 
or  two)  primary  protease  mutations  were  in  the  6  to  11  age  group.    The  most  prevalent  primary 
protease mutations present in the 6 to 11 year old age group was L90M, associated with broad cross-
class  resistance,  while  the  most  prevalent  in  the  12  to  18  year  old  age  group  was  D30N,  associated 
specifically with resistance to NFV only.  Thus, the 6 to 11 year age group appeared to have the most 
extensive  PI  genotypic  resistance,  and  also  had  the  lowest  antiviral  response  to  fosamprenavir/ 
ritonavir  therapy  in  APV29005.    In  separate  analyses,  the  number  of  active  NRTI  drugs  in  the 
regimens  was  estimated  based  on  both  genotype  and  phenotype  scoring  (GSS  and  PSS).    Of  the  17 
patients  with  fully  active  backbones  (both  GSS  and  PSS  =2),  three  (18%)  experienced  virologic 
failure.    In  contrast,  five  of  12  patients  (42%)  identified  with  GSS  and  PSS  ≤2  experienced  failure.  
Thus,  as  expected,  there  appeared  to  be  an  association  between  the  activity  of  both  the 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir as well as the background therapy with response.   
The  antiviral  responses  observed  in  APV29005  and  APV20003  are  comparable  to  those  with 
lopinavir/ritonavir  in  the  paediatric  population,  as  shown  in  a  cross-study  comparison.  Such  a 
comparison  has  limitations  due  to  differences  in  study  population,  differences  in  baseline 
susceptibility  to  the  PI  and  the  active  background  regimen.  Noting  these  limitations,  virologic  and 
the 
immunologic  responses  observed 
in  APV29005  are  comparable

responses  between  APV29005  and 
It  is  widely  acknowledged  that  PI  liquid  formulations  in  general  have  a  relatively  poor  taste 
(Guidelines  for  the  Use  of  Antiretroviral  Agents  in  Paediatric  HIV  Infection,  October  2006).    The 
guidelines also list poor palatability as a disadvantage of other PI liquid formulations (Guidelines for 
the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Paediatric HIV Infection, October 2006; Sharland M. et al, 2004). 
The  data  from  questionnaires  indicated  that  in  children  less  than  13  years  old,  the  most  commonly 
reported issues that could be associated with non-adherence to fosamprenavir were “Taste, can’t get it 
down, spits up, amount of pills or liquid” (reported by 27% at Week 2) and “Child refuses” (reported 
by 24% at Week 2).  However, the reporting of these issues decreased substantially over the course of 
the study, indicating that children may have become used to the taste of fosamprenavir after repeated 
administration. 
Only  one  patient  was  reported  to  have  discontinued  APV29005  clearly  due  to  palatability  related 
issues. Four other patients receiving fosamprenavir oral solution discontinued the study due to reasons 
that  potentially  could  have  been  related  to  palatability.  The  antiviral  response  obtained  by  patients 
receiving  fosamprenavir  oral  suspension  and/or  tablets  during  studies  APV20003  and  APV29005  is 
indicative  of  a  relatively  good  level  of  adherence.    If  palatability  were  a  major  obstacle,  a  worse 
antiviral response and a higher rate of discontinuations would be expected, particularly in the youngest 
age group where all patients were receiving fosamprenavir oral suspension.

While  the  presented  data  suggest  a  durability  of  the  virologic  response  for  adolescents  (12  to 
the  use  of 
18 years), 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir should be guided by current clinically validated resistance algorithms; TDM 
may be a useful tool to ensure appropriate fosamprenavir exposure in an individual patient. In order to

The  paediatric  studies  APV29005  and  APV20002  are  still  ongoing,  actively  enrolling  additional 
children. Antiviral activity will continue to be monitored in these trials, as well as post-marketing data 
on  the  use  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  in  HIV  infected  children  gathered  (see  also  attached  Letter  of 
Undertaking).  Once  these  data  are  available,  a  further  extension  of  indication  to  include  children 
below the age of six should be submitted for assessment. In addition, these data will be  essential in 
further substantiating the long-term efficacy of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in children.

Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Studies APV29005 and APV20003 include so far 20 patients who were 2-5 years of age, 42 patients 
who were 6-11 years of age and 64 patients who were 12-18 years of age. The majority of patients had 
more than 48 weeks of exposure. The numbers comprise patients treated with both once and twice a 
day regimens, so the numbers of patients treated for each individual dosing regimen is small.  
Study APV20002 is assessing use of fosamprenavir and fosamprenavir/ritonavir in patients less than 
2 years  of  age.  Limited  data  has  been  collected  to  date  in  this  study  population.  Further  study  of 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir in this group of patients is expected. 
Safety  was  assessed  by  both  laboratory  and  clinical  evaluations.  Clinical  adverse  events  (AEs)  and 
laboratory  AEs  were  graded  according  to  the  modified  Division  of  AIDS  (DAIDS)  toxicity  grading 
guidelines. Although 1994 DAIDS guidelines were originally specified in the protocol, laboratory AEs 
were re-graded according to the 2004 revised guidelines, which were published during the time of the 
study.

Adverse events 
Rash  
Rash  is  a  known  side  effect  of  therapy  with  fosamprenavir;  rash  occurred  in  9-17%  of  patients  in 
studies  of  HIV-infected  adults  (APV30002,  APV30003,  ESS100732),  with  drug-related  grade  2-4 
rashes  occurring  in  3%  of  patients  in  each  study.  In  studies  of  adults,  rash  has  been  described  as 
erythematous or maculopapular eruptions (with or without pruritus). Rash occurred in 23/126 (18%) of 
patients in the paediatric clinical trial programme. Most rash events were grade 1-2 in severity and no 
patients  discontinued  treatment  due  to  rash.  The  cumulative  incidence  of  rash  AEs  over  time  shows 
that rash generally occurred early. 
Gastrointestinal events  
In  the  paediatric  clinical  development  programme,  gastrointestinal  events  were  generally  the  most 
frequently reported AEs, occurring in 72/126 (57%) of patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir. The 
most  common  gastrointestinal  events  were  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  and  nausea.  The  majority  of 
gastrointestinal  events  were  grade  1-2  in  severity  (two  Grade  3-4  events  of  nausea  and  stomach 
discomfort were reported in the same patient).

34% (all grades), 6% (grade 2-4) 
22% (all grades), 4% (grade 2-4) 
16% (all grades), 3% (grade 2-4) 
Laboratory Findings 
Hepatobiliary  events  observed  in  these  trials  were  single  cases  of  severe  elevations  in  AST/ALT, 
bilirubin remained with normal ranges. 
Upward  shifts  in  lipid  parameters  were  recorded,  with  a  few  (3  cases)  grade  3  or  higher  toxicity 
grades. 
Glucose did not show clinical significant patterns. 
Neutropenia  
Grade 3/4 neutropenia was documented significantly more frequently in patients in APV20003 (13/66, 
20%) than in APV29005 (2/53; 4%). The reason for the frequency of neutropenia seen in APV20003 
is unclear. Neutropenia has been identified as a potential risk.  
Potential for overdose 
Experience  with  fosamprenavir  or  amprenavir  overdose  is  very  limited;  it  is  not  known  whether 
amprenavir  can  be  removed  by  haemodialysis.  It  is  notable  that  high-dose  fosamprenavir/ritonavir 
(fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/100mg twice daily) is currently being studied in treatment-experienced, 
HIV-infected adults in APV102002; analysis of interim data has not revealed safety concerns with this 
regimen.  The  proposed  product  information  for  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  in  children  is  based  upon 
weight and age based dosing recommendations, in order to minimise the risk of overdose. 
Potential for off-label paediatric use 
Within  the  HIV  indication,  there  is  a  possibility  of  unboosted  fosamprenavir  use  (in  patients  who 
cannot tolerate ritonavir) or once daily dosing (if compliance is an issue). These regimens have been 
studied within the paediatric clinical programme and no specific safety concerns have been identified 
with  unboosted  or  once  daily  dosing  regimens.  At  present  there  are  currently  no  dosage 
recommendations for children aged below the age of 6 years; thus, there is the potential for off-label 
use in this age group.

Discussion on Clinical Safety, the PhV System and the RMP 
Two  clinical  studies  (APV29005  and  APV20003)  provided  safety  data  on  HIV-infected  children 
between the age of 2 to 18 years. However, the number of patients receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir 
twice daily in the age group 2 to 5 years is too small to reach a conclusion on the safety profile in this 
age  group.  For  patients  <  2  years  of  age,  only  very  limited  data  has  been  collected  from  study 
APV20002. Further data in this age group are awaited; this study so far could therefore not be used in 
evaluating the safety profile of fosamprenavir in the very young.  
in 
the  key  study 
Although 
received 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily, APV20003 (once daily regimen) provided additional safety data 
as  it  included  paediatric  patients  from  the  same  age  range  who  achieved  comparable  plasma 
amprenavir  PK  exposures.    Overall  cumulative  exposure  was  151  patient-years,  and  the  majority 
(70%) of patients received fosamprenavir/ritonavir for >48 weeks.   
in  which  patients 
is  APV29005, 
this  program 
With regards to dose level, a substantial proportion of overall exposure to fosamprenavir/ritonavir in 
Study  APV29005  occurred  at  or  above  the  proposed  recommended  doses:  in  total,  52  of  the  57 
patients  (91%)  treated  with  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  in  APV29005  received  doses  at  or 
higher than those proposed in the PPK model. 
The five most frequently reported AEs, regardless of causality (excluding AEs likely associated with a 
concurrent  illness)  included  vomiting,  diarrhoea,  headache,  nausea,  and  rash.  Laboratory  parameters 
which were examined were total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, absolute neutrophil count, 
and  ALT.    Plasma  amprenavir  PK  did  not  generally  correlate  with  observed  AEs  or  the  clinical 
laboratory parameters tested.   
Neutropenia  was  a  potential  new  safety  concern  detected  in  one  of  the  two  paediatric  studies 
(APV20003). The observed rate of neutropenia in APV20003 was considered to have been specific to 
that  study  and  to  have  been  at  least  partially  confounded  by  concomitant  medications  and  spurious 
laboratory  results.  Nevertheless,  neutropenia  is  considered  as  a  potential  risk  that  will  be  monitored 
within the ongoing clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance.  
22/26
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, off-label use of unboosted fosamprenavir (in patients who cannot tolerate ritonavir) is a 
potential risk.. The MAH has proposed to provide an action plan to address possible off-label use (see 
also attached Letter of Undertaking).  
Pharmacological  class  effects  of  PIs  observed  in  adults,  gastrointestinal  events,  lipid  abnormalities, 
AST/ALT elevations and blood glucose elevations should be considered as identified risk also for the 
paediatric population. Rash is also an identified risk in adults population and in paediatric population. 
Overall,  due  to  the  limited  database  on  safety  in  paediatric  patients,  further  experience  with  the 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily regimen is required, particularly for 2 to 5 year old patients.  Study 
APV29005 is ongoing, and has been amended to evaluate the proposed dose (fosamprenavir/ritonavir 
23/3 mg/kg twice daily) in the 2 to 5 year old age group. In addition, up to 8 patients in the age group 
of 6 to 18 years will be added to the study, further substantiating the safety profile (see also attached 
Letter of Undertaking).   
In  addition,  the  MAH  is  currently  assessing  the  feasibility  of  using  observational  cohorts  and  drug 
utilisation  databases  to  provide  information  on  usage  of  fosamprenavir  in  children  within  the  real 
world population (see also attached Letter of Undertaking). To further characterise the safety profile in 
paediatrics  post-marketing,  the  MAH  will  perform  quarterly  safety  reviews  and  revert  back  to  a  6-
monthly PSUR cycle as of the next data lock point.  
The MAH has committed to update the RMP in the light of the above identified issues in parallel to 
the submission of the next PSUR. In this update, the inclusion of the adult population in the EU RMP 
will be done (see attached Letter of Undertaking).

Overall discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
Given the availability of Telzir oral suspension, the extension of indication to include the treatment of 
paediatric  patients  is  of  interest,  especially  in  view  of  the  limited  available  boosted  PI  regimens 
available in this population in contrast to adult patients. 
In  the  target  population  Telzir  is  expected  to  be  a  preferable  option  as  compared  to  the  current  oral 
solution  formulation  of  amprenavir  with  regards  to  the  excipients  content  (lower  propylene  glycol 
concentration) and the higher concentration of active, allowing the administration of lower volumes.  
Pharmacokinetics  
The  dose  recommendation  derived  from  the  PPK  model  for  children  above  the  age  of  six  is  in  line 
with the doses used in study APV29005 for this age group. The fact that for 12 to 18 year olds, the 
predicted  geometric  mean  AUC(0-τ)  and  Cmin  values  were  approximately  20%  lower  than  the 
targeted adult exposure in the PPK model are to some extent balanced by the efficacy data for this age 
group.  Nevertheless,  this  positive  clinical  outcome  needs  to  be  further  substantiated  in  the  ongoing 
studies. Concerns, however, remain with the age group of children below the age of six.  
The fact that in study APV20002 (very young children of 6 to 24 months of age) no sufficient plasma 
levels could be achieved even after administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir doses up to 4.5-fold the 
adult ones raises major concerns.  This may not only be explained by the relatively higher CL in this 
age group, but may also be due to an insufficient absorption of the oral solution, possibly because of a 
short gastrointestinal transit time in small children, or because of frequent vomiting and diarrhoea in 
HIV-infected  children.  The  MAH  should  further  research  the  underlying  cause  of  this  effect  in  the 
ongoing study. In addition, theses findings were reflected in the SPC.

Clinical efficacy

derived

supportive  for  the  use  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  twice  daily  in  paediatric  patients  above  the  age  of 
six,  due  to  the  lack  of  children  evaluated  for  the  lower  age  group.  In  the  supported  age  group, 
however, both antiviral and immunological responses were acceptable.  
study  APV29005,  which  evaluated 
the  efficacy  of 
the 
The observed variability in antiviral response was most likely due to differences in underlying baseline 
viral resistance or treatment experience of each individual patient. The antiviral responses observed in 
APV29005  and  APV20003  are  comparable  to  those  with  lopinavir/ritonavir  in  the  paediatric 
population,  as  shown  in  a  cross-study comparison.  The  similar  antiviral  and immunologic responses 
between  APV29005  and  the  lopinavir/ritonavir  study  were  seen  despite  differences  in  the  patient 
populations and in the study designs.   
The  antiviral  response  obtained  by  patients  receiving  fosamprenavir  oral  suspension  and/or  tablets 
during studies APV20003 and APV29005 is indicative of a relatively good level of adherence, even 
though palatability is a common problem in antiretroviral therapy with oral solutions.   
While  the  presented  data  suggest  a  durability  of  the  virologic  response  for  adolescents  (12  to  18 
years), they remain limited. For PI experienced adolescents, the use of fosamprenavir/ritonavir should 
be guided by current clinically validated resistance algorithms; TDM may be a useful tool to ensure 
appropriate fosamprenavir exposure in an individual patient. Efficacy of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in all 
age groups will further be evaluated in the ongoing clinical trials.  
Clinical safety 
Two  clinical  studies  (APV29005  and  APV20003)  provided  safety  data  on  HIV-infected  children 
between  the  age  of  2  to  18  years.  However,  in  the  age  group  2  to  5  years  the  number  of  patients 
receiving fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily is too small to reach a conclusion on the safety profile in 
this  age  group.  For  patients  <2  years  of  age,  only  very  limited  data  has  been  collected  from  study 
APV20002. Further data in this age group are awaited; this study so far could therefore not be used in 
evaluating the safety profile of fosamprenavir in the very young.  
Neutropenia  was  a  potential  new  safety  concern  detected  in  one  of  the  two  paediatric  studies 
(APV20003).  However,  this  signal  may  have  been  at  least  partially  confounded.  Neutropenia  is 
considered  as  a  potential  risk  that  will  be  monitored  within  the  ongoing  clinical  studies  and  post-
marketing surveillance.  
In  addition,  off-label  use  of  unboosted  fosamprenavir  is  a  potential  identified  risk  (in  patients  who 
cannot tolerate ritonavir).  
Overall,  due  to  the  limited  database  on  safety  in  paediatric  patients,  further  experience  with  the 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir twice daily regimen is required, particularly for 2 to 5 year old patients.  Study 
APV29005 is ongoing, and has been amended to evaluate the proposed dose (fosamprenavir/ritonavir 
23/3 mg/kg twice daily) in the 2 to 5 year old age group. In addition, up to 8 patients in the age group 
of 6 to 18 years will be added to the study, further substantiating the safety profile.   
In  addition,  the  MAH  is  currently  assessing  the  feasibility  of  using  observational  cohorts  and  drug 
utilisation  databases  to  provide  information  on  usage  of  fosamprenavir  in  children  within  the  real 
world population (see also attached letter of undertaking). To further characterise the safety profile in 
paediatrics  post-marketing,  the  MAH  will  perform  quarterly  safety  reviews  and  revert  back  to  a  6-
montly PSUR cycle as of the next data lock point.  
The MAH has committed to update the RMP in the light of the above identified issues in parallel to 
the submission of the next PSUR. In this update, the inclusion of the adult population in the EU RMP 
will be done (see attached Letter of Undertaking).

Benefit/risk assessment 
Overall,  the  pharmacokinetic,  efficacy  and  safety  data  provided  within  this  variation  application  are 
adequate  to  support  the  extension  of  indication  to  include  the  children  and  adolescents  between  the 
ages of 6 to 18 years. This is founded in the validity of the dose recommendation, the durability of the 
virologic and immunologic response and the safety profile for this age group. 
In the light of the above, the CHMP considered the benefit/risk balance for the extension of indication 
of fosamprenavir/ritonavir in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to include children and 
adolescents of the age of six years or above to be positive.

Product information 
Further  to  the  assessment  of  the  initial  (see  attachment  8)  and  additional  proposals  of  the  MAH  to 
amend  the  Product  Information  and  in  the  light  of  the  assessment  of  the  submitted  data,  the  CHMP 
requested the following amendments in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), Annex II and 
Package Leaflet (PL). The MAH was in agreement with this and withdrew the request for an extension 
of indication below the age of six years.  
SPC  
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication” 
The MAH’s initial proposed changes to section 4.1 were discussed and not agreeable by the CHMP. 
Telzir  oral  suspension  should  be  indicated  in  children  and  adolescents  above  the  age  of  six  years, 
mainly  due  to  the  fact  that  for  the  paediatric  population  below  the  age  of  six  pharmacokinetic  and 
efficacy data as well as long-term safety experience is limited. 
Section 4.2 “Posology and method of administration” 
The MAH’s initial proposal was amended to reflect the fact that the extension of indication was only 
agreed  for  children  above  the  age  of  six  years.  In  addition,  a  warning  about  the  lack  of  data  in  the 
younger children was added, together with a cross-reference to section 5.2.  
Section 4.8 “Undesirable Effects” 
The adverse event profile in children and adolescents was updated based on the integrated safety data 
from studies APV29005 and APV20003. The initial proposal by the MAH to add warnings about the 
non-recommendation of the once-daily regimen was deleted as this is duly reflected in section 4.2.  
Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties” 
Results of study APV29005 are presented. The initial proposal by the MAH to reflect all age groups 
was not agreed, and the data was recalculated to represent only the results obtained in the newly added 
paediatric  population.  As  APV20003  employed  the  once  daily  regimen,  the  initially  proposed  full 
description of its results was reduced.  
Section 5.2 “Pharmacokinetic properties” 
Pharmacokinetic results of study APV29005 are reflected for the relevant age group. In addition, upon 
request  by  the  CHMP,  the  findings  of  study  APV20002  are  shortly  given,  i.e.  that  even  with  dose 
increases  up  to  4.75  fold  no  satisfactory  plasma  exposure  in  this  age  group  was  achieved.  This 
information  was  thought  to  be  pertinent  in  order  to  further  discourage  the  off-label  use  of 
fosamprenavir/ritonavir in this age group.

Section 5.3 “Preclinical safety data” 
As the nature of hyaline droplets in the kidneys of juvenile rats had been clarified to be α2µ globulin 
within a post-authorisation commitment, the relevance of the renal findings in juvenile animals during 
the assessment of the initial MA was addressed as such: “Toxicity was not aggravated when juvenile 
animals  were  treated  as  compared  with  adult  animals,  but  the  data  did  indicate  a  steeper  dose 
response.” 
PL 
The PL was updated in accordance to the changes proposed to the SPC. The CHMP agreed with the 
MAH proposed wording.  
Annex II 
Annex II was updated to include the conditions or restrictions with regards to the safe and effective 
use of fosamprenavir.  
The MAH agreed with the above amendments and submitted a revised Product Information.

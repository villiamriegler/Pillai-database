Scientific conclusions and grounds for variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
Based  on  cases  of  urticaria  from  clinical  trials  and  spontaneous  reporting  related  to  the  treatment  with 
naltrexone/bupropion, the SmPC should be updated to reflect that urticaria is not only an adverse reaction 
of bupropion but also of the naltrexone/bupropion combination. Based on integrated clinical trial data, the 
frequency of urticaria is uncommon for the treatment with naltrexone/bupropion.   
The Package Leaflet (PL) does not have to be changed because it already includes urticaria listed as hives 
with frequency common in section 4. In general, only the highest frequency category for an adverse reaction 
is included in the PL as adverse reactions are not grouped by the suspected active substance.

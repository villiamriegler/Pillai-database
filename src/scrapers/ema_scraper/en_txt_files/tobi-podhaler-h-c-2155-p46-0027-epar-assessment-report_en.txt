1.  Introduction 
On 2 November 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for tobramycin inhalation 
powder, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
The MAH states that the efficacy and safety data from study CTBM100CFR01 do not warrant an update 
of the product information of TOBI Podhaler.

The  MAH  stated  that  CTBM100CFR01,  Observational  study  on  the  compliance  and  quality  of  life  of 
patients with cystic fibrosis treated with Tobi Podhaler® for a pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The dose was 112 mg tobramycin (4x 28mg capsules), administered twice daily for 28 days followed 
by 28 days off treatment.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
study  CTBM100CFR01:  Observational  study  on  the  compliance  and  quality  of  life  of  patients 
with cystic fibrosis treated with Tobi Podhaler® for a pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study  CTBM100CFR01:  Observational  study  on  the  compliance  and  quality 
of  life  of  patients  with  cystic  fibrosis  treated  with  Tobi  Podhaler®  for  a 
pulmonary infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
Description 
Study CTBM100CFR01 is a post-marketing, non-interventional, prospective, multicenter study, 
performed in a real-life setting with specialized physicians, to evaluate the compliance with Tobi 
Podhaler, as measured with the Morisky score (see below), reported during the last treatment cycle 
preceding the visit performed at 12th month. Out of the 126 patients that were enrolled in the study, 
40 patients were paediatric patients.

Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary Objective: 
To  evaluate  the  compliance  to  Tobi  Podhaler,  as  measured  with  Morisky  score,  reported  during  the 
treatment  cycle  before  the  visit  performed  at  12  months  (a  compliant  patient  corresponding  to  a 
Morisky score ≥ 3). 
Assessor’s comment 
The  Morisky  score  is  a  structured  four-item  self-reported  adherence  measure.  The  following  4 
questions are included:  
1. Do you ever forget to take your medicine?  
2. Are you careless at times about taking your medicine?  
3. When you feel better do you sometimes stop taking your medicine?  
4. Sometimes if you feel worse when you take the medicine, do you stop taking it? 
The  Morisky  score  can  be  considered  a  generally  accepted  self-reported  adherence  measure.  The 
questions asked in the current study are in line with the original 4 questions described by Morisky as 
listed above. As such, the primary objective is acceptable.  
Secondary Objectives

• 
• 
• 
• 
•

• 
To describe the changes in compliance (Morisky score) throughout the 12-month follow-up 
period, and the factors responsible for non-compliance. 
To describe the compliance to Tobi Podhaler in terms of: number of missing days of treatment 
per week, number of inhaled capsules per dose, reasons of missing days of treatment, timing 
of inhalations, relative compliance in comparison with the previous treatment. 
To describe the change in quality of life of patients treated with Tobi Podhaler, using the Cystic 
Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) at 6 months and 12 months after initiation of Tobi 
Podhaler. 
To describe the characteristics of the patients: demographics, characteristics of cystic fibrosis 
and pulmonary P.aeruginosa infection, and the previous antipseudomonal antibiotic 
treatments. 
To describe the conditions of use of Tobi Podhaler: treatment duration, number of cycles. 
To describe the method of use of Tobi Podhaler as evaluated by the physician: search of critical 
errors of use, number of partially empty capsules and duration of the inhalation of 4 capsules. 
To describe patient’s opinion about the ease of use of Tobi Podhaler, the interest in the dose 
visual control, and patients’ preference in comparison with previous inhaled treatments. 
To describe the change in clinical parameters of cystic fibrosis from baseline to 6 month and 12 
months after the initiation of the TOBI Podhaler: body weight, forced expiratory volume in one 
second (FEV1), microbiology (sputum/deep-throat swab). 
To describe the safety and tolerability of Tobi Podhaler:

-  All adverse events (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs or SAEs 
considered to be study-drug related according to the investigator, except those related 
to CF symptoms or progression, 
-  Reasons for treatment discontinuation. 
Study design 
This was a prospective, non-interventional, multicenter study in France, performed in a reallife setting 
with specialized physicians (pulmonologists, paediatricians, gastroenterologists) from cystic fibrosis 
centers. 
The study included three visits occurring at standard scheduled clinic appointments: one baseline visit 
(Visit 1) and two follow-up visits at 6 months and 12 months. 
Information was collected from electronic Case Report Forms (e-CRFs) filled out by the physicians and 
electronic self-assessment questionnaires (e-diary) filled out by the patients or their legal 
representatives. 
Study population 
Patients eligible for inclusion in this study had to fulfil all of the following criteria: 
•  Outpatients aged ≥6 years, male or female, 
•  Suffering from cystic fibrosis, 
•  With a P.aeruginosa pulmonary infection documented with positive bacteriological culture of 
sputum or deep cough throat swab within the six weeks preceding inclusion, 
• 
• 
Previously treated with nebulized antipseudomonal antibiotic within the preceding six months, 
Treated with Tobi Podhaler®, initiated at Visit 1 at the latest or within the 2 months preceding 
Visit 1 (1 cycle of 28 days maximum preceding Visit 1), following recommended posology and 
method of administration (i.e. 4 capsules of 28 mg, taken twice a day, within alternate cycles 
of 28 days of treatment followed by 28 days without treatment). The treatment with another 
inhaled antibiotic was allowed during the 28 days period without treatment with Tobi 
Podhaler®, 
• 
Follow-up consultation planned at least each six months.  
Patients awaiting for pulmonary transplantation were excluded from the study. 
Sample size 
There was no existing data of compliance based on Morisky score determined by using the Morisky 
Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS) in CF patients’ population. In a recent study, the rate of 
compliance to inhaled tobramycin at 12 months assessed with the medication possession ratios (MPR) 
was about 60% (Eakin MN et al. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2011)). Therefore the expected value of the 
primary endpoint was 60%. 
The required absolute precision for the primary endpoint was ± 7.5%, corresponding to a length of the 
95% confidence interval of 15%. 
Based on these assumptions, 164 patients had to be assessed. It was assumed that about 20% of 
included patients did not respect inclusion criteria of the study or had no value for the primary 
endpoint. Therefore a total of 210 patients were to be included.

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/533035/2016 
Page 5/21 
 
 
 
 
 
Each participating specialist was asked to include the first 3 consecutive patients corresponding to 
inclusion criteria of the study. Therefore 70 active specialists were needed. 
Assessor’s comment 
The assumptions leading to the proposed sample size of 210 patients are considered reasonable.  
Treatments 
Patients received four TIP capsules (112 mg of tobramycin, 28 mg / capsule) twice a day, within 
alternate cycles of 28 days of treatment followed by 28 days without treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary criterion: 
12-month compliance to inhaled anti-P.aeruginosa antibiotherapy assessed using the self-reported 
scale measuring medication-taking behaviour described by Morisky which includes 4 items. The 
Morisky score was calculated by adding 1 when “no” was answered to any item. The sum of the 4 
items gave the Morisky score. A patient was considered compliant to the study treatment when his/her 
Morisky score was ≥3. 
Assessor’s comment 
a Morisky score ≥3 to be considered compliant to the study treatment is acceptable. 
Secondary criteria: 
•  Other compliance assessments: number of missing doses per week, number of inhaled 
capsules per dose, reasons of missing doses, timing of inhalations, relative compliance in 
comparison with the previous treatment at 6 and 12 months. 
•  Quality of life with Tobi Podhaler®: CFQ-R at 6 and 12 months. 
•  Characteristics of the CF patients, treated with Tobi Podhaler® for a pulmonary infection due 
to P.aeruginosa in a real-life setting: demographics, disease characteristics, previous 
antipseudomonal antibiotics. 
•  Conditions and method of use of Tobi Podhaler®:, treatment duration, number of cycles, 
search of critical errors of use, duration of the inhalation of the 4 capsules. 
• 
Ease of use of Podhaler® inhaler, interest of the dose visual control, patients’ preference in 
comparison with previous inhaled treatments. 
•  Course of CF: body weight, FEV1, microbiology (sputum/deep-throat cough swab). 
•  Safety and tolerability of Tobi Podhaler®: adverse events suspected to be drug-related, 
reasons for treatment discontinuations. 
Statistical Methods 
The reference population for the analysis consisted of all patients included, respecting major selection 
criteria of the study and still being treated at 12 months. Premature discontinuations of treatment 
before 12 months were described according to the reason for discontinuation.

Descriptive statistics were used to describe patient characteristics and study results (mean, standard-
deviations (SD), median, and extreme values for quantitative parameters; absolute frequency and 
percentages of each modality for qualitative parameters, 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated 
when relevant). 
Multivariate analyses were also performed in order to determine factors that could influence the 
compliance at 12 months. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 126 patients entered the study (Included set, IS), among them 119 received at least one 
dose of Tobi Podhaler (Safety set, SS). The Analysis set (AS) consisted of 117 patients who did not 
present any major deviation in the inclusion criteria. For the primary criterion analysis only the patients 
having done at least 4 cycles of Tobi Podhaler treatment or, when the number of cycles was unknown, 
having done at least 7 months under Tobi Podhaler treatment were considered. A total of 28 patients 
discontinued mainly due to drug intolerance. 
Patients who did all the visits were 101 (80.2%) in IS, 101 (84.9%) in SS, 99 (84.6%) in mITT and 90 
(92.8%) in mITT for the primary criterion. Among patients who did all visits, data were collected from 
both e-CRF and e-diary in 44 (43.6%) of the patients in IS, 44 (43.6%) of the patients in SS, 44 
(44.4%) of the patients in mITT and 41 (45.6%) of the patients in mITT for the primary criterion. 
Assessor’s comment: 
According to the sample size calculation, a total of 210 patients were to be included to be able to 
assess 164 patients (assuming that about 20% of included patients did not respect inclusion criteria of 
the study or had no value for the primary endpoint). However, only 126 patients out of the 
planned 210 patients (60%) entered the study, but no argumentation was provided in the 
submitted documentation. The MAH is requested to discuss this discrepancy.   
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics in the mITT population are presented in Table 10-3. 
CHMP’s assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/533035/2016

At baseline, mean age was 22 ± 9 years, (77 patients (69%) ≥ 18 years, 19 patients (16%) ≥13 and 
<18 years, and 21 patients (18%) ≥ 6 and < 13 years. Patients were female in a slight majority 
(51.3%). 
Characteristics of CF and P.aeruginosa infection at baseline in the mITT population are described in 
Table 10-4. 
Patients were diagnosed with CF on average 18.5 years ago. The baseline mean FEV1% predicted was 
67.2%, and mean weight was 49.7 kg. The mean sputum density of P. aeruginosa (sum of all 
biotypes) at baseline was 3.5 log10 CFU/mL, and mean tobramycin MIC was 4.5 μg/mL. 
During the year preceding the initiation of Tobi Podhaler, 83 patients (71%) were treated with inhaled 
tobramycin solution (Tobi), 83 patients (71%) with colistin solution (Colimycine®) and 4 patients 
(3.4%) with aztreonam lysine solution (Cayston®). The co-treatment Tobi + Colimycin® was received 
by 42.6% patients; Colimycin® in monotherapy was received by 27.8% patients and Tobi in 
monotherapy by 26.1%.

At baseline, half of the patients (50.0%) were compliant (Morisky score ≥3) overall to their previous 
inhaled treatment. The mean ±SD Morisky score was 2.5 ±1.2. In the 6 - 12 years old age group, 
56.3% of patients were compliant (mean Morisky score 3.0 ±1.0). In the 13-17 years old age group, 
54.5% of patients were compliant (mean Morisky score 2.6 ±1.2). In the adult patients, 47.2% of 
patients were compliant (mean Morisky score 2.3 ±1.2). 
Efficacy results 
Primary Endpoint: 
Overall at 12-month follow-up, 59.6% of patients (95% CI [45.3%; 72.4%]) were compliant with 
mean Morisky score of 2.7 ± 1.0. 
Compliance seemed to be better in children and teenagers: the 12-month Morisky score was 3.1 ± 0.7 
in 6-12 yrs., 3.0 ± 0.8 in 13-17 yrs. and 2.5 ± 1.1 in adults, with respectively 80.0%, 75.0% and 
48.3% of compliant patients. 
An analysis of factors which might be associated with non-compliance was performed according to 
logistic regression: no factors were statistically associated. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Data of 18 paediatric patients (N=10 and N=8 for 6-12 years and 13-17 years, respectively) was 
included in this analysis and showed relatively good compliance (75%-80% was compliant). Half of the 
adult patients were none compliant (Morisky score <3), which was comparable as reported at baseline 
for their previous therapy. Due to the small sample size however, especially in paediatric patients, no 
firm conclusions should be drawn.  
The compliance in the patients ≥ 18 years of age is lower than the primary endpoint: 48.3% in stead of 
60%. Although the numbers are small (n=29), the company should comment whether this compliance 
in this age group is in line with what can be expected in this age group or whether it is a coincidence; if 
this is in line what can be expected, the company is requested to comment whether this is considered 
acceptable.

Secondary Endpoints: 
Description of compliance 
At 6-month follow-up, 59.3% of patients were compliant with Tobi Podhaler (95% CI [46.0%; 71.3%]) 
and the mean (±SD) Morisky score was 2.7 ± 0.9. At 12-month follow-up on overall, more patients 
were compliant with Tobi Podhaler® than with their previous inhaled antipseudomonal treatments: 25 
patients (59.5%) versus 22 (52.4%). At 6-month follow-up, more patients were compliant with Tobi 
Podhaler® than with their previous inhaled antipseudomonal treatments: 29 patients (56.9%) versus 
26 (51.0%). 
Change in compliance with inhaled antipseudomonal treatments from baseline (compliance with 
previous treatment) to 12-month (compliance with Tobi Podhaler®) was described in Table 10-12. 
An analysis of factors which may be associated with non-compliance was performed according to an 
univariate logistic regression. No factors were statistically associated. 
Assessor’s comment 
Again, less than half of the subjects contributed data for this analysis, for reasons not at all discussed 
by the MAH. Keeping the low subject numbers in mind though, it seems that compliance with Tobi 
Podhaler was equal to (or potentially slightly better than) compliance to previous therapy, especially in 
paediatric subjects.

Missing doses 
Overall, 85 questionnaires (65.9%) reported forgotten previous treatment intakes at baseline, 49 
questionnaires (59.0%) reported forgotten Tobi Podhaler® intakes at 6-month follow-up and 39 
(60.0%) at 12-month follow-up (Table 10-13). 
Patients who have ever forgotten their treatment missed mostly one day or less of treatment per 
week: 44 questionnaires (34.9%) reported one day or less of missing treatment per week for previous 
treatments, 34 (42.5%) for Tobi Podhaler® at 6-month follow-up or 31 (47.7%) at 12-month follow-
up. 
Patients were questioned about their reasons of Tobi Podhaler® missing doses at 6 or 12-month 
follow-up. At 6-month follow-up on overall, 30 patients (55.6%) declared having ever forgotten to take 
Tobi Podhaler®. The principal reason was forgetfulness (10 patients, 33.3%). At 12-month follow-up 
on overall, 27 patients (57.4%) declared having ever forgotten to take Tobi Podhaler®. The principal 
reason was forgetfulness too (11 patients, 40.7%). Only one adult patient declared at 6 and 12-month 
follow-up that he/she did not take Tobi Podhaler® because the treatment was not suitable for him/her. 
At 12-month follow-up on overall, patients were compliant in taking the 4 capsules at each dose. At 
the question “How many capsules have you taken on average for each treatment?”, all patients (46, 
100%) answered “4”. At the question “Have you ever taken less than 4 inhaled capsules per dose”, 
they answered “No” at 95.7% (45 patients): all patients (10, 100%) aged between 6 and 12 years old, 
7 patients (87.5%) aged between 13 and 17 years old and 28 adult patients (96.6%). Similar answers 
were reported at 6-month follow-up. 
At 12-month follow-up on overall, a majority of patients (35, 74.5%) took Tobi Podhaler® between 7 
a.m. and 9 a.m. on the morning. A majority of adult patients (18 , 62.1%) took the medication after 8 
a.m. A majority of patients (26, 55.3%) took Tobi Podhaler® between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. the evening. 
Comparable answers were reported at 6-month follow-up. 
All patients considered that Tobi Podhaler was very easy to use or easy to use. They were a large 
majority (88.4%) who preferred Tobi Podhaler to their previous treatments.

Quality of life of the patients during their treatment with Tobi Podhaler® 
At the end of the study, in patients aged 14 and older, CFQ-R scores from all domains tended to 
increase except for the digestion score who tended to decrease; similar results were observed in 
younger patients (children aged 13 and less) where mean scores from most of CFQ-R domains tended 
to increase while scores from symptom domains (respiratory, digestion) tended to slightly decrease. 
No clinically meaningful changes were observed. 
Course of cystic fibrosis in patients treated with Tobi Podhaler®  
Weight, FEV1 and tobramycin MIC were evaluated at 6 or 12-month follow-up to assess the evolution 
of CF during the study. Results are presented in Table 10-19. 
At 12-month follow-up, the weight of children and teenagers tended to increase: mean change (±SD) 
in weight was 2.8 (1.8) kg in children or 4.2 (3.6) kg in teenagers. Weight of adult patients was stable. 
At 12-month follow-up on overall, FEV1 (% predicted) tended to improve: FEV1 was improved in 46 
patients (47.4%), stabilized in 21 (21.6%), and worsened in 30 (30.9%). FEV1 improvement was 
substantial in patients aged between 6 and 12 years old in whom 15 patients (78.9%) improved it. The 
FEV1 was improved in the majority of patients aged between 13 and 17 years old (10 patients, 
62.5%). In adult, it was worsened in 23 (37.1%), remained stable in 18 (29.0%) and improved in 21 
(33.9%). 
Too few results were collected with tobramycin MIC to conclude.

Assessor’s comment 
Especially in paediatric patients, FEV1 tended to increase from baseline to the 12-month analysis 
timepoint (change of 11% and 7.2% in 6-12 years and 13-17 years, respectively). In adults, FEV1 was 
worsened, stable, and improved in approximately 1/3rd of subjects each. No conclusions regarding 
tobramycin MIC can be drawn.  
Treatment duration 
The mean number of cycles of treatment with Tobi Podhaler® was 5.2 (±1.1) at 12-month follow-up.  
Assessment of Tobi Podhaler® way of use by the investigators 
Investigators evaluated the way their patients used Tobi Podhaler® during the study. Results are 
presented in Table 10-22 at 12-month follow-up. 
On overall, at 12-month follow-up, investigators evaluated that their patients used correctly Tobi 
Podhaler®: 84 patients (89.4%) did not blow into the device before inhaling, 85 (90.4%) breathed 
correctly or put correctly the capsules, 83 patients (88.3%) used correctly the pushbutton and 84 
(89.4%) emptied completely the capsules. There was no difference between age groups

The mean duration of inhalation was 3.8 ± (2.1) minutes at 6-month follow-up and 3.8 ± (2.1) 
minutes at 12-month follow-up increasing with age. 
Safety results 
Adverse Events 
Overall 70 AEs were reported in 42 patients (35.3%) and 42 AEs were possibly related to Tobi 
Podhaler® according to the investigators’ opinion in 33 patients (27.7%). Adult patients and patients 
between 13 and 17 years old reported more AEs or related AEs than patients between 6 and 12 years 
old.  
All AEs reported by SOCs and PTs were described in Table 10-26. Adverse events were mainly 
classified in the SOC “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders”: 39 events in 30 patients

(25.2%) including the frequent AEs (≥1.0% of patients) cough (19 events in 18 patients, 15.1%), 
haemoptysis (6 events in 4 patients, 3.4%), dysphonia (3 events in 3 patients, 2.5%), dyspnea (3 
events in 3 patients, 2.5%), bronchospasm (2 events in 2 patients, 1.7%), increased bronchial 
secretion (2 events in 2 patients, 1.7%) or throat irritation (2 events in 2 patients, 1.7%). 
Other frequent AEs (≥1.0% of patients) were infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (4 
events in 3 patients, 2.5%), Pseudomonas infection (2 events in 2 patients, 1.7%), or tinnitus (2 
events in 2 patients, 1.7%).

Assessor’s comment 
The reported AEs are in line with the known safety profile of Tobi Podhaler and the patient population 
under study. No new safety signals are identified. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Seven SAEs were reported in 6 patients (5.0%). The most frequent SAEs were classified in the SOC 
“Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders”: 4 events in 4 adult patients (5.1%) including 3 
events of haemoptysis in 3 patients (3.8%) and 1 event of pneumothorax in 1 patient (1.3%). The 
other SAEs reported each in 1 adult patients (1.3%) were “infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic 
fibrosis” and “lung transplant”. One SAE (distal intestinal obstruction syndrome) was reported in 1 
patient (5.3%) between 13 and 17 years old. No SAE was reported in patients between 6 and 12 years 
old.

AEs possibly related to Tobi Podhaler® according to the investigators’ opinion 
Overall, 42 AEs in 33 patients (27.7%) were assessed as possibly related by the investigators including 
33 AEs from the SOC “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” in 28 patients (23.5%). The 
most frequent AE possibly related was cough (18 events in 17 patients, 14.3%). 
One SAE possibly related to Tobi Podhaler® according to the investigators’ opinion was described in 1 
adult patient: haemoptysis of moderate severity which led to the temporarily discontinuation of Tobi 
Podhaler®.

Reasons for treatment discontinuation 
From the 28 patients (23.5%) who discontinued the treatment, 12 (10.1%) did it for drug intolerance 
and 5 (4.2%) according to patient’s decision. Among the other reasons for discontinuation, undetected 
P.aeruginosa was reported in 4 patients (3.4%). One adult patient discontinued the treatment at 6 
month follow-up for lack of efficacy. 
Assessor’s comment 
The safety profile reported in the current study is in line with the known safety profile of Tobi Podhaler 
and the patient population under study. No new safety signals are identified. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The aim of this observational, prospective, post-marketing and multicenter study performed in France 
was to evaluate in a real-life setting the compliance with Tobi Podhaler® in cystic fibrosis patients after 
12 month of treatment. Unfortunately, only 60% of the planned sample size was actually included in 
the study, no reason for the discrepancy between planned and actual enrolment was reported. 
Furthermore, only approximately half of the subjects included in the study actually contributed data for 
the main analyses. Due to the low subject numbers, especially in the 6-12 years (N=21) and 13-17 
years (N=19) age group, no firm conclusions can be drawn.  
The compliance in the patients ≥ 18 years of age is lower than the primary endpoint: 48.3% in stead of 
60%.  
The MAH showed that based upon the limited available data this is in line with what can be expected in 
the adult population. 
Keeping the low enrolment in mind, the data as presented seem to indicate that compliance with Tobi 
Podhaler® in cystic fibrosis patients seems at least comparable to compliance to previous therapy, 
which is reassuring. No new safety signals were identified.  
It is agreed with the MAH that the efficacy and safety data from study CTBM100CFR01 do not warrant 
an update of the product information of TOBI Podhaler. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
  Not fulfilled: 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
The compliance in the patients ≥ 18 years of age is lower than the primary endpoint: 48.3% in stead of 
60%. Although the numbers are small (n=29), the company should comment whether this compliance 
in this age group is in line with what can be expected or whether it is a coincidence; if this is in line 
what can be expected, the company is requested to comment whether this is considered acceptable. 
The timetable is a  a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
RSI 
The compliance in the patients ≥18 years of age is lower than the primary endpoint: 48.3% instead of 
60%. Although the numbers are small (n=29), the company should comment whether this compliance 
in this age group is in line with what can be expected or whether it is a coincidence; if this is in line 
what can be expected, the company is requested to comment whether this is considered acceptable. 
Summary response of the MAH: 
In study CTBM100CFR01 (hereafter referred to as FR01), baseline compliance with previous inhaled 
anti-pseudomonal treatments for TOBI®, Colimycin® or Cayston® was assessed. In adults ≥18 years, 
the compliance at baseline was lower than that in children and adolescents. Of 53 adult patients with 
compliance scores at baseline as assessed by the Morisky questionnaire, 25 (47.2%) were compliant. 
In children 6-12 years and adolescents 13-17 years, compliance with previous inhaled anti-
pseudomonal treatments was recorded in 56.3% (9/16) and 54.5% (6/11), respectively. Compliance 
with TOBI® Podhaler™ at the 12-month follow up visit was as follows: 48.3% (14/29) in adults, 
80.0% (8/10) in children 6-12 years, and 75.0% (6/8) in adolescents 13-17 years. Although the 
patient numbers were relatively smaller in all age groups at the 12 month follow-up, it appears that 
compliance increased in the children and adolescent age groups but remain unchanged in the adults. 
A search for real-world evidence on compliance and adherence specifically with TOBI Podhaler revealed 
limited information.  
Studies have demonstrated that balancing the demands of CF with those of work, family and other 
relationships becomes more difficult in adolescence and adult life, with compliance tending to decrease 
with increasing age (Gudas et al, 1991). 
A study evaluated compliance to medications amongst CF patients as assessed by a selfadministered 
questionnaire. Patients were classified as compliant or non-compliant by medical staff involved in their 
care. A total of 34 CF patients were enrolled; 11 were between 10 and 20 years, and 9 were older than 
20 years. The average time of the evolution of the disease was 12.2 years. Overall, the results of the 
questionnaire showed a global compliance of 59%. Non-compliant patients were significantly older, had 
longer time of evolution of their disease and more severe disease. Approximately 24% of patients < 
than 15 years were non-compliant and approximately 69.2% of adolescent (> 15 years) and adults 
were noncompliant. (Arias-Llorente et al, 2008). 
Conclusions: The data on real-world adherence with TOBI Podhaler is limited. Based on studies 
evaluating compliance, it has been shown that compliance decreases in adolescence and this continues 
into adulthood. The results from study FR01 in the adult population seem to be consistent with this 
trend. 
Assessor’s comment: Based upon the limited available data it seems that a lower compliance in the 
adults age group can be expected. The MAH did not answer the question whether the lower compliance 
in adults is considered acceptable. This is endorsed because the available data are too limited to draw 
firm conclusions with regard to compliance. 
Point resolved.

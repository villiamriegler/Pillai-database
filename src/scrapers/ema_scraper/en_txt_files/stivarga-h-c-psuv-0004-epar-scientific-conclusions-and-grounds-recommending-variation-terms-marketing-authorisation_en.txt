Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Stivarga, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
Following a request from the PRAC, the MAH submitted a cumulative review of cases of Drug-induced 
Hypersensitivity Syndrome / Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DIHS/DRESS) with 
the present PSUR. 15 cases were identified and assessed by the MAH as suggestive for systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) with organ involvement, i.e. to be further evaluated as suspected 
DIHS/DRESS cases. The MAH stated that from the cases evaluated, none would qualify as DIHS/DRESS 
according to either of the diagnostic criteria systems. However, some of the cases suggest systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions with organ involvement such as increased liver function tests. Therefore, the 
MAH proposed to include the term ‘hypersensitivity reaction’ as a new adverse drug reaction in the SmPC, 
in order to alert physicians of potential clinically relevant regorafenib-associated hypersensitivity reactions 
not covered by adverse drug reactions already listed in the SmPC.  
Therefore, in view of available data, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were 
warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Stivarga, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance regorafenib is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

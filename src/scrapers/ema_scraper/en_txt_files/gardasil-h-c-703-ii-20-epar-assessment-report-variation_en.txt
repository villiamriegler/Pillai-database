SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
Introduction 
1.1. 
Gardasil is a quadrivalent (HPV Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) recombinant HPV (qHPV) vaccine licensed 
on 24 September 2006. 
Gardasil is indicated in the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), 
cervical  cancer  and  external  genital  warts  (condyloma  acuminata)  causally  related  to  Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18. 
The current indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of qHPV vaccine in adult females 16 
to 26 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of qHPV vaccine in 9- to 15-year old 
children and adolescents.  
The present type II variation application aimed to extend the therapeutic indication to women up to 45 
years old, based on submission of data on efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of the qHPV vaccine 
in female subjects 24 to 45 years of age from an on-going phase III study (Protocol 019). The MAH 
proposed amendments of the age range in section 4.1 of the SPC is as follows: 
Gardasil /Silgard is a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and 
vaginal),  cervical  cancer  and  external  genital  warts  (condyloma  acuminata)  causally  related  to 
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (see section 5.1). 
The indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Gardasil/Silgard in adult females 16 to 26 
45 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Gardasil/Silgard in 9- to 15-year old 
children and adolescents. Protective efficacy has not been evaluated in males (see section 5.1). 
The use of Gardasil/Silgard should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
This variation also aimed to update all relevant sections of the SPC (sections 4.5, 4.6. 4.8 and 5.1) and 
PL (sections 1, 3 and 4) to reflect the study results obtained in mid-adult women. 
Following CHMP major objections to extend the age range of woman up to age of 45, which could not 
be overcome by the MAH, the MAH agreed not to pursue with the extension of indication and limited 
this application to the update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1. 
1.2 
Clinical efficacy 
The HPV attack rate is high in sexually active adults and women remain at risk for acquisition of new 
infections  throughout  their  sexual  lives.  The  incidence  of  HPV  disease  peaks  within  10  years  after 
sexual debut. However, social changes (e.g. later marriage, increasing divorce rate) have increased the 
risk in women in their late 20s, 30s and 40s. The literature review provided by the MAH showed that 
HPV incidence rates in MAW varied by country, in general decreased with increasing age, but were 
still  noticeable  at  older  ages.  The  published  data  suggest  that  at  least  60%  of  MAW  will  remain 
susceptible  to  vaccine  HPV  type  infection  and  can  potentially  benefit  from  the  qHPV  vaccine. 
Therefore, the MAH has conducted this efficacy study in mid-adult women (MAW). 
The main goal of the study was to provide data to support that efficacy was comparable to that shown 
in young adult women (YAW) and thereby allowing the inclusion of a statement in the indication that 
efficacy against premalignant genital lesions, cervical cancer and genital warts has been demonstrated 
in women up to the age of 45 years. The study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy in MAW with 
respect to the composite co-primary endpoints of HPV 6/11/16/18- and HPV 16/18-related persistent 
infection  and  clinical  disease  (CIN,  AIS  and  EGLs).  The  scientific  basis  for  these  endpoints 
constituted the natural history of HPV and the results of the clinical program in YAW. The original 
licensure  of  the  qHPV  vaccine  was  based  on  histologically-confirmed  efficacy  endpoints,  i.e.  HPV 
16/18-related CIN 2/3 and AIS, as surrogates for cervical cancer. Subsequent to the demonstration of 
robust  efficacy  in  this  endpoint  in  YAW,  a  virological  endpoint  was  applied  in  the  study  of  MAW.

Persistent  HPV  infection  is  recognized  as  a  necessary  pre-requisite  for  the  development  of  cervical 
cancer.  Comparable  efficacy  against  HPV  16/18-related  persistent  infection  and  CIN  2/3  was 
demonstrated in the YAW studies.  
1.2.1  Protocol 019 
1.2.1.1  Methods 
The  claim  of  efficacy  in  mid-adult  women  (MAW)  is  based  on  one  randomized  controlled  efficacy 
trial Protocol 019 (summarized in table 1) including 3819 healthy sexually active 24- to 45-year old 
women. Randomization was stratified by age in approximately 1:1 ratio into 2 groups, those 24 to 34 
years  and  those  35  to  45  years.  Within  each  age  stratum  subjects  were  randomized  in  1:1  ratio  to 
qHPV vaccine or placebo.

Study participants 
The study subjects were healthy 24 to 45-year-old women. The studies did not include pre-screening 
visit  for  HPV.  Thus,  both  naïve  individuals  and  individuals  who  had  been  exposed  to  HPV  prior  to 
enrolment were included. All subjects had at inclusion: 
  Serum anti-HPV testing 
  Pap test 
  Cervicovaginal sampling for HPV typing 
  Colposcopy if Pap test showed some abnormalities 
To enrich the population with HPV naïve subjects, intact cervix (i.e. those without hysterectomy) was 
used  as  screening  criterion.  Subjects  who  had  surgical  treatment  (such  as  conisation,  LEEP,  laser 
cervical cryotherapy) or subjects who had a cervical biopsy taken within 5 years were not eligible for 
further evaluation. 
Populations 
The following populations were considered for the HPV-specific efficacy analysis: 
Per-protocol efficacy:  
  Received all 3 doses of study vaccine  
  Were seronegative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) at Day 1  
  Were PCR negative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Day 1 to Month 7  
  Did not have general protocol violations  
  Cases counted starting 30 days postdose 3 (Month 7).  
The Per-Protocol Efficacy (PPE) population was used as the primary efficacy population. 
HPV-Naïve to the Relevant-HPV-Type (HNRT) population* 
  Received at least 1 vaccination 
  Were seronegative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Day 1 
  Were PCR negative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Day 1 
4/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Cases counted starting after Day 1 
(*This  population  was  similar  to  the  Modified  Intention  to  Treat-2  (MITT-2)  population  for  YAW  (used  in  P005,  P007, 
P013, P015) but for MITT-2, cases counted starting after Day 30) 
The HNRT population was used as a supportive population. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS)*   
  Received at least 1dose of study vaccine  
  Regardless of PCR status at Day 1 
  Had at least one follow-up visit after Day 1 
  Cases counted starting after Day 1 
(*This  FAS  population  is  similar  to  the  MITT-3  population  in  studies  in  YAW.  However,  in  the  MITT-3 
population, cases were counted started after Day 30) 
The FAS population represents the general (female) population (ITT) in this age group. 
For the analyses that were not HPV-vaccine-type specific (population benefit analyses) the following 
populations were defined: 
Generally HPV-naïve (GHN) population* 
  Received at least 1 vaccination 
  Were seronegative and PCR negative to all 4 vaccine HPV types at Day 1;  
  Were PCR negative to non-vaccine HPV type for which testing were available (HPV 31, 33, 
35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59) at Day 1,  
  Had a negative-for-SIL Pap test result at Day 1;  
  Had at least one follow-up visit following Day 1.   
  Cases were counted starting after Day 1. 
(*For studies conducted in YAW, the generally HPV-naïve (GHN) population was referred to as the RMITT-2 
population. In the RMITT-2 population, cases were counted starting after Day 30 instead of after Day 1) 
The GHN population represents the primary analysis population 
HPV-naïve to the relevant type (HNRT)  
  Received at least 1 vaccination 
  Were sero- and PCR-negative at Day 1 to the appropriate vaccine HPV type (HPV 6, 11, 16, 
18);  were  PCR-negative  at  Day  1  to  the  appropriate  non-vaccine  HPV  type  for  which  PCR 
assays were available (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, or 59), or had a negative Day 1 Pap 
test result;  
  Cases were counted starting after Day 1. 
The HNRT population is a supportive population. 
Full Analysis Set (FAS)   
General population (ITT) as defined above. 
Treatments 
Subjects  were  randomised  1:1  to  receive  either  quadrivalent  HPV  VPL  vaccine  (20/40/40/20mcg  + 
225mcg  amorphous  aluminium  hydroxyphosphate  sulphate  (AAHS)  adjuvant)  or  placebo  (225mcg 
Aluminium adjuvant in normal saline) at Day 1, Month 2 and Month 6.  
Objectives 
The  primary  efficacy  study  objectives  were  to  demonstrate  that  administration  of  the  HPV  vaccine 
would reduce the combined incidence of: 
  HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection, genital warts, VIN, VaIN, vulvar cancer, vaginal 
cancer, CIN, AIS, and cervical cancer, compared with placebo in 24- to 45-year-old women 
who are naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline.  
5/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  HPV16/18-related  persistent  infection,  genital  warts,  VIN,  VaIN,  vulvar  cancer,  vaginal 
cancer, CIN, AIS, and cervical cancer, compared with placebo in 24- to 45-year-old women 
who are naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline. 
The secondary efficacy study objectives were to demonstrate that administration of the HPV vaccine 
would reduce the combined incidence of: 
  HPV6/11-related persistent infection, genital warts, VIN, VaIN, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, 
CIN, AIS, and cervical cancer, compared with placebo in 24- to 45-year-old women who are 
naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline.  
  HPV  31/33/35/52/58-related  persistent  infection,  genital  warts,  VIN,  VaIN,  vulvar  cancer, 
vaginal cancer, CIN, AIS, and cervical cancer, compared with placebo in 24- to 45-year-old 
women who are naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
First co-primary endpoint:  
  The  combined  incidence  of  HPV  6,  11,  16,  and  18-related  persistent  infection  CIN  (any 
grade), AIS, or EGLs. 
The definition of the persistent infection endpoint for the first primary endpoint encompassed: 
  Persistent  vaccine-type  infection  without  confirmed  CIN  –  defined  as  detection  of  HPV  
positivity for the same HPV type by the HPV 6/11/16/18 PCR assay in 2 or more consecutive 
cervicovaginal specimens obtained at least 6 months apart (within ± 4-week windows). 
  Vaccine-type  HPV  infection  with  confirmed  CIN  –  defined  as  a  consensus  Pathology  Panel 
diagnosis of CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3, AIS or cervical cancer plus detection of the corresponding 
HPV vaccine type in specimens obtained from the same lesion, plus detection of HPV vaccine 
type  on  the  routine  visit  immediately  prior  to  colposcopy  visit  in which  the  biopsy  showing 
CIN, AIS or cervical cancer was obtained. 
Second co-primary endpoint: 
  The  combined  incidence  of  persistent  HPV  16  and  HPV  18  infection  and  HPV  16-  and  18-
related CIN (any grade), AIS or EGLs. 
Secondary efficacy endpoint 
  The number of subjects in the PPE population who developed a HPV 6- and HPV 11-related 
persistent  infection,  external  genital  warts,  VIN,  VaIN,  vulvar  cancer,  vaginal  cancer,  CIN 
(any grade), AIS, and cervical cancer. 
  The number of subjects in the PPE population who developed a HPV 31/33/35/52/58-related 
persistent  infection,  external  genital  warts,  VIN,  VaIN,  vulvar  cancer,  vaginal  cancer,  CIN 
(any grade), AIS, and cervical cancer.  
Statistical methods 
Study  019  employed  a  fixed  event  design.  Hypothesis  testing  was  planned  on  3  endpoints, 
HPV6/11/16/18-  (co-primary),  HPV  16/18-  (co-primary)  and  HPV  6/11-  (secondary)  -related 
persistent infection and disease. The testing of the endpoints was to be performed in a priority order, 
where testing of the successive endpoints would only proceed if success was achieved in the previous 
6/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
endpoint.  The  testing  was  to  take  place  when  at  least  25  subjects  had  developed  a  case  of 
HPV6/11/16/18-related endpoint and at least 14 subjects had developed a case of HPV 16/18-related 
endpoint in the PPE population. For the secondary HPV 6/11-related endpoint, 19 subjects were the 
target number. The study was powered for the two co-primary endpoints, but not to detect statistically 
significant  efficacy  with  respect  to  the  individual  components  of  the  composites.  The  stipulated 
number of primary and secondary endpoints was reached as of 13 Jul-2007, after 2.2 years of follow-
up post-enrollment. The statistical methods are considered acceptable. 
1.2.1.2   
Results 
A  total  of  3819  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  study.  Protocol  019  is  ongoing  and  therefore,  a  large 
number of subjects are continuing in the efficacy follow-up period. The mean duration of follow-up 
post-enrollment  was  2.2  years.  Final  analyses  are  planned  for  End-of-Study  (through  4.0  years  of 
follow-up post-enrollment). 
Thirty-eight  study  centers  located  in  7  countries  in  France,  Germany,  Spain,  Columbia,  Philippines, 
Thailand  and  the  US  conducted  the  study.  The  3  countries  with  the  highest  number  of  recruitment 
were Colombia (43% of study population), Thailand (20%) and the US (14%). Europe enrolled 12.6% 
of the study population. 
Overall,  96.8%  of  all  subjects  completed  the  vaccination  phase.  The  proportions  of  subjects  who 
completed  the  vaccination  phase  were  comparable  between  the  vaccine  and  the  placebo  group. 
Altogether, 2.5% of the subjects discontinued participation in the study during the vaccination period 
and 1.0% discontinued participation in the study in the follow-up period. 
Baseline data 
The  2  vaccination  groups were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  baseline  demographics.  The  mean  age 
was  34.3  years.  The  majority  of  subjects  were  Hispanic  American  (43%).  Europe  contributed  only 
12.6% of study subjects. 
Sexual  demographics  were  comparable  between  vaccination  groups.  Overall  99.9%  of  subjects  had 
experienced sexual debut. The median first intercourse was 18 years (range: 4 to 39) and the median 
number of lifetime sex partners was 2 in both groups and in both age strata. 
In  both  vaccination  groups  approximately  30%  of  subjects  were  positive  to  a  HPV  vaccine  type  by 
serology  and  approximately  8%  were  positive  by  PCR.  Altogether  67%  of  the  population  was 
seronegative  and  PCR  negative  to  all  vaccine  HPV  types  6,  11,  16  and  18.  The  vaccination  groups 
were comparable with respect to the overall proportions of subjects with detectable vaccine HPV type 
DNA at baseline. By age, the proportion of subjects who were PCR positive was lower in the 35 to 45 
year-old stratum than in the 24 to 34 year-olds (5.6% vs. 10.2%) whereas with respect to serology the 
proportions were similar (28.8% vs. 30.7%). 
Pap test results showed that SIL was present in 7.5% of subjects. The proportions of subjects reporting 
a  SIL-related  diagnosis  were  comparable  between  the  2  vaccination  groups.  When  analysed  by  age 
stratum,  higher  occurrence  of  an  abnormal  Pap  test  was  reported  in  the  24  to  34  year  age  group 
compared with the 35 to 45 year old women (6.8% vs. 2.6% in the respective vaccine group  and 5.9% 
vs. 4.0% in the placebo groups). 
Efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection, CIN and EGL 
The results presented in the tables were analysed using 6-month persistent infection. 
PPE-population 
Results  with  respect  to  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  in  the  primary  efficacy 
population  (PPE)  are  displayed  in  Table  2.  The  results  were  statistically  significant  in  all  three 
analyses (p<0.001) and were comparable within each of the two protocol-defined age strata.  
Efficacy against HPV 18- and HPV 11-related endpoints could not be confirmed, due to the fact that 
too few and no cases, respectively, were observed.

Of the 45 HPV 6/11/16/18-related endpoint cases, 4 cases occurred in the vaccine group. There were 3 
cases  of  HPV  16  persistent  infection  (6-month  definition)  and  1  case  of  HPV  16-related  CIN  2 
(positive for HPV types 16 and 51 at a month 18 biopsy).  
All  of  the  4  cases  occurred  early  in  the  follow-up,  5  and  11  months  after  completion  of  the  3-dose 
series. All of these cases had satisfactory anti-HPV 16 responses at Month 7 including  two of them 
having evidence of an anamnestic response with very high antibody levels at Month 7. 
Vaccine  efficacy  against  HPV  6/11/1/18-related  related  persistent  infection,  CIN  and  EGL  was  also 
calculated  excluding  the  endpoint  HPV  6  and  11-  related  persistent  infection  in  PPE  population. 
Vaccine efficacy was 86.0% (95% CI: 60.0, 96.4). 
The MAH further calculated this primary combined endpoint using 12-month persistent infection. For 
HPV  16/18-related  persistent  infection,  CIN  and  EGL  vaccine  efficacy  was  84.5%  (95%  CI:  47.4, 
97.1) using 12-month persistent infection.

HNRT population 
Results for this population are presented in table 3. Vaccine efficacy was 74.6% (95% CI 58.1, 85.3). 
Twenty  (20)  cases  were  observed  in  the  vaccinated  arm  (16  new  cases  compared  with  the  PPE 
population). Ten (10) of these new cases were HPV 16/18-related. 
VE was lower in the older age stratum versus the younger stratum (VE: 62.3% vs. 79.8%).

Vaccine efficacy against the HPV 6/11/16/18-related endpoint was much lower in the FAS population 
(VE:  30.9%)  (Table  4).  As  regards  the  HPV  16/18-related  endpoint  only  a  numerical  reduction  was 
seen (lower bound of the 95% CI <0%).

Vaccine  efficacy  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  related  persistent  infection,  CIN  and  EGL  was 
calculated excluding the endpoint HPV 6 and 11- related persistent infection in FAS population. No 
statistical significant efficacy was demonstrated [23.7% (95% CI: -0.1, 42.0)]. 
Efficacy against HPV vaccine type related persistent infection 
The results presented in the tables were analysed using 6-month persistent infection. 
PPE population 
The  analysis  of  efficacy  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  persistent  infection  gave  similar  results  as 
that  of  the  composite  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  endpoint,  since  persistent  infection  comprised  the 
majority of the composite persistent infection and disease endpoint (Table 5).  
Efficacy estimates against the HPV 16/18-related persistent infection were similar in both age strata. 
All the persistent infection endpoints in the vaccine group, and majority of those in the placebo group, 
were HPV 16-related. With regard to HPV 6/11-related persistent infection there were no cases in the 
vaccine group (VE: 100%).

HNRT population 
The efficacy estimates were lower in the HNRT population compared to the PPE population (see table 
6). The findings with respect to persistent infection were similar to the results of analyses of efficacy 
against the composite HPV 6/11/16/18-related endpoint. 
A  single  case  of  persistent  HPV  18  infection  was  observed  in  the  vaccine  group,  which  started 
between Day 1 and Month 7.

FAS population 
Overall vaccine efficacy estimates were substantially lower in this population compared with the PPE 
population,  as  could  be  explained  by  the  inclusion  of  subjects  with  infections  that  were  present  at 
vaccination onset (Table 7). Only trends were observed for the majority of endpoints. With respect to 
HPV  6/11-related  infections  less  impact  was  seen  than  that  of  HPV  16/18-related  endpoint,  due  the 
lower baseline prevalence of HPV 6/11 and the shorter duration of this infection.

PPE population 
The results of the PPE analysis of efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN showed VE of 90.1%, 
with 1 case in the vaccine group versus 10 cases in the placebo group (Table 8). Efficacy against HPV 
16/18-related CIN 2/3 or AIS was not statistically significant with one case in the vaccine group and 4 
cases in the placebo group (VE: 75.2% (95% CI: -150.6, 99.5)). The one case in the vaccine group was 
a case of HPV 16-related CIN 2 (positive for HPV types 16 and 51 at Month 18 biopsy).

HNRT population 
In the HNRT analysis, VE was 81.4% (table 9). 
The number of CIN 2/3 cases in the vaccine group was almost the same as that in the placebo group (3 
vs. 4 cases), but by severity it was worse with the only case of CIN 3 in the vaccine group. VE against 
HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 or AIS was only 25.4% (95% CI: -340.8, 89.1). Two of the CIN 2/3 cases 
in the vaccine group were detected early in the follow-up, at Month 8 and Month 9, despite that the 
subjects were HPV-naïve at baseline.

FAS population  
As presented in table 10, no efficacy against HPV vaccine type-related CIN could be confirmed in the 
FAS population (VE: 39% (95% CI: -2.2, 64.6)). A similar number of new cases were added to the 
vaccine and placebo group (22 vs. 25 cases), in addition to those detected in the HNRT population.

With respect to the CIN 2/3 or AIS endpoint not even an efficacy trend was observed (VE: 9.9%). The 
number of CIN 2 and CIN 3 cases was exactly the same in the vaccine group as in the placebo group. 
The  MAH  provided  the  details  on  these  cases  and  clarified  that  in  each  of  the  vaccine  and  placebo 
groups, the 10 cases of CIN 2 and the 14 cases of CIN 3 do not represent 24 unique subjects because 
some subjects were cases of both CIN 2 and CIN 3. These cases correspond to 40 cases (vaccine = 19, 
placebo = 21). The breakdown of the 40 cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN 2/3 revealed that the 
majority of cases (n=33) were due to prevalent disease, which would not be expected to be prevented 
by the vaccine. The remaining 7 cases were incident infections (vaccine=3 and placebo =4). Of the 3 
vaccine cases, one was confounded by co-infection with an oncogenic non-vaccine HPV type (HPV 
51) and one had a very early HPV 16 infection (CIN 1 at Month 1) suggesting a baseline infection. 
The third case with a baseline infection with HPV 56 had a very rapid progression to HPV 16-related 
CIN 3 diagnosed at Month 8. 
Efficacy against vaccine HPV type-related EGL 
PPE-population:  In  the  PPE-population,  too  few  cases  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  EGL  were 
observed to detect a statistically significant efficacy (VE: 100%; 95% CI: -49.2 to 100%). All 4 cases 
were HPV 6-related condyloma and all were observed in the placebo group. 
HNRT-population: The breakdown of cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL in the HNRT population 
showed 8 cases in the placebo group and all were HPV 6-related condylomas. One (1) case of HPV 
16-related  VaIN  1  was  observed  in  the  qHPV  vaccine  group  at  7  months  Postdose  3  (or  13  months 
after Day 1). The subject was PCR-positive to HPV 56 at Day 1 and to HPV 16 at Month 7.  
FAS population: The following cases were observed among subjects in the group that received qHPV 
vaccine in the FAS efficacy analysis in addition to the 1 case of HPV 16-related VaIN 1 already noted 
among subjects eligible for the HNRT analysis of efficacy:

  6 cases of HPV 6-related condyloma (5 of 6 were Day 1 HPV 6 PCR-positive; 1 of 6 was Day 
1 HPV 18 seropositive with unknown Day 1 HPV 6 status); 
  1 case of HPV 6-related VIN 1 (Day 1 HPV 6 and 16 PCR-positive) 
  1 case of HPV 18-related VaIN 2 (Day 1 HPV 18 PCR-positive). 
Efficacy against vaccine-HPV-type related CIN (any grade) or EGL 
The  efficacy  against  disease  endpoints  (CIN+EGL)  is  shown  in  the  Table  11.  Efficacy  against  the 
different  components  of  the  vaccine  was  similar  and  in  the  same  direction  as  the  efficacy  observed 
against  the  combined  endpoint.  However,  the  number  of  endpoints  was  too  limited  in  many  of  the 
analyses to detect statistically significant efficacy.  
The number of new cases added to the vaccine group in the FAS-analysis compared with the HNRT-
analysis  was  higher  in  the  vaccine  group  (n=30)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (n=26),  which  could 
suggest a negative impact of the vaccine on baseline HPV infections (see 3.2.1.3 Discussion).

Therapeutic efficacy  
Clearance of prevalent infection related to vaccine HPV types  
The  impact  of  a  3-dose  vaccination  regimen  on  the  clearance  of  vaccine  HPV  type  DNA  among 
subjects  who  were  PCR-positive  at  Day  1  to  the  relevant  HPV  type  was  analysed.  The  number  of 
events, and the total person-years of follow-up in each vaccination group were small and therefore, do 
not  allow  any  firm  conclusions  to  be  drawn.  However,  it  is  of  note  that  among  subjects  who  were 
PCR-positive and seronegative to HPV 16, the clearance of HPV 16 DNA was higher in the placebo 
group  compared  to  the  vaccine  group  (table  12).  The  opposite  pattern  was  observed  in  PCR-/sero-
positive group (see below).

The MAH performed re-analyses that led to a change in percent incidence reduction from 47.3% (95% 
CI: 0.4, 73.0) i.e. to 46% (95% CI: -2.7, 72.4) a statistically non-significant result. The result of the 
original analysis was inaccurate due to  a mistake in case counts. 
An additional analysis (life table analysis of time-to-clearance of HPV 6 and  HPV16 infection) was 
performed,  comparing  the  vaccine  and  placebo  groups  of  MAW  who  were  Day  1  PCR-positive 
(regardless of sero-status at Day 1) with respect to the instantaneous probability of clearing infection 
related  to  HPV  6  and  16.  Results  showed  no  relevant  difference  between  the  vaccine  and  placebo 
groups. Inconsistent results were observed in the PCR positive group depending on its serostatus. 
In  addition,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  data  on  the  timing  of  detection  of  CIN  2/3  in  the 
vaccine and placebo group in the FAS population to clarify whether the qHPV vaccine has a negative 
impact accelerating disease progression (see figures 1 and 2 below).

Upon CHMP request the MAH has provided further analysis in non vaccine types to respond to the 
issue  of  negative  impact  of  the  vaccine  with  respect  to  acceleration  of  disease  progression  and  type 
replacement. 
As  regards,  the  observed  higher  proportion  of  non-vaccine  HPV-type  related  CIN2/3  or  worse 
endpoints  in  the  vaccine  group  compared  to  placebo  (figure  2),  the  provided  new  data  revealed 
imbalances in baseline HPV DNA positivity related to HPV types 33, 39, 51 and 58. The increased 
incidence of CIN 2/3 related to these 4 HPV types in the vaccine group (Table 13) was correlated with 
the increased incidence of baseline HPV DNA positive in that group compared to placebo.  
For each of HPV types 45, 56 and 59 the number of excess cases of CIN 2/3 or worse in the qHPV 
vaccine  group  compared  to  placebo  was  only  2  (table  13).  The  case  histories  revealed  that  in  the 
majority of CIN 2/3 or worse diagnoses, co-infections with other high-risk HPV types at baseline of 
unknown duration confounded the causality assessment.

HPV types 
In the analyses of non-vaccine HPV types, the incidence of CIN 2/3 cases was higher in the vaccine 
group compared to the incidence in the placebo group. The data were supplemented with analyses of 
the  cumulative  incidence  of  HPV  31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59-related  CIN  2/3  or  worse  and  CIN 
2/3 related to non-typeable non-vaccine HPV types in the FAS population and also by age groups. The 
incidence  of cases  were  markedly  higher  in  the  vaccine  group  (34  cases  vs.  19  cases  in  the  placebo 
group).  The  cumulative  incidence  of  HPV  31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59-related  CIN  2/3  was  also 
higher in the vaccine group vs. the placebo group. 
The  breakdown  of  the  53  cases  of  HPV  31/33/35/39/45/51/52/56/58/59-related  CIN  2/3  or  worse 
(vaccine n=34; placebo n=19) revealed that the majority of cases (vaccine n=25; placebo n=17)) were 
due to prevalent disease. According to the MAH all these cases were diagnosed with a baseline HPV 
infection that was of the same type as that detected in the CIN 2/3 lesion. The remaining 11 cases were 
incident infections (vaccine n=9; placebo n=2). Of the 9 vaccine cases, 5 were confounded by baseline 
co-infection with other oncogenic HPV type(s) and the other two had a very early diagnosis of CIN 
2/3  suggesting  a  baseline  infection.  The  two  remaining  cases,  judged  as  incident  infections,  were 
diagnosed with HPV 58-related CIN 2/3 at Month 13 and HPV 56-related CIN 2 at Month 19. In the 
19/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo group one case was confounded by an infection with HPV 39 at Day 1 and the other case was 
diagnosed with CIN 2 related to HPV 16 and 51 at Month 30. These few cases of incident infection 
preclude any conclusions to be drawn.  
The side-by-side comparison of plots of cumulative incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN 2/3 in 
the  ITT  population  of  MAW  versus  YAW  was  presented.  At  Month  12  the  separation  in  the 
cumulative  incidence  distributions  between  the  vaccine  and  placebo  group  were  greater  in  MAW 
compared to YAW, In contrast, the Month 24 results in MAW showed that there was no difference in 
the cumulative incidence plots between the vaccine and placebo group (figure 3). This could likely be 
explained  by  the  smaller  number  of  subjects  resulting  in  low  incidence  of  new  infections  in  the 
placebo  group  and  short-term  follow-up  time.  Some  500  MAW  subjects  per  group  are  still  to 
contribute to the Month 24 estimate. The end-of study results at Month 48 of P019 will be critically 
important to reveal whether the separation between the vaccine and placebo groups will be of the same 
magnitude as that observed in the younger women.

Recurrence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection 
Analysis  of  efficacy  against  the  recurrence  of  persistent  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  infection  among 
subjects who were seropositive and PCR-negative to the relevant HPV type at baseline did not reveal 
any statistically significant results. 
Of note in the vaccine group, there were 3/233 cases of persistent HPV 16 infection among women 
who  were  seropositive  and  PCR  negative  to  HPV  16  at  Day  1  compared  with  6/250  cases  in  the 
placebo group leading to an efficacy of 45.1% (CI 95%:-156.9, 91.1).

Discussion 
Efficacy endpoints 
The study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy in MAW with respect to the composite co-primary 
endpoints of HPV 6/11/16/18- and HPV 16/18-related persistent infection and clinical disease (CIN, 
AIS and EGLs). 
Success was achieved in the primary and secondary efficacy study objectives. 
The statistical methods are considered acceptable.

Persistent infection 
The MAH provided data to support that persistent HPV infection of 6 months duration (+1 month) was 
as predictive of HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 as persistent infection of longer duration based on the data 
in young adult women. The proposed definition of persistent infection can be accepted with respect to 
HPV 16/18 and cervical endpoints. Upon CHMP request the MAH provided data on the proportion of 
women with a CIN or EGL who had prior persistent infection in comparison with women without a 
lesion. Overall the number of disease endpoints in study 019 was too limited to ensure reliability of the 
data. The predictive values achieved in the HNRT analyses did not vary significantly by age group or 
by testing interval of persistent infection. However, the lower PPV value obtained in the analysis of 
persistent infection of 12 months duration is not consistent with the results presented in the paper by 
Koshiol et al (2008). This is a systematic meta-analysis of 41 studies including 22000 women. Results 
indicate  that  persistent  infection  of  12  months  duration  appears  to  be  the  most  valid  endpoint  to  be 
used  in  clinical  trials  as  a  surrogate  marker  for  cervical  cancer.  Also  the  data  from  a  recent  study 
(Rodriguez et al. JNCI, 2008) indicate that 12 month persistent infection is a more reliable predictor of 
CIN 2/3+. Although the large Koshiol meta-analysis has some limitations, data on the natural course 
of HPV disease suggest that the 12-month persistent infection is a more reliable and robust predictor 
of progression to CIN 2/3+ than the 6-month persistent infection. Therefore, the CHMP considers that 
in  future  study  reports,  data  on  12  month  persistent  infection  should  also  be  included.  The  MAH 
provided  results  of  the  analyses  of  study 019 using a  12  month  persistent  infection.  Results  showed 
that  efficacy  estimates  against  HPV  16/18-related  persistent  infection  and  against  the  combined 
primary endpoint were in the same order of magnitude, although with wider confidence intervals, as 
the results of the analyses using the 6-month persistent infection.  
The CHMP questioned, the correlation between HPV 16/18-related persistent infection and VIN 2/3 
and  VaIN  2/3.  In  response,  data  on  duration  of  HPV  infection  were  provided  for  the  cases  of  HPV 
16/18-related  VIN/VaIN  2/3.  The  data  submitted  by  the  MAH  showed  that  all  cases  of  VIN  2/3, 
except one, were preceded by persistent HPV 16/18 infection, whereas none of the cases of VaIN 2/3. 
Furthermore, there was only one case of HPV 18-related high-grade vulvar disease. The analyses and 
calculations were therefore based on HPV 16-related persistent infection and VIN 2/3. Overall it must 
be stated that the number of disease endpoints was too limited (n=7) to ensure reliability of the data. 
Furthermore, the MAH provided statistical analysis of the value of HPV 16-related persistent infection 
for predicting HPV 16-related VIN 2/3 or VaIN 2/3 (for P012, on MITT-2 and MITT-3 populations). 
It can be agreed that the data give some evidence to support the association between HPV 16-related 
persistent  infection  and  HPV  16-related  high-grade  vulvar  disease.  Since  persistent  infection  with 
high-risk HPV has been established as a requirement for progression of cervical disease to pre-/cancer 
it is likely that the same applies for vulvar as well as vaginal disease and also for HPV 18. Biological 
plausibility  and  the  provided  data  support  the  use  of  HPV  16/18-related  persistent  infection  as  a 
surrogate marker for high-grade vulvar and vaginal disease (VIN 2/3 and VaIN 2/3) and as a clinical 
efficacy endpoint in P019.  
The  CHMP  questioned  the  clinical  relevance  of  persistent  HPV  6/11  infection,  used  as  a  secondary 
efficacy endpoint in P019, The MAH was requested to justify this endpoint and present data to support 
its correlation with clinical disease. The data provided from the qHPV vaccine studies in YAW (P012) 
showed  that  the  majority  of  genital  warts  occurred  without  preceding  persistent  HPV  6/11  infection 
questioning the clinical relevance of the persistent infection endpoint for HPV6/11 in study 019. Since 
there  are  no  valid  data  to  support  the  use  of  persistent  infection  related  to  HPV  6/11  as  an  efficacy 
endpoint, the results obtained in study 019 were re-analysed excluding all data on HPV 6/11-related 
persistent infection. For the primary combined endpoint vaccine efficacy decreased from 90.5% (73.7, 
97.5) to 86.0% (60.0, 96.4) in the PPE population and from 30.9% (11.1, 46.5) to 23.7 (-0.1, 42.0) in 
the FAS population when this endpoint was excluded.   
The inclusion of vaginal and vulvar cancers in the composite endpoints as proposed by the MAH is 
not accepted by the CHMP, since the surrogacy of VIN 2/3 and VaIN 2/3 for these cancers has not 
been proven. All text on these cancers in the SPC were removed since it could falsely be perceived as 
vaccine efficacy has been demonstrated against vulvar cancer and vaginal cancer.

Study populations 
The primary efficacy population (PPE) was defined similarly to that in all previous studies in YAW, 
as  the  per-protocol  population  who  received  all  3  vaccinations  and  was  naïve  to  the  relevant  HPV 
type(s) at Day 1 prior to vaccination through 1 month postdose 3 (Month 7). Efficacy was measured 
starting after the Month 7 visit. Two further populations were defined that resembled the MITT-2 and 
MITT-3  populations  used  in  the  YAW  studies;  the  HNRT  population  included  baseline  HPV-naïve 
women,  but  case-counting  started  immediately  after  the  Day  1  visit.  The  third  population  (FAS) 
included all women enrolled in the trial regardless of Day 1 HPV status, i.e. also those already infected 
or with clinical disease at baseline, and with case-counting starting after the Day 1 visit.  
In the first assessment the CHMP identified two  major objections. The first objection concerned the 
indication of the qHPV vaccine, which covers all women regardless of HPV status and therefore the 
ITT  (FAS)  population  was  considered  the  most  representative  population  for  MAW.  The  primary 
efficacy population, the HPV naïve (PPE) population does not reflect the general population of MAW 
that will be vaccinated in clinical practice. The poor efficacy results observed in the FAS population 
did  not  support  the  MAH´s  proposal  to  include  a  statement  in  the  indication  that  efficacy  had  been 
demonstrated in 27-45 year old women. 
In  the  response  the  MAH  reiterated  the  approach  to  bridge  the  MAW  results  to  the  prophylactic 
efficacy results against clinical disease obtained in the YAW. Study 019 was powered to demonstrate 
significant  prophylactic  efficacy  (i.e  in  the  HPV  naive  population)  and  in  the  composite  efficacy 
endpoints (persistent infection and disease), The CHMP agreed that for demonstration of prophylactic 
efficacy,  the  PPE  population  is  the  optimal  population.  The  results  in  study  019  showed  significant 
vaccine  efficacy  in  HPV  naïve  mid-adult  women  and  in  similar  magnitude  as  that  shown  in  young 
adult  women.  However,  this  target  HPV  naïve  population  is  difficult  to  identify  among  sexually 
experienced  MAW  and  many  non-naïve  women  will  be  vaccinated  deriving  little  if  any  benefit. 
Therefore, the MAH was asked to evaluate the usefulness of possible pre-screening approaches. 
The MAH´s response addressed the possible tools that could be used to select a susceptible population 
and  their  limitations.  The  MAH  discussed  the  use  of  baseline  characteristics  as  well  as  laboratory 
testing,  such  as  cytological  testing  (Pap  smear).  serological  testing,  HPV  DNA  testing  (Hybride 
capture 2 test (HC2) and genotyping as a pre-screening tool to target HPV naïve women. According to 
the MAH its usefulness for pre-screening of HPV DNA status is very limited. The MAH evaluation of 
HPV  status  gave  meagre  positive  incremental  yield  with  respect  to  identifying  women  who  would 
benefit from vaccination with the qHPV vaccine.  
The  CHMP  accepted  the  MAH’s  response.  In  the  future,  with  the  increasing  use  of  HPV  testing  in 
cervical screening programmes and availability of validated tests, the public health authorities might 
reconsider the use of various pre-screening strategies of HPV vaccination. 
Since pre-screening is not feasible the CHMP considered critical to update the SPC and PL to make it 
very  clear  to  the  prescribers  and  patients  that  vaccine  efficacy  cannot  be  expected  in  non-naïve 
women. In the indication, the statement that efficacy has been demonstrated in women 16-26 years of 
age  is  retained.  In  section  4.4  it  is  stated  that  the  vaccine  is  for  prophylactic  use  only  and  that  the 
vaccine is not effective against already established HPV infection/disease prior to vaccination, and that 
no vaccine efficacy has been shown in the ITT population of study 019. Moreover, it is mentioned that 
continued attendance to cervical screening program is critical.  
Overall,  the  HPV  sero-/DNA-  prevalence  data  observed  in  P019  are  consistent  with  literature 
estimates.  However,  in  the  integrated  summary  report  of  natural  history  in  P019,  it  was  shown  that 
HPV sero-/DNA- prevalence varied greatly by countries/continents, which has to be considered in the 
evaluation  of  efficacy  results.  Overall  the  region-by-region  analyses  did  not  allow  any  firm 
conclusions to be drawn. However, the incidence of the composite HPV endpoints in the vaccine and 
placebo  group  in  the  PPE  populations  did  not  differ  substantially  by  region  suggesting  that 
prophylactic efficacy was similar in all locations. In the FAS populations differences were noted, with 
the lowest efficacy and the highest incidence of HPV infections seen in Europe, whereas the reverse 
was observed for the Asia Pacific region. Moreover, with respect to disease endpoints (CIN), it was 
noted that more cases were seen in the vaccine group than in the placebo group in the EU population, 
which was not the case in Latin America or Asia-Pacific. Although the EU population was limited in 
22/43 
 
 
 
 
size, these data raised some concern. These findings suggest that a lower magnitude of efficacy and a 
reduced benefit of the vaccine would be obtained in the EU ´real world´ female population than in the 
populations of the other regions. The end-of study results of P019 at Month 48 are awaited to show 
whether vaccine efficacy increases with time, as observed in YAW.  
Based on the above section 4.4 of the SPC was revised to inform prescribers that the use of Gardasil in 
adult  women  should  take  into  consideration  the  variability  of  HPV  type  prevalence  in  different 
geographical areas and in the general population of 24- to 45-year-old women, and that no significant 
efficacy  against  HPV  16/18-related  persistent  infection  and  clinical  disease  has  been  demonstrated. 
The decision to vaccinate an individual woman 24-45 years old should take into account her risk for 
previous HPV exposure and her potential benefit from vaccination. Furthermore, the SPC was revised 
to make it clear that vaccine efficacy cannot be expected in women already infected with vaccine HPV 
types  at  baseline  and  results  in  the  ITT  population,  in  particular  with  respect  to  HPV  16/18-related 
persistent infection, were included in section 5.1. 
PPE population 
In  this  population  VE  was  90.5%  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  persistent  infection  (PI)/disease, 
83.1%  against  HPV  16/18-related  PI/disease  and  100%  against  HPV  6/11-related  PI/disease.  With 
respect  to  the  HPV  16/18  endpoint,  lower  efficacy  was  observed  in  the  35-  to  45-year-olds  (VE: 
80.6%) than in the younger age stratum (VE: 85%). There were 4 HPV 16-related endpoint cases in 
the vaccine group (3 PI and 1 CIN 2) vs. 41 in the placebo group. The 4 cases occurred relatively early 
in the follow-up, despite that all subjects developed a satisfactory anti-HPV 16 responses. The MAH 
was requested to address the grounds for “vaccine failure”. The issue of the 4 “vaccine failure” cases 
were  addressed  as  follows.  One  case  with  CIN  2  had  a  baseline  infection  with  a  non-vaccine  type 
(HPV  56)  and  a  co-infection  with  another  HPV  type  (HPV  51  +  HPV  16)  at  the  time  of  diagnosis 
Month 18. Therefore the causal role of HPV 16 in the CIN 2 lesion could be questioned.  According to 
the  MAH  the  two  early  cases  of  HPV  16  persistent  infection  might  be  due  to  an  active  infection 
already present at baseline against which the vaccine would not be expected to protect.  
Overall, the point efficacy estimates in MAW were lower than those among YAW, and in particular, 
with  respect  to  the  most  important  HPV  16/18  endpoint  (VE  83.1%  vs.  95-99%  in  YAW).  It  was 
clarified that the disease attack rates differed among the young and older women with lower rates in 
the  placebo  group  of  MAW,  but  that  the  incidence  of  vaccine  HPV  type-related  persistent  infection 
and disease among vaccinated MAW and YAW were similar. 
P019  was  powered  to  demonstrate  vaccine  efficacy  against  composite  endpoints  of  persistent 
infection/disease in the HPV naïve population and not against vaccine type-related clinical disease (i.e. 
HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3). No statistical significant efficacy was shown against HPV 16/18-related 
CIN 2/3, vaccine efficacy was 75.2% (95% CI: -150.6, 99.5). 
HNRT population 
In  the  HNRT  population  vaccine  efficacy  was  lower;  74.6%  (58.1,  85.3)  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-
related persistent infection (PI)/disease, 71.6% (47.6, 85.5) against HPV 16/18-related PI/disease and 
80.2%  (51.7,  93.3)  against  HPV  6/11-related  PI/disease.    Vaccine  efficacy  was  also  lower  than  that 
seen  in  the  MITT-2  population  of  YAW.  A  contributing  factor  is  the  different  time  point  for  case-
counting,  which  started  earlier  in  the  HNRT  vs.  the  MITT-2  population.  Among  the  16  new  cases 
observed  in  the  HNRT  analysis  (compared  to  PPE),  10  were  HPV  16/18-related.  These  infections 
occurred during the vaccination course, which suggest that the vaccine did not provide protection prior 
to the completion of the 3 dose series, which is in contrast to that seen in YAW.  
The  MAH  provided  details  on  these  cases.  The  immune  responses  induced  by  the  qHPV  vaccine 
appeared satisfactory in all cases (except low anti-HPV 18 GMTs response observed in two subjects 
(<10 and 72 mMU/ml)). The case narrative was provided for the HPV 18-related persistent infection 
and this subject was shown to have achieved an acceptable antibody response to HPV 18 at Month 7. 
Most infections were related to HPV 16 (n=9) and HPV 6 (n=6). The majority of women did not have 
any new sexual partner reported at 6 months prior to Day 1. It is of note that two-thirds of the cases 
had co-infections with oncogenic non-vaccine HPV types at baseline, which might explain the early 
infections seen. 
Although  not  powered  for  CIN  2/3  or  AIS,  VE  was  only  25.4%,  with  3  cases  (one  CIN  3)  in  the 
vaccine group and 4 cases (3 CIN 2 and 1 AIS) in the placebo group. This finding raised concerns on a 
23/43 
 
 
potential negative impact of the vaccine and the MAH was asked to provide all details and the timing 
of  disease  in  these  cases.  In  the  group  that  received  vaccine  all  three  women  had  non-vaccine  HPV 
types  at  baseline  and  two  had  very  early  detection  of  HPV  16-related  disease,  at  Month  1  (CIN  1 
progressing to CIN 2 at Month 22)) and at Month 8 (CIN 3). It seems likely that both these subjects 
were  infected  at  baseline  (despite  a  negative  PCR)  and  therefore  it  is  not  possible  to  judge  if  the 
vaccine had any negative impact on the course of the HPV 16 infections. The third case  had CIN 2 
diagnosed  at  Month  18,  but  due  to  co-infection  with  HPV  51,  the  role  of  HPV  16  is  difficult  to 
interpret. All placebo cases were diagnosed with CIN 2/3 at later time points; Months 18, 24, 27 and 
30. It is noted that two of the four CIN 2 cases in the placebo group were co-infected with non-vaccine 
HPV types. In conclusion, based on the data provided there is no clear evidence of a negative impact 
of vaccination with qHPV vaccine in women with baseline infection. This issue is further discussed 
under  the  therapeutic  efficacy  header.  Overall,  the  efficacy  results  in  the  HNRT-analysis  versus 
MITT-2 analysis in YAW suggest that the vaccine is somewhat less efficacious in MAW. However, 
longer duration of follow-up is needed to get conclusive data.  
FAS (ITT) population 
In the FAS (ITT) population, very low efficacy was noted for the HPV 6/11/16/18-related PI/disease 
endpoint  (VE:  30.9%)  and  for  the  more  important  HPV  16/18-related  PI/disease  endpoint  only 
nominal  reductions  were  seen  (VE:  22.6%  (-2.9,  41.9)).  Efficacy for  the  HPV  6/11-related  endpoint 
was 47% (11.4, 69.2). 
These  point  estimates  are  much  lower  than  those  observed  among  YAW  and  the  results  in  the  two 
populations  cannot  be  considered  comparable.  With  respect  to  CIN  2/3  no  efficacy  at  all  was 
observed,  not  even  a  trend  (VE:  9.9%).  However,  the  study  was  not  powered  to  show  statistically 
significant  efficacy  in  the  FAS  population.  Furthermore,  the  different  efficacy  estimates  observed 
between MAW and YAW studies could be explained by the differences in sample size, study duration 
and exposure risk of acquiring infection. The consequence of the lower exposure risk in MAW is that 
it  will  take  much  longer  time  to  demonstrate  public  health  benefit  in  this  population  in  comparison 
with the YAW population. 
The number of cases vaccine type related CIN in the vaccine group, 10 CIN 2 and 14 CIN 3 (table 10), 
was  exactly  the  same  as  in  the  placebo  group.  The  CHMP  requested  all  details  on  these  cases, 
including the time course of the disease in order to exclude a negative impact of the qHPV vaccine, in 
particular  with  respect  to  HPV  16  infection.  The  MAH  provided  the  details  on  these  cases.  The 
breakdown  of  the  40  cases  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  2/3  revealed  that  the  majority  of  cases 
(n=33) were due to prevalent disease,  which would not be expected to be prevented by the vaccine. 
The  remaining  7  cases  were  incident  infections  (vaccine=3  and  placebo=4).  Of  the  3  vaccine  cases, 
one was confounded by co-infection with an oncogenic non-vaccine HPV type (HPV 51) and one had 
a very early HPV 16 infection (CIN 1 at Month 1) suggesting a baseline infection. The third case with 
a baseline infection with HPV 56 had a very rapid progression to HPV 16-related CIN 3 diagnosed at 
Month 8. However, this single case does not allow any general conclusions to be drawn as regards any 
impact of the vaccine on the course of disease. 
The hypothesis that the qHPV vaccine causes acceleration of CIN 2/3 or worse due to any HPV type 
issue is discussed under therapeutic efficacy. 
Furthermore, the vaccinated MAW population should be the subject of long-term follow-up to monitor 
duration of vaccine efficacy and to evaluate the need for a booster dose. This is important considering 
the  lower  immune  responses  obtained  in  older  women,  which  might  suggest  shorter  duration  of 
immunity compared to young adult women. The consequence of these lower antibody responses in the 
MAW  population  for  the  durability  of  efficacy  is  not  known  since  no  immunological  correlate  of 
protection  has  been  defined.  The  MAH  has  committed  to  submit  the  study  synopsis  of  a  sentinel 
cohort of P019. 
Overall,  very  low  efficacy  results  were  achieved  in  the  FAS-population.  Since  there  is  no  positive 
benefit risk in the general population, the indication remained unchanged in section 4.1 of the SPC.  
The data is reflected in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC to inform prescribers that the use of Gardasil in 
adult  women  should  take  into  consideration  the  variability  of  HPV  type  prevalence  in  different 
geographical areas. Moreover, a statement was included in the SPC that in the general population of 
24/43 
 
 
 
24- to 45-year-old women, no significant efficacy against HPV 16/18-related persistent infection and 
clinical  disease  has  been  demonstrated.  The  decision  to  vaccinate  an  individual  woman  24-45  years 
old  should  take  into  account  her  risk  for  previous  HPV  exposure  and  her  potential  benefit  from 
vaccination  and  that  Gardasil  is  not  effective  in  women  already  infected/diseased  at  the  start  of 
vaccination.  
Therapeutic efficacy 
The observation of a significantly higher clearance of HPV 16 DNA in the placebo group versus the 
vaccine group (percent incidence reduction 47.3 (95% CI: 0.4, 73.0)) among subjects who were Day 1 
PCR  positive  and  seronegative  to  HPV  16,  raised  major  concerns  and  was  identified  in  the  first 
assessment  as  a  second  major  objection.  The  study  population  was  limited,  but  together  with  the 
efficacy results in the FAS/HNRT populations with respect to CIN 2/3, the data could indicate that the 
vaccine  has  a  negative  impact  on  ongoing  HPV  infections.  Moreover,  a  similar  finding  was  seen 
initially in one of the pivotal YAW studies (P013), where data suggested that the vaccine aggravated 
disease in baseline HPV positive subjects. In response the MAH performed re-analyses due to the fact 
that  inaccurate  case/non-case  definitions  were  used  originally.  The  re-analyses  led  to  a  change  in 
percent  incidence  reduction  to  46%  (95%  CI:  -2.7,  72.4)  a  statistically  non-significant  result. 
Inconsistent results were observed in the PCR positive group depending on its serostatus. In addition, 
the  life  table  analysis  of  time-to-clearance  of  HPV  6  and  HPV  16  infection  showed  no  relevant 
difference between the vaccine and placebo groups. The “similar” finding in the YAW study 013 was 
only  seen  in  one  study,  in  one  subset  (not  in  PCR  positive/seronegative)  and  did  not  extend  to  the 
MAW population. Moreover, the vaccine efficacy results in MAW with respect to HPV16/18-related 
CIN  2/3  in  PCR  positive/seronegative  subjects  did  not  corroborate  the  negative  therapeutic  efficacy 
trend with respect to clearance of HPV 16 infection. Furthermore, there is no plausible mechanism for 
a negative effect of the vaccine on on-going HPV infections.  From the above the CHMP concluded 
that  the  overall  pattern  is  not  consistent  with  a  negative  impact  of  the  vaccine  on  prevalent  HPV 
infections. 
The MAH provided data on the cumulative incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN 2/3, which was 
lower in the vaccine group than in the placebo group suggesting no acceleration of vaccine HPV type-
related disease progression (see figure 1). However, the lack of separation of the cumulative incidence 
plots  on  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  2/3  in  the  FAS-population  between  vaccine  and  placebo  group  at 
Month 24 raised concern. However, due to the small sample size (500 subjects in each group still to be 
included in the 24 month time point) these curves are not fully representative. The lower number of 
subjects at Month 24 would result in a lower incidence of new infections in the placebo group, a likely 
explanation  for  the  flattened  incidence  curve.  The  results  at  Month  48  will  be  important  to  reveal 
whether  the  cumulative  incidence  plots  will  separate  between  the  vaccine  and  placebo  groups  in  a 
similar way as that observed in the young adult women 
In contrast, to the findings for vaccine HPV types, figure 2 showed  the opposite pattern with higher 
incidence of CIN 2/3 due to any HPV type and a steeper curve by time in the vaccine group. These 
findings raised a  major concern since it could suggest an  accelerated progression of CIN 2/3 due to 
any HPV type among vaccinated subjects compared with those in the placebo group. In response the 
MAH  provided  relevant  data  for  FAS  population  to  clarify  this  issue  including  narratives  for  all 
CIN2/3 cases observed. 
The breakdown of cases of CIN 2/3 in the FAS population by prevalent and incident cases showed in 
the MAH´s reasoning that there were only 2 cases of incident infection in the vaccine group (out of 9 
putative incident cases) and 1 case in the placebo group (out of 2 putative incident cases). However, 
the exclusions made by the MAH were not fully supported, resulting in 4 cases of incident infection in 
the vaccine group versus 1 case in the placebo group. It is important to mention here that the presence 
of  prevalent  or  pre-existing  HPV  infection  due  to  non-vaccine  HPV  types  in  the  FAS  population 
complicates the analysis. The baseline imbalances observed between the vaccine and placebo groups 
were addressed by the MAH. This analysis showed that the higher incidence of CIN 2/3 related to four 
non-vaccine HPV types (33, 39, 51 and 58) among vaccines is likely to be attributed to the baseline 
imbalance  in  prevalent  infection  corresponding  to  the  relevant  HPV  type.  For  three  further  non-
vaccine HPV types (HPV 45, 56 and 59) with higher incidence of CIN 2/3 in the vaccine group, the 
case  histories  do  not  suggest  that  qHPV  vaccine  accelerates  progression  of  disease  related  to  the 
relevant HPV type.  
25/43 
 
For CIN 2/3 not related to any of the typeable 14 HPV types, the cumulative incidence in the vaccine 
group was higher than in the placebo group, although not statistically significantly different. However 
there were too few cases (6 in the vaccine group vs. 5 in the placebo group) to draw conclusions. The 
end-of-study results at Month 48 are important in order to show whether a larger difference between 
groups will be discernable. 
Moreover, it is difficult to hypothesize a plausible mechanism for a negative effect of the vaccine on 
on-going HPV infections. 
The time to event data on CIN 2/3 are not possible to be evaluated in cases with baseline infections 
since  the  duration  of  prevalent  HPV  infection  prior  to  vaccination  is  not  known.  The  MAH  has 
provided  results of analysis of efficacy of the qHPV vaccine against CIN 2/3 related to any of the 10 
non-vaccine HPV types in the cohort of women who were PCR positive at Day 1 to the relevant HPV 
type, i.e., women infected at baseline with the relevant HPV type and the results of comparison of the 
qHPV vaccine group and placebo group with respect to the cumulative incidence of CIN2/3 related to 
any  of  the  10  non-vaccine  HPV  types  in  the  same  cohort  of  women.  The  results  do  not  suggest  a 
clinically significant acceleration of disease progression in the vaccine group compared to the placebo 
group. 
Overall,  the  data  provided,  do  not  suggest  that  the  qHPV  vaccine  accelerates  progression  of  disease 
related to vaccine HPV types. At the present time there is no indication of the occurrence of HPV type 
replacement  disease  in  the  vaccine  group.  However,  these  issues  must  be  closely  monitored  during 
longer term follow-up and must be addressed again in the end-of-study report of Protocol 019. 
Analysis  of  efficacy  against  the  recurrence  of  persistent  HPV  6/11/16/18  infection  among  subjects 
who  were  seropositive  and  PCR  negative  to  the  relevant  HPV  type  at  baseline  did  not  reveal  any 
statistically significant result. The data at the current stage are too limited to allow any firm conclusion 
on this matter.  However,  there were 3  cases with persistent HPV 16 infection in the vaccine group 
(vs.  6  cases  in  the  placebo  group),  which  suggest  that  the  vaccine  might  not  be  effective  against 
recurrences.  Vaccine  efficacy  against  persistent  HPV  16  infection  in  the  seropositive/PCR  negative 
subset  could  not  be  demonstrated  in  either  the  YAW  or  MAW  population,  (although  efficacy  was 
observed for HPV 16 CIN in the young adult women).  
1.3 
Immunogenicity 
Protocol 019 included the immunogenicity evaluation. The study enrolled a total of 3819 subjects in 2 
approximately  equal  age  strata  (24-  to  34-year-olds  and  35-  to  45-year-olds).  All  subjects  were  to 
undergo serology testing for anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, and anti-HPV 18 levels at Day 1, 
and Months 7, 12, 24, 36, and 48. The primary immunogenicity evaluations were to be conducted in 
the  PPI  population.  The  study  is  ongoing.  The  current  application  includes  results  from  all  visits 
through 13-July-2007 (corresponding primarily to the Day 1, Month 7, and Month 24 visits).  
In addition to the new immunogenicity data from P019, an integrated immunogenicity analysis of the 
immune response over the entire range of 9 to 45 years of age was provided.  
1.3.1 
 Methods 
The below characteristics are specific for the immunogenicity analysis. 
Study population 
Per-Protocol immunogenicity (PPI) population 
The per-protocol population for immunogenicity (PPI) analysis generally included subjects who were 
seronegative  and  PCR  negative  to  the  relevant  HPV  type(s)  at  Day  1,  remained  HPV  PCR  negative 
through 1 month post dose 3 (Month 7), received all 3 vaccinations within pre-specified time intervals, 
and no deviation from the study protocol. 
26/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Objectives 
The immunogenicity objectives were: 
  To  evaluate  the  kinetics  and  age  dependence  of  anti-HPV  6,  11,  16,  and  18  responses 
following administration of a 3-dose regimen of qHPV vaccine  
  To  compare  anti-HPV  6,  11,  16,  and  18  responses  following  administration  of  a  3-dose 
regimen of qHPV vaccine among HPV-naïve women 24 to 45 years of age enrolled in P019 
and HPV-naïve women 16 to 23 years of age from P011, P012 (substudies of P013) and the 
Consistency Lot substudy of P015.  
The  immunogenicity  of  the  HPV  vaccines  was  measured  using  the  method  competitive  Luminex-
based immunoassay (cLIA). The method was requalified as cLIA version 2. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The immunogenicity endpoints for the clinical program have focused on 2 parameters:  
  Anti-HPV levels (geometric mean titers [GMTs]),  
  The proportion of subjects who became seropositive to each of the 4 antigens 4 weeks after 
the third dose.  
The immunogenicity time points of interest were: 
  Month 7: The primary immunogenicity endpoint was anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 serum cLIA 
levels  at  Month  7  in  the  defined  PPI  population,  as  this  time  point  reflected  the  time  frame 
during which peak vaccine-induced immune responses were expected.   
  Persistence time points. Depending on the protocol, subjects underwent serology testing at 6- 
to 24-month intervals following the Month 7 visit. The data collected at these time points were 
used to evaluate the durability of vaccine-induced anti-HPV responses.

Results 
1.3.2.1   
Protocol 19 
GMTs 
Table 13 shows the anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs for the vaccine group and placebo group in the 
PPI population at Day 1, Month 7 and Month 24. For each of the vaccine HPV types, and at all the 
time  points  evaluated,  the  GMTs  in  the  placebo  group  were  below  the  lower  limit  of  quantification 
(LLOQ) of the assay. In the vaccine group measurable immune responses well above the LLOQ were 
induced at 4 weeks Postdose 3. At Month 24, the anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 GMTs were lower, in 
particular  with  respect  to  anti-HPV  18.  For  anti-HPV  18  the  GMT  at  Month  24  was  approximately 
50%  of  the  baseline  GMT  among  subjects  who  were  anti-HPV  18  seropositive/PCR  negative  at 
baseline.

Seroconversion 
The percentage of seroconversion in each of the vaccine HPV types at all time points evaluated were 
less than 5% in the placebo group (Table 14). In the vaccine group, the percentage seroconversion at 
Month  7  was  at  least  97%  for  each  of  the  vaccine  HPV  types.  At  Month  24  the  percententage 
seroconversion  had  dropped  by  <10%  for  each  of  HPV  types  6,  11,  and  16.  For  HPV  18,  the 
percentage seroconversion at 4 weeks postdose 3 dropped by 43 percentage points at Month 24 and the 
percentage seropositive was 54.7%.

Vaccine-type anti-HPV responses by age group in the HPV naïve population  
Comparison of 24 to 34 year-olds and 35 to 45 year-olds 
Anti-HPV  GMTs  at  Months  7  and  24  were  somewhat  lower  among  35-  to  45-year-old  women 
compared with 24- to 34-year-old women, though the difference was not statistically significant (i.e., 
the CIs were overlapping). 
For each of the vaccine HPV types, the percent seroconversion at Month 7 and Month 24 was similar 
between the 2 age groups. 
Comparison of 16 to 23 year-olds and 25 to 45 year-olds 
The anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11 and anti-HPV 18 GMTs at Month 7 and Month 24 were significantly 
higher  in  the  16  to  23  year-olds  compared  to  those  in  the  24  to  45  year-olds  (95%  CIs  not 
overlapping).  Anti-HPV  16  GMTs  were  comparable  between  the  age  groups  at  Month  7,  but  were 
significantly higher in the 16 to 23 year-olds at Month 24. 
The percent seroconversion for each of the 4 vaccine HPV types at Month 7 was comparable between 
age groups.  At Month 24, the percent seroconversion for each of the 4 vaccine HPV types was higher 
in the 16 to 23 year-old age group compared to that in the 24 to 45 year-old age group (95% CIs do not 
overlap). 
Comparison of 16 to 23 year-olds, 24 to 34 year-olds and 35 to 45 year-olds 
Month 7 
For anti-HPV 6, 11 and 18 GMT at Month 7 was highest in the 16 to 23-old age group and lowest in 
the 35 to 45 year old. In general the GMTs in each of the 3 age groups were different (95% CIs of the 
GMTs did not overlap), and decreased as the age progressed.  
  Among 24 to 34 year-olds anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 GMTs were 82%, 79%, 102% and 87%, 
respectively, of the corresponding anti HPV GMTs among 16 to 23 year-olds. 
  Among 35 to 45 year-olds anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 GMTs were 74%, 67%, 93% and 71%, 
respectively, of the corresponding anti-HPV GMTs among 16 to 23 year-olds. 
  The percent seroconversion for each of the 4 vaccine HPV types was comparable in all 3 age 
groups. 
Month 24 
In general the anti-HPV GMTs for each of the 4 vaccine types at Month 24 was lower compared to the 
GMTs at Month 7 and the Month 24 GMTs decreased as age progressed. 
  Among 24 to 34 year-olds anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 GMTs were 64%, 57%, 63% and 60%, 
respectively, of the corresponding anti-HPV GMTs among 16 to 23 year-olds. 
  Among 35 to 45 year-olds anti-HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 GMTs were 62%, 51%, 59% and 50%, 
respectively, of the corresponding anti-HPV GMTs among 16 to 23 year-olds. 
  The percent seroconversion for each of the 4 vaccine HPV types was higher in the 16 to 23 
year-olds compared to that in the other 2 older age groups. 
Vaccine HPV type anti-HPV responses in populations with prior HPV exposure 
Seropositive/PCR negative population 
At Day 1 anti-HPV GMTs were comparable in the  vaccine and placebo group. At Month 7 the GMTs 
in  the  vaccine  group  increased  at  greater  magnitude  in  the  baseline  HPV  seropositive  subjects 
compared to those in the HPV-naïve population. At Month 24 the GMTs were lower than at Month 7, 
but  were  higher  in  the  baseline  seropositive  subjects  than  the  GMTs  in  the  PPI  population.  In  the 
placebo group there was a steady decline in GMTs.

Seropositive/PCR positive population 
The number of evaluable patients was small. In the placebo group GMTs were somewhat higher than 
those observed in the seropositive/PCR negative group. In the vaccine group, the anti-HPV GMTs at 
Months  7  and  24  were  higher  in  the  seropositive/PCR  positive  subjects  than  those  in  the  PPI 
population. 
Seronegative/PCR positive population 
The number of evaluable patients was small. In the placebo group anti-HPV 6, anti-HPV 11 and anti-
HPV 16 seroconversion was observed. At Month 7, 41.2%, 100% (one subject), 23.9% and 4.3% of 
subjects  who  were  HPV  6,  HPV  11,  HPV  16  and  HPV  DNA-18  positive  had  seroconverted  in  the 
placebo  group.  The  anti-HPV  6,  11  and  18  GMTs  at  Months  7  and  24  in  the  vaccine  group  were 
somewhat higher in the baseline PCR positive subjects than those in the PPI population, whereas anti-
HPV 16 levels were slightly lower. 
1.3.2.2   
Integrated review 
The  integrated  review  of  the  immunogenicity  of  qHPV  vaccine  includes  data  from  the  following 
protocols: P007 (Phase II dose ranging study of in YAW) ; P013 (Phase III efficacy study in YAW; 
substudies P011 and P012); P015 (Phase III efficacy study in YAW); P016 (Phase III adult-adolescent 
immunogenicity bridging study); P018 (Phase III immunogenicity and safety study in pre-adolescents 
and  adolescents);  and  P019  (Phase  III  efficacy,  safety,  and  immunogenicity  study  in  mid-adult 
women).  
Baseline characteristics seem to exert some influence on the Month 7 immune response with age as the 
strongest predictor for all vaccine HPV types, The decreases in Month 7 anti-HPV natural log titers 
associated with one year´s increase in enrolment age were calculated and corresponded to 2.9%, 2.6%, 
2.8%  and  3.5%  decrease  in  anti-HPV  6,  11,  16  and  18  GMTs,  respectively.  Some  variability  in 
response was seen by race/ethnicity and by geographic region, but no significant pattern was evident.  
The  integrated  review  of  immunogenicity  showed  that  age  influenced  significantly  on  Month  7  and 
Month 24 anti-HPV titres for all vaccine HPV types. The type-specific GMTs were highest in 9- to 17-
year-olds and decreased with an increase in the enrolment age, being the lowest in the 35- to 45-year-
olds.  The  age-related  decline  in  GMTs  was  most  pronounced  over  the  9-  to  17-year  old  age  range, 
whereafter it was more gradual between ages 18 to 45. The Month 7 GMTs were 2 to 3 fold lower in 
the 35- to 45 year-olds compared with those in 9- to 17-year-olds.  
At  Month  24,  the  GMTs  of  the  4  vaccine  HPV  types  had  decreased  substantially  from  the  peak  at 
Month  7  in  all  vaccine  recipients  across  age  groups.  The  GMTs  for  HPV  18  were  low  in  all  age 
groups, but in particular in the MAW population, where the antibody levels had declined below those 
in  subjects  naturally  infected.  The  proportions  of  subjects  who  were  anti-HPV  6,  11  and  16 
seropositive at Month 24 remained above 89% in all age groups; the seropositivity rates being 3 to 6 
percentage  points  lower  in  the  35-  to  45  year-olds  than  in  the  18-  to  26-year-olds.  With  respect  to 
HPV18, only 55% of MAW remained seropositive as opposed to 85% of 9- to 17-year-olds. 
1.3.3  Discussion 
The version 2 of the HPV-4 cLIA assay was appropriately validated. 
Protocol  019,  at  month  7,  the  qHPV  vaccine  induced  an  immune  response  to  all  four  HPV  types. 
Seroconversion  rates  for  all  HPV  type  were  comparable  (>97%).  As  regards  persistence  of  immune 
response, for all HPV types, anti-HPV GMTs declined between Month 7 and Month 24. Anti-HPV 6, 
anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16 remained above the baseline levels, while for anti-HPV 18 the level was 
below that of baseline and somewhat lower than that observed up to 4 years post enrollment in young 
women (see variation II/19) [28.4 mMU/ml) (95%CI: 26.9, 30.0) vs. 33.9 mMU/ml (32.0, 35.9)].  
The study demonstrated that administration of the qHPV vaccine to baseline HPV vaccine-type naïve 
24-  to  45-year-old  women  resulted  in  anti-HPV  6/11/16/18  responses  at  Month  7  that  were 
30/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significantly  lower  than  those  observed  in  16-  to  23-  year-old  (non-overlapping  95%  CIs).  The 
exception was anti-HPV 16 GMTs that were comparable between the two age groups. When analyzed 
by the two age strata of MAW, the lowest responses were observed in the 35- to 45-year-olds. It can 
be concluded that the magnitude of antibody response to the qHPV vaccine was related to age, with 
the highest response achieved in the younger women. The most robust responses were demonstrated 
against  HPV  16  and  the  weakest  response  to  HPV  18.  At  Month  24,  the  anti-HPV  GMTs  for  all  4 
vaccine types had decreased substantially. 
Subjects who were positive to the relevant HPV type at baseline had substantially higher GMTs. These 
data suggest the qHPV vaccine induces an anamnestic response in individuals seropositive as a result 
of prior natural infection.  
From the integrated analyses it can be concluded that the vaccine-induced immune responses in MAW 
were inferior to those seen in adolescents and young women. The consequence of these lower antibody 
responses in the MAW population for the durability of efficacy is not known, since no immunological 
correlate of protection has been defined. The low Month 24 GMTs and seropositivity rate for HPV 18 
raised concern. The data demonstrated that cLIA seems not to be the optimal test to measure long-term 
vaccine  induced  HPV  immunity  (since  protection  in  YAW  was  sustained  despite  seronegativity  to 
HPV  18).  This  assay  might  be  too  specific  measuring  only  antibodies  against  a  single  type-specific 
neutralizing epitope on L1 VLPs and not all relevant neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, the MAH has 
committed  to  perform  serological  studies  using  broader  neutralization  assays,  i.e.  pseudo-
neutralization  assays,  as  well  as  to  submit  the  validation  protocol  and  final  results  using  the  newly 
developed assay measuring the VLP-specific total IgG. The MAH submitted the relevant study reports 
in April 2009 and they are currently under assessment, as a follow up measure. 
In  addition,  the  long-term  surveillance  of  disease  outcomes  in  young  adult  women  will  reveal  the 
significance  of  the  seronegativity  to  HPV  18.  However  considering  the  lower  immune  response 
observed  in vaccinated  mid-adult  women  it  is  critical to  determine  whether  this  translates  to  shorter 
duration  of  immunity  and  necessitates  an  earlier  booster  dose.  At  the  current  stage  after  a  relatively 
short  duration  of  follow-up  (2.2  years)  in  study  019,  no  obvious  breakthrough  infections  have  been 
documented. However, long-term follow-up of efficacy and immunogenicity in MAW is mandatory. 
The  MAH  has  committed  to  submit  a  study  synopsis  on  a  long  term  follow  up  of  vaccine  efficacy, 
immunogenicity and safety in MAW and a Protocol. 
Baseline characteristics seemed to exert some influence on the Month 7 immune response with age as 
the strongest predictor for all vaccine HPV types. In the multifactor models, BMI was found to be a 
significant predictor for Month 7 anti-HPV 18 titers and for Month 24 anti-HPV 11, 16 and 18 titers in 
18-26  year  old  female.  Unfortunately,  BMI  was  not  included  in  the  modeling  for  the  MAW.  This 
factor is of interest since  the qHPV vaccine is  similar to the recombinant Hep B vaccine, for which 
BMI is a well-known factor associated with a reduced immune response. The results of the modeling 
exercise were difficult to interpret, since the significant predictors of Month 7 and Month 24 anti-HPV 
responses varied by HPV type and by age group in an inconsistent pattern. The MAH was requested to 
clarify  whether  there  are  any  baseline  characteristics  that  are  associated  with  a  decreased  immune 
response to qHPV vaccine that deserve to be mentioned in the SPC. It was shown that multiple factors 
influenced on the anti-HPV titres. Overall age is the most important predictor of titer response with the 
strongest  immune  responses  observed  in  youngest  subjects  below  12  years  of  age.  Importantly,  no 
particular  subgroup  has  been  identified  with  poor  responses  to  the  vaccine.  Moreover,  the  factors 
evaluated have not so far been identified to impact on short-term efficacy. Whether the lower response 
associated with some of the factors will affect the durability of immunity is not known at present, but 
will be shown in the on-going long-term surveillance studies. 
The subjects who were seropositive to the relevant  HPV type(s) at baseline had much higher GMTs 
than those who were seronegative to the same HPV type(s) at Day 1, suggesting the induction of an 
anamnestic  response  in  naturally  infected  subjects.  Among  MAW  who  were  seropositive  to  vaccine 
HPV types at Day 1, vaccine induced immune response to the types for which they were positive were 
comparable to those observed among YAW who were seropositive to the same type at Day 1.  
31/43 
 
 
 
 
 
Mild  to  moderate  deviations  (+1  month  with  administration  of  Dose  2  and  +2  months  with 
administration of Dose 3) from the current dosing schedule of a 3-vaccine injection series at Day 1, 
Month 2 and Month 6 did not have a major impact on the Month 7 or Month 24 anti-HPV immune 
responses.  
In conclusion, section 5.1 of the SPC reflects the study results and was endorsed by the CHMP with 
minor  changes.  Furthermore,  a  paragraph  concerning  persistent  of  immune  response  was  included 
upon  CHMP  request  to  add  the  percentages  of  MAW  vaccinated  women  per  subtype  that  remained 
seropositive after a follow up of 2.2 years. 
The MAH submitted the relevant study reports to measure long-term vaccine induced HPV immunity 
test in April 2009 that are currently under assessment as a follow up measure. 
1.4 
Clinical safety 
The MAH has provided the safety analysis of study 019 conducted in 3819 healthy 24 to 45 year-old 
women enrolled in 38 sites in 7 countries. The data are obtained from the start of the study through the 
visit cut-off date of 13-Jul-2007. The cut-off date for SAEs reported to the WAES was 16-May-2008. 
Furthermore,  the  MAH  has  submitted  an  integrated  overview  of  safety  data  in  the  population  of 
subjects 9 to  45 years (including studies P007, P013, P015, P016, P018 and P019) across the entire 
age  range.  In  addition  integrated  safety  data  is  presented  by  age,  in  order  to  provide  a  comparison 
between the age groups (9 to 17 years, 18 to 26 years, 27 to 34 years and 35 to 45 years). Protocol 019 
contributes all subjects in the categories of 27 to 34 years and 35 to 45 years. All safety data in clinical 
trials of qHPV vaccine in studies of subjects 9 to 26 years of age have been submitted previously in 
the EU to the CHMP in the context of the MAA and subsequent Type-II variations. 
Furhermore, the MAH proposes the deletion of “Injection-site bruising” from section 4.8 of the SPC. 
1.4.1  Protocol 019 
Patient exposure 
Overall,  3819  subjects  were  enrolled  in  this  study;  two  (2)  subjects  were  randomised  but  not 
vaccinated (resulting in 3817 vaccinated subjects). A total of 1910 subjects received at least one dose 
of qHPV vaccine and 1907 subjects received at least one dose of placebo. 
The mean age was 34.3 years in both groups. Thirty-one percent (31%) of subjects were Asian, 43% 
were  Hispanic  American  and  20%  were  white.  Approximately  13%  of  the  subjects  originated  from 
Europe, 13% from North- America, 42% from Latin-America and 31% from Asia. 
Adverse events 
From Protocol 019 the following observations can be made: 
  The proportions of subjects who reported at least one clinical AE was somewhat higher in the 
group that received qHPV vaccine (87.1%) than in the placebo group (81.3%). 
  The proportion of subjects who reported at least one injection site AE was somewhat higher in 
the group that received qHPV vaccine (76.8%) than in the placebo group (64.3%). 
  The proportion of subjects who reported at least one systemic AE was generally comparable 
between  the  two  vaccination  groups  (59.3%  in  the  qHPV  group  and  60.1%  in  the  placebo 
group). 
  Few subjects discontinued the study due to an AE (0.4% in the qHPV group and 0.1% in the 
placebo  group)  or  a  vaccine  related  AE  (0.3%  in  the  qHPV  group  and  0.1%  in  the  placebo 
group). 
  A  total  of  11  subjects  who  received  qHPV  vaccine  (0.6%)  and  a  total  of  15  subjects  who 
received  placebo  (0.8%)  reported  a  serious  clinical  adverse  experience  (SAE)  at  any  time 
during the study. None of the SAEs were determined by the investigator to be related to study 
vaccine/placebo. 
  There were 5 deaths: one in the placebo group (0.1%) and 4 in the vaccine group (0.2%). The 
deaths occurred at least 4 months after vaccination and were not determined to be related to 
study vaccine. 
32/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Injection site Adverse Experiences: The most common injection site AEs in both the vaccine and the 
placebo group, respectively, were pain (75.3% and 62.0%), swelling (18.7% and 11.3%) and erythema 
(14.5% and 10.5). In general the proportion of subjects who reported specific injection site AEs was 
higher in the qHPV group than in the placebo group. 
Systemic  Clinical  Adverse  Experiences:    In  both  the  vaccine  and  placebo  groups,  respectively,  the 
most common clinical AEs were headache (27.8% and 27.5%), pyrexia (11.6% and 12.3%), influenza 
(5.2%  and  5.4%),  nasopharyngitis  (4.2%  and  4.7%),  and  dizziness  (4.2%  and  4.3%).  In  general  the 
proportion of subjects who reported a systemic AE was comparable between the vaccination groups. 
The  exception  was  pain  in  the  extremity  where  the  proportion  of  subjects  was  higher  in  the  qHPV 
vaccine group than in the placebo group (4.7% vs 2.2%). 
Elevated  temperatures:  The  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  qHPV  vaccine  group  who  had  maximum 
temperature >37.8 º C was comparable to that in the placebo. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
At  the  time  of  the  closing  of  the  study  database  for  the  current  analysis  5  subjects  (4  in  the  qHPV 
vaccine group and 1 in the placebo group) died during the study. 
The  deaths  occurred  at  least  4  months  after  vaccination.  None  of  the  deaths  was  determined  to  be 
related to study vaccine. 
Serious adverse events 
A total of 11 subjects in the qHPV vaccine group (0.6% of the 1908 subjects) and a total of 15 subjects 
in the placebo group (0.8 % of the 1902 subjects) reported a SAE at any time during the study. None 
of the SAEs was determined to be related to study vaccine/placebo.The most common SAEs in both 
vaccination groups were pregnancy related (premature labour, ectopic pregnancy). The most common 
non-pregnancy  related  SAE  was  pelvic  inflammatory  disease.  The  incidences  were  comparable 
between the vaccination groups. 
New medical history in the safety population 
The  MAH  presented  the  new  medical  conditions  with  an  incidence  >  1%  in  either  treatment  group 
during the vaccination period (Day 1 through Month 7). The most common new  medical conditions 
reported  were  headache  (3.3%  vs.  4.1%),  nasopharyngitis  (2.6%  vs.  2.1%),  and  bacterial  vaginitis 
(2.0%  vs.  1.6%).  The  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  new  medical  conditions  was  generally 
comparable between the two vaccination groups. 
Among nervous system disorders headache prevailed. No other unlisted neurological symptoms were 
specifically described.  
The  number  and  percentage  of  new  medical  conditions  potentially  indicative  of  an  autoimmune 
phenomenon among all subjects in the safety population reported post month 7 by vaccination group 
shows that the most common diagnosis was hypothyroidism (0.4% in the qHPV group and 0.5% in the 
placebo  group).  Overall  the  reporting  of  potential  autoimmune  conditions  was  comparable  between 
vaccination groups. 
Safety in special groups  
The  initial  MAA  included  safety  summaries  by  concomitant  medications  including  systemic, 
immunosuppressive,  anti-inflammatory  or  antipyretic  formulations  or  contraceptives.  The  MAH 
anticipated  no  differences  in  safety  profiles  in  this  respect  in  subjects  27  to  45  years  of  age  as 
compared to subjects 9 to 26 years and therefore did not conduct such analysis in study P019. 
Pregnancy outcomes 
Pregnancy outcomes were generally comparable between the two vaccination groups. 
33/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Congenital anomalies 
A total of 5 congenital anomalies were reported for pregnancies (live births, foetal losses). Of these, 2 
were  in  an  infant  (with  ventricular  septal  defect  and  adrenal  neoplasm)  and  one  in  a  foetus  (with 
bilateral  renal  agenesis)  born  to  subjects  in  the  qHPV  vaccine  group  and  2  were  in  infants  (with 
hypochondroplasia  and  congenital  hydronephrosis)  born  in  the  placebo  group.  No  specific  anomaly 
could be possibly related to vaccination. 
Analysis of pregnancy outcomes in subsets of subjects in protocol 019 
Analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of the qHPV vaccine on pregnancy outcomes among 
subjects  whose  estimated  date  of  conception  (ECDn)  calculated  by  last  menstrual  period  occurred 
within 30 days of receiving a dose of study vaccine (Proximate Pregnancies). 
The  outcome  of  pregnancies  that  occurred  within  30  days  of  a  vaccination  reported  1  case  in  the 
placebo group but none in the qHPV group.  In the group of subjects whose EDCn greater that 30 days 
following any vaccination were 3 cases of congenital anomalies reported in the qHPV group but 1 in 
the placebo group.  
Analysis  of  pregnancy  outcomes  in  subsets  of  subjects  in  the  phase  III  clinical  program  for 
qHPV vaccine 
A total of 14 infants born to 14 subjects in the  qHPV vaccine group experienced a SAE.  None was 
judged to be vaccine related. A total of 14 infants born to 14 subjects in the placebo group experienced 
a SAE.  
Serious adverse experiences reported in women who reported pregnancies 
Twelve (12) SAEs were reported by subjects during pregnancy. None of these SAEs were determined 
to be vaccine/placebo related. 
Administration of qHPV vaccine to lactating women 
No  SAEs  were  reported  among  subjects  who  were  breast-feeding  during  the  study.  Data  were 
provided in cumulative tabulations of the combined protocols as described below.  
1.4.2  Protocols 013, 015, 016, 018 and 019 combined 
Patient exposure 
For the integrated summaries, 2 safety populations were specified (as for the initial MAA and previous 
Type-II variations). 
 
Safety population: includes all subjects who were enrolled in Protocols 007, 013, 015, 016, 018 
and 019 who received only qHPV vaccine or placebo (aluminium or non-aluminium), regardless 
of surveillance method. This population included 25,274 subjects; 13,686 subjects who received 
qHPV vaccine (as the subjects who received qHPV vaccine in the extension to Protocol 007 are 
not included) and 11,588 subjects who received placebo. 
  Detailed Safety Population: includes all subjects who were enrolled in protocols 007, 013, 015, 
016,  018  and  019  who  received  only  qHPV  vaccine  or  placebo  (aluminium  or  non-aluminium) 
who were followed using the VRC-aided surveillance method. This population included 14,034 
subjects;  8,068  subjects  who  received  qHPV  vaccine  and  5,966  subjects  who  received  placebo. 
All subjects in Protocol 019 were followed using VRC-aided surveillance. 
Overall the proportion of subjects 9 to 45 years of age who were randomised to receive qHPV vaccine 
in the integrated database consisted of 25% of subjects 9 to 17 years of age, 63% of subjects 18 to 26 
years of age, 5% of subjects 27 to 34 years of age and 7% 35 to 45 years of age. The proportions for 
subjects randomised to receive placebo were 15% of subjects 9 to 17 years of age, 71% of subjects 18 
to 26 years of age, 6% of subjects 27 to 34 years of age and 8% of subjects 35 to 45 years of age. 
A  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  integrated  data  set  who  received  qHPV  vaccine  (49.1%) 
reported  an  injection  site  experience  than  subjects  who  received  placebo  (37.1%).  The  rates  of 
discontinuation were not impacted. 
34/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  the  detailed  safety  population  the  frequency  by  age  of  injection  site  reactions  were  higher  in  the 
younger age groups (9-17 years old) with more erythema and swelling.  
The proportions of subjects reporting a systemic AE were comparable between the vaccination groups. 
The  most  common  systemic  AEs  were  headache,  pyrexia,  nausea  and  nasopharyngitis.  A  great 
majority of systemic AEs were mild or moderate in intensity both in the vaccine and placebo groups. 
In  the  qHPV  group  the  proportions  of  subjects  reporting  systemic  AEs  were  generally  comparable 
across age groups. The only exception was a higher frequency of pain in the extremity in the older age 
category. 
The most common SAEs in both vaccination groups were pregnancy related. None of the SAEs was 
determined to be related to study vaccine or placebo. 
New  medical  conditions  potentially  consistent  with  autoimmune  phenomena  reported  post-month  7 
among  all  subjects  by  vaccination  group  showed  proportions  of  such  reported  events  comparable 
between the vaccine and placebo groups. 
Overall  data  from  the  combined  study  protocols  showed  that  the  proportions  of  pregnancies  with 
natural outcome that ended in a negative outcome were comparable between the vaccination groups. A 
total of 70 cases of congenital anomaly included 40 cases in the qHPV vaccine group and 30 cases in 
the  placebo  group.  The  proportions  of  live  births  resulting  congenital  anomalies  were  comparable: 
2.6% (38/1447) in the qHPV vaccine group and 1.9% (27/1424) in the placebo group. The number of 
pregnancies resulting in congenital anomaly was within the incidence rate of 3% to 4% in large health 
care systems. No specific medical conditions could be related to any of the vaccine groups. 
The  follow-up  of  breast-fed  infants  of mothers  vaccinated  identifies  more  SAEs  in  the  qHPV  group 
compared  to  the  placebo  group.  There  were  no  patterns  or  trends  in  the  types  of  serious  adverse 
experiences reported in infants who were breastfed during the vaccination phase of clinical studies. No 
safety signals of clinical concern were identified among these infants.  
1.4.3  Discussion 
No  new  or  significant  safety  signals  were  identified  with  the  exception  of  increased  incidences  of 
transient  injection-site  adverse  experiences  and  low-grade  fever  following  vaccination  in  the  new 
Medical History safety data from P019 or the Protocols 013, 015, 016, 018 and 019 combined. The 
proportions  of  subjects  who  reported  SAEs  or  who  discontinued  due  to  a  SAE  were  low  and 
comparable between the vaccination groups. Vaccine-related SAEs occurred in <1% of the subjects. 
Reporting  frequency  of  adverse  events  was  similar  in  the  different  age  ranges  except  for  the  higher 
frequency of pain in the extremity in older subjects and somewhat higher frequency of erythema and 
swelling in the younger age range. 
The MAH proposed to delete the “Injection-site bruising” from section 4.8 of the SPC. The tabulation 
of subjects with Injection Site Adverse Experiences (>1% in one or more vaccination groups) indicate 
that the AE “Injection Site Bruising” occurs in  2,1%  reports in the qHPV group and in 2.2% of the 
non-aluminium  containing  placebo  vs  2.3%  of  the  aluminium  containing  placebo.  The  injection  site 
adverse reactions may be well covered by the remaining PTs. “Bruising” is most likely associated with 
the injection procedure rather than the nature of the injected product and would thus be considered to 
be  an  adverse  effect  of  vaccination  although  very  rarely  occurring.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considers 
that “bruising” should remain listed. 
The  follow-up  of  breast-fed  infants  of mothers  vaccinated  identifies  more  SAEs  in  the  qHPV  group 
compared to the placebo group. However, the excess of AEs in the qHPV group was not specific and 
not considered related to vaccination. 
Use  of  qHPV  vaccine  did  not  impact  overall  pregnancy  outcomes.  Nor  did  administration  of  qHPV 
vaccine  to  nursing  mothers  affect  the  health  of  the  mother  or  the  nursing  child.  Rates  of  foetal  loss 
35/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were slightly lower among subjects who received qHPV vaccine compared with the placebo groups. 
Slightly  more  foetuses/infants  with  congenital  anomalies  were  observed  in  subjects  who  became 
pregnant  in  the  qHPV  vaccine  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  However,  the  congenital 
anomalies that were observed were diverse and deemed to be highly unlikely related to the vaccine. 
A comprehensive description of the reported arthritis/arthropathia cases has been provided. A causal 
relationship between these diagnoses and qHPV vaccination could not be proven in any of the cases. 
According  to  the  cases  narratives  one  case  of  arthritis  was  autoimmune  in  nature  and  one  case  was 
considered as reactive arthritis caused by an infection. One case reporting a low grade inflammatory 
arthropathy  was  an  onset  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  one  case  of  “inflammatory  joint”  was  later 
clarified  as  chondromalacia  patellae.  The  present  data  do  not  indicate  a  direct  connection  between 
qHPV  vaccination  and  arthritis/arthropathy.  However,  as  these  conditions  may  be  considered  as 
autoimmune  reactions  continuous  close  monitoring  and  cumulative  presentation  of  such  adverse 
events should be performed and all cases should be presented and discussed in future PSURs.  
Among the systemic SAEs determined to be caused by the qHPV vaccine in the combined group and 
previously reported in MAA and Type II variations were vaginal haemorrhage and ulcerative colitis. 
However, only one case of gastroenteritis was reported as a related SAE in study 019. The possible 
mechanisms for these reactions have not been discussed. 
Adverse  experiences  recommended  for  close  monitoring  shall  be  cumulatively  reported  on  in  the 
future PSURs. All autoimmune phenomena (including ulcerative colitis) as well as the events of the 
vaginal  haemorrhage  and  gastroenteritis  should  be  closely  monitored.  Vaccine  safety  in  mid-adult 
women should be specifically addressed in future PSURs.  
Regarding  pregnancy,  close  safety  surveillance  is  continuously  ongoing  as  the  MAH  maintains 
pregnancy  registries  in  the  US,  Canada  and  France.  Nordic  countries  collect  data  on  exposures  to 
qHPV during pregnancy. Standardised incidence ratio on congenital anomalies will be calculated by 
comparing  the  observed  and  expected  cases  of  congenital  anomaly  in  women  with  inadvertent 
exposure to qHPV vaccine during pregnancy.  
Studies in HIV infected children and adults are ongoing. 
In conclusion, there was no new significant safety signal identified associated with the administration 
of the qHPV vaccine in mid-adult women in study 019, nor in the combined protocols safety analyses.  
1.5 
Pharmacovigilance system 
1.5.1  Risk Management Plan 
The MAH was requested by the CHMP to commit to perform long-term PMS surveillance in MAW. 
The MAH committed to provide the study synopsis and to submit the study protocol. 
A sentinel cohort of Protocol 019 participants is considered the best option for conducting long-term 
post-marketing surveillance in a cohort that has been vaccinated some years ago. 
The CHMP acknowledged that this cohort study is the most relevant for follow-up of qHPV vaccine 
efficacy and immunogenicity. 
The MAH committed to provide a revised RMP in December 2009. 
In addition, there is a need to have an appropriate safety follow-up in the EU for the MAW population. 
Therefore, the MAH should continuously and cumulatively  report vaccine  safety in older  women in 
future PSURs (see follow up measures).

Overall discussion and benefit-risk assessment 
Efficacy 
The claim of efficacy in MAW is based on one randomized controlled phase III efficacy trial (Protocol 
019)  including  3819  healthy  sexually  active  24-  to  45-year  old  women.  The  median  duration  of 
follow-up for this study was 2.2 years. The main goal was to provide data to support that efficacy was 
comparable to that shown in young adult women (YAW). The MAH applied to extend the indication 
to  MAW,  including  a  statement  in  the  indication  that  efficacy  against  premalignant  genital  lesions, 
cervical cancer and genital warts has been demonstrated in women up to the age of 45 years. Study 
019  was  designed  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  in  MAW  with  respect  to  the  composite  co-primary 
endpoints of HPV 6/11/16/18- and HPV 16/18-related persistent infection and clinical disease (CIN, 
AIS and EGLs) and one secondary endpoint HPV 6/11-related persistent infection and clinical disease. 
The scientific basis for these endpoints constituted the natural history of HPV and the results of the 
clinical  program  in  YAW.  The  original  licensure  of  the  qHPV  vaccine  in  YAW  was  based  on 
histologically-confirmed efficacy endpoints, i.e. HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 and AIS, as surrogates for 
cervical cancer, whereas in P019 a virological endpoint, persistent infection (6-month) was used. The 
primary efficacy population (PPE) (HPV naïve) was defined similarly to that in all previous studies in 
YAW.  Two  further  populations  were  defined  that  resembled  the  MITT-2  and  MITT-3  populations 
used  in  the  YAW  studies:  the  HNRT  and  FAS  population,  respectively,  The  FAS  (ITT)  population 
included all women enrolled in the trial regardless of Day 1 HPV status, i.e. also those already infected 
or  with  clinical  disease  at  baseline.  No  prescreening  for  HPV  status  was  performed  before  study 
enrollment. At baseline 67% of MAW subjects were HPV naïve and, thus, susceptible to all 4 vaccine 
HPV types at study entry. Approximately 8% of MAW were infected (HPV DNA positive) with HPV 
6, 11, 16 and/or HPV 18 at baseline.  
In  the  HPV  naïve  PPE  population  vaccine  efficacy  was  90.5%  (95%  CI:  73.7,  97.5)  against  HPV 
6/11/16/18-related  persistent  infection  (PI)/disease,  83.1%  (50.6,  95.8)  against  HPV  16/18-related 
PI/disease and 100% (79.0, 100) against HPV 6/11-related PI/disease. Efficacy against CIN 2/3 could 
not be shown in the PPE population due to few cases (1 vs. 4 placebo cases) (VE: 75.2% (95% CI -
150.6, 99.5).  In the HNRT population vaccine efficacy was lower 74.6% (58.1, 85.3), 71.6% (47.6, 
85.5)  and  80.2%  (51.7,  93.3),  respectively.  Although  P019  was  not  powered  for  disease  endpoints 
(CIN 2/3), efficacy was only 25%, in the HNRT population with 3 cases in the vaccine group and 4 
cases  in  the  placebo  group.  In  the  FAS  (ITT)  population,  very  low  efficacy  was  noted  for  the  HPV 
6/11/16/18-related  PI/disease  endpoint  (VE:  30.9%  (11.1,  46.5)  and  for  the  more  important  HPV 
16/18-related  PI/disease  endpoint  only  nominal  reductions  were  seen  (VE:  22.6%  (-2.9,  41.9). 
Efficacy  for  the  HPV  6/11-related  endpoint  was  47.1%  (11.4,  69.2).  With  respect  to  vaccine  HPV 
type-related  CIN  2/3,  no  efficacy  at  all  was  observed,  not  even  a  trend  (VE;  9.9%).  The  number  of 
cases in the vaccine group was the same as in the placebo group. 
In  the  initial  assessment  of  this  type  II  variation,  two  major  objections  were  identified.  The  first 
objection concerned the indication of the qHPV vaccine, which covers all women regardless of HPV 
status and therefore the ITT (FAS) population was considered the most representative population for 
MAW. The primary efficacy population, the HPV naïve (PPE) population does not reflect the general 
population of MAW that will be vaccinated in clinical practice. The poor efficacy results observed in 
the FAS population did not support the MAH´s proposal to include a statement in the indication that 
efficacy had been demonstrated in 27-45 year old women. A second objection (safety) was also raised 
with  respect  to  the  results  observed  in  the  PCR  positive/seronegative  subpopulation  suggesting  a 
negative impact of the vaccine on on-going HPV infection/disease. In addition, several other concerns 
were raised in the RSI. 
In the MAH´s response to the CHMP´s first Request for Supplementary Information the CHMP agreed 
that  for  demonstration  of  prophylactic  efficacy,  the  PPE  population  is  the  optimal  population.  The 
results in study 019 showed significant efficacy in HPV naïve MAW and in similar magnitude as that 
shown  in  young  adult  women.  However,  this  target  HPV  naïve  population  is  difficult  to  identify 
among sexually experienced MAW and many non-naïve women will be vaccinated without deriving 
37/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
little if any benefit. Therefore, the CHMP considered critical that the SPC and PI make it very clear to 
the  prescribers  and  patients  that  efficacy  cannot  be  expected  in  non-naïve  women.  In  the  indication 
referral should be made to section 4.4 (and section 5.1) where it should be stated that the vaccine is for 
prophylactic  use  only  and  that  the  vaccine  is  not  effective  against  already  established  HPV 
infection/disease  prior  to  vaccination.  Furthermore,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  all  possible 
tools on which to select the target population and to discuss the possibility and usefulness of screening 
for HPV DNA status prior to vaccination. 
With  respect  to  the  safety  objection  the  MAH  performed  re-analyses  and  complementary  analyses. 
Overall, the most significant finding was the inconsistent results observed in the PCR positive group 
depending on its serostatus, which would not be expected, other than as a result of multiple analyses of 
subgroups with small sample size. Importantly it is difficult to hypothesize a plausible mechanism for 
a  negative  effect  of  the  vaccine  on  on-going  HPV  infections.  In  addition,  the  life  table  analysis  of 
time-to-clearance  of  HPV  6  and  HPV  16  infection  showed  no  conspicuous  difference  between  the 
vaccine and placebo groups. The “similar“ findings in the young adult women as regards HPV 16/18-
related CIN 2/3 in study 013 seemed to be an isolated event only seen in one study and one subset of 
the Day 1 PCR positive population and did not extend to the MAW population. It was concluded that 
the  overall  pattern  was  not  consistent  with  a  negative  impact  of  the  vaccine  on  prevalent  HPV 
infections. 
The  issue  whether  the  vaccine  has  a  negative  impact  accelerating  disease  progression  was  further 
investigated in the FAS population. Data on the cumulative incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN 
2/3 was lower in the vaccine group than in the  placebo group suggesting no acceleration of vaccine 
HPV type-related disease progression. In contrast, the opposite pattern was shown for CIN 2/3 due to 
any HPV type with higher incidence and a steeper curve by time in the vaccine group. This increase in 
the  vaccine  group  could  indicate  the  occurrence  of  type  replacement  disease.  The  findings  raised 
major  objections  and  the  MAH  was  requested  to  scrutinise  all  relevant  data  and  to  perform  formal 
statistical analyses to clarify this issue. 
In  the  MAH´s  response  to  the  CHMP´s  second  Request  for  Supplementary  Information,  the  major 
objection was only partly resolved. The higher incidence of CIN 2/3 or worse related to any HPV type 
in the qHPV vaccine group compared with the placebo group could be likely attributed to the baseline 
imbalance in prevalent infection related to non-vaccine HPV types. The data did not lend support to 
the  hypothesis  that  the  qHPV  vaccine  accelerates  progression  of  disease.  However,  further  analysis 
was requested as regards non-vaccine HPV types to fully clarify this issue. The results did not suggest 
type replacement disease due to the qHPV vaccine, but this issue needs to be closely monitored on a 
longer-term basis. 
In response to the `other concerns´ it became clear that the MAH has no valid data to support the use 
of persistent infection related to HPV 6/11 as an efficacy endpoint. Therefore the MAH was requested 
to  re-analyse  results  obtained  in  study  019  excluding  all  data  on  the  HPV  6/11-related  persistent 
infection. 
Based  on  recent  data,  including  the  Koshiol  et  al  meta  analysis,  persistent  infection  of  12  months 
duration appears to be the most valid endpoint to be used in clinical trials as a surrogate marker for 
cervical cancer. The MAH was further requested to address this issue and to provide available P019 
data on 12 month persistent infection related to HPV 16/18. 
The MAH´s evaluation of usefulness of possible pre-screening approaches of HPV status gave meagre 
positive incremental yield with respect to identifying women who would benefit from vaccination with 
the  qHPV  vaccine.  The  MAH  was  requested  to  address  the  issue  of  HPV  vaccination  resulting  in 
missed  cancers  in  mid-adult  women  due  to  false  security  of  being  protected  against  cervical  cancer 
and  subsequent  failing  attendance  to  the  routine  cervical  screening.  At  the  present  time,  with  the 
increasing use of HPV assays it is not unreasonable that genotyping could be used as a pre-screening 
tool  before  vaccination  of  women  above  30  years  of  age  in  countries  where  validated  type-specific 
HPV  techniques  are  available,  to  target  vaccination  to  HPV  16/18  naïve  MAW.  The  MAH  was 
requested to address this issue. 
The CHMP considered that efficacy has to be shown in the total population or it has to be possible to 
define  the  population  which  benefits  in  clinical  practice.  No  efficacy  was  shown  in  the  general 
population  and  pre-screening  will  be  apparently  a  difficult  option  in  clinical  practice.  Furthermore 
38/43 
 
 
 
vaccination of women who do not benefit is not acceptable and might lead to a false sense of security. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered that the indication should not be changed. CHMP recommended to 
revise  sections  4.4  and  5.1  of  the  SPC  to  inform  prescribers  of  the  study  results  and  that  the  use  of 
Gardasil  in  adult  women  should  take  into  consideration  the  variability  of  HPV  type  prevalence  in 
different  geographical  areas  in  the  general  population  of  24-  to  45-year-old  women,  and  that  no 
significant  efficacy  against  HPV  16/18-related  persistent  infection  and  clinical  disease  has  been 
demonstrated.  The  decision  to  vaccinate  an  individual  woman  24-45  years  old  should  take  into 
account her risk for previous HPV exposure and her potential benefit from vaccination. The SPC was 
also revised to inform that Gardasil is not effective in women already infected/diseased at the start of 
vaccination. 
In  the  MAH´s  response  to  the  CHMP´s  third  Request  for  Supplementary  Information,  the  major 
objection was resolved with the submission of supplementary data on cumulative incidence of CIN2/3 
or worse related to 10 non-vaccine HPV types in women who were PCR positive to the relevant HPV 
type at Day 1. These results do not suggest a clinically significant acceleration of disease progression 
in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group, however this issue will be readdressed at end of 
study,  month  48  results.  The  issue  of  pre-screening  of  women  >30  years  of  age  for  HPV16/18 
positivity prior to vaccination was resolved, since the low prevalence of these types (<2.6%) in older 
women  makes  this  strategy  highly  cost-ineffective.  The  SPC  already  gives  a  clear  message  that 
continued attendance of cervical screening programs is critical. Furthermore, several paragraphs have 
been  amended  informing  the  prescribers  that  the  qHPV  vaccine  is  for  prophylactic  use  only,  that 
prevalence  of  HPV  types  and  the  women´s  risk  for  previous  HPV  exposure  should  be  taken  into 
account in the decision to vaccinate mid-adult women. In addition, the indication remains unchanged 
and states that efficacy has only been demonstrated in young women16 to 26 years of age. The CHMP 
considers these measures provide the necessary relevant information to prescribers. The reanalysis of 
the  results  of  study  P019  excluding  the  data  on  HPV  6/11  persistent  infection  showed  that  efficacy 
estimates  decreased  in  the  combined  primary  endpoint  from  90.5%  to  86.0%.  Although  the  large 
Koshiol meta-analysis has some limitations, data on the natural course of HPV disease suggest that the 
12-month persistent infection is a more reliable and robust predictor of progression to CIN 2/3+ than 
the 6-month persistent infection. Therefore in future study reports, the CHMP considered that data on 
12 month persistent infection should also be included. The results of the analyses of study 019 using a 
12  month  persistent  infection  showed  that  efficacy  estimates  against  HPV  16/18-related  persistent 
infection and against the combined primary endpoint were in the same order of magnitude, although 
with wider confidence intervals, as the results of the analyses using the 6-month persistent infection. 
Overall,  the  CHMP  considered  that  efficacy  has  to  be  shown  in  the  total  population  or  it  has  to  be 
possible to define the population which benefits in clinical practice. Since no statistically significant 
efficacy  was  shown  in  the  general  population  and  pre-screening  will  be  a  difficult  option  in  clinical 
practice,  the  CHMP  did  not  endorse  the  MAH´s  extension  of  indication  to  include  a  statement  in 
section  4.1  of  the  SPC  that  efficacy  had  been  demonstrated  in  27-45  year  old  women.  With  the 
indication  remaining  unchanged  and  with  the  SPC  revisions  reflecting  the  results  of  study  019  and 
providing the relevant information to prescribers to decide on the vaccination of individual woman 27 
to 45 years old the CHMP considered that the major objections were resolved, 
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity data in study 019 showed that the vaccine-induced immune responses in MAW 
were  inferior  to  those  observed  in  adolescents  and  young  women,  with  a  2  to  3  fold  lower  GMTs 
postdose 3 in MAW. The low Month 24 GMTs and seropositivity rate for HPV 18 raise concern. The 
consequence of these lower antibody responses in the MAW population for the durability of vaccine 
efficacy is not known, since no immunological correlate of protection has been defined. Among MAW 
who were seropositive to vaccine HPV types at Day 1, vaccine induced immune response to the types 
for which they were positive were comparable to those observed among YAW who were seropositive 
to the same type at Day 1. These results suggest  that adult women can mount anamnestic responses 
that  appear  as  robust  as  those  observed  in  YAW.    Such  anamnestic  responses  are  critical  to  the 
durability  of  the  efficacy  of  vaccines  in  general,  but  whether  the  immune  memory  induced  by  the 
qHPV  vaccine  will  be  sufficient  to  protect  against  HPV  infection  in  subjects  who  have  lost 
seropositivity, remains to be shown. At the current stage after a relatively short duration of follow-up 
39/43 
 
 
 
(2.2 years), no obvious breakthrough infections in study 019 have been documented. However, long-
term follow-up of efficacy and immunogenicity in MAW is mandatory. The MAH has committed to 
conduct  a  long-term  follow-up  study  of  immunogenicity  and  vaccine  efficacy  in  a  sentinel  cohort 
(n=1600)  in  study  019.  Furthermore,  section  (section  5.1)  of  the  SPC  was  modified  to  inform 
prescribers on results for anti-HPV 18 seropositivity. 
In  the  MAH`s  response  to  the  CHMP  Request  for  Supplementary  Information,  the  majority  of 
immunogenicity concerns were resolved. However, it was clarified that the currently used serological 
cLIA assay might not be the optimal method to measure long-term vaccine induced HPV immunity. 
This assay might be too specific measuring only antibodies against a single type-specific neutralizing 
epitope on L1 VLPs and not all relevant neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, the MAH has committed 
to perform serological studies using broader neutralization assays, i.e. pseudo-neutralization assays, as 
well as to submit the validation protocol and final results using the newly developed assay measuring 
the VLP-specific total IgG. Relevant study reports were submitted on April 28, 2009 and are currently 
under assessment.  
Safety 
According  to  the  new  information  presented  in  the  current  application  the  administration  of  qHPV 
vaccine was found to be generally well tolerated across all populations.  
The  proportions  of  subjects  who  reported  SAEs  or  who  discontinued  due  to  a  SAE  were  low  and 
comparable between the vaccination groups. Vaccine-related SAEs occurred in <1% of the subjects. 
No safety signals were identified with the exception of increased incidences of transient injection-site 
adverse experiences and low-grade fever following vaccination. Reporting adverse events was similar 
in the different age ranges except for the higher frequency of pain in the extremity in older subjects 
and  somewhat  higher  frequency  of  erythema  and  swelling  in  the  younger  age  range.  The  MAH 
proposed to delete “Injection-site bruising” from section 4.8 of the SPC since the incidence of this AE 
was shown to be low and very rarely occurring. Bruising most likely is associated with the injection 
procedure  rather  than  the  nature  of  the  injected  product  and  though  is  considered  to  be  an  adverse 
effect of vaccination. Therefore, the CHMP considers that “bruising” should remain listed in the SPC.  
The  follow-up  of  breast-fed  infants  of mothers  vaccinated  identifies  more  SAEs  in  the  qHPV  group 
compared to the placebo group. However the excess of AEs in the qHPV group was not specific and 
not considered related to vaccination. 
Use  of  qHPV  vaccine  did  not  impact  overall  pregnancy  outcomes.  Nor  did  administration  of  qHPV 
vaccine  to  nursing  mothers  affect  the  health  of  the  mother  or  the  nursing  child.  Rates  of  foetal  loss 
were slightly lower among subjects who received qHPV vaccine compared with the placebo groups. 
Slightly  more  foetuses/infants  with  congenital  anomalies  were  observed  in  subjects  who  became 
pregnant  in  the  qHPV  vaccine  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group.  However,  the  congenital 
anomalies that were observed were diverse and deemed to be highly unlikely related to the vaccine. 
In conclusion all autoimmune phenomena (including ulcerative colitis) as well as the events of vaginal 
haemorrhage  and  gastroenteritis  should  be  closely  monitored  and  cumulatively  reported  on  in  the 
future PSURs.  
The  most  frequently  reported  new  medical  condition  potentially  indicative  of  an  autoimmune 
phenomenon as well as arthritis/arthropathy in temporal relationship with qHPV should be specifically 
watched over. Furthermore, concerning pregnancy, close safety surveillance is continuously ongoing 
as  the  MAH  maintains  pregnancy  registries  in  the  US,  Canada  and  France.  Nordic  countries  collect 
data on exposures to qHPV during pregnancy. Standardised incidence ratio on congenital anomalies 
should  be  analysed  and  calculated  by  comparing  the  observed  and  expected  cases  of  congenital 
anomaly in women with inadvertent exposure to qHPV vaccine during pregnancy. 
In  conclusion,  the  benefit  risk  balance  of  Gardasil  remains  favorable  in  the  current  therapeutic 
indication,  and  the  changes  of  the  SPC  reflect  relevant  study  results  in  mid-adult  woman  for 
prescribers.

Changes to the product information 
Further to the assessment of the different proposals of the MAH to amend the Product Information and 
in the light of the assessment of the submitted data, the Product Information was revised as follows: 
SPC 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication”  
The MAH’s initially proposed to extend the age of indication for women up to 45 years old, based on 
submission of study 019. 
The claims for the requested indication were not accepted by the CHMP and were withdrawn by the 
MAH. This section remains unchanged. 
Section 4.2 “Posology and method of administration” 
The CHMP requested to replace the wording “not recommended” by “there is no experience” to better 
reflect the information on children below 9 years of age. 
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use”  
This  section  was  revised  upon  CHMP  request  to  reinforce  the  message  that  Gardasil  is  for 
prophylactic use only and has no effect on active HPV infections or established clinical disease  and to 
make  clear  that  Gardasil  does  not  prevent  lesions  due  to  a  vaccine  HPV  type  in  women  already 
infected with that HPV type at the time of vaccination. A cross reference to section 5.1 was included. 
Furthermore a paragraph was included to guide prescribers on the decision to vaccinate an individual 
woman 27 to 45 years old as follows:  
The  use  of  Gardasil  in  adult  women  should  take  into  consideration  the  variability  of  HPV  type 
prevalence  in  different  geographical  areas.    In  the  clinical  study  of  adult  women  (24  to  45  years  of 
age), no statistically significant vaccine efficacy was observed after 2.2 years of follow-up in the full 
analysis set that includes women regardless of baseline HPV status (see section 5.1). The decision to 
vaccinate an individual woman 27 to 45 years old should take into account her risk for previous HPV 
exposure and her potential benefit from vaccination. 
Section 4.5 “Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction” 
The MAH proposal to update the numbers on MAW using hormonal contraceptives was endorsed by 
the CHMP. 
Section 4.6 “Pregnancy and lactation” 
The  MAH  proposal  to  update  the  numbers  of  women  in  the  clinical  development  program  that 
reported pregnancy was endorsed by the CHMP. 
Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” 
The CHMP endorsed the update of the numbers in the safety population. 
The inclusion of the adverse reaction pain in the extremity as common was endorsed by the CHMP. 
The CHMP did not endorse the MAH proposal to delete “Injection-site bruising”. 
Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties”  
Efficacy in woman 24 through 45 years. 
The wording was revised taking into consideration the following: 
The proposed paragraph on vaccine efficacy in MAW in line with the young adult women was revised 
to mention the efficacy results in HPV naïve women and in the overall population women (ITT). The 
ITT population is the most representative population targeted in the indication. Data on efficacy 
results in the two co-primary endpoints were included of which the HPV 16/18-related infection and 
disease endpoint is considered the most important. 
. 
The number of women included in P019 was included as well as the duration of follow-up. 
41/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reference to vulvar and vaginal cancers were removed since vaccine efficacy in these cancers has not 
been demonstrated.  
Immunogenicity 
Since the CHMP considered important to inform prescribers on results for anti-HPV 18 seropositivity, 
a paragraph was introduced to include the observed reduced percentage of vaccinated individuals who 
remained seropositive (analysed per subtype) after a median follow up of 2.2 years. 
In addition, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) took the opportunity to introduce other minor 
changes to the SPC. 
PL 
The PL was updated with minor linguistic changes. 
The MAH has agreed with the changes as proposed by the CHMP. 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
On  23  July  2009  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet, based 
of the additional commitments undertaken as clarified below.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for brivaracetam, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Signal: type I hypersensitivity was identified and confirmed for Briviact during the reporting period.  
On medical review, 9 cases were suggestive for Type I hypersensitivity. Six out of the 9 cases related to 
skin manifestations (pruritus [3], erythema [1], rash[1], and urticaria [1]). The remaining cases reported 
chest discomfort, dyspnea, and flushing, respectively. Four out of the 9 cases were more suggestive that 
the cause was a Type I hypersensitivity reaction (dyspnea, pruritus (2), urticaria). The events are 
uncommon and have generally been of mild intensity.  
In the view of the data presented in this PSUR, the PRAC Rapporteur considered that changes to the 
product information of Briviact were warranted. Based on the safety review the PRAC Rapporteur 
considers that product information update is necessary in order to add safety information regarding the 
risks of type I hypersensitivity.  
In the context of the variation to the terms of the marketing authorization, additional details have added 
to the text about third BRV metabolite (hydroxy acid) presented in section 5.2 of SmPC.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.  
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s)  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for brivaracetam the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing brivaracetam is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information  
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

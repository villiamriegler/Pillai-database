The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the specific obligations and the impact of the data 
submitted by the MAH on the benefit/risk profile of the 
medicinal product, concluded that marketing authorisation 
of Upstaza should be maintained. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

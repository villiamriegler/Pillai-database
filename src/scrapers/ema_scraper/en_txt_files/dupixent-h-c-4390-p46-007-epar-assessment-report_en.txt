2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
Study number: LPS15023 
Study title: Open-label, interventional, cohort study to evaluate long-term safety of dupilumab in 
patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who completed the TRAVERSE-LTS12551 clinical trial 
Study dates: First patient enrolled: 30 August 2018, last patient completed: 18 February 2022 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
LPS15023 / Open-label, interventional, cohort study to evaluate long-term safety of 
dupilumab in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who completed the TRAVERSE-
LTS12551 clinical trial 
Description 
Study LPS15023 was a Phase 3b study, open-label, interventional, prospective, multinational, 
multicenter, noncomparative, single-arm, safety study in adult and adolescent (12 to <18 years of 
age) patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who completed the parent study LTS12551 
(TRAVERSE). The LTS12551 parent study was part of the PIP, whereas the LPS15023 study was not. 
The parent study, LTS12551, was a multinational, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study that 
evaluated the long-term safety and tolerability of dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) added on 
standard of care background controller therapy in adult and adolescent patients with asthma who had 
participated in previous dupilumab asthma studies (DRI12544, PDY14192, EFC13579, or EFC13691).

Study LPS15023 was conducted from 30 August 2018 (first patient enrolled) through 18 February 2022 
(last patient last visit), in 123 centers in Argentina, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, 
Netherlands, South Africa, and USA. The study enrolled 393 patients. 
The LPS15023 study used as a basis for clinical data presented in this dossier was conducted in 
compliance with GCP, as required by the ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. The study also 
met the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki, standard operating procedures for clinical 
investigations and documentation of the Sponsor, applicable national laws and regulations and the 
ethical principles of the Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Methods 
Study participants 
The LPS15023 study population consisted of patients with asthma who completed the treatment period 
in LTS12551. Patients were on background dose of medium or high dose ICS, as maintained during 
LTS12551, in combination with a second controller and/or oral corticosteroids for those patients from 
the original parent study EFC13691. Patients requiring a third controller medication (e.g., LABA, LTRA, 
methylxanthines) were allowed.  
Treatments 
This study evaluated the long-term safety of dupilumab with a dosing regimen of 300 mg Q2W 
administered subcutaneously (SC) until its approval for use in asthma and market availability to the 
patient, or for a maximum of 144 weeks after the start of treatment (Visit 1), whichever came first. 
Patients who had discontinued dupilumab for at least 6 weeks after completion of LTS12551 study 
were to receive a loading dose (2 injections of 300 mg) at the time of the first injection in the 
LPS15023 study.  
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of the LPS15023 study was to assess the long-term safety of dupilumab 300 mg 
Q2W administered SC over a maximum of 144 weeks from the start of the study, in the treatment of 
patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who completed the parent study. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The safety of dupilumab was evaluated based on the assessment of AEs, SAEs, and AESIs.  
The primary safety endpoint was the incidence rate of TEAEs (percentage of patients reporting any 
TEAEs), and the event rate (number of TEAE events per 100 PY).  
Secondary endpoints were AESI incidence rates and event rates, SAE and death incidence rates, and 
incidence rates for TEAEs leading to study discontinuation.  
Sample size 
No formal sample size determination was conducted. The objective of the study was to continue to 
evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of dupilumab in patients with asthma who participated in 
the previous long-term study TRAVERSE. Therefore, all qualifying patients from participating countries 
who completed the treatment period in TRAVERSE were offered to enroll in this study.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical Methods 
Continuous data was summarized using the number of available data (n), mean, standard deviation 
(SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical and ordinal data was summarized using the 
number and percentage of patients. For categorical variables, patients with missing data were not 
included in calculations of percentages unless otherwise specified. When relevant, the number of 
patients with missing data was presented. For purposes of analysis the following 2 populations are 
defined:  
Enrolled population 
The enrolled population was defined as the set of all patients who signed the ICF and had a treatment 
kit number allocated and recorded in IRT database, regardless of whether the treatment kit was used 
or not. The enrolled population was be used to summarize demographics and baseline characteristics. 
Safety population 
The primary analysis population was the safety population, defined as all patients who received at least 
one dose or part of a dose of dupilumab during this study. The treatment-emergent period was defined 
as the time from the first dose of dupilumab during LPS15023 until the last dose of dupilumab plus 2 
weeks for completers, or plus 12 weeks for prematurely discontinued patients. 
The primary and secondary analyses are safety related. All safety analyses were performed on the 
safety population. The primary focus of adverse event reporting was on TEAEs. Treatment-emergent 
AE was defined as any AE with onset on or after the first dose of dupilumab, until the last dose of 
dupilumab plus 14 days for completers, or plus 12 weeks for prematurely discontinued patients.  
If an AE date/time of onset (occurrence, worsening, or becoming serious) was incomplete, an 
imputation algorithm was used to classify the AE as pre-treatment, treatment-emergent, or post-
treatment. The algorithm for imputing date/time of onset was conservative and classified an AE as 
treatment-emergent unless there was definitive information to determine it was pre-treatment or post-
treatment. 
Adverse event incidence tables (including TEAEs, treatment-emergent SAEs and TEAEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation) were presented by System Organ Class (SOC), High-level Group Term 
(HLGT), and Preferred Term (PT), sorted in alphabetical order, the number and percentage of patients 
experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient were counted only 
once in the tables within a treatment phase. The denominator for computation of percentages was the 
safety population. 
Primary safety analysis 
The primary endpoint was analyzed through the incidence rates (defined as the percentage of patients 
reporting any TEAEs), and event rates (defined as the number of TEAE events per 100 PY). 
Incidence rates of TEAEs with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI, by the Clopper-Pearson 
method) were calculated as follows: 
• Incidence Rate = number of patients with at least one TEAE / number of patients at risk (i.e., safety 
population) × 100 
• Event rate = number of TEAEs/number of patient-years at follow-up 
Event rates per 100 person-years of TEAEs with corresponding 95% CI (two-sided exact Poisson CIs) 
were calculated. All events reported during the study follow-up period were counted, regardless of 
whether they are reported in the same patient (ie, multiple events per patients), or different patients. 
The person-years at follow-up were calculated using the standard on-treatment duration formula: 
• Date of last IMP – date of first dose of IMP + 14 days) / 365.25 
Secondary safety analysis

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/824354/2022 
Page 7/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary endpoints were analyzed through incidence rates and event rates per 100 person-years 
for AESIs over the study, incidence rates for SAEs/death over the study, and incidence rates for AEs 
leading to study discontinuation over the study. Incidence rates with corresponding 95% CI (Clopper-
Pearson method) and event rates with corresponding 95% CI (exact Poisson method) were presented 
for AESIs, using the same methodology used for the analysis of the primary safety endpoints. 
Incidence rates with corresponding 95% CI (Clopper-Pearson method) were presented for SAEs/death 
and for AEs leading to study discontinuation over the study period. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 393 patients with moderate-to-severe asthma were enrolled into the LPS15023 study and 
treated with dupilumab 300 mg Q2W. Of the 393 enrolled patients, 8/393 (2.0%) were adolescents 
(aged 12 to <18 years). 374/393 (95.2%) patients completed the study treatment, and 19/393 
(4.8%) patients discontinued treatment. All 8 adolescent patients completed the study treatment. 
Recruitment 
LPS15023 was conducted from 30 August 2018 (first patient first visit) through 18 February 2022 (last 
patient last visit), at 123 centers in 10 countries (Argentina, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, 
Israel, Japan, Netherlands, South Africa, USA). 
For all patients, there was a period between completion of LTS12551 and initiation of LPS15023, 
ranging from 13 days (1.86 weeks) to 1324 days (189.14 weeks). In addition, the duration of the 
study was variable, and patients were able to discontinue the study at the time of market availability of 
dupilumab in their respective countries.

Baseline data 
All patients were diagnosed by a physician with asthma that was present for ≥12 months, based on the 
Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines in effect at the time of the parent study initiation. 
Patients enrolled from Studies DRI12544, EFC13579, and PDY14192 had moderate-to-severe asthma, 
while those from Study EFC13691 were severe OCS-dependent asthma patients. 
Demographic characteristics 
Demographic characteristics for all patients in the enrolled population are summarized in Table 1.  
Among the 393 patients enrolled, 8/393 (2.0%) were adolescent patients (aged 12 to <18 years). The 
mean age was 52.1 years. More females than males were included (58.8% and 42.2%). The mean 
(SD) weight at baseline was 78.82 (19.59) kg. 
Overall, 136/393 (38.5%) patients had a body mass index ≥30 (kg/m2) at baseline and 45/393 
(12.5%) patients weighed ≥100 kg. 54/393 (13.7%) patients enrolled within 4 weeks after ending the 
parent study.

Adverse Events  
Adolescent population 
Of the 8 adolescents who participated in the study, 2/8 (25.0%) experienced at least 1 TEAE, none of 
which was serious or led to permanent treatment discontinuation (Table 4). No AESIs were reported in 
the adolescent population. 
The reported TEAEs in the adolescent population were erythema (reported as “redness of the ear”) in 
one patient and 2 events of injection site induration in another patient (Table 5); all 3 events were 
assessed as related to the IMP by the investigator. All events were mild and resolved without 
corrective treatment.

Overall population 
Table 6 summarises the treatment-emergent adverse events reported in the overall safety population.  
Overall, 214/393 (54.5%) patients experienced at least 1 TEAE during the LPS15023 study, 22/393 
(5.6%) patients experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE, including 5/393 (1.3%) patients who 
had TEAEs leading to death (COVID-19 pneumonia for 3 patients, pulmonary embolism, and 
pancreatitis), none of which being assessed as related to dupilumab. 6/393 (1.5%) patients had TEAEs 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. In addition, 24/393 (6.1%) patients experienced 
AESIs, and the exposure-adjusted event rate of AESIs was 6.0 per 100 PY. 
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of patients with at least 1 TEAE observed in the LPS15023 study 
was lower (49.6 per 100 PY) compared to that observed in the parent LTS12551study (137.4 and 
129.9 per 100 PY for non-OCS dependent patients and OCS-dependent patients, respectively). 
The Infections and infestations SOC had the highest proportion of patients with TEAEs (33.1%).

Table 6 Overview of Adverse Event Profile: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
(Safety population) 
The most frequently reported TEAEs at PT level (at least 5% of patients) were asthma (13.7%), 
nasopharyngitis (8.4%), and COVID-19 (6.4%).  
Deaths 
Adolescent population 
In the adolescent population, no TEAEs leading to death were reported. 
Overall population 
5/393 (1.3%) patients experienced TEAEs leading to death; none of them were assessed as related to 
the IMP. 
• 3 patients had fatal TEAEs of COVID-19 pneumonia. 
• 1 patient had a fatal TEAE of pancreatitis. 
• and 1 patient had a fatal TEAE of pulmonary embolism.  
Serious adverse events 
Adolescent population 
In the adolescent population, no treatment-emergent SAEs were reported including no cases of COVID-
19. 
Overall population 
Overall, 22/393 (5.6%) patients experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE during the study. 
None of them were assessed as related to the IMP by the Investigator. 
The most frequently reported treatment-emergent SAEs (PT), that occurred in at least 2 (0.5%) 
patients, were asthma (1.0%), and COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia (0.8% each). 
The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of patients with at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE observed in 
the LPS15023 study was lower (5.1 per 100 PY) compared to that observed in the parent LTS12551

study (6.5 and 9.0 per 100 PY for non-OCS dependent patients and OCS-dependent patients, 
respectively). 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation of the study drug 
Adolescent population 
In the adolescent population, no TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were reported. 
Overall population 
A total of 6/393 (1.5%) patients had TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation, including 
the 5 patients mentioned in Table 11 and one additional patient who had his study treatment 
discontinued due to a fatal TEAE of pulmonary embolism but had not discontinued treatment at the 
time of the event, thereby resulting in this AE not having been recorded as a TEAE that led to 
treatment or study discontinuation. TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation consisted of 
fatal COVID-19 pneumonia (3 patients), fatal pancreatitis (1 patient), fatal pulmonary embolism (1 
patient), and pregnancy (1 patient). 
The exposure-adjusted incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was low 
(1.2 per 100 PY) (Table 9) and consistent with that observed in the parent LTS12551 study  (1.9 and 
3.5 per 100 PY for non-OCS dependent patients and OCS-dependent patients, respectively). 
Adverse events of special interest 
Adolescent population 
In the adolescent population, no AESIs were reported. 
Overall population 
Overall, 24/393 (6.1%) patients experienced at least 1 AESI during the study. The exposure-adjusted 
event rate of AESIs was 6.0 per 100 PY. 
One patient experienced anaphylactic reaction (angioedema of the lips and diffuse bronchospasm), 
reported by the Investigator as ‘anaphylaxis secondary to brufen’ (known hypersensitivity), that 
occurred on Day 704 and that resolved on the same day.  
A total of 22/393 (5.6%) patients reported infections considered as AESIs (ie, any serious infection, 
any bacterial infection requiring treatment with parenteral antibiotics for longer than 2 weeks, any 
parasitic infection, any systemic opportunistic infection, any viral infection requiring antiviral 
treatment, or any uncommon, atypical, or unusually frequent or persistent infection and TB that 
required anti-TB medication). The most frequently reported infections were viral infectious disorders, 
reported in a total of 19 patients, and included influenza (7 patients), COVID-19 (2 patients), COVID-
19 pneumonia (3 patients), herpes zoster and oral herpes (3 patients each), and viral upper 
respiratory tract infection (1 patient). 
A 35-year-old female patient had a positive pregnancy test on Day 27. Study treatment was 
permanently discontinued as a result of the pregnancy.  
No injection site reactions that were severe and lasted longer than 24 hours were reported during the 
study. No symptomatic overdoses were reported during the study. 
Clinical laboratory data 
Clinical laboratory data were limited to hematology parameters and only clinically significant abnormal 
values were reported. None of these abnormal values were reported in the adolescent population. 
OVERDOSE 
There were no symptomatic overdoses reported during the LPS15023 study.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted paediatric safety data that were collected in the completed phase 3b study 
LPS15023. This study included 8 adolescent and 385 adult patients who had previously participated in 
the ‘TRAVERSE’ study (LTS12551), an open-label extension study investigating the long-term safety 
and efficacy of 300 mg dupilumab Q2W added on standard of care background controller therapy in 
patients with moderate-to-severe or oral-corticosteroid-dependent severe asthma up to 96 weeks.  
Study LPS15023 was an open-label, single-arm study that further investigated the safety and 
tolerability of dupilumab 300 mg Q2W SC of patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who completed 
the previous asthma clinical trial for a maximum of 144 weeks or until market availability in the 
respective country. The safety analysis is based on the reported TEAEs and clinical laboratory data of 
the safety population defined as all patients who received at least one dose or part of a dose of 
dupilumab during this study.  
The primary endpoint was the incidence rates, defined as the percentage of patients reporting any 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and event rates, i.e. number of events per 100 patient-
years (PY). As secondary endpoints, incidence rates for AESI as well as incidence rates for SAEs/death 
and for TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were evaluated. 
The applied statistical methods are considered adequate. The overall treatment adherence was very 
good as all adolescent patients completed the study treatment. As the study was conducted across ten 
countries, the different local approval dates are likely to have caused a highly variable duration of 
study treatment; however, the cumulative treatment duration was >96 days for 88.5% and >670 days 
for 31% of the participants, with an overall exposure of 432 PY, thus providing a sufficient extent of 
exposure to assess the safety of long-term use in the overall study population. However, the minority 
of study participants were adolescent patients, their cumulative exposure is only 8.6 PY. The 
assessment of their safety data has therefore descriptive character.  
Of the enrolled and treated adolescent patients, 2 (25%) experienced 3 mild treatment-emergent 
adverse events (erythema and injection-site reaction), no further adverse events were reported; 
adolescents had a more favourable outcome compared with the adult population participating in this 
study and results are consistent with the hitherto known safety profile in the paediatric population; 
however, numbers are very limited to draw conclusions on the safety profile of the paediatric patients 
included in this study.  
No new information related to pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity or efficacy of 
dupilumab are available from the LPS15023 study. 
The overall AE profile was consistent with that observed in the LTS12551 study. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The study results suggest that the safety profile of dupilumab 300 mg Q2W administered for 
up to 144 weeks was consistent with the safety profile observed in the parent studies and no 
additional ADRs were identified.

variations to the granting a marketing authorisation of Vihuma on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The MAH has submitted a grouping application for Vihuma (EU/1/16/1168/001-004) including an 
extension application, two Type II variations and one Type IB variation. The MAH wants to align the 
dossier and the product information of Vihuma to the dossier and product information of Nuwiq 
(EU/1/14/936/001-007), which is the reference product of Vihuma. 
The following changes are included in this grouped extension application of Vihuma X/06/G: 
1)  Extension application - Item 1:  
 reference is made to NUWIQ/X/20 
Introduction of new product strengths: 2500 IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU 
2)  Type II Variation (Type II, C.I.4) - Item 2:  
reference is made to NUWIQ/II/17/G 
Update of the Product Information (sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1) and of the RMP (version 10) with data from 
Previously Untreated Patients (PUP) from GENA-05 (interim study report).The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the 
Product Information throughout to bring it in line with the Core summary of product characteristics for 
human plasma-derived and recombinant coagulation factor VIII products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/1619/1999 
rev. 2) and with the QRD version 10 (affects labelling only). 
EMA/CHMP/799360/2018  
Page 5/20 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
3)  Type II Variation (Type II, C.I.11) - Item 3: 
Reference is made to NUWIQ/II/17/G 
Submission of an updated Risk Management Plan (version 10) to align the content in a single harmonised 
worldwide version for simocotocg alfa (rFVIII) 
4)  Type IB Variation (Type IB, C.I.1b) - Item 4: 
 reference is made to Art. 31 Referral (EMEA/H/A-31/1448) 
Update of Product Information to implement the wording agreed in the Article 31 referral 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1448). At time of initiation of the referral, Vihuma was not approved and thus was not 
within the scope of the referral.  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia A is a rare and serious, X-linked, recessive bleeding disorder that predominantly affects 
males and is characterized by a deficiency of FVIII. In patients with haemophilia A, the primary 
platelet-driven hemostasis is not affected, but generation of a stable, fibrin-rich clot is defective because 
inadequate amounts of thrombin are generated. Affected patients suffer from both spontaneous, 
non-traumatic bleeding episodes as well as substantially prolonged bleeding episodes upon injury. Rarely, 
life-threatening bleeding may also occur. Patients exhibit variable clinical phenotypes depending on the 
extent of residual activity (%) of the deficient FVIII that is used to classify the disease severity (WFH, 
2012): 
• 
• 
• 
<1% FVIII activity: severe haemophilia A 
1% to 5% FVIII activity: moderate haemophilia A 
5% to 40% FVIII activity: mild haemophilia A 
Patients with severe haemophilia A bleed spontaneously into joints and muscles, which often results in 
permanent, disabling joint damage. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The overall reported number of haemophilia A patients estimated in the 2013 survey by the World 
Federation of Haemophilia (WFH) included 107 countries with a total population of 6,461,067,861 and 
identified 140,313 people with haemophilia A (2.2 per 100,000 individuals). There are currently 
approximately 30,000 patients in the EU with a mean prevalence of approximately 0.6 patients per 
10,000. 
Haemophilia A is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait and the main risk factors are therefore family 
history and a carrier mother. Approximately 30% of patients have no family history of the disease; their 
disease is presumably caused by new mutations. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von Willebrand 
factor) with different physiological functions. When infused into a haemophiliac patient, factor VIII binds 
to von Willebrand factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a cofactor for activated 
factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X. Activated factor X converts 
prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
EMA/CHMP/799360/2018  
Page 6/20 
 
 
  
 
 
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Haemophilia A manifests as profuse bleeding into the joints and muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as the result of accidental or surgical trauma. Recurrent joint bleeding can lead to 
chronic arthropathy, pain, and loss of function (Bolton-Maggs and Pasi, 2003). The majority of bleeding 
occurs internally into joints, most commonly hinged joints such as the ankles, knees, and elbows. Serious 
bleeds also occur in muscles, especially in deep compartments such as the iliopsoas, calf and forearm, 
and in the mucous membranes in the mouth, gums, nose, and genitourinary tract. Less frequently, life 
threatening bleeds can occur in or around vital areas or organs such as the gastrointestinal system or 
enclosed areas like the intracranial or intracerebral spaces. The approximate frequencies of bleeds at the 
different sites are: 70 to 80% in joints (haemarthrosis), 10 to 20% in muscle, 5 to 10% in the central 
nervous system, and < 5% for bleeds at all other sites (Srivastava et al., 2013). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Standard treatment for haemophilia A patients is the replacement of the missing protein by infusion of 
exogenous FVIII concentrates (as plasma-derived FVIII [pdFVIII] or recombinant FVIII [rFVIII] 
concentrates). Treatment regimens are either on-demand therapy (given when a bleed occurs) or 
prophylaxis (which consists of regular infusion of FVIII given every 2 to 3 days to prevent bleeding). In 
the short term, prophylaxis can prevent spontaneous bleeding and in the long term, prophylaxis can 
prevent bleeding into joints that will eventually lead to debilitating arthropathy. 
Prior to the introduction of clotting factor concentrates in the 1960s, the prognosis for haemophilia A 
patients was poor, average life expectancy being 15 to 25 years. Major advances in the safety of clotting 
factor products, including the availability of rFVIII concentrates, the availability of comprehensive 
haemophilia A treatment centres, the institution of routine prophylaxis, the introduction of home 
treatment, as well as the active roles that patients take in self-advocacy, have enabled patients with 
haemophilia A to lead a “close to normal” life. 
About the product 
Vihuma is a duplicate of NUWIQ which was authorised via centralised procedure on 22. July 
2014. 
Vihuma 250 IU/500 IU/1000 IU/2000 IU were approved in Europe via informed consent application on 
13.February 2017.  
The active substance of Vihuma is simoctocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII). Vihuma is produced 
by recombinant DNA technology in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F cells. 
Vihuma is a white sterile lyophilized powder and solvent for solution for injection. The lyophilized powder 
is supplied in single-dose vials containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU (2500 IU, 3000 IU or 4000 IU) 
of recombinant factor VIII per vial. Before use, the lyophilized powder is reconstituted with a single-dose 
solvent pre-filled syringe containing 2.5 mL of sterilised water for injections. The reconstituted solution is 
a clear, colourless solution, practically free from visible particles, containing 100 IU / 200 IU / 400 IU / 
800 IU (1000 IU / 1200 IU / 1600 IU) FVIII:C/mL.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The extension application is based on quality data and on non-clinical local tolerance data. 
The non-clinical data package comprising of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data has 
been assessed in the course of the marketing authorisation procedure and is still applicable for the current 
extension procedure.  
Therefore, only new local tolerance study of four Vihuma strengths following a single perivenous 
administration in rabbits was performed as part of this application. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Vihuma is a duplicate of Nuwiq. With this submission, it is intended to align the Vihuma 
marketing authorisation with the marketing authorisation for Nuwiq, as currently approved. 
The changes included in this line extension application are identical to those implemented for 
Nuwiq (EMEA/H/C/2813/X/20). The SmPC, labelling and package leaflet of Vihuma is fully 
aligned with Nuwiq. 
Vihuma is supplied as a lyophilised powder and solvent for solution for injection. The lyophilised powder 
is currently available in single-dose vials containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU and 2000 IU of recombinant 
factor VIII and is reconstituted with a single-dose solvent pre-filled syringe containing 2.5 mL of sterile 
water for injections (WfI). With this line extension application the marketing authorisation holder is 
introducing single-dose vials containing the following new strengths: 2500 IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU which 
are also reconstituted with a single-dose solvent pre-filled syringe containing 2.5 mL of sterile water for 
injections. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance of Vihuma is simoctocog alfa, a B-domain deleted human coagulation factor VIII 
produced by recombinant DNA technology in genetically modified human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F 
cells (human cell line rhFVIII). 
The cell line has been adapted to grow in a defined medium free from animal derived compounds. The 
harvested product is concentrated and purified by a series of chromatography steps, which also include 
solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment for virus inactivation/removal. Moreover, the reduced molecular size 
of the B-domain deleted rFVIII molecule allowed the introduction of nanofiltration as a second virus 
reduction step within the active substance purification process. No animal or human derived materials are 
added during the manufacturing process or to the final medicinal product. 
EMA/CHMP/799360/2018  
Page 8/20 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Compared to the currently licensed strengths (250 IU, 500 IU, 100 IU and 2000 IU), the intended higher 
strengths of 2500 IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU are manufactured identically up to and including the active 
substance (AS) level. There are no changes to the manufacture of the active substance. Changes to the 
3.2.S. section of the dossier are related to some analytical methods which needed adaptation of e.g. 
dilutions due to the higher BDD-rFVIII concentrations and to the section Characterisation (3.2.S.3) in 
which results of comparability studies with respect to biological activity, physico-chemical characteristics 
as well as the impurity profile have been provided. These studies are presented and discussed in the 
finished product section below.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Vihuma finished product is a white sterile lyophilised powder and solvent for solution for injection. The 
lyophilised powder is supplied in single-dose vials containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU, 2500 IU, 
3000 IU and 4000 IU of recombinant factor VIII per vial. The finished product is formulated with sodium 
chloride, sucrose, calcium chloride dihydrate, arginine hydrochloride, sodium citrate dihydrate, 
poloxamer 188. Before use, the lyophilised powder is reconstituted with a single-dose solvent pre-filled 
syringe containing 2.5 mL of sterilised water for injections. The reconstituted solution is a clear, colourless 
solution, practically free from visible particles containing 100 IU / 200 IU / 400 IU / 800 IU / 1000 IU / 
1200 IU / 1600 IU FVIII:C/mL. The concentration of each of the excipients is the same for all strengths, 
only the recombinant FVIII concentration varies. All excipients are of Ph. Eur. quality.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
Commercial production of Vihuma active substance was initially performed and validated in a bioreactor 
scale production line. Commercial Vihuma finished product is produced at the pharmaceutical production 
line. The production process of Vihuma was presented within the initial marketing authorisation 
application (MAA). 
Subsequently, the production process of Vihuma has been scaled up, “Bio1”, with resulting larger scale 
purification to active substance (AS) and commercial pharmaceutical production of finished product (FP) 
in a new pharmaceutical line for filling of small volume parenterals (SVP) hereafter referred to as “Bio1 DP 
(SVP)”. 
This line extension applies for the addition of the new product strengths of 2500 IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU 
in addition to the currently approved product strengths 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU. Concerning the 
line extension, a Process validation (PV) has been performed for these new Vihuma strengths in Bio1 DP 
SVP. 
In relation to pharmaceutical development compatibility of Vihuma finished product new strengths with 
the components used for reconstitution and injection of the product, including the 2.5 mL sterilized water 
for injections in a prefilled syringe was shown in study OC16-0517 and revealed no concerns regarding 
compatibility of Vihuma new strengths with reconstitution and injection devices. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process of Vihuma finished product Bio1 DP SVP is identical compared to the approved 
manufacturing process. The “Method of Preparation” was updated with strength-specific details to include 
EMA/CHMP/799360/2018  
Page 9/20 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
the new product strengths of 2500 IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU. The in-process controls and the control of 
critical steps have not been affected.  
One batch of finished product is defined as containing 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU, 2000 IU, 2500 IU, 3000 
IU or 4000 IU Vihuma per vial, corresponding to approximately 1-36 Mio IU Factor VIII.  
Process validation 
Process validation was performed for the pharmaceutical production of Vihuma new product strengths 
from thawing and pooling of active substance to final container finished product in the SVP production 
line.  
Process validation included five finished product batches using a bracketing approach covering all three 
strengths, minimum and maximum batch sizes and all identical freeze-dryers. Maximum hold times were 
challenged for one batch of each strength. Process control parameters and quality attributes determined 
at each manufacturing step were within acceptance criteria and comparable to ranges observed for Bio1 
process validation batches of Vihuma 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 IU.  
Product specification 
Specifications of Vihuma finished product are unchanged except the strength-specific parameter potency 
and total protein.  
Due to the new strengths and higher protein concentrations the test methods electrophoretic 
examination, factor VIII chromogenic test and molecular size distribution and the validations for 
endotoxin, sterility and molecular size distribution were adequately updated.  
Batch release testing results confirmed the consistent manufacture of batches of the new strengths within 
specifications.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data for 5 batches Vihuma (1x 2500 IU/vial, 1x 3000 IU/vial and 3x 4000 IU/vial) as well as 12 
months for 1 batch (1x 4000 IU/vial) for storage at 5°C have been provided in compliance with ICH Q5C. 
Stability at 25°C is completed for all 5 batches. Three batches, one of each strength, were also stored at 
30°C for 6 months. Reconstitution studies were performed on one batch of the respective strength 2500 
IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU and covered 12 months storage at 5°C followed by reconstitution and storage at 
25°C up to 24 hours. 
Photo stability studies indicated a slight loss in FVIII potency and specific activity, when stored under 
light, requiring storage of the vials protected from light. A respective statement is included in the product 
information. 
Parameters tested are appearance, visual inspection of solution, solubility, pH value, FVIII:C, total 
protein, specific FVIII:C activity, retention times and molecular size distribution by size-exclusion high 
performance liquid chromatography (SEC-HPLC), electrophoretic examination by sodium dodecyl sulfate 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), osmolality, water content, integrity testing by head 
space analysis, sterility, endotoxin, particulate matter and concentrations of citrate, sucrose, poloxamer 
188, sodium, calcium, chloride and arginine. 
The results generated during the stability studies support the proposed shelf life of 24 months at 2°C – 
8°C. During the shelf life, the product can be kept at room temperature (up to 25°C) for a single period 
EMA/CHMP/799360/2018  
Page 10/20 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
not exceeding 1 month. Once the product has been taken out of the refrigerator it must not be returned 
to the refrigerator. Within the proposed shelf life the finished product is stable up to 24 hours after 
reconstitution when stored at room temperature. From a microbiological point of view, the product should 
be used immediately after reconstitution. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions 
prior to use are the responsibility of the user. 
Comparability exercise for Finished Medicinal Drug Product 
Compared to the currently licensed strengths (250 IU, 500 IU, 100 IU and 2000 IU), the intended higher 
strengths of 2500 IU to 4000 IU are manufactured identically up to and including the active substance 
level. 
The higher strength vials require the processing of higher Vihuma concentrations during finished product 
manufacturing. As this process change may affect the biological activity profile of Vihuma downstream of 
the change, the biological activity of the 2500-4000 IU/vial process validation finished product batches 
were analysed in parallel to reference batches from both the original bioreactor and Bio1 DP. For the 
2500-4000 IU/vial process validation batches, all earlier process steps up to and including AS were 
already characterised previously (230CBA139/BIO1/01). 
The process validation for higher strength Vihuma comprised two independent campaigns resulting in six 
FP batches, with one 2500 IU/vial batch, one 3000 IU/vial batch, and four 4000 IU/vial batches.  
To demonstrate comparability between the new product strengths and current product strengths, 
comparability with respect to biological activity, physicochemical characterisation as well as impurity 
profile was addressed.  
Biological activity 
For evaluation of comparability with respect to biological activity the following methods were applied: 
- FVIII activity (chromogenic assay, Coatest SP FVIII kit) 
- Specific activity 
- FVIII activity/FVIII:Antigen ratio (Asserachrom VIII:Ag kit) 
- Thrombin generation 
- FXa generation 
- Interaction with Activated Protein C 
- vWF binding 
Based on the provided data for 6 batches of the new strengths and the data for 8 batches of the already 
licensed strengths, the new strengths showed comparable characteristics in all assays.  
Physico-chemical characterisation 
Physico-chemical characterisation included SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions with 
silver staining, protein chip capillary electrophoresis, intrinsic fluorescence, asymetrical flow field-flow 
fractionation and HPLC gel filtration. The data support comparability between the currently approved and 
the new Vihuma strengths regarding these parameters. 
Process related impurities 
Analysis for impurities included testing for endotoxins, sterility, host cell protein (HCP) as well as 
aggregates and degradation products. The data support comparability between the currently approved 
and the new Vihuma strengths regarding the impurity profile. 
EMA/CHMP/799360/2018  
Page 11/20 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In conclusion, comparability data provided for the addition of the 3 higher Vihuma strengths showed 
comparability with the currently licensed strengths.  
Adventitious agents 
The virus and TSE safety of human-cl rhFVIII has been sufficiently demonstrated. Human-cl rhFVIII is 
considered safe with respect to a potential transmission of TSE and viruses. There were no changes to the 
currently approved MAA for Vihuma. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
This line extension application concerns the addition of three new strengths for Vihuma (2500 IU, 3000 IU 
and 4000 IU). There are no changes to the manufacture of the active substance.  
The new strengths differ only in the amount of active substance per vial. All the other excipients have the 
same concentrations. The solvent for reconstitution (WfI) as well as the primary packaging are also 
unchanged. 
Process validation studies confirmed that the new strengths can be manufactured consistently within 
specifications. A comparability study of finished product batches with the proposed new versus the 
approved old strengths revealed comparability with respect to biological activity, physico-chemical 
characteristics and impurities. 
The stability program is in general considered satisfactory. The results generated during the stability 
studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
Sufficiently detailed data and documents have been provided indicating that the product can be 
reproducibly manufactured and is adequately controlled.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Based on the review of the quality data provided, the CHMP considers that this extension application to 
the marketing authorisation for Vihuma is approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Based on the result of a new local tolerance study performed as bridging study to assess the local 
tolerance of the new vial strengths of Vihuma, e.g. 2500 IU, 3000 IU, 4000 IU, in addition to the already 
approved strength 2000 IU, it could be concluded that perivenous injections of 0.2 mL/ear of all four 
Vihuma product strengths tested were well tolerated and did not reveal any test item-related changes at 
the injection site.  
The non-clinical data do not give rise for concern, and are considered to be adequate to support the 
comparability of the different strengths of Vihuma.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
No new clinical data have been submitted with this Extension. 
Data from Previously Untreated Patients (PUP) from GENA-05 (interim study report) are presented. 
Additionally, the MAH proposes to collect clinical safety and efficacy data on the new Vihuma product 
strengths within the frame of the non-interventional GENA-99 post-authorisation study. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Main study 
GENA-05  
Study design: 
Dosages for on-demand treatment has been chosen to target 40-60% FVIII (dose of 20-30 IU/kg) for 
minor haemorrhages, 60-80% FVIII (dosage 30-40 IU/kg) for moderate to major haemorrhages, and 
100-120% FVIII (40-60 IU/kg) for major to life-threatening haemorrhages. These target FVIII levels are 
much higher than proposed in the Core SmPC (20-40% for minor, 30-50% for more extensive, and 
60-100 for life-threatening haemorrhages). Such “high-dose-regimen” needs to be taken into account 
when evaluating the positive treatment results.  
Recovery investigation: Patients received 40 IU FVIII/kg BW for in vivo recovery evaluation. Blood 
samples were taken at baseline, 15 minutes and 1 hour after the IMP administration. Results are awaited 
in the Final Study Report and are considered to add significant information for this low age-group with 
regard to dosage recommendation. 
Demographics: About 60 study centres are involved in study GENA-05.  
Immunogenicity: 
Relevant patient numbers with respect to immunogenicity: According to the interim report, the overall 
number of subjects with at least one plasma-sample after the first ED was 85. The MAH provided an 
Interim Report on their PUP-study. Information to be included in section 5.1 of SmPC and into the EPAR 
as soon as the final study report is available in 2019 
Efficacy: 
Monthly rate of spontaneous bleeds – as evaluated according to the study protocol is a non-standardised 
parameter not in accordance with the Clinical Guideline. Bleeding rates, mainly reported as annual 
bleeding rates (ABR) are not based upon similar definitions (spontaneous bleeds, joint-bleeds, all 
bleeds?), are not based upon similar conditions (e.g. with or without the opportunity of “preventive” 
treatment), and are therefore not comparable with study-data of other replacement products. Description 
in the SmPC or EPAR is therefore not supported, currently. 
Assessment of efficacy for a bleeding episode was described to be excellent in 62.2%, good in 29.6%, 
moderate in 7.6% and none on 0.7% of BEs. Most bleeds (93.2%) resolved with 1-2 days treatment. 
Mean dose per episode per ED was 48.3 IU/kg. According to the Clinical guideline, efficacy should be 
reflected as consumption (FVIII/kg) per complete bleeding episode in on-demand patients and 
prophylaxis patients. If meaningful, stratification of different bleeding types (e.g. joint-bleeds or 
EMA/CHMP/799360/2018  
Page 13/20 
 
 
  
 
 
 
gastrointestinal bleeds) might be added. Furthermore, consumption per interval (FVIII/kg per month and 
per year) should be provided for subjects on prophylaxis and – if meaningful – for on-demand patients in 
comparison. Consumption in surgeries (Factor VIII/kg per surgical procedure) should be presented, in 
addition. As proposed for consumption in bleeding episodes, consumption in surgeries might be stratified 
(e.g. minor and major surgeries), if meaningful. The results should derive from the targeted 100 patients 
with a target of 100 EDs as awaited within the Final CSR for reflection in the EPAR. 
Safety: 
Safety-profile – as far as available at the current timepoint – does not deviate from the established profile 
known from similar FVIII concentrates. However, besides FVIII-inhibition, AEs from the “allergic” 
complex have been reported in about 20 patients. Symptoms cover rashes, skin rashes urticarial rashes, 
allergic dermatitis, wheezing, hypersensitivities, acute obstructive bronchitis etc. For further evaluation 
the MAH is asked to use an adequate search-category (e.g. Standardized MedDRA Queries “anaphylactic 
reaction” and “hypersensitivity”) and analyse reported AEs with interval from last FVIII-infusion to onset 
of respective AE. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy and safety 
No new clinical data have been submitted with this extension application which is justified by the MAH 
based on comparability data investigating the old and the new strengths and supported by the results of 
the local tolerance study. This is considered acceptable. 
The submitted documents are essentially in line with the submitted and agreed documents of the 
extension application X/20, the variation II/17/G and the Article 31 Referral for the reference product 
Nuwiq. Additionally, the MAH stated that all changes as made to Vihuma are identical to those made for 
Nuwiq. 
Therefore, the assessment of the Extension application X/20 and the variation II/17G as made for Nuwiq 
is also acceptable for Vihuma. 
The submitted product information is in line with the recommendations done by PRAC in the EMA Article 
31 Referral and with the agreed product information of Nuwiq (approved with X/20).  
Overall, all changes as made for Vihuma with this grouped extension application are identical to those 
made for Nuwiq with referenced procedures and are considered acceptable.

Conclusion 
It was concluded by the CHMP Rapporteur that this RMP version has already been considered acceptable 
for Nuwiq by the CHMP and PRAC. The objective of the current submission for Vihuma is to align the 
content in a single harmonised worldwide version for simocotocg alfa.    
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 10 is acceptable.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable as the proposed text changes are only 
minor and do not affect the readability. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Vihuma (simoctocog alfa) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 22 May 2014, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
The MAH applied for an extension application to add new strengths of 2500 IU, 3000 IU and 4000 IU, 
powder and solvent for solution for injection grouped with variations to update sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 
of the SmPC to reflect available data from Previously Untreated Patients (PUP) from GENA-05 (interim 
report) study, to update the Product Information with the wording agreed in the Art. 31 referral and finally 
to update the Risk Management Plan (version 10) to align the content in a single harmonised worldwide 
version for simocotocg alfa (rFVIII). 
EMA/CHMP/799360/2018  
Page 17/20 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
The submitted documents are essentially in line with the submitted and agreed documents of the 
extension application X/20, the variation II/17/G and the Article 31 Referral for the reference product 
Nuwiq. Additionally, the MAH stated that all changes as made to Vihuma are identical to those made for 
Nuwiq. Therefore, the assessment of the Extension application X/20 and the variation II/17G as made for 
Nuwiq is also valid for Vihuma. 
The MAH provided an Interim Report on their PUP-study. Information to be included in section 5.1 of 
SmPC and into the EPAR as soon as the final study report is available in 2019 
For adequate assessment especially of borderline or transient inhibitor cases, clinical signs of increased 
factor-consumption (dosage, number of injections), increased bleeding episodes or reduced recovery 
should be provided for the respective subjects within the final study report. Preliminary data regarding 
efficacy and safety is considered to be in line with previously collected data in children but should be 
updated, accordingly, as soon as the final study report is available. 
In general, it is recommended to await the final study report for producing reliable results regarding 
recovery, efficacy, surgery and safety. Consequently, section 4.2 has been updated and Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC has been updated to add “Hypersensitivity”. 
3.2.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Vihuma is positive for these new strengths and grouped variations.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of, Vihuma new strengths, is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency). 
Vihuma can be used for all age groups. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Vihuma subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
In addition, CHMP recommends the variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning the 
following changes:

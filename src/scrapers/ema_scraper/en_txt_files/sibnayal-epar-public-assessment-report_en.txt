2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Sibnayal (potassium citrate and potassium hydrogen carbonate) was initially proposed by the applicant 
to be indicated for the treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 6 months and older. 
dRTA is a condition characterised by a renal defect in hydrogen ion secretion (distal renal tubule 
localisation) inducing a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (blood pH ≤ 7.35) due to no urine 
acidification occurring. Usually, in non-RTA patients, blood pH is about 7.4 corresponding to a blood 
concentration of bicarbonate of 22 to 29 mmol/l. Metabolic acidosis corresponds to a blood pH below 
7.35 with a bicarbonate blood concentration lower than 22 mmol/L. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
dRTA (also known as Type 1 RTA) is a rare and severe condition. The disease can be of inherited origin 
(arising from a genetic mutation) most commonly observed in children, or of acquired origin due to an 
underlying autoimmune systemic disease, such as Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosous 
or autoimmune hepatic diseases as usually observed in adults.  
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 8/91 
 
 
 
 
Overall, dRTA occurs when the α-intercalated cells of the distal tubule fail in their homeostatic function, 
due to a defect in their primary function of proton excretion into the urine, which leads a reduced 
secretion of HCO3
H+-ATPase or AE1 transporter of the α-intercalated cells due to a genetic mutation or acquired when 
- into the blood. The disorder is either inherited when there is a primary failure of the 
such capacity is intrinsically intact but secondarily impacted. At time of the orphan designation dRTA 
was estimated to affect approximately 2.1 per 10,000 persons in the EU. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
dRTA is a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis disorder due to an insufficient renal excretion of protons 
-) into the 
(H+) by the distal segment of the renal tubule and insufficient secretion of bicarbonate (HCO3
blood, which is the most important blood acid buffer. The α-intercalated cells, which are essential to 
maintain acid-base homeostasis, fail to effectively function, which leads to urine alkalisation and blood 
acidification.  
The cellular mechanisms involved in the acid-base homeostasis by α-intercalated cells of the distal 
tubule are presented in figure below. The main pump for luminal proton secretion into the urine is an 
apical vacuolar H+-ATPase. A second ATPase, the H+/K+-ATPase, is involved to a lesser extent with 
proton urinary secretion, but its physiologic role is probably more related to potassium reabsorption 
than to acid-base homeostasis.  
Other ion movements compensate for the H+ transport in these proton-secreting cells by the extrusion 
of bicarbonate from the cell into the blood via an electroneutral mechanism involving the Cl-/HCO3
exchange pump (i.e. Anion Exchange AE1). The activity of both transporters, H+-ATPase and AE1, are 
functionally linked since their substrates (H+ and HCO3
-, respectively) are produced by the same 
- 
catalytic activity of the cytosolic carbonic anhydrase II (CA II).  
Similarly, as the effect on the Cl-/HCO3- exchange pump impacts the intracellular concentration of 
chloride (Cl-), other transporters in the α-intercalated cells of the distal tubule are also affected, 
particularly those associated with the transport of CI- into the blood. Of particular relevance are the Cl-
/K+ co-transporter (KCC4) and the Cl- transporter (ClC-Kb).

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Patients with dRTA can suffer from major biological symptoms, such as hyperchloremic metabolic 
acidosis, hypokalaemia, hypocitraturia and hypercalciuria, with a relatively high urine pH (>6.5), which 
if left untreated or poorly treated will induce several clinical consequences. 
Clinical consequences of metabolic acidosis 
Diagnosis of dRTA is often in infancy on stunted growth, on sensorineurinal hearing loss, bone 
deformities, or lithiasis, but in all cases, all have biological abnormalities. Other additional clinical 
symptoms include vomiting, diarrhoea and/or constipation, dehydration episodes, tachypnoea, loss of 
appetite and polydipsia.  
Metabolic acidosis triggers bicarbonate and phosphate efflux from the bone in an attempt to buffer the 
acid blood pH. This results in bone softening manifestations such as osteomalacia in adults and rickets 
in children, and fractures. Hypercalciuria, together with hyperphosphaturia, hypocitraturia and a high 
urine pH, promote abnormal renal calcium deposition, such as nephrocalcinosis and/or nephrolithiasis 
(more particularly, multiple and bilateral type IVa2 renal stones), both of which may result in chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) (85% stage 2-4 in adults and 35% CKD stage ≥2 in children) then end-stage 
renal disease in the long term of chronic metabolic acidosis and finally kidney transplant.  
As blood pH homeostasis is essential for the secretion of growth hormone, particularly at night when 
its secretion is maximal, metabolic acidosis also induces stunted growth in children, which will most 
often trigger a visit to the physician and a dRTA diagnosis.  
Clinical consequences of hypokalaemia 
Hypokalaemia results mostly in muscle weakness, but also in mild signs of fatigue, constipation, 
myalgia, bone pain, and even severe muscular paralysis. Hypokalaemia is present in a high proportion 
of dRTA patients (47-63%) and can even be presented as a metabolic emergency (hypokalaemic 
paralysis, metabolic coma, shock or death). 
Overall, if left untreated or mistreated, dRTA is highly debilitating as it can lead to renal function 
impairment, weaken muscle strength, affect bone structure and result in adults of short stature. 
2.1.5.  Management 
In dRTA, alkali replacement therapy is given to correct metabolic acidosis. Potassium supplements 
should also be given to maintain plasma potassium levels in the normal range as needed.  
Treatment with alkalising agents restores normal acid-base balance, prevents the consumption of the 
skeleton and muscle mass by buffering processes, and improves growth in children. In order to avoid 
formation and/or expansion of nephrocalcinosis, it is well recognised that alkali therapy should be 
initiated as early as possible, including if possible, citrate to reduce hypocitraturia. Night intakes of the 
current immediate release alkalising agents are also particularly necessary for children, since growth 
hormone is secreted mainly at night, but at physiological pH. The treatment should be maintained even 
beyond the growing period to prevent metabolic acidosis and its lifelong bone and renal consequences 
such as to reduce the risk of bone deformities, lithiasis, nephrocalcinosis and/or CKD progression.  
In dRTA adults, the patient may be started with a daily dose of 1 to 3 mEq/kg of alkali given in divided 
doses. The dose is titrated to raise bicarbonataemia and blood pH to normal. Children with dRTA 
usually require higher doses (up to 5-8 mEq/kg/day in infants) of alkali.  
Several alkalising salts have been authorised in the EU for indications that encompass treatment of the 
symptoms and consequences of dRTA, but none of them is indicated specifically in the dRTA

population. Indications of existing therapies include metabolic acidosis, hypokalaemia or 
nephrolithiasis, but without any clinical evidence in the dRTA population and without indications or data 
supporting use in the paediatric population. The only exception is the labelling on Alcaphor which 
includes all types of acidosis. These include, among others, potassium citrate and potassium 
bicarbonate, each as a single active substance or in different product combinations. All products are 
immediate-release formulations; except for Acalka, which is a modified release formulation. 
Furthermore, these medications have noticeable limitations, particularly in children, e.g. inappropriate 
pharmaceutical form, bitter taste, poor gastro-intestinal (GI) tolerability (such as nausea, vomiting, 
flatulence, abdominal pain and/or discomfort, or diarrhoea), and multiple daily intakes (including at 
night), which would hinder compliance and consequently clinical outcomes. 
About the product 
The applicant Advicenne S.A. submitted a marketing authorisation application for Sibnayal. Sibnayal is 
a fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release granules of potassium citrate (CK) and potassium 
hydrogen carbonate or potassium bicarbonate (BK).  
Within this procedure, the applicant initially applied for the following therapeutic indication: “Sibnayal 
is indicated for the treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) in patients aged 6 months and 
older.” 
The medicinal product acts as an alkalising agent and buffers the metabolic acidosis that occurs in 
patients with dRTA. It also provides a source of potassium to correct hypokalaemia. In addition, citrate 
acts also as a calcium chelating agent. 
The applicant claims that this is one single product containing an alkalising product plus potassium 
supplement, which is sodium-free, which is presented in a pharmaceutical form appropriate for all age 
groups, including children and elderly, and which improves treatment compliance due to bad taste 
masking, bid dosing and better Gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability. Further, citrate has calcium chelating 
properties. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Legal basis 
The legal basis for this application refers to 
Article 10(b) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended – relating to applications for new fixed combination 
products. 
Scientific Advice / Protocol Assistance 
The applicant received scientific advice / protocol assistance pertaining to the quality, non-clinical and 
clinical development (see section 1.1. ). 
The Applicant stated that they sought regulatory advice from Health Authorities on Sibnayal (company 
code: ADV7103) development programme: 
• 
• 
In November 2012, the design of the Phase II/III study was discussed in depth in addition to 
questions on Chemical, Pharmaceutical and Biological development, Toxico-Pharmacological, 
and Clinical programme at a CHMP/SAWP Scientific Advice 
(EMEA/H/SA/2474/2/2012/SME/III). 
In September 2017 (EMEA/H/SA/2474/3/2017/PA/SME/I), some quality aspects (e.g. on 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 11/91 
 
 
 
impurities) were discussed.  
• 
In February 2018 (EMEA/H/SA/2474/3/FU/1/2018/PA/SME/I), some aspects on the quality 
process were discussed. In September 2018, a follow-up Scientific Advice was completed to 
clarify how to express the product’s strengths (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/615804/2018). Of note, in 
clinical practice as well as in the literature, doses of alkali agents for the treatment of dRTA in 
children and adults are usually expressed in mEq/day or mEq/kg/day. In order to facilitate SoC 
switch to ADV7103 and dose titration by a physician for each patient, ADVICENNE suggested 
simplifying the expression of the strength in the name of the product, i.e. ADV7103 8mEq and 
ADV7103 24mEq. Moreover, Section 2 of the proposed Summary of product characteristics 
(SmPC) also mentions the quantity of both active ingredients in mg. In line with the EMA SmPC 
guideline which specifies that other information (different units) can be added if they have an 
interest for clinical practice, it was agreed at the (co-)rapporteur meeting in October 2018 that 
both mEq and mg could be included since their clinical interest is justified.  
During the CHMP/SAWP advice completed in February 2013, the following considerations were 
discussed and endorsed by the regulatory authorities, and subsequently followed when performing the 
pivotal study (B21CS) and its open extension long-term study (B22CS): 
• 
• 
The CHMP/SAWP discussed the appropriateness of the formulation for patients including 
children and suggested a fixed-dose combination.  
The dispensation of ADV7103 was discussed, and considering all the options, it was 
decided to develop unit-dose sachets combining a fixed quantity of CK and BK, with 
appropriate strengths for treatment initiation, titration and maintenance. This was viewed 
by the CHMP as the most attractive option to resolve potential concerns such as risks for 
dosing errors with the spoons, and dispenser performance issues. The CHMP also 
considered that there is no need for patients to adjust their dose on a daily basis, and that 
a fixed dose, as determined by the treating physician after careful titration and adjusted 
during clinic visits, would suffice.   
• 
Considering that both compounds have a well-known safety profile, the CHMP agreed that 
the nonclinical part of the dossier, based on the well-established use of the components 
might be supported by adequate literature references. The CHMP also mentioned that it 
was not considered necessary that any additional non-clinical studies are undertaken, 
including juvenile studies or combination toxicity testing. 
• 
Evaluation of the acceptability of ADV7103 in various age groups, using age appropriate 
rating systems was encouraged by the CHMP. Such recommendation was indeed followed, 
since ADV7103 acceptability (i.e. palatability and ease of swallowing and of administration) 
were assessed as secondary endpoints in Study B21CS, using validated instruments. 
• 
The design of the pivotal B21CS study and its extension study (Study B22CS) including 
their endpoints, were discussed in-depth at the discussion meeting, and the proposal of a 
switch study with a longer treatment period and using sequential SOC as the comparator, if 
SOC was optimised, was endorsed by the CHMP. In particular, bicarbonataemia was seen 
as a direct reflection of the metabolic acidosis in patients with dRTA. CHMP also pointed out 
that the goal of such efficacy analyses is not the formal demonstration of superiority or 
inferiority but rather to obtain adequate data for CHMP to evaluate the effectiveness (and 
safety) of ADV7103 treatment. 
• 
The CHMP recommended that patients be titrated to their correct dose level based on 
individual blood bicarbonate levels, similar to clinical practice.

It was also recommended that the paediatric patients should be included in the same 
clinical study as adults but, from a safety point of view, with older children and adolescents 
included first. A staggered approach was indeed considered necessary for the younger 
paediatric patients.

Figure 2: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of X-Ray diffraction 
and IR spectrometry analysis.  
The active substance is a hygroscopic colourless crystal or white or almost white crystalline powder or 
white granular powder, freely soluble in water.   
Potassium bicarbonate doesn’t exhibit stereoisomerism and polymorphism has not been observed.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Potassium bicarbonate is manufactured by one manufacturing site.  
Potassium bicarbonate is a well-known inorganic chemical entity made from three starting materials. 
The manufacturing process consists of a well-known and simple chemical reaction. The production is 
done in a well-defined continuous process occurring in a reactor in one step. The potassium 
bicarbonate is then centrifuged, dried, milled and packed for sale. 
During the synthesis, three impurities can potentially be present. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the current Ph. 
Eur. Monograph (1141).  
Moreover, other impurities are controlled according to Ph. Eur. Monographs in force. This restricted 
control permits to assure that even other impurities that may not come from the manufacturing 
process but from the starting materialare tested and followed on a routine basis.  
Potassium bicarbonate is considered as an inorganic chemical and is well-known to be chemically 
stable under ordinary condition of use and storage. Stability tests performed by the manufacturer on 
production batches do not show any degradation of the product. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis.  
The production is done in a well-defined continuous process occurring in a reactor in one step. There 
are no isolated intermediates. 
The specifications and control methods for starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
Three different primary packaging configurations are described for the active substance. A heat sealed 
plastic  bag  (white  opaque  LDPE  bag  with  1  row  of  pinholes  for  venting),  a  kraft  paper  multiwall  bag 
(inner layer of kraft paper followed by HDPE layer, kraft paper layer and full bleached white paper with 
a 5 inches PE lined valve) or a fibre drum with plastic liner. The three primary packaging materials are 
fully compliant to European Commission Regulation (UE) N° 10/2011 for food contact materials. 
Specification 
Specifications applied to control potassium bicarbonate batches are those of the monograph of the 
European Pharmacopoeia in force (1141)  
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 14/91 
 
 
 
 
The active substance specification  includes tests for: appearance (Ph. Eur), identification (Ph. Eur.), 
solution S appearance (Ph. Eur.), carbonates (pH) (Ph. Eur.), chlorides (Ph. Eur.), sulphates (Ph. Eur.), 
ammonium , calcium (Ph. Eur.), iron (Ph. Eur.), sodium (Ph. Eur.) and assay (Ph. Eur.). 
Solubility test was omitted knowing that the pharmaceutical form is a granule. The risk assessment 
performed in the finished product according to ICH Q3D guidelines identifies potassium bicarbonate as 
a potential source of lead. The analysis of 16 batches of potassium bicarbonate raw material using ICP-
MS analysis confirmed that it is not necessary to implement the lead analysis in routine. In accordance 
with ICH Q6A, potassium bicarbonate is not capable of supporting microbial growth or viability. For 
decades, it has been used and indicated for uses as a microbial disinfectant in food and agriculture 
industries and can have also bactericidal effect on Escherichia coli. Then, the microbiological analysis is 
not a requested test listed in the monograph.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of 3 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the manufacturer of the 
finished product stored in Kraft paper multiwall bags for up to 24 months under long term conditions 
(25 ºC / 60% RH), for up 24 months under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, appearance of solution S, pH (carbonates), loss on 
drying, particle size distribution, potassium bicarbonate content and microbiological quality. The 
analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
At 25°C/60% RH no clear changes or trends were seen in any of the tested parameters.  At 30°C/65% 
RH loss on drying increased, leading to out of specification (OOS) results. Furthermore, a decrease in 
potassium bicarbonate content, and increase of pH (carbonates) were observed. No changes or trends 
were observed for the other parameters. Except for loss on drying, all parameters were within their 
specification limits. At 40°C/75% RH an increase in loss on drying after 6 months was observed leading 
to OOS results already after 3 months. Furthermore, a decrease in potassium bicarbonate content was 
seen after 6 months. No changes or trends were observed for the other parameters. Except for loss on 
drying, all parameters were within their specification limits. The increase in loss on drying observed at 
40°C/75% RH and 30°C/65% RH is closely linked to the increasing humidity conditions of storage and 
is not atypical for the active substance given its hygroscopic nature. It is indicated that the parameter 
loss on drying is not a requirement of the Ph. Eur. monograph. Meanwhile collection of additional 
stability data by the manufacturer of the finished product, loss on drying will be tested on every raw 
material batches before manufacturing use further ensuring the quality of used batches.  
Kraft paper packaging is no longer used even though it was used for development batches. Now, 
potassium bicarbonate preferred packing is in heat seal packaging system and fibre drums. Thus, a 
second stability study was launched on three other industrial full-scale batches. Stability samples were 
stored in packaging system of plastic bags as LDPE bags of 100 μm thickness, closed with plastic ties, 
to support the two remaining presentations. This packaging quality presents the advantage to mimic 
the lowest thickness LDPE layer and the less tight closure system of both heat seal packaging system 
of plastic bag and fibre drum with plastic liner. Therefore, stability data for up to 3 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), under intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 60% RH) and under 
Assessment report

accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
parameter tested as the same as above. At 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/65% RH no clear changes or 
trends were seen in any of the tested parameters.  At 40 ºC / 75% RH, loss on drying values slightly 
increased close to the specification limit. This tendency was already observed in the study performed in 
Kraft paper multiwall bag but much more extended. This observation supports the claim that Kraft 
paper multiwall bag is less protective than heat seal packaging system of plastic bag and fibre drums 
with plastic liner.  
Two supportive stability studies were performed by the active substance manufacturer; three full-scale 
batches were stored at 15-25°C / ambient RH for 24 months. The batches were packed in kraft paper 
multiwall bags of 50 pounds for the first stability study and in fibre drums with plastic liner for the 
second stability study. Only assay by control of total alkalinity was controlled, showing no changes 
during storage and compliance with the specification for each of the two packaging configurations. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of stored for 24 months in 
original packagings below 25°C and in a dry place. 
Potassium citrate 
General information 
The chemical name of potassium citrate is tripotassium 2-hydroxypropane-1, 2, 3-tricarboxylate 
monohydrate corresponding to the molecular formula C6H5K3O7. H2O. It has a relative molecular mass 
of 324.4 and the following structure: 
Figure 3: Active substance structure 
Due to the existence of a certificate of suitability with the monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia 
in force (CEP) for potassium citrate, data relating to the elucidation of the structure of the active 
substance were provided in this CEP.  
The active substance is a hygroscopic white or almost white, granular powder or colourless crystals 
very soluble in water. 
Stereoisomerism and polymorphism have not been observed in the active substance.  
As there is a monograph of potassium citrate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the 
active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for 
the active substance which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
As described in the CEP, potassium citrate is packed in High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) lined paper 
bags. Paper bags are sealed by welding the HDPE-liner and closing the bag by hot melt adhesive. The

material is in accordance with EU-directives relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come 
into contact with foodstuffs (EU directive 2002/72/EC). 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identification (Ph. Eur.), 
solution S appearance (Ph. Eur.), acidity or alkalinity (Ph. Eur.), readily carbonisable substances (Ph. 
Eur.), chlorides (Ph. Eur.), oxalates (Ph. Eur.), sulphates (Ph. Eur.), sodium (Ph. Eur.), water  (Ph. 
Eur.) , particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.), and assay (Ph. Eur.)   
The control tests were carried out to comply with the specifications and test methods of the Ph. Eur. 
monograph. Additional specifications have been set for particle size distribution. The additional method 
has been adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2. 
Non routine application of microbiological quality test is based on the ICHQ6A decision tree # 6 and 
additional results of water activity measurements on several batches. Water activity measurements 
has been performed as the presence of water is a prerequisite for the multiplication of microorganisms. 
It is confirmed that potassium citrate does not support proliferation or viability of microorganisms 
Stability 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months, as stated in the CEP.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product consists of prolonged-release granules packed in unit-dose sachets that are 
available in two strengths, i.e. as 8 mEq and as 24 mEq sachets. Each sachet contains a fixed dose 
combination of potassium citrate prolonged-release granules and potassium bicarbonate prolonged-
release granules. Potassium citrate prolonged-release granules are green and potassium bicarbonate 
prolonged-release granules are white. 
The strengths are expressed and calculated as potassium milliequivalent (mEq). This expression is 
aimed at facilitating prescription and dose adaptation, which is done based on potassium mEq 
according to international clinical practices. Indeed, milliequivalent unit is often used to express the 
quantity of electrolytes involved knowing that 1 mEq = 1 mmol/valence. 
Considering the finished product as a sachet, the percent formula is identical for the two strengths and 
the composition in weight, different for the two strengths. 
The aim of the development is to obtain an innovative formulation that combines the advantage of two 
alkalizing agents, potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate, in an appropriate pharmaceutical oral 
form for children and adults, with only a twice-a-day administration. 
Relevant active substance attributes with a possible impact on the finished product manufacturability 
and performance have been discussed and were further taken into account during formulation and 
manufacturing process development. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards except silicified microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium chlorophyllin which are 
respectively controlled by manufacturer in accordance with internal monographs based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 17/91 
 
 
 
microcrystalline cellulose current Ph. Eur. monograph and silicified microcrystalline cellulose current 
USP-NF monograph. Magnesium chlorophyllin is controlled according to an internal monograph based 
on European Pharmacopoeia current methods and on current E140 ii monograph described according 
to current food regulation (EU n°231/2012). There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this 
report. 
Compatibility of the excipients with the active substances was considered and has been proven by a 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) performed on pure potassium bicarbonate and on pure 
potassium citrate and on the prolonged-release granules and during the stability testing of the finished 
product. 
Direct compression has been chosen to obtain core granules as prolonged release granules. Both types 
of granules are then coated with a film-forming polymer that controls the prolonged-release of the 
active substance and permits taste masking. A colouring agent is added to the coating layer of 
potassium citrate in order to differentiate potassium citrate granules (green) from potassium 
bicarbonate granules (white). The major criteria for the development of both granules were a high 
drug load to limit the number or size of the granules to dispense, granules must be tasteless and 
granules should release the majority of potassium in order to achieve the long duration of action 
needed to cover a twice-a-day administration, without dose-dumping. Prolonged-release forms of the 
two active substances were separately developed. 
Due to the endogenous nature of citrate, bicarbonate and potassium, their kinetics of absorption in 
blood cannot be assessed in human. In addition, the body permanently uses its powerful regulation 
systems to avoid any risks of acidosis or alkalosis, regulating and maintaining stable rates of those 
elements in blood. In that situation, it is not possible to establish a meaningful correlation between in 
vitro dissolution drug release and in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters. Consequently, in vitro 
dissolution methods were developed to test the release rate of both active ingredients with the 
objectives: discriminate batches with respect to efficiency of prolonged-release system, check the 
consistency of production throughout all development, i.e.: between clinical batches and routine 
production batches, and determine the stability of the products over the proposed shelf life and 
storage conditions.  
Dissolution is performed separately on potassium citrate granules and on potassium bicarbonate 
granules. The results demonstrate that the sensitivity of the testing method is good, and that the 
method is able to discriminate between slight differences in amount of coating layer. The 
discriminatory capacity of the dissolution method was confirmed. 
Bulks of potassium granules and bicarbonate potassium granules are manufactured and controlled 
separately as intermediate products. Each bulk is manufactured in a 3 steps process. At the end of 
those 3 steps, prolonged-release granules of potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate are primary 
packed combined together in sachets.  
Sachets as “Stick-packs” have been selected for the primary packaging due to their user friendliness. 
The form permits the user to take the dose directly in the mouth or pre-mixed with dairy products or 
stewed fruit. The type of packaging also offers a technical industrial solution to permit precise, 
reproducible, and adaptive filling of both granules in the same packaging without damaging the 
pharmaceutical forms. The suitability of the packaging was confirmed by the formal stability studies. A 
declaration of compliance of the foil with Regulation (EC) 1935/2004 has been provided, also 
confirming compliance with the inner LDPE material with Regulation (EC) 10/2011 as amended. 
Food compatibility and alcohol interaction studies have been performed. When the granules were 
mixed with hot foods, release from both granules was significantly increased. Therefore, granules 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 18/91 
 
 
 
 
should not be mixed with hot food or liquid. The product quality was not impacted after mixing with 
stewed foods and dairy products. These findings support the recommendations in the SmPC that the 
granules may be mixed (without crushing) with small amounts of soft food (e.g. fruit puree, yoghurt). 
Dissolution was slightly increased, but still within specification after mixing with 10% alcohol, but dose 
dumping and OOS results for dissolution were obtained after mixing with 40% alcohol. Granules were 
immediately dissolved in dissolution vessels when mixed with 40% alcohol. It is thus not recommended 
to mix the products with high levels of alcohol. 
The finished product was concluded not to be suitable for tube feeding considering the high risk of tube 
blocking due to the granule size and impossibility of crushing without affecting the release profile. In 
case of nasogastric tube feeding already available in standard of care treatments could be used. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Potassium bicarbonate granules and potassium citrate granules are considered as intermediate 
products and are manufactured, separately, according to three similar steps: manufacture of the 
powder blend manufacture of the uncoated granules and manufacture of the coated granules followed 
by primary and secondary packaging.  
Manufacturing process of granules is considered as a non-standard process due to the prolonged 
release properties. However, due to the non-complex manufacturing steps outlined, the manufacturing 
process could be considered as standard due the acceptability of the manufacturer’s understanding of 
the manufacturing process and their relevant experience of that process.  
The manufacturing process has been adequately validated at the proposed scale on three commercial 
scale batches for both granules. The sachet filling process has been validated on two pilot scale and 
one smaller batch (less than 10% of the maximum production scale) for both finished product 
strengths. This is sufficient, as this part of the process is not considered critical with regards to 
upscaling. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this pharmaceutical form.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications  include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identification (citrate potassium, bicarbonate potassium, Ph. Eur.), uniformity 
of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution profile (ICP-OES), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (ICP-OES), and 
microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.).  
A risk assessment on elemental impurities was performed. The only identified potential sources of 
elemental impurities are the raw materials (active substances, excipients and manufacturing aids) used 
in the manufacture of the finished products. The combined results on the risk assessments for the 
separate potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate granules revealed that three elemental 
impurities (As, Cd and Pb) might be expected to be higher than the limits authorised by the ICH Q3D 
guideline at the maximum daily dose. Six batches of potassium citrate prolonged-release granules and 
eight batches of potassium bicarbonate prolonged-release granules were tested by Inductive Coupled 
Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Further analysis was also performed by ICP-MS on six batches of 
potassium bicarbonate raw material for Pb. Results confirmed that the levels of relevant elemental 
impurities (Cd, Pb, As, Hg, Co, V, Ni) were consistently below 30% of the PDE. No further control was 
therefore required.

During the assessment, the applicant was requested to provide a risk evaluation concerning the 
presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product in question and applying the principles 
outlined in the notice “Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation holders 
(EMA/189634/2019)”. An evaluation was provided in order to assess the risk of presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the finished products, using quality risk management principles. Based on 
supplier’s information, no risk has been identified. Therefore, no further control is required. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and dissolution testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  four  production  scaled  batches  and  some  pilot  scaled  batches  of  each  strength  of 
finished product stored for up to 12 - 48 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH), for up 12 
months  under  intermediate  conditions  (30°/75%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Stability  data  from  5  intermediate  validation  bulk  batches  of  potassium  bicarbonate  granules  and 
potassium citrate granules (ADV7103-CK & BK) packed in sachets stored under long term conditions for 
up 48 months,  intermediate conditions  for up 12  months and  accelerated conditions for  up 6  months 
were also provided. 
The  following  parameters  were  investigated:  appearance,  water  content  of  both  granules,  dissolution 
profile of both granules, active substances assays and microbiological quality. 
A  reduced  design  based  on  matrixing  has  been  applied  for  the  long-term  and  intermediate  stability 
studies where not each batch was tested at each time points in the first 12 months of the studies. This 
reduced  design  is  considered  justified  based  on  the  same  granules  being  present  in  both  product 
strengths. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 4 years and do not store above 30°C as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
 No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities was provided using quality risk 
management principles. Based on supplier’s information, no risk has been identified. Therefore, no 
further control is required.

The applicant has applied Quality by Design (QbD) principles in the development of the finished 
product and its manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing 
process of the finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The components of Sibnayal (potassium, bicarbonate, and citrate) are endogenous substances, which 
are already available in various other medicinal products and also within different food products. 
Therefore, no additional non-clinical studies have been undertaken. The non-clinical part of the dossier, 
based on the well-established use of the components, is supported by literature references.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In the context of the current procedure, the components of Sibnayal are therapeutically effective as 
alkalizing agents. In the case of metabolic acidosis, potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate 
normalise blood bicarbonate concentrations and restore a normal physiological blood pH. This 
mechanism of action is described by the applicant without specific studies on the current product. 
Efficacy for the product under assessment will have to rely on clinical data. Which is acceptable to the 
CHMP. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No data on secondary pharmacology was provided. Considering the nature of the product, this is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies have been conducted with potassium citrate and potassium carbonate. 
Considering the endogenous nature of the substances together with extensive clinical experience as 
pharmaceutical ingredients, this is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 21/91 
 
 
 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions are discussed in the clinical part (see section 2.4. and 2.6. ). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Evaluation of absorption of unlabelled potassium citrate and potassium carbonate is not feasible due to 
different sources, readily convertible nature of citrate, and permanent regulation of the compounds 
within the body. However, an experiment cited from literature (Nakamura Y et al. Metabolism of citric 
acid, potassium citrate, sodium citrate and calcium citrate in the rat. J. Food Hyg. Soc. Japan. 
1987;28(4):251-260.) with radiolabelled potassium citrate is described in which it was shown that 
absorption of citrate was still not complete at the latest evaluated time point of 4 hours, after oral 
intake of 1889 mg/kg which can be viewed as a clinically relevant dose. It is not clear if this can be 
extrapolated to the human situation. 
No animal data on the absorption of potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate was provided. The 
applicant claimed a delayed release profile for the potassium hydrogen carbonate component of the 
product and an early release of the potassium citrate component, based on in vitro dissolution studies. 
The in-vitro dissolution profiles indeed showed that more than 80% of the potassium citrate 
component is released within the first three hours, while the potassium bicarbonate is released 
gradually over a timeframe of about twelve hours. The combined in-vitro release profile of the Sibnayal 
fixed combination medicinal product (FCMP) formulation clearly showed an overall higher release effect 
in the first three hours, compared to the release profile of the potassium bicarbonate component alone. 
This combined release would then allow for a more consistent and complete alkalising effect over the 
twelve hours for twice-daily dosing, than each mono-component alone could achieve. The rate of 
absorption and effects on duration of efficacy are further discussed in the clinical section and 
benefit/risk assessment in this report. 
Distribution of radiolabelled citrate is described in the same literature reference from Nakamura et al. 
The extent of distribution was measured at 0.5 and 24 hours after oral administration of 1889 mg/kg 
potassium citrate. These time points proved to be too far apart, as most of the citrate was still present 
in the GI tract at 0.5 hours after intake and therefore not yet absorbed and distributed, whereas at 24 
hours after intake only ~1% of the dose was still present in blood, kidney, liver and lung 
compartments. No data on distribution of potassium hydrogen carbonate were provided. Conclusions 
about distribution cannot be drawn. However, considering the nature of the product, this is not of 
concern. 
Circulating citrate can be converted into bicarbonate and constitutes a source of energy in the Krebs 
cycle. Bicarbonate is in equilibrium with carbonic acid and carbon dioxide (CO2). 
Circulating citrate is mainly eliminated as expiratory CO2 or in urine. Citrate can be reabsorbed in the 
proximal tubule in order to regulate renal citrate absorption and excretion. Bicarbonate is excreted in 
the urine or as carbon dioxide and water. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The clinical safety profiles of potassium, bicarbonate, and citrate are well known. No additional toxicity 
studies have been performed as agreed by the CHMP and PDCO. An overview of the available literature 
data was provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 22/91 
 
 
 
Single and repeat dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity was evaluated in several animal models, which showed high lethal dose 50 (LD50) values 
for citric acid, potassium bicarbonate and different potassium salts. Repeated dose toxicity studies 
report a good safety profile for all components of the product. Main effects observed are those related 
to physiological adaptations to high doses of alkalizing salts. This has limited relevance for patients 
suffering from metabolic acidosis. Both potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate are well known 
active substances and safety profiles are well established in humans.  
Genotoxicity 
Potassium citrate and potassium carbonate have no genotoxic potential. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity studies report a long-term but limited study on 20 male rats receiving 2g/kg/day citric 
acid. No increase in tumours was found. Other studies were performed in combination with different 
carcinogenic agents and are therefore of limited value. 
Potassium bicarbonate and other potassium salts were tested in a 30-month study in rats and shown 
to be urinary bladder tumour promoters. The mechanism for this effect was further investigated and 
determined to be rat specific and therefore not relevant for humans. 
Further, considering the long and intensive use of potassium citrate and potassium carbonate as food 
additives and for therapeutic indications without any concerns relating to carcinogenic risk in humans, 
both substances are considered not carcinogenic. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The effects of citrate on reproduction toxicity has been sufficiently investigated No teratogenic or 
embryotoxic/foetotoxic effects were observed in mouse, rat, rabbit or hamster. Data on sodium 
carbonate from mouse, rat and rabbit indicate no effects on reproduction, although the doses in these 
studies were lower than clinical doses. There is a limited amount of published clinical experience (46 
cases) with potassium citrate and potassium hydrogen carbonate, which do not point to any adverse 
effects on the foetus.  
The citrate and carbonate components of the product are unlikely to be of risk during pregnancy. The 
primary risk appears to be from hyperkalaemia, as this product could produce this in patients who 
have a condition predisposing them to high blood potassium levels. Because high levels are detrimental 
to maternal and embryo–foetal cardiac function appropriate warning statements have been added to 
sections 4.4. and 4.6 of the SmPC. No juvenile toxicity studies have been performed.  
Toxicokinetic data 
There are no toxicokinetic data available. Considering the nature of the active substances, this is not of 
concern.

Local Tolerance  
No studies on local tolerance have been provided. This is agreed considering the oral route of 
administration and well-known safety profile of the active substances. 
Other toxicity studies 
There are no impurities of concern in the drug product or drug substances. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substances are natural substances, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substances in the environment. Therefore, potassium citrate and potassium 
hydrogen carbonate are not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical development was discussed and agreed during CHMP protocol assistance. The 
components of Sibnayal (potassium, bicarbonate and citrate) are endogenous substances, which are 
already available in various other medicinal products and also within different food products. 
Therefore, no additional non-clinical studies have been undertaken. The non-clinical part of the dossier, 
based on the well-established use of the components, is supported by literature references. The non-
clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on provided literature references on safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction and 
development. 
The active substances are natural substances, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substances in the environment. Therefore, potassium citrate and potassium 
hydrogen carbonate are not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The application is approvable from a non-clinical assessment point of view.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
ADV7103 (i.e. Sibnayal) is a FCMP in a sachet, which includes: 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 25/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Potassium citrate formulated as prolonged-release granules (ADV7103-CK) allowing the release 
of the active substance for 3 hours, and  
• 
Potassium hydrogen carbonate (also known as potassium bicarbonate) formulated as 
prolonged-release granules (ADV7103-BK) allowing the release of the active substance for 12 hours.  
There are immediate release formulations of potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate approved for 
the treatment of the symptoms of dRTA, but not as fixed combination medicinal product. The daily 
dose of ADV7103 is comparable with the immediate release formulations but recommended for twice 
daily instead of 3-6 times daily for the immediate release products. ADV7103 was proposed to be 
indicated for the dRTA patients with the age from 6 months. The patients start with a body weight-
based loading dose then follow a up titration scheme to reach their optimum dose. The maximum 
dose, regardless of age group, is either 10 mEq/kg/day or a total daily dose of 336 mEq, whichever is 
lower. 
No pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have been performed for ADV7103. All PK characteristics of 
potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate are summarised based on literature.  
Absorption  
Based on literature, citrate, bicarbonate and potassium are all absorbed in the small intestine rapidly 
and almost complete. Citrate has a pH dependent absorption between pH 4.8 and 6.4 (along the upper 
side of the small intestine (duodenum, early part of jejunum)). 
The food effect on ADV7103 has been investigated based on the PD parameter of urine pH level at 
steady state, and no significant difference in urine pH level has been observed one hour before and 
after meal. ADV7103 is recommended to be taken with a meal.  
Alcohol and “hot” test were conducted in vitro, and it showed that the coating of the formulation can 
be affected, therefore both administrations with alcohol consumption and mixed with hot food (> 
40°C) should be avoided. A statement on this aspect is included in section 4.2 of the SmPC and section 
2 of the package leaflet. 
Distribution 
Citrate, bicarbonate and potassium are not bound to protein. Citrate is mainly in the blood, bicarbonate 
can distribute to the whole body, and potassium is mainly found in muscle and the skeleton and it is 
also present in high concentrations in the blood, central nervous system, intestine, liver, lung and skin. 
Elimination 
Citrate, bicarbonate and potassium are excreted in urine mainly. Citrate, under its trivalent form, is 
filtered freely through the renal glomerulus. In stomach, bicarbonate neutralises gastric acid with the 
production of carbon dioxide that is eliminated by the respiratory route. The 90% potassium is 
excreted via the kidneys, and 10% is eliminated in the faeces and small amounts may also be excreted 
in sweat.   
At physiological blood pH (7.4), citrate is entirely ionised under its trivalent form as the salt citrate. 
The citrate ion undergoes oxidative metabolic breakdown to carbon dioxide or bicarbonate. Bicarbonate 
and potassium are not metabolised. 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 26/91 
 
 
 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Based on the PD study, the urine pH level is higher in the subjects with a higher dose of ADV7103. It 
indicates the exposure is dose dependent; however, the dose proportionality is unknown. At steady 
state (Day 4 - 5), the pre-dose levels were higher than placebo, supporting the dose regimen of 12 
hours.  
Special populations 
Based on the diminished renal elimination of potassium, ADV7103 is not recommended for patients 
with moderate to severe renal impairment. No effect of sex and race on PK or PD profiles of alkalising 
agents or potassium supplements have been reported. The body weight is a factor and therefore 
ADV7103 is recommended based on the body weight (same as immediate release alkalising agents). 
Younger patients need a higher dose of alkalising agents, same as the finding in phase III study of 
ADV7103. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No DDI studies have been conducted for ADV7103. Based on experiences with other potassium 
containing medicines and on literature, potassium salts should not be given to patients receiving 
potassium-sparing diuretics/aldosterone antagonists because they diminish renal potassium excretion. 
Concurrent use of potassium citrate with digitalis glycosides may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia in 
digitalised patients and potentiate the arrhythmogenic effect of the cardiac glycosides. The 
administration of potassium-containing salts with drugs that increase serum potassium concentrations 
such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, heparin, NSAIDs or potassium-sparing 
diuretics should generally be avoided. The SmPC 4.5 includes an appropriate statement in this regard.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Sibnayal is a fixed-dose combination of potassium citrate and potassium hydrogen carbonate (also 
known as potassium bicarbonate) as prolonged release granules. 
The pharmacological properties of Sibnayal are directly linked to the capacity of potassium citrate and 
potassium hydrogen carbonate to maintain electrolyte balance. Both act as alkalising agents and buffer 
the metabolic acidosis. Sibnayal provides a source of potassium to correct hypokalaemia. In addition, 
citrate acts also as a calcium chelating agent. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Phase I PD/ proof of concept and safety study (B03CS) 
Study B03CS was a double blind, placebo controlled, two-period, incomplete crossover Phase I study 
conducted in 16 healthy subjects to investigate the pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of 
repeated doses of ADV7103 for 5 days. 
A schematic diagram of the study design is presented below in Figure 4:

The eligible healthy subjects were to be included in a balanced manner to one of the four possible 
treatment sequences, as detailed in the table below:

In period II, ADV7103 doses X, Y and Z and regimens were determined after the 
end of period I.  
The primary objective was to assess the PD effect on urine pH of oral doses of ADV7103 versus 
placebo after 5 days of treatment (Day 4, 5 and Day 6). Secondary objectives included assessment of 
the relationship between oral doses of ADV7103 and urine pH after 5 days of treatment, the PD effects 
on other urine biomarkers after 5 days of treatment, the residual effect on urine pH after treatment 
discontinuation over a 24- hour period, safety and tolerability. 
All doses administered demonstrated a statistically significant increase of pH over 24 hours (pooled 
from day 4 and 5) as compared to placebo (p<0.05 and in multiple occasions p<0.0001, See Figure 5 
and Table 9).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No PK study has been performed for ADV7103 due to the difficulties of measuring the actual exposure 
of the active substances considering that they are endogenous compounds and regulated by 
homeostatic system. Considering the complexity of the formulation of ADV7103 (i.e. fixed combination 
medicinal product and prolonged release) the applicant could have provided a single dose study 
measuring potassium/bicarbonate in healthy subjects or at least compare with immediate release 
formulation of potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate (as monotherapies).  
Nevertheless, as the active substances (potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate) are well-known 
endogenous compounds, literature was reviewed to describe the PK of potassium citrate and potassium 
bicarbonate. In vitro tests and clinical PD studies have been conducted that can be used to support the 
dose regimen of the twice daily of ADV7103. Therefore, the absence of PK studies can be accepted.  
Overall, literature data are sufficient to describe the PK of potassium citrate and potassium 
bicarbonate. Interactions between the two active substances are not expected. Drugs that can increase 
the concentration of potassium or decrease the excretion of potassium should be avoided or monitored 
depending on the patients’ experiences. This is appropriately labelled in the SmPC. Based on literature 
and study data the urine pH level will be increased due to alkalising agents treatment. However, 
because the patients with dRTA have already alkaline urine (pH 6.5 – 7.2), the further increase in urine 
pH due to the treatment was in a relatively small extent, (e.g. pH increased by 0.4 – 0.7 in literature). 
Patients with dRTA have alkaline urine due to their proton secretion defect. This may impact the 
excretion of medications into the urine (such as an increase of the elimination of salicylates, 
tetracyclines, and barbiturates and a decrease in the elimination of quinidine) or reduce the 
effectiveness of methenamine. As Sibnayal may further increase urine pH to a small extent, the 
interaction of alkaline urine with these medications may be enhanced.  This was added to 4.5 of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 33/91 
 
 
 
 
SmPC the applicant does not expect ADV7103 increases intragastic pH (due to bicarbonate) because of 
its prolonged-release profile limiting the release of alkalising agents in stomach and raising of gastric 
pH, which is agreed.  
A double blind, placebo controlled, two-period, incomplete crossover Phase I study (B03C) was 
conducted to investigate the PD, safety and tolerability of repeated doses of ADV7103 for 5 days. The 
relevance of the current study for the proof of concept may be limited due to the inclusion of healthy 
volunteers, who are effectively able to correct metabolic acidosis, in contrast to the diseased dTRA 
population. The urine pH levels were measured at Day 4, 5 and 6, for which steady state of ADV7103 
can be expected. Nevertheless, the urine pH at steady state could reflect a correction of blood pH 
based on alkali supplementation. In this respect, some information on duration of the alkalising effect 
could be derived from the current study with the primary and secondary objectives.  
Based on doses of 0.98 mEq/kg/day to 2.38 mEq/kg/day during period I and a determined dose of 
2.88 mEq/kg/day during period II, a dose dependent statistically significant treatment effect in urine 
pH values compared to placebo (up to pH 7 versus pH 5.5) in period I  and in periods I and II was 
observed. The proportion of urine samples with urine pH >7.0 was about 60% between 33/66mg and 
33/66 plus 50/100 mg and increased to 90% with the highest dose. Although the urine pH levels start 
to drop at approximately 8 hours after ADV7103 administration, the increased overall pH levels appear 
to reflect coverage of effect during the 12 h period. Because dTRA patients are expected to have an 
alkaline urine, whether the change of the urine pH level in healthy subjects would also apply to dTRA 
patients is not clear. It can be agreed that all doses administered demonstrated a statistically 
significant increase of citraturia as compared to placebo. No large differences in citraturia were 
observed between high and low doses. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of ADV7103 has been described with minimum data. Nevertheless, the absence of PK studies 
can be accepted because of the clear PD effects of ADV7103.  
A proof of concept study in dTRA has not been provided. A study in 16 healthy volunteers was 
conducted with the administration of the product during two 5 days periods. By measuring the urine 
pH (over 2 days) the alkalising effect of ADV7103 can indirectly be examined due to normal 
physiological effects. Despite that a somewhat prolonged and dose dependent effect could be observed 
with ADV7103, it can be questioned whether this would also apply to dTRA patients because of 
abnormal physiological functioning but as patients in the phase 3 study are titrated based on effect and 
based on reaching normalised levels, the PD studies are superseded by the provided efficacy data.

Phase II/III pivotal study (B21CS) 
A multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, sequential study, evaluating the efficacy, safety, tolerability 
and acceptability of ADV7103 compared to standard of care (SoC) in paediatric and adults patients 
with dRTA. 
Methods 
A schematic diagram of the study design is presented below in Figure 7:  
Figure 7: Study design 
Three study phases 
The study included three study phases (SP). Enrolled patients were to continue their SoC (without 
modification or prior titration phase) during SP I (5-day period), and subsequently received ADV7103 
via oral administration during SP II (titration phase; variable duration period up to 30 days) and SP III 
(5-day period). Treatment at each SP was as follows: 
•  SP I: Patients were to receive their usual SoC for 5 days. 
•  SP II: At the beginning of this period, patients switched from SoC to ADV7103. Patients were 
to receive ADV7103 twice a day for up to 30 days; titration was performed to determine the 
optimal dose based on patients’ bicarbonataemia. 
•  SP III: Patients were to receive ADV7103 twice a day for 5 days at the fixed optimal dose 
identified during SP II.  
Study Participants  
Up to 32 patients were to be enrolled in order to have 24 patients fully evaluable, with at least 4 
patients in each of the subsets as detailed below.  
The 24 patients were to be divided into 4 subsets based on their age:  
•  Subset 1: adults of age ≥ 18 years (full fluctuation evaluation) 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 35/91 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Subset 2: adolescents of age between 12 and 17 years inclusive (fluctuation evaluation).  
•  Subset 3: children of age between 4 and 11 years inclusive (fluctuation evaluation if feasible). 
•  Subset 4: infants and children of age between 6 months and 3 years inclusive (fluctuation 
evaluation if feasible). 
Enrolment was performed using a staggered approach. At least a total of 4 patients of Subsets 1 and 2 
had to have completed the study before starting the enrolment of patients of Subset 3. At least 4 
patients of Subset 3 had to have completed the study before starting the enrolment of patients of 
Subset 4. 
Key inclusion criteria 
The subjects had to fulfil the following key inclusion criteria: 
• 
Patients who had a diagnosis of dRTA (acquired or inherited form) with metabolic acidosis, 
male or female, including children aged between 6 months and 17 years old and adults aged ≥
18 years old and ≤55 years old.  
Key exclusion criteria 
Key exclusion criteria were subjects  
•  who presented associated proximal tubular signs (i.e. presenting for example hypophosphoraemia, 
urinary betamicroglobulin, hyponatremia),  
•  who presented a kalaemia (i.e. plasma potassium concentration) >5.0 mmol/L,  
•  who had a severe or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
according to Schwartz formula for the children and both Cockcroft & Gault and modification of diet 
in renal disease formulas for adults),  
•  who had any previous or concurrent medical condition or any laboratory or clinical findings or any 
other condition that in the opinion of the Investigator would have been negatively affected by the 
study medication or that would have affected the study medication or that precluded participation, 
e.g. uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency, cardiac impairment, repeated infections, 
metabolic alkalosis, chronic diarrhoea, or who took or could not stop (last dose on Day 1) 
potassium sparing diuretics, angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists, tacrolimus, potassium desodic salts, 
•  who were pregnant or breast-feeding, 
•  who received any medication within the 4 weeks before the inclusion in the study that could 
interfere with the study treatment,  
•  who had a history of difficult access to the oral administration route and/or conditions that may 
have hampered compliance and/or absorption of the study treatment (e.g. any difficulty of 
swallowing, mal-absorption, delayed gastric emptying, oesophageal compression, intestinal 
obstruction or other chronic gastrointestinal disease). 
Treatments 
Study medications 
Patients received SoC (the patient’s usual alkalising treatment) during SP I followed by ADV7103 in SP 
II and SP III. Both SoC and ADV7103 were administered orally. 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 36/91 
 
 
 
• 
The SoC was the alkalising treatment normally used by the patient. These alkalising treatments 
were compounded drugs with different possible active principles and immediate release 
pharmaceutical forms (e.g. capsules or powder diluted in water, including sodium bicarbonate, 
sodium citrate, potassium bicarbonate or potassium citrate, alone or in combination). 
•  ADV7103 was a combination of a ratio of 1/3 potassium citrate and 2/3 potassium bicarbonate 
prolonged-release granules 
Administration 
The daily dose of SoC was taken as usual by the patient during SP I for five days. This dose was fixed 
at inclusion and the dose regimen was the same all throughout SP I, with at least one dose in the 
morning.  
ADV7103 was administered twice per day (in the morning and in the evening). ADV7103 could be 
taken orally before a meal or with some semi-liquid foods for the youngest children. The morning dose 
was taken between 7 and 8 AM, and the evening dose between 7 and 9 PM.  
Selection of Doses in the Study 
The Applicant stated that the doses of SoC taken during SP I were the patients’ usual doses. 
The doses of ADV7103 were defined for each patient by the Investigator. At the start of SP II the dose 
was half of the daily dose of the patient’s SoC for the patients in age subsets 1 and 2. For patients 
belonging to subset 3, the initial dose could be re-evaluated using the first results about the 
equivalence between ADV7103 and SoC observed in the first 4 older patients by the Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB), with the overall goal of limiting the length of the titration period. Similarly, 
for patients belonging to subset 4, the first dose could be re-evaluated after the inclusion of the first 4 
patients of subset 3. During SP II, the dose increments could vary between 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 
mEq/kg/day, depending on the needs and treatment responses of the patients.  
During SP III, the identified optimal daily dose of ADV7103 was to be taken for 5 days. 
The maximum possible dose of ADV7103 in this study was 10 mEq/kg/day. This was selected based 
both on the fact that doses higher than 6 to 8 mEq/kg/day are generally prescribed to treat the 
proximal, rather than distal forms, of RTA and that to obtain an equivalent alkali effect, higher doses of 
ADV7103 (a prolonged-release formulation) may be needed compared to the usual immediate release 
formulations, such as described for other medications (e.g. propranolol). This dose is considered safe, 
even in infants. Nevertheless, it appears that for similar single doses of ADV7103 and of immediate 
release formulations (approximately 60 mEq) a prolonged alkalising effect of the urine pH is provided 
by ADV7103 compared to the other forms in healthy subjects. 
Titration 
During the titration phase of SP II, evaluations were planned and performed at regular intervals (e.g. 
every 2 days) between the Investigator and the patient to decide whether a dose 
increment/adjustment was needed or whether the optimal dose of ADV7103 had been reached, after 
obtaining the bicarbonataemia results, e.g. on Day 2, Day 4, Day 6 and Day 8 t0 before the first daily 
dose. The length of these steps could be between 2 and 10 days. 
The increased doses (if needed) were determined by the Investigator with dose increments based on 
the bicarbonataemia data. The length of each step of dose increment was also defined by the 
Investigator. The Investigator either adjusted the treatment (e.g. by adding one or more 0.25 mEq/kg 
mono-doses morning and evening) or maintained the same dosage. The daily dose was increased by 
increments of 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mEq/kg/day up to the target dose, which was the dose required to reach 
a bicarbonataemia within the normal range of values, as defined by the local laboratory, without 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 37/91 
 
 
 
exceeding a total dose of 10 mEq/kg/day. The dose of ADV7103 was increased if necessary, after 
control of the pre-morning dose bicarbonataemia, at a dose determined by the Investigator. 
Intolerable side effects could lead to termination of the titration, a decrease to the previously well-
tolerated dose, or an adaptation of the dose regimen. 
Optimal Dose 
A soon as a normal value of bicarbonataemia was reached, a second control of bicarbonataemia was 
performed 24 hours following the first control and before the first following daily dose. If the 
bicarbonataemia of the second control confirmed the value of the first control, the optimal dose was 
considered as reached, SP II was thus considered as completed and the patient proceeded with the SP 
III steady state period on the following day. If the bicarbonataemia of the second control did not 
confirm the value of the first control, the dose increment continued until confirmation of the optimal 
dose by the same process. The titration period was not planned to last more than 30 days, and was 
expected to be reached in less than 7 days. 
The optimal dose was validated after control of bicarbonataemia stability during at least 2 subsequent 
days, the first day being the day when the bicarbonataemia had reached a normal value, as defined by 
the local laboratory the first time, and the second day being the following day. For example, if the third 
increased daily dose resulted in a normal value of bicarbonataemia, then this dose would be 
maintained on Day 8 for the evening dose and control of bicarbonataemia would be performed again 
on Day 9 t0. If the bicarbonataemia value remained normal, the SP II titration phase ended on Day 9 
after administration of the dose (morning and evening). The third increased daily dose would thus be 
considered as the optimal dose. 
Bicarbonataemia was locally measured until the optimal dose was found. 
Diet 
Patients were required to eat meals at regular times, as a balanced standard diet as recommended by 
the dietician of the investigator site, have a similar diet on Day 5 of SP I and SP III (protein 
proportions as agreed by the Coordinating Investigator), not consume bicarbonate drinks and foods 
(e.g. soft drinks, Vichy water), have a limited intake of milk or dairy product, with standardised intake 
only (diet questionnaire at study inclusion), complete a diary book (for the patient/parents to record 
the investigational medicinal product intakes, times of blood samples, intake of proteins, any potential 
AEs and concomitant treatment).

To evaluate the acceptability (palatability, swallowing, ease of administration) of ADV7103 as 
compared to standard of care for 5 days of treatment at steady state.  
To evaluate the compliance to ADV7103 as compared to standard of care during 5 days of 
treatment at steady state. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was: average bicarbonate blood level during 3 days of 
treatment at steady state with ADV7103 and SoC (Day 2 to Day 4, before the first daily dose, of SP III 
and SP I, respectively). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
To assess the efficacy of ADV7103 compared to SoC based on other blood bicarbonate-derived 
parameters after 4 days of treatment at steady state (SP III and SP I, respectively) the following 
endpoints were addressed. 
• Categorical secondary endpoints: 
o  Number/proportion of patients with abnormal bicarbonataemia value (i.e. patients with 
at least one value of bicarbonataemia below the lower normal range, on Day 2 t0, Day 
3 t0 or Day 4 t0). 
o  Number/proportion of non-responders (i.e. patients with all three values of 
bicarbonataemia below the lower normal range, on Day 2 t0, Day 3 t0 and Day 4 t0). 
o  Number/proportion of non-responder patients with abnormally low bicarbonataemia 
value (i.e. patients with a mean blood bicarbonate value below the lower normal value 
on Day 2 t0, Day 3 t0 or Day 4 t0). 
• Continuous secondary endpoints: 
o  The area under the curve from t0 to t12h (AUC0-12h), AUC from t0 to t24h (AUC0-
24h), minimum concentration (Cmin) over 24 h, fluctuation (maximum minus 
minimum concentrations) over 24 h on Day 5. 
• Other secondary endpoints: 
o  Number of patients with a hypokalaemia, hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia after 4 to 5 
days of treatment at steady state. 
o  Number of patients with abnormally high urine calcium/citrate (UCa/UCi) ratio 
(expressed in mg/mg) and with UCa/UCi expressed in mmol/mmol above the risk 
threshold for lithogenesis after 4 to 5 days of treatment at steady state (post-hoc 
analyses). 
Further, acceptability was analysed on palatability, ease of swallowing and ease of administration on 
SP I and SP III Day 5, and the rate of compliance was determined in SP I and SP III. 
Acceptability assessment was performed using a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) or a 5- point 
facial hedonic scale (FHS) (Figure 6). Both scales are commonly used and widely accepted in clinical 
trial settings (with the FHS used more specifically in children aged between 4 and 12) and considered 
as valuable tools.  
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 39/91 
 
 
 
Adults and adolescents had to answer using VAS for which a score of ‘0’ meant ‘I dislike very much’ 
and a score of ‘100’ meant ‘I like very much’. The VAS was also used for infants by the same parent at 
each of the visits, based on infant’s behaviour or possible words. Children had to use the FHS with the 
help of their parents where necessary, to select the appropriate face to indicate their preference. 
Figure 8: Facial Hedonic Scale for palatability evaluation 
To allow a consolidated assessment with VAS results, linkage between VAS and FHS scorings was 
predefined in the CSP.

Sample size 
The sample size was planned to be 32 patients, to ensure that there would be at least 24 fully 
evaluable patients in the Per Protocol (PP) set, with at least 4 patients in each age subset. 
Approximately 12 patients were required to follow a fluctuation evaluation. 
The sample size calculation was determined by mean difference in bicarbonate levels of ADV7103 and 
SoC after 4 days of treatment. The sample size was based on the number of patients required to 
achieve at least 80% power for the primary non-inferiority efficacy analysis. The calculation was 
performed by means of a one-sided paired-t-test at the 2.5% significance level with an SD of 4.1 
mmol/L and a non-inferiority margin of -2.5 mmol/L for the mean difference in bicarbonate levels 
between ADV7103 and SoC.  
The non-inferiority margin was selected in line with recommendations by the 2005 EMA guideline on 
the choice of the non-inferiority margin (EMEA/CPMP/EWP/2158/99). The -2.5mmol/L margin was thus 
selected based on literature data (Domrongkitchaiporn S et al. dosage of potassium citrate in the 
correction of urinary abnormalities in paediatric distal renal tubular acidosis patients. American Journal 
of Kidney Diseases 2002(a) 39(2): 383-391.) 
 2002a), statistical calculation and clinical experts’ input, and judged acceptable by PDCO.

It is also important to note that although the 21-29 mmol/L reference value range is usually used, it is 
acknowledged there exist physiological differences between infants (17-25 mmol/L), children (18-29 
mmol/L) and adults (>22 mmol/L), as reported by Mayo Clinic Laboratories (mayocliniclabs.com). 
Randomisation 
Not applicable; the study had a sequential design. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was designed as an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Primary analyses set 
Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: all patients receiving at least one dose of the study drug at steady 
state (SP I/SP III) and with at least one efficacy assessment. 
PP Set: all patients who completed the study with no major protocol deviations having an impact on 
efficacy. In case of any missing bicarbonate blood concentration data on Day 2 t0, Day 3 t0 or Day 4 
t0, the protocol deviation was not to be considered major if a mean value for the primary endpoint in 
the period could be calculated according to a specific replacement algorithm. 
Efficacy analysis 
Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary endpoint was the average measure of bicarbonate blood levels during 3 days of treatment 
at steady state with ADV7103 and SoC. 
The individual differences (ADV7103 – SoC) in the mean of the 3 pre-morning dose blood bicarbonate 
levels on Day 2 (t0), Day 3 (t0) and Day 4 (t0) were analysed. Non-inferiority (and superiority) of 
ADV7103 vs. SoC was to be declared when the lower, one-sided 97.5% confidence limit on the mean 
difference laid entirely on the positive side of the non-inferiority margin equal to – 2.5 mmol/L. 
Secondary efficacy analyses 
• 
Bicarbonataemia-related endpoints after 4-5 days of treatment during SP I and SP III 
o  Categorical secondary endpoints. Proportions of non-responder patients. 
o  Continuous secondary endpoints. The mean differences (ADV7103 – SoC) for AUC0-
12h, AUC0-24h, Cmin and fluctuation was analysed  
•  Hypokalaemia, hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, abnormally high UCa/UCi: Proportions of patients 
and kalaemia, calciuria, citraturia, UCa/UCi (in mg/mg) data were summarised by and 
compared between treatments separately. 
Acceptability analysis 
For each parameter (palatability, ease of swallowing, and ease of administration), the scale scores on 
Day 5 of SP I and SP III were analysed. The palatability, ease of swallowing and ease of administration 
data were summarised by and compared between treatments separately.

Compliance analysis 
Compliance was determined during SP I and SP III. For each day or period, a patient was compliant if 
he/she took at least 80% and no more than 125% of all planned total dose in that day or period, 
respectively. The compliance of ADV7103 as compared with SoC during 5 days of treatment at steady 
state (SP I and SP III) was evaluated, and the proportion/number of compliant patients was analysed. 
Safety analysis 
Safety data were summarised descriptively by treatment, and listed by age subgroup, patient, 
treatment period and timepoint, as applicable. 
Subgroup analyses 
All variables were summarised in their respective analysis sets by treatment for each age subset 
separately. The primary and secondary efficacy variables were summarised by treatment of SoC type.

In Study B21CS, compliance was defined by the patient who took at least 80% and no more than 
125% of all planned treatments in that period. Using this definition, 34 of the 37 patients (91.9%) 
were compliant during SPI, and 31 of the 32 patients (96.9%) during SPIII. Results were similar in the 
different age subsets. Cases of non-compliance were mainly due to sparse intakes forgotten or error of 
dosing. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
Overall, the majority of patients were female (23 [62%] females vs. 14 [38%] males). More females 
(ranging from 60% to 80%) were enrolled in all age subsets, except for the infant category in which 4 
(80%) patients were male. Overall, the mean age of the patients was 11.5 years (range: 1-46 years). 
In particular, the mean age of adults, adolescents, children and infants was 23.3 years, 14.0 years, 7.3 
years and 2.6 years, respectively.

Table 8: Demographic summary and key baseline characteristics
dRTA 
The vast majority (35 [94.6%]) of patients had the inherited form of dRTA and 1 patient had an 
acquired form of dRTA concomitant to Sjögren syndrome. For 1 patient the type of dRTA was unknown, 
although an inherited dRTA was suspected, as the diagnosis was done 2 months after birth based on 
acidosis and nephrocalcinosis. The first diagnostic of dRTA was done early for most patients: at 3 years 
of age in average for the inherited dRTA cases (at 0.6, 5.3, 1.1 and 0.5 years of age, in adults, 
adolescents, children and infants, respectively), and at 38 years of age for the acquired dRTA case. 
Common dRTA symptoms were: nephrocalcinosis (in n=32 [86.5%]), hearing impairment (n=23 
[62.2%]), nephrolithiasis (n=5 [13.5%]), growth impairment (n=4 [10.8%]).

Biochemistry Parameters 
The overall mean (SD) venous blood bicarbonate was 23.18 (3.41) mmol/L (within the normal range), 
and generally similar across age subsets: 25.11 (3.69) mmol/L in adults, 21.65 (3.15) mmol/L in 
adolescents, 23.82 (3.09) mmol/L in children and 21.84 (3.41) mmol/L in infants. 
The overall mean (SD) plasma potassium was 3.55 (0.485) mmol/L (low but within the median normal 
range), and generally similar across age subsets: 3.50 (0.852) mmol/L in adults, 3.46 (0.475) mmol/L 
in adolescents, 3.66 (0.394) mmol/L in children and 3.55 (0.071) mmol/L in infants. 
Mean (SD) UCa/UCr was 0.28 (0.243) overall, and slightly higher in adolescents and children (0.32 
[0.416] and 0.32 [0.135], respectively) than in adults and infants (0.21 [0.186] and 0.24 [0.243], 
respectively). Mean (SD) UCi/UCr ratio was 0.13 (0.210) overall, and higher in infants and children 
(0.30 [0.415] and 0.18 [0.204], respectively) than in adults and adolescents (0.03 [0.021] and 0.03 
[0.015], respectively) 
Diet 
Most dRTA patients (30 [81.1%] patients) did not follow a specific diet before enrolment in the study. 
The remaining patients (7 [18.9%]) followed a specific diet: 
• 
• 
Diet normal in protein and low in salt for 3 (8.1%) patients 
Diet normal in protein, hypocaloric, without soft drinks or balanced standard diet, each for 
1 (2.7%) patient. 
Of the 6 patients who completed the study and followed a diet, 2 of them were fully compliant, 3 were 
moderately compliant (i.e. they were mainly not compliant on Day 5 of SP I and SP III) and one was 
not compliant.

Dose 
In the table below, the daily dose of SoC and ADV7103 are presented. Mean doses in mEq/kg/day were 
highest in the infant subset and decreased with age. 
Table 9: Extent of Optimal Exposure in SP I and SP III of B21CS study by age 
subset and overall (SA set)  
Regarding titration to the optimal dose, the majority of patients (25 [73.5%] patients) received a 
titration of ADV7103. Overall, nine patients (26.5%) did not need dose increments following the initial 
dose. 
The mean increment of titration overall, regardless of age, was 0.72 mEq/kg/day (equivalent to an 
increment in the absolute total daily dose of 23.27 mEq). The increase was dependent on the age 
group with a higher increment in mEq/kg/day seen with decreasing age group (0.38, 0.64, 0.73 and 
1.0 mEq/kg/day in adults, adolescents, children and infants, respectively). As dosing is weight-based 
this does not translate into a corresponding increase in an absolute total daily dose which was 28.16, 
27.89, 21.67 and 15.03 mEq/day across the age groups.  
The duration of the titration period ranged from 4 to 25 days. For those patients that were titrated, the 
median titration period was 10 days. Duration of the titration period was similar across age subsets, 
except for the infants who had a longer titration (17 days) in order to avoid too clustered blood 
samplings. The mean number of days between dose increments was of 4.19 overall, and of 3.33 for 
adults and adolescents, and longer for children and infants (4.65 and 5.13, respectively).

SoC treatment 
The number (%) of patients by SoC type is summarised by age subset and overall, for all patients. 
At study entry, SoC treatment included a variety of alkalising treatments. Almost 50% of the patients 
took 2 alkali agents. The most common SoCs were compounded formulations of potassium citrate with 
sodium bicarbonate (in 9 [24.3%] patients), potassium citrate (in 8 [21.6%] patients) and sodium 
bicarbonate (in 7 [18.9%] patients). The SoC brought a mean (standard deviation [SD]) daily load of 
sodium of 1.08 (0.56) g for 22 (59.5%) of the patients (ranging from 0.28 to 2.3 g). The SoC brought 
a mean (SD) daily dose of potassium of 63.9 (58.54) mmol for 81% of the patients, including also 
potassium supplementation for 8.1% of the patients. About 87% of the patients took at least 3 intakes 
of SoC a day (and up to 6 intakes a day). Approximately 27% of the patients, particularly children and 
infants, took SoC during the night.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint - bicarbonataemia 
The applicant stated that non-inferiority of ADV7103 vs. SoC was demonstrated in the PP set in terms 
of pre-morning dose average blood bicarbonate levels from Day 2 to Day 4. Indeed, the lower, one 
sided 97.5% confidence limit on the mean difference between treatments laid entirely on the positive 
side of the non-inferiority margin of -2.5 mmol/L: the mean difference (95% confidence interval [CI]) 
between treatments was 1.42 (0.41, 2.43) mmol/L, p<0.0001.  
By age subset, in the PP set, mean (SD) blood bicarbonate levels were higher with ADV7103 than with 
SoC in the paediatric subsets, and similar for both products in the adults. In addition, less variability 
was observed for adults and infants. 
The applicant reported furthermore that the mixed effect ANOVA in the ITT set, which was originally 
planned as sensitivity analysis, was showed superiority of ADV7103 to SoC with an adjusted mean 
difference (95% CI) of 1.64 (0.67, 2.60) mmol/L, p=0.0008. The analysis of mean blood bicarbonate

levels using the PP set provided additional support for the superiority evaluation of ADV7103 compared 
to SoC as significance was also achieved (p=0.0037) Table 18 .

(Non-)responders  
The efficacy of ADV7103 vs. SoC was supported by the analyses of patients who presented with blood 
bicarbonate levels below the lower limit of normal as defined by the local laboratories. A higher 
number of patients with on ADV7103 treatment (90%; 26/29) vs patients on SoC treatment (45%; 
13/29) were responders based on the definition of a mean level above normal blood bicarbonate range 
(derived from the table below). This was 75% vs 38% (non-responders defined as one measurement 
below normal range) and 97% vs 76% (non-responders defined as all non-missing measurements 
below normal level) for ADV7103 and SoC 
Table 15: Non-responder patients (n [%]) presenting the mean value of blood 
bicarbonate below the normal lower limit on Day 2 t0, Day 3 t0 and Day 4 t0 (PP 
and ITT sets) 
In all cases, the McNemar’s test determined that there was a statistically significant difference between 
the two treatments, indicating a greater probability of non-responders occurring with SoC. 
•  24 hours analyses of blood bicarbonate 
Blood bicarbonate parameters of Day 5 were measured at t0h, t4h, t8h, t12h (before the evening daily 
dose), t16h, t20h, t22h, t23h t24h (just before the next morning daily dose) for adults and t0h, t4h, 
t8h, t12h (before the evening daily dose), t16h, t20h, t24h (just before the next morning daily dose) 
for adolescents and children. 
No meaningful differences were observed for each age subset. The analyses of mean differences 
between ADV7103 and SoC for AUC0-12h, AUC0-24h, Cmin, and fluctuation did not achieve statistical 
significance in the PP set and the ITT set (see table below). 
AUC0-12h: mean difference (95% CI) between treatments: 1.5 (-14.32, 17.32) mmol.h/L in favour of 
ADV7103 (N=15), p=0.8418 (PP set).  
AUC0-24h: mean difference (95% CI) between treatments: -0.44 (-33.01; 32.12) mmol.h/L in favour 
of SoC (N=5), p=0.9718 (PP set). 
Cmin: mean difference (95% CI) between treatments: -0.68 (-2.11, 0.75) mmol/L in favour of SoC 
(N=23), p=0.3370 (PP set). 
Fluctuation over 24 h: mean difference (95% CI) between treatments: 0.4870 (-0.97, 1.94) mmol/L in 
favour of SoC (N=23), p=0.4949 (PP set)

Post-hoc analyses 
Acceptability analysis 
Palatability, ease of administration and ease of swallowing were evaluated by VAS score. 
Palatability 
Overall, palatability was better with ADV7103 than with SoC, with mean (SD) scores of 74.4 (20.60) 
mm vs. 49.3 (33.00) mm. This was similar across age subsets, except for children (from whom 
palatability was similar for the two treatments) (Figure 12). 
Figure 12: Palatability (AAS) 
The mixed model showed a superiority of ADV7103 vs. SoC in terms of palatability (mean difference: 
24.961 mm [95% CI: 10.6818, 39.2406]). The overall pattern of response shifted to a more 
favourable profile once patients were taking ADV7103. With their SoC, 40.00% of patients (14/35) 
expressed at least some degree of dislike for the taste of their medication whereas vs. only 3.23% of 
patients (1/31) with ADV7103. Conversely, the proportion of patients who showed to like the taste of 
their medication to some extent was 37.14 % (13/35) with SoC vs. 67.74% (21/31) with ADV7103. 
Overall, 61.3% of patients (19/31) exhibited a rating improvement ≥1 category and 48.4% of patients 
(15/31) ≥2 categories.

Ease of Administration 
Overall, mean (SD) ease of administration was greater with ADV7103 than SoC, without reaching 
statistical significance: 75.7 (24.71) mm vs. 60.1 (35.89) mm (mean difference: 15.477 mm [95% CI 
-0.8782, 31.8329]), consistent across age subsets, except for children (for whom ease of 
administration was similar for the two treatments) (Figure 13). 
Figure 13: Ease of administration (AAS) 
Ease of Swallowing 
Overall, mean (SD) ease of swallowing was similar to ADV7103 and SoC: 71.2 (29.70) mm and 68.6 
(30.98) mm, respectively. Adults, adolescents and infants reported easier swallowing with ADV7103 
than with SoC, while children reported easier swallowing with SoC than with ADV7103. Acceptability of 
the alkalising salts was significantly improved with ADV7103 compared to SoC (Figure 14)

Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity analysis on primary efficacy endpoint - bicarbonataemia 
The sensitivity analysis (two-sample t test for in the PP and ITT sets for the comparison vs. historical 
baseline data in untreated patients) showed that there were differences between the treatment groups 
(ADV7103 and reference), with an estimated difference (95% CI) of 6.96 (5.60, 8.32) mmol/L for the

PP set and of 6.92 (5.56, 8.27) mmol/L for the ITT set, confirming the robustness of the non-inferiority 
analysis. 
Table 22: Sensitivity analyses on blood bicarbonate level, two sample t-test (PP 
and ITT sets) 
Subgroup analyses by type of SOC treatment 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoints were conducted by comparing ADV7103 treatment with 
SoC treatment based on bicarbonate, combination citrate + bicarbonate, or citrate or comparison to 
SoC treatment based on sodium or potassium. 
The mean difference (95% CI) between treatments was 2.28 (0.72; 3.84) mmol/L, p<0.0001 versus 
bicarbonate, 2.14 (0.42; 3.85) mmol/L, p<0.0001 versus combination citrate + bicarbonate, and -0.07 
(-2.39; 2.26) mmol/L, p=0.0212 versus citrate. Similar results were obtained in the ITT set. 
Statistically significant superiority was not shown. 
The mean difference (95% CI) between treatments was 0.33 (-1.35, 2.01) mmol/L, p=0.0018 versus 
potassium, 2.73 (1.25, 4.21) mmol/L, p<0.0001 versus potassium+sodium, and 1.90 (-1.04, 4.84) 
mmol/L, p=0.0071 versus sodium. Non-inferiority was demonstrated versus all SoC types in the PP 
and ITT sets, and superiority of ADV7103 over SoC was demonstrated versus potassium+sodium SoC 
in the PP and ITT sets. Similar results were obtained in the ITT set.

Title: Multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority sequential study, evaluating the efficacy, 
safety, tolerability and acceptability of ADV7103 compared to standard of care in distal renal 
tubular acidosis patients. 
Study identifier  B21CS 
Design 
This was a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, sequential Phase II/III study to 
compare the efficacy, safety, tolerability and acceptability of ADV7103 with SoC. 
The study included three study phases (SP): 
•  SP I: patients were to receive their usual SoC. 
•  SP II: patients switched from SoC to ADV7103, titration phase to optimal dose 
•  SP III: patients were to receive ADV7103 twice a day at the fixed optimal dose 
identified during SP II.  
Patients’ bicarbonataemia and other defined parameters were assessed. 
Primary objective was to evaluate the relative efficacy of ADV7103 and SoC on 
correcting metabolic acidosis as measured by pre-morning dose blood bicarbonate 
levels (bicarbonataemia) during 3 days of treatment at steady state (Day 2 to Day 4).
Duration of main phase: 
Maximum of 40 days

1 Day 
5 days with SoC 
 SP II (titration phase) 
3 up to 30 days with ADV7103 
 SP III

Hypothesis 
The calculation was performed by means of a one-sided paired-t-test at the 2.5% 
significance level with an SD of 4.1 mmol/L and a non-inferiority margin of -2.5 
mmol/L for the mean difference in bicarbonate levels between ADV7103 and SoC.

Supportive study 
Open label extension Study B22CS 
A multicentre, open-label (OLE), extension study, evaluating the safety and tolerability and the efficacy 
of ADV7103 at long term in distal renal tubular acidosis patients. Patients completing Study B21CS 
were allowed to enter the OLE study (Study B22CS) and continue their treatment with ADV7103 at the 
optimal dose determined during Study B21CS (and further adapted if needed) for at least 24 months 
(M24). The dose could be readjusted if the Investigator considered it necessary according to the 
laboratory results of the patient. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ADV7103 as 
measured by AEs. The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the long-term efficacy of 
ADV7103 on correcting metabolic acidosis as measured by bicarbonataemia, hypocitraturia, 
hypercalciuria and crystalluria, the long-term paraclinical and biological safety of ADV7103, the long-
term compliance to ADV7103, and the long-term effects of ADV7103 on kalaemia, hyperphosphaturia, 
hypermagnesuria. Further, the long-term effects of ADV7103 on nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, bone 
remodelling, rickets and osteomalacia, respectively in the paediatric and adult population, growth in 
the paediatric study population and on pubertal maturity in the relevant paediatric study population 
and on QoL, and the long-term treatment acceptability of ADV7103 were examined as exploratory 
endpoints. 
A total of 30 patients (six adults, eight adolescents, 13 children and three infants) entered the OLE 
study and 29 of these had data collected up to M24. One adult withdrew from the study after M12 for 
personal reasons.

reduced at M3, M6, M12, M18 and M24 (4.8%, 5.0%, 5.6%, 10.0% and 8.7%, respectively). 
•  Citraturia 
Overall, compared to B21CS Study where 7 (41.0%) of the patients had normal UCi/UCr after 
ADV7103 treatment, 7 patients (35.0%) had citraturia (UCi/UCr) in the normal ranges at baseline, 10 
patients (52.6%) at M3, 9 patients (40.9%) at M6, 7 patients (29.2%) at M12, 14 patients (51.9%) at 
M18 and 10 patients (41.7%) at M24. 
•  Calciuria 
• 
Urine calcium/creatinine ratio 
All patients had UCa/UCr within the normal range at all visits, except for one to two patients who 
presented abnormally high values at M3 and subsequent visits. 
• 
Urine calcium/citrate ratio 
Compared to B21CS Study where 11 (55.0%) of the patients had UCa/UCi values in the normal range 
after ADV7103 treatment; in B22CS Study, overall 9 patients (45.0%) at baseline, 11 patients 
(57.9%) at Month 3, 9 patients (47.4%) at Month 6, 10 patients (43.5%) at Month 12, 10 patients 
(38.5%) at Month 18 and 9 patients (37.5%) at Month 24 had UCa/UCi in the normal range.  
•  Other parameters 
Twenty-five patients (92.6%) overall had UPh/UCr in the normal range at baseline, and this was stable 
during the study. Most patients overall had UMg/UCr in the normal range from M1 to M24, with 
fluctuations of one to 4 patients with levels above normal range during follow-up. 
•  Crystalluria 
Thirteen patients overall (50.0% of the 26 assessed, including 3 adults, 4 adolescents, 5 children and 1 
infant) had a positive result for crystalluria at M24. Crystal species reported were amorphous

carbonated calcium phosphate (ACCP) in 7 cases (53.8%), ammonium hydrogen urate in 3 cases 
(23.1%) and brushite, calcium oxalate and struvite, each in 1 case (7.7%). 
The majority of patients overall had urine pH between 7.0 and 8.0 ranging from 64% to 76%.  
• 
Treatment compliance 
Overall, 18 of the 29 patients (62.1%) remaining in the study at M24 had compliance of >90%, 5 
patients (17.2%) had compliance of 75-90%, 6 patients (20.7%) had compliance of 50-74%, and 
there were no patients with compliance of <50%. Compliance was in the adult and child groups (with a 
compliance ≥75% in 100% and 84.6% of patients, respectively), and good in the adolescent and infant 
groups (with a compliance ≥75% in 62.5% and 66.7% of patients, respectively). 
•  Nephrocalcinosis 
Overall, most patients presented with nephrocalcinosis at both baseline (25 patients; 86.2%) and M24 
(28 patients; 96.6%). Two patients (one adolescent and one infant) developed nephrocalcinosis during 
the 24 months of follow-up, while they were not always fully compliant to the treatment.  
•  Nephrolithiasis 
Overall, nephrolithiasis was only seen in small numbers of patients, and the proportion of patients 
presenting with this condition was similar at baseline (six patients; 20.7%) and M24 (five patients; 
17.2%). 
• 
Bone Remodelling 
Bone alkaline phosphatase levels in the normal range fluctuated from 75% to 95%, phosphorus levels 
in the normal range from 83% to 100% and blood calcium levels in the normal range from 93% to 
100% during the study period. Hydroxy-vitamin D levels in the normal range ranged from 43% to60% 
and thus considerable proportion had low Hydroxy-vitamin D levels. Some patients (17/30; 56.7%) 
received doses of 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D at some time points during the study. For 1α,25-dihydroxy-
vitamin D 80% to 100% were in the normal range during the study. For parathyroid hormone 88% to 
100% were in the normal range during the study. For calcitonin levels 83% to 100% were in the 
normal range. The majority of patients had normal Z-scores (above -2.0) at both baseline and M24 for 
BMD in the spine region, hip region and whole-body region. No adults presented with osteomalacia and 
one infant presented with rickets, at baseline. By M24, no patients presented with either osteomalacia 
or rickets. 
• 
Growth in Children 
The majority of patients in all age groups and at all visits were in the ±2SD range and in the ±3SD 
range for weight, height and BMI. 
• 
Growth velocity 
Considering adolescents, growth velocity decreased from M3-M1 to M24-M18. Growth velocity for 
children and infants remained relatively constant during the study. Growth velocity was normal for the 
majority of patients overall (17 patients; 70.8%) at M3, with seven patients (one adolescent, four 
children and two infants) having a low value. By M24, all patients had normal (18 patients) or low (six 
patients) growth velocity. The six patients reported with low values comprised two adolescents, three 
children and one infant.  
• 
Pubertal Maturity 
Incidences of early pubertal maturity/growth regarding pubic hair were reported in one patient at M1, 
two patients at M3, one patient at M6, two patients at M12, three patients at M18 and one patient at

M24. Additionally, late pubertal maturity/growth was reported in one patient at each visit from M12. 
Incidences of early pubertal maturity/growth regarding penis/breast were reported in two patients at 
M1, two patients at M3, one patient at M6, one patient at M12, three patients at M18 and one patient 
at M24. Almost all the cases of abnormal pubertal maturity/growth occurred in the adolescent group, 
except for early pubertal maturity/growth (both parameters) in one patient in the child group at each 
visit from M18. 
• 
Treatment Acceptability 
At the end of the study (M24), the question asked to the patient (or to the caregiver) and repeated for 
each topic was “As compared to your previous alkalinising treatment, what is/are the reason(s) for 
which you prefer keep ADV7103 rather than your previous alkalinising product?” 
Overall, high mean VAS scores were obtained for improvement in efficacy (91.2%), improvement in 
safety (72.2%), more appropriate formulation (83.9%), more convenient number of daily dose intakes 
(90.2%) and improvement in taste (68.6%). 
All patients had an improved efficacy score of ≥50% and all but two patients (8.7%), both children, had 
an improved efficacy score ≥75%. An improved safety score of ≥50% was reported for 22 patients 
(75.9%) overall and a score of ≥75% in 19 patients (65.5%). The same trend was seen in the 
individual groups by age, except for infants, where all patients had a safety score ≥75%. More 
appropriate formulation scores ≥50% were obtained for all children and infants, all but one adolescent 
(i.e. seven patients (87.5%)) and three adults (60.0%). The same results were observed for scores ≥
75% for adults and adolescents, and all but one of the children (12 patients; 92.3%) and infants (two 
patients; 66.7%) reached this score. More convenient number of daily dose intake scores were ≥50% 
for all adults, adolescents and infants, and 11 children (84.6%). Considering the higher threshold, all 
adults and infants had scores ≥75%, as did seven adolescents (87.5%) and ten children (76.9%). 
Better taste scores of ≥50% were obtained for all infants (all scores also ≥75%), ten children (76.9%) 
half of adolescents (four patients; 50.0%) and four adults (80.0%). Scores ≥75% were also obtained 
for eight children (61.5%), three adolescents (37.5%) and three adults (60.0%). 
• 
Quality of Life 
The change of alkalising treatment from their SoC to ADV7103 led to an average improvement in their 
QoL using a 100-mm VAS of 80.7% at M6 and 88.9% at M24 (98.6% in the adult group, 84.6% in the 
adolescent group, 86.5% in the child group and 94.7% in the infant group at M24). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
ADV7103 (Sibnayal) is a FCMP of prolonged release granules of potassium citrate and potassium 
hydrogen bicarbonate (2 different sachets of 8 mEq and 24 mEq). The effect of ADV7103 has been 
evaluated in the B21CS study, a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, sequential phase II/III study 
and aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and acceptability of ADV7103 twice daily 
compared to SoC (variety of use of salts 3 to 6 times a day) in dRTA patients from different age 
categories of 6 months to adulthood. In this respect, SoC treatment cannot be exactly defined as no 
guidance on the preferred treatment exists and different medications have thus been used. The study 
included three study phases (SP) as follows: enrolled patients were to continue their SoC without 
modification during a 5-day period (SP1), and were subsequently crossed-over and titrated with 
ADV7103 to an optimal dose for up to 30 days (SP II) to control their bicarbonate levels, followed by a 
Assessment report

5 days steady state period (SPIII) once stable control was reached. Effect of treatment was compared 
based on the steady state of SoC (SPI) versus steady state of ADV7103 (SPIII).  
Although the study design complied generally with earlier CHMP/SAWP and EMA/PDCO advices 
(February 2013 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/69792/2013); EMA Decision: P/0355/2018)), several issues to the 
study design are noticed that may limit conclusions on any potential non-inferiority and superiority 
claim. The assumption is made that patients were on an optimal SoC dose based on their long-term 
usual care without any interference during the 5 days follow-up. However, a titration phase (up to 30 
days) for ADV7103 has been applied to establish the optimal dose, which could inappropriately favour 
ADV7103 in comparison to SoC. Secondly, the sequential cross-over design between SoC and ADV7103 
further limits evaluation and interpretation for direct comparison of SoC with ADV7103.  
Considering the rarity of the disease, a limited number up to 32 patients were planned to be enrolled in 
the study. The proposed sample size consisted of at least 24 dRTA patients fully evaluable and 
stratified in 4 subsets of age, with at least 4 subjects in each of the 4 sub-sets and the staggered 
approach starting with older paediatric populations. The sample size was discussed and agreed in the 
CHMP/SAWP (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/69792/2013) and PIP (EMA Decision: P/0355/2018), and based on the 
assumptions, the sample size calculation is correct.   
The primary endpoint, the difference between average bicarbonate levels for ADV7103 and SOC at 
steady state, allows for evaluation of short-term correction of metabolic acidosis, and is acceptable. 
This is compared with a one-sided t-test, with non-inferiority declared if the corresponding CI was 
above the non-inferiority margin. For setting the non-inferiority margin, the guidelines were followed, 
using statistical reasoning and clinical judgement. The statistical reasoning is based on limited data 
present, which may lead to uncertainties. Nevertheless, the margin of 2.5 mmol/L can be accepted as 
it falls within the standard variability of bicarbonate in these patients and was judged adequate in a 
survey in key opinion leaders and by the PDCO. Although, limitations to the study design, as discussed, 
may limit a conclusion on any potential non-inferiority claim the CHMP considers a clinically relevant 
therapeutic effect of the product. 
Similar limitations in design to conclude on any non-inferiority claim are also applicable for any 
potential superiority claim.  
Secondary endpoints of responder analysis are helpful in the further interpretation of the data. A 24-
hour evaluation on Day 5 of steady state could be helpful to interpret the 24-hour coverage of 
metabolic acidosis control. Evaluation of other electrolytes likely to be dysregulated in dTRA including 
hypokalaemia, hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia are also relevant. The endpoint on acceptability is 
important for assessment of the formulation and its advantages on taste, daily dosing intervals etc. 
These secondary categorical endpoints using 2x2 tables and McNemar's test and continues endpoints 
using t-tests are both considered standard and acceptable. However, no multiplicity-adjustments were 
considered for the secondary endpoints; therefore, they are regarded as descriptive and no conclusions 
based on statistics can be drawn. 
Generally, the inclusion criteria of a diagnosis of dRTA (acquired or inherited form) with metabolic 
acidosis, male or female, including children aged between 6 months and 17 years old and adults aged ≥
18 years old and ≤55 years old reflects the intended population of patients suffering from dRTA and 
represents all relevant age groups. Exclusion criteria were planned to exclude patients with possible 
other reasons such as presentation of proximal tubular signs, kalaemia >5.0 mmol/L, or other reasons 
that could potentially jeopardise study conduct and completion, which is supported.  
Those patients completing the pivotal B21CS study could be included in study B22CS, a multicentre, 
open-label, extension study and was intended to evaluate the safety and tolerability and the efficacy of 
ADV7103 over a longer term of 24 months in dRTA patients. The study provided more long-term 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 65/91 
 
 
 
information on treatment with ADV7103 in support of the pivotal study in terms of maintenance of 
treatment effect and longer-term evaluation of safety. The main exploratory endpoints were 
nephrocalcinosis and lithiasis, bone remodelling, growth, long-term treatment acceptability and QoL, 
endpoints which are relevant for long term disease progression and which could not be evaluated in 
the pivotal short-term study.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
B21CS (pivotal) study 
The number of patients who discontinued the study were limited to 5 (14%). Two of those patients 
discontinued during the SoC treatment period (SPI) due to withdrawal of consent (children category), 
and one patient due to difficulty in swallowing (infants’ category). Three patients discontinued during 
the titration and/or steady state phase during treatment with ADV7103 due to lack of efficacy (n=1, 
adolescent) or consent withdrawal (1 adolescent, 1 infant) and one patient for other reasons. However, 
from the more specific data provided in the clinical study report, it appears that these patients 
discontinued due to issues with treatment acceptability (difficulty in swallowing) during the titration 
period SP II and one patient had the age of 1 year, when enrolled in the study. Treatment in patients 
below one year of age has not been evaluated and the single patient of one year of age treated 
discontinued treatment due to issues with treatment acceptability. Therefore, the CHMP questioned the 
appropriateness for use of Sibnayal in very young patients also because the current sachets cannot be 
applied in case of the presence of a feeding tube. It was acknowledged by the committee that intake of 
such granules depends on the maturity of the individual child and infant for swallowing but agreed with 
the applicant to amend the to be treated patient population to patients aged one year and older. 
The number of major protocol deviations were limited and are therefore not expected to majorly 
impact the study results. No concerns have been identified on recruitment or compliance. Non-
compliance was not based on tolerability or safety reasons. However, according to the study protocol, 
patients were required to follow certain diet requirements, but over 80% of the patients did not follow 
a diet. Moreover, from the 7 patients following a diet and completed the study (n=6), only 2 
completely complied to their diet. However, no pattern could be obtained from the different diets and 
the outcome on the plasma bicarbonate levels.  
Included adults were relatively young with a mean of 23 years of age, while the age ranged from 1 
year to 46 years of age. Patients ≤1 year were not included, the applicant agreed therefore to exclude 
patients ≤1 year from the claimed indication. In line with inclusion criteria, almost all patients had 
genetically confirmed dRTA with only one patient having an acquired type of dRTA, but it is considered 
that a treatment effect of Sibnayal will be similar for patients with acquired or inherited dTRA. The 
condition of dRTA is further confirmed by associated symptoms of hearing impairment, 
nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis.  
SoC treatment included a variety of alkalising treatments, and thus any precise definition of SoC is 
complicated, also complicating several aspects of comparison of study results to ADV7103 treatment. 
Almost 50% of the patients took 2 alkali agents. The most common SoCs were combined formulations 
of potassium citrate with sodium bicarbonate (in 9 [24.3%] patients), or one product of potassium 
citrate (in 8 [21.6%] patients) or sodium bicarbonate (in 7 [18.9%] patients).  
At screening, bicarbonate levels seem well controlled within normal range (>22 mmol/L) for adults 
(25.1 mmol/L) and children (23.8  mmol/L) and just below normal range for adolescents (21.7 
mmol/L) and infants (21.8 mmol/L ) with use of SoC treatment based on one measurement. A more 
precise measurement during SPI including mean levels on day 2 to 4 identified slightly different results 
with only adults (24.1 mmol/L) being well controlled and adolescents (21.6 mmol/L), children (19.9 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 66/91 
 
 
 
mmol/L) and infants (19.9 mmol/L) below normal range. Consequently, infants, children and 
adolescents were most in need for titration to reach normal blood carbonate levels. During the titration 
phase, a lower increment in mEq/kg/day was seen with increasing age group with dose increases 
performed in 3/3 patients (mean increase 1.0 mEq/kg/day per 5.1 days), 13/14 patients (0.73 
mEq/kg/day per 4.7 days), 6/10 patients (0.64 mEq/kg/day per 3.3 days) and 3/7 patients (mean 
increase 0.38 mEq/kg/day per 3.3 days), respectively. Accordingly, following the titration phase (SPII) 
a higher mean level with ADV7103 at steady state compared to SoC (6.1 vs 5.3; 3.8 vs 2.7 and 2.8 vs 
2.2 mEq/kg/day) was found, and slightly lower levels were needed for adults (1.7 vs 2.0 mEq/kg/day). 
Increased blood bicarbonate levels with ADV7103 appear mainly attributed to the paediatric patients, 
with normal levels being reached for all age groups, although normal levels could still not be reached 
for infants (21.8 mmol/L). Adults blood bicarbonate levels were comparable in both treatment groups, 
already being at normal levels on SoC. Whether closer follow-up and titration for SoC would also have 
yielded comparable results in control of bicarbonate levels remains an unanswered question and 
importantly invalidates the non-inferiority and superiority claim, in addition to other mentioned 
limitations of the study design. Nevertheless, the primary endpoint of a non-inferior treatment effect in 
blood bicarbonate levels with ADV7103 as compared to treatment with SoC was met with a mean 
difference (95% CI) between treatments of 1.42 (0.41, 2.43) mmol/L, p<0.0001. Further, superiority 
was also reached with an adjusted mean difference (95% CI) of 1.64 (0.67, 2.60) mmol/L, p=0.0008. 
This was also shown for the PP data set (p=0.0037). The primary efficacy findings on bicarbonate 
levels generally showed consistent effect with the overall effect when comparing ADV7103 to the 
subgroups of SoC treatment with, bicarbonate (2.28 mmol/L) combination citrate + bicarbonate (2.14 
mmol/L), and comparison to sodium (1.90 mmol/L), potassium (0.33 mmol/L) or both of them (2.73 
mmol/L). The CHMP considers a clinically relevant therapeutic effect of the product. However, SoC 
treatment with citrate appeared to demonstrate slightly better results than ADV7103 (-0.07 mmol/L). 
Secondary endpoints generally supported the primary endpoint findings. A higher number of patients 
on ADV7103 (90%; 26/29) vs SoC (45%; 13/29) were responders defined as a mean level above 
normal blood bicarbonate range. Other definitions of responders supported these results with 75% vs 
38% (non-responders defined as one measurement below normal range) and 97% vs 76% (non-
responders defined as all non-missing measurements below normal level), respectively Further, 
continuous monitoring (roughly every 2 hours) of the bicarbonate at steady state showed comparable 
results between ADV7103 and SoC for AUC0-12h (mean (SD) 270.6 (27.26) vs 270.9 (39.71) 
mmol.h/L), AUC0-24h (536.8 (44.45) vs 567.9 (71.67) mmol.h/L), Cmin (19.8 (3.72) vs. 20.4 (3.30) 
mmol/L), and fluctuation range (4.8 (2.69) vs. 4.3 (1.76) mmol/L), suggesting comparable 24 hour 
coverage of effect of the FCMP (of citrate for the first three hours after intake and of bicarbonate after 
passing the stomach about twelve hours after intake), which would then allow for a more consistent 
and complete alkalising effect over the twelve hours for twice-daily dosing, than each individual mono-
component could achieve. 
Further analyses, linked to the dRTA indication, have been provided on potassium levels, urine 
calcium, and urine citrate, however, any comparison is limited by the different compounds used in the 
SoC, e.g. whether citrate was part of the SoC treatment. Nevertheless, potassium levels were just 
above normal range for all age groups (3.50 mmol/L in adults, 3.46 mmol/L in adolescents, 3.66 
mmol/L in children and 3.55 mmol/L in infants) at baseline and achievement of normal potassium 
levels remained comparable during the study with for both SoC and ADV7103 treatments (3.8 mmol/L 
vs 4.0 mmol/L). For incidences of hypokalaemia, which is a major symptom for patients with dRTA, no 
large differences have been observed between the two treatment groups during the study (17% each). 
Sodium-based alkalising agents increase renal excretion of calcium. However, no meaningful 
differences have been observed between the two treatment groups with respect to hypercalciuria. Two 
patients each with SoC and ADV7103 had hypercalciuria. One of the mechanisms to compensate low 
blood pH is endogenous citrate, which is reabsorbed from the renal tubules into the blood and 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021

decreases the levels of citrate in the urine (e.g. hypocitraturia). Addition of citrate would be expected 
to reduce this effect. A post-hoc analysis on hypocitraturia showed a lower proportion of patients with 
hypocitraturia for ADV7103 (10/16 (62.5%)) vs SoC (15/16 (94%)). Further, the number of 
responders with normal UCa/UCi values was higher for ADV7103 (11/19 (58%)) than for SoC (3/19 
(16%)) which may suggest a lower risk to lithogenesis  
Acceptability  
About 87% of the patients took at least 3 intakes of SoC a day (and up to 6 intakes a day), and 
approximately 27% of the patients, particularly children (5, 33%)) and infants (2 (40%)), took SoC 
during the night. It could reasonably be assumed that 2 times dosing a day with the FCMP would 
improve treatment adherence and convenience. Overall, this appears to be generally confirmed with 
improved palatability (mean (SD) scores of 74.4 (20.60) mm vs. 49.3 (33.00) mm), mean and 
improved ease of administration (75.7 (24.71) mm vs. 60.1 (35.89) mm) for ADV7103 vs SoC. Ease of 
swallowing appears similar with ADV7103 and SoC: 71.2 (29.70) mm and 68.6 (30.98) mm. Yet, 
overall, 61.3% of patients (19/31) exhibited a rating improvement ≥1 category and 48.4% of patients 
(15/31) ≥2 categories. Although this was not that clear for the children category (4-11 years, with 
similar results for palatability, ease of administration and lower for ease of swallowing, also with a 
within analysis, probably based on heterogeneity of the rater and the lack of sensitivity of the 
evaluation scale). Of note, current sachets cannot be applied in case of the presence of a feeding tube, 
while this is often applied in infants, which is currently adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Patients generally remained compliant to therapy during the additional 24 months of therapy in the 
open label B22CS study (75-90%), and only one patient discontinued at 12 months. 
Long term effect on bicarbonate levels could generally be maintained as levels were generally above 
the normal range, however, high variability between each visit could be observed in each age group. 
This may likely be (partly) explained by the single measurement at each time point, variation in 
timepoint (hours after intake), treatment compliance and time of dose adjustment. Although, the 
responder rates were slightly lower (56-92%) during the 24 months as compared to the initial period 
as evaluated in the pivotal B21CS study (75-97%) but appears comparable to SoC (38-76%). 
Further, normal plasma potassium levels could be maintained (84% vs 82% in B21CS study), although 
some variability exists especially observed in the adults. A similar observation applies to data on 
citraturia, calciuria and urine calcium/citrate ratio. The number of patients with phosphaturia or 
magnesuria is low with ~10% and incidentally observed and were generally stable over time. ACCP 
crystals were the main reported type of crystalluria in the study and are generally also mostly found in 
clinical practice in dRTA patients due to their high urine pH, hypercalciuria and/or hypocitraturia, and 
hyperphosphaturia.  
Explorative findings 
Any beneficial impact of ADV7103 on several disease characteristics could not be clearly observed. 
Nephrocalcinosis increased from 86% to 97% (i.e. one patient developed nephrocalcinosis during the 
B22CS trial). No impact has been observed for nephrolithiasis, bone alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, 
vitamin D, calcium, parathyroid hormone, and calcitonin. Seven patients have shown a negative 
change in Z-score of the BMD from baseline to the end of the study, but this may inherent to the 
underlying disease. Further, no impact has been seen on stature and growth, or pubertal maturity. 
Also, during long term therapy, exploratory evaluation showed improved perception of efficacy 
(91.2%), safety (72.2%), taste (68.6%) and more appropriate formulation (83.9%), and more 
convenient number of daily dose intakes (90.2%). However, these data should be taken with caution 
due to potential bias (e.g. recall bias) and the way questions were perceived which tend to be 
suggestive in favour of ADV7103 (e.g. “As compared to your previous alkalinising treatment, what 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 68/91 
 
 
 
is/are the reason(s) for which you prefer keep ADV7103 rather than your previous alkalinising 
product?”).  
During assessment the applicant was asked to clarify the contribution of each component (potassium 
citrate and potassium hydrogen carbonate) to the overall effect of the fixed combination medicinal 
product and the rationale for the combination. The bicarbonate component of Sibnayal has been 
developed to provide minimal release of bicarbonate in the stomach and the proximal part of the 
Gastrointestinal (GI) tract to avoid a loss of active substance due to the production of CO2 by the 
bicarbonate and gastric acid and possible side effects of gastric gas accumulation. Thereafter gradual 
release is taken place, which therefore provides a 12-hour coverage after a single intake for twice-daily 
dosing. It is consequently assumed that there is a limited (clinical) effect of the bicarbonate component 
alone in the first three hours after each intake. Therefore, the rationale of the addition of the 
potassium citrate component, developed as a ‘short’ oral prolonged-release dosage form, is to fill the 
gap of the delay in release of bicarbonate by the release of this citrate in the first hours. The 
combination of the citrate (for the first three hours) and the bicarbonate (after passing the stomach to 
twelve hours after intake) would then allow for a more consistent and complete alkalising effect over 
the twelve hours for twice-daily dosing, than each individual mono-component could achieve.  
This was supported by in-vitro dissolution profiles, as approximately 90% of the citrate component is 
released within the first three hours, while the bicarbonate is released gradually over a time-frame of 
about twelve hours, with overall a higher release effect in the first three hours of the Sibnayal FCMP 
formulation, compared to the profile of the potassium bicarbonate component alone. Due to the simple 
direct alkalising effect of both components, it can be assumed that the clinical effect would follow a 
similar pattern as for the in-vitro dissolution data. Furthermore, urine pH data over twelve hours, as 
evaluated in study B03CS in healthy subjects, reasonably match with this assumption for the overall 
effect of the FCMP with a steep rise in effect already at the first two hours post-dose (at steady state) 
and an almost consistent coverage of effect for twelve hours.  
The CHMP considered this sufficient to support the scientific principle for a FCMP of the contribution of 
each individual component to the desired effect, in particular in the context of absence of any clear 
increased safety issues identified when combining both components, the relative straightforward 
mechanism of action. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
An overall treatment effect of normalising blood bicarbonate levels as well as normalisation of 
potassium was observed in adults, adolescents and children >1 year of age with dRTA during 24 
months of treatment with Sibnayal. Despite that a non-inferior and a superior treatment effect, as 
compared to SoC treatment, was reached for achieving appropriate bicarbonate levels, limitations to 
study design and conduct preclude to make such claims especially for the sequential design and a 
titration phase lacking for SoC treatment. Similar limitations apply to other secondary endpoints such 
as evaluation of urine calcium and urine citrate.  
A two times daily dosing intended for the ADV7103 is generally favoured over 3 up to 6 times dosing 
with current SoC, which is generally supported by the acceptability data.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety database includes all patients with dRTA having taken at least one dose of ADV7103 (from 
up to 40 days to up to 24 months) during the pivotal short term study B21CS and the extension study

B22CS. Safety data generated with the Phase I study (B03CS) in 16 healthy subjects who received 
ADV7103 for 5 or 10 days, were presented separately as supportive safety data. 
Patient exposure 
Fifty subjects have been exposed to ADV7103, of which 16 were healthy subjects and 34 were patients 
with dRTA. Daily doses of ADV7103 were titrated on an individual basis. Study drug exposure through 
the studies is summarised in the table below.

Study B21CS 
In Study B21CS, information on AEs is summarised in the table below. Overall, a total of 24 (64.9%) 
patients experienced TEAEs during the study. This was 7 (18.9%) patients during SP I (SoC steady 
state) and 6 (18.8%) patients during SP III (ADV7103 steady state). TEAEs were reported in 19 
(55.9%) patients during the ADV7103 titration period (SP II). 
Only 1 patient reported serious TEAEs in Study B21CS. No AEs leading to treatment discontinuation 
have been reported.

Study B22CS 
In study B22CS, where patients have received ADV7103 for up to 24 months, overall, a total of 27 
(90.0%) patients experienced at last one AE. All but one of the AEs were judged as TEAEs. Among 
these TEAEs, 5 (16.7%) patients were reported with treatment-related TEAEs, 1 (3.3%) patient 
experienced a severe TEAE judged not-related to the treatment, 4 (13.3%) patients reported serious 
AEs, which were considered as not treatment related, was reported in 1 (2.7%) adolescent during 
SPII.  
There were no TEAEs leading to discontinuation and no deaths during the study. No pattern was 
observed of increasing treatment-related events with increasing duration of exposure to ADV7103.

Most frequently reported TEAEs (overall in >10% of patients in any SP) were from the Gastrointestinal 
Disorders (in 16 [43.2%] patients), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (in 8 
[21.6%] patients) and Nervous System Disorders SOCs (in 7 [18.9%] patients). As expected, these 
TEAEs were reported more frequently in the titration period SP II than in the steady state periods SP I 
and SP III.

GI tolerability (based on VAS assessment) 
Improved GI tolerability was reported for ADV7103 compared to SoC (Figure 15). The mixed model 
showed a statistically significant decrease in severity of the GI discomfort with ADV7103 compared to 
SoC, with a mean score difference of -14.237 mm (95% CI: -25.9196, -2.5545). Following the switch 
from SoC to ADV7103, the proportion of patients with rating category (including 5 grades ‘Extremely 
severe/severe/moderate/mild/no complaint’) improvement ≥1 and ≥2 were 38.7% (12/31) and 22.6% 
(7/31), respectively.

Serious adverse event and deaths 
Serious adverse events 
In Study B21CS, one serious case of gastroenteritis was reported in one adolescent during the titration 
period (SPII). The event, which was of moderate intensity was not considered as related to the study 
drug and resolved within 24 hours without any corrective treatment. Treatment with ADV7103 was 
interrupted for a day since vomiting was associated to the gastroenteritis then reintroduced without 
dose change. 
In Study B22CS, four SAEs were reported in four patients overall (13.3%), all considered unrelated to 
treatment. These SAEs were: renal colic (in an adult), gastritis and wisdom teeth removal (in 
adolescents) and gastroenteritis rotavirus (in an infant). All were due to a requirement or prolongation 
of hospitalisation, and all were resolved/recovered within the following days without ADV7103 dose 
change.  
In Study B03CS, no serious TEAEs were reported. 
Deaths 
No death was reported during the clinical development of ADV7103.

Laboratory findings 
Study B21CS  
Overall, the assessed safety blood chemistry parameters of safety did not change in a clinically 
significant manner from screening to Day 5 of SPI and SPIII and from baseline to M24. The same trend 
was observed in each age subset. 
There was only one isolated case of hyperkalaemia of 4.7 mmol/L (normal value range: 3.5- 4.5 
mmol/L), reported in 1 child at Day 2 t0 of SPIII. The child did not present other episodes of 
hyperkalaemia during any of the 4 days remaining in SPIII, until the end of SPIII, with values of 4.1 on 
Day 3 t0, 4.2 on Day 4 t0 (normal value range: 3.5 4.5 mmol/L), and 3.47 on Day 5 t0 and 3.74 on 
Day 5 t12h. Overall, in this study population no trend for hyperkalaemia was observed, confirming the 
safe use of ADV7103 in the treatment of dRTA. 
Safety in special populations 
Elderly population 
Since the upper age limit of inclusion was 55 years and the oldest patient recruited was aged 46 years, 
there were no elderly recruited in the study.  
Renal impairment 
Laboratory values for estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) included abnormal values for 6 
patients who presented abnormally low eGFR values of grade 2 (i.e. eGFR mildly decreased, between 
60 and 89 mL/min/1.73m2). Five of them had abnormally low eGFR at a single time-point or for a 
limited time period, but one child had abnormally low eGFR values from Month 12 up to at least Month 
24. There was no pattern in the decreased eGFR over time. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with hepatic impairment have not been included. 
Immunological events 
Not applicable. The components of Sibnayal (potassium, bicarbonate, and citrate) are endogenous 
substances. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific DDI studies have been performed with ADV7103, however, the applicant provided a 
discussion related to potential interaction of ADV7103 with other active substances which may be 
concomitantly used by dRTA patients. 
The proposed SmPC covers these concerns with regard to concomitant use of medicinal products that 
may increase potassium levels or induce hyperkalaemia (e.g. ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing 
diuretics or ciclosporin), medicinal products affected by serum potassium disturbances (e.g. 
antiarrhythmics or corticosteroids) and alcohol, i.e. in the section 4.5 with one cross-reference to 
section 4.4. It includes among others an advice for monitoring of potassium plasma levels, serum 
potassium and ECG, and a recommendation to avoid an alcohol. For more details on DDIs please refer 
to the PD section.

Further, with regard to the method of administration and concomitant use of ADV7103 with hot food 
and alcohol, in the section 4.2 of proposed SmPC the following statement is presented: "In no instance 
granules must be mixed with hot food, hot liquid or alcohol or chewed as this can disrupt their 
prolonged release properties and may lead to large sudden release of alkalising agent that could affect 
product efficacy and safety." The package leaflet includes a similar statement. This is considered fully 
sufficient. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No cases of study treatment discontinuation due to TEAE have been noted during the performed 
clinical studies. 
Post marketing experience 
There are no post-marketing data for ADV7103 at the time of this application. 
However, ADV7103 is available in the frame of early access programs in Europe: named patient uses 
have been approved in Sweden from 11 April 2018, in France from 13 July 2018 and in Norway from 
14 October 2019. At the cut-off date of 15 October 2019, prescriptions of ADV7103 have been 
delivered to 56 new dRTA patients. Overall, the duration of exposure has been from 1 to 13 months. 
Among these patients, four patients reported adverse events, two cases of diarrhoea, one case of 
stomach burning sensation, and one case of depressed mood and weight gain. In addition, two 
patients misused ADV7103 either by crunching some granules or by taking one sachet and a half. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database for treatment with the FCMP of ADV7103 is very limited due to the orphan nature 
of the disease. The safety results are based on the data from a short-term study in healthy volunteers, 
a short-term pivotal study including a titration phase of maximum 30 days and 5 days of steady state 
followed by a 24 months extension in dTRA patients. Fifty subjects have been exposed to ADV7103, of 
which 16 were healthy subjects and 34 were patients with dRTA. Longer term exposure data are 
available for only 29 patients with dTRA for 24 months. Doses used for ADV7103 were generally higher 
as for SoC, except for adults.  
Due to the widespread use of both ingredients alone or in combination in patients with dRTA in clinical 
practice the safety profile has been widely established mainly including gastrointestinal disorders, such 
as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspepsia or diarrhoea depending on citrate or hydrogen 
carbonate based therapy as labelled in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Further, there is a potential risk for hyperkalaemia with potassium supplementation either used as a 
cation in the product or supplemented separately. For the current FCMP a coating has been used, and 
in that sense differs from existing therapies. However, the sequential study design, uncontrolled data 
and the limited number of patients limit the interpretation of the safety profile in comparison to 
existing therapies or placebo. Precautions have been included in the SmPC with contraindications in 
patients with hyperkalaemia and in case of renal impairment with GFR ≤ 44 mL/min/1.73m². and 
precautionary statements on conditions pre-disposing to hyperkalaemia such as monitoring of plasma 
potassium and risk of overdose as included in section 4.4, 4.5 and 4.9 of the SmPC. The package 
leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Overall, a high proportion of subjects (24 (64.9%)) experienced AEs during the B21CS study, but this 
was mainly due to the high frequency of AEs during the titration phase (19 (56%), while during SoC 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 79/91 
 
 
 
treatment and steady state period with ADV7103 (SPIII period) frequency of AEs were 18.9% and 
18.8%, respectively. A smaller proportion was considered treatment related, this was 4 (10.8%), 9 
(26.5%) and 1 (3.1%) for SoC, titration phase of ADV7103 and steady state phase of ADV7103, 
respectively. Incidence of AEs during the titration phase has not caused limitations to optimal dosing. 
Due to the longer follow-up period in the OLE study more AEs were reported than during the short-
term pivotal study (90% vs 65%), although treatment related events were also limited to 5 patients 
(16.7%). 
In general, ADV7103 appears generally well tolerated, as no patients discontinued treatment due to 
AEs during 24 months of treatment. Furthermore, SAEs are limited, with one patient with 
gastroenteritis in an adolescent observed during the short-term pivotal study and resolved within 24 
hours and 4 patients (13.3%) during the extension phase (renal colic (in an adult), gastritis and 
wisdom teeth removal (in an adolescent) and gastroenteritis rotavirus (in an infant)), but these were 
all considered unrelated to treatment, resolved within the following days and no dose changes were 
performed. Reassuringly, no deaths occurred during the studies. 
As expected most common AEs were observed in the SOC of Gastrointestinal Disorders (16 patients 
[43.2%]), including abdominal pain (8 (21.6%)), upper abdominal pain ((5 (13.5%)), diarrhoea (3 
(8.1%)), vomiting (3 (8.1%)), and nausea (2 (5.4%)) being mostly observed, mainly during the 
titration phase with ADV7103 13 (38.2%) vs 5 (13.5%) with SoC and 1 (3.1%) during steady state 
ADV7103. During steady state, only the abdominal pain AEs (3 (8.1%) with SoC, 1 (3.1%) with 
ADV7103) were considered treatment related. Another frequently reported AE was headache (2 (5.4%) 
with SoC; 2 (6.3%) during steady state ADV7103), but this was not considered related to treatment. 
The long-term study confirmed the high frequency of gastrointestinal AEs (12 (40%) including 
abdominal pain (3 (13.3%), vomiting (3 (10%)), diarrhoea (2 (7%)) and upper abdominal pain (2 
(7%)). However, only for 5 patients (16.7%), GI symptoms were considered treatment related. 
Further, vitamin D deficiency (12 (40%)) and hypokalaemia (3 (10%)) were also frequently reported, 
likely associated with the underlying disease characteristics. Due to the low number of subjects for 
each age category no conclusion can be drawn for the individual AEs observed across these different 
age categories.  
Overall, any risk for hyperkalaemia appears to be limited. Only one isolated case of hyperkalaemia of 
4.7 mmol/L was reported in 1 child at Day 2 t0 of steady state ADV7103 treatment with no other 
episodes of hyperkalaemia during rest of treatment.  
Four out of 56 patients reported AEs through the early access programs of ADV7103 use in Europe. All 
reported adverse events can be considered as isolated cases and no pattern could be identified. 
Therefore, no safety concern can be identified from the current available experience through early 
access programs in Europe. 
ADV7103 has not been investigated in patients below 6 months of age or above 46 years of age. The 
safety profile for older patients could be different for those with decreased renal function. Therefore 
the precautionary wording in 4.4 of the SmPC recommends to the prescriber to take special care in 
elderly people in whom renal function can be decreased. In moderate to severe renal impairment a 
higher risk for hyperkalaemia may be expected. Accordingly, hyperkalaemia and renal impairment with 
GFR ≤ 44mL/min/1.73m² are contraindications. Furthermore, the “risk of hyperkalaemia when used in 
patients with comorbidities such as renal impairment” is listed as an important identified risk in the risk 
management plan (RMP).

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Sibnayal in paediatric, adolescent and adult subjects with dRTA was generally well tolerated with no 
patients who discontinued during a 24-month treatment period due to AEs. The main adverse drug 
events are gastro-intestinal events of which abdominal pain was dominantly reported. Any comparison 
with SoC or comparison between age groups is hampered by the small number of patients evaluated 
but in the context of the orphan nature of the disease and considering the widespread use of both 
ingredients alone or in combination in patients with dRTA in clinical practice an acceptable safety 
profile has been demonstrated. The current safety profile of ADV7103 does not suggest any difference 
to Standard of care (SoC) treatment.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Sibnayal is a new dose combination of potassium citrate/potassium hydrogen bicarbonate and the first 
product indicated specifically in the dRTA population. Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that a 
separate entry in the EURD list for Sibnayal is needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for 
potassium. The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal 
product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request the 
alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the EBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The Group accepted the proposal to have 4 different multilingual outer cartons and two different 
sachets (one in English only and one in French, German, Dutch and Italian). For both sachets, active 
substances are presented in English and Latin only due to space constraints.  
The package leaflet will be translated in each national language. However, in Member States from 
groups 2, 3 and 4, the active substances will be included in English and Latin as well, so there will be a 
link between the package leaflet and the packaging. 
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is a condition characterised by a renal defect in hydrogen ion 
secretion (distal renal tubule localisation) and insufficient secretion of bicarbonate (HCO3
-) into the 
blood (most important blood acid buffer) inducing a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (blood pH ≤ 
7.35). Metabolic acidosis corresponds to a blood pH below 7.35 with a bicarbonate blood concentration 
lower than 22 mmol/L. Other symptoms are hypokalaemia, hypocitraturia and hypercalciuria. If 
metabolic acidosis is left untreated or poorly treated this can induce nephrocalcinosis or lithiasis of 
which may result in CKD (85% stage 2-4 in adults and 35% CKD stage ≥2 in children). Metabolic 
acidosis triggers bicarbonate and phosphate efflux from the bone in an attempt to buffer the acid blood 
pH. This results in bone softening manifestations such as osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children, 
and fractures. As blood pH homeostasis is essential for the secretion of growth hormone, particularly at 
night when its secretion is maximal, metabolic acidosis also induces restricted growth in children. 
Overall, if thus left untreated or mistreated, dRTA can thus lead to renal function impairment, weaken 
muscle strength, affect bone structure and result in adults of short stature. In some genetics forms, 
deafness, ocular abnormalities or mental retardation have been described 
The disease can be of inherited origin (arising from a genetic mutation) most commonly observed in 
children, or of acquired origin due to an underlying autoimmune systemic disease, such as Sjögren 
syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosous or autoimmune hepatic diseases as usually observed in 
adults. dRTA was estimated to affect approximately 2.1 per 10,000 persons in the EU. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In dRTA, lifelong alkali replacement therapy is given to correct metabolic acidosis. Potassium 
supplements are also be administered to maintain plasma potassium levels in the normal range as 
needed.  
In dRTA adults, the patient may be started with a daily dose of 1 to 3 mEq/kg of alkali given in divided 
doses. Children with dRTA usually require higher doses (up to 5-8 mEq/kg/day in infants) of alkali due 
to growth associated increased metabolism and increased protein intake. The dose is titrated to raise 
bicarbonataemia and blood pH to normal. Night intakes of the current immediate release alkalising 
agents are also particularly necessary for children, since growth hormone is secreted mainly at night, 
but at physiological pH. To achieve appropriate bicarbonate levels is sometimes difficult to achieve, 
especially in younger children. To avoid renal complications, citrate is (sometimes) used as it is also 
chelator of calcium, but this is not always part of therapy, especially due to the occurrence of nausea. 
Several alkalising salts have been authorised in the EU for indications that include metabolic acidosis, 
hypokalaemia or nephrolithiasis, but not in all countries, and hospital preparations are being used. 
These include, among others, potassium citrate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, and 
sodium citrate each as a single active substance or in different product combinations. There is no 
preferred treatment and this likely depends on country availability and practice preference. All products 
are immediate-release formulations, except for Acalka (potassium citrate, authorised in Spain and 
Portugal), which is a modified release formulation. The immediate release products generally have a 
bitter taste if no coating is applied. GI adverse events are common but differ among patients and type 
Assessment report

Page 83/91 
 
 
 
of product. Nausea and vomiting may be more observed with potassium citrate, while abdominal 
discomfort (due to gas (CO2) production) may be more observed with carbonate-based therapy. 
Multiple daily intakes from 2 to 6 times a day are needed, especially in young children doses at night 
may be needed. Daily intakes of 4 times a day or more are particularly challenging as this likely 
includes dosing at night. 
Sibnayal is a fixed combination medicinal product of prolonged-release granules of potassium citrate 
and potassium hydrogen carbonate (8 and 24 mEq sachets) for which the following therapeutic 
indication was proposed: “Sibnayal is indicated for the treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) 
in patients aged 6 months and older.” Treatment in patients below one year of age had not been 
evaluated and the single patient of one year of age treated discontinued treatment due to issues with 
treatment acceptability. Therefore, the CHMP questioned the appropriateness for use of Sibnayal in 
very young patients also because the current sachets cannot be applied in case of the presence of a 
feeding tube. It was acknowledged by the committee that intake of such granules depends on the 
maturity of the individual child and infant for swallowing but agreed with the applicant to amend the to 
be treated patient population to patients aged one year and older. 
Combining these two different alkalising agents (potassium citrate (CK) and potassium bicarbonate 
(BK)) gives ADV7103 the potential to control of metabolic acidosis and its consequences, while also 
providing potassium supplementation, and when combined in a prolonged-release formulation, a twice-
daily (BID) administration would allow control throughout the day and night. Further, the formulation 
would also provide bad taste masking. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study (B21CS) is a multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority, sequential study and aimed to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and acceptability of ADV7103 compared to SoC care in dRTA 
patients (n=34). The study included three study phases (SP) as follows: enrolled patients were to 
continue their SoC (possible variety of use of salts 3 to 6 times a day) without modification during a 5-
days period (SPI), and were subsequently crossed-over and titrated with ADV7103 to an optimal dose 
for up to 30 days (SP II) to control their bicarbonate levels, followed by a 5 days steady state period 
(SPIII) once stable control was reached. Effect of treatment was compared based on the steady state 
of SoC (SPI) versus steady state of ADV7103 (SPIII). 
This study was followed by an open-label extension study (B22CS) for longer-term (24 months) 
evaluation of safety, tolerability and efficacy of ADV7103 in those patients that rolled over from the 
pivotal study. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
With ADV7103 treatment, the primary endpoint showed that the mean (SD) plasma bicarbonate pre-
dose levels during 3 days of treatment at steady state were 23.1 (1.62) mmol/L with 90% (26/29) of 
the patients achieving 3-day mean normal carbonate levels. This effect was generally maintained 
during 24 months of therapy, although some variability was observed with responder rate of 56-92%. 
Also, almost all patients (29 of 30) remained on therapy during the 24 months. The effect was 
demonstrated for age categories of children, adolescents and adults, although normal levels could still 
not be reached for infants (21.8 mmol/L). The mean plasma potassium level was well within the 
normal range (4.0 mmol/L) and was maintained during 24 months of therapy, with 82-84% of the 
patients within a normal range.  
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 84/91 
 
 
 
As far as comparison is allowed (see limitations below under section 5.3), the results with ADV7103 
appears approximately comparable with SoC with a mean (SD) plasma bicarbonate pre-dose levels 
during 3 days of treatment at steady state of 21.7 (3.06) mmol/L with 45% (13/29) of the patients at 
target level, with only adults (24.1 mmol/L) being well controlled and adolescents (21.6 mmol/L), 
children (19.9 mmol/L) and infants (19.9 mmol/L) slightly below normal range. Potassium levels 
appear also comparable (mean 3.7 mmol/L; 82% at normal levels).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although non-inferiority was demonstrated (mean difference (95% CI) of 1.42 (0.41, 2.43) mmol/L, 
p<0.0001 for bicarbonate levels) and superiority was also reached with an adjusted mean difference 
(95% CI) of 1.64 (0.67, 2.60) mmol/L, p=0.0008 and confirmed with two imputation and a tipping 
point analyses, important limitations in the study design and conduct have been identified that limits 
conclusions on any non-inferiority and superiority claim, despite that the study design complied 
generally with earlier CHMP/SAWP and EMA/PDCO advices. Firstly, the assumption is made that 
patients were on an optimal SoC dose based on their long-term usual care without any interference 
during the 5 days follow-up. Further, a titration phase (up to 30 days) for ADV7103 has been applied 
to establish the optimal dose, which could inappropriately favour ADV7103 in comparison to SoC. 
Secondly, the sequential cross-over design further limits evaluation and interpretation for a direct 
comparison in time of SoC with ADV7103.  
Treatment in patients below one year of age had not been evaluated and the single patient of one year 
of age treated discontinued treatment due to issues with treatment acceptability. Therefore, the CHMP 
questioned the appropriateness for use of Sibnayal in very young patients also because the current 
sachets cannot be applied in case of the presence of a feeding tube. It was acknowledged by the 
committee that intake of such granules depends on the maturity of the individual child and infant for 
swallowing but agreed with the applicant to amend the to be treated patient population to patients 
aged one year and older. 
The primary efficacy findings on bicarbonate levels generally showed consistent effect with the overall 
effect when comparing ADV7103 to the subgroups of SoC treatment including bicarbonate (2.28 
mmol/L), combination citrate + bicarbonate (2.14 mmol/L), and comparison to sodium (1.90 mmol/L), 
potassium (0.33 mmol/L) or both of them (2.73 mmol/L). However, SoC treatment with citrate 
appeared to demonstrate slightly better results than ADV7103 (-0.07 mmol/L).  
Comparison for urinary endpoints showed a lower proportion with hypocitraturia for ADV7103 (10/16 
(62.5%)) vs SoC (15/16 (94%)) and a higher responder proportion with normal UCa/UCi values for 
ADV7103 (11/19 (58%)) than for SoC (3/19 (16%). This did not translate in a clear beneficial impact 
of ADV7103 on several disease characteristics. Nephrocalcinosis increased from 86% to 97% (i.e. one 
patient developed nephrocalcinosis during the B22CS trial). Further, no impact has been observed for 
nephrolithiasis, bone alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, vitamin D, calcium, parathyroid hormone, and 
calcitonin. Seven patients have shown a negative change in Z-score of the BMD from baseline to the 
end of the study, but this may inherent to the underlying disease. Further, no impact has been seen on 
stature and growth, or pubertal maturity. 
During long term therapy exploratory evaluation showed improved perception of efficacy (91.2%), 
safety (72.2%), taste (68.6%) and more appropriate formulation (83.9%), and more convenient 
number of daily dose intakes (90.2%). However, these data should be taken with caution due to 
potential bias (e.g. information and recall bias) and the way questions were perceived which tend to be 
suggestive in favour of ADV7103 (e.g. “As compared to your previous alkalinising treatment, what 
Assessment report  
EMA/1419/2021  
Page 85/91 
 
 
 
is/are the reason(s) for which you prefer keep ADV7103 rather than your previous alkalinising 
product?”). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, during the short steady state period with ADV7103 (SPIII period) frequency of adverse events 
were 18.8%, with only 1 (3.1%) AE considered treatment related. Due to the longer follow-up period 
of 24 months in the OLE study more adverse events were reported than during the short-term pivotal 
study (90%), although treatment related events were limited to 5 patients (16.7%). The incidence of 
AEs was highest during the titration period with ADV7103 treatment with 19 (55.9%) AEs. For short-
term SoC treatment, adverse events were reported for 18.9% and only 4 (10.8%) of AEs were 
treatment related.  
In line with the currently known safety profile of the separate active substances of potassium citrate 
and potassium bicarbonate, most common adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (16 patients 
(43.2%)), including abdominal pain (8 (21.6%)), upper abdominal pain ((5 (13.5%)), diarrhoea (3 
(8.1%)), vomiting (3 (8.1%)), and nausea (2 (5.4%)) being mostly observed, mainly during the 
titration phase with ADV7103 13 (38.2%) vs 1 (3.1%) during steady state ADV7103 and 5 (13.5%) 
with SoC. During steady state, only the abdominal pain AEs (1 (3.1%) with ADV7103 and 3 (8.1%) 
with SoC) were considered treatment related. Another frequently reported adverse event was 
headache (2 (6.3%) during steady state ADV7103 and 2 (5.4%) with SoC), but this was not 
considered related to treatment. The long-term study confirmed the high frequency of gastrointestinal 
adverse events (12 (40%) including abdominal pain (3 (13.3%), vomiting (3 (10%)), diarrhoea (2 
(7%)) and upper abdominal pain (2 (7%)). However, only in 5 patients (16.7%), GI symptoms were 
considered treatment related. Further, vitamin D deficiency (12 (40%)) and hypokalaemia (3 (10%)) 
were also frequently reported, likely associated with the underlying disease characteristics. The section 
4.8 of the SmPC is therefore listing abdominal pain with a frequency very common and upper 
abdominal pain, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal pain, nausea and 
vomiting with a frequency common.  
No patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events during 24 months of treatment with 
ADV7103.  
Serious adverse events are limited, with one patient with gastroenteritis in an adolescent observed 
during the short-term pivotal study and resolved within 24 hours and 4 patients (13.3%) during the 
extension open label phase (renal colic (in an adult), gastritis and wisdom teeth removal (in an 
adolescents) and gastroenteritis rotavirus (in an infant)), but these were all considered unrelated to 
treatment, resolved within the following days and no dose changes were performed. Reassuringly, no 
deaths occurred during the studies. 
Any risk for hyperkalaemia appears to be limited. Only one isolated case of hyperkalaemia of 
4.7 mmol/L was reported in 1 child at Day 2 t0 of steady state ADV7103 treatment with no other 
episodes of hyperkalaemia during the rest of treatment. However, due to the severity of potential 
clinical consequences hyperkalaemia and renal impairment with GFR ≤ 44 mL/min/1.73m² are 
contraindications. Furthermore, the product information includes appropriate warning statements to 
use Sibnayal with caution in conditions pre-disposing them to hyperkalaemia as a further rise in 
plasma potassium may lead to cardiac arrest. In addition, the “risk of hyperkalaemia when used in 
patients with comorbidities such as renal impairment” is listed as an important identified risk in the risk 
management plan.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety of ADV7103 has only been studied in 34 patients in the short-term and 30 patients during 
24 months. 
The incidence of AEs was highest during the titration period of ADV7103 (19 (56%), but this did not 
lead to limiting patients in reaching appropriate bicarbonate levels.  
Due to the low number of subjects for each age category no conclusion can be drawn for the individual 
adverse events observed across these different age categories.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Maintaining blood bicarbonate levels within the normal ranges in patients with dRTA is considered of 
important clinical relevance to correct metabolic acidosis and potentially reduce morbidity 
(nephrocalcinosis, lithiasis, bone remodelling and growth/development in children) and mortality, as 
best demonstrated for the separate active substances of these alkalising medicinal products. In the 
current study, a clinically relevant treatment effect has been observed of Sibnayal (ADV7103) 
prolonged-release granules, dosed twice daily, in the maintenance of blood bicarbonate levels, in 
adults, adolescents and children >12 months of age, remaining over a long-time period (24 months) 
without patient discontinuing their intended life-long treatment. Based on the known mechanism of 
action, this treatment effect was expected. dTRA generally presents with hypokalaemia. The use of 
potassium as cation shows that potassium levels were generally maintained at the lower site of the 
normal range, without an observed risk for hyperkalaemia.  
It should however be mentioned, that a formal claim on non-inferiority and superiority cannot be made 
due to several issues on the robustness of the study design and conduct, such as the concerns found 
around a lack of titration for an optimal dose for SoC treatment, as comparator and the sequential 
study design. 
The treatment effect, including a 24-hour effect coverage, has been obtained with twice-daily dosing of 
Sibnayal, which may waive the need for possible dosing at night with current therapies, which 
sometimes need a 3 to 6 times daily dosing. Although not fully demonstrated by clinical data, the 
combination of the citrate (for the first three hours) and the bicarbonate (after passing the stomach to 
about twelve hours after intake), as observed in in-vitro dissolution data, would allow for a more 
consistent and complete alkalising effect over the twelve hours for twice daily dosing, than each mono-
component could achieve. 
Any other beneficial impact of ADV7103 on several (longer term) disease characteristics including urine 
calcium and urine citrate, and nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, and bone parameters, stature and 
growth could not be clearly observed. This may likely be explained by the fact that patients were 
already (almost) controlled with SoC and no major improvement in bicarbonate control was seen with 
ADV7103. Also, any potential calcium chelating effect of potassium citrate may not be sufficiently 
effective when only a twice-a-day 3-4-hour effect is covered. 
The safety profile of Sibnayal in patients with dRTA was comparable to that of SoC treatment. It is 
mainly characterised by gastrointestinal adverse events but seem not to compromise long term 
treatment as none of the patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events during 2 years of 
treatment. Frequencies of serious adverse events were limited and did not seem to compromise 
treatment continuation. Overall, no new or unexpected safety signals were identified during the 
conduct of the study in the dRTA population, although the safety base is very limited. 
In light of absence of data in children <1 year the submitted data was considered by the CHMP to 
support positive B/R only in patients >1 year old. Therefore, the applicant agreed to apply for 
treatment in patients > 1 year old.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
An overall treatment effect of plasma bicarbonate levels within the normal range was observed in 
adults, adolescents and children >12 months of age with dRTA during 24 months of treatment with 
Sibnayal, which is of clinical relevance, also in terms of responder rates. The safety and tolerability 
profile of Sibnayal is considered acceptable.  
The benefit/risk of Sibnayal is considered positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Sibnayal is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Sibnayal is favourable in the following indication: 
“Sibnayal is indicated for the treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) in adults, adolescents 
and children aged one year and older” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Substitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and 
psychological treatment. The intention of the naloxone component is to deter intravenous misuse. 
Zubsolv is indicated in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to be treated for 
addiction. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment must be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opioid 
dependence/addiction. 
Zubsolv is not interchangeable with other buprenorphine products, as different buprenorphine 
products have different bioavailability. Therefore, the dose in mg can differ between products. Once 
the appropriate dose has been identified for a patient with a specific buprenorphine product, that 
product should not be exchanged with another product. 
If a patient is changed between buprenorphine or buprenorphine and naloxone containing 
products, dose adjustments may be necessary due to the potential differences in bioavailability 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Use of multiples of the three lower dose presentations of Zubsolv to substitute for any of the three 
higher dose presentations (in for example cases where the higher dose presentations are 
temporarily not available) is not recommended (see section 5.2). 
Precautions to be taken before induction 
Prior to treatment initiation, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. 
long- or short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use and the degree of opioid dependence. To 
avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenorphine only 
should be undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident (demonstrated e.g. by 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a score indicating mild to moderate withdrawal on the validated Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale, 
COWS). 
• 
For patients dependent upon heroin or short-acting opioids, the first dose of 
buprenorphine/naloxone must be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than 6 
hours after the patient last used opioids. 
For patients receiving methadone, the dose of methadone must be reduced to a maximum of 30 
mg/day before beginning buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. The long half-life of methadone 
should be considered when starting buprenorphine/naloxone. The first dose of 
buprenorphine/naloxone should be taken only when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less 
than 24 hours after the patient last used methadone. Buprenorphine may precipitate symptoms 
of withdrawal in patients dependent upon methadone. 
• 
Posology 
Initiation therapy (induction) 
The recommended starting dose in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age is 1.4 mg/0.36 mg or 
2.9 mg/0.71 mg a day. An additional Zubsolv 1.4 mg/0.36 mg or 2.9 mg/0.71 mg may be 
administered on day one depending on the individual patient’s requirement. 
During the initiation of treatment, daily supervision of dosing is recommended to ensure proper 
sublingual placement of the dose and to observe patient response to treatment as a guide to effective 
dose titration according to clinical effect. 
Dosage stabilisation  and maintenance therapy 
Following treatment induction on day 1, the patient must be rapidly stabilised on an adequate 
maintenance dose by titrating to achieve a dose that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses 
opioid withdrawal effects and is guided by reassessment of the clinical and psychological status of  
the patient. The maximum single daily dose should not exceed 17.2 mg buprenorphine (e.g. given as 
11.4 + 5.7 mg, 2 x 8.6 mg or 3 x 5.7 mg). 
During maintenance therapy, it may be necessary to periodically restabilise the patient on a new  
maintenance dose in response to changing patient needs. 
The 0.7 mg/0.18 mg strength is intended to be used to fine tune the dose for patients especially 
during tapering of treatment or in case of tolerability issues during titration. 
Physicians are encouraged to prescribe a single tablet once daily regimen where possible to minimise 
risk of diversion. 
Less than daily dosing 
After a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved the frequency of Zubsolv dosing may be 
decreased to dosing every other day at twice the individually titrated daily dose. In some patients, 
after a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, the frequency of dosing may be decreased to 3 
times a week (for example on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The dose on Monday and 
Wednesday should be twice the individually titrated daily dose, and the dose on Friday should be 
three times the individually titrated daily dose, with no dose on the intervening days.) However, the 
dose given on any one day should not exceed 17.2 mg buprenorphine. Patients requiring a titrated 
daily dose > 5.7 mg buprenorphine /day may not find this regimen adequate. 
Medical withdrawal 
After a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, if the patient agrees, the dose may be reduced 
gradually to a lower maintenance dose; in some favourable cases, treatment may be discontinued. 
The availability of six different tablet strengths supports individual dose titration and tapering. 
Patients should be monitored following medical withdrawal because of the potential for relapse. 
Special populations 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in elderly patients over 65 years of age have not 
been established. No recommendation on posology can be made. 
Hepatic impairment 
As buprenorphine/naloxone pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment, 
lower initial doses and careful dose titration in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment are 
recommended (see section 5.2). Buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (see sections 4.3 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Modification of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose is not required in patients with renal impairment. 
Caution is recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 
30 ml/min) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in children below the age of 15 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Physicians must warn patients that the sublingual route is the only effective and safe route of 
administration for this medicinal product (see section 4.4). The tablet is to be placed under the tongue 
until completely dissolved. Patients should not swallow or consume food or drink until the tablet is 
completely dissolved. 
Zubsolv disintegrates usually within 40 seconds, however it may take 5 to 10 minutes for the patient 
to feel complete tablet disappearance from the mouth. 
If more than one tablet is required, they may be taken all at the same time or in two divided portions; 
the second portion is to be taken directly after the first portion has dissolved. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Severe respiratory insufficiency. 
Severe hepatic impairment. 
Acute alcoholism or delirium tremens. 
Concomitant administration of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, nalmefene) for the treatment of 
alcohol or opioid dependence. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Misuse, abuse and diversion 
Buprenorphine can be misused or abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Some 
risks of misusers and abusers include overdose, spread of blood borne viral or localised and systemic 
infections, respiratory depression and hepatic injury. Buprenorphine misuse by someone other than 
the intended patient poses the additional risk of new drug dependent individuals using buprenorphine 
as the primary drug of abuse, and may occur if the medicinal product is distributed for illicit use 
directly by the intended patient or if the medicinal product is not safeguarded against theft. 
Sub-optimal treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone may prompt medicinal product misuse by the 
patient, leading to overdose or treatment dropout. A patient who is under-dosed with 
buprenorphine/naloxone may continue responding to uncontrolled withdrawal symptoms by self-
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medicating with opioids, alcohol or other sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines. 
To minimize the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion, appropriate precautions should be taken when 
prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine, such as to avoiding prescribing multiple refills early in 
treatment, and to conducting patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring that is appropriate to 
the patient's needs. 
Combining buprenorphine with naloxone in Zubsolv is intended to deter misuse and abuse of the 
buprenorphine. Intravenous or intranasal misuse of Zubsolv is expected to be less likely than with 
buprenorphine alone since the naloxone in Zubsolv can precipitate withdrawal in individual’s 
dependent on heroin, methadone, or other opioid agonists. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and sleep-
related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients 
who present with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dosage. 
Respiratory depression 
A number of cases of death due to respiratory depression have been reported, particularly when 
buprenorphine was used in combination with benzodiazepines (see section 4.5) or when 
buprenorphine was not used according to the prescribing information. Deaths have also been 
reported in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such 
as alcohol or other opioids. If buprenorphine is administered to some non-opioid dependent 
individuals, who are not tolerant to the effects of opioids, potentially fatal respiratory depression may 
occur. 
This medicinal product should be used with care in patients with asthma or respiratory insufficiency 
(e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, 
hypercapnia, pre-existing respiratory depression or kyphoscoliosis (curvature of spine leading to 
potential  shortness of breath)). 
Buprenorphine/naloxone may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and 
non-dependent persons in case of accidental or deliberate ingestion. Patients must be warned to store 
the blister safely, to never open the blister in advance, to keep them out of the reach of children and 
other household members, and not to take this medicinal product in front of children. An emergency 
unit should be contacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or suspicion of ingestion. 
Central Nervous System (CNS) depression 
Buprenorphine/naloxone may cause drowsiness, particularly when taken together with alcohol or 
central nervous system depressants (such as benzodiazepines, tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics 
see sections 4.5 and 4.7). 
Risk from concomitant use of sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or related 
medicinal products 
Concomitant use of buprenorphine/naloxone and sedative medicinal products such as 
benzodiazepines or related medicinal products may result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma 
and death. Because of these risks, concomitant prescribing with these sedative medicinal products 
should be reserved for patients for whom alternative treatment options are not possible. If a decision 
is made to prescribe buprenorphine/naloxone concomitantly with sedative medicinal products, the 
lowest effective dose of the sedative medicines should be used, and the duration of treatment should 
be as short as possible. The patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of 
respiratory depression and sedation. In this respect, it is strongly recommended to inform patients 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and their caregivers to be aware of these symptoms (see section 4.5). 
Serotonin syndrome 
Concomitant administration of Zubsolv and other serotonergic agents, such as MAO inhibitors, 
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors 
(SNRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants may result in serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening 
condition (see section 4.5). 
If concomitant treatment with other serotonergic agents is clinically warranted, careful observation 
of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. 
Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes, autonomic instability, 
neuromuscular abnormalities, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. 
If serotonin syndrome is suspected, a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy should be 
considered depending on the severity of the symptoms. 
Dependence 
Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the μ (mu)-opiate receptor and chronic administration produces 
dependence of the opioid type. Studies in animals, as well as clinical experience, have demonstrated 
that buprenorphine may produce dependence, but at a lower level than a full agonist e.g. morphine. 
Abrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in a withdrawal syndrome 
that may be delayed in onset. 
Hepatitis and hepatic events 
Cases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in opioid-dependent addicts both in clinical trials 
and in post marketing adverse reaction reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient 
asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, 
hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy and death. In many cases the presence of pre-existing 
mitochondrial impairment (genetic disease, liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or 
hepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia, concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal 
products) and ongoing injecting drug use may have a causative or contributory role. These 
underlying factors must be taken into consideration before prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone and 
during treatment.  
When a hepatic event is suspected, further biological and aetiological evaluation is required. 
Depending upon the findings, the medicinal product may be discontinued cautiously so as to prevent 
withdrawal symptoms and to prevent a return to illicit drug use. If the treatment is continued, hepatic 
function should be monitored closely. 
Precipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome 
When initiating treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone, the physician must be aware of the partial 
agonist profile of buprenorphine and that it can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients, 
particularly if administered less than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioid, 
or if administered less than 24 hours after the last dose of methadone. Patients should be clearly 
monitored during the switching period from buprenorphine or methadone to buprenorphine/naloxone 
since withdrawal symptoms have been reported. 
 To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine/naloxone should be undertaken 
when objective signs of withdrawal are evident (see section 4.2).  
Withdrawal symptoms may also be associated with sub-optimal dosing.

Hepatic impairment 
The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were 
evaluated in a post-marketing study. Since both buprenorphine and naloxone are extensively 
metabolized in liver, plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in 
patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects. Patients 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose 
caused by increased levels of naloxone and/or buprenorphine.  
Baseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status is recommended prior to 
commencing therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on concomitant medicinal 
products (see section 4.5) and/or have existing liver dysfunction are at greater risk of liver injury. 
Regular monitoring of liver function is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Zubsolv sublingual tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). In patients with severe hepatic insufficiency the use of 
buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Renal impairment 
Renal elimination may be prolonged since 30% of the administered dose is eliminated by the renal 
route. Metabolites of buprenorphine accumulate in patients with renal failure. Caution is 
recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
CYP 3A4 inhibitors 
Medicinal products that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 may give rise to increased concentrations of 
buprenorphine. A reduction of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose may be needed. Patients already 
treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors should have their dose of buprenorphine/naloxone titrated carefully 
since a reduced dose may be sufficient in these patients (see section 4.5). 
Class effects 
Opioids may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 
Opioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures, so opioids should be  used 
with  caution  in  patients  with  head  injury,  intracranial  lesions,  in  other  circumstances  where 
cerebrospinal pressure may be increased, or in patients with a history of seizure. 
Opioids should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral 
stenosis. 
Opioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness, or changes in the perception of pain as 
a symptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical course 
of concomitant disease. 
Opioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal 
cortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease). 
Opioids have been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, and should be used with caution in 
patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 
Opioids should be administered with caution to elderly or debilitated  patients. 
The concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce an exaggeration of the 
effects of opioids, based on experience with morphine (see section 4.5).

Changing between buprenorphine containing products 
The dose in mg can differ between buprenorphine products and products are not directly 
interchangeable. Therefore, patients should be monitored when changing between different 
buprenorphine containing products as differences in bioavailability (see section 5.2) may be 
noticeable in some individual cases. Dose adjustments may therefore be necessary. 
Paediatric population 
Use in adolescents (age 15 - <18 years) 
Due to the lack of data in adolescents (age 15 - <18 years), patients in this age group should be more 
closely monitored during treatment. 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Zubsolv must not be taken together with: 
Zubsolv should not be taken together with: 
• 
Alcoholic drinks or medicinal products containing alcohol, as alcohol increases the 
sedative effect of buprenorphine (see section 4.7). 
Zubsolv should be used cautiously when co-administered with: 
• 
Sedatives such as benzodiazepines or related medicinal products 
The concomitant use of opioids with sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or 
related medicinal products increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and 
death because of additive CNS depressant effect. The dose and duration of concomitant use 
of sedative medicinal products should be limited (see section 4.4). Patients should be 
warned that it is extremely dangerous to self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines 
while taking this medicinal product and should also be cautioned to use benzodiazepines 
concurrently with this medicinal product only as directed by their physician (see 
section 4.4). 
Other central nervous system depressants, other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, 
analgesics and antitussives), certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, 
barbiturates, anxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related 
substances: these combinations increase central nervous system depression. The reduced 
level of alertness can make driving and using machines hazardous. 
Furthermore, adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full opioid 
agonist in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone. Therefore the potential to overdose 
with a full agonist exists, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial 
agonist effects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining 
Serotonergic medicinal products, such as MAO inhibitors, selective serotonin re-uptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or tricyclic 
antidepressants as the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, is 
increased (see section 4.4) 
naltrexone and nalmefene are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological effects 
of buprenorphine. Co-administration during buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is 
contraindicated due to the potentially dangerous interaction that may precipitate a sudden 
onset of prolonged and intense opioid withdrawal symptoms (see section 4.3). 
CYP3A4 inhibitors: an interaction study of buprenorphine with ketoconazole (a potent 
9 
• 
•

inhibitor of CYP3A4) resulted in increased Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) of 
buprenorphine (approximately 50 % and 70 % respectively) and, to a lesser extent, of 
norbuprenorphine Patients receiving Zubsolv should be closely monitored, and may require 
dose-reduction if combined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like 
ritonavir, nelfinavir or indinavir or azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole,  
macrolide antibiotics). 
CYP3A4 inducers: Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with buprenorphine may 
decrease buprenorphine plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in sub-optimal 
treatment of opioid dependence with buprenorphine. It is recommended that patients 
receiving buprenorphine/naloxone should be closely monitored if inducers (e.g. 
phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered. The dose of 
buprenorphine or the CYP3A4 inducer may need to be adjusted accordingly. 
The concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce 
exaggeration of the effects of opioids, based on experience with morphine.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of buprenorphine/naloxone in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans 
is unknown. 
Towards the end of pregnancy buprenorphine may induce respiratory depression in the newborn 
infant even after a short period of administration. Long-term administration of buprenorphine during 
the last three months of pregnancy may cause a withdrawal syndrome in the neonate (e.g. hypertonia, 
neonatal tremor, neonatal agitation, myoclonus or convulsions). The syndrome is generally delayed 
for  several hours to several days after birth. 
Due to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring for several days should be considered 
at the end of pregnancy, to prevent the risk of respiratory depression or withdrawal syndrome in 
neonates. 
Furthermore, the use of buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy should be assessed by the 
physician. Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether naloxone/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Buprenorphine and its 
metabolites are excreted in human milk. In rat’s buprenorphine has been found to inhibit lactation. 
Therefore, breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with Zubsolv. 
Fertility 
Animal studies have shown a reduction in female fertility at high doses (systemic exposure > 
2.4 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 17.2 mg buprenorphine, based 
on AUC) (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Buprenorphine/naloxone has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines 
when administered to opioid dependent patients. This medicinal product may cause drowsiness, 
dizziness, or impaired thinking, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. If taken 
together with alcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more 
pronounced (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery in case 
buprenorphine/naloxone may adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported treatment related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical 
trials were constipation and symptoms commonly associated with drug withdrawal (i.e. insomnia, 
headache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain). Some reports of seizure, vomiting, diarrhoea, and 
elevated liver function tests were considered serious.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
In cases of intravenous drug misuse, some adverse reactions are attributed to the act of misuse rather 
than the medicinal product and include local reactions, sometimes septic (abscess, cellulitis), and 
potentially serious acute hepatitis, and other infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis have been 
reported (see section 4.4). 
In patients presenting with marked drug dependence, initial administration of buprenorphine can 
produce a drug withdrawal syndrome similar to that associated with naloxone (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Respiratory depression as a result of central nervous system depression is the primary symptom 
requiring intervention in the case of overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest and death. 
Signs of overdose may also include somnolence, amblyopia, miosis, hypotension, nausea, vomiting 
and/or speech disorders. 
Management 
General supportive measures should be initiated, including close monitoring of respiratory and 
cardiac status of the patient. Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression and standard intensive 
care measures should be implemented. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation must be 
assured. The patient should be transferred to an environment within which full resuscitation facilities 
are available. 
If the patient vomits, care must be taken to prevent aspiration of the vomitus. 
Use of an opioid antagonist (i.e., naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in 
reversing the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine compared with its effects on full agonist opioid 
agents. 
If naloxone is used, the long duration of action of buprenorphine should be taken into consideration 
when determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an 
overdose. Naloxone can be eliminated more rapidly than buprenorphine, allowing for a return of 
previously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms, so a continuing infusion may be necessary.  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If infusion is not possible, repeated dosing with naloxone may be required. Ongoing intravenous 
infusion rates should be titrated to patient response.

5.1 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in addictive disorders, ATC 
code: N07BC51. 
Mechanism of action 
Buprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist/antagonist which binds to the μ and κ (kappa) opioid 
receptors of the brain. Its activity in opioid maintenance treatment is attributed to its slowly reversible 
properties with the μ-opioid receptors which, over a prolonged period, might minimise the need of 
addicted patients for drugs. 
Opioid agonist ceiling effects were observed during clinical pharmacology studies in opioid-
dependent patients. 
Naloxone is an antagonist at μ-opioid receptors. When administered orally or sublingually in usual 
doses to patients experiencing opioid withdrawal, naloxone exhibits little or no pharmacological 
effect because of its almost complete first pass metabolism. However, when administered 
intravenously to opioid-dependent patients the presence of naloxone in Zubsolv produces marked 
opioid antagonist effects and opioid withdrawal, thereby deterring intravenous abuse. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy and safety data for buprenorphine/naloxone are primarily derived from a one-year clinical 
trial, comprising a 4-week randomised double blind comparison of buprenorphine/naloxone, 
buprenorphine and placebo followed by a 48 week safety study of buprenorphine/naloxone. In this 
trial, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either buprenorphine/naloxone 16 mg 
per day, 16 mg buprenorphine per day or placebo. For subjects randomised to either active treatment, 
dosing began with 8 mg of buprenorphine on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg) of buprenorphine 
on Day 2. On Day 3, those randomised to receive buprenorphine/naloxone were switched to the 
combination tablet. Subjects were seen daily in the clinic (Monday through Friday) for dosing and 
efficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends. The primary study comparison 
was to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone individually against 
placebo. The percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples that were negative for non-study opioids was 
statistically higher for both buprenorphine/naloxone versus placebo (p < 0.0001) and buprenorphine 
versus placebo (p < 0.0001). 
In a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine ethanolic solution 
versus a full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomised to receive the ethanolic sublingual 
solution of buprenorphine at 8 mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day 
of buprenorphine/naloxone), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low 
enough to serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3 to10 day induction phase, a 16-week 
maintenance phase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance 
dose by Day 3; active control doses were titrated more gradually. Based on retention in treatment and 
the percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was 
more effective than the low dose of the control, in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in 
reducing their use of opioids while in treatment. The effectiveness of buprenorphine, 8 mg per day 
was similar to that of the moderate active control dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Zubsolv disintegrates usually within 40 seconds, however it may take 5 to 10 minutes for the patient 
to feel complete tablet disappearance from the mouth. 
Zubsolv sublingual tablets have a higher bioavailability than conventional sublingual tablets. 
Therefore the dose in mg can differ between products. Zubsolv is not interchangeable with other 
buprenorphine products. 
In comparative bioavailability studies Zubsolv 11.4/2.9 mg displayed equivalent buprenorphine 
exposure to 16/4mg (2 x 8/2mg) buprenorphine/naloxone administered as conventional sublingual 
tablets however Zubsolv 2 x 1.4/0.36 mg displayed 20% lower buprenorphine exposure to 2 x 
2/0.5 mg buprenorphine/naloxone administered as conventional sublingual tablets. Naloxone 
exposure was not higher from Zubsolv at any of the tested dose levels. 
Buprenorphine 
Absorption 
Buprenorphine, when taken orally, undergoes first-pass metabolism with N-dealkylation and 
glucuroconjugation in the small intestine and the liver. The use of this medicinal product by the oral 
route is therefore inappropriate. 
There are small deviations in buprenorphine dose proportionality exposure parameters as well as 
deviations from strict compositional proportionality for the three lower strengths (2.9/0.71, 1.4/0.36, 
and 0.7/0.18 mg) compared to the three higher dose presentations. Therefore, multiples of the three 
lower dose presentations of Zubsolv should not be used to substitute for any of the three higher dose 
Zubsolv presentations. 
Peak plasma concentrations are achieved approximately 90 minutes after sublingual administration. 
Plasma levels of buprenorphine increased with increasing the sublingual dose of 
buprenorphine/naloxone. Both Cmax and AUC of buprenorphine increased with the increase in dose, 
although the increase was less than dose-proportional. 
Distribution 
The absorption of buprenorphine is followed by a rapid distribution phase (distribution half-life of 2 
to 5 hours). 
Buprenorphine is highly lipophilic, which leads to rapid penetration of the blood-brain barrier.  
Buprenorphine is approximately 96 % protein bound, primarily to alpha and beta globulin. 
Biotransformation 
Buprenorphine is primarily metabolised through -N-dealkylation by liver microsomal CYP3A4. the 
parent molecule and the primary dealkylated metabolite, norbuprenorphine, undergo subsequent 
glucuronidation. Norbuprenorphine binds to opioid receptors in vitro; however, it is not known 
whether norbuprenorphine contributes to the overall effect of buprenorphine/naloxone.  
Elimination 
Elimination of buprenorphine is bi- or tri-exponential, and the a mean terminal elimination half-life 
from plasma of 32 hours. 
Buprenorphine is excreted in the faeces (~70 %) by biliary excretion of the glucuroconjugated 
metabolites, the rest (~30 %) being eliminated in the urine. 
Naloxone 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Absorption  
Following sublingual administration of buprenorphine/naloxone, plasma naloxone concentrations are 
low and decline rapidly. Naloxone mean peak plasma concentrations were too low to assess dose-
proportionality. Naloxone has not been found to affect the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine. 
Distribution 
Naloxone is approximately 45 % protein bound, primarily to albumin. 
Biotransformation 
Naloxone is metabolised in the liver, primarily by glucuronide conjugation, and excreted in the urine. 
Naloxone undergoes direct glucuronidation to naloxone 3-glucuronide, as well as N-dealkylation and 
reduction of the 6-oxo group.  
Elimination  
Naloxone is excreted in the urine, with a mean half-life of elimination from plasma ranging from 0.9 
to 9 hours. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No pharmacokinetic data in elderly patients are available. 
Renal impairment 
Renal elimination plays a relatively small role (~30%) in the overall clearance of 
buprenorphine/naloxone. No dose modification based on renal function is required but caution is 
recommended when dosing subjects with severe renal impairment (see section 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were 
evaluated in a post-marketing study. 
Table 2 summarizes the results from a clinical trial in which the exposure after single-dose 
administration of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet was determined in healthy subjects, and 
in subjects with varied degree of hepatic impairment.

Overall, buprenorphine plasma exposure increased approximately 3-fold in patients with severely 
impaired hepatic function, while naloxone plasma exposure increased 14-fold with severely impaired 
hepatic function. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The combination of buprenorphine and naloxone has been investigated in acute and repeated dose 
(up to 90 days in rats) toxicity studies in animals. No synergistic enhancement of toxicity has been 
observed. Undesirable effects were based on the known pharmacological activity of opioid agonistic 
and/or antagonistic substances. 
The combination (4:1) of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride was not 
mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay (Ames test), and was not clastogenic in an in vitro 
cytogenetic assay in human lymphocytes or in an intravenous micronucleus test in the rat. 
Reproduction studies by oral administration of buprenorphine: naloxone (ratio 1:1) indicated that 
embryolethality occurred in rats in the presence of maternal toxicity at all doses. The lowest dose 
studied represented exposure multiples of 1x for buprenorphine and 5 x for naloxone at the maximum 
human therapeutic dose calculated on a mg/m² basis. No developmental toxicity was observed in 
rabbits at maternally toxic doses. Further, no teratogenicity has been observed in either rats or 
rabbits. A peri-postnatal study has not been conducted with buprenorphine/naloxone; however, 
maternal oral administration of buprenorphine at high doses during gestation and lactation resulted in 
difficult parturition (possible as a result of the sedative effect of buprenorphine), high neonatal 
mortality and a slight delay in the development of some neurological functions (surface righting 
reflex and startle response) in neonatal rats. 
Dietary administration of buprenorphine/naloxone in the rat at dose levels of 500 ppm or greater 
produced a reduction in fertility demonstrated by reduced female conception rates. A dietary dose of 
100 ppm (estimated exposure approximately 2.4 x for buprenorphine at a human dose of 17.2 mg 
buprenorphine/naloxone based on AUC, plasma levels of naloxone were below the limit of detection 
in rats) had no adverse effect on fertility in females. 
A carcinogenicity study with buprenorphine/naloxone was conducted in rats at doses of 7, 30 and 
120 mg/kg/day, with estimated exposure multiples of 3 to75 times, based on a Zubsolv equivalent 
human daily sublingual dose of 11.4 mg of buprenorphine calculated on a mg/m² basis. Statistically 
significant increases in the incidence of benign testicular interstitial (Leydig's) cell adenomas were 
observed in all dose groups.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Zubsolv is and what it is used for 
Zubsolv contains the active substances buprenorphine and naloxone. Zubsolv is used to treat 
dependence on opioid (narcotic) drugs such as heroin or morphine in drug addicts who have agreed 
to be treated for their addiction. Zubsolv is used in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age, 
who are also receiving medical, social and psychological support. 
How Zubsolv works 
The tablet contains buprenorphine which is responsible for the treatment of opioid (narcotic) 
dependence. It also contains naloxone which is used to deter intravenous abuse of the product. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Zubsolv 
Do not take Zubsolv if you: 
- 
are allergic to buprenorphine, naloxone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6) 
have serious breathing problems 
have serious liver problems 
are intoxicated due to alcohol or have trembling, sweating, anxiety, confusion, or 
hallucinations caused by alcohol 
are taking naltrexone or nalmefene for the treatment of alcohol or opioid dependence

Warnings and precautions 
•  Misuse, abuse and diversion 
 Serious cases of infections with potential fatal outcome may occur if Zubsolv is misused, by taking it 
intravenously. 
This medicine can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines, and should be kept in a 
safe place to protect it from theft (see section 5). Do not give this medicine to anyone else. It can 
cause death or otherwise harm them. 
Breathing problems (see also ‘Do not take Zubsolv’ above ) 
• 
Some people have died from respiratory failure (inability to breathe) because they misused this 
medicine or took it in combination with other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, 
benzodiazepines (tranquilisers), or other opioids. 
This medicine should be used with care in patients with pre-existing breathing problems 
This medicine may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression (reduced ability to breathe) 
in children and non-opioid dependent people who accidentally or deliberately take it. 
Drowsiness 
• 
This medicine can cause drowsiness, particularly when taken together with alcohol or other central 
nervous system depressants (such as tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics). 
Dependence 
• 
This medicine can cause dependence. 
Liver damage 
• 
Liver damage has been reported after taking buprenorphine/naloxone, especially when the medicine 
is misused. This could also be due to viral infections (chronic hepatitis C), alcohol abuse, anorexia 
or use of other medicines that can harm your liver (see section 4). Regular blood tests may be 
conducted by your doctor to monitor the condition of your liver. Tell your doctor if you have any 
liver problems before you start treatment with Zubsolv. 
•  Withdrawal symptoms 
This medicine can cause withdrawal symptoms if you take it less than six hours after you use a 
short-acting opioid (e.g. morphine, heroin) or less than 24 hours after you use a long-acting 
opioid such as methadone. 
Zubsolv can also cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it abruptly. 
Blood pressure 
• 
This medicine may cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly, causing you to feel dizzy if you get 
up too quickly from sitting or lying down. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders  
• 
Zubsolv can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses during 
sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can include 
breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to maintain 
sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these symptoms, 
contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor. 
Children and adolescents 
• 
You may be more closely monitored by your doctor if you are below the age of 18. This medicine 
should not be taken by those under 15 years of age. 
•

This medicine may mask pain symptoms that could assist in the diagnosis of some diseases. Do not 
forget to advise your doctor if you take this medicine. 
Talk to your doctor before taking Zubsolv if you: 
• 
have a depression or other conditions that are treated with antidepressants. 
The use of these medicines together with Zubsolv can lead to serotonin syndrome, a 
potentially life-threatening condition (see “Other medicines and Zubsolv”) 
have kidney problems 
have recently suffered a head injury or brain disease 
have low blood pressure, enlarged prostate gland or difficulties passing water because 
of narrowing of the urethra 
have under-active thyroid gland which can cause tiredness or weight gain 
have poor adrenal gland function (e.g. Addison’s disease) 
have problems with the biliary tract (e.g. gall bladder, bile duct) 
are elderly 
are debilitated 
Other medicines and Zubsolv 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Some medicines may increase the side effects of Zubsolv and may sometimes cause very serious 
reactions. Do not take any other medicines whilst taking Zubsolv without first talking to your 
doctor, especially: 
• 
anti-depressants such as moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, 
fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, 
doxepine, or trimipramine. These medicines may interact with Zubsolv and you may 
experience symptoms such as involuntary, rhythmic contractions of muscles, including the 
muscles that control movement of the eye, agitation, hallucinations, coma, excessive 
sweating, tremor, exaggeration of reflexes, increased muscle tension, body temperature 
above 38°C. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms. 
Naltrexone and nalmefene (drugs used to treat addictive disorders) as they may prevent 
the  therapeutic  effects  of  Zubsolv.  They  must  not  be  taken  at  the  same  time  as  Zubsolv 
treatment because you may experience a sudden onset of prolonged and intense withdrawal. 
Benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders) such as diazepam, temazepam, 
alprazolam. Concomitant use of Zubsolv and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines 
or related drugs increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory 
depression), coma and may be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant use should 
only be considered when other treatment options are not possible. However if your doctor 
does prescribe Zubsolv together with sedative medicines the dose and duration of 
concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor. Please tell your doctor about all 
sedative medicines you are taking, and follow your doctor’s dose recommendation 
closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of the signs and 
symptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms. 
Other medicines that may make you feel sleepy which are used to treat illnesses such 
as anxiety, sleeplessness, convulsions/seizures, pain and other mental disorders. These 
types of medicines will reduce your alertness levels making it dangerous for you to drive 
and use machines. They may also cause central nervous system depression, which is very 
serious. Below is a list of examples of these types of medicines: 
- 
other opioid containing medicines such as methadone, certain pain killers and 
cough suppressants 
some anti-depressants (used to treat depression) such as isocarboxazid, phenelzine, 
selegiline, tranylcypromine, valproate and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) may 
increase the effects of this medicine 
sedative Hı receptor antagonists (used to treat allergic reactions) such as 
diphenhydramine and chlorphenamine 
barbiturates (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as phenobarbital, secobarbital 
- 
- 
- 
51 
 
 
 
- 
- 
tranquilisers (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as chloral hydrate 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure) and related medicines may extend the 
effects of this medicine 
anti-retrovirals (used to treat HIV) such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir may increase 
the effects of this medicine 
some antifungal agents (used to treat fungal infections) such as ketoconazole, itraconazole 
and certain antibiotics, may extend the effects of this medicine 
some medicines may decrease the effect of Zubsolv. These include medicines used to 
treat epilepsy (such as carbamazepine and phenytoin), and medicines used to treat 
tuberculosis (rifampicin) 
• 
• 
• 
Zubsolv with food, drink and alcohol 
Alcohol may increase drowsiness and may increase the risk of respiratory failure if taken with 
Zubsolv. Do not take Zubsolv together with alcohol. Do not swallow or consume food or any 
drink until the tablet is completely dissolved. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
The risks of using Zubsolv in pregnant women are not known. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or 
intend to become pregnant. Your doctor will decide if your treatment should be continued with an 
alternative medicine. 
When taken during pregnancy, particularly late pregnancy, medicines like Zubsolv may cause drug 
withdrawal symptoms including problems with breathing in your newborn baby. This may appear 
several days after birth. 
Do not breast-feed whilst taking this medicine, since Zubsolv passes into breast milk. Ask your 
doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Zubsolv may cause drowsiness, dizziness or impair your thinking. This may happen more often in 
the first few weeks of treatment when your dose is being changed, but can also happen if you drink 
alcohol or take other sedative medicines when you take Zubsolv. Do not drive, use any tools or 
machines, or perform dangerous activities until you know how this medicine affects you. 
Zubsolv contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3.  How to take Zubsolv 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your 
doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Your treatment is prescribed and monitored by doctors who are experienced in the treatment of drug 
dependence. 
Your doctor will determine the best dose for you. During your treatment, the doctor may adjust the 
dose, depending upon your response. 
Starting treatment 
The recommended starting dose for adults and adolescents over the age of 15 years is: 
- 
- 
one tablet of Zubsolv 1.4 mg/0.36 mg each day, or 
one tablet of Zubsolv 2.9 mg/0.71 mg each day 
An additional tablet of the Zubsolv 1.4 mg/0.36 mg or 2.9 mg/0.71 mg may be administered on Day 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 depending on your needs. 
There are other strengths that are available to be used by your doctor who will decide what is the 
best treatment for you. This may involve taking a combination of different strengths, but your daily 
dose should not exceed 17.2 mg of buprenorphine. 
Clear signs of withdrawal should be evident before taking your first dose of Zubsolv. A doctor’s 
assessment of your readiness for treatment will guide the timing of your first Zubsolv dose.

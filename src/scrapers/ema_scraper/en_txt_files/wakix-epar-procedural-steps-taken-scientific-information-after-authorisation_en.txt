1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

characterized. The major non-conjugated metabolites are 
hydroxylated derivatives in several positions and cleaved 
forms of pitolisant leading to inactive major carboxylic acid 
metabolite found in urine and serum. They are formed 
under the action of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Several 
conjugated metabolites were identified, the major ones 
(inactive) being two glycine conjugates of the acid

metabolite of pitolisant and a glucuronide of a ketone 
metabolite of monohydroxy desaturated pitolisant.    
On liver microsomes, pitolisant and its major metabolites 
do not significantly inhibit the activities of the cytochromes 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP2B6, CYP2E1 or 
CYP3A4 and of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl

systemic exposure (up to 3 fold) to pitolisant is observed in 
CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. In the up-titration scheme, 
dose increment should take into account this higher 
exposure. The exposure to pitolisant was higher in the 
CYP2D6 poor metabolisers after a single dose and at steady 
state; Cmax and AUC(0-tau) was approximately 2.7 fold

In a clinical multiple dose study, the combination of 
pitolisant with probenecid decreases the AUC of pitolisant 
by about 34%. 
The combination of pitolisant with modafinil or sodium

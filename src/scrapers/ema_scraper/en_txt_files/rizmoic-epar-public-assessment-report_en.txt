2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Opioid analgesics have been used extensively for the treatment of moderate to severe pain both in 
non-cancer and cancer pain.  However, opioid use is associated with a number of adverse events (AEs), 
with the most common occurring in the gastrointestinal system such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, 
abdominal cramping, bloating and abdominal pain.  Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most 
common adverse drug reaction (ADR) occurring with the chronic use of opioids. 
The signs and symptoms of OIC can significantly interfere with activities of daily living thereby adversely 
affecting the quality of life (QOL) of the patient, and may be even more distressing for the patient than the 
pain of the condition itself.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
In patients with chronic non-cancer pain receiving opioid therapy, OIC is the most commonly reported 
and undesirable side effect.  A systematic literature review revealed that approximately 40% to 50% of 
patients with chronic non-cancer pain receiving chronic opioids for pain experienced OIC.    
The prevalence of OIC in patients with cancer is very high, ranging from approximately 70% to 85% of 
patients with cancer taking opioids.  There is no (or extremely slow) development of tolerance to the 
constipating effects of opioid therapy, particularly with codeine, dihydrocodeine, morphine, fentanyl, 
oxycodone, and hydromorphone.   
Unrelieved constipation symptoms may add to the burden of pain and underlying illness, and may 
dissuade patients from using the required analgesic dose to achieve effective pain. The longer-term 
consequences of constipation can result in substantial morbidity (eg, rectal pain, bowel obstruction, 
rupture) and, in rare cases, death.  
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Opioid receptors are widely distributed in the human body.  The principal effect of opioids in the 
gastrointestinal tract is inhibition of gut motility as a result of µ-opioid receptor stimulation in the 
intestinal submucosa.  This leads to delayed gastric emptying, increased pyloric sphincter tone, and 
prolonged intestinal transit.  The resultant decrease in intestinal motility prolongs contact between the 
gut contents and the intestinal mucosa, resulting in increased fluid absorption.  In addition, stimulation of 
mucosal µ-opioid receptors activates a reflex arc that leads to further fluid resorption and reduced 
intestinal secretions.  Together, these effects result in the formation of dry, hard stools that are difficult 
to pass. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
As mentioned above, OIC is a major side effect of chronic opioid use and persists unless properly treated. 
A high number of chronic opioid users are confronted with OIC, which can have a serious impact on daily 
activities and ability to work. If not managed properly, there is a risk for inadequate pain management 
since patients will lower opioid dosage when confronted with high impact, persistent OIC. 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 12/209 
 
 
 
 
2.1.5.  Management 
There are a range of medicinal products and approaches currently available for the treatment of OIC.  
However, many standard laxatives are not effective in treating the constipation caused by opioids. 
Laxatives are the most common treatment for OIC and include gastrointestinal stimulants, anionic 
surfactants, osmotic laxatives, and bulk-forming laxatives.  Stimulant laxatives act on the intestinal 
mucosa, increasing water and electrolyte secretion, and stimulating peristaltic action.  Anionic surfactants 
cause changes in absorptive cell membranes, which result in intestinal secretion.  Osmotic laxatives draw 
water to the colon, hydrating the stools.  Bulk-forming laxatives increase stool frequency, water content 
and faecal solids.  
Currently available peripherally-acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORAs) include methylnaltrexone 
bromide (Relistor) and naloxegol (Moventig) which have been approved in the EU. At present, none of the 
above mentioned products are approved for first line treatment of OIC in the EU. 
The WHO guideline for cancer pain relief recommends using prophylactic laxative as the first-line 
preventative treatment for OIC, initiated at the same time as opioid treatment (WHO, 1996).  Strategies 
for subsequent lines of treatment should prophylactic measures fail, vary considerably from no 
recommendations to various pharmacological suggestions (eg, increasing laxative dose, combining 
laxatives, opioid rotation, and manual disimpaction).  Patients need to cycle through multiple OIC 
regimens to find one that is effective, and a substantial portion of patients with OIC cannot obtain 
adequate control with laxatives. 
About the product 
Rizmoic (naldemedine) is formulated as a 0.2 mg film-coated tablet to be administered once daily with or 
without food. Naldemedine acts as an antagonist at the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors, and has no 
agonistic activity at any of these opioid receptors.  Naldemedine functions as a μ-opioid receptor 
antagonist in peripheral tissues, in particular the enteric nervous system in the gastrointestinal tract, 
thereby decreasing the constipating effects of opioids without reversing centrally-mediated opioid effects.  
Naldemedine is a derivative of naltrexone to which a side chain has been added that increases the 
molecular weight and the polar surface area, thereby reducing its ability to cross the blood brain barrier 
(BBB); the CNS penetration of naldemedine is expected to be negligible at the recommended dose.  
Additionally, naldemedine is a substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter, which may also 
be involved in reducing naldemedine penetration into the CNS.  Based on this, naldemedine is expected 
to exert anti-constipating effects on opioids without reversing their centrally-mediated analgesic effects. 
This is a MAA according to optional scope of Article 3(2)(a) of regulation (EC)726/2004 – as a new active 
substance. 
The proposed indication at submission was: Rizmoic is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced 
constipation (OIC) in adult patients.e  
As strictly laxative naïve patients have not been studied the indication was amended during this 
procedure to bring it in line with the studied patient population as follows:  
The approved indication is: Rizmoic is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in 
adult patients who have previously been treated with a laxative. 
The approved posology is 200 micrograms (one tablet) once daily. Rizmoic may be used with or without 
laxative(s).

Type of Application and aspects on development 
During the design and initiation of the Phase 3 programme for Rizmoic (naldemedine), there were no 
established EU regulatory guidelines for chronic constipation. In February of 2014, the draft EU Guideline 
on the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for the Treatment of Chronic Constipation was published 
(EMA/CHMP/336243, draft version dated 20 February 2014 and finalised in June 2015). No EMA scientific 
advice has been given during the development of Rizmoic (naldemedine).  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing naldemedine tosylate, equivalent to 
200 micrograms of naldemedine free base, as active substance.  
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: mannitol, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate  
Film coating : hypromellose, talc, yellow iron oxide (E172) 
The product is available in aluminium/aluminium blister as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of naldemedine tosylate is  
17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-6,7-didehydro-4,5α-epoxy-3,6,14-trihydroxy-N-[2-(3-phenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5
-yl)propan-2-yl]morphinan-7-carboxamide 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid corresponding to the molecular 
formula C 32H34N4O6 ·C7H8O3S. It has a relative molecular mass of 742.84 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Figure 1 Active substance structure 
Its chemical structure was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, UV, IR 
and 1H & 13C NMR spectroscopy. The structure is also supported by the synthetic route. The molecule 
contains four chiral centres. Only one specific enantiomer is manufactured. Enantiomeric purity is 
adequately controlled. 
Naldemedine tosylate is a white to light tan non-hygroscopic powder. Its solubility is high over the 
physiological pH range and it is classified as class 3 according to the Biopharmaceutic Classification 
System (BCS).  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 14/209 
 
 
 
 
 
Naldemedine tosylate exhibits polymorphism and results of investigations showed that the desired 
polymorphic form, is consistently produced under the conditions selected and registered in the 
commercial manufacturing process.  
Other identified solid state forms are pseudo polymorphs and solvates. In addition, solvates can form in 
different solvents. However, these solvents are not used in the manufacturing process. All batches 
including DoE have consistently generated the selected form proposed for marketing. Crystalline form 
does not change during stability studies (see stability section).  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Naldemedine tosylate is synthesized in three main steps using commercially available well defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications,  
The process intended for commercial production uses the same synthetic route which was used to prepare 
the active substance used in phase 3 clinical trials, late non-clinical studies and stability studies. 
To note, in its original submission the applicant proposed a starting material which was not acceptable 
since  the  proposed  GMP  manufacturing  process  involved  multiple  chemical  transformation  steps  in  a 
telescoped  sequence  without  isolation  of  intermediates.    That  compound  was  a  custom-synthesised 
chemical. The synthesis, supplier and purity profile of its precursors were not disclosed and therefore 
changes  affecting  the  purity  profile  were  not  under  GMP  control.  In  addition,  potential  mutagenic 
impurities formed upstream and the chemical steps, where these impurities are formed, are critical and 
therefore should be part of the registered synthetic route. The major objection asking the applicant to 
redefine the starting material further back in the synthesis and update all relevant sections of the dossier 
was adequately addressed and resulted in the synthesis described in the dossier.  
The development of the manufacturing process of naldemedine tosyate is based on an enhanced Quality 
by Design (QbD) approach. Prior knowledge, risk assessments, multivariate experiments and scientific 
knowledge were used to identify and understand process parameters and process steps that impact CQAs 
and  to  develop  a  control  strategy  including  proven  acceptable  ranges  (PARs)  for  input  materials  and 
operating conditions for commercial use. The available development data, the proposed control strategy 
and batch analysis data from commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs.  
The active substance CQAs are: impurities potentially present in the active substance based on ICH Q3A, 
genotoxic impurities based on ICH M7, residual solvents based on ICH Q3C, description, assay, p-toluene 
sulfonic acid, optical rotation, water content, residue on ignition, crystalline form, particle size and metals 
based on ICH Q3D. 
A mutagenic assessment of the synthetic route has been conducted in order to ensure that exposure to 
mutagenic impurities was limited to the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) of not more than 1.5 
μg/day for an individual mutagenic impurity and not more than 5 μg/day for total mutagenic impurities in 
accordance with ICH M7 for a drug for long term use. Mutagenic impurities are controlled by specifications 
for the relevant materials or by control of the manufacturing process. 
A risk assessment to identify the potentially critical manufacturing process parameters (pCPPs) against 
the active substance CQAs in the manufacturing process of naldemedine tosilate was conducted. This was 
followed by a screening 2-level fractional factorial design of experiments (DoE) study conducted at each 
step to investigate the impact of process parameter variability on the CQA and define acceptable ranges. 
A process verification study was conducted at pilot scale in order to confirm that the conclusions made on 
process performance and the overall control strategy of the active substance CQA derived from laboratory 
Rizmoic Assessment report

experiments are valid during manufacture at commercial scale. In addition, results of process validation 
at commercial scale were provided. All results met the specification. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Two processes, named route A and route B were employed during naldemedine 
tosylate manufacturing process development. These two routes mainly differ in the use of starting 
materials. The commercial process consists of minor modifications and/or optimizations made to route B1 
due to change in manufacturing site. To date, nine batches of naldemedine tosylate have been completed 
among three batches produced following the commercial process (route B2) at the proposed production 
site. The purity of the active substance has improved over the course of development and the proposed 
commercial process, route B2, yields active substance of consistent quality. 
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene bags and sealed with plastic ties. 
The bags are stored in a secondary container for shipping within a metal, fibre or plastic container. The 
low-density polyethylene complies with the requirements of Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 the 9th edition “Polyolefins” 
except  for  “Supplementary  Test”  and  the  relevant  requirements  of  Regulation  (EU)  No.10/2011,  on 
plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food, as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for description, identification (UV, IR), related 
substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), assay 
(HPLC) and particle size (laser diffraction). 
The active substance specification includes relevant test parameters according to the requirements of ICH 
Q6A and the applied limits have been acceptably justified using analysis of representative batches of 
naldemedine tosylate and relevant ICH guidelines. 
Actual and potential genotoxic impurities formed during the manufacture of naldemedine tosylate have 
been discussed and their control justified. A maximum recommended exposure of 0.57% for each 
potential mutagen is based upon the Threshold of Toxicological Concern of 1.5 μg/day with respect to a 
naldemedine tosylate daily dose of 0.26 mg for long term use (>10 years) in accordance with ICH M7.  
The contents of the three tosylate impurities are determined by the related substances method. These 
three impurities are not specified but controlled by the active substance specification at not more than 
0.10% as unspecified impurities.  Other impurities are controlled in the relevant intermediate(s).The limit 
for total impurities was tightened during the evaluation as requested. A discussion of parameters 
proposed to be excluded from testing has been presented. 
The fate of all solvents present in the starting materials or used in the manufacturing process has been 
assessed. A GC method has been developed for detection of residual solvents in naldemedine tosylate. 
The proposed specification limits are in line with ICH Q3C.Particle size of the active substance has an 
impact on appearance of the coated tablets. Therefore, a milling step is performed in the commercial 
process and a specification for active substance particle size has been defined. 
A justification for the omission of tests for optical rotation, crystalline form, microbial limits, elemental 
impurities and benzene has been provided.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 16/209 
 
 
 
 
The omission of a test for optical rotation has been justified  
As indicated above, crystalline form investigations confirmed that there is a single crystalline form of 
naldemedine tosylate. All purified, three representative batches of non-milled naldemedine tosylate, and 
active substance from milling studies and routine batches have been confirmed to be the selected form by 
XRPD, indicating that the milling process does not affect the crystalline form of naldemedine tosylate.  
Microbiological limit test was performed on the primary stability batches of naldemedine tosylate. No 
growth was observed under the long-term (30 °C / 65 % RH) conditions after 60 months storage. 
Additionally, the water content of naldemedine tosylate under the long-term conditions at initial and after 
60 months storage was low Therefore, the microbiological risk for the active substance is considered to be 
low and no specification is proposed in naldemedine tosylate for the microbial limit test. 
The risk assessment identified potential elemental impurities for naldemedine tosylate. These elemental 
impurities are already controlled by the specification for residue on ignition.  
Benzene is a potential impurity in other solvents which are used in the manufacturing process of 
naldemedine tosylate. Benzene was not detected in seven representative batches. The data 
demonstrated that it was purged to a level of not detected which demonstrates the efficacy with which 
benzene is purged. These data support the proposal not to test commercial batches of naldemedine 
tosylate for benzene. 
The in-house developed analytical procedures have been acceptably described and adequately validated 
in accordance with ICH Q2 (R1) requirements. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay testing has been presented. 
A comprehensive amount of batch analysis data are presented from different development campaigns. 
Specifically, batch analysis data from three commercial scale batches of the active substance 
manufactured with the proposed commercial route  and three additional batches from previous 
development routes have been provided. The results are within the specifications in force at the time and 
are consistent from batch to batch. 
Naldemedine is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) food grade plastic bags which are 
placed in a secondary container. Information on the packaging is sufficient and includes adequate 
declaration for compliance with EU Regulation. 
Stability 
Stability data from three pilot scale batches of active substance manufactured at the development site 
and stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for up to 60 
months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Data from 3 production scale batches 
manufactured at the proposed commercial site stored at long term condition (30°C/65% RH) for 18 
months and at accelerated condition (40°C/75% RH) for 6 months in the intended commercial packaging 
were also submitted. At both sites the batches were manufactured according to the proposed commercial 
process. 
The following parameters were tested: description (appearance), identification (IR), optical rotation, 
related substances, water content, assay, crystalline form, particle size distribution, and microbial limits 
(TAMC/TYMC). 
No degradation was seen in any of the parameters tested at any of the storage conditions. A slight 
increase was observed in water content. However, all results complied with the specification. The results 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 17/209 
 
 
 
 
demonstrate that the stability of naldemedine tosylate manufactured at the commercial site is 
comparable to that from the pilot scale batches. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. This study confirmed 
that naldemedine in solid state is not sensitive to light.  
Results on stress conditions (high temperature, high temperature and high humidity, high humidity) were 
also provided on one batch. The results demonstrate the chemical and physical stability of naldemedine 
tosylate at all storage conditions. No significant changes were observed in description (appearance), 
identification (IR), optical rotation, related substances, water, assay, crystalline form and particle size 
distribution, and all results complied with the specification. 
Forced degradation studies were performed on naldemedine tosylate to identify potential degradation 
products that might be formed in the active substance, to elucidate the mechanisms of formation and 
evaluate the stability-indicating properties of the related substances method. Solid state samples were 
stored for 1 month protected from light at high temperature (in closed amber glass bottle) and high 
temperature and high humidity (in open amber glass bottle). The conditions examined in solution were: 
water (high temperature), acidic condition, (high temperature), alkaline condition (high temperature), 
oxidative condition (high temperature). All samples were stored for 72 hours in closed amber glass 
bottles, protected from light. Samples were analysed for assay and content of related substances by 
HPLC. 
No significant changes were observed in related substances and assay in the solid state. However, 
naldemedine tosylate in solution was labile and the level of degradation products increased under stress 
conditions: light, heat, acid/base hydrolysis and oxidation. Under alkaline condition, unknown 
degradation products increased. The results demonstrated that the HPLC method is stability-indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed 
container.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release film-coated tablet containing 200 micrograms of the active 
substance naldemedine tosylate.  
Naldemedine tablets are formulated as yellow, 6.5 mm, round film-coated tablets debossed with the 
Shionogi marking above the identifier code 222 on one side and the strength, 0.2, on the other side. The 
qualitative and quantitative composition of the tables has been provided. 
As indicated above, the form of naldemedine tosylate, used to manufacture Rizmoic is a crystalline solid 
with suitable solid state stability and oral bioavailability. It is classified as BCS class 3. 
Risk assessments (RA) and different studies were conducted to identify the critical material attributes of 
the active substance. As a result, active substance related substances and particle size were classified as 
a CMA, and a specification limit for the particle size was established.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 18/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The potential change in polymorphic form during finished product manufacture and storage was discussed 
and concluded that is low given the low naldemedine content in the tablets, the direct compression 
method used to manufacture the tablets and the packaging precautions.  
The excipients used in the tablet core are D-mannitol (diluent), croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant) and 
magnesium stearate (lubricant), which are all standard for pharmaceutical preparations and comply with 
their respective Ph. Eur. monographs. Additional specifications have been discussed and established as 
appropriate. The tablets are coated with a yellow non-functional film-coating consisting of hypromellose, 
talc and yellow ferric oxide. In-house specifications are provided for the film-coating material. Yellow 
ferric oxide complies with EU regulation. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this 
report. Compatibility and stability studies demonstrated that all excipients in the finished product 
formulation show good compatibility with the active substance. Results from risk assessment and 
experimental studies confirmed that there are no CMA in the excipients used. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product included elements of science and risk-based 
approaches described in ICH Q8(R2) and ICH Q9.  The approach consisted of following four steps;  
1. Definition of Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP)  
2. Determination of potential Critical Quality Attributes (p-CQAs)  
3. Identification of potential Critical Material Attributes (p-CMAs) and potential Critical Process 
Parameters (p-CPPs) using Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA): Initial risk assessment  
4. Identification of CQAs, CMAs and CPPs and development of control strategies based on the results of 
experimental studies: Second risk assessment  
The quality product profile is outlined in the table below. 
Table 1 Quality target product profile 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 19/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
From the results of the initial risk assessment and second risk assessment, CPPs and CMAs which have an 
impact on finished product quality were identified. The finished product quality attributes which are 
affected by CPPs and CMAs such as assay, related substances, uniformity of dosage units, appearance 
and water content are classified as CQAs. 
An overview of the formulations used during the development program was provided. In the early clinical 
trials, naldemedine oral solution / suspension containing 0.01 mg to 100 mg of naldemedine as free base 
were used. This oral solution / suspension was prepared by the study pharmacist at the clinical site and 
dispensed into the subject's dose container. The tablets used for Phase 1 to Phase 2b clinical study were  
0.1 mg, 1 mg, 10 mg film-coated tablets , the tablets for the Phase 3 clinical study were 0.2 mg 
film-coated. The formulation for the commercial product is identical to the Phase 3 clinical study 
formulation. The formulation used for Phase 1 to Phase 2b was changed for the Phase 3 clinical study with 
respect to strength, diameter, weight of core tablet, level of magnesium stearate and colour. In order to 
evaluate the impact of the changes, dissolution profiles for the formulation used in Phase 1 to Phase 2b 
were compared to dissolution profiles for the formulation used in Phase 3. Based on the results of the 
bioavailability study and comparative dissolution profiles, it was concluded that the impact of the 
formulation change on the product performance was not significant and the formulation designed for 
Phase 3 is suitable for use in the Phase 3 clinical program. 
The manufacturing process, which was used in the early development studies and which will also be 
used for the commercial product is a standard direct compression method. This was selected due to the 
sensitivity of naldemedine to water. Since the active substance concentration in the tablets is extremely 
low, the process development studies at pilot scale were focused on the design of the blending process 
with the goal of obtaining a blend of uniform content. Appropriateness of the defined blending time at 
commercial scale was verified.  
A holding time has been determined for the final blend manufactured at commercial size. The batch was 
packaged simulating actual storage conditions and tested for water content, impurities and assay. The 
proposed holding time of the final blend prior to compression has been demonstrated. 
The applicant confirmed that the start of the shelf-life for the finished product is set in accordance with the 
guideline on start of the shelf-life of the finished dosage form (CPMP/QWP/072/96). 
The choice of dissolution medium was based on the solubility of naldemedine tosylate, stability of solution 
and dissolution profiles of the tablets.  
Dissolution profiles for Rizmoic 0.2 mg tablets were evaluated according to Ph. Eur. 2.9.3 in several media 
at different pH (ranging from pH 1.2 to 10, to include the physiological pH range). Based on the results of 
this study, together with the stability of naldemedine the dissolution medium was selected .During the 
manufacturing process development the effect of different manufacturing variables on dissolution was 
investigated. It was shown that none of these variables affect dissolution. This has been attributed to the 
high solubility of the active substance over the physiological pH range. 
The tablets are packaged in an aluminium-plastic laminate (cold form foil) with a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 
based  heat  seal  coated  aluminium  foil  (lid  stock).  The  material  complies  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product will be manufactured at the manufacturing site described in the MAA. Other sites 
involved in packaging, QC testing and release and their responsibilities have been described.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  sieving,  blending,  compression,  coating,  bulk 
packaging and primary packaging. Relevant information on storage and transportation of intermediate 
products and/or bulk ware has been presented.  
The in-process control tests (IPCs), critical process parameters (CPPs) and non-critical process 
parameters (non-CPPs) have been defined. 
Due to the low dosage the manufacturing process is considered non-standard. The manufacturing process 
has been validated with three consecutive validation batches covering the maximum batch size. It has 
been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical 
form.  
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description (visual), identification (HPLC/UV), related substances (HPLC), water (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of 
dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution test (Ph. Eur), assay (HPLC), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The proposed limits have been adequately established and justified. The limits for related substances 
were reconsidered to reflect the level seen in batch analysis and stability studies. Moreover, a discussion 
on elemental impurities in line with the ICH Q3D guideline is presented. The analytical methods used have 
been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three commercial scale batches and several pilot scale batches 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under 
long  term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions 
(40 ºC /75% RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  Rizmoic  tablets  200 
micrograms are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging 
proposed for marketing.  
The  primary  stability  batches  were  evaluated  for  description,  related  substances,  water  content, 
disintegration, dissolution profile, assay, identification, uniformity of dosage units and microbial limits. 
The analytical methods used for stability testing are the same as those used for release testing, with the 
exception of the dissolution profile. Disintegration is not included as a release test. The methods used for 
disintegration and dissolution testing in the stability programme have been adequately described.  
No  changes  were  observed  on  description,  identification,  water  content,  uniformity  of  dosage  units, 
disintegration, dissolution and microbial limits. 
Although a slight increase in water content and related substances (accompanied by a decrease in assay), 
were  observed  after  storage  at  long  term  and  accelerated  conditions,  all  results  remained  within  the 
specification. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Tests included description, identification, related substances, water, 
uniformity  of  dosage  units,  disintegration,  dissolution  and  assay.  In  the  study  samples,  there  was  an 
increase in the level of some impurities .The content of naldemedine decreased. However, an increase of 
Rizmoic Assessment report

degradation  products  in  the  aluminium  foil  covered  control  was  not  observed  above  the  reporting 
threshold. Water increased, however there was a similar trend with the aluminium foil covered control.. 
No changes were observed in the other test items. The results of the photostability testing indicate that 
Rizmoic tablets 0.2 mg are susceptible to degradation when exposed to conditions of high light intensity. 
However,  when  exposed  to  normal  light  conditions  during  the  manufacturing  processes  there  is  no 
evidence of photo instability. 
A bulk hold study on two batches stored in LDPE bag with silica gel desiccant stored in an aluminium bag 
under different temperature/humidity conditions for 12 months was presented. Tests performed were 
description,  related  substances,  water  content,  dissolution,  assay  and  microbial  limits.  No  significant 
changes were observed in the test attributes. This study demonstrated stability through 12 months of 
storage at ambient temperature in warehouse conditions, which supports a bulk hold time of 12 months. 
A temperature cycling study was conducted to evaluate the effect of freeze-thaw on naldemedine tablets. 
Samples packaged in aluminium foil blisters from one primary stability batch were evaluated according 
toa  temperature  cycling  protocolthree  times.  Tests  performed  were  description,  related  substances, 
dissolution  and  assay.  The  amount  of  some  degradation  products  increased  after  three  temperature 
cycles but their values were well within the limits of the specification. No changes were observed in the 
other test items. This study concluded that short period temperature excursions do not have any adverse 
impact on the tablets packaged in aluminium blisters. 
A stress stability study was also conducted in order to identify the potential degradation products of the 
finished product and demonstrate that the methods for related substances are stability indicating.  
In the solid state samples were exposed to high temperature and humidity, high temperature and high 
humidity .In all conditions the samples were stored in open petri dish protected from light. The major 
degradation product was identified .Under high humidity condition, this product and other impurity also 
increased. Under high temperature and humidity condition, other impurity also increased. Under high 
temperature condition, unknown degradation products increased. Assay decreased under all conditions. 
In the solution phase samples were exposed to oxidative, acidic and alkaline conditions. Degradation was 
observed under all conditions. Assay decreased under oxidative and acidic conditions.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years stored in the original package in order 
to protect from light and moisture as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The major objection initially raised requesting re-definition of 
the proposed starting material has been adequately addressed. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency  and  uniformity  of  important  product  quality  characteristics,  and  these  in  turn  lead  to  the 
conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  clinical  use.  The 
applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and/or finished product 
and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process 
of the active substance, nor for the finished product.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A  comprehensive  nonclinical  development  program  was  performed,  including  pharmacology,  safety 
pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  studies,  according  to  ICH  M3  and  other  relevant 
guidelines.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro data show that naldemedine binds to both rat and human human µ-, δ-, and κ opioid receptors. 
The in vitro binding affinity of naldemedine to µ-, δ-, and κ opioid receptors is comparable between 
human and rats receptors. In vitro binding affinity data of five metabolites have shown that 
nor-naldemedine, naldemedine 3-G, naldemedine 6-G, and naldemedine-carboxylic acid have less potent 
binding affinities than naldemedine and benzamidine does not have significant binding affinities for these 
opioid receptors. 
In vitro data show antagonistic activities of naldemedine against human µ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors. 
Nor naldemedine, naldemedine 3-G, naldemedine 6-G, naldemedine-carboxylic acid show some 
antagonistic activities against these opioid receptors but less potent that naldemedine. Benzamidine did 
not show any apparent antagonistic activities.   
Agonistic activity against µ-, δ-, or κ-opioid receptor was only apparent with nor-naldemedine, the most 
abundant circulating metabolite in human plasma.  Nor-naldemedine showed agonist activity against 
δ-opioid receptor with the EC50 value more than 300 fold higher than the Cmax value of nor-naldemedine 
at the intended clinical dose of naldemedine. All other in vitro data point toward no agonistic activity of 
naldemedine and it metabolites.  
Naldemedine was tested for in vitro antagonistic and agonistic activities against rat µ-, δ-, and κ-opioid 
receptors. The results indicate that the functional activities of naldemedine against rat opioid receptors 
were comparable to those against human opioid receptors.  
Data from in vitro binding kinetic studies of naldemedine showed slower association and dissociation 
kinetics to human or rat μ-opioid receptor when compared with the positive control, naloxone.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 23/209 
 
 
 
 
In vitro data showed concentration-dependent antagonistic action on DAMGO-induced contraction 
inhibition. The available data suggest that naldemedine antagonises DAMGO-induced μ-opioid receptor 
activation as well as morphine-, oxycodone-, hydrocodone-, or fentanyl-induced [35S]-GTPγS binding in 
a non-competitive manner. Naldemedine is described as a non-competitive antagonist by the Applicant.  
It is acknowledged that there are circumstances in the primary pharmacology and receptor binding kinetic 
of naldemedine that could indicate that in the tested concentration range, naldemedine might act as a 
non-competitive antagonist to the µ-opioid receptor. However, the applicant determine non-competitive 
characteristic based solely on naldemedine not acting as a competitive antagonist – without taking into 
consideration that other types of binding than competitive and non-competitive also exist. It is 
furthermore acknowledged that due to solubility challenges, it was not possible to prepare higher 
concentrations of naldemedine in order to demonstrate more clearly that the curves presented in study 
report S-297995-EB-311-R does indeed follow a non-competitive antagonist profile. As presented in the 
report now, the curve fit demonstrate right-shift, but decrease of the maximum effect is more difficult to 
observe. The applicant also describe naldemedine as a naltrexone derivative, and naltrexone being 
described as a competitive antagonist, this contribute to the theory that naldemedine would also be acting 
as a competitive antagonist. Therefore it is concluded that naldemedine most likely is best described as a 
competitive antagonist.  
However, no further nonclinical elaboration will be pursued, as 1) the nature of naldemedines antagonistic 
effect is not mentioned in the SmPC, 2) the applicant included the following sentence in the SmPC; There 
is limited experience in patients treated with opioid pain medicinal product(s) at doses more than the 
equivalent of 400 mg of morphine. There is no experience in patients treated for constipation induced by 
partial opioid mu-agonists (e.g. buprenorphine). 
Naldemedine antagonises both the subcutaneously and the orally administered opioid-induced inhibition 
of small intestinal transit in rats. Naldemedine antagonism was more effective for oxycodone-induced 
constipation [ED50: 0.02 mg/kg] than for morphine-induced constipation, when the latter was 
administered by oral route [ED50: 0.23 mg/kg (p.o.), ED50: 0.03 mg/kg (s.c.)]. As a point of 
comparison, the clinical intended dose is 0.003 mg/kg. The Cmax at the clinical intended dose was similar 
to the Cmax at the ED50 for s.c. administered morphine and oxycodone.  However with regards to the 
p.o. morphine, Cmax levels at ED50 were about 10-fold higher. This difference in ED50 values following 
subcutaneous and oral administration of morphine to naldemedine-treated animals is likely to be 
attributable to differences in the morphine plasma concentrations following the two routes of 
administration. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
At 10 mg/kg, opioid receptors were occupied by naldemedine in both rat cerebral cortex and thalamus 4 
hours post dose. The occupancies reached 14% for a 10 mg/kg dose, which is 487x the clinical intended 
dose. At 3 mg/kg (146x the clinical intended dose), opioid receptors were not occupied by naldemedine in 
both regions, up to 24 hours post-dose. 
The peripherally- and centrally-mediated withdrawal symptoms induced by naldemedine were assessed 
in morphine-dependent mice and rats. In mice, naldemedine caused a peripherally-mediated withdrawal 
symptom (diarrhea – up to 10 mg/kg). In rats, it caused peripherally-mediated withdrawal symptoms 
from 0.3 mg/kg and a centrally-mediated withdrawal symptom (teeth chattering) at 3 mg/kg (the highest 
tested dose). In ferrets 0.3 mg/kg naldemedine dosed orally completely inhibited the morphine-induced 
emetic responses 30 minutes to 6 hours post-dose. 
In clinic, no effect has been observed on centrally-mediated analgesia. Since Naldemedine is a μ-receptor 
antagonist and as such, has the potential to affect centrally-mediated μ-receptor agonist activity, a

warning was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC and an anti-analgesic effect due to centrally-mediated 
opioid receptor antagonism is considered an important potential risk of naldemedine in the RMP (Risk 
Management Plan). This is only expected in patients who have disruptions to the BBB (e.g. patients with 
primary brain malignancies, CNS metastases or other inflammatory conditions). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology studies performed assessed the effects of naldemedine on CNS, cardiovascular 
and respiratory systems. No effects of naldemedine were observed on in the CNS study or in the 
respiratory study, nor in the in vivo cardiovascular study in telemetered dogs. However, the in vitro 
studies on repolarisation in isolated guinea pig papillary muscle, as well as the hERG study showed that 
naldemedine has a potential to prolong action potential in the guinea pig papillary muscle and inhibit peak 
tail currents in the hERG test. However, both these positive results occurred at concentrations of 
30µmol/L which exceed the clinical Cmax of 2 ng/mL by far. Therefore the CHMP considers that there is 
no specific concern on cardiovascular function following treatment with naldemedine at the proposed 
clinical doses.  
Abuse potential 
Three animal abuse potential assessment studies, ie, a drug discrimination study in rats, a 
self-administration study in monkeys, and a physical dependence study in rats were conducted to 
evaluate the potential of naldemedine for abuse liability.   
Naldemine did not show morphine-like discriminative stimulus properties in rats at doses covering the 
intended clinical dose of naldemedine (Cmax, Animal to Human ratio: 7.6) and its major metabolite 
nor-naldemedine (Cmax, Animal to Human ratio: 4.2). No reinforcing effect was observed in monkeys by 
intravenous self-administration (Cmax, Animal to Human ratio: 27). Naldemedine did not have also 
physical dependence-producing potential in rats at doses higher than the intended clinical dose of 
naldemedine (Cmax, Animal to Human ratio: 2884). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Quantitation of naldemedine and metabolites in plasma samples from pharmacokinetic studies and 
toxicity studies were determined using LC/MS/MS. The analytical methods were validated with respect to 
selectivity, recovery, accuracy, precision, and stability. 
In rats and dogs, the pharmacokinetics of naldemedine after a single oral administration under non-fasted 
condition is considered to be within the range of dose-linearity up to 3 mg/kg. The pharmacokinetics of 
naldemedine in efficacy dose models in rats fell within the range of dose-linearity.  
Naldemedine was rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration in non-fasted dogs, but less 
absorbed in non-fasted rats. Pharmacokinetics after oral administration were affected by the food 
condition in both rats and dogs. The change in pharmacokinetic profiles between non-fasted and fasted 
dog is not solely due to absorption as there are marked changes in parameter related to elimination of 
naldemedine. The changes to pharmacokinetics of naldemedine in relation to food condition are similar in 
rats, but less pronounced with one except that bioavailability changes in rats. The differences seen in 
relation for food condition in the clinical development programme were less pronounced and there were 
no apparent changes to CL/F and t ½,z. Thus, the changes in elimination kinetics observed in dogs and rats 
appear not to be relevant in humans.

Plasma protein binding is high in all species that were tested, including human. Available results indicate 
that naldemedine predominantly is bound to HSA in human serum. The distribution in blood cells appears 
to be low and similar across the tested species, including human. 
Naldemedine was widely distributed into tissues of rats, and high levels of radioactivity were detected in 
rectal mucosa, submaxillary gland, liver, parotid gland, and harderian gland. Naldemedine was not 
detected in the brain.   
In the nasal bone a high radioactivity was observed 1008 hours after last administration in a study with 
repeated oral administrations of [carbonyl-14C]-naldemedine in rats. The data presented suggests very 
limited or no distribution to the nasal bone via the systemic circulation and the high levels of radioactivity 
observed in nasal bone could be due to contamination as a result of oral administration.  
After oral administration of [14C]-naldemedine to male pigmented rats, radioactivity was observed in 
melanin-containing tissues over somewhat longer period than in other tissues. The radioactivity in the 
uveal tract after administration of [oxadiazole-14C]-naldemedine or [carbonyl-14C]-naldemedine 
decreased with t½,z values of 309 and 447 hours, respectively. Naldemedine and its metabolites was not 
considered to be retained in melanin-containing tissues.  
Naldemedine and its related materials crossed the placenta of pregnant rats and were also excreted into 
milk of nursing rats. This is reflected in the SmPC section 4.6 and 5.3.  
The major metabolic pathways of naldemedine in human hepatocytes is thought to be glucuronidation at 
the 3- or 6-hydroxyl group in morphinan structure and N-dealkylation at methylcyclopropane group at 
17-position. The major metabolizing enzymes involved seem to be CYP3A4 and UGT1A3. 
Nor-naldemedine is the main circulating naldemedine metabolite in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and humans. 
The plasma level of nor-naldemedine excessed 10% following repeated oral dosing in humans. Minor 
metabolites in human plasma following repeated dosing were naldemedine-(7R)-7-hydroxide and 
naldemedine 3-G.  Nor-naldemedine, naldemedine 3-G, naldemedine 6-G, naldemedine carboxylic acid, 
naldemedine-(7R)-7-hydroxide and benzamidine are circulating metabolites identified in rats, dogs and 
humans. The similarity of the metabolic process observed across species supports the use of the rat and 
the dog for the toxicological testing.   
[Oxadiazole-14C]-naldemedine is used to assess naldemedine and metabolites except naldemedine 
carboxylic acid whereas [Carbonyl-14C]-naldemedine is used to assess naldemedine and metabolites 
except benzamidine. Naldemedine and its related metabolites having [Carbonyl-14C] were considered to 
be mainly excreted into faeces via bile in rats and dog. Naldemedine and its related metabolites having 
[Oxadiazole-14C] were considered to be evenly excreted into urine and faeces in rats and mainly via 
faeces in dogs. Since benzamidine was observed as a major metabolite in urine after an oral 
administration of [Oxadiazole-14C]-naldemedine in rats and dogs, the increased radioactivity in urine 
seems to be due to urinary excretion of benzamidine, which was not traced by the radiolabel of 
carbonyl-14C.  
The in vitro assessments have demonstrated that naldemedine is not a direct inhibitor or inducer of the 
CYP enzymes. Likewise, the in vitro assessments have demonstrated that naldemedine was not an 
inhibitor of the transporters tested at the concentrations achieved following treatment with naldemedine 
at MHRD. At 100 fold higher concentrations than the concentrations in humans following therapeutic 
doses, some effects does appear, however these are not considered clinically relevant due to the high 
exposure margins.  
The major metabolite in human plasma nor-naldemedine was also investigated in vitro and did not show 
any CYP inhibition, induction or transporter inhibition at the concentrations at the MHRD. 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

The 1-month repeat-dose oral toxicity studies of naldemedine in rats and dogs indicate that there is no 
impact on hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes at the intended clinical dose (0.2 mg/day, Cmax: 2 ng/ml). 
Effects on CYP activities are observed at values, which are 1000-fold and 100-fold of the Cmax of 
naldemedine at the intended clinical dose, in rats and dogs respectively.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies were performed in rats and dog. Naldemedine was tolerated at 500 and 2000 
mg/kg doses in rats, where only a decreased body weight gain was observed for males receiving 500 
mg/kg/day or more, and females at the high dose of 2000mg/kg/day. In dogs, the approximate lethal 
dose was higher than the high dose of 1000 mg/kg naldemedine. Clinical signs related to treatment with 
naldemedine were a dose dependent increase in vomiting, slight decrease in body weight and increased 
ALP and TBILI. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In the pivotal repeat-toxicity studies, in rats, the most important toxicity findings were suppression of 
body weight gain, salivation and prolongation of oestrous cycle. In dogs, the most important toxicity 
findings were vomiting/vomitus, single cell necrosis in hepatocyte with the elevation of ALT and/or ALP 
activity in dogs and atrophy of adipose tissue. The findings on body weight gain, salivation, 
vomiting/vomitus, liver and adipose tissue occurred at exposures sufficiently above the maximum human 
exposure and hence to be considered of little relevance to clinical use. In addition, clinical safety data do 
not indicate that administration of naldemedine has hepatotoxic effects on the human liver. In rats, 
prolongation of oestrous cycle was observed in rats at 0.3 mg/kg/day in the 1 month-repeat dose (no 
safety margin), but this was not observed at 1 mg/kg/day in the fertility study (safety margin of 12). In 
the supplemental mechanistic study, effect of naldemedine on prolactin levels was not observed at 1 
mg/kg. In human, effects of naldemedine on prolactin levels were also observed, but only at high doses 
(≥ 10 mg/day). Based on these results, this phenomenon is not considered to be relevant in human at the 
clinical dose of 0.2 mg. 
Genotoxicity 
In the genotoxicity tests performed, Ames test, in vitro gene mutation in mammalian cells and in vivo 
chromosomal aberration test in rats, naldemedine did not show any potential to be genotoxic. 
Carcinogenicity 
In the carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, with repeated dosing of up to 104 weeks duration at doses 
of up to 100 mg/kg day, no naldemedine related neoplastic findings were recorded. Based on these 
results, it was concluded that naldemedine does not have any carcinogenic potential.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Naldemedine did not impair fertility in rats. Irregular oestrous cycles increased dose-dependently, but the 
irregular oestrous cycles were recovered during the pre-mating or mating periods and the females 
successfully copulated with the males. The AUC-based safety margins at the NOAEL were 30958x in 
males and 12x in females for reproductive function and 16920 x for early embryonic development.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 27/209 
 
 
 
 
In rabbits, an abortion, premature delivery and decreases in body weight associated with low maternal 
food consumption were noted in dams receiving 400 mg/kg/day of naldemedine. Decreases in body 
weight associated with low maternal food consumption were noted in dams receiving at least 25 
mg/kg/day of naldemedine. For maternal general toxicity, the safety margin (AUC0-24hr) was less than 22 
(NOAELS = ≤ 25 mg/kg/day) at MHRD. For maternal reproductive function and embryo-foetal 
development, the safety margin (AUC0-24hr) was 226 (NOAELs = 100 mg/kg/day). It is noted that the 
rabbit was not the most appropriate non-rodent model, as the Cmax and AUC0-24hr values of the metabolite 
3-G were higher than those of naldemedine at all the tested doses (up to 31x for Cmax and up to 42x for 
AUC0-24hr), which is not the case in human (see chapter 2.Pharmacology). In rats, the safety margins 
(AUC0-24hr) were 518 for maternal general toxicity  (NOAEL = 10 mg/kg/day) and 23081 for maternal 
reproductive function and embryo-foetal development (NOAEL = 1000 mg/kg/day). 
In the 30 and 1000 mg/kg/day groups, total litter loss, which was likely to be due to poor nursing such as 
scattering of all offspring in the cage, was observed in 5 and 3 dams, respectively. This finding was 
correlated with a small size of thymus in most animals (4/5 in 30 mg/kg/day group and 2/3 in 1000 
mg/kg/group) and with a small size of spleen in some animals (2/5 in 30 mg/kg/day group and 1/3 in 
1000 mg/kg/group). A small size of thymus has been also observed in the dam which died during 
parturition on Gestation Day 22 in the 1000 mg/kg/day group. The number of dead newborns was also 
increased on Day 4 after birth in the 30 mg/kg/day group or more. These findings could be interpreted 
either as stress related changes or as an exaggerated pharmacodynamics action and were not observed 
in the 1 mg/kg/day group. The safety margin (AUC0-24hr) for maternal general toxicity, maternal 
reproductive function, and development of the subsequent generation is 12 and as such the findings are 
considered not clinically relevant.  
Naldemedine is subject to an approved Paediatric Investigational Plan (EMEA-001893-PIP01-15). The 
juvenile toxicity studies have identified new histopathologic findings in mammary glands and in ovaries, 
at all doses ≥ 1 mg/kg/day. A NOAEL could not be defined. The lowest dose tested corresponds to an 
exposure margin of at least 6 for the clinical intended dose in adults of 200 µg. These microscopic findings 
may be related with the observed disturbance of oestrous cycle activity and earlier vaginal opening. This 
is appropriately reflected on the SmPC. The mechanism underlying these findings in rats, as well as their 
clinical relevance, are unknown.  
Local Tolerance  
In support of this application, stand-alone local tolerance studies are not expected, as the local tolerance 
following oral administration is sufficiently addressed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies.  
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
Naldemedine did not show any phototoxic potential in the in vivo study performed in hairless mice. 
However, no in vitro testing appears to have been performed prior to the in vivo study (as per ICH S10 
guidance). As the phototoxicity study has been performed prior to implementation of ICH S10, this is 
acceptable.   
Immunotoxicity and antigenicity 
In repeat-dose toxicities studies, decreased in thymus weight were observed in rats (6-month study) and 
in dogs (1-, 3- and 9-month studies). In rats, this finding was not accompanied by histopathological 
lesions and was considered to be non-adverse.  In dogs in most cases, the decrease in thymus weight was 
accompanied with gross finding (small size) and with histopathological lesions (atrophy, decreased in 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 28/209 
 
 
 
 
number of lymphocytes in the cortex and/or appearance of lymphatic follicle in the medulla). These 
findings were considered not to be treatment-related since it was not dose-related and clear 
dose-relationship was not evident in the related thymic weights or histopathological atrophy of the 
thymus. These findings could be also stress-related immune changes observed in standard toxicity 
studies (e.g. by exaggerated pharmacodynamics action).  As recommended in the ICH S8 guidelines, 
these findings call for additional nonclinical immunotoxicity testing. As such, the Applicant conducted an 
immunotoxicity study (T-cell dependent antibody formation) in rats (Dose: 0 [control], 30, 100, and 1000 
mg/kg/day), in which naldemedine had no effects on T-cell dependent antibody formation.  No further 
nonclinical immunotoxicity testing is needed.  
Metabolites and impurities 
No specific studies to investigate the toxicity of naldemedine metabolites have been conducted. 
Nor-naldemedine is the main circulating naldemedine metabolite across species. The following minor 
metabolites, naldemedine 3 G, naldemedine 6-G, benzamidine and naldemedine carboxylic acid are 
present at low levels. The metabolites are considered to be adequately qualified in the nonclinical 
toxicology studies conducted. 
Bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) testing was performed for the identified potential impurities that may 
arise during manufacturing. None of the Ames tests performed was positive. 
Additional mechanistic studies 
Two additional mechanistic studies clearly showed that prolactin level was increased after naldemedine 
administration. The fluctuations of the levels observed for the other hormones (progesterone, estradiol, 
luteinizing  hormone  and  follicular  stimulating  hormone)  were  not  clearly  related  to  naldemedine  and 
could represent a secondary effect of the increase level of prolactin or of the irregular oestrous cycle. The 
plasma prolactin level in female rats was increased by oral administration of naldemedine at 10 mg/kg or 
more,  but  no  effect  was  observed  at  1  mg/kg.  There  was  no  dose-dependency,  as  the  degree  of  the 
increase (around 22-fold) was comparable among the 10, 100, and 1000 mg/kg groups. The release of 
prolactin by naldemedine could be related to the stimulation of the hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons. 
In an single dose study in rats (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg), naldemedine was present in the brain from 4 hours 
post-dose and occupancies of naldemedine against opioid receptors was also observed in dose-dependent 
manner. These data supported the possibility that naldemedine has effects on hypothalamic-pituitary axis 
at ≥ 10 mg/kg. The second possible mechanism is that naldemedine stimulates prolactin release via the 
ovarian  function  in  rats,  as  prolactin  increased  has  been  observed  only  in  females.  It  is  known  that 
oestrogen, which is mainly secreted by the ovary, stimulates prolactin release by enhancing the growth of 
prolactin  producing  cells  and  also  stimulates  prolactin  production.  However,  the  exact  mechanism  of 
prolactin increase by naldemedine has not been clearly elucidated by mechanistic studies. Taking into 
account that the effects on oestrous cycle observed in rats are considered the consequence of prolactin 
increase, that the mechanism of prolactin increase has not been elucidated and that in human prolactin 
increase  has  been  observed  at  higher  doses,  the  applicant  commits  to  follow  up  on  prolactin-related 
effects in humans in the post-authorisation setting.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant has presented a comprehensive non-clinical study package demonstrating naldemedines 
effect in preventing opiod-induced constipation, in both mice, rats and ferrets.  
Naldemedine was tested for in vitro antagonistic and agonistic activities against rat µ-, δ-, and κ-opioid 
receptors. The results indicate that the functional activities of naldemedine against rat opioid receptors 
were comparable to those against human opioid receptors.  
Naldemedine is described as a non-competitive antagonist by the Applicant. However, upon further 
review of the provided nonclinical studies (studies S-297995-EB-331-R and R-297995-EF-013-R) it is 
unclear what the nature of antagonism of naldemedine is.The applicant determines non-competitive 
characteristic based solely on naldemedine not acting as a competitive antagonist – without taking into 
consideration that other types of binding than competitive and non-competitive also exist. Naldemedine 
is also described as a naltrexone derivative, and naltrexone being a competitive antagonist, contributes to 
the theory that naldemedine would also be acting as a competitive antagonist. Therefore it is concluded 
that naldemedine most likely is best described as a competitive antagonist. However, no further 
nonclinical elaboration will be pursued, as 1) the nature of naldemedines antagonistic effect is not 
mentioned in the SmPC, 2) the applicant included the following sentence in the SmPC; There is limited 
experience in patients treated with opioid pain medicinal product(s) at doses more than the equivalent of 
400 mg of morphine. There is no experience in patients treated for constipation induced by partial opioid 
mu-agonists (e.g. buprenorphine).

The peripherally- and centrally-mediated withdrawal symptoms induced by naldemedine were assessed 
in morphine-dependent mice and rats. In mice, naldemedine caused a peripherally-mediated withdrawal 
symptom (diarrhoea – up to 10 mg/kg). In rats, it caused peripherally-mediated withdrawal symptoms 
from 0.3 mg/kg and a centrally-mediated withdrawal symptom (teeth chattering) at 3 mg/kg (the highest 
tested dose). In ferrets 0.3 mg/kg naldemedine dosed orally completely inhibited the morphine-induced 
emetic responses 30 minutes to 6 hours post-dose. In clinic, no effect has been observed on 
centrally-mediated analgesia. Since Naldemedine is a μ-receptor antagonist and as such, has the 
potential to affect centrally-mediated μ-receptor agonist activity, a warning was included in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC and an anti-analgesic effect due to centrally-mediated opioid receptor antagonism is 
considered an important potential risk of naldemedine in the RMP (Risk Management Plan). This is only 
expected in patients who have disruptions to the BBB (e.g. patients with primary brain malignancies, CNS 
metastases or other inflammatory conditions). 
No safety concerns were revealed in the safety pharmacology studies performed, nor did naldemedine 
show any potential for abuse in the nonclinical studies performed.  
Pharmacokinetics after oral administration was affected by the food condition in both rats and dogs. 
However, as there was no clinically significant food effect shown in the clinical setting no precautions on 
food effects are considered necessary. 
Naldemedine was widely distributed into tissues of rats, and high levels of radioactivity were detected in 
rectal mucosa, submaxillary gland, liver, parotid gland, and harderian gland. Naldemedine was not 
detected in the brain. 
The toxicity of naldemedine was primarily studied in rats and dogs, but mice and rabbits were used for 
carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity studies respectively. In the rat fertility and early embryonic 
development study, prolongation of dioestrous phase was observed at 10 mg/kg/day and above, but was 
not observed at 1 mg/kg/day (12 times the exposure [AUC0-24hr] in humans at an oral dose of 200 
micrograms).  The effect on oestrous cycle is not considered clinically relevant at the proposed 
therapeutic dose.  No adverse effects were observed in male or female fertility and reproductive 
performance up to 1000 mg/kg/day (in excess of 16,000 times the exposure [AUC0-24hr] in humans at an 
oral dose of 200 micrograms). This information has been included in the SmPC. 
In the pre- and postnatal development study in rats, one dam died at parturition at 1000 mg/kg/day, and 
poor nursing, suppression of body weight gain and decrease in food consumption were noted at 30 and 
1000 mg/kg/day.  Decreases in the viability index on Day 4 after birth were noted at 30 and 
1000 mg/kg/day and low body weights and delayed pinna unfolding were noted at 1000 mg/kg/day in 
pups.  There was no adverse effect on pre- and postnatal development at 1 mg/kg/day (12 times the 
exposure [AUC0-24hr] in humans at an oral dose of 200 micrograms). This information has been included 
in the SmPC. 
Placental transfer of [carbonyl-14C]-naldemedine-derived radioactivity was observed in pregnant rats. 
[Carbonyl-14C]-naldemedine-derived radioactivity was excreted into milk in lactating rats. The use of 
naldemedine during pregnancy is therefore not recommended in the SmPC as it may precipitate opioid 
withdrawal in a foetus due to the immature foetal blood brain barrier. Also, as there is a theoretical 
possibility that naldemedine could provoke opioid withdrawal in a breast-fed neonate whose mother is 
taking an opioid receptor agonist the SmPC recommends not to use naldemedine during breast-feeding. 
In juvenile toxicity studies in rats, at the same dose levels, exposure in juvenile animals (PND 10) was 
increased compared to adult animals (1.5 to 3-fold). Novel histopathology findings were observed at all 
doses tested in female rats in mammary glands (increased incidences in lobuloalveolar hyperplasia) and 
in ovaries (tertiary follicles/luteal cysts) in addition to irregular oestrous cycles and vaginal mucification 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

already observed in adult animals (the lowest dose tested corresponded to an exposure margin of 6 or 
more, depending on the age of the pups). Changes indicative of an early onset of sexual maturity 
including 3-days earlier vaginal opening were also observed, but only at high exposures considered 
sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure at an oral dose of 200 micrograms. 
Two additional mechanistic studies clearly showed that prolactin level was increased after naldemedine 
administration in female rats. Oestrus cycle prolongation was observed in female rats at all dose levels.  
The exact mechanism of prolactin increase by naldemedine has not been clearly elucidated. Taking into 
account that the effects on oestrous cycle observed in rats are considered the consequence of prolactin 
increase that the mechanism of prolactin increase has not been elucidated and that in human prolactin 
increase has been observed at higher doses the applicant will be monitor prolactin-related effects in 
humans in the post-authorisation setting and cases reporting relevant MedDRA PTs (Blood prolactin 
increased, Blood prolactin abnormal, Hyperprolactinaemia) will be followed up for further information. 
Carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies did not show any relevant findings. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical profile of naldemedine was established in a comprehensive investigational program that 
included studies of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicity. Non clinical studies do not reveal special hazard for humans.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. During a routine 
GCP inspection one site from the pivotal study V9235 was excluded due to suspected data manipulation 
and due to further critical GCP findings the applicant was requested to submit a re-analysis of efficacy 
data of the three pivotal studies V9231, V9232 and V9235. None of the above actions changed the overall 
results of the studies. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The clinical program for the treatment of OIC in subjects with chronic non-cancer pain encompasses of 2 
phase 2 studies (V9214 and V9221) and 3 phase 3 studies (V9231, V9232 and V9235) plus 2 phase 3 
supportive studies (V9238 and V9239) and for the treatment of OIC in subjects with cancer encompasses 
of 1 phase 2 study (V9222) and 2 phase 3 studies (V9236 and V9237) as illustrated in the table below:

The clinical pharmacology programme for naldemedine consisted of 12 Phase 1 studies conducted in 
healthy subjects and in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment. The PK of naldemedine was also 
determined in 3 Phase 2 studies in subjects with OBD, subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC, and 
in subjects with cancer and OIC. In addition, a popPK analysis was performed. 
Different formulations were used throughout clinical development: naldemedine oral solution or 
suspension in the first clinical trials, followed by 0.1, 1 and 10 mg dose phase 1 to phase 2 tablets and 
finally the phase 3 immediate-release tablet (identical to the commercial formulation) containing 0.2 mg 
of naldemedine. Based on the 90% CI for AUC of naldemedine, bioequivalence was concluded between 
the oral solution and the phase 1/2 tablet formulation and between the two tablet formulations. The small 
changes in Cmax (up to 13%) were not considered to be clinically relevant.  
The bioanalytical reports for analytical methods used in each study were provided.  
The validation of HPLC methods for the determination of naledemedine and its metabolites and other 
co-administered drugs was carried out at various analytical laboratories. The characteristics of linearity, 
within- and between-run accuracy and precision, recovery, selectivity, sensitivity, dilution integrity, 
matrix effect, hemolysis effect, re-injection reproducibility and stability have been validated and all 
validation reports were also provided. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Naldemedine was rapidly absorbed with Tmax attained at 0.5h to 0.75h after single doses of 0.1 to 100 
mg and after daily doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg for up to 28 days of naldemedine. Geometric mean 
naldemedine Cmax and AUC0-inf were 3.07 ng/mL and 23.79 ng·hr/ml, respectively, after a single 0.2 
mg dose of the naldemedine commercial formulation in the fasted state. 
The potential of naldemedine as a substrate of efflux transporters was also investigated using Caco-2 
cells. The efflux ratio decreased significantly in the presence of P-gp inhibitors, but did not decrease when 
BCRP function was down-regulated. Therefore, it was concluded that naldemedine is a P-gp substrate, but 
not a BCRP substrate. 
Concomitant food intake reduced the maximum plasma concentration after a single 0.2 mg dose by 35%, 
delayed time to Cmax from 0.75 hours to 2.5 hours, but did not influence AUC. These small differences in 
the Cmax and Tmax of naldemedine were not considered to be clinically meaningful. Furthermore, in the 
Phase 3 studies, naldemedine was administered without regard to food. Hence, it is reported in the SmPC 
that naldemedine can be taken with or without food.

No absolute bioavailability study was conducted. The major metabolites detected in faeces and urine 
(benzamidine and carboxylic acid) are assumed to be formed by enterobacteria prior to reaching systemic 
circulation, but the possibility that naldemedine is also metabolized to nor-naldemedine (or other 
metabolites) in the intestine and liver prior to reaching systemic circulation is still remained. The available 
data only allow a rough estimation of the absolute bioavailability. 
Distribution 
In vitro studies showed that the plasma protein binding of naldemedine is relatively high with binding of 
93.2% to 94.2%, which was independent of the concentration. This is in line with the unbound fraction 
data observed in vivo in patients with normal and impaired renal and hepatic function. Naldemedine 
seems to be predominantly bound to human serum albumin and to a lesser extent to α1-acid-glycoprotein 
and γ-globulin.  
The blood-to-plasma ratio was 13.5 to 16.3% in vitro, suggesting that naldemedine does not associate 
with the red blood cells to a meaningful extent. The apparent volume of distribution during the terminal 
phase (Vz/F) in healthy subjects was 155 L. 
Elimination 
The apparent terminal elimination half-life of naldemedine was approximately 11 hours and apparent 
clearance (CL/F) was 8.41 L/h after a single 0.2 mg dose of the to-be-marketed formulation in healthy 
subjects.  
Naldemedine was not found to be a substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 when 
incubating transporter-transfected HEK cells with 0.5 and 2 µM naldemedine. Of note, no involvement of 
renal uptake transporters was shown, although the renal clearance of naldemedine suggests involvement 
of active secretion.  
Naldemedine is extensively metabolized in the liver and by enterobacteria after oral administration. In 
vitro experiments with cryopreserved human hepatocytes and human liver microsomes indicated that 
naldemedine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A4 to form nor-naldemedine, which is in line with in vivo 
results following administration of the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin and the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole 
(see further). UGT1A3 was found to mediate naldemedine 3-G and naldemedine 6-G formation. 
Benzamidine, the major metabolite in urine and faeces, was not detected in vitro, which supports the 
assumption that the oxadiazole ring of naldemedine is cleaved by enterobacteria forming benzamidine 
and naldemedine-carboxylic acid.  
Since naldemedine is cleaved by enterobacteria, two different labels were used in the mass balance study 
(Oxadiazole-14C and Carbonyl-14C). Following oral administration of a single 2 mg dose of radio-labelled 
naldemedine, the main component in plasma was identified as naldemedine, whereas the systemic 
exposure of nor-naldemedine and naldemedine 3-G was 9% to 13% and 1% to 2%, respectively, of that 
of naldemedine. None of the metabolites contributed to > 10% of total plasma radioactivity and no 
metabolites are expected to contribute substantially to the pharmacological effect (see NC AR). A longer 
half-life of total plasma radioactivity than for parent compound was observed and a mean fraction of 35 
to 26% of the radioactivity in the pooled plasma samples remained unextracted. A longer half-life of total 
plasma radioactivity vs. parent could indicate circulating metabolite(s) with a longer half-life than parent 
and/or radioactivity associated with binding to plasma proteins or other proteins. The applicant concluded 
that it is unlikely that the longer t½,z of radioactivity in plasma is due to covalent binding of naldemedine 
and its metabolites to plasma proteins, but suggests that the longer half-life of total plasma radioactivity 
is due to nor-naldemedine (longer t½,z compared to parent) which is not a reactive metabolite. Indeed, 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 36/209 
 
 
 
 
the t½,z of total radioactivity (i.e 20.4 h), although longer than that of naldemedine, is still relatively 
short and substantially shorter compared to compounds known to covalently bind to plasma proteins. The 
incomplete extraction recovery of radiolabelled material from plasma, which increases over time, was not 
discussed by the applicant. However, it seems most likely that (unquantified) minor secondary 
metabolites with a longer t½,z than naldemedine further contribute to the longer t½,z of radioactivity in 
plasma. Overall, taken into account the relatively short t½,z of total radioactivity and the observed safety 
profile of naldemedine, no further investigations are considered necessary. 
The urinary excretion profiles were similar after [oxadiazole-14C]- or [carbonyl-14C]-naldemedine 
administration showing renal elimination of naldemedine (20% of dose) and benzamidine being the major 
metabolite in urine (30% of dose). For the oxadiazole labelled naldemedine, 57.3% and 34.8% of the 
administered dose was excreted in urine and faeces, respectively, with an overall recovery of total 
radioactivity of 92%, and, for the carbonyl labelled naldemedine, 20.4% and 64.3% of the administered 
dose was excreted in urine and faeces, respectively, with an overall recovery of total radioactivity of 85%. 
This is not in accordance with the recommendations of the Guideline on the Investigation of Drug 
Interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr.*). Additionally, for the carbonyl labelled naldemedine, only 
51.9 % of the dose could be profiled, which is less than 80% of the recovered radioactivity. According to 
the Applicant, the lower recovery after a single oral administration of [carbonyl-14C]-naldemedine is due 
to sustained excretion of radioactivity in faeces at the time of discharge of subjects. Still according to the 
Applicant, this might be due to enterohepatic circulation of a large number of supposed minor metabolites 
having morphinan skeleton since enterohepatic circulation has been reported for drugs having morphinan 
skeleton. This hypothesis is considered plausible. Furthermore, lower recovery of radioactivity after 
administration of [carbonyl-14C]-naldemedine is in line with findings for compounds predominantly 
excreted in faeces (Roffey et al., 2007), which is the case for naldemedine. Overall, as the main excretion 
route and metabolic pathways have been identified, the applicant’s conclusion that lower than expected 
recovery of total radioactivity is not considered to have a substantial impact on the conclusion of the 
human mass balance study is agreed upon. 
The proposed biotransformation pathway of naldemedine is presented in the figure below:

The structure of naldemedine incorporates four chiral centers. Isomers of naldemedine are detected using 
reversed phase HPLC analysis methods because naldemedine is not an enantiomer but a diastereomer. 
However, no isomers of naldemedine were detected in plasma of rats, dogs, and humans. In addition, all 
the metabolites detected in the in vivo metabolic profiling of rats, dogs and humans maintained the same 
stereochemistry of four chiral centres as that of naldemedine, suggesting that the four chiral centres in 
the structure of naldemedine are unlikely to be potential metabolic sites. Furthermore, there have been 
no reports of in vivo interconversion for naltrexone and oxycodone which have a similar skeleton to 
naldemedine. Based on these observations and information, in vivo interconversion of naldemedine is not 
considered to occur. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Linearity/Non-linearity 
Naldemedine showed dose-proportional PK after single and multiple dose administration, both in healthy 
volunteers as in patients. Dose-proportionality is adequately described in the SmPC. 
A slight accumulation (maximal 1.3-fold) was reported for Cmax and AUC of naldemedine after once daily 
administration for 10 days in healthy volunteers and for 28 days in patients with non-cancer pain and OIC. 
Pharmacokinetic steady state was attained approximately 2 days after the start of multiple dose 
administration. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
A modest inter-individual variability has been noted for naldemedine. Intra- and inter-individual 
variability is moderate with CV% of 25-38 for the principal PK parameters. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses 
A population PK analysis to evaluate the effects of influencing factors on the PK of naldemedine was 
performed using 8146 naldemedine plasma concentrations from  949 subjects in a pooled dataset from 10 
Phase 1, 3 Phase 2, and 5 Phase 3 studies in  healthy subjects, subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and 
OIC, subjects with cancer  and OIC, subjects with renal impairment, and subjects with hepatic impairment 
[Studies V9211, V9213, V9215, V9218, V9219, V921A, V921B, V921C, V921D, V921E, V9214, V9221, 
V9222, V9231, V9232, V9236, V9238 and V9239].  
Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling was performed using NONMEM®. A two-compartment model with 
first-order absorption and absorption lag time was used as a structural pharmacokinetic model. An 
exponential error model was used for inter-individual variability and proportional error model was used 
for intra-individual variability. 
For model building, age, body weight, BMI, gender (male, female), albumin, AST (aspartate 
aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), total bilirubin, CLcr, race/ethnicity (“White” or 
“non-White”, “Japanese” or “non-Japanese”, “Hispanic or Latino” or “Not Hispanic or Latino”), health 
status (healthy subjects/subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC/subjects with cancer and OIC) 
and dosing conditions (dosing in the fasted/fed state, with/without concomitant use of P-gp/CYP3A 
inhibitor) were tested as a covariate on apparent total clearance (CL/F). Age, body weight, BMI, gender, 
race/ethnicity, health status, and dosing conditions were tested as a covariate on apparent distribution 
volume of central compartment (Vc/F). Age, gender, health status and dosing conditions were tested as 
a covariate on Ka (absorption rate constant). The effect of concomitant use of CYP3A inducers was not 
tested because there were few subjects included in the population pharmacokinetics with concomitant

use of CYP3A inducers in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (n=10 for strong CYP3A inducer; n=6 for moderate 
CYP3A inducer) [Study S-297995-CB-318-N].  
After model building, Age, CLcr, race (White or non-White) and Gender were suggested to be covariates 
on CL/F, Body weight, health status (healthy subjects, subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC, or 
subjects with cancer and OIC) and food condition (fasted or fed) were suggested to be covariates on Vc/F, 
and Age was suggested to be a covariate on Ka, respectively.  
The effects of selected covariates (ie, age, creatinine clearance [CLcr], race, gender, body weight, health 
status [healthy subjects, subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC, or subjects with cancer and OIC] 
and food condition [fasted, fed]) on the mean (±SD) Bayesian AUC and Cmax estimates were evaluated. 
These covariates selected were not considered to provide clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic 
differences and no dose adjustment is required for these factors. 
The table below summarises the final model parameter estimates as well as bootstrap confidence 
intervals.

Table 3 Population PK Parameter Estimates for the Final Model 
Limitations were identified in the methodology used for model building. Especially, the data from OINE 
study should have been included in the model building data set or used to externally validate the model. 
Even though it is agreed that OINE study design is not clinically relevant for healthy subjects and OIC 
patients, the fact that the proposed model shows good predictive performances on these data would bring 
additional evidence on the liability and the robustness of the model. The applicant was therefore asked to 
provide results of fitting performances of the proposed model on data from OINE study. It was noticed 
that, while the fitting performances were acceptable for PK concentrations after 0.1mg, the model clearly 
over-predicted concentrations after 1mg dose. The population model is therefore not considered to 
adequately describe the observed concentrations. The reason why data from the concomitant treatment 
period in the Phase 1 DDI studies [1202V9218, 1403V921D, and 1502V921E]) in which a P-gp/CYP3A 
inhibitor/inducer was co-administered with naldemedine and reason why 10 and 6 patients in phase III 
studies taking moderate and strong inducers were excluded was not provided. This was questioned given 
that inclusion of these data would permit better characterization of covariate effects of P-gp/CYP3A 
inhibitor/inducer on CL and F. Parameterization of the model is possible to differentiate the different 
Rizmoic Assessment report

scenarios. Moreover, it is always considered better practice to use all available relevant data in model 
development and/or external evaluation. The applicant was therefore asked to provide results of fitting 
performances of the proposed model on data from Phase 1 DDI studies [Studies V9218, V921D and 
V921E]. However, the fitting performance for the sequences were patients were only administered 
naldemedine were not provided, neither were conditional weight residuals related plots.  
Data provided were therefore not considered sufficient to support the adequacy of the population model 
to adequately the observed concentrations. 
Correlated covariates such as health status and age, health status and formulation, health status and 
renal function (CLcr), age and strong inhibitors, Japanese and weight, CLcr and bodyweight, CLcr and 
age, formulation and age etc were allowed to be tested on the same covariate during the forward inclusion 
step and some were retained in the final model. This questions the adequacy and the validity of the 
proposed final model given that it cannot be excluded that the estimation of some covariate effects were 
confounded. It was asked that covariate analysis was redone, driven by mechanistic understanding and 
pharmacological or physiological rationale and that simultaneous test of correlated covariates are 
avoided. The applicant acknowledges the existence of correlations in covariates concomitantly used in the 
final model. It is argued the covariates included in the developed population PK model are physiologically 
reasonable. This is only partially accepted. The applicant provided the results of correlation analysis for 
the different correlated variables in the final model and provided evidence that these correlations are 
consistent with what is always expected in the target population. The results showed that some of the 
covariates in the final model were strongly correlated. As acknowledged by the applicant, covariates were 
retained in the model when they were statistically significant according to the standard procedure based 
on objective function in NONMEN even if they had significant correlations. This is not acceptable for a 
model to be considered predictive of yet unobserved data.  
CLcr was retained in the final model, despite not meeting the statistical inclusion criteria, based on a 
strong pharmacological or physiological rationale for its inclusion. It is hardly understandable why the 
same approach was not applied to CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. The approach taken by the applicant is 
not supported. In the applicant’s answer, it is acknowledged that the effect of CYP3A inducers on 
naldemedine pharmacokinetics could not be appropriately assessed during the population PK modelling 
because the number of patients with concomitant use of CYP3A inducers in Phase 2/3 studies were limited 
(N=16 out of 949). This is concurred. One solution to this would be to include data from DDI studies in the 
modelling dataset and fix parameters parameter estimates to the one estimated using 
non-compartmental analysis and to ensure that the model still fits the data. While it is acknowledged that 
PK modelling results were not used to inform labelling, the applicant was strongly advised to do this 
exercise. This would allow having consistent results across the different analyses.  
Similarly, the fact that neither liver function enzymes nor CYP inducers/inhibitors were included in the 
model despite the fact that the drug is known to be mostly cleared liver metabolism through CYP 
decreases the liability of the proposed model. The applicant was asked to include data from DDI studies 
in the modelling dataset and fix parameters parameter estimates to the one estimated using 
non-compartmental analysis and to ensure that the model still fits the data. While it is acknowledged that 
PK modelling results were not used to inform labelling, the applicant is strongly advised to do this 
exercise. This would allow having consistent results across the different analyses. The applicant did the 
exercise as requested by the CHMP but was not able to provide an optimized model able to adequately fit 
all the available data. This shows once more that the proposed model still needs refinement before it can 
be consider adequate for predictive purposes. 
However, as the model is currently not used for labelling and has for now quite low impact in the overall 
description of the drug’s PK deficiencies were not further pursued in this procedure. The present model 
Rizmoic Assessment report

would need further refinement if the applicant proposes to use the modelling results to support any 
important claim post-marketing. 
Healthy subjects versus OIC patients 
Pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects ([Study V921A]; Dose 0.2 mg, to-be-marketed Tablet) and OBD 
subjects with chronic non-cancer pain ([Study V9214]; Dose 0.1 mg and 0.3 mg, 0.1 mg tablet) were 
compared. Pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and OIC subjects were also compared by population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of naldemedine indicated that health 
status (healthy subjects/ subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC/ subjects with cancer and OIC) 
was a significant covariate on Vc/F; however, Vc/F of OIC subjects with chronic non-cancer and cancer 
pain are only 1.20- and 1.27-fold greater than that of healthy subjects and health status was not a 
significant covariate on CL/F.  
The results suggested that no clinically meaningful difference in naldemedine pharmacokinetics were 
observed among healthy subjects, subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC and subjects with 
cancer and OIC. 
Special populations 
No specific studies have been conducted to directly investigate the effect of age, gender, and race on 
naldemedine PK but effects have been estimated from the population PK analysis. Specific studies in 
subjects with renal impairment (Study V921B) and hepatic impairment (Study V921C) have been 
performed.  
Impaired renal function 
Study V921B, a Phase 1, multi-centre, open-label, non-randomised study was conducted  to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of naldemedine in subjects with varying degrees of renal 
impairment and in matched control subjects with normal renal function. Pharmacokinetics of a single 0.2 
mg dose of naldemedine in subjects with mild (MDRD-eGFR 60 to < 90 mL/min), moderate (MDRD-eGFR 
30 to <60 mL/min), or severe renal impairment (MDRD-eGFR <30 mL/min) or ESRD requiring 
haemodialysis was compared with that of healthy subjects with normal renal function to 
demographically-matched subjects with moderate renal impairment. The effect of haemodialysis on the 
clearance of naldemedine was determined both before and after haemodialysis. Renal function was 
classified at the screening based on estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) using Cockcroft-Gault equation 
for subjects with normal renal function and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the 
modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation for subjects with renal impairment. A single oral 
dose of 0.2 mg naldemedine was administered to subjects with normal renal function or mild, moderate 
or severe renal impairment on the morning of Day 1 in the fasted state. Subjects with ESRD requiring 
haemodialysis were dosed approximately 1 to 2 hours after completion of a haemodialysis session on Day 
1 in the fasted state, and 2 hours prior to start of haemodialysis on Day 15 in the fasted state. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of naldemedine are summarised by renal function group in the table 
below. Results of ANOVA indicated that geometric mean ratios (corresponding 90% CI) of AUC0-inf in mild, 
moderate, and severe renal impairment and subjects with ESRD requiring haemodialysis compared to 
healthy controls were 1.0768 (0.9036 – 1.2832), 1.0603 (0.8898 – 1.2635), 1.3777 (1.1400 – 1.6650), 
and 0.8276 (0.6945 – 0.9862), respectively. The geometric mean values for t 1/2,z were prolonged in 
subjects with severe renal impairment (18.7 hr) compared to healthy controls (13.8 hr). However, the 
pharmacokinetic change is small (< 1.4-fold) and no clinically meaningful differences in naldemedine 
pharmacokinetics were observed in subjects with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment or ESRD 
requiring haemodialysis compared with subjects with normal renal function. No dose adjustment for 
Rizmoic Assessment report

naldemedine is necessary in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, or subjects with 
ESRD requiring dialysis.  
Table 4 Summary of Naldemedine Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Various Renal Functional Groups and 
Statistical Analysis of Effect of Renal Impairment on the Pharmacokinetics of Naldemedine. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Study V921C was a multi-centre, open-label, non-randomised study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
safety and tolerability of naldemedine in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh 
Class B) hepatic impairment and in healthy matched control subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Pharmacokinetics after administration of a single 0.2 mg dose of naldemedine in subjects with mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment was compared with that of demographically-matched healthy subjects with 
normal hepatic function. Healthy control subjects were matched to subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment with respect to age (± 10 years), BMI (± 20%), and gender. A single oral dose of 0.2 mg 
naldemedine was administered to each subject in the morning on Day 1 of the study in the fasted state. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of naldemedine are summarised by hepatic function in the table below. 
Results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the geometric mean values for AUC0-inf were not

EMA/466/2019

increased in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects with 
normal hepatic function with geometric mean ratios (corresponding 90% confidence intervals [CI]) of 
0.8284 (0.6569 - 1.0448) and 1.0516 (0.8339 - 1.3262), respectively. The geometric mean values for 
t 1/2,z were not prolonged in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (mild: 14.0 hr, 
moderate: 13.3 hr) compared with healthy subjects with normal hepatic function (13.5 hr). Therefore, no 
clinically meaningful differences in naldemedine pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with 
mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B) and healthy subjects with normal 
hepatic function. No dose adjustment for naldemedine in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment is necessary. 
Table 5 Summary of Naldemedine Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Various Hepatic Functional Groups 
and Statistical Analysis of Effect of Hepatic Impairment on the Pharmacokinetics of Naldemedine. 
The pharmacokinetics of naldemedine has not been evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment 
(Child-Pugh Class C), therefore naldemedine should be avoided as described in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Gender  
No specific study was conducted to directly investigate the effect of gender on naldemedine 
pharmacokinetics. The effect of gender was evaluated in population pharmacokinetic analysis showing 
that gender was a significant covariate on CL/F of naldemedine. But the CL ratio of female to male was 
only 0.902 and the effect of gender on CL/F or AUC was small.  
These results suggested that no clinically meaningful differences by gender in naldemedine 
pharmacokinetics were observed. No dose adjustment is required for males or females. 
Race 
No specific study was conducted to directly investigate the effect of race on naldemedine 
pharmacokinetics.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 44/209 
 
 
 
 
 
A comparison of naldemedine pharmacokinetics at doses ranging from 0.1 to 2 mg in the fasted state was 
conducted between Japanese healthy subjects [Single dose study V9211; Dose 0.1 and 0.3 mg, solution] 
and US healthy subjects [Mass balance study V9215; Dose 2 mg, solution and BA/FE study 
(To-be-marketed Tablet) V921A; Dose 0.2 mg, 0.2 mg tablet]. The effect of race (“White” or “non-White”, 
“Japanese” or “non-Japanese”) was also evaluated in population pharmacokinetic analysis. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of naldemedine showed that CL/F of non-White was smaller than that of White; 
however, CL/F ratio of non-White to White was only 0.870 and the effects of race on CL/F or AUC were 
small. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of naldemedine showed that there were not statistically 
significant pharmacokinetic differences between Japanese and non-Japanese.  
No clinically meaningful differences in naldemedine pharmacokinetics were observed between White and 
non-White subjects and among races. Hence, no dose adjustment is required based on race. 
Weight 
No specific study was conducted to directly investigate the effect of body weight on naldemedine 
pharmacokinetics. The effect of body weight or BMI was evaluated in population pharmacokinetic 
analysis. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of naldemedine showed that body weight was a significant 
covariate on Vc/F of naldemedine.  
These results suggested that there were no tendency between AUC and body weight, and between AUC 
and BMI. While, these results suggested there were negative correlations between Cmax and body weight 
and between Cmax and BMI, however, Cmax ratios for all groups categorised by body weight or BMI were 
in the range from 0.76-fold to 1.31-fold and 0.90-fold to 1.12-fold compared to overall mean Cmax of 2.20 
and 2.65 ng/mL in subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC in Phase 3 studies [Study V9231 and 
V9232] and subjects with cancer and OIC in Phase 3 studies [Study V9236], respectively. In conclusion, 
no clinically meaningful differences were observed in naldemedine pharmacokinetics by body weight and 
BMI. No dose adjustment is required for body weight and BMI. 
Elderly 
No specific study was conducted to directly investigate the effect of age on naldemedine 
pharmacokinetics. The effect of age was evaluated in a population pharmacokinetic analysis [Study 
S-297995-CB-318-N]. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of naldemedine showed that age was a 
significant covariate on CL/F and K a of naldemedine. But the power coefficient for age on CL/F was only 
-0.195 and the effect of age on CL/F or AUC was small.  
These results suggested that no clinically meaningful differences in naldemedine pharmacokinetics were 
observed between elderly subjects above the age of 65 years and non-elderly subjects. No dose 
adjustment is required for elderly subjects above the age of 65 years. 
Children 
The pharmacokinetics of naldemedine in paediatric subjects has not been established. 
In the SmPC, the applicant mentions in Section 4.2 that for paediatric population: “The safety and efficacy 
of naldemedine in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not yet been established”. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro drug-drug interactions 
Before the in vivo studies, the potentials of naldemedine and nor-naldemedine to inhibit or induce the 
metabolism of other drugs or the potentials to inhibit any of the transporters (known to be involved in 
clinically relevant in vivo interactions) have been investigated in the in vitro studies. Nor-naldemedine is

the main phase I metabolite. Because the AUC of nor-naldemedine is not both larger than one fourth of 
the AUC of parent drug and larger than 10% of the drug-related exposure, the determination of the 
inhibitory/inducer potentials on enzymes and transporters is considered not required. 
Interactions related to enzyme inhibition 
The in vitro studies conducted suggest that naldemedine at therapeutic dose is not expected to cause 
clinically relevant direct or time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP1A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19,  CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A and CYP4A11. The same conclusions can be drawn for 
nor-naldemedine, except for CYP2E1 and CYP4A11 that were not investigated. No in vitro or no dedicated 
in vivo studies have been performed to investigate whether naldemedine inhibits 
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes (UGTs).  
Interactions related to transporters inhibition 
The relative activities in the uptake transporters OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 were 
more than 50 % at 4.51 µM naldemedine without preincubation with naldemedine. However, the impact 
of a pre-incubation step on the inhibitory potential of naldemedine are recommended to be investigated 
post authorisation for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3, taking into account the actual naldemedine 
concentrations present in the in vitro system used. A low potential to cause a clinically significant BCRP 
inhibition has been shown. 
Study R297995-PF-067-N shows that naldemedine is a very slight P-gp inhibitor at high concentrations. 
There were 80% efflux of digoxin remaining in presence of 3.40 μM naldemedine. The risk for drug-drug 
interactions through an inhibition mechanism at the level of investigated efflux transporter P-gp is 
unlikely at clinically relevant naldemedine concentrations. 
The potential inhibitory impact of the main metabolite nor-naldemedine on transporters has also been 
investigated. No inhibitory effects have been shown for P-gp, BCRP. The cleared volumes of substrate in 
the uptake transporters OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 were more than 50 % of 
control at 20 nmol/L nor-naldemedine and consequently it can be concluded that the risk for 
drug-interactions at the investigated transporters is unlikely at clinically relevant nor-naldemedine 
concentrations. However, the adequacy of the length of the pre-incubation step used for OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 to ensure sufficient time for time-dependent inhibition to be manifested is 
questioned and results for P-gp should have been further confirmed in another separate system. 
Nevertheless, these issues were not pursued for nor-naldemedine as the determination of its inhibitory 
potential on transporters is considered not required.  
Regarding the efflux transporters MATE1, MATE2-K and BSEP, no or only minor inhibitions have been 
found at 0.18 µM naldemedine or at 20 nmol/L nor-naldemedine and consequently clinically relevant 
inhibitions can be excluded.

*relative activity in the uptake transporter inhibition  
** The actual concentrations of naldemedine in the in vitro inhibitor assessment for P-gp, MATE1/2-K, 
and BSEP were calculated using the adhesion ratios to experimental devices. The adhesion ratios 
measured in the inhibition studies for P-gp and MATE1/2-K were used in the calculation of actual 
concentrations for efflux transporter (BCRP) and uptake transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, 
OAT1, and OAT3), respectively 
Interactions related to enzyme/transporter induction  
The in vitro studies S-297995-PF-176-N, S-297995-PF-298-N, S-297995-PF-347-N aimed to investigate 
induction potential of naldemedine and nor-naldemedine on CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5 and UGT1A2, 
UGT1A6 and UGT2B7.  
Naldemedine and nor-naldemedine have little or no inductive effect on CYP1A2 mRNA levels at clinically 
relevant maximal plasma concentrations and maximal intestinal concentrations.   
As regard CYP2B6, the results for induction of naldemedine or nor-naldemedine can be considered as 
negatives.  
Increasing CYP3A4 mRNA levels  (> 2 fold changes) with increasing concentrations of naldemedine were 
observed in all donors, as well as concentration-dependent increases in CYP3A4/5 activity. Based on the 
basic method, a clinically significant CYP3A4 inducer potential cannot be excluded. The applicant has 
therefore further assessed the clinical CYP3A4 induction potential by calculating the AUC ratio (AUCR) of 
midazolam by both the mechanistic static model equation and the RIS correlation method. The estimated 
AUCR using the mechanistic static model were included in the interval 0.8-1.25. No in vivo studies are 
therefore indicated to further assess the CYP3A4 inducer potential. Using the RIS correlation method with 
the data from two donors on three (RIS correlation data not available for 1 donor), the same trend than 
those reported with the mechanistic static model with AUCR > 0.8 was observed. Since clinically 
significant CYP3A4 induction is not expected based on the conclusions from the mechanistic static model 
and the RIS correlation method, clinically relevant induction of CYP3A5, CYP2C and transporters induced 
through mechanisms similar than those for CYP3A4 can be considered unlikely at the intended clinical 
dose (0.2 mg/day).  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 48/209 
 
 
 
 
Negative results were observed for CYP3A4 induction when the human hepatocytes were treated with 
nor-naldemedine. 
Because clinically significant induction mediated via PXR/CAR and Ah-receptor is not expected in vivo 
since the likelihood of a significant CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 induction effect of naldemedine has been 
excluded based on in vitro experiments (S-297995-PF-176-N, S-297995-PF-298-N and 
S-297995-PF-347-N studies), no further investigation of the inducer potential of naldemedine for UGT 
enzymes is needed.  
In Silico 
Physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation study was performed to evaluate the 
effect of repeated administration of moderate CYP3A inducer efavirenz on the pharmacokinetics of 
naldemedine in healthy adult subjects compared to naldemedine alone.  
Simulation of drug-drug interaction was performed for 140 subjects (10 trials, 14 subjects/trial) under 
the situation that efavirenz 400 mg was administered once daily on Day 1 to 17 and naldemedine 0.2 mg 
was co-administered with efavirenz as CYP3A inducer on Day 15.  
PK results of 0.2 mg naldemedine administered alone from 3 phase 1 studies (V921D, V921A and 
S-297995-CB-330-N) and DDI study results co-administered with cyclosporine and fluconazole from 2 
phase 1 studies (V9218 and V921E) were used for model building. The contribution of drug metabolism 
via CYP3A4 was included in the naldemedine PBPK model, and the contribution of drug metabolism via 
UGT1A3 and the transport via P-gp were not included to predict in vivo DDI potency of naldemedine with 
efavirenz, which is not considered to have influence on UGT1A3 and P-gp. 
Co-administration of naldemedine with multiple dose of efavirenz for 15 days demonstrated lower 
naldemedine concentration compared with a single dose of naldemedine. The ratios of geometric mean 
naldemedine Cmax and AUC values following co-administration of efavirenz with naldemedine compared 
with naldemedine alone were 0.59 (range: 0.55 to 0.64) and 0.52 (range: 0.47 to 0.55), respectively, 
from the simulation of 10 trials. 
In conclusion, simulation using PBPK modelling suggested that concomitant use of the moderate CYP3A 
inducer efavirenz 400 mg once daily for 15 days decreased the AUC of naldemedine by 48%. This 
decrease is considered not to be clinically meaningful. However, given the remaining uncertainty in the 
model and given that SIMCYP plateform is currently not considered qualified for to characterize drug 
induction (in the absence of in vivo data), the effect of moderate inducers (e.g. efavirenz,) can therefore 
not be established; therefore, the use of rizmoic acid should cautiously be considered in patients already 
given a moderate inducer (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5).  
In vivo drug-drug interaction studies  
Based on in vitro metabolism and transporter data, in vivo drug-drug interactions of naldemedine were 
designed to assess effects of P-gp inhibition, CYP3A induction and inhibition on naldemedine as a 
substrate.

The effects of co-administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of naldemedine are summarised in the 
figure below: 
Figure 3 Summary of the Effect of Co-administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Naldemedine 
It is not judged necessary to further investigate the metabolites’ exposures in the in vivo interaction 
studies since systemic exposures of nor-naldemedine and naldemedine 3-G were only 9% to 13% and 1% 
to 2%, respectively, of that of naldemedine. Radioactivity accounted for less than 10% of total 
radioactivity exposure across the studies using both labelled compounds. In addition, no antagonistic or 
agonistic activities are expected to be associated to nor-naldemedine at the recommended clinical dose 
(see non clinical aspects). No adverse effects have been observed in the non-clinical safety pharmacology 
section for any metabolites.  
Study 1502V921E with itraconazole/fluconazole 
The study is an open-label, one-sequence, two-period, crossover, drug-drug interaction study to evaluate 
the effect of repeated administration of itraconazole and fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of 
naldemedine in Japanese healthy adult subjects. 
Test product: Naldemedine, 0.2-mg tablet for oral administration. Each subject in Cohort 1 
(itraconazole) and Cohort 2 (fluconazole) received a single 0.2 mg dose of naldemedine in the fasted state 
on Days 1 and 9 of the study. Batch n° CF5005.  
Reference products: Itrizole® Oral Solution 1%, Fluconazole 100-mg capsule. 
A single-dose of naldemedine as victim is appropriate as it has linear pharmacokinetics and the dose used 
(0.2mg) is included in the linear range (0.1-100mg). The systemic exposure of the perpetrators are 
adequate as obtained with sufficient high doses under therapeutic (steady state) conditions (400 mg on 
day 5 and 200 mg once daily on Day 6 to 11 for itraconazole and fluconazole).

Table 8 Summary of Plasma Naldemedine Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Statistical Comparisons 
Following Administration of Naldemedine Alone and Naldemedine plus Itraconazole (PK Parameter 
Population) 
The study indicates that naldemedine exposure increases to a moderate extent (> 2-fold and < 5-fold 
increase) following co-administration of a strong CYPA3A4/P-gp inhibitor: itraconazole increased Cmax, 
AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf of naldemedine by 1.12 fold, 2.65 fold, and 2.91 fold. The clinically meaningful 
effect on naldemedine exposure by itraconazole have been reported in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC. 
The systemic exposure of the perpetrator fluconazole is considered appropriate for moderate CYP3A 
inhibitory potential: 
Table 9 Summary of Plasma Naldemedine Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Statistical Comparisons 
Following Administration of Naldemedine Alone and Naldemedine plus Fluconazole (PK Parameter 
Population) 
Fluconazole increased Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf of naldemedine by 1.38 fold, 1.88 fold, and 1.90 
fold. These results can be categorised as a mild inhibition as it concerns an increase located in the interval 
of 1.25 to 2-fold increase in plasma AUC. Even if it concerns a mild inhibition, caution should be exercised 
as the number of TEAE increased when naldemedine is administered concomitantly with moderate CYP3A 
inhibitors in the clinical studies. Therefore it is mentioned in section 4.5 that concomitant administration 
of moderate CYP3A inhibitors such as fluconazole may increase plasma concentrations of naldemedine 
and patients should be monitored for safety. 
The clinically meaningful effects on naldemedine exposure by itraconazole have been reported in the 
section 4.5 of the SPC. Some examples of well-known strong CYP3A inhibitors are provided in section 4.5. 
It is correctly mentioned that there is no risk of interaction with concomitant use of mild CYP3A inhibitors.

Table 10 Summary of the Statistical Comparisons of Plasma Naldemedine Pharmacokinetic Parameters: 
Naldemedine:Rifampin Versus Naldemedine Alone (PK Parameter Population) 
The geometric LS mean naldemedine Cmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and t1/2,z values were approximately 
38%, 83%, 83%, and 73% lower, respectively, following Naldemedine:Rifampin compared with 
Naldemedine Alone, and the 90% CIs for the ratios of these parameters were completely outside the 0.80 
to 1.25 reference interval usually applied to establish similarity between treatments. The geometric LS 
mean naldemedine CL/F value was approximately 6-fold following Naldemedine:Rifampin compared with 
Naldemedine Alone, and the 90% CI for the ratio of CL/F was completely outside the 0.80 to 1.25 
reference interval. 
A single-dose study is appropriate as naldemedine (victim) has linear pharmacokinetics and the dose 
used (0.2mg) is included in the linear range (0.1-100mg). The systemic exposure of the perpetrator is 
adequate as obtained with the highest recommended doses under therapeutic (steady state) conditions 
(17 consecutive days of 600 mg rifampin once daily QD).  
The clinically meaningful effects on naldemedine exposure by rifampin have been adequately reported in 
sections 4.4 & 4.5 of the SmPC.  
Study 1202V9218 with cyclosporine 
The study is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-way crossover study to evaluate the drug-drug 
interaction of the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporine with the pharmacokinetics of S-297995 in healthy adult 
subjects. Subjects orally received naldemedine 0.4 mg alone and naldemedine co-administered with 
cyclosporine 600 mg solution in the fasted state.

Table 11 Summary of Naldemedine Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Statistical Analysis of Effect of 
Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics of Naldemedine 
Naldemedine has been shown to be a P-gp substrate in vitro, which is further substantiated by preclinical 
models showing limited transfer across the blood-brain barrier. Cyclosporine is recommended as a clinical 
probe for Pg-P inhibition in accordance with the International Transporter Consortium (ITC, Giacomini et 
al. 2010) and the assessor is of the opinion that a single dose of 600 mg would provide sufficiently high 
plasma cyclosporine concentrations to study the effects of P-glycoprotein inhibition on naldemedine PK. 
The study with cyclosporine in healthy volunteers indicates that naldemedine exposure increases to a mild 
extent following co-administration of a P-gp inhibitor: cyclosporine increased the AUC and Cmax of 
naldemedine after single-dose administration by 79% and 45% respectively (< 2-fold but 90% CI AUC: 
1.57-2.02). There were also increases in the Cmax, AUC0-last, for naldemedine metabolites, 
nor-naldemedine and naldemedine 3-G, in the presence of cyclosporine.  
Naldemedine is expected to be soluble in gastrointestinal fluid independently of pH. Hence, the potential 
for drug interaction with gastric acid reducing agents (e.g., proton-pump inhibitors, Histamine 2 
[H2]-blockers and antacids) is considered to be low. No drug interaction studies have been conducted for 
naldemedine with gastric acid-reducing agents. This justification for not submitting a DDI study with 
gastric acid reducing agents was accepted by the CHMP. 
The naldemedine program performed a comprehensive assessment based on in vitro inhibition and 
induction data to evaluate potential interactions that may affect the efficacy of oral contraceptives or 
result in significant DDIs. The assessment included a careful evaluation of the metabolic inhibition 
properties of naldemedine and the potential for induction of CYP and UGT enzymes, which are responsible 
for the metabolism of most estrogen and progestin components of oral contraceptive agents. From the 
results of the assessment, naldemedine is considered unlikely to affect the efficacy of these medicinal 
products.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Naldemedine acts as an antagonist of μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors, and has no agonistic activity at any 
of these opioid receptors.  Naldemedine functions as a μ-opioid receptor antagonist in peripheral tissues, 
in particular the enteric nervous system in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing the constipating 
effects of opioids without reversing centrally-mediated opioid effects.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The analysis populations of the PK/Efficacy analysis and the PK/Safety analysis were described. The 
individual PK parameters (AUC) of naldemedine were used for PK/PD analysis. AUC of the subjects in the 
placebo group were treated as zero (0). 
PK/Efficacy 
Linear and Emax models were used to describe the change in SBM frequency. The linear model 
adequately described the relationship between the change in SBM frequency and predicted naldemedine 
AUC. Although the estimate of the slope for Study No. 1107V9221 was small (0.0169) relative to the 
other studies and its lower limit of 95% confidence interval was slightly lower than 0 (-0.0153), the other 
studies showed clear positive correlation between the change in SBM frequency and naldemedine AUC. 
For the Emax model, the 95% confidence interval of EC50 included zero (0), suggesting the estimates of 
EC50 would not be reliable.

The predictions from the logistic model were presented in Figure below.

The slopes of AUC were similar across all studies and the model well described the observations. The 
probabilities of the SBM responder were calculated based on the developed logistic model by using the 
mean AUC in Table 8 of the summary of clinical pharmacology studies, and relationships between the 
probabilities of the SBM responder and AUC around clinical doses (placebo, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg) were 
summarized in Table 14 of the summary of clinical pharmacology studies. When subjects took 0.2 mg of

naldemedine in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, the probabilities of the number of SBM responders were 
predicted to be 52.7% (patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC in the Phase 2b study; 
1107V9221), 72.1% (cancer patients with OIC in Phase 2b study; 1108V9222), 49.9% (patients with 
chronic non-cancer pain and OIC in Phase 3 studies; 1314V9231 and 1315V9232), and 69.7% (cancer 
patients with OIC in Phase 3 study; 1331V9236). 
PK/Safety 
The relationship between the occurrence of TEAEs and naldemedine AUC was analysed with the logistic 
model. The probability of the occurrence of gastrointestinal, abdominal pain and diarrhoea TEAE 
increased as the AUC increased. The probabilities of the occurrence of any severe gastrointestinal 
disorders, abdominal pain, and diarrhea at naldemedine dose of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg were predicted to be 
less than 3% in patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC. In cancer patients with OIC, the 
probabilities of the occurrence of any severe gastrointestinal disorders, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea at 
naldemedine dose of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg were not estimated because of few number of severe TEAEs 
reported in these studies.  
The relationship between the occurrence of treatment related AE and predicted naldemedine AUC was 
analyzed with the logistic model. The results were similar to those of TEAE.

The probability of the occurrence of any severe gastrointestinal disorders, abdominal pain and diarrhoea 
at naldemedine dose of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg were predicted as less than 3% in subjects with chronic 
non-cancer pain and OIC. In subjects with cancer and OIC, the probability of the occurrence of any severe 
gastrointestinal disorders, abdominal pain and diarrhoea at naldemedine dose of 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg were 
not estimated because of little severe TEAE reported.

Pharmacokinetic comparability bounds representing clinically meaningful treatment differences for 
naldemedine can be based on a 90% CI of (0.50, 2.00) for the geometric mean ratio (GMR) for the 
exposure to naldemedine. These pharmacokinetic comparability bounds are used throughout the 
naldemedine programme to identify clinically meaningful differences for influencing factors, such as 
demographic parameters, renal and hepatic impairment and drug-drug interactions on the 
pharmacokinetics of naldemedine. 
QTc prolongation 
Study V9219 was a double blind (in regard to naldemedine and placebo), randomised, placebo- and 
positive-controlled, 4-period crossover study in healthy male and female subjects using single therapeutic 
(0.2 mg) and supratherapeutic (1 mg) doses of naldemedine, placebo, and moxifloxacin (400 mg) as 
positive control in separate treatment periods.

Fifty-six subjects were randomised and 44 subjects completed the study, 55 subjects were included for 
QT/QTc evaluation and 53 subjects were included for pharmacokinetic evaluation. The principal results 
are illustrated below with the figure to the right representing baseline adjusted QTcF changes: 
The change of QTcF from baseline (ΔQTcF) following 0.2 mg and 1 mg dose of naldemedine were similar 
to placebo. As anticipated there was a clear QTcF prolongation observed after administration of a 400 mg 
dose of the positive control, moxifloxacin.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Analytical methods 
The bioanalytical methods are well described and are in accordance with the current guidelines. These 
bioanalytical methods are correctly validated at various analytical laboratories The characteristics of 
linearity, within- and between-run accuracy and precision, recovery, selectivity, sensitivity, dilution 
integrity, matrix effect, hemolysis effect, re-injection reproducibility and stability are within the 
acceptance specifications if applicable.   
The applicant confirms the absence of ISR in several PK analytical studies (Reports 297995-CF-127-C, 
S-297995-CF-152-C and S-297995-CF-178-C).   Since the studies were conducted from 2009 to 2010, 
the lack of ISR in these studies appears justified. In addition, the applicant states that other ISR data were 
obtained in the same laboratory. Indeed, for further PK analytical studies  [Reports S-297995-CF-326-N, 
S- 297995-CF-328-N, S-297995-CF-327-N, S-297995-CF-217-N, and S-297995-CF- 252-N], the repeat 
analysis of the incurred samples reanalyses was performed and their results met acceptance criteria (at 
least 67% of the reanalysis concentrations is within ±20% of their mean of original and repeat 
concentrations). 
ADME 
The general PK characteristics (ADME) of naldemedine were adequately characterised. Similar oral 
bioavailability among the various formulations used in the naldemedine clinical development programme 
was shown. Food had no clinically significant effect on naldemedine exposure. Consistent results were 
obtained across studies, demonstrating rapid absorption of naldemedine and nor-naldemedine being the 
Rizmoic Assessment report

main metabolite in plasma (contributing to <10% of total plasma radioactivity). Approximately 20% of 
the dose was excreted in urine as unchanged naldemedine. Based on the results of the mass balance 
study and in vitro experiments, the biotransformation pathway of naldemedine was adequately 
characterised. Naldemedine showed dose-proportional PK and a slight accumulation upon multiple 
administration, which is described in the SmPC. 
Dose-proportionality with respect to Cmax and AUC following single-dose administration has been 
reasonably well demonstrated for a wide range of doses including those relevant to the suggested 
posology. Multiple dose administration has been performed with doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg daily. There 
appear to be a reasonable lack of time dependency with accumulation ratios for AUC and Cmax between 
20 and 30%. A formal statistical analysis for time-dependency is presented from multiple-dose (3, 10 and 
30 mg) study V9213. In this analysis, a slight 8% (90% CI 1-15%) increase in AUC exposure for the 3 mg 
dose following ten days of treatment was noted. An 8% increase in AUC following ten days of treatment 
with 3 mg daily is judged to be without clinical relevance. 
Special populations 
According to the results of the specific study (Study V921B), and of the POP PK analysis, a dose of 0.2 mg 
for subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, or ESRD requiring haemodialysis is 
considered appropriate to ensure patient safety, and provide adequate exposure given the efficacy of 0.2 
mg observed in clinical studies.  
No dose adjustment is required in subjects with any degree of renal impairment. 
Based on review of data from the formal hepatic impairment study and review of the POP PK analysis 
report, it is agreed that moderate hepatic dysfunction did not significantly affect naldemedine 
pharmacokinetics.  
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Use in patients 
with severe hepatic impairment is adequately not recommended since effect of severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the pharmacokinetics of naldemedine was not evaluated. 
The conclusion that naldemedine daily dosage will not have to be adjusted for gender, body weight and 
race factors is deemed appropriate based on the available data and accompanying POP PK analysis. It is 
confirmed that the differences in naldemedine exposure with body weight are not considered as clinically 
meaningfuland it has been included in Section 5.2 that the effect of weight on naldemedine exposure is 
not clinically relevant.  
No dose adjustment is recommended for older people.  
Naldemedine must not be used in children because no data in paediatric subjects is available.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses 
Limitations were identified in the methodology used for the pk model. However, as the model has for now 
quite low impact in the overall description of the drug’s PK, it’s deficiencies were not further pursued in 
this procedure. It is noted that the present PK model approach would need further refinement if the 
applicant proposes to use the modelling results to support any claims post-marketing. 
Healthy subjects versus OIC patients 
Based on the pK results collected in the studies, it can be assumed that the pharmacokinetic profiles in 
healthy subjects and OIC patients were similar.

Interactions 
In vitro DDI  
In vitro DDI studies have shown that naldemedine and nor-naldemedine did not expect to cause clinically 
relevant direct or time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP1A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6 and CYP3A or induction of CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 at clinically relevant concentrations. The 
same conclusion can be drawn for the inhibitory potential of naldemedine on CYP2E1 and CYP4A11.  
Naldemedine and nor-naldemedine produced little/no inhibition of P-gp, BCRP, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, 
MATE2-K and BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. Because the transport activities were not 
inhibited by more than 50%, it is unlikely that naldemedine and nor-naldemedine will lead to clinically 
relevant DDIs due to the inhibition of these transporters. In vitro data also showed that naldemedine is 
not a direct inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3 transporters at clinically relevant 
naldemedine concentrations. However, the lack of the assessment of the impact of a pre-incubation step 
in the in vitro study conducted does not allow determining if a time-dependent inhibition with 
naldemedine is present or not, while enhanced inhibition of transporters by pre-incubation have been 
reported in the literature for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1 and OAT3. The Applicant is therefore 
recommended to provide further in vitro data assessing the impact of an adequate pre-incubation step of 
at least 30 minutes for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and 60 minutes for OAT1 and OAT3 on the inhibitory 
potential of naldemedine on OATP1B1, OATP1B3 (first 6 months after authorization), OAT1 and OAT3 
transporters, taking into account the actual naldemedine concentrations present in the in vitro system 
used.  
In Silico 
The entirety of available data from Phase 1 studies was considered and new sensitivity analyses were 
performed. In the CLR range of 1.0 to 2.5 L/hr, AUC ratios of naldemedine following administration of 
naldemedine with efavirenz relative to naldemedine alone were consistent with the values of 0.555 to 
0.580, indicating AUC ratio was not influenced by CLR. However, given the remaining uncertainty in the 
model and given that SIMCYP plateform is currently not considered qualified for to characterize drug 
induction (in the absence of in vivo data), the effect of moderate inducers (e.g. efavirenz,) can therefore 
not be established; therefore, the use of rizmoic acid should cautiously be considered in patients already 
given a moderate inducer (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5).  
In vivo DDI  
In general, the limited applicant´s in vivo DDI program is considered adequate and was performed 
according to the guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions. The program consists of 3 DDI 
studies carried out in healthy subjects designed to assess effects of P-gp inhibition, CYP3A induction and 
inhibition on naldemedine as a substrate. 
Based on the study results, it can be concluded that a clinically meaningful effect on naldemedine 
exposure by itraconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) and rifampin (strong inducer) is observed. The strong 
CYP3A inhibitor Itraconazole increased Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf of naldemedine by 1.12 fold, 2.65 
fold, and 2.91 fold. The geometric LS mean naldemedine Cmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and t1/2,z values 
were approximately 38%, 83%, 83%, and 73% lower, respectively, following Naldemedine:Rifampin 
compared with Naldemedine alone. The geometric LS mean naldemedine CL/F value was approximately 
6-fold following Naldemedine:Rifampin compared with Naldemedine alone, and the 90% CI for the ratio 
of CL/F was completely outside the 0.80 to 1.25 reference interval. Appropriate statements are made in 
the SmPC. 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 62/209 
 
 
 
 
Fluconazole increased Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf of naldemedine by 1.38 fold, 1.88 fold, and 1.90 
fold. Even if it concerns a mild inhibition, caution should be exercised as the number of TEAE increased 
when naldemedine is administered concomitantly with moderate CYP3A inhibitors in the clinical studies.  
If used with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitoring for adverse reactions is needed as advised in 4.4 of 
the SmPC. 
Cyclosporine as Pg-P inhibitor increased the AUC and Cmax of naldemedine after single-dose 
administration by 79% and 45% respectively (< 2-fold). The SmPC correctly stated:  Concomitant use of 
P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine may increase plasma concentrations of naldemedine. If naldemedine 
is used with strong P-gp inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. 
Pharmacodynamics: 
The pharmacodynamics of naldemedine has not been specifically studied in healthy volunteers or in 
patients. Naldemedine is antagonist of the μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors, and has no agonistic activity at 
any of these opioid receptors. The suggested mechanism of action appears plausible based on preclinical 
studies. From in vitro data, the primary metabolite is much less potent and is less likely to contribute to 
a clinically meaningful efficacy or adverse reactions.  
PK-PD associations has been studied using the Bayesian estimates of AUC from the PoP-PK model and 
response rate as well as rates of gastrointestinal AEs in phase II and III trials.  These results suggest weak 
to moderate associations between exposure and clinical response or AE. Use of a model-based approach 
to quantitatively characterize the relationship between drug exposure and clinical efficacy and safety is 
supported. 
An adequately designed, performed and conducted thorough QTC study did not suggest that naldemedine 
prolongs the QTc interval to a clinically meaningful extent. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of naldemedine has been correctly characterised. No major issues have been 
identified. The application is considered approvable from a pharmacological viewpoint. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
There were three dose response studies submitted I this application. The first study, study V9214, was a 
Phase 2, single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose study 
evaluating 6 dose levels (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg) of naldemedine in subjects with chronic 
non-cancer pain. This study indicated that only doses of 0.3 mg and higher had an effect. Furthermore, 
doses of 1 and 3 mg were associated with an increase in adverse events. 
The second study was study V9221. This was a Phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study to evaluate 3 doses (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg) of naldemedine in the treatment of OIC in 
subjects with chronic non-cancer pain. Thus exploring if the dose found to be the minimally effective dose 
in study V9214 (0.3 mg) would be the most optimal. The mean dose of opioid analgesic was 120-146 mg 
across treatment groups.

V9231 and V9232 
The  two  trials  V9231  and  V9232  with  the  title:  “A  randomized,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  study  of  naldemedine  in  the  treatment  of  opioid-induced 
constipation  in  subjects  with  non-malignant  chronic  pain  receiving  opioid  therapy”  were 
identical  in  design  and  are  described  jointly  in  this  section.  The  trials  were  randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational trials comparing 
efficacy  and  safety  of  0.2  mg  QD  naldemedine  versus  placebo.  The  trials  consisted  of  a 
2-4-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period.  
At visit 1 subjects were screened to determine eligibility and any laxative treatment was discontinued. At 
visit 2, 2-4 weeks later, subjects were randomized to treatment with either naldemedine or placebo for 12 
weeks. During the treatment period subjects attended 6 scheduled visits: baseline/randomization, Week 
1,  Week  2,  Week  4,  Week  8,  and  Week  12,  and  completed  the  Bowel  movement  and  constipation

assessment (BMCA) including the Bristol stool scale (BSS) on a daily basis by entering the data into the 
eDiary.  The  patient  assessment  of  constipation  symptom/quality  of 
life  questionnaires 
(PAC-SYM/PAC-QOL)  was  completed  at  all  scheduled  treatment  visits  whereas  Short  Form  36  was 
completed at baseline and end of treatment period, and Subject Global Satisfaction was completed at end 
of treatment period.  
Methods

Severe  constipation  that  has  not  been  appropriately  managed  such  that  the  subject  is  at 
• 
immediate  risk  of  developing  serious  complications  of  constipation.  This  includes  subject  who  have 
reported no bowel movements for 7 consecutive days prior to and during the screening period. 
Laxatives were discontinued at screening.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

Trial drug was to be discontinued for any of the following reasons: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Withdrawal by subject 
On the discretion of the investigator because of safety reasons 
If the subject met the liver discontinuation criteria (abnormal liver chemistry criteria) 
Lost to follow-up 
Pregnancy 
Any protocol deviation that resulted in a significant risk to the subject’s safety 
Unblinding 
Withdrawal from the trial: subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the trial for any reason at any time. For 
withdrawn subjects every effort is made to determine the primary reason for withdrawal and record this 
in the CRF.   
Treatments 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either naldemedine 0.2 mg QD or placebo tables matching 0.2 
mg naldemedine QD orally. Patients were instructed to choose the most appropriate time for daily dosing 
(i.e. the time associated with the highest compliance and convenience relative to occurrence of BMs) and 
to take the drug at approximately the same time each day.   
Opioid treatment: The stable opioid treatment regimen at a TDD on average of at least 30 mg equivalents 
of oral morphine sulphate at screening was to be continued throughout the study. Patients were allowed 
to take additional medication (opioid or non-opioid) for breakthrough pain as prescribed by their 
physician.  
Rescue medication: Rescue laxative therapy according to the Rescue Laxative Guidelines was allowed and 
could be initiated by the subject, if the subject did not have BM for any 72 hours period during screening 
or treatment. Step 1 in the Rescue Laxative Guidelines was stimulant laxative (bisacodyl), and if no BM 
took place within 24 hours, Step 2 was to continue on a higher dose and/or a saline enema. Study drug 
was continued throughout the study despite whether rescue medication was taken or not. Every attempt 
was made to limit laxative use during the 24-hour period immediately prior to randomization as time to 
first SBM was an exploratory endpoint.  A BM occurring within 24 hours after rescue therapy was not 
counted as an SBM.  
Objectives 
Primary objective: To compare the efficacy assessed over 12 weeks based on the responder proportion of 
naldemedine 0.2 mg QD versus placebo in subjects with chronic non-cancer pain OIC not treated with 
laxatives.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 67/209 
 
 
 
 
Secondary objectives: To compare the effect of naldemedine 0.2 mg QD versus placebo on the frequency 
of SBMs, CSBMS, and SBMS without straining in subjects with chronic non-cancer pain OIC not treated 
with laxatives. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of naldemedine.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
A positive-response week was defined as at least 3 SBMS per week and an increase from baseline of at 
least 1 SBM per week for that week. The primary endpoint response was defined as having at least 9 
positive-response weeks out of the 12-week treatment period, and 3 positive-response weeks out of the 
last 4 weeks of the 12-week treatment period.  
Secondary endpoints were: 
1.  Change in the frequency of SBMS per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of the treatment 
period 
2.  Change in the frequency of SBMS per week from baseline to week 1 of the treatment period 
3.  Change in the frequency of CSBM per week from baseline to the last 2 week of the treatment 
period 
4.  Change in the frequency of SBMs without straining per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of 
the treatment period.  
A fixed-sequence testing approach will be applied with the above ordering to adjust for multiplicity.  
Exploratory endpoints were: 
•

•  Changes in total and free testosterone in males 
Sample size 
Assuming 45% and 30% responders in the naldemedine 0.2 mg group respectively the placebo group for 
the ITT population, a total of 540 subjects are needed to be randomized in order to have at least 95% 
power for detecting a more than 15% difference between the two groups for a 2-sided 5% significance 
level using Pearson’s chi-squared test.  
Randomisation 
At visit 2, eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 manner to one of the treatment groups using a 
telephone or web-based randomisation system, IV/WRS. Patients were stratified based on their 
documented opioid use (average TDD during the 14-consecutive-day qualifying period) (30 to at most 
100 mg equivalents of oral morphine sulphate, or more than 100 mg equivalents of oral morphine 
sulphate).   
Blinding (masking) 
The trial was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Placebo tablets were identical to active tablets in 
shape and colour.  
All subjects, study personnel, and data analysts were blinded to the treatment assigned at randomization 
until database lock. The randomization schedule was only accessible to Drug Supply Management staff, 
IVRS/IWRS Clinical coordinators/vendor staff, and unblinded statistician on the Data Safety Monitoring 
Board.  
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint 
A responder was defined as having at least 9 positive-response weeks out of the 12-week treatment 
period, and at least 3 positive-response weeks out of the last 4 weeks of the 12-week treatment period, 
where a positive-response week defined as at least 3 SBMS per week and an increase from baseline of at 
least 1 SBM per week for that week. If a subject has less than 4 days of diary entries related to defecation 
for a week that will week will be considered non-evaluable. For the primary analysis a non-evaluable week 
will be considered a “non-response” week.   
If a subject has insufficient primary endpoint data (i.e. data for less than 9 out of the 12 weeks of the 
treatment period or less than 3 out of the last 4 weeks of the 12-week treatment period) the subject will 
be treated as a “non-responder”.

A BM occurring within 24 hours after rescue therapy was not counted as an SBM. If the time at which a BM 
occurred is missing and there is no rescue laxative therapy on the previous day and the day of the BM, the 
BM will be considered as an SBM. If the time at which a BM occurred is missing and there is rescue laxative 
therapy on the previous day and the day of the BM, the BM will not be considered as an SBM. 
Any number of SBMs rated on the Bristol Stool Scale as 1 within a 2-hour period was counted as a single 
SBM. A BM occurring within 24 hours after rescue therapy was not counted as an SBM.  
The number of SBMs per week in a given week is defined as 7*(total frequency of SBMs in the 
week)/(Number of days of observation related to defecation in the week), i.e. it is the observed average 
scaled to a 7-day observation period.  
Analysis populations: 
ITT: All randomized subjects.  
mITT: All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of trial drug and completed the first 4 
weeks of the study with at least 4 days of diary entry related to defecations per week. Analysed as 
randomised. 
Safety population: All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of trial drug will be analysed by 
treatment actually received. Subjects who took naldemedine at least once will be analysed by the 
naldemedine group.   
PP: All subjects who completed at least 81 days of the treatment period and do not have major protocol 
deviations.  
Statistical analysis of primary endpoint: the proportion of responders will be compared for naldemedine 
versus placebo using the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test adjusted by the stratified opioid dose groups. The 
population will be the ITT population consisting of all randomized subjects.  
Sensitivity analyses:  
The same model (stratified Cochran Mantel Haenszel test) will be used in all sensitivity analyses, but the 
effect of different populations as well as different ways of imputing missing data will be examined as 
follows:  
•  Observed case: non-evaluable weeks are excluded from the analysis. Response is defined among 
the evaluable weeks. A subject who did not have at least 9 evaluable weeks was considered a 
“non-responder”.     
•  Complete case: subjects with less than 4 days of diary entries related to defecation at any week 
are excluded 
•  Worst case: subjects with missing diary entries related to defecation at any day in a week are 
considered non-responders for that week 
•  Modified worst case: for subject with no diary entries related to defecation at any day in a week 
the number of SBMs for that day are set to 0. However if a treatment week is non-evaluable that 
week will be treated as a “non-response” week.

The different sensitivity analyses are summarized in the table below:  
In addition the primary endpoint will also be examined for the following subgroups: 
•  Opioid dose strata 
•  Age 
•  BMI 
•  Gender 
•  Race 
•  Region, country and site 
Only descriptive results of the subgroup analyses will be presented.  
The family-wise type 1 error rate for the confirmatory secondary endpoints was controlled by using the 
pre-specified fixed-sequence testing approach with the order 
1.  Change in the frequency of SBMs per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of the treatment 
period 
2.  Change in the frequency of SBMs per week from baseline to week 1 of the treatment period 
3.  Change in the frequency of CSBM per week from baseline to the last 2 week of the treatment 
period 
4.  Change in the frequency of SBMs without straining per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of 
the treatment period.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 71/209 
 
 
 
 
 
For secondary and exploratory endpoints the same definition of frequency of SBMS per week as for the 
primary analysis is applied, i.e. the frequency of SBMs per week is defined as 7*(total frequency of SBMs 
in the week)/(Number of days of observation related to defecation in the week). And in analogy with this 
the weekly frequency of SBMs for the last two weeks is given by 7*(total frequency of SBMS in the last two 
weeks)/(Number of days of observation related to defecation in the week).  
If a subject has less than 4 days of diary entries related to defecation in a week that week will be 
considered non-evaluable and the missing information will not be imputed.  
Statistical analysis of secondary endpoints: the mean of the change in the relevant endpoint will be 
analysed using analysis of covariate (ANCOVA) with treatment and opioid group strata as factors. The 
population will be the ITT population consisting of all randomized subjects. 
Statistical analysis of exploratory endpoints: 
Analysis of responder endpoints will be done similarly to the primary analysis. Analysis of changes in 
frequencies per week will be done using MMRM including opioid group strata, treatment group, time, and 
time-by-treatment group interaction as fixed factors. An unstructured covariance matrix within subjects 
will be assumed. The population will be the ITT population consisting of all randomized subjects. 
Results 
Participant flow 
V9231: 
A total of 974 subjects were screened. Out of these 427 (44%) failed screening mainly due to eDiary 
eligibility and Other, resulting in a total of 547 subjects randomised, 274 to naldemedine and 273 to 
placebo with respectively 233 (85.0%) and 238 (87.2%) completing the study. Subject withdrawal was 
the main reason for discontinuation followed by adverse events, which was more common for subjects on 
naldemedine (5.1% compared to 1.8%). In the naldemedine group 8 subjects withdrew due to AEs in the 
gastrointestinal disorders SOC, compared to 3 subjects in the placebo group. Apart from this reasons for 
withdrawal seemed balanced and completion rates comparable and reasonably high.

V9232: 
A total of 985 subjects were screened. Out of these 432 (44%) failed screening mainly due to eDiary 
eligibility and Other, resulting in a total of 553 subjects randomised, 277 to naldemedine and 276 to 
placebo with respectively 237 (85.6%) and 232 (84.1%) completing the study. Subject withdrawal was 
the main reason for discontinuation followed by adverse events, which was more common for subjects on 
naldemedine (5.8% compared to 4.0%). In the naldemedine group 10 subjects withdrew due to AEs in 
the gastrointestinal disorders SOC, compared to 4 subjects in the placebo group. Apart from this reasons 
for withdrawal seemed balanced and completion rates comparable and reasonably high.

Conduct of the study 
V9231: 
The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice.  
There were 3 amendments to the protocol. The original protocol dated 19 June 2013 was amended on 04 
October 2013 (Amendment 1), 11 June 2014 (Amendment 2), and 16 October 2014 (Amendment 3). The 
key changes in amendment 1 were added clarification of BMCA inclusion criteria, added text to clarify 
eligibility criteria based on SBMs, changed text to clarify the steps taken for rescue laxative therapy, and 
added text to allow for Investigator discretion on medication that may have had a significant impact on 
the GI system or bowel habits. Key changes in amendment 2 were clarification of allowed laxatives during 
the follow-up period, redefined allowable use of tramadol and tapentadol for clarity, and revised time 
points for primary efficacy endpoints. Key changes in amendment 3 were revision of secondary endpoints 
to provide a more thorough clinical efficacy summary of naldemedine including effects from baseline to 
endpoint, baseline to the first week, straining, and CSBMs, addition of an exploratory endpoint to further 
assess the effect on SBMs without straining over time, removal of PK assessment as an exploratory 
endpoint, change of the definition of the mITT Population to produce a population that more accurately 
accounted for challenges encountered by subjects required to use an electronic data capture tool, 
modification of the Safety Population to be more inclusive in order to obtain a larger population, and 
clarification of the definition of insufficient primary endpoint data and a “non-response” week. 
V9232: 
The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice. 
There we 2 amendments to the protocol. The original protocol dated 04 October 2013 was amended on 11 
June 2014 (Amendment 1) and 16 October 2014 (Amendment 2). The key changes in amendment 1 were 
added clarification of discontinuing regular use of laxatives at start of screening and through the 12-week 
treatment period, clarification of stratification based on morphine-equivalent dosing as well as redefined 
allowable use of tramadol and tapentadol, clarification of exclusion criteria related to severe constipation 
prior to and during the screening period, and clarification of primary efficacy endpoint related to last 
observation carried forward. The key changes in amendment 2 were the same as the key changes in 
amendment 3 in V9231.  
Baseline data 
V9231: 
The demographic characteristics of the ITT population were generally well balanced across treatment 
groups. The mean age was 53.4 years with 74.9% of subjects being between 40 and 65 years, and 15.8% 
65 years or above. The majority of patients were female (60.5%) and predominantly White (80.1%) 
followed by Black/African American subjects (18.5%). The subjects were mainly from North America 
(84.2%). The study population had a mean weight of 89.91 kg, and the majority of subjects 
(approximately 80%) were overweight or obese (BMI above 25 kg/m2).  
At baseline, the mean daily dose of the opioid analgesic was 125.21 mg morphine-equivalent for the 
naldemedine group and 139.66 mg morphine-equivalent for the placebo group. The observed difference 
between groups in the mean opioid dose was driven by a few outliers in the placebo group receiving an 
opioid morphine-equivalent dose >400 mg. When the mean daily dose at baseline was calculated for 
subjects taking up to 400 mg, no difference between groups was observed. The mean SBMs per week was 
1.31 with a median of 1.50. The majority of subjects (56.5%) were in the low opioid dose strata.  
Rizmoic Assessment report

All subjects in the ITT population had constipation and a non-malignant chronic pain condition requiring 
treatment with opioids. The most commonly reported chronic pain conditions were back pain (62.0%), 
pain (5.3%), arthralgia (5.1%), neck pain (8.3%), and osteoarthritis (5.3%). The most common reported 
medical history condition were back pain (66.7%), hypertension (48.6%), and depression (39.6%).  
V9232: 
The demographic characteristics of the ITT population were generally well balanced across treatment 
groups. The mean age was 53.5 years with 73.8% of subjects being between 40 and 65 years, and 14.9% 
65 years or above. The majority of patients were female (60.5%) and predominantly White (81.6%) 
followed by Black/African American subjects (16.0%). The subjects were mainly from North America 
(87.3%). The study population had a mean weight of 89.15 kg, and the majority of subjects 
(approximately 80%) were overweight or obese (BMI above 25 kg/m2).  
At baseline, the mean daily dose of the opioid analgesic was 117.95 mg morphine-equivalent for the 
naldemedine group and 123.92 mg morphine-equivalent for the placebo group. The mean SBMs per week 
was 1.17 with a median of 1.08. The majority of subjects (61.1%) were in the low opioid dose strata.  
All subjects in the ITT population has constipation and a non-malignant chronic pain condition requiring 
treatment with opioids. The most commonly reported chronic pain conditions were back pain (53.6%), 
pain (10.2%), arthralgia (7.8%), neck pain (7.5%), and osteoarthritis (6.9%). The most common 
reported medical history condition were back pain (63.8%), hypertension (48.5%), and depression 
(44.7%). 
Numbers analysed 
V9231: 
A total of 547 subjects were randomised, 274 to naldemedine and 273 to placebo. One subject in each 
treatment group was excluded from all populations due to double enrolment at different sites. All other 
subjects were included in the ITT population. For the Safety Population two additional subjects in the 
naldemedine group was excluded as they never received trial drug. Several subjects were excluded from 
the mITT and the PP population, the reasons are given in the flowchart below.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary analysis 
V9231: 
The study met its primary endpoint by showing that treatment with naldemedine resulted in a 
significantly larger proportion responders than treatment with placebo (p=0.0020). The difference in 
proportion of responders was 13.0%.

V9232: 
The study met its primary endpoint by showing that treatment with naldemedine resulted in a 
significantly larger proportion responders than treatment with placebo (p=<0.0001). The difference in 
proportion of responders was 18.9%.

analysis) to 17.2% (mITT sensitivity analysis). All sensitivity analyses confirm that a higher proportion of 
subjects respond for naldemedine compared to placebo. But there is almost a 2-fold difference between 
the lowest and the highest estimated treatment difference. Thus the results of the primary analysis does 
not seem to be very robust.

All sensitivity analyses showed a statistically significant greater proportion of responders with 
naldemedine compared to placebo. The treatment difference ranged from 13.9% (Worst case sensitivity 
analysis) to 20.7% (complete case sensitivity analysis). All sensitivity analyses confirm that a higher 
proportion of subjects respond for naldemedine compared to placebo and are well in line apart from the 
worst case scenario which is an outliner as could be expected. Thus the results of the primary analysis 
seem to be robust.  
Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint   
The primary endpoint was investigated in the subgroups opioid dose strata, age, BMI, gender, race, 
region, country and site.  
V9231: 
For all subgroups apart from age, the proportion of responders was higher for naldemedine than placebo 
in consistence with the result of the primary analysis. The results for age were presented for the four 
groups below 40, 40 to 65, above 65, and above 75 years:   
In all groups apart from below 40 years, the proportion is higher for naldemedine than placebo. There 
seems to be a tendency that response decreases with age. This is especially true for the placebo group, 
but for the naldemedine group the response proportion is lower in the age less than 40 years group than 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 82/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expected, and also lower than the response proportion in the placebo group. The Applicant points out that 
8 of the 25 subjects in the naldemedine group discontinued before week 11, hence were classified as 
non-responders, whereas this only was the case for 3 out of 26 subjects in the placebo group. Also 
considering that the placebo response proportion was unusually high in the below 40 years group, the 
applicant considers this a chance finding.   
V9232: 
For most subgroups the proportion of responders was higher for naldemedine than placebo in consistence 
with the result of the primary analysis. The exceptions were subjects 75 years or above, subjects with 
BMI<18.5, and subjects of Black/African American race. There were only few subjects in the subgroups 
age 75 years or above, and BMI<18.5 not allowing for adequate comparison between groups. For the 
subgroup of Black/African Americans 7 out of 49 subjects in the naldemedine and 4 out of 39 subjects in 
the placebo group discontinued prior to *Week 11, and hence were non-responders. Also the responder 
proportion in the placebo group was among the highest observed, whereas the responder proportion in 
the naldemedine group was among the lowest observed. Thus the applicant considers this a chance 
finding.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary endpoints were defined in the below fixed-sequence order: 
1.  Change in the frequency of SBMs per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of the treatment 
period 
2.  Change in the frequency of SBMs per week from baseline to week 1 of the treatment period 
3.  Change in the frequency of CSBM per week from baseline to the last 2 week of the treatment 
period 
4.  Change in the frequency of SBMs without straining per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of 
the treatment period.  
V9231:  
The results were: 
1.  A greater change in the frequency of SBMs per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of 
treatment for naldemedine than placebo, treatment difference of 1.30 SBMs per week 
(p<0.0001).  
2.  A greater change in the frequency of SBMs per week from baseline to the Week 1 for naldemedine 
than placebo, treatment difference of 2.11 SBMs per week (p<0.0001).  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 83/209 
 
 
 
 
 
  
3.  A greater change in the frequency of CSBMs per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of 
treatment for naldemedine than placebo, treatment difference of 1.01 CSBMs per week 
(p<0.0001).  
4.  A greater change in the frequency of SBMs without straining per week from baseline to the last 2 
weeks of treatment for naldemedine than placebo, treatment difference of 0.73 SBMs per week 
(p=0.0003).  
Note that all hypotheses were rejected, hence the fixed-sequence order testing continued throughout the 
entire sequence. The detailed results are seen below:

V9232: 
The results were: 
1.  A greater change in the frequency of SBMs per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of 
treatment for naldemedine than placebo, treatment difference of 1.40 SBMs per week 
(p<0.0001).  
2.  A greater change in the frequency of SBMs per week from baseline to the Week 1 for naldemedine 
than placebo, treatment difference of 2.17 SBMs per week (p<0.0001).  
3.  A greater change in the frequency of CSBMs per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of 
treatment for naldemedine than placebo, treatment difference of 1.15 CSBMs per week 
(p<0.0001).  
4.  A greater change in the frequency of SBMs without straining per week from baseline to the last 2 
weeks of treatment for naldemedine than placebo, treatment difference of 0.75 SBMs per week 
(p=0.0011).  
Note that all hypotheses were rejected, hence the fixed-sequence order testing continued throughout the 
entire sequence. The detailed results are seen below:

Exploratory efficacy evaluation 
Note that the below analyses were not multiplicity adjusted, hence statistically significance 
only refers to nominal p-values. 
V9231: 
• 
For CSBM a responder was defined similar to a responder for SBM. The proportion of responders 
was 24.9% for naldemedine and 14.3% for placebo with a statistically significant difference 
between groups.   
•  When a responder was defined as a subject with at least 6 positive-response weeks out of the 
12-week treatment period (with the usual definition of response-week), the proportion of 
responders was 63.4% for naldemedine and 55.1% for placebo with a statistically non-significant 
difference between groups. 
•  When a responder was defined as a subject with at least 9 positive-response weeks out of the 
12-week treatment period (with the usual definition of response-week), the proportion of 
responders was 52.0% for naldemedine and 35.71% for placebo with a statistically significant 
difference between groups. 
•  When a responder was defined as a subject with at least 3 positive-response weeks out of the 4 
weeks in a month (with the usual definition of response-week), the proportion of monthly 
responders for naldemedine and placebo were 58.1% and 40.7% for Month 1, 63.3% and 46.5% 
for Month 2, and 60.3% and 53.1% for Month 3. The difference between groups was statistically 
significant for the first two months, but not for the last month.  
•  Changes over time in the frequency of SBMS per week from baseline increased at Week 1 more 
for naldemedine than for placebo, and this difference between groups first declined slightly and 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 86/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
then remained stable throughout Week 12 with a statistically significant difference between 
groups at all time points. See the plot below. 
•  Changes in the 6 other parameters: frequency of SBMs rated as 3 or 4 on the BSS per week, 
frequency of CSBMs per week, frequency of SBMs without straining per week, frequency of SBMs 
without blockage per week, number of days with at least 1 SBM per week, and number of days 
with at least 1 CSBM per week showed the same pattern as the results for change from baseline 
over time in the frequency of SBMs per week.  
•  Median time to first SBM was 16.07 hours for the naldemedine group and 46.73 hours for the 
placebo group, the difference being statistically significant. See the plot below.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

•  Median time to first CSBM was 48.95 hours for the naldemedine group and 128.92 hours for the 
placebo, the difference being statistically significant. 
• 
The proportion of subjects with SBM or CSBM within the first 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after initial 
dose of trial dug were higher for subjects on naldemedine compared to placebo.  
•  Change in maximal number of days between SBMs from baseline for each 2-week of the 
treatment period appeared higher for naldemedine than placebo for the first 2-weeks periods, but 
the difference decreased over time.

• 
There was no difference in the change in the frequency of rescue laxative use per week from 
baseline to each week between the treatments, although at each week naldemedine was 
numerically higher. The same pattern was found for change in the number of days of rescue 
laxative use per week from baseline to each week.

•  Abdominal bloating score and abdominal discomfort score decrease from baseline over the 
treatment period for both groups with generally similar reductions.  
•  Changes in the overall score for PAC-SYM from baseline to each visit were statistically 
significantly greater for naldemedine than placebo. Treatment effects of -0.29, -0.33, and -0.30 
respectively.  
o  The results for each domain of the PAC-SYM were generally similar to the overall score.  
•  Changes in the overall score for PAC-QOL from baseline to each visit were statistically 
significantly greater for naldemedine than placebo. Treatment effects of -0.30, -0.33, and -0.26 
respectively.  
o  The results for each domain of the PAC-QOL were generally similar to the overall score.  
•  Change overall and in each domain scores for SF-36 from baseline to Week 12/early termination 
were generally small and similar between groups. 
• 
• 
For the subjects who completed a Subject Global Satisfaction questionnaire, the degree of 
satisfaction of constipation and abdominal symptoms was more improved for naldemedine than 
for placebo.   
The changes in total and free testosterone in males from baseline to Week 12/early termination 
were small and appeared similar between groups (no statistical test performed).

V9232: 
• 
For CSBM a responder was defined similar to a responder for SBM. The proportion of responders 
was 31.2% for naldemedine and 17.9% for placebo with a statistically significant difference 
between groups.   
•  When a responder was defined as a subject with at least 6 positive-response weeks out of the 
12-week treatment period (with the usual definition of response-week), the proportion of 
responders was 68.8% for naldemedine and 47.1% for placebo with a statistically significant 
difference between groups. 
•  When a responder was defined as a subject with at least 9 positive-response weeks out of the 
12-week treatment period (with the usual definition of response-week), the proportion of 
responders was 56.5% for naldemedine and 36.5% for placebo with a statistically significant 
difference between groups. 
•  When a responder was defined as a subject with at least 3 positive-response weeks out of the 4 
weeks in a month (with the usual definition of response-week), the proportion of monthly 
responders for naldemedine and placebo were 64.0% and 40.2% for Month 1, 68.5% and 48.2% 
for Month 2, and 65.4% and 47.3% for Month 3. The difference between groups was statistically 
significant for all months.  
•  Changes over time in the frequency of SBMS per week from baseline increased at Week 1 more 
for naldemedine than for placebo, and this difference between groups first declined slightly and 
then remained stable throughout Week 12 with a statistically significant difference between 
groups at all time points. See the plot below. 
•  Changes in the 6 other parameters: frequency of SBMs rated as 3 or 4 on the BSS per week, 
frequency of CSBMs per week, frequency of SBMs without straining per week, frequency of SBMs 
without blockage per week, number of days with at least 1 SBM per week, and number of days 
with at least 1 CSBM per week showed the same pattern as the results for change from baseline 
over time in the frequency of SBMs per week.

•  Median time to first SBM was 18.33 hours for the naldemedine group and 45.92 hours for the 
placebo group, the difference being statistically significant. See the plot below.  
•  Median time to first CSBM was 49.47 hours for the naldemedine group and 136.78 hours for the 
placebo group, the difference being statistically significant. 
• 
The proportion of subjects with SBM or CSBM within the first 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after initial 
dose of trial dug were higher for subjects on naldemedine compared to placebo.  
•  Change in maximal number of days between SBMs from baseline for each 2-week of the 
treatment period appeared higher for naldemedine than placebo for the first 2-weeks period, with 
the difference being rather stable over time but maybe with a slight tendency to decrease.

• 
There was generally no difference in the change in the frequency of rescue laxative use per week 
from baseline to each week between the treatments, although at each week naldemedine was 
numerically higher. The same pattern was found for change in the number of days of rescue 
laxative use per week from baseline to each week.  
•  Abdominal bloating score and abdominal discomfort score decrease from baseline over the 
treatment period for both groups with statistically higher reductions for the naldemedine group.   
•  Changes in the overall score for PAC-SYM from baseline to each visit were statistically 
significantly greater for naldemedine than placebo. Treatment effects of -0.29, -0.33, and -0.32 
respectively.

o  The results for each domain of the PAC-SYM were generally similar to the overall score.  
•  Changes in the overall score for PAC-QOL from baseline to each visit were statistically 
significantly greater for naldemedine than placebo. Treatment effects of -0.29, -0.34, and -0.28 
respectively.  
o  The results for each domain of the PAC-QOL were generally similar to the overall score.  
•  Change overall and in each domain scores for SF-36 from baseline to Week 12/early termination 
were generally small and similar between groups. 
• 
• 
For the subjects who completed a Subject Global Satisfaction questionnaire, the degree of 
satisfaction of constipation and abdominal symptoms was more improved for naldemedine than 
for placebo.   
The changes in total and free testosterone in males from baseline to Week 12/early termination 
were small and appeared similar between groups (no statistical test performed).

Trial V9235 
Trial V9235 is entitled “A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
multicentre, phase 3 study to evaluate the long-term safety of naldemedine for the treatment 
of opioid-induced constipation in subjects with non-malignant chronic pain receiving opioid 
therapy”.  
The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational 
trial comparing safety of naldemedine 0.2 mg QD versus placebo. The trial consisted of a 14-28-day 
screening period, a 52-week treatment period, and a 2-week follow-up period.  
At visit 1 subjects were screened to determine eligibility. Subjects provided the investigator with details 
of their laxative regimen for the previous 28 days. This regimen was used throughout the screening 
period. At visit 2, up to 28 days later, subjects were randomized to treatment with either naldemedine or 
placebo for 12 weeks.  
During the treatment period subjects attended 12 scheduled visits: baseline/randomization, Week 1, 
Week 2, Week 6, Week 12, Week 18, Week 24, Week 30, Week 26, Week 42, Week 48, and Week 52,   
and completed the Bowel Habits paper diary for the weeks prior to Week 12, Week, 24, and Week 52. The 
PAC-SYM/PAC-QOL was completed at selected scheduled treatment visits whereas Subject Global 
Satisfaction was completed at end of treatment period.  
Methods 
Study Participants  
The trial was conducted in patients with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC and investigated the effect of 
naldemedine relative to placebo. Subjects on a stable laxative regimen at screening should continue on 
that regimen throughout the study.  
The main inclusion criteria were 
•  18-80 years of age, inclusive  
•  Diagnosis of chronic non-cancer pain and OIC 
•  Receiving chronic opioid therapy for at least 3 months 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 100/209 
 
 
 
 
 
o  Opioid regimen stable at a TDD on average of at least 30 mg equivalents of oral morphine 
sulphate for at least 1 months prior to screening (tramadol and tapentadol not included in 
calculations, with no anticipated changes in the overall opioid regimen) 
• 
 Patients must have met the following 3 criteria over a 14-consecutive-day qualifying period 
during the screening period: 
o  No more than 4 SBMs during the 14-consecutive-day qualifying period, and no more than 
3 SBMS in a given week of the qualifying period 
o  Recordance of at least 4 days of bowel movement data for each 7 day period that 
constitutes one week in the eDiary.  
•  Subjects may or may not have been on a routine laxative regimen at screening. Subjects on a 
laxative regimen must have been taking laxatives at least once weekly. 
Trial drug was to be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
•  Withdrawal by subject 
•  On the discretion of the investigator because of safety reasons 
• 
• 
• 
If the subject met the liver discontinuation criteria (abnormal liver chemistry criteria) 
Lost to follow-up 
Pregnancy 
•  Any protocol deviation that resulted in a significant risk to the subject’s safety 
•  Unblinding 
Withdrawal from the trial: subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the trial for any reason at any time. For 
withdrawn subjects every effort is made to complete the end-of-study assessments. All subjects who 
withdrew or discontinued were to be followed until resolution of any adverse events or until the 
unresolved adverse events were judged by the investigator to have stabilised.  
Treatments 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either naldemedine 0.2 mg QD or placebo tables matching 0.2 
mg naldemedine QD orally. Patients were instructed to choose the most appropriate time for daily dosing 
(i.e. the time associated with the highest compliance and convenience relative to occurrence of BMs) and 
to take the drug at approximately the same time each day.   
Opioid treatment: The stable opioid treatment regimen at a TDD on average of at least 30 mg equivalents 
of oral morphine sulphate at screening was to be continued throughout the study. Patients were allowed 
to take additional medication (opioid or non-opioid) for breakthrough pain as prescribed by their 
physician.  
Rescue medication: If a subject did not have BM for any 72 hours period during screening or treatment a 
rescue laxative different from the subjects’ regular regimen was allowed and had to be documented in the 
eDiary. Study drug was continued throughout the study despite whether rescue medication was taken or 
not. A BM occurring within 24 hours after rescue therapy was not counted as an SBM.

Objectives 
Primary objective: To assess the overall safety and tolerability during 52 weeks of treatment with 
naldemedine 0.2 mg QD in subjects with chronic non-cancer pain OIC.   
Secondary objectives: To assess the effect of naldemedine 0.2 mg QD on quality of life measures, global 
satisfaction, opiate withdrawal, pain intensity, OID symptoms and laxative use.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective was overall assessment of safety, hence assessments of summary measures of 
treatment emergent adverse events was the primary endpoint.  
Additional safety endpoints were: 
• 
Incidence of TEAEs 
•  SAES 
•  AEs leading to discontinuation 
MACE, COWS/SOWS, the 11-point NRS for pain intensity, and the standard safety evaluations.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  Change in the frequency of BMs from baseline to selected time points (Week 12, 24, 36, and 52) 
of the treatment period 
•  Number of subjects with laxative use 
•  Change in the PAC-SYM/PAC-QOL overall score from baseline to each visit 
• 
Frequency of Subject Global Satisfaction by treatment group 
Exploratory endpoint: 
•  Change in total and free testosterone in males 
Note that no formal statistical test was defined for the primary endpoint and that no multiplicity 
adjustment was performed for the secondary endpoints.  
Sample size 
Approximately 1200 subjects were to be randomized 1:1 to the naldemedine 0.2 mg group respectively 
the placebo group in order to meet or exceed the requirements of the ICH E1 Guideline: The extent of 
population exposure to assess clinical safety for drugs intended for long-term treatment of 
non-life-threatening conditions, i.e. 6 months of exposure for 300-600 subjects as well as 1 year of 
exposure for 100 subjects.  
Randomisation 
At visit 2, eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 manner to one of the treatment groups using a 
telephone or web-based randomisation system, IXRS. Patients were stratified based on their documented 
opioid use (average TDD during the 14-consecutive-day qualifying period) (30 to at most 100mg 
equivalents of oral morphine sulphate, or more than 100 mg equivalents of oral morphine sulphate).   
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

Blinding (masking) 
The trial was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Placebo tablets were identical to active tablets in 
shape and colour.  
All subjects, study personnel, and data analysts were blinded to the treatment assigned at randomization 
until database lock. The randomization schedule was only accessible to Drug Supply Management staff, 
IXRS Clinical coordinators/vendor staff, and unblinded statistician on the Data Safety Monitoring Board.  
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint: Assessments of summary measures of treatment emergent adverse events.  
Analysis populations: 
ITT: All randomized subjects. Analysed as randomised.  
Safety population: All randomised subjects who received at least one dose of trial drug will be analysed by 
treatment actually received. Subjects who took naldemedine at least once will be analysed by the 
naldemedine group.   
Statistical analysis of primary endpoint: Summary measures of treatment emergent adverse events were 
assessed for the safety population.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
The frequency of BMs per week for each selected visit was defined as 7*(total frequency of BMs for each 
selected visit)/(Number of days of observation related to defecation for each selected visit), i.e. it is the 
observed average scaled to a 7-day observation period.  
The change in the frequency of BMs per week from baseline to each selected visit was defined as 
(Frequency of BMs per week for selected visit)-(Frequency of BMs per week in baseline period). 
The mean (overall) scores for the PAC-SYM/PAC-QOL for each visit were defined as (Total score of the 
PAC-SYM/PAC-QOL for each visit)/(Number of items entered for each visit) and the domain scores were 
defined similarly.   
Statistical analysis of secondary endpoints:  
•  Analysis of changes in frequency of BMs from baseline to selected time points of the treatment 
period as well as analysis of changes in the mean (overall or domain) scores for 
PAC-SYM/PAC-QOL will be done using MMRM including opioid group strata, treatment group, 
time, and time-by-treatment group interaction as fixed factors. An unstructured covariance 
matrix within subjects will be assumed. 
• 
• 
Frequencies of Subject Global Satisfaction were summarized by treatment and compared 
between groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
The proportion of subjects meeting 3 different criteria for laxative use will be summarised by 
treatment group. 
The population will be the ITT population consisting of all randomized subjects for all efficacy analyses. 
Statistical analysis of exploratory endpoints: 
Summary statistics for total and free testosterone in males will be calculated by treatment group.  
Subgroup analyses:

In addition the secondary efficacy endpoints change in frequency of BMs per week, and change in overall 
and domain scores of PAC-SYM/PQC-QOL were analysed for the following subgroups: 
•  Subjects not on a stable laxative regimen defined as subject who did not have a laxative 
from the 28 days prior to the screening period to the final dose of study drug or who received only 
rescue laxative (any laxatives that subjects started to take during the treatment period) (criteria 
1).  
•  Subjects on a stable laxative regimen defined as subjects who have at least one stable 
laxative use reported from 28 days prior to screening to the final dose of study drug (criteria 2).

A total of 2414 subjects were screened. Out of these 1168 (48%) failed screening mainly due to eDiary 
eligibility and Other, resulting in a total of 1246 subjects randomised, 623 to naldemedine and 623 to 
placebo. At this point in time 194 (31.1%) and 191 (30.7%) have completed the treatment period with 
245 (39.3%) and 251 (40.3%) still continuing the treatment period for naldemedine and placebo, i.e. 
similar proportions in the two groups. Subject withdrawal was the main reason for discontinuation 
followed by adverse events. Subject withdrawal appeared slightly more common for subjects on placebo 
(10.3% compared to 8.8%) while adverse events appeared slightly more common for subjects on 
naldemedine (6.3% compared to 4.7%). In the naldemedine group 23 (3.7%) subjects withdrew due to 
AEs in the gastrointestinal disorders SOC, compared to 7 (1.1%) subjects in the placebo group. Apart 
from this reasons for withdrawal seemed balanced and completion rates so far comparable.

Recruitment 
The trial was a multicentre trial with 195 trial sites in 14 countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, 
Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and the US). 
The first subject was enrolled in September 2013 and the data cut-off date was 24 June 2015.     
Conduct of the study 
The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice.  
There were 3 amendments to the protocol. The original protocol dated 09 July 2013 was amended on 07 
October 2013 (Amendment 1), 16 June 2014 (Amendment 2), and 26 February 2015 (Amendment 3). 
The key changes in amendment 1 were addition of pregnancy test at Visit 2, added directions for 
collecting data for laxative use, recording of opioid pain medications, that opioid therapy should be 
captured on the CRF throughout the study, added list of prohibited medications during the study. Key 
changes in amendment 2 were the extra inclusion criteria “No more than 4 SBMs during the 
14-consecutive-day qualifying period, and no more than 3 SBMS in a given week of the qualifying period”, 
added text to specify that subjects might use laxatives during the screening period, added text to specify

that tramadol and tapentadol would not be used in the calculations for the stable opioid treatment 
regimen, and were only allowed in conjunction with other opioid agonists, and added change in frequency 
of BMs from baseline to select time point as an efficacy endpoint. Key changes in amendment 3 was 
change in the wording of the primary objective, change of the sample size per agreement with the US FDA 
and per alignment with ICH Guidance E1, added text about Core Period Data Set and Supplemental Period 
data set, changes to the formulation of blinding and unblinding, change of the primary endpoint from 
MACE to the incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation, early termination was changed 
to specify that subjects who terminated early should also have a follow-up period visit 2 weeks after their 
last dose of study drug, addition of adverse events of special interest.  Rizmoic was chosen for a routine 
GCP inspection. At the inspection, critical GCP violations were recorded for study V9235 necessitating 
exclusion of data from these sites. The overall results were not significantly affected by the exclusion of 
data. In addition, it was noted that patients did not have the possibility to correct the electronic diary 
regarding the number of spontaneous bowl movements. This was considered a critical GCP finding. The 
applicant was therefore requested to complete and submit a re-analysis of efficacy data (of studies 
V9231, V9232 and V9235) including primary as well as secondary efficacy endpoint following correction 
of data based on the available source documentation at participating sites (including un-submitted and 
un-generated DCFs).  
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics of the safety population were generally well balanced across treatment 
groups. The mean age was 53 years with 74.2% of subjects being between 40 and 65 years, and 14.3% 
above 65 years. The majority of patients were female (63.3%) and predominantly White (79.7%) 
followed by Black/African American subjects (18.4%). The subjects were mainly from North America 
(86.5%). The study population had a mean weight of 90.45 kg, and the majority of subjects (83.7%) 
were overweight or obese (BMI above 25 kg/m2). At baseline, the mean total daily dose of the opioid 
analgesic was 123.0 mg morphine-equivalent for the naldemedine group and 121.1 mg 
morphine-equivalent for the placebo group. A total of 21 subjects equally split between groups were 
randomised although their average TDD was less than stated in the inclusion criteria. The majority of 
subjects (63.5%) were in the low opioid dose strata. The mean SBMs per week was 1.60 with a median 
of 1.59.  
Note that 12 subjects had more than 3 SBMS per week at baseline as this was calculated as (total number 
of SBMS/number of observation days) for the 14-consecutive-day qualifying period. For 10 subjects this 
was because that during the 14-day period they had a total of 4 SBMs and entered SBM data for 8 or 9 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 106/209 
 
 
 
 
 
days, but still satisfied the inclusion criteria. The last 2 subjects, one in each group, had more than 4 
SBMS during the 14-day-qualifying period and were randomised in error.  
All subjects in the ITT population had a non-malignant chronic pain condition requiring treatment with 
opioids, and all subjects also had constipation, apart from one subject in the naldemedine group. This 
subject did not have constipation reported in medical history, but did meet the bowel movement entry 
criteria. The most commonly reported chronic pain conditions were back pain (58.6%), pain (6.7%), 
arthralgia (7.1%), neck pain (8.1%), osteoarthritis (9.5%), and fibromyalgia (5.3%). The most common 
reported medical history condition were back pain (66.0%), hypertension (49.0%), depression (41.5%), 
anxiety (34.7%), gastrooesophageal reflux disease (33.3%), osteoarthritis (9.5%), and insomnia 
(33.4%).  
Numbers analysed 
A total of 1246 subjects were randomised, 723 to each group. A total of 5 subjects were excluded from all 
populations as each was simultaneously enrolled at 2 different study sites. All other subjects were 
included in the ITT population. For the Safety Population one additional subject in the naldemedine group 
was excluded as study drug was never administered.  
Note that one subject was randomized to placebo but received one or more tablets of naldemedine by 
error and therefore is counted in the naldemedine safety population. Thus the safety populations 
consisted of 621 subjects in the naldemedine group, and 619 in the placebo group.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary analysis: 
See the safety section.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
•  A greater change in the frequency of BMs per week from Baseline to Week 12 was found for 
naldemedine compared to placebo, treatment difference of 1.26 BMs per week (p<0.0001). This 
difference was sustained through Week 52, and significant at all time points.  
•  Subjects in the naldemedine group had a greater improvement from baseline in the mean overall 
PAC-SYM score over time than subjects in the placebo group with treatment effects varying from 
-0.24 to -0.35. The results were generally similar for each of the domain scores.  
Rizmoic Assessment report

•  Subjects in the naldemedine group had a greater improvement from baseline in the mean overall 
PAC-SYM score over time than subjects in the placebo group with treatment effects varying from 
-0.29 to -0.40. The results were generally similar for each of the domain scores.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

•  Subjects not on a stable laxative regimen were defined as subject who did not have a 
laxative from the 28 days prior to the screening period to the final dose of study drug or who 
received only rescue laxative (any laxatives that subjects started to take during the treatment 
period) (criteria 1), whereas Subjects on a stable laxative regimen were defined as subjects 
who have at least one stable laxative use reported from 28 days prior to screening to the final 
dose of study drug (criteria 2).  
About half of the subjects were on stable laxatives, 50.6% in the naldemedine group, and 54.2% in the 
placebo group. Out of these 7.3% respectively 12.2% received rescue laxatives. The proportion not on 
stable laxatives were about 30% in both groups, with respectively 6.5% and 12.0% receiving rescue 
laxatives. Close to 20% of subjects could not be classified as either on stable laxatives or not and are 
therefore not part of the subgroup analysis.

•  Of the subjects who had completed the subject global satisfaction evaluation at end of study or 
early termination, 80.4% of subjects in the naldemedine group were moderately or more satisfied 
compared to 57.0% in the placebo group. The difference between groups were statistically 
significant.  
Exploratory efficacy evaluation: 
The changes in total and free testosterone in males from baseline over time were small and similar 
between groups. 
Subgroup analysis: 
In addition the secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed for the subgroup subjects on or not on a 
stable laxative regimen. Note that the subgroup subjects on a stable laxative regimen is more than 50% 
larger than the subgroup of subjects not on a stable laxative regimen giving it a higher power for 
statistical comparisons. Also note that due to the nature of the data-cut, the number of subjects available 
for analysis after Week 24 diminishes with time.  
Change in frequency of BMs: 
• 
For subjects on a stable laxative regimen, a greater change in the frequency of BMs per week 
from Baseline to Week 12 was found for naldemedine compared to placebo, treatment difference 
of 1.20 BMs per week (p=0.0002). This difference was sustained through Week 52, and 
significant at all time points.  
Rizmoic Assessment report

• 
For subject not on a stable laxative regimen, there was a greater change in the frequency of BMs 
per week from Baseline to Week 12 for naldemedine compared to placebo, treatment difference 
of 1.47 BMs per week (p=0.0006). But at subsequent visits there was no difference. The placebo 
response in this group was larger than the placebo response for subjects on a stable laxative 
regimen.

Change in PAC-SYM scores: 
For subjects on a stable laxative regimen: 
•  Subjects in the naldemedine group had a greater improvement from baseline in the 
mean overall PAC-SYM score over time than subjects in the placebo group with 
treatment effects varying from -0.15 to -0.36. The difference was significant at all time 
points apart from the last.  
• 
• 
For the stool-symptoms domain a statistically significant greater improvement in the 
naldemedine group was seen at all time points.  
For the abdominal-symptoms and rectal-symptoms domains a numerically greater 
improvement was seen in the naldemedine group at all time points, however only 
statistically significant at some time points.   
For subjects not on a stable laxative regimen:  
•  Subjects in the naldemedine group had a greater improvement from baseline in the 
mean overall PAC-SYM score over time than subjects in the placebo group with 
treatment effects varying from -0.24 to -0.45. The difference was significant at all time

Trial V9236 
Trial V9236 is entitled “A phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group study of naldemedine in cancer patients with opioid-induced constipation”.

The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre trial comparing 
efficacy and safety of 0.2 mg QD naldemedine versus placebo. The trial consisted of a 14-28-day 
screening period, a 14 days treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up period.  
At visit 1 subjects were screened to determine eligibility. Subjects provided the investigator with details 
of their regular-use laxative regimen. This regimen was maintained throughout the screening period. At 
visit 2, up to 28 days later, subjects were randomised to treatment with either naldemedine or placebo for 
2 weeks.  
During the treatment period subjects attended 3 scheduled visits: baseline/randomisation (Visit 2), Day 
8 (Visit 3), and Day 15 (Visit 4), and completed the diary evaluating bowel movement daily. The 
PAC-SYM/PAC-QOL was completed at Day 1 and Day 15.  
Methods 
Study Participants  
The trial was conducted in cancer patients with OIC and investigated the effect of naldemedine relative to 
placebo. Subjects on a stable laxative regimen at screening would to continue on that regimen.  
The main inclusion criteria were 
•  Diagnosis of cancer and OIC 
•  Cancer condition expected to be stable during the study period 
•  Age 20 years or older  
• 
Treatment with opioids (regular-use) for at least 2 weeks prior to screening, and treatment with 
a stable opioid regimen for 14 days prior to randomisation (100 to 150% of the dose of 
regular-use opioids on the day of 14 days prior to the randomisation) 
•  At most 5 SBMS during 14 consecutive days prior to randomisation with one or more of the 
following bowel symptoms in 25% or more of all BMs regardless of use of rescue laxatives.  
o  Straining during bowel movement (2 (moderate) or above on straining symptom score) 
o  Feeling of incomplete evacuation 
o  Passage of hard stools or pellets (1 or 2 on Bristol stool form scale) 
Note that a BM occurring within 24 hours after rescue laxatives does not count as an SBM. 
•  Subjects who could walk and carry out daily activities without assistance (0 to 2 on performance 
status of Eastern cooperative oncology group)  
•  Subjects who could assess the condition (reccordance in the diary by somebody on behalf of the 
subject was allowed) 
The main exclusion criteria were 
•  Subjects who had never taken laxatives for the treatment of OIC 
•  Subjects who had reported no bowel movements for 7 consecutive days prior to the treatment 
period 
•  Subjects treated with chemotherapy with known gastro intestinal effects 
Trial drug was to be discontinued for any of the following reasons:  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 118/209 
 
 
 
 
•  Worsening of the target disease, for instance progression of cancer, worsening of constipation 
•  On the discretion of the investigator because of safety concerns or other reasons 
•  Subjects was proved to be ineligible for the study 
• 
• 
If the subject met the liver discontinuation criteria (abnormal liver function test) 
Lost to follow-up 
Withdrawal from the trial: subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the trial for any reason at any time. For 
withdrawn subjects every effort is made to complete the end-of-study (or early termination) 
assessments. All subjects who withdrew or discontinued due to an AE were to be followed until resolution 
of such AE or until the unresolved adverse events were judged by the investigator to have stabilised, or 
lost to follow-up.  
Treatments 
Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either naldemedine 0.2 mg QD or placebo tables matching 0.2 
mg naldemedine QD orally. Every effort was to be made to take the study drug at approximately the same 
time each day regardless of meal conditions. However on day 2, patients must have received the study 
drug 24 hours or more after the first administration of the study drug.  
Opioid treatment: The stable opioid regimen from the before randomisation should be kept throughout 
the trial.  
Laxatives: If subjects were on a laxative regimen prior to the study that regimen should be maintained 
throughout the study. Temporarily discontinuation or dose-reduction was allowed in case the investigator 
was concerned about the effect of AE on the subject’s quality of life.  
Rescue medication: Rexcue laxatives were allowed as-needed, but prohibited 24 hours before and after 
the first dose of the study drug. A BM occurring within 24 hours after rescue therapy was not counted as 
an SBM.  
Objectives 
Primary objective: To compare the efficacy assessed over 14 day’s treatment based on the responder 
proportion of naldemedine 0.2 mg QD versus placebo in subjects with cancer and OIC.  
Secondary objectives:  
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of naldemedine compared to placebo for the secondary endpoint 
To evaluate the safety of naldemedine compared to placebo 
To assess the pharmacokinetic profiles of naldemedine and its metabolite nor-naldemedine. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
A response week was defined as at least 3 SBMS per week and an increase from baseline of at least 1 SBM 
per week for that week. Baseline was defined as the average number of SBMs per week during the 14-day 
period prior to the treatment period. (Response for CSBM was defined similarly). The primary efficacy 
endpoint was the proportion of SBM responders during the 2-week treatment period.  
Secondary endpoints were: 
•

Sample size 
Based on previous study experience a conservative assumption of 37.5% responders in the placebo group 
and a 23.5% difference between the two groups was assumed. In order to have at least 90% power for 
detecting such a difference between the two groups for a 2-sided 5% significance level using the 
chi-squared test a total of 188 subjects need to be randomised. Moreover based on previous experience 
it is assumed that 1% of subjects randomised will be excluded from FAS, thus 190 subjects were planned 
to be enrolled.  
Randomisation 
At visit 2, eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 manner to one of the treatment groups. The 
interactive web-response system IWRS was used to assign patients to numbers for which treatment had 
already been randomly assigned. The randomisation was completed with the stochastic minimisation 
method to adjust patient numbers so that the difference in the numbers did not exceed 2 between the 
treatment groups in participating study sites.

Blinding (masking) 
The trial was conducted in a double-blind manner by using matching placebo canisters in appearance, 
labelling, and packaging. Moreover the test drug and placebo were indistinguishable in terms of 
appearance, shape, and smell.  
All subjects, study personnel, and data analysts were blinded to the treatment assigned at randomisation 
until database lock. The randomisation schedule was only accessible to the person responsible for the 
study drug assignment and the person responsible for the bioanalytical laboratory. Plasma drug 
concentration were only reported to the sponsor after the database was locked. During the trial the 
investigator could perform an emergency unblinding for AEs if the safety of the patients was at risk. In 
such case the sponsor was notified and the date and reason for the unblinding was recorded in the source 
documents.  
Statistical methods 
Primary endpoint:  
A response week was defined as at least 3 SBMS per week and an increase from baseline of at least 1 SBM 
per week for that week. Baseline was defined as the average number of SBMs per week during the 14-day 
period prior to the treatment period. (Response for CSBM was defined similarly).  
The frequency of SBMs per week was defined as 7*(total frequency of SBMs during the treatment 
period)/(Number of days in the treatment period).  
The change in frequency of SBMs per week was defined as (Frequency of SBMs per week in the 2-week 
treatment period)-(Frequency of SBMs per week in the baseline period). 
The definitions for CSBM were similar. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of SBM responders during the 2-week treatment period.  
Analysis populations: 
FAS: All randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had an evaluation of OIC at 
baseline and at least another evaluation of OIC after the initiation of study drug.  
PPS: All randomised subjects meeting the following criteria:  
•  Met all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria 
•  No major deviations of study procedure 
•  Appropriate follow-up 
Major protocol deviations were identified before unblinding the database. For both analysis populations 
subjects were analysed as randomised.  
Handling of missing values: 
Missing values of frequency of SBMs per week were imputed using last observation carried forward.  
If more than 50% of the PAC-QOL items of a domain were missing, the mean score for that domain was 
set to missing. If PAC-QOL was missing for at least 1 domain, the overall score was set to missing.

EMA/466/2019

Statistical analysis of primary endpoint:  
The proportion of SBM responders during the 2-week treatment period were compared between the two 
treatment groups using chi-square test for the FAS. Moreover confidence intervals for proportions and the 
difference between proportions will be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. The comparison was 
also done for PPS as a sensitivity analysis.  
Statistical analysis of secondary endpoints:  
All secondary endpoints were analysed on FAS.  
A PAC-SYM responder was defined as a patient with at least a 1 point improvement in PAC-SYM from 
baseline. A PAC-QOL responder was defined as a patient with at least a 1 point improvement in the 
PAC-QOL domain “dissatisfaction” from baseline.  
Proportions of patients with CSBM response during the 2-week treatment period, the proportion of 
SBM/CSBM responders during each observation week, the proportion of patients with at least 1 
SCBM//CSBM for each observation time point within 24 hours after the first administration of study drug 
during the 2-week treatment period, and proportion of PAC-SYM/PAC-QOL responders was analysed 
similarly to the primary endpoint.   
Change in frequency from baseline to different time periods were compared between naldemedine and 
placebo groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with frequency at baseline as a covariate. This 
type of analysis was done for: 
•  Change in the frequency of SBMs/CSBMs per week from baseline during the 2-week treatment 
period 
•  Change in the frequency of SBMs with BSS score of 3 or 4 per week from baseline during the 
2-week treatment period 
•  Change in the frequency of SBMs per week without straining from baseline during the 2-week 
treatment period 
•  Change in the number of days with at least 1 SBM/CSBM per week from baseline during the 
2-week treatment period 
Weekly change in frequency per week from baseline during the 2-week treatment will be done using 
MMRM including treatment group, week, and week-by-treatment group interaction as fixed factors, and 
the frequency at baseline as covariate. An unstructured covariance matrix within subjects will be 
assumed. 
This type of analysis was done for: 
•  Weekly change in the frequency of SBMs/CSBMs per week from baseline during the 2-week 
treatment period 
•  Weekly change in the frequency of SBMs per week without straining from baseline during the 
2-week treatment period 
•  Weekly change in the frequency of SBMs with BSS score of 3 or 4 per week without straining from 
baseline during the 2-week treatment period 
•  Daily change in the frequency of SBMs from baseline during the 2-week treatment period 
(substituting week with day in the model description above)

•  Weekly change in the abdominal bloating and abdominal discomfort scores from baseline during 
the 2-week treatment period 
Time to first SBM/CSBM after the first administration of study drug is presented in a Kaplan-Meier plot, 
and median time with CI is calculated for each treatment group. The distribution of times was compared 
between groups using a generalized Wilcoxon test.  
Change in frequency of rescue-use laxative per week from baseline during the 2-week treatment period 
was compared between naldemedine and placebo using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.  
Mean changes in the scores for PAC-SYM/PAC-QOL and their domains were compared between 
naldemedine and placebo using a t-test.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 290 subjects were screened. Out of these 97 (33%) failed screening resulting in a total of 193 
subjects randomised, 97 to naldemedine and 96 to placebo with respectively 83 (85.6%) and 88 (91.7%) 
completing the study. The main reasons for discontinuation were adverse events and other. Adverse 
events were much more common for subjects on naldemedine (10.3% compared to 1.0%).  
In the naldemedine group 5 subjects withdrew due to diarrhoea, the other AEs belonging to the SOC of 
infections and infestations or a different SOC. Apart from this, reasons for withdrawal seemed balanced 
and completion rates comparable and reasonably high.

Recruitment 
The trial was a multicentre trial with 70 sites in Japan. The first subject was enrolled in November 2013 
and the last subject completed in April 2015.  
Conduct of the study 
The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and ICH Good Clinical Practice. The 
original protocol dated 24 September 2013 was amended on 23 October 2013 before the first subject was 
enrolled. 
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics of the FAS population were generally well balanced across treatment 
groups. The mean age was around 64 years with about 90% of subjects being 50 years or above. The 
majority of patients were male (61.7%) and all were Asian from Japan. The study population had a mean 
weight of 55 kg, and only a minority of subjects (approximately 12%) were overweight or obese (BMI 
above 25 kg/m2). The majority of subjects had performance status 1 (54%), and 32% respectively 15% 
had performance status 0 and 2. 
At baseline, the mean regular-use opioid per day (dose of opioid analgesics converted into equivalent oral 
morphine dose) was 57.3 mg for the naldemedine group and 69.5 mg for the placebo group. The 
maximum dose was 270 mg for naldemedine and 720 mg for placebo.   
The mean SBMs per week was around 1 with a median of also 1.  
All subjects had cancer and were treated with opioids. The primary tumour was lung (43.5%), breast 
(19.5%), large intestine (3.1%), and other (31.6%). In total 87.6% had metastasis. About a third of 
subjects had a previous medical condition, and almost all subject had concurrent medical condition.  
Regular-use opioid therapy was received by all subjects during both the screening period and the 
treatment period, most frequently oxycodone and fentanyl. Rescue-use opioid therapy was received by a 
similar proportion in the two groups (63.9% for naldemedine and 61.5% for placebo during screening, 
and 66.0% for naldemedine and 61.5% for placebo during treatment).  
The most commonly reported concurrent medical conditions were hypertension (33.7%), insomnia 
(34.7%), diabetes mellitus (11.9%), and decreased appetite (11.4%).

Numbers analysed 
A total of 193 subjects were randomised, 97 to naldemedine and 96 to placebo. They were all included in 
the FAS. In both treatment groups 17 subjects were excluded from the PPS. One subjects in the 
naldemedine group, and 2 subjects in the placebo group, were excluded because of ineligibility. The rest 
were excluded because of treatment violation, which was defined as deviation of the concomitant 
medicine, treatment compliance less than 80%, or that the treatment period ended prior to day 15 to 17.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary analysis: 
The proportion of SBM responders during the 2-week treatment period was 71.1% for naldemedine and 
34.4% for placebo. The treatment effect was 36.76% and was statistically significant. The sensitivity 
analysis using PPS instead of FAS gave a very similar result, with a treatment effect of 37.06%. An 
additional post-hoc analysis compared the proportions using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and 
stratifying by opioid group (< 60 mg and ≥ 60 mg). The overall result was very similar, but it is worth 
noting that the placebo group response varies by opioid group dose.

Subgroup analyses 
Non-cancer studies:  
The primary endpoint was proportion of SBM responders defined as at least 3 SBMs/week with at least 1 
SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 out of 12 weeks and at least 3 of the last 4 weeks. This was 
analysed according to subgroup for the individual studies V9231 and V9232, and the pool. The subgroups 
examined were age, gender, race, BMI, region, opioid dose strata, average TDD, opioid type, and 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at baseline.  Subjects were assigned to an opioid type if the 
dose of that opioid corresponded to at least 75% of the total MED during the 12-week treatment period.

Responders, SBM 
Pool of V9231 and V9232: The primary endpoint was proportion of SBM responders defined as at least 3 
SBMs/week with at least 1 SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 out of 12 weeks and at least 3 
of the last 4 weeks. Treatment with naldemedine resulted in a significantly larger proportion responders 
than treatment with placebo (p=0.0020). The difference in proportion of responders was 16.0%.  
Pool of V9222 and V9236: The primary endpoint, proportion of SBM responders, was defined as at least 
3 SBMs/week and an increase in frequency of SBM from baseline of at least 1 SBM/week during the 
2-week treatment period. Treatment with naldemedine resulted in a significantly larger proportion 
responders than treatment with placebo (p=<0.0001). The difference in proportion of responders was 
38.0%.  
Despite the different definitions of SBM responders, the proportions and treatment differences are 
generally similar across all studies: 
Figure 11 – Consistency of SBM Responder Rates Across Studies 
In order to better compare the proportions of SBM responders, the following post-hoc definition of SBM 
responders for the first 2 weeks was implemented: at least 3 SBMs/week (on average) with at least 1 
SBM/week (on average) increase from baseline at both Week 1 and 2 of the treatment period.  
The treatment difference for proportion of SBM responders in the first 2 weeks in the non-cancer studies 
were 20.8%, 21.8%, and 21.3% for V9231, V9232, and the pool respectively. For the cancer studies the 
treatment differences was 38.7%, 34.8%, and 36.3% for V9222, V9236, and the pool respectively.

Responders, CBM 
Pool of V9231 and V9232: A CSBM responder was defined as at least 3 CSBMs/week with at least 1 
CSBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 out of 12 weeks and at least 3 of the last 4 weeks. 
Treatment with naldemedine resulted in a significantly larger proportion responders than treatment with 
placebo (p<0.0001). The difference in proportion of responders was 11.9%, compared to 10.6% (V9231) 
and 13.3% (V9232) in the individual studies.  
Pool of V9222 and V9236: A CSBM responder was defined as at least 3 CSBMs/week and an increase in 
frequency of CSBM from baseline of at least 1 CSBM/week during the 2-week treatment period. 
Treatment with naldemedine resulted in a significantly larger proportion responders than treatment with 
placebo (p=<0.0001). The difference in proportion of responders was 29.4%, compared to 32.3% 
(V9222) and 27.7% (V9236) in the individual studies.

Despite the different definitions of CSBM responders, the proportions and treatment differences are 
generally similar across all studies:

Consistency 
The studies were of different durations, but the results in below figures show changes in SBM ranging 
from 3.37 to 5.42 SBM/week for naldemedine compared to 1.42 to 2.15 SBM/week for placebo. Similarly 
changes in CSBM ranged from 2.69 to 2.90 CSB/week for naldemedine compared to 0.68 to 1.72 
CSBM/week for placebo.

Moreover changes in frequency of SBMs from baseline to Week 1 ranged from 3.64 to 6.24 SBM/week for 
naldemedine compared to 1.50 to 1.81 SBM/week for placebo, see the below figure.

Time to onset of action 
Median time to first SBM was significantly shorter for naldemedine than placebo, both in studies V9231, 
V9232, and the pool. The results were 16.07 vs 46.73, 18.33 vs 45.92, and 17.67 vs. 46.70 hours for 
V9231, V9232, and the pool respectively. Note that consistent results were found in V9221 with median 
times of 11.08 and 49.57 hours for naldemedine and placebo.  
Median time to first SBM was significantly shorter for naldemedine than placebo, both in studies V9222, 
V9236, and the pool. The results were 4.33 vs 45.43, 4.67 vs 26.58, and 4.42 vs. 30.88 hours for V9231, 
V9232, and the pool respectively.

Quality of life 
Non-cancer pain: PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL scores were assessed at baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, and 12 in 
V9231 and V9232, and in V9235 at Weeks 2, 12, 24, 36, and 52. Changes in the overall score for PAC-SYM 
from baseline to Weeks 2 and 12 were similar for the three studies and all statistically significant 
improved for naldemedine compared to placebo. The treatment effects ranged from -0.25 to -0.35. For 
study V9235 statistically significant improvements for naldemedine were also found at all later time 
points. The results for each domain of the PAC-SYM were generally similar to the overall score, with the 
exception that the abdominal symptoms domain was not significantly improved in study V9232, there was 
only a numeric improvement.  Changes in the overall score for PAC-QOL from baseline to Weeks 2 and 12 
were similar for the three studies and all statistically significant improved for naldemedine compared to 
placebo. The treatment effects ranged from -0.26 to -0.40. The results for each domain of the PAC-SYM 
were generally similar to the overall score, with the exception that for the psychosocial discomfort domain 
there was only a numeric improvement in studies V9231 and V9232, but it was not statistical significant. 
For study V9235 statistically significant improvements for naldemedine were also found at all later time 
points. 
Study V9236 (cancer): For the PAC-SYM overall scores as well as for all domain scores, apart from the 
stool symptom score, there was no difference in change from baseline between naldemedine and placebo. 
The change from baseline in PAC-SYM stool symptoms score was more improved for naldemedine than for 
placebo both at Visit 4 and at last observation. For the PAC-QOL overall scores as well as for all domain 
scores, apart from the dissatisfaction score, there was no difference in change from baseline between 
naldemedine and placebo. The change from baseline in PAC-QOL dissatisfaction score was more improved 
for naldemedine than for placebo but only at Visit 4.

LIR/non-LIR subgroup 
Responders 
Pool of V9231 and V9232: The primary endpoint, proportion of SBM responders during the treatment 
period, was defined as at least 3 SBMs/week with at least 1 SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 
9 out of 12 weeks and at least 3 of the last 4 weeks. The proportion of SBM responders was significantly 
higher for naldemedine than for placebo for both the LIR and non-LIR subgroups. The treatment effects 
were 16.2% and 15.6% for the LIR and the non-LIR subgroups respectively.  For CSBM responders, 
defined analogously, the proportion was significantly higher for naldemedine than for placebo for both the 
LIR and non-LIR subgroups. The treatment effects were 10.5% and 15.1% for the LIR and the non-LIR 
subgroups respectively. 
An SBM responders during the first 4 weeks was defined as at least 3 SBMs/week (on average) with at 
least 1 SBM/week (on average) increase over baseline in at least 3 of the 4 weeks. The proportion of SBM 
responders in the first 4 weeks was significantly higher for naldemedine than for placebo for both the LIR

subgroups respectively.   
V9221: The proportion of SBM responders during the first 2 weeks was defined as at least 3 SBMs/week 
(on average) with at least 1 SBM/week (on average) increase over baseline at both Week 1 and Week 2 
of the treatment period. The proportion of SBM responders was significantly higher for naldemedine than 
for placebo for both the LIR and non-LIR subgroups. The treatment effects were 25.0% and 35.0% for the 
LIR and the non-LIR subgroups respectively.  
An SBM responder during the first 4 weeks was defined as at least 3 SBMs/week with at least 1 SBM/week 
increase over baseline in at least 3 of the 4 weeks. The proportion of SBM responders in the first 4 weeks 
was numerically higher for naldemedine than for placebo for both the LIR and non-LIR subgroups. The 
treatment effects were 30.7% and 28.8% for the LIR and the non-LIR subgroups respectively, but only 
statistically significant for the LIR subgroup, most likely due to the small size of the non-LIR subgroup.   
Pool of V9222 and V9236: The proportion of SBM responders during the first 2 weeks was defined as at 
least 3 SBMs/week (on average) with at least 1 SBM/week (on average) increase over baseline at both 
Week 1 and Week 2 of the treatment period. The proportion of SBM responders was significantly higher 
for naldemedine than for placebo for both the LIR and non-LIR subgroups. The treatment effects were

Supportive studies 
There are three supportive studies. All supportive studies (V9237, V9238 and V9239) were single-arm, 
open-label studies conducted in Japan. Study V9237 was conducted as a follow-up study in cancer 
patients who had completed participation in Study V9236; treatment period of this study was 12 weeks 
and 131 patients were enrolled. Studies V9238 and V9239 were conducted over 48 weeks in non-cancer 
patients and included 40 and 10 patients, respectively. In all three supportive studies, patients were 
treated with naldemedine 0.2 mg once daily and use of regular and rescue laxatives was permitted.  
The primary objective in all three supportive studies was to evaluate the long-term safety of naldemedine 
in patients with chronic (non-)cancer pain and OIC, and efficacy was included as a secondary objective. 
Efficacy variables included change in (C)SBM frequency, proportion of (C)SBM responders and change in 
and proportion of PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL (responders).  
All patients included in the supportive studies were Asian and mean weight in the three studies was 53-55 
kg. Mean daily dose of opioids (as equivalent oral morphine dose) was 45-75 mg, median daily opioid 
dose was 45-60 mg and the range across all three studies was 5-720 mg daily. Among all three studies, 
27 (14.75%) patients were treated with a daily opioid dose ≥120 mg and 47 (25.68%) patients were 
treated with a daily dose <30 mg.  Use of regular- (and rescue-) laxatives (other than naldemedine) 
during the study period was 70-90%.  
In Study V9237, treatment with naldemedine improved PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL scores compared to 
baseline. At end-of-trial, mean change from baseline was -0.39 (±0.54) for PAC-SYM score however, the 
effect had declined from the beginning of the extension study (V9237), where the PAC-SYM score 
difference from baseline was -0.91 (±0.56). At end-of-trial, the proportions of PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL 
responders were 18.5% and 35.3%, respectively.  
In Study V9238, the proportion of SBM responders was 85.7% at Week 1 and 76.2% at Week 2 [LOCF] 
was noticeable higher compared with the results from the 12 Weeks pivotal non-cancer studies 
(47.6-52.5%, Studies V9231 and V9232) and also a bit higher than the results from the 2 Weeks pivotal 
cancer studies (71.1–77.6%, Studies V9236 and V9222). The overall change from baseline in PAC-SYM 
was -0.92 (-0.81 for LOCF) after the full treatment period (48 weeks). The results were stable throughout 
the observation period (from Week 6) and statistically significant (p<0.0001) but somewhat lower than

the results in the pivotal studies (i.e. -1.01 in Study V9232, -1.23 in Study V9235 and-1.25 in Study 
V9236). Similar results are found for PAC-QOL (-1.03 in the present Study V9237 and -1.08 and -1.26 in 
Studies V9235 and V9236, respectively).  
In Study 9239, the proportion of SBM and CSBM responders was 90% and 50%, respectively after 2 
weeks treatment. The proportion of (C)SBM responders was not evaluated again during the 48 treatment 
weeks. With regards to PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL score, at end of study (48 weeks treatment), the overall 
change from baseline in PAC-SYM was -0.94 (-0.89 for LOCF). The results for PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL 
were stable throughout the observation period (from Week 6) and statistically significant (p<0.0001 for 
PAC-SYM and p<0.002 for PAC-QOL).  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Dose-finding: 
Dose-finding  was  explored  in  three  phase  II  studies,  two  in  non-cancer  patients,  studies  V9214  and 
V9221,  and  one  study  in  cancer  patients,  study  V9222.  All  studies  were  randomised,  double-blind, 
placebo-controlled studies. Study V9214 was a small study evaluating 6 dose levels (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 
1 and 3 mg) with the primary efficacy change from baseline to 24 hours post-dose in the number of SBMs. 
Study  V9221  was  subsequently  performed  based  on  the  results  from  study  V9214  testing  doses  of 
naldemedine  0.1  mg,  0.2  mg,  or  0.4  mg  QD  with  the  primary  endpoint,  change  in  the  frequency  of 
SBMs/week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of the treatment period. Responder rates were part of the 
secondary endpoints. In study V9222, the same dose range was tested with the primary endpoint change 
in  the  frequency  of  SBMs/week  from  baseline.  In  this  study,  responder  rates  were  also  part  of  the 
secondary endpoint. The study designs as well as the choice of doses in these studies are reasonable.  
Pivotal studies:  
All  4  pivotal  studies,  3  in  non-cancer  patients  (V9231,  V9232,  and  V9235)  and  1  in  cancer  patients 
(V9236) were randomised double-blind studies comparing treatment with naldemedine to treatment with 
placebo. The trials used the to-be recommended dose of 0.2 mg naldemedine QD, and the study designs 
are in general in accordance with requirements in current EMA Guidelines (including EMA Guideline on the 
evaluation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  constipation  (including  opioid  induced 
constipation)  and  for  bowel  cleansing  [EMA/CPMP/336243/2013]).  Duration  of  treatment  period  and 
follow-up  period  are  also  in  accordance  with  current  guidelines,  apart  from  trial  V9236,  where  the 
treatment duration was only 2 weeks compared to the recommended 4 weeks. The trial was, however, 
designed prior to the publishing of the guideline and as such is considered appropriate. All studies apart 
from V9236 conducted in Japan, were multi-national including study centres in Europe and the US as well 
as  Asia  Pacific.  All  4  pivotal  studies  used  comparison  to  placebo,  which  is  in  line  with  the  guideline, 
although the guideline also suggests consideration of inclusion of an active comparator. The choice of 
using  placebo  is  nevertheless  accepted  even  though  methylnaltrexone  (Relistor®,  as  subcutaneous 
injection) was approved in 2008. 
All  trials  used  appropriate  inclusion  criteria  in  accordance  with  the  guideline  ensuring  that  the  opioid 
induced constipation is as stable as possible and that change in SBM are not due to changes in opioid 
therapy.  
Trials V9231 and V9232 investigated the effect of naldemedine as monotherapy and discontinued laxative 
use  at  screening,  whereas  in  trials  V9235  and  V9236  subjects  using  a  stable  laxatives  regimen  at 
screening  would  continue  this  regimen  throughout  the  trial,  and  hence  investigated  the  effect  of 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 144/209 
 
 
 
 
naldemedine both as add-on to laxatives and as monotherapy. In trial V9235, the subgroup of subjects on 
stable  laxative  regimen/subjects  not  on  a  stable  laxative  regimen  was  analysed  resulting  in  similar 
results. A similar subgroup analysis was performed in V9236 showing effectiveness of naldemedine in 
both settings.  
For trials V9231 and V9232, the primary endpoint (proportion of responders) is in accordance with the 
guideline,  and  the  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints  constitute  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of 
supportive evidence. Trial V9235 is a long-term safety study with efficacy as secondary endpoint. The 
primary endpoint for trial V9236 was proportion of responders, although this according to the guideline 
should only be a secondary evaluation due to the reduction in power. Also in this study the secondary 
endpoints constitute a comprehensive evaluation of supportive evidence.  
The methods for randomisation are considered adequate, although in trial V9235 stratification according 
to stable laxative regimen was not performed.  
In trials V9231 and V9232, a pre-specified fixed sequence approach to control the family wise type 1 error 
rate  for  the testing  of  secondary  efficacy  endpoints is  used,  which  is  supported.  For  trials  V9235  and 
V9236 there is no multiplicity adjustment for secondary endpoints, hence the results of those analyses 
are considered exploratory only.  
The method for computing number of SBMs per week varies by study, which complicates comparisons, 
however this is acceptable. In trials V9231 and V9232, a total of at least 4 days of diary entries related to 
defecation a week is necessary, otherwise the week will be considered non-evaluable. This choice seems 
arbitrary and is questioned, however repeating the analysis with choosing 3 or 5 days instead of 4 days 
did not change the result. 
The frequency of SBMs (BMs) per week was defined as: 
• 
• 
• 
Trials V9231 and V9232: 7*(total frequency of SBMs in the week)/(Number of days of observation 
related to defecation in the week) 
Trial  V9235:  7*(total  frequency  of  BMs  for  each  selected  visit)/(Number  of  days  of  observation 
related to defecation for each selected visit) 
Trial  V9236:  7*(total  frequency  of  SBMs  during  the  treatment  period)/(Number  of  days  in  the 
treatment period) 
The  first  two  definitions  implicitly  assume  that  days  with  diary  entry  related  to  defecation  are 
representative of days without diary entry related to defecation. As it seems more likely that the diary is 
filled in if there is a BM to register, this assumption may not be valid. However, in subsequent analyses 
where  missing  entries  were  regarded  as  0  (bowel  movements)  (and  the  corresponding  week  not 
considered non-evaluable in spite of missing entries) naldemedine was consistently statistically superior 
to placebo. Similar results were obtained in a number of sensitivity analyses applying a range of different 
definitions of how to handle missing values (including a worst case scenario where weeks which had any 
number of missing entries of bowel movements were regarded as a non-response week) demonstrating 
the robustness of results.  
Several analyses are performed comparing changes between groups using an ANCOVA, but there is no 
adjustment for baseline. Additional analyses including baseline as a covariate have been provided with 
unchanged results.  
Rizmoic was chosen for a routine GCP inspection. At the inspection, critical GCP violations were recorded 
for study V9235 necessitating exclusion of data from these sites. The overall results were not significantly 
affected by the exclusion of data. In addition, it was noted that patients did not have the possibility to 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 145/209 
 
 
 
 
correct the electronic diary regarding the number of spontaneous bowl movements. This was considered 
a critical GCP finding. The applicant was therefore requested to complete and submit a re-analysis of 
efficacy  data  (of  studies  V9231,  V9232  and  V9235)  including  primary  as  well  as  secondary  efficacy 
endpoint following correction of data based on the available source documentation at participating sites 
(including un-submitted and un-generated DCFs).  
Upon  collection  of  data  correction  forms  the  applicant  performed the  requested  re-analyses  based  on 
available  source  documentation  at  the  participating  sites  and  previously  submitted  but  denied  data 
change requests. No data corrections impacted the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in Study 
V9231 and so no re-analyses were required for this study.  Re-analysis of the primary and secondary 
endpoints in Study V9232 showed very similar or identical results to the original analyses. Similarly, no 
changes were seen in the sensitivity analyses for this study. Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints 
in Study V9235 using the updated database (there was no primary efficacy endpoint in this study) were 
very similar to the original analyses with no clinically important differences seen between the analyses.  
These  results  show  that  inclusion  of  denied,  unsubmitted,  and  ungenerated  data  clarification  forms 
(DCFs) for electronic patient outcomes data has not altered the positive benefit:risk assessment seen for 
naldemedine based on the original analyses. 
Supportive studies:  
All three supportive studies (V9237, V9238 and V9239) were designed as single-arm, open-label studies 
conducted in Japan. The design of the trial as well as the limited number of included patients (total 181 in 
all three studies) limit firm conclusions and the trials must therefore be considered to be only supportive 
for the pivotal studies. In all three supportive studies, patients were treated with naldemedine 0.2 mg 
once daily. The dose could be temporary reduced (to 0.1 mg) or treatment could be temporary 
discontinued in case of the patients’ QOL was reduced due to GI AE.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose-finding: 
In  study  V9214,  0.3  mg  was  the  minimum  effective  dose  in  patients  treated  with  at  least  90  mg 
morphine-equivalent  dose  (MED)  per  day  The  primary  endpoint  was  not  adjusted  for  any  baseline 
imbalance  as  regards  to  baseline  opioid  dose.  Study  V9221,  exploring  if  the  dose  found  to  be  the 
minimally effective dose in study V9214 (0.3 mg) would be the most appropriate dose, found that the 0.2 
mg and the 0.4 mg dose differed statistically and clinically relevant from both placebo and the 0.1 mg 
dose,  but  between  the  0.2  mg  and  the  0.4  mg  doses  there  was  no  clinically  or  statistically  relevant 
difference,  although  a  numerically  better  efficacy  was  observed  for  all  endpoint  for  the  0.4  mg  dose. 
However, the 0.4 mg dose was associated with a higher number of adverse events as compared to the 0.2 
mg dose. It thus seem that, based on this study, that the 0.2 mg dose is the optimal dose, but it is noted 
that mean dose of opioid analgesic was “only” 120-146 mg MED. This could question whether 0.2 mg 
naldemedine is the optimal dose in patients who are treated with higher doses. Higher doses than e.g. 
150 mg MED are not uncommon in European cancer and non-cancer patients. Study V9222 found a clear 
dose-response with the 0.4 mg dose resulting in both clinically relevant and statistically higher number of 
SBM as compared to both placebo, the 0.1 mg and the 0.2 mg dose. It is however also noted that with the 
0.4 mg dose the mean was 8.35 SBM/week with an SD of 8.35. This means that some of these patients 
had more than one SBM per day. In fact, 52% in the 0.4 g dose group had an AE of diarrhoea vs. 40% in 
the 0.2 mg dose group and approximately 25% and 27% in the 0.1 mg dose group and placebo group, 
respectively.  The  0.1  mg  dose  was  just  statistically  significant  superior  to  placebo  and  0.2  mg  was 
numerically more efficient than the 0.1 mg dose. In this study, the most appropriate dose is 0.2 mg. 
However, this study vs. study V9221 in non-cancer patients, the dose-response is much more evident and

the number of responders and change from baseline in BM is higher. Considering the pharmacological 
mode of action of naldemedine (mu-receptor antagonist), the efficacy of naldemidine must be considered 
clearly dependent on the amount of opioid used. Even though comparison across studies should always be 
done with caution, it is striking that there is clearly a better effect in particular for the 0.4 mg dose in the 
cancer patients in study V9222 as compared to the non-cancer study V9214. The dose-response is also 
much clearer in study V9222. This could be explained by the overall lower mean opioid use in study V9222 
and  the  relatively  large  number  of  patients  who  had  a  baseline  opioid  use  of  less  than  50  mg.  This 
questions if the chosen dose of 0.2 mg is sufficiently effective in patients with a high daily opioid use. 
However, considering also the results from the pivotal studies the 0.2 mg naldemedine dose appear to be 
the most optimal dose for the treatment opioid induced constipation in patients treated with up to 400 mg 
MED  and  the  SmPC  informs  the  prescriber  adequately  that  about  the  limited  experience  in  patients 
treated with opioid pain medicinal product(s) at daily doses of more than the equivalent of 400 mg of 
morphine. 
Pivotal studies 
For  all  trials,  the  recruitment  and  participant  flow  are  adequately  described.  The  main  reasons  for 
discontinuation were subject withdrawal and adverse events (mainly in the gastrointestinal SOC), which 
appeared more common in the naldemedine group. 
The protocol amendments are generally well described in the clinical study reports.  
For  all  trials,  the  patients’  characteristics  were  generally  well  balanced  between  the  two  treatment 
groups,  and  generally  the  study  populations  seemed  to  reflect  the  general  population  in  which 
naldemedine is intended to be used. However, the baseline mean opioid dose (in oral morphine equivalent 
doses) is considered relatively low in the pivotal non-cancer studies (118-140 mg) and also in the cancer 
studies (57-69 mg) questioning the efficacy of naldemedine in patients who are treated with higher opioid 
doses. It is sufficiently reflected in the SmPC that there is limited experience in patients treated with more 
than 400 mg morphine-equivalent daily doses.  
For trials V9231, V9232 and V9235 the ITT population consisted of all subjects. However, it is noted that 
there was double enrolment at for three patients at different sites. These were withdrawn from the study. 
SBM/CSBM responders:  
Trials V9231, V9232, and the pool (non-cancer): 
SBM responder during the 12-week treatment period was defined as at least 3 SBMs/week with at least 1 
SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 out of 12 weeks and at least 3 of the last 4 weeks, and 
CSBM responders were defined similarly. 
The  treatment  difference  for  naldemedine  relative  to  placebo  was  13%,  18.9%,  and  16.0% 
• 
respectively for proportion of SBM responders, and 10.6%, 13.3%, and 11.9% for proportion of CSBM 
responders, all statistically significant.  
Trials V9222, V9236, and the pool (cancer):  
SBM responder during the 2-week treatment period was defined as at least 3 SBMs/week with at least 1 
SBM/week  increase  over  baseline  during  the  treatment  period,  and  CSBM  responders  were  defined 
similarly. 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

The  treatment  difference  for  naldemedine  relative  to  placebo  was  40.1%,  36.8%,  and  38.0% 
• 
respectively for proportion of SBM responders, and 32.3%, 27.7%, and 29.4% for proportion of CSBM 
responders, all statistically significant. 
As seen, the treatment effects on both SBM and CSBM responders are 2-3 fold higher in the cancer studies 
than in the non-cancer studies. 
In  order  to  better  compare  the  proportions  of  SBM  responders  between  trials,  the  following  common 
post-hoc definition of SBM responders for the first 2 weeks was implemented: at least 3 SBMs/week (on 
average) with at least 1 SBM/week (on average) increase from baseline at both Week 1 and 2 of the 
treatment period.  
The treatment difference for proportion of SBM responders in the first 2 weeks in the non-cancer 
• 
studies  was  20.8%,  21.8%,  and  21.3%  for  V9231,  V9232,  and  the  pool  respectively.  For  the  cancer 
studies  the  treatment  difference  was  38.7%,  34.8%,  and  36.3%  for  V9222,  V9236,  and  the  pool 
respectively. 
Subgroup analyses:  
In the non-cancer studies, subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint showed no difference as regards to 
differences in  age, gender,  BMI, region, opioid dose strata, average TDD, and eGFR at baseline.  It is 
reassuring that patients who are treated with MED higher than 200 mg show convincing treatment effect 
of naldemedine relative to placebo, although it is noted that only few patients received more than 400 mg 
MED. In addition there is limited experience in patients aged 75 years or older. This is reflected in the 
SmPC and added to the RMP as missing information. 
Patients  treated  with  partial  agonists  such  as  buprenorphine  were  not  included  in  the  studies.  It  is 
possible that naldemedine might not be as effective in treating opioid induced obstipation caused by a 
partial  opioid  agonist.  It  is  reflected  in  the  SmPC  that  there  is  no  experience  for  the  treatment  of 
constipation induced by partial opioid my-receptor agonists.  
In the Black/African American subgroup of patients the response in the naldemedine arm compared to 
placebo overall is non-existing, mainly because of high placebo response in both pivotal trials and an 
absolute lack of efficacy of naldemedine in this patient subgroup in trial V9132. 
Similarly  for  the  cancer  studies  the  primary  endpoint  was  analysed  according  to  subgroup  for  the 
individual  studies  V9222  and  V9236,  and  the  pool.  The  subgroups  examined  were  age,  gender,  BMI, 
average TDD, and opioid type. Generally, the subgroups examined showed similar effects of naldemedine 
relative to placebo supporting that the treatment effect can be expected not to vary by subgroup. Only the 
two groups of average TDD (>30 to ≤100) and (>100 to 
 had a size sufficient large enough for 
meaningful comparisons. Thus the study gives no information about subjects receiving high opioid doses.  
There is no/limited data in this cancer patient group for patients who received very high doses of opioid. 
Moreover as naldemedine is likely not to be a non-competitive antagonist, there will be a ceiling effect as 
to  when  the  0.2  mg  dose  no  longer  is  sufficiently  effective.  There  are  only  sufficient  clinical  data  for 
patients treated with up to around 400 mg MED. For doses higher than that the effect is not clear. This is 
sufficiently reflected in the SmPC.  
Other efficacy endpoints: 
In trials V9231 and V9232, all four secondary endpoints were confirmed in the hierarchical testing, i.e. 
treatment with naldemedine resulted in a statistical significant higher increase in the frequency of SBMs 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 148/209 
 
 
 
 
per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of treatment and from baseline to Week 1 both relative to 
placebo, as well as a statistical significant higher increase in the frequency of CSBMs respectively SBMs 
without straining per week from baseline to the last 2 weeks of treatment relative to placebo. Thus the 
effect of treatment is already seen in Week 1 for SBMs, and is seen in the last 2 weeks for both SBMs, 
CSBMs,  and  SBMs  without  straining.  There  was  no  difference  in  use  of  rescue  laxatives  between  the 
groups, so the effect seen on the primary and secondary endpoints is not caused by that. In addition it is 
worth noting that both the pain score and the opioid dose remained stable from baseline throughout the 
study  for  both  treatment  groups  indicating  that  naldemedine  does  not  cross  the  BBB  in  a  clinically 
relevant degree.  
Generally,  the  secondary/exploratory  efficacy  results  support  the  results  on  responder  rates  by 
consistently  showing  better  results  for  naldemedine  compared  to  placebo  in  changes  in  frequency  of 
SBM/CSBM/SBMs without straining/SBMs with BSS of 3 or 4.  
The results on time to onset of action consistently show earlier effect for naldemedine than placebo both 
for cancer and non-cancer trials in support of the primary and other secondary efficacy endpoints.  
PAC-SYM  and  PAC-QOL  questionnaires  are  used 
to  assess 
the  patient’s  experience  on 
constipation-related  symptoms  and  quality  of  life  and  may  add  clinical  relevance  to  the  observed 
treatment  effects.  The  PAC-QOL  questionnaire  is  a  validated  questionnaire  with  which  a  treatment 
response can be measured from a patient’s perspective and experience, which is considered clinically 
relevant  in  case  an  improvement  of  ≥1  point  is  reported.  To  assess  the  effect  size  of  response,  the 
number  of  PAC-QOL  responders  reporting  an  improvement  of  ≥1  versus  baseline  in  treatment  and 
placebo arms should be compared. In present study, average changes were reported per treatment group 
which indicates a numerical change in scores between treatment groups but which does not allow for an 
evaluation  of  the  clinically  relevant  benefit  triggered  by  treatment  in  individual  patients.  In  line  with 
above, PAC-SYM scores can be clinically relevant if properly reported, i.e. as a responder rate. A change 
in  baseline  in  PAC-SYM  score  of  0.8  points  is  considered  to  reflect  a  clinically  relevant  change  in  an 
individual patient. To allow for an appreciation of the PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL scores, the applicant has 
also reported responder rates compared to baseline and associated statistics for PAC-SYM and for the 
PAC-QOL domain dissatisfaction. 
For PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL, the scores were generally significantly improved for naldemedine compared 
to placebo for the non-cancer studies in support of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. For the 
cancer studies though, there was generally no difference between the treatment groups with respect to 
the PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL scores, even though the efficacy in cancer studies appears to be better than 
in the non-cancer studies. The same was true when the responder rates were analysed. With low baseline 
values for the questionnaires, it seems that constipation has little influence on the quality of life for cancer 
patients, and naldemedine does not have a significant effect on quality of life compared to placebo. This 
is probably as expected. However, it is reassuring that in the non-cancer patient studies the effect of 
naldemedine also translates into an increase in quality of life.  
An early onset of the effect of naldemedine on OIC was seen, and the effect was sustained through 12 
weeks. Rescue laxative use was either similar in the groups or more prominent in the placebo group, 
hence can only be diluting the result. In the long-term study V9235, the effect of change from baseline in 
BMs was durable for up to 52 weeks. As similar change from baseline results for BM were seen at week 12 
for V9231 and V9232 as for V9235, this suggests that the treatment effect could be sustainable for up to 
52 weeks. Moreover, similar efficacy results are shown both for subjects on a stable laxative regimen and 
for subjects not on a stable laxative regimen, however less convincing in the last subgroup.  
The treatment effect found in the cancer studies was substantially higher than the treatment effect found 
in the non-cancer studies for all efficacy parameters, apart from PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL. However, the 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 149/209 
 
 
 
 
cancer study was performed in Japanese subjects only, and only included subjects with quite low opioid 
doses. The difference in treatment effect in the cancer vs. the non-cancer studies is most likely due to the 
relatively low opioid doses used in the cancer studies.  
LIR and non-LIR subgroups:  
According to the guideline, if a general claim without specifying the “line of therapy” is aimed at, the 
studies should be powered such that a statistically significant effect is shown in both subgroups (first line 
and those with previously unsuccessful treatment). 
The  laxative  inadequate  response  (LIR)  and  non-LIR  subgroups  were  defined  post-hoc  for  the  trials 
V9231, V9232, V9221, V9235, V9222, and V9236. However, the definition of the LIR subgroup is not in 
accordance with the guideline, which states that a subject “should have confirmed insufficient response to 
laxative treatment with at least two drug substances belonging to different classes used in the treatment 
of constipation by history taking”, however it is reasonable to conclude that naldemedine will be effective 
in LIR as well as non-LIR groups of patients. The non-LIR subgroup in studies V9231 and V9232 cannot be 
considered  a  first  line,  laxative  treatment-naïve  population,  thus  two  additional  groups  of  “virtually 
laxative  naïve”  subjects  have  been  examined.  The  laxative  naïve  to  first  dose  subgroup  consisted  of 
subjects who 1) received no laxatives from 90 days prior to 1 day before the first dose, and 2) used only 
rescue laxatives after the first dose or did not take any laxatives after the first dose. This group consisted 
of only 72 subjects, 35 treated with naldemedine, and 37 treated with placebo. The laxative naïve to 
screening subgroup consisted of subjects who 1) received no laxatives in the 90 days prior to screening, 
and 2) used only rescue laxatives during screening and after Visit 1, or did not take any laxatives. This 
group consisted of 209 subjects treated with naldemedine, and 216 subjects treated with placebo. The 
results for laxative naïve to first dose subgroup and laxative naïve to screening subgroup were treatment 
differences versus placebo of 13.6% respectively 17.3% for the pool of studies V9231 and V9232. For the 
laxative naïve to first dose subgroup with only 72 subjects, the treatment difference was not statistically 
significant, in contrast to the laxative naïve to screening subgroup. However, both groups show clinically 
relevant  treatment  differences  of  naldemedine  relative  to  placebo,  and  the  fact  that  the  effect  is  not 
statistically significant for the laxative naïve to first dose subgroup is likely due to the small group size. 
Thus, generally the results in the laxative naïve subgroups are in line with the overall results showing 
superior efficacy of naldemedine compared to placebo at week 12. Demonstration of efficacy in 12 weeks 
is in accordance with guidelines. However, the effect seems to diminish beyond 12 weeks treatment in the 
laxative naïve subgroups as compared to placebo. This could be a chance finding as the placebo response 
was high. Regardless, strictly laxative naïve patients have not been studied and thus the indication is 
restricted to include patients who have previously used laxatives. It is surprising that the sizes of the LIR 
groups  are  very  different  for  trials  V9231  and  V9232  given  that  the  trials  were  of  identical  design, 
however no reason have been found and it is probably just due to chance  
The LIR and the non-LIR subgroups were defined post-hoc and the individual trials were not powered to 
show  treatment  effect  separately  in  these  subgroups.  However,  for  the  pool  of  the  two  identically 
designed trials, V9231 and V9232, the subgroups were actually large enough to consistently show similar 
statistically  significant  treatment  differences  in  responder  proportions  in  the  LIR  and  the  non-LIR 
subgroups. 
For  the  pool  of  trials  V9231  and  V9232,  the  secondary  efficacy  results  consistently  show  very  similar 
treatment  effects  in  the  LIR  and  non-LIR  subgroups.  Thus  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  for  the 
non-cancer trials the efficacy in the LIR and the non-LIR subgroups appears to be comparable. For the 
cancer trial, V9236, the secondary efficacy results also consistently show similar very similar treatment 
effects, thus are in support of the primary endpoint showing efficacy of naldemedine in both the LIR and 
the non-LIR subgroups.

Supportive studies 
All patients included in the supportive studies were Asian and mean weight in the three studies was 53-55 
kg; thus considerable lower than the average European population. Consequently, in the three studies, 
mean daily MEDe of opioids was also lower; 45-75 mg (median daily opioid dose 45-60 mg) and the range 
across all three studies was 5-720 mg daily. Among all three studies, 27 (14.75%) patients were treated 
with a daily MED ≥120 mg but of note, 47 (25.68%) patients were treated with a daily dose MED <30 mg. 
These opioid doses are considerable lower than what can be expected to be used among European cancer 
and non-cancer chronic pain patients. 
Use of regular- (and rescue-) laxatives (other than naldemedine) during the study period was 70-90%.  
Study  V9237  was  an  extension  study  of  Study  V9236.  Patients  completing  Study  V9236  were  to  be 
continued into Study V9237.  
In  Study  V9237,  treatment  with  naldemedine  improved  PAC-SYM  and  PAC-QOL  scores  compared  to 
baseline. At end-of-trial, mean change from baseline was -0.39 (±0.54) for PAC-SYM score however, the 
effect  had  declined  from  the  beginning  of  the  extension  study  (V9237),  where  the  PAC-SYM  score 
difference  from  baseline  was  -0.91  (±0.56).  This  could  indicate  that  the  effect  diminishes  over  time 
though  this  has  not  been  observed  in  the  long-term  non-cancer  studies.  Change  from  baseline  in 
PAC-QOL remained stable throughout the study and was -0.41 (±0.54) at end-of-trial. At end-of-trial, the 
proportions  of  PAC-SYM  and  PAC-QOL  responders  were  18.5%  and  35.3%,  respectively.  A  possible 
reason for the modest improvement is due to the low baseline scores leaving little room for improvement.  
In Study V9238, the proportion of SBM responders (85.7% at Week 1 and 76.2% at Week 2 [LOCF]) were 
noticeable higher compared with the results from the 12 Weeks pivotal non-cancer studies (47.6-52.5%, 
Studies V9231 and V9232) and also a bit higher than the results from the 2 Weeks pivotal cancer studies 
(71.1–77.6%, Studies V9236 and V9222). The overall change from baseline in PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL 
were stable throughout the observation period (from Week 6) and statistically significant (p<0.0001) but 
somewhat lower than the results in the pivotal studies.  
In Study 9239, the proportion of SBM and CSBM responders (90% [SBM] 50-60% [CSBM], respectively) 
was higher than observed in the 2 Weeks cancer studies (77.6-71.1%, Studies V9222 and V9236) and 
substantially higher than the results from the 12 Weeks pivotal non-cancer studies (47.6-52.5%, Studies 
V9231 and V9232). With regards to PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL score, at end of study (48 weeks treatment), 
the overall change from baseline were stable throughout the observation period (from Week 6), 
statistically significant (p<0.0001 for PAC-SYM and p<0.002 for PAC-QOL) and supports the results 
obtained in the pivotal studies.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In the non-cancer studies, naldemedine has been demonstrated to be more effective than placebo in the 
treatment of opioid induced constipation in subjects with chronic pain. In the cancer study, naldemedine 
was also demonstrated to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of opioid induced constipation 
in subjects with cancer pain, even with a higher treatment effect. However, there is limited information 
regarding  patients  treated  with  >  400  mg  morphine  equivalent,  which  is  reflected  in  the  SmPC. 
Furthermore, in order to get the general claim “treatment of opioid-induced constipation” effect must be 
demonstrated both in the inadequate response to laxatives (LIR) and non-LIR subgroups as well as in 
patients not previously treated with laxatives. The post-hoc defined non-LIR group was not according to 
guideline, but in addition the treatment effect in two groups of virtually laxative naïve subjects was also 
presented  with  similar  results.  Overall  efficacy  and  safety  of  naldemedine  has  been  demonstrated  by 
showing consistent results in both LIR and non-LIR subgroups based on varying definitions of non-LIR. 
Rizmoic Assessment report

Generally, the results in the laxative naïve subgroups are in line with the overall results showing superior 
efficacy of naldemedine compared to placebo at week 12. However, it is noted that strictly laxative naïve 
patients  have  not  been  studied.  Thus  the  indication  is  restricted  to  patients  who  have  used  laxative 
previously.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A clinical programme has been completed comprised of 22 studies: 12 Phase 1 studies; 1 Phase 2a 
single-dose proof-of-concept study in subjects with chronic non-cancer pain, opioid-induced bowel 
dysfunction (OBD), and opioid physical dependence; 6 Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in subjects with 
chronic non-cancer pain and OIC; and 3 Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in subjects with cancer and OIC. 
Safety data were assessed in all studies. Please refer to the tabular overview of clinical studies for a 
further description of the studies.  
Across the naldemedine clinical development programme, 2139 subjects were exposed to naldemedine, 
including 351 healthy subjects or subjects with varying degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, 1452 
subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC, and 336 subjects with cancer and OIC. Of these, 1969 
subjects received naldemedine at a dose of at least 0.2 mg (325 healthy subjects or subjects with varying 
degrees of renal or hepatic impairment, 1364 subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC, and 280 
subjects with cancer and OIC).  
Across the naldemedine Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development programme, 1644 subjects with OIC 
were exposed to daily doses of naldemedine ≥ 0.2 mg, 1364 subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and 
OIC and 280 with cancer and OIC.

The patients included in the cancer and OIC studies had a lower BMI and a lower baseline opioid

Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) reported during the study period (ie, between the first dose and the end of the 
follow-up period [14 or 28 days after the last dose of study drug]) are referred to as treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs).  
Treatment-emergent adverse events have been summarised overall and by MedDRA system organ class 
(SOC) and preferred term (PT). When summarised by event, TEAEs that occurred more than once in the 
same subjects were counted only once. Summaries of TEAEs by investigator assessments of severity and 
of causality have also been produced. The severity of each TEAE was assessed as mild, moderate, or 
severe. When summarised by severity, any TEAE reported at more than one severity level, was 
summarised only once using the highest severity level reported. Any TEAEs that were assessed by the 
investigator as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study drug were considered to be 
treatment-related and were summarised as ADRs. Adverse drug reactions have been summarised by SOC 
and PT, and by SOC, PT and severity. 
An important parameter of treatment with naldemedine that requires thorough assessment is the effect 
of naldemedine in opioid receptors in the brain potentially leading to centrally-mediated opioid withdrawal 
or reversal of the analgesic effect of opioids. To assess the potential for causing centrally-mediated opioid 
withdrawal, AEs were grouped using two approaches: 
1. The number of subjects who were reported to have had at least one TEAE or one ADR of opioid 
withdrawal was identified using the ‘Drug withdrawal’ MedDRA Standardised MedDRA Query (SMQ). 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 159/209 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Subjects who had possible opioid withdrawal, defined as a subject with at least 3 TEAEs or 3 ADRs 
potentially related to opioid withdrawal syndrome on the same day, were identified. These events were 
also assessed by subgroups of events of possible opioid withdrawal with ‘only nongastrointestinal PTs’, 
‘nongastrointestinal + gastrointestinal PTs’, or ‘only gastrointestinal PTs’. The definition of a 
gastrointestinal TEAE or gastrointestinal ADR is an event belonging to the ‘Gastrointestinal Disorders 
SOC’ in MedDRA.

Table 31 Overall Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Global Placebo-controlled Phase 2b 
and Phase 3) – Safety Population 
In subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC, the overall incidence of TEAEs in the global 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 pooled population up to 12 weeks, was generally similar between groups 
across all 3 Phase 3 studies and in the overall pooled population. Adverse drug reactions were reported 
more frequently for subjects in the naldemedine group compared with subjects in the placebo group 
across the Phase 3 studies and in the overall pooled population. Treatment-emergent adverse events 
leading to discontinuation were also reported more frequently for subjects in the naldemedine group 
compared with subjects in the placebo group across the Phase 3 studies and in the overall pooled 
population. 
A similar pattern was seen in the global placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies pool in subjects 
with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC. In Study V9235, there was a higher incidence of TEAEs and SAEs

than in other studies in both treatment groups, reflecting the longer duration of this study. Overall, there 
was a higher incidence of ADRs in the naldemedine group compared with the placebo group with a 
treatment difference of 5.8% (95% CI: 2.6, 8.9). There was also a higher incidence of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation (treatment difference 1.7%, 95% CI: 0.0, 3.4). 
Cancer and OIC 
Table 32 Overall Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (Japan Cancer Phase 2 and Phase 3) 
– Safety Population 
In subjects with cancer and OIC, the overall incidence of TEAEs in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies was 
generally similar between naldemedine groups (66.5% to 82.1%) in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 
2 and Phase 3 studies (V9222 and V9236) and the open-label study (V9237) but was higher than for the 
placebo group (50.0%) in the pooled studies. The difference between naldemedine 0.2 mg and placebo 
was 16.5% (95% CI: 5.6, 27.3). Adverse drug reactions were also reported more frequently for subjects 
in the naldemedine groups compared with subjects in the placebo group in the pooled studies, but at a 
lower incidence in the open-label study.

with ≥5% (Global Placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3) – Safety Population 
In the naldemedine global placebo-controlled Phase 3 pooled population up to 12 weeks, the overall 
incidence of TEAEs was generally similar between groups across all 3 Phase 3 studies separately and in 
the overall pooled population. Incidences of TEAEs by SOC were also generally similar between groups 
across all 3 Phase 3 studies separately and in the overall pooled population, except for the 
Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, in which the incidence of TEAEs was higher in the naldemedine treatment 
group (21.8%) compared with the placebo treatment group (13.9%) in the overall pooled population, 
with a difference between groups of 7.8% (95% CI: 4.8, 10.9). The incidence of TEAEs in the 
Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC was also higher in the naldemedine group than the placebo group in each 
of the individual studies. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs in the global placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3 population was 
generally similar between groups across all 4 studies separately and in the overall pooled population as 
seen in the global placebo-controlled Phase 3 population up to 12 weeks. The incidence of TEAEs was 
higher in the long-term Study V9235 than in other studies (Table 2.7.4 - 19). Incidences of TEAEs by SOC 
were also generally similar between groups across all studies separately and in the overall pooled 
population, except for the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, in which the incidence of TEAEs was higher in 
the naldemedine treatment group (27.3%) compared with the placebo treatment group (19.7%) in the 
overall pooled population, with a difference between groups of 7.7% (95% CI: 4.3, 11.0). The treatment 
difference was similar to that seen in the global Phase 3 population up to 12 weeks (7.8%; 95% CI: 4.8, 
10.9). In the long-term study the incidence of TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC was 32.7% for 
naldemedine 0.2 mg and 25.5% for placebo.

Table 36 Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term 
with ≥5% (Japan Cancer Phase 2 and Phase 3) – Safety Population 
In subjects with cancer and OIC, the overall iidence of TEAEs in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies was 
generally similar between naldemedine groups in the pooled placebo-controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies (V9222 and V9236) and the open-label study (V9237) but was higher than for the placebo group 
in the pooled placebo-controlled studies. In the pooled population of Studies V9222 and V9236, 
incidences of TEAEs by SOC were generally similar between the naldemedine 0.2 mg group and the 
placebo group except for the Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders SOC in which the incidence of TEAEs was 
higher in the naldemedine 0.2 mg treatment group (8.4%) compared with the placebo treatment group 
(2.6%) with a difference between groups of 5.8% (95% CI: 0.7; 10.8) and the Gastrointestinal Disorders 
SOC in which the incidence of TEAEs in the naldemedine treatment group (36.8%) was also higher 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

compared with the placebo treatment group (23.0%) with a difference between groups of 13.7% (95% 
CI: 3.6; 23.9). The difference between groups in the Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders SOC was driven 
by a higher incidence of TEAEs of decreased appetite in the naldemedine groups compared with the 
placebo group. The difference observed between groups in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC was mainly 
driven by a higher incidence of TEAEs of diarrhoea in the naldemedine groups compared with the placebo 
group.  
AEs by severity 
Non-cancer and OIC 
In the global, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies up to 12 weeks, severe TEAEs were reported for 63 
(5.4%) subjects in the naldemedine group and 45 (3.9%) subjects in the placebo group. The specific 
TEAEs most commonly reported as severe were abdominal pain (11 [0.9%] subjects in the naldemedine 
group and 3 [0.3%] subjects in the placebo group) and diarrhoea (7 [0.6%] subjects in the naldemedine 
group and 4 [0.3%] subjects in the placebo group). The only other specific TEAEs reported as severe for 
more than 2 subjects in the overall naldemedine group were headache (4 [0.3%] subjects for 
naldemedine and 3 [0.3%] subjects for placebo), abdominal pain upper (3 [0.3% subjects for 
naldemedine and 1 [0.1%] subjects for placebo), arthralgia (3 [0.3%] subjects for naldemedine and none 
for placebo), and back pain (4 [0.3%] subjects for naldemedine and 3 [0.3%] subjects for placebo). With 
the exception of gastrointestinal TEAEs of abdominal pain and diarrhoea, there was no evidence observed 
for increased severity of TEAEs with naldemedine treatment.  
Overall, there were 23 (2.0%) subjects in the naldemedine group and 15 (1.3%) subjects in the placebo 
group with ADRs that were considered to be severe. The only specific ADRs reported as severe in more 
than 1 subject in the naldemedine group were gastrointestinal ADRs: abdominal pain, abdominal pain 
upper, diarrhoea, and abdominal distension.  
Similar results for severity of TEAEs and ADRs were seen for the global, placebo-controlled Phase 2b and 
Phase 3 studies (including long-term Study V9235) and there was no evidence observed that the severity 
of TEAEs or ADRs increased with long-term treatment. In the overall pooled population, severe TEAEs 
were reported for 101 (8.3%) subjects in the naldemedine group and 89 (7.3%) subjects in the placebo 
group and severe ADRs were reported for 27 (2.2%) subjects in the naldemedine group and 17 (1.4%) 
subjects in the placebo group. The only ADRs reported as severe for more than 1 subject in the pooled 
naldemedine group were gastrointestinal ADRs (abdominal distension, abdominal pain, abdominal pain 
upper, and diarrhoea) and pulmonary embolism (2 [0.2%] subjects in the naldemedine group and no 
subjects in the placebo group). The severe pulmonary embolism ADRs were both SAEs reported in Study 
V9235. One subject who had an SAE of adenocarcinoma which subsequently led to the subject’s death 
experienced a deep vein thrombosis of moderate intensity and a myocardial infarction of severe intensity 
in addition to the pulmonary embolism. Another subject experienced SAEs of pneumonia and pulmonary 
embolism.   
Cancer and OIC 
In the V9222 and V9236 pooled population, severe TEAEs were reported for 9 (16.1%) subjects in the 
naldemedine 0.1 mg group, 28 (18.1%) subjects in the naldemedine 0.2 mg group, 10 (17.9%) subjects 
in the naldemedine 0.4 mg group and 25 (16.4%) subjects in the placebo group. In the open-label Study 
V9237, severe TEAEs were reported for 40 (30.5%) subjects treated with naldemedine. The most 
commonly reported severe TEAEs were consistent with the subject’s underlying medical history of cancer. 
For the pooled population, the specific TEAEs reported as severe in more than 2 subjects in the 
naldemedine 0.2 mg group were anaemia (4 [2.6%] in the naldemedine 0.2 mg group and 3 [2.0%] in 
the placebo group) and white blood cell count decreased (3 [1.9%] in the naldemedine 0.2 mg group and 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

2 [1.3%] in the placebo group). In the open-label Study V9237, TEAEs in the Neoplasms Benign, 
Malignant, and Unspecified SOC were reported as severe for 16 (12.2%) subjects. Other TEAEs reported 
as severe in this study in more than 2 (1.5%) subjects were anaemia (5.3%), decreased appetite (3.1%), 
febrile neutropenia (2.3%), and thrombocytopenia (2.3%). Few ADRs were reported as severe. In the 
V9222 and V9236 pooled population, severe ADRs were reported for 2 (3.6%) subjects in the 
naldemedine 0.1 mg group, 2 (1.3%) subjects in the naldemedine 0.2 mg group, 2 (3.6%) subjects in the 
naldemedine 0.4 mg group and 2 (1.3%) subjects in the placebo group. In the open-label Study V9237, 
severe TEAEs were reported for 1 (0.8%) subject treated with naldemedine. 
Liver events and MACE 
Overall, no safety signals with regard to liver events or MACE were detected for any of the study 
populations. 
Opioid withdrawal 
Non-cancer and OIC 
Table 37 Proportion of Subjects with an Adverse Drug Reaction of Opioid Withdrawal or with Possible 
Opioid Withdrawal While on Treatment (Global Placebo-controlled Phase 3 up to First 12 Weeks) – Safety 
Population 
In the global Phase 3 pooled population up to 12 weeks, the incidence of ADRs of opioid withdrawal was 
generally low across the 3 studies and the overall pooled population. No events were reported in Study 
V9232, while in studies V9231 and V9235, ADRs of opioid withdrawal were reported at a numerically 
higher incidence in the naldemedine group compared with the placebo group. Similarly, in the overall 
pooled population, ADRs of opioid withdrawal were reported with a numerically higher frequency (0.9%) 
in the naldemedine group compared with the placebo group (0.5%).

In the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in subjects with cancer and OIC, no ADRs of opioid withdrawal were 
reported. The incidence of ADRs of possible opioid withdrawal was low, however, all ADRs were identified 
for subjects in the naldemedine groups and no events were identified for subjects in the placebo group. 
For subjects in the naldemedine 0.2 mg group in Studies V9222 and V9236, only 1 event composed of 
gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal PTs was identified. In Study V9237, only 1 event composed of 
nongastrointestinal PTs was identified. 
Gastrointestinal perforation 
There were no events of gastrointestinal perforation reported in the naldemedine clinical program.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs 
Non-Cancer and OIC 
Assessment of the incidence of non-fatal SAEs in the global Phase 3 pooled population up to 12 weeks, did 
not lead to identification of specific safety trends of concern. The overall incidence of SAEs was low and 
similar in both treatment groups.

Deaths 
During the naldemedine clinical programme there were 39 subjects who died. None were considered by 
the investigators to be related to study treatment. In subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC, in 
placebo-controlled studies there were 9 subjects who died (5 treated with naldemedine and 4 treated with 
placebo), and in uncontrolled, open-label, naldemedine studies 1 subject died. In subjects with cancer 
and OIC, in placebo-controlled studies 14 subjects died (7 treated with naldemedine and 7 treated with 
placebo) and in the uncontrolled, open-label study 15 subjects died.

(0.4%) subjects in the naldemedine group and 4 (0.3%) subjects in the placebo group died. One of these 
subjects (Subject 52415-004) was discontinued due to a TEAE but subsequently died so was not counted 
as a death in the disposition table. All TEAEs leading to death were considered not related to the study 
drug by the investigators. 
In the Japanese open-label, uncontrolled studies of naldemedine (Studies V9238 and V9239), 1 subject 
died. This death was not considered to be related to the study drug by the investigator.

In the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in subjects with cancer and OIC, 29 subjects died of whom 22 were 
treated with naldemedine. In the placebo-controlled studies V9222 and V9236, 7 subjects treated with 
naldemedine (2 subjects treated with naldemedine 0.1 mg, 3 subjects treated with naldemedine 0.2 mg, 
and 2 subjects treated with naldemedine 0.4 mg) and 7 subjects treated with placebo died. In Study 
V9222, 7 subjects died, 4 treated with naldemedine (2 subjects treated with naldemedine 0.1 mg and 2 
subjects treated with naldemedine 0.4 mg) and 3 subjects treated with placebo. In Study V9236, 7 
subjects died (3 treated with naldemedine 0.2 mg and 4 treated with placebo). In the open-label 
extension Study V9237, 15 subjects died. All deaths were considered by the investigator not related to 
study treatment. One subject, treated with naldemedine 0.2 mg, died of influenzal pneumonia and 
bacterial pneumonia. All other subjects died due to worsening of their primary disease.

Laboratory findings 
Non-cancer and OIC 
No meaningful changes from baseline over time were observed in either treatment group for any of the 
haematology parameters explored. 
Cancer and OIC 
In the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in subjects with cancer and OIC, no meaningful changes from baseline 
over time were observed in any treatment group for any of the haematology parameters explored.  
Clinical Chemistry 
Non-cancer and OIC 
no meaningful changes from baseline over time were observed in either treatment group for any of the 
chemistry parameters explored.  
The effect of naldemedine on testosterone levels in males and prolactin in all subjects was assessed in the 
naldemedine global placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies. In all 3 Phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, mean 
changes in total and free testosterone in males from baseline to the end of the study (12 weeks or 52 
weeks) in the naldemedine group were small and not meaningfully different from those in the placebo 
group. Similarly, the mean changes in prolactin from baseline to end of study for the naldemedine group 
were small and not meaningfully different from the placebo group in any of the 3 Phase 3 studies, in the 
overall population or in subgroups by gender.  
Cancer and OIC 
No meaningful changes from baseline over time were observed in any treatment group for any of the 
clinical chemistry parameters explored.  
Few subjects had values for chemistry tests meeting predefined limits and in the pooled 
placebo-controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies (V9222 and V9236), results were generally similar for 
naldemedine 0.2 mg and for placebo. 
Mean changes in prolactin from baseline to end of study for the naldemedine group were generally small.  
Urinalysis 
In the global placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies in subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC, no 
meaningful changes from baseline over time were observed in either treatment group for any of the 
urinalysis parameters explored. Similarly in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in subjects with cancer and OIC, 
no meaningful changes from baseline over time were observed in urinalysis parameters. 
Vital signs, Physical examination and Potential effects on QTc interval 
Overall, irrespective of study, study population or length of observation no meaningful changes in vital 
signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure or heart rate) were observed. Likewise, overall no 
meaningful changes in physical examination findings were registered across the studies.  
Overall, no indication of naldemedine having a possible QTc prolonging effect was detected. In the Phase 
1 single-ascending-dose study, no effect of naldemedine on the QTc interval was detected. Likewise, in 
the thorough QTc study investigating 0.2 mg and 1 mg doses no effect of naldemedine on the QTc interval 
was detected. In a Phase 2b dose-finding study, 3 subjects in each of the 0.1 mg and 0.4 mg groups had 
an increase in QTc interval of >30 msec but none had an increase of >60 msec. Among subjects receiving 
0.2 mg, no QTc changes were detected. In the Phase 3 studies, the QTc interval changes registered 
Rizmoic Assessment report

among subjects treated with naldemedine were comparable to those registered among subjects treated 
with placebo.  
Safety in special populations 
Age  
Non-cancer and OIC  
Analyses of subgroups defined by age (< 40, ≥ 40 to < 65, ≥ 65, or ≥ 75 years) did not identify 
meaningful differences in the incidences of TEAEs between subgroups or between treatment groups 
within a subgroup in either the global placebo-controlled Phase 3 population up to 12 weeks or the global 
placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3 population. As for all subjects, the incidence of ADRs was higher 
in the naldemedine group than the placebo group in all subgroups except subjects ≥ 75 years of age.  
Cancer and OIC  
Analyses did not identify meaningful differences in the incidences of TEAEs between age subgroups. In all 
subgroups, the incidence of TEAEs for the pooled studies (V9222 and V9236) was higher in each 
naldemedine group than in the placebo group. Similarly, the incidence of ADRs and the incidence of TEAEs 
in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC and diarrhoea was higher in all naldemedine groups than the 
placebo group in all subgroups.  
Overall, the safety profile of naldemedine did not appear to be meaningfully different in subgroups 
defined by age. 
Sex  
Non-cancer and OIC  
Analyses of subgroups by sex did not identify meaningful differences in the incidences of TEAEs between 
subgroups or between treatment groups within a subgroup in either the global placebo-controlled Phase 
3 population up to 12 weeks or the global placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3 population. As for all 
subjects, the incidence of ADRs and TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC was higher in the 
naldemedine group than the placebo group in both males and females.  
In the analyses of subgroups by sex, across all parameters assessed, female subjects in both groups 
tended to have a higher incidence of TEAEs relative to their male counterparts; however, the differences 
between treatment groups in both subgroups were generally consistent. Overall, the safety profile of 
naldemedine did not appear to be meaningfully different in males and females.  
Cancer and OIC  
Analyses did not identify meaningful differences in the incidences of TEAEs between males and females. 
In both subgroups, the incidence of TEAEs for the pooled studies (V9222 and V9236) was higher in each 
naldemedine group than in the placebo group. Similarly, the incidence of ADRs and the incidence of TEAE 
in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC and diarrhoea was higher in all naldemedine groups than the 
placebo group in both males and females.  
Overall, the safety profile of naldemedine did not appear to be meaningfully different in males and 
females.  
Race  
All studies in subjects with cancer and OIC were performed in Japanese or Korean subjects and so no 
evaluation of the effects of naldemedine in different racial subgroups can be made in this population. 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 176/209 
 
 
 
 
Non-cancer and OIC  
In the analysis of subgroups by race, subgroups other than Black or African American and White were too 
small to conduct a proper assessment and no conclusions could be drawn. For Black or African American 
and White subjects, analyses by subgroup did not identify meaningful differences in the incidences of 
TEAEs between treatment groups within a subgroup in either the global placebo-controlled Phase 3 
population up to 12 weeks or the global placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3 population. As for all 
subjects, the incidence of ADRs and TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC was higher in the 
naldemedine group than the placebo group in both Black or African American and White subgroups.  
In general, subjects of White race in both groups tended to have a higher incidence of TEAEs relative to 
subjects of Black or African American race; however, the differences between treatment groups in both 
subgroups were generally consistent. Overall, the safety profile of naldemedine did not appear to be 
meaningfully different in Black or African American and White subjects.  
Body Mass Index  
The effects of naldemedine were examined in subgroups of subjects with baseline BMI in the following 
categories: < 18.5, ≥ 18.5 to < 25.0, ≥ 25.0 to < 30.0, and ≥ 30 kg/m2.  
Non-cancer and OIC  
In the analyses of subgroups by BMI, the subgroup of subjects with BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 was too small to 
conduct a proper assessment and no conclusions could be drawn.  
In the other subgroups by BMI, analyses did not identify meaningful differences in the incidences of TEAEs 
between subgroups or between treatment groups within a subgroup in either the global 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 population up to 12 weeks or the global placebo-controlled Phase 2b and 
Phase 3 population. As for all subjects, the incidence of ADRs and the incidence of TEAEs in the 
Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC was higher in the naldemedine group than the placebo group in all BMI 
subgroups.  
No meaningful differences in the TEAE measures assessed were observed between subgroups or between 
treatment groups in any of the subgroups. Overall, the safety profile of naldemedine did not appear to be 
meaningfully different in subgroups defined by BMI.  
Cancer and OIC  
In the analyses of subgroups by BMI, the subgroup of subjects with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 was too small to 
conduct a proper assessment and no conclusions could be drawn. 
Analyses did not identify meaningful differences in the incidences of TEAEs between BMI subgroups. In all 
subgroups the incidence of TEAEs for the pooled studies (V9222 and V9236) was higher in each 
naldemedine group than in the placebo group. Similarly, the incidence of ADRs and the incidence of TEAEs 
in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC and diarrhoea was higher in all naldemedine groups than the 
placebo group in all BMI subgroups.  
Overall, the safety profile of naldemedine did not appear to be meaningfully different in subgroups 
defined by BMI.  
Renal Insufficiency  
A dedicated Phase 1 study with naldemedine was conducted in subjects with mild, moderate or severe 
renal impairment, in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring haemodialysis (HD), and in 
healthy control subjects with normal renal function (Study V921B). Pharmacokinetic data from the study 
demonstrated that exposure (AUC) to naldemedine (and nor-naldemedine) in subjects with varying 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 177/209 
 
 
 
 
degrees of renal impairment is not clinically meaningfully different from exposure in subjects with normal 
renal function. The pharmacokinetic (PK) data from this study provides an exposure-based rationale for 
the safe use of naldemedine in subjects with renal impairment without dose adjustment.  
Importantly, in the global Phase 3 pooled population up to 12 weeks in subjects with chronic non-cancer 
pain and OIC, a safety analysis was conducted by subgroups defined by renal function status (based on 
eGFR values obtained at baseline, prior to randomisation). Incidences of TEAEs overall, TEAEs in the 
Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, and specific TEAEs of “abdominal pain”, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting 
in subgroups defined by renal function status (normal, mild renal impairment, moderate renal 
impairment), were generally similar between subgroups and between treatment groups within each of the 
subgroups. The differences between treatment groups across all subgroups in these measures of TEAEs 
were generally consistent with the differences between groups observed for the overall pooled 
population. There were also no important differences between subgroups in the comparative incidences of 
ADRs for naldemedine and placebo, with a higher proportion of subjects reporting ADRs in the 
naldemedine group in each subgroup.  
Hepatic Insufficiency  
A dedicated Phase 1 study with naldemedine was conducted in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B) and healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function (Study 
V921C). Pharmacokinetic data from the study demonstrated that exposure (AUC) to naldemedine (and 
nor-naldemedine) in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment is not clinically meaningfully 
different from exposures in subjects with normal hepatic function. The PK data from this study provide an 
exposure-based rationale for the safe use of naldemedine in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic 
impairment without dose adjustment. The PK of naldemedine has not been evaluated in subjects with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), therefore, naldemedine should be avoided in this 
population.

Table 49 Duration of Treatment Exposure (in Days) by LIR/Non-LIR Subgroups (Studies V9231 and 
V9232) – Safety Population 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were generally consistent across LIR and non-LIR 
subgroups and treatment groups within subgroups for Studies V9231 and V9232. The mean age of 
subjects was 53.4 years in both subgroups. In the LIR subgroup 61.9% were female and 83.3% were 
White and in the non-LIR subgroup 58.1% were female and 76.7% were White. The proportion of subjects 
enrolled in the EU was higher for the LIR subgroup (15.4%) than for the non-LIR subgroup (12.1%). At 
baseline, there were no important differences in the number of subjects in each eGFR category between 
the treatment groups in either the LIR or non-LIR subgroups.  
The average daily dose of opioids at baseline was generally consistent across subgroups and between 
treatment groups. For the LIR subgroup, the average daily dose of opioids was 116.94 mg 
morphine-equivalents for naldemedine and 127.18 mg morphine-equivalents for placebo and for the 
non-LIR subgroup it was 122.23 mg morphine-equivalents for naldemedine and 135.91 mg 
morphine-equivalents for placebo. These average doses were similar to those observed for the population 
overall (124.17 mg morphine-equivalents). The duration of opioid use prior to screening was slightly 
longer for LIR subjects (60.99 months) than for non-LIR subjects (58.78 months) but duration was similar 
for each treatment group within each subgroup. There were no important differences in concomitant 
medication use between LIR and non-LIR subgroups and between treatment groups within subgroups, 
including usage of opioids, CYP3A4 inhibitors, and P-gp inhibitors.

Table 52 Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions by System Organ Class and Preferred Term with ≥1% by

As for the global placebo-controlled Phase 3 population up to 12 weeks, in both LIR and non-LIR 
subgroups in the V9231 and V9232 population, the overall incidence of TEAEs was generally similar 
between treatments in both subgroups. Incidences of TEAEs by SOC were also generally similar between 
treatments in both subgroups, except for the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, in which the incidence of 
TEAEs was higher in the naldemedine treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group in 
both subgroups, with a difference between treatments of 6.8% (95% CI: 0.6, 13.0) in the LIR subgroup 
and 8.9% (95% CI: 2.3, 15.5) in the non-LIR subgroup. 
However, the incidence of the TEAE (in particular GI disorders, abdominal pain and diarrhoea), of the ADR 
(in particular abdominal pain, diarrhoea and hyperhydrosis), AE leading to discontinuation (in particular 
GI disorders, abdominal pain and diarrhoea), and SAE leading to discontinuation was slightly higher in 
naldemedine than in placebo in non-LIR subgroup compared to LIR.

Studies V9222 and V9236, the safety population comprised 257 LIR subjects and 47 non-LIR subjects. 
The safety profiles in LIR and non-LIR subgroups were in generally similar with the profile seen for 
subjects with chronic non-cancer pain and OIC. 
However, the incidence of the TEAE (in particular GI disorders and diarrhoea), of the ADR, and of the AE 
leading to discontinuation was slightly higher in naldemedine than in placebo in non-LIR subgroup 
compared to LIR.

Opioid dose 
Non-cancer and OIC 
The number of subjects in the < 30 mg subgroup was too small to conduct a proper assessment and no 
conclusions could be drawn.  
In the other subgroups by opioid dose, analyses did not identify meaningful differences in the incidences 
of TEAEs between treatment groups within a subgroup in either the global placebo-controlled Phase 3 
Rizmoic Assessment report

population up to 12 weeks or the global placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3 population. As for all 
subjects, the incidence of TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC and specific TEAEs of “abdominal 
pain”, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting was higher in the naldemedine group than the placebo group in all 
opioid dose subgroups.  
Although numerically higher incidences of TEAEs, TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, and 
specific TEAEs of “abdominal pain”, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting were observed in subjects taking 
higher opioid doses compared to those taking lower doses, naldemedine was generally well tolerated 
regardless of the dose of opioid.  
Overall, the safety profile of naldemedine did not appear to be meaningfully different in subgroups 
defined by opioid dose.  
Cancer and OIC 
In the analyses of subgroups by average daily dose of opioid at baseline, the subgroups of subjects with 
doses > 200 to ≤ 400 mg and > 400 mg were too small to conduct a proper assessment and no 
conclusions could be drawn.  
For other subgroups, analyses did not identify meaningful differences in the incidences of TEAEs between 
opioid dose subgroups. In all subgroups, the incidence of TEAEs for the pooled studies (V9222 and V9236) 
was higher in each naldemedine group than in the placebo group. Similarly, the incidence of ADRs and the 
incidence of TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC and of diarrhoea were higher in naldemedine 
groups than the placebo group in all subgroups. 
Overall, the safety profile of naldemedine did not appear to be meaningfully different in subgroups 
defined by opioid dose.  
CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors 
Non-cancer and OIC 
In the global placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3 pooled population, 133 (10.9%) subjects in the 
naldemedine group and 128 (10.4%) subjects in the placebo group were reported to have been taking a 
medication known to be a P-gp inhibitor at some point during the study. One hundred (8.2%) subjects in 
the naldemedine group and 85 (6.9%) subjects in the placebo group were reported to have been taking 
a medication known to be a moderate CYP3A inhibitor at some point during the study. Sixteen (1.3%) 
subjects in the naldemedine group and 18 (1.5%) subjects in the placebo group were reported to have 
been taking a medication known to be a strong CYP3A inhibitor, at some point during the study 
concomitantly with study drug. The number of subjects using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors was very small and 
so conclusions based on this subgroup must be interpreted with caution.  
The incidences of TEAEs in subjects not using inhibitors was lower than in subjects using inhibitors 
(43.9% for naldemedine versus 43.1% for placebo for subjects not using inhibitors, 66.7% for 
naldemedine versus 61.0% for placebo for subjects using P-gp inhibitors, 69.2% for naldemedine versus 
71.6% for placebo for subjects using moderate CYP3A inhibitors, and 100% for naldemedine versus 
54.5% for placebo for subjects using strong CYP3A inhibitors for the global placebo-controlled Phase 3 
population up to 12 weeks). For subjects using P-gp inhibitors and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, no 
meaningful differences in the incidences of TEAEs between treatment groups within a subgroup in either 
the global placebo-controlled Phase 3 population up to 12 weeks or the global placebo-controlled Phase 
2b and Phase 3 population were observed. In subjects using a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, the incidence of 
TEAEs was higher for naldemedine than for placebo.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019

In subgroups of subjects taking a P-gp inhibitor or a moderate CYP3A inhibitor concomitantly with study 
drug, differences between treatment groups in the incidence of TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders 
SOC, and specific TEAEs of “abdominal pain”, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting were generally consistent 
with those observed in subjects not taking these type of medications. In the subgroup of subjects taking 
strong CYP3A inhibitors, larger differences between treatment groups were observed in the incidence of 
TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, and specific TEAEs of abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea 
compared with those in subjects not taking any of these medications. These results are aligned with the 
PK results observed in drug-drug interaction studies and the expected change in the safety profile with 
exposure to higher concentrations of naldemedine. 
Cancer and OIC 
In the pooled population for Studies V9222 and V9236, 4 (7.1%) subjects in the naldemedine 0.1 mg 
group, 11 (7.1%) subjects in the naldemedine 0.2 mg group, 4 (7.1%) subjects in the naldemedine 0.4 
mg group and 3 (2.0%) subjects in the placebo group were reported to have been taking a medication 
known to be a P-gp inhibitor at some point during the study. Five (8.9%) subjects in the naldemedine 0.1 
mg group, 19 (12.3%) subjects in the naldemedine 0.2 mg group, 4 (7.1%) subjects in the naldemedine 
0.4 mg group and 13 (8.6%) subjects in the placebo group were reported to have been taking a 
medication known to be a moderate CYP3A inhibitor at some point during the study. Two (3.6%) subjects 
in the naldemedine 0.1 mg group, 3 (1.9%) subjects in the naldemedine 0.2 mg group, 3 (5.4%) subjects 
in the naldemedine 0.4 mg group and 1 (0.7%) subjects in the placebo group were reported to have been 
taking a medication known to be a strong CYP3A inhibitor, at some point during the study concomitantly 
with study drug. 
In the open-label Study V9237, 7 (5.3%) used P-gp inhibitors, 18 (13.7%) subjects used moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, and 2 (1.5%) subjects used strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at some point during the study 
concomitantly with study drug. The number of subjects using all these inhibitors was very small and so 
conclusions based on these subgroups must be interpreted with caution. The majority of subjects were 
not using any inhibitors.  
No pattern in the incidence of TEAEs was discernible in studies in subjects with cancer and OIC. The 
incidence of TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC and of diarrhoea was numerically greater with 
naldemedine than with placebo for the pooled placebo-controlled studies (V9222 and V9236) for all 
subgroups. For the open-label study (V9237), the incidence of TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders 
SOC and diarrhoea was higher in subjects using no inhibitors than in the other subgroups. Due to the 
small number of subjects using inhibitors in subjects with cancer pain and OIC, it is not possible to draw 
any clear conclusions from these data. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
To date, no cases of naldemedine being administered to pregnant women have been reported. It is 
unknown whether naldemedine or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. No human data on the 
effect of naldemedine on fertility are available. 
Immunological events 
Hypersensitivity 
In the naldemedine programme in studies in chronic non-cancer pain and OIC and cancer and OIC, one 
SADR of hypersensitivity that led to discontinuation was reported for Subject 10602-002 in the 
naldemedine group in Study V9231. No other ADRs of hypersensitivity or drug hypersensitivity were 
reported.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions 
Concomitant use of naldemedine with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, and St John’s wort are expected to decrease the exposure to naldemedine, which may reduce 
the clinical effectiveness and therefore, concomitant use of naldemedine with strong CYP3A inducers is 
not recommended. Concomitant use of naldemedine with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as itraconazole, 
clarithromycin and ketoconazole would be expected to increase the exposure of naldemedine, which may 
increase the risk for ADRs. Therefore, concomitant use with strong, but not moderate, CYP3A inhibitors 
should be avoided. Clinically meaningful drug interactions with P-gp inhibitors are not expected. 
Naldemedine also may be co-administered with gastric-acid reducing agents (H2-receptor blockers, 
proton pump inhibitors, antacids). In vitro studies have shown that there is no clinically relevant effect of 
naldemedine on other co-administered drugs.  
Drug-food interactions 
PK data did not indicate clinically relevant differences when naldemedine were administered under fed 
and fasting conditions. Naldemedine may be administered with or without food.  
Interaction with opioid therapy 
Although numerically higher incidences of TEAEs, TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, and 
specific TEAEs of “abdominal pain”, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting were observed in subjects taking 
higher opioid doses compared to those taking lower doses, naldemedine was generally well tolerated 
regardless of the dose of opioid. Naldemedine was also generally well tolerated regardless of the type of 
opioid. In subjects in the methadone subgroup (which only included 49 [4.2%] subjects in the 
naldemedine group and 55 [4.7%] subjects in the placebo group), higher incidences of TEAEs overall, 
TEAEs in the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, and specific TEAEs of “abdominal pain,” diarrhoea, nausea, 
and vomiting were reported compared with the other subgroups by opioid type, however, these events 
were generally mild to moderate in severity, short in duration and did not lead to discontinuation of study 
drug. Therefore, it is considered that naldemedine can be used without regard to the opioid type or the 
opioid dose. This is supported by preclinical data showing that naldemedine acts as a non-competitive 
antagonist at the μ-opioid receptor due to its slow association and disassociation kinetics, allowing 
naldemedine to maintain the antagonistic effect even when higher concentrations of the opioid are 
present. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Non-cancer and OIC 
In the global Phase 3 pooled population up to 12 weeks, TEAEs leading to discontinuation were 
consistently reported more frequently for subjects in the naldemedine group compared with subjects in 
the placebo group across the 3 studies and in the overall pooled population. In the overall pooled 
population, TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported for 4.8% of subjects in the naldemedine 
group and 2.5% of subjects in the placebo group with a difference between groups of 2.3% (95% CI: 0.8, 
3.8).  
In general, the higher incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the naldemedine group compared 
with the placebo group was mainly due to a higher incidence of TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the 
Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC (37 [3.2%] subjects vs. 12 [1.0%] subjects, respectively; between-group 
difference 2.2%, 95% CI: 1.0, 3.3). In the Gastrointestinal Disorders SOC, the difference between groups 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 185/209 
 
 
 
 
was driven by a higher frequency of TEAEs of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting that led to 
discontinuation.  
Results were generally similar for the global placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3 population including 
the long-term Study V9235.  
The rate of discontinuations with long-term treatment appeared to be generally similar to that observed 
with treatment up to 12 weeks. 
Cancer and OIC 
In the placebo-controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 pooled population, the incidence of TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation was low and similar across naldemedine doses and higher in naldemedine groups than in 
the placebo group. There were 3 (5.4%) subjects in the naldemedine 0.1 mg group, 11 (7.1%) subjects 
in the naldemedine 0.2 mg group, 4 (7.1%) subjects in the naldemedine 0.4 mg group and 2 (1.3%) 
subjects in the placebo group who were reported to have had TEAEs leading to discontinuation. Twelve 
(9.2%) subjects in the open-label Study V9237 had TEAEs leading to discontinuation.  
Post marketing experience 
The Applicant contributes post-marketing data from Japan. From the date of marketing authorisation in 
Japan (7 June 2017) to 31 July, an estimated 4216 patients have been exposed to naldemedine. From 7 
June to 22 September, spontaneous reporting has led to registration of a total of 358 events of AEs, 345 
of which were non-serious. The majority, 337 AEs, belonged to the SOC of GI-disorders. By PT, diarrhoea 
was the most frequently reported AE with 262 cases being registered.  
Further, reports of medication errors have been contributed. The majority of medication errors (44/51 
valid cases) were due to inappropriate prescribing. No post-marketing data from the US are available. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  number  of  included  patients,  the  number  of  exposed  patients,  and  the  pooling  strategy  of  the 
summary of clinical safety is overall considered acceptable.  
Overall,  the  naldemedine-group  and  the  placebo-group  were  comparable  with  regard  to  demographic 
characteristics.  The  non-cancer  and  OIC  population  represents  the  majority  of  the  presumed  target 
population. According to the EMA guideline (EMA/CHMP/336243/2013) this is considered acceptable even 
if  an  indication  in  the  cancer  and  OIC  population  is  applied  for.  Data  from  the  non-cancer  and  OIC 
population  can  to  an  extent  be  extrapolated  to the  cancer  and  OIC  population.  A  prerequisite  for  the 
extrapolation,  according  to  the  guideline  is  that  a  sufficiently  large  subgroup  from  the  studies  in 
non-cancer and OIC patients has been treated with high doses of opioids. Constipation related to opioid 
treatment  is  comparable  irrespective  of  whether  the  pain  is  cause  by  underlying  cancer  or  a 
non-malignant condition. Thus, extrapolation between groups is considered acceptable. 
The proposed indication is to use naldemedine in adult patients with OIC irrespective of the underlying 
disease/state causing the need for opioid treatment. If this underlying disease is malignant disease (a 
cause which has also been included in the registration studies), it is very likely that such patients during 
the progression of their disease will lose weight which may eventually cause them to be underweight. The 
patients included in the cancer and OIC studies indeed have a much lower median BMI (20.2 kg/m2) than 
the  patients  included  in  the  non-cancer  and  OIC  studies (30.3  kg/m2).  However,  the  cancer  and  OIC 
patients  are  few  (n=131  exposed  to  naldemedine)  compared  with  the  non-cancer  and  OIC  patients 
(n=1163 exposed to naldemedine). The observed bodyweight and BMI difference may be due to ethnic 
differences in the populations included rather than a priori skewed inclusion. Further, it appears that no 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 186/209 
 
 
 
 
uniform pattern with regard to treatment difference between active intervention and placebo with regard 
to AEs exists when stratified by BMI groups. A true underlying weight effect would be expected to yield a 
similar AE pattern in both populations. Additionally, the assumption that no clinically meaningful effect of 
weight is present is further supported by the population PK analysis. 
With regard to opioid consumption at baseline, it is striking that the cancer and OIC population has lower 
than anticipated doses of opioids at baseline. This is in contrast to expectations as patients suffering from 
malignant diseases usually have a higher opioid consumption than patients with non-cancer. A similar 
safety  profile  of  naldemedine  when  patients  are  treated  with  similar  doses  of  opioids,  irrespective  of 
whether or not the patients have cancer can be expected. 
With regard to types of cancer represented in the studies of Cancer and OIC, the most common types 
appear represented among study participants. Thus, the study population seems comparable with the 
target population. This is equally the case with regard to concomitant medication in a population with 
malignant disease. 
Irrespective of population and subgroup, naldemedine-treated patients have an increased incidence of 
TEAEs belonging to the SOC of GI Disorders. Given the mechanism of action of naldemedine, it seems 
plausible  that  there  is  a  causal  relationship  between  administration  of  naldemedine  and  GI  AEs.  It  is 
considered reassuring that the majority of these AEs were of mild to moderate severity and that there 
were no GI SAEs. Generally, a dose-response relationship was observed and AEs typically occurred early 
during the course of study.  
Within  the  Cancer  and  OIC  population,  however,  there  was  also  an  increased  incidence  of  TEAEs 
belonging to the SOC of Metabolism and Nutritional Disorders. This was driven by an increased frequency 
of  Decreased  appetite  for  which  a  dose-response  relationship  seemed  indicated  when  pooling  studies 
V9222 and V9236 (NAL 0.1 mg: 5.4%; NAL 0.2 mg: 5.8%; NAL 0.4 mg: 10.7%; PBO: 1.3%). In study 
V9237, the incidence of Decreased appetite was 10.7%. Patients with malignant disease may at baseline 
be at risk of experiencing difficulties maintaining a normal body weight and in the event of Decreased 
appetite,  a  tendency  towards  weight  loss  may  be  augmented.  However,  most  events  of  Decreased 
Appetite were rated of mild severity and only 2 patients discontinued due to this AE. Overall, no apparent 
safety signal regarding Decreased Appetite has been identified. 
Overall, the number of Liver Events and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events was low and comparable 
between naldemedine-treated and placebo-treated patients. No specific safety signal was detected. With 
regard to Opioid Withdrawal Adverse Events, Effect on Centrally Mediated Analgesia and Change in Opioid 
Dose, populations and subgroups were also overall comparable. However, 7/8 patients with Cancer and 
OIC,  who  had  symptoms  of  opioid  withdrawal,  had  non-GI  opioid  withdrawal  symptoms.  A  relevant 
warning  regarding  the  use  of  naldemedine  in  patients  with  disruptions  to  the  blood-brain  barrier  is 
included in section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC.  
Overall, in the non-cancer and OIC population (global placebo-controlled phase 3 up to first 12 weeks), 
with  naldemedine  0.2  mg  compared  to  placebo,  a  slightly  higher  number  of  opioid  withdrawal  (10 
subjects - 0.9% and 6 subjects - 0.5%, respectively) and an higher number of possible opioid withdrawal 
(14 subjects - 1.2% and 3 subjects - 0.3%, respectively) were reported. These trends are confirmed in 
the global placebo-controlled Phase 2b and Phase 3 population (including the long-term Study V9235). In 
cancer and OIC patients however, with naldemedine 0.2 mg compared to placebo, the number of patients 
with opioid withdrawal is similar (0 in both arms), and so for the number of patients with possible opioid 
withdrawal (1 in naldemedine 0.2 mg and 0 in placebo); however, the total number of treated cancer and 
OIC patients was much lower than the total number of treated non-cancer and OIC patients. Particularly, 
it was questioned whether a safety signal was present regarding patients treated with methadone. Based 
on  the  data  presented,  it  is  agreed  that  no  safety  signal  appears  evident  when  comparing  opioid

withdrawal  and  possible  opioid  withdrawal  in  patients  taking  methadone  with  those  who  took  other 
opioids.  However,  “Effect  of  concurrent  methadone  use”  has  been  added  as  an  area  of  missing 
information in the RMP.  
There were no events of  GI perforation and  no reports of overdose in subjects with OIC treated with 
naldemedine  during  the  study.  The  use  of  naldemedine  in  patients  with  known  or  suspected 
gastrointestinal obstruction or patients at increased risk of recurrent obstruction is contraindicated due to 
the  potential  for  gastrointestinal  perforation.  Further,  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  contains  a  warning 
regarding  use  in  patients  with  GI  malignancies  included  in  the  section  regarding  gastrointestinal 
perforation. The potential for drug abuse of naldemedine is considered low, no withdrawal or rebound 
effects were observed, and naldemedine had no impact on the ability to drive or operate machinery or 
impairment of mental ability.  
The incidence of SAEs was overall low and comparable between treatment groups. The indication of a 
dose-response relationship was uncertain and no specific signs of a safety signal were evident. Overall, 39 
patients died during the study. No deaths were considered related to study treatment by the investigators 
and  no  particular  pattern  of  cause  of  death  was  evident.  Deaths  were  balanced  between 
naldemedine-treated and placebo-treated groups in the placebo-controlled studies.  
With regard to Laboratory Findings, no specific observations were made for either haematology, clinical 
chemistry or urinalysis. In particular, no evidence of changes in prolactin levels were observed in the 
Phase 2 and 3 studies, and observations did not indicate that naldemedine has an effect on testosterone 
levels  in  humans.  Vital  signs  and  Physical  examinations  did  not  reveal  meaningful  changes  over  the 
course of the study. There is no available data which indicate that naldemedine causes prolongation of the 
QTc  interval.  It  is  noted  that  matched  concentrations-ECG  data  were  not  available  in  the  global 
placebo-controlled  Phase  3  studies  in  subjects  with  chronic  non-cancer  pain  and  OIC  and  that,  when 
available, ECG and plasma concentration data were not informative for C-QT modelling. 
All  three  opioid  receptor  subtypes  (mu-,  delta-  and  kappa-)  are  present  in  the  heart.  As  such, 
cardio-protective effects of endogenous opioids, particularly related to delta opioid receptors (for which 
naldemedine has receptor antagonist activity) have  been widely studied. Systemic exposure to opioid 
receptor  blockade  could  theoretically  antagonize  an  endogenous  opioid  mediated  cardio-protective 
system. The concern for a potentially increased risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) with 
PAMORAs as a pharmacological class will be addressed through routine pharmacovigilance activities, a 
retrospective cohort study, a post-marketing observational epidemiologic study (requested by the FDA) 
by addition to the RMP that patients at high risk of cardiovascular events were not included in the clinical 
development programme, and by addition of a warning to section 4.4 of the SmPC advising caution in 
patients at high risk of cardiovascular events.  
With regard to Age, Sex, Race, Renal Insufficiency and Hepatic Insufficiency populations and subgroups 
were  overall  comparable  with  no  indication  of  an  increased  incidence  of  AEs  based  on  these 
characteristics.  
With regard to LIR/non-LIR status, the pattern of TEAEs was overall comparable between groups. When 
stratified by LIR/non-LIR, treatment groups were overall comparable with regard to completion of the 
study  and  duration  of  exposure.  However,  in  the  cancer  and  OIC  population,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation was higher in the naldemedine group than in the placebo group in both LIR and 
non-LIR  subgroups.  An  updated  analysis  of  causes  and  severity  of  TEAEs  leading  to  study  treatment 
interruption and study treatment discontinuation has been submitted. This has not yielded any further 
safety signals.

With regard to age, sex, race, region, renal function, average daily dose of opioids, duration of opioid 
treatment  and  concomitant  medication  use  including  usage  of  opioids,  CYP3A4  inhibitors  and  P-gp 
inhibitors,  groups  stratified  by  LIR/non-LIR  were  overall  also  comparable.  With  regard  to  TEAEs  by 
LIR/non-LIR, overall ADRs was registered significantly more often among naldemedine-treated patients 
as compared to placebo-treated non-LIR patients while there was a numerical difference disfavouring 
naldemedine with regard to the same parameter among LIR patients. Further, the pattern of onset of 
TEAEs was similar between subgroups and consistent with that of the overall population. Some minor 
differences were observed but the clinical relevance is questioned.  
There  were  no  meaningful  differences  when  stratified  by  LIR/non-LIR  with  regard  to  chemistry  tests, 
demographic  characteristics.  In  total,  258  patients were  assessed  as  LIR  as  compared  to  47  patients 
assessed  as  non-LIR.  Approximately  50%  in  each  group  were  treated  with  naldemedine.  Overall,  the 
subgroups are considered sufficiently large to permit evaluation. 
By  Average  total  daily  opioid  dose  at  baseline  and  Region,  no  meaningful  differences  appear  evident 
based on the presented documentation. 
Naldemedine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a substrate for P-gp. Section 4.4 of the SmPC appropriately 
contains  a  warning  regarding  concomitant  use  of  naldemedine  and  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  and 
inhibitors.  With  regard  to  drug-food  interactions,  no  significant  changes  in  AUC  were  observed  when 
administration followed a high-fat meal. Regardless of the dose of opioid at baseline, naldemedine was 
generally well tolerated. Further, a warning regarding concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors and 
inducers has been included in the SmPC.  
With regard to fertility, pregnancy and lactation no human data are available. Animal data do not suggest 
an  adverse  effect  on  fertility  and  pregnancy.  Thus,  the  SmPC  appropriately  recommends  only  to  use 
naldemedine during pregnancy if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the 
foetus. However, animal studies indicate that naldemedine is excreted in milk. Based on this, although no 
human data are available, the SmPC states that use of naldemedine in breast-feeding mothers is not 
recommended.  The  Applicant  speculates  that  14  days  would  represent  a  safe  period  between  last 
administration of naldemedine and re-initiation of breast-feeding. This consideration, however, remains 
theoretical.  
Only subjects of Asian origin participated in the cancer and OIC studies. As has been discussed previously, 
the consumption of opioids at baseline of these patients is remarkably low.  
During the naldemedine study program, one event of hypersensitivity was recorded. The narrative of this 
patient reveals that the individual had anamnestic events of hypersensitivity, allergy and anaphylactic 
events.  Thus,  the  individual  seems  predisposed  for  allergic  reactions.  Overall,  the  naldemedine  study 
program indicates a low risk of hypersensitivity associated with naldemedine treatment. In the SmPC, 
hypersensitivity to naldemedine (or excipients) is adequately listed as a contraindication in Section 4.3. 
Further,  hypersensitivity  is  listed  in  Section  4.8  as  an  observed  AE  occurring  with  rare  frequency 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000).  
The majority of AEs leading to discontinuation were considered related to study treatment. Most were 
reported  as  being  of  mild  to  moderate  severity  (although  five  events  of  abdominal  pain  leading  to 
discontinuation were considered severe), most were of short duration and resolved after discontinuation 
of  study  treatment.  Similar  results  were  observed  in  the  Global  Placebo-controlled  Phase  2b  and  3 
Population. TEAEs leading to interruption were specifically analysed and this yielded no specific safety 
signal.  
Post-marketing data from the US are not yet available, but the applicant has provided post-marketing 
data from Japan. These are overall in accordance with expectations based on the safety profile of

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of naldemedine is considered acceptable. Based on the mechanism of action of 
naldemedine, a higher incidence of AEs belonging to the SOC of GI Disorders is in line with expectations.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine 
the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of naldemedine with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture 
of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers naldemedine to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rizmoic (naldemedine) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.

3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is the most common adverse drug reaction (ADR) occurring with the 
chronic use of opioids. With the treatment of naldemedine, the aim is to reverse the opioid induced 
constipation as naldemedine acts as an antagonist at the peripheral μ-, δ-, and κ-opioid receptors.  
The aim of the therapy is to selectively interfere with opioid binding onto µ-opioid receptors in the gut, 
which are responsible for OIC, without interfering with the central analgesic effects of these opioids. 
Naldemedine was developed as a derivative of naltrexone to have a reduced ability to cross the Blood 
Brain Barrier and negligible CNS penetration at the recommended dose.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are a range of medicinal products and approaches currently available for the treatment of OIC.  
Standard laxatives are used as a first line therapy in OIC as they are widely available and often without 
medical prescription. However, many standard laxatives are not effective in treating the constipation 
caused by opioids. Other currently available peripherally-acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORAs) 
include methylnaltrexone bromide (Relistor) and naloxegol (Moventig) which have been approved in the 
EU for the treatment of OIC.  
Relistor (methylnaltrexone) is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation when response 
to laxative therapy has not been sufficient in adult patients, aged 18 years and older. It is administered 
subcutaneously. Moventig (naloxegol) is an oral therapy indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced 
constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s).  
Currently, there is no PAMORA approved in the EU for first line treatment.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
There were four pivotal studies evaluating efficacy and safety of naldemedine 0.2 mg QD on the treatment 
of opioid induced constipation, three in non-cancer pain patients, V9231 (n=547), V9232 (n=553), V9235 
(n=1246), and one in cancer pain patients, V9236 (n=193). All studies were randomised, double-blind, 
and placebo controlled. The cancer pain study only included patients from Japan. The two studies V9231 
and V9232 in non-cancer patients investigated the efficacy of naldemedine over a 12 week treatment 
period, the study in cancer patients investigated the efficacy of naldemedine over a 2 week period, and 
study V9235 investigated the efficacy of naldemedine over a 52 week treatment period.  
Patients in the cancer study, V9236, could enrol in a long-term open label safety follow up study (V9237). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary endpoint SBM response rates 
Non-cancer pain OIC patients 
In all the studies V9231, V9232 and V9236, with SBM responder rates as primary endpoint treatment with 
naldemedine, resulted in a significantly larger proportion of SBM responders than treatment with placebo.  
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 199/209 
 
 
 
 
For the studies V9231 and V9232, SBM responders were defined as at least 3 SBMs/week with at least 1 
SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 out of 12 weeks and at least 3 of the last 4 weeks. The 
treatment differences were 13.0% and 18.9%, respectively.  
Pooled data for the primary efficacy endpoint for studies V9231 and V9232 show a difference of 16% in 
SBM responder rate of  naldemedine 0.2 mg QD over placebo (95% CI 10;22). Similarly, pooled data 
showed a difference of 12% in CSBM responder rate in favour of naldemedine over placebo (95% CI 7; 
17). The long-term study V9235 confirmed the long-term efficacy of naldemedine.  
Subgroup analysis of the treatment effect, including age, gender, opioid dose (low/high), opioid type and 
BMI, overall, show a superior effect, as measured as SBM responder rate, vs placebo. 
Cancer pain OIC patients 
For study V9236 (cancer), SBM responders were defined as at least 3 SBMs/week and an increase in 
frequency  of  SBM  from  baseline  of  at  least  1  SBM/week  during  the  2-week  treatment  period.  The 
treatment  differences  was  36.8%.  Similarly,  a  difference  in  CSBM  responder  rate  in  favour  of 
naldemedine versus placebo of 29% was reported (95% CI 20, 39). Long-term efficacy was shown in a 12 
week follow-up study (V9237). 
LIR/non-LIR subgroup 
The responder rates for naldemedine for both SBM and CSBM were similar in the post-hoc defined LIR and 
non-LIR  subgroups,  and  generally  consistent  with  the  overall  responder  rates.  The  corresponding 
subgroups defined by the applicant (pooled groups from studies V9231 and V9232) are very similar in 
their baseline characteristics, and show almost identical difference in SBM responder rate of treatment vs 
placebo, i.e. 16.2% (95% CI 8.7,23.7) and 15.6% (95% CI 6.4,24.7) for the LIR and non-LIR groups, 
respectively.  For  the  pool  of  the  non-cancer  studies  V9231  and  V9232,  the  efficacy  results  or  the 
secondary  endpoints  consistently  showed  very  similar  treatment  effects  in  both  the  LIR  and  non-LIR 
subgroups. Strictly laxative naïve patients have not been studied. Two groups of virtually laxative naïve 
subjects were defined post hoc consisting of subjects either laxative naïve up to first dose or laxative 
naïve up to screening. For both these groups, the treatment effect of naldemedine compared to placebo 
was clinically relevant at 13.6% and 17.3%, however it was only statistically significant in the last group, 
due to the small size of the first group. 
Treatment failure with standard laxatives is a common problem in OIC, as it is also acknowledged in the 
concerned  EMA  guideline,  which  recommends  to  investigate  medicinal  products  for  OIC  treatment  in 
non-treated patients and laxative inadequate responders.  
PK 
In DDI studies concomitant use of naldemedine with strong CYP3A inducers induced a decrease in 
naldemedine exposure and may reduce the efficacy of naldemedine. Therfore concomitant use with 
strong CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In studies V9235 and V9236, treatment with naldemedine was investigated both as monotherapy and as 
add-on to laxatives. In study V9235, naldemedine, as add-on to laxatives, showed a similar treatment 
effect to the overall treatment effect, whereas for subjects not on a stable laxative regimen, there was a 
clear 12-week effect of naldemedine for all subjects, but no clear evidence of an effect beyond 12 weeks. 
In study V9236, the responder rates in the naldemedine group were similar regardless of laxative use 
(70.8% with laxatives vs. 72.0% without laxatives), but the responder rates in the placebo group differed 
substantially (39.2% with laxatives vs. 18.2% without laxatives); hence the respective treatment effects 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 200/209 
 
 
 
 
were 31.6% with laxatives vs. 53.8% without laxatives. Thus, naldemedine had variable effect according 
to laxative use, but showed superior efficacy in both groups.  
In  studies  V9231  and  V9232,  at  least  4  days  of  diary  entries  related  to  defecation  per  week  were 
necessary in order for that week to be evaluable. Sensitivity analyses performed with the choice of either 
3 or 5 days instead resulted in very similar results.  
In studies V9231, V9232, and V9235, the method for computing number of SBMs/BMs per week implicitly 
assumes that days with diary entry related to defecation are representative of days without diary entry 
related  to  defecation,  which  does  not  seem  to  be  a  reasonable  assumption.  However,  in  subsequent 
analyses where missing entries were regarded as 0 (bowel movements) (and the corresponding week not 
considered non-evaluable in spite of missing entries) naldemedine was consistently statistically superior 
to placebo. Similar results were obtained in a number of sensitivity analyses applying a range of different 
definitions of how to handle missing values (including a worst case scenario where weeks which had any 
number of missing entries of bowel movements were regarded as a non-response week). These additional 
analyses were considered demonstrating the robustness of results.  
The  main  phase  of  the  cancer  pain  OIC  study  was  limited  to  two  weeks  instead  of  4  weeks  as 
recommended in the concerned EMA guideline. However, considering the demonstrated efficacy in the 
non-cancer population and the very strict primary and secondary endpoints the data can be considered 
sufficiently  supportive.  Furthermore  a  12  week  follow  up  study  assessing  safety  and  efficacy  in  this 
patient population was provided. 
Baseline  opioid  levels  in  the  non-cancer  pain  OIC  trials  V9231/V9232  and  cancer  pain  OIC  trials 
V9222/V9236 were not in line with expected ranges based on the concerned EMA guideline. In fact, only 
25% of the Japanese cancer pain OIC patients were on high dose opioids compared with 43% of EU/US 
non-cancer pain patients. Overall, there is limited information regarding the efficacy in patient treated 
with more than 400 morphine-equivalent dose (MED) and thus it is uncertain wether 0.2 mg naldemedine 
would be effective in patients treated with more than 400 mg MED. As naldemedine must be considered 
a competitive antagonist, there is an upper limit of opioids where 0.2 mg naldemedine will no longer be 
effective. This uncertainty has been adequately addressed in the SmPC section 4.2 outlining that there is 
limited experience in patients treated with opioid doses higher thant 400mg morphine equivalent. 
Subgroups 
For the cancer studies, there were only few subjects in the two subgroups with BMI (≥30) and age (<40), 
respectively. Thus, in these subgroups, the treatment effect of naldemedine is uncertain. However, there 
is no reason to expect the treatment effect in these subgroups to differ substantially from the overall 
treatment effect.  
For  the  non-cancer  studies,  treatment  effect  of  naldemedine  was  consistent  across  subgroups  of 
categorised  average  TDD,  however  only  very  few  subjects  received  more  than  400  mg  MED.  For  the 
cancer  studies,  only  two  subgroup  of  average  TDD  (>30  to  ≤100)  and  (>100  to  ≤200)  had  a  size 
sufficient large for meaningful comparisons; thus, the study gives no information about subjects receiving 
high opioid doses. It is, however, reasonable to expect that the effect observed in the non-cancer patients 
treated  with  up  to  400  mg  MED  also  apply  to  cancer  patients.  Overall,  there  is  limited  experience  in 
patients received more than 400 mg MED and this is adequately addressed in the SmPC. 
In  the  Black/African  American  subgroup  of  patients  with  non-cancer  pain  OIC,  the  response  in  the 
naldemedine arm compared to placebo overall is non-existing, mainly because of high placebo response 
in both pivotal trials and an absolute lack of efficacy of naldemedine in this patient subgroup in trial V9132 
(n = 102 and n = 87 for pooled treatment and placebo arms). Further analysis lead to the conclusion that 
this was most probably a chance finding. There is no reason to believe that naldemedine should be less 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 201/209 
 
 
 
 
effective in the Black/African American subgroup of patients considering that presence and function of 
µ-opioid receptors is similar regardless of racial origin, and PK data do not point to differences with the 
White  subgroup  of  patients.  Consequently,  any  mentioning  of  potential  ethnic  differences  is  not 
considered necessary. 
LIR/non-LIR 
The clinical program was not designed to discriminate between LIR and non-LIR patients. To address this 
issue, the applicant defined post-hoc criteria to define LIR and non-LIR patient groups. The definition of 
the  LIR  subgroup  is  not  according  to  the  EMA  guideline,  as  the  clinical  development  program  was 
designed prior to the guideline. The post-hoc definition of the LIR and non-LIR subgroups aimed to align 
with the EMA guideline to the extent possible given the information available. Furthermore, efficacy has 
been demonstrated by showing consistent results in both LIR and non-LIR subgroups based on varying 
definitions  of  non-LIR,  including  two  post-hoc  definitions  of  subjects  who  can  be  considered  to  be 
“virtually” laxative naïve (strictly laxative naïve patients have not been studied). The LIR and the non-LIR 
subgroups were defined post-hoc and the individual trials were not powered to show treatment effect 
separately in these subgroups. However, for the pool of the two identically designed trials, V9231 and 
V9232, the subgroups were large enough to consistently show similar statistically significant treatment 
differences in responder proportions in the LIR and the non-LIR subgroups. Both studies had a 12-week 
treatment period and the  primary endpoint was the proportion of responders as required by the  EMA 
guideline, and the definition of a responder was in-line with the guideline. 
For  the  pool  of  trials  V9231  and  V9232,  the  efficacy  results  on  the  secondary  endpoints  consistently 
showed very similar treatment effects in the LIR and non-LIR subgroups. Thus, it has been demonstrated 
that,  for  the  non-cancer  trials,  the  efficacy  in  the  LIR  and  the  non-LIR  subgroups  appears  to  be 
comparable. For the cancer trial, V9236, the secondary efficacy results also consistently showed very 
similar  treatment  effects,  and,  thus,  are  in  support  of  the  primary  endpoint  showing  efficacy  of 
naldemedine in both the LIR and the non-LIR subgroups. 
Thus is it reasonable to conclude that naldemedine will be effective in LIR as well as non-LIR patients. 
PK 
The effect of moderate inducers (e.g. efavirenz) is not established; therefore, the use of naldemedine 
should cautiously be considered in patients already treated with a moderate inducer (see SmPC sections 
4.4 and 4.5). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Treatment with naldemedine 0.2 mg was generally well tolerated both in subjects with chronic non-cancer 
pain and OIC and subjects with cancer and OIC. 
In  all  populations  and  subgroups,  irrespective  of  definition,  naldemedine-treated  patients  had  an 
increased incidence of TEAEs belonging to the SOC of GI Disorders. This signal was primarily carried by an 
increased incidence of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. These TEAEs are considered to 
be  adequately  addressed  in  the  proposed  SmPC.  Bearing  in  mind  the  mechanism  of  action  of 
naldemedine, it appears plausible that a causal relationship between administration of naldemedine and 
GI  AEs  exists.  The  GI  AEs  were  generally  of  mild  to  moderate  severity  and  there  were  no  GI  SAEs 
registered. Generally, a dose-response relationship was observed and AEs typically occurred early during 
the course of the study.  
Important identified risks of treatment are gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea 
and vomiting) and opioid withdrawal syndrome. Potential important risks of naldemedine (safety issues 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 202/209 
 
 
 
 
reported  with  other  PAMORA)  have  been  identified  as  gastrointestinal  perforation  and  anti-analgesic 
effect due to centrally-mediated opioid receptor antagonism. These risks of treatment are considered to 
be adequately described in the proposed SmPC. 
Based on in vivo DDI results observed with itraconazole (Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf of naldemedine 
increase by 1.12 fold, 2.65 fold, and 2.91 fold respectively), concomitant use with strong CYP3A inhibitors 
should be avoided. If naldemedine is used concommitantly with moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitoring of 
adverse reactions is needed. This recommendation is reflected adequately in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Important  potential  risks  of  treatment  with  naldemedine  include  gastrointestinal  perforation  and 
anti-analgesic effect due to centrally-mediated opioid receptor antagonism. No events of gastrointestinal 
perforation  were  reported  with  naldemedine  during the  study.  However,  this  has  been  observed  with 
other peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists. Naldemedine is contraindicated in patients with 
known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction or patients at increased risk of recurrent obstruction due 
to the potential for gastrointestinal perforation. In addition, the SmPC contains a warning regarding use 
in patients with GI malignancies included in the section regarding gastrointestinal perforation.  
As naldemedine is a µ-receptor antagonist, it has the potential to affect centrally-mediated µ-receptor 
agonist activity. This potential risk is expected only to be of relevance in patients who have disruptions to 
the  blood-brain  barrier  (e.g.  patients  with  primary  brain  malignancies,  CNS  metastases  or  other 
inflammatory conditions). A warning regarding the potential for increased risk of reduced analgesia due to 
centrally-mediated µ-receptor antagonism is included in the SmPC. 
Missing information listed in the RMP includes the following:  
• 
Long-term use (more than 1 year) safety due to the limited duration of the registration studies.  
•  Use in patients with severe renal and hepatic impairment as these were excluded from the clinical 
studies. 
•  Use in children and use in pregnant or breast-feeding women as these were excluded from the 
clinical studies.  
• 
• 
• 
Patients at high risk of cardiovascular events as these were excluded from the clinical studies.  
Patients aged 75 years and older as these were not included in sufficient numbers in the clinical 
studies.  
Effect of concurrent methadone use. This has not been studied independently. However, patients 
treated with methadone were included in the overall study population.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  population  included  in  the  pivotal  studies  represent  patients  with  opioid  induced  obstipation. 
Naldemedine 0.2 mg vs. placebo have shown a clinical relevant increase in the number of spontaneous 
bowl  movements  in  both  cancer  patients  and  non-cancer  patients  treated  with  up  to  400  mg  MED. 
Post-hoc analyses defining the clinical trial population as LIR and non-LIR patients groups have shown 
consistent efficacy in both groups. In addition, analyses of patients who can be considered laxative naïve 
have also shown naldemedine to be effective for a 12 week period. The definition of LIR and non-LIR was 
done post-hoc but the definition was in-line with the guideline. It was done post-hoc as the studies were 
conducted prior to the current guideline being published. However, it is noted that strictly laxative naïve 
patients (patients who never took laxatives for OIC treatment) have not been studied and laxative naive 
Rizmoic Assessment report  
EMA/466/2019  
Page 207/209 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects in the post hoc analyses were defined as a subject who did not use any laxatives from 90 days to 
1 day before first dose, and used only rescue laxatives after first dose or did not use any laxatives after 
first dose). The uncertainty about the treatment effect of naldemedine in patients treated with high opioid 
doses has adequately been addressed in the SmPC with a statement that there is limited experience in 
patients treated with more than 400 mg MED.  
Naldemedine has been studied in both OIC patients with adequate response to laxatives (non-LIR) and in 
patients  with  inadequate  respond  to  laxatives  (LIR).  However,  as  mentioned  strictly  laxative  naïve 
patients have not been studied and thus the indication was amended during the procedure to patients 
who have previously been treated with laxatives.  
The  presented  analyses  of  efficacy  in  LIR  and  non-LIR  patients  indicated  that  naldemedine  has 
statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy across these patient groups.  
The use of naldemedine is, as expected, associated with gastrointestinal adverse events, in particular 
abdominal pain, diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea. However, each of these events affected less than 10% 
of  the  patients  and  most  AEs  were  not  serious.  No  gastrointestinal  perforations  were  seen  with 
naldemedine, however this has been observed with other peripherally-acting µ-opioid receptor antagonist 
(PAMORAs) and could be a class effect. This is adequately addressed in the SmPC and RMP. Only very few 
patients had signs of opioid withdrawal indicating that naldemedine does not cross the blood brain barrier 
to such a degree that it causes clinically relevant symptoms. A warning to use naldemedine with caution 
in patients with a risk of having a compromised blood brain barrier such as patients with brain metastases 
is included in the SmPC.  
Its safety profile in different subgroups (LIR, non-LIR, regardless of sex, BMI, type and dose of opioids) is 
consistent with that observed in the overall population (non-cancer and OIC population and cancer and 
OIC patients). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The data presented indicate that naldemedine has a statistically and clinically significant effect in laxative 
experienced patients with OIC and that the safety profile is considered benign and manageable in this 
population.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rizmoic is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Rizmoic is favourable in the following indication: 
Rizmoic is indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have 
previously been treated with a laxative. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that naldemedine is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

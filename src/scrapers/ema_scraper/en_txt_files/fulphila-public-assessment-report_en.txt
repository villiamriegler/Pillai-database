2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Fulphila is indented to be used for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of 
febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the 
exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
The Applicant claims the authorisation for Fulphila (also referred to as MYL-1401H in this report) as a 
similar product to Neulasta (EU) which was granted a marketing authorisation in the EU on 22 of 
August 2002. The proposed indication for Fulphila is the same as for the reference product Neulasta 
(EU). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and its subsequent infectious complications represent the most 
common dose-limiting toxicity of cancer therapy. Febrile neutropenia, FN, develops in 25% to 40% of 
treatment-naïve patients during common chemotherapy regimens depending on the patient 
population; the dosage, timing and type of chemotherapy used1. The severity of febrile neutropenia 
depends on the dose intensity of the chemotherapy regimen, the patient’s prior history of either 
radiation therapy or use of cytotoxic treatment, and comorbidities.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The principal regulator of physiological granulopoiesis human G-CSF is a glycoprotein that has been 
shown to regulate the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow, mediated via a 
single affinity extracellular receptor. By binding and signalling through granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor receptor (G-CSFR), G-CSF has multiple effects on circulating neutrophils and on neutrophil 
precursors in bone marrow2.  
Stimulation of precursor cell proliferation in the bone marrow leads to an increase in the total mass of 
G-CSFR-expressing cells, which serves as a negative regulator of G-CSF levels through accelerated 
clearance of G-CSF 3.

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a significant dose-limiting toxicity in cancer treatment and a 
major risk factor for infection-related morbidity and mortality. Febrile neutropenia, FN, develops in 
25% to 40% of treatment-naïve patients during common chemotherapy regimens depending on the 
patient population; the dosage, timing and type of chemotherapy used. The occurrence of febrile 
neutropenia often necessitates chemotherapy delays or dose reductions. It may also lengthen hospital 
stay; increase monitoring, diagnostic, and treatment costs; and reduce patient quality of life. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Primary prophylaxis with colony-stimulating factors, CSFs, reduces the frequency of chemotherapy 
induced neutropenia, all-cause mortality during chemotherapy, and need for hospital care e.g. in 
breast cancer4 . The administration of G-CSF can accelerate the development of neutrophils from 
committed progenitors, thereby reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of neutropenia5. Forms 
of G-CSF such as filgrastim and lenograstim including biosimilars, are administered by a course of daily 
injections, whereas pegfilgrastim allows once-per-cycle administration and may avoid suboptimal daily 
dosing.   
The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 2010 guidelines cover use of 
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, G-CSF, to reduce the incidence of chemotherapy-induced febrile 
neutropenia in adult patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and solid tumours. Prophylaxis with a 
CSF is recommended for: 
•  Specified chemotherapy regimens with >20% risk of FN 
•  Specified chemotherapy regimens with 10% to 20% risk of FN, subject to patient specific risk 
factors such as elderly age (≥65 years) and neutrophil count 
• 
Patients with a previous episode of FN  
Pegfilgrastim and filgrastim can accelerate neutrophil recovery, leading to a reduced duration of the 
neutropenic phase in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Filgrastim was initially approved for 
the prevention of infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid 
malignancies receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The pivotal study in patients with small cell 
lung carcinoma receiving cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin chemotherapy demonstrated 
an approximately 50% reduction in the incidence of febrile neutropenia and duration of Grade 4 
neutropenia, as well as statistically significant reductions in the incidence of hospitalizations and IV 
antibiotic usage6. Subsequent indications for filgrastim included engraftment following bone marrow 
transplantation, mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells and engraftment following 
transplantation, induction or consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, and severe 
chronic neutropenia. Because of its relatively short half-life of 3.5 hours, filgrastim is administered 
once daily by SC administration no less than 24 hours after chemotherapy and continuing until 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery within each cycle of treatment. Shortcomings of filgrastim 
include the requirement for either daily visits to the clinic or home injections by the patient during the 
period of administration, frequent ANC monitoring, the possibility of missed doses, and suboptimal 
duration of treatment (either too short or too long). Efforts to overcome these limitations led to the

PEGylation of the G-CSF protein. The subsequent PEGylation of the G-CSF protein filgrastim altered the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, resulting in slower clearance and a prolonged half-life (between 15 and 
80 hours), thus permitting a single injection per cycle of chemotherapy7. Pegylation of filgrastim 
increases the size of filgrastim so that it becomes too large for renal clearance. Due to its high 
molecular weight, pegfilgrastim exhibits limited transport into the blood capillaries after SC 
administration and enters the systemic circulation via an indirect route, through the lymphatics. 
With a long half-life and target-mediated clearance, pegfilgrastim remains in the circulation until the 
bone marrow neutrophil precursors start to come back after chemotherapy. Pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) 
was first authorized for marketing in the EU and US in 2002. 
About the product 
The active substance is a recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with a 
single 20 kDa peg-filgrastim as active substance. This application is based on Article 10(4) of CD 
2001/83/EC (similar to a reference biological product) claiming Fulphila being “biosimilar” to Neulasta 
EU sourced (EU/1/02/227/001-002+004). The reference product is a pegylated (ATC code 
pegfilgrastim: L03AA13) filgrastim (ATC code filgrastim: L03AA02), thus a colony stimulating factor 
(CSF; L03AA). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The current product specific (non-clinical/clinical) guidance document is the document “Biosimilar 
medicinal products containing recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (Annex to guideline 
on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: 
non-clinical and clinical issues), EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005”. This annex has been in effect since 
01/07/2006 whereas the current overarching NfGs (i) Similar biological medicinal products, ii) Similar 
biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-
clinical and clinical issues, iii) Similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived

The product is available in a pre-filled syringe (Type I glass), with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and a 
stainless steel needle with or without an automatic needle guard. 
Fulphila has been developed as biosimilar medicinal product to the reference product Neulasta.  
The name Pegfilgrastim (MYL-1401H) is used to describe the active substance in this application. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Pegfilgrastim active substance (AS) is a conjugate of recombinant methionyl human granulocyte 
colony-stimulating factor (r-met-HuG-CSF; filgrastim), covalently linked to a 20 kDa mono-
methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG).  
Filgrastim is an E.coli-derived non-glycosylated rhG-CSF, consists of 175 amino acids and is identical to 
natural human G-CSF except for the presence of an additional methionine at the N-terminal end, which 
is covalently linked to a single 20 kDa PEG (overall relative molecular mass of approx. 40 kDa). 
Filgrastim has an α-helical structure and contains five cysteine residues, four of which form two intra-
molecular disulphide bonds required to maintain the biologically active conformation of the protein.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured at Biocon Limited, Electronics City, Bangalore, India.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The Pegfilgrastim active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. 
The manufacturing process is a convergent process of the two critical intermediates recombinant 
filgrastim and activated mPEG. 
The upstream process of GCSF manufacture is a high density E. coli cell culture process. The process 
ends with the harvest and cell lysis to gain the inclusion bodies (IB) containing the protein of interest. 
One batch of IBs (corresponding to the harvest of one upstream processing (USP) run) is further 
processed downstream by the purification process starting with thawing and solubilisation of the IBs 
followed by a refolding step and additional chromatographic and filtration purification steps. The 
intermediate is formulated and stored until PEGylation.  
The manufacture and control of the activated mPEG has been adequately described.  
Batches of the intermediate are pooled for PEGylation. The PEGylated GCSF is purified by a series of 
chromatography and filtration steps, including sterile filtration into appropriate containers. A batch 
numbering system is in place and has been described.  
No reprocessing is claimed for AS manufacture. The bulk AS is shipped from the AS manufacturing site 
to the finished product (FP) manufacturing site for processing to finished product. The process has 
been adequately defined and in-process controls (IPCs) described to control the process. 
Control of materials 
G-CSF is expressed in an E.coli expression system.  
The generation of the expression plasmid and the production strain has been described. A synthetic G-
CSF gene has been prepared in order to optimise the codon usage for expression in E.coli.   
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018

Characterisation data of the active substance show that the transcription of the synthetic gene results 
in the desired amino acid sequence. A standard two-tier cell banking system is used (master cell bank- 
MCB and working cell bank-WCB) and cell banks and appropriate stability testing criteria are 
established for cell bank testing. The criteria applied for testing of the current WCB will be applied for 
future testing upon establishment of a new WCB. 
Stability of the expression construct was investigated by generating and testing an end-of-production 
cell bank (EoPCB) and a post-production cell bank (PPCB).  
Information on the raw materials is considered satisfactory. Compendial raw materials are tested in 
accordance with the corresponding monograph. If no compendial monograph is available, in-house 
specifications have been set.  
Some column resins/filters contain specified materials of animal origin. Respective TSE certificates 
have been provided. 
The synthesis of mPEG aldehyde is adequately described. The PEGylation reagent, activated mPEG has 
been classified as an intermediate. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The manufacturing process employs multiple controls to ensure consistent quality of the active 
substance. Critical process steps have been defined during development and process characterisation. 
Before initiation of the process characterisation experiments, a Failure Mode and Effect analysis (FMEA) 
risk assessment was conducted to identify which process parameters could have an impact on product 
quality. These parameters are termed potential critical process parameters (pCPP). Process 
characterisation experiments were performed to identify real CPPs from the list of pCPPs.  
The manufacturing process description is very detailed. Critical and non-critical process parameters 
(PPs) are defined with their acceptable ranges. The classification of the PPs is considered conclusive 
and consistent. 
In-process controls (IPC) and in-process tests (IPT) have been defined to ensure consistent quality of 
the active substance. Acceptance criteria, and relative ranges, have been adequately justified. 
Overall, together with the non-critical PPs and the proposed IPCs and IPTs, the upstream process is 
considered adequately controlled. The composition of the media, feed solutions and buffers are stated. 
The downstream process is considered adequately described and controlled by the proposed in process 
controls and tests.  
G-CSF is considered a critical intermediate. Appropriate tests for identity, purity, content and potency 
are included. Batch analysis and stability data of G-CSF are acceptable. The proposed storage condition 
and time for this intermediate in specified containers is accepted.  
The activated PEG is declared as being manufactured under GMP conditions in compliance with ICH Q7. 
The QP declaration certificate confirming the GMP status is in order. The starting material has been 
defined. The manufacturing process has been elaborated in sufficient detail. All relevant information on 
mPEG-AL and the starting material is provided. 
Release and stability specifications are provided. 
Process validation 
The pegfilgrastim active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. Consistency 
in production has been shown  on an appropriate number of commercial batches. Appropriate protocols 
for the validation of i) the manufacture of the intermediate G-CSF and ii) PEGylation of G-CSF were 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 13/88 
 
 
 
 
provided. All acceptance criteria for the critical operational parameters and likewise acceptance criteria 
for the in-process tests are fulfilled demonstrating that the purification process consistently produces 
active substance of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and in-
process acceptance criteria. Hold periods for process intermediates have been qualified by data on 
physicochemical stability and bioburden for in-process stages and buffer solutions. 
The clearance of process-related impurities (host cell proteins, DNA and other specified impurities) has 
been satisfactorily evaluated and supports the proposed control strategy. Chromatography resin and 
ultrafiltration cartridge lifetimes have been appropriately qualified. Validation also includes details of 
process plant cleaning validation, leachables and extractables evaluation for process plant contact 
materials and finished active substance shipping validation. 
Column re-use is foreseen during the manufacture of G-CSF and the number of cycles is defined based 
on respective re-use validation studies included in the dossier which are considered acceptable. 
Specified membrane re-use is also suitably discussed. 
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process development of pegfilgrastim active substance was initially based on a 
manufacturing process which was then optimised to the commercial process.  
A comparability study has been carried on pre- and post-change batches, and data provided 
demonstrated that the change did not have a significant influence on the quality of the product. 
Comprehensive process characterisation (PC) studies have been performed for the single process steps 
and based on the results the process parameters were classified with respect to their criticality. The 
scaled-down models used for these studies were representative of the at scale manufacturing process. 
Characterisation 
The active substance has been comprehensively characterised by orthogonal methods.  
The Applicant has provided characterisation data on both pegfilgrastim and the protein backbone 
alone, G-CSF.  
The intact molecular mass of the entire molecule was confirmed. The correct attachment of PEG to the 
primary PEGylation site was verified. The mass was within the expected range, substantiating the 
correct attachment of the PEG moiety. The disulphide bond structure of pegfilgrastim was shown to be 
consistent with the expected structure. Overall, the primary sequence of pegylated G-CSF was 
confirmed. 
The apparent molecular weight was also analysed.The secondary and tertiary structure of pegfilgrastim 
was analysed. The size variants were analysed by various methods. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 
was used to determine the binding kinetics to the G-CSF receptor. The results were comparable within 
the batches of pegfilgrastim and to the reference product. The biological activity of pegfilgrastim was 
investigated using the compendial NFS-60 cell proliferation assay. The results were within the 
predefined acceptance criteria and confirm that pegfilgrastim possesses the correct three-dimensional 
structure and exhibits qualitatively and quantitatively the expected biological activity. 
The G-CSF (before the PEGylation step) was characterised with respect to intact mass, primary 
structure, confirmation of the disulphide bonds, higher order structure, and biological activity. 
Qualification data for the potency assay were provided substantiating its suitability. Overall, the 
identity and the expected structure of the G-CSF could be confirmed. 
The PEG moiety was characterised. These data confirm the expected molecular mass and distribution. 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 14/88 
 
 
 
Orthogonal chromatographic methods were applied to analyse purity and impurities. Characterisation 
of the impurities was performed thoroughly with respect to identification of the impurities and their 
stability indicating properties. Size-related variants were identified. The main degradation pathways of 
Pegfilgrastim are dimerisation/ oligomerisation, truncation and Des-PEGylation and oxidation, as 
confirmed by stress studies. Overall, the characterisation of product-related impurities is considered 
comprehensive and the results are consistent across the orthogonal methods. 
Process-related impurities were monitored during manufacture of the consistency batches. The small 
molecule impurities were consistently below the detection level. Data for HCP and DNA were below the 
detection levels. Free PEG was detectable at consistently low levels in the more concentrated AS 
solution. Bacterial endotoxin was below detection level in the finished AS.  
In summary, the characterization is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes test parameters on identity, potency and content, purity, 
impurities, excipients, microbiological safety. The list of parameters is considered comprehensive. The 
active substance release and shelf-life specifications are identical overall (and contain the same 
number of parameters) but differ in the acceptance limits for AS-related impurities.  
Biological activity (potency) of the active substance is determined by parallel line assay using M-NFS-
60 cells. The cells depend on the presence of growth factors like G-CSF for their viability and 
proliferation. The potency assay mimics the functioning of Pegfilgrastim (MYL-1401H) based on the 
purported mechanism of action in vivo. There is a defined concentration range of G-CSF in which a 
linear correlation between the proliferation of the cells when stimulated with growth factor is observed. 
Determination of proliferation is carried out by photometric measurement of absorption observed from 
the reduction of tetrazolium compound (formazan) which produces colour under assay conditions.  
The release specification limits for post peaks by RP-HPLC and HMWP by SE-HPLC were established in 
consideration of the proposed shelf life limits and the rate of degradation observed for these species 
over the proposed shelf life. 
Analytical methods 
The descriptions of non-compendial analytical methods used in the control of the active substance 
have been provided and are found to be acceptable in the level of detail. 
Residual DNA is an in-house method using commercial extraction and quantitative kits. Residual HCP is 
determined by a commercial ELISA kit. Overall, sufficiently detailed information has been provided with 
regard to the validation of the proposed in-house analytical procedures. The analytical methods used 
have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately validated in accordance 
with ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis 
Batch release results have been provided for AS batches, that were included in clinical studies, process 
validation and stability studies. All batches comply with the predefined specification acceptance criteria 
in place at the time of analysis.  
Batch release results have been provided for several batches of AS, that were included in clinical 
studies, process validation and stability studies. The batches were produced at commercial scale. All 
batches comply with the predefined specification acceptance criteria in place at the time of analysis. In 
addition, batch data provided represent the early and final commercial processes. 
Assessment report

Reference materials 
Sufficient details have been provided on the reference standard system established for AS 
manufacture. In-house laboratory standards (internal reference standards, IRS) and certified reference 
materials are used. The currently used primary IRS used for PEG-GCSF potency measurement has 
been adequately qualified. Any secondary IRS will be qualified against the primary IRS in terms of 
potency which is considered adequate.  
Stability 
A suitable 24 months shelf life is proposed for active substance when stored at 2–8oC in Type I glass 
bottles. 
Stability data are provided for several commercial AS batches which have been stored for the proposed 
shelf-life at the proposed long-term storage condition and for a specified period at accelerated 
conditions  which is in accordance with ICH requirements. The stability protocols comprise all AS 
release test parameters and are therefore considered appropriate. Stability-indicating methods have 
been used in investigations. The data provided show that the batches complied with limits in force at 
that time although the specifications have been updated during the study but also with the proposed 
AS specification containing tighter limits for the product-related substances.   
The stability data provided is supportive of the proposed shelf life for active substance stored in the 
proposed packaging. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Fulphila finished product consists of MYL-1401H pegfilgrastim as active substance, D-sorbitol (tonicity 
agent), polysorbate 20 (stabilising agent) and sodium acetate buffer (Buffering agent) is obtained by 
titrating acetic acid and sodium hydroxide.  
Fulphila is supplied in a single-use prefilled syringe (PFS)  containing 0.6 mL of the solution at a 
protein concentration of 10 mg/mL resulting in 6 mg pegfilgrastim per syringe. A specified overfill is 
included to ensure a withdrawal of 0.60 mL. The qualitative composition of Fulphila is the same as that 
of the reference product Neulasta   
All excipients comply with the specifications described in the respective Ph. Eur. monographs.  
It has been confirmed that the excipients used during the production of the medicinal product are not 
of animal origin and all excipients are well known and widely used in pharmaceutical products.  
The intended commercial formulation is the same as that used in clinical trials.Despite identical target 
concentrations with the reference product, various studies were performed during pharmaceutical 
development to further support the proposed final composition of Fulphila. 
Taking all study results together the qualitative and quantitative composition of Fulphila is sufficiently 
justified with regard to finished product stability.  
Adequate characterisation studies were performed on the FP manufacturing process. The acceptable 
ranges of the process parameters were appropriately evaluated with regard to product quality and 
stability Finally, compatibility of all materials of construct used for FP manufacture and product stability 
was confirmed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 16/88 
 
 
 
The finished product is filled into a Ph. Eur. Type I glass PFS closed with a bromobutyl elastomer with a 
Fluorotec coating and fitted with a staked hypodermic needle. The PFS is presented with or without a 
needle guard. Appropriate compatibility studies were also conducted with Fulphila formulation and the 
selected primary packaging system including a thorough evaluation of extractables and leachables. 
Overall it can be concluded that there is no impact of the container closure materials on protein 
stability at the recommended storage conditions. The suitability of the selected container closure 
system and its compatibility with Fulphila FP is satisfactorily demonstrated. Container closure integrity 
test used during stability studies to replace sterility testing and during manufacturing process 
validation was appropriately validated.  
A risk assessment on elemental impurities in Fulphila FP was conducted in line with ICH Q3D. 
Subsequent analysis of FP lots confirmed the absence of metal residues.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Batch release for the finished product is performed at McDermott Laboratories, Malahide Road, Dublin, 
Ireland. 
Batch formula for a representative FP batch is provided. The manufacturing process is depicted in 
detail. The entire manufacturing process is separated in three stages. Stage A includes all steps up to 
the final formulated FP. Stage B comprises filtration and filling. In stage C the filled syringes are 
visually inspected and then assembled with the plunger rod and a needle guard. In addition, the single 
process steps are additionally described along with the in-process controls (IPC)/tests (IPT) performed 
at this stage.  
The process description is satisfactory. The final formulated bulk is controlled for bioburden and 
subsequently sterile filtered.  A major objection was raised during the evaluation procedure with regard 
to the adequacy of some of the controls proposed during this step of the manufacturing process, as 
they would not provide sufficient assurance in the control of sterility of the finished product. The 
Applicant has satisfactorily addressed this point and revised the application accordingly. 
All process parameters applied during manufacture are listed together with their target value and the 
proven acceptable ranges (PAR) as evaluated during pharmaceutical development or process 
validation. The Applicant’s designation to critical and non-critical process parameters is acceptable.  
The maximum hold times are supported by appropriate data generated in hold time studies. 
Manufacturing process validation was performed by the manufacture of an adequate number of 
consecutive FP batches. The process parameters applied during the manufacture were kept within their 
PARs. Overall, the process validation program applied was adequate to evaluate process consistency. 
All parameters checked during manufacture or at release were within the pre-defined ranges and all 
results of the IPCs met the predefined acceptance criteria. The batch release results complied with the 
FP specification acceptance criteria. Hence, the FP manufacturing process can be considered validated.   
Validation of the aseptic conditions during FP filling was demonstrated by media fill runs. Impact of 
shipping on Fulphila stability was adequately studied by various storage and shipping studies 
conducted with AS and FP samples. Evidence was provided that the routine conditions during shipment 
can maintain the desired temperature range.  
Finally, it was demonstrated that the technical properties of the PFS and the product quality 
characteristics are not negatively affected by the assembly process of the PFS with the needle guard. 
The container closure components are purchased pre-sterilised.

Product specification 
The FP specification includes test parameters on identity, potency and content, purity and impurities, 
pharmaceutical properties, microbiological safety, pre-filled syringe functionality and safety device 
testing.  
All acceptance limits are adequately justified.  
The Applicant is recommended to revise the FP shelf-life specification for the parameter  ‘aggregates’, 
as well as for the impurities quantified by RP-HPLC, when data from further batches are available (see 
recommendation). 
Analytical methods 
In-house analytical methods used in the control of finished product are common with those of the 
active substance with the exception of product-specific parameters. Methods are appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The analytical methods are shown to be stability 
indicating. The protocol and the report on method transfer of the potency assay used at the site 
responsible for QC testing on importation into the EU has been provided. 
Batch analysis 
Batch release results of several FP batches are presented, manufactured at commercial scale and 
which were used in clinical studies/ process validation/ stability studies. All results comply with the 
specification acceptance criteria applicable at the time of testing but also comply with the currently 
proposed tighter limits for impurities and product-related substances, and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process. In addition, analysis of FP batches in comparison to Neulasta batches did not 
reveal any new unknown impurities.  
Reference materials 
FP is released against the same reference standards and control materials described for AS. 
Post-Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) 
In preparation for Brexit, the applicant included a PACMP covering the addition of test sites for finished 
product  release  to  ensure  uninterrupted  EU  importation  testing.  No  changes  are  being  made  to  the 
analytical  methods.  The  only  change  being  made  is  to  the  location  of  the  testing  laboratories.  The 
additional  laboratories  all  hold  GMP  Certificates.  The  new  sites  will  be  qualified  according  to  a  pre-
approved method transfer protocol. The data from the analytical method transfer will be submitted as 
a Type IB variation. 
The proposed PACMP is deemed acceptable. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed FP shelf-life in the commercial container system is 36 months when stored at 5±3 °C.   
Stability studies have been initiated in accordance to ICH requirements with Fulphila FP batches at 
commercial scale. Stability-indicating methods have been used in investigations. Stability data at 
recommended storage temperature have been presented for a suitable number of FP lots packaged in 
the proposed container closure system, as well as for process validation batches.    Here, not only 
physicochemical parameters but also functional stability has been tested. No out-of-specification 
results have been reported. Under accelerated conditions, an increase in some of the impurities could 
be observed in the FP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 18/88 
 
 
 
The parameters ‘extractable volume’ and ‘actuation of safety device’ were checked in a separate 
functional stability study. The results obtained so far do not show any impact on extractable volume 
and actuation of the safety device of the PFS.  
Forced degradation studies were performed in the course of analytical comparability evaluation against 
Neulasta.  
These data confirm that Fulphila FP is susceptible to degradation when subject to several stress agents 
(e.g. photo exposure, mechanical stress, acidic and alkaline pH). 
For long-term storage, appropriate instructions are included in the SmPC section 6.4 (‘store in a 
refrigerator (2°C-8°C))’. Moreover, the warning to keep the container in the outer carton is supported 
by the results of the photo-stability study. The SmPC storage instruction that Fulphila may be exposed 
to not more than 30°C for a maximum of 72 hours is supported by stability data.  
Fulphila PFS stability after freezing has been demonstrated with the applicants own data. However, in 
view of a potential impact on container closure integrity freezing of the PFS is not recommended. 
In conclusion, appropriate stability studies on Fulphila FP have been conducted. The claimed FP shelf 
life of 36 months when stored at 2-8°C is supported by sufficient data and is approvable. 
Adventitious agents 
Contract vendors are stated as having been audited and only animal origin-free materials procured for 
cell banking and manufacture of bulk AS. Raw materials are confirmed free of Transmissible 
Spongiform Encephalopathies and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathies and in compliance with the 
Note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via 
human and veterinary medicinal products (EMA/410/01). All have been confirmed as being of yeast or 
vegetable origin. 
TSE certificates provided for materials of biological and non-biological origin used throughout active 
substance and finished product manufacture have been provided 
The control of microbial contamination has been evaluated elsewhere in the dossier. 
Viral adventitious agents are not applicable for the E.coli cell line. Cell banks have been satisfactorily 
evaluated for presence of bacteriophage.  
Biosimilarity 
Overall, the analytical data package comprehensively covers the quality attributes that need to be 
compared for demonstration of analytical similarity. Orthogonal methods have been applied to assess 
the individual parameters.  
The number of batches of EU-sourced Neulasta as well as of Fulphila were considered adequate for the 
analytical comparability analysis. 
The Applicant executed a risk assessment of the critical quality attributes of Neulasta and ranked the 
CQAs according to their potential influence on efficacy and safety of the product. The Applicant 
consequently thoroughly investigated these attributes and the test and reference product were highly 
similar if not identical in this respect. 
Analytical similarity was evaluated based on a straight-forward statistical approach.  
The approach to evaluating comparability by comparing individual data from multiple batches of test 
product with individual data from multiple batches of US and EU reference product is acceptable 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 19/88 
 
 
 
although the statistical approach proposed for acceptance criteria is not accepted as the primary 
measure of comparability – assessment has primarily based comparison on the actual data ranges 
observed.  
The primary sequence has been confirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting (ESI MS) after either Glu-C 
or Trypsin digest. Intact mass and the N-terminal PEGylation were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. The 
results confirm the desired amino acid sequence, PEGylation at the N-terminal methionine and 
similarity of the intact molecular mass.  
SEC-MALS was used as an orthogonal method to determine the molar mass and hydrodynamic radius 
and also polydispersity. The data show a high level of conformity of the products regarding 
polydispersity thus confirming analytical similarity. 
Secondary and higher order structures were investigated by various orthogonal analytical methods. S-
S-bonds could be confirmed by the peptide map, the secondary structure was analysed using far UV 
CD and fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The levels of α-helix, β-sheet, β-turn and 
random coils were comparable between the products within a given method. Levels of free cysteine 
were determined and again, the results were within the predefined acceptance criteria. No considerable 
differences were detected when subjecting the biosimilar and the reference product to near UV CD, 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence spectrometry. The NMR 
spectroscopy was used for a comparative fingerprint analysis only which is considered appropriate 
taking into account the challenges associated with the PEG-moiety. Overall, it can be concluded that 
the biosimilar Fulphila is highly similar to the reference product in terms of primary, secondary and 
tertiary structure.  
This was further confirmed by the data showing similarity with respect to relative potency as measured 
by the compendial NFS-60 cell proliferation assay and with respect to GCSF-receptor affinity as 
measured by surface plasmon resonance.  
The protein content data show that Fulphila meets this requirement for analytical similarity to 
Neulasta. 
Purity and impurities were investigated applying the chromatographic methods used for release, i.e. 
CIEX, RP-HPLC and SE-HPLC. The risk associated with aggregates and dimers was classified as “high” 
due to the potential impact on clinical safety (immunogenicity risk) whereas the Di-PEGylated species 
and deamidated species are considered having a “moderate risk”.  
The aggregates and dimers were analysed by SE-HPLC (aggregates, dimers+Di-PEGylated GCSF), 
analytical ultracentrifugation- AUC (aggregates), SEC-MALS (aggregates) and RP-HPLC (dimers). Di-
PEGylated species were also analysed by CIEX by which they can be separated from the dimers. The 
average level of aggregates is slightly higher in Fulphila compared to Neulasta with two single values 
outside the similarity range. As the amount of Di-PEGylated species is lower than in Neulasta, the 
average sum of HMWPs as measured by SE-HPLC is still below the average sum of HMWPs in Neulasta. 
Taking additionally into account the relatively low absolute level of aggregates found in Fulphila, the 
biosimilarity is not considered impaired by this issue. Aggregates were additionally analysed by CE-
SDS and AUC and the results were consistent among batches showing similarity of biosimilar and 
reference product in this respect, too.  
LMWP include Des-PEG pegfilgrastim and N-terminal truncated species without PEG. SE-HPLC data 
show that the LMWP content determined in the biosimilar product is well below the amount of LMWP in 
Neulasta.  
The RP-HPLC data show slight differences in the profiles of test and reference product. The amount of 
Q108 deamidated pegfilgrastim is slightly higher in Fulphila than in EU-Neulasta. However, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 20/88 
 
 
 
absolute value is still rather low and no impact on safety is expected; thus, this difference is not 
considered precluding biosimilarity. The amount of M138 oxidised species is highly similar in biosimilar 
and reference products. The amount of dimer as measured by RP-HPLC is lower in Fulphila which is in 
agreement with the findings in the SE-HPLC analysis. 
Comparability of biosimilar and reference product in terms of stability has been investigated by forced 
degradation studies under various stress conditions: acidic and alkaline conditions, oxidative stress, 
light exposure, accelerated, temperature stress conditions and mechanical stress by agitation. Even 
though slight differences in the degradation rates occurred, the degradation pathways were the same. 
The Applicant discussed the differences and postulates that the observed differences may be ascribed 
to the different age of the finished products when starting the stress studies and to the non-linear 
kinetics of degradation. Overall, the analytical similarity of MYL-1401H to Neulasta EU is considered 
proven.  
The primary sequence has been confirmed as has the site of PEGylation. Secondary and higher order 
structures were investigated by various orthogonal analytical methods. Overall, it can be concluded 
that the biosimilar MYL-1401H is highly similar to the reference product in terms of primary, secondary 
and tertiary structure. This was further confirmed by the data showing similarity with respect to 
potency. 
Purity and impurities were investigated. High and Low-molecular –weight species were analysed. 
Comparability of biosimilar and reference product in terms of stability has been investigated and no 
particular issues regarding the stability of MYL-1401H arose during DS and DP stability studies. 
The similarity of EU to US-Neulasta is considered sufficiently demonstrated. This is of importance since 
several clinical studies were performed using the US-derived reference product. A summary of the 
biosimilarity studies is shown in Table 1.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The development, characterisation, manufacture and control of MYL-1401H active substance and 
finished product are adequately described, and questions raised during the procedure were adequately 
solved. Analytical similarity of MYL-1401H finished product to the reference product Neulasta (EU) has 
been satisfactorily demonstrated. Likewise, analytical similarity of Neulasta sourced from EU and US 
was proven.  
At D120, a major objection has been raised as EU GMP compliance had not yet been confirmed for the 
finished product manufacturing site Biocon Limited, Plot No. 2-4, Phase IV, Bommasandra-Jigani Link

Road, Bangalore, India. A second major objection had been raised on the control of the FP sterile 
filtration step.  
Both major objections have been satisfactorily solved.   
As regards the finished product specifications, the Applicant is expected to revise the FP shelf-life 
specification for the parameter  “aggregates”, as well as for the impurities quantified by RP-HPLC, 
when data from further batches are available (see recommendation).  
2.2.1.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on TSE safety. 
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the CHMP considers that the 
marketing authorisation application for Fulphila is approvable from the quality point of view.   
Analytical similarity of MYL-1401H finished product to the reference product Neulasta (EU) has been 
satisfactorily demonstrated. Likewise, analytical similarity of Neulasta sourced from EU and US was 
proven. 
Based on the review of the data the CHMP considers that the active substance Pegfilgrastim contained 
in the medicinal product Fulphila is not to be qualified as a new active substance. 
2.2.2.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended additional points for investigation: 
• 
The Applicant is recommended to revise the FP shelf-life specification for the parameter 
“aggregates”, as well as for the impurities quantified by RP-HPLC, when data from further 
batches are available. Revised specification acceptance criteria should then be introduced into 
the finished product shelf life specification via a variation application if appropriate. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The functionality of MYL-1401H was compared to that of EU- and US-Neulasta with two in vitro assays, 
namely with the cell proliferation assay and the binding to target receptor by the SPR method. The 
binding affinity to the G-CSF receptor of MYL-1401H and EU- as well as US-Neulasta was also 
investigated using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The in vitro functionality assays were completed 
by a GLP-compliant in vivo study performed in chemically-induced neutropenic rats. A toxicokinetic 
study was included in the GLP compliant comparative 28 day repeat-dose toxicity study. The 
toxicological program included a single, GLP-compliant 28 day repeat-dose toxicity study in Sprague 
Dawley rats.

M-NFS-60 cells were exposed to MYL-1401H, EU-Neulasta, or US-Neulasta for 44 to 50 hours. 
Proliferation was measured using a spectrophotometer after adding 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-
carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) reagent, which is reduced to a 
soluble formazan product by living cells. The absorbance at 490 nm is proportional to the number of 
live cells. The geometric mean relative potencies ranged from 0.91 to 1.12 with a mean (± SD) of 1.05 
± 0.08 for MYL-1401H, from 0.91 to 1.07 with a mean of 1.00 ± 0.05 for EU-Neulasta, and from 1.03 
to 1.16 with a mean of 1.07 ± 0.04 for US-Neulasta. 
In vivo 
Male CD / Crl:CD(SD) rats (10 animals per group) were treated once subcutaneously with MYL-1401H, 
EU-  or  US-Neulasta  at  dose  levels  of  100,  300,  1000  and  3000  mg/kg  on  12  consecutive  days.  The

The applicant did not submit single dose toxicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The applicant provided data from one comparative in vivo study in rats (Study TOX-071-001). MYL-
1401H was administered subcutaneously once weekly at 0.15 mg/kg (low dose), 0.65 mg/kg (mid 
dose), and 1.5 mg/kg (high dose and high-dose recovery) to male and female Sprague Dawley rats 
for 28 days. These doses were equivalent to approximately 0.24, 1.05, and 2.43 times (respectively) 
the intended dose in humans (6 mg/chemotherapy cycle) based on body surface area. Animals in the 
recovery groups received no treatment for an additional 14 days after the 28-day treatment period. 
Parameters 
Main findings 
Pharmacodynamic 
Neutrophil  counts  increased  in  a  dose-proportionate  manner  with  both  MYL-1401H  and 
effect 
EU-Neulasta. Dose-proportionate changes to red blood cells, reticulocytes, lymphocytes, 
monocytes,  eosinophils,  and  basophils  were  also  seen  for  both  MYL-1401H−  and  EU-
Neulasta−treated  animals.  However,  these  changes  were  not  of  the  magnitude  of  the 
neutrophil counts. 
Injection site effects  At the injection sites, minimal fasciitis/fibrosis and occasional hemorrhage were recorded 
in  animals  administered  MYL-1401H,  animals  administered  EU-Neulasta,  and  in  the 
controls.  
Immunogenicity 
No assessment of anti-drug antibody formation (binding and neutralizing capacity) of the 
test or reference product was performed. No significant differences in toxicokinetics were 
observed,  anaphylactic  reactions  were  absent,  and  the  expected  increases  in 
pharmacodynamic markers were observed. Therefore, there was no indication that anti-
drug antibody was present. 
Mortality 
and 
There  was  1  mortality  during  the  study,  at  Day  28.  A  female  in  the  high  dose  EU-
clinical signs 
Neulasta group was removed from the study due to clinical signs related to granulocytic 
leukemia characterized by a widespread, diffusely  invasive proliferation of granulocytes 
(myeloid  cells)  in  the  spleen,  bone  marrow,  and  multiple  other  organs,  including  non-
hematopoietic tissues.  
The following observations seen were across several dose groups in one or both sexes, 
with  no  apparent  dose  response.  Several  male  animals  across  all  dose  groups  (except 
Group  4)  had  hair  loss,  sores,  or  lesions  to  their  neck,  while  several  female  animals 
across all dose groups showed signs of thinning neck fur and red staining to the neck.

comparable across all dose groups. 
Hematology 
Dose-proportional increases in white blood cell counts (in particular, absolute neutrophil 
counts)  were  seen  in  all  MYL-1401H-  and  EU-Neulasta-treated  animals.  In  males 
receiving 1.5 mg/kg MYL-1401H or EU-Neulasta, maximal neutrophil counts were 80.45 
and  73.68  ×  109/L,  respectively,  and  occurred  48  hours  post  dose  (Day  22 
administration) on Day 24. In females receiving 1.5 mg/kg MYL-1401H or EU-Neulasta, 
maximal  neutrophil  counts  of  50.96  and  53.54  ×  109/L,  respectively,  were  seen  at  72 
hours  post  dose  (Day  22  administration)  on  Day  25.  Additionally,  there  were  smaller 
dose-proportional  statistical  changes  (ANOVA  and  Dunnet’s;  P≤ 0.001  to  0.05)  in 
numbers  of  red  blood  cells,  reticulocytes,  lymphocytes,  monocytes,  eosinophils,  and 
basophils in both MYL-1401H- and EU-Neulasta-treated animals. 
There  were  no  other  statistically  significant  (P≤ 0.05)  treatment-related  changes  in 
hemoglobin,  packed  cell  volume,  mean  cell  volume,  mean  cell  hemoglobin,  mean  cell 
hemoglobin  concentration,  red  cell  distribution  width,  hemoglobin  distribution  width, 
total and differential white cell count, platelet count, plateletcrit, mean platelet volume, 
platelet distribution width, or coagulation (prothrombin time). 
Clinical chemistry 
Alkaline phosphatase levels increased in treated males and females in a dose-dependent 
manner.  Similar  increases  were  seen  with  MYL-1401H  and  EU-Neulasta.  Males  given 
0.15  mg/kg  MYL-1401H  or  EU-Neulasta  showed  comparable  levels  of  alkaline 
phosphatase  elevation  above  control;  approximately  2.4  and  2.3  times  higher, 
respectively.  Similarly,  males  given  1.5  mg/kg  MYL-1401H  or  EU-Neulasta  showed 
elevation  of  alkaline  phosphatase  approximately  5  times  higher  than  males  given 
placebo  (controls).  Females  showed  a  comparable  trend,  with  elevation  of  alkaline 
phosphatase  in  animals  given  0.15  mg/kg or 1.5  mg/kg  MYL-1401H  or  EU-Neulasta  (3 
and 5 times, respectively, the level of controls). 
No statistically significant (P≤ 0.05) changes in other clinical chemistry parameters were 
observed following treatment with either MYL-1401H or EU-Neulasta, including aspartate 
aminotransferase,  alanine  aminotransferase,  alkaline  phosphatase,  total  cholesterol, 
total  bilirubin,  total  protein,  albumin,  globulin,  albumin/globulin  ratio,  sodium, 
potassium, chloride, calcium, inorganic phosphate, creatinine, urea, and glucose. 
Urinalysis 
No  treatment-related  differences  from  control  were  seen  for  volume,  color,  turbidity, 
specific  gravity,  pH,  protein,  glucose,  ketones,  urobilinogen,  bilirubin,  blood,  and 
microscopic observation of sediment.  
Organ  weights  and 
Group mean spleen weights (adjusted for terminal body weight) were increased by 46%, 
organ weight ratios 
80%, and 115% in males and 33%, 54%, and 77% in females given 0.15, 0.65, or 1.5 
mg/kg  MYL-1401H,  respectively,  compared  with  those  in  males  and  females  given 
placebo (controls). Similar increases were observed in animals given EU-Neulasta; group 
mean  spleen  weights  (adjusted  for  terminal  body  weight)  were  increased  by  44%  and 
116% in males and 8% and 67% in females given 0.15 or 1.5 mg/kg EU-Neulasta. 
Gross pathology 
Large  spleen  was  recorded  for  most  animals  given  0.65  or  1.5  mg/kg  MYL-1401H  and 
for most animals given 1.5 mg/kg EU-Neulasta. These findings correlated with increased 
spleen weight at necropsy. There were no other macroscopic findings considered related 
to test article administration. Other tissues were either macroscopically unremarkable or 
the findings were typical for animals of this strain and age. 
Histopathology 
Histopathological changes attributable to test article administration were observed in the

bone marrow, spleen, and liver. Microscopic findings in other tissues and at the injection 
site were generally infrequent, minor, and typical for animals of this strain and age. 
Increased  granulopoiesis  was  seen  in  the  bone  marrow  of  the  femur  and  sternum,  in 
animals  given  1.5  mg/kg  MYL-1401H  or  EU-Neulasta.  This  was  characterized  by 
increased  cellularity  and  decreased basophilia  of  the  bone marrow  due  to  an  increased 
proportion of white cell precursors. This was also associated with a reduction in marrow 
fat spaces. In the spleen, an increase in the severity of hematopoiesis was recorded for 
animals  given  1.5  mg/kg  MYL-1401H  or  EU-Neulasta.  This  was  characterized  by 
increased  hematopoietic  cells  in  the  red  pulp  and  correlated  with  large  spleen  visible 
macroscopically. 
In the liver, an increase in the incidence and severity of hematopoiesis was recorded for 
animals  given  1.5  mg/kg  MYL-1401H or  EU-Neulasta.  Hematopoiesis  was  characterized 
by  foci  of  predominantly  myeloid  cells  in  the  periportal  areas  and  in  the  liver 
parenchyma  with  small 
foci  of  hyperchromatic  erythroid  cells  and  occasional 
megakaryocytes also in the liver parenchyma.

The applicant did not submit genotoxicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Carcinogenicity 
The applicant did not submit carcinogenicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The applicant did not submit reproduction toxicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic and statistical analysis for MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta were performed and included: 
AUC0-t:  Area  under  the  concentration-time  curve  from  hour  0  to  the  last  measurable  concentration, 
estimated by the log/linear trapezoidal rule 
Cmax: Maximum observed concentration from the concentration/time graphs 
t max: Time of maximum concentration from the concentration/time profile 
Other  parameters,  including  dose  normalized  Cmax  (Cmax/D)  and  AUC0-t  (AUC0-t/D),  area  under  the 
concentration-time  curve  extrapolated  to  infinity  (AUC0-∞),  terminal  plasma  half-life  (t1/2),  and 
accumulation ratios based on Cmax (RACmax) and AUC (RAAUC). 
Blood  samples  for  toxicokinetics  (1  mL  nominal)  were  taken  from  all  toxicokinetic  animals  on  Day  1 
and Week 4 at pre-dose, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 hours after dosing.

The NOAEL was considered to be 1.5 mg/kg in male and female rats for both MYL-1401H and EU-
Neulasta in this study. This dose is equivalent to approximately 2.4 times the intended therapeutic 
dose in humans (6 mg/chemotherapy cycle) based on body surface area. 
Local Tolerance  
Comparative local tolerance assessments between MYL-1401H, EU-Neulasta, and US-Neulasta were 
made in the in vivo pharmacodynamic study and in the repeat-dose toxicity study. No injection site 
reactions were observed in the pharmacodynamic study. In the toxicity study, minimal fasciitis/fibrosis 
and occasional hemorrhage were observed. 
Other toxicity studies 
The applicant did not submit reproduction toxicity studies (see non-clinical discussion). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant provided a justification for waiving ERA studies in accordance with the guideline on the 
environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  Corr 
2).  
It  is  considered  that  Fulphila  will  not  pose  any  greater  risk  to  the  environment  than  Neulasta. 
Pegfilgrastim  is  extensively  metabolised  in  man  and  predicted  to  be  rapidly  biodegraded  in  the 
environment.  Furthermore,  it  is  considered  that  Fulphila  will  replace  other  similar  pegfilgrastim 
products  on  the  market.  Hence,  it  is  expected  that  the  total  amount  of  pegfilgrastim  will  not  be 
substantially  increased  and  no  additional  environmental  burden  is  envisaged.  Furthermore,  proteins 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 32/88 
 
 
 
 
and peptides are excluded from the need for an environmental risk assessment in accordance with the 
respective guideline.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
MYL-1401H  was  developed  as  a  biosimilar  biological  medicine  to  Neulasta.  As  such,  according  to  the 
guideline  EMEA/CHMP/42832/05,  a  reduced  preclinical  program  is  acceptable  in  order  to  show 
comparability  of  test  and  reference  product.  Mylan  provided  comparative  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
pharmacodynamic studies as well as one comparative 28 day repeat dose toxicity study in neutropenic 
rats.  
The  in  vitro  cell  based  proliferation  assay  using  the  murine  NFS  60  cell  line  demonstrated  similar 
relative  potencies.  The  binding  activity  using  receptor-binding  Surface  Plasmon  Resonance  showed 
comparable  binding  characteristics  for  Association  rate  constant,  Dissociation  rate  constant  and 
Equilibrium dissociation constant. Pharmacodynamic responses of the in vivo study showed comparable 
number of leucocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes with higher values of MYL-1401H compared to the 
reference product (EU-Neulasta). 
The toxicological profile of MYL-1401H in comparison to EU-Neulasta was evaluated in a 28-day repeat 
dose  toxicity  study  in  rats.  This  study  included  toxicokinetic  analysis.  Dose-proportional  increases  in 
mean maximal concentration exposures and comparable half-lives were seen with both products. Minor 
gender  differences  were  observed,  with  males  having  higher  exposure  levels  than  females.  As 
expected,  neutrophil  counts  increased  in  a  dose-proportional  manner  across  all  treated  groups. 
Expected and treatment related increases in spleen weight as well as elevated and comparable alkaline 
phosphatase  levels  were observed.  Splenomegaly  is an  expected  finding  of  pegfilgrastim  therapy  and 
therefore  a  known  adverse  effect.  The  toxicokinetic  data  from  this  study  showed  comparability 
between doses of 0.15 and 1.5 mg/kg Myl-1401H and EU-Neulasta with the exception of the low dose 
in males, where systemic exposure to MYL-1401H was notably lower than EU-Neulasta, suggesting that 
there may be a gender difference. However, the gender difference may be a chance findings and is not 
considered relevant. 
According to the guideline EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005 as well as the concept paper published on 
27/07/2015, studies on single dose toxicity, reproduction, genotoxic, carcinogenic potential are not 
required for the development of biosimilar G-CSF products. 
A justification for waiving ERA studies had been provided. This is considered acceptable, given that the 
active substance pegfilgrastim is a polypeptide which is exempted from an ERA as per guideline on the 
environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  Corr 
2). Pegfilgrastim is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and toxicology for Fulphila have been well 
characterised and are considered acceptable. There were no further changes to the SmPC and the 
product information is aligned with the reference product Neulasta.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
The pivotal cross-over PK/PD study MYL-1401H-1001 investigated single 2 mg doses of MYL-1401H, 
EU- and US-Neulasta (0.2 mL of 10 mg/mL dose strengths based on protein content with all 3 drug 
products being transferred into identical 0.3-mL syringes), whereas the parallel-design study 1002 
used single 6 mg doses and primarily investigated immunogenicity in healthy subjects. 
Also in trial MYL-1401H-1002 concentrations of the analyte PEG GCSF were determined but analysed 
only descriptively (for the means of the primary objective of this trial immunogenicity). 
Thus, trial MYL-1401H- 1001 is the pivotal BE (and equivalent PD) study of this application: 
Trial MYL-1401H-1001 was a single centre, randomized, double-blind, 3-period, 3 treatments, 3-way 
crossover trial to evaluate the PD, PK, safety and tolerability of pegfilgrastim from a test product (MYL-
1401H) compared to reference products EU- and US-Neulasta in 216 healthy volunteers intended to be 
in accordance with EU and US biosimilar guidelines. 
After randomization to one of six possible treatment sequences, subjects were administered MYL-
1401H or one of two reference products in Period 1. After the 1st crossover, subjects received one of 
the remaining alternate treatments in Period 2. 
After the 2nd crossover, subjects received the other alternate treatment in Period 3. The washout 
between drug administrations was at least 4 weeks.

Figure 1:  
Overview of Study Design MYL-1401H-1001 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria can be briefly summarized as selecting for healthy adults (18-65 
years of age) of both genders. Specific for the scope of the trial are only the two exclusion criteria: 
•  Known history of previous exposure to filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, GCSF or any analogue of 
these. 
•  Hypersensitivity to the constituents of Neulasta (sorbitol E420, polysorbate 20 and acetate or 
acetic acid) or hypersensitivity to E. coli derived proteins. 
Methods 
• 
ELISA Assay for the Quantitation of MYL-1401H/Neulasta in Human Serum (has been 
satisfactorily validated and considered suitable for its intended use) 
•  Neutrophils and CD34+ cells were counted via flow cytometry (Validation reports have not 
been submitted. Flow cytometry is considered a standard approach so that validation of this 
method is not needed for this application) 
•  Analysis of Normal Human Serum Samples for detection of Anti-Drug Antibodies against MYL- 
1401H and Neulasta (EU and US) to support Phase 1 Clinical Study (MYL-1401H-1001) using 
the Mesoscale Discovery Platform 
•  Cell-Based Assay to Detect Neutralizing Antibodies (NAb) Against MYL-1401H and Neulasta (EU 
and US) in Normal Human Serum. 
Pharmacokinetic Measurements 
At the time points defined blood samples of 2.5 m each were taken for the analysis of PEG-GCSF 
concentration in serum samples.  
Pharmacodynamic Measurements 
At the time points defined, blood samples of 3 mL each were taken for the analysis of ANC and CD34+.  
Both ANC and CD34+ cell count was determined with flow cytometry by the clinical safety laboratory of 
the centre. 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018

Safety and Tolerability Measurements 
Safety and tolerability assessments consisted of AEs, clinical laboratory, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, local 
tolerability, physical examination and immunogenicity and were performed as scheduled. 
Primary PK Parameters 
The primary PK parameters to be determined or calculated from the serum-concentration time data for 
PEG-GCSF were: 
- Cmax = Observed maximum serum concentration 
- AUC0-inf = Area under the serum concentration-time curve (time 0 to infinity) 
Bioequivalence was to be concluded if the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means of two treatments 
falls completely within the limits of 0.8000-1.2500 for the primary PK parameters. 
Secondary PK Parameters 
The secondary PK parameters to be determined or calculated from the serum-concentration time data 
for PEG-GCSF were: 
- AUC0-t = Area under the concentration-time curve (time 0 to time of last quantifiable concentration) 
- Tmax = Time to attain maximum serum concentration 
- kel = Terminal elimination rate constant 
- t1/2 = Apparent terminal elimination half-life 
- Vd/F = Apparent volume of distribution 
An additional PK parameter to be determined or calculated from the serum-concentration time data for 
PEG-GCSF was: 
- %AUCextra = Percentage of estimated part for the calculation of AUC0-inf of serum PEG-GCSF: 
([AUC0-inf - AUC0-t]/AUC0-inf)*100%. 
The chosen PK parameters are standard parameters for BE trials and accepted for demonstration of 
similar PK profiles of two pegfilgrastims. 
Primary PD Parameters 
The primary PD parameters to be determined or calculated from the cell count-time data for ANC 
were: 
- ANC AUC0-t = Area under the ANC above baseline values versus time curve (time 0 to time of last 
data collection point) 
– ANC Cmax = Maximum change from baseline for ANC* 
* ANC Cmax was changed from secondary PD parameter to primary PD parameter after completion of 
the study, as documented in CSP Version 3.0. 
Equivalence was to be concluded if the 95% CI for the ratio of geometric means of two treatments fell 
completely within the limits of 0.8500-1.1765 for the primary PD parameters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 37/88 
 
 
 
Secondary PD Parameters 
The secondary PD parameter to be determined or calculated from the cell count-time data for ANC 
was: 
– ANC Tmax = Time of maximum change from baseline for ANC 
The secondary PD parameters to be determined or calculated from the cell count-time data for CD34+ 
cell counts were: 
- CD34+ AUC0-t = Area under the CD34+ cell counts above baseline versus time curve 
– CD34+ Cmax = Maximum change from baseline for CD34+ cell counts 
– CD34+ Tmax = Time of maximum change from baseline 
The choice of the primary and secondary PD parameters is in line with the respective guideline and 
acceptable. 
Determination of Sample Size 
The actual sample size of 216 healthy volunteers was based on the following assumptions laid down in 
the protocol: 
- 
Intrasubject variability from the MYL-PER-0001 pilot study118: 
•  ANC AUC0-t = 14% 
• 
• 
PEG-GCSF AUC0-t and AUC0-inf = 36% 
PEG-GCSF Cmax = 50% 
-  ANC AUC0-t: 
•  95% CI 
• 
• 
equivalence range [0.8500-1.1765] 
ratio of geometric means in interval [0.95-1.05] 
-  PEG-GCSF AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax 
•  90% CI 
• 
• 
equivalence range [0.8000-1.2500] 
ratio of geometric means in interval [0.95-1.05] 
It was estimated that with 180 evaluable subjects the study will have a combined power for PD and PK 
of over 90% to establish equivalence for each of the 3 pairwise comparisons. 
According to the applicant, the sample size estimation was not literature derived but was based on a 
pilot study with Neulasta.

372 subjects were screened and 216 subjects were included in the study. All of these 216 subjects 
were randomized and received at least one dose of 2 mg pegfilgrastim. The doses of pegfilgrastim 
were administered at least 4 weeks apart. All 216 subjects were included in the safety analysis set. 
Twenty subjects discontinued the study for the following reasons: 
8 subjects were withdrawn because of a protocol violation (tested positive for cannabinoids and 
cocaine; inability to follow protocol instructions). 
8 subjects withdrew consent for personal reasons. 
3 subjects were withdrawn due to AEs (1 SAE). 
1 subject dropped out after dosing in Period 2 because he missed too many visits due to illness. 
A total of 196 subjects completed the study as per protocol. All of these subjects were part of the 208 
subjects who were included in both the PK and PD analysis sets.  
Number and reasons for withdrawal were as expected. The about 10% withdrawal rate seems to 
equally distribute over the 6 sequences. As to the subjects withdrawn due to AEs or SAEs  see safety

Pharmacokinetic Results 
Concentration Data of PEG-GCSF in Serum 
After administration of a single sc injection of 2 mg pegfilgrastim, PEG-GCSF (analyte) appeared in 
serum within 2 to 4 hours post-dose. Only for 2 of the 216 subjects, PEG-GCSF concentrations were 
first observed at 6 hours after dosing with EU-Neulasta.  
The concentrations of PEG-GCSF in serum increased slowly, with maximum mean concentrations 
reached at approximately 12 hours post-dose.  
Mean PEG-GCSF concentrations could be determined in serum up to 144 hours post-dose for all 3 
treatments.

Pharmacokinetic Parameters of PEG-GCSF in Serum 
The exposure to PEG-GCSF (in terms of Cmax, AUC0-inf and AUC0-t) was most similar between MYL-
1401H and US-Neulasta, whereas the exposure of EU-Neulasta appeared to be slightly lower than the 
other 2 treatments (Table 8).  
The median Tmax of PEG-GCSF in serum was 12 hours for all 3 treatments. 
The geometric mean t1/2 of PEG-GCSF varied minimally between 49.3 and 51.1 hours across 
treatments. 
The %AUCextra, Vd/F and kel were comparable between the 3 treatments. 
Considerable inter-subject variability was observed for the primary PK parameters Cmax and AUC0-inf 
of PEG-GCSF (CV% ~70%). 
Table 8: 
Summary of PK Parameters for PEG-GCSF in Serum (Geometric Mean [CV%]) 
(MYL-1401H-1001) 
Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic equivalence 
When comparing the primary PK parameters Cmax and AUC0-inf of PEG-GCSF between MYL-1401H, 
EU-Neulasta and US-Neulasta, GLM ANOVA results showed that the 90% CIs of the ratios of geometric 
means for these PK parameters ranged between 0.907 and 1.18. The 90% CIs were therefore well 
contained within the standard bioequivalence interval of 0.8000 - 1.2500 for each of the comparisons.  
These results demonstrate similar PK profiles of MYL-1401H, EU-Neulasta and US-Neulasta. The intra-
subject CV% (within-subject variability) for the primary PK parameters Cmax and AUC0-inf was 54.8% 
and 41.8%, respectively, across the 3 treatments.

in Serum (Geometric Mean [CV%]) (MYL-1401H-1001) 
Relationship between Pharmacokinetics and Anti-Drug Antibodies 
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the serum PEG-GCSF concentrations and PK parameters 
by treatment and ADA status as defined as follows. 
•  ADA positive: Subjects with any confirmed positive ADA response against PEG G-CSF at any 
point during the study 
•  ADA negative: Subjects with no confirmed positive ADA response against PEG G-CSF at any 
point during the study 
In addition, geometric mean ratios and corresponding 90% CIs for the 3 pairwise comparisons 
between 2 treatments were repeated by ADA status for the primary and secondary PK parameters. 
Minimal differences (≤10%) in the exposure to PEG-GCSF were observed between ADA positive and 
negative subjects. For MYL-1401H treatment the geometric mean AUC0-inf was approximately 1.1-fold 
higher in ADA positive subjects (932 h·ng/mL; n=62) than in ADA negative subjects (843 h·ng/mL; 
n=142), whereas for EU-Neulasta the AUC0-inf was approximately 1.1-fold lower in ADA positive (775 
h·ng/mL; n=62) than in ADA negative subjects (860 h·ng/mL; n=141). For US-Neulasta the 
differences in exposure were less than 5% between ADA positive (857 h·ng/mL; n=64) and negative 
subjects (885 h·ng/mL; n=143). 
When excluding the ADA positive subjects from the comparison of the primary PK parameters Cmax 
and AUC0-inf of PEG-GCSF between the 3 treatments, results showed that the upper limit of the 90% 
CIs of the geometric means ratios were still contained within 0.8000 - 1.2500 bioequivalence interval 
for each comparison.

Study MYL-1401H-1001 
Concentration Data of ANC and CD34+ in Serum ANC 
After administration of a single sc injection of 2 mg MYL-1401H, EU-Neulasta or US-Neulasta, mean 
ANC levels above baseline were first observed at 4 hours post-dose on Day 1. For all 3 treatments, a 
similar peak increase of approximately 8-fold compared to baseline was observed between Day 2 and 
Day 3 (24-48 hours post-dose; see Figure 2).

Figure 2: 
Arithmetic Mean Change from Baseline ANC Serum Concentration-Time 
Profiles (MYL-1401H-1001) 
Thereafter the mean ANC appeared to decrease in a multiphasic manner, with a relatively slow 
elimination phase between Day 6 and Day 9 (between 120 and 192 hours post-dose), before the ANC 
returned to values near baseline on Day 12 (264 hours post-dose). The mean ANC versus time profiles 
were very similar between the 3 treatments. 
The combined individual change from baseline ANC versus time profiles showed minimal inter-
individual variability. However, for 2 subjects the increase in the ANC was very low (approximately 2-
fold compared to baseline) after administration of US-Neulasta in Period 2 compared to the other 
subjects. These minimal ANC increases were consistent with the relatively low PEG-GCSF 
concentrations observed for these subjects. 
Mean CD34+ counts above baseline were first observed on Day 3. A maximum increase of 
approximately 9.5-fold compared to baseline was observed on Day 5 (96 hours post-dose; see Figure 
3). Thereafter the mean CD34+ counts decreased to values near baseline on Day 12. The mean 
CD34+ versus time profiles were very similar between the 3 treatments. 
The combined individual change from baseline CD34+ counts versus time profiles showed considerable 
inter-individual variability in the extent of increase in CD34+ counts over time.

The primary PD parameters ANC Cmax and ANC AUC0-t were very similar across treatments. Also the 
secondary PD parameters CD34+ Cmax and CD34+ AUC0-t were comparable between these 
treatments (Table 10). 
For MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta the median ANC Tmax was 48 hours and for US-Neulasta the median 
ANC Tmax was 24 hours. For the CD34+ counts, the median CD34+ Tmax was 96 hours for all 3 
treatments. 
The inter-subject variability was much higher for the secondary CD34+ PD parameters (CV% up to 
~80%) than for the primary ANC PD parameters (CV% up to ~30%).

•  Statistical Analysis of Pharmacodynamic Equivalence 
Primary PD Parameters 
When comparing the primary PD parameters ANC AUC0-t and ANC Cmax between the 3 treatments 
(MYL-1401H, EU-Neulasta and US-Neulasta), GLM ANOVA results showed that the 95% CIs of the 
ratios of geometric means for these PD parameters ranged between 0.943 and 1.061 for each of the 
comparisons. The 95% CIs were therefore well contained within the predefined equivalence interval of 
0.8500 - 1.1765 for each of the comparisons (Table 11). Likewise, the 90% CIs ranging between 0.950 
and 1.054 were well contained within the 0.80 – 1.25 similarity range which was conducted as 
additional analysis. The intra-subject CV% was low for the primary PD parameters and comparable 
between ANC AUC0-t (22.3%) and ANC Cmax (17.7%). 
Table 11:

(MYL-1401H-1001) 
Secondary PD Parameters 
The estimates and corresponding 95% CIs of the geometric mean ratios were close to 1 for the 
secondary PD parameters CD34+ Cmax and CD34+ AUC0-t, with 95% CIs ranging between 0.915 and 
1.104 for each of the comparisons (Table 12). The intra-subject variability was comparable between 
CD34+ Cmax (33.7%) and CD34+ AUC0-t (34.1%) across the 3 treatments. For the secondary PD 
parameters ANC Tmax and CD34+ Tmax, all estimates and corresponding 95% CIs were zero (0.000).

In addition, geometric mean ratios and corresponding 95% CIs for the 3 pairwise comparisons 
between 2 treatments were repeated by ADA status for the primary PD parameters for ANC and 
secondary PD parameters for ANC and CD34+ count data. 
Minimal differences in the PD response were observed between ADA positive and negative subjects. 
For all 3 treatments, the primary PD response in terms of ANC AUC0-t appeared to be approximately 
10% lower in ADA positive subjects compared to in ADA negative subjects.

When excluding the ADA positive subjects from the comparison of the primary PD parameters in terms 
of ANC Cmax and ANC AUC0-t between the 3 treatments, results showed that the upper limit of the 
95% CIs of the geometric means ratios were still contained within 0.8500 - 1.1765 equivalence 
interval for each comparison (Table 13). 
Still in the smaller ADA positive subgroup the equivalence margin was met for the primary PD 
parameters. Also for the secondary PD parameters in this ADA negative subgroup, the estimates and 
corresponding 95% CIs of the geometric mean ratios were close to 1 for CD34+ Cmax and CD34+ 
AUC0-t, and the median difference was zero (0.000) for ANC Tmax and CD34+ Tmax.

intended to evaluate immunogenicity, PD, safety, and tolerability of the test product, MYL-1401H, 
compared with the reference product, US-licensed Neulasta, in healthy subjects.

Figure 4: 
Each subject received 2 single sc. injections of 6 mg of either the test product, MYL-1401H, or the 
Study design (MYL-1401-1002) 
reference product, US-Neulasta, in 2 separate periods with a washout period of 4 weeks between study 
drug administrations. The sc. injections were given using a prefilled syringe. 
As primary objective the immunogenicity between two sc injections of MYL-1401H and US Neulasta 
was descriptively compared. As secondary objective the safety and tolerability of MYL-1401H and US 
Neulasta after two sc injections (6 mg) in healthy volunteers was evaluated. 
The sample size estimation is based on an “expected immunogenicity event rate” as follows: 
The expected immunogenicity event rate in this study was 13%. A total sample size of 44 normal 
healthy volunteers (22 per group) would provide 95% confidence to rule out an immunogenicity event 
rate of 13% or more in each treatment group if no events are observed.  
Results 
•  Disposition of Subjects and Data Sets Analysed 
Of the 85 subjects who were screened, 50 subjects were included in the study. Of these, 25 subjects 
received 6 mg MYL-1401H and 25 subjects received 6 mg US-Neulasta in the first treatment period. 
After dosing in Period 1, 6 subjects were withdrawn due to non-serious TEAEs. As a result, 23 of 25 
subjects who received 6 mg MYL-1401H in the first treatment period received the same dose in the 
second treatment period, and 21 of 25 subjects who received 6 mg US-Neulasta in the first treatment 
period received the same dose in the second treatment period. In addition, Subject 004 withdrew 
consent in the second treatment period after receiving the second dose of US-Neulasta. A total 43 
subjects completed the study and all were included in the PP set. The subject who withdrew consent 
after completion of dosing in Period 2 was included in the PP set as well, which consisted of 44 subjects 
in total. All 50 dosed subjects were included in the SAF set. 
There were a few protocol deviations that were considered minor and not having affected the outcome 
of the study.

Pharmacodynamic Results 
Samples for determination of ANC were taken each period on Day -1 (as part of the clinical laboratory 
assessments), on Days 2 (as part of the clinical laboratory assessments), 3, 8, 15, and 22, and at 
follow-up (as part of the clinical laboratory assessments). The Day 3 assessment was expected to be 
close to the time of maximum potential drug effect on ANC. 
The mean ANC versus time profiles were relatively similar between the 2 treatments. An ANC elevation 
was observed at the first sampling time point of 24 hours after dosing of either the test product, MYL-
1401H, or the reference product, US-Neulasta. The strongest ANC response was observed 48 hours 
after the second dose; ANC levels were approximately 9-fold higher for both treatments compared with 
baseline. On subsequent days, ANC levels decreased and had returned to normal by 14 days after 
dosing. CD34+ counting was not performed.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Study MYL-1401H-1001 demonstrated in an appropriate and sensitive model in a confirmatory way 
that 2 mg MYL-1401H and 2 mg reference MP (Neulasta EU sourced) were equivalent in terms of PK 
profiles and the co-primary PD endpoints ANC AUC0-t and ANC Cmax. This study also showed PD 
equivalence as to CD34+ count as a secondary parameter.  
There were small differences in the PD response observed between ADA positive and negative subjects 
where responses in terms of ANC AUC0-t appeared to be approximately 10% lower in ADA positive 
subjects compared to in ADA negative subjects. Although the study MYL-1401H-1001 was not powered 
to evaluate equivalence of the primary PD parameters for ANC in a smaller subgroup of ADA negative 
subjects, these results indicate that the primary PD parameters continued to be equivalent between 
MYL-1401H and the reference treatments EU-Neulasta and US-Neulasta in a subgroup of subjects 
without any ADA positive response at any time point. Also the secondary PD parameters appeared to 
be similar between MYL-1401H and the reference treatments in this subgroup. 
PD was also descriptively analysed in trial MYL-1401H-1002. The results reasonably support those of 
study 1001. In this study US-sourced Neulasta was used. The study results are relevant for the current 
application because an analytical bridge between US- and EU-sourced reference product has been 
established.

biomaterials and mechanism of action. This is acceptable as according to the guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005, these studies are not required. 
Taken together, these results support the claim of biosimilarity between Fulphila and the reference 
product Neulasta.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  has  been  well  described  for  Fulphila  and  the  claim  of  biosimilarity  is 
supported  by  the  primary  and  secondary  PK  parameters  which  were  fully  contained  within  the 
acceptance  interval  of  80.00-125.00%  in  the  study  MYL-1401H-1001  as  well  as  the  secondary  PD 
parameters where the GMR were close to 1.  
Study MYL-1401H-1002 was supportive of the claim for biosimilarity. 
Therefore,  overall  PK/PD  data  from  the  two  studies  show  that  similarity  between  Fulphila  and  the 
reference product Neulasta could be demonstrated.

up to 24 weeks following the first administration. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in Cycle 1, defined as 
days with ANC <0.5 × 109/L. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:

the ANC nadir). 
 The rate of febrile neutropenia (FN) defined by the European Society of Medical Oncology Clinical 
Practice Guidelines as ANC <0.5 × 109/L, or expected to fall below 0.5 × 109/L, with a single oral

Sample size 
Approximately 189 patients were planned for enrolment into the study in a 2:1 ratio of the 2 treatment 
groups (126:63 in the MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta arm, respectively). 
A total sample size of 135 patients allocated in a 2:1 ratio (90 and 45 patients treated with MYL-1401H 
and Neulasta, respectively) is required to provide 90% power to declare that MYL-1401H is comparable 
to Neulasta in the analysis of DSN in cycle 1. This sample size assumes that the mean DSN will be 1.70 
days in cycle 1 for both MYL-1401H and Neulasta. 
The common SD is assumed to be 1.5 days. Equivalence will be declared if the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the mean DSNs falls wholly within a region defined 
as [-1, +1 day]. 
The region of [-1, +1 day] was established by analyzing historical Neulasta data and estimating a 50% 
retention of the Neulasta mean treatment benefit over placebo. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised to receive either MYL-1401H or EU-Neulasta (in a 2:1 ratio, respectively), 
and were stratified based on their age and country. 
Blinding (masking) 
The oncology pharmacist who prepared the doses and the person administering the drug (eg, study 
nurse, physician [other than the principal investigator or sub-principal investigator]) were the only 
individuals who had access or knowledge of the actual drug delivered. When administering the drug, 
the application syringes were covered in order to make them indistinguishable to the patient. 
Statistical methods 
The ITT Population (ITT) consisted of all patients who were randomized into the study. Patients in the 
ITT population were categorized to the treatment as-randomized. 
The per protocol (PP) population was defined at the end of Cycle 1 and was a subset of the ITT, 
including patients receiving treatment to which they were randomized and had no major protocol 
deviations. 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the PP population, an in the ITT as a sensitivity analysis. 
An ANOVA model with treatment as independent variable, and country and age-group as factors, was 
used to produce a 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in least squares means DSNs. Equivalence was 
declared if the CI was completely within the range of ± 1 day. 
The difference in mean DSN in Cycle 1 within the PP population was statistically compared with the 
following hypotheses: 
H0: (μ MYL-1401H – μNeulasta ≤-1) or (μ MYL-1401H - μNeulasta ≥1) 
H1: -1 day <(μ MYL-1401H – μNeulasta) <1 day, 
where μ MYL-1401H and μNeulasta are the mean DSN for MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta, respectively; 
calculated in days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 55/88 
 
 
 
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment as an independent variable, and country and 
age-group as factors, was used to produce a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in 
least squares mean (LS Mean) DSNs. The 2-sided 95% CI is equivalent to two 1-sided tests at the 
2.5% level. Equivalence was declared if the CI was completely within the range of ± 1 day. 
Secondary endpoints were analysed descriptively. 
A blinded interim analysis was conducted when 50% of the required patients had completed cycle 1. If 
the common SD had been estimated to be > 1.5 days, then the sample size would have been adjusted 
accordingly. Since this evaluation is blinded, there was no impact on the overall type 1 error rate and 
no adjustment of the final analysis of the primary objective was required according to the applicant. 
Because the SD was less than 1.5 days, no adjustment to the sample size was made.

Analysed: 194 patients were included in the data analysis. 
Conduct of the study 
Version 3.0 of the SAP (dated 25 September 2015) included information on additional immunogenicity 
assessments to be performed in anticipation of a protocol change. However, due to operational 
reasons, the protocol change was not initiated and as a consequence the additional immunogenicity 
assessments were not performed.  
A summary of the major protocol deviations is presented in Table 15.

ITT Population: 
The ITT population consisted of all patients who were randomized into the study. The ITT population 
consisted of a total of 194 (100%) patients. 
Safety Population: 
The safety population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and consisted of 
194 (100%) patients. 
Per Protocol Population: 
The PP population was defined at the end of Cycle 1 and included a subset of the ITT population who 
started treatment without major protocol deviations and consisted of 193 (99.5%) patients. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Duration of Severe Neutropenia: Cycle 1 (PP population) 
The mean (± SD) DSN in the MYL-1401H group was 1.2 (± 0.93), the median DSN was 1.0, and the 
DSN ranged from 0 to 5 days. In the EU-Neulasta group, the mean (± SD) DSN was 1.2 (± 1.10), the 
median DSN was 1.0, and the DSN ranged from 0 to 4 days. The DSN was 1 day for 51 (40.5%) 
patients in the MYL-1401H group and 17 (25.4%) patients in the EU-Neulasta group. The DSN was 0 
days for 32 (25.4%) patients in the MYL-1401H group and for 24 [35.8%] patients in the EU-Neulasta

group. The DSN was 2 days for 25 (27.8%) patients in the MYL-1401H group and for 17 (25.4.%) 
patients in the EU-Neulasta group (Table 17). 
Table 17:  Duration of Severe Neutropenia in Cycle 1 (PP Population) 
The 95% CI (-0.285, 0.298) for the difference in least square mean DSN of MYL-1401H and EU-
Neulasta was found to be within the pre-specified equivalence range of [-1 day, +1 day] based on the 
ANOVA model with treatment group, country, and age group as factors. Therefore comparable efficacy 
of MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta can be declared (null hypothesis that mean DSN in Cycle 1 on MYL-
1401H differs from mean DSN on EU-Neulasta by 1 day or more can be rejected). 
In summary, trial MYL-1401H-3001 met its primary objective.  
There were 19 out of 126 (15%) patients in the MYL-1401H group and 13 out of 67 (19.4%) in the EU-
Neulasta group who tested positive for anti-drug antibody (ADA) and 107 out of 126 (85%) patients in 
the MYL-1401H group and 54 out of 67 (80.6%) in the EU-Neulasta group who tested positive negative 
for anti-drug antibody (ADA). Results of DSN in this subgroup are presented in

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has submitted the results of a parallel-group, active controlled, blinded trial to show 
equivalence in terms of DSN. The study design was in accordance with scientific recommendations as 
outlined in the respective EMA guideline currently in place.  
There are minor criticisms on trial 3001 such as administering TAC to patients in neo-adjuvant intent, 
and not stratifying TAC for adjuvant/neo-adjuvant. These are, however, minor design and conduct 
issues which have, in essence, no effect on the biosimilar conclusion. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary analysis, as well as the sensitivity analyses, of the primary endpoint are robust and allow 
the conclusion which read: 
The primary objective of the study was met, where the median DSN was 1.0 day (range 0-5) and EU-
Neulasta was 1.0 (0.4), the LS mean difference from Neulasta was 0.01 (95%CI -0.285, 0.298), 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 66/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determined by the ANOVA analysis (with treatment group, country, and age group as factors for the 
difference in least square mean DSNs of MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta). The results were found to be 
within the pre-specified equivalence range of [-1 day, +1 day]. In fact, the 95% CIs were very narrow 
allowing a firm conclusion of similar efficacy. These results show that there are no significant 
differences between the two products in terms of DSN, supporting the claim for biosimilarity. 
There were small numerical differences for secondary efficacy endpoints (depths of nadir, frequency of 
severe neutropenia, frequency of febrile neutropenia) not precluding a conclusion of biosimilarity. 
However, these were not considered clinically relevant. Secondary endpoints and the result of the 
frequency of neutropenia for cycle 2 to 6 lend overall support to the therapeutic equivalence between 
Fulphila and Neulasta. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical data in the trial MYL-1401H-3001 in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy has 
shown comparable efficacy between Fulphila and Neulasta in reducing the duration of severe 
neutropenia. Hence, MYL-1401H and Neulasta EU-sourced offer therapeutic equivalence which supports 
the claim for biosimilarity. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Mylan has conducted 3 clinical studies that have evaluated the comparability of safety between MYL-
1401H and Neulasta: 2 studies in healthy subjects (MYL-1401H-1001 and MYL-1401H-1002) and 1 
comparative safety and efficacy study in patients with Stage II/III invasive breast cancer (MYL-1401H-
3001). 
Due to differences in the study dose, study design, and populations, the safety data from the 3 studies 
(MYL-1401H-1001, MYL-1401H-1002, and MYL-1401H-3001) have not been integrated.  
The clinical trial specifically dedicated to immunogenicity is trial MYL-1401H-1002. However a thorough 
assessment of immunogenicity was conducted across the 3 clinical studies (see below). 
Patient exposure 
A total of 232 healthy subjects and 127 patients diagnosed with breast cancer have received at least 1 
dose of MYL-1401H. 
In 3-way crossover Study MYL-1401H-1001, 216 healthy male and female subjects received at least 
one 2-mg SC injection of pegfilgrastim and 198 subjects received the planned 3 doses of pegfilgrastim: 
207 subjects received at least 1 dose of MYL-1401H (test product), 208 subjects received at least 1 
dose of EU-Neulasta and 207 subjects received atleast 1 dose of US-Neulasta. 
In Study MYL-1401H-1002, 25 healthy male and female subjects received at least one 6-mg SC 
injection of MYL-1401H (test product) and 25 healthy male and female subjects received at least one 
6-mg SC injection of US-Neulasta. Two 6-mg SC injections were received by 23 subjects in the MYL-
1401H group and 21 subjects in the US-Neulasta group. 
In Study MYL-1401H-3001, 127 patients received at least one 6-mg SC injection of MYL-1401H (test 
product) and 67 patients received at least one 6-mg SC injection of EU-Neulasta. One hundred twenty 
(94.5%) patients in the MYL-1401H group and 66 (98.5%) patients received all 6 doses of study drug. 
During each cycle, the majority of patients received their study drug on Day 2 of the cycle as 
scheduled.

Adverse events 
Study MYL-1401H-1001 
In Study MYL-1401H-1001, safety and tolerability were evaluated after the single 2-mg sc injection by 
evaluating all AEs, physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory, local tolerance, and 
immunogenicity (early development of ADA). 
There were 1129 TEAEs reported by 200 (93%) subjects that were considered related to pegfilgrastim 
treatment with 177 (86%) subjects who received MYL-1401H, 182 (88%) subjects who received EU-
Neulasta, and 181 (87%) subjects who received US-Neulasta (Table 24). 
Table 24:  Overview of treatment-emergent adverse events during the study 
(1001) 
In MYL-1401H-1001, the most commonly reported TEAE by preferred term (PT) were back pain (81% 
of the subjects), headache (63% of the subjects), pain in extremity (36% of the subjects) and 
nasopharyngitis (22% of the subjects). There were no relevant differences in the frequencies of TEAEs 
or percentages of subjects reporting TEAEs among MYL-1401H and the reference treatments (EU-
Neulasta and US-Neulasta).

Table 25:  Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events During the Study 
(1002) 
There were 376 TEAEs reported by 49 (98%) subjects: 188 TEAEs by 24 (96.0%) subjects who 
received MYL-1401H and 188 TEAEs by 25 (100.0%) subjects who received the reference product US-
Neulasta. 
Generally, most TEAEs reported during the study were consistent with the clinical data of pegfilgrastim 
(Neulasta). No serious AEs (SAEs) or unexpected TEAEs were reported. 
The number of TEAEs and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs was comparable between MYL-
1401H and the reference product US-Neulasta: 188 TEAEs reported by 24 (96.0%) subjects and 188 
TEAEs reported by 25 (100.0%) subjects, respectively. The most frequently reported TEAEs by system 
organ class (SOC) (ie, reported by >50% of the subjects) were musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (by 90.0% of the subjects), nervous system disorders (72.0%), and general disorders and 
administration site conditions (60.0%). The most frequently reported preferred terms (PTs) (ie, 
reported by ≥20% of the subjects) were back pain (80.0%), headache (70.0%), injection site pain 
(30.0%), fatigue (26.0%), myalgia (24.0%), non-cardiac chest pain (24.0%), pain in extremity 
(20.0%), and abdominal pain (20.0%). There were no relevant differences in the frequency of TEAEs 
or percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs between MYL-1401H and US-Neulasta. 
Study MYL-1401H-3001 
In Study MYL-1401H-3001, 806 TEAEs were reported in 114 (89.8%) patients in the MYL-1401H group 
and 414 TEAEs were reported in 58 (86.6%) patients in the EU-Neulasta group. Among the patients 
with TEAEs, the majority had TEAEs that resolved during the study (104 [81.9%] patients in the MYL-
1401H group and 47 [70.1%] patients in the EU-Neulasta group). An overview of TEAEs in Study MYL-
1401H-3001 is provided in Table 26.

Table 26: 
Overview of treatment-emergent adverse events during the study (3001) 
The most commonly reported TEAE by preferred term was alopecia reported by 76 (59.8%) patients in 
the MYL-1401H group and 36 (53.7%) patients in the EU-Neulasta group. Of patients with this TEAE, 
most had CTCAE Grade 1 events (36 [28.3%] patients in the MYL-1401H group and 14 [20.9%] 
patients in the EU-Neulasta group) and Grade 2 events (36 [28.3%] patients in the MYL-1401H group 
and 22 [32.8%] patients in the EU-Neulasta group) (CSR MYL-1401H-3001). The events of alopecia 
were not considered related to the study drug by the investigator.  
The TEAE of bone pain was reported for 51 (40.2%) patients in the MYL-1401H group and 24 (35.8%) 
patients in the EU-Neulasta group. Of the patients with this TEAE, most had CTCAE Grade 1 (21 
[16.5%] patients in the MYL-1401H group and 10 [14.9%] patients in the EU-Neulasta group) and 
Grade 2 (26 [20.5%] patients in the MYL-1401H group and 13 [19.4%] patients in the EU-Neulasta 
group). Fifty (39.4%) patients in the MYL-1401H group and 23 (34.3%) patients in the EU-Neulasta 
group) had treatment-related TEAEs of bone pain. Bone pain was managed by simple analgetics, and 
no patients discontinued from the study as a result of their bone pain. The majority of the events of 
bone pain were reported in Cycle 1 (44 [34.6%] in the MYL-1401H group and 17 [25.4%] in the EU-
Neulasta group). However, a higher rate of use of naproxen was reported during Cycle 1 in the EU-
Neulasta group, 19 (28.4%) patients compared to 25 (19.8%) in the MYL-1401H group. Notably, the 
Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire, a sensitive and relevant measure of the intensity and interference 
of pain in the patient’s life, was similar between the treatment groups. 
There were 8 patients with thrombocytosis in the MYL-1401H group that were Grade 1 or 2 in severity 
and resolved without any intervention. The actual laboratory values of platelets were similar between 
the treatment groups (approximately 65 [51.2%] patients in the MYL-1401H group had at least 1 
episode of elevated platelet count >450 compared with 35 [52.2%] in the EU-Neulasta group and 
about half of these were single isolated episodes in both the groups). At the end-of-study visit, the 
mean and median platelets and the change from baseline in platelet counts were similar between the 
treatment groups. Additionally, the AE reporting of thrombocytosis appeared to be subjective, with 
only 3 of 24 sites reporting all the 8 events of thrombocytosis in the MYL-1401H group.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study MYL-1401H-1001 
In Study MYL-1401H-1001, 1 serious AE (SAE) of appendicitis in the US-Neulasta group occurred and 
resulted in subject withdrawal. The SAE was not considered to be related to pegfilgrastim. 
Study MYL-1401H-1002 
No SAEs were reported in Study MYL-1401H-1002. 
Study MYL-1401H-3001 
In Study MYL-1401H-3001, SAEs were infrequent. A total of 9 (4.6%) patients in the safety population 
had at least 1 SAE (8 [6.3%] patients in the MYL-1401H group and 1 [1.5%] patients in the EU-
Neulasta group. There were no SAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. 
Six of 127 (4.7%) patients had FN in the MYL-1401H group and 1 of 67 (1.5%) patients had FN in the 
EU-Neulasta group, which were considered to be SAEs. All the events of FN lasted less than 5 days, no 
documented infections nor sepsis events were observed during the events of FN, and all the FN events 
resolved without the use of rescue therapy. Of 7 patients with FN considered SAEs, only 3 patients met 
the ESMO definition for FN while 4 other patients had insufficient data. However, these patients were 
conservatively included under the category of FN. 
There was 1 patient with an SAE of erysipelas and 1 patient with SAEs of hypokalemia and anemia in 
the MYL-1401H group, all of which were deemed resolved at the time of data analysis. All SAEs were 
deemed unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. 
All SAEs of FN were deemed related to the chemotherapy and unrelated to treatment with MYL-1401H 
or EU-Neulasta by the investigator. There was no significant difference in the rate of FN between the 
treatment groups (p=0.35) based on a chi-square test comparing the proportion of patients with FN 
between the treatment groups. Given the 2:1 randomization, small sample size, and frequency of ANC 
assessments based on safety considerations, it is believed that these minor differences are incidental 
findings. All events of FN lasted less than 5 days, no documented infections or sepsis events were 
observed during the events of FN, and all FN events resolved without the use of rescue therapy. 
No deaths occurred during any of the MYL-1401H clinical studies. 
Laboratory findings 
In study MYL-1401H-1002 all clinical laboratory parameters were measured at screening and follow-
up, and each period at baseline on Day -1 and on Day 2. Absolute neutrophil count was also measured 
on Days 3, 8, 15, and 22 as part of the PD assessments. For both treatments, mean ALP and LDH 
levels on Day 2 of both periods were elevated compared with baseline but remained below the ULN. 
Also individual ALP and LDH levels during the study remained below ULN. In summary, all observed 
hematological and clinical chemistry changes were expected and were primarily related to the PD 
effects of pegfilgrastim.

Summary of Hematology 
Across all 3 studies (MYL-1401H-1001, MYL-1401H-1002, MYL-1401H-3001), there were no notable 
differences observed in the hematology measurements between the MYL-1401H groups and Neulasta 
groups. Across treatments, similar transient shifts in neutrophils and leukocytes occurred, and these 
parameters had returned to baseline levels by Day 13 and Day 15, respectively. White blood cell 
(counts of 100 × 109/L or greater) have been observed in less than 1% of patients receiving Neulasta 
and are consistent with the PD effects of pegfilgrastim. 
Summary of Liver and Kidney Function Tests 
Overall, there were no notable new differences observed in the liver or kidney function tests between 
MYL-1401H and Neulasta treatment groups. Liver function abnormalities are consistent with the PD 
effects of pegfilgrastim. 
Vital signs, ECG, and physical findings in study 1002 can be summarized that they were insignificant 
for a population of healthy volunteers. There were no findings of splenomegaly or symptoms of splenic 
rupture during the physical examinations of the abdomen throughout the study. One subject (US-
Neulasta) had ‘left side tenderness’, which was considered to be of no clinical relevance. 
Local tolerability (including ISR and VAS) in study 1002 was assessed each period at pre-dose and at 
1, 4, 24 (Day 2), and 48 hours (Day 3) post-dose. Mostly, the ISR scores were ‘none’ (0). For 9 
subjects that received MYL-1401H, at 1 or more time points following drug administration, a mild 
reaction was observed (ISR score of 1). This was mainly at 1 hour post-dose, but in some instances 
also at 4, 24, or 48 hours post-dose. For 5 subjects that received US-Neulasta, at 1 or more time 
points following drug administration, a mild reaction was observed (ISR score of 1). This was mainly at 
1 hour post-dose, but in some instances also at 4, 24, or 48 hours post-dose. Most subjects had a 
score of 0 mm on a 0-100 mm VAS scale, indicating no pain at the injection site. There were 2 scores 
of 7 mm, all other scores were 4 mm or lower. The difference in the frequency of injection site 
reactions (ISR) 9/25 (36%; MYL-1401H) vs. 5/25 (20%; US-Neulasta) could reach statistical 
significance (not statistically analysed by the applicant). In trial 1001 identical but in 1002 different 
syringes were used. A higher frequency of injection site reactions (9/25 MYL-1401H vs 5/25 US-
Neulasta) has been observed and is noticeable in trial 1002 (all grade 1) but absent in pivotal 3001.  
Safety in special populations 
N/A 
Immunological events 
A thorough assessment of immunogenicity was conducted across the 3 clinical studies. The clinical 
program included Study MYL-1401H-1001 and Study MYL-1401H-1002, which were conducted in 
normal healthy volunteers, and Study MYL-1401H-3001, which was conducted in patients with breast 
cancer who were receiving chemotherapy. Serum samples were analyzed for the presence of ADA 
against MYL-1401H or Neulasta (either EU-Neulasta and/or US-Neulasta). Samples that were positive 
in the screening assay were further evaluated in a confirmatory assay. The samples confirmed as ADA-
positive were titrated to quantify the ADA response and were further evaluated for moiety 
characterization to determine if the antibodies were specifically directed against the PEG and/or the 
filgrastim moiety of the molecule. 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 72/88 
 
 
 
The immunogenicity assessment in the pivotal PK/PD Study MYL-1401H-1001 was limited. It 
evaluated a 2-mg dose, which is sub-therapeutic, and had a 3-way crossover design. Since subjects 
crossed over to other treatments, immunogenicity data from baseline through Day 29 in Period 1 (i.e., 
Period 2 pre-dose) are the most relevant for discussion, while data from Period 2 and Period 3 are 
potentially confounded. 
A 7% (16 of 216 subjects overall) baseline frequency of ADA+ subjects is notable, as well as a small 
imbalance (9 (4%) subjects prior to administration of MYL-1401H, 4 (2%) subjects prior to EU-
Neulasta and 3 (1%) subjects prior to US-Neulasta). Most of these baseline ADAs were directed 
against PEG, or PEG and filgrastim, but not filgrastim alone. A volunteer having ADAs directed against 
neither the PEG nor the filgrastim portion of the molecule seems to be a false positive ADA result. 
Prior to dosing on Day 1 of Period 2 (Table 27), which was Day 29 of Period 1 and the most relevant 
for immunogenicity assessment, 27 of the 208 (13%) subjects had positive ADA results at this time 
point with median ADA titre of 4 for each of the 3 treatments. Of the 27 subjects with confirmed 
positive results at pre dose in Period 2, 10 subjects had pre-existing ADAs at baseline and the other 17 
(8%) subjects developed ADAs after the first dose of study drug (5 subjects after MYL-1401H, 5 
subjects after EU-Neulasta, and 7 subjects after US-Neulasta). For these 17 subjects, the increased 
ADAs were considered to be treatment-induced positive ADA results. Thus, the incidence of treatment 
induced ADA positivity was similar across all the 3 dosing groups (7.2-9.7%) in Period 1. 
Table 27: 
Summary of subjects with treatment-induced anti-drug antibodies at pre-dose 
in period 2 (1001) 
Prior to dosing in Period 3, 13 of the 198 (6%) subjects continued to have positive ADA results. The 
median ADA titers were comparable across treatments (median titer: 2, 4, and 4 for MYL-1401H, EU-
Neulasta and US-Neulasta, respectively). 
At follow up, a total of 14 of the 213 (6%) subjects were found positive for ADA that included 6 
subjects with ADAs present prior to the first dose of study drug and 8 subjects that were considered to 
have treatment-induced positive ADA results (including 4, 1, and 3 subject[s] who received MYL-
1401H, EU-Neulasta, or US-Neulasta as first dose of study drug, respectively). All ADA titers were <30 
at follow up.
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 73/88 
 
 
 
 
The follow-up result make clear why a cross-over design is all but optimal for testing immunogenicity: 
The treatments actually consisted of 6 different sequences of 3 different products. 
Samples that were ADA positive were further assessed for NAb. A total of 72 subjects with ADA 
positive samples were analyzed for NAbs (Table 28). 
The term “72 subjects with ADA positive samples” gives approximately the same proportion of 
“immunogenicity” as in trial 1002 the wording “ADA was positive at 1 or more time points for 8 of 25 
(32.0%) subjects who received MYL-1401H and for 8 of 25 (32.0%) subjects who received US-
Neulasta”. 72/216 (see above) is 33.3%. Thus, this “phenomenon” is not dose related. 
Table 28: 
Summary of neutralizing antibodies by visit (1001) 
Study MYL-1401H-1002 was specifically designed to assess immunogenicity and evaluated a 6-mg 
repeated dose in normal healthy volunteers. It also evaluated both an early (IgM) and late (IgG) 
immunogenic response in a controlled setting. 
Samples for determination of ADA were taken each period on Day -1, on Days 8, 15, and 22, and at 
follow-up. 
Based on the SAF set, the confirmatory assay for ADA was positive at 1 or more time points for 8 of 25 
(32.0%) subjects who received MYL-1401H and for 8 of 25 (32.0%) subjects who received US-
Neulasta. There was no time-dependent increase in ADA titre following dosing of either MYL-1401H or 
US-Neulasta. Two Subjects (MYL-1401H) and one Subject  (US-Neulasta) had a positive ADA result 
before first dosing on Day -1 of the first period. 
Two subjects (MYL-1401H) continued to have positive ADA results at all time points measured, 
including follow-up, whereas one Subject  (US-Neulasta) had no positive ADA results after dosing. 
Positive ADA results at follow-up were seen for 4 subjects who received MYL-1401H and 2 subjects 
who received US-Neulasta. A maximum titer of 30 was measured once for one Subject  (on Day 15, 
MYL-1401H) and once for other Subject (at follow-up, US-Neulasta). 
Based on the per-protocol (PP)  set (subjects who received both doses of study drug), at the majority 
of the 9 time points measured, subjects who received MYL-1401H had slightly more positive ADA 
results than subjects who received US-Neulasta.  
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 74/88 
 
 
 
 
All samples confirmed as positive for ADA (mainly against PEG) were further analyzed for NAb using a 
validated cell-based assay. 
Based on the PP set (subjects who received both doses of study drug), no positive NAb results were 
seen for any of the subjects. Based on the SAF set however, positive NAb results were seen for one 
Subjects (MYL-1401H) and one subject (US-Neulasta). 
One Subject  (in the MYL-1401H arm) had positive ADA results at 4 time points in Period 1 (pre-dose 
[Day -1], Day 8 and Day 15, and at follow up after Period 1). At the first 3 of these time points (with 
ADA titers of 7 [pre-dose], 4, and 30), the NAb results were also positive. This subject was withdrawn 
after the first period due to a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of headache and was not 
included in the PP set; therefore, the subject had a follow-up visit after Period 1. At this follow-up visit, 
the subject was not positive for NAb. 
One subject  had a treatment-emergent, positive ADA result at 1 time point (with an ADA titer of 2 at 
Period 1, Day 8) at which time the NAb results were also positive. The subject did not have positive 
ADA prior to study start and therefore, her ADA and NAb positivity was treatment-emergent. As with 
one Subject, this subject was also withdrawn from the study after Period 1 due to a TEAE of headache 
and therefore was not included in the PP set. 
Figure 7: 
Percentages of Subjects with Positive ADA Versus Time by Treatment (PP set) 
•  Relationship Between Immunogenicity and Pharmacodynamic Results 
For the 2 subjects that had a maximum ADA titre of 30, one Subject  (Day 15, MYL-1401H) and other 
Subject (follow-up, US-Neulasta), the effect of pegfilgrastim treatment on ANC levels appeared not to 
be different from the subjects that had no positive ADA counts or positive ADA counts with lower titers. 
Based on this it appeared that the formation of ADA had no effect on the PD effects of pegfilgrastim. 
Finally, immunogenicity was also evaluated in the relevant patient population within Study MYL-1401H-
3001, in which patients with breast cancer received multiple doses of MYL-1401H or Neulasta in 
addition to their chemotherapeutic dosing regimen. Thus, the overall immunogenicity assessment 
includes evaluation of early and late immune response, response after multiple dosing in healthy 
volunteers as well as in patients, and response after low and therapeutic doses of MYL-1401H and 
Neulasta. 
Table 29 and Table 30 summarize the immunogenicity data at the sample and subject levels integrated 
across the 3 studies.

The proportions of ADA-positive samples were similar in MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta groups (8.3-
8.7%) and slightly higher (12.7%) in US-Neulasta group. At a subject level, 22.3% and 23.7% of 
subjects were positive at least once in MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta arm respectively, while the 
proportion was slightly higher at 33% in the US-Neulasta arm. Data from US-Neulasta is only from 
healthy subjects and it could have contributed to higher proportion of ADA positive response in that 
arm. Both at subject and sample level, most of the ADA positivity was against the PEG moiety of the 
molecule across the 3 groups. 
Table 29: 
Integrated summary of all immunogenicity results by sample (1001, 1002, 
3001, ITT population) 
Table 30: 
Integrated summary of all immunogenicity results by subject (1001, 1002, 
3001, ITT population) 
It is known that healthy subjects and patients are exposed to PEG-containing chemicals in the 
environment, and that anyone has a potential to develop antibodies against this moiety. This was 
apparent based on the pre-dose positive samples across each of the 3 studies. Table 30 summarises 
the pre-dose ADA-positive samples across the studies. 
The proportions of samples that were ADA-positive were similar in the MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta 
groups (13.5% and 11.5%, respectively) but was quite low in the US-Neulasta group (4.1%), which 
appears to be a chance finding. Many of the subjects who were ADA-positive prior to dosing continued 
to remain positive throughout the study. The majority of these subjects had antibodies against the PEG 
moiety of the molecule.

Table 31: 
Integrated summary of pre-dose immunogenicity results by sample (1001, 
1002, 3001, ITT population) 
To assess the treatment-induced impact on immunogenicity, an analysis was conducted to evaluate 
the post-dose ADA-positive results excluding the subjects who were ADA-positive at baseline. The data 
at the sample and subject level is presented in Table 32 and Table 33.

were ADA-negative at baseline by sample (1001, 1002, 3001, ITT population) 
Table 33: 
Integrated summary of post-dose immunogenicity results from subjects who 
were ADA-negative at baseline by subject (1001, 1002, 3001, ITT population) 
The data indicate that at the sample level, 5.0% and 6.3% of post-dose samples were treatment-
emergent ADA-positive in the MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta groups, respectively.

The proportion was higher (14.4%) in the US-Neulasta group. At a subject level, the proportions of 
subjects with post-dose treatment-emergent ADA-positive data were also similar for MYL-1401H and 
EU-Neulasta groups (10.4% and 13.8%, respectively), while it was 30.1% in the US-Neulasta group. 
Although the proportion of subjects who were treatment-emergent ADA-positive was higher in the US-
Neulasta group, the ADA in most cases were against only the PEG moiety, the titers were very low, 
and the antibodies were non-neutralizing. Only 2 subjects (1 each in the MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta 
groups) had antibodies against the GCSF moiety only. 
Two subjects were NAb-positive in the MYL-1401H group while none were NAb-positive in either 
Neulasta group. Table 34 presents the post-dose ADA-positive results excluding the subjects who were 
NAb-positive at baseline. This analysis is slightly different from analysis in Table 45 as it includes 
subjects who might have been ADA-positive but NAb-negative prior to dosing. The data indicate that 
there were 2 subjects who were treatment-emergent NAb-positive in the MYL-1401H group, 1 subject 
who was NAb-positive in the EU-Neulasta group, and 1 subject who was NAb-positive in the US-
Neulasta group.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The applicant did not submit safety related drug-drug interactions (see clinical safety).  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation from MYL-1401H due to TEAEs was infrequent. In Study MYL-1401H-1001, 3 TEAEs led 
to subject withdrawal (rash and abnormal liver function test in 2 subjects after EU-Neulasta, and a SAE 
of appendicitis in 1 subject after US-Neulasta). 
In Study MYL-1401H-1002, 6 subjects were withdrawn from the study due to TEAEs after dosing in 
Period 1 (vomiting in 1 subject and headache in 3 subjects in the US-Neulasta group and pain in 
extremity and headache in 1 subject each in the MYL-1401H group).

In Study MYL-1401H-3001, a Grade 2 TEAE of influenza led to discontinuation of MYL-1401H. The 
event was considered resolved at the time of data analysis. A Grade 3 TEAE of erysipelas led to 
discontinuation of the patient from the study, although it was considered resolved at the time of data 
analysis. A Grade 2 TEAE of pneumonitis led to discontinuation of MYL-1401H and from the study. The 
event was considered resolved at the time of data analysis. Among the patients who received EU-
Neulasta, a Grade 3 TEAE of increased ALT led to the discontinuation from the study drug. The event 
was considered resolved at the time of data analysis.  
None of the described events were deemed related to the study drug by the investigator. 
Post marketing experience 
There is no post marketing experience with Fulphila. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
To assess clinical safety of MYL-1401H intended to be bio-similar to Neulasta (EU) based on the dossier 
submitted has several challenges. 
Trial MYL-1401H-1001, has a cross-over design and therefore mainly period 1 can contribute to 
immunogenicity and safety assessment. For immunogenicity, results at the end of period 1 suggest 
that MYL-1401H is comparable to the reference product. 
Trial MYL-1401H-1002, in healthy volunteers was specifically dedicated to investigate immunogenicity.  
Healthy subjects are in fact considered a more sensitive model to compare immunogenicity of two 
pegfilgrastims than immunosuppressed patients, although differences in the frequency of AEs have to 
be large to be detected in a small trial such as 1002. The confirmatory assay for ADA was positive at 1 
or more time points for 8 of 25 (32.0%) subjects who received MYL-1401H and for 8 of 25 (32.0%) 
subjects who received Neulasta suggesting comparable immunogenicity of both products. Of note, this 
study used US-sourced Neulasta. The data are however relevant for the present application since an 
analytical bridge has been established between EU- and US-reference product. 
Trial MYL-1401H-3001, a phase III trial with parallel group design comparing Fulphila with Neulasta EU 
sourced during 6 cycles of TAC showed similar ADRs that occurred at similar frequencies for Fulphila 
and Neulasta. 
Overall, the AE profile of test and reference appeared similar. There is a high frequency of injection site 
reactions for MYL-1401H in study 1002. The relative high frequency of injection site reactions (grade 
1) in the MYL-1401H arm of trial 1002 was is an isolated finding in the smallest clinical trial and hence 
is not clinically relevant. 
Immunogenicity data derived from the 3 studies suggest similar immunogenicity profiles of test and EU 
reference. In the integrated analysis, immunogenicity appeared to be higher with US-reference which 
may be due to the fact that US-Neulasta was only administered to healthy subjects that are more likely 
to mount an immune response to an antigen than immunocompromised patients on chemotherapy as 
treated in study 3001. Most of the ADA positivity, including that at predose, was directed against the 
PEG moiety of the molecule across the 3 groups, which is unsurprising as it is known that exposure to 
PEG-containing chemicals in the environment may lead to development of antibodies against this 
moiety.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the results from the 3 clinical studies did not show any relevant difference in ADRs or 
immunogenicity following Fulphila administration compared to Neulasta. The safety of Fulphila supports 
the claim for similarity with Neulasta.

3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The claimed indication is identical to the reference product Neulasta: “Reduction in the duration of 
neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic 
syndromes)”. Clinical studies supporting the application were carried out in healthy volunteers as part 
of the biosimilarity exercise as well as a phase III clinical trial in breast cancer patients.  
The claim of biosimilarity is based on comparative analytical, nonclinical and clinical data.  
Quality:  
To establish biosimilarity of Fulphila to EU Neulasta on the quality level, a comprehensive analytical 
comparability exercise was performed comparing Fulphila to EU Neulasta. Up to 12 batches of Fulphila 
and up to 34 batches of EU Neulasta were included in the analytical similarity studies.  
Non-clinical: 
Comparative in vitro and in vivo non-clinical studies were performed in order to demonstrate 
biosimilarity between Fulphila and the reference product Neulasta. In addition, one comparative 28 day 
repeat dose toxicity study in neutropenic rats was performed.  
Clinical: 
With the present application (EMEA/H/C4915) the applicant provides study results from 3 clinical trials, 
of which MYL-1401H-1001 is the pivotal PK/PD study. 
MYL-1401H-1001 was a single centre, randomized, double-blind, 3-period, 3 treatments, 3-way 
crossover trial to evaluate the PD, PK, safety and tolerability of pegfilgrastim from test product (MYL-
1401H) compared to reference products EU- and US-Neulasta in healthy subjects. Primary objectives 
were comparison of PK and PD profiles after a single injection of a 2 mg dose of MYL-1401H and a 
single injection (2 mg) of EU- and US-Neulasta. 
Trial MYL-1401H-1002 was a single-centre, randomized, open-label, repeated dose, parallel group 
trial intended to evaluate immunogenicity, PD, safety, and tolerability of the test product, MYL-1401H, 
compared with the reference product, US-licensed Neulasta. Healthy subjects received 2 single SC 
injections of 6 mg of either the test product, MYL-1401H, or the reference product, US-Neulasta, in 2 
separate periods with a washout period of 4 weeks between study drug administrations. 
The phase III trial MYL-1401H-3001 was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, therapeutic 
equivalence study in breast cancer patients receiving 6 cycles TAC for adjuvant or neo-adjuvant 
treatment. The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of MYL-1401H versus 
Neulasta during chemotherapy cycle 1 using duration of severe neutropenia (DSN), defined as days 
with ANC < 0.5 × 109/L, as endpoint.

3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
From a quality perspective: 
With respect to primary, secondary and higher order structures comparability of Fulphila with the 
reference product EU Neulasta has been confirmed. Fulphila has been demonstrated to have an overall 
similar purity and impurity profile compared to Neulasta which refers in particular to oxidized and 
reduced, deamidated and charged variants, dimers, di-PEGylated variants and aggregates of 
pegfilgrastim as well as free filgrastim. 
In addition, analytical similarity of Neulasta sourced from US and EU was established.  
From a non-clinical perspective: 
The results of in vitro and in vivo studies underline comparability between the two products. In 
addition, no relevant differences were observed in the 28 day repeat dose toxicity study in neutropenic 
rats.  
From a clinical perspective:  
• 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
•  Study MYL-1401H-1001 demonstrated similar PK profiles of Neulasta-EU sourced, 
Neulasta-US sourced, and MYL-1401H (in all comparison-pairs). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For the comparison test vs. EU reference, the 90% CIs of the primary PK endpoints Cmax 
and AUC0-inf ([0.984; 1.16] and [0.979; 1.12], respectively] lay well within the predefined 
acceptance range of 0.8 to 1.25.    
The PD profiles were also similar between the 3 treatments. 
For the comparison test vs. EU reference, the 95% CIs of the primary PD parameters ANC 
Cmax and ANC AUC0-t ([0.960; 1.028] and [0.959; 1.045], respectively) were well contained 
within the predefined equivalence range of 0.8500 - 1.1765. Also the 95% CIs of the 
secondary PD parameters CD34+ Cmax and CD34+ AUC0-t met these margins, further 
supporting biosimilarity. 
The PD parameters of all three products tested demonstrate that they are equivalent in 
terms of PD.  
•  Although study MYL-1401H-1001 was not powered to evaluate equivalence of the primary 
PD parameters for ANC in a smaller subgroup of ADA negative subjects, these results 
indicate that the primary PD parameters continued to be similar between MYL-1401H and 
the reference treatments EU-Neulasta and US-Neulasta in a subgroup of subjects without 
any ADA positive response at any time point. Also the secondary PD parameters appeared 
to be similar between MYL-1401H and the reference treatments in this subgroup. 
• 
There were no clinically relevant differences in immunogenicity as shown in the trial MYL-
1401H-1002 where there were no detectable neutralizing antibodies detected.  
•  A secondary PD endpoint, however, was ANC which was descriptively analysed and 
supported the primary endpoints (Cmax and AUC of ANC) as of trial MYL-1401H-1001. The 
study 1002 is considered supportive of the overall biosimilarity of Fulphila 
• 
Efficacy 
• 
Trial MYL-1401H-3001 met its primary objective. The mean (± SD) DSN in the MYL-1401H 
group was 1.2 (± 0.93), the median DSN was 1.0, and the DSN ranged from 0 to 5 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/724003/2018  
Page 85/88 
 
 
 
In the EU-Neulasta group, the mean (± SD) DSN was 1.2 (± 1.10), the median DSN was 
1.0, and the DSN ranged from 0 to 4 days. The 95% CI (-0.285, 0.298) for the difference 
in least square mean DSN of MYL-1401H and EU-Neulasta was found to be within the pre-
specified equivalence range of [-1 day, +1 day]. 
•  Safety 
• 
The safety and immunogenicity profiles of MYL-1401H and EU-sourced Neulasta appeared 
generally similar in all 3 studies. The applicant presented within this application an 
integrated immunogenicity analysis which provided supportive evidence on the similarity of 
the immunogenicity profile.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the conclusion of 
biosimilarity of Fulphila and Neulasta.  
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Analytical similarity of MYL-1401H to the reference product Neulasta (EU) has been shown in a 
satisfactory manner. Likewise, analytical similarity of Neulasta sourced from EU and US was also 
demonstrated. Therefore, results obtained in comparison to US-reference product can be bridged and 
are relevant in supporting the overall biosimilarity exercise in this application. 
Non-clinical 
In vitro assays are considered more sensitive than in vivo studies to detect potential differences 
between test and reference product and hence, the results have shown equivalent similarity between 
the two products. Results from the in vitro study support a conclusion of functional similarity. The in 
vivo studies can be considered supportive of the biosimilarity. 
Clinical 
The clinical pharmacology studies have shown that the PK and PD data were within the acceptance 
range for the criteria for biosimilarity and immunogenicity was comparable between Fulphila and 
Neulasta. In addition, the clinical efficacy and safety data support the claim for biosimilarity as 
demonstrated by showing equivalent DSN and rates of febrile neutropenia as well as comparable safety 
profiles between the two products.  
Therefore,  considering  the  totality  of  the  evidence  on  the  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  data, 
biosimilarity of Fulphila with the reference product EU Neulasta can be concluded. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The claimed indication is the only indication currently approved for EU-Neulasta (“Reduction in the 
duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy for malignancy [with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic 
syndromes”]).  
3.6.  Additional considerations  
Not applicable.

3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Fulphila is considered biosimilar to Neulasta. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Fulphila is favourable in the following indication: 
Reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in adult patients 
treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia

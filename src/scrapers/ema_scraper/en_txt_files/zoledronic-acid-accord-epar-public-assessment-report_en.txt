2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Zoledronic Acid Accord is a generic medicinal product containing the active substance 
zoledronic acid (as monohydrate). The reference medicinal product is Zometa 4 mg/5 ml, 
Concentrate for solution for infusion. The qualitative composition of the generic product is 
identical to the reference product. Both products are administered intravenously as an 
infusion.  
Zoledronic  acid  is  a  nitrogen  containing  biphosphonate  and  it  binds  to  hydroxyapatite  in  the 
bone  mineral  matrix  and  strongly  inhibits  bone  resorption.  The  ability  of  bisphosphonates  to 
persist in bone matrix and to reduce osteoclast activity depends on their affinity for the bone 
matrix  and  potency  of  the  inhibition  of  farnesyl  pyrophosphate  synthase.  Zoledronic  acid  has 
the  highest  affinity  for  bone,  followed  by  alendronate,  ibandronate,  risedronate,  etidronate 
and  clodronate  and  it  also  alters  mineral-surface  properties,  allowing  greater  adsorption. 
Zoledronic acid at 4 mg reduced skeletal related events in prostate cancer patients with bone 
metastases. Zoledronic acid 4 mg is recommended for initial treatment of hypercalcaemia and 
zoledronic acid 8 mg for relapsed or refractory hypercalcaemia.  
The  proposed  indications  for  the  generic  product  are  the  same  as  those  of  the  reference 
product:  
• 
• 
Prevention of skeletal related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation 
or  surgery  to  bone  or  tumour-induced  hypercalcaemia)  in  patients  with  advanced 
malignancies involving bone.  
Treatment of tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). 
Zoledronic acid 4 mg/5 ml, Concentrate for solution for infusion is subject to medical 
prescription. 
According to the Guideline on investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 
1), bioequivalence studies are not required if the test product is to be administered as an 
aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved 
product. As this is the case with Zoledronic Acid Accord, a bioequivalence study is not 
required.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
Zoledronic Acid Accord is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion for intravenous 
use containing  4 mg/ 5mLof zoledronic acid as the active substance. 
Other ingredients are: mannitol, sodium citrate and water for injections. 
Zoledronic Acid Accord - Assessment report 
Assessment report  
EMA/806574/2013 
Page 6/15 
 
  
The product is available in cyclo olefin copolymer vial with chlorobutyl rubber stoppers and 
aluminium seals with flip off cap.  
The pack sizes are consistent with those of the reference product.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
The active substance is not described in the European Pharmacopoeia, pharmacopoeias of the 
member states. 
The chemical name of zoledronic acid is [1-hydroxy-2-(1H-imidazol-1) ethylidene] 
bisphosphonic acid or 2-(imidazol-1-yl)-1-hydroxy-ethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid and has the 
following structure: 
It exists in several crystalline forms; this application uses a hydrate. The molecule does not 
contain any chiral centres, therefore it does not exhibit stereoisomerism.  
Polymorphism is not relevant as the active substance is present in solution in the finished 
product.  
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline powder, non-hygroscopic, slightly 
soluble in water and insoluble in methanol. 
The active is present in the drug product dissolved in water, hence the polymorphic form and 
particle size distribution are not considered as critical quality aspects. The information on the 
active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) procedure. 
Manufacture 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master 
File (ASMF) procedure.  
The active substance is manufactured in 2 steps of chemical synthesis (I and II) and 1 
acidification/purification stage starting from imidazole 1-acetic acid (III). 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Zoledronic Acid Accord - Assessment report 
Assessment report  
EMA/806574/2013 
Page 7/15 
 
  
 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the 
restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Specification 
The active substance specification contains tests for description, solubility, identity by IR and 
HPLC, assay by titration, chromatographic purity anions, impurities by HPLC, pH of the 
solution, Clarity of solution, heavy metals, loss on drying, microbial purity and endotoxins.  
The limits set for specification parameters are acceptable and in line with batch results, 
stability studies and CHMP/ICH guidelines. Analytical methods used are sufficiently described 
and satisfactorily validated in line with the CHMP/ICH requirements.  
Results of analysis of five batches of the active substance were provided. Compliance with the 
specification was demonstrated.  
Stability 
Stability data of 3 batches of the active substance were provided for up to 60 months of 
storage at 30 °C/65 % relative humidity (RH) and 6 months at 40 °C/75 % RH (ICH 
compliant) stored in double polythene bags and kept in polyethylene drums, same as the 
commercial container closure system. Compliance with specification has been confirmed at 
both conditions. Following parameters were tested during stability studies: description and 
solubility, identification, impurities, assay, loss on drying, X-ray diffraction pattern, microbial 
purity and endotoxins.  
Forced degradation studies were performed, where zoledronic acid was subjected to high 
humidity, UV, heat, acid, base and hydrogen peroxide hydrolysis. No significant changes are 
seen during acid or alkaline forced degradation studies. Exposure to an oxidizing agent 
significantly increased the level of 1-Imidazole acetic acid content. No changes are seen after 
UV exposure, high humidity and heat treatment. 
The stability data support the proposed retest. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
Zoledronic  Acid  Accord  is  presented  as  a  clear,  colourless  solution  in  a  clear  cyclo  olefin 
copolymer  vial  with  chlorobutyl  rubber  stopper  and  aluminum  cap  with  flip-off  seal.  This 
medicinal  product  is  supplied  in  vials  as  a  sterile,  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion 
containing 4 mg/5 ml of zoledronic acid. 
The qualitative composition of Zoledronic Acid Accord is the same as the composition of the 
reference product, with mannitol as a tonicity agent, sodium citrate as a buffering agent and 
water for injections as a solvent. All excipients are of compendial quality.  
Zoledronic Acid Accord - Assessment report 
Assessment report  
EMA/806574/2013 
Page 8/15 
 
  
Pre-formulation  and  formulation  development  studies  were  performed.  A  comparison  of 
impurity profile, description, assay and pH of Zoledronic Acid Accord (batch no ASZLEP1005B) 
and Zometa (batch no S0235B) were presented and showed no significant difference. 
Since  the  medicinal  product  is  administered  to  patients  as  an  aqueous  intravenous  solution 
containing the same active substance in the same concentration as the reference product it is 
not required to submit a bioequivalence study. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients of human or animal origin are used in the finished product. Therefore, there is 
no risk of BSE/TSE transmission via this product.  
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process of the finished product consists of preparation of the bulk solution, 
sterile filtration, filling, terminal sterilisation and inspection/packaging. The terminal 
sterilisation is done by autoclaving. The critical steps/parameters in the manufacturing process 
are bulk solution preparation, sterile filtration, sterilisation/depyrogenation of the container 
closure system, filling and terminal sterilisation. Appropriate in-process controls are in place 
after each step.  
Validation of the manufacturing process has been performed on three pilot batches. Holding 
times at each manufacturing step were defined and validated. All results comply with 
specification. A commitment for prospective process validation on the first three consecutive 
production-scale batches of additional batch size of the drug product was provided. 
Product specification  
The specification of the finished product includes standard testing parameters typical for this 
kind of dosage form such as tests for description, identification, clarity and colour of solution, 
particulate contamination, pH, extractable volume, assay, related substances, sterility and 
bacterial endotoxins. The limits proposed are justified according to relevant EU/ICH guidelines, 
Ph. Eur and batch data. All analytical methods have been appropriately validated.  
Batch  analysis  has  been  performed  on  3  pilot  scale  batches  and  the  results  show  that  the 
finished product meets the proposed specifications. 
Stability of the product 
The stability studies were carried out in accordance with the current ICH/CHMP guidelines. All 
tests were conducted by validated, stability indicating analytical methods.  
Stability  results  were  submitted  at  long-term  and  accelerated  ICH  conditions  for  up  to  18 
months and 6 months, respectively. The product was stored in 5 ml/20 mm ready to use cyclo 
olefin  copolymer  vials  with  20  mm  chlorobutyl  plus  stopper  and  20  mm  aluminium  flip  off

violet  seal, the  proposed commercial  container  closure  system.  The  container  closure  system 
complies with EC and Ph.Eur. requirements.  
The  following  paremeters  were  routinely  tested  during  stability  studies:  description,  pH, 
related  substances,  assay,  clarity  and  colour  of  solution.  Particulate  contamination,  sterility 
and bacterial endotoxins are tested periodically. 
Photostability  testing  was  conducted  on  one  commercial  batch.  Conditions  were  chosen 
according  to  the  current  “Note  for  Guidance  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New  Active 
Substances  and  Medicinal  Products  (CPMP/ICH/279/95)”:  The  finished  product  is  not 
susceptible to light.  
In-use  stability  studies  show  that  product  is  stable  for  36  hours  at  2  °C  to  8  °C  after 
reconstitution in 0.9 % sodium chloride solution and 5 % glucose solution.  
The stability results support the shelf-life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in 
clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been 
provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview 
justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with 
Zoledronic Acid Accord - Assessment report 
Assessment report  
EMA/806574/2013 
Page 10/15 
 
  
the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Zoledronic Acid Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare Limited is 
considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
zoledronic acid containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active 
substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for a concentrate for solution for infusion containing 4mg/5ml of 
zoledronic acid. Zoledronic Acid Accord contains the same active substance as Zometa and is 
intended for parenteral administration; in view of this there is no requirement for 
bioequivalence testing (cf.CHMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev.1). 
GCP 
No new clinical data have been presented.   
Exemption  
The product concerned by the application contains the same active ingredient in the same 
concentration as the reference product. It has an identical qualitative and quantitative 
composition in terms of the active substance as its reference medicinal product.  
The product is aqueous concentrate for solution for infusion and contains zoledronic acid as an 
active substance. Excipients are mannitol, sodium citrate and water for injection. Due to the 
parenteral administration mode, bioequivalence can be concluded without further studies and 
as the composition is the same, no differences in non-clinical or clinical effects are possible.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application.  
Zoledronic Acid Accord - Assessment report 
Assessment report  
EMA/806574/2013 
Page 11/15 
 
  
2.4.3.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any 
country. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A clinical overview has been provided, which is based on scientific literature. The overview 
justifies why there is no need to generate additional clinical data. The clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further clinical studies are required.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of zoledronic acid concentrate for solution for 
infusion. The reference product Zometa is indicated for prevention of skeletal related events 
(pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or surgery to bone, or tumour-induced 
hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, and treatment 
of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia (TIH). Non-clinical studies have not 
been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical 
information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s 
clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was 
considered sufficient. 
Bioequivalence studies were not required as the test product is to be administered as an 
aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently approved 
product. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the 
chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation 
activities are required beyond those included in the product information.

4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Zoledronic Acid Accord in the prevention of skeletal 
related events (pathological fractures, spinal compression, radiation or surgery to bone, or 
tumour-induced hypercalcaemia) in adult patients with advanced malignancies involving bone, 
and treatment of adult patients with tumour-induced hypercalcaemia is favourable and 
therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Disease or condition 
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancers in the US and Europe, ranking as 
the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women (American Cancer Society 2018, Ferlay et al 2013).  
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention  
In 2018, it is estimated that there will be 22,240 newly diagnosed ovarian cancer cases in the US and 
approximately 14,070 people will die from ovarian cancer (American Cancer Society 2018). Across Europe, 
the age standardised rate in 2018 was 16.7/100,000 and the mortality was 10.7/100,000 (ECIS 2018). 
Ovarian cancer remains one of the most difficult cancers to diagnose at an early curable stage. 75% of 
patients present with advanced disease (Stage III or IV) (Hennessy et al 2009). The majority of patients die 
from their disease, with 5-year survival rates only 29% for advanced stages (Siegel et al 2018).  
Biologic features 
Epithelial ovarian cancer comprises the majority of malignant ovarian neoplasm (about 90%) (Chan JK et al 
2006; Jelovac D et al. 2011). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of surface epithelial 
ovarian tumours includes six major histotypes - serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, transitional cell 
and epithelial-stromal. The serous subtype of ovarian carcinoma accounts for approximately 60-80% of 
ovarian cancer cases and is the most aggressive type of ovarian cancer.  
Grade is an additional prognostic determinant and a number of grading systems currently exist which are 
derived from reviewing the following tumour characteristics: architectural features, mitotic counts and 
nuclear atypia (ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines, 2013). Low grade (grade 1, well differentiated) serous 
ovarian carcinoma is considered a distinct type of disease compared with high grade (grade 2 and 3 – 
moderately and poorly differentiated) serous carcinoma based on a number of clinical and molecular 
features, thus forming a 2 tier classification of low and high grade disease widely accepted and used in 
clinical practice (Levanon et al 2008; Vang et al 2009). 
The classification based on molecular pathogenesis divides epithelial tumours into type 1 and type 2 ovarian 
carcinomas. While Type 1 tumours are characterized by specific mutations in KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, PTEN and 
PIK3CA but rarely TP53 and are relatively genetically stable, type 2 tumours are characterised by nearly 
universal TP53, which makes them genetically highly unstable (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 
2011, Ledermann et al, 2013).  Moreover, recent evidence suggests that serous and endometrioid 
carcinomas arise from the tubal fimbrae, suggesting similar biology and origin for the high grade epithelial 
histologies (Jayson et al 2014). Pennington et al (2014) reported DNA repair deficiencies in carcinomas with 
serous and non-serous histology. 
Platinum predominantly causes large-scale DNA intra-strand cross-links which require a competent 
homologous recombination pathway for effective repair. Given that platinum sensitivity and PARP inhibitor 
sensitivity may converge at the homologous recombination pathway, it was possible that platinum 
responsiveness may be also enrich for PARP inhibitor sensitivity (Mukhopadhyay et al 2010).  Clinical data 
support the hypothesis that platinum sensitive tumours are more sensitive to PARP inhibitors than platinum 
resistant tumours (Matulonis et al 2016). Thus, while BRCA mutations and HRD might represent biological 
markers of sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, platinum responsiveness may be a clinical indicator of sensitivity to 
these compounds. 
New emerging data suggest that PARP inhibitor sensitivity is broader than BRCA1/2  and HRR deficiencies 
and may extend to non-HRR DNA damage response deficiencies and pathways as well (Postel-Vinay et al 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 7/109 
 
  
  
2013, Cerrato et al, 2016, Murata et al, 2016, Lu et al 2017). Moreover, it has been reported that 51% of 
high-grade serous ovarian cancer have compromised homologous recombination-based repair (Cooke et al. 
2011). It is assumed that somatic BRCA and homologous repair deficiency (HRD) status refer to samples at 
time of diagnosis/primary surgery. Advanced tumours are normally heterogeneous and may be so also for 
somatic BRCA mutations/HRD. The selective pressure of platinum therapy is at least partly reflected in time 
to recurrence so that late recurrences may increase the likelihood of positive findings with respect to 
sBRCA/HRD. In addition reversion of gBRCA mutations is a well described mechanism associated with 
resistance development.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Early stage ovarian cancer is often asymptomatic and therefore difficult to detect. For women who do 
experience symptoms in the early stages, ovarian cancer is sometimes misdiagnosed because the majority 
of symptoms are nonspecific. These symptoms may overlap those of gastrointestinal and other diseases, 
and as a result, many patients may be treated incorrectly for months or years.  
The definitive diagnosis and staging of ovarian cancer is by surgery, and cytological or histological 
examination of tissue samples.  
The Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) surgical staging system is used for epithelial ovarian 
cancer and primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma. Because the disease tends to be asymptomatic in early 
stages, or associated with vague, non-specific symptoms, the majority of patients are diagnosed with 
advanced stage disease.  
The advanced stage at which ovarian cancer is generally detected is reflected in the 5-year survival rates; 
46% across all stages and 29% for advanced stages (Siegel et al 2017). Even though, over 80% of patients 
respond to initial platinum-based chemotherapy treatment, the majority subsequently relapse (Colombo et 
al 2010). 
Despite best current standard of care for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer patients, approximately 
70% of patients relapse within the first three years and become largely incurable (Ledermann et al 2013).  
Recurrent disease is classified as platinum resistant or platinum sensitive, depending on whether the disease 
recurred less than or greater than 6 months following previous platinum therapy, and this classification is 
highly prognostic and is important in determining optimal chemotherapeutic treatment options. 
Recurrent disease is incurable, and the challenge is to balance aggressive treatment in an effort to prolong 
disease-free time, while maintaining a tolerable side-effect profile and quality of life (Lancet 2009). Most 
patients will die within 3 to 4 years of diagnosis [Coleman et al 2013]. 
Management 
The current standard of care for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, including those patients with 
BRCAm high-risk ovarian cancer, consists of radical debulking surgery followed by post-operative 
platinum-based first line chemotherapy (NCCN Ovarian 2019). 
In terms of impact on clinical outcome of residual disease post cytoreductive surgery, based on prospective 
analysis of 3 multicentre Phase III randomised, controlled clinical studies, it has been shown that patients 
with complete surgical resection have improved prognosis as compared to patients in optimal resection 
(1-10 mm) or those with residual macroscopic disease (> 1 cm) (du Bois et al 2009). As a result, ESMO 
clinical guidelines as well as other international guidelines stipulate that in advanced epithelial ovarian 
cancer, the aim is complete cytoreduction of all macroscopic visible disease, since this has been shown to be 
associated with a significantly increased OS and PFS (Ledermann et al 2013). 
For patients for whom upfront surgery is unlikely to achieve a complete resection, treatment consists of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (NCCN 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 8/109 
 
  
  
Ovarian 2019). First line chemotherapy is generally given for a maximum of 6 cycles. It cannot be continued 
until progression as it is associated with cumulative neurological, renal, and haematological toxicities. 
Moreover, clinical outcomes do not improve if chemotherapy is extended beyond 6 cycles (Ledermann et al 
2013). Since chemotherapy is not a viable treatment option in the maintenance setting, there is a need for 
a well-tolerated maintenance treatment option in the first line setting. The vascular endothelial growth 
factor inhibitor bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by 
bevacizumab maintenance is the only treatment approved in the first line maintenance ovarian cancer 
setting.  
Several PARP inhibitors including olaparib are approved for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer 
who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. However there is currently no 
PARP inibitors approved for the first line maintenance treatment. 
There are currently no first line maintenance treatments approved specifically for BRCAm patients with 
advanced ovarian cancer and these patients receive the same treatment options as all other ovarian cancer 
patients. Bevacizumab is an available maintenance treatment option regardless of BRCA status however, 
subgroup analyses from the GOG-218 study based on mutation in homologous recombination repair (HRR) 
genes, the majority of which (74%) were BRCAm (BRCA1 148 [12.4%] patients, BRCA2 78 [6.5%] patients, 
other HRR genes 81 [6.8%] patients) demonstrated no significant interaction for the effect of bevacizumab 
based on HRR mutational status, with modest benefit observed in both subgroups: PFS in the subgroup of 
patients with HRRm (n=228): HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71-1.26, and PFS in the subgroup of patients with no HRR 
mutation (n=581): HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 0.85. In both the GOG-218 and ICON7 trials, bevacizumab 
treatment was shown to be associated with significant toxicity, including but not limited to hypertension, 
neutropenia, venous thromboembolic events, febrile neutropenia, wound healing complication, and 
gastrointestinal perforation/fistula/abscess (Gonzalez et al 2013). 
About the product 
The active substance of Lynparza is olaparib, a potent oral human PARP inhibitor (PARP-1, PARP-2, and 
PARP-3) that exploits deficiencies in DNA repair pathways to preferentially kill cancer cells with these deficits 
compared to normal cells. 
Olaparib  was  initially  approved  in  December  2014  as  a  capsule  formulation  in  monotherapy  for  the 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive relapsed BRCA mutated (germline and/or 
somatic)  high  grade  serous  epithelial  ovarian,  fallopian  tube,  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  who  are  in 
response (complete response or partial response) to platinum based chemotherapy. The recommended dose 
of Lynparza is 400 mg (eight capsules) taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 800 mg.  
The  tablet  formulation  was  subsequently  approved in  May  2018  for  the  maintenance  treatment  of  adult 
patients with platinum sensitive relapsed high grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal 
cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum based chemotherapy. The recommended dose 
of Lynparza is 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 600 mg. The 
100 mg tablet is available for dose reduction. 
Lynparza tablet formulation has also recently been approved as monotherapy for the treatment of adult 
patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutations, who have HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer (see SmPC section 4.1). 
In  the  present  application,  the  MAH  is  applying  for  a  new  indication  for  olaparib  (tablet  formulation)  as 
follows: Lynparza is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with newly 
diagnosed advanced BRCA1/2-mutated high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal 
cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to first line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 9/109 
 
  
  
The recommendation indication is: Lynparza is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of 
adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) BRCA1/2-mutated (germline and/or somatic) 
high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or 
partial) following completion of first line platinum-based chemotherapy. (see SmPC section 4.1). 
Before Lynparza treatment is initiated for first-line maintenance treatment of high-grade epithelial ovarian 
cancer (EOC), fallopian tube cancer (FTC), or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC), patients must have 
confirmation of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic mutations in the breast cancer 
susceptibility genes (BRCA) 1 or 2 using a validated test. 
There is no requirement for BRCA1/2 testing prior to using Lynparza for the maintenance treatment of 
relapsed EOC, FTC or PPC who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based therapy. 
Genetic counselling for patients tested for mutations in BRCA1/2 genes should be performed according to 
local regulations.  
The recommended dose of Lynparza is 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) taken twice daily, equivalent to a total 
daily dose of 600 mg. The 100 mg tablet is available for dose reduction. 
Patients should start treatment with Lynparza no later than 8 weeks after completion of their final dose of the 
platinum containing regimen. 
Patients can continue treatment until radiological disease progression, unacceptable toxicity  or for to 2 
years if there is no radiological evidence of disease after 2 years of treatment. Patients with evidence of 
disease at 2 years, who in the opinion of the treating physician can derive further benefit from continuous 
treatment, can be treated beyond 2 years (see SmPC section 4.2). 
While for patients with platinum sensitive relapsed high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary 
peritoneal cancer (already approved indication), it is recommended that treatment be continued until 
progression of the underlying disease or unacceptable toxicity. 
Treatment may be interrupted or dose may be reduced to manage adverse reactions such as nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea and anaemia and dose reduction can be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP.

BRCA1/2 testing and concordance 
Central germline BRCA1/2 testing and concordance with local germline testing 
The methodology to classify BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants and to define those that lead to loss of function was 
based  upon  the  American  College  of  Medical  Genetics  and  Genomics  (ACMG)  recommendations  for 
standards  for  interpretation  and  reporting  of  sequence  variants  (Richards  et  al  2015).  A  variety  of 
classifications is currently used taking into account these recommendations. Criteria and evidence used to 
classify variants at Myriad have been established in accordance with ACMG guidelines and standards. BRCA1 
and BRCA2 variants are classified into one of the five categories, with deleterious or suspected deleterious 
variants corresponding to class 1 or 2 of the ACMG classification. Patients with variants corresponding to 
other categories, including variants of uncertain significance (VUS) have not been considered for eligibility. 
Patients randomised to SOLO1 using a local germline BRCA1/2 result were retested post-randomisation prior 
to database lock using mainly the Myriad Integrated BRACAnalysis test. Of the 383 patients confirmed to 
have deleterious (95.3%) or suspected deleterious (4.7%) status, 253 and 130 were randomised to the 
olaparib and placebo arm, respectively. Large rearrangements in the BRCA1/2 genes were detected in 5.5% 
(21/383) of the randomised patients.  
In patients where BRCA1/2 mutation status was determined by local BRCA and Myriad germline testing, the 
results were highly concordant (only 3 patients with discordant results between local and Myriad confirmed 
subset). One patient entered the study with a local gBRCAm result and was later classified by Myriad as 
BRCA VUS. 
The  Myriad  gBRCAm  population  represents  patients  who  were  determined  either  prospectively  or 
retrospectively as carrying deleterious or suspected deleterious mutation in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 (please

Retrospective central tumour testing and concordance with central germline testing 
Archival tumour tissue samples were requested for all randomised patients and were profiled retrospectively 
tested prior to database lock using the FoundationOne CDx Clinical Trial Assay performed at Foundation 
Medicine (FMI). Variant classification at FMI is conducted according to defined criteria into 4 classification 
categories, including the eligible known or likely pathogenic variants. 
In total, for 87.2% (341/391) of patients representing the Foundation Medicine tBRCAm population tumour 
samples were successfully tested (no tumour sample was available for testing in 5 patients and the tBRCA 
result was not reported in 45 patients with available tumour samples). Among these 341 patients 95% had 
an eligible mutation (known [n=47] or likely pathogenic [n=277]) and 2 gBRCAwt patients were confirmed 
to have sBRCAm only. (please refer to the efficacy data in the ancillary analyses part) 
The  overall  concordance  between  the  FMI  tBRCA  test  and  the  Myriad  gBRCA  for  reporting  of  germline 
variants was 95%. The FMI tBRCA test reported an extra 2 eligible patients (35 variants). The majority of 
discordant cases (55.5%, 10 out of 18) were due to large rearrangements reported by Myriad that were not 
detected by the FMI tBRCA test. Of note 2 of the 18 discordant cases carry true somatic mutations that 
entered the study with a local tBRCAm result and could not be detected by the Myriad germline test (Table 
below). These 2 patients were both in the olaparib arm.

Locus specific loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 
Using the SGZ ((somatic-germline-zygosity) computational method to predict somatic vs. germline origin 
and  homozygous  vs.  heterozygous  or  sub-clonal  state  of  variants  (Sun  et  al,  2018),  the  results  of 
BRCA-locus specific LOH have been provided in the F1CDx CTA tBRCAm cohort.

The Foundation Medicine LOH score reflects a measure of % genomic LOH (‘the LOH score’), without 
combination with additional measures of genomic instability (telomeric allelic imbalance and large-scale 
state transitions).

A high proportion of SOLO1 tumours with an evaluable FMI LOH score, had a score above or equal to 14% 
(84%, 237/283) or 16% (77%, 218/283).  
The PFS of patients in SOLO1 considered to be HRD negative according to the FMI LOH test (with both the 
14% and 16% cut-offs) were explored (IEMT1546).

TP53 mutations 
Sequencing data for TP53 was available for all SOLO1 tumour samples analysed using the F1CDx CTA. 96% 
(329/341) of SOLO1 tumour samples sequenced at FMI harboured a mutation in TP53 predicted to affect 
protein function.  
Using the same classification schemes as described for Study 19 (Molina-Vila et al 2014; Poeta et al 2007) 
52% (170/329) of TP53 mutations in SOLO1 were predicted to be disruptive and 48% (159/329) 
non-disruptive in nature.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology data were submitted as part of this application. The current clinical 
pharmacology package provides sufficient characterisation of the key pharmacokinetics characteristics of 
olaparib. When combined with in vitro drug metabolism and PK profiling data and in vivo DDI studies, it 
provides sufficient data supporting adequate information for special populations and DDI in the product 
information.  
The pharmacodynamics of olaparib was investigated in studies with the capsule formulation and some 
additional data is also available from studies conducted with the tablet formulation.

Exploratory genetic analysis of tumour samples from the study 19 was provided in previous applications and 
biomarkers of HRD will be further studied in planned and ongoing studies, including the requested OPINION 
study (see current Annex II) and ORZORA study (see current Annex II). In line with previous 
recommendations in relation to Lynparza, the MAH is recommended to further investigate the prognostic 
and predictive value of tests that would allow quantitative assessment of genomic instability and 
homologous recombination deficiencies in patients with specific mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 and other 
HRR-related genes. The assessment of data in patients with large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 genes is also recommended. Further, the MAH is recommended to investigate tumour heterogeneity 
and mechanisms of resistance in patients with BRCA-mutated tumours and tumours harbouring mutations in 
HRR-related genes. In addition to the above-mentioned studies, data will become available from the LIGHT 
study (NCT02983799), a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study assessing the efficacy 
and safety of olaparib tablets in subjects with platinum-sensitive or partially platinum-sensitive, relapsed, 
high-grade serous or high-grade endometrioid epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal 
cancer, who have received at least 1 prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy.  
The MAH presented results from the analysis of the tumour samples from SOLO1. An FMI LOH score cut-off 
of 14% was determined to identify HRD high tumours, using survival data from the TCGA high-grade serous 
ovarian cancer dataset and tested prospectively as part of the ARIEL2 study (Swisher et al 2017). 
Subsequently, on the basis of retrospective analysis of data from ARIEL2 part 1, a cut-off of 16% or greater 
was determined as being the optimal discriminator for high genomic LOH in the ARIEL3 study (Coleman et 
al 2017). As the tumour samples from SOLO1 patients have been tested using the Foundation One Clinical 
Trial Assay (F1CDx CTA), a % genomic LOH score was provided as part of the advanced analytics from FMI. 
Data showed that (i) from evaluable tumours, 99% have been reported to harbour BRCA1/2 locus-specific 
LOH, (ii) the benefit of olaparib over placebo was similar in both the HRD positive and negative subgroups by 
LOH score. The MAH is recommended to provide the OS data by HRD score and TP53 mutation status in 
comparison with available data from previous studies (Study 19 and SOLO2) at the time when the updated 
OS analysis at higher maturity rates is available. 
The SmPC adequately reflects that local or central testing of blood or tumour samples for BRCA1/2 
mutations has been used in different studies. Depending on the test used and the international classification 
consensus, the BRCA1/2 mutations have been identified as deleterious/suspected deleterious or 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic. Genetic testing should be conducted by an experienced laboratory using a 
validated test. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, there is sufficient information available on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic of olaparib 
tablets to support the use in the applied indication.

This was a Phase III, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre study to assess the efficacy 
of olaparib maintenance monotherapy in advanced (FIGO Stage III-IV) ovarian cancer patients (including 
patients with primary peritoneal and/or fallopian tube cancer) with BRCA mutations (documented mutation 
in  BRCA1  or  BRCA2)  that  were  predicted  to  be  loss  of  function  mutations  (known  or  predicted  to  be 
detrimental/lead to loss of function) who had responded following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Study participants 
Inclusion criteria 
1- Patients must have been ≥18 years of age. 
2- Female patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, advanced (FIGO Stage III or IV) BRCA 
mutated high grade serous or high grade endometrioid (based on local histopathological findings) ovarian 
cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and/or fallopian-tube cancer who had completed first-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy (intravenous or intraperitoneal).  
3-Stage III patients must have had 1 attempt at optimal debulking surgery (upfront or interval debulking). 
Stage IV patients must have had either a biopsy and/or upfront or interval debulking surgery.

5-Patients  who  had  completed  first-line  platinum  (eg,  carboplatin  or  cisplatin),  containing  therapy 
(intravenous or intraperitoneal) prior to randomisation: 
-Patients had, in the opinion of the investigator, clinical CR or PR and had no clinical evidence of disease 
progression on the post-treatment scan or a rising CA-125 level, following completion of this chemotherapy 
course.  Patients  with  stable  disease  (SD)  on  the  post-treatment  scan  at  completion  of  first  line 
platinum-containing therapy were not eligible for the study. 
-Platinum-based  chemotherapy  course  must  have  consisted  of  a  minimum  of  6  treatment  cycles  and  a 
maximum of 9, however if platinum-based therapy was discontinued early as a result of toxicities specifically 
related  to  the  platinum  regimen,  patients  must  have  received  a  minimum  of  4  cycles  of  the  platinum 
regimen. 
-Patients  must  not  have  received  bevacizumab  during  their  first-line  course  of  treatment,  either  in 
combination or as maintenance therapy following combination therapy. 
-Patients must not have received an investigational agent during their first-line course of chemotherapy. 
-Patients were to be randomised within 8 weeks after their last dose of chemotherapy (last dose is the day 
of the last infusion). 
6-Pre-treatment CA-125 measurements must have met a criterion specified below: 
- If the first value was less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) the patient was eligible to be 
randomised and a second sample was not required. 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 16/109 
 
  
  
- If the first value was greater than ULN a second assessment was performed at least 7 days after the first. 
If the second assessment was ≥15% more than the first the patient was not eligible.

9- Patients must have had a life expectancy ≥16 weeks. 
10- Postmenopausal or evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential: negative 
urine or serum pregnancy test prior to Myriad BRCA test during screening Part 1, within 28 days of study 
treatment and confirmed prior to treatment on Day 1*. 
11-  Patient  was  willing  and  able  to  comply  with  the  protocol  for  the  duration  of  the  study  including 
undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations*. 
12  A  formalin  fixed,  paraffin  embedded  tumour  sample  from the  primary  cancer  was  to  be  available  for 
central testing. If there was no written confirmation of the availability of an archived tumour sample prior to 
enrolment the patient was not eligible for the study*. 
BRCA status 
This study was designed to recruit gBRCAm based on local or central testing or sBRCAm patients based on 
local  testing.  Patients  known  to  have  BRCA  mutations  (gBRCA  ie,  blood  or  tBRCA  ie,  tumour)  prior  to 
randomisation could enter the study based on this result providing that all such testing had been undertaken 
in appropriately accredited laboratories (ie, testing done for research only was not acceptable). In addition, 
the patients must have consented to provide 2 blood samples. One sample was used for a confirmatory 
gBRCA test post randomisation using either the Myriad Integrated BRACAnalysis, the Myriad BRACAnalysis 
CDx (gene sequencing and large rearrangement analysis) or BGI test (patients in China). The second blood 
sample was collected to enable any bridging study to validate the companion diagnostic test for olaparib, if 
needed. 
Patients with unknown BRCA status must have consented to provide 2 blood samples for gBRCA testing and 
followed all local ethical procedures for genetic testing. When the result from the Myriad/BGI test indicated 
the patient did have a loss of function (deleterious or suspected deleterious) BRCA mutation, the patient was 
randomised  into  the  study  (provided  they  had  fulfilled  all  other  screening  requirements).  There  was  no 
prospective  central  testing  of  tumour  samples  at  randomisation,  only  retrospective  analysis  (see 
pharmacodynamics part). 
Main exclusion criteria 
1-BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations that were considered to be non-detrimental (eg, “variants of uncertain 
clinical  significance”  or  “variant  of  unknown  significance”  or  “variant,  favour  polymorphism”  or  “benign 
polymorphism” etc). 
2-Patients with early stage disease (FIGO Stage I, IIA, IIB or IIC). 
3-SD or progressive disease (PD) on the post-treatment scan or clinical evidence of progression at the end 
of the patient’s first line chemotherapy treatment. 
4-Patients where more than 1 debulking surgery had been performed before randomisation to the study. 
(Patients who, at the time of diagnosis, were deemed to be unresectable and underwent only a biopsy or 
oophorectomy but then went on to receive chemotherapy and interval debulking surgery were eligible). 
5-Patients  who  had  previously  been  diagnosed  and  treated  for  earlier  stage  ovarian,  fallopian  tube  or 
primary peritoneal cancer. 
Assessment report

6-Patients  who  had  previously  received  chemotherapy  for  any  abdominal  or  pelvic  tumour,  including 
treatment for prior diagnosis at an earlier stage for their ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer. 
(Patients who had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for localised breast cancer may have been eligible, 
provided that it was completed more than three years prior to registration, and that the patient remained 
free of recurrent or metastatic disease). 
7-Patients with synchronous primary endometrial cancer unless both of the following criteria were met: 
(a) Stage <2 
(b) Less than 60 years old at the time of diagnosis of endometrial cancer with Stage IA or IB Grade 1 or 2, 
or Stage IA Grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma OR ≥60 years old at the time of diagnosis of endometrial 
cancer  with  Stage  IA  Grade  1  or  2  endometrioid  adenocarcinoma.  Patients  with  serous  or  clear  cell

treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ, Stage 1, Grade 1 endometrial carcinoma, or 
other solid tumours including lymphomas (without bone marrow involvement) curatively treated with NED 
for  ≥5  years.  Patients  with  a  history  of  localised  breast  cancer  may  have  been  eligible,  provided  they 
completed  their  adjuvant  chemotherapy  more  than  3  years  prior  to  registration,  and  remained  free  of 
recurrent or metastatic disease. 
-Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) with correct QT interval (QTc) >470 msec on 2 or more time points within 
a 24 hour period or family history of long QT syndrome.

Treatments 
Table 6: Details of study drugs 
Patients will be administered their randomised study treatment tablets orally at a dose of 300mg twice daily. 
This tablet dose has been approved in a number of countries for use in patients with ovarian and metastatic 
breast cancers. Doses of study treatment should be taken at the same times each day approximately 12 
hours apart.  
Patients should continue to receive study treatment for up to two years or until objective radiological disease 
progression  as  per  RECIST  as  assessed  by  the  investigator,  whichever  is  earlier,  and  as  long  as  in  the 
investigator’s opinion they are benefiting from treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation 
criteria. A decision about continuing treatment with the study drug beyond 2 years was made after assessing 
the patient’s disease status according to modified RECIST guidelines at Week 108, and/or by assessing the 
patient’s clinical condition. Patients should continue with study treatment to RECIST progression despite 
rises in CA- 125. Patients who continue to have evidence of stable disease at two years may continue to 
receive study treatment if, in the opinion of the investigator, it is in the patient’s best interest. However, if 
at two years the patient has no evidence of disease, study treatment should be discontinued. 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
To determine the efficacy by PFS (using investigator assessment of scans according to modified Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] 1.1 for measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target 
lesions and the objective tumour response criteria) of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared with 
placebo in BRCA mutated high risk advanced ovarian cancer patients who are in clinical CR or PR following 
first line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Secondary objectives 
-To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared with placebo by assessment of 
OS,  time  to  earliest  progression  by  RECIST  or  cancer  antigen-125  (CA-125),  or  death,  and  time  from 
randomisation to second progression (PFS2). 
-To determine the efficacy of olaparib maintenance monotherapy compared with placebo by assessment of 
time from randomisation to first subsequent therapy or death (TFST), time from randomisation to second 
subsequent therapy or death (TSST) and time from randomisation to study treatment discontinuation or 
death (TDT). 
-To compare the effects of olaparib maintenance monotherapy with placebo on Health-Related Quality of Life 
(HRQoL) as assessed by the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – 
Ovarian (FACT-O). 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 19/109 
 
  
  
 
-To assess efficacy of olaparib in patients identified as having a deleterious or suspected deleterious variant 
in either of the BRCA genes using variants identified with current and potential future BRCA mutation assays 
(gene sequencing and large rearrangement analysis). 
Safety objective 
The  safety  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  olaparib  maintenance 
monotherapy  in  BRCA  mutated  high  risk  advanced  ovarian  cancer  patients  who  are  in  clinical  CR  or  PR 
following first line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary outcome variable 
Progression free survival 
PFS was defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective radiological disease progression 
according to RECIST or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient 
discontinued randomised therapy or received another anticancer therapy prior to progression (ie, date of 
RECIST progression/death or censoring date of randomisation+1). 
Secondary outcome variables 
Time from randomisation to second progression 
PFS2  was  defined  as  the  time  from  the  date  of  randomisation  to  the  earliest  of  the  progression  event 
(radiological, CA-125 or symptomatic progression) subsequent to that used for the primary variable PFS or 
death. 
Overall survival 
OS was defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death due to any cause. Any patient not 
known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last  recorded date on which the 
patient was known to be alive. 
Time from randomisation to start of first subsequent therapy or death and time from randomisation to start 
of second subsequent therapy or death 
TFST was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the earlier of the date of therapy start date 
following study treatment discontinuation, or death and indicates clinical deterioration requiring further 
treatment.     
TSST was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the earlier of the date of second subsequent 
therapy start date following study treatment discontinuation, or death and was assessed to improve 
understanding of the longer term benefit of olaparib maintenance therapy in the proposed target population. 
Time to study discontinuation or death 
TDT was defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the earlier of the date of study treatment 
discontinuation or death. 
Time to earliest progression by RECIST 1.1, CA-125 or death 
Time to progression by RECIST or CA-125 progression or death was defined as the time from randomisation 
to the earlier date of RECIST or CA-125 progression or death by any cause.  
Assessment report

Page 20/109 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Investigators were instructed to continue scans until RECIST progression even in the presence of a clinical 
CA-125 progression. 
Best overall RECIST response 
It was the best response a patient had during their time in the study following randomisation but prior to 
starting any subsequent cancer therapy and prior to RECIST progression or the last evaluable assessment in 
the absence of RECIST progression. 
Patient-reported outcomes 
The main endpoint for HRQoL analysis was the TOI, an established single targeted index derived from the 
FACT-O questionnaire. 
Sample size 
The primary endpoint of the study was PFS. In total, 206 PFS events in the study would have 90% power to 
show statistically significant PFS at the 2-sided 5% level if the assumed true treatment effect were HR 0.62; 
this  translates  to  a  8  months  benefit  in  median  PFS  over  13  months  on  placebo  (estimated  from  data 
reported by Alsop et al 2012) if PFS is exponentially distributed. Approximately 344 patients were planned 
to be recruited (2:1 ratio) so that data maturity for the PFS analysis was approximately 60%. No further 
analyses of PFS were planned beyond this point unless requested by Health Authorities. An initial analysis of 
OS was performed at the time of the PFS analysis. PFS was analysed when approximately 198 events had 
occurred (approximately 50% maturity) or after the last patient randomised had the opportunity to have 
been on the study for at least 36 months, whichever came first as emerging data suggested that the original 
assumptions that were used to design the study were likely to have been underestimated. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised using an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Web Response 
System in a 2:1 ratio to the treatments as specified below: 
-Olaparib tablets orally 300 mg bd 
-Placebo tablets orally bd 
Patients were to be randomised within 8 weeks after their last dose of chemotherapy (last dose was the day 
of the last infusion). 
Randomisation was stratified by: 
-Response to first line platinum chemotherapy (in the opinion of the investigator, clinical CR or PR). 
Clinical CR was defined as no evidence of RECIST measurable or non-measurable disease on the end of 
chemotherapy scan and a normal CA-125. PR  was  defined as ≥30% reduction in RECIST measurable or 
non-measurable disease demonstrated from the start to finish of previous chemotherapy OR no radiological 
evidence of disease on the end of chemotherapy scan with a CA-125 which had not decreased to within the 
normal range.

Blinding (masking) 
The study was double blinded.  
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint PFS was analysed using a log-rank test stratified by response to first-line platinum 
chemotherapy (in the opinion of the investigator, clinical CR or PR) for generation of the p-value and using 
the Breslow approach for handling ties. The hazard ratio (HR) and confidence interval (CI) were estimated 
from a Cox Proportional Hazards model (with ties=Efron and the stratification variable as a covariate); the 
CI was calculated using a profile likelihood approach. Stratification variables were defined according to data 
from the interactive voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS) as per the version 4 of the protocol. 
A  Kaplan-Meier  (KM)  plot  of  PFS  was  presented  by  treatment  group.  Summaries  of  the  number  and 
percentage of patients experiencing a PFS event, and the type of event (RECIST or death) were provided 
along with median PFS and corresponding 95% CI for each treatment. The proportion and corresponding 
95% CI of patients alive and progression free at 6 monthly intervals was summarised (using the KM plot) 
and presented by treatment group. 
In addition, the following analyses were performed: 
-Sensitivity analyses to the main analyses of PFS, PFS2, OS, TDT, TFST, and TSST were performed in those 
patients whose gBRCAm status was determined by the Myriad test or tBRCAm status was determined by the 
Foundation Medicine tumour test. 
-Further sensitivity analyses for PFS: 
•  Stratified log-rank tests were used to assess for possible evaluation time bias, attrition bias, and   
ascertainment bias (PFS based on BICR assessment). 
• 
• 
Investigator-reported PFS using eCRF stratification variables. 
Potential impact of informative censoring (using BICR). 
•  A stratified log-rank test using U and V statistics to calculate HR and CI was performed, based on 
investigator data, to assess the robustness of the primary analysis methodology with regards to the 
derivation of the HR and associated CI. 
•  A sensitivity analysis for the proportion of patients progression-free at 24 months was performed. 
-Additional analysis for PFS: 
• 
The earliest of investigator/BICR assessment of progression. 
PFS, PFS2, TDT, TFST, TSST, change from baseline in trial outcome index (TOI) score and OS were tested at 
a 2-sided significance level of 5%. In order to strongly control the type I error at 2.5% 1-sided, a multiple 
testing procedure (MTP)  was employed across the primary endpoint (PFS) and key secondary endpoints 
(PFS2 and OS). Specifically, PFS2 was tested only after statistical significance was shown for PFS. OS was 
tested only after the null hypotheses were rejected for PFS and PFS2. The MTP will recycle the test mass to 
the endpoint not yet rejected in the hierarchy. 
Interim analyses of PFS2 and OS were carried out at the time of the PFS analysis, and the same methodology 
and model was used. At the time of the PFS analysis, statistical significance was declared for PFS2 since 
statistical significance was shown for PFS and the 1-sided p-value for PFS2 was p<0.0125. No further PFS2 
comparison was planned to be conducted. Statistical significance for OS was not declared at this time and 
the  final  OS  analysis  is  planned  to  occur  at  approximately  235  OS  events,  when  approximately  60%  of 
deaths have occurred.

The primary statistical analysis of the efficacy of olaparib included all patients who were randomised as part 
of the global enrolment. The primary analysis compared the treatment groups on the basis of randomised 
treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. Patients who were randomised as part of the global 
enrolment but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment were included in the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS). The analysis population for HRQoL data is the subset of the FAS (ITT set). 
There was no pre-specified hypothesis and alpha allocation for the HRQoL analysis. Change from baseline in 
TOI score was analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of the change from 
baseline (defined as prior to first dose) in TOI scores for each visit. The main analysis was the comparison of 
the average treatment effect from the point of randomisation for the first 24 months (include analysis of data 
obtained within the first 24 months unless there is excessive missing data (defined as >75% missing data). 
For each subscale of FACT-O, if at least 50% of the items are missing, that subscale also will be treated as 
missing. It was expected that the stability in “HRQoL” over the 24 months following start of randomised 
treatment would be longer for patients randomised to olaparib than placebo.

In total, 1084 patients underwent clinical screening for entry onto the SOLO1 global study and 391 patients 
were randomised, 210 (53.7%) with a local BRCA result (blood or tumour, including 2 patients from China) 
and 181 (46.3%) following central gBRCAm determination based on a prospectively conducted Myriad 
Integrated BRAC Analysis (n=178) or BGI (n=3) gBRCAm test result. In total, 387 (99.0%) patients were 
randomised on the basis of a germline result, 2 (0.5%) patients on the basis of a tumour result and 2 (0.5%) 
patients for which the site did not report the sample of origin.

Outcomes and estimation 
The  DCO  for  the  analysis  of  PFS  (17  May  2018)  took  place  when  198  progression  events  had  occurred 
(~50% maturity), approximately 56 months after the first patient was randomised. At this DCO, all efficacy, 
QoL and safety variables were analysed, as appropriate, based on the amount of data available at that time. 
Primary variable: progression-free survival by investigator assessment 
PFS (based on investigator assessment) was the primary variable for the study and was analysed at the 
primary  DCO  (17  May  2018)  on  the  FAS  population.  The  progression  status  based  on  investigator 
assessment at the time of PFS analysis is presented below.

Secondary variables 
Time from randomisation to second progression or death 
PFS2 events were based on radiological, CA-125 or symptomatic progression as assessed by the investigator 
or death. Of the patients who had a second progression, in both treatment arms the majority were based on 
radiological assessment. At the time of DCO there were 121 PFS2 events (30.9% maturity) with a higher 
proportion in the placebo arm than the olaparib arm.

Overall survival 
At the time of the DCO, 70.4% of patients in the olaparib arm and 69.5% of patients in the placebo arm were 
alive and in survival follow-up. At the time of the PFS analysis, the interim OS data were immature (82/391 
events, 21.0% maturity) and the median OS was not reached in either treatment arm. Final OS analysis will 
be conducted at approximately 60% maturity.

Subsequent therapies 
Of  the  patients  who  progressed,  90.1%  (82/91)  of  patients  received  subsequent  chemotherapy  in  the 
olaparib arm compared with 92.5% (86/93) of patients in the placebo arm. Furthermore, out of the patients 
who received a first subsequent therapy, best response as assessed by the investigator (complete or partial) 
was similar between the olaparib and placebo arms  (40.7% [37/91] vs 48.4% [45/93], respectively). A 
similar proportion of patients in the olaparib and placebo arms (6.9% vs 5.3%, respectively) received no 
further therapy after they progressed. 
Out of the patients who received subsequent anticancer treatment, the most common regimen was 
platinum-based chemotherapy (58/91 [63.7%] olaparib-treated patients vs 50/94 [53.2%] placebo-treated 
patients. Other chemotherapies (excluding platinum) were received by 13.5% (35/260) and 19.8% 
(26/131) of patients in the olaparib and placebo arms, respectively. Crossover to olaparib was not permitted 
within study design. However, patients could have received a PARP inhibitor outside of the study through 
other clinical trials or commercially available products. Platinum followed by a PARP inhibitor (maintenance 
treatment) was classified as a PARP inhibitor regimen and not a platinum-based regimen.

Table 24: Subsequent anti-cancer therapies (FAS) 
Table 25: Subsequent PARP inhibitors by line of subsequent therapy (FAS) 
In SOLO1, only 10 patients had olaparib as part of their first subsequent treatment after receiving olaparib 
first line. Nine of the 10 patients received platinum-based chemotherapy followed by olaparib maintenance 
as their first subsequent treatment. All 10 patients had CR at study entry and their median time to 
progression on olaparib 1st line maintenance was 32 months, ranging from 23 to 41 months. At the time of 
DCO, only 3 patients had PFS2 event (progressed for a second time), whilst the remaining 7 patients were 
censored for PFS2, with the majority still receiving olaparib.

In those patients with objective response, median time from randomisation to onset of response and median 
duration of response were 10.8 months and 28.2 months, respectively for patients in the olaparib arm and 
5.4 months and 8.6 months, respectively for patients in the placebo arm.

Health-Related Quality of Life: FACT-O and TOI 
The TOI and FACT-O scores ranged between 0 to 100 and 0 to 152, respectively, with a higher score 
indicating a better HRQoL. Mean baseline TOI scores were 73.6 (SD 12.8) and 75 (SD 13.1) for the olaparib 
and placebo arms, respectively, and mean FACT-O scores were 113.5 (SD 18.3) and 115.8 (SD 18.6) for the 
olaparib and placebo arm, respectively. The compliance rates for the planned on-treatment visits by FACT-O 
were above 80% from the baseline to Week 97 (about 24 months) in both arms. 
Over the 24 months (main analysis), the average adjusted mean change from baseline was 0.3 (95%CI 
-0.72, 1.32) with olaparib (n=237) and 3.3 (95%CI 1.84, 4.76) with placebo (n=125). The estimated 
difference (-3.00; 95%CI -4.8, -1.2) between the arms in the mean change from baseline in TOI score over 
24 months was statistically significant. Over the first 12 months, the average adjusted mean change from

baseline was -0.69 (95%CI -1.67, 0.29) with olaparib (n=237) and 3.47 (95%CI 2.18, 4.83) with placebo 
(n=125), with an estimated difference of -4.17 (95%CI -5.8, -2.5) between the arms being statistically 
significant. The mean TOI score change from baseline was -2.86 and -1.16 at the early timepoints (5 weeks 
and 13 weeks, respectively) in the olaparib arm, while it was 2.15 and 2.91 at the same timepoints in the 
placebo arm, respectively. An AUC (area under the curve) analysis over all visits was also performed for TOI 
as sensitivity analysis and supported the main analysis.

Exploratory analysis in non-serous vs serous histology group 
For the serous histology, PFS events occurred in 40.4% (99/245) of patients in the olaparib arm compared 
with 40.0% (6/15) of patients with a non-serous histology in the olaparib arm. Only 1 patient in the placebo 
arm had non-serous histology and this patient did not have a PFS event at the time of the data cut-off. Thus, 
the PFS event rate for serous histology patients in the placebo arm is 96/130 [73.8%].  
In the FAS, PFS2 events occurred in 26.9% (66/245) of patients in the olaparib arm compared with 20% 
(3/15) of patients with a non-serous histology. In the placebo arm, the 1 patient with non-serous histology 
did not have a PFS2 event; the PFS2 event rate in serous patients in the placebo arm was 52/130 (40.0%).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The present application is to extend the indication of olaparib tablet formulation as monotherapy for the 
maintenance treatment of adult patients advanced BRCA-mutated high grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian 
tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response to first line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The application is based on the results of study SOLO1, a pivotal Phase III, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicentre study, investigating olaparib maintenance treatment in BRCAm patients 
with newly diagnosed high-grade advanced (FIGO III-IV) ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube 
cancer who were in complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to their first line platinum-based 
chemotherapy. 
The dose of olaparib in SOLO1 (300 mg bd tablets) was selected based on data from the Phase I study, 
D0810C00024  (Study  24)  in  an  advanced  gBRCA  mutated  ovarian  cancer  population  and  is  the  current 
recommended dose for the current indication. Study 24 was a formulation comparison study and the findings 
provided  information  on  the  efficacy,  pharmacokinetic  (PK)/pharmacodynamic,  safety  and  tolerability 
profiles of the olaparib tablet (see EPAR Lynparza).  
Subjects  were  randomised  2:1  to  receive  either  olaparib  (300  mg  bd,  tablet  formulation)  or  placebo 
stratified by response to fist line platinum chemotherapy (complete or partial). Cross-over was not allowed 
in this study. 
In SOLO1, patients could continue treatment for 2 years or until disease progression, or unacceptable 
toxicity. Patients with a complete response (no radiological evidence of disease) at 2 years were to stop 
treatment. Patients with evidence of disease at 2 years, who in the opinion of the treating physician can

derive further benefit from continuous treatment, could be treated beyond 2 years. The 2 year duration was 
determined based on the assumption that 8 month improvement in median PFS is clinically meaningful for 
the maintenance treatment for advanced ovarian cancer patients if median PFS of 13 months could reach to 
21 months after the olaparib administration. Considering that most olaparib-related adverse events 
(AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in the first 3 months of exposure, clustering late-onset AEs 
are not expected during the prolonged treatment duration (see discussion on clinical safety). To consider the 
potential risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/ acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) versus the clinical 
benefits in patients who receive the long term treatment, patients with a complete response (no radiological 
evidence of disease) at 2 years had to stop treatment.  
The trial was designed to recruit BRCAm patients i.e., germline BRCAm (gBRCAm) based on local and central 
testing or somatic BRCAm (sBRCAm) based on local testing. Prospective germline testing was performed 
using the Myriad Integrated BRACAnalysis test or the BGI gBRCA test. Patients with a local BRCA result were 
retested post-randomisation with the Myriad Integrated BRACAnalysis test or with the BRACAnalysis CDx 
test. No prospective testing of tumour samples was performed (see PD part). 
Patients must have had upfront or interval debulking surgery and be in clinical complete or partial response 
to first line platinum-based chemotherapy and no clinical evidence of disease progression. Regarding the 
platinum-based chemotherapy, the course must have consisted of a minimum of 6 treatment cycles and a 
maximum of 9; however if platinum-based therapy was discontinued early as a result of toxicities specifically 
related  to  the  platinum  regimen,  patients  must  have  received  a  minimum  of  4  cycles  of  the  platinum 
regimen.  
Four  cycles  of  chemotherapy  is  considered  as  under  treatment  and  could  have  confounded  the  results. 
However,  only  2  patients  had  4  cycles  of  prior  chemotherapy  and  3  patients  had  5  cycles  of  prior 
chemotherapy in SOLO1. All other patients had 6-9 cycles of chemotherapy prior to randomisation, with the 
majority having 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Therefore, it is considered that the impact on PFS calculated from 
time of randomization to progression or death is limited. 
Randomization was expected to be performed within 8 weeks after their last dose of chemotherapy (last 
dose was the day of the last infusion). 
Study patients must not have received bevacizumab during their first-line course of treatment, either in 
combination or as maintenance therapy following combination therapy. This is adequately reflected in the 
SmPC. 
At the time the study started, bevacizumab (Avastin) was approved in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel followed by bevacizumab maintenance in the first line maintenance ovarian cancer. According to 
NCCN  guidelines  (2019),  bevacizumab  may  be  continued,  regardless  of  BRCA  status,  as  a  single-agent 
maintenance therapy if used previously as part of a combination therapy, if partial or complete remission 
following:  primary  therapy  for  stage  II-IV  disease  or  recurrence  therapy  for  platinum-sensitive  disease 
[Evidence 3; moderately effective]. In addition, according to ESMO guidelines regardless of BRCA status 
(2013), bevacizumab is generally recommended [I, B] for patients with poor prognostic features such as 
stage IV or suboptimal debulking as defined in the ICON-7 trial. Bevacizumab should be given with paclitaxel 
or carboplatin with a treatment duration of one year. Bevacizumab is not universally used in this setting in 
EU and it could have been considered as a treatment option under discretion of investigator and according 
to  local  clinical  practice.  Treatment  with  bevacizumab  did  not  show  a  clear  benefit  for  BRCAm  patients 
according to the results from substudy GOG-218: 1) PFS in the subgroup of patients with HRR mutations 
(n=228): HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.26 for bevacizumab + carboplatin/paclitaxel vs carboplatin/paclitaxel, 
and PFS in the subgroup of patients with no HRR mutation (n=581): HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.85 (Norquist 
et al 2018), 2) results were not conclusive for OS. Therefore, the use of placebo as comparator is considered 
to  be  appropriate  in  order  to  determine  the  efficacy  of  olaparib  maintenance  monotherapy  in  advanced 
ovarian cancer patients who had responded following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.

To note, there is biological rationale for using PARPi in hypoxic conditions induced by VEGFi and this strategy 
is currently investigated in clinical trials, as PAOLA-01. 
PFS was the primary endpoint in SOLO1 supported by PFS2 and OS as key secondary endpoints. Additional 
secondary  endpoints  were  TDT,  TFST,  and  TSST.  Other  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  time  to 
earliest  progression  by  RECIST  1.1,  CA-125  or  death,  BoR  and  HRQoL  measured  by  TOI.  Primary  and 
secondary efficacy endpoints are in line with recommendations from EMA ‘Guideline on the evaluation of 
anticancer medicinal products in man’ (EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev 5.). Prolonged PFS is considered to be of 
benefit  to  the  patient.  If  PFS  is  the  selected  primary  endpoint,  OS  should  be  reported  as  a  secondary. 
Moreover, in the context of maintenance therapy, PFS2 should be determined to evaluate the impact on 
tumour’s drug resistance profile affected by therapy and the activity of next-line therapies.  
PFS assessment was initially by BICR. Per protocol amendment 3 issued on 19 February 2016, the 
assessment of PFS in the primary objective was changed to investigator assessment and PFS BICR 
assessment was retained as a sensitivity analysis. Others protocol amendments related to the assessment of 
efficacy during the course of the conduct of the study were about inclusion of an additional secondary 
objective of assessing efficacy by TFST, TSST and TDT (amendment 1) and update the HRQoL endpoint to 
change from baseline in TOI score of the FACT-O using MMRM analysis (amendment 2). Initially the 
objective of the HRQoL analysis was to compare the rate of deterioration in of HRQoL as assessed by TOI. 
Patient centric endpoints have been included and subsequently deleted from the SAP. Further, the initially 
planned time-to-worsening analyses of HRQoL and symptoms were deleted as not considered able to reflect 
the introduced continuous collection of QoL data beyond objective disease progression in view of the data 
demonstrated in study 19 where median time-to-worsening in TOI on both arms was shorter than median 
PFS. Changes have been done to allow continuous collection of PRO data beyond disease progression under 
protocol amendment 2 and this data is expected to be provided at the time of the updated PFS2 and OS 
analysis. 
All primary and secondary efficacy and HRQoL data were summarised and analysed using the FAS on an 
intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. A hierarchical testing strategy was employed to manage statistical tests for 
primary and key secondary endpoints of PFS2 and OS. In order to control the type I error at 2.5% (1-sided), 
a multiple testing procedure (MTP) was employed across primary (PFS) and key secondary endpoints (PFS2 
and OS). PFS2 was tested only after statistical significance was shown for PFS. OS was tested only after the 
null hypotheses were rejected for PFS and PFS2. 
The number of patients defined as having at least 1 important deviation in the study (defined as a deviation 
that could potentially have influenced the assessment of efficacy) was low (12.0%). A higher proportion 
(7.3%) of olaparib-treated patients had RECIST scans outside of a scheduled visit window on more than 2 
occasions compared with placebo-treated patients (1.5%). This is likely a reflection of the longer time to 
progression on the olaparib arm compared to placebo. The important deviations reported in SOLO1 were 
considered unlikely to have influenced the overall study conclusions, which are considered robust and 
representative of the overall study data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In  the  study  SOLO1,  a  total  of  391  out  of  1084  patients  enrolled  were  randomly  assigned  to  either  the 
olaparib  arm  (260  patients)  or  to  the  placebo  arm  (131).  All  except  one  placebo  patient  (130)  and  all 
olaparib patients (260) received study treatment. 
In addition to this global enrolment, a cohort of 64 patients was randomised in China. Five of these patients 
were included both in the global cohort and in the China cohort; the remaining 59 Chinese patients were 
randomised after the global recruitment was complete and closed and included only in China cohort. At the 
time of the DCO, a total of 14 patients (13 and 1 patients in the olaparib and placebo group, respectively) 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 55/109 
 
  
  
were  still  in  treatment  and  a  total  of  260  patients  (170  and  90  in  the  olaparib  and  placebo  group, 
respectively) remained in follow-up off treatment. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the olaparib and placebo 
arms. Median age was 53 years in both arms. Most patients were ECOG performance status 0 (78%). There 
were no patients with performance status 2 to 4 enrolled in the study (see SmPC section 5.1).  
Overall, ovarian cancer was the primary tumour in > 80% of the patients. Most patients were diagnosed as 
FIGO  stage  IIIC  (>65%).  According  to  Prat  2014,  most  serous  ovarian  cancer  are  stage  III;  the  vast 
majority (84%) of patients presenting with Stage IIIC disease. Furthermore, 12-21% of patients presented 
with Stage IV disease. The MAH has provided FIGO stages data from different clinical studies in the first-line 
maintenance  that  are  in  line  with  the  FIGO  stage  distribution  of  the  patients  in  SOLO1.  Overall,  the 
distribution of patients in the SOLO1 study across the different FIGO stages can be considered to be in line 
with historical data. 
The most common histological type was serous (> 90%), endometrioid histology was reported in 3.5% of 
the patients.  
Sixty-three percent (63%) of the patients had upfront debulking surgery and of these the majority (75%) 
had no macroscopic residual disease. Interval debulking surgery was performed in 35% of the patients and 
of these 82% had no macroscopic residual disease reported. Seven patients (1.8%), all stage IV, had no 
cytoreductive surgery. All patients had received first-line platinum-based therapy.  
There was no evidence of disease at study entry (CR), defined by the investigator as no radiological evidence 
of disease and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) within normal range, in 73% and 77% of patients in the olaparib 
and placebo arms, respectively. PR, defined as the presence of any measurable or non-measurable lesions 
at baseline or elevated CA-125, was reported in 27% and 23% of patients in the olaparib and placebo arms, 
respectively. 
Response to prior platinum chemotherapy was complete in 82% and partial in 18% of the patients. 
Results of the BRCA mutation status determined by local BRCA were highly concordant with Myriad germline 
testing results (only 3 patients with discordant results between local and Myriad confirmed subset). Two 
patients entered in the study with a local tBRCAm result that were later classified as gBRCAwt by Myriad 
testing. These 2 patients were confirmed by FMI as having sBRCA mutations. One patient entered the study 
with a local gBRCAm result and was later classified by Myriad as BRCA VUS. The gBRCAm prevalence in the 
prospectively  tested  SOLO1  patients  (27.3%)  was  greater  than  the  expected  prevalence  in  all  comer 
populations  in  first  line  (15.5%  to  19%)  as  investigators  were  asked  to  send  blood  samples  for  central 
Myriad gBRCA testing only after Cycle 3 of first-line chemotherapy, and only for patients who had evidence 
of an initial response based on CA-125 or CT scan; this was done in order to reduce the number of screen 
failures. As at the time of study initiation a central tumour diagnostic test suitable for registration was not 
available,  the  patients  recruited  onto  SOLO1  were  predominantly  gBRCAm.  The  prevalence  of  sBRCA 
mutations  in  ovarian  cancer  patients  at  diagnosis  or  following  partial  or  complete  response  to  first  line 
chemotherapy is between 6.4% and 8.4%. Therefore, of the 611 patients who were ineligible for SOLO1 as 
they were non-gBRCAm by central testing, between 39 and 51 patients could be expected to harbour an 
sBRCA mutation.  
The study met its primary objective demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in investigator 
assessed PFS for olaparib compared with placebo with a hazard ratio (HR) of  0.30 (95% CI 0.23, 0.41; 
p<0.0001; median not reached for olaparib vs 13.8 months for placebo). The investigator assessment of PFS 
was supported with a blinded independent central radiological (BICR) review of PFS (HR 0.28; 95% CI 0.20, 
0.39; p<0.0001; median not reached for olaparib and 14.1 months for placebo). However, beyond the data 
cut-off the scans have not been sent for BICR. At the time of the analysis, 51.5% olaparib treated patients 
remained  progression  free  compared  with  24.4%  placebo  treated  patients.  In  both  assessments 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 56/109 
 
  
  
Kaplan-Meier plots showed a more favourable effect for olaparib arm than for placebo arm with a separation 
of curves since the first three months.  
Similar PFS results were observed in both the China cohort and the global cohort in SOLO1. However, the 
China cohort was not powered for assessment of statistical significance due to the limited number of 
participants (64 patients). Nevertheless, a significant efficacy result was achieved (hazard ratio=0.46 95% 
CI 0.23 0.97 p=0.0320). 
The median PFS was planned to be 21 months on olaparib vs 13 months on placebo with an estimated HR 
about 0.62. The benefit of olaparib seems to have been underestimated in SOLO1 study. Estimation was 
made in relation to results from Study 19 and the target population in study 19 was heavily pre-treated 
patients in an advanced line setting whereas SOLO-1 targeted newly diagnosed patients.  
The  changes  in  the  primary  endpoint  from  BICR-based  to  INV-based  PFS  and  in  the  number  of  events 
needed for the primary analysis were justified by the initial underestimation of the median PFS in patients 
with gBRCAm and by discrepancy rates observed between INV confirmed progression and BICR results. No 
specific report for concordance analysis between investigator and BICR assessment of PFS in SOLO1 was 
provided, however the disagreement between investigator and BICR of declaring progression as per RECIST 
1.1 was acceptable (15%) and consistent with those in other previous studies.  There was no suggestion of 
bias in the investigator assessment favouring the olaparib arm.  
It was also noted that proportion of patients with residual disease in previously conducted studies should 
have been taken into account for assumptions of the primary analysis considering its prognostic value in the 
setting of upfront and interval debulking. The median PFS from diagnosis varies from 20 to 26 months in 
patients  with  BRCAm  newly  diagnosed  advanced  ovarian  cancer  according  to  epidemiology  data  and 
19.6-30.2 months in patients with BRCAm (without maintenance treatment) in the previous studies. Taking 
the different definitions of PFS into account, the median PFS of 13.8 months observed in the control arm in 
SOLO1  is  still  consistent  with  the  literature  taking  into  account  the  clinical  stage  of  the  participants  or 
residual disease after chemotherapy. 
Overall,  sensitivity  and  additional  analyses  of  PFS  (evaluation  time  bias,  attrition  bias,  using  the  eCRF 
stratification variable, assess possible informative censoring (using BICR), estimating HR using the stratified 
log  rank  test,  based  on  earliest  progression  of  investigator/BICR  assessment  of  progression)  were  all 
consistent  with  the  primary  analysis  showing  favourable  treatment  benefit  for  olaparib  in  maintenance 
therapy  for  the  study  population.  Some  differences  have  been  reported  in  stratification  variables  and 
discrepancies between the randomisation and investigator reported data in the eCRF are known to occur.  
Subgroup analysis of PFS across various particular subgroups did not reveal an obvious differential benefit 
across pre-defined subgroups compared with the overall population. The benefit of olaparib over placebo 
was maintained across all pre-defined subgroups, with different magnitude. 
The median PFS as the primary endpoint was not reached and will not be tested at a later time point to 
provide  a  precise  estimate  as  per  planned  statistical  analyses.  The  results  of  the  primary  analysis  and 
sensitivity analyses support that maintenance treatment during 2 years result in PFS benefit in the both 
subgroups of patients regardless of the primary disease status (clinical CR or clinical PR). 
In patients with evidence of disease (PR) at baseline, median PFS on olaparib was 30.9 months as compared 
with 8.4 months on placebo arm. The currently observed results in patients with residual disease at baseline 
(mainly  those  with  persisting  PR  or  stable  disease  after  2  years  of  treatment)  support  the  continuous 
olaparib maintenance treatment until disease progression as currently proposed. 
Overall, in regard to the duration of treatment, the SmPC reflects that patients can continue treatment until 
radiological disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or for to 2 years if there is no radiological evidence of 
disease after 2 years of treatment. Patients with evidence of disease at 2 years, who in the opinion of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 57/109 
 
  
  
treating physician can derive further benefit from continuous treatment, can be treated beyond 2 years in 
line with the protocol of the pivotal study (see SmPC section 4.2).  
At the time of analysis, a lower number of patients from olaparib arm had a second progression compared to 
placebo arm (26.5% vs 39.7%). The benefit on PFS was partly maintained at second progression with a HR 
of 0.50 (95% CI 0.35, 0.72, p<0.0001, median not reached for olaparib and 41.9 months for placebo).  
The provided analysis of PFS2 is far from mature and probably over-represents patients with a short-lasting 
response  with  poor  platinum  sensitivity.  The  MAH  should  provide  the  updated  and  final  PFS2  data  from 
SOLO1 study (see Annex II). PFS2 might also have been influenced by inclusion of cancer antigen 125 as a 
biomarker for disease progression according to the PFS2 definition in this trial.  
At the time of the analysis OS survival data were not yet sufficiently mature to allow comparison between 
two groups, with event rate of 21.2% and 20.6% in olaparib and placebo arms respectively. At 21.0% of 
maturity, the HR was not indicating a detriment in OS of olaparib arm compared to placebo, with a large CI 
(HR  0.95,  95%  CI  0.60,  1.53,  p=  0.8903,  median  was  not  reached  in  either  arms).  In  order  to  further 
investigate  the  efficacy  of  olaparib  in  the  claimed  indication,  the  final  OS  analysis  which  will  be  done  at 
approximately 60% maturity will be submitted by the MAH (see Annex II). Updated OS analyses are also 
expected to be submitted (see Annex II and RMP). 
Analysis  of  exploratory  efficacy  endpoints  showed  a  reduction  in  the  risk  of  discontinuation  of  study 
treatment  or  death  and  a  delay  of  time  until  the  first  subsequent  anti-cancer  therapy  and  the  second 
subsequent therapy or death in the olaparib group compared with the placebo group in overall population 
(FAS). TDT results showed a median difference of 10.8 months favouring olaparib vs placebo arm (median 
of  24.6  months  for  olaparib  vs  13.8  months  for  placebo,  HR  0.63,  95%  IC  0.51,  0.79,  p<0.0001).  A 
statistically significant delay in TFST was observed for olaparib arm compared with placebo in the overall 
population  (HR  0.30,  95%  IC  0.22,  0.40,  p<0.0001,  median  of  51.8  months  olaparib  vs  15.1  months 
placebo). At the time of the DCO, median TSST was not reached in the olaparib arm vs 40.7 months for the 
placebo arm. Results showed a delay in the time to a second therapy in the olaparib arm compared with the 
placebo  arm  (HR  0.45,  95%  IC  0.32,  0.63,  p<  0.0001).  Data  from  subsequent  therapies  showed  that 
patients are still capable to respond to the following treatments after the administration of maintenance 
treatment with olaparib.  
Thirty three patients (35.1%) of the 94 placebo-treated patients who had a subsequent therapy received a 
PARP inhibitor and only 10 patients of the 91 olaparib-treated patients (11.0%) who had a subsequent 
therapy received a PARP inhibitor. According to data provided from SOLO-1 study, results seemed to show 
a positive trend in delaying second progression (7/10 patients) in patients retreated with olaparib in 
maintenance following a platinum-based chemotherapy after first relapsed. However, data are too immature 
to conclude whether patients can benefit from PARP inhibitor re-challenge after previous exposure to 
olaparib. The SmPC reflects that there are no efficacy and safety data on maintenance retreatment with 
Lynparza following first or subsequent relapses in ovarian cancer patients or on retreatment of breast cancer 
patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).  
Number of events for ‘Time to earliest progression by RECIST 1.1, CA-125 or death endpoint’ at the time of 
the analysis was lower in olaparib arm compared to placebo arm (39.2% vs 74%, respectively). Hazard ratio 
results benefited better the study arm than the control arm (HR 0.30, 95% IC 0.23, 0.40; p<0.0001; median 
was not reached for olaparib vs 12 months for placebo arm). K-M plot showed a separation of the curves. A 
pronounced decrease during month 3 to month 18 is observed in placebo arm while olaparib arm remained 
slightly decreasing.  
Among the patient with evidence of disease at the time of randomization (target or non-target lesions at 
baseline), ORR of 42.6% was achieved in patients in the olaparib arm vs 23.1% in patients in the placebo

arm. In the olaparib arm (54 patients), 27.8% of the patients reached complete response, 14.8% reached 
partial response and 48.1% remained with stable disease as BoR. 
Patient-reported outcome (PRO) data were assessed by the change from baseline in the Trial Outcome Index 
(TOI) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Ovarian (FACT O) as a secondary endpoint. These 
analyses  are  considered  as  exploratory.  There  was  no  pre-specified  hypothesis  and  alpha  allocation. 
Significant  changes  in  the  types  of  analyses  have  been  introduced  during  the  study.  The  relatively  high 
scores at baseline likely reflect generally few cancer-related symptoms post-chemotherapy. The results at 
the  chosen  timepoints  do  not  appear  to  fully  capture  treatment-related  toxicities  and  the  decreased 
tolerability. The rationale has not been comprehensively provided for the appropriateness of the timing of 
data collection and numerous changes in the analysis methods, in light of the patient population, disease 
setting  and  treatment  regimen.  The  impact  of  missing  data  and  of  introduced  collection  of  data  beyond 
progression have not been discussed. Overall, limitations mentioned above precluded PRO inclusion in the 
SmPC.   
Regarding patients with sBRCAm, only 2 confirmed patients were included in the SOLO-1 trial. Available data 
is not sufficient to allow comparison of the efficacy profile of Lynparza within the two populations (gBRCAm 
and sBRCAm). However, an activity similar to that in patients with germline BRCA mutations is expected 
based  on  strong  biological  rationale.  In  addition,  available  clinical  data  indicating  efficacy  of  olaparib  in 
patients with somatic BRCA mutations in the maintenance treatment of ovarian cancer support extrapolation 
in this setting. Nevertheless, the MAH is recommended to collect efficacy and safety data in patients with 
sBRCA1/2 mutations in clinical trials and/or in real-life setting in patients treated with olaparib after the 
first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy.  
Patients with high grade endometrioid and other histology types were poorly/not represented in the patient 
population effectively enrolled in the SOLO1. Altogether there were 15 patients (5.8%) on the olaparib arm 
and 1 (0.8%) on the placebo arm with high grade endometrioid or other histology type. Exploratory analysis 
of the number of PFS events in the non-serous histology groups showed broadly similar results for olaparib 
treated patients, with the caveat of the small number of patients with non-serous histology. In addition, 
exploratory analysis of the number of PFS2 events in the non-serous histology groups also showed broadly 
similar results for olaparib treated patients. In view of consistent results in the SOLO-2 and SOLO-1 study for 
patients with high grade endometrioid cancer and the olaparib mechanism of action and biological rationale 
suggesting benefit in high grade tumours the indication is not restricted to “serous” histological type.  
Although most of women with HGSOC have a good response to standard platinum-containing chemotherapy 
treatment, about 20 to 30% of patients relapse within 6 months (platinum-resistant disease) (Testa et al, 
2018). About 15% of patients with gBRCA1/2 mutations are estimated to have platinum-free interval of less 
than 6 months after the first line chemotherapy (Chartron et al, 2019). The proportion of patients in olaparib 
arm (3.5%) and in placebo arm (8.4%) for which the effective progression date (by RECIST1.1, BICR) was 
reported to occur during first 6 months after the last dose of the platinum-based chemotherapy is considered 
informative and has been reflected in the SmPC. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The study SOLO-1 provided significant evidence of PFS benefit for Lynparza in monotherapy as maintenance 
after  a  first  line  of  platinum-based  chemotherapy  for  patients  with  high-grade  serous  epithelial  ovarian, 
fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers with BRCA mutations. Considering OS and PFS2 results were 
immature, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
PAES: In order to further investigate the efficacy of olaparib maintenance treatment in patients with 
advanced BRCA1/2-mutated high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who

MAH should submit the final analysis of OS and updated analyses of PFS2 from the phase 3, randomised, 
double-blind study SOLO1. Due date: 31 December 2023. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Across the entire clinical programme, as of 15 June 2018, approximately 9293 patients are estimated to 
have received treatment with olaparib. The focus of this analysis is the SOLO1 study (SOLO1) where olaparib 
300 mg (or placebo) bd was given as a maintenance monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed BRCA 
mutated advanced (FIGO Stage III-IV) ovarian cancer following platinum based chemotherapy. Supportive 
safety data, for olaparib 300 mg bd as a monotherapy, are provided by a pool of 1060 patients who were 
intended to receive this dose and received olaparib in the MAH-sponsored studies, as indicated in Table 37. 
Table 37: Number of patients in the 300 mg bd pool (as of DCO: 17 May 2018) 
Patient exposure 
Overall extent of exposure  
SOLO1 
At the Data Cut-Off (DCO) for the analysis of PFS, the majority of patients in the safety analysis set (SAS) 
had discontinued study treatment (247 [95.0%] of 260 olaparib-treated patients and 129 [99.2%] of 130 
placebo-treated patients). The most common reason for discontinuation in the olaparib arm was completion 
of  2  years  of  therapy  (123  [47.3%]  of  260  olaparib-treated  patients,  compared  with  35  [26.9%]  of 
placebo-treated patients who completed 2 years of therapy); the most common reason for discontinuation 
in the placebo arm was disease progression (78 [60.0%] of 130 patients). 
A higher proportion of patients in the olaparib arm had discontinued for an AE, compared with the placebo 
arm (30 [11.5%] of 260 patients vs 3 [2.3%] of 130 patients, respectively). However, a lower proportion of 
olaparib-treated  patients  discontinued  due  to  a  progression  event  (51  [19.6%]  of  260  patients  vs  78 
[60.0%] of 130 patients, respectively). 
Assessment report

Fifteen olaparib-treated patients (5.8%) had stable disease and remained on treatment as per protocol, 
compared with 2 (1.5%) placebo-treated patients. Eleven olaparib-treated patients (4.2%) and 1 (0.8%) 
placebo-treated patient had no evaluable disease or stable disease and continued on treatment in error.  
The majority of olaparib-treated patients received treatment for a period of ≥18 months (compared with the 
majority of patients receiving treatment for ≥12 months on the placebo arm). The number of patients still on 
treatment began to diverge between arms at approximately 6 months (in favour of olaparib). Duration of 
exposure to study treatment in SOLO1 is summarised in Table 39. 
Table 38: SOLO1: Overall extent of exposure (SAS) 
Table 39: SOLO1: Duration of olaparib/placebo exposure (SAS) 
Table 40 summarizes study treatment interruptions and dose reductions. Per protocol, dose reductions were 
only allowed for toxicity management and the maximum number of dose reductions was 2. The 8 patients (7 
olaparib-treated patients and 1 placebo-treated patient) who are shown in Table 40 as having more than 2 
reductions were patients who had a treatment interruption (eg, a missed dose) incorrectly reported as a 
dose reduction.

Olaparib 300 mg bd pool 
Long-term exposure to olaparib therapy was assessed in the 300 mg bd pool; 438 (41.3%) and 250 (23.6%) 
of all patients remained on treatment for ≥1 year and ≥2 years, respectively. The median total treatment 
duration in the 300 mg bd pool was 272 days (approximately 9 months). Compared with the olaparib arm of 
SOLO1,  treatment  duration  in  the  300  mg  bd  pool  was  generally  shorter  (probably  due  to  the  fact  that 
31.9% of patients in this pool were recruited to Phase I studies).

Adverse drug reactions  
Lynparza monotherapy has been associated with adverse reactions generally of mild or moderate severity 
(CTCAE grade 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation. The most frequently observed 
adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving Lynparza monotherapy (≥ 10%) were upper 
abdominal pain, cough, dyspneoa, anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.  
The Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions occurring in > 2% of patients were anaemia (16%), neutropenia (6%), 
fatigue/asthenia (6%), leukopenia (3%), thrombocytopenia (2%) and vomiting (2%). 
Adverse reactions that most commonly led to dose interruptions and/ or reductions were anaemia (13.9%), 
vomiting (7.1%), nausea (6.6%), fatigue/asthenia (6.1%) and neutropenia (5.8%). Adverse reactions that 
most commonly led to permanent discontinuation were anaemia (1.3%), nausea (0.8%) and 
thrombocytopenia (0.5%).

Dyspnoea 
Following the database lock for the primary analysis of the SOLO1 study, dyspnoea was identified as an ADR 
for olaparib. Table 51 shows that AEs of dyspnoea were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the 
olaparib arm than the placebo arm.

Table 51: SOLO1: Patients who had at least one AE of dyspnoea (grouped term analysis) 
reported in any category (SAS) 
A similar imbalance in rates of dyspnoea was seen in the SOLO2 study. In SOLO2, there were 23 (11.8%) 
patients in the olaparib arm with AEs of dyspnoea (single preferred term) compared with 1 (1.0%) patient 
in the placebo arm. 
Analysis  of  concurrent  event  data  suggested  that  dyspnoea  is  multifactorial.  At  a  population  level,  the 
imbalance was not driven by imbalances in the event rates of pneumonitis, upper respiratory tract infections 
or  nasopharyngitis.  The  proportion  of  the  patients  with  a  dyspnoea  AE  who  also  experienced  another 
relevant AE (with an incidence of >30%) is presented in Table 52.

AEs of dyspnoea were reported throughout the study period (median time to first onset was 5.72 months 
[range 0.2 to 23.0 months]). In the majority of patients (33/40; 82.5%), the events of dyspnoea resolved. 
Importantly, all of the 39 olaparib treated patients with AEs of dyspnoea in the SOLO1 study had AEs that 
were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity;  none  were  SAEs.  One  patient  had  a  dyspnoea  AE  leading  to  dose 
interruption and 1 AE led to permanent discontinuation; no dyspnoea AEs led to dose reduction. The patient 
with the dyspnoea event leading to permanent discontinuation  also reported AEs of upper respiratory tract 
infection and pyrexia leading to treatment discontinuation. This patient received treatment and recovered 
from the AE of dyspnoea but was subsequently diagnosed with AML. 
Gastrointestinal toxicities 
In first-line ovarian cancer maintenance treatment, patients experienced nausea events (77% on olaparib, 
38% on placebo), vomiting (40% on olaparib, 15% on placebo), diarrhoea (34% on olaparib, 25% on 
placebo) and dyspepsia (17% on olaparib, 12% on placebo). Nausea events led to discontinuation in 2.3% 
of olaparib-treated patients (CTCAE Grade 2) and 0.8% of placebo-treated patients (CTCAE Grade 1); 0.8% 
and 0.4% of olaparib-treated patients discontinued treatment due to low grade (CTCAE Grade 2) vomiting 
and dyspepsia, respectively. No olaparib or placebo-treated patients discontinued due to diarrhoea. No 
placebo-treated patients discontinued due to vomiting or dyspepsia. Nausea events led to dose interruption 
and dose reductions in 14% and 4%, respectively, of olaparib-treated patients. Vomiting events led to 
interruption in 10% of olaparib-treated patients; no olaparib-treated patients experienced a vomiting event 
leading to dose reduction. 
Anaemia 
Table 53 shows AEs of anaemia. AEs of anaemia were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the 
olaparib arm compared with the placebo arm. 
Table 53: SOLO1: Patients who had at least one AE of anaemia (grouped term) reported in any 
category (SAS) 
In clinical studies with the tablet formulation, the incidence of anaemia adverse reactions was 38.8% 
(CTCAE grade ≥3 17.4%) and the incidences of dose interruptions, reductions and discontinuations for 
anaemia were 15.7%, 10.8% and 1.9%, respectively; 20.9% of patients treated with olaparib needed one 
or more blood transfusions. An exposure response relationship between olaparib and decreases in 
haemoglobin has been demonstrated. In clinical studies with Lynparza the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥ 2 
shifts (decreases) from baseline in haemoglobin was 20%, absolute neutrophils 20%, platelets 5%, 
lymphocytes 30% and leucocytes 20% (all % approximate). 
No patients in SOLO1 had CTCAE Grade 4 haemoglobin values during the study; 19.5% of olaparib-treated 
patients had increases to CTCAE Grade 3 haemoglobin values (Table 30).

The majority (234 of 256 [91.4%] patients) of olaparib-treated patients in SOLO1 had a maximum CTCAE 
Grade ≤2 reported for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) values; 93.8% (121 of 129 patients) of patients in 
the placebo arm also had CTCAE Grade ≤2 ANC during the SOLO1 study.

Increase in creatinine 
AEs of increased creatinine were reported for a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm compared 
with the placebo arm, although overall numbers were low. These events were predominantly Grade 1 in 
severity and none led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
Table 57: SOLO1: Patients who had at least one AE of increased creatinine reported in any 
category (SAS) 
Two patients in the olaparib arm of the SOLO1 study had a 2 grade increase in laboratory values for 
creatinine during the study, compared with no patients in the placebo arm; no patients in either treatment 
arm had a ≥3 grade increase in laboratory values for creatinine.

In clinical studies with Lynparza (pool), the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥2 shifts (elevations) from baseline in 
blood creatinine was approximately 10%. 
Hypersensitivity, rash and dermatitis 
The analyses showed that the most commonly-reported AE associated with hypersensitivity was rash and 
that these types of events were reported for a similar percentage of patients in the olaparib arm compared 
with the placebo arm. Rash and other hypersensitivity events were predominantly Grade 1 or 2 in severity 
and none led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. There was no association between the reporting of 
AEs of rash and the length of time on olaparib treatment. AEs of rash in the olaparib-treated arm were 
reported throughout the study period, (median time to onset was 6.41 months [range 0.07 to 24.94 
months]); the majority (24 of 27 patients) of events of rash on olaparib treatment resolved (median time to 
resolution of first event of 1.05 months). A higher proportion of patients in the olaparib arm with AEs of rash 
(12 [44.4%] of 27 olaparib-treated patients) were treated for the AE, compared with the placebo arm (4 
[28.6%] of 14 placebo patients); 3 (60.0%) of 5 patients in the olaparib arm received treatment for an AE 
of hypersensitivity, and the single patient in the placebo-treated arm with the AE of hypersensitivity also 
received treatment. There were no events suggestive of a severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, angioedema 
or anaphylaxis) in either arm. There were no AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥3 and no SAEs within the SMQ narrow 
term search. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Table 59 shows AEs of thrombocytopenia (grouped term consisting of thrombocytopenia, platelet production 
decreased, platelet count decreased and plateletcrit decreased). AEs of thrombocytopenia were reported for 
a higher percentage of patients in the olaparib arm compared with the placebo arm. 
In the olaparib arm, 1 of the 2 patients with CTCAE Grade ≥3 AEs reported the event as an SAE (1 patient  
had a non serious CTCAE Grade 4 AE of platelet count decreased concurrently with an AE of anaemia which 
had a worst CTCAE grade of 3). There was 1 SAE of thrombocytopenia in the placebo arm and 2 patients with 
CTCAE Grade 4 AEs of platelet count decreased.

The majority of patients had a worst CTCAE Grade of ≤2 reported for platelet values throughout treatment. 
A low proportion of olaparib-treated patients (2 patients [0.8%]) had CTCAE Grade ≥3 reductions in platelet 
count during the study; 2 (1.5%) patients in the placebo arm had a CTCAE Grade ≥3 reduction in platelet 
count.

 Lymphopenia 
Table 61 shows AEs of lymphopenia (grouped term consisting of: B-lymphocyte count decreased, 
lymphocyte count decreased, lymphopenia and T-lymphocyte count decreased). These events were 
predominantly Grade 1 or 2 in severity and none led to permanent discontinuation of treatment. Events of 
lymphopenia were generally reported early in the treatment period (median time to first onset was 3.27 
months); the majority (13 of 16 patients) of events with olaparib resolved (median time to resolution of first 
event of 3.38 months.

Important potential risks 
Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia 
In  SOLO1,  in  the  post-follow-up  period  2  patients  had  AEs  of  AML  and  1  patient  had  an  AE  of 
myeloproliferative neoplasm; all of these AEs occurred in patients in the olaparib arm of SOLO1.

Table 63: Events of MDS/AML occurring in SOLO1 
Table 64 shows the AEs and incidence rates of MDS/AML in other pivotal studies, in the olaparib all doses 
monotherapy pool and across the entire olaparib clinical programme. 
Table 64: Summary of AEs of MDS/AML occurring across the olaparib programme 
Most of the 26 patients with events of MDS/AML in the olaparib monotherapy all doses pool were receiving 
treatment for ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer (n=24), with 2 other events occurring in patients 
with breast cancer. Twenty-two patients had a documented BRCA mutation, 2 patients were gBRCA wildtype 
and  in  2  patients,  the  BRCA  mutation  status  was  unknown.  In  20  of  the  26  cases  of  MDS/AML  in  the 
monotherapy pool a fatal outcome was reported, with MDS/AML noted as the primary or secondary cause of 
death. The duration of therapy with olaparib in patients who developed MDS/AML varied from <6 months to 
>2 years. The time to death after olaparib was discontinued ranged from 17 to 667 days (median 209 days). 
In  4  of  the  20  cases,  patients  died  due  to  other  causes  (progressive  disease [2  patients],  bone  marrow 
transplant complications [1 patient], and disseminated intravascular coagulation [1 patient]). In 5 cases,

MDS/AML was ongoing at the time of reporting and in 1 case of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, outcome 
was reported as recovered following allogeneic transplantation 320 days after diagnosis. 
In order to assess the potential contributions of the duration of exposure to olaparib and the number of prior 
lines of platinum-containing chemotherapy on the risk of MDS/AML, a further analysis of data from SOLO1 
and  SOLO2  was  conducted.  In  SOLO1,  patients  had  received  1  prior  line  of  platinum-containing 
chemotherapy, but the duration of exposure to olaparib and subsequent follow-up time was longer than in 
SOLO2. To take into account these differences, an exploratory analysis was conducted to directly compare 
the event rates of MDS/AML per patient-year of follow-up time in these studies (Table 65). 
Table 65: Event rates of MDS/AML in SOLO1 and SOLO2 
In this analysis, the event rate for MDS/AML in SOLO1 was lower than the event rate in both olaparib and 
placebo-treated patients in SOLO2, despite the longer duration of exposure to olaparib and longer follow-up 
time in SOLO1. As a significant number of patients in the placebo arms of both SOLO1 and SOLO2 received 
a PARP inhibitor (either olaparib or another PARP inhibitor, such as niraparib or rucaparib) as a subsequent 
therapy  after  discontinuing  study  treatment,  a  sensitivity  analysis  was  also  conducted.  Results  of  this 
analysis are presented in Table 66.

New primary malignancy  
In SOLO1, there were 5 (1.9%) patients in the Olaparib arm and 3 (2.3%) patients in the placebo arm with 
new primary malignancies. These AEs are discussed in more detail in Table 67.

Serious adverse events in SOLO1 
During SOLO1, a higher proportion of patients reported SAEs in the olaparib arm compared with the placebo 
arm. The majority of SAEs had resolved with either no action taken or following a temporary dose 
interruption or dose reduction, or were resolving. Eight patients (6 in the olaparib arm and 2 in the placebo 
arm) had SAEs that were ‘not recovered/not resolved’ at the DCO date for this analysis.

Comparative analysis of clinical laboratory evaluations 
The laboratory evaluations for SOLO1 and the 300 mg bd pool were comparable. Changes in haemoglobin; 
neutrophils;  lymphocytes,  platelets  and  MCV  were  the  only  significant  haematological  parameters  with 
clinically relevant changes; these parameters are recognised ADRs for olaparib. The only significant change 
in  clinical  chemistry  parameters  occurred  for  creatinine:  creatinine  increases  are  a  recognised  ADR  for 
olaparib. 
Assessment of the potential for drug-induced liver injury 
There were no confirmed or suspected Hy’s Law cases. One (0.4%) olaparib-treated patient in SOLO1 had 
concurrent  elevations  of  bilirubin  and  ALT;  this  patient  had  Gilbert’s  syndrome  at  study  entry,  which 
provides an explanation for her elevated liver enzymes. 
Laboratory abnormalities for ALT and AST (SOLO1) 
In SOLO1, there were no patients who had CTCAE Grade 4 laboratory values for ALT and AST; the proportion 
of patients with CTCAE Grade 3 elevations was low in both treatment arms: 
- There were 2 (0.8%) of 256 patients in the olaparib arm who had a laboratory value of AST elevation of 
CTCAE Grade 3 (worst grade), and 1 (0.4%) patient with CTCAE Grade 3 elevated ALT during treatment. No 
liver diagnostic investigations data were reported for these 2 patients. 
- There were 2 patients in the placebo arm who had CTCAE Grade 3 elevations of either ALT, AST or both 
during treatment or during follow-up. 
Concomitant elevations of ALT/AST and bilirubin (SOLO1) 
An  assessment  of  ALT,  AST  maximal  elevations  during  treatment  by  maximal  total  bilirubin  elevations 
showed  that  1  (0.4%)  patient  in  the  olaparib  arm  and  no  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  had  concurrent 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019

elevation of bilirubin and either ALT or AST.  One patient was reported to have Gilbert’s syndrome and had 
transient concurrent elevated ALT (CTCAE Grade 2)  and bilirubin (>2 x ULN) at Visit 13 (Day 227). The 
patient  had  bilirubin  values  above  normal  levels  (CTCAE  Grade  1  or  2)  pre-treatment  and  from  Visit  6 
onwards.  No  AEs  for  liver  abnormalities  were  reported  throughout  the  course  of  the  study.  The  patient 
remained on study treatment for 756 days. 
Laboratory abnormalities for ALT and AST (300 mg bd pool) 
In the 300 mg bd pool, 17 (1.6%) patients had an ALT increased laboratory value (worst grade) of CTCAE 
Grade 3 and 1 patient (0.1%) had an ALT increased laboratory value of CTCAE Grade 4; 25 (2.4%) patients 
had a CTCAE Grade 3 laboratory value of AST increased; no patients had an AST increased laboratory value 
of CTCAE Grade 4. The proportion of patients with these abnormal laboratory values in the 300 mg bd pool 
was higher than that in the olaparib arm of the SOLO1 study (0.4% and 0.8%, respectively). 
The proportion of olaparib-treated patients with CTCAE Grade 3 AEs in the SOLO1 study and in the 300 mg 
bd pool was low and similar to the proportion of patients with CTCAE Grade 3 abnormal laboratory values. 
Concomitant elevations of ALT/AST and bilirubin (300 mg bd pool) 
An assessment of combined elevations of ALT and bilirubin was conducted for all patients in the 300 mg bd 
pool. Of these 1060 patients, 16 patients reported elevations of both AST or ALT >3 × ULN and total bilirubin 
>2 × ULN, irrespective of ALP, at any point during their study treatment. 
Assessment of potential for renal impairment 
The median change in creatinine from baseline to Visit 3 for olaparib-treated patients was an increase of 8.8 
μmol/L compared with no change for placebo-treated patients. Median creatinine levels for olaparib-treated 
patients then remained consistent over time (maximum median change 15.0 μmol/L, median change at the 
majority  of  time  points  between  8.0  and  12.0  μmol/L)  with  levels  returning  to  baseline  at  the  30  day 
follow-up/post follow-up visits. 
Data from all patients in the 300 mg bd pool showed that a higher proportion of patients in the tablet pool 
had  CTCAE  grade  shifts  in  creatinine,  compared  with  SOLO1.  In  the  300  mg  bd  pool,  91.7%  of 
olaparib-treated patients had normal creatinine at baseline, 7.7% had CTCAE Grade 1 at baseline and 0.5% 
had CTCAE Grade 2 at baseline. A total of 810/1056 (76.7%) patients had a single change in CTCAE Grade 
(changes were normal to Grade 1 in 780 of the 810 patients) and 163/1054 (15.4%) had 2 CTCAE grade 
shifts (all were normal to Grade 2); 1 patient (0.1%) had a 3 grade shift in creatinine (from Grade 0 to Grade 
3). 
Safety in special populations 
The 300 mg bd pool has been used as the data source for this section rather than SOLO1. The pooled dataset 
includes patients with a range of solid tumours, including breast cancer.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AE leading to discontinuation 
In SOLO1, a higher proportion of patients had AEs that led to discontinuation of treatment (DAEs) in the 
olaparib  arm,  compared  with  the  placebo  arm  (Table  82).  Further  examination  of  data  for  the  6 
olaparib-treated patients in SOLO1 with DAEs for nausea showed that 5 of the 6 patients had onset of nausea 
≤7 days after first dose of olaparib.

The proportion of patients who had AEs leading to dose interruption was higher for SOLO1. 135 (51.9%) 
compared with the 300 mg bd pool 398 (37.5%); however, this is likely due  to the longer median total 
treatment  duration  in  SOLO1.  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  dose  modification  (anaemia,  vomiting, 
neutropenia, nausea and fatigue) were comparable with those observed in SOLO1.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This application is mainly supported by safety data from the phase III SOLO-1 Study where patients were 
dosed  olaparib  (or  placebo)  300  mg  bd  as  a  monotherapy.  Supportive  safety  data  from  a  pool  of  1060 
patients who were intended to receive olaparib 300 mg bd as a monotherapy in the MAH-sponsored studies 
(12 studies, including SOLO-1 results) were also provided. Overall, the The safety profile is based on pooled 
data  from  1,826  patients  with  solid  tumours  treated  with  Lynparza  monotherapy  in  clinical  trials  at  the 
recommended dose. 
In SOLO-1, 98.5% of the  patients from olaparib arm experienced any AE. The majority of AEs occurred 
within the first 3 months of treatment. The most common AEs (reported by > 30% patients) in the olaparib 
arm were nausea (77.3%), fatigue (40.8%), vomiting (40.0%), anaemia (38.1%) and diarrhoea (34.2%). 
These  results  were  numerically  similar  for  the  300  mg  bd  pool  population;  except  for  nausea  (64.3%), 
vomiting (35.9%) and diarrhoea (26.6%). 
For many of the most common events reported at a higher (≥10%) frequency on olaparib compared with 
placebo,  the  rate  remained  higher  for  olaparib-treated  patients  when  adjusted  for  exposure:  nausea; 
anemia; vomiting; fatigue; diarrhoea ; constipation; dysgeusia; upper abdominal pain; asthenia; decreased 
appetite; dyspepsia; dyspnoea; pyrexia and urinary tract infection.  Of these, dyspnoea has been identified 
as a new ADRs for olaparib by the MAH and reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Dyspnoea  was  experienced  by  15.4%  (40/260  patients)  of  the  olaparib-treated  patients  compared  to  a 
6.2% of patients in the placebo arm. In addition, the exposure-adjusted event rate was higher for olaparib 
compared to placebo (95.57 vs 41.63). The median time of onset for dyspnoea was 5.72 months (0.2-23.0 
months). Events were mostly mild or moderate in severity; none were SAEs. All the events were resolved. 
One event lead to dose interruption and other to permanent discontinuation. 
The  event  dyspnoea  seems  to  be  multifactorial.  Most  of  the  patients  that  experienced  dyspnoea, 
experienced as well another relevant AE; the most common ones were nausea (80.0%), fatigue (67.5%) or 
anemia (52.5%). However, anemia may have contributed to fatigue and dyspnea. 
Frequency of previously identified ADRs for olaparib, such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia 
and upper abdominal pain has been increased from common to very common. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has 
been amended accordingly. 
The percentage of patients experiencing any AEs of CTCAE grade 3 higher or any SAEs in SOLO1 were higher 
in the olaparib-treated patients compared to placebo ones (39.2% vs 18.5% and 20.8% vs 12.3%, 
respectively). The most common AEs of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher occurring in two or more patients in the 
olaparib arm were anaemia (21.4%), neutropenia (5%), diarrhoea (3.1%), neutrophil count decreased 
(2.7%) and leukopenia (1.5%). 
Proportions of patients with AE of CTCAE Grade 3 or higher were similar in SOLO-1 (39.2%) compared to the 
300  mg  bd  pool  (38.1%).  The  most  commonly  reported  event  of  CTCAE  Grade  ≥3  was  anaemia.  The 
proportion of patients with Grade ≥3 anaemia in SOLO-1 (21.2%) was consistent with results from the 300 
mg bd pool (17.1%).  
Discontinuations, dose reductions and interruptions due to AEs were more common in olaparib arm than in 
placebo arm in SOLO1. Results showed a percentage of olaparib discontinuations due to AEs in SOLO-1 of

11.5%; a higher proportion compared to 300 mg bd pool (7.1%). In SOLO-1, the most common DAE that 
occurred at ≥2% difference between any of the treatment group was anemia leading to 2.3% of the olaparib 
discontinuations. 
In  SOLO-1,  20.8%  (54/260  patients)  of  the  olaparib-treated  patients  experienced  any  SAE.  The  most 
common  reported  SAE  was  anaemia  (6.5%).  No  patients  in  SOLO1  had  CTCAE  Grade  4  decrease  of 
haemoglobin values during the study. Results were similar for 300mg bd pool.  
The incidence and severity of anaemia events following olaparib treatment in SOLO1 were consistent with 
the known safety profile of olaparib. Anaemia remained manageable by interrupting or reducing the olaparib 
dose or giving blood transfusions, when indicated and treatment discontinuation was rarely required (see 
SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
In clinical studies with olaparib, the incidence of CTCAE grade ≥2 shifts (decreases) from baseline in 
haemoglobin was 20%, absolute neutrophils 20%, platelets 5%, lymphocytes 30% and leucocytes 20% (all 
% approximate). 
Considering the difference in time exposure between the SOLO1 safety set and the olaparib monotherapy 
300mg bd safety set, data adjusted by patient years’ exposure were provided for common AEs, grade ≥ 3 
AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation (data not shown). The adverse event rates (per 1000 patient 
year) was slightly higher for the pooled olaparib 300mg (average: 1.14 times), which was consistent with 
the first line use of olaparib in the SOLO1 trial.  The consistency between the two sets was generally 
observed, with ‘athralgia’ events rate being slightly increased among the SOLO1 patients (1.24 times) and 
‘decreased appetite’ being almost twice less (0.52 times).  CTCAE grade ≥ 3 AE diarrhoea was more present 
(1.4 times more AEs per 1000 patients years ) during the SOLO1 trial than among patients of the pool while 
fatigue was twice (2.2 times) more present among the patients of the pool.  Overall, these data were 
consistent with the incidences already provided.  
Regarding serious AEs, there was overall a slightly lower presence of time adjusted AEs observed during trial 
SOLO1. The individual numbers are small and do not allow to draw conclusions on individual AEs.  
In  SOLO1,  in  the  post-follow-up  period,  2  patients  had  AEs  of  AML  and  1  patient  had  an  AE  of 
myeloproliferative neoplasm; the outcome was fatal for the cases with AML and in the myeloproliferative 
neoplasm case, the patient died due to a septic shock after a stem cell transplantation. 
The incidence rate of MDS/AML is 0.6% (55/9293 patients) in the entire olaparib clinical programme and 
1.2% (26/2258 patients) for the pool of all doses of olaparib in monotherapy. The majority of the cases 
reported a fatal outcome, with MDS/AML noted as the primary or secondary cause of death. The duration of 
therapy with olaparib in patients who developed MDS/AML varied from <6 months to >2 years. The time to 
death after olaparib was discontinued ranged from 17 to 667 days (median 209 days). 
In order to assess the potential contributions of the duration of exposure to olaparib and the number of prior 
lines of platinum-containing chemotherapy on the risk of MDS/AML, a further analysis of data from SOLO1 
and SOLO2 was conducted. Data showed that the event rate for MDS/AML in SOLO1 (one platinum-based 
regimen)  was  lower  than  the  event  rate  in  both  olaparib  and  placebo-treated  patients  in  SOLO2  (two 
Platinum-based regimen): 1) event rate in SOLO1 was higher in the olaparib arm compared to placebo arms 
(3.4 vs 0); 2) in SOLO2 a higher event rate was observed in placebo arm compared to olaparib arm (16.2 vs 
10.5). Duration of exposure and follow-up time was longer in SOLO1. 
A second sensitivity study was conducted to SOLO1 and SOLO2 regarding the influence of the exposure to 
PARP inhibitors, even as a subsequent therapy. Results showed that the event rate of MDS/AML events was 
higher  in  SOLO2  population  than  in  SOLO1,  even  if  the  patients  had  never  been  treated  with  any 
PARP-inhibitor.  The event rate difference were of 15.7 points higher in the never PARP inhibitor treated

population in SOLO1 study (19.1) and 8.8 points higher in the ever PARP inhibitor treated population in 
SOLO2 study (12.2) compared to ever PARP inhibitor treated population in SOLO1 (3.4). 
Therefore,  results  suggested  that  that the  risk  of  MDS/AML  is  closely  related to  duration  of  exposure to 
platinum-containing chemotherapy, rather than the duration of exposure to olaparib. Nevertheless, a causal 
relationship between olaparib treatment and the incidence of MDS/AML cannot be dismissed. MDS/AML will 
be closely monitored as reflected in the RMP. 
In SOLO1, there were 5 (1.9% incidence) patients in the Olaparib arm and 3 (2.3% incidence) patients in the 
placebo arm with  new primary malignancies.  Comparison of AEs of  new primary malignancies in SOLO1 
against other studies in the clinical programme suggested that when larger populations of olaparib-treated 
patients  are  considered  the  incidence  decrease.  The  incidence  for  the  pooled  data  of  the  entire  clinical 
programme in the olaparib-treated population is 0.7% (29 events out of 9293 olaparib-treated patients). 
As the risk of AML/MDS and NPM might be higher in patients with germline BRCAm (in whom also the blood 
cells  carry  the  mutation  and  will  thus  be  affected  by  the  PARP  inhibition),  incidence  data  specifically  in 
patients with gBRCA1 and gBRCA2 from clinical trials and post-marketing experience (up to June 2018) were 
provided. Furthermore, in order to understand the background incidence of MDS/AML due to chemotherapy 
in  gBRCA  mutated  patients  (who  might  potentially  be  more  susceptible),  available  data  from  historical 
populations who received platinum but not PARPi were provided (data not shown). 
The  analysis  of  the  pooled  data  from  the  clinical  trials  did  not  allow  concluding  on  differences  of  either 
MDS/AML or NPM among the gBRACm patients treated with olaparib as relative to those treated with the 
comparator. This concerned both the monotherapy studies (overall 1400 olaparib patients and 402 controls 
patients) and the combination studies (67 patients treated with olaparib and 14 controls).  
Currently  MDS/AML  cases  have  been  reported  in  1.4%  of  gBRAC1m  patients  and  1.6%  of  BRCA2  
(gBRAC2m)  treated  with  olaparib.  Post  marketing  records  document  MDS/AML  in  5  BRCA1m  and  11 
BRCA2m  patients  for  an  overall  number  of  61  MDS/AML  cases.  NPMs  showed  similar  figures  among  the 
monotherapy olaparib treated patients (1.3% for gBRCA1m and 1.6% for gBRCA2m patients) but had a 
lower overall incidence in the post marketing data (8 cases compared to 61 for MDS/AML). It is not clear 
whether the lower number of NPMs cases was related to lower risk of other types of malignancies compared 
to MDS/AML or to differences in data collection and potentially under-reporting for NPMs. 
The annual report on AML/MDS (data cut-off Dec 2018) was provided within this procedure (data not shown) 
and will be further discussed in the PSUR procedure. Section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated to include 
the  incidence  of  MDS/AML  cases  specifically  among  gBRCA1m  and  gBRCA2m  patients  (1.7%  and  1.4%, 
respectively). 
MDS/AML  and  new  primary  malignancies  are  classified  in  the  RMP  as  important  potential  risks  and  will 
continue to be monitored closely. Long-term safety data will also continue to be collected (see RMP). 
Five events of pneumonitis were reported (1.9% incidence) in SOLO-1. The incidence for the pooled data of 
olaparib  in  monotherapy  combined  therapeutic  dose  (N=1826  olaparib-treated  patients)  is  0.7%.  These 
events were mild or moderate, non-serious and resolved without treatment discontinuation; none of them 
had a fatal outcome. 
The reports of pneumonitis from post-marketing surveillance were consistent with the characterisation of 
the events reported from monotherapy clinical studies. A causal relationship between olaparib treatment 
and the development of pneumonitis has not been established. 
Pneumonitis is classified in the RMP as important potential risks and will continue to be monitored closely. 
From a mechanistic point of view, patients without germline BRCAm (gBRCAwt) might have a better safety 
profile than patients with gBCRAm since the drug will act mainly on the tumour cells rather than on all cells

of the body. A comparison of the safety data for patients confirmed as being gBRCAwt vs gBRCAm, while 
taking into account other possible baseline differences was provided (data not shown). Data in only 67 
patients gBRCAwt were presented (vs 1419 for gBRCAm). The relatively low number of gBRCAwt patients 
might be explained by inclusion criteria in clinical trials mostly performed in gBRCAm patients. Overall there 
was no clear difference but the low numbers of events by the ‘preferred term level’ made it difficult to draw 
meaningful conclusions.  
With regards to special population, the proportion of AEs and SAEs was similar among the difference age 
population.  Proportion of SAEs were slightly increasing from younger to older groups; 7.3% for age ≤  65 
years group, 9.9% for age from 65 to 74 years group and 14.7% for  age from 75 to 84 years group. No 
patients above or same to 85 years old were included in the study. 
In the SOLO1 trial 92.1% of the non-Whites were from Asian origin: 50.4% from China, 22.7% from Japan 
15.8% from Korea and the remaining patients from 8 other countries. Although differences in incidences are 
observed, there were no consequences for dose adjustments as the proportions of patients requiring dose 
reductions, treatment interruptions and dose discontinuations were similar for White and non-White 
patients. Although some AEs occurred at rather similar frequencies among Non-White and White patients, 
other including WBC count decreased, Neutrophil count decreased, Platelet count decreased, Malaise and 
Asthenia have differences of incidences between the two sub populations of patients. An overview of the 
literature on other PARPi did not brought evidence that races led to different PK or AEs profiles but in two 
publications on veliparib Western patients were found more subject to nausea and vomiting.  Pop PKs 
reached similar conclusion.  
Olaparib is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment; however, no olaparib dose 
adjustment  is  considered  warranted  for  patients  with  mild  or  moderate  hepatic  impairment  (See  SmPC 
section 4.2). 
Olaparib  is  not  recommended  for  use  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment;  the  dosage  should  be 
reduced to 200 mg bd in patients with moderate renal impairment, however, no olaparib dose adjustment is 
considered warranted for patients with mild renal impairment. (See SmPC section 4.2) 
No change to the current recommendations for patients with renal and hepatic impairment is needed based 
on the data provided in this application. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The results of study SOLO-1 did not show significant differences in safety when compared to pooled safety 
data from other studies. Overall, the safety profile of olaparib tablet formulation is considered manageable 
for the intended population taking into account current pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimisation 
measures in place for the  product. However the safety data available are considered limited in terms of 
number  of  patients  and  long-term  follow-up  and  therefore  do  not  allow  to  comprehensively  determine 
long-term toxicities. Long-term exposure to/potential toxicity to olaparib is already included in the list of 
safety concerns in the risk management plan, under missing information. 
More  data  are  also  needed  to  assess  the  causal  relationship  between  the  exposure  to  olaparib  and  the 
development  of  events  that  constitute  important  potential  risks.  Routine  pharmacovigilance  activities 
including follow-up targeted safety questionnaires are in place to enable more complete data collection and 
assessment (see RMP). No additional pharmacovigilance activities were considered needed as a result of the 
present procedure.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 the SmPC of the tablet 
formulation have been updated. Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC of the capsule formulation have 
also been modified to reflect information that is also relevant to the capsule formulation. The Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: The wording of the 
package leaflet is similar to that already tested previously during the MA applications. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lynparza (olaparib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  applied  indication  is  for  the  maintenance  treatment  of  newly  diagnosed  advanced  BRCA-mutated 
high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete 
response or partial response) to first line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 101/109 
 
  
  
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current standard of care for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, including those patients with 
BRCAm high-grade ovarian cancer, consists of radical debulking surgery followed by post-operative 
platinum-based first line chemotherapy (NCCN Ovarian 2019). For patients for whom upfront surgery is 
unlikely to achieve a complete resection, treatment consists of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by 
interval debulking surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy (NCCN Ovarian 2019).  
First line chemotherapy is generally given for a maximum of 6 cycles. It cannot be continued until 
progression as it is associated with cumulative neurological, renal, and haematological toxicities. Moreover, 
clinical outcomes do not improve if chemotherapy is extended beyond 6 cycles (Ledermann et al 2013). 
Since chemotherapy is not a viable treatment option in the maintenance setting, there is a need for a 
well-tolerated maintenance treatment option in the first line setting. The vascular endothelial growth factor 
inhibitor bevacizumab (Avastin) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by bevacizumab 
maintenance is the only treatment approved in the first line maintenance ovarian cancer setting.  
There are currently no first line maintenance treatments approved specifically for BRCAm patients with 
advanced ovarian cancer and these patients receive the same treatment options as all other ovarian cancer 
patients.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on results from the pivotal Phase III, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind 
multicentre study (SOLO1) in which newly diagnosed, advanced (FIGO stage III-IV) BRCA-mutated high 
grade serous or high grade endometrioid ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer and/or fallopian tube 
cancer who are in CR or PR following completion to first line platinum-based chemotherapy, were 
randomised 2:1 to receive either olaparib (300 mg bd, tablet formulation) or Placebo.  
The primary endpoint was PFS defined as time from randomisation to progression determined by 
investigator assessment using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, or 
death. BIRC assessment was presented as sensitivity analysis. Secondary endpoints included OS, PFS2, 
TFST, TSST, and TDT. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At the time of the DCO of 17 May 2018, 102 (39.2%) olaparib-treated patients and 96 (73.3%) had a PFS 
event;  HR  was  equal  to  0.30  (95%  CI  0.23,  0.41;  p<0.0001)  indicating  a  70%  reduction  in  the  risk  of 
disease progression or death for olaparib-treated patients compared to placebo-treated ones. The median 
PFS from randomization was not reached for olaparib arm and was 13.8 months for placebo.  
Sensitivity and additional analyses of PFS (evaluation time bias, attrition bias, using the eCRF stratification 
variable, assess possible informative censoring (using BICR), estimating HR using the stratified log rank 
test, based on earliest progression of investigator/BICR assessment of progression) were all consistent with 
the primary analysis showing favourable treatment benefit for olaparib in maintenance therapy for the study 
population. 
Secondary endpoints were also supportive. PFS2 data, with 26.5% and 39.7% of events in olaparib and 
placebo arms, showed an initial trend towards greater reduction of risk of disease progression with next line 
therapy or death for patients initially allocated to olaparib arm compared to placebo (HR of 0.50 (95% CI 
0.35-0.72; p=0.0002; median not reached for olaparib vs. 41.9 months for placebo). 
 At the time of the analysis OS survival data were not yet sufficiently mature to allow comparison between 
two groups, with event rate of 21.2% and 20.6% in olaparib and placebo arms respectively. At 21.0% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 102/109 
 
  
  
maturity, the HR was not indicating a detriment in OS of olaparib arm compared to placebo, with a large CI 
(HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.60, 1.53, p= 0.8903, median was not reached in either arms). 
A statistically significant delay in TFST was observed for olaparib arm compared with placebo in the overall 
population  (HR  0.30,  95%  IC  0.22,  0.40,  p<0.0001,  median  of  51.8  months  olaparib  vs  15.1  months 
placebo).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The OS survival data were not yet sufficiently mature to allow comparison between two groups. An updated 
OS analysis and the final OS analysis which will be done at approximately 60% maturity will be submitted by 
the MAH (see Annex II).  
The provided analysis of PFS2 is far from mature and probably over-represents patients with a short-lasting 
response with poor platinum sensitivity. Updated and final PFS2 data from SOLO1 study will be provided (see 
Annex II). 
Available  data  in  patients  with  somatic  BRCA  mutations  are  considered  limited.  Uncertainty  remains  in 
regard to the magnitude of benefit in patients with somatic BRCA mutations, especially in this earlier setting 
in  which  patients  are  not  pre-selected  by  platinum  sensitivity.  However,  there  is  a  biological  rationale 
suggesting similar activity in patients with somatic BRCA mutations as in patients with germline origin of 
BRCA  mutations  in  their  tumours.  The  MAH  is  recommended  to  collect  further  data  in  these  patients, 
including in first-line setting.As bevacizumab treated-patients were excluded from the study, no data was 
obtained in this population. This is adequately addressed in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Lynparza monotherapy has been associated with adverse reactions generally of mild or moderate severity 
(CTCAE grade 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation. The most frequently observed 
adverse reactions across clinical trials in patients receiving Lynparza monotherapy (≥10%) were nausea, 
vomiting,  diarrhoea,  dyspepsia,  fatigue,  headache,  dysgeusia,  decreased  appetite,  dizziness,  upper 
abdominal pain, cough, dyspnoea, anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. 
Dyspnoea experienced by 15.4% (40/260 patients) of the olaparib-treated patients has been identified as a 
new ADR for olaparib. The median time of onset for dyspnoea was 5.72 months (0.2-23.0 months).  
Frequency of previously identified ADRs for olaparib, such as, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia 
and upper abdominal pain has been increased from common to very common (see SmPC section 4.8). 
Important potential safety concerns include the risk of MDS/AML, new primary malignancies, pneumonitis, 
overdosing or underdosing due to medication errors associated with dual availability of capsules and tablets, 
effects on embryofoetal survival and abnormal development.  
Overall, olaparib has been associated with adverse drug reactions generally of mild or moderate severity 
(CTCAE 1 or 2) and generally not requiring treatment discontinuation.  
Overall, the safety profile of olaparib is well characterised. The most common (≥20% of patients) AEs in the 
olaparib  arm  were  nausea  (77.3%),  fatigue  (40.8%),  vomiting  (40%),  anaemia  (38.1%),  diarrhoea 
(34.2%), constipation (27.7%), dysgeusia (26.2%), arthralgia (25.4%), abdominal pain (24.6%), asthenia 
(24.2%) and headache (22.7%). The AEs that led to discontinuations in more than 2 patients of the olaparib 
arm are anaemia (2.3%), nausea (2.3%), fatigue (1.5%), vomiting (0.8%), asthenia (0.8%) and malaise 
(0.8%). Otherwise these AEs were mostly mild or moderate in severity.  
Grade ≥3 AEs were reported in a higher proportion of patients in the olaparib arm than in the placebo arm 
(102 [39.2%] patients and 24 [18.5%], respectively).  The most common AEs of CTCAE Grade ≥3 (reported 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 103/109 
 
  
  
in ≥3% of patients in either the olaparib arm and/or the placebo arm) were anaemia (grouped term: 21.5% 
of olaparib-treated patients vs 1.5% patients in the  placebo arm), neutropenia (grouped term: 8.5% vs 
4.6%, respectively) and diarrhoea (3.1% vs 0%). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in a higher proportion of the olaparib treated patients (20.8%, 
n=54) than in patients in the placebo arm (12.3%, n=16).  The most common SAE in the olaparib arm was 
anaemia (17 [6.5%] olaparib treated patients vs 0% placebo arm) and urinary tract infection (3 [1.2%] vs 
0).  The other SAEs for olaparib occurred in <3 patients each.   
The  median  total  duration  of  exposure  to olaparib was  approximately  two  times  longer than  duration  of 
exposure to placebo (106.9 weeks [24.6 months, reflective of the 2 year treatment cap], versus 60.3 weeks 
[13.9 months, reflective of the time to disease progression in the placebo arm], respectively).   
Dose  modifications  (interruptions  or  reduction)  were  reported  in  65.8%  patients  on  olaparib  and  32.3% 
placebo patients; the majority of these were short-term interruptions in treatment. Eleven percent of the 
olaparib patients had AEs that led to discontinuation. 
The safety of olaparib in this study was in line with the known safety profile of olaparib. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data available are considered limited in terms of number of patients and long-term follow-up and 
therefore do not allow to comprehensively determine long-term toxicities. Long-term exposure to/potential 
toxicity  to  olaparib  is  included  in  the  list  of  safety  concerns  under  missing  information  in  the  risk 
management plan. 
The  most  important  uncertainties  about  unfavourable  effects  are  related  to  the  risk  of  AML/MDS,  new 
primary malignancies and pneumonitis. The causality of olaparib in occurrence of rare cases of MDS/AML 
could not be firmly established in the context of previous courses of chemotherapy. MDS/AML will be closely 
monitored as reflected in the RMP. Causal relationship between the exposure to olaparib and the occurrence 
of  pneumonitis  events  could  not  be  established.  The  SmPC  has  been  modified  to  reflect  updated  safety 
information in this regard.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Lynparza  was  shown  to  delay  disease  progression  in  patients  who  are  in  response  to  platinum-based 
chemotherapy in a first line setting based on PFS results from a randomised study in patients BRCA mutated. 
The use of PFS as primary endpoint is supported by sensitivity analyses and secondary endpoints.  
Although  the  OS  data  from  the  SOLO1  study  are  still  immature  (21.0%  of  maturity),  the  HR  was  not 
indicating a detriment in OS of olaparib arm compared to placebo. The magnitude of PFS benefit does not 
appear  to  translate  into  OS  benefit  at  this  timepoint.  The  final  OS  analysis  which  will  be  done  at 
approximately 60% maturity will be submitted by the MAH (see Annex II and RMP). 
PFS2  results,  even  immature,  are  showing  a  positive  trend.  Overall,  from  an  efficacy  point  of  view, 
maintenance  treatment  represents  a  valuable  option  to  delay  progression  and  next  line  of 
platinum-containing chemotherapy, even though more mature data are needed.  
The updated OS analysis and final OS analysis will be provided (see Annex II) along with updated PFS2 data. 
Fatigue, nausea and vomiting of any grade are common with olaparib and might significantly affect QoL. 
Haematological  AEs  may  prompt  dose  reductions  and  transfusions  if  not  adequately  managed.  Olaparib 
monotherapy is associated with an acceptable tolerability and relatively few toxicities that do not appear to 
affect the measured patient reported outcomes. 
Overall,  olaparib  was  well  tolerated  with  a  manageable  safety  profile  which  is  sufficiently  characterised, 
although  data  for  long-term  safety  remain  limited.  While  ADRs  of  hematologic  and  lymphatic  system 
occurred at a high frequency, they are generally of low grade and easily manageable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy results showed a delay in PFS, which is supported by second endpoints results. This delay is partially 
maintained until the second progression. In addition patients with evidence of disease seem to respond to 
the treatment and to maintain the response for a long period. 
Safety  results  of  SOLO1  appear  in  line  with  the  safety  profile  of  olaparib  from  other  studies  and 
post-marketing information. Measures to minimize the risk are well addressed in the RMP submitted by the 
MAH. 
Overall, the benefit risk balance of Lynparza in the maintenance treatment of patients with newly diagnosed 
advanced BRCA-mutated high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are 
in response following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy is positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lynparza in the maintenance treatment of patients with newly diagnosed advanced 
BRCA-mutated high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in 
response following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy is positive. 
Considering OS and PFS2 results were immature, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to 
address issues related to efficacy: 
PAES: In order to further investigate the efficacy of olaparib maintenance treatment in patients with 
advanced BRCA1/2-mutated high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who

are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first line platinum-based chemotherapy, the 
MAH should submit the updated and final analysis of PFS2 and OS from the phase 3, randomised, 
double-blind study SOLO1. Due date: 31 December 2023. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to include the use of Lynparza (tablet formulation) as monotherapy for the 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) BRCA1/2-mutated 
(germline and/or somatic) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are 
in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. As a 
consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 the SmPC of the tablet formulation 
have been updated. Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC of the capsule formulation have also been 
modified to reflect information that is also relevant to the capsule formulation. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. The RMP version 17.4 has been updated accordingly. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following new condition: 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures  
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
PAES: In order to further investigate the efficacy of olaparib maintenance treatment in

Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Lynparza  is not similar to Yondelis and Zejula within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/330530/2019 
Page 107/109 
 
  
  
 
 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers by consensus that the new therapeutic 
indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of indication to include the use of Lynparza (tablet formulation) as monotherapy for the 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO stages III and IV) BRCA1/2-mutated 
(germline and/or somatic) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are 
in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. As a 
consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 the SmPC of the tablet formulation 
have been updated. Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC of the capsule formulation have also been 
modified to reflect information that is also relevant to the capsule formulation. The Package Leaflet has been 
updated accordingly. The RMP version 17.4 has also been accepted.

Reminders to the MAH 
1. 
In accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the Agency makes available a 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) on the medicinal product assessed by the Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use. The EPAR is first published after the granting of the initial marketing 
authorisation (MA) and is continuously updated during the lifecycle of the medicinal product. In 
particular, following a major change to the MA, the Agency further publishes the assessment report of 
the CHMP and the reasons for its opinion in favour of granting the change to the authorisation, after 
deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. 
Should you consider that the CHMP assessment report contains commercially confidential information, 
please provide the EMA Procedure Assistant your proposal for deletion of commercially 
confidential information (CCI) in “track changes” and with detailed justification by 10 May 2019. 
The principles to be applied for the deletion of CCI are published on the EMA website at 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/principles-be-applied-deleti
on-commercially-confidential-information-disclosure-emea-documents_en.pdf. 
2. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
3. 
If the approved RMP is using Rev. 2 of the ‘Guidance on the format of the RMP in the EU’ and the RMP 
‘Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan’ has been updated in the procedure, the MAH is 
reminded to provide to the EMA Procedure Assistant by Eudralink a PDF version of the ‘Part VI: 
Summary of the risk management plan’ as a standalone document, within 14 calendar days of the 
receipt of the CHMP Opinion. The PDF should contain only text and tables and be free of metadata, 
headers and footers. 
4. 
The MAH is reminded to submit an eCTD closing sequence with the final documents provided by 
Eudralink during the procedure (including final PI translations, if applicable) within 15 days after the 
Commission Decision, or prior to the next regulatory activity, whichever is first. For additional guidance 
see chapter 4.1 of the Harmonised Technical Guidance for eCTD Submissions in the EU.

2.4.  Clinical study 
IgPro10_5001, Application of Privigen: An observational, non-
interventional study 
Description 
The non-interventional observational study (NIS) with Privigen focusing on application of the IVIG in 
adult and paediatric patients started in September 2008 (launch of Privigen, FPFV) and ended in 
September 2021 (LPLV). 
Study IgPro10_5001 was a Phase 4 multicenter, observational, non-interventional post-marketing 
surveillance study in adult and paediatric patients treated with Privigen performed in Germany; it was 
designed to evaluate effectiveness and tolerability of Privigen in patients with primary or secondary 
immunodeficiency as well as different autoimmune diseases in clinical practice. 
The submitted study report summarises the data collected in 13 paediatric patients aged < 18 years. 
Methods 
Study participants 
The intended number of patients was 5,000. These patients should be enrolled by approximately 200 
centers. A patient could be included in the post-marketing surveillance study if the physician had 
selected Privigen as the intravenous immunoglobulin to be administered. Treatment decision was 
independent of participation in this observational study. The treatment should be handled according to 
the SmPC. Exclusion criteria were not defined.  
Treatments 
Administration of Privigen (IgPro10) should be handled according to the SmPC. Treatment decision was 
independent of participation in this observational study.  
Objective(s) 
The objective of this non-interventional study conducted in Germany was the evaluation of the 
effectiveness and tolerability of Privigen in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency 
as well as different autoimmune diseases of all ages in clinical practice. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
• Occurrence of infections in patients with immunodeficiency (including kind of infection, severity, 
duration and treatment) 
• Occurrence of bleeding events in patients with ITP (including severity) 
• Effectiveness and tolerability of Privigen as assessed by the treating physician 
• (Serious) adverse drug reactions ((S)ADR) 
• Selected clinical laboratory tests (IgG and thrombocytes for immunodeficiency and ITP respectively, 
where measured for the clinical indication). 
Sample size 
As this was not a confirmatory study, an estimation of the sample size with statistical methods was not 
done. The number of patients was set to 5,000 on a practical basis, considering estimates for the 
number of centers willing to participate and the number of eligible patients, the expected percentage of 
patients willing to participate, and a feasible study duration. 
EMA/578878/2022

Statistical Methods 
The statistical analysis was based on the statistical analysis plan (SAP). All patients with an age of <18 
years and at least one dose of Privigen were included in this analysis. Parts of the qualitative criteria 
were the number of patients, the absolute and the relative frequency of each characteristic. The 
quantitative criteria were the number of cases as well as the maximum, minimum, 1st quantile, 
median, 3rd quantile, mean, standard error and standard deviation. No statistical hypotheses were 
formulated. 
All observations pertaining to safety and tolerability were analysed according to the clinical description, 
action taken, frequency, severity, likelihood of being related and outcome, as well as according to their 
correlation with the dose and infusion rate. Adverse drug reactions were coded according to MedDRA 
(version 24.1) and grouped according to PT (Preferred Term) and SOC (System Organ Class). 
Results 
Participant flow 
In total, 5,049 patients were included in the NIS by 279 centers (243 active centers). Thirteen patients 
were less than 18 years old at inclusion (0.3% = 13/5,049). These patients were treated in 8 centers 
(2.9% = 8/279); 6 of them enrolled one paediatric patient each, one center enrolled 3 paediatric 
patients and one center 4 paediatric patients. Two of the 13 patients exceeded the age of 18 years 
during study treatment. The present analysis included only the therapy cycles that were performed 
during the time when these patients were less than 18 years old (47 therapy cycles in 2 patients 
excluded for age on reaching 18 years). The statistical analysis included a total of 42 CRFs with 223 
therapy cycles with Privigen. The analysed therapy cycles were performed from 22-Sep-2008 to 18- 
Sep-2018. The mean (SD) observation period was 15.5 ± 30.1 months per patient (median: 
3.6 months/patient). 
Recruitment 
Overall, 5049 patients were recruited, including 13 paediatric patients. First date of an infusion: 2008-
09-11, last date of an study visit or follow up visit 2021-09-03. 
Baseline data 
Out of the 13 paediatric patients, 8 patients were female (61.5%) and 5 were male (38.5%). The 
mean age was 12.3 ± 4.6 years at inclusion (median: 13 years). 3 patients had an age of 2 to 11 
years (defined as children). The age of the other 10 patients was between 12 and <18 years (defined 
as adolescents). The mean weight was 44.7 ± 20.3 kg (median: 48 kg) and the mean height was 
150.0 ± 24.7 cm (median: 162 cm). The baseline characteristics stratified by gender are shown in 
table 1. 
The indication for Privigen treatment at inclusion was in 30.8% a primary immunodeficiency (PID, 
4/13), in 23.1% immune thrombocytopenia (ITP, 3/13) and in 46.2% other indications (6/13) (figure 
1). Previous treatments with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) before start of study treatment were 
documented in seven paediatric patients (53.8% = 7/13). One of these patients was treated with IVIG 
more than 12 months before the first Privigen infusion, and five patients were treated with IVIG within 
12 months before the first Privigen infusion. The time period of IVIG pre-treatment was unknown in 
one patient. There were no previous treatments with IVIG in six patients (46.2% = 6/13).

Number analysed 
Efficacy results 
The analysed paediatric patients received 230 Privigen infusions. The mean number of infusions was 18 
± 32 infusions per patient. Patients with PID received 122 infusions (31 ± 49 infusions/patient), 
patients with ITP were treated with a total of 18 infusions (6.0 ± 5.3 infusions/patient) and patients 
with other indications received 90 Privigen infusions (15 ± 28 infusions/patient). The average dose per 
infusion was 13.5 ± 4.9 g Privigen (median: 12.5 g/infusion). This corresponded to a body weight-
related dose of 0.31 ± 0.13 g/kg body weight (BW) per infusion (median: 0.291 g/kg BW). The highest 
dose was administered in patients with ITP, and the lowest dose was given in patients with other 
indications. The duration of infusions was in the mean 68 ± 51 minutes per infusion (median: 60 min). 
Patients with ITP had the longest duration per infusion (table 2). 
Data of Privigen treatment were also analysed in therapy cycles. In patients with ITP, one therapy 
cycle comprised all infusions given within a time period of 10 days. In patients with other indications 
than ITP, the time period was 18 days. In accordance with these definitions, a total of 223 therapy 
cycles were analysed. The patients had in the mean 17 therapy cycles (median: 6 therapy cycles). 
Most therapy cycles were documented in patients with PID (121 therapy cycles; 30 ± 49 therapy 
cycles/patient) and the least number in patients with ITP (12 therapy cycles; 4.0 ± 5.2 therapy 
EMA/578878/2022  
Page 7/12 
 
  
 
 
 
 
cycles/patient). Patients with other indication had 90 therapy cycles (15 ± 28 therapy cycles/patient). 
The total infused Privigen dose per therapy cycle was in the mean 13.9 ± 8.9 g (median: 12.5 g). This 
corresponded to a body weight-related dose of 0.32 ± 0.18 g/kg BW (median: 0.29 g/kg BW). The 
dose was the highest in patients with ITP and the lowest in patients with other indications (table 2). 
The application of a premedication shortly before Privigen infusion was documented in nine therapy 
cycles (4.0% = 9/223); seven cycles in patients with PID, and one cycle each in patients with ITP and 
in patients with other indications. The used premedication was documented in eight of the nine cycles 
(88.9% = 8/9), most frequently corticosteroids (87.5% = 7/8; other: 12.5% = 1/8).  
Laboratory data 
With regard to laboratory data, the present statistics contains the analysis of IgG values in patients 
with PID and thrombocyte counts in patients with ITP. 
An IgG value within seven days before start of a therapy cycle was documented in 70.2% of therapy 
cycles in paediatric patients with PID (70.2% = 85/121). The mean IgG value was 6.3 ± 1.2 g/l 
(median: 5.9 g/l). IgG values within seven days after the start of the therapy cycle were not 
documented.  
Thrombocyte counts within seven days before start of the therapy cycle were available in all 12 
therapy cycles in patients with ITP. Thrombocyte counts within seven days after the start of the 
therapy cycle were documented in five therapy cycles (41.7% = 5/12). The time period between the 
value before start of therapy cycle and the value after the start of the cycle was 3.4 ± 1.7 days in the 
mean (median: 3 days). The mean thrombocyte count within seven days before the therapy cycle was 
16,000 ± 22,998 cells/μl (median: 8,500 cells/μl). The thrombocyte count within seven days after start 
of the therapy cycle was 183,600 ± 184,858 cell/μl (median: 144,000 cells/μl). The difference between 
both thrombocyte counts was calculated for the five therapy cycles with both values. Here, the 
thrombocyte count increased by 172,000 ± 177,665 cells/μl (median: 131,000 cell/μl) from 
determination before the therapy cycle to determination after start of the cycle.  
Infections in paediatric patients with PID 
EMA/578878/2022  
Page 8/12 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Infections were documented in 34 therapy cycles in 4 paediatric patients with PID (28.1% = 34/121). 
With a total observation period of 9.2 patient years, this yields a rate of 3.7 infections per year. More 
than half of the infections were infections of the upper airways (58.8% = 20/34). Acute bronchitis or 
acute exacerbation of a chronic bronchitis was present in 5 therapy cycles (14.7% = 5/34) and other 
infections in 9 therapy cycles (26.5% = 9/34). A causal pathogen was identified in 4 infections (11.8% 
= 4/34). The majority of infections were mild (73.5% = 25/34); the other 9 infections were of 
moderate intensity (26.5% = 9/34). None of the documented infections was serious according to the 
definition in EMA/CHMP/BPWP/94033/2007 rev. 3 (8). The duration of the documented infections was 
9.8 ± 13.8 days in the mean (median: 5 days). A therapy with antibiotics, antimycotics or antiviral 
agents was reported in 9 infections (26.5% = 9/34). 
Bleeding events in paediatric patients with ITP 
Surgical procedures in paediatric patients with ITP were not documented during study treatment. An 
event with prolonged or increased bleeding was reported in one therapy cycle (8.3% = 1/12). This 
event was of mild intensity. An additional medication for the treatment of ITP beside Privigen was 
documented in one therapy cycle (8.3% = 1/12). The medication was a corticosteroid. A splenectomy 
was not performed. 
Discontinuation of treatment of Privigen 
Privigen treatment was discontinued in eight patients (61.5% = 8/13). In total 11 entries regarding 
the reason for discontinuation could by analysed. The most frequent reasons were change of therapy 
to other IVIG, good response to Privigen therapy and insufficient tolerability (each: 18.2% = 2/11). 
Assessment of effectiveness and tolerability of Privigen in paediatric patients 
Assessments of the effectiveness and the tolerability of Privigen by the physicians were documented at 
the end of every CRF. Since long-term treatments were documented in more than one CRF, there was 
usually more than one assessment of effectiveness and tolerability per patient. The present report 
includes the assessment in the last CRF of each patient as well as the median assessment over all CRFs 
of a patient. 
Effectiveness of Privigen documented in the last CRF of a patient was very good in 69.2% of paediatric 
patients (9/13), good in 15.4% (2/13) and moderate in 15.4% (2/13). Insufficient effectiveness was 
not documented. The median assessments over all CRFs of a patient did not differ from the 
assessments in the last CRFs (figure 2). 
EMA/578878/2022  
Page 9/12 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The assessment of tolerability of Privigen was as follows: very good tolerability in 69.2% of 
the assessments in the last CRF of each patient (9/13) and good tolerability in 15.4% (2/13). 
Moderate and insufficient tolerability was documented in one case each (7.7% = 1/13). In the 
assessments over all CRFs of a patient using medians, the tolerability was very good in 
76.9% (10/13). It was good, moderate and insufficient in one patient each (7.7% = 1/13) 
(figure 3). 
Safety results 
Adverse Events and Adverse Reactions in paediatric patients 
Adverse drug reaction were documented in three paediatric patients (23.1% = 3/13). The investigators 
submitted six ADRs reports for these three patients. One patient was affected by one ADR, one patient 
by two ADRs and one patient by four ADRs. Thus, a total of seven adverse drug reactions were 
documented. The adverse drug reactions were coded according to MedDRA. The events were headache 
(SOC: nervous system disorders) (85.7% = 6/7) and nausea (SOC: gastrointestinal disorders) (14.3% 
= 1/7). None of the events was serious. A causal relationship to Privigen treatment was rated by the 
investigators highly probable in one case (14.3% = 1/7) and possible in all other cases (85.7% = 6/7).  
In the first phase of the study (2008-2015), reporting of adverse events without causal relationship to 
Privigen treatment was not required per protocol; only in the second phase (2016-2021), reporting of 
all adverse event (irrespective of causality) was required. Only 3 of the 13 patients (23%) had 
treatment cycles in the second phase (43 cycles, 19%), therefore we did not analyze adverse events 
rated as not related to Privigen by the investigator. An off label-use was documented in 4 patients: 2 
patients with multiple sclerosis, 1 patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and 1 patient with Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome. 
No overdose of Privigen, pregnancy during study treatment or the death of a patient during 
study treatment were reported in the paediatric population. A lack of effect was stated in one patient 
(7.7% = 1/13; Lennox-Gastaut syndrome / West syndrome). 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The submitted report is the final report of study results in paediatric patients; the MAH is currently 
preparing the full clinical study report, which will contain data from these paediatric and all adult 
patients and will be submitted as a second step as agreed with the EMA.

The objective of this non-interventional study conducted in Germany was the evaluation of the 
effectiveness and tolerability of Privigen in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency 
as well as different autoimmune diseases of all ages in clinical practice. Outcomes were defined as 
occurrence of infections in patients with immunodeficiency (including kind of infection, severity, 
duration and treatment), occurrence of bleeding events in patients with ITP, effectiveness and 
tolerability as assessed by the treating physician, adverse drug reactions and selected clinical 
laboratory tests. 
5049 were included in this open-label multi-centre observational study between 11 September 2008 
and 03 September 2021, thereof 13 paediatric patients. The analysed therapy cycles of the paediatric 
patient, were performed from 22 September 2008 to 18 September 2018. The mean (SD) observation 
period was 15.5 ± 30.1 months per patient. Privigen was administered based on physician’s choice 
according to the SmPC, no specific exclusion criteria had been defined. Patients were specifically 
monitored as to the infusion rate, the safety, tolerability and efficacy. All medical measures were 
arranged by the physician according to the respective clinical practice and guidelines. Overall, up to 6 
therapy cycles with Privigen could be recorded per patient, the respective treatment cycles comprised 
all Privigen infusions within a period of 18 days after the initial infusion. Data on undesirable events 
and drug reactions since the previous visit, laboratory test results (e.g. IgG, γ-globulin, and 
thrombocytes), dose, infusion rate, and indication-specific efficacy parameters were collected 
throughout the observation period. The statistical analysis included all patients with an age of <18 
years and at least one dose of Privigen.  
6/13 (46.2%) patients had been treatment-naïve, 7/13 (53.8%) patients had had previous treatments 
with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) before study entry (treatment duration > 1 year in 1/7, 1 
year in 5/7, unknown in 1/7 patients). 4/13 (30.8%) had a diagnosis of PID, 3/13 (23.1%) suffered 
from ITP and 6/13 (46.2%) had other indications such as Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1), Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome (1), West syndrome (1), Multiple sclerosis (2), and Susceptibility to infections with 
complications (1). Privigen was used off-label in 4/13 patients with Multiple sclerosis, Lennox-Gastaut 
syndrome and West syndrome.  
The patients had in the mean 17 therapy cycles (median: 6 therapy cycles). Most therapy cycles were 
documented in patients with PID (121 therapy cycles; 30 ± 49 therapy cycles/patient) and in patients 
with ITP (12 therapy cycles; 4.0 ± 5.2 therapy cycles/patient). Patients with other indication had 90 
therapy cycles (15 ± 28 therapy cycles/patient). PID and ITP patients received a mean dose of Privigen 
consistent with the recommended posology. In paediatric patients with PID, the dose regimen achieved 
a trough IgG level of at least 6 g/l in all documented treatment cycles (85/121), which is an acceptable 
target for infection prevention in PID. No serious bacterial infection was reported. The observed annual 
infection rate is consistent with the rate in the pivotal trial and comparable to a paediatric population 
without primary diseases. ITP patients had an adequate increase of thrombocyte counts after Privigen 
administration, and only one mild bleeding event was recorded; however, the difference between the 
thrombocyte counts seven days before and after the start of the therapy cycle was only calculated for 
5/12 therapy cycles of the ITP patients.    
Treating physicians assessed the overall effectiveness of Privigen as good or very good for 11 out of 13 
(85%) patients, and moderate for 2 out of 13 patients (15%). The tolerability was acceptable for the 
majority of the 13 patients, and moderate and insufficient in 2/13 (15%), which resulted in 
discontinuation of Privigen. Moreover, 4 patients changed the IVIG product for unknown reasons. 
It is noted that a revision of safety reporting was introduced in 2016; since then reporting of all 
adverse events irrespective of causality was required per protocol, whereas within 2008-2015 reporting 
of adverse events without causal relationship to Privigen treatment was not. As 3 out of 13 patients 
were treated during the second treatment phase since 2016, the MAH decided to only provide data on 
ADRs; thus, no additional adverse event data are available throughout the second phase. Overall, 7 
ADRs were documented in 3 patients, 6 thereof were treatment-related headache, and 1 nausea. 
These observed ADRs are (very) commonly observed under IVIG therapy. However, the included 
patient number is too limited to assess the quantity and quality of ADRs in this unselected patient 
population under real life conditions.

3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Based on the submitted report, post-marketing information is available for merely 13 paediatric 
patients. Available data indicate an adequate effectiveness; however, efficacy parameters were only 
documented for a limited number of treatment cycles in all included indications. The overall tolerability 
was acceptable based on the physician’s assessment. The MAH provided data on documented ADRs, 
however, no adverse event data is available for the longest period of the study. These facts are a 
shortcoming regarding the usability and interpretability of the collected paediatric safety data. Based 
on these data it is impossible to draw any reliable conclusion on the paediatric safety profile of 
Privigen. Currently, no urgent action as to amendments of the product information is deemed 
necessary until the availability of the final study report, which is expected in September 2022.  
No comments from member states were received.

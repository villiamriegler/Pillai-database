2.1.1.  SOB-clin-003: final results of the DREAMM-2 (205678) study 
The MAH has provided the final study results of DREAMM-2 (205678); a phase II, open label, randomized, 
two-arm study to investigate the efficacy and safety of two dose levels (2.5 and 3.4 mg/kg) of Blenrep

The  data  cut  for  the  final  analysis  occurred  on  04 May 2022  and  the  final  clinical  study  report  was 
published on 10 October 2022. As of 01 December 2022, 46 months since the Last Subject First Visit 
(LSFV),  there  are  3 participants  receiving  BLENREP  (belantamab  mafodotin)  in  the  Post-Analysis 
In  order  to  confirm  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  BLENREP  in  multiple

MAH  should  submit  the  results  of  the  DREAMM-3  (207495)  study 
comparing the efficacy of belantamab mafodotin vs. pomalidomide plus 
low dose dexamethasone (pom/dex) in patients with relapsed/refractory 
multiple myeloma.

Final  analysis  consisted  of  196 participants  with  relapsed,  refractory  multiple  myeloma  (RRMM) 
randomized  to  either  belantamab  mafodotin  (frozen  solution)  2.5 mg/kg  cohort  (n=97)  or  3.4 mg/kg 
cohort (n=99), with a median duration of follow-up of 12.5 months and 13.8 months respectively. In a 
third independent cohort, 25 participants received a lyophilized presentation of belantamab mafodotin 
The provided final study results of DREAMM-2 with regard to efficacy are in line with the results provided 
during the MA evaluation (13-month FU data cut-off date of 31 January 2020). At that time 11% (10/95)

The MAH provided the primary analysis of DREAMM-3 (207495); a phase III, open-label, randomized

for inclusion in this annual renewal submission. However, the results of the DREAMM-3 primary analysis 
have been described within the Interim Report for SOBs. The data cut-off for the initial interim report

A SAG was consulted (7th of September 2023), concerning available efficacy and safety data for Blenrep.

In summary, Blenrep was approved based on a promising level of activity (ORR), which was considered 
likely  to  translate  into  clinical  benefit,  notwithstanding  the  abovementioned  toxicity  profile.  The 
DREAMM-3 study was agreed as SOB to confirm the assumption of clinical benefit. Since this study failed

indication has not been demonstrated. 
The Committee re-assessed the benefit/risk of Blenrep as part of the annual renewal procedure, 
taking into account the totality of data, which includes the data at the time of the conditional 
approval and, the additional data from studies DREAMM-2 and DREAMM-3 generated as per the 
specific obligations. 
Evidence for the use of Blenrep in its approved indication was based on the objective response 
rate observed in a trial without a reference treatment arm allowing for the isolation of effects on 
PFS and OS. Therefore, efficacy was expected to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial 
with a relevant reference regimen (DREAMM-3 (207495)). However, the primary analysis of the 
confirmatory study for Blenrep failed to demonstrate clinical benefit in terms of progression free 
survival or overall survival. Thus, the favourable benefit/risk balance of Blenrep in its approved 
indication has not been confirmed as required in the setting of a CMA.

The objective of this SOB-clin-003 is to confirm the efficacy and safety of BLENREP in relapsed/refractory

The final analysis consisted of 196 participants with RRMM randomized to either belantamab mafodotin

data  emerged  are  compliant  in  terms  of  adherence  to  deadlines  and  are  compliant  in  terms  of 
anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
The SOB-clin-003 is considered fulfilled. The SOB-clin-004 was initially due to be fulfilled in July 2024 
when the final clinical study report will be available. However, as the results of the primary analysis for 
PFS are already available, it can be concluded that the study has failed to confirm efficacy as requested 
Last remaining SOB04 cannot be considered fulfilled as the study failed to confirm the efficacy of Blenrep 
for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients, who received at least four prior therapies and 
whose disease is refractory to at least one proteasome inhibitor, one immunomodulatory agent, and an

The outcome of the early progression event analysis should be viewed and interpreted in the context of 
the baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the entire DREAMM-3 population. Overall, the 
baseline characteristics were balanced in participants in the belantamab mafodotin group respect to most 
factors, however the participants in the belantamab mafodotin group were more heavily pre-treated with

The intra-group comparison (early progressors vs ongoing) in both groups showed that early progressors

more likely to have ISS stage III, higher secretion of M-protein, higher baseline sBCMA, higher Beta-2

The assessment of early progression events highlights several important points:

Characteristics of Participants Experiencing Early Death 
While the KM curves for OS show a great degree of overlap between belantamab mafodotin and pom/dex 
(Interim Report for Specific Obligations Section 3.5.2, Figure 5), the initial flattening of the belantamab 
mafodotin KM curves occurs at around 4 months. This timepoint also coincides with the PFS KM crossing 
There  are  many  baseline  characteristics  that  distinguish  early  progressors  from  early  ongoing 
participants  equally  in  both  groups.  Most  of  these  characteristics  are  reflective  of  an  advanced

In the updated DREAMM-3 OS analysis (DCO: 3Mar23), an additional 23 OS events were reported, 14 in

37.5%  to  44.6%  (Table  7).  It  should  be  noted  that  10  of  these  events  occurred  prior  to  the  12-

In the updated PFS analysis (DCO: 3Mar23) an additional 15 PFS events occurred, 8 in the belantamab

since the primary DCO is higher in the pom/dex group. 
The additional ~6 months of follow-up have resulted in a change to the PFS HR from 1.03 to 0.92, with 
the point estimate now being <1 (Table 8) and the RMST difference and ratio changed in line with the

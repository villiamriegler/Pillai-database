Scientific conclusions 
Overall summary of the scientific evaluation of emergency contraceptives medicinal 
products containing levonorgestrel or ulipristal acetate  
Emergency contraceptives can be used to prevent an unintended pregnancy following an 
unprotected sexual intercourse or in case of failure of a contraceptive method. The emergency 
contraceptives can be divided into levonorgestrel (LNG)- and ulipristal acetate (UPA)-containing 
emergency contraceptives and they act by inhibiting and/or delaying ovulation. 
The use of emergency contraception is an occasional method that is far less effective compared 
with most contraceptive products used on a regular basis, e.g. combined hormonal contraceptives, 
gestagen-only pills and various long-acting methods like intra-uterine devices and implants.  
On 16 January 2014 the Swedish Agency sent a notification for a referral under Article 31 of 
directive 2001/83 EC regarding all emergency contraceptives containing LNG or UPA asking the 
CHMP to give its opinion on whether the marketing authorisations should be maintained, varied, 
suspended or withdrawn. The CHMP was requested to assess whether the efficacy of emergency 
contraceptives is affected in relation to body weight and/or body mass index (BMI) of the women. 
The CHMP reviewed all data from clinical studies, published literature, post-marketing experience, 
including responses submitted by the marketing authorisation holders (MAHs), on the efficacy of 
emergency contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA, in particular with regards to 
the relation of high weight/BMI of women. 
Levonorgestrel (LNG) 
LNG is a synthetic progestagen. For emergency contraception one tablet of 1.5 mg LNG needs to 
be taken, or two tablets of 0.75 mg LNG at once. The products are indicated for emergency 
contraception within 72 hours (3 days) of unprotected sexual intercourse or contraceptive failure, 
and have been approved in more than 100 countries worldwide and used for more than 30 years. 
Eight relevant studies with LNG-containing emergency contraceptives are available in public 
literature.  
During the data submission an analysis was provided on three WHO studies (Von Hertzen et al., 
1998 1 and 2002 2; Dada et al., 2010 3) as well as an analysis on two other studies (Creinin et al., 
2006 4; Glasier et al., 2010 5). 
The rest of the studies have been submitted in the form of published literature.  
There are limited and inconclusive data from clinical trials that evaluated the effect of high body 
weight/high BMI on the contraceptive efficacy. In the meta-analysis including the three WHO 
studies, primarily including African and Asian women, no trend for a reduced efficacy with 
increasing body weight/BMI was observed (Table 1). In contrast, in the two comparative studies of 
Creinin and colleagues (2006) and Glasier and colleagues (2010), primarily including Caucasian 
women, a reduced contraceptive efficacy was observed with increasing body weight or BMI (Table

label use of LNG) and women who had further acts of unprotected intercourse.

The data are currently too limited and therefore insufficiently precise to draw definite conclusions 
whether efficacy is negatively influenced by increased body weight and BMI; for instance for the 
obese category (BMI ≥30) three pregnancies were reported in the first analysis, and eleven 
pregnancies in the second. It is unknown what the explanation is for the contradicting results in 
both meta-analyses. All together, the current data are considered not robust enough to support the 
current recommendation of decreased efficacy in women with body weight above 75 kg and 
inefficacy in women with body weight above 80 kg as is currently included in the product 
information of one  
LNG-containing emergency contraceptive medicinal product (Norlevo).  
A range of different factors have an impact on a woman´s fertility and the ability of emergency 
contraceptives to prevent a pregnancy, e.g. timing of intake of emergency contraception in relation 
to intercourse, conception probability, further acts of unprotected intercourse, age, ethnicity, 
previous infections of the genital tract,  male fertility, etc. This is reflected in the wide range of 
estimates of prevented fraction across different studies. Therefore, even if data from some studies 
suggest a lower ability of LNG-containing emergency contraceptives to prevent pregnancies in 
women of higher weight/BMI, this is only one factor influencing the effect and it is difficult to define 
a certain cut-off for weight/BMI at which no effect is present.  
Overall for of LNG-containing emergency contraceptives it is concluded that there is limited data on 
the effect of high body weight/high BMI on the contraceptive efficacy.  
The CHMP proposed that a warning in section 4.4 of the summary of product characteristics 
(SmPC) is an appropriate routine risk minimisation measure to reflect that limited and inconclusive 
data are present regarding a possible reduced efficacy in women with a high body weight/BMI. 
Further, the data of the two meta-analyses should be reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. This 
information should also be reflected in the package leaflet. Further, since the limited data available 
do not support with any certainty the conclusion that their contraceptive effect is reduced in 
women with high bodyweight, no adjustment of the dose is recommended at this stage, and any 
29 
 
 
 
 
information that already is included in the section 4.2 of the SmPC making reference to effect and 
body weight should be removed. 
Ulipristal acetate (UPA) 
Ulipristal acetate (UPA) (30 mg) (ellaOne) is an orally synthetic progesterone receptor modulator, 
which acts via high affinity binding to the human progesterone receptor. The product is indicated 
for emergency contraception within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected sexual intercourse or 
contraceptive failure. UPA has been approved in 73 countries worldwide and it is being marketed 
for five years. 
The data used in the analyses of effect of UPA in relation to weight/BMI are partly based on the 
same studies two abovementioned studies for LNG, and another randomised controlled study 
(HRA2914-507, HRA2914-508, HRA2914-513) as well as an open label study (HRA2914-509). 
Similar analyses were performed. A trend was observed in the UPA group for increasing number of 
pregnancies with increasing weight or BMI. However, the analyses are based on a limited number 
of women, especially in the highest body weight/BMI categories, which subsequently result in very 
wide and overlapping 95% confidence limits. 
While the analyses of data from the three randomised controlled trials in which 2,098 women 
received UPA indicate a weak effect of body weight or BMI on pregnancy rates, the open label 
study (n=1,241) indicated no such effect. From these data there is no clear indication of an effect 
of weight or BMI on efficacy in general, or specifically among overweight or obese women.  
The data are currently too limited and therefore insufficiently precise to draw definite conclusions 
whether efficacy is negatively influenced by increased body weight and BMI.

The CHMP concluded that a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC is appropriate to indicate that 
limited and inconclusive data are present regarding a possible reduced efficacy in women with a 
high body weight/BMI and that in all women emergency contraception should be taken as soon as 
possible after unprotected intercourse, regardless of the woman’s body weight or BMI. Further, the 
data of the meta-analysis should be presented in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
The information in the SmPC should also be reflected in the package leaflet. 
In addition the CHMP is of the opinion that conducting a pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic 
(PD/PK) study may provide some information which may help to further characterise the risk of 
decreased efficacy in women with high body weight/BMI and ovulation inhibition. Considering the 
need to further characterise this risk, the MAHs are strongly recommended to investigate the 
pharmacodynamic effect (ovulation inhibition) of LNG in obese women in the future.

Overall conclusion 
For LNG-containing emergency contraceptives overall it is concluded that there is limited and 
inconsistent data on the effect of high body weight/high BMI on the contraceptive efficacy. In the 
three WHO studies (Von Hertzen et al., 1998 and 2002; Dada et al., 2010) no trend for a reduced 
efficacy with increasing body weight/BMI was observed, whereas in the two other studies (Creinin 
et al., 2006 and Glasier et al., 2010) a reduced contraceptive efficacy was observed with increasing 
body weight or BMI. Both meta-analyses excluded off-label use of LNG-containing of emergency 
contraceptives, i.e. intake later than 72 hours after unprotected intercourse and women who had 
further acts of unprotected intercourse. 
For UPA-containing emergency contraceptive products (ellaOne) it is concluded that limited and 
inconclusive data suggest that there may be reduced efficacy of UPA with increased body weight in 
women. Further, in all women emergency contraception should be taken as soon as possible after 
unprotected intercourse. 
Benefit –risk balance 
The Committee concluded that the benefit-risk balance of emergency contraceptive medicinal 
products containing LNG or UPA remains positive for all women regardless of body weight/BMI, 
subject to the warnings and changes to the product information agreed. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation  
Whereas 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The Committee considered the procedure under Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC for the 
emergency contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA. 
The Committee reviewed all data from clinical studies, published literature, post-marketing 
experience, including responses submitted by the marketing authorisation holders (MAHs), 
on the efficacy of emergency contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA, in 
particular with regards to a possible effect of high weight/BMI of women. 
The CHMP concluded that the available data is limited and does not support a definite 
conclusion that increased bodyweight reduces efficacy of emergency contraceptives 
medicinal products containing LNG or UPA. Available data should be included in the product 
information, but no restrictions of use based on body weight/BMI are recommended at this 
stage. 
The Committee considered that in view of the currently available data, the benefit-risk 
balance of emergency contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA is 
favourable, subject to warnings and other changes to the product information. In 
particular, limited but inconclusive data suggest that there may be reduced efficacy of 
these medicinal products with increased body weight in women. 
The Committee, as a consequence, concluded that the benefit-risk balance of emergency 
contraceptive medicinal products containing LNG or UPA remains positive, subject to the warnings 
and changes to the product information agreed.

The Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to the EMEA on 9 August 2000 an application 
for  a  type  I  variation  falling  within  the  scope  of  item  No.  1  of  Annex  I  to  Commission 
Regulation  (EC)  No  542/95.  The  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  applied  to  change  in  the 
premises  of  one  of  the  manufacturing  sites  responsible  for  batch  release.  On  20  September 
2000,  the  EMEA  issued  the  corresponding  notification  (EMEA/H/C/219/I/01).  This  variation 
required amendments  to annexes II and IIIB of  the  Community Marketing Authorisation. The 
respective Commission Decision was issued on 15 January 2001. 
On 20 February 2001, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted an application for a type II 
variation  in  accordance  with  the  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No  542/95,  as  amended.  The 
Marketing Authorisation Holder applied to demonstrate compliance with Commission Directive 
1999/82/EC  and  the  Note  for  Guidance  on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal 
Spongiform  Encephalopathy Agents via Medicinal Products (CPMP/BWP/1230/98 rev.1), and 
provided  certificates  of  suitability  issued  by  the  European  Pharmacopoeia  for  the  materials 
listed 
the  variation 
(EMEA/H/C/219/II/02),  which  did  not  require  any  amendment  to  the  Community  Marketing 
Authorisation.  
in  Annex  B.  On  18  October  2001, 
the  CPMP  approved 
Pursuant to Article 13(2) of Council Regulation No. 2309/93 and Part 4G of the Annex to Council 
Directive  75/318/EEC,  the Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  provided  throughout the first year of 
the Marketing Authorisation additional data as stated in Annex IIC to Commission Decision, which 
formed  the  basis  of  the  annual  re-assessment  of  the  benefit/risk  profile  of  Ammonaps.  On  25 
January  2001,  the  CPMP,  having  reviewed  the  evidence  of  compliance  with  the  specific 
obligations  submitted  by  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  and  having  re-assessed  the 
benefit/risk  profile  of  the  medicinal  product,  informed  the  European  Commission  that  no 
updating  of  Annex  I  and  III  to  the  Community  Marketing  Authorisation  for  the  medicinal 
product is required. The CPMP opinion included a revised list of specific obligations of Annex 
II.C.  to  the  Community  Marketing  Authorisation  (EMEA/H/C/219/S/2).  The  respective 
Commission Decision was issued on 6 June 2001.

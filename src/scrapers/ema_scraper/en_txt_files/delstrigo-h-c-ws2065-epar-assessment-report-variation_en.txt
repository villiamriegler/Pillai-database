2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Combination antiviral therapy with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) protease and reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors has significantly reduced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related 
morbidity and mortality. However, emerging multi-class drug-resistant human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV) strains as well as potential long-term toxicities warrant development of new antiretroviral therapies 
without or with limited cross-resistance to available drugs. 
Disease or condition 
Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Delstrigo is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of 
resistance to the NNRTI class, lamivudine, or tenofovir (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Delstrigo is also indicated for the treatment of adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 
kgs who are infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class, 
lamivudine, or tenofovir and who have experienced toxicities which preclude the use of other regimens 
that do not contain tenofovir disoproxil (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Pifeltro is indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of 
adults, adolescents and children weighing at least 35 kgs infected with HIV-1 without past or present 
evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Epidemiology 
HIV-1 infection remains a major public health concern. In a 2020 report, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) estimated that in 2019 there were 1.7 million [1.2 million-2.2 million] new HIV-1 infections 
worldwide. Of the 1.7 million estimated new infections, 1.5 million [1.1 million-2.0 million] were adults 
and 150,000 [94,000-240,000] were in children less than 15 years of age. Approximately 84% of child 
infections occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, the global incidence of new HIV-1 infections among 
children less than 15 years of age has decreased over the past decade due to improved access to mother-
to-child prevention services. 
Biologic features 
HIV-infected children may have more rapid disease progression and accelerated damage of the 
developing immune system compared to adults, with higher viral loads and less effective immunological 
responses to HIV-1 infection than their adult counterparts. Of all global deaths in 2019, 95,000 [61,000–
150,000] were in children less than 15 years of age.

Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The clinical presentation and diagnosis of HIV is well-known and not further discussed in this assessment 
report. 
Management 
Treatment of HIV requires use of combination antiretroviral therapy. The choice of the combination 
regimen depends on the status of the patient, particularly in terms of plasma HIV viral load, CD4 cell 
counts, any previous treatment(s), prior treatment failure, and intolerance to treatment. The most 
commonly used guidelines are those developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [World Health 
Organization, 2019], the European AIDS Clinical Society (EACS) [EACS, 2019], the Department of Health 
and Human Services (DHHS) in the USA [Department of Health and Human Services, 2019] and the 
PENTA (for use in children and adolescents) [PENTA2019].  
Treatment options in children are more limited compared to adults. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Pifeltro (doravirine) and Delstrigo (doravirine/tenofovir disoproxil/lamivudine) are approved in the EU for 
the treatment of HIV-infection in adult patients. Doravirine is the most recently approved NNRTI, 
tenofovir and lamivudine are well known nucleoside analogues. The present indications read: Pifeltro is 
indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of adults infected 
with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Delstrigo is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of 
resistance to the NNRTI class, lamivudine, or tenofovir (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Draft CHMP guidelines (CPMP/EWP/633/2002 Rev. 3) on the “Clinical development of medicinal products 
for treatment of HIV infection” are available. 
The WSA did not seek Scientific advice at the CHMP.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
The study is stated to comply with the principles of Good Clinical Practice. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
The present application intends to extend the approved indication for doravirine (DOR) containing 
medicinal products (single active substance in Pifeltro and part of fixed dose combination (FDC) in 
Delstrigo which also contains lamivudine and tenofovir) to the paediatric population. A non-clinical 
overview has been provided to supports the supplemental marketing application for expanding the 
current use of DOR and the FDC tablet in adult patients with HIV-1 infection to include use in paediatric 
patients weighing ≥35 kg with HIV-1.

2.2.1.  Toxicology 
A brief summary of the toxicological dossiers is provided below. No combination toxicity studies have 
been conducted for the FDC. 
2.2.1.1.  Doravirine 
The DOR non-clinical safety program submitted in the original application for the adult indication is also 
used for this procedure. The DOR toxicology program included safety pharmacology studies, in-vitro and 
in-vivo genetic toxicity assays, repeat-dose oral toxicity studies in mice up to 3 months duration, in rats 
up to 6 months duration and in dogs up to 9 months duration, carcinogenicity studies in rats and rasH2 
transgenic mice, a male and female fertility study in rats, embryofoetal developmental studies in rats and 
rabbits, a pre-and post-natal developmental study in rats, and a study in juvenile rats. In the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies, the age of rats and dogs at the start of exposure (7-8w of age in rats in 3–6-month 
studies and 25w to 29w of age in dogs in 9-month study) corresponded roughly to human children or 
adolescent age, respectively. No adverse findings were observed at maximal feasible doses. In the rat 
juvenile toxicity study, exposure started from PND14. The genotoxicity assessment did not identify any 
genetic toxicity for DOR (in-vitro or in-vivo). The carcinogenicity studies (2-years in rats, 6 months in 
transgenic rasH2 mice) found no evidence of carcinogenic potential.  
2.2.1.1.1.  Developmental toxicity 
There were no adverse effects detected in the DART program including the prenatal and postnatal 
development study (PPND). In the rat juvenile toxicity study (exposure between PND14 and PND55, using 
doses up to 300mg/kg), there was no toxicity based on the endpoints of mortality, clinical signs, body 
weights, food consumption, developmental landmarks, open field motor activity, haematology and serum 
biochemistry parameters, gross observations, organ weight changes, or histomorphology changes.   
2.2.1.1.2.  Toxicokinetic data and exposure margins 
The clinical pharmacokinetic profile of DOR was similar in adults and paediatric patients weighing at least 
35 kg and there were no meaningful changes in exposure in paediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg, 
when compared to adults that would impact exposure margins. A 100 mg QD DOR clinical dose 
corresponds to a systemic geometric mean exposure of AUC0-24h of 37.8μM x hr and a Cmax of 2.26μM. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies, the DOR systemic AUC0-24h exposures achieved in animals were at 
least 5x above clinical AUC0-24h exposures at 100mg QD. For the rasH2 carcinogenicity study, the 
exposure margin to humans was ~6x while the 2-year rat study had an exposure margin of ≥7.5x. The 
AUC0-24h exposure margins for the rat juvenile toxicity study was ~9x. 
2.2.1.2.  Lamivudine 
The toxicological profile of lamivudine (3TC, oral exposure) has been evaluated in a standard toxicology 
program including repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 12 months duration in rats and dogs, a full 
genotoxicity program, rat and mouse ~2-year carcinogenicity studies and a full DART program. Toxicity 
findings in the general toxicity studies were reductions in red cell counts, occasionally associated with 
reductions in total lymphocyte counts (but without effects on bone marrow cytology) at supratherapeutic 
exposures. A modified PPND study involving exposure of pregnant and lactating rats plus the direct oral 
administration to their juvenile offspring did not identify any clinically relevant concerns for the paediatric 
patient population.

EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 10/63 
 
 
 
 
2.2.1.3.  Tenofovir 
Tenofovir (TDF) has been toxicologically characterized for oral exposure in repeat-dose toxicity studies 
using rats (up to 42w exposure), dogs (up to 42w exposure) and non-human primates (up to 24 months 
exposure), a full genotoxicity program, rat and mouse ~2-year carcinogenicity studies and a full DART 
program. Of interest to paediatric indications, renal and bone toxicity and a decrease in serum phosphate 
concentration was observed in the general toxicity studies. Renal toxicity was noted in all animal species 
tested. Increases in serum creatinine, BUN, glycosuria, proteinuria, phosphaturia, and/or calciuria and 
decreases in serum phosphate were observed to varying degrees in these animals. The bone toxicity was 
classified as osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs). The 
clinical relevance of the renal and bone findings presently unknown. 
2.2.1.3.1.  Toxicokinetic data and exposure margins 
The bone toxicity in young adult rats and dogs occurred at exposures ≥5x the exposure in paediatric or 
adult patients; bone toxicity occurred in juvenile monkeys ≥40-fold the exposure in patients. Renal 
toxicity was noted at AUC exposure margins of 2-20x.  
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has submitted a justification for not providing an updated ERA for the active substances. Based 
on PEC/PNEC ratios, the original ERA concluded that DOR is unlikely to pose a risk to the environment. 
DOR is also not considered a bioaccumulative or PBT substance/candidate. The MAH presented arguments 
that the assumptions in the previously approved ERA regarding patient population (present application for 
adult, applied for indication also for children and adolescents that weigh >35kg BW), dose, and market 
penetration remain relevant today (see discussion). 
2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The toxicological programs for Doravirine (DOR) and lamivudine (3TC) have not identified any toxicity 
that can be easily identified as being relevant for the paediatric population. For tenofovir (TDF), renal and 
bone toxicity has been observed across several animal species at exposure margins to humans that in 
some cases are <10x. The clinical relevance of these findings remains unclear. Overall, the provided non-
clinical overview is acceptable for the present application.  
Regarding the ERA(s), the applicant had not provided any updated ERA or an estimate how much the 
extension of the indication to children will increase the total exposure and simply claims that there will be 
no change in total exposure. This was resolved after submission of an updated ERA (solved in Annex 2).   
2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, this application of extension of indication to the paediatric population 12 years and older 
weighing at least 35 kgs for Delstrigo (doravirine, lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil) and Pifeltro 
(doravirine) in the treatment of HIV-1 does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure. 
Therefore, Delstrigo and Pifeltro are not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Based on data from P027 and population PK analysis, the PK of DOR 100 mg in the paediatric population 
weighing at least 35 kg administered alone or as DOR/3TC/TDF has been characterized. DOR steady-state 
PK in adolescents weighing at least 35 kg following administration of 100-mg QD DOR is similar to that in 
adults at the same dose. 
P027 study - PK 
A single Phase 1/2, PK, safety and tolerability trial (P027; also known as MK-1439 P027; or IMPAACT 
2014, DAIDS Study No. #34150) was conducted to support the approval of DOR and DOR/3TC/TDF in 
HIV-1 infected paediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg. The marketed formulations of DOR and 
DOR/3TC/TDF were used in this study and therefore no new biopharmaceutic studies were conducted 
beyond what was described in the 2.7.1 for the initial marketing applications submitted for the adult 
program.  
Cohort 1 will assess the PK of doravirine only (single dose). 
Cohort 2 will assess the steady-state sparse pharmacokinetics of DOR, 3TC, and tenofovir once  
daily in 40 evaluable participants weighing ≥35 kg (or the weight determined in Cohort 1), using  
intensive PK sampling at Week 1 and sparse PK sampling through 48 weeks. In addition, Cohort  
2 will evaluate the steady-state intensive pharmacokinetics of TFV and 3TC given as the FDC to  
the first 10 participants enrolled into Cohort 2. The study included 2 Cohorts with Intensive/sparse PK 
(see Table 1 below). 
Table 1: 
The analysis population was predominately Asian (65%) and black (32%), and the remainder white (4%), 
and equally distributed between male (48%) and female (52%). The overall median (range) for age and 
weight were 15 (12 to 17) years and 52 (40 to 91) kg, respectively.

A total of 395 PK samples were collected from 54 participants through Week 24. A total of 55 BLQ 
samples were excluded from the analysis, of which 53 were collected at Week 0 before the first 
administered DOR dose. 
Table 2: Summary of P027 PK Samples 
Methods 
Population PK modeling was performed with the software package NONMEM, version 7.3.0. The pediatric 
population PK model utilized the same structure as the final adult model. As a result, these parameters, 
along with residual error were estimated directly from the pediatric data. As the semi-intensive and 
sparse sampling schemes may limit the ability to precisely characterize DOR absorption for Cohort 2 
participants, ka was specified with an informative prior from the adult model. Similarly, interindividual 
variability on CL/F and V/F were also specified with informative priors from the adult model, due to the 
limited number of participants compared to the adult model. To capture anticipated weight-related 
changes in DOR disposition in the pediatric population, fixed-exponent allometry for CL/F and V/F were 
included. The estimates for parameters with Bayesian informative priors (absorption kA, covariate CLAGE, 
and IIV on CL/F and V/F) did not change significantly from the adult model.

Final adolescent model 
Table 3: Parameter estimates of the final DOR adolescent popPK model 
Model evaluation using visual predictive checks and goodness of fit plots showed that the paediatric 
model adequately described DOR plasma concentrations from P027. Estimates of individual SS PK 
parameters for each participant in P027 that were obtained from the final population PK model were 
compared against DOR PK from adults in the Phase 3 trials. Individual PK parameters were also used to 
investigate potential trends between DOR PK and intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Simulations of DOR 
steady-state PK for the 100-mg QD dose for a typical paediatric population (N=1000) weighing at least 
35 kg, regardless of age, were also conducted based on age and weight covariates sampled from the 
NHANES database. The simulated population also included individuals in the 35 to <45 kg weight range. 
Prediction-corrected (pc) visual predictive checks (pcVPCs) of DOR PK were  
generated according to Bergstrand et al. (2011) and demonstrate that the paediatric population  
PK model adequately characterizes DOR PK in adolescents. [Figure 1] shows the pcVPC for 
intensive PK from Cohorts 1 (single dose of 100 mg DOR) and 2 (at Week 1, with once daily  
dosing of DOR/3TC/TDF for all participants including those switching from EFV); [Figure 2] 
shows the pcVPC for all P027 PK data from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (intensive and sparse).

DOR exposure adolescents vs adults 
The DOR concentration-time profile in adolescent participants in Cohort 1 of P027 was similar to that 
observed in adults.

Figure 4 
Because only one P027 participant was in the 35 to <45 kg weight range and all participants were ≥12 
years of age, steady-state DOR exposures following administration of 100 mg QD in the paediatric 
population weighing ≥35 kg, regardless of age, were projected based on  covariates obtained from the 
NHANES database. The simulated NHANES paediatric population comprised 1,000 individuals with a 
median (range) age 13.2 (6.2, 17.9) years and median (range) weight of 53.6 (35.0, 159) kg.

from P027 were consistent with that achieved in adults and adolescents receiving the 300-mg dose of 
tenofovir disoproxil containing product. Consequently, the recommended 300-mg QD dose of TDF in the 
paediatric population ≥35 kg is also anticipated to result in similar PK when administered as part of 
DOR/3TC/TDF.

recommended dose of lamivudine containing product in this population. Steady-state 3TC AUC0-24 and 
Cmax in adolescents from P027 are presented below along with published single dose or stead-state PK

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The extrapolation approach (efficacy) is suitable for antiviral agents because the PD target is expected to 
respond similarly to similar exposure in both adult and paediatric patients. PK for Doravirine, lamivudine 
and tenofovir in adolescents weighing at least 35 kg is expected to be similar to adults. The applicant 
uses tenofovir disoproxil containing product and lamivudine containing product as references for Tenofovir 
and Lamivudine.  
A single Phase 1/2, PK, safety and tolerability trial (P027) was conducted to support the approval of DOR 
and DOR/3TC/TDF in HIV-1 infected paediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg. 
In study P027 (adolescents over 35 kg), the applicant studied same doses for lamivudine and TDF as 
approved as single agent and other fixed dose combinations. The plan regarding PK was to use all PK 
data for doravirine, lamivudine and tenofovir. However, for lamivudine and tenofovir, the applicant has 
only used semi-intensive PK data from cohort 2 and discarded the sparse PK-data from 35 subjects. This 
approach was questioned in round 1. The applicant has now provided a figure with all the observed data 
for lamivudine and tenofovir. The exposure from sparse sampling is overlapping with the exposure from 
the rich sampling. This provides support that the exposure metrics derived from the observed PK data for 
the intensive sampling are adequate.   
The paediatric population PK model for doravirine utilized the same structure as the final adult model. 
Allometric scaling with fixed exponents was included, this is supported. Age was included as a covariate; 
it is not understood why age was included on top of body weight based allometric scaling. However, since 
the age impact on clearance is very small for 12-17 years in the model, this issue is not further pursued.  
The company has provided new pcVPCs. Cmax is somewhat underpredicted but overall, the Doravirine 
popPK models’ predictive performance is deemed adequate.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 22/63 
 
 
 
 
 
The observed data as well as the model predicted exposure in P027 and the simulated exposure using 
NHANES population support that the Doravirine exposure in paediatric patients is similar to adults. While 
only one adolescent weighed under 45 kg in the P027 study, some adults weighed under 45 kg and the 
model predictions (using allometric scaling) are considered sufficient. 
Tenofovir and lamivudine PK in adolescents weighing at least 35 kg is expected to be similar to adults. 
The provided observed data support this. The observed data is however only from semi-intensive PK part 
of study P027. It appears that sparse PK data for tenofovir and lamivudine from 35 adolescents have 
been discarded. This is not considered good practice. Further, no popPK model was used for tenofovir or 
lamivudine. PopPK models would allow for incorporation of sparse PK data in the PK analysis.  
The main concern here is with regards to lack of long-term tenofovir safety data; with a limited paediatric 
program, the PK should be well characterized. There is large discrepancy in quality of PK data regarding 
what has been presented for Doravirine and what is presented for tenofovir and lamivudine. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The extrapolation approach (efficacy) is suitable for antiviral agents. Whenever safety concerns are not 
specific for adolescents and children, safety is also extrapolated from adults.  
With regards to tenofovir, long-term safety cannot be fully extrapolated from adults as tenofovir may 
have a different safety profile in subjects who are still growing. 
Doravirine exposure has generally been adequately characterized. The popPK model is considered 
adequate. The exposure in adolescents over 35 kg is similar to adults based on provided figures and the 
provided effects table.  
Without data, it is very probable that using same TDF and 3TC dose as in adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg 
for tenofovir disoproxil containing product and lamivudine containing product would be adequate also for 
Delstrigo. The company has now provided an adequate presentation of the observed tenofovir and 
lamivudine PK data and the dose is supported.  
All OCs regarding clinical pharmacology are resolved.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
There are no dose-response studies in this application. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Phase I/II Study of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Doravirine (MK-1439) and 
Doravirine/Lamivudine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (MK- 1439A) in HIV-1-infected Children 
and Adolescents 
MK-1439-027 (also known as International Maternal Paediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network 
[IMPAACT] 2014 and as Division of AIDS [DAIDS] Study No. #34150) is a Phase I/II multi-site, open-
label study of the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of doravirine (DOR) and 
doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DOR/3TC/TDF) in children and adolescents with HIV-
1 infection, 12 years to <18 years of age, and who weigh at least 35 kg. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 23/63 
 
 
 
 
The study is ongoing and efficacy data at 24 weeks and 48 weeks have been analysed. 
Methods 
Study participants 
MK-1439-027 enrolled 2 cohorts in staggered fashion. Cohort 1 assessed the PK and safety of a single, 
oral dose of DOR 100 mg, with intensive PK evaluation completed on Day 1. All participants had safety 
follow-up through 2 weeks post-dose. Following the enrolment of 9 evaluable participants in Cohort 1, of 
whom 8 weighed at least 45 kg, enrolment was paused while the PK and safety data were reviewed by 
the protocol team and the Study Monitoring Committee, with options of resuming enrolment into Cohort 
1, opening Cohort 2 enrolment, or assessing next steps for the study. Following this review, Cohort 2 was 
opened only to participants weighing at least 45 kg (because only 1 PK evaluable participant in Cohort 1 
weighed between 35 kg and ≤45 kg), while Cohort 1 enrolment of participants 35 kg to ≤45 kg remained 
open aiming to complete the target number of 4 participants. When the total enrolment target was 
achieved in Cohort 2, enrolment for the study was considered completed. No additional participants were 
enrolled in Cohort 1. 
Inclusion Criteria 
All the following criteria had to be met in order for individuals to be enrolled in this study: 
1.  Age 12 years to <18 years at entry 
2.  Weight greater than or equal 35 kg at entry 
3.  Confirmed HIV-1-infection based on documented testing of two samples collected at different 
timepoints 
4.  ART exposure, virologic suppression, and resistance requirements 
Exclusion Criteria 
Participants were excluded from the study if, at any time during the screening period, any of the following 
were identified: 
1.  Evidence of decompensated liver disease manifested by the presence of or a history of ascites, 
esophageal or gastric variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or other signs or symptoms of 
advanced liver diseases 
2.  For Cohort 2 only, detectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) by RNA PCR or current or planned treatment 
with direct antiviral agent for HCV 
3.  Presence of any active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection 
4.  Used, or anticipates using, chronic systemic immunosuppressive agents or systemic interferon 
(eg. for treatment of HCV infection) within 30 days prior to study entry 
5.  Diagnosed with current active tuberculosis and/or is currently being treated with a rifampicin-
containing regimen 
Treatments 
A single dose of DOR 100 mg was administered to participants in Cohort 1. 
The adult DOR/3TC/TDF tablet (100/300/300 mg) was administered once daily (QD) in Cohort 2. The 
doses of lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in DOR/3TC/TDF administered to 
adolescents were the recommended doses for this age and weight range based on the United States (US) 
and European Union prescribing information for TDF containing product and 3TC containing product.

The FDC oral granule formulation was made available to participants in Cohort 2 but was not used in this 
study. The contents of 3 capsules were equivalent to the adult dose of DOR 100 mg/3TC 300 mg/ TDF 
300 mg. 
Objectives 
Cohort 2 is a single-armed overall assessment of tolerability, with a limited number of participants and 
outcomes would be regarded as descriptive. Efficacy and safety are still bridged to that obtained in adults 
(provided similar drug exposures). However, TDF (renal/) bone toxicity is a specific issue, that have been 
considered of particular importance for growing youngsters in prior regulatory procedures. Having the 
single-arm design and lack of DEXA-scanning in mind, this study will not shed any further light on the 
safety concern of TDF. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety Assessment 
Safety and tolerability of DOR and DOR/3TC/TDF were evaluated by cohort based on assessment of 
adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and clinical laboratory values of all participants exposed to study 
intervention (the All Treated Population). Primary safety analyses were conducted with data through 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 25/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Week 2 for Cohort 1, and through week 24 for Cohort 2. Cumulative safety data including Week 48 are 
also available for Cohort 2 (safety update report-SUR). 
Efficacy Assessment 
Efficacy was a secondary endpoint evaluated in Cohort 2 only, evaluating plasma HIV-1 RNA at 24-, 48-, 
and 96-weeks. All efficacy analyses were conducted using the All Treated Population comprising 
participants who took at least 1 dose of study intervention. Missing values were addressed using the FDA 
Snapshot approach and the OF approach for virologic efficacy endpoints and OF approach for immunologic 
efficacy endpoints. Virologic efficacy by subgroup was analysed using both the OF and FDA Snapshot 
approaches; immunologic efficacy by subgroup was analysed by the OF approach.  
Both efficacy and safety endpoints are well-established in the field of HIV clinical trials. According to the 
2013 EMA draft guidelines on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of HIV 
infection, a specific demonstration of antiviral efficacy in paediatric patients is not required. As it is 
assumed that the PK/PD relation for a direct acting antiviral is roughly similar regardless of the age of the 
patient, the efficacy of a dose that yields sufficiently similar exposure in children, compared to adults, 
would be inferred. 
Sample size 
Cohort 1: Up to 20 participants to achieve at least 12 evaluable participants  
Cohort 2: Up to 45 participants to achieve at least 40 evaluable participants  
The study is not powered to allow a precise estimation efficacy or to generate a comprehensive safety 
database in children. Rather, efficacy and safety will primarily be bridged through PK/PD. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The study was not randomized or blinded. All participants were treated with the study drug. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis methods of efficacy 
The Primary Outcome Measures in study were safety. Virologic suppression and Immunologic response 
were included as a Secondary Outcome Measures in cohort 2. No hypothesis testing was to be performed. 
Virologic responses for Cohort 2 participants, based on plasma HIV-1 RNA (copies/mL), will be assessed 
at Week 24. Virologic outcomes at additional time points might also be evaluated. Virologic failure was 
defined as HIV-1 RNA  
•  >200 copies/mL,  
•  >50 copies/mL, and  
•  >40 copies/mL, and were presented in three separate analyses.  
The proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA 
Immunologic response (change from baseline in CD4+ T-cell count and percent) were also to be 
presented. 
PK Analyses:  
The mean concentrations at nominal times were used to plot the linear and semi-log concentration-time 
profiles for intensive or semi-intensive sampling for DOR, 3TC, or TFV.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 26/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The PK parameters for DOR, 3TC, and TFV for intensive or semi-intensive sampling were calculated using 
non-compartmental analysis methods. In Cohort 1, the steady state PK parameters for DOR were 
predicted from single dose PK using non-parametric super positioning. The PK parameters were 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  
The DOR PK targets for Cohort 1 to support multiple doses of DOR/3TC/TDF in Cohort 2 were steady state 
plasma drug concentration, 24 hours post-dose (observed) (C24,ss) >560 nM, the lower bound for 
efficacy based on Phase 3 adult studies in treatment-naïve participants with HIV-1 infection, and area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf)< 64.8 μM∙h, the 
exposure associated with 200 mg QD in adults. 
In Cohort 2, individual plasma DOR, 3TC, and TFV concentrations for sparse samples were summarized at 
each time point using descriptive statistics.  
All DOR PK data from both Cohorts 1 and 2 were included in a population PK analysis and reported 
separately. 
Analysis sets  
•  All Treated Population: Participants who have taken at least one dose of study drug 
•  PK/Efficacy/Immunologic Response Analysis Population(s) The primary 
PK/efficacy/immunologic response analyses for both cohorts were based on the All Treated 
Population, which included participants who took at least 1 dose of study intervention (Cohort 1, 
N=9; Cohort 2, N=45). No participants were excluded from the primary PK/efficacy/immunologic 
response analyses. 
•  Safety Analysis Population Safety analyses were based on the All Treated Population. 
Missing data 
MISSING HIV-1 RNA DATA: The Observed Failure Approach was to be used. Based on this approach, 
missing values are considered as failures for participants missing data due to discontinuation of study 
drug as a result of virologic failure or for non-treatment related reasons with last available RNA 
>200/50/40 copies/mL; otherwise participants with missing values are excluded. In the context of a 
single arm study this approach is conservative. 
For regulatory submission purposes, the primary definition of virologic outcome was to be calculated 
according to a Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF) algorithm – as codified by the FDA’s 
snapshot algorithm. Participants were to be classified as non-responders if they have missing HIV-1 RNA 
data throughout the analysis window surrounding the time point of interest. If participants discontinue 
the study drug prior to the time point of interest, virological failure will be determined by the HIV-1 RNA 
measurement at the time of discontinuation, if discontinuation occurred for reasons other than AE or 
death. For participants who have data collected within the analysis window of interest, virologic success 
or failure will be determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurement within that analysis window. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Since the missing HIV-1 RNA and CD4 values for Cohort 2 participants were to be imputed, sensitivity 
analyses were to be performed to assess the effects of these data imputations on the final results. 
Subgroup analyses  
The log drop from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA will be calculated and summarized for ART naïve 
participants. Data for virologically suppressed patients were also presented separately.

Multiplicity 
No multiple testing procedure was specified, as testing was not planned for this study. Virologic efficacy 
was a secondary endpoint and was presented for both missing data approaches, and for all three cut-
points. 
Interim analyses 
Dose was valuated after Cohort 1. An independent IMPAACT Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) reviewed 
this study regularly. No interim analysis for efficacy was planned or performed. 
As efficacy will primarily be bridged through PK/PD, efficacy evaluation was not the focus in this study. In 
this context the statistical methodology used is considered adequate. This was a single arm study, which 
limits the efficacy analyses.  
Virologic efficacy was a secondary endpoint, and no multiple testing procedure was specified, since 
testing was not planned for the study. This is acceptable, in the context that efficacy evaluation is not 
considered critical for the support of an extended indication. It may however limit the possibility to make 
claims in the SmPC.  
Missing data was coded using an Observed Failure Approach, and using a Missing, Switch or 
Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF) algorithm – as codified by the FDA’s snapshot algorithm. This is 
considered acceptable. 
Study conduct 
Part of this study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical investigator study sites were 
located in the following 3 countries: Thailand, South Africa, and the US. 
The first participant first visit was 02-JUL-2018 and the data cut-off date for the 24-week analysis was 
30-SEP-2020. 48-week data was provided with the request for supplemental information (15-DEC-2021). 
The date of the last participant visit in week 48 was 20-JAN-2021. The study is ongoing. 
The original protocol has been amended 3 times.  
Amendment #1 (07-MAY-2018): 
•  To include language that informs participants that other US, local, and international regulatory 
entities may also review study records.  
•  To update the target steady-state C24hr for Cohort 1 to be consistent with the steady-state 
C24hr obtained in adults at the proposed dose.  
•  To update blood volume to assay 3TC and TDF for Cohort 2 intensive PK to 2.0 mL.  
•  To include testing of CD4 cell count at Weeks 64, 80, and 96.  
•  To correct Section 4.1.5.3 related to requirements for virologic suppression.  
•  To indicate that treatment-naïve participants should be recalled for confirmatory HIV-1 RNA 
testing if they have an HIV-1 RNA level ≥200 copies/mL after about 6 months on study.  
•  To remove inadvertent procedures included for selection and confirmation of formulation at the 
Cohort 1 Entry Visit.”  
Amendment #2 (26-APR-2019): 
•  To allow enrollment into Cohort 2 for children in the >45kg weight group, while attempting, but 
not requiring, to enroll at least 4 participants with weight between 35 kg and ≤45 kg into Cohort 
1. In February 2019, the IMPAACT SMC conducted a safety and PK review of data for 9 evaluable 
Cohort 1 participants. Based on review of all available data, the SMC agreed that the 100 mg QD 
dose of DOR met protocol-specified safety and PK guidelines. The SMC also agreed that currently 
available data are sufficient to support opening Cohort 2 to accrual of participants weighing more

than 45 kg. The requirement to enroll a minimum of 5 participants in the 35 to ≤45 kg weight 
group into Cohort 2 was also revised to attempt to enroll this number but not require a minimum 
number of participants.  
•  To update, via protocol Clarification Memorandum (CM) #1, that the protocol criteria to allow 
enrollment of virologically suppressed participants was met. 
Amendment #3 (10-JUN-2020): This amendment was implemented to manage study conduct as a result 
of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
•  To clarify and correct certain procedural specifications in the protocol, and incorporate the 
contents of protocol CM #2, which was issued on 31-MAR-2020 to safeguard the health and 
wellbeing of study participants in the context of circulating SARS-CoV-2 and the associated 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
The protocol was amended three times. The study was single arm and open label, so it is reasonable to 
assume that results were known to the sponsor at the time of amendments. However, the nature of the 
amendments is not causing any concern. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In Cohort 1, 10 were allocated and 9 received study intervention. One participant enrolled was not 
treated because of being lost to follow-up (ie, did not return to the study site). 
In Cohort 2, 45 enrolled and all received study intervention.

Except for the two treatment-naïve participants all in Cohort 2 were virologically suppressed and the 
mean CD4 counts at baseline were >700 cells/mm3, there seem to be a missing value for one participant 
at baseline. 
The 2 treatment-naïve participants both had baseline HIV-1 RNA levels >500,000 copies/mL and CD4 
counts <120 cells/mm3.

Numbers analysed 
Numbers of participants (planned and analysed):  
In Cohort 1, up to 20 participants, 12 to <18 years old, with HIV-1 infection were planned to be enrolled 
to achieve 8 evaluable participants weighing at least 45 kg (with an attempt to enrol approximately 4 
evaluable participants weighing between 35 to ≤45 kg). As of the data cut-off or database lock date for 
this report, 10 participants were allocated to treatment in Cohort 1 of which 9 were evaluable.  
In Cohort 2, up to 45 participants, 12 to <18 years old with HIV-1 infection were to be enrolled to 
achieve 40 evaluable participants in the weight group approved for Cohort 1 (with an attempt to enrol 
approximately 5 participants in the 35 to ≤45 kg weight group, if this weight group enrolled and was 
approved in Cohort 1). As of the 24-week data cut-off or database lock date for this report, 45 
participants weighing ≥45 kg were allocated to treatment in Cohort 2 of which all were evaluable. Forty-
four participants completed study treatment through Week 48.

Both at Week 24 and 48, the majority of the participants that were virologically suppressed at baseline in 
Cohort 2 maintained HIV-1 RNA levels below each cut-off, which is anticipated in this population.  
The one treatment-naïve participant with protocol-defined virologic failure had records indicated 
noncompliance to study treatment, see additional information below. 
Ancillary analyses 
Change from Baseline in CD4 Cell Count (Cells/mm3) 
The mean change from baseline CD4 cell count using the OF approach was maintained over time with 
small increases observed in virologically suppressed participants in Cohort 2. Increases from baseline in 
CD4 cell count were observed through Week 48 for the 2 treatment-naïve participants in Cohort 2.

Protocol-defined Virologic Failure and Development of Viral Drug Resistance 
One treatment-naïve participant in Cohort 2 had protocol-defined virologic failure (defined as 2 
consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA test results ≥200 copies/mL) by Week 24. 
The participant had no evidence of baseline resistance and showed a consistent decrease in HIV-1 RNA 
levels achieving virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA <200 copies/mL) by Week 16 of DOR/3TC/TDF 
treatment. However, this suppression was not maintained at Week 24, and the participant was counted 
as a protocol-defined virologic failure in the Week 24 analysis. The participant had no emergence of 
phenotypic or genotypic resistance to DOR, 3TC, or TDF. The participant’s records indicated 
noncompliance to study treatment based on 7 missed doses and plasma levels BLQ (reported as <1.00 
μg/L) for DOR, 3TC, and TFV at Week 8. The participant was allowed to continue on the study with 
counseling to improve adherence to treatment and was still in the study as of week 64, however, there 
was no re-suppression of viral RNA. 
Palatability and Acceptability Assessment 
Most participants reported that the overall taste, tablet size, and shape of DOR and DOR/3TC/TDF were 
acceptable and manageable, with no problems swallowing either tablet. All participants in Cohort 2 were 
offered the choice of oral tablet or oral granule formulation of DOR/3TC/TDF. However, no participants 
opted to take the oral granule formulation.

Statistical Analysis and Methods: 
Efficacy Analysis: Efficacy for Cohort 2 was assessed based on the proportion of participants with HIV-
1 RNA levels at 3 cutoff levels (<40 copies/mL, <50 copies/mL, <200 copies/mL) at Week 24 and 48. 
Immunologic response was assessed based on mean change in CD4+ T-cell count and mean change in 
CD4+ T-cell percent from baseline.  
Missing values were addressed using 2 approaches: 
• 
• 
The FDA Snapshot approach, which considered participants with missing data to be failures 
regardless of reason. 
The OF approach, which considered participants who prematurely discontinued assigned 
treatment due to lack of efficacy to be failures. Participants with other types of missing data 
were excluded from the analysis. 
The FDA Snapshot approach was the primary approach for the analysis of the proportion of participants 
maintaining virologic suppression based on the 3 HIV-1 RNA cutoff levels. The OF approach was applied 
as a sensitivity analysis. Immunologic response was analyzed using the OF Approach.  
Subgroup analyses for efficacy responses were conducted using both the OF and FDA Snapshot 
approaches. Subgroup analyses for immunologic response were conducted using the OF approach.

Results 
Efficacy and Immunologic Response through Week 24 for Cohort 2 
The majority (>95%) of virologically suppressed participants in Cohort 2 
maintained HIV-1 RNA levels below each cutoff (<40 copies/mL, <50 
copies/mL, and <200 copies/mL) at Week 24 based on the FDA Snapshot 
approach. One of the 2 treatment-naïve participants achieved HIV-1 RNA 
levels below each cutoff. 
Based on small sample sizes, limited conclusions can be drawn from an 
examination of virologic responses by demographic factors. However, 
virologic responses for virologically suppressed participants in Cohort 2 at 
Week 24 were generally consistent across subgroups of sex, race, region, 
and ethnicity. 
Mean log10 plasma HIV-1 RNA decreased from baseline through Week 24 for 
treatment-naïve participants in Cohort 2. 
The mean change from baseline CD4 cell count was maintained over time with 
small increases observed in virologically suppressed participants in Cohort 
2. Increases from baseline in CD4 cell count were observed through Week 
24 for the 2 treatment naïve participants in Cohort 2. 
Efficacy and Immunologic Response through Week 48 for Cohort 2 
At Week 48, 93% (40/43) participants who switched to DOR/3TC/TDF in 
Cohort 2 remained virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) at 
Week 48, based on the FDA Snapshot approach.  
Similar to Week 24 the mean change from baseline CD4 cell count using the 
OF approach was maintained over time with small increases observed in 
virologically suppressed participants in Cohort 2 up to Week 48. Increases 
from baseline in CD4 cell count were observed through Week 48 for the 2 
treatment-naïve participants in Cohort 2. 
Protocol-defined Virologic Failure and Development of Viral Drug 
Resistance for Cohort 2 
One out of 45 participants in Cohort 2 had protocol-defined virologic failure. 
This treatment-naïve participant had no evidence of baseline resistance 
and no emergence of genotypic or phenotypic resistance to DOR, 3TC, or 
TDF. 
No participant met the criteria for protocol-defined virologic failure (defined as 
2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA test results ≥200 copies/mL) between 
Week 24 and Week 48. 
Palatability and Acceptability 
The majority of participants reported that the overall taste, tablet size, and 
shape of the DOR and DOR/3TC/TDF tablets were acceptable and 
manageable and that they had no problems swallowing the tablet. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study is not powered for a precise estimate of efficacy and no control arm is available for comparison. 
Rather, given that exposure is comparable, efficacy will be extrapolated through a PK/PD-bridge which is 
in line with EMA guidance.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The results of the study show that the majority of the virologically suppressed participants maintained 
suppression of HIV-1 RNA viral load with 41/43 (95.3 %) of the participants below 40 copies/mL at week 
24 and 40/43 (93%) of the participants below 40 copies/mL at week 48. One participant discontinued 
from the study due to pregnancy after 8 weeks of treatment but had HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at 
discontinuation and 1 had missing data at week 24 for <50 copies/mL and <40 copies/mL due to low 
specimen volume. 
Viral suppression was also achieved in 1 of the treatment-naïve subjects, the other had treatment failure 
linked to noncompliance. Up to week 48 de novo resistance was not reported. The mean change from 
baseline CD4 cell count was maintained over time with small increases observed in virologically 
suppressed participants. In the 2 treatment naïve participants increases from baseline in CD4 cell count 
were also observed through Week 48. The included adolescents were treated with the approved Delstrigo 
tablet, none of the participant opted for the oral granules (TDF/3TC/DOR). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Given that exposure is comparable, DOR or DOR/3TC/TDF is effective in the treatment of HIV in 
adolescent patients weighing at least 35 kg. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
P027V01MK1439 evaluated the safety and tolerability of DOR and DOR/3TC/TDF in adolescents based on 
assessment of AEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory values of all 54 participants exposed to study 
intervention (the All Treated Population). Primary safety analyses were conducted with data through 
Week 2 for Cohort 1, and through Week 24 for Cohort 2. In addition, all available safety data for Cohort 2 
(through a database lock 07-JUL-2021) including week 48 has been submitted. 
Patient exposure 
In Cohort 1, a total of 9 participants received a single dose of DOR.  
In Cohort 2, a total of 45 participants received at least 1 dose of DOR/3TC/TDF. The mean (SD) duration 
of days on study intervention was 296.4 (58.5) days. 
Adverse events 
Most common adverse events 
Cohort 1 
In Cohort 1, AEs were reported in 4 of 9 participants (44.4%) through Week 2 following single-dose 
administration of DOR 100 mg. Two participants had Grade 1 (mild) increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (1 of these participants also had Grade 1 diarrhoea); 1 participant had Grade 1 
decreased neutrophil count; and 1 participant had Grade 2 (moderate) increased blood alkaline 
phosphatase, Grade 2 increased blood glucose, and Grade 1 increased blood phosphorus. None of these 
AEs were considered serious or drug-related based on investigator assessment. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 42/63 
 
 
 
 
Cohort 2  
One or more AEs were reported for all participants during the first 24 weeks of the study. The most 
frequently reported AEs (≥20% overall) during the first 24 weeks of the study were increased alanine 
aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased blood creatinine, decreased carbon 
dioxide, and decreased glomerular filtration rate, see table below. Most of these were Grade 1 or 2 AEs, 
were not considered serious or drug-related based on investigator assessment, had an outcome of 
‘recovered/resolved’ or ‘recovering/resolving’ at the time of database lock, and had no action taken with 
regard to study intervention. No AE led to discontinuation of study intervention. 
One participant had a reported drug-related AE (Grade 1 dizziness in a treatment-naïve participant). No 
participants permanently discontinued treatment due to an AE. One participant discontinued from the 
study due to pregnancy after 8 weeks of treatment. No participants in Cohort 2 died during this study.

Grade 3 or Greater Adverse Events up to week 24 
In Cohort 1 there were no Grade 3 (severe) or greater AEs reported, using DAIDS AE grading for severity. 
In Cohort 2 Grade 3 AEs were reported in 9 (20.0%) virologically suppressed participants during the first 
24 weeks of the study. No Grade 4 (potentially life-threatening) or Grade 5 (death) AEs were reported.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no SAEs reported in Cohort 1. 
In Cohort 2 one SAE (gastroenteritis) was reported in a virologically suppressed participant during the 
first 24 weeks of the study. This SAE was considered Grade 3 (severe) and not related to study 
intervention based on investigator assessment, had an outcome of ‘recovered/resolved’, and no action 
was taken with regard to study intervention. One SAE of lip injury Grade 2 was also reported in the same 
patient which resolved. 
There were no deaths in either cohort in the study. 
Laboratory findings 
In Cohort 1 laboratory values that met the predefined limits of change were observed in 1 participant in 
Cohort 1 who had a Grade 1 change in neutrophils. No participant developed liver toxicities based on the 
liver chemistry criteria used in this study (i.e., Grade 2 or higher AST or ALT AND Grade 2 or higher total 
bilirubin AND, at the same time, alkaline phosphatase less than Grade 2). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 47/63 
 
 
 
 
 
In Cohort 2 the most frequently reported laboratory values that met the predefined limits of change 
(>10% of the total participants) in Cohort 2 during the first 24 weeks of the study were Grade 1 changes 
in alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase, and Grade 2 changes 
in creatinine. Changes in liver parameters were mild and asymptomatic and not associated with bilirubin 
increases. No participant developed liver toxicities based on the liver chemistry criteria used in this study 
(ie, Grade 2 or higher AST or ALT AND Grade 2 or higher total bilirubin AND, at the same time, alkaline 
phosphatase less than Grade 2).

Cohort 2 Weeks 0 to 24: Creatinine 
Table 23 – Summary of Changes From Baseline in Laboratory Test Results All Treated Population, Cohort 2 
Weeks 0 to 24: Creatinine 
Glomerular filtration rate decreased was reported in 42.2% of the participants and was the most 
frequently reported Grade 3 AE reported in 3 (6.7%) participants up to week 24.  
Blood creatinine increased was reported in 26.7% of the participants, 10/45 participants had Grade 2 and 
2/45 had Grade 3 increase in creatinine, however there was no relevant change in mean creatinine values 
over time, the mean baseline value was within normal limits. The incidence of renal related AEs is likely 
due to TDF exposure as renal toxicity is a known issue with TDF.  
Moreover, the known bone toxicity associated with TDF exposure is a particular matter of concern in 
growing children. The Applicant has not addressed this issue and no new data on bone density is provided 
with this application, hence this study does not shed any further light on this safety concern of TDF. 
According to the Applicant none of the Grade 3 AEs were considered related to study intervention by the 
investigators or led to discontinuation of study intervention.

Vital Signs, Physical Examinations, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
There were no clinically meaningful findings based on vital sign measurements or physical examination 
assessments in this study. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In Cohort 1 there were no discontinuations due to AEs reported. 
In Cohort 2 no participants permanently discontinued treatment due to an AE in Cohort 2 during the first 
24 weeks of the study. However, 1 participant discontinued from the study after 8 weeks of treatment 
with the study intervention due to pregnancy and decided to electively terminate the pregnancy. 
Cumulative safety data for Cohort 2 
The cumulative safety data includes all data available from Study Day 1 through database lock 07-JUL-
2021 of the safety update report (SUR). Forty-four participants completed study treatment through Week 
48 in the cumulative SUR period. 
Most frequently reported adverse events 
The most frequently reported AEs (≥20% overall) in Cohort 2 by decreasing frequency were decreased 
glomerular filtration rate, increased ALT, increased blood creatinine, increased AST, decreased blood 
bicarbonate, increased blood ALP, decreased carbon dioxide, decreased blood potassium, and headache. 
The majority (77.8%) of AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity and the results are consistent with the 
week 24 data.  
The median (range) time on study intervention in Cohort 2 for the cumulative SUR period was 590 days 
(57 to 651 days).

Grade 3 AEs that were previously reported in the week 24 data set and 1 additional participant with a 
Grade 3 AE (scrotal abscess). No Grade 3 or greater AEs were considered drug-related per investigator 
assessment. Two participants with Grade 3 AEs reported in the week 24 data set had additional Grade 3 
or greater AEs as follows: 
•  One participant with previous Grade 3 AEs (diarrhoea and gastroenteritis) had additional AEs of Grade 
3 increased AST and Grade 4 increased ALT that led to discontinuation of study intervention. The AEs 
were considered ‘not recovered/not resolved’ at the end of the cumulative SUR period. The participant 
also had a Grade 2 hepatitis C infection,  
•  One participant had previous Grade 3 AEs of increased blood creatinine (resolved) and decreased 
glomerular filtration rate reported (improved to Grade 2). This participant had additional AEs of Grade 
3 increased blood creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration rate during the SUR period.  
Other Serious Adverse Events 
One participant with an SAE of gastroenteritis and Grade 2 lip injury that was previously reported in the 
24 week data set had additional SAEs of Grade 1 COVID-19 and Grade 4 increased ALT as of the SUR 
database lock. The Grade 1 COVID-19 had outcomes of ‘recovered/resolved’; no action was taken with 
regard to the study intervention. The Grade 4 increased ALT was considered ‘not recovered/not resolved’

at the time of the SUR database lock; this participant had subsequent AEs of increased ALT and increased 
AST with hepatitis C infection that led to discontinuation of study intervention.  
One participant had an SAE (Grade 3 scrotal abscess, mentioned above) with an outcome of 
‘recovered/resolved’; no action was taken with the study intervention in response to the event. 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study Intervention 
Four participants discontinued study intervention in the cumulative SUR period. One due to AEs of 
increased AST and ALT. Two participants discontinued due to pregnancy. One has been described in the 
Week 24 data set above, the second pregnant participant discontinued after week 50 of study 
intervention and the pregnancy resulted in a live birth with no reported congenital anomalies. Another 
participant discontinued due to noncompliance with the study intervention. The latter 3 participants also 
discontinued from the study. 
Laboratory findings 
In the cumulative SUR period, in addition to previously reported laboratory findings in the week 24 
dataset (one with Grade 3 ALT increases, two with Grade 3 creatinine increases), one participant had 
Grade 4 ALT increases and Grade 3 AST increases. 
The 3 most common (>20%) laboratory findings that met predetermined criteria in the cumulative SUR 
period were increased creatinine, increased ALT, and increased AST. Most creatinine elevations were 
Grade 2 (defined as >1.3 to 1.8 x ULN or an increase of 1.3 to 1.5 x baseline). The majority were 
intermittent or documented on a single visit, and all except 2 remained within normal limits of 0.5-1 
mg/dL (1 participant had an increase from 0.8 mg/mL at baseline to 1.06 mg/dL, which subsequently 
decreased to 1.0 mg/dL, and one had an increase from 0.81 mg/dL at baseline to 1.01 mg/dL, which 
subsequently returned to baseline). Of the 2 participants with Grade 3 creatinine elevations (defined as 
>1.8 to <3.5 x ULN or an increase to 1.5 to <2.0 x baseline), one remained within normal limits and one 
was 1.05 mg/dL (slightly above the ULN; baseline 0.72); both resolved while continuing study 
intervention. None were assessed as drug-related by the investigator or resulted in study intervention 
discontinuation.

Table 26 – Summary of Changes From Baseline in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) All Treated 
Population, Cohort 2 All Data Available as of SUR Database Lock 
Of the 26 participants with a Grade 2 and/or 3 creatinine and eGFR changes, 11 had an eGFR that was 
Grade 2 at the pre-treatment screening visit compared to baseline. Of the three participants with Grade 3 
decreases in eGFR at any time point, two had pre-treatment eGFR that was Grade 2 compared to baseline 
and the creatinine value was within normal limits through week 48 (participant creatinine ranges were 
0.43 to 0.65 mg/dL and 0.46 to 0.74 mg/dL). The third participant’s pre-treatment eGFR was Grade 2 
compared to baseline and the GFR was Grade 3 at day 34 and returned to Grade 2 for all visits thereafter. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The P027 study is not powered to generate a comprehensive safety database in children and no control 
arm is available for comparison. Rather, given that exposure is comparable, safety will be extrapolated 
through a PK/PD-bridge. 
A single dose of doravirine (100 mg tablet) was generally well tolerated in study P027 (Cohort 1) through 
2 weeks of follow-up. There were no Grade 3 AE, SAE or deaths reported. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 53/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Delstrigo is a fixed dose combination that in addition to doravirine and lamivudine contains tenofovir 
disoproxil as fumarate (TDF). Tenofovir impacts renal handling of calcium and phosphate, and secondary 
to this, may impact bone turnover. This is generally considered manageable in adults, but the impact of 
tenofovir on growing bone has remained a concern and uncertainty which has not been resolved. With 
regards to treatment of adolescents, it should be noted that TDF containing products are “indicated for 
the treatment of HIV-1 infected adolescents, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first 
line agents, aged 12 to < 18 years”. The background for this restricted indication is the potential for 
renal/bone toxicity overall, which may be more worrisome in growing individuals. The restricted TDF 
indication in adolescents stands in contrast to the adult indication of Delstrigo, which is not restricted due 
to any safety concerns related to growing bone.  
The Applicant has not addressed bone toxicity associated with TDF and no new data on bone density is 
provided with this application, hence this study does not shed any further light on this safety concern of 
tenofovir. 
Twenty-eight participants were identified as either having an adverse event of glomerular filtration rate 
decreased and/or blood creatinine increased. The majority of the changes to creatinine and eGFR were 
transient and intermittent and none were considered related to the study medication. 
There was no death in the study, one participant had multiple SAEs (Grade 3 gastroenteritis, Grade 2 lip 
injury, Grade 1 COVID-19 and Grade 4 increased ALT) and had subsequent AEs of increased ALT and 
increased AST with hepatitis C infection that led to discontinuation of study intervention. Another 
participant had an SAE of Grade 3 scrotal abscess with an outcome of ‘recovered/resolved’.  
A total of four participants discontinued study intervention in the cumulative SUR period. One due to AEs 
of increased AST and ALT. Two participants discontinued due to pregnancy and another participant 
discontinued due to noncompliance with the study intervention. The latter 3 participants also discontinued 
from the study. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety of doravirine in adolescents is mainly extrapolated from the adult setting based on PK 
bridging. The safety of lamivudine in adolescents has since long been established. It is not clear whether 
tenofovir is a safe drug in subjects with growing bone, due to its impact on bone formation via renal 
tubular toxicity and the same restrictions of indication as for previously approved combination products 
with tenofovir are applied to Delstrigo. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The WSA submitted an updated Risk Management Plan (RMP) versions 3.0 ( DLP for this version: 02 April 
2021) for Pifeltro and Delstrigo with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the RMP version 3.0 is acceptable dated 15 February 2022. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 54/63 
 
 
 
 
However, for Delstrigo RMP only, the WSA should take the following into consideration at the end of the 
procedure: 
- The final wording of the indication is pending on the final outcome of the CHMP Rapporteur’s 
assessment of this variation procedure No. EMEA/H/C/WS2065, as the final wording in the RMP has to be 
in line with the final wording agreed for the SmPC. 
- The reference “[Ref. 5.4: 05NM0X]” should be replaced by the reference “[Ref. 5.4: 07XP7W]”, that 
corresponds to the latest version of the EU guidelines, in section SVII.2 and deleted from section 
“References”).   
The CHMP endorsed this advice. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 3.0 with the following content: 
-  Reflect  the  extension  of  the  indication  to  include  the  treatment  of  HIV-1  infection  in  adolescents  and 
children weighing at least 35 kg; 
- Update in accordance with EU guidelines and GVP module V (rev.2), including a proposal to remove the 
following safety concerns: 
Important Identified Risks (Delstrigo) 
- Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B 
- New onset or worsening renal impairment/Renal toxicity 
- Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD)/bone events due to proximal renal tubulopathy 
Missing Information (Pifeltro and Delstrigo) 
- Long-term safety 
- Safety during lactation 
- Safety in elderly patients

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated for Delstrigo and Pifeltro to include the new indication for the paediatric population weighing at 
least 35 kg. The Package Leaflet (PL) has been updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to make minor editorial corrections and the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet has been revised.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
These proposed revisions do not constitute significant changes that would require the need to  
conduct a new user consultation. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Delstrigo and Pifeltro are indication for the treatment of HIV.  
The goal of combination antiretroviral therapy in paediatric patients is to achieve and sustain HIV-1 
virologic suppression, preserve/restore immune function, minimize drug toxicity, prevent drug resistance, 
and ultimately lead to normal growth and neurocognitive development. 
The applicant is seeking an extension of indication as follows (boldface italic indicates the extension: 
Pifeltro is indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of 
adults, and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 35 kg infected with HIV-1 
without past or present evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Delstrigo is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of 
resistance to the NNRTI class, lamivudine, or tenofovir (see sections 4.4 and 5.1) 
Delstrigo is also indicated for the treatment of adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing 
at least 35 kg who are infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of resistance to 
the NNRTI class, lamivudine, or tenofovir and who have experienced toxicities which preclude 
the use of other regimens that do not contain tenofovir disoproxil (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The recommended initial treatment of HIV-1 infection for paediatric patients is therapy with 2 NRTIs in 
combination with an InSTI or an NNRTI (≥3 years of age) or a boosted PI (<3 years of age). The choice of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 58/63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HIV-1 therapy depends on various factors including the availability of age-appropriate formulation, ease 
of use, age/developmental stage of the patient, prior exposure (maternal or prevention), adherence, and 
in adolescent girls, the risk of pregnancy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is based on a single arm cohort where virologically suppressed participants aged 12-18 
(n=43) were switched to DOR/3TC/TDF (100/300/300 mg) QD; and treatment-naïve participants (n=2) 
were initiated on DOR/3TC/TDF (100/300/300 mg) QD. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The clinical benefits of treatment with DOR or DOR/3TC/TDF in HIV-1-infected, treatment-naïve or 
virologically suppressed adults, has been established. The efficacy demonstration in adolescents is based 
on a PK bridge, whereby efficacy is inferred through similar exposure in adults. 
The results of the study show that the majority of the virologically suppressed patients, maintained 
suppression of HIV-1 RNA viral load with 41/43 (95.3 %) of the participants below 40 Copies/mL at week 
24 and 40/43 (93%) of the participants below 40 copies/mL at week 48. One participant discontinued 
from the study due to pregnancy after 8 weeks of treatment but had HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at 
discontinuation and another participant discontinued due to pregnancy after 50 weeks of treatment and 
the pregnancy resulted in a live birth with no reported congenital anomalies. One participant had missing 
data for <50 copies/mL and <40 copies/mL due to low specimen volume. Viral suppression was also 
achieved in 1 of the treatment-naïve subjects, the other had treatment failure linked to noncompliance. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It is well known that adherence is on average lower in adolescents than in adults, resulting in less 
favourable outcomes in terms of virological suppression. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of DOR and DOR/3TC/TDF is mainly bridged from adults, based on similar exposure. 
In the adolescent cohort, the most frequently reported AEs (≥20% overall) during the first 24 weeks of 
the study were increased alanine aminotransferase, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased 
blood creatinine, decreased carbon dioxide, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Most of these were 
Grade 1 or 2 AEs, were not considered serious or drug-related based on investigator assessment, had an 
outcome of ‘recovered/resolved’ or ‘recovering/resolving’ at the time of database lock, and had no action 
taken with regard to study intervention. No AE led to discontinuation of study intervention during the first 
24 weeks. During the reporting period for the cumulative safety update including week 48 the majority 
(77.8%) of AEs were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity and the results are consistent with the week 24 data. 
One participant discontinued study intervention due to AEs of increased AST and ALT. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Delstrigo is a fixed dose combination that in addition to doravirine and lamivudine contains tenofovir 
disoproxil as fumarate (TDF). Tenofovir impacts renal handling of calcium and phosphate, and secondary 
to this, may impact bone turnover. This is generally considered manageable in adults, but the impact of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/104864/2022 
Page 59/63 
 
 
 
 
tenofovir on growing bone has remained a concern and uncertainty which has not been resolved. The 
Applicant has not addressed bone toxicity associated with TDF and no new data on bone density is 
provided with this application, hence this study does not shed any further light on this safety concern of 
tenofovir.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy and safety of doravirine and the combination of doravirine with lamivudine and tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is based on PK equivalence with adults, in accordance with regulatory practice 
in the field of HIV.  
The previous concerns regarding the PK bridging exercise have been adequately addressed by the 
company. 
The exception to the rule above, pertain to age specific safety concerns. Regarding treatment of 
adolescents, it should be noted that TDF containing combination products are “indicated for the treatment 
of HIV-1 infected adolescents, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line agents, 
aged 12 to < 18 years”, or similar formulas. The background for this restricted indication is the potential 
for renal/bone toxicity overall, which may be more worrisome in growing individuals. The restricted TDF 
indication in adolescents would stand in contrast to the adult indication of Delstrigo, which is not 
restricted due to any safety concerns related to growing bone.  
There is no place in therapy for Delstrigo in patients that have limited treatment options due to 
resistance. The indication for Delstrigo is restricted to adolescents without past or present evidence of 
resistance to the NNRTI class, lamivudine, or tenofovir and who have experienced toxicities which 
preclude the use of other regimens that do not contain tenofovir disoproxil. 
Some minor changes are proposed in both SmPC to reflect the 48-week data and a minor update of Table 
6 of steady state PK in the Delstrigo SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The B/R balance is positive for Pifeltro and Delstrigo in the sought indication.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Delstrigo and Pifeltro are positive provided general statement on conditions.

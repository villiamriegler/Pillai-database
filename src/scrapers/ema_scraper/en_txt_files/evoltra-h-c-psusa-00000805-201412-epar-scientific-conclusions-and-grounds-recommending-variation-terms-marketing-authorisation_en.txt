Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for clofarabine, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A search in the Marketing Authorisation Holder safety database retrieved 25 cases reporting acute 
hepatic failure/hepatic failure (including 24 fatal cases) and 13 cases reporting hepatitis (including 1 
fatal case).  Although the majority of cases were confounded by concurrent conditions (especially 
sepsis and multiorgane failure) and/or concomitant medications, the PRAC concurs with the MAH 
that safety analysis provides sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between hepatic 
failure/hepatitis and clofarabine. In support of this position, a potential risk for hepatocellular injury 
in association with clofarabine was evidenced in a multi-cycle 6 months toxicity study in rats. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding hepatitis and hepatic failure, the PRAC considers that 
changes to the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for clofarabine the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing clofarabine is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.
